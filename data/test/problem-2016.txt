“That sounds like a lot of fun! You should talk to people about it, and we could maybe do it next weekend! Ooohh, someone could go to Hogsmede and pick up some firewhiskey from Madam Rosmerta” Harry exclaimed.
Afterward, Pansy and Draco bid their goodbyes to Blaise and head off to the library where they said they were going to work on ‘homework’, when in reality, Draco was about to tell Pansy his deepest darkest secret. When they get to the library, Pansy and Draco go straight to the back to the restricted section and find the most secluded table in the whole room.
“Alright, well that’s not all I wanted to tell you. Today before dinner, I went on a walk around the castle to clear my head, and I stumbled upon Harry and Hermione having a somewhat heated conversation. Harry was talking about how he’s in love with this guy, but shouldn’t be because they used to be sworn enemies and now they’re friends”  Draco articulated.
Harry gently grabbed Draco’s hand and cradled it close. He took a deep breath. “You were...kind of brutal, honestly, when you were on the phone with Ella just then.”
Backstage was its own sort of quiet chaos, with everyone bustling about trying to get to their places and find their assigned section. He looked over everyone in the darkness, his eyes having adjusted a minute ago, searching for the individual crew heads and motioning for them to meet him in the corner where his stool was.
It was difficult confirming what the children had undoubtedly suspected. Draco didn’t dare meet any of their eyes.
Quickly, he woke Lily and James up and informed them of their mother’s arrival, before ducking into his and Harry’s room to take a few fortifying breaths.
Finally, he murmured, “I’m not sure, sweetling. Everyone has to leave at some point, in one way or another, and often we don’t know why.”
“Yeah,” Draco said, taking another drag. “Of course, we all looked like specters back then. I was white as a sheet, myself, but I chalked that up to my complexion.” He winked at her conspiratorially.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You, my darling friend, are being dramatic. Save that shite for your ex-wife, not for me.” Harry winced at the use of “ex-wife”, and Draco cringed. “Sorry.”
That night, Draco sobbed into Astoria’s breast, bemoaning his status as heir to the Malfoy name, how he had been expected to marry a woman to carry on that damned name. And she just held him and stroked his hair, with the baby in her belly kicking up a storm as if he could sense his father’s distress.
It took Harry a long while to notice it, but Draco admired people who could withstand his more acerbic moods. He respected that kind of strength, and often when he met someone, Draco would be ten times ruder than he was normally. Harry chalked it up to the Slytherin side of things.
Draco felt faintly ridiculous, still standing in full costume, but he still had things to do. He stomped up to the sound booth, having not missed how Mimi’s mic cut off for a second in
Draco realized he was in love with Harry one night when Potter was laughing brightly over his mug of ale, green eyes twinkling in the light of the neon signs lining the walls. The pub they were visiting was one of Draco’s choosing, and they were there celebrating the announcement of Potter’s third child.
Teddy was last, giving Harry a hug and whispering something in his ear. Harry flushed at whatever the young man said and lightly whacked him upside the head.
Cast parties were infamous in their own right. Each show, a member of the cast or crew would pick a pub to host the party after the final show. It was a production on its own, a way for everyone to let loose after weeks and weeks of stress. Cast and crew members could bring a plus one if they chose so, and, as such, Draco invited Harry to tag along. It would be Harry’s first time attending a cast party, and Draco felt a wicked sort of delight in being the one to introduce the man to it.
Draco rolled his eyes and turned to face Ella. Her long black hair was twisted in a messy updo and she was wearing glasses instead of her usual contacts. “She wasn’t around much when they were growing up, and she didn’t want custody when she and Harry divorced five years ago, so she hasn’t seen the kids since.”
He huffed out a smoky breath. “We all lost somebody, Ginny,” he said softly. “Your own mother killed my Aunt Bella. I mean, she deserved it; she was a right bitch, but my point still stands.”
Harry didn’t know what to say. It was always so obvious how much Draco loved his wife, and it was obvious how much this all devastated him. “I’m sorry.”
Draco chuckled, shaking his head. He and Astoria announced the impending arrival of their firstborn a few months prior, and he was ebullient. “For her sake, I hope they get on well enough.”
“Well,” Draco said, walking to pick up Scorpius so they could head home after this. “I’m here if you need anything.”
When Draco emerged from the hall, he was rubbing his eyes tiredly and whoever he was talking to had gone.
It was funny, Draco distantly thought while following the actors’ lines. He had never pictured himself being a stage manager in Muggle London, but he couldn’t be happier. His father would roll in his grave if he found out, of course, but Draco didn’t care about that. The people that mattered were happy for him.
No one objected; everyone seemed to sense his mood. Draco hadn’t meant to make things depressing. He certainly didn’t mean to cut any of his children off. It was just difficult - exhausting, really - to discuss such things. He had hit his limit early.
Potter had already celebrated with his own friends, Draco knew - he wasn’t invited to that particular event due to obvious reasons - but the man also made the time to invite Draco out, jubilant with the news.
Draco sighed and took a drag of his cigarette, morose. He was ashamed enough of his actions during the war as is; he didn’t need Ginny Weasley of all people telling him he fucked up. He knew that. He accepted it. He moved on.
“Harry,” Draco softened his voice. “You’re hurting, and you’re my best friend. I’m entitled to buying you a drink and you are entitled to a night among adults where you can bitch. Or cry. Whichever you prefer.”
Upon his entrance, both heads swivelled up to look at him. Draco crossed his arms and leaned into the doorway. “Gossiping about me, I take it?”
He didn’t think Ginny knew what to say. She just stared at him, opening and closing her mouth like a fish.
Draco sighed, stepping out onto the balcony. He snuffed out his cigarette in the ashtray in front of the daybed before saying, “Sure.”
Ella picked up on his anxiety the minute he stepped into his office the following morning, clutching his coffee the way he had clutched his mother’s hand on her deathbed.
When Draco looked at the kids, they seemed morose. His voice softened. “No, I wasn’t okay, I -” He took a deep breath. “Before the Dark Lord came to live with us, I would sneak out and go to muggle clubs to relieve some...tension. I met a few friends there - they were the ones who got me into muggle theatre - and we had a good time. They kept me from thinking too hard about what I had done.”
“Scorpius and I can make ourselves scarce while she’s visiting, then. She won’t be spending the night, so we can leave after breakfast and return after dinner. Besides, there’s plenty for me to do at the theatre and all my colleagues love him.”
“I went clubbing, naturally. Got fucked in an alleyway a few times; did a few things my mother would have been appalled at had she known what they were. All that good stuff.”
“Yeah,” Draco said bitterly. “Naturally, I felt like an ass. Stupid, too - I was relatively safe with all the men I had been with, but…”
“Oh, no,” Draco said, affronted. “For one thing, he’s at school in Scotland now, and secondly, he’s far too young for this.”
“It’s almost nine in the morning. What else am I supposed to do? Day drink?” Draco paused. “Actually,” he mused. “If I were to do that, I’d get properly sloshed.”
“Fantastic,” Draco said. “I can’t guarantee I’ll be able to spend much time with you while the show is going on, and it might have some stop-and-go moments, but I think it’ll be fun for the kids to see. I saw this for the first time - I was about fifteen or so - and it was just dazzling, you know?”
Astoria was released from the hospital three days later, with orders to remain on bed rest. Harry offered to help with the baby, but Draco declined with a smile and a shake of his head. “He’s my son. I’ll be fine.”
Truthfully, Harry was the only reason Draco didn’t open the door in his pajamas only to shut it in Genevra’s face and tell the wretch to leave.
Draco sighed. It seemed he would be doing a lot of that this weekend. “I’m sure she has her reasons, darling.”
“I just don’t understand why she’d wait so long to see us. Or why she’s never asked to see us before this,” Albus muttered, scowling at the floor.
If Draco were being honest, he hadn’t expected the divorce in the slightest. Harry, for all that Draco loved him for it, was loyal to a fault, and so Draco had always predicted Harry remaining steadfast. Miserable.
“I wouldn’t change it for the world,” Draco continued. He didn’t care if he was being sappy or redundant. “Crazy bitch ex-wife and all.”
Draco pulled the shirt over his head and set it to where Harry laid the leggings and reached for his own clothes. He had them tucked away in his backpack, and after digging them out and pulling on his trousers, he continued. “Mother said that Sirius -” Harry’s breath hitched, like it always did when talking about his godfather. “Sirius used to share his records with her. They were quite close, from what I could tell.”
“Look, Genevra,” Draco interrupted. “If I thought you were thinking about the children upon making this request, I wouldn’t be such a bitch about it. But they’re my kids, too, and as such I need to look out for them.”
It was the sound of his phone vibrating on the bedside table that woke Harry up. Ginny groaned her protest from where she lay beside him, rolling over and grumbling. “Sorry, sorry,” he mumbled, rolling out of bed. He picked up the call, murmuring a near-silent “Hello?” into the speaker as he left the room.
A pause. He could feel his face turning redder by the second. It took him a minute to realize he probably shouldn't have been so explicit.
It was showtime at the Piccadilly Theatre in London, and everyone was bustling backstage. Draco was making last minute checks on sound and lights, flitting about like a hummingbird on speed. He loved the rush of the theatre these first few minutes between showtime. Call for places was in five minutes, and he was just about to call for his interns to spread the news, when his newest intern ran up to him, panting.
From the corner of his eye, Draco saw Ella on the dance floor, grinning and becoming him over. He took another sip of his water and pushed himself off of his seat, stumbling. Harry wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist to steady him, and Draco shot him a blinding grin before running to Ella and grabbing her hand.
Draco, on principle, didn’t sing. Harry knew this, his colleagues knew this, Scorpius and all the little Potters knew this.
Draco continued, a little louder, “When they do leave, it hurts, and often you think you’re better off having not known them at all, to save yourself from that hurt, yes?” He looked them each in the eye.
It was true. A few years ago, Draco had gone into a muggle tattoo shop and covered the damn thing in a bunch of Narcissus flowers that trailed up his forearm.
Suspicious, he turned around, crossing his arms across his chest like a petulant child. He raised an eyebrow.
“Ella, sweetheart, what am I supposed to say? ‘Ah, yes, I single-handedly caused the siege of Hogwarts. It was terrible; I witnessed one of my best friends die in a fire and I can still hear his screams to this day.’ Or, better yet, ‘Ah, yes, Voldemort himself tortured me so much that I’m still constantly trembling.”
“Oh, no, no, no. They will feel worse. If I pulled half the shit they’ve done while I was interning, I would have been fired within the first week.”
On those occasions, they’ll go out on their balcony and sit together. Draco will have a smoke, Harry will clutch his cup of tea like a vice. They never really talked, unless one of them needed to cry, or rage, or rant.
Draco shook his head. “It’s really not.” He sighed. “I don’t...It’s not that I don’t want the children to know. I do; I just would have told them much, much later.”
Harry was already in bed when Draco came through the doorway, reading a book. He looked up from his book and smiled at Draco as he entered the room, the same bright, carefree smile Draco fell in love with many years ago.
Ella winced. Draco tried not to take too much pleasure from it. “What’s got your knickers in a twist?”
Now that he and Ron were old enough to know they were both shits at the time they had met, they got along just fine. Draco wouldn’t go so far as to call them friends - too much damage had been done in that respect to ever be able to call each other friends - but they could sit down for a pint and have a friendly conversation.
Sometimes, Draco didn’t believe this was his life. That he and Harry were actually married, that he’d gotten this lucky. If he was being honest, Draco wasn’t sure if he deserved it, for surely he had to atone for all the things he’s done at some point, right?
Draco harrumphed and nudged Harry’s shoulder. “Yeah. Your children are quite spoiled, despite your best efforts.”
“Well,” she had said, her eyes glinting in the light of the drawing room. “He always dressed in muggle clothes. This infuriated my Aunt and Uncle, of course. And he was a Gryffindor! The only one in our family.”
“Oh, most definitely,” Draco agreed. “But,” he continued. “What was even more impolite was you bringing up something that happened over twenty years ago - something I had not yet discussed with the children.”
There was a reason he rarely interacted with the wizarding world. Aside from how he was one of the most disgraced wizards of his time, he didn’t like how every little thing reminded him of the war. It was why Harry took the kids to Diagon every year before school; why Draco had most of the magical things he needed delivered to them by owl.
Well, he thought to himself, at least she didn’t start throwing hexes. Draco doubted that would be a pleasant thing for the children to wake up to, and he personally didn’t feel like handling any more family drama than was necessary.
Ella was young, fresh out of college and with enough energy to fuel a small house. She was small, probably only around 155 centimetres tall, and thin enough Draco worried she would float away with a strong breeze. Her sheet of black hair reached the small of her back, and her dark skin always seemed to glow, which Draco attributed to her youth. Ella was always smiling, always finding a reason to laugh, and, honestly, Draco loved her to pieces. She reminded him of Scorpius.
And truly, Harry understood. It was frustrating to have someone stepping on your feet all of the time, especially if they kept screwing up. But he also knew Draco was particular on the best of days, and the poor girl likely just hadn’t found a way to fit into his routine. “Are you sure you’re not just being contrary because you like working by yourself?”
Draco felt like a teenager again, lost and sad and afraid, only this time he didn’t have a steady group of friends to escape to. This time, he only had his son, Harry, and the theatre.
Draco never mentioned to Harry that he could sing. It had never come up in their relationship, and maybe that was a good thing. Sometimes a surprise was good for a relationship, Draco thought, though he never thought his little secret would be revealed like this. He was definitely looking forward to seeing Harry’s reaction after the show.
His heels clicked against the linoleum as he picked up a box of smokes and a cheap plastic lighter. It had smiley faces on it.
When he told Harry as much, one day while visiting the Potter house, the man threw his head back and laughed. “God help us. If they are nearly as mischievous as we were, they will be insufferable.”
Potter laughed even harder at that, and it filled Draco with such happiness that he was the one that caused that laughter. “Oh, but by the time this one goes off to Hogwarts, it’ll be joining your own sprog. Another rivalry for the ages.”
If today was any sort of sign for how this weekend was going to go, he wanted no part of it. He hated the children’s doubt when it came to Ginny. No child should ever have to deal with that.
Draco opened the door, and leaned against the jamb, watching Harry putter about. It looked like he was going through Sirius’ old things, sifting through an old trunk and pulling the odd clothes and knickknacks out.
He grabbed them and went to go sit on the balcony, expertly lighting his pipe, puffing once, twice, thrice, and exhaling. He looked out at the city, at all the muggles buzzing about like bees in a hive. What simple lives they all must lead.
Scorpius led him and Harry through the front door and into their little front lawn, where they found the rest of the kids huddled around someone.
Harry sighed. “You know this is going to be tough either way. Doesn’t matter if I’m married to you or not.”
Ella laughed. Standing up, she said, “Now who says I don’t want to see that?” Draco wrinkled his nose and she laughed harder. She walked up to him and kissed him on the cheek, turning to whisper in his ear. “I can’t believe your fiance is Harry bloody Potter. You have some explaining to do, Malfoy.”
“Oh, I doubt it. I remember the aftermath of the fights you would get into before you two were divorced. I think your exact words were that ‘she could hold grudges better than Snape himself.’”
Draco glanced at Harry sitting beside him. “He gets this from you.” He turned back to his son. “Where is everyone else?”
It was a short walk to the train, and Draco gave each of the children a hug and kiss on the cheek before they all boarded, sighing when he was left alone on the platform. He could feel the weighted stares falling upon him, and it took nearly all of his energy to remain standing upright. Even after all these years, he was still scrutinized by wizarding society.
“I know. And I’m thankful every day for that. But, Harry,” Draco was still playing with Harry’s fingers. “Ginny still sees me as the enemy. She always will, I think, and I can’t blame her for that. I just don’t want her to treat you or the children any worse for it.”
He sighed, mixing a spoonful of sugar in the dark liquid. There could have been worse things. At least he was recalcitrant.
Harry hummed, going to stand over Draco’s shoulder. He was right; the baby was a bit squashed, all red-faced and pouting. But there was Draco’s pointy chin and nose in miniature, and it was strangely, awfully cute. “He looks like you.”
“Thank you,” he said, with too much conviction - so much conviction - and dashed for the corridor leading to the Maternity Ward. The room numbers seemed to fly by as he ran, knocking past several people and ignoring their hushed shouts.
But at the same time, it felt like they were in their own universe. Time seemed to stop the way it did in grocery stores or airports after two in the morning. It was slow, syrupy, but it made anything seem possible.
God, what would she say about this? Draco could just hear it. She would laugh and adoringly say he deserved it for how much of a prick he was back then. He would probably agree.
Draco scoffed. “Obviously. You looked like a fucking ghost; that was how much it washed you out. There are few very specific shades of pink redheads can wear and that was not one of them.”
Draco scoffed, vanishing the cigarette and the ash before sitting up to light a new one. “I’m not small where it matters, darling.”
Harry huffed, frustrated. “Babies don’t care about time, Gin. You know that.” He waved a hand at her own rounded belly, and she glowered.
The theatre was a grand old thing, with high ceilings and portraits of actors and sponsors long since dead. Scorpius seemed to know the way, he pointed to different halls and rooms and babbled like he had been there a million times before. Knowing Draco, the boy probably had.
He arrived before Harry did, and as soon as he set his bag down in its spot by the door, he headed straight for the display case that held his pipes and tobacco.
“Yes, that seems to be the general consensus this evening. I thought the same when I first saw myself.” He looked at the clock hanging on the wall. “I take it’s time to go?”
“I don’t wish to see her right now, Harry,” he hissed, pleading. “I’m in a fairly good mood and I don’t want that ruined.”
Desperately, he grabbed his husband’s hands, tracing over his fingers reverently. “Harry, that’s not what I meant. I just meant you married me. Out of all the people you could have married after your divorce, you picked me.”
Draco hung up and sprinted for the dressing rooms. That understudy was going to get an earful from him later, but for now he needed to get Amber on a voice steamer and see if he could find someone to play Angel.
Draco cringed. “Well, I do hope that blows over.” He looked at Harry, who was still staring after Weasley, frowning. For a moment, Draco just looked at the other man, admiring him. Harry had barely aged a day since the first time they had met after the war. He still had the same piercing green eyes, the same silky dark hair, and clear brown skin. The only things that marked a difference between now and then were the fine lines running across the man’s forehead and lining the corners of his eyes, and the thick black beard adorning his chin.
And, oh, what a loaded question that was. “You never asked, darling. I didn’t know you wanted to know about her.”
“Whatever.” Draco paused, his voice taking a more serious tone. “I mean it, Harry. They shouldn’t have to deal with her bullshit.”
Just before she ran off, Draco called her name one last time. She paused and turned and he looked her in the eye. “Thank you.”
Draco was drunk. He could feel it in the steady thrumming beneath his veins, how his head felt as if it were stuffed with cotton. He felt weightless - which wasn’t all that, bad, considering.
This was all fine and good - though it was ultimately the children’s choice, Ginny had a right to see her kids - until Draco had the sudden realization that Ginny might not even know Harry had remarried.
Harry absentmindedly, wrapped his arm around Draco and Draco sighed again, before actively tuning into his husband’s conversation.
Draco laughed quietly. “I know.” He paused. “Also, after the show, I suspect a man will try to come backstage to come and look for me. If he has a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead, let him through, yes?”
There was one thing he did without telling Draco. When he was still in the infirmary, Draco insisted he didn’t want Harry to do anything to Crabbe and Goyle that wasn’t more serious than the odd hex. He said they were nothing but little fish, that he didn't care for them at all, that he stopped a long time ago, but Harry wasn’t all that lenient. When Draco was supposed to go back to Slytherin, Harry cornered the two monsters in a corridor leading to the dungeons. He explained in rather clear terms what he expected from them – namely, to stay the
Draco brought his shocked gaze up to meet the green eyes that stared at him, the very epitome of misery. He completely, completely forgot about Potter, who had been spending the last five minutes of silence mentally beating himself up. He thought Draco was angry with him.
There was no excuse for them to stay much longer after the food had been consumed. Potter paid the check and they went outside, the cold night air pinching Draco’s skin and making him shiver. “That was a great choice of place, Malfoy. One of the best Indians I’ve had.”
, for this was going to be a daunting and terrible task that held so much at stake. But still, it was good to be doing something. He was so sick and tired of sitting helplessly and waiting. Now they were taking action, rebelling against Voldemort himself, and not only that but they were going to help Draco. He nearly ran down the steps with the other two, trying not to look too gleeful.
The hands ushered him up to sitting on the sofa, and He stood above him. Draco bowed his head low. “Thank you, Sir. It means… everything to me.” A slight tug at his chin made him raise his head, opening his eyes. There was a familiar look on the pale face above him that sent a cold shiver down his spine.
There was a pause. “Perhaps. Perhaps not. There’s only one way for you to find out, really.” Draco closed his eyes and thought hard. Dobby said he had everyone, that he could take them all. Why wouldn't he? Who could he have left behind? His father was probably lying. Most definitely lying. And still… fear nagged at the back of his mind.
Harry struggled to pay attention to anything that was happening during the lesson. He was so distracted, he tried to add the wrong ingredients at least four times, and Hermione had to pull his elbow to stop him from adding his Gurdyroot to her cauldron instead of his. By the end of the lesson he got the lowest grade possible for his potion, which honestly smelled pretty foul, but he didn’t care in the least. He just wanted to get out of there, out of this torture, and get the greasy long hair out of his sight…
for one glorious, warm, dazzling second. Then he crashed right back to the unforgiving ground. Fear was always so much stronger. “Potter, please don’t tell him.”
Draco squinted at him. He didn’t think Potter was actively trying to humiliate him, not with the way he looked at him just now, but he was doing a good job of it regardless. “Because I wanted to, Potter. I wanted to kiss you.”
“What?” Potter’s confusion, unlike Draco’s, wasn’t growing, but rather quickly transforming into something similar to revulsion. “What do you mean he knew everything you thought?”
“So we have. Forgive me, I do forget sometimes. The past year affected me in many different ways.” He tilted his head to the side inquisitively, and Draco knew it meant he was not convinced. “Could you remined me, where was it that we met?”
“He won’t do a thing,” Harry said, trying to keep his bitterness at bay, perhaps not so successfully. “He doesn’t care. When Mrs. Malfoy was there he didn’t do squat to help her, did he? He would just get mad at us for even going in the first place.”
Hands clenching into fists he slammed himself into the wall, eyes shut forcefully, deep measured breaths blowing back on his face from the cloak.
“You don’t need them as well,” he said, directing his words towards Lucius. “Your master wants me, he has no use for them. Let the others go, and I will come quietly.”
Perhaps he actually screamed; it was impossible to tell exactly what happened, because all Draco could see was the blood, all he could hear was a faint screech of
Then the door opened and Draco just wasn’t brave enough to look. His eyelids fluttered shut, his breath hitched, and there was hardly any sound as light footsteps came closer. Then the door closed and he just didn’t know what to expect.
“Shut up,” was the weak answer he got back, but Harry had had about enough. He got up to his feet and walked towards him.
“It wasn’t a command, I was just saying. I’m not your fucking ex-boyfriend, you don’t owe it to me to do as I bloody say.” Potter’s face was flushed and upset and Draco could not stand to look at it right now, because he could recognize the hurt in it too, and it just wasn’t fair.
Harry let his shoulders drop with relief. He felt numb, completely out of it. Seeing the face he used to dream of killing for so long didn’t have the effect that he expected on him. He thought he will be feeling furious, that he will have to forcefully stop himself from tearing her from limb to limb with his bare hands. Instead he felt… dizzy. Very, very dizzy. He tried blinking a few more times.
“You will?” Malfoy’s lips pursed and his eyed glinted malevolently. “How exactly do you propose to do that, Weasley? Do you conceive yourself more powerful than the Dark Lord?”
(wow, was there anything more obnoxious than that?) resolved to bringing Hermione Granger as expert. Expert in what, Draco couldn’t tell, but expert nonetheless. It’s not like he could say no to Harry’s pleading face (or at all. Probably ever. Not that it mattered), and so he shrugged helplessly, and down she came to do her worst. She sat by his bed with some polite chit-chat which made his stomach turn, casting all sorts of diagnostic spells, all while reading three books simultaneously. Draco was tired just from watching her work.
“Exactly. Now, if you’re quite done lecturing me, I need to resume with my… duties." He shivered a little again. "if you don’t mind, Potter, you can go and get lost now.”
Apparently Weasley and Granger were engaged to be married this spring, and Draco thought it was only about bloody time. They were all but draped around each other ever since they’ve left school, at least from what he read (and although the papers – back when he used to get them – weren’t so full of stories of them as they were of Potter, he was still treated to the odd one at least once a week). He expressed his congratulations and asked for Potter to never, ever pass them on. They were on a light, smiley sort of mood, and Draco was feeling antsy with it.
“That’s all right, I thought you might feel that way, so I brought us a portkey. I won’t have to touch you at all.”
“Thank you,” the Slytherin retorted, this time in a completely normal tone. “I’ve been waiting to hear you say that for a long time now.”
“Not in so many words. He did convey the idea he was at the Dark Lord’s side. He said my father sends me his best wishes.” There was more than just a little doubt in his tone.
For a very distressing moment, it looked like Potter might actually cry. Draco averted his eyes, filled with shame. He couldn’t do this, couldn’t see someone like
killing him; the pain ebbed behind his eyes and between his ears, and it was getting hard to bear. More importantly, it was absolutely imperative to get Potter out of this place instantly - apparently Draco could not control himself even to save his own life. He could not be trusted for a second longer. He'd already said so much more than he should have.
The boy was… Draco stared at his naked form and felt his embarrassment. This was just it: he was able to feel that, just embarrassed at his nakedness, not…whatever it was Draco’s stomach was trying to do now, something with guilt and terror and an ache to be hurt. This boy was angry, but in ways Draco didn’t ever imagine he could be. He was indignant, for Merlin's sake. Indignation did not pass his mind in – never, it never passed his mind. He was never indignant. Yet here he was, watching his young self being it, and… it made so little sense, Draco had to believe it. This used to be him.
“Are you here to punish me, too?” He thought he knew now why Harry came to him. True that he has paid a lot already, and a heavy price indeed – he had been
“See, I knew that whole ‘I won’t ask for more’ thing was a ruse. What is it now? You want me to quit my dangerous job to become a carrot farmer?”
until a hand landed on his shoulder, cold and long fingered and brutal in the amount of pain it caused. “No! don’t touch him! don’t you dare touch him!” Draco did not expect the master to obey. Indeed he did not. Instead, he leaned heavily onto Draco, pushing on the very sensitive torn flesh and eliciting a huge gasp out of his cracked lips.
“No, not really,” Draco’s fingers tapped his left arm, longing for the bracelet, but it was gone, it was gone. “I’m always safe, with them.”
“No, please, go and do whatever it was you wanted to do. I'll tell you some other time.” They had pizza for dinner, and Draco didn't want to see little pepperoni pieces dotting the carpet when he will most certainly sick up if he continues thinking about it. He pushed the uncomfortable thought away.
Everything broke inside his head, a mayhem of flames and suffocation and dark, dark depths, and he knew he was doomed. There was no avoiding this anymore, he couldn’t lie to him. He couldn’t, not even to protect himself from Him. Whatever it meant, whatever he was giving up on now, it didn’t matter. He may lose his life over this, and the screams in his head were deafening, but Draco had to focus. He could fall apart later. Right now he owed Harry an explanation. He gathered all the strength still in him and tried his fucking hardest.
Whatever defeatist attitude Draco was about to adopt, he rejected it now. There was something in his belly - not enough, but something still, and it will have to do. He promised himself, didn’t he? Promised. What happened the last time won’t happen again, not ever. He won’t just stay still and let them do whatever they wanted. He won’t
“You should be scared, too.” He didn’t say it as a threat, or to be smart; Harry could see he actually meant it. “He's coming for you, Potter. Nothing else occupies him at the moment. You think you are safe, but you aren't. You cannot be.”
Harry’s smile grew wider. “You’re welcome. Did you get any other cards from – er – other people?” Malfoy’s eyes became a little unfocused for a second.
“This looks much tastier than last time,” Harry said as lightly as he could, raising the molten-silver potion. Draco did not seem amused.
“I know it can be hard to lose someone you love,” Malfoy added in a low voice. “Well I don’t really – I mean, I’ve never actually – I didn’t – but I can imagine how it would feel. I do imagine it, every day. I’m truly sorry.”
These thoughts sparked such an incredible terror in him – infidelity in its crudest form, a shift in his allegiance, was simply not a thing Draco could take – and he sank to his knees before the half hour he allotted himself was done. He forced himself to close his eyes to make it worse, and didn’t let up until the middle of the night. He spent the rest of it rolling on his rug, miserable, confused. He had no idea what to bloody think. Then it was morning and he had to go to work.
“Mr. Longbottom, Mr. McMillen, you guys are up.” Professor Electra’s voice carried through the hallway, and Neville glanced back towards her.
“I’ve not done that in a while,” Harry objected to general laughter. But then it made him think. “It didn’t happen in a while,” he repeated quietly, giving Hermione and Ron meaningful looks.
“Oh, no thanks,” Harry waved off the glass of champagne offered to him, and Draco’s gaze zoomed back to him. “I don’t drink.”
“Maybe that was a part of it,” Granger nodded carefully, “but I’m certain it wasn’t everything. You got the best out of him, too. Do you know that in seven years he’s only gone to St. Mungo’s once, when you asked him to? Even when he was injured at work he’d just have me heal him, then when I refused to continue this way he trained Kreacher. He simply wouldn’t go. We begged him in the past, literal begging, and it did nothing. He only agreed to go because it was you who asked.”
“That would be great,” she said, and that was that. Draco had been roped into trying to help their doomed mission in which he absolutely did not believe. But if he never showed them – Harry, Mother, Weasley (who came to visit twice already), Granger – if he never showed them how sad and hopeless he felt, then they wouldn’t feel sad or hopeless themselves. And he'd already given them enough of that to last a lifetime.
“You do?” The green eyes were filled with so many contrasting emotions, they were hard to read. There was pain there, to be sure, and traces of bewilderment, and
, that he had someone who cared for him without wanting to hurt him. He didn’t trust it, not really, but maybe he could have. Maybe he was even beginning to. Right up until the night when he ruined it all, because that was just the kind of arsehole he was.
“My son…” Narcissa said, and Harry straightened up to look at her. The silvery eyes were nearly torn, so wide and desperate they looked in the light of the fire. “My son…” Ron, with the instincts of a truly great Quidditch player, caught her right before she hit the floor. He sat her down gently on a stool a house elf brought over and she leaned on the large table behind her for support. She looked painfully weak.
Oof, he really did hate him. A deep, gushing, bubbling sort of hatred running hot all over his body. He hated him so much, so wide, so forever, to such an extent that – no, wait, actually no. He didn’t hate Harry. He didn’t hate him at all. He loved him, and he was allowed to tell himself that he did, allowed to feel it too. He loved him. He was free, which meant he was free to make his decisions, which meant he was free to love whomever he chose. And wasn’t that – in its own pathetic little way, didn’t that mean he really was - sort of - okay?
Malfoy didn’t snort now. He straightened up in his seat and looked him right in the eyes. “Do you really think you could – face him? Do you really believe it?”
“Since when?” One of the Weasleys asked, a handsome one who may have been Charlie. He supplied the question with a hearty clap on Harry’s shoulder, which made Harry laugh and Draco feel highly uncomfortable.
Showered and dressed, his mind still conveniently numb, Draco faltered into the kitchen. “You must be hungry, Draco. Here.” There were two bowls of soup and slices of buttered toast set on the table, and he noticed them with evident confusion. This was odd. They almost never ate together. Draco followed the man’s movements cautiously, blowing first on the soup then taking small gulps. It was scalding hot, and in the very first instant it touched his tongue the soup burned it to a crisp. It didn’t matter. There was no chance he'd have noticed the flavor anyway, not with the proximity between them, not with the way He was looking at him.
It took all the words out of his mouth, and Draco was left gaping. “I – okay,” he said in the end, flabbergasted. “I won’t.”
They sat down at the table and stared uncomfortably at each other for some time. When he felt he simply can’t take it anymore, Draco sighed. “Listen, Potter. Azkaban was not easy for me. I – some of the things that happened there were a bit beyond my capacity, to be frank. Even when it was over, during my parole, when I thought I could… I don’t know, I thought I could do it, but obviously I couldn’t. There was no miraculous rising from the ashes sort of thing. I figured the only way for me to regain a shred of normalcy was to cut myself off completely. It was my only way to survive. Can we please just call it at that?” This was about as far as he was willing to go. He could not divulge anything more, not if he wanted to keep his sanity.
And if he could trust him… Draco swallowed something the size of an entire dragon’s egg. But he couldn’t trust this. There was too much on the line. As he opened his mouth to say no, that he won’t fall for this, that he will not be tricked again into believing – that he will never let himself be tricked again – he found he simply couldn’t.
They moved as one unit, spells blasting loud noises and blinding flashes. Neville got his figure no bother, and Draco was running in earnest towards his with Ernie keeping an eye for the others. Harry grinned like a maniac. Draco moved swiftly, gracefully, like he always bloody did, and it was a sight to be seen. That body – now so much better fed, far less brittle, slick and slender in a very appealing manner – made him hot in a way that wasn’t at all to do with the adrenaline rush. He could watch this all day, every day. With a slight effort he took his eyes off of Draco, just in time – “Ernie, watch out, one’s coming right at you!”
But it wasn’t an ending, really. It wasn’t a beginning either. He didn’t have to learn anything anew or start over, and he didn’t need to be afraid. This was… a sort of a middle, in a way. A comfortable, familiar middle. A middle which will have plenty of little starts and endings in it. All of those instances and moments, he had all of them now, the entirety of his life to dread and look forward to. A middle. He could live with a middle.
“Do you think we should try to talk to Snape? If he really was trying to help you all this time?” Harry watched with concern as the slightly-ill-looking color in Draco’s cheeks deepened.
Unsurprisingly, there was no sleep for Draco that night, and his exhaustion could go to hell. Only a constant tapping, like rain, in his mind. The never-ending
It ended up being an all right day, without too many customers, which suited him fine. He was so tired and his body was only half-working, and the cold was definitely not helping. Draco was damn glad when five o’clock arrived and he was able to close up shop, even if the thought of walking back to the flat was more than a little daunting. Still he made it, and collapsed onto the sofa before he could even think about it. Not on the floor, not right now. He didn’t think he’d be able to take it.
. I'm still living in the shadows sometimes, so lonely in that awful house I can hardly even sleep at night, and then I saw you. And I saw in one minute that you’re just the same as me. That you’re fucked up just like I am about all of it. I thought…” Potter rubbed his eyes again, voice cracking a little. “I don’t know. I thought I could talk to you. That you might understand.”
not when he finally had something to live for. Certain that He would come back imminently now that Potter was successfully removed, he showered and got dressed in a relatively chipper spirit. The walk to the shop only took ten minutes, despite the fact he was wearing all the outfits he possessed, and he even made it in time to get the bins out before collection. Draco was as happy as he could be, which was to say, mildly somber. Soon He will be back, because He must, and the nightmare will finally end.
The boy sighed. “Oh, that. Yes, Potter, it’s been fine. Zero suicide attempts, zero evil attacks, and I'm still completely terrified of the very notion of the Dark Lord. So we’re all good, I guess.”
“No, he was here,” she said with an uncertain air, looking around the room as if searching for clues. “Why don’t you remain here, Draco, and I’ll see if I can find him elsewhere.”
“It’s all right. We can talk about it later. Let me – I’m going to nip to the loo for a second, all right? Here, drink this too, and just… yeah, try to calm down or whatever.” He sounded odd, like his nose was blocked or something, and left with his face in his hands. Draco drank the water and thought very hard. What on earth was he supposed to do now?
“The very best,” Harry said with a wide smile, and for a moment Malfoy just stared at him, shocked. “A bit of a git, and thinks way too highly of himself, but still rather decent.” The grey eyes narrowed and the smirk returned in between the flushed cheeks.
Harry took his time looking back at him, shock and nausea swirling inside him in quick waves. He didn’t know what he expected to find in the silvery eyes now. He had seen so many different emotions reflected in them. He saw hate, back when he and Draco were rivals. He saw anger, spite, contempt. He saw hurt in those eyes, too, and pleading, although there was probably nothing Draco hated more than to beg. He saw affection and warmth deep in the silver as the two of them were getting closer, he saw joy. He saw surprise, delight. So many different emotions, so many different modes their weird friendship has gone through. But now, looking into his eyes, Harry had no idea what he would see. Victory, because Harry fell for his ploy? Disdain, for him not being clever enough? Loathing, because after all this time, this was still what Draco truly felt?
. He recognized him straightaway. This was a nightmare. No – this was far worse, because it was real, and Draco had absolutely no idea that doom had a physical presence inside one’s veins, but he certainly knew it now. Harry Potter. In his store. Harry Potter, looking at him. Fuck.
“Not exactly,” Malfoy said, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. The shackles made a loud metallic sound, and he opened his eyes immediately to look at them in alarm.
he did die, it didn’t matter. In or out of Azkaban, it wasn’t like Lucius was going to take any part in Draco’s life. He was just as lost to him now as he always was, which was mostly a relief. When he died, the memories of that night died with him. Because Draco got reprieved and exempted from ever thinking of it again. True that they kept the can in the cupboard for – for – he didn’t know exactly what for, but He’d agreed. And yes, Draco had no self-preservation anymore since he gave it all up for Harry, but it didn’t mean he had to rip himself open and bludgeon himself to death. He was in control now, not the thoughts, not Azkaban. Not Grove. Sadly, not Harry. Thankfully not Him. No, it was all up to Draco now, and he had to bloody pull it together. He can do that, can’t he? He’s done it before. It’s not like this little thing can topple the very precarious balance he had in his mind. It’s not like he’s been walking a flaming tightrope for weeks. It’s not like any little disturbance was enough to send him crashing down – spiraling – nope. It wasn’t like that at all.
Harry could have come there and then; the soft fingers curling around his aching cock was nothing like touching himself – Malfoy’s hand was a different world altogether, inquisitive, excited, eager. He stroked Harry’s shaft softly, lightly fingering his balls, skimming the sensitive skin underneath them before fisting Harry’s cock and going in earnest. Harry’s hands shot to his own hair, pulling and twisting, his thighs spreading uncontrollably. Behind his eyelids Harry saw stars exploding, supernovas bursting into space, and Malfoy’s hand on him was both searing hot and pleasantly cool.
Harry released a small sigh. “I’m not offended, Merlin. I’m just… I want you to know that I… never mind. It doesn't matter." He looked away, an awkward display of whatever the opposite of casual was. "Do you think you’d like to see Daniel today? His Healers said he’s recovering much faster here than he did in that Muggle facility.”
“This. You and me. I don’t know what that is exactly, but… I just can't see myself...” He must have seen the look on Harry’s face, because his voice was becoming almost frightened. “It’s not like I don’t want to – I mean, I just don’t think I… I’m so. Confused.” he swallowed a few times quickly, staring at Harry with huge, truly bewildered eyes. “I’m sorry. The last thing I want is to hurt you. I simply don’t think I can stomach anything right now, with all that’s happening. It’s all a little too much.”
return, and Draco will have to go with Him. Potter will be nothing but a painful memory in his mind. And he didn’t even know…
Draco could not follow the conversation after that, due to being shocked within nearly an inch of his life. Potter must have asked Weasley to sneak around the flat and assess the situation like he said he would, but Draco heard none of it. He simply could not comprehend what just happened. Naturally, he knew Weasley was a good friend of Potter’s, had been since they were children. But this level of blind trust? This level of just – following him? Draco didn’t even dream it would be possible, for two people to be so close that they’d just… believe in each other like that. Draco could never hope to achieve that in this lifetime. Sure, he followed – avidly, blindly, yes, all that – but it never came from a place of
It was a little bit terrifying, and absolutely what he needed to keep telling himself, until the very unlikely moment he believes it. Thinking today about that first year in the forest was the first time Draco let himself go into the details of how He made him… who he was. And it was just – it was sick, like Harry had once said. It was sick and twisted and wrong and he fell into it head first, eyes closed, like an idiot, like a fucking fool. Was… Draco’s chest felt cold as he thought about it. Could it be that he’s making the same mistake now?
“Ron…” Harry was too choked up to say anything for a long while. “You bloody arse, of course I wouldn’t mind. Merlin, never make any decisions on your love life thinking about me, all right? That’s just pure creepy.”
“But Harry,” Hermione persisted, “what if he does try again? You never quite mastered Occlumency. If he tried to invade your mind again, to give you more hallucinations – you have to try and stop it, no?”
The carpet in the bedroom needed hoovering, and Draco spent some extra time on his rug. He didn’t deserve a lot, that much was true, but he supposed he at least deserved a clean expanse of fabric to lie on. All the while he was battling with himself, fighting this tingling feeling at the bottom of his stomach. He could
“It’s not that I want to die,” he expressed as directly as he could. “Really, it’s not. But the potions make everything… I need to know.”
“Make it good,” he spat, a little of his fighting spirit thrumming in him for what would probably be the last time. He stared right at her black eyes, and for a second his mind was clear. he could feel Harry – gag – inside him, in the place where they tried to carve him out, and it was almost a consolation even though it hurt like hell. He loved him still, which meant he will love him when he dies. The thought made him smile through the nausea, and when the curse hit his body, he was still smiling.
see you around, then.” Potter looked like he wanted to say something more, but then just shook his head. He raised a hand in a quick goodbye and disappeared behind the door. Draco exhaled and practically melted to the floor, hugging his knees and trying hard to calm himself down. What now? What now? What to bloody do now?
“Hell, I forgot all about them. Do you remember when they grew those little… yuck. Thanks a lot, Potter. Now I’ll have nightmares for days.” In all honesty, dreaming about Blast-Ended Skrewts would be a considerable improvement to his usual nightmares, but no matter. He enjoyed chiding Potter.
Throw up seemed like the immediate answer, and so he did just that. What was left for him to retch, he had no idea, but it was still coming somehow, and gods be damned, but…
So anyway, he was taking walks. Draco was always reluctant to go – every single time, without fail – and always felt better when he returned. It was some sort of a circle, but maybe not entirely vicious. He kept walking, and that was some sort of progress, he thought.
“Yeah, you really should have learned that sooner. It never really worked in your favor, going against me. I’m glad you finally wizened up about it.”
Just like with Sirius, it was Harry’s own stupid decision that brought about this ill-fate to the person most important to him in the world. And just like with Sirius, after it happened he was told repeatedly that there was nothing he could do. Dumbledore, that bloody traitor, told him flat out that he can’t use Dobby to go back. “Lord Voldemort will be expecting you to do that, Harry. Draco would have already exposed this source of magic by now, and it’s not safe to use again.” he said it with that fake sorrow in his voice which only served to infuriate Harry. When Harry protested and said Draco would never say anything, Dumbledore was as bold as sighing very deeply and placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “He will have no
“What did you do wrong?” Harry was unable to keep from laughing menacingly. “Are you seriously asking me that?”
Harry steeled himself. He squared his shoulders, pulled up to his full height, and took very deliberate steps down to the sitting room. This was, by far, not how he envisioned his ultimate fight with Voldemort; for one, he thought he will be an adult by then, with at least another year of frantic learning in between. He also thought he will have his wand – his most important, even if only, weapon. He imagined he would feel nothing but cool, righteous courage, that he would know in his heart of hearts that
It took a while before he was able to complete the question in his head. “You think I did it because I wanted to kill myself?”
“I’m not waiting for… yeah, tea sounds good.” Potter followed Draco into the kitchen, where he boiled the kettle and prepared two cups. He used the rubbish leaves that He didn’t like anyway - it seemed imprudent to be using His tea for Potter. Blasphemous, even.
“Yeah, I was thinking about it. For a summer home or something, I don’t know. It’s just… it’s so calm here, you know? I feel like this could be a good place for me to rest. I think if I could just sit out here in the garden – with a serious heating charm or two and a cup of hot cocoa or something – then I could… I don’t know. Relax. Breathe, really breathe, you know?”
“Be quiet or I’ll cut your tongue off with this very knife, that’s what!” Malfoy looked pretty close to the edge. Harry’s grin widened. He looked about the room as if searching for something.
“You-Know-Who was the first to disappear,” Ron was kind enough to fill him in. “He must have been the only one who could apparate inside the castle, through the wards, because the other Death Eaters were stuck there. Some of them managed to jump out the windows and the holes in the wall and apparate in the air, but we got some others. Dolohov, Rowle, Avery… about five or six are now on the way to Azkaban. Mulciber is dead.” Harry found that he was automatically relieved that his explosions didn’t kill anybody, and then was mad at himself for feeling that way. He should have no qualms about killing Death Eaters by now.
conversation right now. “Potter, please. You’re… you’re still unwell. You said we’ll talk about it when you’re better.”
“Yeah, that too,” Harry smiled, slightly ashamed at himself for not thinking about it before. “And also we missed lunch, so we came to get some food.”
“So…” Potter looked like he was floundering for conversation topics, and Draco let him struggle for a moment before pitching in. It felt good to see him have the short end of the stick in the conversation for a change. But then his face grew far too unhappy, and Draco couldn’t stand it anymore.
“Harry was very concerned,” Narcissa wasn’t in the habit of stating the obvious, but Draco couldn’t tell what she really meant this time. “We all were. And knowing what I do now about this – therapy, I think there is a lot to be gained from it. In fact, I think about attending, myself.”
There were about a thousand other responses, and what Draco eventually chose to go with was, “Are you sure?”
“Harry, why do you have that picture?” Draco could not take his eyes off the smiling face. It was a Muggle picture, unmoving, and Draco was too, glued to the spot.
. He knew this man. More intimidating than the blond face, not only because the red in his eyes was the same as the red of the fire in his gut. He knew this man and he was frightened.
“So your boyfriend wasn’t a Muggle, I take it?” Potter asked, clearly trying for a diversion. Draco was grateful.
“Why’s that? Because you don’t know me either?” Harry’s voice was bitter and cold, and Draco had to tell himself twice it’s just his disappointment, because
“Oh no, I’m pretty sure she will. It’s just the notion that my father thinks it’s any news to me that had me confused.”
It took another second to be able to form words. “What?” was all he managed. It felt like Harry was speaking in tongues, like the whole thing was a riddle, a very stressful one at that, and he had not a shred of the mental capacity required to handle it.
“Safe?” Draco stared at him blankly. “He won’t be able to find me? What, are you planning on hiding me in your house for the rest of our days?”
Potter rolled his eyes. “What was it, then? What did you have every morning like the arsehat son of a lord that you were?”
? This was insane. He kept playing that moment over and over in his mind, and each time he was more stunned with himself for having the sheer audacity to do it. How on earth could he let himself – and why, why would he think that Potter would ever want to – The more he thought about it, the more Draco was convinced he’s made a colossal mistake. Gigantic. The biggest of his life, joining the Dark Lord not included. Or perhaps yes included. Well, no, not really, but still... Fuck, this was bad, this was so bad. Potter may have said he was willing, even looked it for a second – less than a second, less than a heartbeat – but he so obviously didn’t mean it. The look on his face before he straight-out fled was a dead giveaway. No; Potter wanted no part in it, and Draco really went and did it this time. He could only hope he didn’t scare him off for good.
Draco turned an impossibly whiter shade of pale. “I suppose it doesn’t matter. When my father hears I failed my test, he will know immediately I did it on purpose. He’s seen me Apparate many times before, and now that she is with him...” He bit his lip. “In any case, Snape knows.”
“Oi!” he cried out, and the blond turned to look at him. “Wait, I have something for you.” He brought the little bottle out of his pocket and showed it to him. “It’s for your wounds.”
“No,” Draco shuddered, goosebumps rising all over his body. “I have no wish to spend the day in an office full of Aurors. Death by heart attack isn’t the worst way to go, possibly, but nothing I’d like to try out anytime soon.”
“Bollocks,” Harry snorted. “Sorry, Narcissa. But Draco, come on, that’s no excuse. I go to a Muggle-born, so there’s none of that, but if you want there are spells we can use. If that’s your main concern, then there’s nothing to worry about.”
“I sent you straight into his hands. I knew he was abusive, I knew you were fucking terrified, and I… I can’t believe I did that. I’m so, so sorry. This is all my fault. I gave you my word, I was meant to protect you, and I let him… fuck, I let him ruin you. I let him do this to you.”
“Well there wasn’t much ruddy else for me to do, was there?” Harry was becoming a little annoyed again. “He wanted to fight me, so I had to fight. If the whole twin-core thing hadn’t happened, I would have been dead.”
Draco shook his head and turned the light on in the kitchen. He was very grateful then he’d remembered to clean the groats before leaving for work. “Not feeling very well. It happens sometimes.”
“Crucio!” Harry jumped onto the staircase and, judging by her stunned expression, caught her right in the chest. She gaped at him for a second before falling with a rather satisfying
With some pains, Draco pulled away so he could look into the green eyes, a little less green now with how wide the pupil was in them. “More than anything I ever wanted, you prat.”
“It will be late,” Malfoy warned, now able to look at him again. “She said she’ll come to the forest at midnight. And she won’t be alone – Greyback will come with her.” He was emanating such a strong sense of fear, Harry could nearly see it radiating off him.
He can’t, he can’t, he can’t do it. He’s not strong enough. He’s not good enough. He’s not important enough, big enough, whole enough, right enough. But enough was never enough, and the word enough stopped having any sort of meaning long, long ago. So what if he couldn’t do it? So what. He was still going to. He was still going to try, or die trying. It didn’t matter. This filthy fucking whore was going for it, it was his choice. It was the only one he could make, the only one he would ever be able to make, and he was not about to let it go. He was not about to give up the one time in history where he actually has the power to act. For so, so long he was powerless. He was cowed into submission, kept his head down and his heart locked and he never believed he could do anything at all. But now – now he could, maybe, possibly, perhaps, do something. And if he fails, then it won’t be so bad. There was nothing but pain in store for him, anyway. He might as well do this.
Draco didn’t answer at once, since he was physically unable to. Calm down now, he had to tell himself repeatedly. Take a deep breath. When he could once again breathe without making a terrible whizzy sound, he forced his lips into a bitter smile. “Do you honestly think someone would take my word over the respectable guards of Azkaban? And even if they did – do you think they would care? I was nothing but Death Eater scum to them.” Gods, he really made a mess of it, didn’t he? Why can’t he ever just keep his mouth shut? Potter looked furious, and he was going to rain hell down on their heads until the very unfortunate and unavoidable end. Draco made himself draw another deep breath. “Look, you can make up your own mind about it. Whether you believe me or not means nothing to me. Now if you don’t mind, my head is killing me and I would like to lie down.”
, and apparently wasn’t coming back. The absolute cow. He didn’t bring her to a gay club so she could sod off with the bloody barmaid. Which, to be perfectly honest, was an outcome he should have expected. Still
For a second Draco could not gather the meaning of what he said, because his brain shut off after Potter said he
“Gotta love Freddy,” he said, then kissed him again. Draco agreed wholeheartedly. Then he kissed Potter some more, and you know what, who even needed words. The club was dirty, the music so loud he could feel it in his chest, and Draco loved it all. He was alive and young and recently out and his plan actually worked, for a change.
Can you die from being too aroused? Harry seriously considered the question as he pushed deeper inside, exploring this wonderous new surroundings, until he got to something that made Draco actually mewl.
“Shut up,” the Slytherin found his tongue, his expression getting darker by the second. “Or I will shut your horrid little mouth for you.”
Something he knew, maybe, that a part of him knew all along – or didn’t know, he didn’t know anything, he never knew anything. The fog was becoming heavy again, and it threatened to take him under, he was going to drown –
He wasn’t exactly rushing towards the prospect of meeting dark wizards. His heart was nearly frozen with hollow fear as he sat on the sofa. But seeing the pain in the grey eyes was enough to ensure he will not stay behind. He will not just sit here and do nothing when there was a chance to save Draco’s mum. A chance to bring back that light into his eyes that will otherwise be gone forever. A chance to make this right, all the pain and suffering Draco had to go through this year. And then a small, ungentle thought rocked him, and he could nearly not bring himself to ask.
“Yes,” he breathed, and Potter’s hands rose as if he spelled them up. They stopped an inch away from his cheeks.
“Harry, please, I think I know you well enough. And besides, it’s not like you left Saturday night dinner early to go get an
threats of non-con in this chapter, which do not get carried out, but are still pretty bad. If you are concerned it may be a trigger, or generally for more details, please see the end notes.
“You should be worried!” for a second Malfoy forgot himself, his tone rising in anger. He quickly returned to his senses, though, shutting his mouth with considerable force. His cheeks were getting rather heated.
“It’s… all right,” Draco said tensely, shifting a little on his seat. “Potter, may I…” he took a deep breath. Perhaps it would be easier if he closed his eyes? Nope; the moment he did that he transported right out of the flat, and straight into the dark cell. Shit. Shit squared.
“Merlin,” Harry shook his head, and Draco felt a jolt of sudden, unexplained dread course through him. His frazzled, pain-racked brain could not yet place it. “Draco… oh
“Let’s go there. Everything is so clean here, it would be a shame to mess it up.” And so they got into their coats and made their way to Bombay Palace. The choice wasn't entirely random; Draco suggested this restaurant because it was the only one he remembered seeing in the area. He never ate outside, and had no idea what else the surrounding streets had to offer. Sometimes, when he’d get punished and not eat for some time, he’d walk by that particular place and nearly faint from the aroma of food hanging about the premises.
“Getting a good grade in Defence Against the Dark Arts class won’t exactly help my case. Did you notice the Against part of it? I highly doubt the Dark Lord will appreciate my efforts here.” He wasn’t looking directly at him, but rather observed his fingernails in a distant manner. Harry had to fight the urge to kick him.
“Ah, you can keep it in the sky if you want. Just know it’s yours.” His mouth opened then closed with a sigh. And Draco knew, he
That’s right, he’s decided. So what if they had wands and he didn’t. So what if they had all the power in the world and he couldn’t even stand upright without fainting. The first time they – touched him – he was too shocked to do a thing; shock made him malleable, it made him easy to manipulate, and he couldn’t fight. Those days were long gone, though. Draco would never be that innocent again. That’s exactly what made the last time so terrible, because he knew just what was happening to him, and still he could do nothing as they spelled him frozen on the floor. (It wasn’t his fault, though, it wasn’t, and no one can say that it was, because it wasn’t). Not that he really had a way to stop them now – if they tried again there was still absolutely nothing he could do – Draco began to hyperventilate, and he stopped that train of thought immediately. Calm down. With every breath you take, you’re winning a little. He closed his eyes and let his shoulders drop where he was slumped against the wall. It’s going to be all right. He was going to be all right.
could reach into his mind with much ease, but usually there was no need for that – Draco was already accustomed to the uncompromising degree of honesty that was required of him. There was nothing he didn't share, everything he had and that he was. All of it, always. There was no other way. Draco felt the light touch at his chin, releasing him from the forced state of rest, and gave the flowers a terrified glance.
“I don’t know,” he said, turning from one worried face to the other. “I really don’t know. In some way yes, it is about Sirius, and how he felt lost and angry and he didn’t have anyone to help him. And it’s also a way to avoid Dumbledore, I guess, even though I hardly need to do that, because he seems to be avoiding me too.” He shrugged again. It was true that he barely saw the headmaster since returning to Hogwarts. “And a part of it is about Snape too, I reckon. All this… anger I have inside.” He flushed, because he knew they both understood only too well what he means. They were usually the first victims of his angry lashing-out. Ron patted him on the shoulder.
Draco’s only yearning now was to touch him, but it was a constant battle between fear and need. There were some things he could do with relative ease – relative being, it was easier than sawing his own arm off – like taking Potter’s hand. But what he needed, what he truly needed, Draco didn’t think he’d ever be able to ask for. It was so much easier with Him; He would take, and Draco would give. There was no thinking and obsessing and worrying about it, just acceptance. Now… Draco hadn’t been touched in so long, which could have been a good thing, but he was getting desperate. Could it be possible that he never wanted to be touched again, but also longed to be held? He didn’t know if it made sense. He only knew that he did.
“All right. I’m not going to do anything with this information, so if you do want to tell me some time, feel free to. But if you don’t – that’s all right, too. I can wait. I know if it was someone dangerous, someone I should know about, you’d tell me.”
“Are you really…” Draco sucked in his lower lip in the way he knew drove Harry mad, the sly dog. “I know what you say, but, do you, are you, really happy with – you don’t regret – “
Draco couldn’t look at either of them, and he still couldn’t look to his left where he was (not, couldn’t be) standing, so he stared at the door. He could see the
? Someone who knows what it feels like, someone who’s still living with what the war did to us all? I have no one to talk to about it sometimes. Ron and Hermione are busy with their relationship and their careers, and they prefer to live in the world as it is now. Neville is off at Hogwarts. Luna is out of the country more often than not. Ginny and I aren’t speaking anymore. I can’t find a single person who is willing to think about it, I fucking
might have done some things you wouldn't approve of, but He’s not a monster. At least He understood me.”
There was another visit from one of His colleagues on Friday, and Draco wobbled on his knees in his corner until the man had gone, cursing out loud.
, too, he could fucking admit it already, it’s been months. Harry was… and more importantly, Draco was…
? Like a telephone?” Draco’s hesitancy turned into excitement. “Same as the ones Muggles use to talk to each other?”
“That raises obvious difficulties, of course. Now that he knows where you live, he could tell others. He could try to come here. There is a reason, Draco, that I have such strict rules. I told you there could not be a next time, and I’m sure now you see why. We are both quite compromised.”
“I can see that,” Draco said, his old wound hardly even tingling anymore. It was so much easier to forgive someone else. It was so much easier to forgive
was not forgotten, just pushed gently aside. He will tear himself about it all night, he had no doubt.
Harry thought about it. “There was a point there when he… seemed like he did know. When he looked at me, suddenly it was like he could actually
“You son of a bitch,” he said as soon as he remembered how to use his tongue, completely blind with fury. “You evil, unbelievable son of a bitch.”
“We won’t,” Pansy promised, and for some reason he believed her. She was probably the only person he’d have believed, too; she’d never lie just to spare someone’s feelings.
After they both ate enough Potter made them teas which they had in the living room, as was their custom. Draco loved that they had customs. Coffees were taken in the kitchen, tea in the living room. It was almost like having a rule, and rules were the thing that held him in place. They had just sat down when Potter excused himself to the bathroom (probably to throw up Draco’s ill-prepared poultry) and Draco was left alone to wonder what the hell, the
“Thanks for the vote of confidence,” Harry sulked. “I’m a bit stronger than you give me credit for.”
“He did seem a little off,” Ron said and walked towards the door. “Even more so than his usual. He kept asking Malfoy if there’s something he wants to confess – “
– it was almost normal. Potter struggled a little to eat , Draco could tell, but he did his best not to let it show, and to keep the atmosphere pleasant. He made excessive jokes about every and any subject he could think of (Draco didn't understand the one about the tractor turning into a field*. What type of transfiguration spell would work on such a large scale? Also, what the hell would be the use of that?) and spilled juice all over his bed in his excited chatter about nothing in particular.
Potter's voice sounded strained. “I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just that I didn’t want to distract everyone from the…
For the second trial, he had to ‘fight’ this ‘demon’ in black robes. “The Demon knows all your greatest fears,” an ancient mage warned him. But Harry saw the shoes underneath the hem of his cloak, their soles covered in shit. And if there was anything Harry knew for certain, it was that he wasn’t scared of shit.
This was intended as a first part of a series, so it is likely that part two will appear at some point... It may take some time, though, as I think I need to concentrate on something a tiny bit less heavy for a while! But in the immortal words of Arnie, I'll be back. I hope.
“Hey,” Draco answered, a little timid. The sofa wasn’t that large, and Harry was close. He smelled like coffee and whiskey and warmth and confusion. “Do you – do you want another coffee?”
It was a man sitting on a chair, tied to it actually. The guard – Grove, he recognized him now – was pointing his wand at the sitting figure, and the Crucio must have lasted at least a full minute and he still didn’t let up. None of it made any sort of sense to Draco, but he could only keep watching, horrified, as understanding dawned on him.
Draco awoke to find himself at the table in a state of high panic. A quick look outside told him it was about nine. Why wasn't He back yet? He’d promised Draco not to be late. They did agree on some other things, though, so Draco dragged himself to the bedroom and lay on the bed, grateful he doesn’t have to kneel. After the swarming attack of memories he’d experienced, kneeling felt too cruel a punishment to be able to withstand at the moment.
Draco tried a deep breath. Thoughts and memories still buzzed everywhere in his head, roaring flames wreaking havoc all around, but he had to push it all aside for as long as possible. “Not… not really. He left, but He’s coming back, and I’ll – I’ll go back to Him. I really am sorry.”
She relaxed a smidgen. “Yes, well, since your father’s release from prison… since he obviously knows you best…” she seemed to resent this fact, but Harry couldn’t much bring himself to care for her emotions. He was doing his best to keep his own at bay. He had a feeling that once this cold, fuzzy shock would blow over, he would be in some serious trouble.
For the second time He surprised Draco by giving no immediate reprimand. “You could be right, Harry Potter. After all, there were many years he could have come to me, when he was weakened and alone, only he never did trust me enough to ask for help. I know very well Lord Voldemort was not really my father. But he did create me, and I do owe him my life, my very existence. In his core he was very much my elder. So you see, he is like a father to me in that sense. And just like you, I did not grow up with my father by my side. We have a lot in common, you and I.”
“Look, I’m sorry. I don’t know if – hell, I didn’t mean for you to see that. I’m not even sure I knew it was there. I just care about you a lot, okay? I really do. You’re – you’re really important to me.” He held his arms open, pleading. Malfoy shook his head.
“Are you sure?” Snape’s familiar voice managed to pierce through the haze of pain and confusion. Draco tried hard to focus his eyes on the face in front of him which was currently swimming. “Are you absolutely certain it’s the boy?”
“I think you made that one up. You mean Agoraphobia, you dimwit.” Honestly, Draco was impressed that Potter could string a sentence with any sort of phobia in it.
For a second, Draco wondered if that was intentional. After all, He knew everything about Draco, all his worst recollections and fears. Even if Draco did not remember all the time, He did. What if the purpose of making Draco kneel every night until released was not strictly disciplinary, but a more elaborate scheme to keep him emotionally whipped? It was as likely as it was unimportant. What difference did it make, the meaning behind it? The cold fact was that every night for the past three years Draco had to come back to this flat and bloody kneel. Sometimes for mere minutes, sometimes for hours. Only too recently, for the whole fucking night. What kind of rubbish was that? What person in their right mind would do that to him, force him like that? Then he thought of Him and quietened. There was not only roughness and hate like in Azkaban. There was also warmth, and caring, and love. There was healing him when he needed it, and stroking his hair softly when he was on another brink of destruction, as he so often was. No, Draco could not doubt; he loved Him. Draco
“He kind of had to, didn’t he? I sort of blackmailed him into telling me, by saying I’d go to Dumbledore.”
“Please,” he screamed, and he thought Harry must have been screaming too, but he did not hear what he said. “Please! Sir,
“I don’t really know,” he admitted, flushed something terrible. He felt so painfully embarrassed, even more so than he usually did when proving incompetent, because – the others all knew not to expect much of him. They all looked at him with a certain amount of pity. But Teddy… fuck, Teddy had admiration in his eyes, and it was baffling and destabilizing and a bit far-fetched. He really didn’t want to disappoint him, though. He had tears in his eyes again.
was so fucked-up. Whenever Draco came close to forgetting just how much of a mess he is… well, he remembered now. All in all, it changed very little; Draco knew all along he was a miserable pile of garbage. The only thing different now was that Potter got a firsthand view of it, and knowing better what Draco really was, he was probably mentally packing his bags and getting ready to run for the hills.
A spell was cast; he felt the whoosh of magic and suddenly there was marvelous warmth in his knees, spreading from their center to his whole body. Draco uttered a startled gasp, closing his eyes, committing to this magnificent sensation. Quite often he needed healing, and he was frequently provided it, but this spell he did not remember feeling. It passed through every nerve, muscle and blood vessel in him, vibrating with energy that was both sweet and intense. Draco did not know he could have it until it filled him in every possible way, fizzing like soda. Maybe he was making this up, but from behind his closely-shut eyelids he thought he could see a light shining very near, almost like it was emanating from his very body.
Oh, good gods, not this. Calm down, he begged his raving mind. Please, calm down. For Harry, do it for Harry. He believes you’re a person, a real person, and you can at least pretend to be one for him. Because… because Harry wanted him. So badly that he was willing to show him, too, all the way. And before he left, when he reached for him, and Draco flinched – when Harry sat on his mattress like a fucking
It sounded like He was smirking. “So, do we have an agreement? You need to make a choice, now. Are you going to finally listen to reason and join me?”
Lucius pointed his wand at Draco and made him rise, hovering above the floor vertically but with his head facing down. “I’m afraid to say you’ve been duped, Potter. No one to blame but yourself, really.” He turned away and Draco barley heard as he whispered to the side, “And my son?”
“Dobby will go first to make sure the room is empty,” the house elf squeaked. He bowed towards their general direction and disappeared with a loud ‘poof’.
. He cared about Draco, yes – as a friend, like he’d said so many times. He wasn’t interested in anything beyond that. Which was fine, should have been fine, would be fine. Just as soon as Draco could get a grip on himself and stopped having these absurd dreams about him. Because even if he tried to deny it, which he did, all the time, Draco couldn’t quit thinking about Potter… like that. He did everything he bloody could to stop it, but it just wouldn’t go away. And in all honesty, as angry as he was about it, Draco couldn’t really blame himself for this one; have you seen Potter? He was a fucking god. And so he did what he was so good at and just let it go. What more could he do but try to make use of whatever time he had left? He burrowed his head into Potter’s shoulder unintentionally until he felt the other man move.
“When they took all those memories from me it made me – react a certain way. To… some things. When I would think about them, I would get ill.”
“Uhm,” said a little voice behind him, and Harry was startled to remember he was actually still in class, and that other people were still watching. Professor Electra walked from behind him and stared at the four boys. Harry was mortified, as a teacher has just basically heard him threaten another student, but she didn’t seem to mind. “Don’t worry; it’s natural for spirits to rise after such intense drills. Well, you didn’t do terribly bad,” she said softly, and then smiled. “Actually, you would have done pretty well, had it not been for the little incident near the end. Can anyone tell me what was the main issue in their performance?”
“I don’t believe that for a second, Harry. I don’t believe he felt nothing. I think he feels very strongly for you. But you’re right – none of this matters if you can’t forgive him.” Hermione let out a long sigh. “But if it would put your mind at ease, I do think you should speak to Dumbledore. at least in that case you will know you are safe.”
Draco’s eyes widened, and for a second his face was so hurt, Harry was actually ashamed of himself. “It wasn’t like that,” he insisted, and Harry believed him.
“Well then. War’s over, they say. The Kaiser is signing an armistice.” Draco looked down, suddenly and utterly overwhelmed. All these images flashed before him; the trenches, the battles. People he knew. People he wouldn’t. Hell on earth – but also a flowery scent, green eyes, a clear voice, a soft hand. A sweet taste. The soldier who brought him back all his senses. Draco was terribly afraid, and he had no idea why. “What now?”
Draco’s eyelids dropped to a half-close; is this the meaning of it all, then? “So you came to say goodbye?”
And with a huge mental tug he was finally able to remove the both of them, throwing Malfoy out with a bang. Panting, it took Harry a long moment to remember who he was and what was going on. He opened his eyes to look at Malfoy, incensed, until he registered the look on his face.
In a swift motion, Malfoy hoisted Harry off of him and sat him on the sofa, spreading his legs apart. “I want to try something,” he whispered in Harry’s ear, unbuttoning Harry’s shirt as his tongue found the bare skin of his chest, then sliding onto his knees between Harry’s thighs. He undid Harry’s zipper quickly, lowering his trousers to his ankles. Then, without a trace of hesitation, he pulled Harry’s boxers off.
“I’ve been thinking about it, and I kind of miss spending Christmas here. I’ve always loved it, and I think it might be time to go back to tradition. I’m not going to have too many opportunities, after all.”
of Harry Potter’s past lovers. Even if he was the only person who knew he existed right now. Draco barely had space enough within himself to be surprised at his reaction. He cleared his throat. “What does she do nowadays?”
Higher and higher the water rose, roaring, gushing, frothing, and Draco was swept up and down and left and right, into the bones, part of the bones… he screamed and swallowed frantic gulps, salty, dark, burning in his throat… He couldn’t swim, never learned how… his head was submerged and he couldn’t breathe…
Harry was impossible. Impossible. “He will hurt me whenever He wants and in whichever way He chooses, Harry. I’m not going to stop Him.
Harry really didn’t know what to say to that. “I’m sorry. That sucks. Although maybe you’d be better off in a new, serpent-free house after all. You could still have something green in it, if you’d like. Maybe a plant or something.”
, and Draco had to know now. He had to know. He needed to have it in his hands again so he could know. And wasn’t that the objective of this whole entire thing? Stopping the potions, speaking to Grove, hasn’t he already subjected himself to all these little catastrophes? This was the last in the chain of some very, very hard things he’d had to do. It was no different than the rest of them, and it had to happen.
Ultimately, though, morning did come, for that’s just how these things work. Draco watched the sky getting lighter and hated everything about it. He was going to have to go through a whole day like this, and for what? He was fairly certain Potter will not come back. After what he’d told him… Potter would not forgive him for sullying the sacred profession of Aurors like that. Which was so silly, because Draco told him nothing but the truth, and spared him the gory details, too. In Azkaban, the Aurors were – no, not going to go there. It’s a fresh new day, Draco, he told himself sternly, and you’re not going to fall into the same self-destructive patterns. Chin up, for crying out loud. Keep it up now and just
He took a moment to consider Harry’s proposition. “All right, I don’t think it should be too hard. We could practice together. If I get my wand back, that is.”
“There, you can see for yourself. Nothing out of the ordinary.” That was a bit rich of him to say, as every single one of his nerves tingled with the unusualness of the situation, but he tried to keep that part to himself.
Draco huffed, but it was hard to fault this argument. “I want you to be able to enjoy yourself, Harry. I’d hate it if you – because of me.”
“She’s fine,” Malfoy said, and Harry let out a breath of relief. “Greyback isn’t in the Manor anymore, but her sister comes to check up on her every once in a while.” Harry wasn’t sure if the other boy noticed that he nearly seized up when he mentioned Bellatrix. “She's going to come here on Saturday, to – to see how I am,” he finished lamely. “At least she’s still alive,” he whispered, and now Harry could tell he was trembling.
“You’re Potter,” her eyes seemed even larger than before in the low light. He knew it wasn’t a question. He affirmed it with a nod nonetheless. “But… surely you wouldn’t…” shock rendered her speechless. Harry felt for her, but now was really not the time.
“Why so glum, little Draco? You don’t like it?” Someone pulled the waistband of his pants and touched the metal rod directly to his skin, making him hiss. “You don’t want to play with us? Such a spoilsport. What do you say to just a little while, eh? Just a little game. If you won’t like it, I promise I’ll stop. We’ll do it your way tonight.” Draco’s breathing, harsh and needy, was tearing his lungs apart.
Draco waited for him on his green-covered mat pretty much holding his breath. He should be back in a few hours, he said. Draco prayed he really will. To pass the time he tried to think of all the books he ever read in his life, and to see if he remembers any of the characters. Thinking about all that – and about a tiny little Potter in his bed, surrounded by a class of six years old – calmed him down enough, and after some time he even forgot to count the minutes. He couldn’t wait for Potter to return so he could tell him that.
“I mean I’m a bad influence on the people in my life. I brought them nothing but grief and trouble. Trust me, it's better for everyone that I’m gone.”
“Oh,” Draco said, surprised. He bit his lip, but there was no stopping what his insane tongue wanted to say: “We don’t really need two. One will be enough.”
“So Hermione is going to keep an eye on Snape, and I’ll take the knuckleheads,” Ron said lightly as Harry sat down. “You grab Malfoy and bring him to Dumbledore’s office. I reckon you’ll be fine leaving, but in any case, you have your cloak?” Harry nodded. It was such a relief to have the other two with him, supporting him, helping. He almost didn’t feel so queasy anymore.
“Draco,” Harry said slowly, intentionally. It felt weird on his tongue. Weird and thrilling and unbelievingly right, like he finally, finally could admit it to himself. The blond blinked at him, mouth gaping, almost as though not daring to believe it. “Draco,” he said again, and a light smile appeared on the pale face, like a ray of sunlight after a storm. “Draco.”
. He just copied what He’s done, because he was mindless for years, but he still retained some fucking information. Even dogs can do that, and Draco was little more than a dog to Him. Draco never even considered looking at the box, trying to open it, wanting to open it, and it was this precise reason that made him able to do so now. He was so, so,
He didn’t think about anything, and he wouldn’t have been able to do it if he tried, but the movement seemed to flow naturally in him. He tightened his grip on both shoulders and just dove forward, landing on Malfoy, and it took a few breathless moments until their lips found each other. Malfoy gasped again, and Harry’s tongue seized the opportunity and slid into his mouth. He didn’t know what he was doing, but it felt so good nevertheless; his tongue was desperate to explore, moving fast inside these new surroundings, and it was so shocking he forgot to breathe. Then Malfoy’s tongue found his and they clashed together, intertwined, moving swiftly and smoothly, and it was so warm and wet and baffling, Harry thought he could do it forever.
It took a couple more seconds for him to get his bearings, another to down his drink, then another to get up. It was far, far too hot. Too hot for a club, too hot for anything. He didn’t even bother grunting ‘no’s anymore at the riffraff coming at him; a beacon of light danced, with abandon, at the center of the dance floor, and Draco had to get to him. Because – because. This was the plan, wasn’t it? He’d orbited Potter long enough. And he prepared the perfect speech.
“Yes, I think I know what you mean,” Malfoy gave him a sheepish look. “Gods, Potter, what have you done to me?”
, and it was bloody fantastic. He could not get enough of it. He kissed every inch of Malfoy’s body before taking him in his mouth and trying to convey it all in every single swipe of his tongue.
Just after reaching that conclusion, Draco’s body finally gave in and he passed out. It may still take hours, days, years of this torture. There was no way of knowing how long it will be. Draco’s eyes rolled back and he lay there, open, waiting. At some point it will end. At some point. He believed it with all of his crumbling, bursting heart. He could do it.
“Are you kidding?” Potter asked in a painful little croak. “Please, Draco, please don’t say things like that to me, don’t apologize. I know I said you can tell me whatever you want, but… for you to take responsibility over the messed-up shit they’ve done, to hear you apologizing for it, it’s a little beyond me to bear. It wasn’t your fault, and you have nothing to be sorry for. Nothing. Okay?”
“I’ll make us some tea?” Potter asked with a light grin, and Draco followed him into the kitchen like a lost puppy. Suddenly sending Potter away didn’t sound like such a good idea anymore; If he goes, Draco will be alone, and he was too scared for that right now. No, he was being silly. Of course he wanted Potter to stay. Potter was strong. Potter could –
“No, not a dream. This is… unfortunately this is all incredibly real.” But it didn’t make any sense. Draco performed one last test, closing his eyes and opening them, but the figure sitting next to him did not disappear. Harry was – Draco had to admit, he was there, right there. He…
“Shut it, or what?” the boy asked in a wide smirk. Harry felt the familiar anger bubbling inside him.
“You’re up,” he said in a shaky little voice, and Draco felt his words washing over him like a welcome breeze. He spotted a wet cloth in Harry’s hand, and realized what was touching his face before. Harry had been gently wiping it. What an odd dream. “Oh god, Draco, I thought… oh god.”
Draco did open his mouth, but it was only so he could throw up again. He had nothing left in him anymore, it was just bile, sour and painful on his infected gums. “Please,” he whispered, and already someone was getting ready behind him, a hand placed on his bum. “Please!” his voice was high and desperate, and it made them laugh. His father’s eyes were wide, torn almost with despair. Draco didn't want to live. He did not want to live.
“No,” Draco looked everywhere, frantic, “no, no, it can’t – I need it, I need it with me at all times – please,
But he missed his chance; the door opened and Wormtail stood there with a nasty grin. Next to him was the face Harry hoped he’d never have to see again. God, Bellatrix only looked worse the more he stared at her. “There you are, Draco. I thought I told you to remain in the study.”
Potter studied him for a moment. “Did something happen that made you think about that all of a sudden?”
Potter seemed content to see him eating, and resumed consuming his portion. It felt a little rude, but it was impossible not to watch him - Potter was mesmerizing, the casual way he was conducting himself, the confidence that oozed from every movement he made. Draco envied him for it so much it almost burned. He also found himself, very much against his wishes, admiring it. He had this insane notion to put his hand next to Potter’s callous one laid on the table by his plate. Not to touch – he couldn’t do that – but to be near. To feel his warmth.
“You did a marvelous job with that,” Draco said, because he didn’t know what else to do. Sarcasm was his only weapon, and Potter’s morose eyes were a mighty foe. “I’m all helped now, thanks.”
won’t let him die, anyway, even if He wasn’t currently here. Left alone in the living room, which wasn’t His living room but was close enough, Draco would soon pass out with the way he was losing blood so magnanimously. It will be a blessing, really. The pain – while very precious to Draco – was becoming a little hard to bear. He would welcome a nice respite.
“What, so because you were a murderous traitor, it’s okay that I used a bloody Unforgiveable on you? No, that’s not the way it works. That’s not the way
“So,” Harry said heavily, and Draco tried to listen. He was nauseated and under a considerable amount of pain, as the Healers blatantly refused to give him another dose before nightfall. “I guess there’s good news and bad news.”
expression. Trying not to collapse with exhaustion mid-plea Draco half-whispered, half-cried: “Please, Harry, please…”
“Malfoy,” Hermione started, then paused with a pensive look. “No, you’re right. He can’t walk in there wearing that.”
He shut his eyes immediately, trying very hard to calm down the hysterical beating of his heart. He just didn’t have the courage to look and see who was there. If it was his father, then – then – Draco really didn’t know what then. The possibility was just too awful. When a few minutes passed and no one addressed him, no one cursed or shouted or touched him, Draco began to be able to use his other apparently existing senses. Eyes shut, it was his hearing again which took charge; Draco thought he could distinguish the shuffling of paper. Someone was reading, perhaps? Writing a letter? Beyond that there was the clinking of glass instrument and – was that a soft humming sound, coming from a distance? At that Draco had to open his eyes. No Death Eater who respected himself would be caught humming.
“Gods, Potter, learn to take a bloody joke,” Malfoy rolled his eyes at him. “I know all you goody-goodies are as boring as hell, but my, I didn’t think it was that bad.”
Harry drew a deep breath. He couldn’t refuse Draco if he tried. “Fine. If you’re sure. What do you want to talk about, then?”
“No problem, Malfoy.” The silence was heavy and a little sticky after that. She sighed. “Well, seems like we should be getting on our way. Ron, did you find them on the map?”
“Harry,” Draco croaked, because even if it was just a dream, it was his Harry. He will not miss this opportunity, even if it hurt like hell to speak, even if this was all he could say.
“Oh, damn you, Potter, you and your questions and your options and your fucking free will.” Malfoy looked brittle, like he might fall and break into a million pieces. “She wants to run away,” he added in a shaky voice, finally coming to a halt. “She wants to run away, and we need to fucking help her, Potter. We need Dumbledore.”
The shrug was not very convincing. “Here and there. Twice a week, actually. I felt it was a little more necessary than normally.”
He was laughing now, the bastard, the handsome bastard, properly hands-on-his-belly, roaring with glee. “I just think,” he said between wiping his eyes and heaving, “that for someone trying to stay hidden, to call his shop something like that – “
“Unfortunately, it ain't me who decides these things.” Greyback shrugged and let go of Malfoy. Although he was now out of his clutches, the level of fear on his face only increased.
Lucius looked so sad, Draco actually stopped. “I have been a coward, I’m afraid. But Draco, you were so strong, so brave. I never had the chance to tell you how proud I was of you.” He paused for a second, giving this statement its proper weight, and Draco felt it drop on him like an anvil. “Draco, I am so sorry.”
“Oh, er, I’ve been there before. Been to most parts of the castle, to be honest.” His cheeks were already beginning to flush, and he prayed Malfoy wouldn’t ask more about it. The time he went in the Slytherin common room had, after all, everything to do with him. But Malfoy seemed pacified and didn’t push on.
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath before replying. He didn't want to be rude to her, but now was really not the time for any distractions. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Malfoy, but… it didn’t seem like there's much you can get away with in that castle. Not with Bellatrix and your husband there, anyway.”
Normally, on Saturdays Draco would bring back the earnings of that week and He would do the books. Now that Draco was alone, was he meant to do it himself? That seemed preposterous. Draco knew nothing about money and book-keeping and taxes. He wouldn’t have the first clue what to do with it all. Last night he left the bag of money in the safe at the shop, sure he’d be unable to get it right on his own. But was he meant to try? Gods, this was exhausting. Having to think for himself was something Draco hardly even recognized anymore. He wanted to be told what to do, and to sweep all those uncomfortable thoughts way under the rug where he couldn't reach them. Like he can’t reach the bleach. Oh, this was just getting worse by the minute. He jumped to his feet before he could think a thing more and threw himself in the shower.
Harry could see in the black eyes that Snape was fighting hard to find an acceptable answer, an excuse, but failed. He gave Draco a measured look. Harry rushed to his aid without really thinking about it. “That’s all right, Professor. We’ll all go together. We can get to the bottom of this.” He had very little faith he could convince the Death Eaters that he somehow set the alarm off accidentally. However, at this stage, there was really nothing else to be done. They had less than twenty minutes before they would all go back to looking like themselves, and by then it will be too late. He did a little mental check-list as he followed Ron and Snape to the hall and down the stairs after the rushing figure of the tall lady. They have to find Hermione and Draco, somehow hide the fact there are two Draco Malfoys currently in the castle, get Narcissa, and get out… second by second their mission seemed more impossible. He hoped Dobby was still in there as they were marched off back into the drawing room and into god-knows-what else.
. He turned out to be fucking strong. He had so much now, so much he thought he'd lost forever: his old anger, not only his emaciated, now-anger. His old pity. And his old pride. Or perhaps not exactly, it wasn’t the same, not even close, but it was pride nevertheless. And even the thought that he had something to be proud of – and look, just look at all the things he did, look at all those stupid, remarkable achievements – it was already something, far more than he ever expected to have. It was something. It really, really was. Draco had done so much, had succeeded to do so many silly little meaningless things, a fantastical amount more than he ever imagined. He'd been pleasant, and strong, and brave. He was brave. Which meant he could be brave.
“Draco, I… thank you so much for doing this, all of it. Trying to cook for me… wanting to celebrate… opening up like that. I kind of forgot to be excited about buying the house with everything that's been going on, I don't know, a lot of stress in the office and - but you made me remember. You made me excited again, you always do. You – you make me so happy.”
Draco hesitated. “It feels… like I know you. Like we’ve met before, you know? Or like it was written in the stars, I — can’t explain — sorry, I must sound like a complete lunatic. How is it you always smell like flowers?”
“It’s…” but he had no words, none whatsoever. It felt incredibly familiar to be standing here, even with Harry, to be standing here and have his stomach roil with panic and his breath short in his chest. Even with the coat of dust over everything, even though it was clear no living soul had set foot in here for months, it was still incredibly familiar. This had been Draco’s home for such a long time.
“Oh, we should, should we?” Ron’s smirk turned into a scowl. “Why’s that, Malfoy? What are you planning to do?”
“You’re the bloody problem,” Draco scolded. “It’s not out there, Potter, it’s inside your head. You need to learn to let it go. Gods know I’ve had to do that. It’s not easy, but… it’s possible.”
The door opened and spared him having to think about it anymore. A small but incessant string of customers walked in and out, and he found himself desperate to occupy his burning mind with
He stared at his father uncomfortably. Lucius was so thin, nearly as thin as Draco, and in the brighter light provided by the fire he seemed even worse. Haunted, maybe. There was a darkness in his eyes Draco had never seen before. He cleared his throat. “So… how have you been, Father?”
The secret compartment opened easily to his touch, which stopped his furious rant instantly. Could… was it possible that He planned it? That He wanted Draco to do this? Taking a deep breath, Draco shook his head. No, this wasn’t it. It was just how He never expected Draco to be able to do anything, was so confident that He fucking broke him. Well, he’s not broken. He’s standing right here and he’s not broken. Or he is, but he’s picking up the pieces. He’s broken, but it doesn’t fucking matter anymore.
Draco should have argued some more, but he was tired, and it was such a comfort to have a living, breathing entity nearby that actually saw him. If anything he was closer to begging him to stay.
Two things happened at the same time. The first was Harry, broken out of his stupor with a heave: “God, all right, all right, stop! Just don’t hurt him!” And the second, a figure emerged out of fucking nowhere and headed directly towards them. Whoever it was simply materialized from thin air – Harry’s cloak, of course, they took it. He saw the motion from the corner of his eye, not fazed in the least since
“Why don’t I make you a coffee?” Draco asked, just as miserable. He longed for Harry to be there, wished for it with all of his heart, but this was not what he wanted. He didn’t want to be scared. He didn’t want to think Harry’s presence could make him
“What? Oh, er, no, not really.” Harry heaved himself upwards with a grunt. “Are you alright? You look tired.”
… but the voice was tiny and it was nothing against the sea of rage, of hurt, of “You think I need you for that? Why don’t you go and solve your fucking murders and save the bloody world again and be the fucking hero?”
It was – but how? And what? And how? And – he looked up, but that wasn’t where he was going to find Harry, because the stupid man was
He was about to argue, but Ron was quicker. “I’ll go with Malfoy. Hermione, you go with Harry, and you both wear the cloak. We should meet back at the drawing room in forty minutes – we won’t have much time of the potion remaining after that.”
His fighting techniques sure were non-conventional, but after some movements (far too quick and blurry for Draco to comprehend) the former Death-Eater was down, and Harry ran back to Draco, panting. “Are you okay?”
“Oh.” If he hit him, Harry would have probably looked less miserable. “All right. Do you, erm, want to go back, or…?”
They haven’t spoken about the kiss or anything like it since Weasley’s first visit, because even Draco had some limits. True that Weasley rattled on about a ‘mystery man’ Potter had romantic feelings for, but it was quite apparent from Potter’s behavior that he thought nothing of the sort about
Maybe not perfect, maybe not even good, there’s a lot of work still to do, I know you struggle with a lot of it, but – you are okay. Aren’t you?”
“All right. Fine. But you may never play the saint card with me again, Potter. Now I know what you really are, so you can get off your high horse.” He took a deep breath. “I like you, you wanker.”
was what it meant to be purely, totally, completely hysterical. He wanted to scream the words, but instead he sort of whispered: “He was… David… he left me butterflies. And I – I spoke to him, I said – damn it, I thanked him. I wasn’t meant to, Harry. I wasn’t meant to talk to anyone. And then, the ladies, I told them – I told them I could… they wanted to fix me up with… Harry, he killed them because of me, he killed all of them
There was a short pause in which Draco’s blood thumped so hard in his ears, he wasn’t sure he didn’t miss the reply. But then a nod supplied him the approval he needed, and almost fleeing to the bedroom he threw on the heaviest clothes he had and returned to the living room some five minutes later, clad in enough layers to get him through the winter if he lived in the midst of an icy river.
him – the fucking gall. Draco was horrified with himself. It was just that after he saw so much of him that night, Draco didn’t think he’d be able to touch him. It was how all this knowing and
“I want you to be happy. I want you to continue to heal. I want… the opportunity to be next to you, to see you do that. And, I mean, if I get to kiss you, that’d be great too.”
“Nothing, it’s just that… I’m so pathetic,” Draco whispered, unable to look at him. “I’m such a miserable pile of… that you felt you had to do this for me.”
The tension in Potter’s voice suggested he meant it the way Draco took it to be – referring to their awful, awful row on Friday – and the knot in his stomach tightened. Merlin, no chance he could face
“You have some nerve, but it won’t help you. You will pay for it, same as you always do. On your knees, where you belong.“
“I – but – “ nope, he had nothing. What were they trying to do here, what sort of game were they playing? What they said made no sense. He didn’t do Harry any
He wasn’t going to be able to last much longer, he knew, losing himself completely in the utter pleasure. Malfoy was feeling it, perhaps, as he was bobbing his head up and down faster, his hand supporting the base moving at the same speed. “I’m going to… Malfoy, I’m going to come…” he didn’t seem to have heard him, or maybe he did, for there seemed to be something almost ferocious in the way he tightened his hold on him. Then he sucked again, letting his tongue swivel around the tip, and Harry came in a scream as the world dissolved into fuzzy black spots.
There was nothing he hated to do more than beg, and it was almost uncanny how often he had to do it in the past year. Sometimes it seemed like he did nothing other than beg all year long with Harry. “Please,” he said again, lowering his glance to her feet, unable to look at her anymore. “Do this for me. Please.”
– and then there Potter was, wet, yes, gods help him. Wet and Draco could trace every single line of his upper body, right to his bare collarbone where his shirt was unbuttoned, and just – hell. Draco opened his mouth to gain Potter’s attention. This was it now, moment of truth. Then, all of a sudden, he forgot what he wanted to say.
. That chest – with its dark, thick hair that continued in a line down to his navel, then down to the top of his trousers – that chest was
To say that Draco seemed cheered up would not be exactly honest. It looked more like he was pulled back from the depth of the ocean, spat out a bucketful of seawater, and the light of life was reignited in his previously dead eyes. He took very shallow, very quick breaths, panting even as they marched up the stairs. There was a bit of a feverish, hectic look to his face that made Harry grow increasingly worried. He preferred it, of course, to the languid and broken Draco from yesterday; still, it wasn’t altogether reassuring to see him this way.
Draco swallowed hard. Harry’s happiness was only a little easier to bear than his misery, and he still didn’t know which one was more justified. There was so much uncertainty, so much he had to know. He waited a little until Harry’s shoulders stopped shaking, and forced himself to ask. “Harry – is He really dead?”
“Yes, it’s the only toy I have that doesn’t move or talk or fly or jump or spit flames or do anything, I have so many dragon toys now! but that one is my favorite, I called it Draco, after you, because you’re my cousin, Draco.” His sentences were all jumbled into each other, and it was only at a stretch that Draco could understand.
“No, it’s not – “ Harry’s persistent eyes on him forced Draco to think about it. “I just… I wish it for you, too. I really do wish it.”
“We have to think of a plan,” Harry said, and he was just unable to look at her. “We have to find a way – maybe they don’t know it’s not me yet, maybe Voldemort isn’t there still – “
“I wanted to… thank you… for today…” his own voice sounded raspy and uneven. Draco withdrew into himself on the sofa, mortified. The silence was longer this time, and with every passing second he could feel himself growing more and more hysterical. What kind of unbelievable nonsense was this? Bringing Him
There was a lot he’d get rid of, actually. Most if not all of his memories were now tainted. The snotty little brat he was and the happy childhood Draco was rather sure he had were submerged under so much fucking darkness, they were impossible to retrieve. The things that remained were bad enough to make him scream: Death Eaters filling the Manor halls and the Dark Lord beckoning him to come; Azkaban – enough said; the rickety and uncertain relationship with Him, which was grounding and absolutely necessary and still in some ways worse than the rest of it. So much hate and fear and wrong, it was baffling. Maybe He was right; if Draco could choose, he would remove so much of himself that he’d have nothing left. There was only one sliver of light in the whole of the last decade, and it was too painful to think of, for it too was so very lost to him. He lost it himself, actually. Being a stupid, worthless piece of garbage.
“That’s a good shout, but she meant for dinner. I for one am sick of hospital food. I thought I could get a takeaway for us all, Indian or something, if you felt like it?”
good at? Figures just as much. I was probably the worst cleaner in the Golden Horntail’s history, even if I do say so myself.”
, it almost didn’t feel scary at all. Draco found his tongue, always the brave one, sending out to meet Potter’s in excited little flicks. Suddenly he wanted to explore further; he ran it over Potter’s teeth, admiring their smooth texture; over Potter’s lips, so soft; up and down Potter’s tongue, asking, answering, feeling. And all the while Potter didn’t move his head, nothing but his tongue and his hands to even indicate he was still awake. His eyes were closed, and his face – whatever of it Draco could see – was deeply entranced. Draco sighed contentedly into Potter’s lips and fought back a smile.
Ron took a second to think about it. “I reckon she’s right. Dumbledore’s the only chance we have to get him out of there with all of us alive. And the clock is ticking…” he gave Harry a determined look. “We got to go now, mate.”
. “He didn’t make me join, I did it myself. It was a stupid mistake, the biggest of my life, but it was entirely my own. My father was away, and I wanted to prove to him – I wanted to show him I’m the man he wanted me to be.” His father’s face rose in his memory, gaunt and pale like that last time he saw him. Gods, no, not that. He couldn't be thinking about that. “Afterwards… yes, there was coercion, but still there was a choice. I could always run away, try to fight. I chose not to. I was a coward.”
Well, there was not much he could have done after that, was there? Harry jumped at him like he would at a raft at sea; Draco was the only solid thing in a world that sank and crashed around them. He held him so tight, it was possible the blond was not breathing. They stayed like this for the longest time, holding each other, shamelessly crying into each other’s arms like there was nothing to it at all, and perhaps there wasn’t. Harry wasn’t exactly content, but he was happy. All the rest they could solve later.
When “I sacrificed everything for you, Draco. Everything. I had to change my whole life, risk imprisonment, spend the remainder of my days on the run, but I did it for you. You killed Grove – you killed him, Draco, do you hear me? You killed a man. Things can no longer continue as they were before. But I’m here, I’ll always be here for you. I will protect you. I will keep you safe.” But –
“Just so you know,” she said conversantly, “if you ever disappear on me again, I’m going to personally murder you.”
“Are you sure?” Mother asked, and Draco forced himself to look at her. She didn’t seem angry, or hurt, or upset. She was down to business, same as always. He loved her for it. “There might be no way back from this, Draco. You have to be certain.”
It was all going exceptionally fine, even if a little precariously, for approximately five minutes. Potter’s hand rested on Draco’s hip, a little lower than he would have chosen, but still far away enough from real trouble. The wool in Potter’s jumper tickled his nostrils and Draco’s hair kept getting in his eyes, and everything was perfect. For five minutes Draco was unequivocally happy. He would have been more careful, should have been more careful, but something about this whole thing made him dumb with desire. The way Potter held him like it was a
“TALK?” Malfoy screamed suddenly from behind Ernie, and Harry shuddered at his tone. “Talk? Do you have any idea what you’ve done? Do you have any idea?” he seemed to have exhausted himself and crumbled into Neville, woebegone. The two boys let go of him, startled, and he hardly even raised his head.
There were more bright sides when it came to Draco. For example, he was now able to walk, even if only gingerly. There was also the fact that now he could be with Harry officially, and really, there was no way to hide their relationship from the rest of the school when Harry has been by his bedside for nearly a month. Harry was extremely happy not to have to keep it as a secret anymore, and took extra pleasure in haunting Crabbe and Goyle repeatedly. He would tell Draco little stories of how he pesters them here and there, and to that Draco would laugh – really laugh, like he did back then, before everything went to utter shite. Harry treasured those moments immensely, especially as they were so rare. His care for Draco, already of incredible proportions, kept growing. He thought that soon he will need to find another body in which to cram it all.
Potter pointed with his unengaged hand at the next hill, glowing in the sunlight. “This is the direction we’re heading. Feel like walking for a bit? I can summon us a couple of brooms if you prefer.”
“I know, Potter,” the blond sounded desperate. “I know they’re trying to help. They’re trying to help
“No games? Then what the hell was that kiss about?” Malfoy looked surprised, almost like he didn’t remember it happened. Then he curled his lips in distaste.
He was not aware of the door opening, nor of the person who walked in, but he instantly felt the magic. For a second he froze completely, unable to stir an inch, but then he realized they were not torture spells. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought they were healing him. and apparently he really didn’t know, because that was precisely what was happening. someone was casting healing spells on him. He could feel the effects so intensely, he passed out again; so far and wide was the reach of the magic, so deep inside him. when he woke up again he could breathe without feeling his larynx was aflame. Grateful and baffled beyond his senses, he opened his eyes.
He couldn’t even properly explain to himself why he cared so much, but he did. He practically burned with the will to persuade Malfoy, to change his mind. There was the slight chance he was using this as a crutch so as not to have to go and speak to Dumbledore, or think about his own fight with Voldemort. But it was more than that. Every time he spoke to Malfoy, whenever he seemed to get through to him somehow, he felt elated. It made him feel like he could do anything.
now, where he belonged, where he knew the world best, and it gave him some clarity. Like a sip of water to a man dying of thirst, he could feel the flames in his mind dying down, calming a little. He knew where he was, on his knees. This was something. At least he knew where he was.
The water came up fast, and now it was all the way to his chest and still kept rising. This was out of line – he could not bear it anymore; Harry was his salvation, his everything, he’d already given him so much, done so much for Draco. Him even considering it – considering not hating Lucius on his account – it was too much, and the fuckload of tons weighing Draco down would be the death of him. He had to give something back – he had to,
And still, he couldn’t help it. He was proud of him, the very boy who was ruined, the one who didn't want to exist, the one who thought he couldn’t handle it but did, who got out on the other side of this experience and lived. How did he do it? Now-Draco had no idea. It seemed impossible that anyone could survive that, let alone the years after it. This was only his third month in, and while nothing quite like it happened again, it was terrible enough to drown anybody. But he didn’t drown. He survived, and he got out, and he tried to live through it.
Draco nudged a little closer to her, so he’d feel her warmth, so he could try to convince himself this was really happening, and tried to fight the waves of fatigue. Silly dream or not, it would probably never be as good as it was right now. He wanted to savor it for as long as he possibly could.
Potter laughed. “I thought maybe I could cook for you tonight. You’ve been working very hard for the past two weeks, it’s about time I did my part.”
“Is anything the matter, Draco?” the voice came from the living room, but Draco was an icicle in human form and he could not reply. He stared at the can and all he could think was, stupidly,
“Well, I considered that too, but then… Why would you abandon your family, everyone that you know and love, and come live here as a Muggle? It made no sense. So I dug a little deeper.”
Then Greyback took a step towards him again, raising his blond head with one long-clawed finger under his chin. “Do remember this, Draco boy. Remember our Lord decided to show you mercy, this time. There's not going to be a next.” Malfoy nodded and shuddered at his touch. Sensing that, the werewolf bent low, and he too kissed either side of Malfoy’s stunned face. He held it for a second longer, a red ember glimmering in his eyes, then bent again and kissed him right on his frozen-shut lips. Malfoy’s eyes went wide with trepidation, and Harry felt every muscle in his body itch. He found himself seconds away from forgetting everything and simply jumping out in attack. Then Greyback released the boy, whose head fell back down immediately, and took Narcissa by the hand. Malfoy looked up just in time to see them disappear behind the trees. He opened his mouth as if to say something, but then shut it back up. He bent his head and looked at the ground for a long, long time.
“Okay,” Harry took a shaky breath. “It’s just – that’s a good thing, isn’t it? Your tone is sort of throwing me off there.”
“And the smell, too!” the lady he assumed to be Delilah pulled back her bright curls and sniffed a flower dry, each of her nostrils larger than a Galleon. “I’ve never smelled anything like it before!”
to him. What they reduced him into. He wanted to send out one terrible signal that would singlehandedly eradicate all forms of life on this planet. He wanted to kill… he wanted to hurt… he wanted to die.
“It was the only material I could find that would work. The bed is stripped, and I didn’t think you’d want duvet trousers. They’d be impossible to walk in.”
“They had to up their level all the time. After a while of the same I became numb, apathetic. And the point of it all was to see the look in my eyes, the shock... So it became worse and worse. There was the night when – I mean – there was – they had succeeded, eventually." The images were insistent, pressing hard against his eyelids, and it took all he had in him to refuse them. Not that night, he can't bear to think of it. Not of how they broke him. "At some point I began to see what they did in me, what they wanted me to be. An experiment. A toy. A mindless, worthless sack of shit.” His fists were getting wet; he dug his fingernails so hard into his flesh that he was drawing blood. He shook his head and the tears fell all over his jumper. “I was younger by decades than the others. I was well known. I was useless enough to actually be stunned by what they could do. Do you see? I was the perfect prize pig for them. And they took away with it to extremes I wouldn’t have thought possible if I hadn’t remembered them happening to my own self.”
“What is it, Harry?” Hermione asked, not raising her head from the parchment. “Are you feeling all right?”
But Harry did come back, so maybe believing him wasn’t stupid. And Draco helped him, too, when he needed someone to be there as he recovered. He
Right, that’s what they were. Magic dampening potions, of course. That’s why the cottage’s wards affected him less than they did the others, why it took so long to heal him. He nodded, a little choked, because now that he had it back, he felt like such an idiot for not recognizing the feeling of his
Processing the information took a while. “So the only time you were away from my bedside was – I thought you’d gone home! I thought you were resting!” he didn’t know why, but it sort of felt like betrayal. For Harry to spend the precious little time he had away from Draco on something he
“You said there weren’t any attacks now!” Draco protested. Potter said that several times the past week.
“You – when are we talking about, exactly?” Potter asked, his brows furrowing. They were already walking downstairs, and he was taking slow light steps in Draco’s careful pace. It was almost abominable how considerate he was.
“It was bad. I spent ages stuck in there, can’t even tell you how long. I think I repressed a lot of it, to be honest. But I remember – some things. Like how when the living room light was on I used to read, because there was a sliver of light that snuck in from underneath the door. They didn’t know, the Dursleys, but when they were awake, I could be also. And since my cousin took all the games, and cared none for the books – I could hide a couple of them at a time in the cupboard. No one would go in there, anyway. So I read.”
“All right, so maybe not forced, but… when he used Legilimency, did you – er – consent to that? Did you want it?”
“Father – wait – “ Lucius stopped with his hand on the handle and turned back. “There is something – something I have to tell you – about Potter – “
Harry was going to be sick. His mind was racing in horrible, painful little loops. “Shut up, Malfoy, shut up right now. You are not in any debt here, and I am not going to receive any... sexual favors from you, fucking hell. Why would you even say that? That’s disgusting. Honestly. Unbelievable.”
Another heavy noise, this time from outside the bathroom, suggested Harry was losing his mind. “Draco?
“I have no doubt,” Harry murmured, his lips now very close to Malfoy’s. He wanted to do this ever since last Thursday. Merin, he needed this. “You know, we never did celebrate your birthday.”
David was in again, and Draco felt gracious enough to acknowledge his existence. “You dyed your hair,” he told him, and Draco nodded. It was keen of him to observe, after all. “That’s a very unique color, Draco. I must say it looks amazing on you. Although I liked you in black, too…” Draco smiled sweetly at him. He thanked David – first time he ever actually spoke to him – and took the flowers from his hands, no more interested. A small concern pulsed in him – in his original hair-color, without the glamour, he was far more recognizable. But then again, He did it, and Draco could trust Him. Casting the thought aside he returned to the flowers, arranging them in beautiful arrays designed to catch the eye. There weren’t a lot of roses in today, but the smell of lavender tickled his nostrils and made him sneeze. He was more certain than ever he was really allergic to bloody flowers.
“What?” Draco tensed immediately. He tried to read Potter’s expression, but the paper covered half of it. “What is it?”
Draco didn’t answer immediately. Instead he gave Harry a long, searching look. “Do you trust me, then?” he asked in a tiny voice, still a little shaky. Harry had to think about that. He let out a long sigh.
