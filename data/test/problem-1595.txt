Harry reluctantly did as he was told. He was too tired to argue, and a shower might not be such a bad idea. He walked out of the shower fully dressed. There was no way he was going to let Malfoy see him naked.
His father’s scornful voice made Draco stop in the middle of the addition of the newest detail. He stopped talking and turned to look at him instead; he was vaguely aware that his previous conversation partner had started walking away.
Harry frowned, the confusion inside him growing. He liked having Draco around. They’d been going out for a few years now, and even though they hadn’t yet moved in together, they spent more nights in each other’s arms than apart. Usually at the Manor, but sometimes at Harry’s place. Draco made him forget, even if for a little while, that he was a complete loser. But now Draco was here out of pity, and that notion sunk in Harry’s chest like a particularly heavy ball of slime.
He saw the confused look on Potter’s face. Could almost see him refusing, breaking their deal and apparating away. It wasn’t like Potter owed him anything; Draco only offered to take over his paperwork at the office for the next month. He knew that this wasn’t really the make-or-break part of this little favour. He was mostly counting on his hero complex and his need to save everyone.
“I never said I didn’t want to.” Harry’s green eyes looked at him. A floating candle passed over them, its light catching on Harry’s glasses, making it look like his eyes were aflame. “I don’t know what you had in mind, but this feels like a hard liquor sort of evening, doesn’t it?” He held his hand out to Draco. “I know just the place.”
Lucius gave them one last glare, and then, with a whoosh of his dark dress robes, turned and walked away.
“We’re in love. And I think it’s better that you get used to the idea, and stop trying to set my fiancé up with witches. Wouldn’t that be nice, love?”
“No, Potter. I couldn’t.” Apart from being expected to have at least an escort, especially at his beyond-than-marriageable age, he was also aware that had he gone alone, single distant female cousins would be offered to him. Going alone was not an option. “I said I owed you one, alright? How about we just leave it at that?”
And he didn't even
It certainly did not help that he’d been feeling this way for a while. He was usually alright; functioning, at least, to a degree. He was able to mostly keep his place clean, with the help of Kreacher, and he had beers and simple foods in his fridge most of the time. He didn’t have a job. Still hadn’t managed to figure out what he wanted to do as an adult wizard.
Why did this thought make him feel like someone was trying to
Harry paused his work as an idea formed in his mind. Kreacher wasn't the
. The loathing in Lucius’ eyes told him the same story. It hurt more than he thought it would, after everything Lucius had put him through. He ruined his life; in more than one way. He didn’t
“Teddy-”
"I'm in need of a new rosary."
"Nah, she and I just weren't a good match anymore after the war."
," he muttered, hand outstretched to receive his Arithmancy textbook.
"What?" Harry asked in alarm.
“G’night, Teddy. I’ove ‘ou so much,” Draco slurs. Hopefully Teddy gets the gist.
Tom barks out a laugh. “It really ain’t. But it’ll be worth it in the end, you’ll see.”
"Besides," Ron interjected around a mouthful of sausage, "it's not like it's weird for students to pick at each other in the corridors. Remember when Malfoy made me burp up slugs for a whole day?"
Damn.
At that, the old witch openly laughs. “Oh, Mr. Malfoy.” She waves a dismissive hand. “You go on now. I can see you don’t like it, but stay away unless Mr. Potter asks for your assistance. You might be surprised later.”
So exhausted after work, the park, fighting dinner, and struggling through the tantrums that littered Teddy’s bedtime routine that evening, Harry finds himself already mostly asleep with the light on when Draco Apparates at the foot of the couch several hours later. Likely believing Harry to be asleep, Draco snuffs out the single light in the room before making his way elsewhere.
“You don’t want to wake Draco.”
Draco and Harry drop onto the couch at the same moment, at opposite ends. The cushions expel a fresh plume that reeks of Harry, his essence that has seeped into the very body of the couch, dousing them all. Draco draws Teddy into his lap.
Draco rakes his nails over his skull, vibrating with a barely-suppressed wrath, broiled passion making him feel weak in his own skin. If Potter is going to be like that...
"I don't think you need looking after," he said. He saw Malfoy stiffen slightly but otherwise continue as though Harry hadn't spoken. "In truth, it's because I
The Care-Seekers raise their brows and glance at one another.
“If I did, ‘t’s the poin’ o’ drinkin’?”
“Oh, er...well, the couch is my bed.”
Nodding and smiling, Harry didn't answer, instead choosing to lean down and press his lips to Draco's. It was chaste and gentle. Harry's hand came back to Draco's cheek, just as soft and sweet as he rubbed the skin there. Unexpected tears sprung up in Draco's closed eyes. There was so much emotion in everything Harry was doing, so much that Draco could feel pouring into him at their points of contact. A whimper slipped out of his throat, causing Harry to break the kiss, eyes concerned.
Face hotter than the unrelenting sun above him, Harry stands with Teddy and leaves. The looks are like physical, unwanted caresses on his back. The sea of mourners is in the largest opening of the grounds, closest to a side courtyard of the castle that Harry remembers entering somewhere just south of the kitchens. Just as he breaks free of the final rows of chairs, a camera clicks, and the gawking spell is lifted. Sounding as though nothing interrupted at all, the speaker continues amid the rising camera clicks that are documenting the scene Harry Potter and his godson just made.
“And if he is granted guardianship?”
"I expected as much."
It wasn't until they had entered the village and the shops lining the cobbled street blocked some of the wind that Harry spotted him. Malfoy was just as bundled as everyone else, a dark wooly hat pulled over his blond hair. It was only chance that Harry spotted his profile as Malfoy tucked into a bookshop.
"I'm serious."
Too far on the ledge.
Potter led Draco to an empty classroom a couple corridors away, closing the door after waiting a couple seconds too long for Draco to enter. With a deep breath, Draco removed the cloak. Potter's eyes shot over to him as Draco emerged and handed over the cloak. Potter tucked it into his bag with a small smile.
the off-site office, Draco takes a deep breath of fresh air to steady himself. Mondays are definitely his least favorite day of the week. But at least it’s finished. It’s not quite dinner time, though, leaving Draco with plenty of downtime before it’s a reasonable enough hour to call the day through.
“Well, right now, Harry is solely responsible for any financial needs Teddy requires.” Mr. Cook sits back in his chair. “This includes annual check ups with a Pediatric Healer, toiletry items, food, clothes, future education costs, any emergency services that come up, and so forth. That is all on Harry as the sole legal guardian. As you are legally, technically being regarded as a childcare entity of sorts, Mr. Malfoy, this document is requiring you to provide what any other such service would: should the need arise and Harry does not provide items you need for Teddy while he’s in your care, you are responsible to provide them, and Harry is bound to reimburse any amounts spent outside 25% of any given cost. This section here-” Sitting forward, he points. “-gives the specifics of this 25%.”
Harry eases the door closed again. He tiptoes himself back to the couch, yanks the covers over him like a child scared of what the shadows might bring, of what his own memories might dredge from the past. There’s a lot about Malfoy that is predictable; sobbing alone in the middle of the night after arguing with Harry is not on the list of expecteds. And against everything in him that screams not to care, Harry finds himself listening too intently to the indistinct sounds of upset for a long time before being able to fall back asleep.
Without thinking on it, Harry grabbed Malfoy's hands. They were shaking. Harry pulled the hands closer and gently pried Malfoy's right hand away. Blood lined the palm.
“Kids do, you know.”
"What d'you mean, 'even if'?" Ron asked. "There's no way he's changed after all that Death Eater business."
"Now, we may be a few short of our count before all last year's nastiness," Professor Slughorn continued, pulling uncomfortably at his tie. "But Mr. Martinez here had decided to join us after a chat with our new headmistress, and I am pleased to say that he is up to the task of making up for lost time!"
“Yes.”
Madam Pomfrey sighed as she looked down on him. "Oh, dear. I just don't feel right, letting you leave on your own. Especially considering the circumstance of your injuries. I had really hoped-"
“Good afternoon, Mr. Malfoy,” she greets.
“Like the tip of a wand. Tiny. Not even real flames.”
"But...then why is he acting like this?" Harry asked, turning to see Draco. Ron seemed to have taken on Harry's role, chopping and slicing and skinning while Draco tended to the potion. They weren't talking, but Draco looked far more comfortable with Ron than he had with Harry the day before. It made Harry's chest tighten painfully. "Why is he acting like pushing me away is going to make that article not exist?"
“You’re supposed to be sleeping in your own bed all night, Teddy,” Draco says, returning his attention to the stove to tend to the sausages. “You’re getting to be a big boy, you know. You have to learn to sleep on your own like...like Harry and I do.”
Harry's eyes shot over to Ron, who was pointedly glaring at his textbook with his eyes not moving.
"Malfoy?"
Guilt burned his insides, snaking through his veins like an untamed fire. After he had been made to return to the world of the living from his days-stay in Percy's bedroom, Harry had immediately sought out Ginny. He had held it in his heart throughout the past year that those brown eyes, those freckles, those soft hands, those flowing red locks, that laugh, and that smile were all he wanted once the torment of war was over. But the moment he saw her, sitting in the living area reading a book, Harry knew. He knew at immediately that he could never love Ginny the way he once thought he could. But he had pressed on, making his way to her and speaking quietly, wanting to push that feeling away.
Draco smoothed out the letter on his desk, smiling at the signature despite his shaking certainty that returning the sentiment wasn't the best idea. He hadn't exactly expected a letter from Harry while on holiday, suspecting that he would be too busy with the Weasley family to think much of Draco. But Harry had once again surprised Draco when a tiny, overexcited owl slammed noisily into his window the night previous.
But there’s no one at the door when Draco opens it. Instead, he sees a short man in black robes moving further down the hall, seeming to attach something to the doors he passes with identical knocks, never hovering long enough to suggest he actually wishes to speak with the tenants of the building. Bemused, Draco checks the front side of his door. A thick leaflet is lightly stuck there with some sort of manual adhesive.
Luna nodded. "That is a large part of it."
Jaw locking, teeth grinding loud enough for Harry to hear, Malfoy holds the furious gaze. It’s defiant but conflicted, ended when Draco lets out a defeated sigh, averting his eyes.
"Well, obviously we had to make sure that the building was fixed up, seeing a how the inmate will have their faculties about them without the dementors around." Mr. Weasley shuttered slightly. "Too, the Auror Department had to do an entire training and shift more than half their staff to maintain the place. I think a long-term solution is in the works now for an entirely new sub-department, but that's easily a year or more away from being absolute. They're worried for the safety of the prisoners in the meantime, though."
"What do you mean?"
Teddy is thrilled at having just a jam sandwich, usually a snack food, for dinner. And while Draco is calm as he eats, Harry just stares at the clock.
There was an uncomfortable pause as Harry tried to push aside the images stirring in his mind at the memory. Malfoy looked as though he had swallowed something foul.
Instead, he sneers, “You look dead on your feet. Your place is a mess. You’re obviously struggling. How’s all that Chosen One bravado working for you in parenthood?”
“Just fuck off, Malfoy,” Potty snarls abruptly. It’s as if he’s just noticed that Draco’s really moved forward, how close they’ve really become, still several feet between them but entirely too few, and Potter pointedly turns away.
There was only a whimper in reply and then they were both coming together, absolute ecstasy blinding them in the dark room. Hot semen erupted from them both, smothering their hands and covering Draco's stomach as fireworks exploded in Harry's vision.
It was true, the ropes knotted well but with far too much slack, making it easy for Draco to pull them off in a matter of seconds. The boy raised his wand and pointed right at Draco's forehead.
Luna smiled. "It won't do to be angry with Harry, Draco. He's just that way. Besides, if you truly want, I can leave you be and report the attacks myself. I hadn't already only because I made the unfortunate assumption that you were handling it."
"Really? How'd she take it?"
“Coddling him? I’m being affectionate. You ought to try it sometime.”
"Alright, as seventh years, you'll be facing your N.E.W.T. exams at the end of this year. Covered on those exams is a wide array of plantlife that we've studied since day one here at Hogwarts. We will be doing some reviewing of those creatures we saw in years one through six, but ultimately the detail of that review is on you and on your own time. My job this year is to make sure that you are well versed in more advanced plant forms rather than making sure you've been listening the past six years."
"Well now that shirt's just ruined," Draco said, still breathless as Harry wadded the fabric into a tight ball and dropped it onto the floor.
He shakes himself. “It really wouldn’t hurt you to be more affectionate with Teddy, you know.”
"I'd curse your stupid face, but it looks like someone beat me to the punch if you get my drift." He smirked at his own joke, wand tip stabbing the bruised flesh around Draco's eye. Draco flinched. "Yeah, that hurt? Good."
"Well, no one wrote a How To Do A Gay Proposal guide," Draco said with an eye roll. "So I'm making it up as I go."
“I am not going to destroy what little credit I’ve managed to earn for myself on your sickle, Potter. You can just move into this flat and manage until then.”
"Nah, it was mostly her," Weasley said. "She's been nagging at me to apologize since Saturday at the pub but I've been too damn embarrassed to actually do it. Feel ready now, though."
Pure bliss.
"Why," he growled into Draco's mouth, "are you in so many layers?"
“Wed cuh-cul.”
“That’ll be the Care-Seekers,” Harry murmurs. He stands, moves to answer the door.
"I swear, Harry, if you make me beg-"
“You were
"He needs the hospital wing right away, Harry."
Madam Pomfrey looked as though she would have liked to say something, but she sighed after a moment and seemed to choose a different route. "Well, either way. The headmistress has handled the students responsible and made an announcement to the student body to deter any further situations like this in the future."
Harry's committee had been given only around twenty cases of students that claimed to have acted only out of fear for their own lives or the lives of their families, and it had been up to the committee to decide if they believed them or not.
“Just leave him alone. He’ll come out of it on his own in a few minutes.”
"Have you been able to talk to him?" Harry asked. His voice dipped into some of his just barely quelled desperation, but Luna didn't seem bothered as she nodded.
Potter was crouched down in front of him, hands on Draco's arms and eyes looking more alarmed than Draco could ever recall them being. Very suddenly, Draco found his shaking doubling as he gasped again for air in the silence between them.
But Draco didn't want to hear whatever it was Potter had to say. Draco had done enough.
Chest leaning over.
But the voice seemed to understand. "You're in the hospital wing. I don't know if you remember, Madam Pomfrey said you might not, but...you were attacked. You're skull's all messed up from a badly performed spell."
Nothing.
The hospital wing door opened just then, and Madam Pomfrey turned to see who had entered. Draco peered around her.
"I most certainly am." Draco's grin faded slightly. "How...how did you end up his godfather?"
Potter groans, head falling back. After a few moments, he looks up again with a fresh glare. “Okay, fine. You can watch him Monday. Fleur and Ms. Weasley are busy anyway.”
Shrugging, Draco pulls a book from the topmost shelf and heads for his room. “Now you can quit your whining and take Teddy out for all the socialization you think a child could possibly need.” Tossing a quirked brow over his shoulder, he adds, “Maybe it’ll help you, too, Mr. Cupboard Under the Stairs.”
“No, zis is just leetle children, yes?”
death; he choked about how
"You know, Draco," she said, coming to a stop at the top of the stairs that led to the basements and dungeons. "Because hate is learned, it can also be unlearned. Sometimes, I think people forget, or don't know, that." She rested a hand on his arm. The burns beneath the fabric stung, but Draco didn't flinch away. "Times change, and you are not as alone as you might think."
With a last glare at Josh, Hermione stepped over and crouched down beside Harry. Her mouth fell open at Malfoy's face. Every bit of skin from his scalp to the base of his neck was covered in a deep purple and black bruise.
"I thought I heard you stirring," she said as she drew closer. She produced her wand and ran the tip gently over Draco's head, inspecting him. "You were incredibly lucky, Mr. Malfoy, incredibly lucky. Mr. Gregory either hasn't yet mastered that particular spell or his heart wasn't in it, but either way, the spell wasn't as strong as it ought to have been. Even the Minor Explosion Spell should have shattered your skull and sliced apart your brain, but it seems to have only caused you an incredibly severe concussion."
Malfoy closed his eyes as he turned away, and Harry let him go. "I know you are," he whispered.
"I, er, found you asleep at the top of the Astronomy Tower," Potter said. "I couldn't just leave you there."
And he took to the stairs and fled to the grounds.
Harry chuckles softly. “I doubt Draco wants to join us on the couch, Teddy.”
Draco was so incredibly comfortable and warm. He couldn't remember ever being so relaxed, so at peace. It had been years since he could recall waking up like this. He pressed his body more into the pillow he was cuddling, breathing in an achingly comforting smell that he was vaguely aware didn't normally belong to his pillow. Nor did his pillow usually move in time with his own breathing. Or have an arm that rested on his back. Draco began to pull himself out of sleep as he started to realize that the noises around him were unfamiliar. He had his own room. Why were there sounds of movement next to the bed?
Morning light tickled at the edge of Draco's consciousness, poking its way into his closed eyes and causing him to stir. He groaned inwardly at the slumber in his body that tried to fight his waking, finally cracking open an eye. Red surrounded him, a harsh change from the usual bottle green that met him in the mornings, and a mop of wild black hair sat at his shoulder, its owner breathing into his neck.
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but it was then that the bell rang.
"Most, yeah. Headquarters was at Sirius' old house. My godfather," he clarified at the mild confusion on Draco's face. "So I was able to see most of the Order there. But once Lupin and Tonks had Teddy, he found me back at the old house and asked me to be godfather. Downright terrifying at the time."
Smiling sadly as he made his way to his bed, Harry wasn't entirely sure if he believed her.
"Not the point," Hermione said through clenched teeth.
“Malfoy?” Ms. Dribble asks sharply, popping just her head back into the living room. “What’s this about a Malfoy?”
Malfoy avoided Harry for the better part of a week, which Harry had to admit was just downright impressive after the third day. When lessons ended on Friday, Harry dumped his things off in Gryffindor Tower and planned to hunt Malfoy down, but Hermione grabbed him by the arm when he made to break away from the group heading down to the Great Hall for dinner.
It was her glare, as though she had some right to dictate his emotions, that irritated Harry the most.
“Do you three planning on moving to a larger flat at that time?”
"Oh, yes."
"I wish you weren't suffering for your father's mistakes."
Draco fought the urge to run away from her. She of all people should hate him. Yet she walked alongside him, calmly speaking as though he wasn't the absolute scum of the earth that he was.
“Impressed, Mr. Potter.” For the first time since Harry has met her, Ms. Dribble is smiling. “That takes a lot of maturity, to not only recognize what would be best for a child, but to make it a reality even if it affects your pride.”
Draco chooses not to answer immediately, opting to watch Teddy wander over to the little play area before rolling his eyes back to the bullshit at hand. “How dense you must truly be. According to the owl I received last night,
"Oh." Harry relaxed. "Yes, I suppose so."
Or maybe not.
But it wasn't just the flesh and blood Potter that Draco found himself avoiding. After fleeing that empty classroom to the safety of the grounds, Draco had found himself assaulted with the too-fresh memories of Potter's hands on him, his legs wound in his, his smell washing over him. It had nearly sent Draco into another panic but, almost more annoying, thinking of Potter's eyes on him, that smile playing at his lips, had calmed him almost instantly.
“Is everything alright, dear?” Mrs. Weasley’s voice asks from the doorway.
Ron leaned over to waggle his eyebrows at Harry. "Missed you, too, mate."
"I've been fine," his mother replied, not quite meeting his eye. "I...I owled Andromeda, however. My...other sister."
Draco planted another kiss, then two, then three, all the while moving towards the head. It was painfully slow, and Harry's cock twitched involuntarily with anticipation when Draco's tongue swiped across the slit.
"Ha ha."
“I love you all the same.”
"How..." Harry ran a hand through his hair, forgetting that he was holding Luna's ridiculous feather until it slapped him in the face. "How could you possibly know all that? Did he tell you?"
He opens his eyes, not realizing he closed them at all. “Hm? What’s up, Teddy?”
Until Teddy bit him.
"That can't be true," Harry said after a moment. "You were the Slytherin's Seeker for six years, they can't just sack you for no reason."
"I...I appreciate the sentiment," Malfoy said. "Even if it is unjustified and foolhardy."
But Draco didn't care what Harry had to say. Draco had to do this, had to at least try.
"Well, I'm glad I found you." Hermione turned and walked alongside Harry down the corridor, much to his horror. He wasn't sure how he could shake her to relieve Draco, and he wasn't sure he wanted Draco to hear whatever Hermione might have to say about the previous day.
Ms. Dribble frowns, regarding Draco from behind her thick glasses with furrowed brows. “Is there something on your mind, Mr. Malfoy? You are not a dim man. You know that Mr. Potter is Teddy’s guardian now.”
“WANNA STAY! NO!”
Teddy tilts his head. “Here?”
“Nooo, Ha-wee, no,” Teddy whines. “No hungee.”
completely thick, especially when it comes to Malfoy. I'm not saying it's fair," she said, throwing up a hand to stop Harry's forming retort. "But it's the way it is, at least for right now, and you're the Chosen One, the wizard that killed Voldemort. You're going to be famous for the rest of your life, Harry, and people are going to be watching your every move."
"Six...seven...eight...nine...ten."
“It just means that I appreciate the food,” Harry says as he takes another bite. “It really is good, you know.”
“Well, I’ve reminded him and taken him to the toilet directly every half hour all day, but after the first few times, he began running from me and turning it into this mad game-”
Draco sighed. "Nevermind."
Draco stood and made his way with the others. Granger stood beside him and smiled up at him.
“We’re supposed to lead him toward independence.”
A warm hand grabs his upper arm and gently tugs. But Draco is too sleepy, only shifts in the cushions with no desire to move now that he’s apparently home. There’s a soft groan, then an entire arm wraps around his waist. He’s being hauled to his feet, where he sways like a rotting tree in a storm. With great effort, Draco opens his eyes.
"Fucking hell," Draco groaned after a minute of this, thrusting his tongue into Harry's mouth.
"Except the whole Slytherin House."
"Mr. Malfoy?"
"But of course. Miss Granger?"
"How has returning to Hogwarts been?"
"You don't have to run from us, you know."
Harry groans. The last thing he needs is to deal with an unexpected guest before putting on a show of maturity for the Care-Seekers. Too, it’s going to take time away from his few minutes to relax. Sometimes it really feels as though he can never really win.
He hadn’t bothered updating the Ministry about his change of schedule ever since he was sent home “for his own safety” following a few “incidents”. What was the point in going to sleep and waking up early if he had nowhere to go? It got even worse when, somehow, his address was leaked to the media. That resulted in several house changes, and, eventually, in Harry not leaving his home at all for fear that someone might spot him at the entrance. He couldn’t recall the last time he dared set foot outside of the house , he only
Harry’s mouth went dry. “I am
Harry ignored Parkinson, giving in to his smirk instead, and turned to season his sauce and cook his pasta. After that it didn’t take much longer for the dish to be ready, and a glance at the other side of the kitchen told him that Kreacher was done as well and was now plating his lasagna. Harry grabbed plates and poured the pasta into each, murmuring a spell to clean the edges before he walked over and placed them on the little tables Kreacher had conjured in the meanwhile.
“But that hardly means that - “
Harry wanted to kiss Ron for helping him out, because he could think of no excuses. Parkinson glared at Ron, then glared at Harry, and then crossed her arms over her chest. “Fine then, but doing all that’s not going to make your
“You are now spreading a rumour that you will marry Potter? Pretending to date him to spite me wasn’t bad enough? You had to go and thoroughly
Confused, mostly about how he felt about Draco’s surprise visit as his brain had already resolved to its miserable state, Harry closed the door behind him but remained standing next to it. As if keeping the option of bolting out readily available.
Draco’s jaw almost dropped; but at the same time, he felt the need to kiss Potter again, just as a reward for talking to his father in a way that Draco never had the courage to. The notion that Potter probably wouldn’t accept such an act as a
For a moment, Harry was speechless. Draco – always top-fashion, wouldn’t-be-caught-dead-in-anything-that-costs-less-than-fifty-galleons-and-wasn’t-tailored-to-his-exact-frame Draco – wore his
Eventually it died out. The reception hall was empty by then, everyone having moved on. Draco and Harry both found themselves trying to get enough air to calm their breathing, but eventually Draco felt it was safe enough for him to straighten up. Next to him, Harry did the same. He reached over to one of the floating trays and grabbed a few napkins, handing one to Draco and using the other one himself. Draco accepted it.
Or perhaps it was Draco’s own freedom that allowed him to see Potter for who he really was for the first time in his life. Just another young man, who’d been through more in his short life than all the people Draco knew
“Draco dear! No, I haven’t, actually,” her smile faltered as she glanced at Potter, but only briefly. “So good to see you,” she smiled at him. “Both of you.”
“Where’s your closet?”
I’m needed here.”
Confused, still in disbelief that Harry agreed with him, appreciative of the gesture and of the suggestion (Merlin, he
freedom, especially during the short time Lucius spent in Azkaban. No one had ever pointed it out to him. Most of his friends were always looking at the relationships in Draco’s family and assuming Draco could get away with anything, that his parents gave in to his every whim. But they only saw what Lucius wanted them to see. They didn’t see how buying Draco material possessions worked to further manipulate him. They didn’t see the subtle threats; the way Lucius was determined to control Draco. The way Lucius used him for his own advantage to the point where he was willing to sacrifice Draco’s life just to get back on the Dark Lord’s good side.
Not that Draco didn’t know it was true; but to hear his father say it out loud in a public setting gave it a whole new weight he wasn’t expecting.
“I fixed your problem. Come on, you have to change.” He paused, sneered. “Maybe take a shower first.”
Draco, on the other hand, glanced at his once, said he’d be caught dead before he put something that hideous on his body, and proceeded to enjoy (read: criticize and complain) the concert in the clothes he’d worn there. Harry wasn’t even sure if Draco kept his shirt somewhere. He hadn’t seen it since the night of the concert. Draco had probably burnt it, or let a house elf use it as a rag at the Malfoy Manor.
“It’s
Draco wasn’t sure how to react to that. He knew he should probably be offended, but he wasn’t. He’d lived his entire life being terrified of Lucius. He hadn’t realized that until becoming an adult and having at least
Did Potter hate Lucius enough to hold a grudge against him more than Draco did? Was
“You could’ve just gone alone.”
So he looked at her and smiled sheepishly. “I’m just cutting these nice, plump and firm mushrooms.”
Draco gave him a once-over, and the twitch at the side of his lips had told Harry that his disheveled state was noted and registered. Not that Harry would have thought otherwise.
– it ended. Harry –
and kept pushing her in his path. Draco was certain that Lucius had intended to do the same this evening, too. He was already used to that. But to go around and tell their extended family that he was about to get married… Desperate times require desperate measures, and it seemed that Lucius was desperate. Too bad that Draco was, too. “We were trying to keep that a secret for now, but if my father talks about it then I suppose there’s no need for us to hide anymore.”
“I know my father. That’s exactly what it means. I’ll be expecting an owl to bring me forms to sign tomorrow that I forfeit any claim I might have for the family’s fortune. Hell, maybe he’d force me to change my last name.”
Maybe having Malfoy around wouldn’t be so bad, after all.
in how horrible it was; but no such salesperson should’ve been able to come to his door.
Harry looked up from the shirt, noticing Draco’s extra-worried look. He probably thought he’d hurt Harry somehow, or that Harry was in one of those moods when he didn’t want to be touched.
, master Potter! It is against the rules!"
“No, I mean, I
, caused a cell memory of some sort, Draco brought his hand up to his mouth, moved his fingers over his lower lip, thoughtful. He could no longer taste Harry; but the memory of how his lips felt pressed against his remained, sharp as if they’d only just parted.
Draco gestured in the air. “This. What you’ve just done. My family drama was not your problem to handle, but you stood up for me. I…” he moved slightly on the spot, glancing around the room. There was a general drift towards one side of the venue. They were probably starting to serve the actual food, rather than the inedible snacks that were floating about during reception. Draco didn’t care. He didn’t feel hungry. He felt like if he even tried to eat something, he wouldn’t be able to keep it down. “I wouldn’t have had the courage to say those things to him without your help. And you didn’t have to do all that. I know he’s a little scary – “
“I’m here ain’t I? I was just curious – “
“No one else was available,” Draco lied off-handily. He wasn’t going to explain to Potter how he hand-picked him for the maximum annoyance level achievable. He also had no intention of opening up to him and telling him why it was crucial to get Lucius off his back. Potter wouldn’t understand, anyway. He didn’t grow up as a pureblood. He didn’t grow up with the notion that it was his duty to continue his family’s bloodline, an especially heavy burden as an only child. He wouldn’t understand the pressure of being expected to follow the rules, nor the importance of family honour. The rules that stated that aristocratic pureblood wixes were expected to marry other aristocratic pureblood wixes even if they did not like them, not even remotely. Even if they were related. Or, worse; of the wrong gender.
He scoffed, scowling as he was annoyed at himself. Feeling sorry for himself won’t get him anywhere. Getting drunk, however, would at least make it a little bit more bearable. He gulped the rest of his beer and then glared at the empty bottle in annoyance, more pissed at himself for not thinking ahead and having a few more laying around within arm’s length. He groaned and pushed himself up –
what you want.”
He moved his hand, intending to take it off of Potter’s head, to break the kiss. He would apparate away from the venue, from his father, maybe even from the wizarding world altogether; but the feeling of Potter’s lips parting rooted him to his place. Something strong and wet pressed against his mouth, and Draco parted his own lips, reacting automatically to the request.
He groaned in pain as his shoulder hit the floor.
about protesting – before Potter’s other hand was placed on his other side, making Draco face him. Draco only had the chance to catch a glimpse of the sparkle in Potter’s emerald eyes before they closed and his mouth was captured by Potter’s.
crossed his mind, stinging like a cutting curse.
. A disgrace to the Malfoy name.
Harry shrugged mentally and turned his eyes back to his beer. It was a Muggle brand. As much as he liked Butterbeer, somehow it wasn’t as strong – and it was too sweet for him at times. Times when he was overcome by his ongoing depression. Like tonight.

"Harry, are you okay there? You could use magic you know," Ron sounded genuinely worried.
He probably should’ve bothered with a
Harry felt his face turn red in shame.
Draco stared at Harry. “Fix what? That my father is a bigoted, homophobic asshole?” It was refreshing to be able to say it out loud. Liberating. “It’s hardly your fault.”
“What do you mean,
Harry twirled the bottle of beer in his hand, watching at the dark liquid swirling inside the bottle. The fire burning in the fireplace right behind it sparkled through the glass, making it look like a sunset in a bottle. It was hot, way too hot to have the fireplace blazing, but he didn’t care. Who’d’ve thought that the most famous man in Britain’s Wizarding World would spend his twenty-fourth birthday completely alone?
He decided to pretend everything was perfectly normal about him. “Yeah, well – I received death threats.”
idea?”
He frowned, thoughtful, then looked at Harry. “You kissed me.”
She let go of Potter’s hand and took a step back. “Oh, that is so kind of you,” she said. She then walked away, starting a conversation with someone else.
Of course, out of all the possible timings, Ron and Hermione would happen to have an overlapping vacation on the week of his birthday, and Draco would have to work. Neville was busy with his new research and forgot about anything other than his little magical plants. Ginny had been a little awkward with him since they broke up, and hadn’t celebrated his birthday with him since; but the small box of home-made cookies she made was sitting next to him, already half gone. Arthur and Molly had sent him presents, but he wasn’t a child anymore, nor was he old enough to celebrate with a mature couple such as them. He’d considered his other, less close friends, but somehow it felt like everyone was too busy to celebrate his birthday.
Draco had suggested more quickly, he was certain of that.
The Muggle phrase ‘

Then it hit him. Who said that pasta had to be perfectly shaped? His mind was racing; he could just keep tearing it apart, and have pasta shreds. No one would know it wasn’t his initial intention. Smiling, he started tearing the dough intentionally. He then moved on, grabbing the knife and turning his attention to the onion. The knife was sharp and required almost no strength at all; but Harry still flexed his bicep, glancing at Draco to make sure he was watching, fighting a smirk when he saw that his man’s full attention was on him and his motions.
Lucius narrowed his eyes, his pupils moving between Potter and Draco, as if he was examining every nuance of their appearance. “Do you, now?”
He wasn’t completely wrong, at least about the second part, but it wasn’t bad enough today for Harry to push him away.
“He’s going to make the best pasta ever, you’ll see!”
Harry rolled his eyes at the memory of his own words; the words that made Draco suggest that instead of fighting, he and Kreacher would just compete against each other in a cook-off. With him as the judge, of course.
Eventually, Draco looked up, and locked his eyes with Harry’s. “I vote for Harry.”
When the onion was ready, he moved on to cut the mushrooms he’d prepared earlier.
the reason behind this sudden change? Draco wasn’t sure; but whatever Potter’s motivation was, it was working in Draco’s favour.
He let his shirt drop to the floor and picked up the heavy cream instead, pouring it into the pan. He was in such a hurry that when he put it away, a little bit of the cream dripped on his wrist. He reached over for a napkin; but then he had a better idea.
Harry closed the door and turned back to face his home. Malfoy was standing a few meters away. Harry could only see his back, but he could feel his judgement as he stared around the room. Suddenly Harry felt very aware of his living conditions. The clothes – shirts, trousers,

Harry’s blush deepened at being called out like this. He hurried to remove it.
Harry knew that someone was supposed to come today. And still, when his alarm charm went off and informed him of the presence of an intruder, he was startled out of his sleep and fell off the couch.

He was caught. He knew that Ron wouldn’t understand, but he should’ve known Parkinson would be a bit more attentive. He considered stopping his little show; but knew that it would mean losing, and he wasn’t going to lose to
But fantasies were not meant to last forever and soon –
Seeing Draco in the muggle rock band T-shirt was going to help Harry get in the mood for those
A moan escaped his lips as he got a first taste of Potter’s mouth. Smoked whiskey and sweetened cocoa filled his consciousness, along with another flavour that he couldn’t quite pin-point. He closed his eyes, barely even noticing he did so, and kissed Harry back. The world surrounding them disappeared as he felt himself drowning in Harry. He didn’t care about his father anymore, about the rumours he was spreading about possible future marriage, about family honour and whatnot. He cared only about keeping Harry there, tasting him for just a few seconds longer, holding onto him as if he encompassed everything Draco wanted: acceptance.
“Of course I do,” he replied. His voice was surprisingly steady considering the whirlwind that was raging inside him.
“I get that you don’t want to. I’m sorry, I’ll just – “

Why was this kiss affecting him so much? It was just a kiss. Draco’ d been kissed before. By better kissers.

BAM! The bubble burst. Draco was angry at himself for allowing any kind of hope to form in him. Lucius gestured at them dismissively. The implication was clear.
And it was his birthday.
, and Harry had an advantage over him that Kreacher could never have.
Again with the pet names. But it bothered Draco much less this time; as if the initial shock of being referred to as anything other than ‘Malfoy’ or ‘git’ by Potter had worn off and left room for the possibility of them having a different kind of relationship.
He watched, anxious, as the three judges tasted both dishes, could already tell all his little mishaps had indeed made his pasta almost inedible.
“I hope you know what you’re doing.”

, Potter.“
"Oh, just making the pasta," Harry said, keeping his tone neutral and innocent. Like he didn't just use the knowledge that Draco couldn't resist Harry's strong arms to his advantage. "I need to flatten the dough so I can cut and cook it."
With his vegetables ready, it was time to start with the actual cooking. He put a pan on the stove and turned the fire on, throwing some butter into it. He added in the onions and sauteed them before throwing in the mushrooms as well. Stealing another glance at Draco, seeing he was still very much focused on him, Harry held the pan’s handle, and mixed the vegetables in swift throwing movements.

His only hope was that he managed to get Draco horny enough to cloud his judgement. He watched him as he looked at both dishes, watched his mouth as he moved his tongue on his lips. Harry could recognize his little mannerisms, could imagine the struggle inside him.
Harry hurried there, scared to find out what Malfoy had found.
Draco placed the package he was holding – how did Harry not notice it until now? – on the messy coffee table. He pushed a few items to make enough room for it, which made Harry almost flinch at his own messiness. He usually cleaned up – at least a little bit, and with Kreacher’s help – before Draco came over.
The question was what was he doing here.
But out of all the Aurors available…
“Thank you,” he mumbled against his lips once he felt capable of creating words. He felt Draco’s lips stretching into a smile under his, and felt another kiss being pressed to him, short and sweet, before Draco pulled away.
He smiled back, putting up no resistance as Draco’s other hand slid over his arm, taking the empty beer bottle from him. “That sounds like a pretty good birthday to me,” Harry said, and moved his head to kiss Draco’s lips again. “Thank you.”
He could hear Potter’s laughter intensifying, as if hearing Draco laughing as well somehow encouraged him. As if they were stuck in some kind of a loop, Draco’s laugh grew wilder, louder, too. His eyes closed and he could feel wetness at their corners. He placed his hand on his stomach, feeling like he might fall and roll on the floor if he didn’t support himself
He watched his Aunt Lyra as she proceeded to give Potter the look through; head to toes and back again. He saw her eyes lingering for a few seconds on his forehead. It’s been a decade since the War had ended and the Dark Lord was officially defeated (again, and, hopefully, indefinitely this time), but people still thought that there was something special about Potter because of the scar. Idiots.
Draco’s hand found Harry’s, and gave it a light squeeze. “Good. I also brought your favorite book from the Manor. And, oh,” there was something sinister about Draco’s smile as he leaned closer to kiss his ear. “I have a few ideas for some

As if that thought cast a
Harry blinked again as he realized just how strange the feeling of Draco’s shirt was. It felt like none of his usual attires. Harry pushed himself away from Draco – not enough to break contact, but just enough to be able to look at him.
Harry chuckled bitterly and took another sip from his bottle.
Draco was not surprised that Potter took his hand back as soon as Lyra turned her back on them. He tried not to be offended by him wiping it over his dress robe as if Draco’s hand was covered in something vile.
“That’s hardly sanitary…”
worse than I’d imagined,” he heard from his bedroom.
"What are you working so hard on?" Draco asked and moved closer to him.
Potter was looking at him again, and when Draco took too long to answer, he pinched him lightly. Draco snapped out of that line of thought, remembering that it was all a show. Potter would never consider having a
“And –
“So why are you here?”
Harry smirked broadly.
“Aren’t you here to protect me, or something?”
Deciding to take the most out of the situation, Draco moved his own arms, placing one hand on the small of Potter’s back and raising his other to wrap around his nape. He felt Potter moving under his touch; a slight change of footing, a miniscule alteration of the angle of his face as he adjusted to Draco.
Strangely enough, however, Potter stayed, albeit grumpily. They were approached by other wedding guests, more frequently from that point on. Apparently, the news of Lucius Malfoy’s son’s expected marriage to none other than The Chosen One was hot gossip and it travelled in the room faster than the Knight Bus on a busy night. Draco could tell that Potter wasn’t pleased, but Draco was relieved to see that his assumption that Potter wouldn’t be able to resist his need to help everyone seemed to be accurate.
Being raised to be a slaughter pig didn’t leave much room for any non-life-threatening skill-set, no matter how successful he was at the role he’d been given, or how ‘heroic’ everyone else thought he was.
Draco felt his heartbeat increase as rage swelled inside his chest. He
Harry’s chest tightened.
“No – I mean, yes, I’m alright. I’m just… your

Parkinson scoffed. “
“It was,” Draco agreed. He put his wand away and walked towards Harry, wrapping his arms around him and placing a kiss on the top of his messy hair. “But it looked like you needed me tonight more than my work, so I came here.”

“Keep your curiosity to yourself. Oh, hello Auntie Lyra,” Draco replaced his annoyed frown with a charming smile as he spotted one of his mother’s cousins. “Have you met my boyfriend, Harry Potter?”
but I meant… I didn’t mean to get you kicked out of your own family.”
While Draco felt his end approaching, Potter seemed to be gaining confidence and resolve. He felt his fingers pulling him closer until their hips pressed against each other, and swallowed, fighting to stay in place. “I know Draco makes
They hated each other.
For some reason, though, Draco didn’t comment on it. “I was,” he said instead and walked past Harry into the house.
"Good thing it was Double Potions, hm? Nothing to do until then." A lazy smile formed on Harry's face.
Harry rubs Teddy’s back, recalling the times, literally every hour in those first couple weeks, when Teddy would wake from nightmares. The despairing wails that punctured the darkness won’t ever leave him, Harry’s sure, the sorrow so pure of Teddy waking to realize he’s no longer with Andromeda.
The class scrambled to their seats, hurriedly doing as requested as Professor Sprout took off on a run-through of what they were taught as first years. Draco however, held the paper open under the table he, Harry, Hermione, and Weasley had claimed.
Happiness gone in an instant, Teddy’s face turns stony. “No.”
“To see Teddy.”
They move as quickly without haste, stripping Teddy and helping him into the warm water, moving fairly in sync to start washing him.
Although Draco’s ears feel hot and he can see Harry’s cheeks flush slightly, it’s all met with Mr. Cook bursting into laughter.
"Wh-"
"Of course you'd memorize my eating habits."
"What have you to say for yourself?" she cried, lips practically gone for how thin they were.
For a few seconds, Malfoy just blinks at him. “I...had given the same idea some thought,” he says finally. “...Harry.”
"Is what true?"
Harry blinks, corners of his mouth dropping into a frown.
Harry about leapt out of his skin at the voice behind him. He spun around and found Malfoy, black eye long healed and gone, standing a few feet behind him in the empty corridor.
Draco tugged on Harry's hand, forcing the other to take a step closer. Draco leaned in to kiss Harry despite his words but the hand on his chest stopped him again.
Hermione and the rest of the class were already on their feet, setting up cauldrons or collecting ingredients, before Harry even realized that Slughorn had dismissed them to work. He had listened far better than he had expected himself to, but Harry's mind was still occupied with Draco, wondering how the hell things could have gone so wrong so quickly.
"Oh." Draco hadn't a clue what to say to that. Perhaps boys were different, but he hadn't hadn't spent even a minute of his childhood once sitting around talking about girls. What was there even to say about them? That they were high maintenance and shrill? More conniving than he could ever hope to be? Overly fragrant and a confusing array of emotions that rarely lined up with sense?
Josh audibly gulped, and he looked to his friends for support, but they all looked at the floor instead. It was only then when Josh answered.
Potter tilted his head. "You would've just slept a few minutes if I'd left you there. But you slept all night, didn't you?"
"I don't think you do."
“What’s that all about?”
"Along these lines, as you may have noticed from the Sorting, this means that we have twice the number of first years that we usually do. For this reason, seventh years in each House have been drawn additional quarters than the normal dormitories to make room."
“I agree. Start hugging him more.”
“Right. See you, then.” Grabbing the small blue backpack, Harry pulls Teddy into his side a little tighter, turns on the spot to Apparate home.
"No, but I did ask them for some hot chocolate. But today, I went there and asked them to make and deliver a lunch to your dormitory. I...after you shouted at me in the library, I was pretty angry with you. Which I had every right to be," she said with a brief narrowing of her eyes. "But, I also realized that you're just sad and tired and probably hungry, too, so I thought I'd try and help out."
And in a matter of minutes, all that is gone.
Draco pursed his lips to keep from chuckling though Potter continued to grin at him. It was horribly awkward. "I...uh, appreciate what you meant by it, but you really should have just left me there. I would've woken up in a few minutes and gone back to my own bed."
Her screams filled Draco's mind every night.
“Well,” Hermione says when more than an hour has passed, “it’s nearing half past now. Crookshanks will be needing his dinner.”
Hands were on him then, grabbing at him and forcing him back into the sitting position that he had fallen from at some point. Sure he was being attacked, found alone and weak on the grounds, Draco tried to pull back, choking on his own failed attempts to breathe. Maybe he ought to let them finish him off.
That took Harry by surprise. "What do you mean?"
"Thank you," he said, not giving a damn at the hopelessness of the adoration in his voice. "Thank you for wanting to save me. Thank you for not giving up on me."
Keeping Teddy’s head down, Malfoy disappears into the bedroom. Adrenaline racing, Harry tries to collect himself while fixing the blanket. It takes only a few moments until Draco is returning to the living room, closing the door on Teddy’s whimpering within. Harry moves around the couch, intending to check on him.
Draco’s mouth falls open. “Why in Merlin’s name would you think it’s okay to look in my bedroom while I’m sleeping?”
"Before I joined the DA two years ago, other students were quite cruel to me as well," she continued as she followed Draco into the entrance hall. "No one burned my skin or gave me a black eye, but their words were cutting in their own way."
“Mr. Malfoy?”
“You stop screaming,” he says firmly. “Right this instant, young man.”
“I’m signed through June.”
"Hmm."
"What the-" Harry cut himself off, rubbing his eyes in frustration. "You can't be serious. Regularly? How are you not dead?"
“Teddy, we’ve read this book a hundred times. Can we please read something else? Anything else?”
Without thinking much more on it as his lips found Draco's again, Harry carefully slipped his finger inside.
Hesitating just barely, Harry does, giving Draco the breathing room he so desperately needs. Handling the mess, he glances over at Teddy, who has eaten about half of his sandwich but is now poking his fingers experimentally through the bread.
Disgruntled but apparently unable to form a solid argument against it, Ron left to sit beside Draco. Harry watched as his best friend fell into the seat there, startling Draco a bit, and lean in to speak with him. When Draco nodded at whatever Ron had told him and began to reply back, hot jealously licked at Harry's stomach, making him grimace.
Instantly riled, Harry takes two steps closer, hands tightening into fists in a lame attempt to avoid grabbing his wand. “If you can’t afford to keep yourself well enough to care for Teddy properly, it absolutely is my concern.”
Draco glanced over at the little girl that had appeared at his side. It was the tiny first year he had spoken to at the Welcoming Feast. Since his encounter with her brother, Draco had avoided her as best he could.
Moaning with sleep, Harry lifts his head. Teddy stands there, shorts clearly soaked.
"Technically? That doesn't sound very fun."
"Harry-"
The politeness that they fallen into in the past several weeks was one thing. It could be explained away as a more passive form of ignoring who Draco was. But for Potter to slam him against the wall and demand justice for Draco...it was too far.
“He eats when he’s hungry.”
“Are you concerned about money?”
“You sound ridiculous.”
"Hello, Harry."
But Harry is nothing but an absolute nightmare. He made the flat unnaturally spotless in the hour that Draco was gone but seemed to have forgotten that Teddy still needs to eat dinner. So, with only half an hour to make something happen, Draco’s putting together sandwiches. Easy.
"Where're you off to so early?"
"If it means you giving yourself a second chance, then yes."
"You alright?"
Her eyes drifted into the crowd as she spoke, and Harry followed them, spotting the newlywed couple in the center of the chaos. Hermione was laughing, nearly doubling over in her slim white dress, one hand on Luna's shoulder and the other clutching a nearly empty glass of champagne. Ron stood beside her, just as red in the face, laughing with Neville and Hannah Abbott. Dean and Seamus, leaning heavily on one another, stood with them. It was an achingly good sight, Harry thought. But Mrs. Weasley's worry wasn't entirely unfounded. Not even walking, Ron stumbled into Neville, who caught him and laughed as he helped steady him.
“Technically all, save for a subcategory of 25% on certain items.”
“Geen tangle.”
A thin but strong hand gripped his arm and pulled him back to his feet.
Still, he resented the wait. He was eager to find his peace, one way or the other.
"Come on," Potter muttered. He was looking a few inches to the right of Draco, nodding his head down the corridor before walking off, leaving Draco to follow.
"Things were never quite right between us."
“Er...”
But that’s not what matters, Harry keeps reminding himself. Teddy’s stability is more important than Harry’s personal rivalries.
What if he refuses to come back?
"It was last year, when everything was going to hell here at Hogwarts. I was...a mess for it. Sixth year hadn't been a picnic, either, and I was running on fumes at that point. Pansy...offered to help me relieve some tension. We only got as far as kissing when I vomited all over her."
"I see Luna walking with you in the passing periods sometimes."
Harry opens his mouth to retort but is sidetracked when Draco pulls something from his pocket, offers it out. Taking it, Harry finds a sliver of parchment with an address on it.
“It must be nice to have everything handed to you on a silver platter, Potter,” comes the sneering retort.
"Would you rather I say I hated you?"
If only poor Mr. Cook knew even an inkling of it.
“Personally, Harry, I think that’s wonderful news.”
"You're stronger than Malfoy!" She was practically shouting, drawing the entire greenhouse's attention. "Don't let him manipulate you like that!"
"I saw your wand drop," Potter continued, and Draco heard footfalls draw nearer. He didn't turn around, though. "I know you were scared. I know you didn't want what happened."
a disaster that they’d remove Teddy from your care.”
“Have a moment?” Hermione asks as she breaks through to appear at his side.
"No he isn't, Harry." Granger's voice was as dreamy as Draco felt, and she returned his vague smile as she and Weasley drew nearer, bags over their shoulders.
“Are you a vegetarian?”
"Mmm?" Draco hummed, but Harry ignored him and reached down to remove Draco's pants, pushing them to the floor as best he could and finally releasing Draco's own hard cock. Harry lined their cocks together and thrust himself forward and up slightly, skin rubbing gently together. Draco's head fell back as he moaned and Harry took the opportunity to kiss at the exposed skin of his neck. He thrust forward again.
Incredible weight crashes into Draco’s knees. The world rockets beneath him, reaches up and punches him in the back of his head. Did he sit down? It feels as if there’s a chair under him.
"Last lesson's homework, with marks," he said, passing back rolls of parchment. "I'm pleased that most of you seem to have a full grasp of what ingredients separate the antidotes from the wards, but for those of you that didn't earn at least an E on this, please continue to study the concept."
"I wasn't," Harry grumbled. He was leaning against a wall. When had that happened? "I just thought we were past all the fear, is all."
Draco sighed as he wistfully watched the little girl begin to eat the chicken. It didn't take more than two bites before she was eating properly and going back for seconds. Satisfied, Draco let his attention wander the Hall, safe in the knowledge that the other students were too busy eating to notice him in the moment. After a few seconds, a found a wild head of black hair and round glasses that could only mean one person.
"What?"
That had been the last time Harry had spoken to Draco. Harry took another swig of his Fire Whiskey, not even grimacing anymore at the burning against his throat. Maybe he ought to go back to calling him Malfoy.
"And if anyone says anything, you and I are good enough wizards that we can kick their arses no problem."
“My word, you misunderstand me in your urgency to paint me as the villain in your boring little world.” Draco rolls his eyes. “You think I’m going to do a single thing that might remotely jeopardize my seeing Teddy? I knew you were an idiot, Potter, but
“You’ve been comin’ in here a lot this past year,” Tom says after several moments. “Not quite the same boy you were then today. Whatever you’ve got doin’, it’s payin’ off.”
"She said to be careful, and she's right." Draco dropped his gaze. "Being friends with a Malfoy will only tarnish your reputation."
"Gossip comes and goes," Harry whispered. "You know that. Their opinions don't matter anyway." When Malfoy didn't respond, Harry continued. "I know you're not some criminal that deserves to be treated like a human punching bag."
Draco huffs somewhat at the thought, amused, crosses his legs as he relaxes into a chair to watch Teddy play. He always seemed to enjoy constructing things, something Draco isn’t sure he understands. Likely, it’s just toddler development. Although perhaps the interest will persist and Teddy might wind up an architect of some sort one day.
The Care-Seekers may have left, but the torture is due to continue, it seems.
The common room entrance slid open and a group of first year girls wandered in, chattering happily. They either didn't see Draco or ignored him, finding their way around a nearby table to continue their conversation without even glancing over. Just as well, Draco thought. He wouldn't know what to say to them anyway, except for maybe...
“What’s it to you?”
"Okay, you're not going to be a bother, especially if you tell her why you need them." Harry glared at Malfoy's profile, sighing when the other didn't respond. "One of these days, I'm going to get it through that thick skull of yours that you
Harry swallowed, taken aback by the hard tone. "Oh."
“You have to stay right here. No wandering off, okay?”
"Don't give me that look, you know I'd have backed you up if you'd have just waited two minutes for me to get there."
“You’re taking him out?”
But when Potter licked his lips and gulped, Draco spoke.
A moan slid past Draco's lips. Attacked? He didn't think Josh and his friends had actually done more than scratch him up a bit. But if the voice was right and his skull was injured, it'd make sense that he couldn't remember. The world suddenly tilted violently to the left in addition to the spinning, and a fresh wave of nausea kept Draco from thinking more.
"What?"
"What, you four just took it upon yourselves to corner someone alone after dinner?" Hermione asked. "You're all a bunch of cowards! What has he done to you this year?"
“You have a point,” Draco says with a final chuckle. “But from what little I see of Teddy and Potter together and how Teddy acts overall, it would seem that Potter’s not entirely inept.”
At first, Harry was incredibly stiff as he laid there, unsure of what to do with his limbs as he shared a bed with Malfoy. But when Malfoy rolled over and threw his arm across Harry's chest, snuggling into his side, Harry felt his body automatically relax. His mind was reeling at the sensation of Malfoy breathing on his exposed neck, legs tangling themselves with his own, hand lazily grabbing at his shirt.
Skulking away, the angry librarian shot them a few more glares over her shoulder before turning down one of the aisles in search of more wrongdoers. Draco bent back over his work.
Eyes still on Draco, who hadn't moved a muscle as the rest of the class began to mingle, Harry made his way over to Ron and Hermione.
"What do you mean?"
"You know, you never asked my name."
“I suspect there’s a lot you don’t know about me.”
"Of course!" She sounded annoyed. "After those awful things Ron said to him...I can only imagine what kind of regrets Malfoy's having these days, and with what we know other students have been doing to him in between lessons and who knows what else...I didn't know how close to the truth Ron's words might have been for him."
“By design, Potter. I was the one chosen to execute Dumbledore for that very reason.”
A needy groan erupted from Draco's throat as he bucked his hips both forward into Harry and backward into the finger there, vaguely surprising Harry. He pulled his tongue away from its dance with Draco's so he could ask, "Did...was that a good...did that feel good?"
Alright, all transferred and I can consider this story laid to rest (again). It was interesting to reread a piece of my work from so long ago and see how things have changed. My husband likes to tease me for this piece and another I had the misfortune of drunkenly sharing with him, but there's little I can do unless I want to scrap the whole thing. And I'm not quite a fan of burying the past when it can show how much one's grown.
“But you stole the sun from my heart,” Draco sings, crouched on the floor of the far wall with a muggle guitar in his lap. Teddy sits in front of him, smacking the wood sporadically.
Andromeda had been kind, though. She allowed Harry a visit any time he requested, and when Harry had returned to Hogwarts, she had sent him monthly pictures without ever having been asked. It was a unique relationship, one that Harry had almost immediately taken to with ease.
“But as both of you are very eager to keep Teddy out of the adoption system, Kara and I are quite confident that neither of you will try to step out of the bounds should you both agree and sign.
"And, if you and everyone else just have to keep calling me a saving-everyone-person," Harry continued, sounding mildly annoyed, "then yes, in a way, I'm trying to save you. But honestly, my wanting to save you is far less noble and more selfish than anyone I've tried to save before."
"Yeah. It'll be rather full, I think, what with all the brothers that are usually abroad or elsewhere coming to stay at once."
After the past seven years, a normal school term with normal adolescent issues did sound an awful lot like a vacation.
Harry didn't know what to say. From what little he did know about Lucius Malfoy, Draco wasn't necessarily wrong, but it didn't feel right to say so. Instead, Harry crossed the Owlery and took Draco's hand.
"Nothing is impossible, you know," she said, and she nodded toward the ground at their feet. Draco looked down and gave a choking laugh.
“Oh, absolutely not,” Draco snaps. “I’m always the bad guy.
“Close enough. This is a green rectangle.”
Potter’s hand shoots to his pocket.
Malfoy grabbed his bag from under the desk and fled amidst the chaos of everyone trying to pack up, leaving Harry with his mouth slightly agape at their desk.
Draco's gaze flickered over to the Gryffindor table, quickly finding Karen's brother and his friends. Thankfully, they hadn't seemed to notice that the little girl was at Draco's side.
“Right. And this,” he says, turning the page, “is a yellow square.”
“Is that so?”
Not quite caring how furious it will likely make Draco, Harry changes Teddy into a clean nappy before they leave. He needs the energy release more than he needs to be toilet trained for pride rights. Besides, a few hours’ break from what was probably a very stressful day will do Teddy good, let him start fresh tomorrow. If anything, Harry’s doing Draco a favor.
He said it so quietly that Harry wasn't sure he heard right, but it struck him in the chest just the same. There was a savage sense of childish justice thinking that all the trouble Malfoy had ever caused him was being returned, but Harry knew that no black eye likely delivered multiple-on-one would have satisfied that. No, Malfoy's punishment had already been dealt when his father brought Voldemort into his home.
Harry blinked, taken aback by Malfoy's tone. In the past several weeks, Malfoy had taken to being his silent partner in Potions, only speaking when Harry asked him a direct question. Harry hadn't noticed anymore of the strange breathing trouble he had seen those first few days, and he supposed that meant things were maybe getting better. But to hear such self-loathing coming from Malfoy's mouth was even stranger than the casualness of their encounters since the start of term.
"F-fuck, Harry, wait."
Harry struggles into consciousness. “Mm? Teddy?” The clock reads just after two in the morning, finally Friday. “Wha’s the matter?”
All Draco could do was nod. He really should have.
When his hands fell from his face, Hermione still stood there with a smile on her face. She linked her arm in his and began leading the way down the staircase.
"I'm trying, but you're here."
His mother nodded slowly, swallowing her food. "Have they at least refrained from...from being violent?"
Ms. Dribble offers Draco a smirk. Staring back, he awards the old witch a thin smile, still irritated. Mr. Cook stands, and Draco and Harry follow suit. Teddy slithers himself to the floor, climbs back on the couch.
Teddy nods as he climbs under his covers. “Stay?”
A small smile crept up onto Draco's face. "I suppose. If you're into baby drool and being bitten."
Ms. Dribble nods once, eyes intent on him. “Indeed. Good evening, Mr. Potter.”
"Well, then you're just as loony as your nickname."
Draco's mother looked as though she had been slapped for a moment, total confusion clouding her eyes as she appraised Draco fully. But she seemed to gather herself, exhaled, and smiled.
Josh laughed. "Come on, Conrad, you think it matters? This piece of dung isn't going to tell anyone, just like he hasn't all year. Why do you think people keep finding him?"
They fell into a contented silence as Harry also began to dress, and by the time they were both fully clothed and Draco had the invisibility cloak thrown over him, both were breathing normally again.
Footsteps echoed outside the door, signaling that the start of class was due soon. Ron gathered his bag and stood to move to his own desk.
Harry spun around, a wild look of confusion on his face as he opened his mouth.
Ron smacked him on the shoulder. "Shut up, I'm trying to be here for you. You know, in your time of need or whatever."
She beamed at him, and Harry tried not to feel too uncomfortable.
“I’m surprised,” Ms. Dribble says, “given your history with Mr. Malfoy, your willingness to allow such an arrangement.”
"He doesn't really mean those things, you know." She sniffled and wiped at her eyes. "He just lets his emotions get away from him sometimes. You and I know him better than anyone. You know he doesn't really wish Malfoy were dead, right?"
"You're wondering why I'm not at the Ravenclaw table?"
"Ugh! You know what I mean." Karen crossed her arms and huffed, her breath turning a few pages of Draco's open textbook.
"I only wore it to piss you off."
"These are three very different poisons," Slughorn said. "Your assignment today is to identify the poison and the ingredient or ingredients that make it poisonous, as well as craft an antidote for each."
Hermione gave him a peculiar look. "Well...after what happened yesterday, I was worried."
"Right." Ron nodded awkwardly. "Well, best do as she says and wash up. She won't have you ducking out on our last dinner together."
Teddy huffs. “Day-o?”
“Who is watching the prison now, sir?” one of the trainees asks.
The eyes of nearby muggles are heavy on Harry’s shoulders as he hauls a screaming child toward the bushes. His entire body scorches hot as he lifts Teddy bodily in attempts to cause less of a scene.
“Don’t worry yourself, Potter, I’ll keep an eye on him.” Draco smiles politely as Potter shoots a glare over his shoulder. “That is, after all, why we’re all here.”
"May I ask what reward you had in mind?"
"Real classy, Potter."
Teddy, however, literally spits a huge clump of half-chewed tortilla and meat, slimy with sauce, slobber, and cheese, directly onto the table.
Harry raised his head, blinking sleepily at the unfamiliar voice. Irritation prickled as a younger student, probably a fourth or fifth year by the looks of her, eyed with with concern and stood entirely too close. He knew what she was doing there.
“Yeh.”
There was a sharp intake of air at Draco's lips, breaking their kiss. It was just Harry's head inside of him, but Harry had worried that two fingers wasn't enough to prepare Draco. He stopped, letting the muscles clenching around his cock stretch and relax as Harry continued to kiss Draco's lips softly. Millimeter by millimeter, Harry pressed his way into Draco, kissing him as tenderly as possible along the way. Harry had to keep his eyes closed at the strain on Draco's face, but when he had tried to stop and pull out, Draco had grabbed his hips and held firm, wordlessly asking him to continue.
"Potter!"
Careful not to make a sound for fear of disrupting, Harry pads across the carpet to Draco’s open bedroom door. Is that a guitar?
"No, I'm serious, Malfoy. You have got to get more sleep than that. Ask Madam Pomfrey for a Sleeping Draught or something."
Draco was floating in darkness. He was pretty sure he was dead. But if he were dead, surely he wouldn't be able to think that he was dead, right? But think he could, and Draco could only think about how far the mighty had fallen, where Draco Malfoy was regularly taunted, jinxed, and hexed in the corridors and occasionally cornered and all-out attacked unless he was accompanied by none other than Luna Lovegood.
"You could just say 'thank you' and not let it keep happening."
"You're coming, too, so come on."
“Well, sounds like the tyke had a bit more fun than he can handle.”
Without warning, Draco's mouth wrapped around Harry's cock entirely, dropping down nearly to the base with his tongue pressing along the length.
Harry wasn't disappointed, exactly. He just wished he had been able to take things a bit further. But as he led an invisible Draco out of Gryffindor Tower, Harry had to admit that he was feeling a bit tensed from such a passionate wake up call with no release.
Oh, how very wrong she was, Draco thought. If anything, he owed it to the world to remain unhappy for the rest of his days.
"That's so long, though."
Mr. Cook laughs. “Oh, no, please don’t worry. It’s similar, but far different in terms of what Mr. Malfoy actually would have access to do. What Ms. Dribble and I are brainstorming would primarily just hold Mr. Malfoy to a higher standard of child care, with some minor responsibilities on his part for his time expected to care for Teddy.”
Draco runs a hand through his hair as he sits up. Yes, the laws are entirely against him. He’ll have to play by all the rules. Sure, he hasn’t achieved large goals without waltzing over the line of the law probably ever. Sure, his opponent is the most prized wizard in the world. Sure, his own reputation, his blood-stained past, is going to be working overtime against him. But if it means getting Teddy back, Draco can follow the rules. He can play nice.
expel you."
A small hand fell on his arm, and Draco opened his eyes to find Luna standing right beside him, a bright smile filling her face. His queasiness increased.
Enough is enough.
“And what is that supposed to mean?”
"You can't just be miserable forever."
He pulled back and held her at arm's length. "Thank you."
“What, like that’s supposed to impress me?” Draco spits.
Leaning down fast, Harry shushes frantically. “You have to whisper, Teddy.”
"Well, that'd be because I was in Ron's bed when I saw you."
Thank you for reading this far :)
Far before Draco was ready, Harry pulled away. His hand still rested on Draco's cheek.
Hands letting go of the stone.
“I-” Overwhelmed, Harry speaks to Teddy first. “I’m sorry, but your blanket isn’t here. We’ll find another one in a minute.” He turns his attention back to Mr. Cook and Ms. Dribble. “It’s...er, Draco Malfoy. A few weeks ago, I asked him to watch Teddy while I was at work, just the once, but then it kind of...it sort of turned into a regular thing. He’s been watching Teddy instead of Fleur or Mrs. Weasley."
“I hug him plenty. And I meant that you should be more firm with him, Potter.”
“-but during the week, at least, he’s never shy about asking for food when he’s hungry. And as long as the food he
They sat there in silence, neither eating in favor of their coffees. As the sun rose higher, filling the Hall with light and livelier students, Harry wondered if Malfoy was awake yet. He stood abruptly when Ron wandered through the doors.
“What are you suggesting here, Hermione?”
“Come on, Teddy, it’ll just take a-”
Harry obeyed, and he let his head fall back as Draco kissed his shoulders, one hand gliding over Harry's chest as the other dropped to the space between them at their hips. Pressure made its way to Harry's entrance while Draco's lips moved up his neck and suckled at his earlobe. Subconsciously bending at the waist slightly, Harry turned his head to bring their lips together again, this time slow and tender.
"Wow, the world really does...spin when you drink."
Draco smirked. "I wasn't."
"What are you doing here?" Draco asked, still frozen on his back with Teddy squirming in his arms above him.
Harry sighed and stood to help her. Hermione's textbook was open to the recipe, her cauldron was already near boiling, and she had all the ingredients they needed, so Harry began chopping up some of the stems as described in the text. Hermione stood beside him, skinning a dark orb.
"So...feeling better?"
“Will you relax already? Your nerves are frying and I can smell the char."
As Draco approached Harry, slowing as he drew closer, he sensed rather than saw several different people or groups standing up in alarm. They likely thought he was about to attack Harry, especially when Draco grabbed him roughly by the shoulders and ripped him from his seat.
“Today there was a little girl with a toy broomstick and Teddy tried to steal it. Got pretty far, too, before I could catch him.”
"Please," Draco moaned, voice only just an octave below a formal beg.
Karen's face flushed, but she stood when he did, glaring daggers at him from a foot below.
Harry set down his fork. He hadn't eaten much, but he couldn't even pretend to continue now. Lucius Malfoy dead. Maybe once, in his angrier of times, Harry might have relished in the idea, but the reality of it was horrible. Lucius' wife, Narcissa, had saved Harry's life when it had mattered most, and though Harry had a seven year bitter rivalry with their son, Draco, he knew deep down that he would never have wanted this for him. Now the Malfoys, once a proud wizarding family, were a shattered shell, with only a mother and son to fend for themselves. Yet another family destroyed by Voldemort, even after his death. Harry closed his eyes.
He dropped the note on his bed and made his way back downstairs.
"She's more outgoing than she thinks she is."
Malfoy isn’t back from work yet. It’s a little surprising and a lot telling. Malfoy is usually back before ten, so it can’t be as late as Harry’s body feels it is. But even as he thinks about and dreads the daunting task of bathing Teddy and putting him to bed, Harry hears a loud crack, watches Malfoy Apparate into existence just a few steps away.
Luna cleared her throat, and Draco raised his eyes to meet hers. She wasn't smiling anymore, but Draco somehow felt that smiling just part of who she was, how she carried herself. He could
Draco makes his way up the stairs, quickly finds himself on the fourth level and staring at Potter’s front door. Without allowing himself the chance to think better on it, Draco raps at the door, loud and insistent. A few moments pass without a response. Draco knocks again.
She smiled again. "There he is."
“At this time, most of the policies for Azkaban, its prisoners, and the upcoming trainings have been signed off on, which I will be going over in detail in just a moment for this meeting. They are quite straightforward. As for the whole of the new subdepartment I mentioned, I believe administration is hoping for more of a concrete framework in place by summer’s end. The ideal is to start accepting a fresh wave of Azkaban-Auror hopefuls into the first class of training at the conclusion of the calendar year.”
.” Lucius grimaced. “I’ll consider giving you my blessing when I have proof that this is real.”
Draco’s side stung as Potter pinched him. He shook himself back to the present. If Potter had the guts to stand up to Lucius, then so could Draco.
Harry let them keep talking, focusing his attention on Draco again, and on putting on his little show for him.
brush his fingers over Draco's. He heard his little gasp, but pretended he didn’t notice, turning back to flattening his dough. Draco lingered, but he walked away when Harry didn’t pay any more attention to him and sat back on his chair next to Parkinson.
He was in no condition to be presented in public, and even more so, in Draco’s presence.
?” Harry placed his used napkin back on the floating tray, which responded to the offense by zooming away. Aristocratic serving plates did not appreciate doubling as trash bins; there were other trays for that. “Because your father was being a git. Our cover was about to be blown. I had - you’re not mad, are you?”
Why did it hurt so much?
Draco blinked. That was not what he expected; though he wasn’t sure
what he was doing. Sure, he was going to suffer from having Potter by his side; but it would be peanuts compared to how much
!” Draco heard his father scoff.
A moment of awkward silence. “I’m still sorry. It sucks that you have to go through this.”
Malfoy cleared his throat. “See? You’re capable of looking decent.”
This wasn’t exactly how Draco thought this night would end; he didn’t think that pissing his father off would result in something as extreme as being disowned.
He felt everyone's eyes moving to watch him. Kreacher glanced at him, huffed, and returned to his work. Ron looked puzzled. Pansy had her eyebrow arched, but overall looked very unimpressed.
him they’d be free. Of course everyone had good excuses, and everyone had said that they’d celebrate with him next weekend; Draco even popped in his fireplace to wish him a happy birthday through a Floo call. But it didn’t help him feel less lonely, sitting alone on the living room floor of Grimmauld Place with nothing but a cheap beer to keep him company.
Malfoy’s eyebrow arched up. “I meant your lack of style, Potter. But I can’t blame you for going
, he thought bitterly to himself.
He took a deep breath, letting it out as a sigh, and for a moment he and Harry stood in the empty hall. It wasn’t awkward, or tense, as he would’ve expected it would be; it was a comfortable kind of silence, of them taking in all that had happened that evening.
“Potter,
did you do?!”
They laughed together for a while; long enough for people to just move on to gossip about them somewhere else. Long enough for Draco to be gasping for air, to no longer care that his eyes were tearing.
Potter’s voice cut through the frenzy of Draco’s thoughts, bringing him back to the present. Around them the party went on just as it did before this encounter with Lucius. It seemed that everyone was too busy to notice his drama. They were drifting around the room, talking, drinking, eating. Unaware of the major life change he’d just gone through, unaware that the world, the way he knew it his entire life, had just shattered. It felt surreal that something that was this significant to him could go so unnoticed by everyone else.
. Emptied. Vanished. Instead, Malfoy was standing there holding dress robes Harry had never seen before, and definitely did not
popped into his mind as the alarm rang yet again. He pushed himself off the floor and made his way to the door, putting on his slippers on the way. He mumbled the charm that would allow his visitor to see the door and enter.
Harry blinked at the greeting. It took him a few seconds to comprehend what happened; the effects of the beer made him a tad slower than usual. But even if he was completely drunk (which he wasn’t, yet, unfortunately) he could never mistake the platinum-blond hair, icy eyes and beautiful, sharp features of his boyfriend.
“Oh, of course you do. Well, I vote for Kreacher. It was at least
wore off a little, enabling Draco to notice the nuances in his hold.
“You mean, together? You and I?”
With each new person coming over to ask about their engagement, the story of their engagement evolved a little bit more. A new detail about the proposal here, a note about their wedding plans there. Potter seemed to be growing more uncomfortable by the minute, but Draco couldn’t resist. After all, it was highly likely that this would be the only wedding he’d get to plan.
Harry fought his laughter. "No, it's alright. Magic will just ruin it, take out the

who he wanted to be.
“I’m…” he paused, letting a short, uncertain laugh. Finding it hard to put his emotions and thoughts in order. “Thank you,” he managed. “You didn’t have to do it.”
“Oh, I’m sorry! I didn’t know it was still a secret.” She looked more sorry that Lucius’ information was inaccurate. Astoria was her niece, and despite being stripped of a lot of their properties after the War, the Malfoy name still had its charm in the right circles. The Blacks were a part of those circles. “Congratulations,” she said.
“Malfoy, get out of my – what the
With his tiredness and need for solitude gone, Harry smirked. “Surprised?”
Draco could feel Harry tensing next to him, but he pretended he didn’t notice it as he calmly replied. “We haven’t settled on a date yet, but please rest assured that we will send you an owl once we do. I know how busy your schedule is.”
– what are
Was it blush he saw on his pale cheeks?
Draco took out his wand, ready to apparate away; but then he lowered it and looked at Harry. “Do you want to go somewhere?” he asked. He wasn’t even sure why. He knew he didn’t feel like being alone right now, too scared of letting his mind go over tonight’s events so soon; and he didn’t feel like spending the rest of the evening with Pansy.
“Of course, Draco, of course. It was great seeing you, and I’m very happy about the exciting news,” she almost turned, but then seemed to remember that Potter was there too. She offered her hand to him, and he took it, shaking it awkwardly. “Harry Potter. It was great meeting you, too. When should I expect your invitation?”
Harry found himself following Malfoy in his own house, his requests for Malfoy to stop snooping around his home completely ignored.

“But I can tell it hurts him to hear about the different dates you try to set up for me. So please, father, stop. I’m perfectly happy where I am now, by Harry’s side.”
the way he acted, more than once.
“Is that correct, Draco?”
“I know, I apologize.” Gone was his previous sweetness, replaced by sarcastic, dismissive chill. “Apparently my father decided that I’m going to get married. I had to make sure no one gets the wrong idea.”
“I’m fine,” he lied. But it was nice to feel Draco’s warmth against him. He could swear he could feel his heartbeat through his shirt, even though the smooth, slightly rigid texture made it more difficult than his usual high-thread silk shirts –
It felt…
Harry followed Malfoy’s eyes. “Uhm, you mean my Crocs? They’re comf – “

"Oh, shut it, Kreacher, he's just getting a knife, it's not like he's going to spell the dough not to break or something."
Yes, it was already morning.
Harry felt overwhelmed. He had been set to ‘celebrate’ his birthday alone and drunk. Instead Draco was here, showing him just how much he cared for him. The slimy ball in his chest melted into a warm, fuzzy pool, comforting rather than suffocating. He closed the distance between them again and placed a kiss on Draco’s mouth.
Harry was about to lose. And he had to
Another tray - this time a trash tray - floated in their direction; possibly summoned by the offended serving tray. Draco used the opportunity and placed his own wet napkin on it. He let out a short, bitter chuckle as it slowly floated away. “No. He disowned me.”
Heart aching, Draco takes Teddy into his arms and hugs him, holds back a stuttered breath. Draco feels a single tear sting the corner of his eye.
"I don't know," he mumbled, looking down at his bowl. Suddenly, he didn't feel terribly hungry anymore. He pushed his bowl away and stood.
