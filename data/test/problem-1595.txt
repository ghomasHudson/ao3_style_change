Hermione was draped over an armchair opposite the fire, reading an Arithmancy textbook - or so it appeared. Draco knew tucked inside the textbook was a historical romance novel, his mother and Andy had gotten both him and Hermione hooked on them over the summer. Andy and his mother were at The Burrow, having a girls night - of all things - with Mrs. Weasley - Molly, he was still getting used to calling her her first name - and Mrs. Granger - Jean.
Harry stood with Kingsley and his friends, feeling his rage turn into satisfaction, the monster in his chest settling into prideful triumph.
Harry tugged on Draco's hands, Draco leaning in to press his forehead against Harry's, "Harry, don't be offended but, sweet Salazar could you do with a shower. Molly's cleaning spells don't help after three weeks of sweaty hospital sheets."
Harry realised all he owned was now in the Mokeskin bag around his neck and he briefly grieved Hedwig again when he remembered that he'd left her cage behind. He left a nudge to his hip, Draco smiled again at him, "C'mon Potter, chin up, time to get you fed. And you
"Mr. Harry Potter is being looked after by his friend," Winky tried to push Harry into drinking the tea gently, "It is a special recipe, Dobby is teaching it to Winky before he died. Dobby is teaching it to Winky to help the children last year."
Harry said a quiet goodbye to Kingsley, before reaching for Narcissa, taking her hand and squeezing it tightly. "I'm sorry about your husband-" She cut across him immediately, "Mr. Potter, I am sad for what has occurred, I am not grieving a man who did not love me enough to protect me from a maniac or keep our son from harms way." Harry looked to Draco for his response to her uncaring statement, but he looked unbothered and distant. Harry's heart ached, here were two people who needed a family's love as much as he did. He knew they had no one. Harry had never had a kinship with a Malfoy before, but felt it acutely as he stared at the elegant hand resting in his.
"Sliced him up with a spell before Mother could get her wand up," Draco shuddered, "Then Anja turned on me, Mother stepped in front of the curse. It was a Wasting Curse, it takes your magic, your mind and then your life."
"That's amazing, Ron. Of course I will," Harry grinned, feeling a little hopeful for the first time since the accident.
"For me too," Justin joined in, "The idea of learning to harm someone - even to help myself - I just don't think I can do it."
Hermione appeared in his Floo, her face creased with worry, "Harry, you've been sleeping - ever since..." Harry sighed, his old Floo had been dropping out lately.
Ron complained loudly and smacked George for putting him in a headlock. Ron didn't seem to mind Draco at all after he came back, knowing he'd kept Hermione from being hassled by playing "boyfriend" and Draco had become Ron's favourite chess opponent. Draco knew his commitment to George and Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes had gone a long way to building that relationship. Draco turned his attention fully back to George and Ron, interjecting a point about the potion the orb could hold to provide the smell.
"How did you go on?" Harry's words interrupt Draco, midway through a sentence about the shortage of powdered horn of Bicorn.
Draco immediately felt warmed after his first mouthful of soup. "As wonderful as I remember as a girl, Kreacher," Narcissa commented kindly. Draco thought if anyone praised Kreacher further, he might explode with happiness. Andromeda placed her spoon down and looked at the two boys opposite her. "Draco, your mother and I have mended our rift, I hope you will feel comfortable calling me Aunt or Andy, as your mother does. You too, Harry. We might have come together under awful circumstances, but we are sort of family and we can support each other." Narcissa placed a hand on Andromeda's arm and smiled warmly at her sister.
"Sounds right," Draco stared at the laughing Hermione, covered in pink glitter from a cracker that George had handed her.
Six months ago, Draco had announced he was joining the new dating service 'Wix Wish' and Harry had panicked once more. Ron spent weeks slowly pushing Harry towards telling Draco how he felt. He'd set up a lovely dinner of Draco's favourite meal (fettuccine Alfredo) and was wearing a new shirt. Draco had breezed into the kitchen, accepted the glass of white wine and gleefully told Harry that he'd met someone
"It's difficult, facing these demons," Sergeant Parrish announced at the end of their session, "There's a lot of anger and hurt here, but you all share it. You're all so young, you've got too much life left to let this win. See you next week, same time."
"So, er. You know what that is. I, er, I really like you. Well, I guess that's not correct. I mean - I love you. I've loved you for more than a year now and I know this is shit timing because you're with Celia and you seem really happy but I want to court you. Actually, I want to marry you and forgo all the dating but I think that would be a bit soon and er, Draco?" Harry breathed in deeply and regretted it, the winter air biting his lungs.
Draco nodded, "Healer said you would hear most of what was being said, even if your brain didn't know how to place it in context."
The group of girls who had returned was even smaller, only Hermione, Pansy, Padma and Parvati had returned. He knew that others who had survived had either applied to sit their N.E.W.Ts without the full Seventh Year or changed schools. Lavender had barely survived Greyback's attack, she was living in Hogsmeade and doing her studies independently. The Patil sisters spent every weekend with Lavender, Justin and Blaise walked them to the village every Friday afternoon.
George jumped up abruptly, dropping Pansy to the floor, "Sweet Morgana's nipples, Fred, we bloody got 'em! We got the date!" Pansy grumbled as she stood up and congratulated him on his win before shoving him back into the chair and wrapping herself in his arms again. Ron groaned and then laughed, "Happy birthday George, and I suppose next year we'll be wishing Harry and Draco a happy anniversary too." George's eyes sparkled as he grinned back, "I don't mind sharing the day, and I don't think Fred would have either."
"Starting a huge garden," Neville strolled over, "Draco is training to be a Potions Master and I want to work in Herbology. So we're going into business together."
Draco had inhaled sharply at the mention of fire, but he hesitantly reached out to take Harry's hand. The warmth settled the fear in Harry's chest somewhat, but he was still unsettled.
Hermione hugged Molly and Arthur goodbye as they headed through the Floo to join Andromeda and Narcissa at Grimmauld Place. Kingsley thought that it was best if they said their goodbyes before heading to Kings Cross, the returning students could arrive just before the train left and spend minimal time being gaped at on the platform. Hermione turned her thoughts again to how their family had pulled together in the aftermath of the War. Molly could be found most afternoons laughing and crying in the Grimmauld kitchen with Hermione's mum, Andy and Cissa. Arthur and her dad had taken to walking Teddy around the gardens of The Burrow, talking to him about the plants and delighting in his hair changes when he saw different coloured flowers. Ginny and Neville had roped Harry into redoing the small garden at the back of Grimmauld, smearing dirt over each other and pelting each other with flower bulbs. George and Draco threw themselves into Wheezes, Draco filling the role of potions expert and surprising font of obscure magical theory. Ron and Hermione helped in the shop during the months before George had hired full time staff. She had overhauled their inventory system and Ron had a surprising flair for creative displays.
"Because of the bomb," Seamus still looked pale, he and Dean were inseperable since the incident. They were sitting together, hands clasped tightly.
. Free of that horrifying caricature of a human being, free of his slavery, free of him turning their family home into a slaughterhouse. He knew there would be more pain to come - a trial, public outrage, sentences - but even Azkaban was a safe haven compared to what his home had become in the last two years. He felt acutely out of place here, crouching where the Hufflepuff table usually sat. Draco breathed in the heavy air of dust and ash, the acrid smell of blood filling his nostrils.
wand and promptly pulled it out of his sleeve and handed it to him. He inclined his head towards Harry in a bow as he accepted it, his eyes were tightly shut and his mouth a thin, trembling grimace.
"I've loved you from the moment you beat me to the nursery to soothe Araminta in the middle of the night." Draco's words shook Harry to his core and made him question the last three years.
Harry steps out onto the floor and sees Susan standing near her desk. "Susan, what the hell happened to me?"
Kingsley remembered himself after a moment and coughed lightly, "Alright, you are free to go." He gestured for the Auror to hand Malfoy back his wand - Harry was finding it painful to think of him as Draco after seeing his arm - but Malfoy handed it off to his mother. Harry remembered that he still had
"Babe, where you been?" 'Tony' spoke from the kitchen steps, "Swear to Salazar, if you been with that whore Jamie again!"
"It was obvious. Your 'eart beats for Draco." Fleur gave Harry a misty smile, she was very fond of Draco.
The first floor must have changed. "It used to be the coldest sitting room," Narcissa commented. Now, there was a lovely master bedroom with ensuite taking up the floor, Narcissa's traveling trunk at the foot of the bed. "Well, this must be my room, let's continue, shall we?" On the landing of the second floor, Draco immediately realised this would be for Andromeda, as there was another lovely master suite with an attached nursery, filled with blankets and soft toys. Andromeda took Teddy into the nursery to change him, Narcissa followed her sister and gestured for the boys to continue upstairs.
Draco made to stand and leave, Harry reached out and snatched his wrist. "N-no, can you..." Harry desperately didn't want Draco to leave him alone. Draco considered Harry, frowning slightly as he took in Harry's flushed cheeks and nodded, "Do you mind me sitting in with you?" Harry flushed beet red and shook his head, hoping his tan skin didn't show the colour. He knew he was pale from months of hiding and running, but might be dirty enough for Malfoy not to notice. Draco stripped without any embarrassment and sunk into the tub opposite Harry, knocking his knee into Harry's and turning to turn on another tap.
" Hermione tried to dodge the curse, not having much room with the wall right beside her. She heard Nott laugh and realised she'd not been hit. "Looks like Draco caught the hero bug, lucky Mudblood!" Hermione dropped to her knees, Draco had been slashed across his torso when he'd jumped in front of her. "No, shit, Draco, why?!" Hermione vaguely remembered a first aid course from summer of Third Year. She pushed against his bleeding chest and tried to hold the wound together. Nott was laughing maniacally and raised his wand again.
Kreacher looked astounded at Harry's lack of manners and pulled back into a bow, "Master Harry, Kreacher is living to serve the Noble House of Black. Master Regulus always wished for more books so Kreacher was honouring him, just as Master Harry is being telling Kreacher." Harry smiled at Kreacher, "Yes, I'm so happy you have honoured Regulus, I hope you will do me the favour of taking his old room for yourself? Draco and I don't want to sleep in his or Sirius' rooms." Kreacher scrunched his face up in a horrible expression of grief and began wailing, "Oh, Master Harry, you is being improper, Kreacher cannot be having a room which belonged to Master Regulus!"
"I'm Sergeant John Lee Parrish. You can call me Sergeant, John or Mr. Parrish. Whatever is most comfortable. You know why you're here," the tall American wizard was dressed casually, but his military background showed with his crisply pressed clothing and neat hairstyle.
It was another week later that Harry had found himself in Draco's bed again, this time after a nightmare where he was watching Draco burn to death in the Room of Requirement. He kept nudging Draco with his leg to make sure the boy was still alive and next to him.
"It took me a week to convince my son to pick himself up off the floor of his flat and stop drinking himself into an early grave," Narcissa could have cut glass with the tenor of her voice.
Harry woke up panting, the sweat drenching him already chilling his skin. He huddles into his blankets, pulling the grey sweater from under his pillow and pressing it to his face. The smell of Draco was long gone, but the feel of his expensive cashmere anchored Harry to the present instead of his haunting dream. Harry shuddered with sobs, the bed shaking around him with the force of his grief.
Harry relaxed and deepened the kiss further, before pulling back to rest his forehead on Draco's and let out a shuddering breath. The noise in the room then became too much to ignore.
"That I'll never be able to walk through that office again without wondering if I'd done something different, would Gin would still be here? You're right, as usual." Harry felt his throat close up and the tears threaten to return.
. "I'm sorry for other things too. I wish I'd been brave enough to talk to you in Sixth Year instead of just trying to kill you. Wish I'd taken you with us after that night at the Manor. Wish I'd taken your hand in First Year."
"Would you, would you both stay with me? Just while you're finding somewhere new to live since you've donated the Manor, um, if you'd like..." Narcissa relaxed her mask into a small, genuine smile before speaking, "Mr. Potter, you aren't obligated to do more for us-" Narcissa was interrupted by a loud cry, drawing Harry's eyes over to where her sister was trying to comfort a squalling baby while talking to the Medi-Wizards removing Tonks and Lupin from the Hall. Harry frowned at the sight of a struggling Andromeda trying to stand tall while holding his screaming godson. Harry didn't think to let go of Narcissa's hand as he rushed over to Andromeda.
"Draco, Narcissa, Andromeda and Teddy are going to be staying at Grimmauld Place with me. I'd like you to come over whenever you like. You're my family, too." Hermione started again at Harry's
require a bath." Harry smiled wanly at the insult, an echo of their past. "Yeah, let's go home." Harry followed the two sisters out of the Hall, marvelling at how Malfoy had become Draco so easily.
"I think I don't need the full year," Harry tugged Draco closer, "But I do need somewhere to live, because I've given Grimmauld to Andromeda."
Hermione placed her head on Harry's shoulder, "Do you think you'll ever rejoin us in the land of the living, Harry? Your goddaughter needs you to be up and about before she arrives."
Draco was a maelstrom of emotions, his grief and anger at seeing his father laid out dead before him warring with the relief that they were
"Yes, although I've heard a little bit of what I'm missing and..." Harry fights another wave of nausea.
Draco and Harry had been raising their kids together since Ginny died. Harry had never gone back to Ginny's and his house in Devon, he'd gone from the hospital to Draco's house and just never left. Two years after Ginny died, Harry had realised he was deeply in love with Draco and had a complete meltdown. He'd been extremely rude to a bewildered Draco and spent two days on Hermione and Ron's couch before he went home. Draco had never pressed to know what had upset Harry and they fell back into their comfortable routine.
Draco turned to Harry, with an innocent expression on his face. "Now... I believe you said something about getting married?"
"I'm asking Hermione to marry me, you promise you'll be my best man? I can't do it without you standing up with us, it's always been us, mate," tears were dripping down Ron's long nose.
"Draco told us you've recovered your memory to the moment of the curse, but nothing after," Hermione comments.
Molly sniffled with watery eyes before pulling Harry into a smothering hold. "You are always welcome in our house, Harry. You're as good as my son and you always will be." Harry nodded into her shoulder and pulled back, fixing a kiss on her cheek as he did. "George, can I get Teddy? We're going back to Grimmauld now." The family looked shocked at Harry's casual
Harry had just watched the man he loved take a curse for his best friend. The monster in his chest roared for revenge, Harry drew his wand and threw a violent
"Five minutes to talk, then I want him to take this," Healer Gurjeet handed Draco a Deep Sleep Solution and hustled the medi-witch out of the room.
The snow storm howled outside the windows as Draco hurried through the corridor. November had arrived abruptly, bringing with it the coldest winter Hogwarts had seen for a long time. He looked down at his watch, he still had an hour before the Library closed. He had a permission slip from Professor Flitwick to access some books in the Restricted Section for Wheezes, he and George were working on some therapeutic products to extend their post-War comfort line. Clutching his cloak against the chill of the castle, he hurried through a tapestry, taking a shortcut that Hermione had taught him. If he got the restricted books quickly, he could grab a few of the romance novels that Madam Pince had recommended after she caught him and Hermione reading a Victorian novel instead of studying.
"These are colour coded, green to begin, moving onto orange and then black," Luna instructed. "We're going to start with the green ones."
"Thanks," Draco sighed, "I'm sorry about yours. I did regret making fun of you about their deaths, especially now I understand how it feels."
"Oh, cock." Harry groaned in realisation that this was her first sign of accidental magic and Draco wasn't here to see it. "He's going to blame me for this, y'know."
Hermione and Ron stood and went to find Bill and Percy, who had ducked away from work to try and catch some of the trial. Hermione handed Draco the jar of flames and tugged on a loose lock of hair as she left. Draco was incredibly fond of Hermione, he was glad he'd had the chance to move past his bigoted upbringing and see her as she was - bloody brilliant. Draco passed the jar along to Luna to hold, Harry relaxed his arm and wrapped it around Draco's waist. Draco tried not to seem too pleased as he squashed in closer to Harry to enjoy the warmth of the flames.
Harry keened at the thought of Draco inside of him, Ginny had taught him that he had a rather sensitive prostate and he couldn't imagine wanting to top and miss the opportunity for that stimulation. Draco pressed a few more kisses into the base of Harry's throat before clearing his own.
"Hermione is coming... She'll... She'll go through it all." Draco pressed his hand on Harry's shoulder and left it there, his daughter burbling nonsense while Harry cried noisily.
"No, all fine. We missed you though. Did you enjoy your evening?" Harry tried to keep the wistful expression off his face while watching Draco and his daughter.
"Good idea, there's a huge amount of ambient magic in the soil now," Bill tapped his wand to his chin, "It's not malicious but it will certainly do better with somewhere to channel itself."
She had gone after Harry with Ron as soon as she realised what Snape's memories had meant, but they were waylaid fighting Death Eaters who had hidden during the ceasefire. Hermione knew Harry was dead when she saw Molly crumple into Arthur, destroyed by the sight of a second son dead within hours, a son who had not been born to her but was as loved as all the rest. Hagrid's tear streaked face had told Hermione that her life and the life of everyone she loved was about to end.
"Oh, he took a leave of absence from the shop. He's been helping Kingsley manage your workload. Kingsley is a godsend, came out of retirement just to fill your shoes. Ron has been spending time with the Aurors, trying to work out who I should promote if you don't want to come back..." Hermione gave Harry a teary look, "You know I would hate to lose you but... I just thought..."
Harry leaned against the backrest of the bench which Ginny and Neville were slouching on. He took a sip of his lemonade and smiled, Teddy was cuddled in Pansy's arms while she and George talked to Hermione and Ron, Teddy's hair changing colour depending on who was speaking. Harry looked around for Draco and spotted him talking to Andy and the Grangers. Harry wandered over to the group, taking Draco's hand. Casting his eyes around again, Harry spotted Molly and Arthur kissing through the kitchen window and blushed at the sight. Kingsley and Narcissa were sitting at the long table with Fleur, Bill, Charlie and Percy. Bill's hand stroked the side of Fleur's stomach, Harry knew they had started trying for children and were hoping to be blessed soon. Matias and Luna were conjuring lights for after the sunset, discussing Heliopaths as they went.
Harry stiffened and then started to speak confidently, "Kreacher, I order you to take Regulus' room, as your Master." Kreacher immediately stopped crying and nodded sniffling, "Of course Master Harry, Kreacher will honour his Master's request." Draco squeezed his hand on Harry's shoulder,
Ron wrapped an arm around her shoulders, subtly weighting her wand arm to lower. "Harry, mate, he needs to rest. And it would be best if he could rest without fighting around him, yeah?" Harry looked desperately to Andy and Hermione's mum for support. Narcissa was the one who spoke up, turning to face Harry with Teddy. "Harry, I know it was an accident, but I admit, I'm very upset with you." Harry hung his head, Hermione felt the smallest part of her anger ebb. She knew that Harry regarded the Malfoys and Andy has his family now too. It would hurt him to disappoint them. "Cissa, I'm so- I- I can't tell you how sorry I am, I never meant for him-" Tears were quietly dripping off Harry's chin, he couldn't speak further. Narcissa moved to kiss Harry on his temple. "Harry, you're still a part of our family. It hurts more because of that. Why don't you take Teddy and introduce him to some of your friends, I'm sure they'd be delighted to see him. Bring him back in an hour or so." Harry accepted his godson and nodded, sniffling. She watched Harry leave with a small frown on her face.
I should just be grateful we're alive and they're still by my side. After the nights I woke up screaming in the bed next to them... Well, thank Merlin they're better friends than I deserve. I wonder if Madame Pomfrey will give me another lot of Dreamless Sleep. Doubt it, she's so worried I'll get addicted. I don't know how to tell her I have the nightmares anyway, it just stops me from moving and screaming so that other people aren't bothered by it.
Harry chuckled at Hermione's wide eyed expression and muttered, only loud enough for her and Draco to hear, "Yeah, weird at first when he does it, isn't it." Hermione looked at Harry with new curiosity. Harry made it sound like Draco spoke to him frequently without words.
Ron tried the door to the classroom, finding it locked. Neville blasted down the door of the classroom in a flash of light, immediately knocking out two of the students who stood too close. Hermione entered immediately, beginning to duel with a Seventh Year that Harry thought might be on the Quidditch Team. Harry took down another Sixth Year, turning to where Draco had crawled to his wand, still blindfolded and bleeding from his mouth. Hands shaking, Draco slowly turned around, facing Harry with his wand raised. Harry Stunned another Seventh Year girl and caught Draco's mouth moving, wand still pointed at Harry. Light formed at the end of Draco's wand and Harry reacted without thinking, "
"I'm fine, I slept okay last night," Harry opined. His body was sore though, like it was after too much overtime.
"Get out, get out of my house. I remember nothing about you, I remember being with Draco and being cursed and now I have no idea what happened for the last five years," Harry's throat was dry, "Please, I don't know you, could you just get out?"
Harry looked over at Draco at these words and felt a pang of kinship. They'd been put on opposite sides by the very people who should have shielded them from all the horror.
Draco watched Nott flick a curse at Hermione and had no time to think of anything clever, he simply threw himself in front of her and hoped he'd get there in time. As he felt the blood pumping out of his chest, Draco felt eerily calm. She was safe, his friend 'Mione was safe. He'd never been brave enough to use the nickname out loud, but whenever she gave him one of her stern talks he'd thought it gleefully.
"Er," Harry looked at Draco's face, which was flushed pink, "Thanks." Harry got comfortable and pulled the covers up over the both of them. He slipped back into sleep without really thinking through the fact that he was in Draco Malfoy's bed.
Draco looked up to see his mother, aunt and Harry staring at him with astonishment. He half shrugged, "Babies want very few things, I took a chance on food." His aunt gave a watery smile. Harry nodded absently and handed Draco the now calm baby, and turned back to Kreacher, "Um, Kreacher, how is Grimmauld Place? Can we, can we live in it?" Kreacher looked proud as he turned to Harry and bowed, "Yes, Master Harry, the House is being most welcoming to guests, Kreacher removed all the scum intruders weeks ago and has been having help from his Elf friends here to prepare it for when Master is coming home." Harry thanked Kreacher and told him to make sure he rested after the battle, as he was a hero too. Kreacher bowed again to the group and Disapparated with a loud crack.
"Celia's taking a Portkey to Bologna tonight. It will just be me at home." Draco arched a brow and Harry remembered too late that Draco had already told him this.
Andromeda shakes her hand, her sister stepping up beside her to examine it, "Luckily, I am not so much of a lady as my sister."
Harry pulls out of the memory and he's distraught. He feels the press of panic in his lungs - he cannot live with everything he's done. He places the tip of his wand under his chin and cries out, "
Harry had a problem with his sexuality, maybe he was just uncomfortable because they'd shared a bed most nights before Draco went away. Both of them had consistent nightmares after the funerals had started and it was easier to sleep with the warm weight of someone else beside them. They'd shared so many secrets in the quiet hours before dawn, Harry had told Draco about his cruel Muggle relatives and Draco had shared how his arm had been carved up by Death Eaters as revenge for not taking the mark and failing Voldemort so many times.
"Well, I happen to know a wizard who will have plenty of spare rooms in three months time," Draco was still staring at their feet.
Harry sat up and yawned, he would fall asleep if he laid down any longer. Pansy looked over at him, "Alright Potter, if we're boring you? You can do this quiz with me." Harry chuckled, "Right then Parkinson, what's the quiz." Pansy shot him a dangerously evil smile, "Well, Potter, let's find out 'What Kind of Man is For You?'" Harry flushed and glanced at the back of Draco's head. He hadn't acknowledged their conversation at all. He nodded at Pansy to begin. "Okay, Potter, first question. What are you most drawn to in a guy? A - his smile. B - his eyes. C - his clothes. D - his car." Harry thought for a moment, "Well, only person I know with a car is Arthur, and his car is running feral in the Forbidden Forest." Pansy laughed. Harry continued, "So I guess it would be his eyes." Pansy moved on, "Okay, when you like a guy, how do you get his attention? A - flirt with him blatantly. B - become his friend and get to know his deepest secrets. C - ignore him except to give him sexy looks. D - tell his friends you're interested." Harry thought it over, Ginny yelled out, "It's B. Harry couldn't flirt if he tried, and he's never ignored anyone in his life. Case in point - Harry and Draco for years one through six." Harry blushed and nodded at Pansy, who smirked knowingly.
Healer Gurjeet leaned in to Harry, "You should be improving by now. I don't understand what is happening."
Molly swooped him into a crushing hug, "I'll be by with dinner later, something healthy but comforting."
Draco sent a gentle Episkey to the lip and perched on the edge of the bed, "The stinger went through me but the barb caught you in the hip. None of the poison went into me but you received enough to put you in a coma. You managed to kill the fucking thing, though. Didn't know you had Avada in you, but here we are."
Harry had barely left Draco's side since Madam Pomfrey had released him. Draco had forgiven him using his Legilimency and Harry ached at how much he'd missed Draco communicating with him secretly. Hermione was still unhappy with him, but was helping him with homework again. Ron and Draco were currently playing chess in front of the Common Room fire, quietly discussing what Ron should get Hermione for Christmas. Draco pressed his ankle against Harry's knee, a reassuring pressure that he was okay. Harry was still drowning in guilt for his part in Draco's assault.
Draco could hardly believe it when the weather started to turn, summer faded into autumn all too quickly. The last few months were both the happiest and saddest he had ever known. There was so much grieving to be done, wounds to heal, apologies to make. Draco smiled fondly at George and Ron, arguing at the table in front of him about Safe & Sound, their newest product. Draco looked at the sketch in front of him, the orb coloured in his mind with gentle blue lights. The Safe & Sound was their newest post-War offering, it aimed to provide a bubble of protection for sleeping. The orb would provide a shielded area with calming coloured light and sound that felt uniquely comforting to each user. George and Ron were arguing about the inclusion of a smell component.
Tony threw the mug of tea at Harry's head and stormed out. Harry fixed the wards so he could never come back, headed upstairs and cast an Incendio on the entire bed. He stomped into Sirius' room down the hall and crumpled into the bed, sobbing for the life he had lost.
"Harry, Draco won't leave you. I need you to fight harder for your life," the healer began, "I didn't want to try this, but I have no choice."
"Well, I asked you to give me a year after school to sort myself out," Harry reaches out to tangle their hands together.
"Potter, Draco tells me you're back," Pansy gave Harry a look she hadn't fixed him with since school.
"Are you alright? I think you ought to rest, don't you? You've been here long enough," Healer Gurjeet pressed the back of her hand to Draco's forehead on her way out the door.
, Draco vowed. Harry had drifted off to sleep, Teddy snoozing on his chest. Narcissa and Andromeda shared a small smile and gestured to Draco to take Harry up to bed. Draco carefully picked up Teddy, and handed him off to his mother, before scooping up Harry and quietly wishing his family goodnight.
Once they'd finished their soup - and lavished more praise upon an extremely grateful Kreacher - they moved upstairs into the sitting room. His mother and Aunt Andromeda were quietly going through photo albums over tea. Draco and Harry slumped into a sumptuous leather couch, Draco was reading a Potions book, while Harry had Teddy cradled into his chest and was murmuring things about Teddy's parents. "They were so brilliant Teddy - your mum was the coolest Auror I've ever met - and your dad, he was... He was one of the closest things I had to a loving parent. They were so brave, they loved you so much but they had to help make a world for you to be safe in."
Draco pulled her into a tight embrace, mindful of her distended stomach, "I will owl you if he so much as twitches, Granger. I promise. I'm sorry I couldn't protect him. I'm so sorry."
"I sleep all the time, I think I got fifteen hours last night. I just don't feel rested," Harry replied.
"I know, I'm sorry, Draco..." Harry wasn't able to get more words out before Draco shoved him away and stormed off towards the children playing Quidditch.
"We're not ready, for forgiveness," Hermione told him. Harry nodded in response, hanging his head. "We will be doing anything Luna asks of us to help your recovery though."
Hermione felt her heart clench. It was all over, Harry had fulfilled his role, which meant they could finally feel everything they had put aside during the War. And suddenly, all Hermione felt was anger at Dumbledore's manipulations and planning. She pushed the anger aside, they'd come out victorious and mostly in tact. Harry smiled over Ginny's head, "You better go Gin, but I'll see you soon okay?" Ginny smiled back and walked past Hermione, over to where Harry had been looking at Neville and his grandmother. Harry turned to Ron and Hermione, pulling them into a hug so tight Hermione felt her throat catch.
Draco's face must have fallen because the healer placed a hand on his shoulder, "You should not feel guilty, this was not your fault. You could not save him from this."
"She's wrong. She's dead wrong. I can even tell you the moment I realised I was hopelessly gone on you. You'd brought me a cup of tea, unasked, at the exact moment I was thinking that it was time for one. You put two ginger biscuits on the saucer, because you know I don't like sweet things with my tea. I was about to say 'I love you' in response to that and I panicked because it was true." Harry swallowed and reached for Draco's arm, to turn him around.
"I need to leave, get him to St. Mungo's for a check up," Draco's voice is in the hall and Harry hears the front door slam.
She leaned forward and Harry's chest exploded into pain. The last thing he saw was a blurry vision of Draco's silvery locks surrounding bloodshot grey eyes.
"Just go, please," Draco commanded, "I have two caesarians booked this afternoon. I don't have time for this."
Harry followed his eldest child towards the Floo and was stopped by Draco with a hand on his wrist. "Harry, what is going on?" Draco's eyes (always Harry's favourite feature) were wary.
Draco turned to Harry and smiled, Harry felt his breath hitch, Draco had never looked at him so openly before. "Thank you Harry, I can't tell you how much I am in debt to you for your actions today." Harry still couldn't find his voice after that smile, so Malfoy continued, "I can't apologise for everything without taking up a week of your time, but, for what it is worth, I am sorry and I hope to repay your forgiveness." Harry grinned and gestured towards the two Black women, "Er, lets head off?" Draco nodded, still smiling gently and rocking Teddy in his arms as he followed Harry back to his family.
The sight was incredible to behold, magic crushing the Manor in on itself until nothing remained but a large patch of smoking dirt.
"I don't accept your apology, purely because you don't know the extent of it," Luna's voice was even, "We can revisit an apology at a later time."
"On the 2nd March 2000, Trainee Aurors Harry Potter and Susan Bones entered the Duffield Mansion to help with clean up of a crime scene. The place had been used by smugglers of dangerous Dark artefacts. Trainee Auror Potter cast a detection charm on a cupboard which showed no danger. He opened the cupboard at the direction of his training officer, Senior Auror John Dawlish. Trainee Auror Potter overestimated the strength used and pulled the cabinet onto himself. It is estimated the cabinet did minimal damage to the Auror, aside from six cracked ribs, however serious curse damage was done by an Australian fire opal with some type of memory curse which resulted in Trainee Auror Potter losing all memories of his life thus far. Trainee Auror Potter was admitted to St. Mungo's at 09:47 in the morning and was pronounced stable with retrograde amnesia with no hope for recovery," Draco read from a file in front of him, "Of course, we'll have to amend the prognosis. What time did you wake up this morning?"
"You faced Dementors again at fifteen and then were put on trial for saving yourself from them," Draco looked at Harry with sadness, "Then all of you had to face my father and his shitty friends at the Ministry."
Harry made a whimpering sound and shoved his face into Draco's neck, breathing in the smell of his cologne, something spicy that had an undertone he could only describe as
"Mr. Harry Potter, sir, Winky is bringing you tea to help you sleep again," Winky held up a bright yellow mug filled with steaming liquid.
Sneaking another sidelong glance at Draco, who was fondly smiling at George while he pulled Ron into a headlock, Harry felt another wave of irritation wash over him. The monster in his chest had been pacing and snarling for weeks. Harry sighed, he wasn't going to to calm down sitting here with everyone. Pushing off while grabbing the cradle, he grunted a goodnight to everyone and headed upstairs to put Teddy to bed. He heard light steps behind him, sighed again and faced Hermione. She put a finger to her lips, gesturing to the sleeping baby. Harry activated the nursery charms to his wand and headed upstairs, following Hermione. She wandered into the library and cast a
Harry felt the tears prickle his eyes as he heard the echo of Draco's voice. He'd never again hear the blonde's lazy drawl, the irritated sniff when someone brought baked goods to work when he was on a health kick, the low timbre of his voice going over their plan of attack.
Harry woke up abruptly, it was past midnight he realised with a jolt. A shining lynx stood before him, Kingsley's voice addressing him, "Harry, he's awake now." Harry scrambled to his feet and got ready to run, before realising he had no idea which room Draco was in. He rushed down the hall, catching sight of the lime green robes of a Healer. "Oi! Excuse me, please!" The Healer turned back to Harry and he found himself staring at Penelope Clearwater. "Oh, Harry, are you looking for your family?" He nodded mutely. Penelope smiled and checked her parchment, "Room 4, down the way you came and right at the cactus." Harry raced back the way he came and flung the correct door open.
Healer Gurjeet grabbed what looked like two small irons and placed them near Harry's bare chest, "Keep your hands clear."
." Harry looked to Draco, confused as his father's corpse disappeared. Kingsley spoke up, "May his soul know peace," before quietly telling Harry, "she has returned him to his family crypt."
Harry turned to Draco's mother and aunt, "Er, Grimmauld is your family's home, would you like to come stay?" Narcissa looked like she was going to protest again, but Andromeda gripped her hand and turned to Harry, "Thank you Harry, we've been staying in an Order safehouse since before Teddy was born, it would be nice to be somewhere familiar," she looked at Narcissa and smiled, "and with family once more." Draco nodded, "Mother, I think with Harry and Andromeda would be the best place for us." Harry gave Draco a weak smile, and gently squeezed his cousin's foot through the blanket before placing his hand on Draco's lower back. "I'm just going to go see the Weasleys, and then I'd really like some food and sleep. Come with me, Malfoy?" Draco nodded and followed Harry to the flaming haired family, dread in his heart.
"Kreacher," Harry called out, Kreacher popping back in front of them immediately. "Yes, Master Harry?" Kreacher waited for his direction. "Er, I'm so sorry to bother you again, but we're going to head back to Grimmauld now, I wonder if you could go get some things for Draco, Narcissa and Andromeda?" Kreacher looked delighted to so wholly serve the Noble House of Black, "Of course, Master Harry," and quickly received requests from the three others on what they would require. Kreacher bowed and promised he would meet them at Grimmauld Place with their belongings.
Harry belatedly noticed that they had reached the family, trying to focus his senses he saw that Ginny was clutching Neville's arm. Neville's lips were in her hair and he seemed to be whispering words as she stared down at Fred's body. Neville looked up at Harry, fixing him with a look that was determined but also - in Harry's mind - apologetic. Harry nodded absently at Neville and half shrugged to himself. He hadn't considered that Ginny would have moved on in the year apart. Harry knew though, that he had changed fundamentally and he couldn't love her as his past, more innocent, self had done.
Hermione sat back down next to Draco, taking his hand in hers. "Hermione, I appreciate your protectiveness of my son, but I think you're punishing Harry a little too much," Narcissa placed a hand on her shoulder. Hermione sighed, looking at Draco's bruised cheek. "Draco was so awful when we were younger. But we spent three weeks struggling to get my parents memories back together, just us. He's the reason Mum is sitting with me right now. I just... He was scared and he couldn't see. Draco would never turn his wand on Harry knowingly. I'm so angry at Harry for not recognising that Draco was just trying to cast a
"You're so thin, are you eating? Are you drinking enough water? When was the last time you properly slept?" Molly was fussing about him.
"I'm going to go collect Teddy," Andromeda pressed a hand to Draco's shoulder, "Molly is probably tired of him by now."
"I was an idiot. I panicked. I knew I'd found men attractive, but it was an abstract thing. I'd never loved one. I thought I'd never love anyone after Gin died. I ran to Ron and Hermione's and after a day they managed to get it out of me. Ron told me I was a right tit and that no-one was going to begrudge me for falling for the man who'd become the second parent to my kids. Then Hermione tore into me about leaving you like that and I felt so guilty I stayed another night." Harry stepped closer to Draco, who was still watching him like he was a circling basilisk.
Draco tried to sit up, and was immediately pushed back into his bed by a strong hand, looking up he caught Andromeda staring back at him. "Andy? You're dead too?" Draco swallowed the lump in his throat. Nott must have taken out his whole family. Andromeda scoffed, "Good Godric, Draco. You're in St. Mungo's and I regret to inform you, neither you or I are dead." Draco breathed in a sharp breath. "Hermione?" Andy nodded over to a chair in the corner where Hermione was sleeping in Ron's lap. He sighed in relief, she looked fine, if a little peaky. "Nice save, Draco." George Weasley winked at him from beside Ron, where he - interestingly enough - had a sleeping Pansy in his arms.
, but the rest of the family just murmured goodbyes and see you laters. The Weasleys all moved towards the Entry Hall, ready for departure. Ginny caught Harry's eye and jerked her head to the right. Harry took the hint and handed Draco back his cousin, "Go back to your mum and Andromeda, I'll be there in a moment." Draco wandered away, a curious look on his face that Hermione wasn't sure she interpreted correctly.
They slowly descended the stairs, stopping twice more for kisses, before rejoining their family in the dining room. Harry flushed deeply at the knowing looks both Hermione and Narcissa gave him.
"It's er, really bright, huh?" Harry wanted to smack himself. All of the things he could say in this moment and that was what he chose.
"I have questions, mainly when did you all know about... my feelings for Draco?" Harry looked particularly askance at his children and Draco's.
Draco Malfoy hurt quite a bit. Not physically, he was pretty sure Madam Pomfrey had filled him to his eyeballs in pain potions. No, Draco was heartbroken. He had been sure he was going to die alone on that classroom floor, beaten and tormented by Slytherins who resented him. Then he had heard fighting, he was sure it was Hermione and Neville, Ron's familiar shout coming a few moments later. Draco had felt hope, they had cared enough to come after him. Crawling his way over to where he was pretty sure his wand had been thrown, he felt the familiar hilt fit into his hand and tried to spell away the blindfold. It wasn't successful, so he set about casting a Shield Charm, to keep him from more injury until his friends could restore his vision. Moments later he heard Harry's shout of "
A Muggleborn sent Malfoy a bomb. A fucking bomb, to a fucking school. It's common knowledge he's at Hogwarts - didn't they think about the others who would be injured? I'm so relieved that Marcie is okay. She told me I was her hero. At least I deserve the title this time. I don't think I'll be able to save these robes though, they're covered in her blood.
"There's a lot of pain you're all still carrying, but take it from a man who willingly signed up for war: none of you should have been put in the positions you were," Sergeant Parrish eyed Harry as if he was going to argue, "In my country, you cannot sign up for service unless you're eighteen years of age. None of you should have been forced to fight in a war, fight each other."
Draco stared at Harry as if he was an imbecile and tugged on his wrist, leading Harry over to his bed. Draco pulled back the covers with one hand, climbed into the bed and yanked Harry until he fell into the bed after him.
Harry smiled at Draco, the moment interrupted by the loud clearing of Celia's throat. Harry cheerfully wished her a 'Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year' and stepped through the Floo to Hermione's library.
"Thank you, Draco. Er, can I?" Draco nodded and ducked his head, while Harry worked out which tap was the hair potion. He was more nervous as he started to run his fingers through Draco's hair. It was longer than he'd let it grow at school, Harry marvelled at the silky strands slipping through his fingers. The hair turned from a dull silver to bright white when Draco ducked his head again in the water to rinse it. Harry stared at Draco's chest and froze. Draco must have noticed the hesitation because he grabbed another soft cloth and some cleansing potion and started to scrub his arms.
." His mother fixed Draco with a sharp look, he knew she was making the same connection as he did regarding Harry's past treatment. "You are so thin I could snap you with a hug, you must eat, please Harry," Narcissa ordered him back to his seat. Harry smiled at her and immediately complied, knocking his elbow into Draco has he threw himself into his chair. Draco broke off a piece of bread and buttered it, immediately placing it in front of Harry's face. Harry must have understood his silent request because he shoved it into his mouth and began chewing it. Satisfied, Draco settled in to eat his dinner.
"I just... Can I fix anything? With anyone?" Harry looked into the faces of the two people who had always been on his side.
Harry looked up at the afternoon sky and spotted a Hogwarts owl with a large bundle of letters heading their way and nudged Draco. Hermione took the letters from the owl, Ron feeding it a piece of sausage roll while Hermione handed everyone their results. He watched her hands shake violently as she opened hers, before freezing and staring at the letter in shock. "All O's, bloody hell 'Mione," Ron laughed at Hermione's gobsmacked face and kissed her on the cheek, "I passed everything, O in bloody Defence too!" Harry snuck a look at Draco's, "Draco got all O's too. I passed, got an O in Charms and Defence!" Pansy, Ginny and Neville chorused affirmation of good grades, Luna smiled serenely and destroyed her letter in a cloud of rainbow glitter without opening it, to Pansy's great amusement and Molly's abject horror.
Hermione laughed, Luna was dancing around The Burrow with baby Teddy, who was wearing the shocking yellow and pink paisley onesie that Luna had brought him for Christmas. Molly wanted to save Christmas Day for just the family, but Christmas Eve the Weasleys had decided to cram everyone they knew into the house for a party. Kingsley was booming with laughter beside Narcissa at something Arthur had said. George was talking to Pansy and Blaise in the kitchen while lobbing cocktail onions at Percy. Charlie and Matias had brought home a tiny, ancient Chinese witch for the day, she was showing Molly a charm which folded napkins into dragons and kelpies.
Where the fuck am I? There's a witch in ugly green robes... St. Mungo's? Why am I here? Hermione's in the bed next to me at least. I don't know how Ron's sleeping like that, surely his back hurts? I get it though, he'd not leave Hermione's side for anything right now. I want someone to stick by me like that.
Harry thought the fare served by the St. Mungo's cafeteria was pitiful (even compared to the Ministry of Magic), so he ducked out to a Muggle coffee shop down the road. He returned with several cups of tea and coffee and an array of pastries. Draco didn't accept any food, but he did drink a large cup of black coffee. The three of them watched the door for another agonising few hours before an exhausted and very apologetic witch came out and took them to a private room to confirm that Astoria would not be able to be saved.
Hermione had been awoken from her light doze by a slamming door. Looking up she saw Harry throw himself on Draco and then kiss him. "Fuck me,
Harry looked up, his one open eye blurry without his glasses. The blob definitely had ice blonde hair and considering the voice was male, it would have to be Draco. Draco approached him and set a smaller, blonde blob down next to Harry on the bed. He felt a tug at the hospital gown and Minty hoisted herself closer to Harry's face, her small cheek pressed against his neck and her warm breath tickling his beard.
Draco's sitting with his arms crossed in the chair he used to occupy in Harry's house. "I see you're still alive."
Harry grinned back at her, "I know, Draco forced me to take a sleeping draught last night because I would not shut up about it and just sleep."
The howler exploded into pieces, sprinkling over Harry's half eaten dinner and leaving a deafening silence in the room.
Harry was staring at the fire in the Eighth Year Common Room, thinking about Draco Malfoy. They had been back at Hogwarts for months and Draco had barely spoken to him. He still heaped food on Harry's plate when he thought Harry wasn't looking, still made sure Ron and Harry went to bed at reasonable time, still wrapped a blanket around Hermione if she fell asleep studying. Draco clearly cared for him but he was spending a lot of time with Ginny, while Harry had bonded with Luna and Pansy. Harry sighed and stared up at the purple ceiling of the shared Common Room. If Harry was being honest with himself, which he didn't like to be, he knew he was making the rift between himself and Draco worse by being moody.
"You did what you could, you couldn't protect him any more than you tried to," Andromeda squeezed Draco's hand, before pressing her other hand to Harry's covered leg, "He will come back to us. Teddy, we should go."
He took a sip, the sweetness of the mallow-sweet and honey cut by the earthy taste of the camomile and the lavender.
Draco took it gratefully and thanked the Elf. He shifted his cousin from Harry's shoulder to the crook of his arm, ignoring Harry's shock at Draco touching him so casually and prodded the screaming infant's lips with the nipple of the bottle, "C'mon, you need to eat if you're going to scream Hogwarts down all day." The cries quieted and Draco looked into eyes that rapidly changed from brown to grey before hearing the quiet suckling noise coming from the baby's throat as he drank. The baby's hair was flickering between brown and green, Draco suspected the baby was a Metamorphmagus, a trait from his Black heritage.
Harry was just about at the Floo when he caught sight of something violet coloured on the coat rack - it was a travelling cloak at looked remarkably like Draco's. Black damask silk on one side and the violet lining with patterns of oriental origin. He blinked rapidly, remembering the day Draco had come to work with it for the first time.
Harry was left alone in the dark with his cup of tea and his bewilderment at the weird behaviour of house elves.
Luna said decidedly while pulling a strand of Draco's hair, "Draco, you've got a Wrackspurt or two I think." Draco smiled at her fondly, "Thanks Luna, I might do." Draco's head turned at the sound of the door opening. Harry stepped up to his bed carefully, looking between Pansy and George like they might attack him. "Er, I wonder if I can talk to Draco for a moment?" Harry was going to tear the hem of his jumper if he kept twisting it like that, Draco mused on the nervous movement.
"I promise Ted, as soon as Harry is better, we'll take you to Disneyland," Draco held up his pinky to the child.
Draco had remained very still while Harry was speaking but upon Harry's use of his name he looked up to Harry with a furious expression and Disapparated.
"Finally, you're here. Right, all of us under the influence have had a Sobering Potion and we are ready to accept orders!" Ron was swinging around a large water bottle and saluting Harry when he stood up to brush the ash off his jeans.
Hermione noticed Harry leading Malfoy towards the family and gently nudged Ron. She knew this was going to be a difficult conversation. "Harry, mate, we're going to head home soon," Ron greeted the pair with a strained smile. Molly and Arthur looked up and realised that Harry wasn't alone. "Er, everyone's met I suppose, but um, this is my godson, Teddy Lupin." Harry chewed his lip and watched the family stare at the bundle in Draco's arms. Draco shifted the baby so they could see him more easily, Molly reaching out and stroking the soft hair on Teddy's head.
Ron looked forlorn as he sat with Harry at the kitchen bench, "Mate, it feels like you're already gone. I don't want you to die. I miss Fred."
Harry stepped forward and caught Draco's chin with his other hand and tilted it up until he could look into his eyes, "I think I'd like to be in the master, actually."
"I'm not sure, but I don't think so." Harry realised the room was listening in and sighed before reciting the story loud enough for everyone to hear.
Harry thanked them again and exited from via the Floo. He sunk to his knees when arriving at Grimmauld, his chest bursting with pain and grief.
"Of course, it is important for your mental health to try to rectify errors of your past. You must understand though, others are not beholden to accept your amends, they can choose to refuse. This is important for
Harry woke up gasping, the burning of his scar in his dream a phantom in the dark. He rubbed his hand over his forehead and tried to shake off the dream about Voldemort rising again and killing the rest of the people he cared for. A soft pop startled him, but Winky's kneeling form beside him held out a placating hand.
"Well, I'm going to build a new house," Draco pointed over at a large expanse of ground, "Near the Quidditch pitch there."
"I'm sure he's just enjoying my undivided attention," Draco tried to sound sarcastic, but he just sounded sombre.
"Don't go around killing yourself out of some kind of cowardice, I don't think Molly could handle it," Draco snaps.
Hermione was drying him off and Ron was fetching Harry a drink when Minty toddled over to cling at Harry's leg. "Daddy, where's Nana and Papa?"
"Of all the things I've done while I was - not me - abandoning Teddy feels the worst," Harry groans.
Hermione stood up and made her way to Draco's bedside, he turned to face her, slipping his spare hand into hers. "Draco, thank you, you saved my life." Draco gave her a small smile, "I had to do something. Who was going to compete with me for the most N.E.W.T.s if something had happened to you, 'Mione?" Harry, Ron and Pansy all objected halfheartedly to the implication that they weren't an academic threat. Hermione felt her heart melt. She knew Draco using her nickname was his way of telling her that she was important to him.
"It's musty in here, let's get these curtains open," Molly flung her wand at the curtains, allowing daylight to shine in on Harry's slumped form.
"Sorry, it took a little effort to find it!" Andromeda took a seat next to Rose and looked at Narcissa expectantly.
Ginny didn't question why her husband was suddenly home on a Wednesday afternoon, she simply drew Scorpius into her side and whisked him upstairs to Albus. Harry had paced for a few minutes, carding his hands through his hair before Ginny sighed and told him to check up on Scorpius' family before he wore a hole in their carpet. He Apparated into Hermione's old office at St. Mungo's (and apologised to the terrified Mind Healer and her client using the room) before demanding a passing Mediwitch to give him the Malfoy family's location.
Hermione heard the doors to the Hospital Wing open, a familiar mess of black hair caught her eye and she stood with her wand pointed at his chest. She registered the hurt on Harry's face and gripped her wand tighter. Harry was her brother, but Draco had barely survived Harry's Knockback Jinx. She was consumed with how devastated she had been to have to re-inflate his lungs after Harry broke all of his ribs. Harry looked miserable and drawn, like he hadn't been sleeping. "Er, 'Mione, I just... I just want to know how he is." Hermione's temper flared again. Draco hadn't woken up yet, between the damage from the Slytherins' attack and Harry's Jinx. "He's alive, Harry. You nearly took care of that though."
Hermione and Ron were torn between supporting Draco's relationship and supporting Harry's dislike of it. The rest of the Weasleys all fell on the spectrum between being ambivalent about Celia to not minding her, hence her invitation to the annual Christmas Eve party. Harry was coping with this intrusion with the comfort that she was not invited to spend Christmas Day with the families and an enormous glass of Firewhiskey. Narcissa caught Harry's eye across the room and jerked her head towards the kitchen. Harry extricated himself from Ron's drunken embrace and dodged a stumbling Bill (being scolded by Fleur).
"I don't know, my son taking you back for the second time and then you fucking one of his friends in your bed so he would discover you deliberately was pretty atrocious," Narcissa replied, "He rightfully was furious with you and you then put him in the hospital."
"But - I love you? I would never l-leave you," Harry stammered, "Was it too much? Me not knowing you?"
"Mr. Shacklebolt," Narcissa's elegant voice quietly began, "with Lucius dead, Draco is the new Lord Malfoy..." Kingsley immediately responded to Draco, "Yes, ah, don't worry about the impact of Lucius on your inheritance, you will not be punished by your fortune being-" Kingsley broke off at the look on Mrs. Malfoy's face. Narcissa cut in coldly, "I assure you, that was not what I was endeavouring to discuss. We do not wish to return to Malfoy Manor, not ever again." She looked at Draco, who minutely nodded before she continued, "We would like to donate the Manor to the Ministry. Please use it for those displaced by the War. Give them somewhere to call home, even temporarily. Our House-Elves were safely hidden from the Dark Lord. They shall remain with the Manor to help provide care for the occupants."
are going to discuss things that worry us together!" He sighed, "Sorry, 'Mione, I just... I don't like being talked about."
"Harry." He slumped into the purple chair, sighing loudly, "No. I got rid of the booze in my house after hearing about the Ginny thing. I'm just not sleeping very well."
"That would be Tony, who according to Molly is your latest - boyfriend," Draco's anger broke through the mask briefly.
"Kreacher, I wonder if you would mind making us something to eat, simple but comforting? Perhaps your chicken soup, it was always my favourite as a girl." Draco turned and realised his mother and Andromeda must have been standing behind them during their exchange, he had forgotten they were there. They were staring around the room with barely disguised wonder on their faces. Andromeda gestured up the stairs, "Let us find some rooms, shall we?"
"Meanwhile, I haven't left your side, I always complete your reports for you, I accompany you to all of those social events, so what does that say?" Draco hummed into Harry's ear.
Kingsley was considering the group carefully, while the other Aurors seemed to be either confused or furious at what they were witnessing. Hermione knew something was happening in Kingsley's mind, he was musing on something. He spoke carefully after a moment, "If neither Mrs. Malfoy or Mr. Malfoy have taken the Dark Mark, they will be free to leave of their own volition." Hermione's breath caught, she was sure Mrs. Malfoy hadn't taken the Mark, but Harry had always been adamant that Draco had.
Hermione was still shaking with anger. She couldn't believe after everything Draco had done to build relationships with them, the second Harry saw Draco point a wand at him, he had cursed him. It had been three days and Hermione was no closer to letting go of her anger at Harry. Andy and her mum sat knitting together, while Narcissa stared out of the window of the Hospital Wing with Teddy cradled to her chest. Ron was carefully shaving Draco with a charm, Hermione had brushed his hair after Madam Pomfrey had used Cleansing Charms to bathe him.
s more. She couldn't cast a very big Shield though, so she had concentrated it over Draco, surmising that only he would draw Nott's fire. "Look at you, strutting around the bloody town like you own it with the Golden Mudblood." Draco bristled beside her, Hermione knew Draco hated the word now, it reminded him too much of hateful past insults.
"Actually if you'd asked me to imagine Ronald's childhood bedroom, it is exactly as I would imagine." Draco's voice was detached and cool. He wasn't facing Harry.
Draco cradled Harry like a newborn child while Healer Gurjeet assisted him to sip water, most of it sloshing down his chest.
Hermione was annoyed. She had been ready and waiting in the living room of The Burrow for an hour. Ron was gathering last minute items that she had
"Draco, you were very fortunate, for things to work out as they did," Narcissa's gentle voice broke into his grief, "Harry would be upset if he saw how tired you are, risking your recovery."
Ron sat up and cracked his neck from side to side, "'Mione, did we fall asleep? Oh, sorry love. Let me get you home."
Draco turned to Kingsley and handed him a ring that Harry had once seen on Lucius. Draco pointed his wand at the ring and intoned "I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, Lord of House Malfoy, hereby bequeath the Ancestral Manor and all grounds to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Ministry of Magic, and remove all claim to the property." The ring glowed and then splintered into ashes in Kingsley's hand. "The wards will allow any magically registered employee of the Magical Law Enforcement to enter and the Manor will protect those they deem welcome." Draco and Narcissa turned to each other in an embrace, and the other Aurors began to wander off to other parts of the hall.
