Harry let out a laugh, which always manages to plant a smile on Draco's face. The wind was getting slightly stronger by the minute, so they decided to warm themselves inside the castle. Harry helped him down before walking back to the empty hallway. Well, at least they thought it was empty. "Where do you think you're going, Malfoy?"
"It's 1995 for goodness sake!" Hermione exclaimed, which made both Harry and Ron laugh. "People should learn how to mind their own fucking business instead of being an utter and complete douchebag"
Blaise doesn't smoke. He's just there to accompany her when she needs to smoke. It's such a muggle thing to do but it works. Her family can be tight around the edges—kinda reminds me of someone I know. Even if Blaise and Draco don't smoke, they were nice enough to accompany her every time she needs to, which usually happens when she's nervous to meet her family again.
"Second of all, yes. I understand." Harry said, continuing to play with Malfoy's soft hair. Not a lot of people are allowed to touch his hair. In not a lot he means like, only himself. Harry's an exception because he loves when his hair's being touched. By Harry. Not anyone else.
Harry chuckled and left their gaze, looking down at his untied shoelaces. Maybe Ginny can help him with it. "I've been meaning to tell you guys about this for a while, but I'm just... too scared, I guess. To admit it"
"Truth hurts, doesn't it?" Hermione grinned cheekily. "Fuck off" Ron uttered, which made the group laugh in unison. If only things like this happen to everyone in this world. Life would be a lot less fucked up.
Tired of this goddamn conversation, Ron rolled his eyes and tugged Hermione's arm. "Come on, Mione. I can't stand being near this git" He snarled, turning away to face Harry. "Good luck, mate"
Harry eventually calmed down and sighed. "Yes, thank you. Don't let the rumor cause you to think like this. I've been your friend for five years, the least you can do is trust me"
said that he loved him out loud. Wow, who would've thought? Harry giggled and turned back to the marble-like sky. "The view from here is magnificent, innit?"
Before he realized it was coming from the window next to his bed. He turned around and smiled in surprise, "Draco?"
, both planting their gaze into each others' eyes. "I'm gonna miss this." He added, brushing the hair from his boyfriend's face with his thumb.
Harry smiled thankfully while Luna smiled softly, "Yeah... But wouldn't it be cute though if they were together?"
"O–Of course" Draco nodded. He turned his head around, smiling tightly at Harry. As if he was asking for a wish of luck that everything will turn out fine—or a safe passage to get the fuck out of there. Same thing.
The Slytherin stayed quiet for a bit. "Haven't talked to them. I just... hope they're not too... judgy" He sighed and stopped, burying his face in his palms. Harry turned to look at him with genuine worry. He didn't reply. Instead, he held him close, kissing his temple gently. Letting his embrace and the slightly cold air help Draco find comfort.
"You two have been fighting again, haven't you?" Ron speculated, arms in both of his pockets. Harry rubbed his neck, "Maybe?"
He tilted his head and was confirmed that it was Malfoy. Hagrid didn't seem to mind and smiled widely, "Ah! I see what you mean there, Harry. I'm gonna let you two do what you gotta do. I'm off!" He announced before making his way to Dumbledore's tower.
"I agree." Ron nodded as if he just got blessed by a priest's sermon. "But now that we know you are gay, be honest with me," He looked at his friend dead in the eye. Harry chuckled, "Okay?"
"Uh, sort of," Pansy said. "She won like 793 Wrammys and 129 Wizards Choice Awards, which is not bad for a long-time witch singer like herself"
Harry chuckled, watching as Ron bludged himself into the sample and Hermione playfully glaring at him and telling him to stop. Without looking back at Draco, he teased, "You know what else you look hot eating?"
"I'm pretty sure he had a better 20 minutes with me than 5 years with you two" The boy shot a smirk. Hermione didn't bother to reply when he noticed Harry's flushed face and not so tidy hair. "Harry, what happened to your face? You look all... flushed."
"Just trying to get through your lie, Potter." His voice balancing Potter's, both attempting to intimidate the other.
Which Hermione took to heart. "Honestly, Malfoy. If you aren't dating Harry, I probably wouldn't dare let you go near me"
Harry got up to fetch a spare book on the rack. They were dusty and old like Dumbledore. Before reaching for the cleanest book he could find, he noticed someone standing beside him, possibly getting a book as well. He noticed the shiny black pair of shoes and coughs lowly. "Hello.." He stretched his word.
The war wasn't that bad. People overreacted on it but the war that happened far away from a school district filled with underage wizards was actually not that bad. It was like watching American Football, but with magic.
"Say that one more time and I'm gonna push you off your broom" Draco replied. Harry laughed and flew to the other side of Draco's broom. "So, are you nervous about tomorrow?" He asked.
Harry can't help but smile, "You idiot! Of course not. I trust him to do the right thing. I hope" He looked back at Neville who was just blinking. He sighed and walked up to him, "Can you please promise not to tell anyone—even Hermione and Ron? We really don't want people to know yet—"
Professor Sprout chuckles as she spelled the cards back into a pile. "You can't expose him like that, Voldy"
"Oh yeah, at least my crush liked me back. How about you, Malfoy? Couldn't impress a guy enough for them to take you to Hogsmeade?" He forced down the slight cringe at the irony in his words when he spoke.
"I need you to put a little trust on me, Granger Weasel." Draco spotted, "I'm letting you two interrupt my date with Harry—"
Thanos has been unconscious for five days now with no sign of progress. Thanos' parents tried to sue the school and the Malfoy family, but none were to be exact. The case is still going on and Draco felt as guilty as ever.
this scene in the movie is so boring so we're gonna spruce it up with some Drarry. Which we all deserve.
Draco laughed before pulling him to a short sweet kiss, pulling him closer and wrapping his arm around him. "Come on. Let's buy some chocolate balls! My treat." He said with a smile. Pansy smiled widely, "Really?" With Ron equally as excited. "That's the best thing to come out of your mouth, Draco," He said, standing up and walking with the rest of the three to Honeydukes.
The so-called bully blushed at the touch. He looked up and smiled teasingly, "Nah, I don't think so"
The two spent the entire night talking about mostly random stuff. The silent giggles at night didn't seem to disturb any of the other Slytherin roommates. It was a useless conversation, but they adored each other's company.
Snape and McGonagall jumped a bit at the sudden sound from the back. They let out a breath of relief once they saw it was just the iconic Albus Dumbledore. "Severus' favorite student is bullying your favorite student" She informed the headmaster.
on to talk." She smiled slightly as she placed down her very interesting book. "You came to the wrong person, by the way. But I'll give you two options." She continued to explain that one being a bloody Gryffindor and actually ask Draco. Or second, wait and let Draco win his bet for the sake of protecting his dignity and crush embarrassment.
"The rumors are true then. I knew something was going on between you two. I just didn't know it was true. S–Since when?"
"In our defense, it takes two to play chess," Dumbledore said. He saw Harry and Draco with Snape and he smiled. "Ah, our two beloved students. What have you two rascals done this time?"
As if it's normal, he walked in and rested his wet damp hair on Draco's lap as the latter continues to read his book. Something Harry's particularly very fond of — not that he would ever admit it.
It isn't Draco Malfoy if he isn't about checking Harry out. He bit his lower lip before commenting, "Oh my! Is it Halloween already?"
"Listen to me, Draco. I know that we don't have the best father-son relationship. But I'm gonna try. This is me trying" Draco smiled tightly. "I don't get it, I don't understand. But if that's who you are, if that's what makes you happy, then so be it."
McGonagall continued, "I thought there was no way you two were together so the three of us made a bet. I obviously lost the moment Snape told us about... well, what just happened. So it's left between these two"
"Come on guys, we haven't got all day" Harry reminded them, looking through the window. "Why did you have to promise Snape for her autograph anyway?" Blaise finally asked.
"Yes, yes" Neville nodded quickly. "I promise I won't tell. I'll—I'll just pretend I never saw you two.. holding hands and almost making out in the library—oh my god"
Granger laughed again,  "Yes, Harry! I won't!" Turning again to Ron, who quickly gaped them. "Of course I won't as well! Unless it's like... Draco Malfoy or something like that," Ron and Hermione chuckled.
He rolled his eyes, but even with that, he can't hide the blush on his cheeks. Harry planted another longing kiss as if he hasn't done it in the past hour or so. "Draco..."
They watched as she took another and another before she realized they were still standing there. "I guess I owe you guys something in return" She sighed and turned to her house-elf, "Give me the tickets for tonight"
Hermione nodded, "Yeah. This whole house drama is dumb from the beginning. It's great to finally befriend Slytherins now"
"Okay! Shut up!" Ron and Hermione said in sync, which made Harry laugh louder. "Oh my god, Harry!" She rubbed her temple. Seeing Harry still laughing, she grabbed her notes again and smack his head from across the table. "It's not funny!"
Draco took a step forward and strutted like Britain's Next Top Model across the long hall. He felt every eye staring at him. But he didn't mind. He continued walking like the god he is.
up high. He turned to her and pointed, hoping she's just asking to go to the loo because other than that, he's not sure if he has the answer. "Uh, yes. You with the hair. What do you want?"
That nameless bitch couldn't care less if the powerful wizard kid is standing right beside him, hence he moved closer. You better not kiss him, you son of a bitch. "I always knew you were gay for this lunatic." He scowled, turning to Harry as he speaks. "Fooking fag—!"
They woke up knowing damn well this won't be another usual day of Harry and Draco's hetero adventures. People are still shocked after the events of yesterday. There's just a lot to process. Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter are gay. They think they hate each other but instead takes each other as a date for the ball. Was there a secret dare Draco pushed Harry to do or vice versa? Were they actually friends this whole time? Are they just
"No, please. Let me finish," Draco said, sitting criss-cross in front of Harry on the carpet. He licked his lips inadvertently before continuing. "I was as surprised as you when your name popped up. I confronted them and it was true, they did put your name in the goblet of fiyah by asking a senior to do it for them. I didn't know why I didn't tell you this to you when we went to see the dragons the other day. I guess, I just didn't want you to stress more of the fact that you're gonna be facing a real-life flaming death threatening dragon, plus a group of pressed teenagers with ex-death eater parents that wants you dead"
"Promised Snape?" Blaise furrowed before having to be explained again by Hermione. The group looked back inside the pub. Ronald scratched the back of his head, "How can we get in?"
Draco knew about this and crossed his fingers hoping that his gay best friend would somewhat take control of her actions. Especially when Lavender came whispering to them how her cousin has been fancying Draco, like a lot. "That blond guy over there looks smashing hot, don't you think?"
"I don't know" He whispered back. Voldemort sighed. "Come on, Severus. We're helping a kid out today" He snapped his fingers and pointed outside.
The tone sounded more of excitement rather than disappointment. Way different than they expected. Both blushed, not exactly knowing how to react to that comment. They share the same brain cell. And that brain cell keeps telling they're gonna get fucked even more in the teacher's lounge.
Lucius chuckled quietly and nodded. Looks like Draco's not the only one holding back tears. "Yeah, me neither." He smiled. A smile Draco would kill to see again. "It would probably take me some time, to fully understand everything, but it must be said. You are my son, no matter what. And if children are supposed to be the ones proud of their fathers, well, I am proud to be Draco Malfoy's father"
Ron mumbled a short apology before the muggle-born turned to Harry, eyes turning softer. "You know you can tell us anything, right?" She said carefully.
"To me! Not to you." Harry said, "At least, since this year. He makes fun of me more than anyone else — or just me. Because I told him if we're gonna make this work, he's gotta stop making fun of others and being a dick"
"I thought you already had one this month—" Ron's comment made Hermione glare before Harry realized what he meant and smacked the back of his head. "Ow! What?" Ron looked at them while rubbing the back of his neck.
Honesty, love. You should've known. He owns these walls. So don't you even thinking of fucking with him. Harry's an exception.
"Just take it," Harry whispered to his boyfriend. Boyfriend? I really don't now. But it's enough to make Draco obliged and tentatively tries a spoon of the red stew. He's like me, we both wouldn't want to try something that doesn't look visually appealing — Harry being solid proof.
The latter groaned, "Ugh. Fine!" He would then stomp away towards Draco's room and change into one of his shirts.
Not caring about the table separating them, Harry cut their distance as he pulled Draco into a kiss—which made Draco smiled and kissed him back hungrily like a fucking monstrous prick.
The class stayed quiet. He furrowed and flopped his arms back down. "Why do you all look so depressed? You know what, I shouldn't have asked" He smiled widely and asked again, "Miss me?" He scanned the room before landing on the golden boy, sitting in between Ron and Hermione. He smirked and walked closer. "How about you, dear? Miss me?"
But they weren't the only ones laughing. Draco walked out with his friends, laughing at some stupid joke Pansy told them. The wrinkles by his eyes when he laughs sent butterflies in the pit of Harry's stomach—or it could be the pudding he ate earlier, but still, it's cute.
Harry can't help but laugh, cheeks reddening slightly as he looked down at his feet to stop it from ruining their show. Draco also pulled back a smile. "I don't have time for your incompetent DADA skills, Malfoy"
"The next day, I think he felt awful or as confused as I am and he didn't say a word. He didn't tease anyone. He didn't make fun of me every damn time like he always did. He was just, awfully very quiet. That wasn't until we ran into each other in the hall. He was first to call me and asked if we could talk. We did talk that night, he apologized and shit like that but we didn't talk again after that. He was less rude, but he's still poking around like his usual self. Which I actually felt weird about it"
It's true. I'm not saying the Slytherins might feel a bit of a gay vibe between their Slytherin Prince and The Chosen One, but they kinda felt a gay vibe between their Slytherin Prince and The Chosen One. "I'm sorry again for my friends."
"But it's just weird, isn't it?" Ron furrowed, "What if he's just doing that to use you and kill you and feed you to his death eaters—" Ron rambled before Hermione nudged him by the hips once she noticed Harry laughing at his own little prank. Bitch thought he did something.
Blaise? She was the one who introduced Malfoy to Blaise. He is also very nice. He's the little calm in the storm of this duo. You know, like the countless times they sneer at idiot students passing through them in the hallway. Blaise was the one who had to drag them away so they won't get detention. You need that type of friend, I'm telling you.
"Yeah, it's not." She agreed, "It's not our problem who you want to take to the dance. If it's a girl or a boy..."
"Mr. Malfoy" Harry spoke like the heroic motherfucker he is. Lucius' head still stiffs as he turned back at his gay son. "May I speak to you, Draco? In private."
They were so caught up with their jabbering that they didn't realize the hush plotting behind their backs. "How about this?" Ginny came strutting towards them after a talk with Pansy and Blaise. "Let's make a challenge. The first one to ask their crush out on a date to Hogsmeade wins"
"And super taken," Harry replied, remembering the time they were in the lake. So, the thing is, the Triwizard Tournament ended four days ago and this Friday, they would end the Tournament with the Yule Ball — which includes handing out the prize to the winner of the tournament.
Harry laughed as he punched the air as if it had upset Draco. "Yes! Now that is what I wanna hear!" High fiving him which caused him to smile widely at his reaction. "I will go to the dance with you, Harry Potter" Potter smiled at that. "But in one condition,"
"So I figured you guys knew about it?" Harry asked, now with breath steadied back to normal. Both nodded. "We had a feeling you are," he paused, "Gay. So once Hermione and I thought that maybe you might be into guys, she went searching on how best to support gay friends"
Harry smiled softly and understanding, "I understand. Not that I understand fully, since my parents are well, dead," Draco chuckled. "But yeah, I get it." He smiled before pulling him into a chaste kiss, one filled with hope that maybe one day this could happen outside their little rendezvouses. They let go after a minute, resting their foreheads on each other as Malfoy whispered with a smile. "Dick"
"Oh, so would you, darling. I'm pretty sure no woman — or man — would ever want to spend a night with someone like you" Draco tucked back his smirk before walking towards the nameless bitch. "Listen here, you piece of shit. Your words mean nothing to me!" He spat, taking his time at every. goddamn. word. "Fucking git"
"I will kill you, Draco, if this plan of yours fails" Hermione grunted, following Draco and the others as they snuck their way behind the pub. It was the most disgusting smell ever. It was like an old-beer-like smell, but worse because of the big opened trash bin some idiot just shoves against the wall, letting the melted snow flood the inside of the bin.
Draco couldn't care less about her sitting next to him if it wasn't for her slight bicep massage that made Harry furrow and Pansy ready to slice her throat. Erika then continued to offer Draco her bowl of almond nuts.
Harry smiled smugly. "Honestly, Malfoy. I'd love to ruin that white pale face of yours," Draco almost dropped with a smile, but stopped once Harry moved closer, eyes darkening and voice deeper. "But I have better things in mind that I'm sure would make you fall into your knees"
And just in time too. Voldemort came strutting in, letting his extensive cloak cover the tracks behind him. His face was visibly tired after teaching children the whole day. He was too tired to debate when Dumbledore asked if Voldemort could be in charge of detention but the second he saw the room, he sighed in relief. "Oh, it's you two. Thank goodness" He said, plopping himself onto a chair.
"Where's your date?" he whispered again. He wasn't sure if his date ended being with Malfoy, which is why he wasn't asking for him. But unlike Albus, Voldemort and Snape already knew. "Where is he?" Voldemort whispered to Snape.
All three stopped laughing and looked back at him, realizing he's still in the room with them. Snape looked down as Dumbledore bit his lip, making weird hand gestures. "Well..."
Harry Potter being Harry Potter actually won the goddamn life-killing tournament. Not much of a surprise there. But now that he's the winner, picking a date for the ball is a pretty big deal. For they would be the one to start the whole ceremony off with a dance.
"Well, you don't have much of a choice do you, Malfoy?" Hermione chimed in, crossing her arms and lips pursed. Their petty conversation
"You wish, Weasel Prat—" He gritted his teeth. Face moving closer as Ron stepped back. He realized Harry was glaring at him and sighed before
"You're making assumptions, Hermione" Harry stated firmly, "I know who he is. He will never hurt me" You dumbass Harry Potter. Ron and Hermione turned to him and furrowed. "Know who he is?"
Harry nodded, preparing to take a leap of faith like Miles Morales. "You got the potion?" Hermione asked to make sure. Ron feels like he's still back home with his mother. Harry nodded, "Yes."
He smiled widely and laughed, "I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. Yeah, you're right. I'm gay. But also not gay. Because I still like girls—"
Okay, Harry, calm down. Calm down. He used his wand and went swimming up to the surface. Victor Krum from Durmstrang quickly swam from behind. Well, he assumed it's Victor Krum because he's a shark now. He cut open the rope that's holding his girlfriend down and quickly swam up after Cedric and Harry, followed by Fleur Delacour and her sister.
Ron, Hermione, and Harry had just finished class and wouldn't be in one until the next hour. So they decided to sit down and talk in the courtyard, a bit of fresh air after being indoors for so long. They sat down at a lower edge of a stone wall and laughed at something Hermione said.
Cedric reminded him of the time before he swam away with his bf—his Hufflepuff bf. BF could stand for boyfriend or best friend, it's up to you.
"Just say it's not true, Harry" Ron said, kinda hoping it's not. He doesn't like that Malfoy continues to make fun of his family, so that's understandable. Even though these past few months he's only making fun of Harry specifically, but still.
"Who lives here?" Hermione asked, trying to see if she can find her moving or something. "Madam Smolbum." Draco replied, "She used to be the Black Family's housekeeper until she fell sick. My mom decided to come and take care of her to pay her in return"
"Listen to that, Potter? She's talking about you" Ron turned to Harry who was also gleaming with laughter. "Of course, she is" Harry scoffed sarcastically.
Harry laughed again. Hermione shook her head with a small smile on her face. She turned to Harry and asked, "So, what does he think about going? He's okay now? How about his friends? Do they know?"
Harry laughed. "Don't worry, I ruined mine years ago" The hero smiled at Draco's light giggle. They eventually decided to just skip breakfast and spend the morning outside. It was the weekend anyway. Most of the students would be in the dining hall or their rooms, so the outdoors felt like it was made just for them.
Both laughed. Harry watched as his boyfriend took off again. His pale white skin matched the glowing bright stars as his hair caresses the wind. It was a very calming view. If only he had a camera with him right now to capture this moment and hang it up across his porta-potty. So he can stare at him while he shits. "Why so slow, Potter?" Draco stopped and shouted from afar, snapping Harry back into reality. Thanks a lot, Draco. "Still thinking what you would do with your life once I'm dead?"
The hot attractive trio talked the whole night, joking and making fun of Hogwarts—as every student would do when talking about their school. It was nice to finally talk to his friends, now that he has nothing to keep from them. Yeah. It felt good.
"What is wrong with you and periods?" Hermione looked at him, arms crossed. Roon shook his head, "Nothing. It's weird. It's science. I love science" He said before continue eating.
Harry couldn't go to sleep that night. He was too nervous about tomorrow. Fucking Yule Ball. Dancing in front of a crowd — and with his mortal enemy would be the talk of the century. He was dramatizing on that part but it still would be big news. Yet, his night might turn around.
"Hah! Yes, I won!" Everyone turned as McGonagall got up from her seat and excitedly squealed in delight. Snape gasped and snaped at her, "Betrayal!"
"But Harry wouldn't look like this if Snape were to have a baby with Lily," Hagrid added, sitting down next to Madam Hooch. "Most of Harry's features were from James"
at the clear sky above them. No pollution, unlike the city I live in. Draco stopped next to him. He watched as Harry stared at his view. His view was Malfoy, by the way.
Okay, he totally did not think they would say that. He looked down. "Geez, thanks" He started fiddling with the hem of his shirt, Hermione and Ron noticed. "It's not really our place to do," Ron said, looking at his bestie.
He shook his head and turned around, ready to get the fuck out of there. "We're sorry!" Blaise quickly said. Draco stopped in the stairs, his back facing them. "We're sorry for what happened a few days ago. Can we please... talk?" He pleaded, much softer this time.
"Okay, come on" Ron pulled her away before dark Hermione appeared. Dancing with her away from Harry and Draco. "But she's right though!" Ron
"Don't mention it. But next time, I suggest you use a Silencio spell. Okay?" He smirked and walked away back to his room in the castle, leaving both the boys flushed in embarrassment.
Harry blushed, pressing his body closer to Draco. "Ooohhh!" Everyone turned to Voldemort. "Plot Twist!" He said from the audience. Both laughed. Harry shook his head
Draco coughed heavily and shaking at the cold air touching his skin. Harry reflectively scooted over to Draco, holding his shoulder, trying to help him get warm. "Hey, hey. Are you okay?"
He watches as Draco stopped in front of him and sat down, arms resting on the table. "What are you doing here?" He asked with a smug smile, knowing damn well that shouldn't be a question. Draco smiled, "Can't I steal my boyfriend for a while?"
"Oh, right. This story happens in 1995." Harry said, before realizing his boyfriend is already a few feet away from him. "I'm starting to think that big mouth of yours is slowing you down" The yelp boyfriend shouted. The cold night air muffling his voice.
"And instead look like Severus?" McGonagall pointed at him, "Oh, Salazar bless us all" The room laughed. Snape furrowed and pointed at himself, "What's wrong with this?"
"I know. I'm sorry" He mumbled against Harry's greasy brown hair. "I know you can think of something" He encouraged him.
Draco looked back at the redhead sitting on the wall. "Huh! Would you look at that? I think you got yourself a new boyfriend" His comment made his friends laugh, bringing other people's attention to them again.
"Oh my god! Harry! Why do you have to do that, you dramatic arsehole!" Hermione slapped his knees, making him laugh louder.
The main character chuckled, "Right. So, I was so pissed off, but mostly to myself for even letting it in on that. Mind you, I wasn't even sure I was into blokes. At all. So, I spent my night... crying myself to sleep"
Draco rolled his eyes. "Oh, save it, Weasley. Might as well question the moral grounds of all of Slytherin. Trust me, you won't like them"
While that shits going on—leaving people there a bit hard which I'm pretty sure there's a good amount of people who have been conspiring something about them already—these two professors couldn't help but watch them from the Great Hall's entrance.
"Is she always this mad at everything?" Draco turned to Ron, who just kept quiet the whole walk round. Draco was the one who led the group to the back. Standing close by him were Ron and Hermione. While Harry was talking with Blaise and Pansy—which seems to me has better improvement than Draco with his friends. Possibly because Harry doesn't really have a history with Pansy and Blaise before Draco, while as his boyfy over her does. He was punched in the face by Hermione for fuck sake.
He asked if they too snuck out like they did. In which reminded Hermione of the deal they made with Snape. "Then let's go" She pulled Ron away, eyes travelling inside every store and restaurants. Harry invited Pansy and Blaise who eventually agreed to join whatever they were up to—and that is ducking under a pub window.
Snape shook his head, still watching them from next to Dumbledore. "They honestly have the weirdest relationship"
Harry furrowed and looked up from his bowl, "Okay! Can I ask? Which Lily are you always referring to? I can't help but notice Professor Snape's quite... fond of her?"
It was weeks after scene two when they were in Hagrid's hut. They continued the days like normal. Draco hangs out with his friends, Harry hangs out with his. And at the end of the day, they would sneak out and spend the rest of the day with each other. Talking about what they did, which mostly started with Draco apologizing over and over again about what
"At least I made an impact" Harry chuckled before he stopped his broom. He took and deep breath and sighed
"Hi, Hagrid!" Hagrid jumped slightly and smiled when he saw Draco suddenly appearing in front of him. Hands tucked behind his back, smile as innocent as it gets. Harry wasn't expecting him to be there and was surprised when he heard a very familiar voice from behind Hagrid's tall figure.
There lived a boy named Harry Potter. He is very well-known in the wizarding world because well, he's The Boy Who Lived—even if he has always been dead inside.
Everywhere he'd go, people would ask to take a picture or ask for an autograph from the golden boy. Except for when he's at school. Everyone knows him, but not everyone is as big of a fan compared to the people outside the walls of Hogwarts. In their eyes, he's still one of them. He's pretty much a loser. Especially to the eyes of a particular young wizard, Draco Malfoy.
"Thank you!" Voldemort said, "Now if you'd excuse them, they would like to go back to their dorms, please" He held their shoulders. The headmaster nodded, "Right. You may return to your dorms."
"Bisexual." She explained, "It means you like both men and women. I looked it up while I was searching about — well, Ron already told you that"
"You're insufferable, you know that, Potter?" Draco breathed heavily, plopping his back beside Harry. Breathing as heavily, Harry managed to let out a chuckle, "That's not what you said earlier today"
"Are you two playing wizard's chess without me?" The long-haired professor quickly commented when he saw the wizards chess on Dumbledore's table. His face looked like he just got cheated by Lily with a hot, tall, messy, dense Gryffindor boy.
"It's Hermoine, Professor Voldy—" Harry nudged her. "mort. Professor Voldemort." She quickly corrected herself. "We haven't actually finished chapter fifteen, Non-Retaliation and Negotiation. We can't just skip to page 394"
"Thank you," The golden boy said, "Now if you'll excuse me, I have homowork to do — I mean homework. Not — Not homowork. Because that's dumb. And I'm not gay. Like at all. Obviously. No. Straight. Yes gay. I mean, no! Not! Fuck!"
When the last day turned around, both boys met in the courtyard. It was pretty chilly out in late October. Harry only had his thin coat, yet he somehow managed to feel hotter than normal. Draco would agree.
"Hah! I won!" Dumbledore turned to Snape, pointing his index finger at him. "In your face, Severus!"
Draco chuckled lightly, realizing what he might look like from their perspective. He shrugged, "Pretty much. Wanna join, Zabini?" He asked smirking, opening up his quilt to give room. Both laughed as he shook his head, "Nah. I wouldn't want to smell like you when I wake up tomorrow"
"You know me so well" Draco cackled, letting Harry roll his eyes and smile for the fiftieth time today. Fuck, he would kill to have it like this every day. You know what, he probably would.
Pansy frowned. "Well, damn. No need to be too aggressive" She whispered to the one beside her. "When she said fag, does she mean a cig?"
"Yeah?" Ron blurted out without thinking. They all looked at him, furrowing in disappointment. My constant meal of the day. "She's not talking to you, you idiot. Her great-grandson's name is Ronald." Draco whispered loudly so he can hear him from the steps. Granger sighed, "What an idiot"
After barely two days since breaking up with her girlfriend, Harry has realized how easy his thoughts were regarding the breakup. How, somehow, his mind wasn't filled with memories of her but of Draco Malfoy.
drunk and thought they just saw Draco dancing with Harry? They might find that answer in just a bit.
"What? You're gonna suck my—" He watched as Harry flew right past him and his beautiful face. Harry grinned and stuck his tongue out as if he's trying to taste the bitterness of the air around him. "Hey!"
"Is this really the only way up, Malfoy?' Hermione asked the blond boy who was also not liking this plan that might involve ruining his over-priced dressing robe.
Draco quickly pulled his into a kiss and smiled, "I know. I believe you." He whispered, "Fuck them, Harry. Please. Not literally. But still. They're just trying to take you down because they're fucking jealous they're not the main character of this goddamn series." Harry giggled. "Win this tournament. Show that motherfucker your reverse card. Fucking laugh at their face when you won that cup, okay? You've disarmed the dark lord before! Dragons would be an easy task"
"It's you again" The blond scoffed when he saw the group walking inside the room. He had taken off his rob and was left with just his white shirt and his iconic Slytherin house tie. His hair was glowing for some fucking reason but so are his eyes. It stayed glowing in perfection. He leaned back on his chair, arms crossed and feet resting on the wooden table across him.
"Oh! The special something they meant was a special someone!" Ron just realized, as if it's not already bloody obvious. Hermione, Ron, and his other friends all watched in hopes that Harry can arrive safely. "I hope he's not dead" Neville muttered, which low-key speaks for all of them.
"What rumor?! Can anybody in this table speak bloody English?" Harry wasn't sure that the rumor was between him and Draco or any other girls people think he's fancying. He's pretty sure by now it's not Draco because they've been very public about hating each other. Very public. So he's pretty fucking sure it's not them.
Harry giggled before he asked, "So, how did it go? With you and your mother" Their conversation a few nights prior somehow pushed him to go and talk to his mother. He doesn't know how but he promised himself to tell them,
"No, you shut up, Malfoy" Pansy smacked his arm playfully. "You're one of the reasons why the Slytherin is evil propaganda is still alive until today. When really, we are just psychologically fucked up kids with rich strict parents" Pansy smiled at the Gryffindors.
"As if you weren't the one having a major crush on him," Hermione said, looking back at her notes. Harry might have felt a hint of jealously in her voice — or maybe he's just hearing things.
Draco nodded slowly at every word before catching Harry's stare and joining him in laughter. There is always something peculiar about this boy. Draco realized that as he laughed fondly. "And bad for my health, that's for certain" He added. Harry laughed, "Is that why you keep eating apples? Not that I'm complaining, honestly."
much. During classes, during breaks, during a goddamn Quidditch match in the middle of the fucking pitch, for fuck sake Draco!
Everyone is super excited about the Triwizard Tournament that is happening here in Hogwarts. It's an inter-school magical competition that consists of three dangerous tasks. Being the main character of the franchise, Harry Potter is obviously going to participate.
Draco's eyes were mostly the same as Ron and Hermione's—but more of worry. He knew how dangerous the tournament's going to be. But when he heard the distant chattering and giggles from his table, he knew there's a fucking fish market going around.
The water was as clear as my future—not clear at all—and it's making it hard for him to see as if he's not legally blind already. He squinted his eyes when he saw a human body in the middle of the lake, not moving. Why is it not moving? Is it dead? Why is it dead? Is he gonna end up like this lifeless body too? Oh shit, it's Draco!
Harry's chest eased slightly as he chuckled, "I've said this a billion times. I'm fine with you two going together" After years being the third wheel, he's pretty much used to it.
Hermione sighed in defeat. Snape told them about Midna being in Hogsmeade, but they didn't know she'd be in a pub. "We can't." Harry said, "None of us is legal of age to get in."
Harry laughed lightly, "Oh, come on! I have nobody to take to the dance. Every time they asked me who, I just directly think about you"
Fuck. Now that hits home. For me and for Draco. If only my father actually says that bullshit to my face, maybe life wouldn't be a complete arse all the time.
Draco shrugged, "Thought I deserve it. Plus, I didn't want to risk it. Remember that time after the potions storage room incident and we spent the night in my room?" Draco recalled. Harry nodded before Draco continued, "Well, I think somebody heard us. Because Blaise asked me who I was with that night. I told them I was probably just sleep talking. I think they didn't buy it"
"Yeah, I guess I am that." He shrugged with a smile, "Honestly, it doesn't change who I am. I have always been, you know, bisexual. I just needed time to realize it for myself. I will always be the kid you met on the train — even if I shave my head bald, or lose a scar, or date a guy. I'm still... me. I've always been."
glances from across the hall. Now that they're out, it still felt a tad awkward. Harry's already an awkward bisexual from the beginning, this is just an insignificant addition to the list.
Draco walked back to his common room after spending some time with Harry—and insisting the guys in Harry's room that it'd be best for everyone if he goes and sleeps on his bed tonight. To no surprise, Draco met up with his little Slytherin friends. All collectively turning towards him the second he walked in. He's honestly too tired to deal with them. He shrugged off the looks and fasten his pace, walking through the common room and up the stairs.
"I—" Harry started before Snape cut him off. "You don't get to speak until I explain the situation, Potter" They waited for Severus to continue. "I was just from my potions storeroom and guess who I found hiding in there?"
"Oh, right. The ball" Harry forgot about the ball. He was so busy with preparing for the real competition that the ball just easily slipped out of his mind. "How about Cho?" Ron suggested, taking a big bite on his sausage. Well.
Harry stepped back, putting his hand up in surrender. Draco rolled his eyes fondly and reminded them, "We have bigger fish to fry" Pointing at the window. Ron turned and quickly calculated his way up the two-story building. He quickly hopped on top of a metal bin and climbed up the roof, stepping and grabbing on bricks and stones. Hermione is shook. Just saying. Harry and Blaise quickly followed behind him—kinda reminding Blaise of the time they snuck out of the Malfoy Manor a few years ago when Voldemort was still the dArK lOrD.
"Harry Snape!" Dumbledore exclaimed before the whole room burst in laughter, including Snape and Harry. "Well, first of all, I wouldn't have named my child Harry," Snape told the room of professors.
and smiled when his eyes landed on Harry and Draco. "We did it again, Severus. We make a pretty great team"
"No, because I look hotter eating an apple rather than a chocolate candy" He stopped and pointed at Ron, who was happily trying a candy sample in front of Honeydukes. "Exhibit A"
. Everyone looked stunning in their gowns and robes. Huh, wizards. Making robes look expensive and glamorous.
So the tournament went on like the movie. Harry fought a dragon that isn't Draco and didn't die since I still need him to be Draco's husband. He smiled widely when he completed his first task. People surprisingly were cheering and congratulating him, when he's sure a few days ago they were booing him. Hm. Hypocrites.
Draco sighed and trailed behind his friends and McGonagall. He saw the look on Harry's face and whispered quickly, "I promise you I didn't know" Hoping Harry somewhat believed this. Harry nodded and smiled.
"Then, maybe I should show you" His voice gets deeper, both not entirely realizing that they're just inches away from each other.
Harry bit his lower lip before rolling his eyes. He sat down as further away from Draco as possible. Not really. He chose the same row, just both very far away. Like a table far. You know, so you're not gay. "Nice to see you too, Malfoy" He greeted with a mild taste of sarcasm.
"At least I have great taste in men" Harry smirked. Draco grimaced, "Ew. Don't." before pulling him to round two, baby!
"I knew it started last year when I thought I saw you two under the bleachers." Dumbledore admitted, "But I never thought it was true. Until today"
surprised." Pansy admitted, "Your entire career is talking about Potter this, Potter that. It was bound to happen at some point."
"Which would most likely turn out to be a guy," Zabini said cooly, in which Draco chuckled in response.
The week has been a bit rough for Draco. So, in an attempt to cheer Draco up, Hermione and Ron let Draco join their little group excursion. No, not a foursome.
Ron and Hermione turned around when they heard someone walking towards them. "Hey, mate!" Ron greeted with a smile.
It's been a week since the lake thing. People try not to think about it that much, also seeing that Harry and Draco are back to their supposed rivalry with one in a few times making fun of him in public. So yeah, you can say it's not a big deal.
Harry laughed, not bothering to raise his head off Draco's shoulder. "Don't worry. I don't have my wand with me"
Both turned and watched Ron walk up the stairs to his room. "Are you jealous, Ronald Weasley?" Hermione teased from her seat with a smile.
And the fact that Harry also knows that he knows made it a lot more—yeah, I think you can finish that sentence yourself. "You're a fucking git" He gritted his teeth and pulled his collar, before attacking his lips with his. In which I just found out it's actually called kissing.
"Come, sit" Dumbledore offered as he walked back to his table. He waved his hand and the set of wizard's chess closed up, before tidying itself inside one of his cupboards. "This is some serious talk here," He added. Harry and Draco sat across Dumbledore, having no idea where this conversation might carry them. Are they gonna tell everyone? Is this how they're gonna come out?
"Shh! Let him talk" Snape quiet her down. Harry, being visibly embarrassed at the question, turned to Draco. "Uh, do you wanna.." He could feel Draco was feeling the same way and his head shake sealed the deal. "Okay, uh... It's our first time?"
Just a theory, Harry. Maybe if you stop procrastinating, maybe you'll actually find a solution to your deadly quandary. Just saying.
"Draco," Harry reminded, with a low voice that makes his original voice ten times sexier. Draco's jaw clenched as he threatens the poor Gryffindor who also did not sign up for this. Eventually, he stepped back, following Harry's orders. Harry popped up from behind Draco and smiled weakly, "Please. Don't tell anyone."
The two came at the exact time they promised. They were much aware of the small audience that's forming around them — mostly from within their friend group. "So, when will your date come around?" Harry asked.
Nothing. They continued to do nothing. It's been weeks after the rumor started and Draco was more than scared that his father would hear about it and possibly kick him out of the family tree — or burn the wallpaper with his face on it.
"Which is very understandable." Blaise nodded. "We're sorry for putting that thought in you and lashing out on you like that"
"Fair enough. Do we have a deal, Potter?" He extended his arm out and with a shake of his hand, the games begin. And the obliviousness continues.
"It's your mother" Voldemort admitted, sipping his butterbeer. Making him snape his neck again. There's a lot of snapeing happening here.
"Mate, you know you can tell us anything right? Even if it's a hard pill to swallow, we'd still be friends no matter what" Ron told him, sitting down next to him on the carpeted floor.
"No! Gosh, darn it, Ron!" Hermione looked up, quill still dangling in between her fingers. Harry laughed quietly, trying not to wake up unwanted students. "To make you feel better, Ron. Gay men would love to go out with you"
Granger rolled her eyes and continued to look around the great hall. Scanning through the room, trying to pick out a guy Harry could take to the Yule Ball with him. Her face lit up like Ron's when he sees food. "Oh, how about Cedric?" She suggested, eyeing the Hufflepuff who just walked in with a mate of his.
"Sure," he replied as he sat down on the old stained couch. He scanned the room, looking at the odd pots and pans, the weird buckets of whatever that is, and the insane amount of dog food in the corner of the hut. The pot sizzled a bit, indicating that it's ready. It's fast because he used magic. "Have you got a date for the Yule Ball yet?" Harry asked, starting the conversation.
tone, Ron let out a loud hiccup, startling the group in the compartment. "That doesn't sound good—" He hiccuped once more before his head grew bigger than my teacher's ego and redder than my score. His eyes watered like a reservoir before Harry and Hermione laughed, pinching the bridge of their nose as a ghastly smell filled their space and then finally turning back to normal.
The crowd cheered as one by one they emerged to the surface. First being Cedric and his bf. I read it beef, I don't know why.
Ron opened his DADA textbook carelessly from the middle and was visibly surprised when he accidentally opens the exact page asked. He was so shook that he shook Harry's shoulder in shook. "Look! I didn't realize and it just opened to the exact page!"
"Better than I expected. She was very supportive of it. But I told her not to tell father yet, you know, until I'm ready—I
"Fucking hell" Draco rubbed his forehead. And as if he knew his ships are in trouble, Voldemort popped out of nowhere like my pimple. Speaking of pimples, isn't it amazing how all of these hormonal teenagers have clear perfect skin? What type of sorcery shit is this and where can I buy it?
That's one class down, a few more to go. This time, they're sharing Transfiguration Class with Professor McGonagall. She also very gorgeous, if I may add. But let's not get swoon over her flawless looks and see what these bitches are up to this time. "Wonderful, Ms. Greengrass!" she complimented the Gryffindor. "Now—"
"No, no, no, no. Hell no. I wasn't even finished you prat" He smacked his arm jokingly, making Draco laugh. "What I'm saying before you blindly interrupted was that... I'm tired of having to hide this relationship for so long. We've been doing this for more than a year and fuck do I want to take you by the hand, steal kisses as we dance like traditional heterosexual couples would do. I want that. A lot. Do you?"
"Well of course not, Ron." She quickly turned to him. "I'm not bloody stupid. Even a blind man can see him checking out particular boys. Or how his eyes twinkle every time Cedric walks by. Or Malfoy, weirdly"
"Harry, you're not allowed here," McGonagall told him. In which Harry just turned to her, face clearly not liking what he just heard. He shook his head, "No, no. I'm pretty sure I have as much involvement in this student drama shit as Malfoy. So can I ask?" Harry turned to the rest of the professors in the room—Snape and Dumbledore. "Whose fault do you think it is?"
"Now you're the desperate one" Draco rolled his eyes before receiving another peck on his cheeks — and coo from the audience. He bit back a smile. "I don't know. What would I get in return?"
Harry invited his friends to sit down and talk after dinner. A few days after scene two happened. He talked with Draco about it and he came to realize that there's nothing wrong with admitting who he really is to his friends.
"What?! Sorry, I can't hear you from all the way here" He teased from afar, even if Harry's 99% sure that Draco can 100% hear him. Harry rolled his eyes, mumbling, "Let's see who's got the bigger mouth after this"
there with his possible future hubby. "I love this burst of confidence. It looks good on you" Harry complimented, following Draco's footsteps.
The class watched as the door swung open dramatically. Also equally as dramatic, their new DADA teacher walking in with pride, and a wide smile smeared across his face. He stood in front of the class, arms wide open. "Miss me?"
"I'm sorry. Yeah, you're right." Dumbledore nodded, "It is unprofessional. Our deepest apologies—" Then Daddy Voldemort walked in.
"Ew, don't say it like that" Dumbeldore instantly throwing his hands back down. Harry and Draco's cheeks turned visibly pink again in embarrassment. Their teachers knew. Well, that must've summed up something. "Sorry about that," He said that as he sat back down on his chair.
After a few muggle magic up their sleeves, the group was able to find a way to go out to Hogsmeade. The only thing left doing is Harry dragging Draco out of his room. "Are we even allowed out of school?"
"Honestly, people. I have no time for this. I am stressed out and my fucking assistant," She hissed at her elf, "didn't even think of bringing my goddamn fag,"
All three are back in the common room. It's a bit late at night and most of the students are already in their rooms. The three sat down with their textbooks, trying to finish a Charms assignment due tomorrow. In trying he meant, trying to convince Hermione to share her hard work with them.
"Apologies for the interruption" He snapped his head to the seated students. "Carry on now, children. I need to talk with your professor here"
"You're more powerful than you think," Draco stated. "I'm pretty sure you're gonna be doing wandless spells in no time"
Hermione turned to him with a smug smile. "Is that one of the things you concluded from your Viktor Krum obsession?"
Hermione smiled before noticing Harry's focused on something else—or in his case someone, but they still don't know that. "Harry?"
"That's bullocks coming from your mouth, Malfoy. He will come to his senses eventually, so will you. He ruined our lives, he wouldn't think twice to ruin yours if it means protecting his precious hero title—"
After being able to stay alive and kill The Dark Lord: Voldemort in his fourth year of highschool, he was pretty much the talk of the century. Well, we can't really say he's dead. Voldemort. His bad-side is dead. He's now just an ordinary and legendary wizard who is great
"I wouldn't buy it" Harry chuckled. Draco laughed lightly, "I was panicking, alright?" Harry just laughed, letting Draco rest his head on his shoulder as they stared at the fire and letting time guide their conversation.
Pansy smiled softly. "Can we sit down?" She pursed her lips. Draco nodded and smiled tightly at them. "Yeah"
Harry paused before he smiled warily, "Yes. Yes, you are. This is all just a dream" He moved his hands across his face like he's some sort of psychic from his dreams. Draco shook his head and walked up to him, snapping Neville's face back up. "If you dare speak a word of this to anyone—"
"What?!" Ron turned to him, bulging his eyes out. Like it's the craziest thing he's ever heard. They laughed. "I'm sorry?" Draco chuckled and shrugged. Pansy smiled and pulled the cigarette in between her lips. Not gonna lie, Ron thinks she looks fucking hot like that. Hermione agrees. Wait, what.
"Hey, Draco!" The four turned to see Pansy and Blaise standing a few feet away from them. Look stunning as fuck, by the way. "Can't you
Seamus laughed and nodded in agreement, "Honestly, you're right" Realizing the many times Draco says the word Potter, almost every day — and night.
"Still hanging out with these weirdos huh, Potter?" The group turned to see the wonderful and fantabulous Draco Malfoy with his hair glowing brighter than my future and complexion. Differing from my explanation of Malfoy, the group hated his guts. He's a prick with no ounce of kindness in his blood if you asked them.
Even if none of them bought it, they decided to shrug it off like they always do. Hermione was the first one to get up, "Well, I need to get going now. I need to prepare for first period"
But before he can answer, the cannon blew up signaling their time to get in the water. The effects of whatever Neville gave him were making it hard for him to swim but he managed. He honestly has no fucking idea what treasure they meant to be looking for.
"No, I hate candies," Draco told him, tucking his hands back in his pocket. Harry chuckled, "No, it's chocolate"
"Enough, Ron." Hermione told him before turning to Harry, "So, since when? How did this all come about?"
"I think I have a solution to your problem," He smiled. He pulled out a little box from his pocket and handing it to Draco. The latter furrowed but took it anyway. "What is it?"
"It's true," Narcissa said with a teasing smile, looking at Draco who was blushing immensely. "Bellatrix was this close," pinching her two fingers together, "To killing you just so Draco would stop talking"
Hermione was in a beautiful baby blue dress, kinda like Cinderella. Not Belle. Yellow's too bright, even for her liking. Ron helped her out by casting a little twinkle spell to brighten up her look, in which he spent days trying to learn. You know, as a little surprise.
"Did any of your smart nerd friends found anything?" Draco asked, leaning and resting his one hand on the table Harry's sitting on, looking down at him.
asking" Draco shook his head with a smile. The pair took Voldemort's and Snape's hand and pulled them into the dance floor.
"Well.. before you and Lily of course—oh, wait! You never were in a relationship with her" Dumbledore laughed. Snape snaped his neck at him and glared, "Hey!" Smacking his arm with his textbook.
"You know I didn't mean that" Draco rolled over to look him in the eye. Both shirtless and sweaty. Harry pulled him down to meet his lips and smiled, "I know. I honestly think it's hot when you diss me"
Draco also has six senses when it comes to knowing where Harry is. He looked up and saw the boy smiling at him. "Oh, you again." And with a snap of a finger, he was quick to change his whole facade. Harry just stared, putting his smile back behind his head, pulling off that 'annoyed' look once again. "Ever thought of never showing up again, Potter?"
Also, there's one time Harry finally broke up with this Ravenclaw girl from Ginny and Luna's year. He was hurt and angry and was this close to hurting someone real bad. Anger has been something Harry has continuously tried to dealt with after the war and it seemed to not tune down any less, even after the muggle therapy Hermione suggested.
"Are you two fighting again?" Voldemort looked up from his book, noticing they're on the floor now. Both cheeks turned pink as Harry chuckled nervously. "Sorry"
Ron stepped forward. "And I'm Ron!" He grinned widely, extending his glove-covered hands. Pansy chuckled, shaking his hand as well. "Nice to meet you, Weasley" She turned to Blaise. "Your turn, idiot. It's a formal thing to do"
Snape lets go of their collar, pushing them a bit to the front. He closed the door behind him before turning his attention back to them. "Do you want me to tell them?"
The Gryffindor girl shook her head. "Of course not." Though, it's not like she hasn't considered it. By the way, don't smoke, kids. Pansy giggled, walking closing to her. "You're Hermione, aren't you?" She offered her hand, "I'm Pansy. Your friend's boyfriend's friend"
Harry smiled assuringly. "I'll be okay. You have a lot of things here." He stated the obvious whilst scanning the room he has been to countless of times.
"Yeah! That was what I was gonna tell you. My friends and I—Blaise and Pansy—saw dragons being flown in here. I mean, you didn't hear it from me but I have a feeling that has something to do with the tournament"
Their bright happy faces turned cold as they all collectively stared at him in agony and annoyance. That is until Harry said this dumb shit, "And who do you think I should hang out with? You?" Not realizing the reaction of his friends.
He knew that voice like how he knows Harry's breathing patterns. He sighed and turned around. "What do you want, Parkinson?"
"I'm talking about you, silly. You wouldn't last a day without me" He teased before fleeing further away from him. He chuckled and caught up with him with ease. "Uh, hell yeah I would"
Harry rolled his eyes and pushed himself away from the window. He looked around the dark unlit room and
Not being able to finish his sentence, Draco pulled him away from the wall and pointed his wand at him—the spell he cast shoved the nameless bitch across the room, causing him to hit the hard dungeon wall and was soon left unconscious.
The brown-haired boy shook his head. "No. Despite his big babbling mouth, he's too much of a coward to go out with me" He smirked again, once again, sipping his hot tea. Malfoy looked down with a light pink blush covering the apple of his cheeks. "He's not a coward. He's just... waiting for the right time"
"Oh my god! Stop hitting on him" Hermione looked at him as they sat down at an empty space in their table, causing Harry to laugh. "I don't mean me!" He said, "I meant like... Fred or George"
to sneak out at night, but not something Draco has actually attempted to do. Until tonight. Oh, the things he does for Harry. One might think he's some sort of bad boy jock type when
B: "Everybody has a crush on Malfoy. He may be dumb and a self-entitled brat but he's hot. No doubt in that"
Draco gripped the armchair tighter as if Dumbledore was gonna hex him or something. McGonagall and Snape stood beside Dumbledore, both on each side before he began, "So..."
A peal of burst laughter was heard from behind, which made Draco jolted up, almost dropping his wand. "Lovebitus deletus?" He sneakered. Draco turned around and furrowed, walking up to him and whispered, "Potter?" Eyes roaming around the room to see if he's there.
Harry turned around, just now realizing that Voldemort's standing right behind him. Voldemort hadn't seen his face, but from the way his back muscles just tightened must indicate something, right? "I was the one who let him meet with Draco," Voldemort told the boy.
"Trust me, Malfoy. We would happily get away from you if it wasn't for Harry" Hermione stated before throwing Harry his bag. Draco looked at Harry from the other side of the room and asked, "What are you? Their master?"
These idiots, for fuck sake mate. Speaking of idiots, Harry isn't being so subtle with that lip biting and crinkled eyes, fighting his urge not to smile. Ron furrowed and turned around. "Who's there?"
But there was really nothing the teachers could do. He would get detention, sure, but that's that. Mostly because of his father, Lucius Malfoy. He is basically that PTA Karen at school who would complain every goddamn day about useless things that cannot be fixed.
Hermione nudged his arm, forcing him to stop mid-sentence. "Right. We're sorry. We shouldn't have assumed." She said softly.
Draco and Harry looked at each other, both in panic mode. "B—But professor. What are we supposed to tell the house?"
He lit up when he realized how fucking wrong his assumptions were. He hummed and nodded slowly, "It's not bad. It's actually quite good"
Harry rolled his eyes and smiled before turning his heels on Draco's opposite direction. But before he could take another step, Draco tugged his arm and pulled him to another kiss. Harry smiled, kissing him back. He flinched slightly when he felt the blond's hand slipped inside the back pocket of his jeans then patting on what seems to be a note. "See you tonight" Draco winked before walking outside.
"Never hurt you?" Hermione added after Ron. "Do you even realize who you're talking about, mate?" Ron asked.
Where are the teachers here? Why aren't they stopping them? That's because they're watching from above while sipping their freshly brewed cup of tea.
The old lady stopped snoring and everyone went dead silent. Draco, Pansy, Blaise and Hermione were all just thinking about ways to get out of here if they got caught. While Harry and Ron's mind just went
"Yeah, I know. It's me again." He said tiredly. "Boo!" He turned to a group and chuckled when one of them jumped back in fright. "I can take care of it from here," he said to McGonagall, patting her shoulder. She nods, "Yes, of course" and stepped back.
The commotion was Draco's opportunity to get back to his place next to Blaise, a fellow Slytherin who's as hot as he is. Harry laughed as McGonagall walked in surprised to see a pig in the middle of her class. She sighed, "Of course there's gonna be a pig in my class"
He rolled his eyes and flew next to him, who waited and watched. "Of course not. I have it all planned." He waved his hand. "I'm gonna dump your ashes in cookie dough and eat it with my next boyfriend while we're spending all your money"
was disappointing. Harry noticed she wasn't alone. About six to eight students in green stood across them, and neither one was happy. "Was it something we said?"
Harry laughed lightly, face glowing brightly. It makes Draco's heart clench at the sight. Mine too. Harry looked at the red mark he left on his neck earlier and blushed, "Oh. Sorry about that"
"I know. I'm better" Harry smirked. Draco rolled his eyes fondly. The latter giggled and added, "But so are you. Come on. I'll fight anyone who tries to say otherwise"
"How did we not notice this?" Hermione asked, mostly to herself. Harry shrugged, "But I went there and we..." They furrow as he watched him do weird gestures with his hands. Ron gaped him in horror. "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no—"
He shook his head and smiled, "Not as much as humans want to. People find that as terrible news, when really if you think about it, it's nice to know that not everything is in our control."
. They turned to see McGonagall walking towards them. "Off you go, Harry." Hermione's voice turned softer before she tears her eyes away and glares back at his boyfriend.
McGonagall sighed once more. "It's called snogging, Severus." Which made both Draco and Harry blush uncontrollably. The headmaster laughed at Snape's take on making out. "Not surprised he doesn't know the term snogging. Haven't done that since Lily died" He and McGonagall laughed.
"Yeah, but I'm not the Gryffindor around here. Where's your Gryffindor bravery, Potter? Lost it with your dignity on your way here?" The group just smiled at their new-found entertainment. Harry chuckled. "You're too desperate to win this thing, Malfoy. Pretending to like your friend? That's what a coward does"
Draco shrugged, "I've had better days" Yeah, he can be a bit blunt on things. He didn't lie, even if he has done that for the entirety of his life. To his surprise, Lucius just nodded. "Right."
The four chuckled and ran out as Snape shooed them like a flock of birds in his backyard. "Really, though." Draco started, turning to Hermione and Ron. "How did you get Snape to let us out? Did you spell him or something?" His voice sounding genuinely curious.
There was a slight shift of wind in the tip of Draco's finger—he can feel it. Especially after walking in uncomfortable silence. Yeah, he needs to say something. "Is.. mother here?" He said before Lucius can begin to utter a word.
"Do.. you have a date to the Yule Ball? It's in 3 days" Harry said carefully. The last time they talked about the ball was in Hagrid's Hut, which happened way before Harry competed in the Triwizard Tournament.
"It's alright, mate. Any boyfriend of yours is a boyfriend of ours" Ron said with a proud smile. Hermione turned and furrowed. He sighed, "You know what I mean"
"Yes, my boy. And every other day, I suppose. Apparently, a lot of the kids hate me. I mean, I get it. I'm not really as good-looking as you two but I'm not THAT bad" He shared, which made both the boys chuckle. "Dumbledore asked if I can guard detention. Lesser kids would try to break the rules knowing I'm the one in charge. Which come to think of it, I really don't mind. I really have nothing else to do." He shrugged. "Since it's only you two here, just do whatever you want."
"Please, Draco." Pansy finally said. Draco sighed and turned around. "Fine. But I haven't got all day" He said while leaning against the dungeon walls, hands tucked inside his pockets.
Harry walked towards the great hall, per usual like every normal Hogwarts citizen when he heard his name being called. He prayed to fucking Merlin it wasn't some kid who's trying to shut him off with homophobic slurs because it's still 9 AM and he's not ready to kill someone just yet.
Everyone quickly ran as fast as they can—also as quiet as they can—inside the closet. "Again?!" Harry had the time to comment while running inside. Draco snorted. "Me." They chuckled as Pansy locked the closet doors with a charm spell she remembered from class. Ron and Blaise stood up with head ducking down a bit so they don't bump the shelf inside the closet. While the rest scrunched themselves into tiny balls. Harry being the smallest, was the easiest to squeeze in.
Harry was visibly hurt when Draco came strutting into the great hall with Pansy in his hand — neither looking anything but casual, as if they've done this before. Truth be told, it's true. Harry did his best to conceal it. He congratulated him and moved on to say that a deal's a deal and that he's ready for anything. Not only did he lost to Malfoy, he literally lost Malfoy. But wait a damn minute, didn't Pansy once said she's gay as hell?
Lavender Brown hummed. "Sounds gay" Everyone looked up after realizing she has finally arrived at the table. She grinned widely before Harry realized she wasn't standing alone, in fact with another curly-haired girl he has never seen before. She introduced her to the table, telling them that she's one of her far cousin, Erika. "Mind if she joins us?"
The two continued their bickerings throughout the night before Harry had enough and slammed himself inside his room. He wouldn't admit it but he needed that. That little tight air out of his lungs. It made him realize that most of what he's doing with Draco was merely a rivalry hatred. It was something else. Maybe a distraction? Or some type of familiarity after the events of not knowing what to come. Either way, it was something Harry just couldn't place a finger on.
At this point, Lucius was sure that he at least did something right. At least. Not that good since he made his son scared to come out to him, but still. He was proud of him.
Snape heard the commotion from his office not so far from the common room and went to check it out. "What the hell's going on here?" In his deep southern Californian accent.
"Is it gonna happen again?" Harry clutched his stomach as he let out the last breath of laughter. Ron's eyes widen. "Again? What do you mean again—?"
Voldemort gasped. "How dare you?! You can't push people out of the closet like that!" Yes, he is the most supportive teacher there, ever. Draco added, "Technically, he pulled us by the collar—"
Ginny chuckled, "I've come to believe that that man's favorite word is Potter" The table laughed and nodded. Ginny Weasley is Ron's sister, as well as Harry's ex-girlfriend. I know. But they broke up after like two weeks of dating because they're both young and Ginny just wants to play around and be free.
"Harry! You—You look great!" She complimented, placing a gaze on his suit. Harry looked down and thanked her. As if Hermione herself doesn't look great.
When Dumbledore called out his name, the entire great hall transformed into a fucking zoo. The Gryffindor table turned to Harry who couldn't phantom what's happening. But, hey, he's used to it by now. Ron and Hermione looked at each other from across the table in shock and fear for Harry's sad and lonely life. While most people were quick to jump to the conclusion that Harry cheated, Ron and Hermione were already planning out a search party on who the culprit might be.
"To be fair, there aren't exactly other secret places to hide in. We've actually used every hidden place in this castle"
Hermione furrowed, "More clearer?!" Disappointed, but not surprised is Hermione's one true life motto.
"Did this all start from that time he publicly flirts with you but we all shrugged it off, thinking he's just joking and there's no way he'll be gay for you?"
Harry notes his voice wasn't his usual teasing manner, yet nor was it pity or worry like he would hear from Hermione and occasionally, Ron.
Ron nodded. "Yeah, you got a point" Ugh. Such good friends. The two turned to Harry, waiting for his opinion. Harry eventually smiled, "Thanks, Hermoine. But I think I have someone in mind to take to the ball"
"No... We're trying to let him know that if he is what we think he is, that we are totally fine with it. But we can't push him to admit that he is or what we
"Oh, thank goodness." Voldemort sighed in relief. He's the first person (or monster) who knew about them together. He honestly doesn't mind—especially the making out part. He thinks it's humanly for well, humans, to have a good intimate conversation that doesn't involve a lot of talking. He treasures that ritual and pitied them for not having a place to do so. So, he lets them during detention. It's honestly as productive as helping house elves with the dishes or organizing the books in the library, isn't it?
He saw a group of Slytherins cackling like hyenas in front of Hermione. Draco stood a bit far away, observing before he says something dumb that will not help, at all. "You have no proof that we put Harry's name in the goblet" A Slytherin crossed her arm, almost challenging her.
The news was spread like wildfire. The second Harry heard knew about a drama that involves him and the love of his life, he was quick to jump and go find him. Well yeah, of course, it involves Harry Potter. Everything involves Harry Potter. Not like he wants to be involved. But isn't he the one to say nothing is in his control?
With the number of times he stares at Draco, he had concluded that he was indeed infatuated by Draco
"It's very hard to brew but the effects are beyond astonishing. Just look at this maniac" She pointed at Voldemort who has continued the lesson by making notes on the blackboard using his wand. "He's acting as if the class wasn't made to prepare students for his attack. Ironic, innit?"
"Wow! Never thought we'd actually meet Midna Thistlethorps!" Ron said with a wide smile across his face. They all nodded. Blaise and Pansy letting their butts sink into the cold snow on the ground. Draco turned to Harry before laughing, "And you just had to be famous"
"Let's just jump to what I know you're gonna want me to explain. Listen, I didn't know. I promise you, I didn't know they were gonna do that."
"We already have" Ron glared, before they too realize most of the students in the hall were watching the drama unfold.
The latter stopped dead in his tracks. As if his cheeks can get any redder than this. He turned to him and glared, "Don't make me kill you right this instant, Harry"
"What is going on?!" McGonagall came walking in. The Slytherins looked down and one by one went back to their seat. She turned to the trio for an explanation. Hermione told her what she knew. She sighed and called upon the Slytherins—including Draco—to meet with Dumbledore.
The main character of the franchise furrowed at them. "Okay, this is all just weird. You guys are our teachers! And you're making a bet on us?"
, standing beside Krum's date in the middle of the room. "Cedric Diggory of Hogwarts," Dumbledore continued before the hall roared in cheers. He smiled
"Potter!" Voldemort called, who also noticed Harry's focus. "What did I say about staring at attractive people?"
The golden trio spent the night looking through books in the library and it's killing them that they couldn't find anything. "I'm gonna go check out the books over in the back" Harry got up.
Draco furrowed, "Wait, so Harry would've been called Harry Snape then? If Professor Snape did marry Lily Evans"
Draco told him all about it, in which he was very thankful for. He was low-key already thinking of a backup plan if this all turns to shit—which is the murder of Lucius Malfoy. Thank Merlin he doesn't have to execute that, even though that would be a cool plot to write about. lmao.
Harry nodded at the question. "How—?" Neville asked before being cut off by Ginny's little victory squeal, "I knew it!"
"Alright, that's enough" Ron got up, pushing the only textbook he brought inside his bag. "I'm off to bed. I can't deal with all the Malfoy this, Malfoy that"
Everyone turned their heads towards the door as Harry lunged himself inside the teacher's common room. "Harry," Dumbledore said, enough to attract Draco's attention and turn around.
"Uh, yes." He furrowed, still having no fucking clue what she's talking about. "What is this all about?" He asked again, dumbly. Voice softer, she replied. "There's a rumor that you and a certain someone are dating"
But as much as they hate to admit it, these two know each other way more than others ever will.  The first time their friends noticed this is when the group — which includes a couple of Gryffindor students, three Slytherins, and a Luna Lovegood — all sat down at a pub in Hogsmeade. How they became friends was no one's idea. Being the only few who got back for their eight-year after the war has forced them into forming somewhat of a friend group.
. He's thinking of his father again, he can sense that. He tried his best to calm him down. He scooted his broom and his butt closer to Malfoy and placed a soft kiss on the back of his hand.
"I don't dance" Snape answered shortly, not changing his stance. Even if he was shook by what he did. "Neither do I. But we can't
Their conversation was overheard by Dean and Seamus — two Gryffindors who are quite close with Harry — sat across him, next to Hermione. "Hey, mate! So? Is it true? About the rumor?"
like that. You know, like if you watch rap battles or dissing battles and then people go oooooh, well that's what they did. "You wish, you pathetic little git!" He snarled.
His little micro brain cell just turned on its emergency alarm, which has been ringing loads of times lately. His reaction scared both Ron and Hermione. Afraid that she said something wrong, she opened her mouth to explain, before Harry then cut her off, "Are you two suggesting that I might be gay??"
Dumbledore gasped and looked back at them. "Really?! What were you two doing in there?" He asked. Snape spoke monotonously, "I found them.. in the middle of... a tongue match"
The green-eyed boy bent over, attempting to get closer. But that was a dumb thing to do which then caused them to go off balance and fell with Draco at the bottom.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Scared, Potter?" He can't help but smile as he let Potter drag him to the entrance hall and was surprised to see Hermione and Ron waiting for them. He groaned, "What are you two doing here?"
The pair sat on a ruined wall outside of the castle and chose to stay there for a little while—or forever, possibly. Harry brought them to a lighter conversation which made Draco almost completely forget about the hell they decide to call "school".
"But it wasn't his fault," Pansy quickly backed up her homeboy, having to see the whole drama with her own eyes. Blaise jumped in as well, "Yeah! He was insulting him. I think he deserves it"
It only took about 10 seconds for Draco to realized he was soaked in salty rainwater. Yet, instead of commenting on how he just ruined his overly-priced trousers, he instead made a different comment. "You're gonna get a bloody cold if you don't decide soon enough to change. Just use one of mine if you're that sad of your closet. I know I am"
Draco couldn't help but snicker at the professor. Who would've thought he'd be this soft and nice. Something Harry actually thought about him—something he wouldn't want to admit. Harry was making himself comfortable by tucking his bag by his side when he heard a loud sound getting closer to him. He turned around and saw Draco dragging his chair like dragging Harry in the Great Hall earlier that day.
"Look at you two coming out of the closet again" Pansy cackled at the pair. The group walked down quietly to attract no attention. Seeing the bar being packed with wizards, even in broad daylight, they quickly hid inside a storage room, way bigger than the closet. "Oh! I know that guy!" Draco pointed at the bartender behind the bar, serving a man a shot of some type of magic wizard shit. Firewhiskey? Maybe. I don't know. "What now?" Harry asked, peeking behind the wooden door and into the bar area.
i know this is not accurate to what Lucius would've said, but i wanted something different where he is actually supportive of draco since joanne rowrow seems to hate draco that much that she gave him tons of shit in the books.
"We?! All of you did this?!" Hermione glared at them. A couple of Gryffindors walked up to them, trying to back up Hermione, seeing that it's one against many.
Draco knew Voldemort will be okay with it when he accidentally told him he likes a boy named Harry in a random conversation once with his godfather. That's what pushed Draco to use their time in detention very wisely the second he knew Voldemort's guarding it. "Yeah, but they kinda pushed us—" Harry commented.
He huffed and sat down next to him, giving no more than zero words as Draco continues reading and Harry staring at the fireplace. His jaw clenched and his eyes burning as much as the one he's staring at. "So, wanna talk about it, plonker?" He asked in a rather hushed tone.
"Yes, I wasn't!" She exclaimed with a small smile that she can't keep to herself. "I honestly have no idea how to react to that."
Harry turned to McGonagall asking her for answers to the visible questions on their faces. She sighed and explained, "We've been keeping an eye on you two since you two got here. Professor Snape and Headmaster Dumbledore made a bet that you two have been.. smooching butts"
"That's exactly the answer I was looking for" She smiled as she walked ahead of them. "Come on, Ron. I know exactly where to go"
"Do you have evidence that it's Draco?" Harry arched his eyebrow as if he's challenging her. She pursed her lips. Harry sighed, "I gotta go," he said before he got up and walked away. He couldn't deal with that assumption in his head right now. Their short conversation might have planted a 0.1% possibility in his head, not gonna lie. But he knew better not to let that take over his head. Just as he was about to leave the hall, Hermione's voice bellowed through the walls of the great hall. "I knew it!"
"He better not be or you're gonna be next" Ron threatened as he watched hopefully from above the lake. Neville furrowed, "How does that have to do with me?"
That was the moment he knew, they fucked up. Literally as well. Calm your bloody tits, Harry. Say something heterosexual. "W-Wha—" Were the only
Draco was helping a lot with this tournament—so did Ron and Hermione. They help read books for his task and shit like that. Harry also had no idea why he went to Cedric and told him about the task. What? He's a hot senior in need of help. Harry's gay ass is wheezing.
"She.. encouraged me." He admitted. "But I agree. With what I said." He looked to his son who honestly couldn't force out a word at the moment. He stopped and turned facing him fully, holding him by the shoulders.
"Of course not!" He mirrored his expression. "I respect you too much to just bluntly out us," Harry told. Draco nodded. He knew that. He's equally as scared as Harry. This isn't exactly how they want their coming out story to be like. Being pushed by people who are conspiring over their supposed relationship.
He smirked. "Yup. I know about your little dirty secret. No wonder you agreed to hang out with the Gryffindors. You like one of them"
Snape looked down, trying to hold back a smile but instead chuckled with them. Snape might have that stiff and odd persona, but once you get to know him better, he is a very fun and easy-going guy. He is also very good with other professors, that is why it's okay for these people to make fun of him, knowing he wouldn't bother. "Okay, why are you all insulting me?" He looked at them, backing away pretending to be offended. "What have I done to your depressed ass?"
Since he was the boy who lived, the Order of the Pheonix—or the group of the protagonist wizards—has dragged the teenager to their AA meetings. Training him so he could be ready whenever there is an attack. In the end, with one simple spell that an old DADA professor taught him, he was able to disarm tHe dArK lOrD and win the war. Hurrah!
Ron and Hermione have made a plan to find the person who put his name in the goblet of fiyah—and becoming the Holmes and Watson they've always aspired to be.
"You know who else is waiting to be asked out by Draco Malfoy?" Harry smirked as he said that. The latter's blood rushed up to his cheeks as he rolled his eyes, "Oh, shut up"
"Nothing ever will" Harry smiled sheepishly. "What I meant to ask is if my crush would want to go out on a date with me?"
"Surprise?" Draco smiled nervously, shoulders arching up. Voldemort smiled, "Don't worry, Potter. I love you both just the same. So, what are two doing here?" He asked. Snape answered, "I caught them snogging—"
. Speaking of seeing, he can't see shit. He cleaned his glasses with the shirt under his robe and put it back on. It wouldn't be a problem if everyone wasn't in different coloured outfits. "Harry"
"Well I got cigs," She said, mostly to herself. Pansy walked forward, standing next to Draco. She cleared her throat and took out her pack of cigarettes. "I have some. Would you like one? Or all if you want" She offered, extending her arm. Midna turned to her, eyeing the pack in her hand. So desperate for a smoke right now, she nodded. "Why, yes. That'd honestly be lovely. Thank you so much, dear"
Draco walked in and closed the door behind him. "What are you doing here?" Harry asked. Draco shrugged, "I honestly don't know. I was with Blaise and Pansy when I saw you walking down with Hagrid. Thought I'd say hello"
"Even if he's a homophobic piece of shit who deserves nothing but torcher and death," Snape answered. "Come on now, Draco. You've got some explaining to do"
Harry pushed him carelessly, not even thinking where they were or if they'll get caught. "Someone excited," Draco chuckled before he moaned into Harry's open-mouth kisses on his neck.
"Hey!" Ron snapped his neck at him. Draco looked around before turning back to him, whispering, "I date Harry, not his friends"
, eyes still twinkling as he spoke. "That's how we're gonna communicate once I'm buried in my grave" Draco joked.
"Can't we just Wingardium Laviosa ourselves to the top?" Pansy added to the question. Hermione hummed. "Yeah, no. Logically, you'd just fall face forward and ruin your nose"
So it took both Harry and Draco a surprise when Harry found the blond on his broom outside his bedroom window. "You are insane"
"You know, when he strutted towards you in front of everyone. It the weirdest thing I've seen my entire life" Hermione said, instantly bringing Ron his memories back. He gasped, "Merlin, I remember! I didn't think much of it though"
thing. "What the fuck?!" Draco pushed Harry's shoulder lightly. See, now he's not gay. Harry was surprised at first but quickly got the memo. His soft worried look for Draco's well-being quickly changed into this annoyed look. "Hey! I just saved your ass!"
"But it's working, isn't it?" He grinned like a maniac before widening once he saw the black-haired girl rolling her eyes and agreed.
"That's the whole reason why we're here. Get my mind off tomorrow. Steal you one last time before everyone else does." He sighed and smiled
"Maybe we should give some of that potion to Malfoy" He chuckled at his words. "Maybe that would knock some kindness into of him."
"As far as I know, no. They don't know. Probably he already told Blaise or Pansy or both. I don't know. But he agreed to dance with me in the ball." Harry answered the question. She smiled widely, "Oh my god! So this is like your coming out ball!"
"Ow, shit!" Blaise cursed after accidentally bumping his head on the top shelf. The rest chuckled before Hermione silence them when she heard footsteps arriving on top of the stairs. "Hey, Nana. Are you okay?" The voice mumbling through the closed doors of the closet. Everyone listened intently. They heard footsteps after mumbles before Hermione glares at Ron and Harry for being too loud. Pansy peaked through the little gap between the closet doors and cursed, "Shit, they're walking closer"
"Since—" He turned to see a speechless Ron. Jaw dropped like hot potato and eyes wider than the split on the red sea. "Ron? Are you alright?" Harry asked, holding his tiny chuckle. Ron finally blinked. She smiled fondly, "Give him some time to... react"
Draco tidied himself up and walked to the bar with confidence. The others stayed, hiding behind a wall as they watched Draco talking to the bartender. Soon they saw a smiling Draco waving at them to follow him. They did and was escorted to a room where Midna Thistlethorps was enjoying a drink with her friends, preparing for her show that night.
"Welcome to task number two of the Triwizard Tournament. I forgot what they exactly say in this scene so just pretend this is accurate. For the second task, we have taken a special something from you. Your job is to find it and get back here before the time runs out. Got it? Yes, please."
The bet is re-opened since neither one has actually succeeded in their goal. Draco was left with nothing and has accepted the fact that he will lose a bet against his most prestigious rival, Harry Potter. Oh, how he will crumble in die in despair.
Hermione nodded, holding his hand and smiled. Ron then continued to ask, "But what are you exactly? You said before you're gay but not gay?"
"Ew, don't" Draco grimaced, which made the brunette boy laugh. "Where are you going after this?" He asked. The latter shrugged, "If that's an invitation, I'm totally going"
Harry whispered back to Dumbledore, leaning his body a tad closer. "Can we just... continue with the reward giving first?" he asked. Everyone
Neville ignored that dumb question. "Y—You... Draco.." He pointed to him. Draco's head quickly hangs down as he let out the breath he didn't realize he was holding. Harry genuinely has no idea what to say. He turned to see Draco getting up and glaring at Neville. He quickly jumped in before Draco can say anything stupid, "Neville, I can explain"
"I'm pretty sure you two know why we're here," Harry said. He was sitting down on the red wooly carpet in front of the fireplace. He sat in a circle between Ron and Hermione, knees pressed against his chest, and his hands resting on both knees as he started.
He smiled softly and kissed him. There's a lot of kissing here in this scene. Sorry. "Harry, you know I can't. I–I still don't know how my friends would react to all this. Hell, being with you"
Ron gaped at him as if he had just betrayed their 6 years of friendship just like that. Hermione turned to him, "Why didn't you shut the window, Ronald?"
. He took off his iconic glasses before he heard a knocking sound. He turned his neck towards the door, waiting for someone to walk in. But nobody did.
"Yeah, that's pretty weird. But he is kinda hot though" The redhead spoke easily. Hermione furrowed. He shrugged, "People can be a jerk and still be hot as well, Hermione"
The father nodded and smiled. "I would give you a hug but—" You don't have to say the words twice, papa. As Draco pulled him into a tight embrace. "Well, alright then"
Good thing Ron was there to the rescue. "Run!" He exclaimed before running outside for his dear life. The people there tried to chase after them out but failed miserably. They have a tight law surrounding underage drinking or even walking into a bar after the minister's son died over alcohol poisoning. Anyway...
It's when he noticed he felt the same way too, only this time for Malfoy. How? All they ever do was fight and argue, right?
Hermione, who seems to agree with the redhead, nodded and jumped in, "Well at least he didn't send us owls to mock us every day, did he?" Yeah about that. You see, during summer break, Harry's been receiving mysterious letters addressing to—yeah obviously to him—even when he was staying at the Weasleys. Ron and Hermione were pretty damn sure it was Malfoy, but they honestly couldn't care less.
this is so bad, i'm sorry. i was planning on posting this on pride month but i missed the deadline hehehe
"Judgemental," Pansy tried to finish his sentence. Draco nodded, "Yeah, exactly!" He leaned back. "But come to think of it, I should've just told you guys sooner"
Pansy stayed quiet at the groan from Draco. She's usually never quiet. Like, never. If it was someone else, I can assure you she would prove to you how much of a Slytherin she is. "Draco, if you could let us talk," Blaise started, standing next to Pansy. "And then what?" His grey eyes storming furiously, "Call me names again?!"
Hermione watches as the two followed them up. Landing and grabbing parts of the walls and roof so they won't fall. She rolled her eyes and looking around her. Being the clever bad bitch she is, she got an idea. With a flick of a wand and a simple spell, she hopped on a big rock and flew herself to the top of the building, landing on the porch with the rest gracefully. Ron gasped as he watched his friend landing beside him without pulling a single muscle. "You're fucked up, Hermione! Why didn't you tell us this before?"
Midna nodded and signed him with his name. She handed back the notebook, "Here you go, darling. Please don't try to sell this on wBay."
"Harry Potter is with Draco Malfoy?!" Some random kid I don't know the name of said. Everyone in the room turned to him, so did Draco and Harry. Draco smirked and with all the ounce of confidence in him, he pulled Harry by his waist. "I know. Hot, innit?"
"Is there anything I can do to help?" Harry asked genuinely, hoping he's alright with all these... weird vibes. Draco shrugged,  "Uh, nothing? I mean, I can already feel the judgement from my table"
He stood up straight across from Dumbledore, looking him dead in the eye. Dumbledore leaned in and whispered, "Harry"
Draco laughed, "Calm down, hedgehog." He sat down next to him, wrapping his arm around his neck. Harry held his wrapped hand and smiled softly, scooting closer into his arms. "I hate this. I didn't sign up for this. Literally."
. "Spending time with my beautiful boyfriend..." He grinned as he twirled around the blond who rolled his eyes
"What are you boys doing?" McGonagall asked, scaring the three professors, all quickly looking elsewhere but Draco and Harry. "N–Nothing" All three replied collectively.
Draco nodded, "Yeah." He smiled, "Yeah, I know. I just can't—my parents aren't really that supportive. Of this" He was quite sure of what he said because of the comment he overheard from his father about one of his far cousins coming out as gay.
A gay joke. Classic. "It's not the homophobia he's worried about" Draco tried to keep his breathing steady as Harry strutted with the most annoying hot smirk Draco has ever seen. Fuck. "So? Just embarrassed to be seen with you?" He was still able to reply.
He sat by the window one night in the common room, looking out to the clear lake water. His mind is racing and he can't manage to fall asleep.
"Did you find anything?" Harry popped up from the side. Draco sighed and shut the book with a bang. "Not a goddamn thing"
"Then stop being a fucking flirt," he mumbled as his hands traveled around the latter's clothed back. Draco moaned as Harry left another dark mark on his neck—but it's not shaped like a snake cause that'd be weird.
"So... are you two gonna continue snogging or...?" The couple looked back at Voldemort who was still sitting on his chair, a book in one hand, and a glass of butterbeer in the other. Both mirrored each other, looking down sheepishly. "I better get going" Harry finally said. He turned around to Draco, smiled, and kissed his cheek softly. "See you around?"
"You're making me look bad in this" Ron said, pointing at his suit. He had a nice classic hand-me-down robe he got sent from his mother. Which
Harry appreciated what they did to make Harry comfortable and you know, not be afraid to tell them if he is gay. Which he is very grateful for. "You shouldn't trouble yourself to do all that. But I appreciate it. Really, thank you"
Harry couldn't explain the fuzzy feeling in the pit of his stomach. For years of knowing Draco, he always thought that it meant he was hungry or irritated. But now that it appeared back when he wasn't hungry or irritated, he was sure it was something else. Something better, something right. "I love you too." He muttered
"I know." He said coolly, "I'd just probably take a random girl out. There is — undeniably — a large assortment of fit birds who adores me" Draco smirked, teasing the boy in his arms. Harry added, "And fit blokes, too, I'm guessing. Me, being one of them" He muttered confidently, leaving another peck on his lips. "But you have asked one of them?"
Draco laughed and nodded. Holding back a blush is not part of the list of traits Draco has. Harry smiled at his reaction, "I'm ranting a full paragraph here so are you gonna say yes or no?"
"So am I. But I'm still not part of the candy family—or any family, really. Because, you know, dead parents... and all..."
She giggled, "I'm still going with you, Ron. But since Harry's the winner and he's going to be the one to start the ceremony, it would be more embarrassing for him if he doesn't have a date for his own ball"
That is until she was told Draco's allergic to nuts by none other than Harry Potter. "Ah, I wouldn't do that if I were you" The brunette boy commented. "Draco hates nuts. In hate, I meant he will start having somewhat period cramps, red hives, nausea, and intense vomiting. So, unless you want your aspiring future boyfriend to feel such pain, then I suggest you put down your bowl and your boobs away from the man immediately"
"Draco. Can we talk?" Draco groaned instinctively but quickly regretted when he realized it was Pansy. Pansy has a special place in his heart, not gonna lie. She was one of his first friends other than Crabbe and Goyle. Every time he has a problem at home, she was the first one he would run to. He was there before Harry was, actually. And it kinda hurt him—both of them—when he decided not to tell Pansy, out of all others.
Yep, he's tearing up a bit now. "Wow." He breathed. Pushing his tears back so his gay son doesn't cry in front of his daddy. "Never thought I'd hear you say that"
Harry giggled as he nuzzled his face on Draco's shoulder, feeling the warmth of the boy. "I saw Hermione using this on her face so I thought," He shrugs, "Maybe it can help conceal mark since I'm not really good at spells either. I only remember a few like, Avada Kedavra"
"Not everything is our responsibility" Draco mumbled. Harry nodded, "Yeah. Kinda like right now, really. We can't control what people think of us, just what we think of ourselves"
A tad surprised but still manages to blush, Harry looked down as he chuckled unevenly. "Sorry" He mumbled delicately. Ron furrowed at his best friend. "What's he talking about? Staring? At who exactly?"
"I mean, I wasn't even sure what I'm feeling. So, one time I was walking back to our dorm when someone pulled me in. It was him and — and he was flirting, like a lot. I obviously was still mad at him. He makes fun of me and he's making me... question things. I hated his guts so much, especially with what they continuously did to other students."
To their surprise, Dumbledore stood up and punched the air in excitement. "WOOHOO!" He exclaimed, face brightly glowing with a smile bigger than Harry's ass. Snape rolled his eyes, rubbing his temple with his hand.
you owe us something too" Ron chirped in. Draco stopped and turned around, furrowing at him. Folding his lips back and both hands in his pocket. "How about apologizing to us? For what you did in the last five years?" Saying it as if it's the most obvious thing in the world.
Draco can't help but smile. "It's just... a bit weird that they didn't tell me anything. Usually Pansy would keep me updated with this pranking shit—and I would've told you. BUt they didn't"
Without realizing, his obnoxiously loud voice was heard from outside. Professor Snape walked in—or rather pushed over—inside the classroom. He hissed at Dumbledore before turning his attention back to the class. He walked in, face as iconic as ever, over to Dumbledore who was waiting on the other side of the aisle.
The boy arched his neck to the side, seeing the very visibly red mark Snape was talking about. He blushed at the thought of their conversation earlier and quickly flicked his wand for the fifth time. "Lovebitus deletus?"
"Because you didn't tell me to?!" Ron said. The rest can't help but laugh—including Hermione. "Why do I have to tell you to do the simplest things? If I ask you to jump off a cliff, would you do it?"
Draco kissed back for a mere second before pushing Harry away. "Sorry, babe. For boyfriend only" He teased once again. But yeah, that ain't gonna happen. "Fuck off"
The table furrowed at the lovable idiot. "Who? Is it one of you guys?" He said, attempting not to look like he's shitting his pants. The Ravenclaw, Luna, giggled at the boy, "Oh, Harry. Of course not. It wouldn't be much of news if it's between a Gryffindor"
Draco turned to Ron and smirked "Yeah. He was so loud—" Ron gasped as Hermione glared at him. Harry pursed his lips and smacked his arm, "Stop that! No. We did nothing"
Draco and Harry saw Voldemort and Severus at the door and danced their way to them. "Hi, professors! Come on! Dance with us" He said with a wide smile, extending his arm to grab. He looked down at the hand, "......no" He said in his iconic way of saying things.
Snape invited everyone for some tea as they talked about life and shit like that. Harry told them about the Triwizard Tournament, and how Draco was behind most of his success—other than Hermione, of course. And Ron. He's like next best thing for moral support.
"Suits me. Not much of a healer than it is to a therapist." He could feel Malfoy's slight smirk grazing upon his face. "You're lucky, mate"
"Well don't just stand there, McGonagall. Do something!" Dumbledore stated, which made Snape cackle and McGonagall smacking him harder in the arm. She eventually got out of hiding and walked up to them, waving her hands frantically, trying to disperse the crowd. "Okay, that's enough weird tension for today. Go! Shoo!"
Harry shook his head as he smiled fondly, "You wish. You should've thanked me as well. It takes two to do the tango"
But what Neville said afterward calmed him down, just a tad bit. "Honestly, there's just no way that's true." Longbottom finally chimed in. "It's very much a well-known fact that they hate each other's guts."
Harry turned and smiled back widely. "Hi" She took her seat beside the red-haired Weasley, Ronald. "Where have you been?" The boy asked, with a tone I'm pretty sure you can hear through the screen.
Draco was as shocked by the kiss as Harry, but neither pulled away. After moments of an attempt to soak up as much of the information he has, he decided to say fuck it and kissed back. It was a strong, longing feeling, both were equally desperate for. It turned way too hot for both before they eventually pulled away, cheeks brighter than the cherry blossoms in Japan.
Of course, he was searching for Malfoy. Harry plopped down on the table Draco was standing beside and pulled his hair back in frustration. This is not the first time Harry and Draco spent in the library—sitting five feet apart because they're not gay. They've been trying to figure this out for days—two—and they still found nothing other than their undying love for each other—but that shit's useless at the moment.
"If by Thursday you haven't decided on who to take, I would gladly be your date," Hermione told Harry. Ron pulled his eyebrows together, "But I asked you first!"
The green-eyed boy looked over his shoulder and smiled as he scanned the loud and fucked up class of his. He would describe it as the visuality of his brain in the middle of the night—being the reason why he can't fall asleep as easily as he used to. "I'm pretty sure they're too preoccupied at the moment"
"No blackmail. Just need a little bit convincing" Harry gave a teasing smile at Hermione. "She's a really great convincer. It's in her eyes." Ron pointed at them before a blushing Hermione swatted them away. "And that lip twitch she makes" Harry added with a chuckle. She rolled her eyes with a smile, "Can we not?"
She smiled softly, "Yes, and we still love you for that. No matter who you consider yourself to be. You're always Harry Styles to us — I mean, Potter! Potter! Who the hell is Styles?" Harry chuckled and thanked them once more in a very appreciative manner.
"Draco" he breathed heavily in surprise, especially after being man-handled like that. Back pushed to the wall with faces inches closer. So gay. "It's not your time to turn me on, Potter." He whispered, rather hotly actually.
He chuckled and looked down, thinking before he spoke. "You're the tournament winner. People are going to be looking at us"
"Oh. You do." The girl stared. Ron smiled widely, "Awesome, mate! Who is it?" Both waiting to see who the secret boy he's been fancying lately. The guy that made Harry lose focus in class, the guy that made him blush madly when they hinted and teased on who it might be, the guy that made them question his sexuality, the guy he
Pansy was first to respond with a smile and a quick shake with her head. "Not at all." She has always had that cold, sassy persona from her. But when in reality she is the friendliest friend one could have. But she's also very opinionated and when she hates it, she would think twice to cut the crap.
The two quickly let go as Voldemort waved his hand, unlocking the door. Both not really noticing when Voldemort locked it. Probably when they were in the middle of lip fucking.
He hasn't done as much as Harry has done, like winning a war or something courageous along that line, but he is very attractive. He is dashing. He has beautiful silver blond hair, smokey grey eyes, porcelain skin, THAT jawline that even math teachers continuously try so badly not to measure its angle.
Harry furrowed, eyes still ahead. "How's he a replica Voldemort? He has a nose" Both furrowed at his response. "What Ron meant was he's got followers," Hermione explained. "Like Voldy"
"Don't act that surprised, Malfoy" Ron retorted with a scoff. "That's what most of the Durmstrang kids do anyways"
"He's asking you to fight," Pansy told him from behind. She knew that's not what he meant, but she's just testing a theory.
"Oh! So we're friends then?" Pansy teased. Hermione chuckled, "I mean, sure" She shrugged with a smile. "Except you Draco. We still hate you" Hermione turned to Draco half-heartedly.
Harry sighed, moving away from the books he's been flipping through. "Not a damn thing" He groaned, "What type of fucking game is this?"
"You got to be fucking kidding me right, Harry?!" He turned to Harry, both turning to him. "H–He's Draco Malfoy! He's been torturing us for the last five years!"
"Saving you, of course," Ron said as if it's the most barbaric question Harry has ever asked. "I hope it wasn't that much of a hell being here with him"
irrelevant that even the author didn't bother to think of a name for you!" Draco gritted. The Slytherin group all of a sudden turned silent the second they saw someone standing behind Draco.
Which is true. Being anything other than straight isn't the most common thing in the wizarding world at that time — or the whole world in general. Most people are dumb homophobic assholes who only thinks about themselves, claiming to know what's right or wrong. Dumbass.
"See you tonight, Potter" He left him a glare one last time before walking away with Slytherin students of all ages and skin color trailing behind him. Even if he is a bully, he doesn't discriminate.
"Too late" Ron glared. Harry—who's been noticing their shitty remarks—walked up to them, in his glamourous attempt to stop them. "Can we all not?"
"I would like to personally say I'm sorry." Her sentence was cut short by the nameless bitch. Draco looked up as he watched the nameless bitch getting up from the leather couch. He turned to Draco before he continued. "to ever think you're worth being here, Malfoy! A disrespect to the house and Salazar himself. Embarrassing!" He spat in disgust.
Harry smiled. A challenge with Draco Malfoy. He wouldn't miss it for the world. "And what are we betting on, exactly?"
"Shit. That's hot" Astoria whispered from the sidelines, as the other students watch the drama unfold.
"So, Harry." Hermione started once she put down her drink. "Do you have anyone to take to the Yule Ball?"
He laughed, looking around the room, encouraging others to laugh with him. No one did. "He's turned you soft, that weak loser—"
Draco noticed that Harry was making an inside joke that only the two of them understood, which caught him off guard. "What?" Was the only little squeak he could make out.
"Hello..." He stretched his word. Draco turned and glared at them—mostly at Hermione. "You guys really suck at planning"
The students that were left nodded in agreement. Very good guys. Well done. "Still. It is in no way stated in the books that you're allowed to use the
"Even if he's a homophobic piece of shit who deserves nothing but torcher and death?" Pansy asked genuinely.
"That time he openly checked you out?!" Hermione asked, moving her seat closer to Harry as she speaks. Harry furrowed, "What?"
Everyone turned to him and cheered. "Who the hell is that with Harry?" Dean pointed. Hold on to your horses, because shits about to get gay.
"Fine," Draco said with a smirk. The blond looked behind him to see Voldemort still enjoying his book and a tall glass of Butterbeer he stole from the teacher's lounge prior to coming here. Draco looked back to meet the latter's green eMeRaLd eyes. He leaned over and whispered something that made the boy shiver like he was in fucking Narnia. "You like that, Potter?" he whispered in his ear, knowing damn well what he just did.
Draco sighed softly, eyes still stuck at the blue waters. Again, well aware of who it was. "I've had better days" He responded with his usual reply.
"Bloody hell" They jolted up when they heard a sudden voice from inside the room. They sighed in relief when they realized what it is. "She's asleep" Blaise whispered, pointing at the lady. She was asleep on her rocking chair, facing out the window on the front side of the room. Only her back was visible from the kids' side.
"Hey. How's your first day going?" Harry asked once Draco stopped Harry outside the Great Hall, far away from the crowd.
"Listen to her, big mouth!" A Slytherin added, causing the group to erupt in laughter. Draco snapped his neck back at him and glared. "No. No. Only I get to make fun of him" The laughed died down and the Slytherin nodded.
"So, what are you waiting for?" McGonagall whispered to the man beside him as the two crept from behind the old ancient door. Snape furrowed and turned his hair filled head to her. "Are you encouraging him to kill Malfoy?"
Today is the day. Harry can't see Draco anywhere. He woke up that day with pride and joy that he might be able to finish this task like a champ. But now seeing that he can't find his baby anywhere—it's bugging him. What if he dies without him by his side? What if he dies without having the chance to say 'I Love You'? What if he dies?
sorry if it's bad. and sorry if it took me a few days to update, it was my birthday a few days ago and i wanted to spend it by doing absolutely nothing. lmao.
"So. How are you?" Lucius began, both still walking in the same slow pace. The corridors weren't filled with students, since most of them are probably somewhere in their house or out there exploring the grounds like Dora the Explorer. Which is a good thing, I suppose.
They were on their way to their second task. Cedric paid back the favor by helping Harry with his second task. But even with the help from a hot senior Harry still couldn't figure out the meaning inside that egg shit.
Harry chuckled softly, "Yes, it's okay. I thought I'd be angrier once I knew who the person—or people—who put my name in the goblet. Instead, I'm actually okay with it"
"He's not always... polite with him," Harry said, still watching his man walking away. They walk so slow.
"But he is a dick!" Ron exclaimed, raising his hand to make a point. Adding to the dramatics of it all. "Even if he doesn't have one"
Harry hates that Draco can easily do that to him. He looked down, trying to brush off the pink tint on his cheeks before turning back to Voldemort. "Thanks again, professor"
Harry's now with his best mates in their Gryffindor house common room, talking like normal teenagers should do, not roaming around the castle and attacking big snakes and three-headed dogs. They laughed and all that shit. Then it went silent. Which then sort of pushed Ron and Hermione to say this.
even more. He's kind of used to people talking and whispering behind his back, but this somehow feels different. He keeps acting like this badass bitch who gives zero fucks but honestly that's bullshit. If you ask Harry, he'll say that's false because Draco gives the best fucks.
The group grew very very close afterwards. From planning Draco's birthday party and then it being ruined by Filch, to Draco insisting on taking everyone back to the pub and Harry encouraging everyone to have their first shot. Let's just say, it did not end well. But they had the rowdiest time of their life. No dark wizards, no haunting childhood trauma, just teenagers being teenagers. And that's
"What's that thing Snape gave him?" Ron couldn't help but wonder. Harry knew what it was since he was quite involved in the masterminding process of this specific potion. No, not really. But he was sitting there when it all happened. "It's a monthly potion they gave Voldemort to drink"
Harry continued to laugh. "Sorry, sorry! But yeah, that's possibly it. We haven't actually — officially label us as anything but with the number of times we've been secretly seeing each other, it felt like we were together. We try not to... snog that often,"
The transfiguration professor turned to both Harry and Draco, who stood next to each other without a word. She sighed as she shook her head. "Detention, after last period" She informed before walking away, waving her hands, attempting to make room for her to walk away gracefully, followed by Severus Snape from behind like a lost dog.
Her sentence was stopped by the sudden appearance of none other than Headmaster Dumbledore. "Sorry for the interruption. But I'm gonna need to speak to Professor McGonagall outside"
"Everything" Voldemort replied shortly, sipping his butterbeer loudly as Snaped gaped him dramatically. Dumbledore turned to Draco and asked, "Would you still snog Harry if he looked more like Snape?"
He sighed before taking his bag, slinging it over his shoulder. He bent down and kissed Harry gently on his lips before messing up his boyfriend's hair like a boy petting their pet dog. "Good luck tomorrow. I know you can do it" He winked before walking to Voldemort and out the door.
"What?" Harry turned to him. In his grumpy tired voice, he said, "You said she's 90% correct. The rest is 10%. It's simple math. Please don't start a debate."
It was on Wednesday afternoon after their class was over. They were back fighting again over some stupid — well, honestly, over nothing — when the conversation somehow dragged into this.
"What is it now, Pans?" Blaise turned to him. She turned and groans quietly. "Why didn't anyone close the goddamn window?"
That day after that little yet important talk, Lucius invited Harry and Draco to go to the office and meet up with Narcissa. As Lucius continued talking with Voldemort, Harry asked Draco how it went. Which he could probably conclude it's good since his father is being nice to him and actually invited him to meet Narcissa. But Harry's dumb like that and decided to ask anyway.
"Only a few times. My family dragged me here when I was younger a couple of times—mostly to help my mom take care of the old lady living here"
"I can't swim, Harry. Please don't let me go" He quickly said. Harry nodded and held him tighter, "Yes, yes, love. Calm down, okay. I got you. Come on" He said softly before swimming back to the ground. They all ran up to him. Harry hurriedly let them help Draco up before himself and was quickly given a towel to dry up.
"Go on! Show him what you can do" Blaise added. Both Blaise and Pansy looked at each other knowingly. Finally getting his shit back together, he chuckled and looked back at him. "Of course Harry Potter would want a fight. Isn't that what you are? A man only born to fight a war?"
"Just tell them you two fought again. See? Easy" Voldemort shrugged, so did the boys. After a quick thank you and apologies, Voldemort walked them outside the room. He closed the door behind him and turned to them. "Now go back to your dorms. It's very late"
Hermione sighed. "It's Granger, Professor." He was still trying his best to keep his cool with muggle-borns, even if it means pronouncing their name wrong. Intentionally? We're not sure. But Hermione is okay with it. He's trying and that's what counts. "We'll be waiting outside," She told Harry in which he nodded in response. "Yeah, I'll meet you there. Just need to.. pack"
Snape turned to him, "Son, we make bets on every student here. How the hell do you think keeps us entertained in this dark gloomy castle?"
Leaving his two superior friends looking back at each other with a mirrored expression. Ron turned to Hermione once Harry was out of his sight, face still confused. "And you just believe him? As simple as that?"
"Well, I'm not gay, okay?!" His vision blurred, his head felt numb. He got up and turned to them, "Does that sound pretty clear to you?" His voice was dark and low with a growl. Top!Harry for the win. Hermione couldn't meet his glare and looked down, visibly scared she would say something disrespectful.
Draco saw Harry staring at him in awe and decided to flip him off, causing him to laugh and roll his eyes. Followed by Ron and Hermione who stood behind their friend. "Come down here, you punk"
Draco's Slytherin group, who were watching from up the tower, were hella confused when they saw Draco Malfoy emerging with Harry from the lake. "Is that Draco?" Pansy pointed from the highest spot of the water tower. Blaise nodded, "What the absolute fuck is he doing there?"
They all stayed quiet before Harry sorta, kinda, allegedly, shoved his boyfriend to step to the front and say something. "It's very very nice to meet you, Madam Thislethorps." He shakingly said, trying to look cool in front of a celebrity. She hums. "What do you want?" Draco opened his mouth. "Do you wanna free ticket for tonight's concert?" She continued before Draco could start. The rest of the kids' eyes twinkle with hope. "Yeah, no. That can't do. I have plenty of bar workers coming here, asking for tickets to give to their family members. But no can do! You have to pay to see the show! These boobs aren't going to be out for free, My Merlin!"
Draco nodded slowly. "So I guess we're even then?" He pursed his lips. Harry shrugged, "Yeah." he paused, "But I don't want this to go on,"
Harry didn't budge, still locking eyes with the Slytherin. "You've seen me in the field. I'm pretty sure you know what I'm capable of"
No wonder she made her way next to Draco the second she saw the opportunity. The boy looked disgusted at first, before retrieving with a smirk when he saw Harry staring at him. Acting as if he enjoyed the pair of boobs smashed into his upper arm.
"Who would want to use your bloody shirt, Malfoy? That's right. I'd rather sell my kidneys than use your overpriced trapeze tights" Malfoy gasped, "You disrespectful little cockroach. Wear them or I'll be the one selling your kidneys"
Snape groaned, "What are you idiots standing here for? Go! Before I sell your soul to the Dark Lord!"
"Why didn't you think of it before?" Hermione said, putting back her wand. Pansy chuckled and pointed, "I like her"
Harry visited that night, making him a cup of tea before having to leave to meet Ron and Hermione in the library. Yeah, he's aware no one from the other houses is allowed in, but Harry's always an exception. Draco sat down, pressing his palms against the now cold cup of tea. "How are you feeling, love?" A sudden soft voice asked. It was not from Harry.
"You guys never seem to stop, do you?" Voldemort looked at Draco and Harry. "It seems as if you're asking for detention." He shook his head and sighed like a god he is. "My tower, tonight!" He informed before walking away.
"Only the greatest witch singer of all time!" Ron exclaimed. Harry doesn't know who she is either. "She's famous?"
"Hey, bro!" He greeted with a wide smile, before dissolving when he saw the small vial in Snape's hand. "It's that time of the month, huh?"
"And what if he has?" Harry said with a fucking hot smirk. The group looked at each other and gasped quietly. Ron Weasley is really enjoying his popcorn. Pansy and a few others cursed when Draco came back with an oblivious remark. "What? Too scared to come out? Tell him, I'm one but not a homophobic lad"
"And it's not really common around here to have someone who's attracted to the same gender." Hermione said, "I was just scared and wanted to do my best supporting and being a good friend"
"Son," He said shortly. Ah, Lucius and his dramatic luscious hair. So dramatic that the second he heard his son is dating a boy none other than Harry fucking Potter, he insisted on meeting him in person. The father turned to Harry, holding his magic stick firmly. "Potter." Lucius and his magic stick is OTP material.
"It's the weekend!" Harry turned to the man of his dreams as he drags him by the wrist. "Don't tell me you're scared, Malfoy"
," Snape said, before following him out. Having no exact idea of what's going to happen. Title of his sex tape.
"Then let them," Harry said, intertwining his fingers with Malfoy's. "I'm proud to have you with me as a partner. Are you?"
Draco rolled his eyes and pushed him backward. They resumed their Wattpad's tongue fighting dominance shit. Draco helped Harry up on the table as the two continued to ruin the fuck out of each other. Weirdly, the wet noises of lip slapping weren't bothering Voldemort at all. He actually finds it rather soothing. Even the moans of Harry and Draco didn't seem to bother him—but it did stop them when he heard the sound of the doorknob trying to be pushed open.
Harry laughed, both continuing to walk. "Never thought that I'd get the chance to hear you say those words to me"
They held their breaths as they could see the shadow walking towards them. That is until they heard another voice coming from downstairs. "Ronald! Get down here this instant!"
Ron gasped at the accusation. "No, I don't!" Harry chuckled at his mate's reaction. "I just thought — we slept together!" Ron pointed at Harry and him. "In the same bed! I just thought he maybe, somehow, you ever had—"
The topic became a bit personal when it came to love and shit like that. Which was sort of like a cue for Voldemort and Snape to walk out. Narcissa never actually had a chance to talk and meet with Draco's past girlfriends—or whatever he wants to call it. Beards?
with truths and advice from Voldemort. Draco was very thankful for that. So the night after, he packed up his courage to go and talk to Narcissa, Draco Malfoy's mother. Which turned out, "Good, actually. Better than any conversations we had"
"Well, first of all," Draco said, pulling himself up so he's sitting up straight. The only few straight things he can do. "I didn't tell you I was.. you know... gay, because I was scared you two would hate me. Well, kinda. But it's also like, with my father and you know, we're Slytherins and all. And stereotypically, we can be.. a bit.."
"Well, I have someone particular in mind" Draco replied with a smug smile. Harry plopped back down next to him, handing him his cup of tea. Draco muttered thanks before blowing it and taking a sip. "But I'm not sure if he would want to go with me. He's too... famous to go out with someone like me" He said teasingly.
He never knew Hermione's lungs were capable of doing that. Harry quickly ran up to them, to Ron who's holding Hermione back before she punches another Slytherin in their pretty face. That went from zero to a hundred real quick. "What is going on?"
All these little things might trigger something in both the boys' hearts. He started to develop what they refer to as feelings. But neither one was a man enough to admit that.
After weeks and months of it, Dumbledore and the others trusted him to keep the magic off from his room. The magic that's holding him back from doing magic or shit like that. He was able to style his room based on his preference which is much more comforting. He also invited the professors to a weekly game night at his place. That is why McGonagall was a bit confused when Voldemort mentioned that they had to go through detention tonight.
"What the hell was that?" Pansy asked as they walked up the tower. Draco shrugged with a smile, "I don't know. The wizarding world has an amazing sense of humor"
"Yeah..." He's fucking speechless. What the fuck is this? He stared at Draco's back, trying to make sure he's not being delusional like us shippers. "What are you doing here?" Harry asked after he gulped.
"Are you admitting that I'm not a dick now? Well that's the best compliment you have ever given me so far"
Draco is tired of this bullshit, Donald. He rolled his eyes in annoyance. "Stop it, you're making me blush" His sarcastic tone hitting perfectly with the rest of the Slytherins.
The time jump here is probably like a two or three days after what happened in the hall. There were little buzzes about those shit but they couldn't give less fuck. It's gonna die down eventually. Harry said it himself, we can't control what other people think of us, just what we think about ourselves.
Ron and Hermione walked up to him. The three standing as he watched the group walked out of the hall, swaying their butts with grace. "Look at him." Ron said, "He's literally the replica of Voldemort."
Hagrid chuckled and nodded at Harry's statement. "Well, that's for certain. Alright then. I'll see you later, Harry" He said in his thick iconic accent. Harry waved from the sofa with a smile, "Bye, Hagrid!"
Harry tucked his hands inside the pocket of his coat before realized he had something stuffed at the bottom. He looked up, "Do you want some?" Harry asked. Possibly an attempt to make thing less awkward. They have never gone out publicly like this before, and with strangers chasing subtle glances at them, it's bound to get awkward at some point. Draco furrowed. "And what are you offering, exactly?"
"I'm literally shaking for you, Harry." She said genuinely. Ron joined Harry and looked up. "It's Thursday and you have nobody to take." Harry and Ron stayed quiet. "You're gonna embarrass yourself in front of millions of people. I mean, I get it if you don't want to take me. But take Ron instead,"
"Shove off, Malfoy." A nameless Slytherin bitch snarled, moving closer to Draco. Fucking hell. Draco didn't flinch as he stared right back. His actions turned Harry's
. Hermione said carefully, "I'm aware that we've always been trying to hook you up with a lot of girls lately and we want to apologize"
"Right," Draco said and nodded lowly. "I'll be right with you!" He told them before they walked inside the great hall.
There was also this one time in their eight-year common room when Harry walked in soaking wet with sweat and a bit of rain in the tips of his hair. He was helping Hagrid with a few things before it started pouring cats and dogs outside. From the look of it, it seems that he has missed most of the drops with the help of his vast flying technique yet not vastly enough for an impervius charm.
"Exactly," The two laughed. They walked past the entrance wing towards Hagrid's hut, since it's least likely anyone else would be there. "How about your friends?"
"Really? Am I not the type?" Harry asked curiously before Draco shrugged in response. "Yeah, I was meaning to ask. What did you think of me before we dated?" He genuinely wanted to know. Weird he has never asked this before. Draco shrugged, "I don't know really. Well at first I was completely pissed off that you rejected my friend request"
"Midna!" The bartender greeted, hands clasped against each other. Midna turned around with a small grin, "Yes, dear?" Before she noticed the group behind the bartender and grew a small smile. "Why, hello," She said in a fake(?) posh accent.
Draco chuckled, pulling his glass close to his lips, "No, I wouldn't" smiling cheekily at Severus and looking at Harry just to make sure he knew he was joking. Every living creature in the room laughed their guts off, clutching their stomach and wiping their tears like they wipe their butts.
Everybody turned to him and as I said earlier—he runs this precinct. The group watched as Draco walked up to the trio, shooting glares sharper than a mother in laws tongue. "Leave." The bad bitch but kind of a coward said sternly. Harry finds it hot—but don't tell anyone.
last night, Draco flew back to his room and handed him a little box from his mother, wrapped especially for him. Harry untied the little green ribbon on the box and awed at the revealed beautiful suit. It came with a handwritten note.
Seeing she was in a comfortable storytime manner, Harry started. "Well, it happened around last year. Let's just say he got... hot?" He shrugged with a smile.
The latter blushed after a short moment of surprise. She nodded and muttered a soft yes before a few students started cheering, leaving a smile on Pansy's face and a terrified look on Draco's. He rolled his eyes once the room went back to normal and he was left standing there with his rival partner, Harry Potter. "Staying true to your green house traits, I see" Harry's smug look forming back. "Are you that desperate to win by asking your gayest friend to go out with you? You amaze me every time, Malfoy"
dressed up for nothing" Eyeing his gorgeous suit. Draco smirked, "It's a surprise," He said as he snatched Pansy's glass and gulped it down. He grimaced. "What the fuck was that?"
Draco shook his head. "No, I haven't. Astoria has also been pining me all year — based on what Pansy told me. I think she's just waiting until I finally ask her out"
"Look!" Ron pointed inside. The rest joined in, looking through the cold blurry windows. Draco squinted in his attempt to see clearer, "Who? I can't see shit"
"Professor Voldy?" Ron whispered to his two friends. Hermione grimaced. "Ew. No. I take that back" The trio sat next to each other in the Defense Against the Dark Arts class, one of the many classes they share together. This is their first DADA class this year after their previous DADA professor decided he's better off pursuing a model career than being an underpaid boarding school teacher.
Harry nodded, "Yeah. You guys... don't seem too interested. Oh wait, I get it. I'm sorry. I should've told you earlier. I just thought when you two said you were okay with anything—"
"Well I don't need saving, do I?!" Draco clenched his jaw. This the most public fight ever since all three schools are watching them. "Uh, yeah you do! You were gonna die until I had to save you!"
The six listened to the agonising rage of a voice, possibly coming from downstairs. The man by the closet doors mumbled to himself, being heard clearly by the group inside the closet. "Dear Salazar," He shouted back, "Coming mother!"
The noseless and hairless fluffy monster looked around, seeing that there are still people just standing there and not cower away. "What are you all standing here for? Fuck off!" He waved his arm once before watching as students continued to spill back inside the castle.
"I'm so sorry" Draco apologized, "I had to go to the bathroom. To check my hair. Does it look good?" He asked, bowing
Draco looked back up and smiled softly, before finally nodding. "Of course, I am. You're right. It's about damn time I walk out there like the gorgeous bitch I am"
So when they shared their last period together—Astronomy—Harry sneakily lent his Invisibility Cloak and a note stuck on to it written,
"Huh, yes. Granger.  Well, dear Granger. Just in case you haven't noticed, we're in my class now. So, if I want to teach page 394," he paused dramatically, "then I will teach page 394!" He shouted obnoxiously loud. The class went quieter than silent. Realizing what he just did, Voldemort adjusted his cloak and cleared his throat before speaking a lot softer this time. "Am I clear, Ms. Granger?"
