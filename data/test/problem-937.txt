If a man’s home was his castle, his desk chair was his throne. Or as close as one could get in an office setting without drawing unwelcome attention. It practically made the decision for him. He waved his arm. “
Harry leans down and nips at the skin just above Draco’s belt. “Would you rather I suck something else?”
“Merlin, no. I mean,” he scrambled, as Harry’s face twisted, “yes, I want to very much. Very much. But I’m leaving, and you’ve never—You’ve never, right? With a man, at all?”
“Personnel who do not work for the Vanishing Department are not permitted in the department.”
“Maybe not. But they do.”
“Yeah, but they probably know that might not all be true, you know? Records are different. If I read a suspect’s actual MLE records, I’d take that a lot more seriously than a Rita Skeeter tell-all.”
“Hmmm. Very well then. Does it look familiar?”
“There’s a reason Granger and I are the only two members of the Reconstruction willing to perform the ritual. It could be a bit dangerous. The element of unpredictability only adds to that. We’d assumed it required two people, but it may be, if it has to be present, that the snake counts as one. Having a third shouldn’t be problematic, but it does raise the issue of the particular requirements involved in having you talk to the snake.”
You feel a jolt. Not in your chest. It’s low down, it’s in your cock, and it’s not how this was meant to go (spells or fists or not at all, but not…) but it’s there and he’s here, now, in front of you, with his brow raised and his lips quirked and it’s clear, it’s so clear.
“Does it have to be a time-turner to make a difference now?”
“This leaves us with a practical problem. It’s not uncommon for patients to experience an attraction like this. That, in and of itself, need not be an issue. But it does seem to unsettle you, to incite the same outbursts we’re trying to control. In which case—that is, when resolving repressed emotions is central to your recovery, and when this is causing distress or getting in the way of healing—it’s not ethical for me to continue treating you.
He sees Harry cant his hips, letting his legs slide back so he’s closer, so Draco can take more of him.
“I did get the impression,” Draco said, unsure of whether it was entirely mad or just a bit mad, “that there was a reason, though.”
Draco ran a hand through his hair. “Right. Well. Fine, then.” He started walking. “There’s Cornish hen, and some sort of tart for dessert.”
“Very well then.”
“Thought you knew,” he breathes, with a hint of a laugh.
“And much less vain. Which seven people are coming to dinner?”
Harry loosens his grip on Draco’s arm. “It’s breakfast.”
Draco looks between them, with a mounting sense of stone-cold horror. “No.”
“You’re a superb liar, Draco, but not to us.”
“Yes, thank you. I’m well aware, in spite of your doubts. Things like love, and appreciation, and caring. Not things like hoping they get scalded with hot tea.”
Potter gasped. He clamped down on it as soon as he could. Couldn’t take it back, though.
they’ve Vanished in the heat of the moment; perpetually flustered parents retrieving beloved toys, usually of the noise-making variety; and, Draco’s personal favourite since they’re most likely to be polite, a few wide-eyed house elves (or, he has to remind himself, “magical home service staff”) in search of items that have fallen victim to fits of boredom, anger, or some combination thereof.
“Something like what?”
I pulled on my boxers, assured him it was safe to look.
Draco slid further in, to the second knuckle, past it. Out again, and in. Harry didn’t move, either in pleasure or pain, aside from the quick rise and fall of his chest. “Still okay?”
He hadn’t. Nothing. The kitchen was entirely intact, as was everything in it, Pansy included. Draco had thought, in planning the tea party, that perhaps familiarity was a key, or safety. That had been a disaster, but when Potter was actually explosively angry, nothing.
Slowly, as if making sure he wouldn’t startle, Draco withdrew his hand. “It’s fine,” he said again, this time making no attempt to conceal the roughness in his voice. “Tell me?”
“Yes.” Draco raises an eyebrow. “I’m well-fucking-aware.”
Harry turned back reluctantly and cringed when he was met with Granger’s confused, expectant stare. She looked to Draco and back to Harry. “Harry? Please, what is it?”
Potter looked away, and didn’t look back again.
“Please,” Harry murmurs, looking up at Draco. “Let me touch you.” He presses his hand into the ridged outline of Draco’s erection, hoping that will be enough to make his meaning clear.
He tries to slow down. Wants this to last.
“Er…” he managed. “So sorry, I’ve got to…” he trailed off and nodded to the bird.
He thought of Potter’s trips to the kitchen, of his almost-destroyed seam. “Beyond what I’ve told you, given the particulars, I’m not sure it’s mine to tell.”
But he made it—they made it—and Draco found himself standing at the foot of the bed, Harry’s hand in his, pulling him closer, until they were toe to toe.
Harry thinks of Draco’s bedroom in the Manor, and all the rooms he’s never seen. He wonders if Draco will look as at ease at the dining table, or in the kitchen, or wherever it is they’re going to eat.
“And blew a lot of things up.”
“Yeah,” Harry went on. “To do the same thing you did today. Everyone else will be focused on the hearing, and you’re so quick at catching it that it’s almost like you know when it’s coming, and your reparative charms are strong. Besides which, today, knowing you were here and that you’d keep anything from happening, I felt—there were times when I think something might have happened, except that it calmed me down a bit, to know someone would stop it. That you’d stop it.”
“Spoken like someone who’s never seen a Mind Healer.”
She pursed her lips. “If you don’t drive us out, there’s still Potter to worry about.”
Harry shakes his head. “Fine. Fine. Do you have a trolley or something?”
Draco blinked slowly. His stomach twisted as the pieces began to fall into place. “Are you telling me? Merlin. It’s not an implant, is it?”
Draco barely—just barely—resisted saying no. Instead he said, “Certainly, Auror Robards. Potter shows remarkable improvement in terms of power. He is able to cast stronger and stronger spells, and to sustain them for longer. We are beginning to explore the possibility of wandless casting as well.”
“Ah. Right. Uh. Probably ought to be getting back, really. Mates’ll be wondering.”
He smacked the file down on the coffee table in frustration. He’d left strict instructions that he was not to be interrupted.
Draco followed him without a second thought. He ran his hand up Harry’s leg, tracing gently over the line of muscle that hid the Wand from view, over his hip, up his side, still not touching his prick, not yet. He looked up, first, to see Harry biting his lip and watching Draco carefully.
“Very well.” Draco let his eyes flicker shut for a moment. “I will visit in the morning. Are my rooms ready now?”
Something about the way he says it makes Draco wonder if he really did. He quirks an eyebrow at Harry. “Did you?”
An echo sounded through the room as he took a tentative step. Harry reached out for another light, and then another, and another, and another, and then another, and startled when his fingers touched icy glass. A split second later he realised he was seeing his own hand reflected back to him. A mirror.
“Thank you,” Shacklebolt continued. “Ms Bulstrode, where were we?”
Harry was there, in his bedroom, wanting him.
* * *
“Though you’ve yet to supply your own topic of conversation.”
“Yes, exactly. Alistair Flint’s sponsoring. Stayed far enough out of the war to get away with that sort of thing, but that doesn’t mean he’s unattached to the idea of blood status. Still a Flint, you know.” Millie quirked her mouth and shrugged. “He’s made the bill long enough that half the Wizengamot can’t stay awake for the entire reading, and he’s made it sound good enough – the Status, Ancestry, and Family Equality Act – that most won’t bother. Meanwhile, he’s set himself up to argue that the Ministry can’t protect Muggle-borns and half-bloods unless we know who they are. Says it’s too easy for people to plead ignorance even when they know full well that they’re refusing to hiring a Muggle-born, or what have you. So the only way to protect them is to require everyone to register their blood status, at the first sign of magic for purebloods and half-bloods raised in the wizarding world and at Hogwarts for everyone else. As you might imagine, the Minister is rather concerned about how such a law might be abused.”
“I have overseen Harry’s care from the very beginning.”
Hermione jumped in before Ron could clarify. “No one’s asking you to. It’s more…” She trailed off.
“And if I’m too bloody angry for that?”
Potter’s still looking nervous, now with a hint of the caged animal about him. “How should I know? It’s a black napkin.”
“Then where?”
“The front desk,” Harry said. “Why?”
“Oh?”
“No.”
“Proving my point quite well here Blaise.”
“No,” Potter spat. “No,” he said again, stepping back and dropping his fistful of fabric. He opened his mouth to say something else, but stopped short when Draco’s robes caught his eye.
Draco stopped when Harry’s cock was revealed, hard and red, jutting up from thick brown curls. His hand moved towards it, over the soft skin stretched over Harry’s hipbone, to the edge of his hair.
“Are you—?” Harry paused. “Have you changed your mind?”
“The first event, on the 5th. What’s it for?”
's beautiful illustration of Harry and Draco's time in the conservatory
“I imagine this, most honourable Warlocks.” Harry paused as though to collect himself. “And imagine the fear that would have overwhelmed me. How insignificant I would have felt, to learn that my place in our world was predetermined by people who I had never known, whose names I did not know. What does it mean, to a child, to learn that before being a member of this magical community, or a student at Hogwarts, or a member of their house, they are the product of their ancestry?
Harry doesn’t look up, won’t risk Malfoy seeing the dampness gathering in the corners of his eyes. He mumbles into the wool, instead. “You’re just going to stand there?”
He did another one. Puffed out his cheeks and pulled his head back till his chin doubled, and started croaking at me. A frog.
“Right.” Draco swallowed. He was parched. “This requires Auror Potter and I to be in…. association?”
Draco’s brow furrowed. He wanted to ask what Harry meant, but felt very certain that he didn’t have the right.
Draco was relieved that Harry didn’t feel the need to elaborate on the point.
Harry opened his legs wider.
More to come, I suspect. Potter’s promised to teach me how to sand a plank this morning, and he’s sent an owl to Hogwarts for permission to stay in London tonight. That gives us the whole day here together, and if I spend the whole time eating soggy rashers and performing Muggle construction tasks, I somehow still suspect it will be too short.
“You’re welcome.” Another few seconds’ silence. Draco felt tension, but suspected it was him alone. “Are you sure you wouldn’t benefit from a drink or something to eat?”
It relaxes him, too. I seize the moment, sliding a second finger alongside the first.
Draco turned and left the room without being able to find another word.
“I won’t discuss this unless we go outside.”
“But you’ve seen—”
“You’re going to fill out a form? Now?”
He found at least one, though the look on his face before I admitted my involvement – “Potter, are you responsible for that damnable racket?” with my best charming smile – was priceless. He was further along in the post-practise process than I’d expected, given the racket and the degree to which it had him flustered. He’d got as far as his jeans and trainers and a t-shirt thrown over one shoulder, his hair still damp and sticking up wildly in every direction, eyes darting around the room like a confused Crup.
He just looked at me, head cocked to one side as though he was curious about something, and said, “You know, Malfoy, you take yourself way too seriously.”
“And that’s a problem because?”
Shacklebolt folded his hands on the edge of the table. Granger coughed.
“As you usually do. Shoes and fucking.”
“I’m glad to hear that.”
“Oh, put your bloody jumper on.” Draco chucks it at him.
The elf popped up behind him, and he clenched his fists to avoid startling like the Bloody Baron had just come through the table.
“Yes.”
“That they are. But we’re Wizards, remember? What’s an Episky between—” he paused. “Between us. Unless you’re planning to curse them off?”
“He wouldn’t have,” Harry said, without knowing why he said it. What would make him believe it.
“Keep touching me and—” Draco gasps at the twist of Harry’s wrist. “I’m gonna come.”
“An order?” Draco furrowed his brow, wondering if that’s how they’d put it to him in the Department of Mysteries. “No. I don’t give orders. It’s a request I’d ask you to consider.”
“Well, it was kind of a lot of things.”
“No,” Blaise conceded, resting a hand on Millie’s knee. “And I’m happy that I didn’t. But if I had, and I hadn’t ever known what I was missing, I probably would’ve been happy with that, too.”
Harry looked sceptical still, and took the corner of the settee closest to Draco’s chair.
“Already?” The note of panic has returned.
The Apparition point at L’Arpège was tucked between the kitchen and the toilets, and it didn’t put Draco in the best mood to begin with. None of it did. He’d had to cut short a meeting to make it, even after accounting for the ten minutes he wanted to keep Shacklebolt waiting, and it would’ve been a beautiful day for a walk if the restaurant weren’t quite so far from his office. And he wasn’t even sure why he’d agreed, save that Mill had asked and he got to put lunch at L’Arpège on the Ministry’s tab. He might have had some grudging sympathy for the Minister, but that didn’t extend to an interest in working with him on some other mad project that required upturning his life to, what? Save the Ministry from itself? The no was on his tongue before he’d even set foot in the dining room.
Harry obeys, trying to brush his fringe out of his eyes. Draco slaps his hand way, smoothing the hair back over Harry’s forehead so gently Harry can barely feel the pressure of his fingers. “Idiot,” Draco mumbles.
“Physically? Magically?”
Potter blanched.
“We started speaking here and there, and we’ve worked together quite a bit since. He’s got his practice at Titchwell. Works for the Muggles, mostly, though technically the Ministry, too. He’s been very helpful with my research. Dean’s as well. He’s opened up over the years, bit by bit. Except,” Luna hesitated. “If you come up, Harry. He either gets angry or clams up completely.”
“Oh.” Potter’s tone was inscrutable. “Well.”
“Yeah,” Draco exhales, and his voice shakes. He’d hate that if it were anyone else.
And we’re supposed to
“Hold them as long as you can, and as steadily as you can, but don’t let yourself reach the point where you experience physical discomfort or feel as though you would be unable to cast if needed.”
On closer inspection, the tomatoes are looking so dubious that he doesn’t even want to lift them. He levitates them instead. No use risking a formerly-crisp white Oxford, even if his robes will cover it. The newspapers will have to do for a more satisfying noise.
Draco shook his head slowly. “I don’t think I can.”
Any pretence of restraint has disappeared. His hips buck into my mouth, the head of his cock butting against my throat as he descends into abandon.
“Fuck,” Harry repeated. “Yeah, what—” he was cut off again as Draco pulled out and pushed in again.
The sound of his teeth jars Harry to action. “Please, come in.” He stands aside.
When he opened them again, Draco’s were filled with a sort of steely determination that Harry hadn’t seen in an age. Draco leaned forward as though to whisper some encouragement in Harry’s ear. Harry’s breath caught when Draco licked his way up Harry’s neck instead, not pausing until he was rolling Harry’s earlobe between his teeth.
“Oh, Pansy.” Draco drops his head into his hands.
He looks up at me and he’s wild-eyed, suddenly, gripping my shirt, grabbing my jaw and pulling my face in line with his. “No, No— that’s not. It’s not that, fuck, it’s not that.”
“Don’t you want to be still?”
"Right!" Lee laughed good naturedly, though the crease in his forehead wasn't giving, and Draco could feel his curiosity turning to scrutiny. "I have seen it, yeah. Fair enough, mate. Er, you've got home from work and discovered a break in, and you need him to agree to meet you there and take a report."
“Good. As you know, I start from the assumption that you respond to strong emotional stimuli. The most obvious seem to be negative. Frustration, sadness, anger, anxiety—emotions that come easily and create destructive magic.”
“Draco,” he murmurs, “I want you. I’ve been wanting you for weeks. I’ve been dying for you since you ran off on Tuesday.”
“Are you seeing anyone?” Harry asked, all in a rush as if he’d been holding it in.
The first tests are fine. A bit thrilling, if Harry’s honest about it. After Phillips is satisfied that he’s mastered the jump, he tries moving left, first. Does a quick spin and reverses direction. He can’t help grinning, or sneaking a look at Draco as he does. He’s relieved to see something softer in Draco’s eyes. Relieved and exhilarated, he tries for a flip, just as he would on a broom.
Draco let the ball drop.
“Thought I would give up everything I’ve worked for, risk a trip to the FSA, just because you asked?”
“Not some painful, disgusting trial?”
“I, uh. I’m done.”
I stroke his prostate again, and hollow my cheeks to suck him in.
He forced himself to shove the last 24 hours aside and slid into a mask of pure professionalism. “Time flies when you’re working tirelessly.”
“You’re unbelievable.”
It was all Draco could do not to dive in and suck him. He wanted Potter in his mouth, wanted to taste him.
He watches the way Harry’s biceps flex as he unbuttons his shirt, thrills at the sound of his belt sliding through the loops.
Malfoy is waiting for him, looking cross. He stares pointedly at the clock, then at Harry, and raises an eyebrow. Harry bristles under the scrutiny. His obvious displeasure doesn’t deter Malfoy, who looks him over, eyes trailing toes to top. Harry shivers. It’s chilly in here. He’s beginning to regret his indifference to the weather and related charms.
“You’ve already managed it quite a few times.”
“Mmm,” Harry agrees, with a grin.
“If you’ll use your wand, I’ll hand it over now.”
“This isn’t about that!” Draco yelled.
“Except for you.”
Granger leaned forward and said Harry’s name aloud, as a question.
Draco shook his head and traced the pattern at the end of the silver. “This isn’t like that.”
- Occasional visits from Weaselette, Lovegood, younger Creevy
“You thought you’d never…?”
Draco has a drinks cabinet in his office for the obvious reasons: loosening informants’ lips, putting troublesome staff at ease before a good bollocking, an occasional congratulations for some intrepid reporter or other, drinking.
“You see, I’ve been putting all of my considerable resources into this case, and just before you told me you’d decided to take another route, I discovered what I believe to be a significant breakthrough. A comprehensive theory that would explain your symptoms and present a viable alternative course of treatment.”
“Hmmm.”
“About leaving or about me?”
Potter’s face falls. “What?”
? You think you fucking
He didn’t notice my silence until he noticed that I’d stopped working. It was my brush he followed, first and foremost. When he saw that it had stilled, he turned to me. Smiled. “C’mon,” he urged. I began, in that moment—that guileless, irrepressible moment—to believe in Harry Potter.
“Yeah,” Draco breathed, and even that got a reaction, as Harry lifted his hips in search of Draco’s lips.
“Ah,” the portrait pauses. “My apologies. This young man of yours.”
“Yeah,” Draco repeated, beginning to gather himself. “It’s part of why I left, though. To be able to figure it out without the spectre of the war overhead. Maybe that means I already knew.”
.” This time the frown didn’t disappear. His muscles tensed and his jaw began working. His fingers tensed around his wand, and he balled his free hand into a fist. The appearance of anger took him over faster and more entirely than the others had. These flowers shot from his wand, landing in a jumble of purple and red.
“Yes,” Draco nods. “Stored. Past tense.”
“Exactly.”
Harry nods, struggling to press harder against Draco’s flies.
“Whereas you’re engaged in, what, conceptual, abstract world-saving via wine and cheese nights?”
“Figure of speech.” Draco raised his eyes to the ceiling in a silent prayer for patience. As he looked back down, it slid into a grin. “Unless you’re into that kind of thing.”
Then his hands were on his cloak, unclasping it, and he cast a warming charm, and I saw his fingers go to the hem of his jumper, and he lifted it over his head. He’s losing his summer tan and his skin was brilliant in the moonlight. And he said it again, “Okay?” Like a question. A question he was asking me. Was I okay?
“I’m glad.” Harry smiled. “Want to put them on the settee, or shall I?”
“Other than manners, clearly.” Merlin, it felt good to say it. After hours of holding in any thought that wasn’t entirely politic, after days stewing in his own nerves, it felt as good as anything. Even if Potter’s clenched fist suggested that it was as ill-advised as it was cathartic.
. Fuck. Potter means it, he always means it. Without a response, he’ll stop, and that’s the worst idea Draco’s heard in as long as he can remember. He runs a newspaper, he goes to pitch meetings, and this is still the worst, the most untenable, thing he’s heard in an age.
Draco stood, nodded, and gestured for them to sit.
She choked on a bite of scone.
Okay, then. That was answer enough.
“Pretty sure it’s in there to stay.”
His knees are liquid by the time Draco stands behind him. He feels the weight of Draco’s cock press against his arse again. He’s got no desire to move, let alone object. It’s all he can do to stay standing.
Potter threw his weight into the great oak doors, his shoulder colliding with a painful-sounding thud.
Draco smirked and hit the intercom. “Kate, bring in the invitations.”
“Yes, Master Draco.”
“You wound me. Blaise, darling, how shall I ever recover?”
The air rushed out of Harry’s chest in an instant. He was speechless. He shook his head and tried to lift a shoulder.
Harry slips his hand into Draco's and raises an eyebrow. Draco breathes, and nods, and they dance.
“For—bed?” Harry asks, eyes flitting nervously upwards at the ceiling and, presumably, the bed above them.
Draco studied him. “How are you feeling?”
“Fuck, Malfoy,” Harry murmured, still speaking to the once-again dormant box.
“Please Draco, please, your hand.” “Merlin, fuck, touch me, please.” “Draco, I can’t – I can’t, oh, fuck, just like that,
“No, no. Wouldn’t want the Ministry to look like a bunch of bullies. They’re calling off the investigation. Pursuing new youth programming. It’s over.”
“Will it?” Malfoy smirked.
“Same address?”
“I’m wanking right now. I can come just like this, come on your arse and be done with you. Is that what you want?”
“Do you promise that if it looks like something dangerous, you’ll stop it?”
“A clock?” Potter’s face lights and his eyes follow it as Draco adds it to the row. He looks half-ready to follow it the thing.
“No, it doesn’t, and that’s exactly it. The thing is, he got really, properly upset at Pansy, didn’t he? ‘You ungrateful bitch,’ all of that. It’s been years since I’ve heard Potter say anything like that—well, obviously, but I get the impression that it’s been years since anyone has.”
“Granger.”
“Even in your natural habitat?” Potter retorts with an easy smile.
Harry grinned.
Draco felt—and promptly quelled—a wave of smug satisfaction. He hadn’t noticed any such thing, but clearly he’d hit a nerve. “Goodness, Potter, did you think it was subtle? Does Robards need to send you back to remedial covert ops?”
“Yeah,” Harry choked out. “Yeah.” His eyes snapped into focus. “Heard you.”
“I hope you said yes.”
“Nothing
Draco’s fingers itched to touch. He held himself still. “Aren’t you tired of running?” He almost wished he hadn’t spoken. His voice had felt like thunder, roiling the quiet. Inviting the deluge.
“No, you don’t,” Harry agreed, quiet but unequivocal.
He smiled. “Don’t want to end up wandering around like a drunk… you know.”
Galder shuffled forward, holding out a silver tray with the letter at its centre.
And so they go on like that. Draco takes meticulous notes. Potter’s attempts to interject dwindle towards zero. By the time they move from crockery to glassware, they’ve almost established a pattern. Potter lists items and stares at Draco. Draco ignores him and asks for additional description. Potter tries his occasionally adequate best to describe things and stares at Draco some more. Draco ignores him and retrieves the items. Repeat.
“Have I? What then, just a little nostalgic face-fucking? Bit of a suck down memory lane?”
“Of course not,” Draco spits. “What do you think you’re playing at?”
There are, Draco thinks, a number of fairly obvious conclusions to draw from the war. Dark Lords: terrible house guests, generally not to be trusted. Parents: occasionally quite useful, but disappointingly fallible. Epic battles: more terrifying, less exciting than advertised. Politicians: exceedingly stupid, unfortunately promiscuous in their receptivity to favours. No loyalty anymore, his father had proclaimed shortly before leaving the country, as though hearkening back to some probably-mythical age when Wizengamot members had been loyal flunkies.
Blaise shrugged. “Discovery is a wonderful thing.”
Instead, he looked. At the slim ring of emerald green around Potter’s pupils; at his arched throat working to swallow; at the flush rising on his chest. He felt, too: Potter’s heels in his back, the musculature of Potter’s arse when Draco’s hips met it, the pleasure shooting through his cock, radiating through his legs and up his spine.
I open my mouth to respond, but he cuts me off. I’m almost too shocked to find it rude.
“I didn’t think it had been nothing. I did think it had been just that one night. That that was part of how you’d made the decision—by squaring yourself to a one-off and avoiding anything that could’ve muddied the waters.”
“I’m sure they didn’t say that.”
“And if I felt like that either way?”
“More than a thousand,” Draco conceded. “But the point remains.”
“What is she saying?” Granger looked between them anxiously.
“Because,” he repeats.
“Thank you,” Draco said. He meant it, though he wasn’t sure what it was for. “I am. I am trying. I think I can do some good.”
“Whatever you want.”
“It’s not your decision to make.”
“And when that’s not possible?” Draco asked, resisting the tide of anger that swelled in his chest. “Do you give up? Offer them a quick AK?”
not afraid of you.”
“As we have no other business for today, clear the bench.”
“Eurostar. St. Pancras to Gare du Nord, two and a half hours.”
Draco tried, as best he could, to ignore the reaction. “Well done.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. “You wouldn’t.”
“Is there anything left in the damn house?”
Pansy
“Of course I am.”
Harry’s shin guards drag against the bedding. His boots are probably staining Draco’s robes. But the feel of cool leather against his sides more than compensates as Harry comes into place over him, bracing himself against the headboard.
“Really?” Harry dropped his arm to the table and leaned closer still. It was interesting work; he could see the potential. “Could it work with other curses, too?”
Potter shook his head. “You really—” He inhaled slowly and exhaled again, looking as though he was fighting to stay calm. “It’s not Hermione’s fault.”
Outside, it seems. At least it doesn’t smell.
“The benefit. Are you going?”
He won’t look away from Harry’s eyes. Won’t break eye contact and give him the advantage of an extra second to search for the Snitch.
"You weren't bored a minute ago."
“I’m apologising.”
Harry tugs Draco’s shirt tails free, spreads shirt and robe both, and bends to place a kiss on his sternum. It’s light at first, almost tentative. Then another, firmer.
When he opens it, he reads:
“I see. And you’re a literary agent?”
“Barely.” He reached back with his free hand. There was nothing more than the slightest hint of lingering warmth. “Not at all. And we know the way around it, if you’re worried.”
“No?” Draco prompted.
I resist the urge to watch; I hope it can wait for another time.
Draco pulled up abruptly. “Mother. Father. How good to see you.”
But even if the interest was mutual, it was untenable. Draco was leaving. Harry was Harry, his patient; and Harry Potter, Chosen One and Saviour; and Harry Potter, famous Auror; and Potter, his schoolboy enemy. The history between them, and the drama that would explode around them, made it untenable. Draco would return to France, to a life he’d finally been able to make to suit himself, first and foremost. Harry would go back to being Harry Potter. There was a logical end to all of it
"Excellent! Let's get to it then, shall we?"
Potter gaped at that. It was delightfully guileless, and Draco’s stomach graduated from somersaults to cartwheels.
“Where outdoors?”
Of course, Malfoy didn’t actually miss a beat. “What kind of art is it if it serves its meaning up on a platter and doesn’t engage with the viewer at all? If it exists simply as a passive object?”
You haven’t had a heartbeat since –
I might’ve thought he was bucking into my fist, but Potter is not the first man to pull away from these advances. In their fits of locker room envy, no one considers the drawbacks to an endowment like mine. But I have become familiar with the shy dismissals, the conciliatory hand jobs, the “why don’t we instead”s. That I thought better of Potter would be a testament to my own stupidity, if he wasn’t going to follow through.
“We’ll reveal everything to the press once it’s over, of course. We think they’ll probably catch on to the, uh, associating.” Robards had the good grace to look a bit sheepish at the enormity of his understatement. “Relying on it, a bit. But it’s not— Our background checks reveal that you both have the appropriate proclivities for such a mission.”
“Plan to return?”
“Thank you.”
Millie’s eyebrows shot up. “He did?”
“It’s good,” Potter said.
Harry followed along, though perhaps more due to the proximity of Draco’s hip to his morning wood than to any interest in obeying a Malfoy.
Harry scanned the room for something he could use to hold Malfoy in place. There weren't any curtains, no reason for there to be rope lying around, and he didn't want to pull his wand.
But when he did,
“Jacket. Need it. Meet you at the door.”
“I’ll send her a letter tonight. Are there better times for you?”
That was where Lobsey found him, bearing a note from Potter that suggested 2pm. Draco accepted graciously, and tried to figure out what to do with the next four hours.
She sized him up and nodded. “Of course.”
“Shut
“No.” Harry’s eyes were wide. “Don’t think so.”
“Breakfast? You’re hungry?” Draco’s heard crazier things after sex, but it doesn’t seem proportionate to Harry’s nervousness.
After another’s moment’s pause, Harry started heading for the door.
Harry’s tension began to ease. Draco saw his body relax, bit by bit, his shoulders falling into the pillows, his hips beginning to move in time with Draco’s hands.
“Draco.” Pansy set her saucer down with enough insistence to rattle the whole set. “Even in your altered state, I can’t imagine it’s escaped your notice that Harry Potter has moved into your ancestral home.”
Spells to give Draco time to think, more or less. His usual diagnostics weren’t proving fruitful. The records weren’t yielding any answers. The only hints he’d got were during their walk, and that hadn’t told him anything either, though it had been more interactive than the rest of the tests, and he wasn’t in any sort of position to be turning owls away before they’d delivered.
“Eyes closed?”
Potter always did have to be the exception. Or Granger always did have to let her overconfidence get the best of her sense. Or maybe, he conceded whilst, very briefly, feeling more charitable, the Elder Wand was too particular to work with an implant. Or there was something else at play that had been mysteriously excluded from the official records even in their unexpurgated form.
“I’m bending over,” he retorted, the hint of a smirk returning.
“No.” Potter throws his hands up. “Of course not. I get it. You don’t care. You don’t give a Skrewt’s arse what I do. I can fuck anyone at all. I could go fuck Lee Jordan and Luna Lovegood at the same time for all you care, as long as your paper gets the exclusive. Look me in the eye, Draco, and tell me that’s true.”
He gripped his knife and fork and waited for his dinner to appear. “Bugger. Off.”
The office is bigger than he’d expected. Almost vast. It’s got floor to ceiling shelves with an astonishing array of whirring, beeping, blipping devices that jump and shake and rattle neighbouring boxes.
Harry grins up, even more obviously pleased with himself. “So, your cock.”
“All of it? The… everything.”
“And have them sell it to the papers? No way.”
“Yeah. Know how that goes. Heard you had a meeting with Kingsley and Gawain and John?”
Sydney grinned and kissed the leaking tip of his prick before taking it back in his mouth.
Harry coughed after a moment. “We should probably go tell Hermione and McGonagall.”
Pansy hissed at the name. Even Mill and Blaise looked a bit taken aback, though Draco wasn’t sure whether it was at the name or the sentiment.
“What
Aside from random observations—some of them unmissable, as when Finnigan and the Weasley twin set the edge of the marquee on fire with some sort of firework—Draco made sure to have his attention on Potter at all times.
“Yes, well. It’s Tuesday.”
Scepticism turned to a surprisingly thinly-veiled suspicion. “I’d still like to know.”
He pauses, looks away.
And Draco does look. Harry arches to let him and perhaps unknowingly, Draco takes a step towards him.
“Oh, Merlin. That sounds ominous.”
“Which would still be more comfortable than Blaise’s ‘chaise lounge,’” she sent up exaggerated air quotes, “but honestly, even his ‘avant-garde’ cocktails have to be better than whatever swill the Ministry is serving up in the North Sea.”
“Should I consult with his secretary, then?”
“Apparently, as you managed to differentiate between hungry-looking black ceramic Kneazle statue, deranged-looking black ceramic Kneazles statue, and angry-looking black ceramic Kneazle statue.”
“Have you had dinner yet? I know it’s late.”
“Oh, darling. About this?” She shook her head. “Grab a quill. I’ve got a hotel address for you.”
The silence that follows is so complete that Draco suspects he could hear a quill drop. He can’t resist the urge to fill it. “We are prepared to make a retraction—also in blind form, so as not to name names, as I assume you would prefer—which I will oversee myself.”
“Fuck.” Draco steeled himself, hands and knees braced against the mattress. A drop of sweat dripped from his brow. “You feel,” he gasped, “so fucking good.”
Draco’s champagne sloshed in its glass when Pansy nudged his shoulder. “That was well done.”
His attentions were returned and he found himself pressed against the bar, the hard oak top pressing into his back and forcing his pelvis forward. His body met Malfoy’s and he rolled his hips, searching for evidence of returned interest.
Draco wasn’t entirely sure whether the comment was directed at him, but either way he had the impression that none of the potential replies that came to mind would be met well.
“If necessary.”
“No, it’s okay. And it is interesting. And love might be better.”
“Do you…?”
“But I want to know what happens to it.”
“Certainly.” He tugged his suit jacket into place and straightened his cuffs. “You know the way?”
Slughorn’s a possibility, always an ear to the ground, but he’s not exactly keeping too many upper year Slytherins around, except Blaise.
over the image. He spares a frown for Higsbee, who urges him to keep going.
“It’s confidential.” He shrugged.
She shook her head. “Besides which, what if it is disruptive? Did it never occur to you—it is all such a distant memory to you that you’ve completely forgotten—that the Ministry might not be entirely keen on respecting the wishes of a couple of ne’er do well former junior Death Eaters? That there might be things it’s unwise to tell the Ministry?”
The bottom dropped out of his stomach.
“I feel tired, kind of heavy? But I don’t think it’s achiness.”
Robards beat Weasley to the punch this time. “What measures are those?”
A delicious question. “Post-war reconciliation, Potter. Hadn’t you heard?”
“Would you like to have a seat?”
“Let’s find out.” Draco walked towards it, leaving Potter gaping behind him.
Draco tries not to roll his eyes. Or smile.
He sighed and sat up, ruffling his fingers through his hair. He certainly should have been tired enough to sleep. It was late. He’d spent a full shift catching up on paperwork before Malfoy’s event. He’d fallen asleep on harder surfaces—on pavement, on wood pallets, in Muggle tents, maybe even in a pub booth or two. It wasn’t like he’d spent a lifetime growing accustomed to creature comforts. But he hadn’t always felt this electric restlessness then, this totally inability to settle.
“How are they protected?”
“Past tense, yes.” Draco sighed. “I don’t know about the present. I haven’t seen you in six months.”
“It’s good money.”
Interesting. Very interesting.
He led me to the bed. But he didn’t – didn’t lead me, that is. I’ve been pulled into my fair share beds, or pushed onto them. Shoved against cupboard doors and into alcoves. I’ve lured men and women in with promises and filthy words and bargains. When I say he lead me to bed, I don’t mean any of that. There was no inducement. Having established that we both wanted to be in bed together, he walked over to the bed and perched on the foot of the mattress. It was entirely up to me to join him or, I suppose, not to.
“But where’s the fun in that?”
“We’re all over there,” he pointed, “on the right, if you’re looking straight on, towards the back.”
“Is the sneak attack on purpose?”
“I’ll stay for the hearing, of course. I’ve promised him I will. But after that, there’s really no need.”
“Hmm.”
“Nothing.” He sighed. It had begun to die out and cool, and he poked at it. “Potter.”
Harry looked only very minimally mollified. “If it’s a problem, you don’t have to. There’ll be other people there.”
Nor did the raised voices he could hear through the door.
Draco was frozen to his spot, just inside the doorway. The room was how he’d left it, but Pansy and Greg were not. Even as he stooped to meet the scale of the room, it was clear that Greg was squarer, taller and more muscular. It was a working man’s heft, the bulk of someone who used his body as a counterweight to things even larger than himself, not the doorway-blocking rotundness of a school bully. And Pansy… Draco couldn’t place the sense that she’d got smaller, sharper. The watchfulness she’d carried about her was different, the pointedness somehow less barbed. It wasn’t that he’d expected they would stay frozen in time, forever the seventeen year olds in need of refuge. Except, perhaps he had.
“I needed a plan first. To avoid getting sucked back in, and to keep it from being a scandal. Pansy pointed that one out, actually. That if I left they’d just smear me in the papers.
Malfoy pauses, as if waiting for an objection. After a moments pause he
Five minutes after he was meant to arrive, the maitre’d led Draco downstairs. It was quickly apparent that he needn’t have shown Draco to the table. The entire downstairs was conspicuously empty, with Shacklebolt’s shining head straight in front of him. To his left, Millicent’s blunt bob. To his right, with hair that was still unmistakeable on such a humid day, Granger, whose presence was almost enough to make Draco turn tail, if only because he was loathe to join any sort of team that thought Granger might be persuasive.
Harry sighed. “I know you think a lot of the events we’ve talked about are frivolous, but this is different. It isn’t. It’s important that I go.”
He was breathing deeply, eyes closed. Trying to steady himself.
Potter tilts his head. “Looked a bit lost in thought.”
“Is that what would happen if they took it out? I wouldn’t be able to do magic?”
As he’s imagined, Draco’s just as pressed and starched underneath his robes. His shirt is a crisp white, his trousers immaculately ironed, his belt so perfectly matched to the fabric that Harry doesn’t see it at first.
He opened the door and stepped into the room, glowing gold by the light of the sconces.
Higsbee blanches.
“Suitable for what, exactly?”
“I see,” Draco said, barely bothering to suppress a smile.
“Enjoy your trip!” Draco waved, and stayed exactly where he was.
“Answers.” Some things, Harry couldn’t bring himself to joke about.
Harry sat onto his knees, stretching around to find Draco staring at him. He looked a bit more contemplative than Harry was used to at this particular point in the proceedings and, Harry thought, a bit lost.
“We had a deal.”
“No?” Malfoy repeated. He turned his head to raise an eyebrow at Harry. “No?”
The cold of the hearthstone shot through Draco’s every bone. He couldn’t think of anything that would be so urgent and secretive without being a sign of trouble. He gripped the jamb for support, suddenly lightheaded as the blood drained from his face.
"Depends on who you ask," Malfoy replied smoothly. "Though, speaking of arses, if we're to include those you might begin to have something to work with."
His mother. Who he is unusually close with.
- Does subscribe to and read all available Quidditch periodicals
“Yes, that would be fine.”
He looks back up to Draco and raises his eyebrows.
“Now what?”
Harry’s voice grew sombre. “Now imagine, if you will, another step in that journey. A table waiting outside the Great Hall, where you are asked to tell someone the names of your parents and grandparents and great-grandparents. Imagine, as an 11-year-old child, stunned by the beauty of the castle, being told that before you may enter—before you can become a part of this wondrous thing you have just discovered—you must tell the Ministry about your mother and father, their mothers and fathers, and their mothers and fathers before them, that all of this will be recorded in the Ministry’s records.
“That’s one word for it.”
Harry looked at Malfoy. He thought Malfoy’s eyes looked darker, thought his lips looked fuller. Wished he’d picked up Legilimency at some point along the way. It was too late for that now.
“So it would seem.”
“I did. Do. But they’re half Kneazle.”
Potter smiled faintly. “I imagine you’ve already gone over the details of the treatment plan with Hermione and Millie?”
,” Granger hissed. “You might not bear the mark, but you helped Fudge hide Voldemort’s return. How many deaths are on
“Of course, Mr Malfoy.” She pulled the first from its envelope. “We’re getting into June and July, now. Great Ormond Street Hospital would like to know if you’re interested in a table at the second annual F1 Party.” She moved the envelope to the back of the pile. “The Royal Opera House would like you for a dinner preceding the premiere of Das Rheingold. These next two are internal and primarily social. Mr Varley would like to know if you’re interested in joining his group for the Lord’s Test match, and,” she glanced sideways at Potter, “Lady Rose Gilman would like to extend an invitation to join her family in the Royal Enclosure at Ascot. The last is a high tea for the RSPCA.” She glanced up.
“Until?”
“Look around you, Potter. Nothing burning or iced over or shredding or cracked or exploding or splintering or dropping leaves. Not since you started yelling.”
“Uh, isn’t he underwriting the committee?”
“Yes.” Draco waited.
Harry stepped closer.
“That’s not advisable.”
“We? So, you’re going to, too?”
“I’m sorry I reacted poorly to your news. I wanted to apologise.”
“Is a perfectly respectable spell. Have you ever done it before?”
“One of those old ladies’ luncheons?”
Leaving the room was almost as shocking as entering it had been. Even though it had been dimmed, the light was blinding and loud by comparison and he wanted to shrink away from it.
“So no, I’m afraid that won’t do.”
Potter smiles down at him, breathless and ecstatic, looking like he’s never felt something so wonderful, which, Draco supposes, he never has. It leaves Draco dumbfounded, the warmth of that smile. For all he’s sucked a few cocks in his time, he’s never seen a smile like that in the aftermath.
“I do understand, Potter, that this may all be very nerve-wracking. Clearly, you’re as agitated as a new trainee at his first stakeout.”
Granger was back on task in an instant. “And you thought it best to hide this information.”
There was no going back, though. No way to say “actually, former-and-possibly-current-mortal-enemy whose status as a possible lover remains deeply unclear, let’s have a bit of a cuddle.”
Potter cleared his throat. His voice was still raspy anyway. “That was…”
“It was a meeting full of politicians. It’s a wonder anyone was clear on that much.”
“Are they the same as Muggle peacocks, or can you breed magical peacocks?”
A challenge.
Draco has done his level best to avoid this question, even in his own thoughts. “You’ll have a fully, if poorly, furnished house full of efficiently retrieved things,” he tries to joke, “and can restart your original project of discarding and replacing them.”
Once I’ve got it, I know exactly what I need to do.
- Practice Wronski Feint
Harry holds up a hand, ready to spring up and follow. Malfoy ignores him completely.
It had, like so many things in his life, seemed like a good idea at the time. An avant garde, creative approach to building Muggle-wizarding ties. A way to bring people together, to change hearts and minds.
Harry pulled back, breathless. “Okay?”
“Nothing.” Potter shook his head quickly. “Nothing. Never mind. What do you want? Let’s go. We can go.”
Malfoy folded the broadsheet crisply into quarters, keeping his eyes trained on it as he spoke. "I'd usually ask to whom or what I'd owe the honour, but then, it's you."
“More than your clothes did?”
Harry nodded again, and began to inhale and exhale slowly.
“No.” Harry sighed. “What if you and I did the ritual together, instead?”
But then, it wouldn’t be happening with anyone else.
“Okay.” Potter began walking towards the door.
“Said I should ask him.”
He looked at her from the corner of his eye. He hadn’t seen her laugh since he’d been back. She wasn’t relaxed, exactly, but something between them did feel more open than it had, enough so that he thought he might ask and escape unscathed. “None of them?”
Potter nodded into his arm.
Draco would. He does.
“Sales,” Draco affirms.
“Malfoy, just give me the forms.”
“Yeah. I haven’t really known what to do.”
Harry stares.
Then, so does Blaise. Perhaps he’ll suffice in the meantime.
Fine. Separate piles.
Millie raised an eyebrow. “And the protection from prying Ministry eyes?”
I can’t go back there now. Can’t face him.
She stilled, and when she looked up her eyes were red, though dry. “I think I owe him an apology.”
“Of course.” He can hear the smirk in Draco’s voice and hopes it isn’t concealing disappointment. “The virgin.”
No peacocks in sight, he noticed, and figured they must have made for the relative warmth of the stables. And the fountain had been drained already. Definitely a frost, then.
And waited.
Draco nods.
“Happy to, and I wouldn’t be anywhere else,” Draco answered honestly. He pressed a kiss to Harry’s cheek. “Is that your way of saying we’ve got to go back in?”
“No. Edgar fledged today, and as it gets later in the evening he’ll decide whether to stay and winter here, perhaps nest and find a mate, or whether he’ll move on.”
“Okay. But I’m sure you have other things you could be doing, and I doubt it was very interesting to sit here.”
He looks almost surprised to realise he hasn’t been. He looks down to his own dripping erection, and lifts a hand from the sheets to stroke himself.
Draco laughed bitterly. “Yes, he’s made that quite clear.”
He sees a flash of red disappear down an aisle, and Harry is gone from view.
He felt Sydney pull back and shifted to block it from view.
“It would never have occurred to me to ask you to.”
“You could report weekly and meet fortnightly,” Robards suggested.
“I’m sure you’ll find a way. Besides which,” Draco leans forward, mock-seriously, “it’s hardly an exception if I’m returning an item that is, technically, my own.”
“You’re not even on a secure Floo. How interesting can it be?”
Padma grinned and disappeared around the corner to her office, and with shaky fingers, Harry unrolled the letter. He recognised the handwriting instantly, though the Titchwell stationary had been replaced with something more formal.
“Books?”
He lets go, and the Snitch struggles a moment before flapping off down an aisle.
“Too bad. Perhaps another time then. Galder!”
Draco’s head spins. He had expected to win, but not so quickly. Not like this, surrounded by the smell of Potter’s soap and with his cock already hardening under his robes. Not with Potter grabbing at him and rolling their hips together. Not with Potter
“Same time tomorrow?”
Pansy appeared as if out of nowhere and linked her arm with Finch-Fletchley’s, on the wine-holding side. Draco mouthed a, “Thank you,” at her.
Draco turned towards Potter’s back. “I’m not saying it’s not work I shouldn’t have to do, or that I shouldn’t have done more. I could have done something different.”
Harry felt agitation creeping along his skin. He wanted to burst out of it altogether. He wasn’t sure if that was because Malfoy was wrong or because Malfoy was right, but he knew which he would prefer. “Or you’re doing exactly what you were raised to do. A wolf in sheep’s clothing is still a fucking wolf, Malfoy.”
“More,” he mouths. “More.”
“And different countries interpret the letter of it differently. As I understand it, the French Ministry and the French Muggle government have a better relationship than their British equivalents. The Muggles have said for years that they don’t really care if you’re a wizard so long as you’re properly French, or making some attempt to be. Which comes with its own problems, but also isn’t how it’s been in England, even nominally. Awful as the… well, I don’t know that it’s really accurate to call him a man, is it?” Draco mused. “Awful as Voldemort was, he succeeded at making us all afraid of one another, and of Muggles. Even people who rejected his ideas about Muggle-wizard relations were scared enough of him—” Draco sighed “—and, of course, his followers, that getting to know Muggles beyond those Muggle-borns who came to Hogwarts—who were unavoidable, basically—was not the done thing. Whereas without that, here, there’s been a lot more intermarriage, and wizard-Muggle marriages and relationships that last. As opposed to a Muggle having a magical child with a wizard and panicking, and running, and being Obliviated or forced to take an Unbreakable Vow not to tell anyone. And at some point French wizards realised it was harder for anyone to speak out against them when they knew they had wizard neighbours or daughters- and sons-in-law or grandchildren or friends. Not exactly the British approach.”
“The Manor, you mean?”
Harry watched him tip his head back and down the remaining liquor. He slammed it down on the bar and swallowed. “Ready, Potter?”
Longbottom reports success in his past weekend’s endeavours, claims that Potter was interested and easily convinced. “Easily” – hard to tell if this is an inaccurate judgment reflecting Longbottom’s usual ineptitude, but it’s intriguing regardless.
Pansy frowned. Millie sighed.
Draco sighed. “I got a letter from Kingsley yesterday, emphasising the urgency of the situation.”
Granger’s words didn’t betray panic, but her voice was choked with it. “You don’t know the resources we have to offer!”
“Talk to the snake, Potter.”
Draco’s stomach turned, and he stretched to peer into the leaping flames. He couldn’t see anything clearly, but whoever it was didn’t show any signs of going away.
“So that’s what I’ve been doing ever since. That’s—” He stopped. Took a deep breath. “That’s what I meant about a going away present. I’m leaving the Ministry.”
Draco was taken aback. Though, once again, in the reassuringly familiar sort of way he’d felt when Potter had resorted to ignoring him at the party, and he wasn’t sure what to do with that, other than move on. “Because of the contents. It contains medical advice that I’d ask you, at a minimum, to examine critically.”
Millie pulled out a stool and gestured for him to go on.
“Oh?”
Draco stood back, suppressing a smile that might have been unbecomingly, counterproductively victorious. “I’ll see you then.” He turned his back to Potter without waiting for him to re-enter the void, and took the path through the gardens on his way to the library.
“Oooooooooh!” Myrtle clapped her ghostly hands soundlessly. “Just wait till I tell that ghastly old bat. He said it would never happen, and I said, and the Fat Lady said, and Sir Cadogan said, that he was just being a mean old grouch. Not true love, he said! Hmph.”
It was Draco’s turn to grit his teeth. “Even wizarding abstracts have that feature, just as they would with a landscape. These, in case you’ve forgotten, are Muggle. Which makes that rather impossible.”
Draco sighed and looked away. “Yes and no. Dittany lessened the appearance of the scars and prevented infection but, as is almost always the case with curse damage, it wasn’t possible to completely prevent scarring.”
“You’ll what?” Harry quirked an eyebrow.
. Who doesn’t love a bit of gore with their entree?”
“I am very good at what I do.”
Potter fished a scrap of parchment out of his pocket and handed it to Draco.
“What, secondhand escargot?”
He does not, however, mention his mystery man, much to the public’s consternation. The buzz infiltrates even the Prophet’s own newsroom. Draco can’t leave his office without overhearing such a ceaseless stream of questions–“Who’s the lucky bloke?” “What I wouldn’t give to trade places…” “Do you think he’ll come forward?”—that he’s half-tempted to release Potter’s name just to be free of the speculation.
“You have others.” Potter gestured to the two chairs on the opposite side of Draco’s desk. Uncomfortable by design, for visitors. Which Draco was not.
Everyone but Draco nodded.
“Yes,” Potter agreed. “The doors are locked from both sides?”
Where Granger’s expertise was with wands, his was with magic and the body. His dissertation had been an exploration of magically sensitive implants as a tool for biomagical stabilisation in ill wizards. Or, as he’d come close to describing it in more than one odious grant application, sticking wand wood in sick wizards. But that, as the rather remarkable trajectory of his career would attest, worked. Inserting fortified slivers matching a wizard’s wand—a centimetre of willow or oak wrapped in part of a Veela hair or the single barb of a phoenix feather—along the proximal phalanx of the wand hand reduced the incidence of accidental magic by 98% in wizards with serious chronic illnesses affecting their magical abilities. It was so successful he’d been courted by, and turned down, dozens of corporations hoping it would be the key to popularising wandless magic.
Harry followed Malfoy down the boardwalk toward the reed bed, pausing at the edge as Malfoy waded in.
accommodate a driver? They don’t smell of Abraxan shit, either. Best innovation in British travel since the ban on flying carpets. Family brooms are so sluggish.”
“When I tell you.”
Harry took a deep breath and stood. “I’m going to have to talk to it.”
“That’s not possible.” Draco knew immediately that he’d said it too quickly. His father’s voice rang through his head.
I thought I had seen it all, had it all, when we made love the last time. The first time. Being with him was so different from anything I’d experienced before. He was so open, so vulnerable, so thoroughly naked. I’d imagined that’s what it would be.
Harry shrugs. “Nowhere.”
Heat crept up Harry's neck and he hoped, probably fruitlessly, that it wouldn't show on his face. "I asked what you stood to lose and you wouldn't answer. Just said 'I suppose that's for me to know.'"
“I wouldn’t? Replay filthy memories for the Wizengamot to avoid a libel suit?” He laughs. “Their reactions alone would make that worthwhile.”
When I went in there, before I even started speaking, she said Harry had told her to expect me. Had left a Portkey and an address. Had told her I was helping him with a postwar rebuilding project and asked her to give me the necessary clearance. And she did.
Though not as interesting as Malfoy's mouth as it traced a line down his neck. He felt Malfoy nudge the collar of his jacket aside as he moved towards Harry's collarbone, and Harry barely had time to anticipate the wave of pleasure that followed.
Malfoy rests his hands on the counter and greets Harry just as he had before. “This is the Vanishing Department. How may we help you?
“Waiting for you to bend over properly.”
“Draco.” Harry sighs.
I asked if he was alright. He didn’t answer.
He leans back, folds his arms, and smiles. “It’s not really my area of expertise, darling. Ask Heathcote Barbary next week. Looks as though there are quite a few apologies in his future.”
He insisted he meant Quidditch. Just Quidditch, a Seeker’s game. I was gracious enough to agree.
He forced himself to take half a dozen calming breaths before he opened the door. It didn’t do much. Especially when he was immediately confronted with the ginger glare that seemed to emanate from the back of Percy Weasley’s head.
Pansy brightens immediately and snatches the paper from Draco’s hand. Blaise stands to lean over her chair. They bow their heads together, scrutinising, whispering, while Draco tried to focus on another letter.
“However long, then.” Harry raises his eyes towards the canopy as if begging it for forbearance, but Draco can see him suppressing a smile, too. “It’s still…like, you should be happy more than that.”
That didn’t explain why the silence felt so heavy. But maybe, Draco thought as he walked towards the front door, he was the only one feeling it.
“To the ball?”
,” Harry hissed, “
“Very well.” Draco pointed across the room. “Do you know how to use a Muggle treadmill?”
“What?” She knit her brow. “More time? We don’t dispense neo-Time Turners to the public, I’m—”
Apparently, Higsbee takes his silence for focus and starts in on a ramble. “You see, sir, policy is unclear.”
Hey Draco.
“That’s about the long and short of it.” Harry sighed. “It begins to wear. I can feel it starting to build. Even if the individual stories don’t matter, so many of them at once, and having to be the person who listens and pretends to believe and love it all… It’s a lot.”
“Doubtful. It’s not the attraction itself that’s an issue. It happens from time to time, and we’re trained to handle it professionally. It’s that it may be detrimental to his progress, given the particulars of the case. Besides which—” he smiled gently, belying the hint of melancholy he felt “—I’ve got a life to get back to in Paris. Perhaps the time has come.”
He smiled and squeezed her hand, but his eyes had started to stray to Harry, who moved through the makeshift receiving line that had gathered at the foot of stage.
“Actually,” Blaise interrupted, then stopped abruptly.
“Er, yeah.” Potter scratched the back of his neck. “Should I start running?”
Draco’s chest swells. “You’ve never…?”
“Have you felt the void yet?”
She didn’t even look. Just kept riding him. Fine by me. I enjoy the front view with some regularity, but so rarely get a look at the rear end in action. Round, nicely toned, but still plump enough for a bit of movement while she rode him.
.” This time seven red points emerged from the tip of his wand, growing and expanding parallel to each other, their spiky petals knitting them together just as easily as they separated the individual stems. When they were done growing they dropped from Harry’s wand, this time held together by their own structure, rather than a ribbon.
“Is Pip wrong?”
“I suppose you could put it that way.”
could’ve been so brave” – a couple of whispered intimations, and those two perfect questions – “haven’t you ever wondered?” “how do you know if you’ve never tried it?” – and they were strolling towards the Slytherin corridor.
“Tell you after?” Draco offered. “Somewhere quieter?” He took a drink.
“Okay. You mean—do you mean…?”
He’s met with a certain, not-insubstantial, amount of disdain. “We find it best not to worry the Aurors with those details. A few charms, a bit of spellwork. That’s really all you need to know.”
“‘To keep them safe.’”
Draco pulls up enough to press his lips to the soft juncture where Harry’s hip meets his leg, and smiles into the skin when Harry lifts his body to press back.
“I wouldn’t want it all to fall on you.”
It started ringing a third time, and then the sound cut off, replaced with a click, and then, "Hello?"
His throat is parched. “A date,” he repeats.
“Yeah, do it.”
He fell back onto the bed a moment later. Draco knew it couldn’t have been more than a few seconds, but it felt so much longer. Felt long enough to be sure that he’d remember it forever, Harry’s mouth slack with pleasure as he spilled over Draco’s fingers. That he’d remember this, Harry’s skin against the duvet, the line of his eyelashes against his cheeks, the soft rise and fall of his chest, and the way his hands searched for Draco automatically. The way Harry curled into him, his head against Draco’s shoulder.
“Whatever I want. Happiness, all that. Or was that not the offer?”
“Excellent, excellent. This photo, then, Potter and Jordan – is there precedent there?”
“Tell me.”
“That it?”
“I just need a minute to think, okay?!”
“But it’s not—” Potter sighs. “I’ve put everything on the list that I can remember, but I can’t remember everything. If I just leave you a list I’ll never get stuff back, and it might be important, and I’ll never even know it was missing.”
“As much as it rubs me the wrong way to use ‘Tales of Beedle the Bard’ as a scientific source, the Elder Wand was, to the best of our knowledge, created by Death, and as a trick. It wasn’t meant to be a productive force.” Draco sighed. “And you know. You’ve used it too. It has a… pull. An interest in some spells more than others.”
Or maybe to suck him off until he’s incoherent with want, or to punch him in the face, or to stand there, bold and powerful and unflinching as he always is, and ask Draco why, and what he wants, and what he’s doing.
“Fine.”
“I didn’t know,” Harry speaks up from behind him, then trails off. “I didn’t know what to do with it.”
Harry nodded, though it took him another moment to move. He perched on the foot of the bed, then slid over it, pushing himself back to the centre of the duvet.
“That much is evident. Listen, will you?”
Harry was almost trembling by the time it dropped from the end of his wand, and he relaxed back, though refused to open his eyes for half a minute more. When he saw the flowers, he barked a wet laugh. “Lilies.”
Harry turned his back on Malfoy again. His blood was boiling, and he couldn’t lose his temper. “You’re so full of shit.”
Draco held his stare this time, and didn’t look away. The tension between them had metamorphosed into something volatile. Which couldn’t be ideal for Harry’s magic, Draco thought. Even if that was, he knew, an excuse.
“Do people really leave over your…abilities?”
Draco has never been so glad for Potter’s general obliviousness. The last thing he wants is to get stuck in the midst of some greasy, fumbling attempt at a mating ritual.
He lifted his head. “Yes?”
“And yet.” It didn’t seem urgent, and the pit of worry in his stomach gave way to annoyance.
Draco swallows and looks away. “As I’ve said, it’s inappropriate to drink in the workplace."
might remind
“It’s a thing Muggles do? They pretend they can do magic, but it’s, like, illusions? So they use a wand that’s got fake flowers in it. I didn’t think anyone used that seriously.”
“Is it?”
“I have Number 12 Grimmauld Place on the official file.”
He ran back through the photos again, then shoved it all into a drawer and turned on the intercom. “Kate?”
“Can I? Come look?”
“We’ll see about that.” Harry raised an eyebrow. “Not that last night was too shabby, but you’ll have to do a fair sight better.”
“Not from around here?”
Harry Potter is so sick of obstacles.
“I didn’t say you did.” Draco rushed to respond, to reassure them both that that was fine.
“You should’ve been in touch sooner.” Draco stood and began to pace. “We have work on this under review. The implants improve magical ability, as you know. A patient compared them to vision correction—the ability to see, so to speak, was there, but lacked clarity and focus.”
Potter, by way of Lobsey, declined Draco’s requests for visits after dinner. Each message was written with the sort of pained politeness Draco hadn’t known him capable of, and had, himself, long since lost patience for. “
“No.”
“Yes.”
Draco folds his arms. His gaze turns expectant. “Well then?”
But I’ll take him on the pitch tomorrow. Put him back in his rightful place. Start getting into the habit of having him underneath me. Especially now that I know, for certain, I can recognise his feints at a thousand metres and in the dark.
“I–” Again, Potter tried, and, as he fell silent, seemed to fail.
“Fuck.” Harry ran a hand through his hair. “Last night.”
He can’t stop staring.
“The hearing is, yes. I won’t leave directly after. Not the day of.”
“Months,” he snorted, and shook his head to forestall her objection. “I know, I know. Not possible. As long as you can. A week, two weeks. Merlin, I would take a few extra days, if that’s all you can get me. But time, Granger. I need more time.
Draco looked over his shoulder and gave Harry a withering glare.
“If you think so, you’re not listening, Pansy. Things with Potter wouldn’t work. Couldn’t work. That’s as true now as it was then, and it’s pure madness to think otherwise. Focusing on the paper instead of obliging Finch-Fletchley is hardly evidence to the contrary.”
Draco reached out for him. He came up empty.
“Oh,” she mused. “
He hooks a finger into each side of Potter’s waistband, lifting away, and bends his knees until he finds himself at eye level with Potter’s cock.
“No.” Potter shook his head. “That’s not evidence. That’s chance. Sometimes things happen, sometimes they don’t. That’s all. And it’s dangerous. I could hurt anyone, any time.”
“I am increasingly unsurprised at that,” Draco said, honestly, if with a bit of after-the-fact concern about how Potter would take it. The only thing that seemed to inspire any hint of anger was his reflexive defensiveness of Granger and his team, even though they’d landed him here. “Though—and I’m as surprised as you might be to hear myself say this—in their defense, I’m not certain that they knew.”
“Have you asked her?”
“Potter! Merlin’s sake. Do you want me to look at that?”
“Yes, I’m determined to leave. I’ve been here longer than I meant to be already. I have a career and a home. A research agenda to pursue. Colleagues. Friends. Students to direct. Mother; I do miss her.” He ran a hand through his hair. “And even if I did stay, what of it? I can’t be the person here that I am in Paris. I miss walking through the city. Going out to eat. He and I could never do that together.”
Sydney brought a hand to his bollocks.
It rang again. Maybe Harry had silenced it. Maybe he was in the shower or out on a stakeout or something and wouldn't hear it at all.
“Can I have Lobsey bring you anything?”
Millie came round the piles that stretched well down the table. “Hi.”
“Without discussing that portion of the theory, the closest accurate approximation I could give was something about conductivity. Retraining you to channel your magic to the Elder Wand through your femur. Which was not bad for coming up with something on the spot, and is probably possible, actually, but led them to the conclusion that you would be able to do wandless magic with the Elder Wand. With that sort of power. Croaker and Robards were a bit… excited about that.”
Blaise chimed in. “Best to take your own advice.”
Then Malfoy was sliding his hands to Harry’s waistband, unzipping his flies and yanking his jeans down round his thighs. “Bend over, Potter. I want to see your arse before I fuck it.”
Condition number seven had given Draco carte blanche to make his travel plans exclusively through the Minister’s office and without impediments or questions, in no small part because he didn’t want to face the noisy witches in the British Portkey office who, in the best case scenario, the one that didn’t involve name-calling and hexing, would, in the name of helpfulness but motivated entirely by jockeying for the best office gossip, ask why he didn’t want to arrive directly in his home, or travel to one of their offices and Floo through to the Manor.
Everything went smoothly with the Ministry officials. My Obliviation skills were as good as they’ve ever been, and my Muggle charge was spritely and full of praise for my patience and helpfulness when they arrived.
Ten minutes in, he reached for his wand and Summoned his whisky. His mind began to wander. He reviewed their conversation. Harry’s admission. His flush in the firelight. The roses. Harry’s reaction to Draco leaving, and the way Harry had left afterwards.
“Yeah,” he breathes.
“I will go before the Wizengamot,” Potter read, “and see about restoring a portion of the reparations they took after Voldemort’s defeat.”
Draco took himself in hand and guided the head of his cock to Potter’s hole. Potter was so tight around him, his hole already clenching, trying to take in more. And while Draco prided himself on his control, this was hardly the time.
“No, I don’t,” Harry confirmed. He sighed. “But I will. If you think it’s important.”
Though, he’s never considered it, really, and he feels a little ill at the thought.
“They are
“Of course. Will you join us, Doctor Malfoy?”
He was wrong.
He wasn’t surprised when it was Millie, instead, even if it was the middle of the day. He was much more surprised—and instantly a bit queasy—when she spoke.
He’s tired of Potter’s looks. And really, it’s probably none of the things he’s thought of. Probably just Potter’s own unending entitlement. He probably thinks Draco’s just another Vanished object that can be tagged up and brought down for his perusal.
“Or Pip just wants to think they do.”
His hand came to my face and I felt the featherlight weight of his thumb tracing a wet trail across my cheekbone, down my jaw. “You too.”
“And what, that won’t work with all these blobby monstrosities?”
Harry didn't answer him directly. "If you're all done playing pranks on Ministry officials, I'll get back to the real work, then, shall I?"
Though it was none of his affair, really. His first order of business was reviewing papers for this afternoon's follow-up to yesterday's acquisition meeting. The project had the potential to inch into the low eleven figures. These were the sorts of things he lived for, he reminded himself. The control, the influence. The casual power with which he could throw around the GDP of small countries. Everything he had always been meant to have. Everything he had re-made for himself, damnit. And the bonus would be near-orgasmic. The Bombardier was practically his. With custom leather interiors, and perhaps a bedroom in the back.
It’s only his nerves that keep Harry from jumping for joy. Instead, he reaches for the buttons of Draco’s jacket and slips them through the buttonholes. Underneath, his shirt lies perfectly against his stomach. His belt buckle gleams in the dim light, drawing Harry’s eye, and his hands.
He had expected to win, but not to be unsure of whether the kissing or the winning was better. Not to be unsure about which he’d choose, if forced.
“Women, then.” It’s not an idea I particularly enjoy, but it’s the only feasible answer. “You fuck women.”
It’s been three days since you first properly woke up. You’d stirred some before then and said a few words – some of the best words I’ve ever heard – but it took you longer to shake it all off and really wake up. Draco, it’s been so good to see you again. It’s not everyone who could take the piss from a hospital bed.
“I heard you.” Harry flushes.
“I doubt you will, but you can leave them if you’d rather.”
Harry relaxed. “Okay.”
Potter eyes it but he doesn’t say anything. Draco wonders if he recognises it. There’s no reason he should, really. Draco didn’t notice it when he was just filing things away, and there’s no reason Potter would have Draco’s familiarity with its sisters. And if he doesn’t recognise it, best to move on, best to –
His eyes fly open, really open, and he fists the duvet so hard the fabric strains. His mouth moves. He tries to form words. There are none. Just a gasping, shocked inhale.
“Yeah,” he breathes. “Full.”
The feeling was obviously mutual. He gave Draco as thorough a once-over as proximity would allow and slipped a finger through Draco’s belt loops to pull him closer. Draco eyed the sign for the loos and ran a hand down his companion’s body, ready to pull him towards the hallway.
Potter sighed and traced the edge of the window frame with a finger. “How soon would they need to do the surgery, for me to go to whichever ball it is on the 5th?”
Draco rolls his hips into Harry’s fingertips. “Just like that?”
“Oh? Beg pardon, I must have misunderstood.” Draco bites down on a grin, turning it into his most professional pleasant smile. “If not the safe return of your mistakenly Vanished table linens, what is the point?”
Harry took a last, intent look before he nodded and let Draco lead him further down the Rue Saint-Jacques.
Beneath that, Harry read a summary for a Thursday afternoon writing group for those who were first learning English and looking to practice their descriptive skills. On Friday morning, there was watercolour for seniors. Friday evening, a wine and cheese reception for students, with talks by the artists.
The cupboards were immaculately tidy, and not a single one had anything resembling middle-of-the-night snacks. He turned to the drawers. Silverware, neatly folded cloth napkins, tea towels… not a biscuit in sight. He coughed again, and opened the final drawer.
Draco closed his eyes for a long moment, trying, against everything he felt, to remain totally, implacably cool. He dropped his menu on the table. “It’s fine. Let’s just get this over with.”
Draco frowned. He wasn’t especially convinced by her answer, but he was convinced that he’d exhausted the usefulness of the particular line of questioning. “Fine then. I will check on Potter shortly. Tomorrow, I will take him out of the void—”
Draco’s hand sped up, skating over the head of Harry’s cock and down to the base again until Harry was hissing and writhing, begging him to come, to let them both come.
“So brave,” Draco smirks, “So stoic.” He runs two fingers down the underside of Potter’s arm, wrist to armpit. “If you’re afraid, you only need say so.”
like. I don’t… I want
The whole thing leaves him furious. He hauls a stack of takeaway containers to the chute and sends them tumbling downward. Unsatisfying. Too wet, not loud enough. Surely there are more newspapers. Maybe a fruitcake. Maybe an aubergine carved to look like Potter’s stupid face.
“Yes, though understanding them is a different matter.”
“Turn over.”
that he’d rather keep for himself. Half a series of books about a school in a chalet. A dog-eared copy of a pulp novel with a scantily clad woman arrayed in front of a giant, green, toothy lizard-looking thing; he levitates that too, just to be safe.
Must be something right though; Malfoy’s hand wraps around his head, presses him closer.
“Did Pansy tell you I’d left?”
“Good,” Harry replies. “Watch.”
“The Room of Hidden Things,” Potter interrupts again. “It stored everything?"
It brought me here. These steps. They’re familiar, and I suspect I’m sitting in front of the old Black house, long concealed.
“Is it?” Malfoy quirked an eyebrow, and there was a hint in it of the Malfoy Harry knew. Thought he knew.
The whole thing made Harry uneasy.
“No.” Malfoy tilted his head to the right, just like he always had; the mirror Malfoys seemed to lag a fraction of a thousandth of a second behind. “Just didn’t expect to find you here.”
apart from the war. Trying that now… I’m not sure I can imagine what that would look like. What that life would be.”
Draco felt Harry relax as Draco steered him past the tables and around the dance floor. With a quick look behind them, Draco unlocked one of the French doors at the back of the room and slipped out, with Harry close on his heels.
“I have a wand and excellent reflexes. And frankly, I can’t make a truly useful assessment without seeing how you are outside of the void.”
“Please. Even setting aside the relentlessly homoerotic mutual stalking of our school days, it’s obvious.” She scoffed at Granger’s pointed blankness and continued. “I tried to engage him in a discussion of gay erotica and he froze my bedroom. No one truly secure in their sexuality reacts like that.”
His breath caught, and then he took a step up and his hands were on my chest, on my shoulders, his thumbs resting on my collarbone. His whisper, against my cheek, was the prelude to another kiss. “I love you,” he said. “Draco, I love you.” Again, and again. My name, and those words. And then the door was open and we were inside.
“You might as well ask, Potter. You’re the one walking around with the Elder Wand in his leg.”
“You’ll get us both sick. Put on something dry, you’ve plenty of options."
“I’m right and you can’t stand to admit that you want the Wand out anyway.”
Draco stood aside. “Drink?”
“‘My precious Muggle art’? Did you really—Are we really—Who would’ve thought, who would’ve
The lights went out.
Harry wants to sigh, or hide his face in his hands, or reach over and grab Malfoy’s shoulders and pull him close and, well, shake him, probably. “I’m not saying it is.”
Draco goggled at the pure gall. Only Potter.
“Did it work?”
“Yes. We just don’t harvest them.”
“Can you sleep like this?”
“We couldn’t be seen together,” Potter rambles on, “the damage to your family would be too great, the public accusations, it would be best for me not to get in touch, all the best for my future endeavours.”
Draco knew the gallery like the back of his hand. He was especially glad of that now, when it let him move on autopilot.
“That’s hardly the same th—”
When Draco rocks back onto his heels his eyes are level with Harry’s. Suddenly, Draco is looking at him, straight at him.
All it got him was a withering stare.
“Don’t avoid the question.”
If it is, that someone has good taste. It’s an emerald green, which, aside from Draco’s appreciation of the colour, makes Potter’s eyes look rather brilliant even when he isn’t crying. That someone would also be a similar size to Potter, because it fits him quite well. A hint of collarbone, fitted through the chest. Wool – not cashmere, Draco’s certain – but not of unreasonable quality.
“Mill?” Draco mouthed. Then, at a proper volume, “They’ve gone back to the Ministry. They don’t need to be present for a second round of vitals. And you can stop now.”
“I realise it’s been some time since you’ve had cause to use these particular skills, and that they may bring up some unfortunate memories.” Harry opened his mouth to object, but the Headmistress held up a hand for silence. “We’ve all had that experience a time or two during the process of rebuilding. Perhaps you can find some solace in using Voldemort’s skill to undo his damage. And, while it may not be any more fair now than it was then, you are, I’m afraid, the only person who can complete this task.”
He found Potter there already, surrounded by the litter and swinging a palm frond for them to chase.
He nods, gasping for breath.
“Sure.”
“I do.”
“Hmm. Perhaps not. But it seems as though you want to know more than whether he’s okay.”
“In a field, Potter. Does it matter?”
He presses himself into Harry and doesn’t hold back the guttural sound that starts in his chest. He braces his elbows on either side of Harry’s head and breathes him.
Draco waited expectantly.
“It’s an observation, not an answer.”
He blinked again.
“Yes,” Harry answered, a bit miserably. “It was the way to try everything. Make sure there was something you liked.”
“You aren’t!” Draco exploded out of his seat. “Do you hear yourself? You aren’t. You haven’t done anything wrong. The Unspeakables got overconfident about a highly experimental procedure that they never should’ve done in the first place.”
“Oh?” Millie tried again, her voice carefully even.
He nodded when Draco loosened his grip in order to move faster. “Yeah,” he whispered, forcing his eyes open, seeking out Draco’s. “That’s–yeah.” He panted. “Want to come.”
Draco looked up at him again. “And the next one? What do you plan to do with it?”
“Yeah, as if wizards want to steal, what, a couple of splotches and a picture of grass?”
“Why would you think that?” Of all the things he’d imagined, that wouldn’t have made the top ten.
Potter furrows his brow. “What is?”
“Are you enjoying the view, Potter? The lights of London, cast against the night sky.”
“No.” Harry breathes a sigh of relief. Draco’s not shutting him out entirely. “Just, I was thinking about doing it.”
He wasn’t going to miss the chance. “You’re ready for another.” It wasn’t a question. But then, Potter had had no problem making his objections perfectly clear. With a twist of his wrist and a whispered incantation, Draco covered his fingers with more lube and returned to his task.
“Yes,” Draco said. “It is. It always is.”
“No, no.” Draco folds down the top half of the paper.
Before Draco could ask her for a more formal declaration, Potter spoke up. “I, uh, really think it would be best—”
“Good day, Higsbee.”
“I quite like strawberries and clotted cream.”
“Don’t be dense. It’s unbecoming.”
Shacklebolt sighed. “Gawain, John—do you have any more questions for Dr Malfoy?”
Draco exhaled and slumped forward.
No, this will not easy.
They were falling together and Malfoy’s hand was just out of reach, and Harry stretched and stretched until he could feel the heat of Malfoy’s fingertips and as soon as they touched, they were in sand, and instead of falling Harry felt like he was sinking, everything wet and heavy and the wind coming off some invisible ocean like a slap in the face.
Harry splashed into the reeds before he could think better of it. The water was freezing and filled his trainers instantly, but it didn’t matter. He had to know what Malfoy was up to.
He’s decorated it, too, with Ron and Hermione and Dean and Neville and Seamus and Luna (whose efforts had required just a bit of undecorating after the fact). And when they’d asked why he was so eager to get it set up, he’d told them. It hadn’t been an easy conversation, but it hadn’t been as bad as he’d imagined in the end. They all seemed, without telling him, to have arrived at the same conclusion – that Draco had been caught up in something just as they had and that after everything they’d realised they would have done to protect their families it became a bit harder to judge. “Not that we want him around for Sunday Roast,” Ron half-joked. “Yet,” Hermione interceded. “But it’s been a long time since you’ve been this motivated about getting something done. It’s good to see.”
“Of course, Minister.” Draco set his spoon on the saucer. “I am pleased to report something of a breakthrough. It appears that the Wand is not malfunctioning, per se, or in need of removal.” Croaker turned his narrowed eyes on Draco, who ignored them completely.
“She only mentioned it that once, but why –?”
Harry nodded.
The feeling of standing on air is no less exciting, even if it’s not quite as novel as it was the first time. He recalls Phillips’ directions. Doesn’t try to walk, or swim, or anything like that. Instead, he does his best to lock eyes with a tree trunk, and wills himself towards it.
“I’m not sure why I’m getting the third degree when you’re the one reading Muggle novels.”
“No, that’s correct. And my work?”
Malfoy’s clock told him it was just past four. The desk was still clean. There was nothing to see, and Harry knew he shouldn’t look even if there was. He could pace, he supposed. The idea of wearing a hole in the rug left him feeling caged.
Draco spent the better part of the next 20 minutes pacing in Potter’s sitting room, waiting for the hour to end. He walked into the exam room exactly 60 minutes, and not a second more, after he’d left Potter.
“Scared to say it?” He nips at Potter’s neck again and presses his hips forward when he hears the answering moan.
Knowing he had to ask didn’t make the time move any faster.
Malfoy snorts, an amused half-laugh that leaves Harry feeling thoroughly wrong-footed. “You really don’t know how to do this, do you?”
“Great.”
“And you know there are problems with it.”
Potter cuts an imposing figure. He isn’t taller than he was at 20, nor has he filled out much in the intervening decade, but that much Draco knows from the papers. From the relentless parade of photos he prints—has to print, really, to compete with
The elf used the sleeve of Draco’s cloak to dab at her eyes, then squeaked again and began to step on her toes, taking turns with each foot. “Mistress is a good Mistress! Master cannot take Prippa away!!”
“Auror Potter.” It was Penelope’s voice again; he knew that, too. “We are here to examine the charges brought against Draco Lucius Malfoy. He is accused of killing ten members of the magical community, and of conspiracy to commit additional murders. Given the serious—indeed heinous—nature of these crimes, we are bound by duty and morality to find and punish the perpetrator. Towards that end, it is vitally important that you share any information that may be relevant to the proceedings. Do you understand?”
Draco leans in, bracing himself against Potter’s chest, moving to lick his way up Potter’s jaw. “Now?” He has a finger to either side of Potter’s cock, so close, so close to being the first.
The heat of Harry’s breath on his neck sent shivers down Draco’s spine.
Minutes passed before Malfoy let out a soft call and Edgar circled lower, and then lower still, finally coming to a stop on Malfoy’s outstretched forearm. Malfoy held him so close Harry almost couldn’t hear the reassurances and praise that Malfoy had for the bird, almost couldn’t see the look of approval in his eyes.
Harry strokes him until Draco winces and pulls his hand away. He’s sweating, flushed. Gorgeous.
Then Harry felt a tightness in his bollocks and began to ride him furiously, muttering curses and demands in Parseltongue until he felt Draco shudder and jerk beneath him. Harry sank down, taking his whole cock and clenching around it, and Draco was arching back, his mouth falling open as he stilled and came, his whole body tensing as he shot into Harry’s arse.
“Of course,” Draco said. “If you want, but that was so minor...”
“Merlin’s sake,” Potter murmured, half under his breath. “Yes, Malfoy, the view is fine.”
“Run away, you mean? Because it worked so well for you?”
He pulled his phone out of his pocket and stared at the screen, as he had done several times a day since his last meeting with Malfoy. He’d already thought through what he’d do if he called. It would be best to say as little as possible. He just needed to get Malfoy interested enough to take a meeting. A vague sort of thing ought to do the trick. More effectively than details, even, especially for convincing Malfoy to make it after-hours when, Harry reasoned, they'd be on even footing without Malfoy's cadre of colleagues and assistants to interrupt at critical moments.
“Explain it to me, then.”
But Potter already thinks he’s a coward and, while it may be true, he doesn’t want Potter to know it for a fact.
“Oh, Merlin’s bloody balls, Mill. I—No, it absolutely isn’t. I’m sorry if you thought otherwise.”
If the look on Malfoy’s face was anything to go by, he wasn’t the only one.
*  		*  		*
Draco’s Wednesday starts with a bang. Quite literally, as his office door slams open at five past nine, reverberating against the wall on impact.
“Thank you,” Draco said. “And for what it’s worth, the strangeness fades.”
Greg rose. “Suppose I should leave you to it. Gotta go work out anyway.” He waved to them both and left.
“Harry, look – ”
“Excuse me.” He looked at Malfoy once more, then stood and followed Susan from the room. He barely resisted the urge to look over his shoulder.
“Component parts?”
“Not very.”
Potter hesitates. “Ahead of you.”
Though with Potter standing there with his arms crossed, looking like a gathering storm, he was fairly certain he needed to try something. “Did you enjoy the show?”
“No,” Draco said. “You’re fine as you are.” He held out his arm, pulling Harry closer before they Side-Alonged.
Harry huffed a laugh. “No, but what’s that got to do with the headline?”
But, curiouser and curiouser, he just told me. No obfuscation. No whinging. It was just the anniversary of his parent’s death, Halloween.
“As I’ve said, it shouldn’t be. It won’t work, but its materials aren’t fundamentally changed.”
“I don’t mean any disrespect,” Potter offered, the earnestness of his tone completely at odds with the blankness written across his face.
“Do you do that with your bosses, too? They’re right pieces of work.”
“Though why you’d expect otherwise when the Ministry still operates with carrier pigeons’ slower, surlier cousins, I don’t know.”
Potter nodded furiously.
Draco casts him a sceptical look.
“I trust you’re satisfied with the pile.”
He’s so pliant when I push into him again. Takes my fingers beautifully, moans when I twist them, and then, I push up and – there it is.
“I’m not sure that’s wise,” Hermione piped up as Dean trailed off. “Or perhaps you or Dean might take him. Or me, if necessary.”
is Harry tight and hot, and something changes between them, changes in the air, when Draco’s entirely buried in Harry’s body. He wants, every animal cell in his body wants, to keep moving, but he doesn’t. He stops and looks at Harry, and Harry looks back at Draco, and pulls him down and kisses him. When he lets Draco go Draco just
“Of course.” Draco straightens. “Efficiency, yes. I’ll return shortly. Is that all that you want?”
“Should be,” he agreed.
Draco doesn’t rise to meet him. Doesn’t wave. He rests his forearms on his knees and just
It was just behind him, to his right. A loaf of bread—or what had been a loaf of bread—was smouldering, turned into a lump of embers. It wasn’t threatening to go up—there was nothing left of it to catch on fire—but it had left a long scorch mark on the marble.
“Where?”
“Want you to,” he said. “Want to make you come.” He moved a hand towards Harry’s cock and thought better of it only when he saw how quickly Harry moved towards it, how close he really was.
at the first sign of anything unexpected. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a game to attend. Best of luck to you all.’
“Prippa,” Draco tried to interrupt, to no avail.
Draco was trembling when he drove back into Harry, and Harry heard the telltale clatter of metal against the floor, closely followed by Draco’s relieved moan. “Gonna come. Want to come in your arse.”
“Oh.” Harry drops his hand. Draco winces when the cloak puddles on the floor, but covers it with his best imitation of patience. Harry lifts his arm immediately. “Sure. Yes. Draco. I would. I mean, I would like to have lunch with you.”
He didn’t relent until he felt Draco relax, felt his shoulders fall back and his hips push forward. Until Draco’s nipples were hard between his fingertips and Draco was breathing raggedly into his mouth. “Of course I do, you fucking arsehole.” He pulled away, looking Draco in the eye. “Fuck me, would you?”
Draco grimaced in sympathetic pain.
“Yes,” Harry said again, this time chancing a longer look in Draco’s direction.
“How, then?”
“Sorry, Muggle thing.”
“Probably,” Draco agrees. “The desk-sorting.” He squeezes Harry’s hand, lets go, and leads the way towards the next desk in the row.
Harry, who reaches between them and wraps his fist around their cocks. Who strokes, once, twice, before Draco’s fingers cover his own.
Draco bit down on a snort. “Ginger.”
“We might.” Draco nodded. “But I doubt my forecast will be any different then. Even with Potter’s aptitude, he’s starting at a disadvantage thanks to his time in the void.”
Yet Potter’s looking at him as though it’s a question that should obviously make sense, and that is, itself, confusing. Why it should matter, why it has any relevance at all…it’s beyond him. “Why?”
Draco knows exactly who this is. And if his heart is pounding, if he can’t feel his toes, it’s just surprise. It’s been years. He never thought he’d see this again.
Something between them shifted as they came closer to the house. Potter sighed, and Draco saw him slip his hands into his pockets, feeling for the apples.
“No,” Draco answered quickly. “No, certainly not. We don’t even know if there’s anything there. It could be that Potter was thinking of something upsetting this morning and was startled by what he saw this evening. More immediately, it confirms a larger pattern about, not just extreme emotion, but extreme repressed emotion. Things that have no way of getting out.”
Lee paused, momentarily uncertain, and furrowed his brow at Draco.
Luna leaned back on her palms and waited.
Draco felt the unexpected beginning of a smile and moved to stand.
“You’ve left the Aurors, yes? Resigned from the Ministry entirely?”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” He exhaled heavily. “It was fine. Adequate.”
“I’ve explained it to you a million times already.”
“Yes,” said Potter.
“Just…?”
Phillips steps back and gives a signal. Proudfoot nods and fires off a Stunner before breaking into a sprint.
“I do.”
“When I said ‘here’ the first two times, it wasn’t because I meant somewhere else.”
“I bet you’re so fucking tight.”
It was pitch black when Harry woke, coughing. Malfoy must have drawn the curtains after he’d fallen asleep, and Harry had to grope for his wand on the bedside table. Panic rose as his fingers found the wooden tabletop, and the legs of an ancient alarm clock, but not the smooth, familiar grip of his wand until… there, wedged between the table and the wall. His exhale of relief turned into another round of coughing; Malfoy kept the place drier than the Sahara—probably something about preserving whatever invaluable Malfoy heirlooms the Ministry had deigned to leave him—and Harry hated it so much he would’ve made a habit of going home if he weren’t so reliably exhausted by the end of their evenings together. And if he weren’t inclined to avoid rocking the boat with Malfoy.
There would be a certain welcome simplicity in letting them do this for him.
“Right.” Draco paused and leaned back in his seat. “Yet you’ve still managed not to answer the question.”
“I believe introductions are in order.” Mill paused for a split second. Draco could see her scrambling to sort out rank, and loved her all the more when she continued. “Doctor Malfoy, I don’t believe you’ve had the pleasure of meeting Head Unspeakable Croaker or Head Auror Robards.”
“You’re dirty.”
“What?” Malfoy had started trying to grab his trousers back, but dropped his hand abruptly.
Harry’s energy snapped back into focus, all of it squarely trained on Malfoy. “You couldn’t be more wrong.”
“Besides which, darling, I really thought you’d figure it out yourself.” She smiled sweetly and reached for the tea.
“Malfoy, for fuck’s sake.”
“I don’t know.”
“Fuck,” he gasps, eyes popping open to watch his cock disappearing into Harry’s mouth. “Don’t stop.”
Harry shifted uncomfortably. “I don’t know that flying’s a good idea. It’s one thing to make mistakes on the ground, but in the air?”
“And she does,” Draco interrupts.
Draco stood. “I appreciate it, as will many others.” He nodded. “Until this afternoon.”
The next few are clearer. Much clearer. Two men, caught in a passionate – well, embrace might be a bit generous.
“Quite.”
“So, what? This is you trying to care about the right things?”
They were sketches. Each was drawn in pencil, and somewhere amidst his shock, Harry noticed that they were beautifully done. Each one captured an aspect of a crime scene. The crime scenes for the case they were supposed to be helping solve.
Draco takes a deep breath. “But there are things I want more.”
He wondered why Malfoy hadn’t taken it. Maybe there was another one, somewhere else.
“Has it ever occurred to you that I might be familiar with some of these items?”
“Seriously. Really. You can pick the place. Wherever you want to go. It doesn’t even have to be a drink. We could get tea somewhere. Or have lunch. Or, do you like ice skating? They’ve just finished putting a rink up in Diagon Alley.”
Draco moves to pick up the next item. Potter’s hand closes over his. “Malfoy. What aren’t you telling me?”
Harry laughed, his face still turned towards the bedside. “I don’t want to mess it up. I never…I didn’t think I’d have this again.”
They walked on. Draco led them down the Rue Royer-Collard, to the locked gates of the Jardins du Luxembourg. He inclined his head. “Want to go through?”
“Before.”
Shacklebolt was first to recover. “The charity events begin in earnest on the fifth of December. Is there any chance of finding a solution before then?”
“I told you,” he said. “Earlier.”
“You’re really serious? Even if there are cameras?”
Harry smiled softly. “Hey.”
Higsbee pauses, clearly uneasy.
Harry bumps him back with his shoulder. “Well done, you.”
“Fuck me.” Harry reached between his legs to grab Draco’s cock, lining it up and stroking it slowly. “Come inside me.”
Draco nodded and did his best to make it look calmly attentive. A challenge, all things considered, but not an insurmountable one.
“If I move, will you feel it?”
Harry looked at his hand, and up to him, and for one moment Draco was gripped with a long-buried fear, that Harry wouldn’t take his hand, would leave him standing there unmet. Then warm skin slid over his fingers and across his palm. He held his breath.
It was dark and cold when Harry popped back into existence, and the air was damp and thick with salt. There was a cover of thin, scraggly trees, and Harry quickly realised he’d been lucky not to end up in one of them, or ankle deep in the marshland that lay just beyond. As it was, both feet were planted firmly on the boardwalk, and there was a building, barely more than a shack, just beyond the trees and outlined by a waxing moon. He held the bird to his chest and reach for his wand to cast a Lumos.
“Potter.” Draco shook his head clear. “There’s been a change of plans.”
It didn’t mean he wasn’t a killer.
“About the ‘whatever it was that was going on’ between us. He wants to try it. Properly try it.”
? The one where your photographers follow me around relentlessly and you print the photos with whatever damn caption you please and never so much as ask for a statement?
Exhaustion hit Draco like a Bludger to the stomach. He could barely manage even a faint faux-smile. “Think about what you’d like to do tomorrow, then. Last day in the magical world.”
He turned his attention to that. Or tried to.
Granger interrupted their impromptu staring contest. “Dr Malfoy, as I’ve explained, Harry’s attendance at these events is of the utmost importance. That’s true, as I suspect you are suggesting, for the charities that benefit from it, but it is also true for Harry himself. He’s deeply committed to supporting each cause, and would be distressed to miss the year’s biggest opportunity to support the magical community.”
“Well then, shall we—”
“Can you tell me what you’re going to use it for, at least?”
, nor do I particularly anticipate enjoying the experience. But, having done this before –” Harry’s eyes widened “— yes, Potter, having done this before I can guarantee that I won’t cause any injury. And if you have another suggestion, I’m happy to entertain it.”
“Excellent. Now, a test of endurance. Pick a leaf and levitate it, and we’ll see how long you’re able to hold it.” Draco pulled out his pocket watch.
– Family dead. Susan doesn’t know, not close enough to Potter
“Oh.” Harry hesitated “I… ” He frowned at his own ineloquence. “Why didn’t you come with me to Amsterdam?”
Ron walked past him and looked over the drawings. They’d been on one of the scenes together, and when he heard a low, furious, “Merlin’s saggy fucking drawers,” behind him, he knew Ron was seeing the same thing he had—the same details, the same resemblance.
Potter looked perplexed, but nodded.
I lift off and slide halfway down, letting him feel my tongue against his shaft.
“I want to do this to you all the time.”
“Yeah. I have sort of Mind Healer homework to do. I’m meant to practise with someone, telling them things I haven’t wanted to. Apparently trying to be more open will help things? Anyway, I was thinking of Hermione?”
The stack of paperwork is right where he left it. It’s only a few minutes past noon. He has plenty of time to get this done. He turns the page.
“I ought to look into it again,” Draco went on. “The elves do an excellent job of maintaining the trees. Perhaps a French buyer, though their rules for agricultural imports are a bit of a hassle.”
“But if we could fix it—that’s what I’m saying. I have a theory, and a theory might lead to a solution. He won’t hear it, even when it might give him all of that back.”
Malfoy sighed.
“Yes,” Draco answered. “It was. Would you like water? A snack?”
Harry looks up, shocked. “Really? No, I mean – good. Good. I’ll see you then.”
“But it’s an International Treaty. The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.”
“It really was more of a brisk walk.”
Between Shacklebolt and Robards, a tiny, wizened witch stood and cleared her throat. “As Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot I, Griselda Marchbanks, CDMG, APMO, fdBB, call this session to order, that the Status, Ancestry, and Family Equality Act be read a third time proceeding expert testimony. Recognising Honourable Warlock Alistair Flint.
“Yes. And as we know, those never have personalities, especially the really legendary ones.”
“If you’re going to be difficult.”
“No.”
“You’re forgetting the nature of the problem. First the fucking, then the Parseltongue. Although…” Harry was momentarily thoughtful, then dropped back on his knees and spread them apart, “I have been practicing.”
“It certainly was an unusual request,” Hermione mused.
Potter took it from his mouth and handed the clean end to Draco. “What—?”
“Not all of us care as much about power as you do.”
At last, Draco relents, dropping the poker back onto its hook with one last bang, and folds his arms. “Yes?”
Greg shook his head and picked at a nail. Draco wondered if he’d been wrong about her pointedness.
“Man of many skills,” Potter corrected.
Draco turns on his side and pulls Harry towards him, curling around Harry’s side, one arm under his neck, the other arm and a leg draped across him. “And now?”
“Yes,” Potter interrupts, his breath uneven. “Want.”
Not to say that I told the whole truth; I doubt Potter would approve of my strategies.
Potter snorted. “Yeah, that was great. Set me up, make me furious, run your damn tests.”
He takes a deep breath, nods, and turns back into his arms.
He has the subtlety of a Hippogriff, but that’s not the kind of opportunity one can let pass. I asked what he meant, exactly.
I moan into his hole once more. There it is again – the slightest pressure as he pushes into me.
Draco found himself speechless, and certainly surprised.
“I trust you have something else to run in the meantime?”
“But if you want it to go quickly –”
Draco took it, dropping both of their wands into his robes and turning back towards the house. “We’ve accomplished a fair bit this morning, if you’d like the rest of the day to yourself.”
Malfoy shook his head slowly. “What’s the point?”
“Oh no,” Luna insisted, “very quiet. I hardly heard him speak, except to the animals, until I spoke to him. He looked a bit pained all the time, though. A bit like he might cry, when he thought no one was looking.
She clenched her jaw and promptly dropped into her seat, arms crossed.
“Can’t hurt to try.”
He laughs. “I’m sure Hermione will have plenty to say.”
“No.”
It only urged Harry on. He slid a hand up Malfoy's side, until he was gripping Malfoy's waist, his fingers digging into the open waistcoat and the lining of the suit jacket sliding over his hand. Holding him like that, Harry could feel it when Malfoy started to tremble, was tight enough against him that he could feel the tension in Malfoy's thigh. With one hand firmly on Malfoy's waist, Harry moved the other to his cock, which was rock hard and dripping.
has done the most gorgeous illustration,
“I don’t think we have very much time, do we? The galas start on the 5th.”
Draco frowned. “That’s it?”
“You’d be surprised, I believe. Have faith in those around you. They love you very much. What else is it?”
“Ten points to bloody Gryffindor. No, Potter. Not on your life.”
“No?” Draco traces down Potter’s side.
“But not impossible. It made sense when you said it. Croaker found it intriguing. It does seem to be in line with your research agenda, and with what I know about wands.”
Ron’s head was moving swiftly towards the bar, and Harry and Draco followed gladly, grabbing two Fawley’s from the bartender and downing them quickly.
“Yes,” Potter whispers.
“I’ll take that as a compliment.” Harry kept smiling, even as he narrowed his eyes in mock-suspicion.
Draco paused. “Two heartbeats.”
Suddenly, halfway through, Potter tensed.
“No,” Draco breathed. “Merlin, no.”
Draco cursed himself silently, set his cup in its saucer, and made a mental note to ask for an agenda in advance next time. “Of course. As you know, we have constructed a magical void in the East Wing. Mr Potter remains within the void most of the time, and, as predicted, and as previously noted by Unspeakables Croaker and Granger,” he nodded at them, “he does not pose a threat to himself or others as long as he remains there, though I do have concerns about the potential for long-term side effects. I am conducting a series of diagnostics, in and outside of the void, but so far nothing is conclusive. I will continue in that vein until I am able to determine the source of his unpredictability, at which point I will be able to develop a more comprehensive treatment plan.”
“We can go riding if you like.”
Then the maitre’d held open the door, and the breath went out of him.
“It is. Very well, actually. Though I’d appreciate it if that didn’t get back to the Ministry.”
Potter might’ve been the sort to see to everyone’s needs, but even he wasn’t impervious to the lull of post-orgasmic sleep. He moved, still sticky, to lie flat on his back, his eyelids clearly struggling to stay open, and Draco barely resisted the urge to study every inch of his skin. Instead, he lay down beside him, watching how easily he moved when Draco pulled the covers over them, and surely that was a better thing to focus on than the way the duvet rose and fell with Potter’s chest as he passed into unconsciousness.
“Are you?”
It would pass.
He hums his pleasure into Potter’s neck, pleased to no end when Potter cants his head, revealing a stretch of pale flesh. He moans when Draco dips down to lick a fine line up Potter’s neck, gasps when it turns into a bite, groans when Draco sucks, long and hard. Draco pulls away, leaving behind another blooming purple spot. This time, Potter can’t run. Nor, to Draco’s pleasure, does he show any inclination to.
“Yes. Of course.”
“Potter,” Draco replies. Sigh. “Follow me.”
“Yeah.” Draco slid his free hand to the nape of Harry’s neck. “Okay?”
“Good morning. Welcome to the Vanishing Department,” he recites, automatically.
It’s three more days until I see him, though. Two and a half, even. He’ll be at Grimmauld Place after tomorrow, and the urge to go to him as soon as possible is both present and strong.
“You kept trying to spin in your sleep.”
“And here I’d thought it was pity. Maybe regret on a generous day. Or the promise of some future returns.”
– Family in wrong circles. Hannah doesn’t know, not close enough to Potter.
“Right.” Draco sighed. “Tea. Is Pansy already waiting?”
– Nose in a book, pretends not to know, not close enough to Potter.
Draco lets go of Harry’s wrist and props himself on his elbows. “Adds to my workload, you know.”
“He was in his office, one. Two, fuck off. Three, no. It’s confidential for good reason, and this connection is even less secure than the other.”
“You could test it, if you want. See how they feel.”
“Here?” Potter looked sceptical.
“Definitely.” He gripped the edge of his desk and met her eye with a smile. “Let me just see to this, and I’ll be right in.”
Something passed over Malfoy’s face. When he cleared his throat, it seemed to echo.
"Yes, well." Draco choked out a light laugh. "You see, I've just got home from the station and it looks as though there's been a bit of a break-in, and, er…"
“Okay, well.” Harry couldn’t find any of the words he wanted. “That’s okay. Should probably go home and sleep a bit anyway.”
Pansy raised an eyebrow and waited.
Oddness of the situation aside, Harry can’t help his burgeoning excitement.
“How could I? Looked like early stages of Scrofungulus.”
“Mhm. Are you imagining the taste?”
“Yeah.” He’s hoarse. He doesn’t think it’s from the fall.
Neither of them offers any quarter. The bastards.
Harry sits back, his skin glowing with the hint of exertion, and Draco takes his time looking at the trail of hair that gets thicker as it approaches his waistband.
Thinking of the few comments Ron and Hermione had made at finding out who he was spending so much time with, he amends, “I’m not saying it would be easy or fast. We don’t even know if you like me – at least, I don’t know if you do – or if you would like me after the drink. We don’t even really know if I’d like you, though I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t pretty sure. But if we did like each other, I’m just saying, eventually, that I think they’d come around.
Harry slides his hands under the waistband and around to Draco’s back. He lowers the fabric until his thumbs brush the top of Draco’s arse, then runs his fingers around the curve of Draco’s hips and lifts the fabric, gently, carefully, over Draco’s cock and down his thighs. He doesn’t hesitate to circle the shaft and give a tentative stroke, and Draco has to catch himself on Harry’s shoulder for balance. Harry’s hands are always warm, and he knows how to touch Draco so perfectly that he’s dripping at just those few light strokes.
“Magical
Blaise had picked the spot, a Muggle gay club in Brighton that was popular with the wizarding crowd and close enough to the beach to allow for discreet Apparition. It was clearly chosen with Draco in mind. He didn’t object.
“There haven’t been any legal challenges, sir, just as you predicted.”
Trained departmental personnel? Harry thinks. Isn’t it just Draco? “Trained departmental personnel? Isn’t it just you?”
He isn’t sure why this has to be quite so hard. Why something that’s so intuitive to Draco has to be so perplexing for him.
“Got strange.” Malfoy’s voice was so low Harry could barely hear him. “Got strange between us.”
Pansy and Blaise stepped aside in front of them, clearing a space at the bar. Draco ordered a glass of champagne. Beside him, Millie ordered three.
“No?” Draco asked, half-laughing, and took half a step forward so their hips were as close together as the rest of them. “They’re great ears.”
“How did that go?”
Draco considered. “Yes, actually. I’ll have Galder see to it. Based on past experience—well, you said you would be able to cast now, but you don’t think the spell would be as effective as it might be. Is that correct?”
Part of him felt as though he should investigate that urge. Make sure it wasn’t the desire to prove Malfoy wrong, to prove that he didn’t just deal in black and white. But Malfoy hadn’t been entirely wrong about that, Harry was a bit chagrined to admit. And it had taken Malfoy to show him why it mattered.
Draco’s heart beat a tattoo against his ribs. “It’s not bad.”
“Must be.”
He was barely breathing by the time they reached the courtroom door. Might've forgotten to if not for Finnigan's soft brogue, whispering, "Buck up, Malfoy. Harry needs you."
– On the continent.
His shrug is so tiny I almost miss it.
“The SAFE Act isn’t as simple as that,” she reminded him, though thankfully with only the barest hint of reproach.
“It’s hard to say exactly, since the Wand had been acting up before the surgery.”
Draco nodded.
Desperate for more, Harry snapped his hips upwards to take Draco’s cock. “More,” he whispered.
“Up?” Harry craned his neck.
“Neville,” Harry’s voice is warm, but with a trace of nervousness. “You remember Draco Malfoy.”
Then she plastered on the sort of obviously fake look of interest they’d all learned as children and turned towards their guests. “Granger, tell us what you do. I’m sure it will be boringly appropriate.”
“Then shall we try again?”
“And lose the time? When there’s barely any time left?”
Draco leaned in. He saw confusion flit across Potter’s face, but damn it all, Potter had started it, Potter was the thunderstorm, Potter was the one seeding the skies with unnamable ideas, Potter was the one kissing—kissing!—him and running off without giving him even a moment to figure out what had happened, and it wasn’t unreasonable that it should take a moment when the only ways they’d touched each other before had been about fists and curses.
“No.” Draco looms over him, circling his wrist with an iron grip. “Tell me. What do you want?”
“Yeah, I know, but then what about – what happens afterwards?”
Potter furrowed his brow.
“What?” He looked up at her, startled.
The saviour of the wizarding world squeaked. The thinnest, highest, reediest sort of embarrassed squeal.
“We–” Potter paused and carded his hair. “Look, Malfoy, I hate to say it, but we’re desperate. This lot aren’t just smuggling potions, they’re selling them on the cheap, and mounds of people are ending up in St Mungo’s, half of them claiming they didn’t even intentionally take the stuff. We think they might be slipping it into people’s gardens or owl orders or drinks or
“This is magic. I just didn’t know it.”
“Just spells,” Draco confirmed. “With your wand, please, for this.”
Potter was flushed and desperate and he wanted Draco. He wanted Draco inside him.
“So they devised a brilliant solution.”
He was a bit nervous at first. It surprised me; I’d stopped thinking of him as the fumbling boy I once imagined. He’s so certain, so willing to admit to what he wants. But I suppose he’d had an interval to think things through, to wonder if I’d changed my mind or if things would be different between us.
“I know that!” Harry yells. “Merlin, you’re stubborn.”
Granger spun around, startled.
“Yes.”
“Robards will tell everyone this has been a ruse once it’s all over. There’s no need to contradict him, or form any sort of attachment. Simple release. Well worth it, if it will keep you from throwing the mission.”
Draco watched Shacklebolt and Granger share an attempt at non-verbal communication, darting away just long enough to catch Millie’s very miniature nod of approval.
“He was, but why?”
I nodded. I know I did. I think I did. He asked again.
With his eyes still trained on Potter, Draco threw it to the sofa. “Shall we see what’s underneath, then?”
He looked to Draco nervously. “Would you do it with me?”
“Just full?”
He followed suit, pulling his chair in quietly. “Do you intend to pout through the rest of the meal, or just the rest of the salad?”
Harry eyed the room nervously.
“What am I supposed to do until Thursday?”
"On the WNN's Breakfast Show?" Harry paused. His voice had dropped an interval, and Draco wished that he could see his face. "The radio?"
“I will.”
The look they share is just as weighty. Harry would never admit it, lest it make Draco stop, but he is, in this moment, just a bit afraid.
£     £     £     £     £
“Pardon?”
“Yes.”
“Pansy, how many men did you sleep with between Blaise the first time and Blaise the second time?”
“Oh,” he shrugged. “Yeah, I guess. It’s fine. “
“In me.”
Draco sighed and gestured towards a settee. When Potter shook his head Draco went on. “I have concerns, as you’re aware. Granger has some as well, as you are also aware. She was arguing with them when I arrived. I mentioned that there was an alternative course of treatment that wouldn’t require removing the Wand. Robards and Croaker started salivating over what a super wizard you would be. Lo and behold, the clouds parted and there were options.”
“Merlin, no, of course not. You’ve been great with everything, I don’t have any complaints.”
“No?”
“Harry, I know,” Draco interrupted. “I’m not saying it’s nothing. That it was nothing then, or is now. I wouldn’t be here if I thought that. I’m saying that we don’t quite know what it is.”
“I can imagine. And is that the only reason?”
I swear I hear the faintest whine as I spread him open.
“No.”
He turned and looked around. Now that he was searching for them, he could see the seams of mirrored panels lining the room. He traced the one nearest him with his fingertips, walking along the wall until he reached the corners of the room. When he focused, he could see the same pattern of mirrors on the opposite wall, and more of them on the floor and ceiling, each reflecting the others reflecting the others reflecting the others until they became an infinity.
Potter took the wand, but wrapped his fingers around it so lightly Draco worried it might fall through them.
Then, Harry thinks, he can’t stop either. He jogs after Draco. “Stop. Stop! Malfoy!”
Ron took it from her, and took his time wrapping the noodles around his chopsticks. “Malfoy though, mate? Really?” He held the container under his mouth as he took a bite, and chewed slowly, and only raised his eyebrows a little bit. It was Ron’s version of giving him a moment, he knew. Maybe more of one than he deserved.
Draco tried again. “If you have reservations about being seen without observers, you only need say so. I’m sure Granger will be more than happy to sit in.”
Draco grinned. “That
Malfoy did turn at that, but only partway, and it was a far cry from what Harry had hoped for. His pretty flush was almost gone, and he had the same implacably cold expression he'd worn when Harry had first shown up. "Bored, actually. Are we done here?"
Millie sighed and leaned forward. “Then perhaps I’d better do this part as it is, technically speaking, more my department than Hermione’s.”
“Me?” Draco’s heart stopped. “To the Ministry?”
“The way it feels, Potter.” Draco takes down the neatly folded runner and holds it out.
I let loose a smile, heart still pounding. “Should it be?”
“I have a list.” Potter stood and held out a battered mobile before Draco had even finished closing the door. Damned shame, not least of all because the door on the left was squeaking, and somewhere there was an office manager who needed to hear about it.
“In this instance, then.” Blaise paused, looking over his shoulder to see that the remaining guests were still arranging themselves. “It really is an accomplishment, you know. This much of wizarding society, mingling with Muggles? Admiringly? Spending money on Muggle art?”
“He certainly can’t have given away that much,” Hermione agreed, albeit with a bit more politesse, “if he’s able to buy a space like this on Diagon Alley with a storefront on Charing Cross Road.”
“If you were paying attention to my theory, you’d know that it’s an ideal time to hand you your wand.”
“As much as I appreciate your concern…” Potter trailed off.
Fortunately for us both, he obliges.
“Working with Healer Barrett… it was good in a lot of ways. And it’s not like it’s the sort of thing that can ever be—I’m not sure ‘cured’ would even be the right word. But managed. And it made all the difference, that you realised that, figured out what to do about it. I—” He sounded choked up, and Draco was a bit grateful that he continued on in a different vein. “Anyway, I kept getting closer to being back to where I had been before, and Gawain and John kept poking around, asking questions about it, wanting to see what I could do. And I realised either I would have to pretend to be sicker than I was, or I’d have to own up to being able to do wandless magic that…well, I kept practising and I’d guess it’s good enough now that they would’ve wanted to make something of it.” He sighed. “As always.
I reach for the bedside table, and the unexpected movement startles him into opening his eyes. I show him the lube and run a hand through his hair, hoping it calms him. Nevertheless, I’m surprised when it works, when he nods and shuts his eyes again, even as I move back down the bed.
He kept his eyes trained on his cock and his partner’s mouth, watched as much as he felt Sydney hollow his cheeks and suck.
“No.”
But he hasn’t put it in the attic. At least not yet. He’d considered Vanishing it instead, now that he knew where Vanished things went.
“Doesn’t count unless we’re both in the game.”
Malfoy’s eyes snapped to his face, and he felt more naked then than he had all evening. But he knew he wanted it.
“Oh.” Harry muttered. “Okay. Right.”
Draco believed it. Potter sizzled with energy. Lightning to Draco’s thunder, even without a sky between them.
“And you, Blaise? How many was it?”
Robards spoke over Weasley before he could get any further. “As we have informed the Minister, and as the Minister told you directly at our last meeting, we believe it would create an untenable safety risk.”
He dropped his fists; no use in Malfoy seeing him ready for battle over a change in the lighting. He’d heard enough ‘scared of the dark, boy?’ jokes in his first eleven years to last him a lifetime and then some.
Ron’s Jack Russell came bounding through his and Padma’s shared wall a few minutes later, and he heard Padma throw something at it. Before he could get up to apologise, the terrier planted itself on his desk and fixed him with a searching look. It looked like it was about to bark, but Ron’s voice came through instead. “D’you mean when you cut him open? Or after the war when you… you know? Lemme know and I’ll think on it. Oh, and let me know about the Cannons tickets, too!”
Draco smiled, but he could feel the sadness on his face as well as he could feel it in his chest. “Was incredible. You’re incredible.”
Potter did call eventually, and came back to the office, this time by appointment. Kate's efforts to make him comfortable had some effect, though they did not quite make him confident. He seemed… differently unnerved, looking over his shoulder as though expecting cameras to be revealed, watching Kate lay out tea and biscuits on a table in front of the sofa as though she might slip a bit of cyanide in if he turned away.
“You’re leaving?”
“He always had to be.”
Potter huffed a laugh. “Fuck off.”
“I understand that,” Draco said, intending something between reassurance and placation. “What I’m saying, though, is that it’s a lot to digest all at once.”
He thought, at first, it might be his office, but his eyelids were leaden under the weight of last night’s whisky, and since the odds of his feeling beholden to scheduling reminders were slim on the best of days… well. He wasn’t especially moved.
“She seemed happy.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry began. “I’m very sorry. I thought— When I left, you’re right that I just thought you would come, and that I didn’t ask. And when I got all the letters I sent you back, I gave up. I didn’t try. In doing that, I think I proved you right. I think I made it easy for you to believe I didn’t care.
“It’s your lucky day, then. Given the uniqueness of the case, I suspect it will have to be a collaborative endeavour.”
“More,” I confirm, pulling my fingers out, repressing a victorious exclamation when he raises his arse off the bed to follow them.
“More,” he gasps again. “Harder.”
He feels it coming, feels his thighs tingle and his bollocks tighten, knows he won’t hang on much longer.
“Bed.” Harry steps in again, so close now that their chests almost meet.
Draco kept a careful distance. “Good morning.”
Draco takes himself in hand, sets the head of his prick against Harry’s hole and presses forward until Harry begins to take him in. It’s so tight. His skin is tingling, his thighs already weak.
Draco couldn’t disagree.
‘Touch’ might’ve been an understatement. It’s a light slap and a firm grab, and I’m rather pleased to see him arch into it.
“They aren’t my fabrics. As we’re trying to establish, they’re largely your fabrics.”
“Do you know why?”
Potter frowns. “Because you’re so eager to be finished.”
“You,” Harry supplies.
Without waiting to be asked, Harry crossed the rug and took a seat opposite Malfoy's chair. He pointedly avoided looking at the desk, or remembering how the smooth wood had felt under his elbows.
Potter is watching him. “All right?”
“Might?” There’s a note of humour in Harry’s voice, and it’s a welcome change.
Potter likes him.
He slips outside and slams the door behind him before he can see Draco’s reaction. He leans against the wall, breathing, just breathing, until he’s steady enough to walk away.
Harry does, and for all this has been a strange day—more than a strange day—he’s relieved to see these hints of Draco,
“Thanks.” Harry takes them, putting them on as much to busy himself as to fend off the cold.
If I had kissed him back I never would’ve said it. If I had kissed him one more time.
She crossed her arms, looking highly offended. “Yes. Greg and I each paid someone to come in, confidentially, as soon as we could afford it. Made all the difference in the world. And if Potter doesn’t agree I’ll be perfectly happy to wait in the kitchens and yell at him some more.”
Draco folded his arms over his chest and smiled thinly. “That might be the smartest question you’ve asked yet.”
“Just do it,” Potter huffed. He held out his hand.
“No.” Potter practically jumped to answer. He took a step forward, extended an arm. His face came into the light and Draco saw his eyes, wide and concerned. “That’s not… No.” He dropped his hand, bit his bottom lip.
“Yeah, that’s mine, Arthur got it for me. Do I need to fill out a form to tell you you’re good at your job?”
Harry jumped. Luna had been gazing so contentedly at a photograph of grass, and Harry had been staring so determinedly at Malfoy, that he’d almost forgotten they were meant to be conversing. But they were; Ron’s sixth tiny plastic glass of red wine and Hermione’s fourth had seemed to serve as a cue to them both that it was time to head for bed, and it was just Luna left. Harry was grateful for the company, if unsure of how to reply.
They stare at each other across the bed.
- Remember to review Pansy’s potions essay (3rd reminder – do it or she’ll be intolerable)
He laughed again, and it sounded watery, but he looked up with clear eyes. “I don’t, you know.
“I’m his physician, not his social director.”
Draco’s nausea returns. He wasn’t ready for this sort of fumbling around, like they're strangers. Awkward strangers, at that. “We’ve both done this lots of times.”
It did make his life more comfortable. It did come with influence. It did involve parties and hobnobbing and the sorts of circles Potter was so quick to write off as chock full of posh arseholes. It did make him money, if not as much as he’d spent. And while he didn’t care about losing the Manor—let the Goblins take the damn thing, he’d be glad to be rid of it—that did rather seem to underscore Potter’s point, if he really thought about it. Aside from his own fear of failure, it wasn’t costing him much at all. It wasn’t the sort of sacrifice redemption stories usually seemed to require.
She returned it and moved to walk towards the foyer.
Draco tilts his head to concede the point. “Fair. Then how did you know it was Pansy?”
“But–”
“Um. Test drive? Just to make sure? Or…” Harry trailed off, then squared his shoulders and kissed Draco again.
Harry was glad someone else had said it. He still didn’t think he could.
“Right.” Potter paused. “Right, then. What is it you’re asking for, exactly?”
They were flying over the charred ruin of the Room of Requirement, Malfoy’s fingers digging into the space between Harry’s ribs so tightly he felt like his chest might be prised open, and cinders still popped under a layer of ash, and a piece of smoldering wood fell from the ceiling and Harry swerved, turning his broom to avoid it, and instead it hit Malfoy’s side, just below his arm, and he was falling off Harry’s broom, falling away into the ash, and Harry reached and reached but every time he thought he might get close enough, another piece of the ceiling broke off and threatened to burn him, and then Malfoy was covered in ash, and then he was gone.
Potter snorted. “Bit hard to see anything else in the blobs and weeds.”
He nods, mumbles something mostly indiscernible into his elbow.
Draco, who remained oddly rattled by Potter’s general agreeableness, hesitated. “Are you not used to being told about your treatment plan?”
“Sounds good.”
been quick to point that out before whatever Malfoy’d had to say in their gallery-related meetings. And while Malfoy and friends made periodic shows of repentance, Harry was never able to bring himself round to seeing them as anything more than that. Particularly when they involved displays of wealth and influence.
Draco looks at him. Draco doesn’t say anything. Harry, against his better judgement, begins to hope because, at last, Draco Malfoy has shut up.
Dead air hung between them.
“Punctual?” Draco attempted a smile. “Either she’s changed or you’re a very politic elf.”
“It’s nice?” Potter offered.
“Alright?”
“Say it.” Draco’s fingertips graze the soft cotton swell. “Do you want me to touch you?”
,” she spits, “this office is mishandling the personal property of British witches and wizards.
Draco rutted against him. “Could be inside of you.”
“Is there a spell for this?” Harry asked without opening his eyes.
He folds the parchment over, covers the words, and starts again on the other side.
Six days after the Battle of Hogwarts, Kingsley declares it “our victory over the dark forces that would divide us.”
“Are you?” The voice is familiar, though Draco can’t quite place it.
Potter sighs again, this one wearier than the last. “Answer the question, would you?”
“Of course.” Draco examines his desk. He so rarely sees it from this angle.
We met at my workshop again. I showed him how to bottle the pigments, how I’d made sure they didn’t leave any magical traces, how they were made without any of the ingredients on the Ministry’s ridiculous list of monitored ingredients. I showed him how to cut stencils, guided his hand as he carved into the material with my second favourite blade.
“Well it wouldn’t be very smart to give it to you beforehand, would it? What incentive would you have to follow through?”
Draco folds his hands on the counter.
Malfoy waved the door open without standing and gestured to the two overstuffed leather wingback chairs that sat in front of his desk. Harry took one and crossed his arms, studying Malfoy’s darker, greener version of the rug in Hermione’s office.
“It isn’t, no.”
So all he can do is watch the door close and stand there in an office that’s never felt emptier.
Their rough breathing filled the room but neither spoke until, beginning to soften, Malfoy withdrew from Harry’s arse and Harry felt a warm trickle of come flow over his bollocks.
* * *
Draco stood, looking him in the eye. “After.”
The snake began to move towards its box, its body blending with the dark wood.
He felt as though something in his chest opened when he fell into step next to Draco. They matched pace easily, and Draco didn’t pull away as Harry pulled closer, until their hands were almost touching.
Potter’s footsteps stalled again and Draco turned to see him staring in open awe at one of the horses.
“Dr Malfoy?”
He was at the round table in the conservatory, at Galder’s direction, by ten to eight, so many notes spread before him that the files dripped off the edges of the tabletop. Condition three had been a requisitioning of Potter’s complete medical records, nothing withheld or classified, and he’d read them twice, end to end, before setting foot on English soil.
“Er.” Robards scratched at the back of his neck. “Each of the pairs had, historically or magically — in some way, that is, been… different from each other. One of them, well. One of them good.”
In the name of professionalism, Draco tried to hide his incredulity. “Magical ones, mostly.”
“Take it to the Chamber? What do you mean, exactly?”
“You don’t say.”
You close your eyes. Rest your hands on the brick. It hums. You can still feel it. The beat. It’s there. You’re there.
The earlier stuff than that, too. I mean, what you did to that Muggle woman…that was really wrong. I knew you didn’t like charity work and I wouldn’t be real surprised if you had done some of it by magic even though you weren’t supposed to. But knocking her out like that…is that still your attitude towards Muggles?
The bird is going back to Harry anyway; he sends the note along with it.
The marquee was Draco’s idea. Thirty feet long, moored to the Manor, magically reinforced, and entirely capable of redirecting any wayward roofing.
“Bit early, isn’t it? Not that there’s anything wrong with that,” he hurries to add.
And then it came, the warmth of lips against his own. A hint of roughness at the corner of Harry’s mouth, fitting for December. The softening of his lips as they moved against Draco’s. The electric pins and needles that travelled down his arms as Harry stepped forward again and pressed their chests together. The feeling of Harry’s waist as Draco hooked an arm around him and pulled him closer still. Maybe Draco shouldn’t have been surprised that Harry was good at this, but inasmuch as he retained any ability to think, he was blown off his bloody feet.
“This isn’t a curse,” Draco insisted, brows knit in concern. “This isn’t going to do that kind of damage.”
Free mornings were such a novelty that Draco wasn’t sure what to do with his. Before his mornings had been devoted to Potter’s care they’d been spent in his lab or office, bent over wood samples or parchment or the occasional computer, though once he discovered the solitaire feature he’d decided any advantages with regard to organising data and editing papers were outweighed by the focused simplicity of a good self-inking quill. Any potentially lazy mornings he could remember had been occupied with sleepy shags or hair of the dog. He didn’t like feeling at such a loose end. His fingers itched for something to do. He missed his work, and while the Manor library was perfectly respectable, it didn’t have his books, or his view of the Panthéon.
The side of Potter’s mouth quirked up. “Cannot.”
Potter’s still just standing there, looking at the stack of parchment and back to Draco.
“They’re pretty bloody damning, Malfoy.”
"Now you're getting it," Malfoy murmured, craning his neck until Harry felt the heat of breath and the warmth of lips against his jaw.
“I…” Harry starts, but trails off as he looks, really looks, at Draco.
Granger blanched. “Malfoy—”
Draco starts talking before a surprisingly punctual Potter has a chance to get a word in edgeways. He, frankly, doesn’t want to hear it. Instead, Draco shuts the door shut with a firm
“Of course, sir!” He’s starting to resemble a tomato.
Draco’s bent forward and gripped Harry’s shoulder. “Don’t stop, yourself.”
Draco’s cock was half hard, head just slipping free of his foreskin, nestled in a bed of curls that descended from Draco’s abdomen, and Harry startled when Draco interrupted his attempt to memorise the image.
The Junior Undersecretary nods and makes a beeline for the staircase. Potter steps out of Draco’s grip and crosses his arms, looking far more confrontational than the situation calls for. “Didn’t know you were in such a rush to leave.”
Harry nodded.
Draco steps over the dropped box to come towards him, and Harry’s heart leaps at the promise of familiarity, until Draco comes to stand several feet away from him from him, hands folded primly on the worktop.
“When I let you fuck me—why?”
“Maybe. I don’t know.”
“Returning your furniture.” He casts again, this time at a massive, weathered bureau, which he sets next to the first.
“Blood pressure and heart rate. For comparison to your previous. Shirt off, please.”
A week later they had bloomed. Then the magnolias were leafing, their flowers’ fuzzy green covers given way to pink and white flowers that left the air smelling sweet and fresh, and every breath Draco took felt like spring. The apple trees followed, and the ladybirds returned with enough of a vengeance that when Draco left his office windows open he’d often find their red spotted shells clustered in a corner of the sill or, occasionally, trekking across his notes. They were good luck, he’d once been told, and it felt like it.
“Um,” Potter mumbles, “about, you know, a houseful.”
Faint sounds of laughter filtered through the doorway. Draco caught Potter’s eye. “That’s time.”
Walking into it was like a breath of fresh air. Which was the purpose, he reminded himself. Aside from the table and chairs on one side of the entrance and a sitting area on the other, the room was devoted to plants, both those that couldn’t winter outside and those that wouldn’t tolerate English climates at any time of year. Ferns and vines hung from the joists. Potted plants crowded the corners. The glass ceiling let in whatever sunlight Wiltshire could conjure in December, and the warmth of the room relaxed Draco as soon as he entered.
Realisation dawned on Potter’s face, closely followed by something nervous, and then open wariness. “They go to charity balls.”
“Yeah. Just…yeah.”
Draco popped open the top button of Potter’s flies. “Yeah.” He pulled down the zipper and saw Potter’s hips buck towards his hand. Fuck, but he wanted to touch. He was going to touch. He wanted to touch Potter so well that everything else slipped away, so that it was all that existed in the world. “How…?”
Granger choked on a piece of shredded beetroot. Potter leaned over to rub her back and seemed to be whispering expressions of concern.
He strokes himself tentatively, distractedly. His eyes are on my hips, focused on my pelvis with a mix of fear and anticipation.
“No need.” Draco tried for his calmest voice. “There’s plenty of room.”
“All Ministry forms are designed for accessibility. In case of an impairment that prevented you from reading the form the type would have automatically enlarged or, if necessary, the form would have read itself aloud. In the absence of those measures, we might assume that you were able to read the form and elected not to.”
There were good reasons, excellent reasons, why they stuck to these things—to the weather, Quidditch, sometimes a particularly benign news item, usually something from the arts section, which Harry would know only a little about and Malfoy would explain at length—and Malfoy was an absolute master of small talk. Harry almost admired it; it was a fair sight better than the old codgers at Ministry dos who were happy to drone endlessly for the pure pleasure of hearing themselves talk. Malfoy seemed to make some genuine effort to be engaging. Charming, even. Which was all well and good, except when it hit him that he knew very little about Malfoy, and that he felt as though he should have known more after a dozen dinners together. Or when Malfoy’s storytelling accompanied content that remained so firmly in the territory of “passably close to interesting” for such extended periods of time that Harry started to feel as though he was back in History of Magic, except that nobody had ever expected him to take Binns’ hand and whisper sweet nothings to him across candlelit hors d’oeuvres. For which he was eternally grateful, but still. If Malfoy could be passably interesting about vintage Lichtensteinian weather conditions, Harry thought he might be downright fascinating on topics he cared about.
“If you could look me in the eye after that and say anything less—”
On the other hand, he’d been perfectly able to light a fire. Wandlessly and wordlessly. Granted, without any awareness or control, but the raw magical ability was still there.
“Even the Galleons part? You don’t think that’s, like, letting them run me into the poorhouse or something?”
“No,” Harry shakes his head. “I—it’s always been yours. Ours.”
Draco found he couldn’t look away.
“After breakfast. I’ve got vegetables to write about. But I don’t think it’s so unreasonable to ask after a dear friend’s welfare.”
Malfoy looked almost exactly how Harry had always imagined a posh arsehole would look: smooth and pale and softer than silk. He’d never worked the beat in Diagon Alley, walking up and down endlessly in the sun, or spent weekends weeding a garden. He’d never handled tools until his fingertips built up callouses. For a moment, it reminded him of everything he’d thought he should hate about Malfoy.
He feels Harry’s thighs tense around him and smacks Harry’s arse, hard.
Malfoy’s eyes slipped to Harry’s cock, which was bobbing as he worked himself open. He was entranced until Harry spoke again. “Getting close…could start any time now.” He caught Malfoy’s eye. “Suppose you want me to stop, hmm?”
“Me too. Fine isn’t exactly the worst thing in the world.”
fine. His heart is racing and adrenaline is coursing through his veins. Harry’s wrist is in his hand and it feels delicate and improbable. His blood is hot. It all feels good. Really good.
Something in his chest loosened. He was relieved, tremendously so. He didn’t want to marry her any more than she wanted to marry him, if for very different reasons, but after all they’d been through, he’d be twice damned if he did anything other than support her. Which, if the way he felt her shoulders relax in his arms was any indication, he might have managed.
“You—?”
As if Draco’s dismay wasn’t bad enough, the rest of their group is looking, to varying degrees, shocked and appalled.
Draco’s glad that his own moan is muffled by the seal he’s created around Potter’s tip. It’s an undignified, needy sound, not the sort he’s accustomed to making. Not the sort he’s usually inspired to make, but he’s damned if Potter’s skin doesn’t raise goosebumps on his own, if Potter’s cock isn’t a flawless fit for his tongue.
“What will it mean for our world, to raise a generation that is taught that their blood status is who they are? That it is not their intention—not their virtue—that determines their ends or the means they use to reach them, but the unalterable fact of their blood?
“I feel as though I should insult you for old time’s sake.”
Malfoy had offered his shower, but hadn’t said anything about what to do afterwards. He’d offered the couch as a bed earlier, too, so presumably he wouldn’t mind if Harry slept there. But Harry knew he’d toss and turn; sleep felt even further away than it had the last time he’d tried.
“And so on?”
Still, something scratched at the back of his throat. His arrangement with Malfoy hardly extended to anything resembling friendship, but surely a biscuit would be permissible, if he could find one.
“What?”
As though it was impossible to love art that required a bit of thought. A bit of context.
“No!”
“You told Pansy you didn’t.”
“That’s too bad. I’ll have to try harder.” There it was: a plan. A hint at the future. The idea that they might not part ways outside the gallery, or after breakfast.
Beads of sweat spring up along Harry’s collar.
“Harry. Listen to me. Can you? Has the blood got back that way yet?”
“Then don’t run.”
you. They also might have given up trying to experiment on it. Kept it in the Department of Mysteries or taken a vault at Gringotts.”
“I’m afraid I wasn’t expecting that. I don’t mean to be brusque, but this meeting wound up being rather important, and I do want to keep you up to date.”
“Just think about love?”
“Mmm.” Harry nodded slowly against Draco’s chest.
“I haven’t been in Paris just for the food. I’m not any keener than you are on taking a stroll down Diagon Alley. You know none of this has been put to rest, really. Between Flint’s blood status bill and the Ministry’s politics and the number of unburied hatchets sure to be floating around in the general population… it’s all still with us. Some more than others,” he added. “Especially those of us who actually said or did anything, no matter our reasons. I doubt that Greg makes enough to live somewhere in the magical world that is secluded and secure enough to keep him safe from vigilantism. And if I’ve understood correctly, your income can’t become public knowledge, lest it raise questions. Correct?”
Eventually, he picked the English-language version up again. Luna’s name had appeared twice, he noticed. Once with beautiful beasts, once with a children’s dance circle. He had so many questions he didn’t know where to begin, and he wished again—if for entirely different reasons—that he could send a Patronus.
Potter’s chest shudders as he inhales. “Yes”
“I thought you didn’t know how…?”
He hopes. It’s something he seems to do a lot of these days. Which, Luna had pointed out, is an important change on its own. Though it hurts more than he remembered, this churning, achy feeling that’s seen him to sleep and woken up with him these last few days.
With a deep breath, he takes Draco into his mouth. He doesn’t gag this time, or cough, or lose his breath. He lets himself savour the salty bitterness that begins to gather at the back of his tongue.
“Mister Potter,” Narcissa intoned. “It’s lovely to see you again. I trust you’ve been well?”
“Not very. But it’s relevant to some of my larger clients. Daisy Green, for instance? Perhaps you’ve heard of her?” He raised his eyebrows at Draco.
Draco’s composure was mostly restored by the next day. Or as restored as it could be when he’d decided to go to the Ministry, and had the prospect of it hanging over him. But it was too dangerous for Harry to go without a team who knew the full extent of the situation, and it wouldn’t be long, and Draco’s aversion to hypocrisy was even stronger than his aversion to the Ministry. If he could insist that Harry should face his demons and go, he couldn’t argue otherwise on his own behalf.
“Very good.”
Draco turned to him, leaning an elbow on the embankment. “But you liked it?”
“Turn around again.”
“Full.” His voice sounds strained.
I’m hoping you get out of here before the semester’s over so we can spend some time together alone. I’ve asked Madame Pomfrey if it’s likely. Unfortunately, I think she maybe thought that I didn’t mean the question in a totally virtuous way. She’s got much stricter about kicking me out when she goes to bed. Why is it worse having Madame Pomfrey know than the Aurors? Still, I think it is. Hopefully you won’t mind too much that I really didn’t mean the question in a totally virtuous way.
Draco didn’t realise straight away that their breathing had lined up so that their bodies moved together even after the fact, or that when he started to fall asleep it was because he was surrounded with a gentle warmth that emanated from Harry’s body without ever becoming dangerous. He didn’t realise they were falling asleep at all until he felt Harry jerk.
He realised it might be construed as petty. He didn’t especially care. Not when this particular victory promised to taste better than the black truffle risotto at Orrery.
When I raised my brush, he grinned at me over the crook of his elbow. His eyes met mine. He faltered, letting his arm fall, opening his mouth and closing it again. His chest stilled.
Draco must’ve looked as confused as he felt.
The Snitch zips away, leaving nothing between them.
“Would you please share your thoughts on the matter?”
Though there was no longer any question in my mind of not going. Hadn’t been for some time. I sat next to him, close enough to reasonably place my fingers over his. He hooked his over mine and toed off his trainers. I followed suit.
“The meeting.” Draco shook his head on his way towards the sideboard. “The meeting. Neat? Rocks?”
Circe, but Draco would be happy to let him play. He arched into Potter’s body, moaned when Potter nipped at his collarbone and grabbed at his sides. Grabbed back, and gasped at Potter’s throaty moan resonating through their chests. Slapped Potter’s arse, and lost his breath when Potter pressed back into it. Flipped Potter onto his back and held him there, settled his hips onto Potter’s hips and his hands onto Potter’s shoulders and felt all reason slip away when Potter arched up in search of touch. In search of Draco’s touch.
Another affirmation.
“Well, Granger asks after you often enough that we’d better trot you out, really, lest she think I’ve got you chained up in here. Besides which, as evidenced by this morning, your outbursts are so erratic that it’s entirely possible that nothing will happen.”
“Or it was never the same because my side was honest, and yours lied.”
The night before rushed back in. Potter, his intimations, their intimacies. He closed his eyes against it. How had he got here? What were they doing?
“Cold,” he murmurs.
Still, Harry shakes his head, looking embarrassed, now, as well as afraid.
He shrugged.
He could barely wait until nine the next morning to talk to Potter. As always, Potter sat by the window with a book. But Draco saw him twitch as he approached, even though he didn’t look up from the text until Draco was practically looming over him.
She laughed again, more heartily. “Hearts are not the relevant organ.”
“You’re quite welcome.”
Draco looked him over. “Shall I take it, then, that you don’t want to listen to the Quidditch?”
(ed. note – see p. 33 for more on S.P.E.W. and how to support the cause!)
“Names?”
He grasped Potter’s cock firmly, and the guttural noise that rose from Potter’s chest was already enough. He began to lose track of the rhythm just as they’d established it.
Draco tried to steer the conversation elsewhere. “Potter, I really would like to discuss the meeting.”
“That too, yes.”
“Eighty-eight, eighty-nine,” Harry counted, pausing to silently admonish a kitten who was about to take flight. “Ninety-one, ninety-two.”
The crime scenes that Harry had witnessed, and that Malfoy had not.
He also knew that Potter was a wreck. And his patient. And, by all accounts except those seemingly put forth by Potter’s subconscious, straight.
Potter, who still looked thoroughly tentative.
"Don't move," he ordered, and tightened one hand around Malfoy's wrists while removing the other. He hesitated for a moment before dropping his hand to Malfoy's tie. It was navy, with a tiny houndstooth print, and it felt like silk. Probably was silk. Malfoy gasped, and Harry barely bit back a moan, when Harry reached for the knot, slipping a finger inside of it to loosen it.
Potter’s frown deepens, and he sets the box of biscuits on a shelf. “No, I’ll help.”
“Oh, goodness.” The witch gasped in an exaggerated show of concern. “Is everything quite all right?”
“Or… arming.”
He tried breathing in for four, hold for four, out for four. His throat caught. He cleared it. Hold for four, out for four, and his attention focused entirely on Malfoy. The Malfoy in the mirrors was a shadow. Harry knew the promises of shadows were always lies, meant to pull one further from what was real and alive. It had taken him time to learn to want those things, the real and alive things. To learn how to identify them.
He shivered, colour draining from his face, and gave Draco a thin smile. “Bit cold.”
"I am," Harry answered. "Any objection?"
had practically had to fight her way out of the house to stave off the influx of love letters, hate mail, and autograph requests, and Hermione had barely talked the Hogwarts Reconstruction Committee out of sending last-minute appeals plastered with that morning’s headline: “POTTER AND MALFOY TO HEADLINE HRC GALA.”
“These aren’t rules. They’re, you know. Laws.”
“Auror Potter—”
Draco barely avoided pointing out that “it” was not, in fact, an “it,” but a “him.” It couldn’t be his priority. He laughed. “Absolutely not.” He threw in a chuckle. “You confuse the lack of a fast result for the lack of a competent result. A problem you share with your colleague?” He raised an eyebrow.
“I don’t think that should be different from anything else. The only danger is in holding it back. If you don’t—if you tell me whatever it is you’re feeling, or show me—it shouldn’t be any problem at all.”
“To borrow a phrase, I disagree.”
He didn’t pick anything up. Just ran the pad of his thumb over his fingernails. They’re so short, and the skin was brown around the edges, there was dirt under his fingernails, and he kept running his thumb back and forth over them. I followed those fingers as he advanced up the steps, as his legs came into view. And then one was coming towards me. I closed my eyes. I could feel it at my chin, the rough callous on the outside of the first knuckle of his index finger, where his wand rests when he’s casting. And then a stretch in my neck as he tilted my face towards him. The heat of his breath against my lips.
“Um. I would need to check my schedule. I… before all this, I had a secretary. He kept track. Think he still does, just sends the updates to Hermione.”
“A date.”
“Yes, well.” Draco smooths his robes.
A shake of his head, just barely.
” The door swung shut and locked itself. Potter inhaled sharply. “Of course you are.” He smiled, stepping closer so the zip on Potter’s jacket scraped against the fine wool of his suit. “Of course that’s the only reason you’re breathing like you’re halfway through a chase.”
And when he closes his eyes, he still sees Harry’s skin, and the coarse hair on his thighs, and the tiny lines at the corners of his eyes that didn’t used to be there but are lovely all the same. And he thinks maybe it’s a fine line, really, between courage and fear. And he wonders if having one of the two—if letting himself acknowledge that he is, in fact, scared out of his bloody mind—could be enough.
“It is now, yes. Though it probably wouldn’t hurt if our star attractions circulated a bit.”
“I’ve only died twice.”
Harry doesn’t take a second helping; he can’t stand them knowing he’s still hungry, so hungry, when everyone looks like they’re chewing straw.
I crook a finger under his jaw and tilt his eyes up to face mine. “Trust me.”
“Or I like to pretend it’s you touching me.”
“They’re right here.” Malfoy holds out an arm, the trousers folded neatly over his wrist.
Potter’s face froze. “Pardon?”
“Your terms?
Draco looked down. The five points of Potter’s fingertips had burned through his robes and shirt, leaving his skin red and exposed to the winter air, and beginning to blister where Potter’s thumb had pressed against his chest.
- Read November’s
“What’s—?” Potter paused, the lines in his forehead growing deeper. “What’s the difference between them? And why does it change things?”
. But, I just… It was important to tell you. But you don’t have to… you know. Anything.”
Next to him, Potter began a languid stretch. From the corner of his eye, he retraced his path—Potter’s neck, his nipples, the line trailing down his stomach.
Soon, it’s almost three, and Potter’s things are in the hallway. It’s just Potter, then, alone and standing in front of him, hands in his pockets and a nervous expression.
“Well,” Draco joked, “it’s generally good etiquette to ask before you stick anything anywhere.”
“Funny how you don’t break into hives when we meet them at the pub.”
She bit her tongue between her teeth, sticking it out at him in the process.
She laughs, her voice still flooded with relief. “Lose things often?”
“Yeah?” He breathes.
Harry exhales when the harried-looking stranger who comes through the doors isn’t Draco. It’s a man he doesn’t know, a few years younger than himself and, Harry notices without meaning to, rather fit.
“So you see,” Malfoy began. “I have found a calling and a home. Perhaps I owe you thanks for that. There was clarity in your absence. I believe that answers your questions.” Malfoy gave him a curt nod, and began to walk away.
Potter shakes his head. “I didn’t even know where you were. All I ever heard was that it wasn’t Azkaban, something about community service, but no one told me anything for sure.”
“Yes,” Draco said in his driest voice. “I’ve just reminded you that you have the ability to refuse to consent to medical procedures so that I can make you do whatever I want.” He didn’t try to hide his eyeroll. “Because I think I’m so clever, probably.”
So he pressed Potter into the wall next to his fireplace and held him there. Potter’s pupils had dilated. Draco leaned forward until their lips were a finger’s width apart. “Pleased with your decision?”
He saw stars, and he felt the weight of Malfoy’s body against him as they tumbled, spent, to the ground. He felt softness below him, and warmth, and his every last muscle, every last cell, was quiet.
“Where are we?”
But when he glances down towards my cock, I see that familiar fear. My heart sinks as I wait for the rejection, the ‘just your fingers,’ the ‘I love a plug.’
“Fine, fine. And if Potter left the Wand at home…?”
“What is this?” Harry asked. “Where are we?”
Draco exhales and it practically echoes in the silence. He wonders if this is how Potter breaks suspects, leaving them to stew in the morass of their own thoughts.
,” again, more insistently, “The Vanishing Department has fulfilled your request.”
Draco removed his hand entirely and saw Potter sag against the window, bracing his head against the glass. His back heaved as he tried to catch his breath, and the tension was gone from his shoulders. Even if they tightened at the sound of Draco’s zip, as he shoved his trousers and pants down to free his cock, Potter made no move when Draco pressed his erection against the crease of his arse. Instead, he moaned, unmistakeable and barely restrained.
“It wasn’t part of the plan at this point, and I won’t compel you to do it if you’d rather not, but it would be helpful at some point.”
She held firm as half a dozen sets of eyes focused on her. “I’m not,” she repeated. “I don’t believe the risk is worthwhile, or ethical.”
“What?”
Potter had the good grace to look the teensiest bit abashed when Draco offered him a restrained smile instead of a bollocking.
“Perhaps we should finish this conversation in private,” Granger suggested.
“’Kay,” Potter managed, barely, through a gasp. “Okay. Fuck. Yeah.”
“No, that’s fine. I don’t mind. It’s going well, I think. It’s hard to know what’s down to that, versus spending more time outside of the void and working on my magic. But nothing's happened since I talked to Hermione. And I have been spending much more time outside of the void. So clearly, something’s working.”
“More,” Draco repeats. “Yeah, more.”
Draco, trying to proceed with caution, spoke slowly. “You had nowhere to go after the trials. No money, no opportunities. I had a Manor house with a full staff that was about to sit unused for years on end, maybe forever. And you had, both of you, been friends. Pansy, I know we never meant to make anything of it, but you and I were supposed to be betrothed, even. And Greg, you were always there for me. Always. You were friends who risked your lives, or close enough, to try to end that bloody war one way or another.” Angry momentum began to build in Draco’s chest, and he struggled to stay calm in the face of it. “I don’t think wanting to ensure that you didn’t lose your lives or good health in the aftermath was pity. I’d have called it friendship at the time. Still would, even after a decade passed with nary a word from either of you, but perhaps that’s the French influence as well. All those emotions, you know.”
Not that he’s a vindictive person. He isn’t. Or at least much less of one nowadays. But if you’ve got to be relegated to a sub-sub-Basement and tasked with sorting the detritus of the wizarding world’s tendency to Vanish first and think later, you’ve got to take your pleasures as they come. And your opportunities.
“That’s okay. Maybe a pile? Would be good?”
He doesn’t really want to see. At least, it’s not at the top of his list of priorities. Not that he’s going to admit that to Draco, never mind poor Phillips, who’s looking a bit shocked at Draco’s less than deferential treatment of him. “Sure. Show me.”
Draco felt a wave of warmth travel over him. It relaxed his shoulders and ended at his toes, and when it had passed he took stock, and the duvet was dry. “Nice,” he said, hoping his very genuine appreciation came through. “Now, shall we get under them?”
“Yes,” he said slowly, the truth of it hitting him as he spoke. “I will.”
It’s got Potter on the front cover, of course. Not exactly a surprise, considering they had him in May, him with Granger and Weaselby in June, him and Longbottom in July, and him with Krum and Delacour in September – “War Heroes, back to school!”— as though the other two did anything. Just a follow up to the break they took in August for Krum’s Quidditch World Cup feature.
Draco kissed him urgently, grasping at the floor and rocking forward until the head of his cock slipped past the edge of Harry’s slick, open arse.
“Then…” Draco knew it, really knew it, for the first time. “We’re stuck.”
“And he’ll be there?”
V          V          V          V          V
Potter narrows his eyes at that last. “Fine. Maybe I could look around a bit. See what I recognise.”
“Do mine?” Draco asked, holding it out to him.
Draco nodded, looking at Harry, but avoiding his stare. “Shall we begin, then?”
You do not go out. Not out there. Some men do but it’s the beat for you. That’s why you come here, the heat and the press and the sweat and the noise.
Harry quirked his mouth, looking properly embarrassed now. “Twelve.”
“Jumpers are a lot less memorable than dioramas of plastic Muggle children’s dolls arrayed in scenes of torture, I assure you. Or this one needlepoint, what did it say?
“What, ‘I, Draco Malfoy, do pledge to become world famous by experimenting on people’?”
Shacklebolt sat up in his chair. “Is there any chance of Auror Potter making a return to public life? We’re entering the height of charity season.”
“There is, yes, and we’ve arranged lunch service for four, if I might have a moment to explain?”
A lazy grin replaced Malfoy’s stubborn stoicism. “Why don’t you make me then, Potter?”
“Incredible,” he breathes.
It felt a lot like end of term. Knee deep in robes, tripping over his trunk, popping out of his bedroom for input from Pansy… it all felt so familiar. And through it all, Draco moved about his rooms in a haze. He’d taken things out and put them back many times over without accomplishing anything. At last, for something to do, he’d pulled a row of his work robes out of the wardrobe and set to work trying to fold them.
More introductions are made, Champagne in hand, and Draco manages not to make a mess of any of them. He’s grateful that Granger and Weasley aren’t in attendance—home with a sick child, Harry says—but he manages with Dean Thomas, with George Weasley, with Susan Bones. Even though he’s struck with the same fear every time one of them appears. Even though it lingers after they’ve left.
Hermione’s lips quirked in spite of an obvious effort at staying calm. “Only over the course of years.”
“Weasley, Bell, Safar—that’s it?”
“Okay.” She didn’t move from the spot. “Thank you. For bringing this to my attention.”
“I’ve ordered already,” Harry said.
“No.”
He decides not to think about why he’s not done it already. Except that there are perfectly reasonable reasons. It would be clumsy to release the information after the fact. It would be more transparently pointed, and while the Malfoy name is in far better standing than it was a decade ago, anything that appears to smear Potter remains inadvisable. He could frame it as a scandal though, he realises. They’d need to cook up some twaddle about photo verification processes to explain the delayed release of information, but he could do it. Some sensationalistic headline implying that Potter was a dirty Auror, or Jordan reliant on corrupt inside sources. Isn’t that the whole point of owning the press, after all?
Millie, bless her, was trying to ease the way with Scotch and the sort of concise briefing that got one promoted to an assistant to the Minister. Though after the third glass, he was no longer sure if the two were complementary or at cross purposes.
Harry considered. “Okay. Yeah.” He paused. “What happens if it doesn’t work?”
Millie guided Granger back into her seat and pushed it in. “To be quite honest, I’d assumed you’d pick up on it. Given the family business.”
“Liar. You’re such a liar.”
He looked at her disbelievingly. “After all I’ve done to pick up a distinctly different line of work?”
“What do you care?”
Harry shuddered. “Don’t exactly fancy doing that in front of Hermione. What if we tried again beforehand?
“Them?”
you. And you dare, you fucking dare, suggest that I was in the wrong for not remaining totally celibate in the fucking decade you’ve spent ignoring me?”
“Harry.” Draco squeezed his hand and tried to smile at him, though it felt mostly like a tactic to diminish the blow. “I appreciate that, truly, I do. But that’s not what you want to do, or what your foundation is meant to be about. And even if it were, this kind of work relies on there being patients to see and a community of scholars to work with. There’s no institutional infrastructure to support that in England. It’s not about money. One of the few things, but there you go. It’s about the entire British approach to magical medicine. If they took Muggle science seriously, they might have to take Muggles seriously, and that would upend far too many things to be palatable.”
Potter lets out a tiny snort at that, but is otherwise impassive.
To say I was alright, though, would be an understatement. He fit perfectly, just enough of a stretch, and I felt wonderfully full.
And, anyway, it left him time for a cucumber and prawn sandwich and a teacake.
“If you change your mind?”
All eyes turned to Draco. He raised his cup cheerfully and took a sip.
The man casts Draco a wounded look. “Surely that’s not necessary.”
“Huh?”
He cleared his throat and rolled his eyes at it. “My schedule is booked today and I am overseeing a surgery on Wednesday. Is the Minister available Thursday at half noon?”
“Lager? Whatever you’re having?”
“What, don’t recognise the giant family crest?” Draco doesn’t wait for his response, aiming for the ugliest item he can find instead. He’s certain this one isn’t Potter’s, but it’s been languishing down here for months and he’s curious to know if Potter has any clue whatsoever.
comfort was another matter; he’d heard enough stories from their interrogation rooms to know they could take a certain pleasure in discomfort. Maybe they’d made it warmer, just to make him sweat.
“Why the Minister?”
Hesitantly, ever so hesitantly, Potter took a step forward. A tiny step. Another tiny step. And then he stopped.
"Drilled the manners out of you, did they?"
Harry stepped back, obviously surprised at seeing Pansy and Draco together at the door. “Hi.”
Higsbee doesn’t step forward until Draco hands him the parchment. Then his eyebrows move faster than his feet ever have. “Sir? Is this true? Are you certain? This could be quite a risky—”
The portrait laughs. “Except that. But I’m afraid that’s largely unavoidable if you hope to live an interesting life.”
“You can’t seriously think I hurt the bird!” He insisted, hoping at least for some responses to that.
to me,” he shouted. “He doesn’t know what he wants. He wants to please everyone, wants to keep the peace, wants to give up most everything to make this easier on all of you. Don’t let him do that. You’re the only ones who can stop him, even make him wait.”
“Of the jar in which she held a woman hostage? Potter, are you quite sure Granger isn’t the… well.”
“Is that what you think?” he asked. “That I’ve done all of this work to dress myself up as a Muggle-lover in order to, what, feed Muggle artists to the pure-blood wolves?”
Draco shook his head slowly. “Yet every time I see you, it’s with requests for an update on when he can start raising money again.”
Draco felt the first, relaxing hint of victory. “If anyone’s been rude, Potter, it’s you. Though that’s far less surprising.”
Dear Harry,
Draco was equal parts impressed and jealous, and in the world of academia the latter was an excellent incentive to revive his own research. It felt like ages ago since he’d left his students with instructions to pursue the question of whether wand wood or cores alone would have a similar effect, in hopes of producing even slimmer implants. It wasn’t a bad question, but it wasn’t what he wanted to think about. He left them to it and started poring over his case notes from Harry. He wanted to know more about the connection between magical deprivation and wandless magic. He wanted to understand whether and how implants would work elsewhere in the body. He wanted a better understanding of magical bone conductivity, and how witches and wizards were trained to cast in parts of the world where wandless magic was common, or where potions or ceremonies, rather than charms, were the centre of magical life. He thought about travelling. Seeing if Mahoutokoro or Uagadou would take him on for a year or two as a visitor.
Who ignored it and gave Potter a wide berth as he went to the bar and retrieved what was left of his martini. Drink in hand, he turned his face to the window, focusing on the view below and keeping his back to the room. Potter had fucking loved it, and if he was too priggishly embarrassed to behave with a modicum of maturity, so be it. “I’m free from one till three tomorrow and will let Kate know to expect you.”
“Fine. I just thought...whatever. Can you just give me a moment?”
“That’s not true!” The words exploded out of Harry before he could consider them. “I stay! I’ve been friends—family—with Ron and Hermione and the Weasleys for
“Auror Potter? In your professional opinion—”
