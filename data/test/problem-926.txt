But he didn’t even know how to end that sentence. What he wanted right now was for Draco to stop time and stay. What he wanted right now was to know if Draco felt like his world had been shaken and torn and turned upside down. Because Harry’s had and he didn't know how to put it back together. How to make it the way it was before. Before this.
‘Why don’t you just leave?’ I’m screaming at him, voice clipping high, shattering too. I can barely see, my face feels all wet. ‘It’s not your fucking problem-’
‘You always have been…’ Harry went on. ‘At school, I pretended I didn’t care, but… it’s not just that. I never thought that you… That night… you at this club… I couldn't believe it. It was the best sex of my fucking life.’ Harry looked at him evenly. He bit his lip. ‘But I thought that… since you’ve already had me, you’d move on to more interesting men and-’
Harry broke the kiss and watched him closely, hands on each side of his face. He looked solemn, happy, unsure. He let his head drop to Draco’s chest and they lay like that for some time, none of them wanting to break whatever was happening between them. Harry was still wearing the collar and it helped that he was because that meant they were inside the scene and Draco needed that a bit longer. His fingers traced idly over the collar, touching Harry’s soft and damp skin. His eyes fell on a purple bruise on Harry’s neck, shaped like a crescent moon.
‘Is that what you tell yourself when you need to go to sleep?’ I ask. ‘That you’re just addicted to fucking with people’s heads?’
‘Yes,’ the word hits my face, shakes the real world full force. There’s pain in my chest, as my heart expands to contain it.
I stare at the table. There’s a dark smudge in the wood, next to the sugar bowl. I remember Harry’s splayed hands there, scrambling for purchase as I fucked him good. I remember how he begged. How I lost myself that night.
He looks completely different from the playboy or the hero. Like I’m meeting him for the first time, even though we’ve known each other our whole lives. He seems about to say something, but stops himself. Weirdly, I feel I’m about to cry. He leans in closer, brushes his mouth against my lips again.
Like the best kind of drug, Potter finds me at my weakest. He says this as he moves right into my personal space, body warm & wired from dancing. I can almost taste the heat of his chosen hookup for the night on him. But I don’t miss the fact that he’s left the bloke he’d been pinning against a wall for hours, to walk all the way across the club and stand this close to me.
I go around the table and pick up my jumper from the floor. He’s there in an instant, his hand on my wrist.
‘During the War, me, Hermione and Ron were hiding. We were hunting for the Horcruxes. It drew us apart… one day, Ron left us. He came back guided by a light, much like the one I conjured up for you. The light told him where we were. It got him back to where he belonged, and back to the love of his life.’
‘It’s been a while since I kissed someone without blood being involved. ‘Kinda nice for a change,’ I lie and lean back against the counter to watch him.
‘I thought… either you’re here to get drunk alone, or you’re waiting for something,’ I lift my arm up, unthinking.
Mother thanked him, of course. His answer, if I remember correctly, was that he also had something to thank her for. I have no idea what they were talking about and I couldn’t care less.
‘What do you think?’ he asked in a low voice. ‘I know you’re dying to touch it.’ His tone made Harry shudder. He paused, feeling their breaths evening together, synced.
I’m practically snorting with laughter at this point. A line shows up on his forehead. He stands up, his right hand balling into a fist.
Harry’s eyes lingered on his hands over his belt, then on his hips, and when Draco was expecting them to lower still, they climbed up again. As if he wasn’t sure he could keep still if he did look where he
‘Yes, Draco. I’ll do that,’  Harry took another deep breath and felt himself falling right into it again, going down.
The order had barely left his mouth, and Harry’s dutiful fingers were on the bulge in Draco’s designer trousers. They were hesitant, but just as fast all hesitation was gone. Harry was in no way inexperienced. He knew exactly how to touch Draco, with enough pressure and maddening shyness. He cupped Draco through the fabric. His hand lay there for a moment, unmoving, warm, gentle. Draco felt himself harden under it.
I hate the power in his voice, the thing that keeps reminding me of exactly who he is, what he means to everyone in our world. What he will always mean to me.
Long formal functions stretching into long hours of you waiting for his sign to follow him, waiting to know where he wants to have you next. Bathrooms, cloakrooms, anywhere you both can have a bit of privacy. The danger of getting caught, the secrecy of it all, the fact that no else knows you’re having him… some nights, you can’t quite believe it’s real.
. The War did fuck us up. It did take something from us that can’t be retrieved. But it also brought us here. It made us come back to each other all through this hellish year. The worst year… and the best one, too.
I thought he wouldn’t want anyone to know we’re sleeping together, that he wouldn’t want people talking about it, thinking it was something other than it is. Because we’re just
Josh was coming up to Harry, only then pausing the flogging. Harry’s pain threshold and his physical resistance were, by far, the best Draco had ever witnessed on a submissive. Josh was lifting Harry’s face up, his hands tugging on the dark hair strands harshly, but Draco saw his pleased smile, noticed the way his other hand touched Harry’s cheek, gentle. The lights were treading on the beads of sweat crawling down Harry’s neck. Draco so wanted to drag his nails there, to watch the skin turn red. Then he wanted to lick those marks up Harry’s neck, and bite him, on that spot of skin close to his ear, until he’d draw blood and one of those delicious, helpless whimpers.
He was leaning against the cross, his arms free of the restraints, Draco holding him close, arms wrapped around Harry, so careful. Draco was using a wet cloth to clean his chest, slowly and gently. He did not remember Draco moving away from him, but his hole felt empty. Every place on Harry’s body hurt and throbbed and he loved it. Draco caressed his arms, over and over, warming them up, making sure he was fine and he was, he truly was, even if tomorrow he would be sleeping this off the whole day.
He stops suddenly, grabs my hair with such force that my scalp burns, pulls me up and bashes me against the wall. It’s all so quick that I hit the stone blindly. I feel something warm and liquid running down my nose. The pain starts there and irradiates everywhere. He’s on me, forcing me against the wall again, his hand around my neck. I’m choking, there are dark spots in my vision, my skull rattles. A silent scream inside my head.
He’d counted on his self-preservation to keep away, so he couldn’t quite logically justify why he was back at the club, one week later,
Andrew was good. Safe. My chance of a future, even if a rather boring one. The engagement ring he gave me was a thing of beauty. Single diamond in a golden band. A bold choice for him, let me tell you. Say what you will about Andrew, but he has great taste (he wanted me, after all). Only the best for you, he’d said, kneeling at my feet in his perfect Armani suit. He was also a reasonable man; quite understanding when I told him that I needed to think about it. You should take your time, dear. So I did. Take my time, I mean.
It was nothing like kissing Harry, because kissing Harry wasn't like any kissing he'd done. The only thing that mattered were Harry’s eyes on him, the maddening whimper out of his mouth, as Draco and Josh devoured each other slowly. Josh’s hands were on his arse, Draco’s hard cock pressed between their bodies, but he was wired to Harry, to his ever fast breathing, to the desperation thawing at his skin. Harry’s magic went wild, the absurd energy of it mounting around Draco, curling around his wrists, tendrils catching on his arms, raw with need. The pull towards Harry was like a roaring scream inside his mind and still he pushed Harry further down the spiral, his tongue slipping inside Josh’s mouth.
I’m sure he’s the only reason they let me get back to Hogwarts. This is all I have now. Finish school. Get a proper job. Marry whomever mother says. Produce an heir for what’s left of the Malfoy’s fortune. It’s nothing but a task list. All I have to do is check the boxes. Unless something happens.
I never want anything as much as I want to hurt him. To get some sort of reaction out of him. We duel fast and furious. If I still cared for it, I’d say we’re top of the class. But I no longer give a fuck about grades, I just want Hogwarts to be done. To check that off the list.
All the exhaustion you’ve been feeling settles on your shoulders. You decide on the spot that if he comes closer and tries to take off your clothes, you’re going to tell him to piss off and then you’re probably also gonna tell him everything else.
‘Let me show you why.’ Harry’s eyes were dark-green, eager. He looked at Josh, pleading. ‘Tell him, tell him I’m good.’
Heading for the balcony, cigarette already between his fingers, white blond hair falling over his right eye. You drain your drink and set it on a passing tray.
He chuckles. It’s a flat kind of laugh, but it’s still a laugh. Somewhat careless. But his eyes are on me. I have his whole attention.
He tugged at the leash and Harry walked in. He immediately dropped down to his knees, kneeling before the couch on the left, head bent, arms tucked behind him. Draco looked back at Josh.
‘Three weeks. It’s been three weeks since—' You feel so fucking stupid saying it out loud. 'I’m — I can’t believe I counted it—’
‘You’re my type too,’ Draco said, that slow smile still on his face. Harry got lost in it. ‘You’ve always been my type.’
Harry’s eyes were fixed on the spot where he knew Draco was, his body stretched taut, as if defying its own limits, welcoming the pain Josh was giving him. His back was arching up as much as it could with the restraints on his wrists and ankles, clearly searching contact with the flogger. The leather cut harshly into his skin, the sound of it mingling with those little gasps coming out his mouth. All that power, so beautifully laid at another’s man’s feet. So willingly forsaken.
‘I like how you are… when you’re with me. You’re all posh and sometimes you drive me around the bend - but that’s not all that you are. To me, I mean.’
‘I would wear it at work, under my robes. For you.’ Harry didn’t blush this time. ‘I could be waiting for you at home, only in this.’ His thumb brushed over the tip of Draco’s cock. Harry looked down at it, a hungry look in his eyes. ‘I’d get my hole ready for your cock…’ He looked up again.
He chuckles against my hair. We get to his room and he drops me on the bed. I realise just how tired I am. I let him undress me, his hands gentle. I didn’t know how much I wanted him to undress me and not fuck me. It feels too good to be true. He moves away and I open one of my eyes to see him standing there holding a pair of red Gryffindor pyjamas.
His fingers brush a strand of my hair behind my ear. He’s touched me before, but this feels too good to be true.
His eyes fall on the mess on the other side of the room. It’s as if a hurricane has passed over that desk. Chair pushed back, piles of paper everywhere, a confusion of parchments, a bottle of ink carelessly open, its content drying up in the air. His partner is like an atmospheric mishap. Nothing stays the same after he leaves. Like most of the Ministry employees he’d left hours ago, carrying a ton of colourful bags with him. Probably to spend Christmas surrounded by the whole array of redheads he calls family. Draco had thrown a Merry Christmas at his back. He doesn’t know if Potter heard him.
Harry jerked at that final word. The spell kept his cock in a tight vice, gripping at his bollocks and making it impossible for him to come.
Harry nodded frantically. He would take what he could have. It would never be enough. He hitched his hips up, Draco driving into him, fast and hard, and the change in angle made everything better and all the more impossible. He bucked against Draco, using his thighs to bring his body closer to Draco’s, his cock dragging against Draco’s clothes. It was a torment, but so worthy, because Draco grunted loud on his ear, and he clenched his jaw. Then Draco lost it, his hips snapped, his mouth climbed up Harry’s throat, biting and kissing and moaning, and Harry felt devoured, his body wrecked, Draco pounding him.
‘God. Please,’ Harry groaned. He struggled to keep speaking. ‘I’ll be ready, my mouth open for you to put your cock in.’
Harry forced his eyes open. He looked dazed, his body loose and his cock still hard. Draco recognized the look of a submissive who hoped to be rewarded.
The green eyes finally turned on him. They started on his face, lowered to his neck, to his chest, and kept going down, burning everything in their wake. Draco felt like they were taking in every fucking detail. He knew he looked good. That most men felt lucky for a night with him. But under that stare he felt all powerful and powerless at the same time.
He untangles from you to light the lamp by the nightstand. It gives off a dimmed light, filling his room with shadows. There’s a large, and (you can bet) comfortable bed at the center, sparse decoration, but you can’t pay attention to any of it.
‘Buy me a drink and I put out, is that it?’ I say in my best bored tone, even as I pick up the glass and give the golden-bronze liquid a swirl.
He finishes his speech, quite out of breath. I open my mouth. Then close it. I seem to be doing that a lot. Everything he’s just said makes sense. It’s probably the same reason he chose this secluded table for us. I’ve been such a fool.
His voice does this thing where it rises and falls and catches and clips. His fury is cold, but also demanding. He wants to make me confess to it. I stop laughing. This is the longest he has spoken to me. Like, ever. His hand flexes at his side. We’re not allowed wands during detention, which is probably a good idea.
Harry moaned freely, something in his control loosening up, his eyes trained on the movement of Draco’s hands.
Harry closed his eyes for the briefest of seconds. When he opened them, everything was out in the open.
It was hard to not let it get to his head - but he’d lost that battle almost immediately. It had gotten to his head and to his cock, and way too fast. He didn’t want to say it had gotten to his heart. That would be pitiful. He prized himself on not letting that organ - or better, its most commonplace
And suddenly I remember what’s wrong with this scenario. My shoulders tense. I take my hand away again.
‘You know… my eyes are up here,’ Draco said slowly, and Harry’s head snapped up. The green was almost dark. Harry licked his lips, swallowed. He was so fucking easy to read, Draco felt the threads of the power play coming to life around him, pulling Harry inevitably to him.
And then it all happens very fast. Flannagan looks straight ahead, but I watch how he deliberately bumps his shoulder hard against Draco’s. I can tell that Draco doesn’t notice him until it’s already happening. The plate nearly drops from his shaking hand, bright red juice spills over to the floor. Draco flinches, face livid. He looks away from Flannagan, steps back fast without a single word.
, he wanted to say, but his throat closed down on him. They stayed like that, silent, Harry’s forehead resting against his, their hands skating over each other.
Yeah, Malfoy has pink hair. Or sort of. Half of his hair is shaved short and dyed an aggressive pink. The other half is still white-blond, a strand falling over his right eye, only the left side of his face visible at all times. He turns it slightly and spots me beyond the moving bodies. He doesn’t stop dancing, a smile plays on his lips. This time I don’t look away like I used to when all this began.
He looks up and his mouth opens and closes, tight, around the tip of your cock. It’s warm and perfect, the right kind of pressure. His tongue does wonderful things there, finding your sweet spot. Your pants feel damp, you wonder if he’s going to take them off or make you lose it like this. He’s clearly not in a hurry to finish you off. He takes his time sucking you through the fabric, looking up at you, molten silver eyes, that strand of wild hair brushing his face. There’s no warning, no build-up. Your body tenses, your mouth hangs open in a silent scream and you come in your pants.
‘It’s going to get worse tomorrow. The bruises.’ I clear my throat. ‘Maybe… you should get to the Hospital Wing- I could come with you-’
His mouth crashes over yours. You swallow the guilt by letting him kiss you silent. He licks your lower lip, then his teeth sink there, biting. There’s a hunger in him that feeds your own. You nearly lift him off his feet and he pushes you into another room.
‘I want to be so good for you…’ Harry curled his fingers around Draco’s cock. He gave it a gentle pull.
He stopped begging, he stopped wishing he could come, he just let Draco use him, drink him down, tease him beyond desperation. Draco controlled their pace, slow and maddening, his hands caressing Harry’s thighs, then his nails bit into his skin there and the pain mingled with the pleasure, sweetly. Draco was the perfect picture of someone who loved sucking cock and would gladly be at it for hours.
‘I noticed you, noticing me…’ Malfoy went on, his hand moving on Harry’s cock. Stroking him, but so slowly it was downright torture. His fingers smoothed along Harry’s length, silky and soft.
. I add a warming spell and light my cigarette. Inhale. Exhale. In all this, my wand never left my pocket. I've been practicing wandless, non-verbal magic. Sometimes, I think it’s the only thing that still has any meaning. The only thing I have left. Inhale, exhale.
‘I’ve known you almost all my life,’ Draco said. ‘I can’t look away. I just can’t look away… from you. There’s no one else, because…’ Fucking hell, he was having trouble breathing. Why was this so hard? ‘There is no one else
He inhales, the bright tip of the cigarette pointing upwards. It occurs to you just then that some people turn smoking into an art form. You don’t know much about art, but you get it’s the sort of thing you can lose yourself in. A good book. A good film. Even a museum. The sort of place where you go to forget there’s a wide messy world around you, even as you dive deep into it.
‘Why do you always have to play the hero? Save me from the fire, now save me from - what?-’ I’m shouting. My voice is not my own.
In the hallway, you manage to get his shirt open. Your hands stop on the stark-white scars you made all those years ago.
Malfoy laughs softly at her tone, his hand on my thigh not moving one bit. Parkinson smiles at us in a way that tells me that one, she knows we were about to kiss; two, she’s not in the least surprised.
His hand ran over Harry’s hair; it lingered there for some time. Sweet. Harry felt his head spinning. The slightest touch from Malfoy had the power to unhinge him.
I watch him leaving, the black sweater hugging his slumping shoulders, hands disappearing into the pockets of his well-worn jeans. I lose interest in whatever the bloke is doing and yank his hands away.
the letter just like I did with all of the others, but the sight of his terrible writing, spelling my name just
There’s no doubt in my mind that she means every word. But something about what she’s just said hits closer to home.
Draco revelled in the helplessness of it. Harry’s eyes dared to wander as far as his lips, then to the corner of his mouth, then up to his eyes again.
All the people who commented on the first chapter... Your comments are *the reason* this second and last chapter exists. Without that, I'd have given up and left it as it was. I thought I would be unable to surpass what I did on the first, and you made me press through. Your excitement about this BDSM love story is what kept me believing in myself, is what made me able to get Draco and Harry to the happy ending they deserve.
Draco glanced at Harry. He watched the heat climbing up his neck, the faint red covering his cheeks, his chest heaving. It was clear that he loved to be discussed like this, like he wasn’t even there and didn’t have a say in it. That was damn perfect, because Draco had a thing for making his subs go crazy with just the right words. It doubled the pleasure - saying everything he meant to do and then doing it.
As he thought that, Josh set the flogger aside on the table, and removed Harry’s ankles’ restraints. Draco felt his own pulse beating hard on his wrist. Josh helped Harry up, then had him kneeling on the floor again, mere feet away from where Draco was sitting, exactly like that first time.
The song changes. Upbeat and indecent. Like the way he moves. He doesn’t care one bit what anyone thinks. His white shirt clings to his chest, collar open carelessly, sleeves rolled up to his elbows. My eyes search and find what they’re looking for: his tattoos, flowers along his inner left forearm, part of a dragon curling on his right. The intricate drawings stand out, black on his skin, stalks and scaly tail alike curling over the bones on his sleek wrists. Both disappear under his sleeves and again I want to know what else’s under there. More flowers; the rest of the dragon, I think. Probably climbing up his arm, its wing unfurling on his back? I keep imagining it differently every time. Maybe his whole back is covered by the wing, thin membranes going down his spine. I see it arching back, moving, under my hands. The thought doesn’t even scare me anymore. Now it just is.
Merlin, he looks so shy but there’s that defiance in there too, that says he’s going to do it. I whirl him around, my chest to his back, my hands setting on his arms to steady him. I close my eyes.
His fingers closed around the collar Josh handed him. Plain black leather, with a steel O ring in the center, a buckle for the back, and a simple leash with a handle. It was a collar for plays, nothing special about it. Not like the one Draco had at home. He’d bought it years ago, but never used it on anyone. It was made of silver and steel. And it had an emerald green stone at the back. It sat in its beautiful velvety box, waiting. Waiting.
Our kiss is a thing of desperation. Slow. Liquid. I get drunk again on the wine on his tongue, and he grinds against me, his nails scraping my jacket. We never use magic. Our urgency translates better when he undresses me with trembling hands, when my fingers struggle to unbutton his shirts, when he palms me through my trousers. He does it now.
I know the name. It’s right there, under my tongue, but it’s so heavy, impossible, I can't say it. I'm shaking. I'm shaking so badly the ground is shattering, the dark is shattering. His face is haunted. Blurred.
I’m feeling so vulnerable right now. I try to remove my hand, but his fingers hang on tighter. And it feels good. All this touching, in broad daylight, it’s so different from everything we’ve done before.
He moved his hand to his crotch, fingers over the buttons of his trousers. Harry made to move closer. Draco let out a chuckle. Slowly, he crossed his legs.
He’s so close I can see the veins under his tattoos, green, blue, something in between. I feel him watching me closely.
Harry thought he’d imagined it, but Draco said it again, as the tip of his cock breached his hole. Harry’s whole body tensed at the intrusion, sweat breaking on his temple, and he forced himself to relax around the cock he wanted so badly inside him. He breathed in deeply, concentrating on the feeling of Draco’s fingers running up and down his leg, soothing him. So gentle… Harry looked at Draco, searching his eyes. Draco seemed about to ask something but Harry stopped him.
He takes a deep drag of his cigarette and glances at you briefly. He looks intangible and so real at the same time. There’s no reason at all for you to feel this comfortable around him. No matter what Hermione says, the truth is you don’t know him. Not really. You cross paths at the Ministry, on the usual pub night and on formal occasions like this and none of you does more than acknowledge the other with a nod. But in all those times, there’s something about his silence that comforts you. It makes you feel like you don’t have to pretend.
He takes out another cigarette from a silver case. You wait for him to light it, but instead he holds it in front of you. Before you can think it over, you’re leaning forward, your lips closing around the tip. His fingers twist again, you inhale, the other end of the cigarette alights. You nearly shiver. The smoke exits your nostrils and you try not to cough. You rarely ever smoke.
You didn’t mean to. You really didn’t. But the sight of him like this makes you want to do things. Your hand is on his collar and you pull him closer, kissing him. You pull back just as fast. He gazes back at you, his lips wet, his expression a little dazed.
Draco tugged sharply at the leash and Harry choked for an instant, spit dripping down his jaw, but his throat kept working around Josh’s cock.
‘If I want to,’ Draco repeated, tasting the words on his mouth. Tasting the possibility. ‘Do you have any idea how you make me feel?’
He gets up, turns his back on me and walks away. I wait. I start the count to a hundred. I tell myself I need to wait. But I’m only on fifty when I get up and follow him.
‘Know it was him? You wouldn’t look him in the eye- you always look people in the eye, whatever their opinions of you.’
And in that pause, in that space where he says nothing at all, I hear it. Everything he’s not saying for fear of scaring me away. And it probably would, so I’m glad he doesn’t say it.
He lets his shirt drop on a chair. He sits, unties his shoes, takes off his socks, his trousers and his pants. He’s intent, unashamed.
He picks up his wand from the desk, puts on his jacket, then his gloves, ready to leave. He has no plans for the night. No one is waiting for him.
He looks right at me. I can see that he doesn’t give a single fuck. He stopped caring after the War. It shouldn’t be so hot, but it is. Because I’m the exception. All those blokes can throw themselves at his feet. He’ll turn them all down for another taste of me. And he’s had me before. He’s had me plenty.
I did everything you asked me too, and still you fucking broke up with me. I kept away, like you asked.’
Draco willed his face to look expressionless. He did not want Josh to see how much this information affected him. Deeply. It might be kind of
‘You’re always so quiet. I never know what’s on your mind,’ Potter says. ‘And I want to. I so want to. Is that your way of saying yes? Please tell me it is.’
Draco grabbed his hair in a tight grip and then he bit so hard at his neck that Harry stopped seeing, he was almost fainting and Draco grunted and came inside him, drilling into him, Harry’s hole clenching hard around his cock, seemingly trying to suck Draco in. His body was pliable and abused and drunk on pain and pleasure, and his hole was dripping with Draco’s come, hot and wet.
‘No,’ he said. And the cane twisted over his nipple. Through the haze of it, Harry saw Draco dropping to his knees, laying the cane on the floor and looking up.
‘Do you have him hiding upstairs? Afraid of the crazy ex-fuck? Ex-lover? Can’t quite decide on the best term here, any suggestions?’
I feel it again. This feeling I’ve been fighting all through the last week. My heart clenches. Tonight is our last night together. The last night I get to sleep with him. We both made a point of not talking about what happens after tonight. But now it’s here, open trunks, scattered belongings, and my boyfriend has dyed his hair blue. Or turquoise, whatever that is.
‘Fuck. You’re gorgeous,’ Draco could not keep the words from spilling out, nor could he keep his hands away from Harry now that he was touching him. His finger curled around the O-ring and he pulled Harry down on his cock.
He’s wearing black eyeliner and it makes the grey in his eyes even more grey. They drift from my eyes, to my mouth, then slowly back up.
‘Josh,’ he said, knowing his face looked impassive. He felt grateful for how easily the mask fell in place. He supposed he could count that as the most valuable skill he’d acquired during the War.
‘Dance with me,’ he says, his words gentle, like his mouth is going to be over my cock later tonight. It’s like I’ve known this Draco all my life. But I’m still unsure.
He heard Draco let out a long breath, his hand stilling over his thigh, warm. He forced himself to open his eyes.
All his scenes had always been so simple. One-time only, uncomplicated, no feelings beyond a hard-on and a good time. His rules were crystal clear: there would be no dating afterwards and no repeat performances. When aftercare was done, so was Draco. Some of them had wanted more, of course. But he’d never returned the feelings. For him, there was nothing romantic about any of it.
‘I don’t think there’s anything he likes better than sucking cock,’ Josh said casually. ‘And he’s quite good at it. Dedicated.’
‘Has it occurred to you that he- oh no, don’t interrupt me, Draco. I have been keeping up with your pining for years, so you’re going to listen to me now.’
He crosses the room. I think he’s about to tell me he’s leaving, but instead he sits on the bed beside me. He stares at his hands. I notice that one of his nails is broken, a trace of dark red blood on the tip of his finger. The bath wasn’t enough to make it go away. No bath is ever going to be enough, I realise.
The three of them walked to the end of the room. Josh paused at the reception desk to lift a key. Draco held the leash in his hand, and didn’t look once at Harry, trailing obediently behind him, naked but for the collar. He knew every eye in that club was on Harry, on his naked body, on his perfect posture, his perfect ruddy cock. Well, too bad they weren’t going to have him. Or it.
‘You want me to show you how much I want you?’ his hand cups my face. I never had the chance to look into his eyes like this, without clothes being pulled off and cocks almost leaking. I’m hard, he’s hard, but it’s something on the background, underlying what’s really happening, which is: him, looking at me. Saying something important. He looks solemn.
He looks at me and I have this perfect vision of the man I want to wake up to every fucking day of my life. I don’t know how to tell him that. At this thought, I realise the hungover potion just finished its job. I’m sober. And scared.
‘See? That wasn’t so hard, was it?’ Josh teased again. He was giving Harry all the gentle pushes towards Draco, clearing the path for the inevitable. ‘Can’t say the same thing about your cock, though.’
He works by the light on the tip of his wand. He finds the office lights too bright, they give him headaches. He finishes his paperwork, files the reports, cleans his desk. Everything in its place, as it should be. The sight of orderly things grounds him. Assures him the sun will rise again in the morning.
‘Draco… I want…’ he was babbling. What if this never happened again? What if he never got Draco again? He couldn’t bear the thought. His heart was hammering inside him.
‘One word from you…’ he says, warm fingers circling my wrist. ‘I’ll drop him right this second. You know I will.’
Of course he does. He never makes this easier. No matter how much I need it to be casual, it never is. I look into his eyes. The pull of his gravity, it wins over everything. Even self-preservation. I can lie all I want with my words, but my body speaks the truth & if there’s something Potter can read is my body, every shift, every sigh, every fucking weakness. His hand drags over my hips. His fingers curl on the hoops of my trousers. I know what’s coming. We’re pressed chest to chest, we’re both slowly getting hard. His mouth is right there, lips parted. They move softly over my cheek, then closer & closer to where I want them. He places a kiss, open mouthed, right at the corner of my lips. It’s absurd, the effect it has over me. My mouth chases his, my hands are shaking, he laughs, evading my tentative kiss. He loves to drive me mad with it. Toying with my desire for him, making me burn in a slow deep fire. He drags his mouth over my jaw, biting lightly. I’ve seen him kiss man after man at the damned club. But not me, no. After that first time, he only kisses me when I’m so crazy with it that I’m crying out his name, begging him. Begging for anything.
sleeping. I expected him to be discreet, waking up early so that no one would spot him leaving my room. But he goes about it so naturally, like we’ve been doing this for years, like he’s got nothing to hide. We usually come out of the room together.
I stare at them and still I have no words. As we’re walking together to the Great Hall, Hermione leans close to me and whispers:
Malfoy was reaching even deeper inside him, touching secret thoughts he had pressed down. Harry wanted to relinquish all control, that was why he loved this, submitting to men. But this was
You’re watching his hands as you say this. They twist on his lap, the silver case falling on the couch. It’s the first time he’s sitting so close to you and you’re not fucking. You don’t even know what to do with your own hands.
It was like any other night at the club. Josh had been having fun torturing Harry’s nipples, for almost half an hour, the clamps shining brightly against Harry’s chest, sweat trickling down his skin, making Draco want to lean in and slowly lick those beads of sweat. He remembered Harry’s taste, his scent. He craved it.
He caught the words but took longer to catch their meaning. It seemed different from any praise he’d had. This was Malfoy, calling him good and beautiful. This was his ex-childhood nemesis, holding him like a lover, taking him down to an underworld of pain and shameless pleasure and he had never known he wanted this so much. His body was throbbing in every point of connection with Malfoy’s. He realised just then that Malfoy was still hard too. He pressed back into Malfoy and this time Malfoy let him. They stood like that for some time, Harry feeling the pressure from Malfoy’s cock against his arse. He wished that Malfoy was naked, that he could feel his cock properly, his whole body, that he would be allowed to touch.
His question turned the tables again. Harry groaned inside his mouth, and even though there was nothing shy about the way he snapped his hips forward, he was submitting again, his mouth open under Draco’s, his legs shaking, barely keeping him kneeling, his cock rubbing against Draco’s. His hands clenched over Draco’s arse.
He steps out of the bathroom wearing my clothes. The sweater hangs loose around his narrow shoulders, but the pants seem to fit. He seems weary, exhausted, like he’s lived years in just a couple of hours. His hair is still wet from the bath. There are dark circles under his eyes. But what gets me are the bruises. He has a cut on his nose and on his upper lip. It will probably be swollen tomorrow. There’s a dark-purple bruise on his jaw. And more on his neck, finger-shaped, like someone held him down, suffocating him.
out of mutual admiration or infatuation. I have no idea what we’re doing this out for. Lust. Masochism. Self-deprecation. Three gods on the altar of my self-destruction.
The problem wasn’t that he knew how Harry Potter looked when he was tied up, helpless, teased to the point of desperation. Nor was it that he knew how he begged for more when he had a cock up his arse, how beautiful he was when he took it all in. Even if he looked like Draco’s every fantasy come true, only even better.
Dear readers, this chapter was very hard to write. It’s one of the heaviest things I’ve wrote. It’s also a very triggering scene, so please check the end notes for content warning and/or notice the tags I added. Take care and keep safe*
‘You couldn’t possibly give me any pleasure.’ She says accordingly. Her mouth is all disdain when she adds, ‘I'm not here to make chit-chat.’
They stared at each other for some time. Draco felt he was spinning downwards, losing ground, looking through a kaleidoscopic vision of his own life up until now. It all looked so grey - up until Harry came into view.
Content warning: mentions of eating disorder, depression and rape aftermath. All of these are made in the context of a supportive conversation.
‘You always look so tense… you know… at work,’ Harry said, his eyes intent on Draco’s cock, but still he didn't move to touch it. He licked his lips instead.
‘He does have quite the standards,’ Josh said teasingly. He was leaning back on the chair, watching them in amusement. Already he was a willing spectator, leaving the center stage to Draco.
Plaintive. So fucking sweet. Breaking around the edges in a whimper that Draco knew only meant Harry wanted more.
There’s a second of silence where I let myself panic. But I didn’t dye my hair pink for nothing. It’s a bold statement. Like what I just said. My hand climbs an inch up his leg.
He sobbed when Malfoy removed them, but then he felt Malfoy’s breath on his skin. He let out a cry when he realised Malfoy had dropped to his knees behind him. Malfoy’s tongue was on his feverish skin, licking over his arse. Then teeth sank on the flesh. His arse was so sensitive that the pain was intense and still he pushed into Malfoy’s mouth, feeling his tongue lash over his skin, wetness and heat spreading all over. His arms shook on the restraints as Malfoy bit into his skin, hands coming up to Harry’s thighs, soothing him as his mouth viciously robbed Harry of any thought. Harry couldn’t fight it anymore, he was screaming, as Malfoy’s mouth alternated between licking, kissing, biting so fast that he couldn’t keep up with it. He was about to lose it. Malfoy’s mouth found his crease, licked a path down towards Harry’s bollocks and the renting yell that went through him made his ears ring. A bright light flashed in front of his eyes.
‘Is that why you made me beg for it? ‘Cause it’s overrated?’ Harry traced the inner side of his shirt’s collar with his fingers. It was distracting.
In the semi-darkness, I get dressed. Jeans, sweater, trainers. I never got around to using the proper uniform again, and no one told me off. No one tells me off anymore. I grab my pack of cigarettes from where I’ve hidden it, under a pile of socks in the drawer, tuck my wand in my back pocket and leave silently. I know she’ll sleep through it. ‘Till morning.
There was nothing slow about their kiss, nothing submissive about Harry’s mouth this time over, and it was exactly what Draco wanted. Harry was soft and hard, his tongue inside Draco’s mouth like it belonged there, nowhere else. His hands caught on Draco’s arms, shaking badly, not daring to move elsewhere. Draco stopped the kiss, shutting down Harry’s protest when his hands took Harry’s to place them around him, down his back, over his arse. There was a pause, none of them moving, Harry’s hands just there, feeling him, Draco’s fingers still on Harry’s hair.
The lights shifted and caught Draco’s side of the room. And that was when Harry saw him. Just a mere glimpse, but it was enough.
I can see his profile under the dim light of my wand. He’s sitting on the ground, back to the castle’s walls, arms around his knees. A mess of black hair, ratted trainers and jeans. He looks tired, but he also looks...
I let him do the talk at the reception. The soft tones of his voice reach me and my body responds. I’m alive, breathing, for the first time in weeks. It’s our usual Muggle hotel. In here, they only see us for what we really are. Two men wanting to spend the night together. He has the key in his hand, and my eyes linger on it, on his fingers around the metal, as we go into the elevator. The doors close on us. It’s the first moment of privacy in months.
I feel loose, lost to the music, green eyes on every fucking inch of my body. I catch him looking at my tattoos and lift my arms to brush my hair back. He follows the movement. My heart beats to the rhythm, an invisible line drawn between me and him, the world beating loud around us.
Anyone walking past could see you now. On your knees, stuffed full with him. The thought makes you harder than it should. You’re dizzy and thirsty and there’s an ache in your chest that hurts you deeper when his hand brushes your cheek and stays there. His eyes are downcast, impossible to read.
And doesn’t that hurt like a fucking hex to the heart. I lean back, still twirling his favourite drink in my hand. I like the memories it brings better than its actual taste.
‘He told you,’ he said. His voice sounded detached, mainly to put some distance between himself and the staccato rhythm of his heart.
‘I want you to watch me while I fuck you open. You’re not allowed to move or come. Or kiss me,’ Malfoy looked up at him. His smile was cruel and Harry revelled in it, his whole body coming awake again, like he’d been jolted back to life.
He’d gone through the negotiation with Josh entertaining the thought that he could have Harry, knowing in the end Potter would refuse it. But then, something else he hadn’t counted on had happened: Josh had allowed him to break one of his rules.
I’m in so deep that I barely notice that he’s stopping, turning me around, coming up above me. He looks like a fucking god. A debauched, gorgeous, gay god, swollen mouth & wet lips, a teasing smile under dark green eyes. A hard cock nudging against my hip. He leans over me. His breath tastes of me.
‘To be honest,’ he says, sounding casual. ‘I always thought of you fucking me.’ He pauses, then adds. ‘Hard.’
He looks at me. There’s an ease in the way he leans in closer. He hasn’t said yes. His lips press closed against mine.
I grip his hand and pull him up, my arm around his waist. His whole body leans into mine, scared and willing all at the same time.
‘I can never reach you unless I’m injured and begging you to touch me,’ he says in the silence that follows. ‘You fuck me when I’m out of my mind with pain. I fuck you when you’re numb with drinking. I want more than that.’
‘You're going to behave for me, aren't you Harry?’ he said, voice strained. His fingers trailed over his still covered shaft. It was like submitting himself to torture. ‘Get your arse filled up for me. Like that.’
Potter laughs even harder. Draco can’t breathe. The lights flicker and sway before him. Nothing feels real, and yet that laugh feels more real than life itself.
‘Me and Ginny, we’ve been over for a year.’ He takes a deep breath. I keep my expression impassive. ‘We were still... Sleeping together. But that’s over now. Months ago- before. You know- before we-’
After that, you don’t see him for three weeks. You might have thought it’s because you didn’t cross paths, but you’re pretty sure he’s been avoiding you.
That’s how I find out the truth, after weeks on high alert, obsessing over it. It feels like sixth year all over again. Only this time I have even less to go on than I did at the time. I can’t ask him again, point blank, who did it. But I need to find out who hurt him and make sure that the bastard will never do it again. Not to him, not to anyone.
After almost three months of staring at him, it’s like I’m seeing him for the first time. Maybe because now I can’t ignore that he’s seeing me too.
‘You drive me mad,’ he whispered, and it was like a confession, really, meant only for Harry’s ears.
‘I did it.’ I say, savagely. My stomach clenches, something is burning through it, ripping me apart. ‘I’m the only one to blame.’
‘Josh is going to fuck you nice and good, just the way he knows you like,’ his voice came out soft, tender.
Harry kissed him harder, his hands coming up between them. He opened Draco’s shirt’s buttons, hands venturing beneath Draco’s clothes, untucking his shirt, searching. Somehow they managed to stand up and kissed, bodies crashing and trembling.
He waited for Malfoy’s mock laugh at his stupid infatuation. But Malfoy wasn’t laughing. If anything, he looked mesmerized. He hadn’t been expecting this. His eyes were a deeper shade of grey. His smirk was turning into something else, a slow smile, one Harry had never seen on him and had no idea what it meant. He was even more beautiful like this.
My hand is shaking badly. I force it to stop, nausea rising up my throat. I take a deep breath. He’s stronger than me. He has my wand. And he also has another substantial advantage in all of this: he’s not a Malfoy. His father is not locked up in Azkaban, with a life sentence. He’s not a traitor. His word will beat mine any day. I know what I have to do.
agrees with your “orgasms are overrated” theory,’ Harry said softly and Draco kissed the cheeky smile off his face.
Draco closed his fingers over the buckle, feeling the cold metal against his skin. His whole body felt on fire, except for that point of contact.
Three hours and ten shots of Firewhisky later, I was taking my time alright. Namely, by sucking Harry Potter’s cock, in a rather dreary & dirty bathroom stall, with no thought to spare for Andrew, expensive diamond rings or the world at large.
Somehow those different times collapse into this one. There’s a tug of fire in my chest, a tug of war in my heart.
Our lips part. He’s everything I knew he would be. He rests his head against mine, panting slightly. We’re both fully dressed yet, but I never felt this close to anyone. We breathe each other’s breaths. He has a question, his hand hovering close, but not touching.
. You look quickly around you to find a mix of sophistication and comfort. Sofas, chairs, bookshelves, everything in its place.
The cold night air is blissful. The buzz of voices fades behind the closing doors. The quiet and dark suits you better of late. It’s something you seem to have in common with him.
I run the tip of my finger over his wet lips. He’s trembling, his magic going haywire. He looks at me like I’m a dream.
No one else notices any of it. Hermione and Ron are already taking their seats beside Draco. His pale face shows nothing at all as he makes an almost imperceptive movement with his wand to clean the mess away. Cool, impassive.
Have I mentioned that a bookish Draco makes me happy? Also, Ron and Hermione are here! Tell me what you think :)
We stay silent. I don’t tell him about my coping mechanisms for those weeks. Maybe one day I will, but not right now. Instead I shift my gaze to his newest scar.
‘Three sugars, right?’ he asks, but he’s already adding them to my tea and stirring. I’m amazed at the fact that this man knows how I take my tea, when I thought he only knew how I liked my cock sucked. I wonder what else he knows.
Harry was trapped under Draco’s body and it felt like heaven and hell all wrapped into one. He lifted his hips up, Draco’s cock sliding deeper inside.
You don’t know if they heard you, but you’re already walking to the glass doors, your feet taking you there.
My nails scratch the stone. There’s only pain and his hard breath, his hands all over me, he’s going to- he’s going to- I elbow him as hard as I can, I don’t even see where it lands. He grunts, releases me for a second, I turn frantically, my hands grabbing the nearest chair. I throw it against him, run for my wand, grab it from the floor, scramble for the door, swing it open.
Josh pulled Harry up, the muscles on his legs shifting with the movement. Draco remembered those legs wrapped tightly around him. There was a path of dark, soft hair on his thighs. He also remembered touching Harry there. It had felt strangely intimate. He usually touched his subs with instruments. He’d surprised himself when his hands had gone for Harry’s thighs like that, with no other intent than teasing. Even if he didn’t know in the end who exactly was being teased. Potter never had made things simple for him.
‘And here I thought I had seen it all this night,’ she says, her eyes going from his hand to me and back again.
You can’t keep down a nervous laugh. He’s easily the most beautiful man you’ve ever been with. But that’s not what’s making you feel this way.
‘It’d be a torture if I didn’t touch you…’ he whispered, placing a barely-there kiss over Harry’s jaw that had the desired effect of making Harry search his mouth for more only to find nothing.
I have every intention of keeping my mouth shut. He seems intent on the same thing. All he does is watch me and consume those Muggle lethal things.
‘Has it crossed your rather intoxicated, self-deprecating mind that he, in his own twisted way, might be feeling the same?’
You don’t think about what it all implies. You don’t think at all when his fingers close on your wrist. His hand is warm. It takes you by surprise.
‘It’s all just a game to you.’ I mutter. I never meant to say that & for a moment I think he didn’t catch it, the music way too loud, pressing up around us. But he is close, gaze right on my lips. Something bright flashes in his eyes. I can’t read him. He glances at the dance floor, where anonymous bodies move under the flashing lights.
‘Squeeze my hand back,’ Malfoy asked and he did. Malfoy checked on his other hand. This carefulness was about to make him break.
When I open my eyes, she’s the first thing I see. There’s a streak of white light that crosses over her face. It flashes once, twice, in tandem with the storm outside. Her red hair spills over my pillow. She sleeps naked under my sheets. Even though we’re no longer dating. No longer together. No longer
‘He’s the only one I had for years.’ There’s some kind of emotion in the way she says it. It’s fleeting, but there. I realise I’m probably taking a peak at the person Hermione fell for. The illusion takes no time fading away. Parkinson presses her lips together.
Malfoy stopped, Harry tried to breathe, deep and slow, but a sob came up his throat instead. He felt like crying from too many things at once. Like Malfoy’s hand caressing his arse, soft, accessing the bruises probably. Why did they feel so good? The cane brushed teasingly over his arse cheeks, then between them.
There’s a fundraiser in downtown London, nothing fancy, but you’ve never been this bored in your life. The muscles on your face hurt from all the smiling, but you thank Merlin for the flow of drinks, empty glasses being easily exchanged for full ones.
Harry bent his head down, the collar tight on his throat, the leash stretched in a long line of tension between his neck and Draco’s holding hand. His lips parted.
I drop down beside him, too close. I might as well be sitting on his lap since I’m being so obvious, but he doesn’t seem to notice. He looks at my Dark Mark, the white scarring visible under the tattoos. I feel like he’s the only one who has the right to look at it so intently, so I let him. I imagine his fingers trailing over my inner arm, gentle, then his hands gripping my wrists, pressing them against the mattress. The picture is so strong I have to force myself to speak to make it go away.
You turn to leave, but something else catches your eye. Down the street, the light of the full moon catches on a familiar white strand of hair. He’s leaning against a wall, a cigarette dangling from his lips. For a terrible second you think he’s with someone else. But then his head turns and he sees you. He’s alone.
Draco stopped the kiss and stepped back, his breath uneven, his clothes in disarray, his body heated. Harry’s face was wet, his hands curled into fists, his arms trembling. He looked ready to endure anything at all. Draco took a step towards him.
I hope you had a wonderful time reading this story. Thank you for all the comments and support of my writing :) Take care*
Believe me, you don’t want to be on the other side of the look she’s just given me. And this is coming from someone who’s been eye to eye with Voldemort. She sets the money on the counter.
It was a small mercy that Potter wore glasses - at least, outside of this damned club. Namely at work, where Draco got to cross paths with him more times than was healthy for him. Draco was especially grateful for the lenses working as a sort of filter. One could pretend those eyes weren’t so deeply green, one could downplay the sheer intensity of them, especially when they were so intent on you,
‘Ran out of new boys to fuck?’ My tone is mild. I’m surprised at how cool and composed I sound after all these weeks of losing my shit.
Even through the haze on his mind, Harry could sense that there was something Draco wasn’t telling him.
‘Yes, yes, yes,’ he was sobbing, going down, deep, with that voice telling him he wasn’t alone in what he was feeling. Malfoy was there, with him, on the other side of this, high up, pushing him down where he belonged and Harry wanted to be there, to be small, unimportant, to give himself up in Malfoy’s hands, to be nothing but a recipient for pain.
‘I would,’ Harry said. Draco didn’t know what he was talking about - his loud thoughts or his previous provocation, but he didn’t fucking care.
‘Spell damage. Auror related injuries. I don’t know the specifics, but the last one had Hermione sleeping over at the hospital. He’s out of danger now, back to work. But that’s what got me thinking, because he was acting out and you were here, like you’re back on house arrest, but instead you’re probably just avoiding him-’
Draco lifted his fingers to Harry’s lips. The first touch was slow and silent. Josh stopped moving, still inside Harry, his eyes on the both of them. The tip of Draco’s index finger traced Harry’s lower lip, mapping it. Harry wasn’t breathing and Draco felt his heart beating on the tip of his finger. Another finger joined the first one. Harry let his lips part, his body jerking forward.
I yank my eyes from the sugar bowl and turn to face him. He’s at the kitchen door, dressed in a pair of pyjamas. I notice they’re green and he looks so good in green. I don’t know what the hell I’m doing. My hands grip a wooden chair. It helps steady me.
Potter looks… I have no idea how he looks because I never saw him looking like this. Maybe it’s the daylight. Or the fact that we’re having tea instead of Firewhisky. I have no field guide for what’s happening here.
The single word rings in your head like a siren call. You didn’t know what you were expecting, but this was and was
I want to cry and scream and laugh, all at the same time. I realise there’s no one. There’s no one in his bed. There probably never was, not in all this time. Only me. I don’t even know what that makes me feel, so I keep talking.
pleading. ‘When you come home from work, I want to be kneeling right there at the door, waiting for you.’
Harry groaned, the sound half-frustration, half-arousal shooting through Draco, driving him to capture Josh’s mouth with his.
Even as you say it, you realise how much it hurts you. For a while, there’s only silence and the clock on your wall ticking down the seconds. He’s looking at an empty spot on the wall when he answers.
And finally, @chibaken. This story is for you. Your passion for this story got me back to writing it. The fact that you made a rec of it on your Tumblr brought me so many new readers. Since we're apparently drarry soulmates (as in my kink is your kink and your kink is my kink), I really hope you love the conclusion of this story. Million thanks for all your amazing comments and general sweetness.
It’s like he won’t fight me, or my words, or this stupid bloke that had his hands inside my pants an hour ago. Like he’s given up on whatever this is between us.
I hate his honesty. But I hate myself more for letting myself slip every time. I close my eyes. It’s the only way I can pretend he’s not looking at me like he is now. Like he knows me inside & out.
I turn back to look at Potter. Our eyes meet. Lights flash, rainbows between us. I’ve known him all my life and it’s like I can’t stop noticing the little changes in him. He’s thinner; it shows on his face, under his recently grown beard. The beard fits him, goes well with his careless, worn-out hero look. He still carries the weight of the world on his shoulders. It’s in the way he leans against the counter, slumped, lost; it’s also in the fact that he’s on his seventh drink. I counted them. I also count how many times he avoids anyone wanting to chat him up. So far, three blokes, one girl. He’s not into people. Not into
‘So… monogamy?’ My eyebrows rise. I’m still smiling, though, and seemingly unable to stop. ‘Your fans will be deeply disappointed. Not to mention the press-’
like that. They called him many things. But his name on Malfoy’s lips was like a drug. It felt all kinds of wrong and right.
You’re already warm and clean, in a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt, searching the house like mad for a flask of sleeping potion when the doorbell rings.
You fall asleep again and you’re awaken by the sound of him paddling to your bathroom. It’s the simplicity of it, the weird familiarity of it that shakes you. You close your eyes. It’s right there, behind your eyelids. You allow it to wash over you. The second you say it in your head, you know it’s the truth.
Harry kissed him again. They were becoming ever better at it. At slowing down when their breaths were uneven, at teasing each other with bites and little kisses that turned to filthy ones, at panting for each other, at letting their bodies find the ways they fitted best, which really wasn’t all that difficult. Harry fitted with him in a way he couldn’t quite believe. Draco’s cock had started to wilt, but he was getting hard again with the sounds Harry kept making in his ear.
I still have nightmares, though. Sometimes they’re even worse than before, like the less I think about it during the day, the more it all comes back to assault me at night. When I wake up he’s there. Sometimes he just helps me to calm my breathing down. Other times he touches me, his hands on my face, like that first night. His hands are warm. All of my spiralling thoughts stop at the sight of his eyes, solemn, on me. And even when I can’t go back to sleep afterwards, I listen to him breathing, feel him there, close enough that my fingers could brush the sleeve of his pyjamas. It’s reassuring in a way I can’t explain. I want to tell Mirna about this, but I don’t know where to start. How can I explain to her that we have all this fucked up history, that he was a bully, that he was horrible to my friends, that he once broke my nose, that I almost bled him to death in a bathroom. That I regret that more than anything else. How can I tell her that I don’t think he had a choice in the War, that he was a pawn, just like me,
Draco stood up, his cock hard still, but he ignored it. With a wave of his hand he accioed the leash back, hung it on the collar, and tugged Harry up, so that he was kneeling on the bed, trembling, Josh’s come easing out of his arse, dripping down his legs.
Again I think he could at least have gone to the trouble of showering before meeting me. He always smells of sweat. I guess he takes great pride in being a Beater for the Ravenclaw Quidditch team. Too proud to care for the fact that he stinks. He’s tall, all muscle, his hair a light brown, his eyes blue — one of his best assets, if not the best. He’s always surrounded by girls. Unfortunately for them, he prefers dicks. I guess you could say he’s hot, if you like the type. Beaters were never really my thing, but he’ll do for now. At least, he doesn’t seem to have a problem with my last name, which is rare enough these days.
‘Fuck my mouth, please. I wa-’ sweat broke on his temple, as Josh kept sinking into him. Draco watched the tension on Harry’s throat, under the collar. His hand was moving over his cock and ghosting over Harry’s with slow purpose, making Harry whimper and beg.
‘Save me the bulshit, Draco. I’ve known you since you were 3 years old. This is Potter we're talking about. You’re in love with him.’
A rush of blood to his cock, his arms, his chest. Trust Potter to say the most pathetic thing right in the middle of a play. Trust Draco to feel on fire just from it.
They went up the stairs to the private rooms. Josh had gotten them one of the bigger, more comfortable ones. Perks of being a regular customer, Draco mused. He seldom used the rooms these clubs offered, for he was a shameless exhibitionist. But last time with Harry he had forgotten all about the show. Time had completely lost its meaning, the world narrowing down to the point of contact between them. He wanted all that and more.
, certain as all the other certain things in the world. Like the sun rising tomorrow; like time passing; like the fact that we’re all going to die in the end. Even those of us who have died before & came back to save the world, yes, even him, one day, he is going to die and, if I don’t die first, I will be in love with him up until then.
Draco leaned in closer, his breath hitching on Harry’s neck and Harry tilted his head, offering his neck.
Hovering, right in his line of sight. Golden-white. He lifts his wand up, stares at it. Waits for it to disappear. It’s probably just a haywire trace of magic left behind. It happens sometimes.
to be caught in the act of looking. He wanted to be found guilty of the crime, wanted those green eyes to look away from Josh and find him there, pinning him to that couch so he was unable to leave.
I barely have time to take in his admission. His hand covers mine and drags it up to his thigh. He looks up at me. Every doubt leaves my mind. We’re so close I could kiss him, but I want him to do it. He has to want it like I do.
‘Harry… You both look so hot. I’m going to enjoy this so much,’ he felt the swell of Josh’s cock against his arse. His lips brushed over Harry’s cheek in a soft kiss. ‘Also… I let him take charge of your orgasm. You’ll come at his command,’ Josh added as an afterthought.
But when you look at him, he just looks scared. He’s afraid of what you might say, like you’re the wild card for him, not the other way around. It makes you hope.
‘Oh fuck,’ Harry tensed up, the words almost making him come on the spot. But he knew he would take it, he knew it. He would, because Draco was everything on his mind, on his body, on his heart.
This time, when you close the doors behind you, he turns to look back. He does a quick swipe of you, his face saying nothing. You have the distinct feeling he was waiting for exactly this.
Draco realises, belatedly, he is nodding at Potter, but he doesn’t know what he’s agreeing to. Potter cracks a smile.
He raises his hand and brushes his hair back, but the blond strand falls into place again. The ring on his finger catches the rainbow lights from above. His fingernails are painted black. It suits him. He slants me another look. Night after night, this is what we do.
I know he’s talking about what I just told him, but it seems like he means more. He does mean more. He means the War. He means everything. The tip of his finger brushes against my cheek. Gentle, the most intimate thing.
Draco crosses his arms. That he could be part of anything Potter plans is quite beyond him. He awaits for whatever madness overtook Potter to be over, so he can go home.
Harry had never been kissed like that, like he was about to die and Draco was a lifeline. But he wasn’t the only one. Draco looked lost in it too, his hands tugging at Harry’s hair, and face and neck, too intimate, too close, too… lovingly. Harry tangled his hands on the blond hair, marvelling at how soft it was, his fingers rubbing against Draco’s scalp.
Draco is making some new choices. And a new list :) Tell me what you thought of this one! Thank you for supporting this story.
‘Harry…’ Malfoy was smiling. Harry was sure of this for he felt it in his tone, low, ghosting over his neck. He was smirking, in that poshy way of his. Once that had made hate stir inside Harry. Now, something else entirely was stirring there.
Oh he did. He fucking did. Harry glanced at Josh. Draco noticed how he looked Josh straight in the eye, but when he turned back to Draco his eyes kept level with Draco’s crotch. Lovely. So Harry knew who was in charge.
‘I made you beg for a kiss too, didn’t I?’ Draco captured Harry’s lower lip with his teeth and bit down on it slowly. Harry moaned.
‘No, please, I don’t want it to be over, I can take it, please… I’ll be good, I’ll be so good for you Malfoy… please, let me show you.’
‘Baby,’ he whispers. And then his hands cup me and I’m in heaven, so desperate that I take too much time noticing what he’s actually doing.
Draco wasn’t thinking clearly as he fell to his knees in front of Harry, and then his tongue traced over the come on Harry’s face. Harry gasped, his hands shooting up to grab Draco’s arms, his body melting against Draco and Draco kept at it, licking his jaw, his lips. He held the come inside his mouth and leant closer to Harry, pulling him by the collar. Harry opened his mouth, pliantly. Draco’s lips brushed his and he let his mouth fall open too, his heart beating loud on his throat. The come dripped from his mouth into Harry’s.
He kisses the other side of your neck and you melt, your hands drop down to his arse, it’s perfect, Malfoy is so gorgeous, in fact, he’s the most gorgeous man you ever made out with, because that’s what you’re both doing. Making out. On his living room. It’s the slow build-up of it all that surprises you the most. He’s taking his time with you, he isn’t in a rush to remove more of your clothes even if you’re slowly starting to feel trapped inside your trousers.
At some point during that night, you manage to have some actual fun. Everyone ends up drinking way too much, but you keep to two beers. You’d rather be sober, just in case… Guernsey is in the middle of recounting a joke involving Kingsley and although you’ve listened to it three times already, it never ceases to make you laugh. You turn around, to see if he’s finding it funny too. But he’s gone, nowhere to be seen.
‘I left him there because I can’t stop thinking about you,’ I say. My voice is almost light, easy. I want to break his fucking sugar bowl again. Or his heart. I grip it harder, the bowl shakes in my hands. ‘And I’ve already had you. Several times. Maybe he’s a fantastic fuck, maybe he would make me forget you, maybe I could stop missing you, but yet here I am.’
‘Imagine what the Headmistress would say,’ his voice is almost soft, but dead cold. ‘A Death Eater hexing one of the students out of duelling class... You’d be out of here in a heartbeat- and you can’t afford that, can you?’ His smile broadens. ‘You have to behave. Everyone knows your family is ruined.’
Harry loved to wait there while the men discussed him. The idea of men appraising him, deciding what they wanted to do to him, while he had minimum say in it, made him feel completely free.
I’ve got these dinners down to an art. I smile, I nod, I even talk in the right places, but all the time I’m only aware of him. When he speaks. When he stays silent. His legs crossed under the table. His cuffs brushing mine. I know he’s on his third glass. But once I stare at his hands, I slide further down the spiral. He’s the only one who can release me.
He kicks my wand away, it rolls further to the side. I can’t reach it without getting past him. He tilts his head, admiring the spectacle I make with my robes ripped, my neck probably marked by him. I fight the urge to cover myself. His eyes zero in on my mouth.
This is our first kiss. His lips on my lips, a barely there touch that makes me burn so very slowly. He doesn’t pull me any closer. I think he’s afraid of scaring me away. Unsure of how I’ll react. I reach for his hands and drive them around me. They settle on the small of my back, mine climb up to his chest.
He smelled the leather first. Then he felt it, cold and thin, against his back. There was silence. The crop hit his arse with sharp precision. The pain took him away from the world. He was brought back by another smack on the same spot, acute on his heated skin. He was used to a quick session of cropping, before the dominant decided on another part of his body to torture. Nothing came for a while, he just felt his skin burning up, his ears straining to know where Malfoy was, his heartbeat loud.
‘Just ask.’ He speaks these words nearly into my mouth. He says them in that way that’s so very him: warm and like he couldn’t care less. And I love the fact that I’m the only one who knows just how much he cares.
I try to steady my voice, but it’s hard to do that when my face is up against a wall, my cheek scratched by the cold stone. I never realised how strong he is. I struggle to push him back, but he seems unmovable. I try to reach for my wand but it dawns on me that I left it lying on a desk when we walked into this classroom. Out of my reach.
I take a step towards him. His eyes rake my face. There’s a wall of warmth rising before me, his whole body barely an inch away. I feel his all-encompassing need to touch me, so I edge him on.
He had no clue what he was even begging for, but Malfoy’s tongue gave it to him. A cleaning spell tickled his hole, wandless magic, made discreetly, oh fuck, he was even harder now, Malfoy was really his type. The way he controlled a crop, a cane, a wand and blunt magic, and the way he handled Harry, the things he said, just right, just perfect, everything about him was a walking wet dream. Malfoy’s hands parted his arse cheeks and Harry’s hole clenched and unclenched under his stare.
The room was adequate, even if he’d be more comfortable in his own. He had a sudden vision of Harry spread over his bed, wearing only the collar - the silver one - his arms fastened to the bedposts. It didn’t seem impossible at all.
He touches me like I’m his fucking property, mouth dropping words into my ear, slow decadence. He tells me:
He lets the question linger, open-ended. It’s up for me to name what I want. What I have always wanted from him. With him.
Harry let his head fall back on Malfoy’s shoulder. How long had they been at it? He had a high pain threshold. Doms liked that in him. It wasn’t easy to break him, so most of them looked at it like a challenge. He wondered if Malfoy thought him challenging. If he was enjoying this. If he was pleased. Nothing seemed more important than that now.
‘Harry, be a good boy and tell us why I had to say no to three perfectly good blokes. I’m sure Draco wants to hear all about it.’
He badly wanted to come. He fucking needed the release. And he had wanted to be fucked out of his mind. He had wanted so many things, so many...
He couldn’t stop the smile on his face as Harry preened under his stare, and proceeded to suck gently on Josh’s bollocks. Josh’s pressed his hips up, his breathing clearly altered. Harry reached the hem of his pants and tugged at them with his teeth, careful and slow, pulling them down. It took three gentle pulls and Josh’s willingness lifting his hips and finally Josh’s cock jutted out, smacking Harry on the face. Harry looked from it to Draco, with a shy smile.
‘You know… he came up to us on the first day back. He actually apologized. For the bullying and for the things he did when he joined the Death Eaters. He said he was sorry about everything. He really meant it.’
Against his better judgement, he had found a couch in the shadows and had sat there, a glass of wine in his hand, an unimpeded view to the center of the room, where Josh had placed Harry, kneeling on the floor, hands bound behind him, lights playing on his naked body, illuminating half of his face and chest. A spot of light in darkness.
I have no idea how to respond to this. For a while, we don’t say a word. I let him hold me, my hand brushing slowly over his knee, my ear to his chest. I can hear his fast heartbeat. Nothing was ever easy to me, but he is. He knows me. Not some masked, collected version of me, but the real messy one. He sees it, the same way he sees the person I’m trying so hard to become.
I’m speechless for a moment, watching him casually opening up a cabinet, picking up two teacups and a teapot. He fills it with water, then points his wand at it. The water starts to boil.
The rest of what I meant to say vanishes off my mind. Because we’re at the Great Hall and Draco is walking over to our table, holding a plate and a glass of juice and there’s this very tall Ravenclaw — I think his name is Flannagan — walking over to him and everything slows down, halts.
I’m speechless. I had no idea. I don’t need him to say he’s sorry, but I can tell that they needed it. And that it changed things between them too. There seems to be a lot I’ve been missing out.
You take on every case, you work extra hours, you file all your reports, you go on cases abroad and you try to get him out of your mind. You work yourself to exhaustion and go back to the sleeping potions, trying formula after new formula, until Hermione gets suspicious and drills you with so many questions you end up confessing everything. You don’t tell her you’re in love with him, but you’re pretty sure she gets there by herself. Not even Hermione can help you with this one.
It’s been years. I thought I’d get used to the feeling. But the ring gets me all the time and he knows it. His hand travels on the table, in a seemingly random motion, but his sleeve rubs against mine for the hundredth time that night and there’s no doubt in my mind that it’s deliberate.
It started like that. Malfoy’s breath on his ear, his voice low, hot against his skin. Harry shivered, though he could feel the heat from Malfoy’s body just behind him, too close, but not touching him. Even if he could. For the rest of the night, he could do whatever the hell he wanted with Harry.
‘He had fucking nice hair,’ I repeat. My voice goes up a notch in the quiet kitchen. ‘Tidy, nothing like yours!’
Harry bit his lip. He was ashamed of the sounds he was making inside his head. He didn’t know if he could just let it all out, not before Malfoy.
He keeps hitting the frontpage of every wizarding publication, a different man on his arm every night. Meanwhile, I party all night, play the unavailable-distant type to everyone who approaches me, sometimes getting a blow job out of it, just for the sake of watching the hard look on his face when I leave with someone else. I drink my way to an early coffin & watch as he hits on every good-looking blonde he finds, his body pinning them like flies on the wall. Not that they’re not willing, oh so willing. He only leaves the club with them when I tell him no. Sometimes, I deny him for the pure, unadulterated pleasure of seeing his reaction, the rigid set of his jaw, the tense shrug of his shoulders, the curl of his lips in a smile I’ve come to cherish, as he leans in closer & whispers in my ear:
After a while, I feel a warming spell washing over us. I stop shivering as his magic makes a kind of bubble for us, as his hand caresses my back. I lift my head up to look at him. And I can’t believe the sight of his eyes. They’re wet. His lips form a thin line. His jaw is tense. I can feel anger seeping through him, it’s almost something I can touch. He hates that I’m hurt. He hates what was done to me, he hates it so deeply. And still he holds me, he doesn’t let go.
‘Of course there is,’ Malfoy says. I’m only aware of his hand there, so intimate, like we’re boyfriends. Like we’re
He grabs my hair harshly and sinks his cock in my mouth, no other preamble. I gag on it. His hands force my head down on him. He seems to be enjoying himself.
My hand slides into his hair. He immediately stops speaking. His lips part slightly. His hair is bright, soft, silk between my fingers. His breath catches.
I dare to turn around and face him. He’s slightly taller than me. That means I have to lift my hand up to his neck. I trace it lightly, then my fingers brush his shaved hair.
‘But it’s the truth,’ Harry said. ‘I want you to be the one taking me home, fucking me on your bed. Or mine. I want to belong to you. Collared, owned, and yours. If you want to.’
‘Don’t worry, sweetie. I’m saving all my judgement for your Potter addiction. Or should I say favourite brand of poison? Atrocious hair, body like sin, fucks every pretty boy that looks like you?’
As if answering him, Harry turned his head. With his arms free, he could adjust his position and now his eyes were again trained on the darkness surrounding Draco. Josh resumed the flogging, the first blow eliciting a low growl from Harry, his lips falling open, his legs straining to keep him up, his eyes unwavering.
It was as if the words unleashed something tucked in deep. Harry arched his back, Josh’s hands coming up to hold him, back against chest. Harry moaned then, raw and careless. His eyes dropped to Draco’s crotch and only then did Draco realise his hands had moved there, he was touching himself, unaware.
I stare at my neatly socked feet. Seven months. Two weeks. 3 days. Whatever hours are right about now. Give or take.
‘I don’t remember getting an invitation,’ Draco said stiffly, more to appear in control than because he actually cared.
The feeling is exhilarating. I’m confined under him, no place to hide from his eyes, from his ever invading questions. I’d usually fight him over this. I’d struggle & distract him with my body, until he caved in & fucked me. But this time, I can’t. My hard cock is lodged against his. But it doesn’t matter, because my desperation has nothing to do with how hard I am. It has to do with him, with the admission he wants to force out of me.
And I realise that I really want to kiss him. If I’m being honest, it’s not even the first time I want it. But I don’t move to do it. Instead, I rest my head on his shoulder. He doesn’t push for an answer and he doesn’t push me away. His arms come up around me. He has no idea how peaceful he makes me feel.
Malfoy is by the counter, speaking to a tall witch with a snake tattoo curling around her wrist. You think she’s an Unspeakable too, but you only saw her once before. They don’t call it the Department of Mysteries for nothing, Ron usually says. The fact that you don’t know what Malfoy does when he’s not fucking you, leaves you in a mist of curiosity and uneasiness. He is good at his work, that much you know from Hermione. You’ve seen him do wandless magic like it’s nothing at all. You love the feeling of his magic on you, but that’s the kind of thinking that doesn’t get you anywhere. Right now, he looks completely enthralled in conversation with that witch. You want to know what interests him so. Out of bed, he never talks to you. It makes you feel like a fucktoy; maybe he doesn’t think you have anything interesting to say. You feel way out of his league, so it’s probably for the best. You force yourself to look away, to focus on something else.
The want in his eyes is so clear that for a moment I think he’s going to drop to his knees in front of me and suck me off. The thought surely crosses his mind, because he looks down, eyes fixed on the bulge in my trousers.
His hands slip over your thighs and you don’t need anything else. Already his arms are coming around your waist and you’re climbing on top of him.
Draco felt like he was dreaming. A very vivid, torturing dream featuring Harry Potter on his knees, looking like sin. He shook his head, as if to shake the sight of Harry away, but he was still there, looking expectantly at him.
‘It won’t do if the guest of honor leaves when the best is yet to come, don’t you think?’ Josh asked in amusement.
The words were clear enough. You gathered your clothes, got dressed and Disapparated right there. He didn’t even lift his eyes.
bucking on the bed, his lips falling open in a gasp. Josh gripped at his hair and lifted his head up, so he would face Draco.
I expect him to jump back, to ask me what the hell I’m doing. But he’s quiet, staring at my hand as I trace circles with my fingers over his jeans.
He’s gone. I stop moving, the music loud on my ears, my heart frantic. Pans catches my eye. She calls him my
You turn on your bed, completely dressed. Shadows play on your walls. You should get undressed, but it’s too much trouble.
Parkinson is also there. They always start the night dancing together. She also looks different. Her hair is shorter, curling around her ear, and her laugh is easy. There’s a lot of sex in their dance. At first I thought they were together, but I was wrong. Parkinson leaves with a different woman every night. Tonight it’s probably that cute black girl now wrapped around her, a hand over Parkinson’s arse. As for Malfoy… he never leaves with anyone, but flirts with just about everyone.  Everything about him screams fuck you and fuck me at the same time. One is familiar; the other vast unknown territory; together, they keep me coming back for more. But I never make a move on him. I’m the only one that doesn’t.
Draco felt his own lips curl upwards. He was used to the effect that smile had on his submissives. How they broke under it. But Harry was taking it, drinking it in, his head tilted back and upwards, his lips open, his chest heaving. He craved it.
‘Well, at least you stopped hexing each other’s bollocks,’ Ron says and huffs a laugh. ‘You got us worried there, mate.’ There’s no hint of judgement in the way he says it.
He’d had a crush on Potter since forever. He’d taken it and filed it away, tucked in a corner of his mind, only taking it out for the occasional burst of fantasy, or late night wank, or when picking partners for his scenes: dark-haired, muscled men with clear eyes. Fuck. That was not occasional at all, was it? Draco felt his throat go dry and no sound came out.
There was no hesitation. Harry crawled over to the bed, climbed up, his knees red, his cock jutting hard before him. Without even asking he positioned himself in exactly the way Draco wanted him. On all fours, facing Draco, head bent low, arse up.
She takes off her fancy glasses and slips a pair of even fancier sunglasses on her nose, imperiously walking out the door.
He steps on my wand. I hear the distinct sound of wood rasping against stone. My heart misses a beat, I’m paralised in terror.
was exactly the type of man he had a weakness for. Inside the club, that was all that mattered. Josh wanted to watch them. Together. Josh wanted Malfoy to break Harry. And then fuck him, probably. It would please Josh to no end.
And Potter proved to be the farthest thing from a cup of tea. Better than any drink or recreational potion I’ve ever had. And believe me, I’ve had plenty.
His eyes are so grey. The only thing left of the boy I knew. But they’re no longer cold. They’re not cold at all. His hand tangled in my hair, his whole body flung into mine. He can’t hide the fact that he’s breathless.
he thought. Flogging was always the center of attention at these clubs. Draco gripped his glass as Josh arched his arm back. The flogger drove swiftly through the air, aim perfect and vicious. The first of Harry’s moans reached Draco’s ears.
Someone is laughing hysterically. Someone who shouldn’t be laughing, because this is not funny, not funny. I put my hands on my face and they’re wet, and bloody, and I’m trembling, trembling, laughing. He’s helping me up, but I don’t want his help. Everything burns and then I feel so cold, so cold. These dirty hands, they’re not mine. They can’t be. They’re tainted. He should get away from me. I push him back and feel the ground coming up, the blackened sky hurtling down, the trees spinning towards me.
‘Of all the things, what you want is for me to kiss you?’ Draco’s voice was hoarse, Harry felt a tingle of irony in it, but the irony was drowning in surprise and want. And Draco wasn’t able to hide it. His body flared up again, drawn to Malfoy’s.
All the more so because he’d watch it happen, leaning against that damned wall, smoking those damned cigarettes. He wouldn’t save me this time around, we’d finally be even. As if I can ever be even with a martyr. A selfless hero.
You reach the balustrade, your hands on the cold stone. Down bellow, the trees form long dark shapes like a garden of stone. You can breathe for the first time in hours.
Draco felt dizzy from the shift in their power play. He’d never wanted a submissive to have him like this. Harry had one of his hands on the nape of Draco’s neck, fingers warm, brushing on his hair like they were lovers, his other hand roaming over Draco’s arse. Draco let himself feel Harry under his tongue and hands, taking in the planes, curves and angles, and the lines of old scars and recent bruises, some part of his mind wondering if any of those might be
There was no way to keep the sound inside. It was out: a deep needy moan. Malfoy’s hands wrapped around his hip bones. Because they could. Because Harry was his. He leaned back, the touch of Malfoy’s clothes against the sensitive skin of his arse making him float.
The nerve of him. That’s the one thing that’s always gotten under Draco’s skin. The sheer nerve of him. Draco’s trembling.
There’s a swirl, then he’s looking at a street he doesn’t recognize. But the light seems to know where they’re heading. It flickers more excitedly now, then circles around his head. He eyes it suspiciously. But he can’t keep it up for too long. There’s something about this light. Something that does not make sense, something that shouldn’t be happening. Unexpected. He wants to know.
‘Do you want me to leave you two alone?’ Josh was already up, grabbing the bag with his instruments.
He felt tears welling up on his eyes at the words, his body melting into Draco’s. His hands tightened on Draco’s arms. They were lean and strong. He was so glad he could finally touch them.
He has a mind to repeat the stunt tonight. He turns me around, running his right hand over my chest and then dropping it down to my crotch. The fact that I’m not even hard doesn’t seem to bother him.
He once again became aware of the eyes of the men around them. He had completely forgotten about them. Some had chosen to watch Draco and Harry, instead of doing their thing.
He looks at me like he wants this piece of information to sink in. But it already did. Months ago. It made me happy in a strange way. And now he all but confessed he’s only sleeping with me. Which I obviously know because I’m there every night, sleeping right next to him. But the fact that he just said it, that he wants to make sure I know he’s not seeing anyone else- that there’s
Sounding bored is a skill I’ve honed my entire life. Too bad Harry Potter seems to have developed full immunity to it. Even worse, he seems to get off on it.
Malfoy tilted his head in interest, his hair falling to the side. Harry saw arousal in the deep grey eyes.
Several men were watching Josh and Harry’s play, sitting on couches, standing in pairs and groups. It wouldn’t be long before one of them made an offer for Harry. The thought made Draco feel uneasy. He took a long sip of his wine, washing the feeling down.
I walk over to him. His pale hair falls on his face and I lift my hand to pull it back behind his ear. Once we touch, we’re unable to stop. His lips are on my palm, kissing me, and the ache spreads everywhere on my body. His hands go up to my hair, I press him against the door, his legs fall open to allow my thigh between them, and he’s the first to moan.
Harry felt two long fingers breaching his mouth and he bucked back, his arse brushing against the hard line of Malfoy’s trousers. His lips parted pliantly to take Malfoy’s fingers in, deep. He was surprised to hear his own moan.
When that yes had come out of the fucking blue and stayed unequivocal all through his strict questioning, Draco had felt thrown to the abyss. He had been so ready for a refusal. That precise feeling - of being so close to have what he wished for and having it yanked away, at the very last minute, by the man who had plagued his dreams and his life - that was what he was taking home with him that night. Or so he had thought.
In a daze, you draw back and drive back in. He moves his hips, meets your thrusts. His eyes are unfocused. The grey in them is nearly blue at the corners of his irises.
‘No, Malfoy,’ he shook his head, lost in the feeling of Malfoy around him, hands restless over his thighs, skimming, twisting. He did not deem himself worthy of that cock, hard, long, pressing through Malfoy’s perfectly tailored trousers, right against his arse.
‘I’m just saying that we’re gonna hurt each other. Everyone does. So I’m not going to promise that I won’t. But I’ll try my best. I want this.’
He walks after it. The light flies in front of him and he can almost feel its energy battering at his skin, drawing the cold away. He turns left, then right, the streets are almost empty but there are some Muggles rushing past him, friends laughing, and lights shining on every building. He reaches a square. The light is positively ecstatic at this point. It sparkles in front of his nose, then flies so fast he almost has to run to keep it in sight.
Harry’s eyes lit up with something akin to a challenge. There it was again. That smile, half teasing, half shy.
Draco had to close his eyes abruptly. He was on freefall. Harry was moaning, helplessly now, and those broken little sounds were turning Draco on beyond reason. His hand gripped the side of the couch, his whole body tensing up with the effort to keep some sort of composure. He breathed in deeply, shutting down the sounds of the club, the slow beat of the background music, the whispers from the men commenting on the scene, the noises from other couple’s plays, but he couldn’t shut Harry out. The sounds coming out of Harry’s mouth were pure fantasy material, twisted into a reality he would never have again.
‘We were just fooling around. But… he wanted more. And I didn’t. He kept pressuring me… that night he- he forced me- I didn’t- Couldn’t- He just didn’t take no for an answer.’
He didn’t know how long that kiss lasted. Long enough for him to be sure. Not nearly enough for what he wanted. Draco was half-carrying him, away from the cross, his arms holding Harry safely.
We’ve been sharing these silent moments. I thought he might be expecting me to thank him. I hate that now I not only owe him my life, but also mother's. He spoke for us at the trials. Father was convicted of course. I knew all along there would be no hope for him. But when it came to me and mother, it was Potter’s speech that turned the sentence around. I don’t even remember what he said, just that he went on and on about turning the other cheek or some sort of noble crap. All I know is that it won them over. Mother and I were formally pardoned, provided we keep funding War reparations and get reintegrated into society — whatever that means. In the end, it’s one more life debt piling up at his feet. I was supposed to be locked up for good. Instead, he decided I won’t be paying my dues.
He feels so good inside me. I’m flying & anchored down to the earth at the same time. I can take on anything, even if I’m only taking his cock, even if he doesn’t belong to me. I bring my mouth over his.
Not for the first time, I wonder if he’s real. If I didn’t get to see him in class I’d probably think him a product of my imagination. A consequence of war trauma, as my therapist would say. That is — if I ever mentioned these late night meetings to her. Which I won’t.
I want and want with a hunger that rips my stomach, cuts through me and yanks me to the surface. I stand trembling on the edge of this feeling, his laugh ringing in my ears, his arms around me, his whole body warm and wanting. My fingers reach for his hair, tangle in there lightly.
His question makes you feel like he’s allowing you to take the lead, even though it’s probably just the proper wizarding etiquette.
He’s looking at me with a ton of purpose and the greenest eyes ever. He sets his coffee on the table.
For a split second Draco had the crazy idea that Harry was looking for him. He crushed the thought immediately.
Somehow I manage to make him lose his footing. He sways on the spot, takes a step back and it’s enough for me to run blindly for the desk. My wand is there. He grabs my robes. I hear the fabric tearing, a horrible tug. I stumble forward. He yanks the wand away from me and it clatters loudly to the floor.
This time the negotiation seemed to take longer. He became aware of the other man moving closer to him, and speaking to Josh in a low tone.  He felt increasingly curious, wondering what the man might be asking for, feeling his eyes on him through the black blindfold. He couldn’t get any of the words, though. Only his scent. It was maddening, even from a distance. It made Harry’s mouth water.
Harry looked thoroughly disheveled and delicious, hair messy and perfect to be tugged at. Draco wanted to make Harry look at him. But the minute he’d touch Harry he’d be hard pressed to stop. And there was something to be said of the pleasure Draco felt in denying them both a bit longer.
At that moment, Draco knew that sucking cock was the single most important thing in the world for Harry Potter. And it was only because Draco wanted it.
Harry felt Malfoy’s body tensing up, merely inches from his own. The burning sensation built up around him and there was sweat trickling down his back.
And then Malfoy was kissing his hole, his tongue licking over the rim of his arse, his hands careful on his skin. Harry thought he was dying. Malfoy’s tongue lapped over his hole, warm. Harry felt him press there, sinking into his arse slowly. He pressed back, wanting more of it, not believing he had Malfoy’s face buried in his arse.
‘Draco looks better than all of those poor things you drag after you.’ Parkinson swallows her Martini in one go. ‘Mess around with those surrogates and leave the real deal alone.’
‘I wasn’t talking about your proclivities for Firewhisky, Draco.’ She eyes the table, the several open flasks. ‘Or your preference for recreational use of potions, although this-’ She waves her hand.
‘Fuck, I…’ Harry sobbed, then cursed again, and his voice was rough around the edges, the sexiest thing Draco had heard in life. ‘I have this fantasy. About you.’
Malfoy was waiting for an answer. It hit him just then that Malfoy could have done whatever he wanted with him - bound and blindfolded as he was - and never reveal his name. Josh had authorized it, Harry was Malfoy’s for the night. But still, he had revealed his identity. Harry could not explain why, but that turned him on even more.
Josh was slipping out of him and coming around the bed to caress Harry’s cheek. He pressed a kiss on Harry’s forehead.
I stare at my empty teacup and realise I’ve been lost in thought. I reach out my hand and he holds it across the table. It’s a casual gesture, but it means the world.
He stands under the hard rain. His hair looks nearly white, plastered to his face, his  black robes soaked through, tugging at his thin chest. His sleeves are rolled up. My eyes catch on the Dark Mark, right there, on his left arm. A crude thing. A dead thing.
It starts slowly, a soft swaying, it climbs up my legs, my chest, it catches me aware of everything. Of the cold night air, of his moving body behind me, warm, of his intoxicating scent, of his breath huffing on my neck. Time falls away. There’s only dance, slow beat, Draco moving with me, not pushing, not wanting more than I’m ready to give. I take his hands and pull them around me, over the front of my jeans. That’s when I dare to open my eyes and watch his arms around me like they belong there, his tattoos stark, his fingers cupping me.
Fuck. So, he hadn’t been imagining it. The way Malfoy looked at him when they crossed paths at the Ministry. The way those grey eyes followed him on those random pub nights. The way they were now watching him, a glint in them that Harry wanted to draw all out.
‘You’ll have to break him some,’ Draco said. He remembered how tight Harry was. Even after being rimmed for so long that night, he’d been like a tight vice when Draco finally entered him. God, he missed that. ‘I want your fingers up his arse. Stretch him.’
Draco took in the sight of Harry, mouth open in silence, his hard body going pliant with every moment that went by.
Another man was coming up to Josh. He refused this one too. This time, Josh did not even pretend to be considering the offer. It was as if he was waiting for something else. It didn’t make any sense. They were clearly putting on a show. A show designed for
I feel him smile and then he’s pushing me down against the mattress, and pulling the covers over us. We’re both hard against each other. But we do nothing about it. His breath quiets me down, gently, slowly. His hand drops to my waist. I fall asleep in his arms.
‘I’m seeing a Healer,’ He says, solemn, nervous. ‘A Mind Healer.’ He swallows. ‘She’s helping me deal with-’ he gestures in the general direction of the trees, the castle, the darkness. ‘Well- Everything.’
Malfoy’s fingers twisted over the tip of his cock. Harry didn’t care for the whine out of his mouth. If the reward for telling the truth was this, he was ready to spill his heart out.
‘It was just a couple of potions and drinks-’ My words come out slurred. I seem to have lost the ability to speak.
She does wear her sarcasm as well as her expensive designer clothes. I only know of one other person who wears it better, but I can’t bring myself to think about him right now. Or ever. His silence the last few weeks has made that abundantly clear.
‘You did so good, baby…’ he said, and his fingers brushed the wetness off Harry’s face. Harry only answered with a broken sigh, his eyes drifting shut.
Harry never looked away, trapped by the vision of Draco sucking him off, his cheeks hollowing, his eyes burning through Harry as if he wanted to imprint himself on Harry’s mind, beyond this night, probably forever.
Around me, conversations are exchanged, plates emptied of food, glasses of wine filled. I don’t know a single subject discussed and my stomach is empty of anything but wine. I’m on my fourth glass. If I keep going, the line between right and wrong will get blurry, opening up a space of possibility. I’m waiting for it to happen. My eyes are unmoving on the metal band of his ring, stark against his finger. I stare at it all through dinner. It feels like I’ve been staring at it all my life.
So... blue hair Draco anyone? :D How are you feeling about this one? I'm a complete sap, I know. I'm a Hufflepuf, in case that's not already apparent *hya!* The last chapter is coming up and you won't want to miss it, believe me.
A single thought takes over your mind. It’s a long, crazy shot, but you haven’t slept in two days. In for a penny, in for a pound.
, then I go for his throat with a curse. We fight like we’re at war. It’s like we never really left. He blocks me, I jinx him, he falls over a desk. He sends it flying over my head. It comes crashing loudly on the other side of the room.
He takes a sit across me and pours the tea for us. He takes the flask and tips some drops on my tea.
Draco turned his smirk to Josh, all the while feeling Harry’s eyes on his face. Harry wouldn't look away, only if he was told to.
‘Hating on each other and arguments? I don’t think we need a change in relationship status for that.’
me when we get horizontal. His hands fall on my hips, no doubt in them about where this is going. I can’t fucking think straight.
‘He's the one who needs to be drunk out of his mind to say yes to me- He hates that he wants me for a fuck. I'm just giving him one more reason to.’
‘Funny thing, really,’ I set my now empty glass on the counter. ‘I give the press what they want, they take the picture, I dump the bloke- everyone gets off my back. You do the math. Or the arithmancy, whatever does it for you.’
. Harry gave a muffled cry. He bucked back against Malfoy’s hands. He wanted Malfoy to feel him up, to know that he could - he could do anything with it. Anything at all.
But his hand wasn’t pleading. It was driving Draco nearly out of his goddamn mind, fingers skimming his bollocks through layers of fabric, his palm pressing over Draco’s hard shaft, then his fingers climbed up, closing around his length. Draco didn’t bother repressing a groan.
The first thrust of his hips still caught Harry by surprise. His body convulsed around Draco, his arms tensed on the restraints as he tried to push back into the feeling. He wasn’t ready for this, for the intense response of his body. His thighs tensed around Draco, pulling him close, as Draco thrust into him, slow but steady, like he knew exactly what Harry needed. Harry heard himself scream when another thrust hit his prostate and he jerked, forced down by Draco’s hands, one on his leg, keeping it up, the other on his chest, pressing down.
I bring myself down on him. His orgasm cuts through whatever he was going to say. He is the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen. And he’s not mine, he can never be mine.
I usually leave when I’m one sip away from joining those blokes and try my luck with him. I draw my line there. Just because I have to draw it somewhere. I set the glass down. He watches me leave.
Draco felt his own body burning up. Like he was the one kissing Harry, that mouth opening up under his, allowing him in, that hand gripping at his clothes, feverish and needy, fingers searching under the fabric, pulling him close. Like Harry had done when they’d kissed.
He looks nervous, suddenly unsure, and that’s why he can’t stop talking. He thinks he needs to convince me of this. Like I would ever say no.
I nod. I like that he’s not apologising. I don’t know why, but it makes me feel relieved. I feel like I’ve spent all my life apologising for every wrong thing I did. For every mistake, even mistakes that preceded me, even mistakes I wasn’t able to avoid. Somehow, he seems to get that sorry is a loaded word between us.
notice that before. He had just chosen to ignore it. Josh had been right. Malfoy was his type. Everything in him made Harry want to succumb. The grey eyes surveyed Harry.
Harry was falling asleep, too exhausted to realise what was even happening. He felt another pair of hands on him. Josh’s. He heard him speak to Draco, voices low and he didn’t get the words. Draco’s hand was brushing over his leg, gentle, Josh was softly thumbing his wrists, as they kept talking. He was so tired he couldn’t get anything of the conversation, he couldn’t even manage to open his eyes, he just wanted their hands to not leave him. This was the moment when he became fully Josh’s again. He whimpered weakly, as Josh nuzzled him against his chest. His heart was beating loudly.
His only answer is a dry, ironic laugh. I take a drag of my cigarette. He folds his arms, his jaw tense.
‘Beautiful,’ Draco breathed. He watched them adjusting to each other, with the easy confidence of long time lovers. Josh canted his hips back, hands on Harry’s hips and there was silence and consent in everything about Harry, in the way he let his body open, in the way he never stopped looking at Draco, not even when pain hit him, not even when Josh pushed in deeper, not even when a line formed on his damp forehead, not even when he bit his lower lip, not even when he seemed about to beg Josh to stop.
He releases me the second we stop on the dark familiar street. He walks ahead of me again. I watch his back, his shoulders. My heart aches with a hunger that I know will never be sated. It’s never good to fall this hard, down the abyss of someone.
Harry fixed Draco with those defiant eyes, a low moan barely suppressed. There was a groan from Josh, a gentle slide, his hands smoothing over Harry’s arching back, the whole of Harry’s body allowing the invasion, submitting for Draco.
‘Is there a point in that story?’ he asks in the calmest of voices, his heart beating so loudly he almost doesn’t get his own words.
‘It’s Malfoy to you,’ I say, trying to sound as bored as I can. The heel of his hand presses inefficiently against my cock. ‘And… you’re not that good.’
I reach the back door. Outside, I light a cigarette & slowly reach the Apparition spot behind the bar, our usual rendezvous. As predicted, I barely have to wait. A minute later, I hear his steps on the sidewalk.
Malfoy’s touch on his skin was light, like a feather, then suddenly so hard, Harry gasped. Malfoy’s hand hit his right arsecheek, sure, hard, decisive. Harry’s body flared up. Malfoy’s hand was replaced by the crop. Harry clenched his teeth and took the pain in. He stopped being aware of anything else, his world narrowing down to Malfoy’s crop on his arse, the leather biting into his skin, fast, slow, then fast again. Every time Malfoy’s crop hit him, his body was sent reeling against the cross and his cock pressed against it. He’d never been so hard in his life, still he made no sound.
Since that night, we started sleeping together. We don’t ever talk about it, or about what it means, but he comes over to my room around the same time every night. He brings his toothbrush and one day I notice he doesn’t bother to put it back in his bag. It stays there, right next to mine. Like the array of his hair products, three or four different bottles, placed in an ordered row, supposedly all destined for a different purpose that I know nothing about. Like his pyjamas, folded neatly on a chair, and the heavy books he brings from the library (which look exactly like the sort of light-reading Hermione fancies) and that he places on our nightstand, after perusing through them a bit before sleeping. And Draco Malfoy wears glasses, which when I first noticed it, nearly shocked me. He uses them only to read, they’re thin and modern and even though I never imagined him wearing glasses, now I can’t imagine him any other way. There’s something so weirdly comforting about his silence as he reads, his head tipped slightly down, a strand of his white-blonde hair falling over one side of his face, the concentrated stare. I have to force myself to look away and open the Seeker Weekly magazine Ron lent to me, staring at the flying picture of some famous American Seeker like it’s the most interesting thing in the world. But I feel him taking a peek at me here and there. I don’t react to it. I pretend to read on and feel his eyes on me.
He was coming into Draco Malfoy’s mouth the second those lips latched around his cock. His mouth opened in a deep silent cry. He wasn’t surprised with the fact that his voice was gone. His body jerked violently, his arms shuddered against the restraints. Draco’s fingers gripped him hard and Harry was coming, eyes shot open, his body taut, his cock hitting the back of Draco’s throat, spunk shooting out of him. Draco drank him down, eyes drifting closed, like he was in another world entirely, a world made of Harry’s taste. And Harry’s whole world was Draco and the mouth around his cock, drinking him down to the last drop, taking everything he was.
‘I wonder how you survived a War.’ I say when the laughing fit subsides. ‘You’re a terrible liar, Harry.’
You go to Paris on a three-day case assignment. You come back with a mind to take a long bath and floo in sick for the rest of the week.
He realised he couldn’t feel Draco’s hand on his leg anymore… did he leave? Did he not like it? Wasn’t he happy with Harry? Wasn’t Harry good enough? Maybe he’d had better… a man like him, he could have anyone. Harry did not want to cry but he couldn’t reel it in, his whole body was stretched beyond belief, his emotions wrecked.
He lifted his arse as high as he could, meeting the cane midway, pain ripping him apart until he was all heat and cries. It filled him up, made him reach farther and farther inside him, wanting desperately to be a perfect little slut for Malfoy.
‘I… I’m not easy, Harry,’ Draco said. He gave a wry laugh at his own understatement. ‘But this… I don’t want to walk away from this. Whatever this is. I left that night because I thought it was the right thing for you. But now… I can’t- I fucking walked away from everything in my life and now I can’t. Because I’ve had you.’
His eyes snap open. Behind his glasses, they look very green, very wide. I watch as my spit runs slowly down his chin. He breathes hard. I lean over and lick the spit right off his face. My tongue traces the corner of his lips. I feel his hot breath on me, the minty rush from his cigarettes. He makes a helpless little sound with the back of his throat, like a stifled moan. It makes me nearly crazed. I release his throat. My fingers leave faint marks on his neck. His jaw shines in the exact place where my tongue has been.
‘You’re already pleasing me, you have no idea just how much…’ Malfoy said. The bulge in his pants came in contact with Harry’s cock. He rutted against Harry, slow and purposeful, a gasp escaping his lips. One of Malfoy’s hands came up to cup Harry’s face, his lips too close to Harry’s. Just a tiny movement from one of them and they would be kissing.
Like I’m confiding in Pansy or Blaise and not the man I’ve been sleeping with on and off for months. The man my best friends are certain I have feelings for. My only crush since forever.
‘And you’re delusional if you think I can sleep with you naked. There’s only so much I can take,’ his tone is amused, tender, and I’ll deny melting at the sound of it until the end of my days.
Then one day the inevitable happens. He meets Hermione and Ron as we’re walking out of my room. I freeze, but he doesn’t. He says good morning, says he’s heading down for breakfast. I’ll save you a seat, he adds to us as he leaves.
He takes my hand, puts it over his thigh, makes it climb all the way up. There’s a drum of need underneath, I can feel it beating, wild, wild. But there’s time. We have time.
‘I- I just needed some air.’ He says in a faint voice. His fingers are tracing some random pattern on the dry ground. I realise he’s not smoking. Then I realise I haven’t seen him with those Muggle cigarettes in a very long time.
Harry looked at him, and there was no pain left there. Only want. Josh groaned and sank into him again, slow and deep. Harry’s whole body shook.
The cigarette drops from his fingers, forgotten, and even though he’s completely silent, you feel it. He tenses up, his cock hits the back of your throat and he spills. He tastes salty, bitter. You drink him down, watching his face as he bites down on his lip, his hands shaking on your hair.
Malfoy walked over, like a vision from Harry’s darkest fantasies, and without further ado, placed the tip of the cane against his nipple. There was a heartbeat in which Harry breathed in sharply, eyes wide, mouth falling open. Then Draco twisted his wrist just so and the cane twisted his nipple cruelly. There was such sweet pain that Harry cried out. And begged for more.
‘Fuck me,’ he said again. It sounded pathetic, but he didn’t care. Draco’s reaction was everything, his face torn between arousal and control, a battle taking place there and Harry so wanted to see which side would win. If there would be any winners at all.
‘I loved your little show, Harry,’ he said, and knew his voice was warm, but with a stinging bite to it.
Potter doesn’t have to. He doesn’t even need this, whatever this is. The buying of drinks, the sweet talking me, the questioning touches that really are more on the side of affirmative. And the worst is, he knows. He knows I’m deflecting, playing difficult. He is plainly aware of it & he also knows that I hate him for it.
Pansy presses two fingers to the sides of her nose like I’m a particular brand of nuisance she despises. She looks at me like she’s seeing me for the first time. A humourless laugh escapes her lips.
You think of going to his apartment, knock on his door and confront him. To say what, you don’t quite know, but that never stopped you before. You have half a mind to do it, when you spot him leaving the usual pub night with a good-looking man you never saw before. It hits you just then that this thing between you was never exclusive. You get mad at yourself for forgetting it and from then on you dive into work.
I’m staring at my half-finished drink when I recognize the cold cheeky voice, right before my eyes land on a pair of high heels like a red menace.
Harry sucked at the head, refusing to go down more. Draco let him, in fact he wanted Harry to take him like this, to take control of his cock, to drive him to madness. He felt indeed crazy when Harry pulled back again, and his cock bobbed in the air, red and covered in Harry’s saliva.
He was lost. The whole club was gone and they were alone. Just like that, Malfoy had driven him under. Harry was an experienced sub, he’d been with lots of different Doms. But those Doms didn’t ask him so bluntly what he wanted. They surely didn’t call him
My eyes open to a thin layer of cold light filtering from a window. Dawn is breaking. For an agonizing moment, I’m back in that classroom, those hands pushing me against stone, the hard press of a body, that smell, his breath all over me. I have no idea where I am. This isn’t my bed, or the Slytherin dorms. Nothing feels familiar. My fingers clutch hard at my wand, I sit up, cold sweat breaking at my temple. I slept armed again, like I did all through the War.
The cigarette falls from his fingers, the bright tip shining on the way down to the floor. I watch his hands for signs of wandless magic, but there’s nothing there. His whole body tenses like a bow and then he drops his arms down, all the tension instantly gone from him. He tilts his head back. His lips part. He closes his eyes.
‘I’m not seeing him again,’ I say in a whisper. I let the truth of it settle over me & it’s too much. It feels like something heavy is sitting on my chest & crushing me.
‘Because you’re so fucking pretty and so good,’ Draco completed, his throat raw, his words tasting wet on his tongue. ‘And I always take good care of pretty things I own, so I can use them again and again…’
I know the took FOREVER, but here it is! This is my last Drarry fic for the foreseeable future. I spent more than six months writing this chapter, so that I could give myself and you the very best of what I can write. I edited the first chapter - it's the same story, but it needed some fixing here and there, so if you want, go back and read it from the top.
‘Put up some spells, do me here,’ I say instead. Like I just want to get it over with, when in fact I never want it to end. Like it always does. Like it always will.
I watch him and force my breathing to slow down to his rhythm. Inhale. Exhale. It’s harder than it seems, to make myself breathe like I’m not under attack.
‘To what do I owe the pleasure?’ I say in my best mock-nice tone. You know, the tone I always use when I am forced to talk to her, which, if you ask me, happens way more often than it should.
You want him. You’ve been wanting him late at night and it must be quite obvious because he’s brought you here.
‘More than,’ Harry choked out. His throat felt so dry. He couldn’t take this closeness, this conversation that sounded too much like a confession.
The door opens and I’m left there, with my hand still up in the air, rain falling on my hair, cold seeping through me. I can only see half of his face, one green eye, half a mouth, half disheveled hair. He looks half good.
Then there’s that fateful Saturday night. Potter has the nerve to walk up to me, leaving his blonde-for-the-night standing there, not ten feet away, waiting for him while he hits on me.
The cold helps me pretend I don’t want anything from him. I sit on the edge of the pavement and take out a cigarette. No one is watching me, so I light it wandlessly.
We don’t do rough. Or fast. Draco always takes his time with me. He’s slow, and tender and his words wrap around me, filling me as his cock does.
