“Ohhhh…” Dean intones, eyes darting. “I
“Mm hm. I wonder why that is,” Draco ponders, and he leans his face into the spray for a moment.
And why did it matter? And just…
Ginny screaming, Hermione crying, Robards yelling, friends apologizing: all of them leaving him.
“No,” Harry whispers and wipes his eyes.
Probably needs salt, anyhow.”
Of course Malfoy is inside. It’s late evening, so of course he’s inside, settling down for the night. Probably tucked into a nest of satin and velvet and skin with a book. Alone.
“Oh, fuck,” he murmurs.
“Voyeurs…” The hand swims in undulating waves above the cot.
It’s the silence. And the darkness. And the perfect, sacred isolation.
A smarmy, figure-eight tracing of his chin through the air; neither a nod nor a shake.
“Bloody show-off,” Draco whispers as Harry’s fingers sink into his slick hole.
“Potter, you look like shit,” Jenkins mumbles, twirling in the desk chair.
The room is dim, lit only by the green and sapphire kaleidoscope shapes thrown from the lamp near the window. A cool summer breeze flows through, heavy with greenery and the static warning charge of an approaching storm front.
The two men all but high-five on their way back out the door, and Harry doesn’t bother to hide his disdain at their retreating forms. His thumb finds his wand in its thigh holster, and Malfoy’s eyes go wide, with Harry’s following.
“They did
The decorative spikes on the gate in front of Grimmauld Place are sun-warmed and smooth under his hands as he waits, but Kreacher doesn’t pop out to snarl at him. Maybe Ginny has put him to work in the garden, the hypocrite. A petty part of him wants to inform Arthur and Molly that their daughter is utilizing a house-elf for menial labor, but every other part of him is fairly sure he should stay the hell away from the Burrow.
Draco slowly pulls out, and Harry licks his lips as hot come trickles down his arse. With a lazy, satisfied grin, Draco sits back on his heels, and Harry forgets every beautiful thing he’s seen before this.
“Or, it’s a
Harry grunts a disagreement and scoots forward, taking Draco deeper, but the angle is terrible, his nose is almost submerged, and he can’t see a damn thing.
Draco’s touch wanders lower, down Harry’s abdomen, and one hand skirts off toward his hip. It lingers on a crescent of slick scar tissue, stroking softly.
“Yes, if it’s within ninety days and you have the receipt.” The man nods the entire time he speaks and is probably going to speak to a Prophet reporter next, but with a lot less simpering.
"What?"
“Half-blood,” she mutters with an indifferent nod.
“Picked him up for trespassing,” Wilson chimes in. “Guess who called it in.”
“They wouldn’t curse your food. You were a bloody Auror.”
“It’s fine. I don’t need bloody ice cream to live,” Harry mutters, ripping open ketchup packets.
“Hey, ‘Mione,” he says with a sheepish smile, clearing off half the desk.
The door thuds shut, and Harry shovels a forkful of potatoes and chicken into his mouth. As he chews, he lets his gaze wander over Malfoy, who’s laying on the cot reading a book. Sensible leather shoes, pressed black trousers and a white button-down shirt are quite a departure from his shirtless state from a few nights ago. His demeanor feels different, as well; less on edge.
“Any time, love.” Her hug feels like a farewell, and the paper crane threatens to stab him in the heart as she holds him.
He’s falling before it registers that Draco shoved him over, and he hits the bed again. This time, he lands on his back, arse propped up on a pillow.
His teeth nip at the inside of his bottom lip. Hermione said Ginny was seeing him last night. Would Ginny have brought him home on the first date? Abso-fucking-lutely. Would Dean have taken her up on that invitation? Abso-fucking-lutely. Is there an Owl mail forwarding service for Muggle post?  Abso-fucking-lutely no idea, but it appears so.
indecent.”
“Your feet are on my dick again,” Harry mutters, eyes drifting shut.
A perplexed scowl tightens Harry’s face, even as his hands fidget in his hip pockets to adjust for his erection.
He would have said Malfoy Manor if he lived there, but Draco had only had a tentative truce with his parents five years ago. He would have given a real address after razzing Harry if he had one. He wouldn’t have slunk off to his cot if he had an answer.
“How is he back already?” Harry asks, unlocking the door and swinging it open. “And why’d you put him in a Body Bind?”
“Thank you,” Harry says with a sigh, quill poised. But he hesitates; the address tripping into familiar territory. “That’s Gringotts, you tosser.”
Harry glares at the last blank. Adams should have filled that in when he dropped Malfoy’s wand through the intake slot upstairs. Maybe he’d forgotten to disarm him, and maybe Malfoy is laying there fully-armed. In which case, Harry has an accomplished duellist essentially under voluntary arrest.
“Eh,” Adams grunts with a shrug, “you can take it off when he calms the fuck down.”
Goblins might have lasers embedded in their corneas. Or some kind of microwave radiation, because the lift operator’s gaze burns against Harry's hip the whole way down to the tenth level. He shifts the box to that hip, putting space between them.
Harry flinches, fingers leaving Malfoy’s lip so quickly that it slaps against his bottom teeth. The hand at his neck disappears, and his body launches a war against itself: dive forward or leap backward, chase that hand or avoid it. His eyes open, but when or why he’d closed them he couldn’t say, and fog-grey eyes fix on him.
The vault shouldn’t open for him. It wouldn’t make sense if it did, but he grips the brass handle, anyway. It warms in his hand, and he shakes his head. It’s not going to turn, but he tries, anyway.
going to Polyj-”
Draco’s breath puffs, hot and humid, down Harry’s calves. Strong hands grip his ankles and hold them, keeping him exposed and open. Draco’s length stretches his hole and fills him, over and over in steady strokes. His own hand tugs his skin over the glistening head of his cock in time with pressure deep inside him.
Draco’s head tilts back, hair under the streaming water, but eyes under hooded lids watch him.
” Draco hisses, then spits blood and saliva on the tile floor. “Your coworkers have a fucked up idea of fun, Potter. Dropping me at your house so your wife can beat me up, then coming back to throw me around some more. And trespassing at an
The horrid wallpaper, a textured velvet and vinyl peony-patterned abomination, is marred by dents, divots, and splatters of blood up the staircase. Rough-hewn, patchily-varnished floorboards are scraped with gouges from the furniture, as well as their own smattering of dark droplets.
He waits. A moment. And another. And a worrisome moment more, as he wipes his glasses clean.
“What shall we do with a sober Auror! What shall we do with a sober Auror!”
Kreacher, for all his hostility towards Harry, knows Ginny’s preferences like a book. Wide, ebony irises flick back toward the house, and Harry follows his gaze. The heavy velvet curtains in the living room slide shut, and Harry’s heartbeat thunders in his ears.
“It’s sausage rolls and crisps. And ice cream.” Harry sets his styrofoam cup of ice cream off to the side, licking his front teeth at the thought of the icy shards shooting electric pain through his incisors.
to me for a shot at her second-eldest.”
St. Pancras’ Hospital looms behind him, a conglomeration of flat-faced buildings of tan and brown brick. Narrow windows make it look more like a retrofitted fortress than a hospital.
Kreacher takes a step back, and Harry squints through fogged lenses at a thick ledger tucked under the house elf’s arm.
“Not like bottoming will get me sacked a second time today.”
“Mm hm.”
Panic explodes through Harry's brain, and he’s awake, terror in a scalding wave over his skin. The soft flannel wicks a quick sheen of sweat from his skin, and a field of pinpoint droplets glitter on the back of his hand in the afternoon sunlight.
Delicate metal clinks inside as he slips it into the robe pocket. The velvet slides easily into the deep blue silk before tugging the whole side of the robe down. The irony tucks the corners of his lips into a private smile. A small black jewelry box was easy to hide in heavy Auror robes-easy enough that he hid it there for months. This box is larger, heavier, and practically pulls the silk off his shoulders, but that’s fine, because it won’t be there for more than a few minutes.
“Can I exchange it?” His eyes flit over the million-and-one baubles he has no use for, either.
“Of course. You can’t open the bloody paper without seeing some headline about The Boy Who Lived’s life.”
“Good. I’m glad you’re home. Your father will be pleased to hear.”
–––––
Three months in and Harry still hadn’t commented on the bergamot scented body wash nestled in a nook of the shower. Harry’s hair had never been softer either, after using Draco’s far too expensive shampoo and conditioner set, and Draco made it a point to run his hands through it while Harry gasped beneath him. If he curled against Harry’s back and inhaled just to smell it and
“Did you ever have hobbies, Potter?”
It was evasive and said with too much force for Draco to truly believe. "Clearly you’re not if half your body is covered in bandages! What are you even doing in training?"
The taste was somewhere between bitter and more bitter but Draco didn’t drink for the taste. Although, when he used to break into his parent’s liquor cabinet there had been a small bottle of something that tasted like chocolate. It wrecked him for two days and caused him to hiccup bubbles. His mother had worried, voice shrill as she scolded him, while his father had been furious. There was never a time when he wasn’t. The words,
The routine became a necessary distraction and then it became normal.
“Hey, hold on there.” Harry touched his arm. It was light, careful, and not trying to cage him in, but hold him steady. “I’m trying to help you get home.”
Harry flashed a smile. "You forget I have a pretty good track record with your father...I bet I can get it under two"
Azkaban was a cold desolate place. Even with the new reforms, nothing could hide what it was. The outside stood grand and foreboding, daring anyone to challenge its dominance. Even with the dementors somewhere hidden away in its belly, Draco felt the chill seep into him.
Harry took it, unhearing. But then, Draco’s words dried up and he just held. They remained piled on the floor, Harry’s body a heavy weight on Draco, completely silent as he cried. A cry learned from being beaten for being too loud—for just being—and Draco recognized the pain in that silence. His fingers pressed firm against the back of Harry’s neck. A tether to keep him there, present, so he didn’t drown.
“You aren’t to blame Draco.” Harry using his first name caused him to clench his fists. His fingers dug into his palms and he stood abruptly.
Draco laughed. “Careful, Potter. Or I’ll really make you wish you didn’t work tomorrow.” It was the sort of challenge he’d have thrown around in school. Harry’s gaze sharpened and the biting retort he would have given back then only pulled his lips tight across his teeth. It was a grim smile, one he wasn’t used to seeing, and one Draco looked away from. It was too determined for the soft buzz of the night around them.
He let the buzz of three drinks carry him. He wanted to slink away and nurse his wounds, like any other night, but wherever The Boy Who Lived was the world revolved around him.
“Inmate, that is a strike. Visiting privileges are suspended.”
“Outside of school?”
“Lucius.” Harry pressed his hand against Draco’s back, an anchor, before he stepped forward, between Draco and his father. “You should remember why you’re here and why you aren’t rotting somewhere less comfortable.”
Draco didn’t have traditions anymore or a life plan. But he did have a routine. It involved drinking, visiting his mother, and necking with Harry.
“Yes, yes. Of course.” Lucius grasped the letter, his fingers a vice grip around the paper. “It’s better that way.”
Every drink slid down his throat and settled warm inside him. Fuel to his already crackling flame. Someone said something funny and Draco was rolling. The tears collecting in his eyes swept away in the laughter until he blinked and Harry swam to the surface. Of course, he was there. Draco rarely ever got what he wanted without Potter ruining it.
Harry said nothing, he was grateful. Harry took his hand and squeezed, eventually pulling him into a hug, full bodied, and tinged with relief. Whatever this was, he didn't want to lose it.
“How have you been?” Harry winced after the words left his mouth.
At the same time, he began to stroke his hand along his cock with sure even movements. Maybe it was a trauma response to get off to the guy he hated most, whose life he saw twist from tragic to triumph. A life Draco didn’t deserve but wanted. Draco sometimes saw his life play out with Harry as his friend, wondered what could have been, and stroked himself faster to the thought of Harry sucking him off.
His mother merely hummed and sipped from her tea again. After a moment, she spoke over the rim. “Oh, and don’t forget to write to your father, dear. He said he misses you.”
Draco shrugged. He didn’t believe him.“Why don’t you just find out who it is? From what I remember, that's what you and your little band of followers lived for.”
Harry sighed and got up too. He looked defeated and Draco wanted to know why. He stilled as Harry just stared at him. A cutting kind of defiance in his eyes, even a little accusatorial.
Draco ignored the questions in that tone—of if he was okay, what did need—because he didn't know yet. He was grateful, because Harry was there, not pushing, just there.
He was still processing everything. The numbness was there and while he wanted to wash it away with his forget-me elixirs, Draco merely shrugged. “Don’t apologize. However we got there, it needed to happen...I just couldn’t do it on my own, so thank you.” He knew once the numbness went away the ache would hurt. Lucius had no power over him anymore though, Draco hoped that meant the ache would lessen.
Harry shook his head sharply. “I never want that.”
The familiar hatred welled up in him but quickly washed away as he saw Harry's bunched shoulders. If Draco hadn't spent a lot of his time studying Harry, he would take the tense posture and hard set of his jaw as confirmation that this was a fight, but Draco was always stealing glances. He’d watched Harry in school, less often as they got older, but Draco was always more observant than him, even when he pretended to ignore what was right in front of him. Harry looked prepared to watch him apparate away.
Harry said it so softly. The words exhausted as they fell from his mouth.
He wasn’t making this easy and noted it in the tight grip Harry had on his glass. For his part, Draco took another sip from his and made it a point to check his watch. He had better things to do with his night than spend it rehashing old memories.
Instead, Draco sighed and sat down, facing away. He was tired of running and ignoring his issues. Tired of denying himself a future. Turning his head, not enough to glance back at Harry but enough that his soft words could be heard.
Thinking about it was a little daunting, a touch humiliating for him, but Harry looked at him like he was the smartest person he knew, aside from Hermoine. While Harry had talked him into finishing school, Draco had talked Harry into taking a full sabbatical from auror training.
Draco cleared his throat and Harry’s expression twisted. He knew Harry had something he wanted to say. Instead, he turned and went to rifle through the kitchen. Draco wanted to push at it, force him to say what he was thinking—that Draco was unwelcome and annoying and needed to leave him the fuck alone.
Draco forced a smile.
It was usually the same conversation. The same memories played over and over again. His mother had been on a loop since his father was sent to Azkaban. They had a falling out long before that, but Malfoys didn’t divorce, and somewhere in her, he knew she still loved him. Even after everything; the fall from grace, the punishment, the cowardice. Whatever his mother saw in Lucius, Draco couldn’t see.
“I’m glad you took my advice, he’s a very handsome boy. A little too thin, like you, but very lovely.” She paused, took a sip of her tea, and set her cup down. Her hand reached over to him and she gave his fingers a squeeze. “How could I object to someone who loves you as much as I do.”
It was a hate fantasy and Draco had learned to accept hate as perfect fuel for his fantasies. It didn’t take him long to spill over his fingertips, to stain his briefs, and he blamed it on the illicit nature of it all. The normal shame at getting off to Harry wasn’t even below the surface. Draco had gone through most of the roster of his schoolmates, Harry included, so he’d come to terms with it.
His fingers whitened as he tightened his grip on Harry’s shoulders to pry him a little apart. Harry was motionless in his grip. The dim light made it difficult for him to see. The wet glint from Harry’s eyes gave nothing away except his attention. It fixed on Draco, too aware for Draco not to flinch under it. Draco was a coward and under Harry’s intense gaze it was hard not to be one. But his voice didn’t waver, except as it fell away in quiet fear at the end.
Harry bore it well enough, a grimaced smile on his face while his eyes dodged around in search of an out. That was Draco’s queue to leave. Slipping some money on the bar, he sidled off his stool. He should have known the motion would attract attention. Harry looked too much like a wounded animal, face on the verge of panic, when their eyes met. Sour apple green and rimmed with nothing but sleeplessness and apathy. They weren’t far off from what Draco remembered. The apathy was new, but not being the saviour of the world every year probably led to a less exciting life.
Draco brought his glass the rest of the way to his lips and finished it off. He had no intention of catching Potter’s attention. The war had ended with clear winners and his lot had fallen far. It burned. Losing always did. Although, a year of running after the war, another year of courtrooms and plea deals, and a few more years of current listlessness helped ease that burn. All that was left was the gaping wound of a destroyed family and a mountain of shame.
Draco felt Harry come first. Felt the warm squeeze of him as Draco thrust, felt the even hotter burst of cum that landed between them, and allowed himself to finally believe this could work between them. He came with a groan, heard Harry’s answering own, and almost wanted to stay curled in their mess after. They didn't. After wiping himself and Harry clean, he returned to bed.
It was a fun distraction for them both. Draco still hated him and Harry needed the practice. They kissed in the bar alley most nights, stumbled back to Harry’s flat, and Draco often woke to an empty bed and the smell of generic shampoo on the sheets.
Draco watched the many emotions contort Lucius' face. Almost saw the acceptance, the acknowledgment of what he’d done, what he continued to do—to Draco, Narcissus, and himself. They were trapped in a never ending cycle of pain and loss because Lucius would not let go of what he thought they should be. They were Malfoy’s, but Draco was past caring what that meant. Lucius had to move past it too.
“Tell them to bugger off then. You’re about the only one who could get away with it.”
“Sounds like none of them took.”
Another, just of Dumbledore, made him pause. Draco grimaced and flipped it to face the wall, a soft “hmph” from it ignored as he walked toward Potter’s room. It was definitely rude to snoop in Harry’s room, but he was bored, and a little spiteful.
After a while, they left in silence. The sun was set and the lights of the manor cast a glow upon the grounds. Harry knocked his elbow into his and Draco looked over.
“And you don’t want that, your face splashed all over?”
Harry’s torn robes piled onto the floor while Draco fit his hands over skin. There were some new bruises since last time, maybe from what brought Harry here, wounded and raw, but Harry looked at him with red-rimmed eyes. The haunted vacant stare replaced with a need that Draco didn’t know if he could meet. He tried.
He was done with giving up. There was still a lot of life for him to live and he was going to try and live it as best he could. He smacked Harry’s ass and hurried out of the shower at the sharp protest. A laugh jumped out of him while he toweled off.  He looked back and met Harry’s rueful gaze. He’d try over and over if it meant it led him here, back to Harry Potter.
It had to have been the sugar overload of ice cream and cake for dinner, the subsequent food coma that followed, and the unbelievable frotting and eventual blowjob, courtesy of his very own lovely mouth, that caused him to say yes.
“I’m not—” He cut his words off after processing what she said. Draco had never been in love, a few crushes in school, but those derailed not long after he became a real life villain. He’d purposefully stayed away from romance or examining any of his feelings, so how could he judge if he was in love?
He closed his eyes and relaxed into it.
“How are you today, mother?”
Harry smiled and shrugged. “I think it’s the whole orphan thing. Mothers can’t get enough.”
Harry fiddled with his empty glass. It was awkward, of course it was. The last he’d seen of him, Draco’s family had left the Great Hall amid the victory celebrations and never looked back. Draco didn’t hate Harry, not like he did when they were still in school and enemies. It was laughable, the things he thought were reasons to hate him; a half-blood, muggle-raised, and too self-righteous by half and completely uninterested in Draco’s friendship. Malfoy’s always got what they wanted and if they didn’t they just bought it. But, there Harry was, eyes the size of saucers taking in Hogwarts and completely unimpressed with what Draco offered.
Draco stepped into the cell, while a guard stood outside to supervise, and Draco swept his eyes over the familiar surroundings. Piercing blue eyes met his gaze and Draco fought not to become the 11 year old boy he used to be. Ever eager to please and desperate to be acknowledged.
His fingers pushed at Harry’s body until he fell onto the bed in a trembling heap. Draco was soon over him, mouth meeting his over and over until his lips felt raw. He kept running his hands along Harry’s naked body, touching all the soft places and tracing all the scars. Eventually, his mouth followed suit. Harry’s arm flung across his face, hiding, and more silent tears streamed along his cheeks. Draco pulled away and almost asked what was wrong, but Harry gripped his hair and Draco continued.
Harry didn’t rankle, only shook his head. “Well, if you’re such an expert on how to get on with life, what do you do?”
Not knowing how to respond, Draco drank his tea as well. His mother’s gaze rested on him and her eyebrows lifted imperceptibly. There was something almost shrewd and thoughtful as she looked. He cleared his throat and lifted his shoulders in a nonchalant shrug. “He was as unkempt as ever. I don’t think he knows what personal hygiene is. Living with all those muggles and such.”
–––––
“Shove off, Potter! I don’t need you!” He pushed and Harry released him. He was on the floor with a thud. People were staring but Draco wasn’t paying attention to them. He was on the ground and staring up at Harry. His vision swam and his eyes closed. It felt nice to close his eyes. It made the lighting in his veins shudder to a low hum. Somewhere someone touched him. Hands curled around his arm and waist and lifted him up. Draco sagged against the warmth. It was too hot, his face was flushed, and he was vaguely aware of the sweat that dripped down his back.
A laugh bubbled from him, too loud and off for the moment. Tears formed and he wiped them away before they turned into something more. “Don’t joke, Lucius. You’ve never been that funny.”
Harry stared at his arm long enough that the back of Draco’s neck prickled. He pulled his arm back and green eyes lifted to meet his. Shame, hot and ugly spiked down his throat. It was his daily reminder to not forget who he was.
Draco bared his teeth but it had no menace. Not when he was currently fighting to keep his eyes open and bile down his throat.
Lucius opened his mouth to get out another nasty barb but Harry was on him in a second. Draco watched as Harry shoved him, turned him around to face Draco, and then swept him to his knees. The resounding crack of bone on concrete hurt even him, but the suddenness of it left Lucius and Draco abnormally silent.
Draco’s hands were shoved into his jacket. While Harry’s tie hung loose and in disarray around his neck. The light outside the pub was dim. Diagon Alley; a ghost town on a weeknight.
“I don’t want to splinch you, so just hold still.”
Lucius received a thin lipped reply from him. Draco’s visits were not for Lucius’ benefit, but for his mother. Prison had shown how truly cruel his father could be. The only way he’d write to her was if Draco personally came to receive the letters. Draco had put that demand to the test, but he’d seen how his mother wilted when he’d held off on a visit for a few days. Draco couldn’t handle any more haunted looks, so he visited.
“Well, because...I can’t not do something...I was really bad after, you know...Ron and Hermione helped, but they had to force me to get out of the house—my room.”
He didn’t own a lot. The place was clean but chaotic. The kitchen had some dirty dishes in the sink, which Draco charmed clean before he realized what he was doing. From his brief inspection, they looked secondhand, with a few chips along the edges. The rest of the cupboards were bare of food aside from saltines and a few canned goods. The couch he’d slept on, while leaving a crick in his neck, was comfortable with years of use. It again looked secondhand, one cushion had a well worn impression in it. The shelves were dusty and stuffed with books and knick knacks and pictures.
“I don’t need your fucking forgiveness or pity Potter!” The words ripped from him in a scathing retort and he blinked back the tears that blurred his vision.
Draco ignored the red rimmed eyes and sallow cast to Harry’s skin, would rather chalk it up to Harry being abysmal at trivia than the tale-tell signs of someone running on fumes. He had perfected the art of ignoring problems.
“Oh, I’m sure he’s found him,” Blaise drawled suggestively, making Pansy snort next to him.
“You’re hard,” Draco declared, eyes stuck on the dick.
“God, do you know how good you look on your knees like that?” He murmured. Draco blushed, looking away from the intense eye contact, standing up and turning around. He sat back down onto Harry’s lap, this time arching his back and grinding his hips reverse-cowgirl so that his lover could get a good look at the ass that he was obsessed with.
Harry left open mouth kisses along the arm now clinging to his shoulder, then looked into Draco’s pale eyes. “Good boy,” He leered, quickening his strokes and pressing down on Draco’s prostate, causing the other boy to choke on his own spit. “You wanna cum?”
to be fucking kidding me,”
It immediately became high-stakes between them as neither had any real desire for more money and both had a strong motivation to get one up on the other. Draco sat back, face cold and focused, reviewing his cards with Blaise hanging off one shoulder and Pansy the other. Five spades. A straight flush. Draco resisted the urge to smile and looked back up at his opponent, making eye contact with brilliant green.
“I’ve been looking forward to this all week,” Harry said in a low tone, a hand coming up to play with the hair on the back of Draco’s head. Draco placed a hand on the Gryffindor’s chest, giving a slight push to allow himself to walk Harry backwards towards the bed.
The third:
. Not so big that it would cause too much pain or not be able to even fit, but a good seven inches with a lovely girth that Draco could just imagine would fill him so well. The uncircumcised head peaked out from the smooth foreskin, practically begging for Draco to take it into his mouth. It made his cheeks flush and his length strain against his towel. And then he realised.
After a moment, he finally responded, “Where did that come from?”
Harry hurried forward and gripped his mother’s hand with a warm fervor, like a puppy seeking affection. It would have made Draco laugh if he wasn’t so nervous. Harry’s bright green eyes cut over to him and a sudden but growing fondness fluttered through him. An answering smile pulled itself across his lips, a quick glance over to his mother and he caught her sharp knowing gaze.
His hands were careful as they slid over bruises. Careful until Harry growled for him to hurry. Draco was caught between awe and unrelenting need. He fumbled with his wand and a quick spell to conjure up some lube. The mess was worth it for the way Harry’s breath hitched and he rocked into Draco’s fingers.
He kept laughing, but buried it into one of the cushions on the couch he’d fallen on. Soft footfalls drifted around him and away. Draco turned his head and caught the faint outline of Harry as he slipped down a dark hallway. He heard a sigh and felt something fall over him but then it all blurred to blackness.
It wasn't until the lights were off that they talked. The darkness hid some of their tears but none of the fears. The talking eased some of them. Harry drifted off first, tired and spent from the night. Left with his thoughts, Draco knew neither of them were fixed. He wasn't sure they could be, but it was better, having him there.
“If the chat doesn’t involve the use of the owl or mother’s letter, we have nothing further to discuss.”
“I know.”
The bed was unmade. The blankets bunched up and looked like they’d been tossed to one side of the bed in frustration. He edged closer to the side where Harry slept, the pillows still had the impression of his head on them.
Draco watched Harry’s hand drop like a lead weight and fingers grip the edge of the table. His lips pressed into a thin line but Draco shifted to sit down slowly again. If Harry wanted to talk he would have to be the one to do it. Draco did not have any demons he needed to chase. He raised his eyebrows, giving his best
Harry paused in front of him. Draco lifted one light eyebrow in question.
Draco’s jaw clenched. His mother held on to her sanity with wisp like strength. The longer his father was imprisoned the more she slipped away. Watching her disappear made him hate Lucius. Draco carried that hate, dripping with shame for being Lucius’ son—for being exactly like him—and it burned like a scalding wound, forever tender and unhealed.
Harry didn’t say anything. The bed shifted beside him, Draco reached out and brushed Harry's hand. "I'm sorry I was such a prat in school to you."
“Sir, what would you like to do?” the guard asked.
The rest of the conversation faded once he apparated home.
She set her tea down demurely and smoothed out a non existent wrinkle on her lap. “Although your father knows otherwise, he was not the only boy I happened to have fun with.”
“Sure you can’t stay out longer?”
Draco wasn’t sure what life without Lucius would be like, knew he'd have to find some way to deal with the grief of it, for now he settled for holding Harry’s hand in his. A tether of warmth.
The following Tuesday, when he entered and headed to his usual stool, there were not-so-oblivious green eyes trained on him. Potter never took a hint. Somehow, Draco found himself sitting across from him. It wasn’t by choice.
But Harry brought back a big bowl of popcorn instead. He settled on the couch in the space Draco had left open. He was mollified as Harry offered him some. They ate and guessed different trivia questions. Despite having lived with muggles, Harry was horrid at it.
Sometimes Draco would apparate to Harry’s flat and laze around all day, continue his winning streak on muggle trivia, wank in Harry’s bed, and scrounge through what little food the other had. Harry, for his part, would always ask what Draco was doing, make a noncommittal sound, look for something to eat—see Draco finished off the last of his food—and would order takeout for them both.
Instead, Drake’s fingers gripped tighter around Harry. He wasn’t fragile and Draco was sure he could never break him. But Harry slumped against him with the fervor of someone desperately screaming for help. Draco had been there. And Harry had been the one to slowly pull him out of the permafrost of his life.
“I saw Harry Potter recently.” The name dropping was usual fodder, but Draco wished he could take back that particular name. Rather than frown, like Draco expected, Narcissa just inclined her head slightly and a corner of her mouth drifted upward into a light smile.
He sat up and blinked his eyes open enough to regret every decision he’d ever made. A soft clink of glasses knocking together made him wince and he growled out through clenched teeth, “Potter can you please be quiet. My head is about to explode.” In a dramatic fashion, because Draco always pictured his death to be dramatic, he fell back to the couch and covered his face with his arm.
Draco was shaking by the time he apparated to Knockturn Alley. A sudden sick wave of shame and need filled him. What he needed was a fix. A forget-me elixir in the form of magic and drugs—easy enough to procure.
Then, fresh air, a light misting, and Draco opened his eyes. London was always raining, but tonight the mist was gentle and felt good against his feverish skin. He heard a grunt and felt himself press back against a brick wall. Squinting, Draco watched as Harry fumbled to pull out his wand.
Draco stopped going to the bar after that. It rankled him to be forced away from one of the only places he enjoyed and by Potter no less. Even when he’d pried every last piece of him from his life, he somehow managed to ooze his way back in. Harry was a shadow that clouded everything. Even in the Malfoy mansion, glittery and sterile, the whisper of what happened remained.
“I have a thing for sons anyways.”
He didn’t make it to Azkaban and Harry was late.
“I don’t really recall you being a poster boy for following the rules, Potter.”
Draco wanted him to do or say something, get angry, shove him and tell him to piss off, anything that would have him reacting to Draco the way he was used to. Instead, Harry laughed at his jokes, held his arm when stumbled, and even tossed blankets on him when he crashed for the nth time on his couch.
There was no pretense in his words. Draco was in love with him. He spoke the words against Harry’s temple, spoke them like a spell, like he could give himself over to Harry in all the ways that mattered. So Harry could see how he was consumed. The petty, ugly, childhood crush he’d had exploded and burned away into this.
Harry snorted and hooked his arm around Draco’s waist. Draco let himself be pulled. His hands found the edge of Harry’s shirt and eased upward until he could touch skin. Goosebumps rose beneath his fingers and he smiled, pleased.
“Draco, hey—” Harry kept some space between them, cautious. Draco had never seen him so cautious, like he was dealing with a wounded animal.
“Potter are you going to speak or just sit there like a mute?” The words tumbled out dripping with condescension. They were back at Hogwarts and Draco was bating, to get one more word in, one more second of the great Boy Who Lived’s time. Harry glanced up then, fingers stilling on his glass.
Harry slipped away after some time to the bathroom and his mother turned to him. She was hawkish in her movement and Draco remembered how bright and fierce she used to be.
Because it was his place, Draco went back to the bar to drink again the next day. There were no more Potter sightings. His shoulders relaxed. Drinking always tasted better alone.
“How do you think?” His tone was more brittle than he intended, but Draco willed the time and distance of their lives to hide it. Harry didn’t know the Draco of today, or then, and it was the only thing that allowed him to swallow down emotions he was definitely not going to examine.
“Hey, it’s Harry Potter!”
It turned wry after a moment. “Isn’t it your bedtime now? Don’t want you showing up late to your little auror friends.”
Harry was nothing like him.
Draco tossed the book he’d been skimming to the side. His eyes wandered to the clock again. It was half past one. Usually he’d be asleep by now or down some rabbit hole project, but Harry had agreed to come over after his shift. He wasn’t known for being on time, so Draco wasn’t worried, but usually there was a call or an owl, something that said he would be late.
He sighed and nodded. “Yeah, I guess. But, I’m almost through with the program. They’ll send me on my first assignment soon.”
Draco needed Harry’s touch and needed to touch Harry.
Harry shuddered out a breath as Draco thrusted. He eased in every inch of himself and then began a slow methodical movement. One that left him shaking. It was a test of will, to stay slow, to feel Harry beneath. It wasn’t until Harry pulled him down for a kiss, hot and desperate, that he thrust faster.
Morning light filtered across the back of his eyelids first. A bright annoyance that had Draco groaning. His body felt heavy and ached as it woke him. There was noise coming from what sounded like the kitchen. The sound of someone trying to be quiet but failing because Draco seemed to hear even the tiniest of sounds. It was all too much.
Draco was not going to have small talk with Harry. His grip tightened on his glass and he began to stand to leave.
Harry sagged into him. Draco caught his weight and took it with open softness. Somewhere in the crying, Harry’s tears hot on his neck and snot setting into his sweater, Draco began to whisper. Platitudes of “You’re okay. You’re okay, shh” a stream of consciousness. He soothed in the way he always wanted to be comforted.
“Ah, sorry.”
“Whaddyadoin?” It was getting harder to talk and Draco’s mouth tasted like cotton. He smacked his mouth together and attempted to push off the wall and away from Harry.
. Draco did not need to be saved.
Lucius kept talking—undaunted by the lack of response, “How is your mother?”
“Your mother gave me two tickets to the cup this year.”
This was the most Draco had seen of Harry's body since they started this. Rather than excitement, Draco was struck by how small and bruised Harry really looked. Maybe Draco had ignored it. No, Draco knew he willingly chose not to know. Guilt swept through him. He was selfish using Harry for his own personal catharsis.
“Fuck. No wonder you turned into such a wash.”
“I hope you are not suggesting I have some sort of dalliance with Harry Potter!” Some things were unfathomable and that was one of them.
“Wait—!”
Narcissus shot her son a knowing look and continued on with Harry’s Quidditch reverie. Draco had no idea his mother kept up with anything related to Quidditch or the news for that matter. Apparently, the Cannons were the expected winners of the cup this year. He tuned some of it out and went between staring too long at Harry, to realizing he was staring too long, to hastily looking away.
He peered closer at the pictures, noting the Weasley family and Granger in most of them. Some with the gamekeeper, Hagrid, and Professor Mcgonagall stared back at him as they smiled next to Harry. It looked like he was celebrating a birthday.
The powder was a baby blue. It looked like sugar and tasted like rain. When Draco took it, everything melted away and left him feeling like an electric current. Giddiness enveloped him, and high off the buzz, he wound his way back to his bar. Because it was his bar, not any of the other forlorn patrons, or stupid fucking Harry Potter’s.
Draco sidestepped the fact that he would not be following him home tonight. Tomorrow was his Azkaban day and he’d rather not subjugate anyone else to that horror show. Not to mention, the thought of Harry seeing his father in there, the
Harry wasn’t shy. 6 years in classes together and he’d watched him speak out of turn countless times. Harry made it known what he thought, so Draco wanted to scoff at the shy act. He watched him swallow and take several quick drinks.
The urge to react spitefully surged through him. "Sorry for being concerned. Next time I'll remember that the great Harry Potter doesn't need anyone's help!”
Harry’s eyebrows pinched together and he had the audacity to look upset. “Oh, yeah...I think someone in my class is taking secret photos and sending them to the Prophet.
–––––
Draco’s lips pursed. Looking at his father’s narcissistic grin, the contempt in his eyes, Draco wondered if he ever loved anyone other than himself. “If you want us to leave, we will.”
“We’ve all grown up since school, you know. And I know you can’t wait to speak to Hermoine. No one talks as much about magical theory as you two. Why didn’t I know you were such a nerd?”
“There we go,” Malfoy tucks the cravat into Harry’s robes and smoothes his hands down Harry’s chest in a perfunctory fashion, making gooseflesh erupt all over Harry’s arms.
Harry nods woodenly. Manages a “You too,” before he turns and leaves.
Harry's dulled emerald gaze traverses my gilded edges, soft nostalgia edged with profound grief writ across his face. I do not know what he saw in me, all those years back. Such is my magic – private. I wonder if the shape of his soul has changed, if he will see a different reflection now, all these years later.
The main doors open just then. Harry looks up, gut tightening. Dressed in peacock blue with hints of dark green, Draco looks gorgeous. Harry’s nerves calm for a second as he takes in the familiar sight – despite everything, Draco feels like home. And then Draco’s eyes find his and the nerves are back tenfold.
Draco’s heart is beating a million miles a minute. He takes a step towards Harry. “Oh, I don’t know. I think it’s endearing.”
“So, that’s it then?” he asks, even though he knows the answer.
A moment passes. The silence between them stretches and swells, the din of the nearby party falling away.
“Draco,” Harry whispers, giving up on a heartfelt speech and letting the one word encompass everything he’s feeling.
“Thrilling that you’ve been keeping count,” Harry mumbles into his glass before taking a healthy swig. Malfoy’s right and Harry knows it. He’s tried everything — polite non-answers, straightforward “no comments”, pointed silence, and even snarled insults to leave him the fuck alone. None of it worked. This might just be his only option. No, it
He’s sweating under his oppressive formal robes and the champagne he’s been dutifully sipping is far too citrusy for his liking. He’s more of a butterbeer kind of guy, if he’s being perfectly honest, but butterbeer isn’t near classy enough. So, champagne it is.
Slowly, a smile blooms over Draco’s face, his body relaxing. “I’ve been told I’m high maintenance,” he says slightly breathlessly.
The door opens again some time later. Harry is back, but he hasn’t come alone. There is another man with him, unfamiliar to me. He is all sharp angles, pale skin and pale hair. As soon as he catches sight of me, his nostrils flare, grey eyes flinty. “What the fuck do you think you’re doing, Harry?” he asks harshly.
When they land on Harry's doorstep, Malfoy shoots him a curious look. His hand still rests on Harry's back — once he had answered all the questions he intended to, he'd neatly stepped back from the gaggle of reporters and Apparated them to Grimmauld right then and there.
Tugging uncomfortably at his collar, Harry surreptitiously looks around the room for the fifth time. Just as he’s resigning himself to an agonising night with no respite in sight, his eyes light upon platinum blonde hair.
“You’ll have to make another one now,” he says.
Draco says nothing as he watches Harry complete the final few stages of the process. Harry shapes the mug to his satisfaction – so much better than the one currently sitting in Draco’s kitchen cupboard – and sets it to the side to dry out. He moulds the handle from a long piece of clay and attaches it to the body of the mug wandlessly. Finally, he glazes the mug. Draco’s heart stutters when he sees the colour – emerald green.
Too much, it’s all far too much. Harry has never been good with dealing with the press, and he’s out of practice now. The flashes blind him and the questions echo oddly in his head. His chest burns with every sip of air he struggles to take.
Draco arches one unimpressed eyebrow. “Obviously, Potter. I meant why are you here?”
“No, you did rather well,” Draco murmurs, genuine under the banter.
Harry is making a mug for Draco. For the first time since Harry started working, Draco takes his eyes off Harry’s hands and looks at his face. Harry’s expression is calm, his posture relaxed. He’s absorbed in his work.
“Yes,” Harry agrees. “I got what I needed. But what about what I want?”
Harry relaxes for the first time that evening, his shoulders dropping as he takes in a lungful of the crisp night air.
"Mr. Potter, sir, did Ginevra Weasley leave you because you're interested in men?"
“That bad tonight?” Draco asks sympathetically.
The small smile on Draco’s face undercuts his exasperated tone. “I could only take so much of you whinging on about the drinks selection at these things.”
The questions come hurtling at them from all sides, accompanied by bursts of camera flashes. Most of them are directed towards Harry.
The clay begins to take shape. Draco sucks in a sharp breath as he realises what Harry is making.
It’s been a while since he’s had any good reason to attend a Ministry function, but Harry’s been to enough of them to detest the entire enterprise. He’d much rather make his donations from the safety and privacy of his own home, thank you very much. So it’s with no small amount of trepidation that Harry enters the ballroom with Malfoy on his arm.
People immediately take notice, the whispers spreading like wildfire. Harry can already feel a headache building.
Listening to the Prime Minister drone on about the value of the British pound and how it could potentially affect wizarding currency, Harry is reminded of Draco’s suggestion.
“It’s not right,” Harry splutters as Draco drags him out of the restaurant and into the bustle of King’s Street. They’re both rather unsteady after one drink too many, so it’s a miracle they don’t fall over. “Britain’s national dish should be
An uncertain look crosses Draco’s face before he takes a deep breath. Harry feels his smile slipping.
The sun filters in through large windows, its path disrupted in various places by shelves filled with assorted claywares. Draco quietly marvels at the impressive range of objects on display – shallow bowls, vases with intricate designs, creatively crafted plates, dainty tea sets – all with unique designs.
It’s been years since I saw him last, but I recognise him. The same unkempt hair, those familiar round glasses slightly crooked from being mended one too many times, and of course, that lightning bolt scar. Harry Potter has come to visit me again.
“Attending the ball?” Harry attempts feebly. He hadn’t bothered to think of exactly what he would say to Draco. Not one of his finest ideas, in retrospect.
He hears an annoyed huff from near the doorway before Malfoy comes to stand behind him.
“It’s a mutually beneficial arrangement, Potter,” Malfoy insists.
“This,” he says, heart pounding but voice sure. He squeezes Draco’s hands once. “For real this time.”
And it’s presumptuous and risky, but this is Harry – presumptuous and risky is practically his love language. Heart in his throat, Draco takes a few more steps and comes around the workstation to Harry’s side. He reaches out and cradles Harry’s hands in his own, hoping Harry can’t feel their slight tremor. Harry watches with wide eyes as Draco brings his hands up slowly, so that Harry can draw back if he wants to. He doesn’t.
Draco nods. “And as part of your job, you meet with the Muggle Prime Minister every month. What if,” he leans forward, grey eyes alight with mischief, “you were to cast a Suggestion Spell on him? Just a small one, to plant an idea in his head, nothing more.”
“You want the media to stop hounding you about your love life and I want to not be undesirable number one,” he continues. “It’s a simple equation, Potter, put the two together and the solution is obvious.”
They don’t stay for too long – Harry had been adamant on no more than an hour and a half and was surprised when Malfoy had agreed without any complaints.
Draco leads the way, resting one hand on Harry’s lower back, expertly fielding away anyone who approaches them with a disarming smile and murmured apologies. He opens the balcony doors with a flourish that makes Harry laugh and ushers Harry through before shutting them firmly.
Something cold and heavy sinks into Harry’s stomach, replacing the tentative warmth that was glowing through him not a minute ago. Of course. In between all the touching and the endearments and Malfoy’s surprisingly considerate nature, Harry had somehow managed to forget that this was all a show.
“Relax,” Draco murmurs, interrupting Harry’s spiralling. His hand comes up to cover Harry’s where it’s clenching the railing. Harry hadn’t even realised he was doing that. “Breathe, Harry.” Draco’s thumb brushes the back of Harry’s hand and he focuses on that point of contact.
playing a prank on the Prime Minister.”
"Mr. Potter, are you courting Draco Malfoy?"
Harry grins and presses a kiss to Draco’s cheek as he sets a teacup in front of him.
“Darling,” he whispers. A request and a reassurance.
Draco closes the paperback book, and Harry’s head cocks to get a good look at it.
And Ginny survived this without a scratch? Or was this her doing?
They don’t talk. The whirr of the wheel fills the silence between them. It's not tense or expectant. It just is. Harry continues to mould the clay and Draco continues to breathe.
Draco smiles, his face awash with a contentment I rarely get to see. He pulls Harry in for a kiss, familiar and intimate.
Carefully, he flicks a piece of lint off his robes.
“That wasn’t so bad actually,” Harry tells Malfoy as they walk towards a secluded part of the lawns to Apparate home. Their respective homes, obviously.
Harry wonders, not for the first time. He’s surrounded by vaguely important people, all talking at him with the feigned nonchalance of those who are working very hard to not seem sycophantic – and failing miserably at it. On balance, Harry prefers the gushing fans, thank you very much. At least they don’t have any hidden agendas.
his only option.
That is the last time I see Harry Potter.
A pained noise escapes him. His face crumples before me and his eyes shine with unshed tears. He lifts a shaking hand towards me, almost touching my surface, but then withdraws before he can make contact. His hand moves towards his chest. He’s still looking at my reflection, but his hand presses into his chest. I see his fingers trace the shape of a ring pressing through his shirt.
“Please, Potter, we both know who the smart one is in this relationship and it certainly isn’t you,” Draco says, smirking.
Harry covers the clay with his hands, pressing oh-so-gently in all the right places. His brown skin is covered with flecks of the greyish clay he’s using. Draco doesn’t move his eyes from Harry’s hands; he couldn’t even if he tried.
Harry squints at him, trying to sort out what Draco means through the haze of alcohol currently clouding his judgement. “I am,” he confirms warily, still none the wiser about where this is headed.
“We’ll have a drink, or shitty takeout, or bloody tea for all I care. You don’t even have to come to mine, I’ll take you out to a cafe or something, whatever you want. Just as long as it’s not a Ministry function.”
deep within them. Draco pulled back from the kiss to gasp words, interrupted by Harry pressing him back against his lips over and over. “Clothes,”
“Piss off,” Draco looked up the ceiling, obviously embarrassed. Harry faltered.
“Say my name,” Harry demanded. His earlier teasing tone had left and now he was looking at Draco like he wanted to break him apart and put him back together again.
“No,” And Draco couldn’t see the his face as he shifted head into the blonde’s neck. “Say my actual name. My first name,”
“A bet’s a bet, Potter, and I’m going to pay up,” And with that Draco stradeled Harry’s lap up on the bed, paled hands landing on his shoulders as his hips started to slowly roll against the other’s. Harry reached up again to try and take hold of Draco’s hips, to guide his movements so that he could feel his length against his crack. But yet again his hands were pushed away.
He at first was content with simply enjoying the way he stroked his own length, the way the warm water felt on his naked body, but before long his mind began to wander. Between different people. To one specific person. To one specific Gryffindor with dark skin and toned forearms who would look absolutely delightful with his mouth stuffed full of Draco’s cock. “Oh go-
Draco felt his mouth water at the sight of Harry’s cock. It was
“I’m going to have to make sure to cover up this mark, wanker, you bit me in the most obvious place,” He gingerly removed himself from Harry’s lap, pushing his drooping fringe back from his face.
Harry just nodded, shrugging as if what he had requested wasn’t downright dirty. Draco huffed and looked back down at his cards to maintain his over-confident exterior. “Fine,” It wasnt like he hadn’t done embarrassing things with Potter before.
Harry huffed before pulling Draco back into himself, mouth landing sloppy kisses to Draco’s neck and chest. “How are you so goddamn pretty, hm?” He mumbled, then circled his tongue around the blonde’s nipple and sucking lightly. Draco hissed as his hips jolted forward. The other laughed, obviously a bit surprised, before cocking his head against Draco’s collar bone. “Sensitive, Malfoy?”
“Well- pllftkt,” The blonde spluttered as his mind and heart still raced a mile a minute. “Were you not gonna say something? No ‘heads up, Malfoy, I can see your dick’? You just came in here and watched me masturbate? What are you, a fucking pervert?!” Accusations came thick and fast as Draco found his footing in an old habit: blaming Harry Potter for everything bad that happens to him. “Freak!”
“Thank you for making me give you a lap dance,” At this point Harry was now controlling the pace of their grinding, thrusting up in slow, dirty rolls if his hips. “And tell me how much you love this dick,”
He felt warm breathe fanned out across his face (Draco thought he might actually burn up from the inside with how hot he felt) as Harry drew closer to him. “D’you like it when I tell you what a
, perfect, cum for me now,”
Just as all hell started to break lose between the two opposing houses, Harry nodded and spoke up. “Alright,” Ron’s mouth fell open and he gave his friend a look of complete betrayal which Harry waved off before leaning over the table, taking a hold of Draco’s loosened tie to pull him in closer and mutter into his ear.
At this point Harry was whining for his trousers to be taken off, all “please” and “c’mon Draco” and “fuck, it hurts” and so Draco obliges and dropped down from his very nice seat on Harry’s lap to his knees in between his legs. He undid the belt and unzipped the fly, all the while looking up intensely at Harry while he in turn was gazing in a lust-stained haze. He allowed Draco to pull the offending garment off of his legs and watched, strained, as he ran his hands up his legs, rubbing small circles into his thighs.
“Mhmm,” Draco hummed stupidly, mind clouded by lust.
“Really? Because your dick seems to like me just fine,” He pulled on the slytherin’s hips until he was grinding against Harry’s own hard on. Letting out a groan, he looked back up into Draco’s eyes. “Come on, pretty boy, let me finish what you started. Promise I’ll make you feel good,” The almost sweet words contradicted Harry’s hungry tone.
“Fuck, so good, that’s it,” Harry groaned, hands twitching as he resisted the urge to grope and fondle and slap those firm cheeks. “Its like you were made for this, so fucking good,” Draco bit his lip so he wouldn’t let out a whine at the words. He could tell Harry was getting close, that’s when he started to get talkative, and Draco’s briefs had a huge slick spot on the front where his cock was begging for release. He had no idea he would get so worked up about this.
“Shit, yeah, baby, do what you need to do,” Harry cursed, still wanting so badly to just grab Draco’s waist and roll up into him. Draco flushed and rolled his eyes. “Don’t call me baby,” He muttered as he began to litter a trail of kisses down Harry’s neck and towards his chest.
In this moment of shock and despair, Draco had three thoughts. The first:
Harry wrapped his hands around his lover’s hips and started to pound steadily into the welcoming heat wrapped around his dick. He knew from experience that at this angle he was hitting Draco’s sweet spot over and over; this was confirmed by the muffled staccato sounds he was letting out into Harry’s shoulder, having latched onto it to suck a hickey into him. They were both so close, Harry could feel Draco’s hole clenching and fluttering around him, making his cock twitch. The pace of his thrusts became unsteady, losing rhythm yet exponentially harder. He reached a hand in between the two bodies to pump Draco’s leaking length.
. “You know, just because you haven’t got your dick wet since Cho Chang dumped your sad arse doesn’t mean you can get your rocks off harassing me,” He narrowed his eyes, hitting Harry where he knew it would hurt.
Looking utterly debauched, Harry was panting against the divider. His face was flushed, stray curls sticking to his forehead with sweat, eyelids hooded as he engrossedly watched Draco’d movements. His lips hung open as unashamed, lascivious moans fell out, prioritising his pleasure over wether or not people could hear from outside the changing rooms. “
, get back to it,” Draco physically cringed in response to the pet name but instead of snarkily retorting he redoubled his efforts on Harry’s cock, powerfully sucking up and down the length and bringing his hand up to firmly stroke any uncovered skin.
“Indecent exposure and-”
1043.
He’d lived here with Ginny for
The med kit feels paltry as he digs the pouch out of the desk. A few tins of salve, a unicorn hair suture kit, and amber glass vials of SoberUp, PepperUp, and TranqDown.
She clears her throat, and Harry holds his tongue in advance, hand on the doorknob, one ear angled toward her. Waiting.
“Believe it or not, Hazza, I fully sympathize.”
Rosemary and mint drifts out on the steam, and Harry draws it in, gathering his courage.
“You got your arse kicked, so the house redecorated itself?”
Not his parents, then. One of his school friends? Pansy, Blaise, and Theo had been at Luna’s self-wedding ceremony last month, and none of them had mentioned Draco. Odd. But when was the last time anyone
“My wand has been in Ministry possession for years,” he mutters. His breath shudders in as his back arches in a long stretch. His arse grinds into the cot under him, and Harry’s mouth goes dry. “I’m going to
“Oh, fuck. Fuck fuck fuck,” Harry whimpers as Draco’s angle changes, sharper, faster, again and again; just enough, just right, just- “
The goblin lift operator looks him up and down, lingering on his pocket with the jewelry box like he can smell the gold. Maybe he can.
“Thought you said you were a vision. You sure that was an O face? Looked more like an
Harry kicks the wheeled base of the chair so the arm rams into the desk mid-spin. Jenkins’ stupid head jerks, sending a sharp flick through his sleek dishwater-blond ponytail.
The one with the boy and the falcon on the front. Number thirteen, apparently. His eyes rove down the shelf. There are so many of them, but this is the one he knows.
Harry’s tongue darts out to pick up crumbs from the corners of his lips as he climbs the stairs, expecting them to creak and earn him a full-frontal assault from a house elf. Instead, the treads are silent, and not a rustle comes from the second floor hall.
Hands pull him closer, and Harry’s fingers find Draco’s waist as Draco’s lips find Harry’s in a slow, melding kiss. Teeth nip Harry’s bottom lip, and goosebumps run down his arms. The towel falls and his nipples tighten, and Draco is everywhere. Hands around his waist and over his arse, breath against his cheek. Draco is lips, and teeth, and tongue and a whimpering moan in a wordless claim. He’s possession and welcome and need like the oncoming storm outside the window, but this tempest has already surrounded him, denied for years.
, Harry!”
“Oh, don’t worry, I’m not pregnant,” she bites off. “Fuck, it’d have to be divine intervention, wouldn’t it?”
Harry clears his throat, and the man is staring at him, because he’s Harry Fucking Potter, and he’s trying to return an engagement ring while grinning like a loon.
“Merlin’s fucking merkin,” Draco whispers, somewhere between horror and awe.
His mouth grazes the pillow under his cheek, and a moment of hesitation flits through him.
Graceful fingers smooth the soap from his chest, and Harry’s breath hitches as they slide down to cup him.
‘Reynolds’, her signature reads, despite his certainty at her surname. Rather than just sign off and hand them over to him like the other nightshift Aurors, she settles in to complete them herself.
“I’ll risk it.
The pillow in his arms holds the scent of wet earth and growing things, and for the first time in years, he dozes off with the sun warm on his skin.
It would be enough, Harry thinks; Draco tugging the skin over the head of his cock, and his tight arse clenching Harry’s fingers, and the whispered expletives over the rush of hot water falling down his back.
The wards shiver, and so does he.
“But I’m-”
Draco’s breathing is soft compared to the scratch of a half-dozen quills in unison. He’s not asleep, but Harry’s not about to call him out on his fake nap. Not as he stares at the last blanks on the form.
Three rainbow, fanned piles of paperwork, and Adams’ hands are finally empty.
“Did you ever try? After I was gone?”
Harry’s heart beats, steady and slow, against Draco's cheek, and Draco sighs again, content, and settles right in.
“Fuck if I know.” The side of his hand swipes at the blood trailing down the side of his nose from his eyebrow. “Shits and giggles. I wouldn’t credit them with much strategic planning.”
“Oh, God, please don’t. I heard Malfoy didn’t get a single lick in. Doubt I’d do much better.”
With a sigh, he rounds the corner at the top of the staircase and braces himself. Walburga merely cracks an eye open and huffs. His feet turn toward the bedroom, but he hesitates. She always knows more than she lets on.
Potter. Harry had objected to the title, but ultimately, it was the only concession Harry had ended up making. He and Ginny had always done the cleaning, cooking, gardening, and laundry, despite the house-elf’s admonitions. What Kreacher does all day is a mystery.
“Slow. The fuck. Down.”
And if it’s a side benefit that nobody on Diagon Alley spreads rumors that Harry Potter is renting a room above the Leaky, then all the better. And if it just so happens that there’s an untended nest of satin and velvet in a quiet, dark cave that he’s a little in love with, then so be it.
“What are you doing?” Harry asks, steadfastly ignoring the quickening of his heartbeat at the brief contact.
Harry makes the mistake of looking at Malfoy. Caught up in his intense gaze and feeling a little discombobulated from the restaurant, Harry freezes. His mind is still stuck on the comfort of Malfoy’s hand on his back, of his solid grip on his waist, and his feelings are a tangled mess. Some of it must be showing on Harry’s face, because Malfoy’s expression changes and he turns more fully to Harry, the beginnings of a sentence on his lips.
Harry scoffs, turning back to stare at his tumbler of whiskey — the muggle variety. He rarely visits wizarding pubs now, not unless he wants to make the front page of the Prophet and every other godforsaken wizarding tabloid.
“I agree, Harry,” Draco huffs, tucking Harry’s hand safely into his. “But there’s not much you can do about it, can you?”
“Hey,” Harry says, smiling a little at the sight of Draco in a cozy jumper bathed in warm afternoon sunlight. “Is this about the gala day after tomorrow? You think we should attend it?”
Harry’s hands are sweating and his thoughts are scrambled. He doesn’t know how to explain. He wants – so much, all of it, but he doesn’t know
As the night progresses, Harry has to admit, he’s not being tortured. It’s definitely not his idea of a fun time, but with Malfoy there, it’s at least tolerable. Each time the conversation starts heading towards Harry’s personal life, Malfoy subtly changes the topic with a well-placed enquiry.
Harry turns back to face Malfoy, raising a pointed brow. Disappointingly, Malfoy doesn’t take the bait.
All it would take is a simple spell, easily cast with just a flick of Harry’s finger. It’s not like the Prime Minister would be compelled to do anything. He could reject the suggestion if he were truly that attached to chicken tikka masala.
“If you think I’m going to tell you what I see–” he starts, addressing Harry without turning around.
Draco has not turned around and I can see the maelstrom of emotions on face. His eyes dart over my surface, before he closes them. He takes a trembling breath. “We never did finish making that beef bourguignon."
“Was your relationship with Ms. Weasley a sham?”
Harry looks at Draco for a moment and then dissolves into giggles. “You’re absolutely mad,” he declares once he’s gotten control of himself.
His stomach is a shivering ball of nerves and there’s the slightest of tremors in his hands. He could have just written a letter, or shown up at Draco’s house, but Draco likes grand gestures and Harry’s the all-in sort of guy, so here he is. Pacing.
Draco nudges his shoulder in apology. “Sorry about that, got held up by the kittens. Here,” he slips a hand into his robes and pulls out a flask. “For you,” he says, grinning mischievously.
Harry rolls his eyes, but starts to turn around. Malfoy stops him, holding onto his shoulders to make him face the mirror again.
“We knew they would stare – let them. I’ll do the talking, you try to look like you’re not being tortured,” Malfoy murmurs at his side, smiling charmingly at the guests they pass.
“And what do you want?” Draco asks finally, his voice nothing more than a whisper. His hands are restless, the tips of his fingers coming together in patterns only he’s privy to. Harry remembers Draco doing this before, when Skeeter wrote a vicious article on how “Malfoy’s Death Eater nature” was going to “corrupt our Saviour.” He remembers wanting to catch those fluttering hands in his own, to tell Draco no one listens to Skeeter anymore, tell him that he likes having Draco around and to hell with Skeeter and her ilk.
Draco missed that laugh so much.
– Malfoy had him buy for the Ministry event they’re attending tonight, along with a whole new set of dress robes.
Malfoy shrugs. “It’s easier this way,” he says, reaching around Harry’s chest to tie the cravat, the movement bringing him tantalisingly close to Harry.
He stops suddenly and looks at Harry with a glint in his eye that puts Harry in mind of Hermione in fifth year, the only time he’s known her to be excited to break the rules.
“Merlin, please,” Harry says fervently.
“Right,” Harry says, throat tight. “I think I’ll head home now, tiring night and all that.” He gives Malfoy the best approximation of a smile he can manage and Apparates away.
Warmth curls around Harry’s chest, soft and contented. He smiles and hopes he doesn’t look as hopelessly besotted as he feels.
Draco, on the other hand, is anything but relaxed – his mind is racing, thoughts tripping over themselves. Hope rises within him, unbidden. He hadn’t allowed himself to hope for anything more than a civil conversation, a chance to clear the air. But Harry is making him a mug, and Draco cannot bring himself to believe that it holds no significance.
Harry is pacing. He’s walking in tight circles in the entryway, drawing curious glances from everyone passing through. He tugs at the collar of his robes, the same ones he bought with Draco. No cravat this time, though.
“Thanks,” Harry all but gasps, stepping quickly away from Malfoy, hoping he can’t see the furious blush on his cheeks. “Let’s get going then.”
. Nobody explained to him how relationships work. He assumed he would just – wake up with the knowledge one of these days, soon surely, everyone else seems to have figured it out brilliantly, but he hasn’t and he doesn’t know what to
The packet of Jelly Babies crinkles between his fingers, the plastic rips down the center, and half the sweets tumble out onto the sapphire velvet. Corn starch scatters, floating down to rest on the tips of the densely woven fibers, and he settles for scooping the sweets up, licking the powder off the duvet, and shoving a handful of jellies into his mouth.
“Why…” Harry whispers, half to himself, “didn’t he ever say anything to
Where he’d sleep tomorrow is a problem for tomorrow, he figures, shucking off everything but his briefs. His skin glides over golden satin, limbs searching out the firmest pillows and drawing them to his chest. The corner of a book scrapes along his arm as he wraps it under a pillow. Something hard and plastic, as well.
you? For anything, really.”
“People leave,” Harry whispers, just above the din of water on rolled copper. “When I ask them for things, I lose them.”
Walburga’s only pastime, before she was past her time, had to have been making herself unwelcome at family functions. Based on the nature of her comments, anyway. Screaming at him about sullying a daughter of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. Ranting about his career choices. And, his least-favorite, her scathing commentary about his mother’s Muggle origins, and her presumptions about his parents marrying young and the timing of his birth.
Harry’s step falters. “What?”
“No,” he whispers. “No. The daft bastard.”
“Where are your shoes?” Harry asks.
“Shit!” Dean yells, and Harry winces. “I’m gonna ask her out! Harry! Can I ask her out?!”
“Right. He keeps it in his office.” Harry’s budding smile dies on the vine. “Dean said Ron was angry with me.”
Harry’s mouth opens, but he shakes his head and the words die.
“Hm?”
Draco hums, sliding back and uncrossing his legs. The bars of the cell fit between his big toe and second toe as he thinks. “I believe his exact words were ‘We can’t have a Death Eater fucking Aurors now, can we, Malfoy?’ And then he took my robes, and my wand, and any bloody chance I had of clawing my way back into society. Very thorough, our Head Auror.”
