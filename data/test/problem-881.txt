“It’s a good thing you recognised it,” she says, running to hold the gate open so they can hobble through, Potter leaning heavily on them both, dripping blood on the flagstones. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”
They’re up high enough that the path has all but disappeared when Potter stops and stares out over the edge. Draco feels like he can see for miles, the castle hidden by the steep incline, and the cloud that had surrounded them halfway up long since dissipated into clear sky.
They both ignore him. “Try
Draco, aware that they’re losing precious seconds the longer they stand there deliberating, cuts in. “Granger, enough. We can’t apparate with him, he’s half-dead.”
They aren’t playing with real gold — Draco doesn’t have enough of that to throw around any more, something he’s just about managed to get used to — but he’s become quite attached to the small pile of pistachio nuts they’ve been using as bartering chips.
He’s barely pressing down at all, but just the feel of his thumb against Harry’s pulse point is making it jump unsteadily. Harry breathes carefully, swallowing. Malfoy watches his throat bob under his hand.
To his credit, he’s clearly trying to be quiet but it’s dark and he trips over Draco’s shoes on his way to the bed, catches himself heavily with one hand on the lump that is Draco’s hip under the duvet.
what he’s studying.
Potter frowns but wisely decides against arguing. Draco won’t allow him to be some kind of righteous protector, or whatever he’s imagining.
“Next exit, Granger.” He doesn’t even have to look to know where they are, just lays himself out over Potter, leaning rather more heavily than he intends to because his balance is all off. The faint feeling that usually takes him over in a couple of minutes is already there, pulling at the edges of his vision, and he knows it’s because he’s hurt. It only makes him panic more, not for himself, but for Potter, knowing that if he passes out first there’ll be no one to keep Potter awake.
Big on him to begin with, it hangs off Malfoy’s frame enticingly, cutting off at his waist due to his (very slight, thanks) height advantage so that its formless shape looks somehow deliberate rather than the small tent it resembles when Harry wears it.
He laughs. Another thing he likes about her: she has no time for bullshit. “The latter, I suppose.”
“I know I can be— a lot to deal with,” he’d added. “Everything that comes with me, I mean.”
Malfoy mostly manages to contain the chaos that is his complete inability to tidy up after himself to his room, though he does have a lot of products that spill out of the cabinet in their shared bathroom, cluttering the shelf and the sink and the lip of the bath. It doesn’t bother Harry as much as he thought he might have. Kreacher seems significantly more eager to clean with Malfoy around, and Malfoy doesn’t care when Harry borrows his expensive shampoo, so it’s a compromise Harry can live with, even if it means he often runs into a damp, flushed Malfoy fresh from the shower on weekday mornings, or else bumps into him sleep-ruffled and yawning on the landing during the weekends.
“I love you,” he says, unable to stop himself.
“Your light was on.”
“You ask a lot of questions,” Potter says, but he doesn’t sound bothered by it. And rightly so, honestly, seeing as he’s the one who keeps dragging Draco out of bed. There’s an odd sort of interest in his face, like he can’t figure Draco out. “But yeah, a bit.”
Harry blinks, his broom listing distractedly to one side. He turns to Ginny, wide-eyed. “I won’t lie, I’m not even sure what we’re playing.”
Potter frowns consideringly and takes another large gulp. “Tastes good to me.”
Ginny snorts. “Yes,
“Erm,” says Potter.
It’s a relief when he moves, Draco had been half worried he’d just stay there, staring at the hallway with that indecipherable expression. Back in the graveyard he’d cried, and Draco had felt at a complete loss, no idea how to comfort him or why the pain on his face made Draco’s chest feel hollow, but this is worse, somehow. There was an emptiness in his eyes for a second there that scared Draco.
“Merlin, Potter, yes, it feels good, shit,” Draco pants, her own hands splayed on Potter’s thighs again, trying to communicate that she needs more through hip movements rather than actual words.
“This wine is awful.”
They separate and Potter’s eyes open, wide behind his glasses. He looks lovely lit from above by the moonlight.
Even so, they manage to steal a private minute or two — Hermione has to go to the bathroom sometime, and everyone’s conveniently distracted by the cake being brought out — because Harry’s apparently a masochist with a sore, yearning spot in his brain where his self-preservation should be.
“Want me to go?”
Malfoy’s eyes narrow thoughtfully and then he sits up and pats the edge of the cushion in front of him, lifts his feet up onto the sofa and tucks them out of the way. Harry stares at him.
“Car crash. But seeing as there’s no wrecked car for them to find, I doubt that story’ll hold for long. We really can’t keep Obliviating our way out of things.”
Malfoy exhales, probably smiles — Harry can’t see him, is facing the other way and has gone cross-eyed trying to keep a hold on himself, besides — and kneads his thumbs gently into the top of Harry’s neck. Harry’s spine shudders. “Thanks. I’m good with my hands.”
Granger’s brows knit.
He kisses messily down Malfoy’s cock and then keeps going, until his mouth meets his fingers and Malfoy lets out a string of curses, his fingers curling into Harry’s sheets. Harry licks over where he and Malfoy are joined and pushes another finger into him, free hand gripping Malfoy’s thigh, his thumb stroking soothingly. Malfoy keens. His back curls and his head comes up so Harry can see his face, sweaty and flushed, before he falls back again and wraps a hand around himself. Harry tugs him by the wrist, pulls his hand away from his cock and Malfoy swears loudly at him but doesn't try to touch himself again.
“Yeah,” Potter says. “Yeah, I guess not,” and then heads back into his own room without another word.
at that, it was definitely the sub-standard mattress — and climbs up over her, flicking her hand at a lamp next to the bed to turn it on.
on VHS from the newsagents on the corner is definitely not one of them.
“What, take their children up mountains?”
“This is only happening because you’re you,” Draco says to him, taking his bag like Harry’s incapable of carrying it. He’s flustered, grumpy, but in the exaggerated way that means he’s not actually angry.
. There’s always been a strong dynamic there, but Draco likes to think he’s mellowed out a bit, and it doesn’t sit right with him, the tension in the air whenever they interact, the possibility that Potter still holds enough resentment to prevent them getting along. They’re quite literally living side by side, and Draco would rather things are as comfortable as they can be if they’re going to keep rubbing shoulders like this.
“Let me get dressed.”
“Hold,” he says, his voice low.
He wants to hear it again.
“Granger,” he says instead. “You’re a closet Take That fan and you cried the summer after fourth year when one of them left — Robert someone? I forget — even though you saw it coming and think it’s the best decision for everyone involved.”
Not embarrassed enough, though, to have any kind of self-control, apparently. He comes so hard imagining Malfoy is getting off next door thinking about touching him that he actually tears a hole in his pillow biting down on it, a rip that he is absolutely going to have to figure out how to mend himself, unless he wants Mrs Weasley asking him what an earth he did to make the fabric split like that.
still are,” he says, with a nonchalance he doesn’t feel.
She huffs in amusement at his silence. “Was that Zabini’s voice I heard on my way downstairs?”
“Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you need anything,” Headmistress Mcgonagall had told him before she’d shut the door behind her and left him to unpack. “Your head of house won’t be here until the new year.” Draco’d nodded, noting her clipped tone and wondering how she could even bear to talk to him.
Draco looks at the side of his face until he turns and looks back. “What?”
Draco looks at him, and his eyes are hot, unyielding steel. “What do you want me to say, Harry? I’m not going to quit for you.”
Weasley shrugs and shares a far too knowing look with Lovegood.
Harry bites hard on the inside of his cheek to stop himself smiling and feels the balloon of his chest swell. “I thought you said my name meant nothing over here.”
“Fair enough.” He shifts again. “Mine’s bigger.”
Harry’s heart sinks into his feet. He’d just wanted to press pause for a while, hadn’t been expecting an ultimatum, but maybe that’s what Draco wants. All or nothing. It makes sense, really. Of course he doesn’t want to wait, hanging on whilst Harry tries to sort through the jumble of his own feelings. Who knows how long that will take, and Draco has a life to be getting on with. He doesn’t deserve that.
There’s a strange, angry noise that Draco takes a couple of seconds to realise came out of his own mouth, mingling with the sounds of broken glass under their feet, Granger’s panicked yelling, Dolohov’s laughter. It’s only because Dolohov’s momentarily preoccupied, celebrating his hit on Potter by trying to curse Weasley’s left leg off at the shin, that Draco manages to body-bind him. It’s not a strong spell, Draco’s head is muddled and his arm’s shaking, he can smell blood and it’s terrifying, distracting, but it makes Dolohov fall back at just the right angle that his head cracks into the wall and he goes still.
“G’night, Draco.”
Draco doubts very much that the Dark Lord has actually told him what
Draco doubts Potter’s done much more walking up mountains than he has but he follows him anyway.
Seamus makes a tiny, helpless noise.
Potter laughs at what Draco is sure is a dazed look on her face and then they’re kissing again and she gets a little lost and then they’re at the front of the queue before Draco even realises what’s happening. Draco gets them into the stall right at the end and barely has time to lock the door before Potter is back on her, mouth sweet and sure on hers, hands on her neck, one either side, thumbs pressing up along Draco’s jaw.
He can feel Potter’s eyes on the side of his face as he huffs a laugh. “I’ve had half a year to process.”
Potter laughs so hard he starts coughing. It looks like it hurts a bit. Good.
It’s not what Potter’s expecting but he lets the change of subject slide, his body relaxing minutely. They’re not touching at all -- Draco can feel it in the centimetres of space between their shoulders.
“Granger,” Draco yells over the sound of Dolohov blowing up the floorboards just in front of Weasley’s feet. “Don’t let him hit your bag.”
Ginny rolls her eyes. “Of course he’s doing it on purpose. He’s been doing it on purpose all summer.”
When he pushed Harry back with one hand on his chest, he’d leaned over him, the momentum making his hand slip forward so that it now sits right at the base of Harry’s throat, and it’s all Harry can think about.
He gets a weird look from Weasley at his use of “again”, but he doesn’t care. They need to move. He didn’t stop Potter getting hurt, but he can make sure that, this time, they get to the hospital before either of them pass out. He can still save him.
Potter starts laughing. It’s not the reaction Draco’s expecting.
“Mr. Potter?” Draco asks, teasing, and Harry can see the way his eyes darken even through the poor connection.
“Put your seatbelt on,” she tells Weasley.
“We went
“God, you
retain perfect diction even with three fingers inside of him. It’s almost laughable. It’s pretty impressive. It’s so fucking hot Harry is about to come in his pants.
Malfoy turns his grin on the floor, flicks a glance up at Harry from under his hair. It’s not a very big landing. Not much of a space for hanging about really, and yet here they are.
He gets his pajamas on and sits on the end of his bed, not even pretending to himself that he’s not waiting. After five minutes Potter’s there at the window.
Draco feels the fight go out of him too, overcome with an unwelcome urge to reassure Potter. “It’s fine,” he says, voice breaking between the two words. “I thought, actually, you might,” and then stops, swallows once.
And surely Draco is reading too much into the way Potter says that, the look she shoots Draco from under her eyelashes. She’s turned so she’s facing Draco properly, propped up on the bar.
He tries to think what the him of three years ago might have said about Potter being allowed his pick of rooms. Draco had taken what they’d assigned to him and been thankful he wasn’t being locked up in a tower somewhere.
“Is anyone else..?” Draco asks, trailing off. Potter does the weird shrug-head-shake thing.
Potter shakes his head. “No, I don’t think so.”
Potter’s hands are in his pockets. “I don’t think it would have felt the same without you.”
, like this is one of the books Draco used to read by wandlight when he couldn’t sleep as a kid, but he doesn’t, he just stops in the doorway, blocking their only exit, and smiles.
Draco’s sure his surprise shows on his face.
He sits back away from the window, legs crossed, until Potter appears, grinning stupidly.
It gives Harry pause for a second. “What?” he asks, genuinely a bit confused. “You’re the one who ended it!”
He tries to pull back for breath but Potter won’t let him, keeps straining his neck up to keep Draco’s mouth against his. He’s going to do himself more damage if he tries to use any of his core muscles to hold himself up so Draco pushes him properly down into the seats by the shoulders, makes him stay put. He licks into his mouth in a half-apology and Potter grunts and then softens, sinks back and lets himself be kissed like he’s too tired for much more participation. That’s ok with Draco. He’s getting a bit carried away as it is.
does he know her voice is going to get more worried? Why isn’t he in the backseat of a car with an unconscious Potter? He takes a step back and peers down the road. The car’s sitting there, parked right where they found it. Or are about to find it. Fuck, did he hit his head?
Harry moves onto his stomach and Malfoy’s eyebrows shoot up, the outline of his cock straining against his underwear. Harry wonders if he’d even finished before knocking on Harry’s door, or whether he just got himself to the edge and came right over, ready and eager for it.
“Were you always this annoying? If I hadn’t been there I would’ve assume you’d
help, depending on how you look at it.
Draco wakes for the second time in as many weeks to a tapping sound at his window. When he sits up, Potter’s face is right there behind the glass, small grin in place. It’s a lot to take in when Draco has quite literally just woken up. He gestures to the window, open just enough to let a tiny, icy breeze in, and wiggles his eyebrows until Draco fumbles around for his wand, shoots a spell to send it flying open properly and collapses back onto his pillows before he can think better of it, pulling the duvet back up over him as cold air follows Potter into the room.
at it,” Harry says, feeling Draco’s gaze on the side of his face as he stares, captivated, at the pale, craterous surface. He wants to press his nose to the glass, tattoo the image onto his brain.
“Hi,” Potter says on Saturday morning, clambering through the window onto Draco’s desk. He presses his mouth distractedly to Draco’s cheek in greeting and Draco freezes. Potter’s always touching him now and he’s not used to it. It’s like he’s channelled all his restless, fidgety energy into getting his hands on Draco whenever possible, now that he thinks he’s allowed.
This is insane. Harry can hear every syllable coming out of Malfoy’s mouth, clear cut. Of course he
“Are you sure you don’t want to go to the Hospital wing?”
Below them, Luna’s drink explodes as she opens it. Malfoy springs up laughing, drops running down his bare chest and hair spattered pink by whatever carbonated monstrosity Luna picked up from the newsagents on the corner.
“Let’s just get to a doctor,” Weasley says from the front. Draco doesn’t listen to the rest of the sentence. He stares down at Potter instead, whose eyes are, for now, reassuringly open and giving Draco a look like
This time, it’s easier to get his bearings. He’s expecting the feeling of packed snow beneath his feet, the concerned looks from the others once he opens his eyes.
Potter smiles like he’s said something funny. “I know.”
Right, definitely Malfoy then. Ever since Malfoy moved in Harry’s fridge has somehow been elevated from out-of-date condiments to near Michelin star levels. There’d been a system at one point, before Malfoy, back when they all moved in (fresh from Hogwarts, no idea what to do with themselves, no money to speak of, or no desire to start flat-hunting, depending on who you asked), with separate shelves and designated drawers and everything, but it had barely lasted a couple of weeks. Harry’s seriously considering implementing it again, if only to reduce the amount of time he has to spend moving things like jars of caviar out of the way to get to the orange juice.
“How many times have you done this now?” Weasley asks, curious.
He lifts a hand and something flies into it. Draco might have been impressed at the show of wandless magic if he was at all surprised. He watches Potter pull the jumper over his head; it has a hood and looks a muted dark grey colour, but it’s difficult to tell in the darkness.
Blaise, Dean.. Draco had even thought Michael Corner was attractive in a whiny, floppy haired sort of way, and then there’s Potter, of course, who’s not in the room, as far as Draco can tell. He hasn’t actually seen him at all since they stood in the hallway and grinned at each other like idiots. Quite embarrassing, now Draco remembers it, and that was before he even started on the tequila.
Potter has inched himself slightly in front of Draco, blocking him with a shoulder. Stupid, overprotective Gryffindor. Draco’s not going to move, though.
to be stupid—”
“To be fair to you, it
Potter grumbles and shuts the window. “If you don’t want any,” he starts, but he’s already pouring it out. It must have been under a stasis charm; Draco can see steam curling off of it.
“Did you not think I was coming back?” Draco’s curious.
, and starts pushing his underwear down his hips. Between them they manage to get them off and over Harry’s shoulder somewhere, and then it’s skin on skin and Harry forgoes his hand and jumps straight in with his mouth.
” he hears Weasley say from the front. “Now? They’re doing this now?”
Draco starts to wish, pointlessly, that the shitting Dark Lord had chosen someone with a few less brain cells to guard this place. There are certainly enough idiots amongst the Death Eaters, people Draco would have had a chance at holding off. It’s not like there’s even a Horcrux here, a fact he’s had to accept after multiple searches of the entire house. He doesn’t understand why it needs the level of sadistically enthusiastic protection that Dolohov is willing to provide.
Putting his robes on feels strange, after months of not wearing them. He waits long enough that he knows everyone will have arrived and filtered into the Great Hall, sitting on his bed listening to the noise of the castle slowly filling up again.
“And try to keep it down,” Malfoy’s voice trails back over his shoulder from the landing. “Some of us are trying to work.”
.” It’s not really a joke.
Harry laughs. “You’re not serious?”
— I don’t have time to convince you to do this again, Granger. Let’s go.”
Draco leans back on his arms, the vee of his only half-buttoned pajama shirt slipping enough to show a bit of collar bone. Potter’s eyes flick to it immediately. They haven’t-- everything is still very new and Draco’s scared but he thinks, soon, maybe. “Hi.”
That gets Potter’s attention. “What?”
“This is fun,” Malfoy says happily, gulping more of his drink and smacking his lips. He smiles so easily when he’s drinking, it’s hard to look away from. (And also quite hard to look at directly, which means Harry has become closely acquainted with drunk-Malfoy’s right cheekbone, an area he’s deemed reasonably safe to stare at.) “I’m glad you let me move in, Potter.”
It came from behind them, Draco thinks. Back out on the landing, or in one of the other rooms. There was only one door still closed, presumably the other bedroom, but the idea of having to go and open it seems terrifying. They haven’t even done any of the cursory checks for traps or enchantments, save for Potter’s initial test of the front door, and it suddenly seems stupidly remiss of them.
“And what does the birthday girl want?” Draco asks, feeling herself go all hot and syrupy at the way Potter’s eyes darken with the question, her breathing getting weightier.
There’s a distinctly awkward pause that Henry seems unaware of. He grabs the two drinks he’s finished making and spins, face colouring slightly when he realises they’re all still staring.
Potter looks at him askance even as the blood reaches his socks, staining them. Living this again is forcing Draco to notice new and horrible details. Still: the bright side. He knows Potter’s going to start shaking soon and he preempts it, climbs over him, and gets the same startled look as last time.
be arsed.” Pansy drains the last of her drink, which is pink and frothy, and waves her empty martini glass at the barman. “Anyway, if Weasley is to be trusted, this little obsession of yours is not one-sided.”
“Frankly, it’s embarrassing,” she says on Wednesday, standing, hands on hips, in the middle of his bedroom. “If you refuse to talk to him about it, at least give him a taste of his own healing potion.”
“Hmm?” Harry hums around his cock, holds his fingers inside and watches Malfoy squirm at the vibration.
Harry pulls a face, but Malfoy’s already turning around, heading back to his own room. Harry looks at Ginny, who shoved a hand in her mouth as soon as she was out of Malfoy’s eyeline and is shaking with silent laughter.
“Mhm,” he says, noncommittal, belated. It’s a little overwhelming seeing Potter up close, something he hadn’t expected. They haven’t spoken without several metres of distance between them since Draco’s trial back in May, and his eyes catch on small details of Potter’s face: the way his glasses have pressed into the bridge of his nose, how surprisingly long his eyelashes are. Draco makes himself look away.
He tells Draco as much, walking along Cocoa Beach in the clear, breezy night. “This isn’t— it’s not how it’s supposed to be! We talk for ten minutes every couple of months! We have sex like three times a year at
Weasley turns to him immediately, eyebrows raised. “You mean in general? Or why he’s been acting weird around you?”
“So modest, Potter,” she says. “Have you not grown out of that shtick yet?”
Draco realises she’s monologuing in her head instead of actually saying anything out loud and swallows, shutting her mouth which has probably been hanging open gormlessly this whole time. Perfect. “Ok, I just want to— let me do something first.”
The rest of the night blurs: Luna fleecing them all at poker, Pansy forcing him to dance with her for
Harry shakes his head quickly, nose almost brushing against Malfoy’s. “M’not jealous,” he says, matching Malfoy’s low volume. “Just think you’re being a bit loud. Bad housemate etiquette, s’what it is.”
’d out of them.
He sighs. “Look, maybe we both need some—”
Potter almost throws his hands up at Draco’s exaggeratedly wistful tone but apparently remembers they’re the main thing keeping him secured and settles for rolling his eyes instead. “Don’t let me keep you,” he says, but ruins the exasperated tone with a look that Draco might call fond, on anyone else.
Harry doesn’t see Draco for a year and a half. If he comes back to England at any point, he doesn’t tell Harry about it, and the weeks pile up and up until Harry loses count and only knows that it’s the longest they’ve been apart since before Hogwarts. He can’t really comprehend it. Even when they hated each other, Draco had been
“Fuck,” he says, drawing the word out, half-expecting his voice to come out as a croak. It doesn’t, but it’s a little breathless, a little deeper. Malfoy’s eyes flash.
“What broke the loop?” Potter prompts when Draco still hasn’t said anything.
He cuts her off, too. “
“Oh,” he says as something hits him on the head, hard. “
“Come
The Potter of the here and now seems frozen, lost in thought until Weasley nudges them all gently forwards, pulls the front door closed behind them. The silence gets very loud.
“The war.”
He gestures with the hat. “But it’s
He balls the jumper up and presses it to Potter’s side, remembers belatedly that keeping pressure on a wound is what you’re supposed to do and ignores the way Potter cries out like he can’t help it, flinching away. The jumper, like everything else that touches Potter, gets soaked through within minutes.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Possibly." Harry didn't want to press the issue, Draco had told him that he had been expected to join his Father at the Ministry, greasing palms and carrying on the Malfoy legacy, but now his entire life plan was blown to hell.
“Open.” Harry said with ease, it had become second nature now to slip into the snake language, they had entered the Chamber of Secrets so often last year that he had become accustomed to it.
"Alright. If you're sure there's enough for me."
Harry heard one loud crack, the sound of the fang hitting the inside of the Locket. The whisper in his ears turned into a screech of pain and he had to clamp his hands over his ears to block out the high pitched shriek. Even with his hands over his ears Harry heard a second crack. He saw a quick flash of bright light and in an instant the dark dissipated into nothing and drifted away like it was no more than a wisp of smoke from a blown out candle.
“You did great, you did your job perfectly.”
"Merlin!" Draco gasped out against Potter's mouth, but he didn't fight it as Harry carried him down the dark corridor and pressed him against Draco's own office door.
Harry reluctantly left her leaning against a pillar and he turned to the rest of the group. They were swarmed around Ron, who was handing out healing potions left right and centre. He had shown Harry the contents of his bag when he had returned to his and Draco’s room, apart from a whole host of Weasley Wizard Wheezes defence products, it was filled almost to the brim with potions of all kinds. It seemed as though he had raided Draco’s stash. A stash which Harry had seen first hand, a hundred healing potions wouldn’t even be missed.
"Potter." Draco said and Harry didn't think it was in his head that Draco sounded almost relieved to see him. His voice was devoid of the cutting edge of sarcasm or dislike that Harry was starting to get used to once again.
Thanks for bearing with me :)
"Do you ever stop being a fucking hero Potter? If you expect me to fall to my knees and kiss your feet as thanks for saving my life then you're sorely mistaken."
Draco came to a stop by the curb, he had drunk far too much to feel comfortable apparating home and there didn't seem to be any black cabs in this part of London.
"Expecto Patronum!"  His wand didn't even produce a non-corporeal wisp. He could feel his magic pushing against the barrier, trying desperately to come to his aid, but the constraints held. He watched in horror as another Dementor leaned in to Draco. He could hear the deep rattling breaths from where he stood., but they were ignoring him, feasting on the Slytherin instead.
a good man. An extremely good man. He accepted me as soon as he found out about my monthly problem without question. He learned to be an Animagus for me. But he wasn’t always himself when Snape was involved. Even though he didn’t like Snape he still saved his life when Snape got too close to me on a full moon. You saw a very small part of our lives and I don’t want you to think that everything you’ve ever been told was a lie.”
"You'll never be a Weasley to me, don't be ridiculous. You are and always will be a Granger." Draco's response was always something along those lines and it never failed to make Hermione smile. Which she needed right now, considering she couldn't find that one bloody file that she desperately needed.
.” The whisper continued,
“Mate.” Harry turned from the window to look at Ron, “There’s no other way?” He already knew the answer, but he had to ask.
He slowly reached out. He felt the magic tingle against his fingertips as he pressed his palms to the glass. But nothing else happened. Just the tingle of familiarity, the acceptance of his own magic coming into contact. Dumbledore had built a back door into his protections, one just for Harry.
“They’ll be here at sunset. That’s what he said.” The voice in the vision had been so chilling that even remembering it sent a chill down his spine.
“Mr Draco, Albus. You need to ask before giving someone a nickname, remember?” Harry said from behind him.
Draco had barely raised the glass of whiskey to his mouth when he made eye contact with Potter across the room. Draco nodded to him in greeting before turning back to his date and laughing at something he had said, he hadn’t actually caught the joke but the people they were standing with were laughing so Draco assumed it had been something vaguely funny. Draco's hand found it's way back to his date’s arm and he was more than happy to stay that way for most of the evening.
“Okay guys, ten more minutes and then feel free to go. You’ve all done really well today.” And they had, Colin Creevey had managed to land most of his spells this time and had improved from just knocking someone off their feet to actually stunning them for a good minute. After he got frustrated with himself, Harry had reminded him that a minute in a life or death situation would be a good head start, at least enough to snap the other person's wand and get away.
"The She-Weasley. Your Wife." Draco continued to dig his own cockblocking grave, but he couldn’t stop his mouth from spewing words. He had never been one to mince his words, but Potter always brought the worst out in him.
Today was one of the days where Hermione had rushed in to join him behind the floor to ceiling brass gates that separated the two sections of the Library. Madam Pince eyed them warily every time they bypassed the
“EE.” Malfoys lip curled in disgust, “Fucking joke, should have been an O.”
"And you think the Aurors won't be just as ready to hire you just because you're Harry Potter?" Harry shrugged and leaned back in his chair, "Don't be daft Harry, do whatever you want to do and worry about what people think afterwards. You'll have plenty of time to prove that you've earned your spot no matter which direction you take."
“You sure?” Harry asked.
she get it?” Draco asked. He hadn’t even seen Ron pull it from Umbridge’s neck when he had stunned her in the Ministry. Though he had been otherwise preoccupied with the dementor descending from above.
"Probably holed away in the Castle. Wouldn't be surprised if they knew all about this." Ron said with no small amount of venom in his tone as he looked out to the circling Dementors.
Harry didn't stop to think. He was leaving the protective circle of the Patronuses and running towards the corner without even realising his feet had started to move.
“I just … I needed to ask you something. It’s kind of important.” Harry stalled, he realised that this probably wasn’t the best decision when Sirius looked at him more worried than ever before. Way to go Harry.
“I need to shower but I won’t be too long, don’t bother waiting for me though. If you see Hermione, will you let her know I’ll be down soon?”
“What did you see, Harry?” Sirius’s tone was low, already apologetic even though Harry hadn’t really said very much.
“I should go anyway.” Draco opened the door and stepped out into the night. The cool early spring air brushed across his heated and flushed skin and gave him a little relief from the almost innocent encounter that they had just shared. Well...Innocent compared to their other encounters.
“I’ll leave you to it, and I won’t tell Ron just yet, but I’ll be watching you to make sure you’re okay. It’s all a bit sudden though, isn’t it? You’re panting after him already, but you’ve only snogged once.”
“That’s not the point.” Draco was silent for a couple of seconds, “Erm, curfew soon. I’d better…” He motioned over his shoulder in the direction of the staircase that would take him to the Entrance Hall and then on to the dungeons.
One chapter to go! Plus a cheeky little announcement ;) so please stay tuned after the next chapter.
“Harry, your Father
“Sirius Black.” Harry took a deep breath and steeled himself as he waited for Sirius to pick up the mirror.
Or he thought that only he had known, himself and the Death Eaters in attendance of course.
I'm sorry to those of you who thought Dumbledore would be around. But there's 9 chapters left and Dumbledore saving the day was a far too simple ending :)
“Tell me and I can help you. Whatever it is Harry, we can deal with it together.” Draco shifted, and ever so slowly he crawled down the length of the bed, giving Harry more than enough time to stand up and move away if he wished to. Harry shook his head in desperation, he knew that if Draco continued to ask then he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from answering.
“Hermione! That’s won-” The word wonderful died on his lips as he noticed the tremble to Hermione’s jaw and the teary film that was beginning to cover her eyes, “Not wonderful?”
“Grab Ron, he’ll be able to help. Whatever your plans, it needs to happen before nightfall.” Seamus steeled himself and walked away, calling out to Ron as he went. Harry and Neville watched him go from their place on the outskirts of the busy room.
.” Harry folded it back up and closed the drawer snugly. Draco’s knees were starting to shake now, and his eyes were starting to prickle and water. But he wasn't about to cry, he wasn’t a crier.
“I love you too Harry.” Draco whispered to himself as the room disappeared around him.
to you?" Harry asked with no small hint of incredulity.
“Fuck off…” He said disbelievingly, “If this is some kind of prank, I have to tell you I really don’t get it.” The Slytherin’s eyes narrowed.
“Murder breaks apart the soul, that’s how a Horcrux is made in the first place. That’s what I did, I murdered someone.”
“How could he?” Hermione whispered tearfully from his side. It was the first thing either of them had said since entering the memory and the clarity of her voice in comparison to the two Professors made him jump.
"Hello there." Draco said with a smile. He gave her little hand a soft stroke with one finger and she smiled and tried to grab it.
2020 has been a wild ride, and for all the bad that Covid has brought I still try to look on the bright side. For me it's given me time to spend with my baby without the pressures of work, and it's given me the time to re-discover my passion for writing. I really hope that everyone reading has had at least one good thing come from the past year, even if it is something small.
"I know!" Draco raised his fork in triumph, "I'll go to his office and tell him to his face that we can't continue with this any longer. It'll be much easier without the presence of alcohol I'm sure."
“It looked like the one you’ve been dragging around everywhere. Thought I’d best grab it just in case it was Slytherin’s.” Ron flushed and grinned at Hermione’s admiring gaze and Harry’s praise.
“Nothing?” Ron asked.
*Spoiler Warning*
.” It whispered to him. Harry tried to open his mouth, tried to refute the whisper of the magic, he was nothing like this.
Harry absentmindedly nodded. He felt cool latex covered hands manipulating his forearm very slightly, and then the chair he was sitting on was being adjusted, a little further up, a little to the left. The skin of his arm was being wiped down with a damp paper towel, and then a low humming buzz began to fill his ears. Harry lost himself in the feeling of the slow drag of needles across his exposed skin. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant and he resisted the urge to reach over and scratch at the annoying push and pull of the man’s fingers. He leaned his head back against the rest instead, and closed his eyes. The music overhead (Rock? Metal?) drowned out the buzz until he almost couldn’t hear it anymore. He could hear people standing out on the streets below, Muggles chatting and shopping, having no idea what was in store for them in the future.
“Harry!” Draco exclaimed with wide eyes, “Merlin, Darling. I couldn’t even see you.” Harry turned his face into Draco’s neck and breathed him in. Allowing his scent to curl around him lovingly. A harsh contrast to the dark magic that still filled the study.
“Harry’s there?” Came another voice from Sirius’s side of the connection.
“I’m going to ask again,
Cheers ran out across the stands as Cadwallader took possession of the Quaffle and sped towards the Slytherin keeper Bletchley, who was flying between the three Slytherin goals looking as defeated as Draco was starting to feel. He had played well, blocking a good portion of the goals, but their Chasers just couldn’t keep possession and he was starting to flag.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me!
Short one today. I felt like the last chapter was running a little long, so I decided to split it into two :)
That had been the wrong thing to say apparently. Harry’s pupils dilated an almost impossible amount, the green of his irises taken over by the darkness of his pupils. One of Harry’s hands found the hard plane of Draco's hip, while the other wrapped around Draco's wrist to pull his finger away from his chest and slowly tug Draco closer. Draco hadn't realised how hard he had been panting until he was practically chest to chest with Harry and with every inhale he took the front of his body was almost pressed completely against Harry’s. They were tucked almost entirely behind a marble statue and Draco realised how easy it would be for Harry to lean forward and kiss him until they both couldn't remember their own names.
"Ha-bloody-ha, Granger."
Their steady jog through Hogwarts only served to remind Harry of what was at stake. This had been his home, and now it was on the line. The lives of the students residing within it were on the line. Ever since the Order had started meeting in Malfoy Manor they had pegged everything on Voldemort attacking the Ministry of Magic or Diagon Alley to draw the Order out, they had been concerned about Hogwarts but since it was firmly under Death Eater control they were sure that he wouldn’t focus an attack on the Castle. They had been wrong. All while the Order had been protecting Diagon and preserving Ministry intelligence, Voldemort had been preparing for this instead.
“I know they are. I just...Couldn’t think about anything for a while." The shuffling of books stopped but Harry didn't look up to meet Hermione's gaze as he tried to put his emotions into words, "Losing him…broke me a little."
“Now how about you fuck me, and prove to yourself just how good you are.” Harry laughed.
“Have you asked the twins?” Ron sometimes did errands for the Potterwatch broadcast when the Twins were too swamped with Weasley Wheezes postal orders to fulfil both roles.
“Is Draco around?” Sirius asked, after someone on his side distracted him.
that Draco had inexplicably fallen in love with Harry Potter. It had been stupid of him, but Draco found himself unable to look away from Harry's careless satiated grin. He enjoyed the way Potters fingers would absentmindedly reach out and stoke whatever skin on Draco's body they could reach, it was barely more than a quick tap of his fingers, a small pet to make sure he was alright. But Draco loved it.
sign, but after checking their note the first four times she had stopped accusing them of forging Dumbledore’s signature. Harry had the suspicion that she had even visited the Headmaster in his office just to double check. For once he actually didn’t blame her, he was sure that no one in the entire History of Hogwarts had ever been allowed carte balance over the Restricted Section.
“And how exactly are you planning on getting into that Office?” Ron asked.
"Draco," Harry turned and said softly, letting Ron and Hermione walk ahead, "Are you coming?" He held his hand out. But Draco didn't take it. He put his hands in his pockets and followed Potter's sidekicks up the path, leaving Potter to follow behind him without another word. But Draco didn’t miss the small secret smile that Potter was keeping to himself.
“Please.” Draco’s hands landed on Harry’s shoulders, and he plastered his chest against Harry’s back. Offering him the comfort that he didn’t deserve but so desperately needed, “Your problems are my problems, remember.” Draco leaned down to press his forehead between Harry’s shoulder blades.
All porn no plot in this chapter
The familiar but slight ache in his chest had him whipping around to find Draco. Who was fine. But he too had been pelted with letters. Not quite as many as Harry, but it was enough for him to be busy setting fire to the Howlers and picking letters out of the big bowl of porridge with two fingers and a look of disgust. The ache faded, obviously having flared up because of Draco's panic at being pelted by unknown objects.
.” Harry paused and Draco waited.
It's very difficult to make exams interesting, but we are approaching the end!
As for today's library session, he was planning on finishing off his most recent Defence assignment, and then moving onto Fifth year Charms. But he had barely written two sentences when someone saying his name caught his attention.
I'm sorry I killed Neville! But I had to kill someone and I couldn't let it be Remus. I couldn't let everyone skip off into the sunset all happy happy haha it was a war after all.
"What do you think I should do?"
“I mean it.” Draco said.
"If you're here over New Years you simply must come to the New Years Eve Gala. It's always a wonderful evening and I've heard the food this year is to die for. French caterers I've been told."
Just the Epilogue to go <3
But he could.
Actually had to Google to plural of Patronus for this Chapter. Add that to the list of weird Harry Potter questions I Google on a daily basis haha.
"I need you, Draco." Potter said through clenched teeth as his Stag darted about in front of them, following the subtle flicks of Harry’s wand to chase away Dementor after Dementor, sending them careening in a swirl of black cloak.
“I think I’ll talk to McGonagall about all three. Maybe I could work towards them all. You know, keep my options open.” He grabbed the two that he had his eye on, and the one that Draco had pointed out before sweeping the rest of them into a neat pile.
“Keep…Him…Company…
The easy mood between them soon dropped, and they stood in silence. Harry was leaning back against the door, he had his arms crossed, and his head was tilted back far enough to be looking at the ceiling. Draco had taken a seat opposite him on top of a crate of practice Quaffles and had settled with his forearms resting against his knees. The sheen of sweat had disappeared from Harry’s forehead, and the redness of Draco’s lips returned to their usual pale pink as the deep flush from his skin faded.
“I know mate.” Harry hesitated before asking his best mate for one final favour, “Could you do something for me?” He pulled out his wand and looked down at it fondly, it had served him well, “Could you give this to Draco?”
“Oh. My. God.” Hermione took a step back in surprise, “Are you sleeping with him? With Malfoy?!” She looked at him, absolutely gobsmacked.
"Oh, at least two hours. This is a good cause after all, it’s very important that people see you here."
Snape sounded disgusted. After last term Draco didn’t think anything could make him side with Snape, not after what he had done. But he agreed with this. He didn’t want to think about his Harry being used in such a way, but Harry’s life was starting to make sense. The family he was placed with so he would learn to be humble, and the things he was allowed to get away with in school, all to test him and teach him. Everything Dumbledore had done was an underhanded way to shape Harry into the type of person who would sacrifice himself for the Wizarding World. Draco felt sick.
“He was always better at masking himself than I was.” Her smile was small and twisted with forced humour, the other Slytherin was fine then. Harry nodded and pulled her into a hug.
Draco glanced down at Harry once again. The Gryffindor had his eyes completely fixed on Draco. He appreciated it, even though he knew that there was an entire game that Harry was ignoring in the background. And then, Harry’s eyes darted past him. Looking intently at a spot at least twenty feet behind his left ear. Harry had seen the Snitch. Draco whirled around. Still not entirely sure which direction he was going in, but he trusted Harry’s impeccable instincts. He was already streaming in the direction of the Snitch when he finally saw it. A delicate blur of gold, it’s little wings beating so fast that it would have been out of sight within seconds if Draco hadn’t already set his eyes on it. Thank Merlin for Harry Potter.
“I want you.” Harry said, Draco expected him to leave it there, but he forgot that there was a reason Harry was a Gryffindor, “I want you now, I want you next week, I want you next month. However long you want me, is how long I want you.” There was no misunderstanding that. And the words hung heavily in the air. Saying something like that in the heat of a passionate moment was one thing, but here, in the silence of the broom shed where the passion between them had dulled to a strange frisson in the air, it seemed almost too raw. Too real. Maybe even too much, for one person to handle.
“You got married?” Came the gasp of disbelief from Hermione. It had been so insane to them that they hadn’t told anyone, not even Ron and Hermione. He would have to explain everything to her once they were out of the memory, it hadn’t even crossed his mind in so long.
"A good cause as well."
more often in siblings or best friends, it wouldn't have pushed you into any relationship you both didn't already want."
"Get rid of him." Potter growled out.
Draco regretted the words the moment they left his mouth. If anyone would have asked him at a later date he would have sworn that he didn't scream in terror as Dementors descended upon them in a tight circle. And he definitely didn't clutch at Potter's bicep as they circled closer and closer, hovering over the ground and towering over them. They were closing in on the two Hogwarts students until they were close enough to reach out and grasp at their clothing. Harry's Patronus joined them after a single moment, pushing the Dementors back as much as possible and pacing in front of Harry to ward them off as much as possible.
Scenes of a sexual nature ahead.
Skeeter's article hit the next day.
"You know I can't say who." Draco had told many people that he was sleeping with someone on a regular basis, he just hadn't told anyone that said person was Harry fucking Potter.
"I know." Potter said stiffly, bringing Draco's attention back to the present moment. He took another swig from his glass and Draco bit back his comment about savouring champagne, he had a feeling Potter had never savoured anything in his entire life. Except maybe sex.
*Spoiler Alert*

“Harry!” Hermione was blushing but she was smiling too. Harry was right, there had been the usual goading from Malfoy, a few insults tossed about, but they hadn’t got into any physical fights so far. The insults were banal, without the cutting edge of Malfoys usual intellect. He seemed to be focusing more on his studies, than on the rivalry between the Slytherins and the Gryffindors.
“I’m going to be a Gryffindor! Like my Dad!” James yelled, brandishing his fork like it was a wand.
“Possibly.” Harry said, but truthfully he had no idea.
They moved quickly through the streets, collecting cowering students from doorways and side streets who were pale and shaking from prolonged exposure to the Dementors. As soon as Ginny's Horse flickered out of sight Luna took point, her large Hare bound about in mid-air and forced the formidable Dementors to flee back to the skies. At the rear of their rapidly growing group were Hermione and Ernie, taking it in turns to push back the encroaching Dementors. On either side were Ron and Seamus. Between them they had created a protective ring around the defenceless students. The defenceless students and Harry. He stared down at his wand uselessly as they walked slowly through the streets. He might as well just throw the damn thing away for all the good it was doing him.
All my love
that he could perform the spell, he
Draco’s voice dropped low into a hiss, it was all he could do in the Library, had they been anywhere else he would have been throwing his hands up in the air and making exclamations at the top of his voice, “He’s absolutely barking Harry.”
“You WHAT!?” Draco exclaimed, amidst Harry bursting into laughter.
“I still can’t believe you grabbed this Ron.” Harry said in awe of his best mate.
“Yeah,” He felt like he was grasping at straws, the three of him were looking at him in expectation, wanting him to take charge and tell them what to do. But he wasn’t sure what to do, Dumbledore hadn’t told him.
“This is too weird.” Ron muttered.
“Well, I saw a memory. I saw you guys and my Dad.”
Thank you all for the lovely reviews. I don't answer every one of them, because most of the time I don't want to ruin the plot lol but I try to answer the comments that have questions about the fic, or if someone is confused about a plot point I try to make things clearer.
“I thought you couldn’t come up here.” Harry said quietly. He could tell that people wanted to greet him, but he was thankful they were giving him this moment.
Harry sat down on the bed and Draco moved to stand in front of him. He wanted so desperately to run his hands through Harry’s hair, to cradle Harry’s head against his chest, to kiss away all this talk of dying and leaving. Draco wanted to shush him, he wanted to hold him.
"Are you gonna get us out of here then?" Draco asked. The Dementors had fled from the street, leaving behind them an eerie, almost too calm, silence.
*Spoiler Alert*
“No Ron. I don’t think there is.” They were solemn as Ron pulled Harry into a one armed hug. They didn’t even go through the rigmarole of acting manly and patting each other on the back. They just hugged.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think it’s pretty.” Albus said, while he pushed his broccoli to one side of his plate with a look of distaste.
“They’ve both gone to do something stupid.” Draco finished. He let go of Hermione just in time to wrench open his bedroom door, as he had expected the room was empty.
"Yes, I do know how you feel about Werewolf Equality."
Happy reading friends! :)
Harry was sitting on the edge of his bed, he was spinning the old mirror between his hands in silent contemplation. It had been two days since he had seen the memory in Snape's Pensieve and Draco had sent him up to his dorm while he was at Quidditch practice, with specific instructions to ‘
“I know, it’s a bit reckless. Hermione was beside herself when she found out.”
” Harry said, and Draco wiped at his eyes and stared at his Soulmate, “
“What’s on the other side you reckon?” Ron asked. They had stopped on the other side of a large painting that covered their only exit. Harry had no idea, he had thought he knew all entrances and exits out of the Castle. Luna had said many times that the Castle was sentient, Harry wouldn’t be surprised if it had sensed the students' distress and created a new exit for them. Harry raised his hand and very slowly he pushed the wooden frame that supported the back of the canvas painting. It gave way easily under his hand and the frame swung open immediately. There was a second of silence before a wave of sound hit them both in the face.
“I think you’d be a fantastic Defence Professor.” Draco shrugged, “But honestly I don’t care either way. Why would I? I'll be just as happy to return home to a fit Quidditch player as I would a fit Auror." Draco flushed at his admission but didn't take it back. Truth be told, it was the first time he had mentioned being with Harry after they finished Hogwarts. Harry grinned in response but didn’t pry into the subject, which Draco was immensely thankful for.
At midnight that night Draco wasn't experiencing a nice sweet kiss from a lovely American wizard. Instead he had his arse full of Gryffindor cock and a dastardly mouth stealing all the breath from his lungs. At least he kind of got a midnight kiss he supposed when he heard the fireworks going off in the distance. The flashes of colour lit up the sky behind the closed curtains of the five star hotel room and Draco only caught a glimpse before Potter's hand was on his cock and his eyelids were fluttering closed against the onslaught.
“Apprenticeship?” Harry asked.
There was never a chance that Draco wasn't going to get his memories back, I'm too much of a romantic to let happen. But all is not well just yet haha
“Have you narrowed down the search?” She asked as she pulled out her first book of the evening. They had been searching for any mention of widespread memory charms, person, or item specific memory charms, or really just anything that mentioned memory charms at all, in the vague hope that there would be some innocuous sentence that would lead them somewhere new.
"Everyone’s in the Shack. We showed Ginny how to get out, she's taking everyone back to Hogwarts." Ron said.
“It said I had an affinity for darkness.” Harry said honestly.
After that it had been the thrill of it, being able to get away with sneaking out in the middle of a party. Dragging each other up to one of their offices in the Ministry, or to a room in the five star hotel that had hosted the holiday events, or a cleaning closet in one of the Ancient wizarding Manors. It had been months of sneaking around, months of heated gazes flashed to each other across ballroom floors, of subtle innuendos murmured around half deaf 100 year old Witches who thought they were "
It was their marriage certificate, it was real, they really had gotten married,
“That’s what I thought too and Dumbledore agreed.” Harry said.
The moment the doors closed behind them Harry's hands were clenching into his robes and tugging him close insistently. Their mouths came together for the first time in a much anticipated kiss. It didn't take long before Draco was being hauled against Harry’s strong, solid body. Harry’s hands slid down Draco's waist, traced the curve of his slender hips, down the firm muscles of his thighs and around to his arse. The lift dinged at the right floor and Potter took the opportunity to squeeze and
“I should leave. Thank you for dinner, it really was lovely.” With the absence of a child leaning against him Draco stood up quickly. Climbing to his feet and instantly lamenting the loss of the cosy sofa that had seemed to envelop him in warmth and comfort.
“Yes.” Harry said a mere second before his mouth came down upon Draco’s. Draco wasn’t a novice to the desire that spread through his body and alighted each and every nerve whenever Harry touched him. But the little burning flame of hope that ignited in his chest alongside it was new.
“Darling,” Draco said, still in that same low gentle tone, “There’s not a single part of you that’s dark.” Harry’s heart clenched in his chest. He hadn’t told Draco about the Ministry worker, the one who had been so close to killing the man that lay bleeding at his feet. He hadn’t told him about the killing curse, cast from his own wand and hitting it’s mark without a single moment of hesitation.
“Apparently.” Draco replied. One of Harry’s hands found its way to Draco’s hip, and Draco leaned into the warmth that he could feel radiating from that single point of contact.
“How did Dumbledore destroy the rest of them?” Draco asked. Harry realised, fairly horrified, that Dumbledore hadn’t told him. Not once had he mentioned how he had destroyed the ring or the diadem. The diary though, Harry had destroyed that one himself.
Potter slamming him into a wall and screwing him into an inch of his life. But now it really had to stop. Which was difficult with the way Potter was staring at him. With the way he was snaking in and out of the guests to make his way over to Draco.
“Transfiguration essay?” Harry asked, nodding at the parchment still half hanging out of his bag.
“Two things.” Harry said, “I need to get into the Headmaster’s Office.”
“Destroy it.” Harry said, “I-I can’t.” He held the fang out to Draco, careful of the tip soaked in venom.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I needed to go into a shop and the others didn't, they went ahead and when I came out they were gone." Draco was being tight lipped, but if Harry knew him as well as he thought he did (and he did) then Draco wasn't as happy about the turn of events as he was letting on.
“What if there’s a group of people and only one of them has a wand?” Hermione countered. They had since left the room of requirement and were wandering the corridors back up to Gryffindor tower.
“Where were you yesterday?” Hermione asked as she began to pick up pillows from around the room as the students started leaving in groups of two and three. Ron gave them a quick wave before leaving with Neville, he’d managed to bow out of helping with the clean up because he still had half a foot of Charms essay to complete and in Hermione’s words, he needed every minute he could get.
“I’ve not gone and found my Soulmate only to lose him a couple of years later. I plan on hanging onto you Potter, so don’t start getting fanciful dreams of escaping from me any time soon.”
“It was talking to me.” Harry finally said.
Everte Statum was the spell Draco used on Harry in the Duelling Club in Chamber of Secrets, it didn't seem like the sort of spell a First/Second year would know so I like the idea of Narcissa teaching him a few tricks. Also, I don't know if you've noticed but almost every spell in this fic is canon, barring only a few, so are the character names, the classroom locations, their timetables, class content and exam content, with only a few deviations. I hope the amount of research I've put into this has paid off :) I'm really proud of it
“Nope.”
Angst really isn't a speciality of mine so this fic has been a bit of a personal mountain for me. When it gets to that point in the fic I hope I've been able to pull it off :)
was left unspoken.
“Open it?” Ron asked, speaking to the three of them like he was expecting them to vote on the idea, “Kill the Horcrux inside?”
“I just stabbed it.” Harry shrugged, it had been a spur of the moment decision at the time. Destroy the diary, stop Tom Riddle, save Ginny. The Basilisk fang that he had pulled from his arm had been the closest pointy thing to him. The sword had been dropped halfway across the other side of the chamber, next to the dead Basilisk.
. He had said.
“Yes.” Of course he did.
“Yeah, open it. But he might have put enchantments or curses on it, so let’s throw up some shield charms just in case. They followed his word to the letter and Harry watched as the three of them disappeared behind shimmering shields. He carefully unsealed the Basilisk fang and dipped the tip on it into the small vial of venom that Draco had left on the desk.
Snape’s quick apparition out of the Great Hall when faced with the end of McGonagall’s wand brought a wake of silence. The Death Eaters left at the head table were being held at wand point by members of the old and new Dumbledore’s Army. Harry had felt immensely proud of these students once before and this feeling was renewed ten fold at seeing how far they had come. But he couldn’t help the seed of guilt that lodged itself in his throat. They were just kids. They shouldn’t ever have been put in this situation in the first place.

“James, stop feeding your broccoli to the plant.” Draco turned to him and sure enough Harry had caught his son midway through him spearing pieces of broccoli and attempting to flick them into the fern that sat behind his chair. Draco didn’t even know how he had seen it, he was already alternating between feeding himself and feeding the baby, with a fork in each hand.
Draco looked at him carefully, they were standing facing each other now. In the same position they had been when Draco had entered the house, except now there wasn’t a baby wedged between them in the narrow corridor. Draco’s breath hitched in his throat as he met Harry’s gaze, his eyes still shining as brightly through the lens of his glasses as they did when he wore contacts for special occasions. Draco was close enough to see the hint of grey peeking through his hairline, the very slight sprinkle of salt and pepper throughout his otherwise black beard. This version of Potter was very very new to him. He knew Potter to be dashingly handsome and infuriatingly sexy without even trying. He knew the Potter that could make him moan and make his toes curl in pleasure. He knew sleepy Potter, drunk Potter, just fucked Potter, horny Potter...He didn’t know Dad Potter. He didn’t know the man that he had seen today, the one with a three day beard, the one who can cook, the one who laughs as his child slaps her food covered hands against his arm. He had come with the intention of breaking things off. Of telling Harry that the last time had actually been the last time, because he was getting too old to keep messing around with one and two night stands (eight, nine, ten night stand?), he wanted a future with someone. But Hermione’s words almost seemed to echo through his mind, “
“Ginny can you switch to Cho please, you’re casting it really well and she needs a few pointers. And Luna can you partner with Marietta?” Harry asked as he beckoned the other duelling pair closer, he had been trying to switch around the pairings to make sure that everyone who was struggling with the spell was working with someone who had already mastered it. It also stopped friends from grouping together all the time, with these new arrangements they were learning spells faster than ever before and Harry couldn’t be prouder.
“You wanted to talk to me about something?” Harry asked, when Draco’s hand was already reaching for the door handle.
"I-" Potter spun around, leaving his stag to push the Dementors away of its own will. He reached up and cupped Draco's jaw with a pair of strong hands. His palms and his fingertips were calloused and rough, but warm against the cold skin of Draco’s face.
"I hardly think I need to. I know quite well what he's gaining from our arrangement and it has nothing to do with harbouring a deep desire to shag an ex-Death Eater for the rest of his life."
"I don't know."
I need fic recommendations! Please send me your fave HP fics, although Draco/Harry is my OTP I do ship Harry with just about any male in the HP universe so please flood my inbox with your recommendations! I would appreciate it so much, I need some good quality content to read haha.
Much love to you my wonderful readers <3
“Fucking Umbridge.” Harry laughed and nodded in agreement, as he pushed passed him into the dorm room. He pulled off his shirt and threw it over his trunk as he went, “I’m gonna head down to the Great Hall, how long are you gonna be?”
"Oh please Draco, you must think me blind." She looked up from her desk and eyed him with a raised eyebrow and pursed lips.
“Would you think any less of them if you found out that they had made the choice to sacrifice one life to save countless others?” Draco let Harry think on that for a second before continuing with his point, “Because each one has gone through this war before, and each one will have been faced with the same decision as you. And you didn’t just stop him from killing one man, you stopped him from killing all the Witches and Wizards that he would have gone on to torture and kill afterwards.”
.” Only then could Harry feel the tug at his core. Draco was trying to use their magic, but Harry had unknowingly closed himself off, cutting off Draco’s access to his magic and preventing his emotions from leaking down their connection. Harry opened himself up to the tug of Draco’s spell and the magic rushed through him. The blue shimmer of Draco’s shield enveloped him. Cutting him off from the dark swirling magic that filled the rest of the room. Draco stepped even closer to him, having extended his charm to cover Harry as well as himself.

"Think of your happiest memory. And. Cast. The. Spell." He said it slowly and so pointedly that Draco didn’t have it within him to deny Potter again.
“Probably.”
The owl that appeared was a shock to him, but it wasn't to Potter. He'd seen it before. Which meant he'd done it before. Potter didn’t just
"What is the meaning of this?!" She shrilled, motioning at the decimation of various breakfast items strewn across the table.

“What can I do for you, Harry?” Sirius asked.
The rush of magic through his veins was almost as surprising as the silver stag that burst out of his wand. Harry collapsed to his knees in relief as magic filled him from head to toe. Bursting through the metaphorical cobwebs that had filled his disused magical channels. Prongs ran free. Galloping towards the Dementors, chasing them away and impaling them on it's long antlers before stopping to stand guard over the barely conscious Slytherin. Harry joined his Patronus once he was able to remember how to use his legs. He felt shaky from the sudden rush of magic and his head was practically spinning from the onslaught of power that was once again at his fingertips. Prongs disappeared with a low bow of his antlers, scattering into a cloud of white mist. Leaving them alone in the dark and narrow street.
Had to upload this on my phone so I apologise if there are any glaring mistakes :)
Before long they came to a gasping halt at the foot of the statue, running up seven stories wasn’t a feat to be scoffed at and it certainly wasn’t a walk in the park. The golden gargoyle looked down at them with derision. Harry had a sinking feeling that this wouldn’t work, surely this statue didn’t care who resided in the office? It was spelled to respond to a password, not to think for itself and decide who gains entrance. Just as the thoughts spun through his head, clouding over what he thought he had been so sure of, the Gargoyle stepped to one side. Letting both of them past and onto the moving staircase that would take them directly to the office door.
All it came down to, was Harry not hating him anymore. How could he? Ever since the start of term Draco had withdrawn into himself. He had begun to create distance between him and the other Slytherins, at least as much as he could without tipping anyone off. Other people might not have noticed but Harry had, after four years of watching him Harry knew that something had happened over the summer. Something to change his mind about how great and wonderful Voldemort was. And seeing him today on the Quidditch pitch, holding the snitch over his head in delight at finally out flying ‘Harry Potter’, Harry had to admit that he had maybe fallen just a little bit in love with him.
“But I managed to shield him.” Draco added. He was looking at him knowingly and Harry hesitated to look him in the eye. Draco definitely knew that there was more to it than that. He would have felt that Harry had shut him out, he would know that something more would have caused Harry to shut down like he had and pass off destroying the locket to someone else. But at least he was giving Harry the benefit of the doubt for now, allowing him a measure of privacy in front of Ron and Hermione. But Harry knew he should expect Draco’s questions once they were alone.
“Since we have a Basilisk fang to hand I suggest we try that first. We’ll worry about how Dumbledore did it if that doesn’t work.” Hermione said and she was right. They did have a fang to hand, and venom. Maybe that was why Dumbledore had allowed them to keep the harvested parts from the Basilisk. Maybe he had connected to dots with the destroyed Diary and had realised that Harry already had everything he would need to destroy the rest.
"It can get lonely."
“Thanks…” His eyes darted to Hermione once more, “Potter.” He said before turning on his heel and finally walking away. Harry wished Draco wasn’t wearing his outer robe so he could see that glorious arse swaying away from him.
I wasn't sure whether to tag this as a Soulmate fic or not. I didn't want to give away the plot in the tags. Let me know if I should tag it or leave it as a surprise, I'd really like to know your opinions :)
“You don’t think my soul is fractured?” Harry asked.
“Possibly.” Harry said. Truth be told, he didn’t really care, the fact was they had it and they wouldn’t need to go hunting for it. He knew it was the real one, he could feel an uncomfortable warmth in his scar whenever he tried to touch it. It wasn’t painful, not really, just a little odd. Maybe the locket was sensing the residue of Voldemort’s magic?
The secret passage had brought them to the Room of Requirement. Right into the heart of the castle. Harry looked across the faces of everyone who stood in the room beneath them. There were a few surprises, a few Slytherins were sat amongst the collected group. Harry was glad that Draco’s defection had made enough ripples for that to happen. Neville, looking worse for wear than he had at Christmas, was grinning up at them with Seamus by his side. A couple of other Gryffindors looked to be in the same state as Neville, with their arms in slings, and half healed bruises on their faces. Harry was suddenly glad that he and Ron had arrived looking tired and dirty. He wasn’t sure he could face everyone in this room looking like they had just come from a five star hotel. The Manor wasn’t in the best place right now, but they had access to a whole lot of shit that these students didn’t.
I have to give thanks to those who left amazing comments on the last two fics in the series, it's all of your support that has pushed me into completing this. It was bittersweet as this is the last instalment of The Binding Promise series and while I am looking forward to you all reading it, it breaks my heart a little to be saying goodbye to my characters.
Just wanted to say a massive thank you to everyone who's reading this fic and taking the time to kudos or comment. You're all spurring me on to complete my next big project. I appreciate it so much and I celebrate every single hit/kudos/comment/bookmark/subscribe. You're all fantastic <3
“What do we do?” Hermione asked, suddenly unsure of the entire suggestion.
“Hagrid’s hiding a giant in the Forest.” Was the first thing that Harry said to Draco after he had thrown himself into the seat next to him in the library. Draco’s quill hovered over the parchment in front of him with a bead of ink hovering from the tip, and Harry watched it for the full second it took to drop down onto the parchment below.
"How?" Draco asked quietly as his eyes drifted closed.
“You’ll get there next time.” Harry shrugged.
“You just caught the Snitch. You deserve a little celebration.” He pointed out, “Come on,” Harry poked him in the arm, “Come have a Butterbeer with me,” A poke to his thigh, “Draaaa-co.” A poke to his side.
“Good night, Harry.” And Draco apparated home, leaving Harry and the promise of their future date hanging in the air behind him.
“When Hagrid came back to Hogwarts-” Harry said slowly, “He brought a giant back with him.”
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have- It's not important, I'll just see you when you're back at work. Sorry." Draco turned from the door, turning his back on the little family that he had no business getting involved with. He couldn't speak to Potter with his children around, that was just inappropriate.
“Let’s leave the cup for another day.” Hermione suggested once she had let go of them and was looking them over from head to toe to make sure they hadn’t been hurt, “What happened? I couldn’t see anything, the whole room was pitch black.” Harry opened his mouth to tell her what it had said, but he hesitated. He didn’t want them to look at him with even more scrutiny than they currently did. He didn’t want them to think too much about the words from a twisted piece of soul tainted by dark magic. Not until he had worked out for himself what it meant. If it even meant anything at all.
I think that's everything I have to say. I love you all, I appreciate you all, and I hope with all my heart that you continue to follow me on this journey.
The water sluiced over his skin and in the silence of the bathroom his thoughts wandered to Malfoy. Ever since first year he had always had at least one eye on him. He used to think about how much of a pretentious twat he was, with his stupid blonde hair that Harry could have sworn was dyed (until he'd seen Lucius Malfoy with the exact same hair colour). Harry used to hate the way he'd receive parcels weekly, always showing off the box full of sweet treats from home. Harry always used to think he was rubbing it in everyone's faces but it really was just the product of a loving Mother. Seamus got parcels almost weekly too, but Harry never hated him for it. And the way he always excelled in Potions, Harry always put that down to favouritism, but after a year of sitting behind him in class Harry had to admit that Draco really did have some skill in the area. The amount of times something had flown into his potion without causing any irreparable damage was testament to how well he could judge a potion. Even if he was using this knowledge for evil rather than good.

"Is he a stranger, Dad? Should we shut the door?" James asked as he cranked his head up to look at his Father.
“You can’t claim someone as your friend James. If we shuffle you both apart there will be more than enough room for Draco to sit between you both.” Draco walked into the kitchen-dining room behind Albus and Harry sidled passed him so he could put Lily in the highchair. He buckled her in quickly and skirted around the table to lift Albus into a booster seat so he could reach the table comfortably. With a little rearranging of the chairs and an extra placemat and cutlery added, Draco was sat between the two youngest Potter boys. They were staring at him from both sides, looking up at him with their mouths agape.
“No, it’s okay. He might be able to help.” Help calm you down, Harry wanted to say, “Well you know how I’ve been doing Occlumency with Snape-”
"No one will think any less of you if you go into Quidditch you know." Draco pointed out. Harry jumped, but blushed.
“What spells did you find?” He asked. She smiled at him and began telling him about a simple healing charm that might stop someone from bleeding out if they were hit with a cutting curse, and a spell that would transfigure an inanimate item into a weapon.
The cheers for Hufflepuff would usually have killed his euphoric mood entirely. If it weren’t for those impossibly green eyes staring up at him from the Gryffindor stands, waving his green scarf in the air. Cheering for his personal victory. They hadn’t won the game. But he had done his part as well as he could. He saw Harry and Ron push their way through the stands. Harry had already apologised at having to rush away as soon as the match ended, something about promising to visit Hagrid. He shrugged it off, he was happy enough to have a personal cheerleader for the entire game, he could live without a post-game snog.
“I’m sorry that you’ve had to come to us about this. Maybe next time we see you we can borrow Dumbledore’s Pensieve and show you some better memories of your Mum and Dad?”
"I don't think people are too happy." Hermione commented lightly, "Come on, I'll help you collect them all." She began to shuffle them all into piles.
The door opened and Draco stepped through, he approached the desk and placed the charmed lockbox that contained the Cup next to the locket, and next to that he placed a long sealed glass vial that held the second Basilisk fang. He took his place next to Harry once more. Harry felt for his hand, almost desperate to remind himself what their magic felt like when they were together, pleasant, soothing, and nothing like the burning prickle of Voldemort’s magic.
“Gryffindor’s Sword. It’s the key to everything.” He didn’t want to tell Neville about Horcruxes, not unless he absolutely needed to know. It was a long, complicated, discussion that they just didn’t have time for right now. He had planned to visit Dumbledore’s tomb to find the Elder Wand, but it seemed almost unimportant right now. Surely Snape would have retrieved it the moment Voldemort had discovered it’s whereabouts, he was putting his faith in Ollivander’s prediction for Draco’s wand. Right now they needed to focus on keeping the students safe and reclaiming the Castle.
“I killed a man.” Harry whispered, “That’s what the Horcrux was talking about.” Draco stilled, and Harry could feel his chest expanding against his back as he took a long, deep, inhale, “I used an Unforgivable.” Harry continued to say, because now that he was talking about it he couldn’t stop the words from falling out of his mouth.
Sexy times
The spell dissipated. The magic from Voldemort's Horcrux rushed in towards them. Surrounded them. Pressed in against his eyes and his ears until all he could see was blackness and all he could hear was the harsh hissing whisper.
“You know what I mean,
*Spoiler Alert*
Much love to all of you!!

"Get rid of him." Harry leaned close and Draco could feel his knees wobble under the onslaught of Harry’s ridiculous eyes, the smell of his pleasantly spiced cologne, and the deep gravelled growl of his low voice.
” The voice rang through his mind loud and clear, it was warm and welcoming and nothing like the harsh whisper that surrounded him,
"Draco, we were just about to sit down for dinner. Would you like to join us?" Harry called out when Draco had hardly taken two steps away from the front door.
Draco didn’t need to examine the room to discover the first important piece of information, he was standing right next to Harry, and it took a second or two of staring at the side of Harry’s head to work out exactly what was going on. At first he wondered if Harry had been there, in the Memory that Dumbledore had extracted but then he realised Harry was also standing on the side-lines, watching a conversation between Dumbledore and Snape just like he and Hermione were. This wasn’t Dumbledore’s memory, this was Harry’s. He met Hermione’s eye to point this out but she was already nodding in understanding without needing him to say a single word.
Thank you for your patience, I've been working on this since I updated the last chapter of A Binding Promise, but laptop problems meant I was waiting a month for a repair and then a month for another repair and then finally they replaced it. So it took a lot longer than expected to get this out to you.
“Kingsley? Remus? Dumbledore?” Draco questioned, pausing between each name to let Harry know that there was a point to this line of questioning.
“Do you have a permission slip to enter the Restricted Section?” The Librarian asked him with pursed lips and pinched cheeks as she bore down on him, she was shorter than him but for some reason Draco felt like she was looking down at him.
He hated to admit it but he had been wandering around a bit like a zombie the past couple of days. He just couldn’t help but be reminded all day every day about what his Dad had done to Snape. He found his mind wandering on an almost hourly basis towards what type of man his Dad actually was. He had heard nothing but praise for James Potter since he stepped foot into the wizarding world, so this new revelation that his Dad really had been a cocky arsehole like Snape had claimed for the past five years, was scrambling his mind just a little bit. He supposed Draco had a point when he said that people changed, no one stayed their fifteen year old selves forever. He had wanted to put it off even more. But Draco was right, as per usual, this zombie impersonation was interfering in his OWL revisions and he really couldn’t afford to fail anything.

“No,” Harry said distractedly, his eyes had been drawn down to the gold locket which still sat innocently on top of the large wooden desk. He didn’t think that was what the memory was concerning, Horcrux related he was sure, but not how to destroy them. “Dumbledore wasn’t as simple as that.”
“Why did he tell you anyway? He’s been back for months now, surely he could have told you when he first got back?”
“Yes,” Sirius agreed with a small nod, even going as far as to look ashamed of himself, “We were mean, we were childish. We did things that I’m not entirely proud of.”

“Good night, Draco.” Harry said with a small smile that Draco could hardly see through his rough beard.
-ing myself in the corridors.” Draco keeps his tone light.
“Er, morning,” Harry says, more to the room at large than to the man pouring milk into Ron’s favourite mug. He heard them come in last night, of course — the thump of Malfoy’s bedroom door and the low hum of voices. And then the rest.
“Who?” Harry asks, afraid he already knows the answer.
“Right,” Potter gasps, flinches as the car bumps over something. Draco always forgets to remind Granger to swerve. “Sorry. Heard it before.”
Draco briefly entertains the idea of knocking her out. Just for a moment, so they can have a tiny respite from going over what they’ve been over three-hundred times already, but Weasley beats him to it — “Hermione, come on. We didn’t want to delay another month” — and he has to content himself with clenching his hands in his pockets.
“Obviously.” Draco rolls his eyes.
“Notice I’m being gracious and not saying
“Such language, Potter,” she mock-scolds, twisting her head to nose at Harry’s neck. Harry comes again then, quick and shuddering all along Draco’s back.
As if summoned by Draco’s musings, Potter appears in the doorway half-dressed, standing on one leg to stretch the muscles of the other, and looks right at Draco. There’s a heavy silence. He switches legs, grunting slightly, not breaking eye contact.
“So what’s the plan Harry?” Neville and Seamus sidled up on either side of him, with their arms crossed tightly and their eyes narrowed in determination. They had come to the same conclusion as Pansy. This was the beginning of the end.
“What about you Albus?” Draco asked.
“I did.” Draco said with his chest heaving heavily. Harry wanted to kiss him. He wanted so desperately to take those smiling lips beneath his own and kiss him until they were slick and cherry red from the assault. But then Ron was clapping them both on the shoulder, and Hermione was throwing one arm around both of their necks and hugging them until they couldn’t breathe.
“There you are Harry, Hermione’s been looking for you everywhere. Where have you been?”
Your comments fuel me. Thank you all so much for the lovely feedback, I appreciate every single comment and every single Kudos :)
“It was telling me that I had a fractured soul, that it would make my soul whole.” Draco was still and silent behind him. But Harry felt the jump of confusion through his mind, “It said that half of my soul was whole and the other half wasn’t.” Harry paused as he tried to consider those words and what they meant, “But I have no idea what it was talking about.”
“Said I needed more focus on the practical aspects of the spell, not just the theory. Apparently, I could have given more examples of what could happen if it was mis-cast.” Draco had pulled the parchment out again and was reading from the notes that McGonagall had written at the bottom of his essay. Hermione’s eyes were practically bugging out of her skull at the brief but amicable exchange between the Gryffindor and the Slytherin. She had absolutely no idea what was going on between them, Malfoy was being rather civil for a change and neither of them were goading each other into a fight.
“Oh my God.” Hermione panted, “Oh my God. Where have they gone? They’re so stupid. I can’t believe they’d leave like this, what could they possibly have been thinking-” Draco cut her off mid-tirade when he noticed the one item in the room that had been moved.
"Nah, you can have James' dinner."
“I’m not supposed to look approachable!” Draco balked, “I’m a Malfoy!”
“There’s the sword.” Ron pointed at a shelf behind the large desk that stood towards the centre of the room.
“He’s expecting Umbridge to get rid of him sooner rather than later, and he wants us to…keep him company…I guess, and teach him English.”
"I need your Patronus Draco." Harry said through gritted teeth, cutting through Draco’s fear like a knife and distracting him from the hands that were reaching for him from behind Potter's back.
“You think-?” Hermione panted out as Draco took the stairs two at a time and she struggled to keep up with his pace. One of his hands still held hers and Hermione gripped his fingers in return.
"Clean this up." She barked, and turned on her heel. Harry grinned at Hermione behind Umbridge’s back, and helped her gather up the rest of the letters. He knew enough about his crazy fans to know not to open any of them without making sure there were no nasty curses or Potions hidden inside first. He glanced over at Draco once more, and was happy to see that the Slytherin had also realised the potential danger and was gathering up the fallen letters much like they were.
“Alright you two, bed.” Harry came into the room and hustled the boys off the sofa.
“I remember him.” Draco nodded against his shoulder.

“I’m not cumming in my underwear like some kind of degenerate. Especially not in a dusty broom shed. I do have some class, you know?”
Potter could perform an Auror level spell when he was thirteen.

“What’s up kid?” Sirius’s eyebrows drew down and his forehead creased as he frowned. Not that Harry would ever point out that he had wrinkles.
“I-Yes…”
"Alright, it's a date." The American slanted a half smile at him, flashing him with a row of pearly white teeth. Draco faltered at that, he hadn't meant to invite him as a date at all. The man was attractive there was no doubt about that, not too tall, light brown hair that was neatly styled with care, brown eyes, and a nice smile. His robes were clean and while not this season definitely would have been last season, which meant he cared about his appearance but he wasn't obsessed (not like Draco). He was nice. Attractive. But he wasn't Harry Potter. And Draco was so embroiled into this odd
I await your responses to this new fic and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking this journey with me.
wait until after their day of classes before he talked to her, and catching her without Ron was imperative. It would have been almost impossible to pull her away from him without arousing suspicion.
“And the cup.” Harry reminded him. It had been smuggled out of Grimmauld Place before they had been forced to evacuate the house after Dumbledore’s death and Sirius had given it to Draco with a nod of understanding and a solid squeeze to the shoulder. He hadn’t known what it was, but he knew that it was damn important.
“Thank you Dear.” Harry said sarcastically, but he pulled the notes closer and began to read through them.
“Where were we up to?” She asked as she draped her bag and outer robe over one of the two spindly chairs that were set up next to the single small study table that had been provided in that area of the library. She rolled up the sleeves of her school shirt and bundled her wild hair up in a large bun at the back of her head.
"See you later." Harry said as Ron stood and walked away.
“We didn’t win.” Draco said, trying to shrug off the compliment but flushing under Harry’s scrutiny.
No. Draco began to shake his head silently as Dumbledore talked. No. Absolutely not. No. This wasn’t right, this couldn’t be right. Dumbledore had to be wrong. Harry? His wonderful, loving, caring, Harry, living all his life with a part of Voldemort’s soul inside of him. His Harry, a Horcrux? Hermione’s fingers slid between his own as she silently shuffled even closer to grip his hand between both of hers.
Gryffindor’s sword was shielded by a long glass case, sitting on a golden plinth. They rounded the desk silently, careful not to touch anything or knock anything out of place. For months Harry had been working with Moody to detect the nuances of curses and protection spells. He was glad all that knowledge wasn’t about to be wasted, Harry could see light shimmering across the glass in one direction, but when he tilted his head to the side he could see a slight shimmer in the opposite direction as well. That indicated that there was more than one protection spell around the case.
“I’ll work on a plan for this Coup.” Seamus said.
Also, apologies if the format of this is all off, my laptop is failing me so when I get that sorted I'll go back and re-format everything. Hopefully it uploads alright though :)
Instead of casting a string of counter spells like he had originally intended, Harry levelled his wand at the glass and recalled the dark magic detection spell that Draco had taught him when they had been searching for the Diadem. Unlike the Diadem, the case containing Gryffindor’s Sword didn’t light up with the tell tale glow of dark magic. That meant no hexes. No curses. No spell with evil intent.
“I thought you were kidding when you said pure dumb luck.” Ron said from his side as they took the steps two at a time.
“Hey,” Harry held his hands out defensively, “Don’t look at me like that, I didn’t name him.”
"Harry! You don't have any magic!" Hermione yelled after him, but he couldn't just stop and wait for someone to get there. Draco could be gone by then.
“If you go down a floor to the Barking Mad Gargoyle on the balcony, under him is a set of stairs that lead straight to the Entrance Hall. They move so it’ll cut a good ten minutes off. He talks though and he’s a bit of a dick but he’ll move if you ask nicely.” Harry directed, and Draco’s lips quirked again in concealed gratitude.
“Oh Merlin.” Draco’s hands tightened around Hermione’s and he could feel the same panic seeping into his body, “Harry.” His feet began to move before he could stop them.
“This is good though. Is this the last one we needed to find?” Hermione asked.
“I didn’t even see the Snitch first you know.” Draco said lightly.
"I decided that any version of Draco was better than no version of Draco."
"Daaaad!"
.” No, No! Draco’s hands began to shake as he watched Harry stand up from the desk chair and cross to his side of the bed. Draco followed half a step behind. He tried to ignore Hermione who was standing in the corner of the room with her hands covering her mouth and her eyes wide and tearful.
Love you all, thank you for the wonderful wonderful comments. I read and appreciate every single one and I reply where I can. Next chapter is a little bit of fan service after seeing our boys in so much pain ;)
“Seekers prerogative.” Harry grinned and shrugged, “Do you want to come up to Gryffindor? I think the twins managed to pilfer some Firewhiskey from the House-Elves.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked while feigning innocence.
"Harry!" Harry was cut off from answering when a Jack Russell Terrier and an Otter came streaming through the darkness, sending Dementors scattering in all directions. Draco jumped away and Harry missed the contact the moment it was removed, but he didn't dare speak of it in front of Ron.
.” Harry continued, and Draco stepped closer so that he could watch as the emotions passed across Harry’s face. His hand fell from Hermione’s grip and she took a few steps back to allow him to approach Harry alone.
“It’s too late to worry about that now.” Hermione interrupted, not wanting to allow Harry to ponder on it for too long, “How did you destroy the Diary?”
"Malfoy." Harry said, and he spoke the way he fucked. With a deep, gruff voice and blunt words that jumped straight to the point.
Harry found himself trying to come up with a half answer, anything that would get Draco to back off until he had managed to organise his own mind on the matter. He could feel his body start to twitch, urging him to turn away and leave the room, to leave Draco waiting for an answer until he was ready to give one. But they had already spoken about this. About their mutual penchant for fleeing from their problems rather than facing each other and talking them through. Harry hadn’t realised how far the bad habit had ingrained into him until this moment. He fought against his instinct to run and his instinct to brush Draco off and he crossed the room, passing Draco to sit at the end on their bed.
“What happened to you?” As Harry had expected Draco waited until the door of their bedroom had shut behind them before asking Harry all the questions that he had managed to store away.
The curtains opened. He mounted his broom and kicked off hard. He swooped out of the corridor that led from the changing area to the pitch, ducking slightly lower to make it out of the entrance so he didn’t brain himself on the low beam. He circled the pitch twice. He loved playing Quidditch, not quite as much as Harry of course, but he loved being on a broom hovering fifty foot in the air, he loved how crisp the air was and how close the clouds were. This was freedom. He took in the stands full of students, and the raised areas where the teachers were seated. He scanned the crowd, but it only took a second to find Harry, a blob of green amongst the sea of yellow supporters, his eyes were locked on Draco completely. Grinning up at him from where he was hanging over the edge of the raised stands, hanging half out onto the pitch and ignoring the rest of the players in favour and clapping and cheering just for him. He eased himself into place opposite Summerby, the Hufflepuff Seeker.
“I guess I’ll go collect the fang.” Draco said with pursed lips, Harry knew he was probably mentally cursing Dumbledore’s memory for leaving them thoroughly underprepared for the task at hand. Harry might have warmed to Dumbledore after the events at the Ministry but Draco still hadn’t forgiven him for the harsh treatment and unnecessary questions when he had been under the influence of Veritaserum.
“What was it?” Harry asked.
Draco and Hermione watched in horror, along with a ghostly Harry, as Dumbledore begged Snape to kill him. To fulfil exactly what the Dark Lord had demanded of him. Dumbledore hadn’t suspected, for a moment, that Snape hadn’t been loyal. He had been playing Dumbledore the whole time and the older wizard hadn’t figured it out at all, or maybe he had? And it just wasn’t important at the time, it seemed that either way Snape needed to kill Dumbledore.
“I agree. What about …” Hermione trailed off, stopping in her tracks and staring at the person who had stepped out of the Transfiguration classroom in front of them.
Harry was spreading jam on toast for his breakfast when the owls entered the Hall with that day's post. Harry only needed to glance up at the ridiculous amount of owls streaming through the charmed sky to know that the Quibbler had already made the rounds in some circles. The first owl to land was from Xenophilias Lovegood, holding a rolled up copy of the Quibbler. Harry took it, petted the owls feathers in thanks and waited for it to fly away.
"Don't say those things about yourself Draco. Harry would be lucky to shag you for the rest of his life. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that he couldn't find someone more perfect for him in every way. You know, he self-deprecates too, you're a perfect match.
He was acting like some kind of idiotic Gryffindor lately. He didn’t need to give a shit about what people thought of him. He knew he didn’t have anything to worry about, they didn’t know what he was doing, if they did he wouldn’t be sat in the Library studying, he would be getting escorted up to Dumbledore's office and arrested on the spot. He didn’t give a shit if they were talking about him, he was better than them. He was better than all of them, and he had something far more important to worry about than winning Quidditch and passing NEWTs. He had to stop thinking about Potter and he had to concentrate on the tasks he had been given. Failure was absolutely not an option.
