The taunts and jinxes en route to the Hall were expected, but thankfully none of his detractors were aware of Harry’s new House yet. The others unanimously decided not to wear anything obviously Slytherin to dinner, sticking to the neutral pieces of their uniforms, while Harry chose his favourite worn jeans and equally well-loved blue cotton tee. It felt odd to not see a hint of green or silver among them, but he appreciated his friends granting him a small reprieve. They were all too aware that his appearance at breakfast tomorrow in his new colours would incite a riot.
“I like it,” Draco said, halting Harry’s stilted movements as he breezed into the room. “Blaise did a good job with that bird’s nest on your head.”
No one outside of his unwanted fan club had ever looked at him like that. But where the fans worshipped him because of who they thought he was, Draco
Harry opened and closed his mouth in shock as Ron stalked toward him. His knees gave out, and he sank to the floor with an aborted whimper, heart flying into his throat as his best friend stared coldly down at him.
list every character. I will mark Ron and Dumbledore, but I personally hate flooding tags with unnecessary anecdotes, so I will not be playing that game.
Pressing a soft kiss to his throat, Draco whispered, “I love you, too, and I have my own promises to keep, you know?” His lips curled into a wicked smirk when Harry’s breath hitched.
“Yes. We know things are moving, have been for some time. The revel at the World Cup was just the beginning. This could be the next phase.”
“Thank you!” Theo exclaimed, catching half of the hall’s attention. Clearing his throat, he lowered his voice and continued, “Taunts and trash talk are one thing, but blatantly terrorizing a fellow student, a
Fisting the front of his robes, Harry yanked him the rest of the way, groaning softly into the kiss when their chests pressed together and his fingers dove into silky blond strands. His eyes rolled back in his head when Draco’s hand migrated to his curls and tugged lightly, his other arm snaking possessively around Harry’s back and holding him in place.
Snape’s robes hadn’t even billowed out of the exit before they bombarded Harry with well-wishes. Thankfully, his friends stepped in, acting as a barrier between him and his enthusiastic housemates so they couldn’t swarm him. Crabbe’s sharp whistle pierced the mad chatter, freezing everyone in their tracks.
All this time Draco assumed Harry’s friends and family treated him the way the world did—like a hero, a king. Instead, he was appalled to find they had denied him the bare minimum of human decency until he arrived at Hogwarts. No wonder he rejected Draco when they were younger; his entitled attitude must’ve been absolutely grotesque to a child who lived in a goddamned cupboard.
His even tone and mild manner set Harry’s teeth on edge, but before he could say something he’d regret, Professor Snape stepped in.
With murmured thanks, they settled on the conjured chairs, nibbling their flaky snacks and sipping the refreshing water while peeking surreptitiously around the humble quarters. Draco took the opportunity of his godfather’s undivided attention to rope him into a conversation on the differences between snowdrop flowers and Lady’s Mantle in the Beautification Potion. If his plan had the benefit of allowing the others time to eat without feeling uncomfortable, well, that was just a bonus.
Draco nodded in solemn understanding, wishing he could smother the anxious boy in a hug. “Ready to call it a night?”
“Which means we aren’t dealing with a student out to humiliate Harry. We know the tournament has a high mortality rate. He was targeted,” Draco continued, turning Harry’s blood to ice as his worst fears were confirmed. Another year, another person out to kill him. Merlin, couldn’t he catch a break?
Draco chuckled weakly as he tugged Harry’s hair, the answering groan of approval travelling straight to his cock. “I hate this bird’s nest atop your head unless my fingers are buried in it or the wind is whipping it when you fly.” He moaned when Harry nipped his earlobe. “It should be illegal to let you on a broom. No one should look that delicious in Quidditch leathers.”
As though reading his mind, silver eyes met his across the hall and Harry’s grin slipped. A mixture of uncertainty and hope bubbled in his chest as Malfoy’s laugh trailed off when their gazes locked.
Meeting Harry’s gaze, he held it earnestly. “I know words will not be enough, but I am so very sorry. I haven’t been fair to you in the past, however, if I’m to be your new Head of House I need you to understand that I
Clenching his jaw to prevent the sob in his throat from escaping, Harry tipped his head in terse acknowledgement. Looking at Draco beside him, he saw the scarlet stain on his cheeks and the blanching of his lip around a single incisor. It should bother Harry that he told Snape about his life with the Dursleys when he promised not to break his confidence, but it didn’t. Draco trusted his godfather to give a damn and help him, and he’d been right. Besides, he’d been just as blindsided by the man’s connection to his mother as Harry.
Lifting his head with a weak smile, he asked, “You wouldn’t happen to have any chocolate biscuits and tea, would you, Dobby?” Snapping his fingers with a broad grin, a perfectly laid out tea tray appeared with his favourite biscuits. “Thanks. I know you have things to do. I should be okay now.”
“It’s really that bad, then?” Crabbe asked, voice gentler than Harry had ever heard it. He screwed his eyes shut to stem the prickle of tears in response to the larger boy’s concern.
“Thank you, Harry,” Cedric said, clapping him lightly on the shoulder. Fleur scooped him in an overwhelmingly floral hug, still prattling in her mother tongue, while Draco and Cedric tittered behind them. When she released him at last, Harry sucked in a blessedly unscented breath and discreetly shot two fingers at Draco, which only made the boy laugh harder.
“You are well within your rights to request such action, Mr. Potter. Normally I would put up more of a fight, but I know what took place moments ago was a genuine reaction, borne from fear. Even if your fellow roommates hadn’t intended to cause you physical harm, they terrorized you and that is harm enough. I am very sorry this happened, and that you didn’t feel you could come to me.” She paused and looked at the others in her office. “Though, it seems you have found worthy champions in Slytherin, which I am both surprised and pleased to see.”
for you, Harry, as I should have from the start. You are Lily’s son, the only piece of her left in this world, and I promise not to let either of you down again. I hope you can forgive me in time, but if not, I at least hope you can trust me.”
“Okay,” Harry agreed, disguising how much his words meant to him with a smirk. Exchanging a mischievous glance, they burst into slightly manic laughter, imagining the frightening ways Pansy could bring a man to his knees.
There wasn’t a hint of hostility or aggression in their magic—only warmth and acceptance. The students he once believed were all Death Eaters-in-training welcomed him with open arms, pledging safety and solidarity in the nest. Biting back his giddy laughter, the excess magic tingled in his veins before fading away, leaving him lightheaded in its absence.
His cheeks flushed prettily and Hermione smirked. “Come on, Prince Charming. Time to wake Snow White.”
The tables groaned under the weight of a variety of dishes, including regional fare for their foreign guests. Blini and caviar, duck à l’Orange and gougères stood out amongst the less ostentatious shepherd's pie and Yorkshire pudding. Sharing an eager look, Harry and Ron wasted no time piling their plates with delicacies.
“I thought I hated you,” he panted against Draco’s bobbing Adam’s apple, “but it turns out I really don’t, and I much prefer this to hexing you.”
Tightening his hold on the coin, Draco swallowed hard. For all that Harry circled him, he had genuine friends in Granger and Weasley. And while Draco was jealous of their bond, he was immensely grateful that whatever the future held for Harry, he wouldn’t face it alone. With Granger’s brilliance and Ron’s loyalty to curb Harry’s brashness, he would win the coming war.
Gods, they’d know. Snape and Pomfrey would find out everything and they would pity him and look at him with sorrowful, wounded eyes. He’d become nothing more than the abused orphan who couldn’t use his magic to protect himself. A useless wizard. A freak in both the Muggle and the wizarding world.
Hope sang through the bond and Draco flushed at his transparency until he realized it wasn’t one-sided. Tightening his hold on the smaller boy, he whispered, “Me, too.”
When he was sure his roommates were asleep, he crawled on shaky limbs to his trunk, pulling out his invisibility cloak and the Marauder’s Map. Muffling his footsteps, he crept out of the dorm and wandered the halls of the castle, ignoring the sniffles that accompanied his constant tears.
“Good day, Ms. Skeeter,” Blaise replied coolly, trailing his friends at a leisurely pace to give the others ample time to flee while acting as a buffer against the foul woman. When he strolled into the classroom a few moments after them, he found Draco in whispered conversation with Professor Snape and Harry squished between Theo and Pansy, his expression set in an unsettlingly blank mask.
Cursing his fair complexion as his cheeks grew hot under Harry’s piercing gaze, Draco huffed a weak laugh. “Yes, seems so.”
“Look, I’ve lost...enough people to that bastard. I can’t...I can’t lose anymore, goddamn it.” Forcing himself to maintain eye contact with the other man through the sting of salt water, he confessed, “Not even you. Maybe...especially you.”
Could they bury the hatchet and have a genuine connection? Since entering the world of magic and learning about the soulmark that began appearing when he turned eleven, he dreamed of the special person who would love him for
“Thank you for telling me,” Draco said, voice hoarse from restraining his shouts. “I know it wasn’t easy to be honest. I won’t break your confidence, but I will inform the others of your triggers. Believe me when I say they will accept and respect them. Most of us in Slytherin do.”
“Will it though?” she snapped. “How many girls have snuck into the hospital to plant their lips against his, yet he’s still bloody unconscious! Hell, McGonagall even asked Cho for help and that didn’t work, either. She was the only one we knew about, and he hasn’t been honest with us for so long that we’re left grasping at straws.”
“Ice mice,” she said curtly to the gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore’s sanctum. As soon as the wall slid open, she marched up the stairs, fully expecting the others to follow. Theo and Draco shared an excited look, having never been granted access to the Headmaster’s office. Harry and Snape hid their smiles at their enthusiasm, dutifully trailing after McGonagall.
“Merlin, Harry, so do I,” Draco confessed before resealing their lips in a desperate clash of teeth and tongues and hunger until he wrenched away with a gasp when his lungs begged for oxygen. “When I saw you in the mirror, I thought you came to kill me. I would’ve let you. A convenient loophole in the Dark Lord’s plan,” Draco smiled grimly.
Krum’s heavy brows drew together as a thought crossed his mind. “Vhy didn’t they find a...vhat do you call it?”
“We have a Champion. We don’t need you,” he hissed. Spinning on his heel, Ron climbed on his bed and spelled his curtains closed. The others followed suit and noxed the light, leaving Harry curled in a ball with his terrified panting the only sound in the darkness.
“Very good,” Severus replied blandly, employing all of his skill as a spy to mask his amusement. “Come to me immediately if either you or Potter need anything.”
love him, but if he doesn’t love you back, he’s gonna keep napping,” Fred finished with a grimace. “Sorry, sis,” he mumbled as he hopped off the table.
“Where was the Gryffindor honour they’re renowned for when one of their own nearly collapsed in fright? There was no false bravado in Potter tonight; there was only fear. And we know a thing or two about that, don’t we, Uncle?” His knuckles blanched on the back of the settee as he stared down his nose at his godfather.
Yet, the more he thought about it, the less crazy it seemed. Draco despised the Boy Who Lived persona as much as he did (if not more, truthfully) and he sure as hell didn’t need Harry’s money.
Ginny’s freckles stood in stark relief across her ashen features. “Where is he?” she asked woodenly.
Harry quickly turned away from his taller, broader frame with a furious blush. His gut churned with inadequacy when he realized he was surrounded by blokes appropriately proportioned for their age. They were growing into their jawlines and filling out their clothes as they packed on muscle and gained inches overnight, but he was “stunted.” Cursed to never reach his full potential; doomed to remain the runt of their year.
feelings, which might explain why Harry hadn’t said anything. How could he, if he was too dense to realize he actually liked the posh prat?
“Yes,” Draco agreed hoarsely as he dove in for a kiss. Unlike Harry’s rather chaste one, this was passion and heat and quickly found them shoved against a wall as Harry pressed their bodies flush.
He barely nodded in the affirmative before his arms were full of a bushy-haired Gryffindor squeezing the life out of him, though he had to admit he didn’t hate it.
Deciding it was time for a little honesty of his own, Draco said, “I know it’s hard to believe, but I never wanted to be your enemy. I didn’t even know who you were in Madam Malkins, after all.” Sighing regretfully, he continued, “This may surprise you, but I don’t exactly have...experience making friends, so I went about it all wrong.”
Draco's stomach dropped when Harry’s pupils shrank to pinpricks as he glanced frantically around the partitioned area and cursed his stupidity when he realized too late what triggered his panic attack. Placing their linked hands over his chest, Draco curled his free one around his wand and quickly enlarged the space.
“Alright, Mr. Potter,” Pomfrey said when they separated. “This will be a comprehensive exam, and will give us your full medical history.” Harry stiffened and clutched Draco’s hand, closing his eyes against the sea of black that would soon fill the parchment.
“I don’t hate Potter,” he bristled. His godson arched a disbelieving brow, and he regretted ever teaching him the art. Sinking into his chair with a tired sigh, Severus stared at the fire when he answered.
Sighing heavily, he nodded in understanding before pressing a lingering kiss to Draco’s cheek. “Take care of yourself. I’ll find you when it’s over,” Harry whispered.
“Yes, Mione,” he replied curtly, a twinge of regret twisting under his ribs as his friends winced at his tone. Sighing heavily, Harry shoved his glasses up and rubbed his eyes wearily. “I’m sorry if I sound cross, I’m just tired from Dumbledore’s lessons. I know you both care and I appreciate it, but sometimes I need to breathe.”
“Do you even need to ask?” Draco teased, secretly delighted when Harry’s blush deepened. Brushing their lips in a featherlight caress, he murmured, “Yes, Harry. We’re boyfriends.”
He meant what he said, though he purposefully avoided mentioning the jealous streak that wouldn’t allow him to share, in any sense. He had years to convince him they should be together if Harry wasn’t initially keen on the idea. While Draco may not have much patience, he
Draco assessed him coolly and spun his glass in his hand. “We’re both intimately familiar with preventing the sins of the father from rubbing off on the son, are we not, Uncle?”
It was a more domestic image than most of their peers would attribute to Slytherin House, who preferred to assume the worst of the snakes. Of course, a year ago Harry probably would’ve joined in with the Gryffindors’ digs at Draco’s poncy behaviour, but now he saw it for what it was.
where he is.” Severus frowned contemplatively as the boy worked out his theory. “Surely the Headmaster is also aware the Goblet was tampered with and that he didn’t put his name in there by choice. The only reason he’s left Harry with us is because —”
“As for McGonagall, I don’t believe the Gryffindors have told her that Harry is staying elsewhere or she’d have confronted him at dinner,” Draco reasoned.
Tugging gently on his shoulder, Draco jerked his head to the hall leading to the dorms. “Come along, Potter. We’ve things to discuss.” Harry followed without complaint, inclining his head to those who tipped theirs or smiled politely as he passed.
Smiling serenely, she inclined her head as he admitted defeat. “Of that, I am certain, Lucius. I’ll see you at dinner. Do try to be sober for it.”
Draco’s hand brushed Harry’s when he returned the timetable, and though his expression was carefully blank, his eyes sparkled with mischief at the secret touch in a hall full of people. Nodding his thanks, Harry lowered his gaze so he wouldn’t give them away, but the weight of grey eyes remained heavy on his back as they headed to class.
A memory from the World Cup flashed across Harry’s mind and he dithered with indecision before leaning closer. “Excuse me, I couldn’t help overhearing your conversation, but I might have an idea for a wing substitute.”
“Fair enough,” she said while Harry staved off a blush with thoughts of Hagrid in a bikini in order to maintain their anonymity.
The common room erupted into shouts of rage and anguish, some of the younger girls were already mourning the loss of the Boy Who Lived with wails to rival a banshee. While George fended off their sister’s physical and verbal attacks with a couch cushion, Fred leapt on the coffee table and amplified his voice with a
Draco’s lips twitched as though reading his mind and Harry bit back a sarcastic retort for fear of seeming ungrateful. Truthfully, her willingness to sacrifice something so invaluable to ensure his safety touched him. Sighing in defeat, Harry squeezed Pany’s arm with a weak smile.
“You’ve been horrible, it’s true, but I understand why you had to be, Malfoy. Speak to Harry about it. He’ll help you.” Leaning out of the embrace, her brown eyes crinkled with her warm smile. “
Scoffing bitterly, Draco said, “I’m forever trying to emulate my father instead of being myself. I should know by now that won’t win me favours with anyone.”
Is this what his life would’ve been like if he’d let the Sorting Hat have its way? Did he really belong with them? Had he made a mistake choosing Gryffindor because of prejudicial remarks about an entire House? He was eleven when he decided, and he couldn’t say for certain anymore he made the right choice.
As if on cue, Draco and Theo widened their stance and clasped their hands behind their back with a defiant jut of their chins. Harry smothered a grin at their militant arrogance. Choosing to remain relaxed while the taller boys acted as personal sentinels, Harry arched a brow and glanced at the letter in her hands meaningfully.
“Oh, gods,” Draco groaned, cautiously pressing his fingers to what he could see of his neck, hoping Potter wasn’t about to scare the shit out of him as the new headless ghost of Gryffindor. But the skin under his fingers was warm, and a steady pulse thrummed under his touch.
“Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall said primly, forcing him to let go of Draco far sooner than he liked.
Taking in his friends’ earnest expressions, he sagged against the arm of the couch with a relieved sigh. Deep down, he was sure they wouldn’t betray him, yet the fear lingered in the back of his mind. Lucius would never hesitate to exploit anyone’s weak points and he’d been raised to do the same. Which was terrifying, since Harry would forever be Draco’s greatest weakness, but his friends' loyalty rested with him—not their parents—for which he was eternally grateful.
“Harry,” Draco started, “before I go, let me apologize.” Harry opened his mouth to protest, but he held up a hand to stop him. “No, I need to say this. I don’t know when I’ll see you again and I can’t bear the thought of you not hearing it. I’m sorry for every thoughtless word or insult said to you or your friends. For drawing out a moment of wounded pride at eleven and turning it into a bitter feud that caused us both pain. I’m sorry for so many things I can’t even list them all.”
“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, might I borrow Ms. Chang?” McGonagall asked in the middle of third period. The man blinked in surprise at the unexpected interruption but readily agreed.
“Yes, sir.” Setting aside his unfinished water, Draco stood and nodded formally. “Good night, Uncle Sev and…thank you.”
Dumbledore seemed unsurprised by their appearance as he magnanimously invited them to sit. Harry wasted no time dancing around pleasantries as he barrelled into an explanation for their visit. The Headmaster listened patiently, his eyes sweeping calmly between them during the tale. Once Harry finished speaking, the older wizard poured him a glass of water and levitated it over.
Harry smiled as Pansy distracted him. It was hard to believe he thought her a stuck-up brat when he now knew how caring she was beneath her society veneer. For a moment, it reminded him of Hermione. Though walking into the Great Hall in his new House colours and witnessing the eruption from the Gryffindor table soured his memories.
The matron’s neutral expression slipped when she shook her head. “I’m sorry, Mr. Potter, but even magic has its limits in cases of long-term malnourishment.”
Oh, damn. That was an excellent point and Harry could tell by the angry hisses the Slytherins agreed.
“I know, Draco,” he replied. “That’s why I like you. I’m not the Boy Who Lived with you; I’m just Harry. You accept me and my flaws and you’ve never made fun of me for not knowing something a five-year-old would.”
“I’m so sorry, my dear,” McGonagall said, voice wavering with heartbreak. Hadn’t her students suffered enough? Would it never end? “Nothing I say will ever make it better, and my words seem paltry at best, but I am so very sorry. I’m here if you ever need to talk, Ms. Chang. Day or night, my office is always open.”
Please, leave kudos and comments! They give me life and encouragement to keep the story alive!! Love you guys! Thanks for reading!!
Harry took another step and Draco’s shoulders tensed, expecting a brawl to break out between them like last year on the Quidditch pitch. “Then what in Salazar’s name are you doing?” he hissed, his grip on his wand tightening to keep it steady as his heart lodged in his throat. What the fuck was Potter playing at?
Fleur pinned her ice-blue eyes on her cousin. “I do not understand ‘ogwarts politics, but I feel dat iz significant.”
“When I saw you unharmed, I nearly collapsed with relief, and created the portkey to get you safely away,” Draco continued. “Then this mess with the Goblet happened, and I was equal parts livid and terrified. Tell me how I’m to keep you safe if the world is intent on hunting you?”
. He’d never been a great actor, but he was skilled at hiding his pain and loneliness behind his quick temper.
Tracing his scar with a grimace, Harry reminded himself people had a habit of seeing what they wanted to see. The public loved putting him on a pedestal and praising his feats of daring, instead of recognizing that it was actually a reckless disregard for his life because he had no self-worth. Those who loathed him now would congratulate him in time—they always did—until then, he just had to keep a stiff upper lip. And with Slytherin House supporting him, it might be possible to survive the backlash.
Swallowing hard, she asked, “When you said keeping Harry at arm’s length was to protect him, does that mean you don’t hold your father’s views?”
“I cannot share the particulars,” he hedged, “but I know your heart was not in the task granted you, or I would already be dead. You’re too intelligent and your magic too strong to not get the job done, so to speak, if you wished.”
A muted rumble vibrated through him when the smaller boy chuckled and Draco’s eyes fluttered shut without permission at the delightful sensation. Pulling out of their embrace, Harry hastily dried his face of the tears that escaped and nodded, too overwhelmed to speak.
Draco's eyes widened when he realized the cloaked figure who usually occupied the canvas was absent. “Shit,” he hissed. “I’ll notify everyone to censor what is said in the common room, then.”
Harry’s lungs stuttered as he blinked stupidly at the suave bastard. His brain was too frazzled to come up with a sarcastic quip to take the edge off the entirely too honest sentiment, or to dismiss the drying charm that wicked away his panic-induced cold sweat. His only saving grace was that Draco didn’t comment on the blush staining Harry’s cheeks when he dropped the muffling spell.
“So, when I was face-to-face with a cute boy without my father around, I fell into old habits because I didn’t know how else to behave. I stupidly thought my name would be enough to convince you I was worth knowing because it worked with my other friends. Every time I’ve goaded you into a fight was a desperate plea for your attention. Even your animosity was better than nothing. I just wanted you to see me,” Draco whispered forlornly.
“Bullshit,” Draco snapped, daring to step closer. His heart rate increased in time with Harry’s, but while his sudden proximity startled the usually bold boy, he wasn’t frightened of him. Pushing his luck, Draco moved further into his space.
“I wasn’t certain about your feelings, but I knew mine,” he replied with a blush. “It’s why I ate the apple. It was partly to piss off Umbridge, yeah, but I saw it and couldn’t stop thinking of you. It was practically taunting me throughout detention. You’re always snacking on them and you adore apple tarts and apple crumb cake. Anything apple, really. I can’t see the damn things without thinking of you,” he admitted shyly, forcing Draco to smother his pleased grin in his shoulder.
“You’re nothing like him, Draco,” Harry soothed. “Your concern about coming across that way proves it. You’re a better person than you give yourself credit for and you absolutely did not force me into anything. You asked, I agreed, and you even checked in again to be sure I was still okay.” Pressing a kiss to his shoulder, he asked, “So, why’d you bolt?”
His steps faltered as she led him toward the curtained bed tucked at the back of the wing. Laying a gentle hand on his shoulder, she whispered, “I’ll leave you alone. I’ll be in Madam Pomfrey’s office if you need anything.”
Theo nodded absently as the group of long-time friends chewed on his words. They knew there was more to the story, but they were also aware Draco scrupulously held his friends’ counsel. If Potter didn’t want them hearing the details, then it would never pass Draco’s lips. While it was a frustrating attribute, it was one they respected, considering they benefited from his reticence, too.
“Hello, Harry. I’m Draco and I’m bloody glad to join,” he smiled, though he sobered quickly when Harry tried to extract his hand. Holding firm, he forced the Gryffindor to look at him.
“Yes,” Draco said, dragging out the word with a frown. “Does Gryffindor not offer Sanctuary to those who need it?” Harry shrugged helplessly and Draco scowled, muttering darkly under his breath.
Clicking his tongue, Draco replied, “No, I don’t mind or I wouldn’t have offered. And neither will the others. You’re one of us now.”
Shame curdled his gut as he recalled his treatment of the boy. Merlin, he was no better than that harpy and her detestable husband.
Clinging desperately to the man he gained, only to lose in the same night, Draco bit back a sob. “Of course, I’ll wait. I’ll wait forever if I have to. I just got you, Harry, I’m not giving you up now.”
Kissing the air next to his cheeks in goodbye, she sauntered out the door with deadly grace and Harry made a mental note to get pointers later. The lads wished him luck with claps on the back and promised a game of cards to unwind after his meeting before following Pansy to the common room.
With a surge of affection for his soulmate, Harry dragged Draco in for a heated kiss. One that promised a new beginning between two souls forever entwined.
“You’ll walk in with me,” Draco said, his voice unruffled despite the rosy tint high on his cheeks. “A united front. They won’t believe it if they don’t see it. Just remember: they’re all talk, so don’t listen to a whit of it. Our friends will be right behind us. Nothing will happen to you, Harry, I swear.”
Smirking through his answering flush, Harry quipped, “Ever hear the more a boy pulls your pigtails, the more he likes you? That’s us in a nutshell.”
“You can wait outside then, boy,” Moody said, pointing his gnarled wand at the door. “We can’t have you spying and reporting back to your
A heavy silence descended as their stoic leader broke down in a rare moment of vulnerability. Having known one another since they could walk, the six of them were thick as thieves. There had been plenty of opportunities when they’d skived off their private lessons to fly their brooms or searched the darkest nooks and crannies of their manors, despite their parents’ warnings, to see the pampered heir crumble. Yet, this was only the fifth time in ten years that any of them saw Draco cry.
Harry met Draco’s uncertain gaze and nodded. “I trust you,” Harry said, startling Cedric with his sincerity. Krum and Fleur frowned at Cedric’s shocked gasp, knowing there was a crucial piece to the puzzle they were missing.
“You better,” Draco choked, blinking away a fresh onslaught of tears. With a sad smile and a parting squeeze of his hand, Harry hustled out of the office without a backward glance.
“Welcome to Slytherin,” Theo chirped as he exited the showers in a towel. Snatching his wand from a nearby cubby, he cast a drying charm on himself and set about getting dressed.
“Yeah,” Draco choked, throat tight with repressed emotion, causing Harry’s eyes to sting further. “You truly have no idea, which brings me to another important point: Harry has triggers.”
Burying his head on his knees, he swallowed the lump in his throat. “I can’t win with the lot of them, no matter what I do. But your acceptance has me reconsidering everything. I’ve been kicking myself all night for telling the Sorting Hat where to place me.”
Stick around—things will be picking up in the next two chapters! Featuring more Drarry content and good Slytherins!
She raised her hands deferentially with a firm shake of her head. “No, it’s best if you don’t. But do keep me apprised, if you please.”
Harry’s chest tightened uncomfortably, aware he was likely right. Whatever mission Voldemort wanted Draco to complete weighed heavily on him. Hell, he was half-dead already.
Hope lit up his haggard features, reminding Harry how handsome Draco was when he wasn’t scared witless. It filled him with a strange sense of accomplishment, to be the one to ease his mind. Merlin only knew how long it had been since Draco had a moment's peace.
“Harry, I must ask you to leave now. I can’t reveal Draco’s location to anyone if we’re to keep him safe from Voldemort,” Dumbledore said.
Draco’s features pinched slightly and Harry was hit with an urge to kiss away the crease in his forehead. Instead, he pressed a cheek firmly into the palm resting on his face. “We’ve always been on opposite sides. I thought you were out of reach. I’m very glad that’s not the case,” Harry finished.
“I’ll be back.” Hesitating with his hand over the knob, Harry stared at the stone floor and gathered his courage. “Please stay,” he whispered, chancing a peek at his host. “I’ll feel better if you do.”
Scurrying to the commons, Draco collapsed in an empty armchair, limbs akimbo. Gulping air into his oxygen-deprived lungs, he tried to banish the vision of wiry muscles and emerald eyes brimming with gratitude. In all the years he’d imagined Harry looking at him similarly, he never expected it to be more than a fantasy. Of course, his friends descended on him in his moment of weakness, and he suppressed a groan.
“Yes, but I don’t love him like that, so that shouldn't be a concern. Nor do I believe Harry feels that way about me. But let me ask you this: what would you have done if I kissed him and he woke up? Would you hate him? Would you hate us both because I tried?”
Running a nervous hand through his hair, he muttered, “You’re quite certain this will work, Granger. What if it doesn’t?”
Blood roared in Harry’s ears at the thought of being left alone. Images of Snape’s patronus, his uncontrolled magic in Dumbledore’s office, and everyone’s shell-shocked expressions after his medical scan cycled on a continuous loop through his head. Draco was right—a lot had happened, too much to settle himself on his own. All the heightened emotions bubbling under his skin were apt to send him spiralling without someone to ground him.
The screech of the tap yanked him out of his head as Draco splashed water on his face and tried to calm his breathing. Turning the faucet off, he whispered a drying spell, finally glancing up and discovering Harry in the mirror. Whirling around with a curse, Draco raised his wand with a trembling hand and clenched his jaw.
enough for a lifetime, damn it. I won’t let anyone else take advantage of him. Not even you. I made a promise to protect him and I bloody well mean to keep it.”
“Damn it, mate. Did you have to fall for bloody Malfoy, though?” he grumbled. Pointing to his mum, he demanded, “I’m not using his first name. Ever.”
Harry’s heart raced as he waited on tenterhooks for what Draco would say. They hadn’t discussed his triggers. Hell, he hadn’t even realized he had them until yesterday, and he was curious what he’d deduced.
“The best part though,” Draco continued, puffing his chest with pride, “is you’ll have the smartest wizard in the school and a nest of overprotective vipers to help you with your tournament tasks.”
“I was almost sorted into Slytherin, actually. That’s not all that surprising,” Harry shot back with an impish grin.
Dumbledore cleared his throat, and Harry reluctantly released Draco’s hand as he reclaimed his seat. “There is another option available to us,” he said, fixing Harry with a meaningful look.
Severus paused with his glass halfway to his mouth. Oh, his godson was clever and devious and rarely wrong. The more he considered the possibility, the more obvious it became someone was acting on orders. Draco was right—Potter could not have engineered this. He was targeted.
Exhaling raggedly, he sighed. “I do. The reasons are simple. Girls don’t interest me. I’ve tried; it was a disappointment for all parties involved.” Hermione frowned disapprovingly but didn’t interrupt.
Stamping out the urge to crow with excitement, Draco’s cunning reared its head, and he smiled. “Well, we have to seal the bond between us,” he said.
Harry’s cheeks warmed from the safety of the bed in reaction to his unwavering protection. No, he didn’t regret allying with the Slytherins, specifically with the blond Prince.
Turning to face him, Harry grit his teeth. “No, Draco. I’ve been in danger since I was a baby. This is not new for me.”
Cedric held up his hand with a smile. “No need to explain. I expected no less, but knowing that you acknowledge my right is appreciated.”
Resting his elbows on his knees, Severus questioned how many of Harry’s supposed interactions were truly happenstance. With Dumbledore in the mix, he had a feeling the answer was zero.
, he grimaced to find it was half three in the morning, but he was too tired to make the sojourn to the tower. Scurrying to an out-of-the-way hearth, he wrapped himself in his cloak, mindful to keep his head exposed so he wouldn’t frighten any elves, and quickly descended into sleep.
A weighty silence fell in her absence, but Harry couldn’t handle rehashing the day; remembering in agonizing detail his panic attacks or the fear on Draco’s face in the hospital wing. Ignoring the prickling from three pairs of eyes, he rummaged through the clothes he dumped on his trunk. When his fingers brushed the cool glass buried in his pocket, he sighed in relief and uncorked the bottle with his teeth to down the blue liquid in a single gulp.
All these years his pulse quickened and his lungs clenched whenever Malfoy’s attention fell on him, he’d stupidly attributed to hatred. Now he realized it was another feeling entirely. As he stood so close to the man who drove him up the blasted wall with his quick wit and sharp tongue, he finally recognized the pull as desire. An attraction buried so deep under layers of confusion and centuries-long House rivalry that he’d never have dug it out without such a raw moment between them to yank his head out of his arse.
He sidled closer to the blond in reply as the four of them exited Snape’s chambers. Their fingers brushed every few steps, heightening the tension between them, but neither reached out. Harry’s situation as unexpected champion was too precarious to risk adding another reason for the castle's inhabitants to hate him.
Fiddling with the coverlet, Draco’s chest tightened when he caught sight of the scar on Harry’s left hand. Trailing his fingertips over the words etched in a familiar scrawl, he cursed the vile toad for maring him. Taking a steadying breath with difficulty, he slotted his fingers through Harry’s and barreled on.
Ticking off the magical items used for disguise and invisibility in his head, Draco took a chance and reached where he assumed the boy’s shoulder rested. His heart rate finally slowed when his hand touched the silky fabric of an invisibility cloak and Potter’s body underneath. Flicking his gaze to Potter’s face, he found mischievous green eyes watching him.
“Nor do I,” Fleur said as she strode toward them on long legs. Draco bowed and kissed the hand she presented before the witch linked their arms together and waved Harry to follow. “Come, cousin. Must you always make a scene wherever you go?”
Yet the betrayal of Harry’s adopted family of Gryffindors was worse. His guardians didn’t love him, nor had they ever pretended to, but the harsh rejection of his magical family sliced Harry to the core. His friends’ reactions scared him out of the security of the dorms and sent him haunting the castle corridors at all hours until he collapsed from exhaustion.
Draco coughed to break the stunned silence that followed his pronouncement and shuffled closer to the boy next to him.
Tapping his head against the brick with a curse, Draco allowed the unnerving truth of his statement to wilt his excitement, “Fair enough.” After taking a few moments to collect his composure, he asked, “So, first order of business, then?”
Popping out of her chair, she began shoving things haphazardly in her bag and Ron almost toppled out of his scrambling to stop her. “I’m sorry, Mione! Please, don’t leave. I’m sorry, okay? I’m worried about Harry and desperate for him to wake up. And yeah, I was jealous that he might...care for you, alright?”
“He’s fine, Draco,” Blaise drawled in a bored tone, though Harry didn’t miss the amusement lighting up his features. Neither did Draco, though he held his tongue and settled for rolling his eyes with a huff.
He heard Ron and Hermione in his head, warning him to be careful and not trust the git, but with the raw hope suffusing Draco’s face, Harry knew the days of hating him were passed. They had been for a while. Despite his House and his family name, Malfoy had come to Harry in his hour of need twice now and that spoke volumes in his favour.
However, there was one person mad and unconscionable enough to commit such an atrocity. But how did Harry become an “accidental” soul-holder of the Dark Lord? Could it be removed without killing the boy attached to it? Or was it impossible?
“I could ask you the same,” Hermione quipped, careful to keep her tone light, so he knew she was teasing. He chuckled, buoyant and bright, untainted by his cruel sneer, and she was struck by the difference between this Malfoy and the one she was familiar with. This boy was surprisingly likeable, and he’d mustered a great deal of courage to willingly bare his vulnerabilities. But she had to be sure this wasn’t a way to get close to Harry on someone’s orders and leave him brokenhearted in the end.
In an unconscious need for reassurance, Harry patted the dragon on his chest, noting Draco’s subtle shiver with interest. Chancing a peek at the boy standing stiff in front of him and avoiding his gaze, Harry’s stomach filled with butterflies at the rosy tint suffusing his cheeks.
Clearing his throat, he said, “I can’t say much, I’m afraid, since I don’t know what Potter wishes to share. I can only assume he is missing his own godfather. Of course, we know he doesn’t have a high opinion of me and that may be a contributing factor.” Draco nodded, wracking his brain for godfather candidates before pushing it aside for later.
Resigned that it was time to deal with the aftermath of yesterday, he sat up but paused with his fingers on the curtain when he heard whispers in the room and craned to hear.
magic awoke to heal the bruised and battered body of a child who suffered daily at the hands of those meant to love him.
From his periphery, Harry watched the blond become more animated as he discussed the pros and cons of each plant, marvelling at his intelligence and ability to pull an almost-smile from Snape as he argued his point.
Theo hissed sharply behind him, but Draco cut off whatever he might’ve said with a glare. Sliding off his bed, he caught Harry just as his limbs gave out while fumbling with the covers on his bed. Tutting in admonishment that was wholly lost on the unconscious boy, Draco yanked back the duvet with one hand before scooping him up and tucking him in.
Extending his hand with a cheeky grin, Harry said, “Hi, I’m Harry. Welcome to the side of the Light.” His chest expanded when every line in Draco’s body relaxed, like a puppet whose strings were cut free, and he knew he’d made the right choice.
‘Our friends….nothing will happen to you.’ The sincerity of the promise played on repeat in Harry’s brain, allaying his fear as he stared at the floor and prepared himself for whatever came next.
Severus handed him a glass of water, glaring daggers at McGonagall when he downed it in seconds. “Mr. Potter, are you able to explain the reason for your panic attack?” Severus asked kindly.
Draco scoffed. “How did any of us? No one’s trauma is greater or lesser than anyone else’s. We just have to acknowledge we have it and respect each other’s boundaries. None of us wish to become our parents, nor does Harry wish to become like those who murdered his. We’re not so different,” he finished quietly.
Snorting in amusement, Harry panted, “Not gonna hear any argument from me. But I’ve never been much of a bird person...well, Hedwig being the exception.”
Harry’s stomach flipped under the intensity of his gaze and the weight of his confession, but he couldn’t find it in him to change the course of where they were obviously headed. Not when he’d wanted nothing more since cool hands slapped that life-saving button in his palm and revealed the Draco behind his apathetic society mask.
“Unbelievable,” Severus grumbled. “Potter fled his dorm last night and took refuge with the house-elves and Dumbledore did nothing? I’m beginning to understand why the boy is always underfoot.”
She hadn’t wanted it to work because she didn’t want to find her long-time friend was secretly in love with her. Yet part of her hated that it hadn’t, because it meant she failed him and continued to with each day that passed.
Bill Weasley, cursebreaker and brother of the hooligans responsible, flooed in and was collaborating with Professor Snape on how to undo the magic tethered to Harry’s core. Though, by day three, it wasn’t looking too promising. And no matter what revitalizing potions or spells Madam Pomfrey tried on her comatose patient, Harry slept on without a care for the chaos outside the hospital doors.
But it was so much worse now. He made a promise — a promise he never intended to break because it would break the man to whom he’d made it. It was the promise Harry clung to in the Forest of Dean, in Gringotts and the Ministry. The promise that kept him going when he felt like giving up during the interminable months wearing that damned locket. The promise that encouraged his magic to burn Nagini’s venom from his body, even as visions of blond hair and bright smiles filled his mind in delirium.
Huffing a weak laugh, Draco cautiously straightened as the wave of nausea passed. “No. I just…” Closing his mouth with a snap, he spun on his heel and presented his back to regain his composure. “I won’t be like him,” Draco gritted out.
“No! Gods, no,” Harry exclaimed. “I didn’t mean it like that. I just wondered,” he cleared his throat, “how someone discovers they aren’t one hundred percent straight?” he asked timidly.
It was rather early to go to sleep, especially considering the nap they’d taken only a couple of hours ago, but neither Draco nor Harry had the energy to care about circadian rhythms. Sorting through his trunk for his most comfortable nightclothes, Harry plodded to the bathroom to ready himself for bed.
A heavy weight settled on Harry’s chest at the thought of his cupboard, but it lessened when he remembered the rage in silver eyes, quickly veiled behind gentle empathy to avoid upsetting him. He hadn’t paid attention to how intuitive Draco’s response had been, at the time, but reviewing the moment through a different lens unleashed a flurry of affection for the boy. It didn’t surprise him that Draco cared deeply about those who mattered to him considering his passionate nature, but it shocked him to be part of such a select group after years of being on the flip side.
Resting their foreheads together, Draco whispered, “I don’t want to lose you or this. I’ve wanted it for so long.”
The fierceness etched on Draco’s features crumbled Severus’ resolve. His godson wasn’t wrong about any of it. The tournament was dangerous and someone entered Potter’s name for reasons unknown, though they certainly weren’t benign. And yes, they needed to keep the blasted boy alive if they were to have a hope and a prayer of surviving the coming war.
The hall erupted with cheers as the Hufflepuff Seeker’s shock gave way to determination. Hopping off the bench, he took his spot next to the Headmaster with a broad grin.
Pansy burst into giggles at the image. It set the rest of them off and snapped the strange tension that had steadily increased since Snape’s confession. When they finally calmed down, she dabbed her eyes to make sure she didn’t need a cosmetic charm to fix her makeup.
The logs in the hearth snapped and crackled in the background as they gawked at him in open-mouthed astonishment.
Harry blinked owlishly at everyone’s shocked expressions and ducked his head to hide his flaming cheeks. “I guess that’s not common, is it?” he whispered to Draco, peeking nervously over his knees.
and his blood turned to ice. Appalled to find such information in his family’s collection, he shelved the book and resolved never to touch it again.
Harry held it out to him with a broad grin. “Well, you get to wear it this time. I reckon it wouldn’t be wise for people to see us walking to the Headmaster’s office together. You might have to crouch a bit to hide your feet, but it will do the job.”
Slowly the darkness receded from his vision, and Draco made out Harry’s concerned expression. “Harry,” he sighed, his muscles uncoiling as oxygen flooded his system.
Leaning into the gentle touch, Harry’s eyelids fluttered as affection washed over him. He could feel the protectiveness in Draco’s actions and he knew, despite rumours to the contrary, that the Slytherin’s heart wasn’t cold.
“A lovely idea, but take Dobby with you.” She smirked at her son’s pout, but Harry poked him in the ribs, prompting a short huff in affront.
Harry launched out of the curtains and scooped Pansy in a tight hug with a wet chuckle. She buried her face in his neck, dampening his collar with her tears as the others hesitantly shuffled closer. He waved them to join, and they wrapped the duo in a group hug with wobbly smiles and murmured reassurances. Catching Draco’s eye over Pansy’s shoulder, he mouthed his thanks and basked in the brilliance of his smile.
“Potter started as a rival, plain and simple. He rejected me and I had to see him humiliated, but he’s not easily cowed and his tongue is quite sharp. Turns out I like that about him. The verbal sparring became habitual, but I tried to lessen the sting. He’s interesting, he keeps me on my toes, he’s maddeningly unpredictable—unless it’s saving people, in which case, he is horribly predictable.” Hermione sighed wearily in concession, sharing an exasperated smile with him.
With a sigh, he closed the boy’s curtains and returned to his bed. The others watched him intently as he fluffed his pillow and adjusted the sheets to his liking, patiently waiting for whatever bone he might throw them. Sliding his wand from under his pillow, he swallowed hard and flicked sad grey eyes to his friends.
Besides, Harry couldn’t fault Snape for loving someone so much that his love lived on in their memory. Especially when said person was his mother.
Harry thanked him softly after draining the water and declined a refill. Draco studied him for a moment before taking him at his word and set the empty glass aside.
With a polite tap of Blaise’s hand to convey her gratitude, she tossed her hair and rose elegantly from her seat—once again the picture of poise and pureblood superiority. Extending a hand to Harry, he bowed low over her petite fingers, affection welling in his chest for the fierce girl he was fast viewing as a sister. Despite the teasing air of his genuflection, she hummed in approval before pushing up the sleeve of his school jumper. Her blood-red lips curled into a smug smirk at the sight of the bracelet on his wrist.
Winding his arms around his neck, Harry smiled. “If you think I’ll be able to kiss anyone else after that, you’re not as clever as I thought, Draco Malfoy. I love your damn mouth, whether you’re throwing around creative insults to catch my attention or snogging the life out of me.”
Harry’s trembling fingers hovered over the golden phoenix with fierce emerald eyes soaring over his rival’s heart and blinked back unexpected tears. He’d always wondered what shape his soulmark would take; how the Wild Magic that bestowed them viewed him. He wasn’t sure how he felt about the Ancients’ choice, but he couldn’t deny the obvious symbolism.
The distraught boy on the couch with him was not the same one who spent three years insulting him or bought his way onto the Quidditch team to taunt him in the air. This boy was heartbroken and riddled with guilt for the lost opportunities between them. It was a sentiment Harry shared.
Tracey visibly relaxed when she stood and tossed him a grin that lit up her cornflower eyes. “‘Ello, Heir Potter. If ya be needin’ anythin’ at all, please let us know.”
“Very well. You have my support—secretly, of course.” Draco exhaled in relief and Severus bit back a smile. “Approach Potter and make it known you don’t believe he put his name in the Goblet and that you intend to help him with the tasks. I’m sure I needn’t tell you to do so quietly, in case the fool tries to make a scene.”
“You realize if you do this you will, in effect, be declaring your allegiance with Potter,” he cautioned. Draco swallowed hard but nodded firmly and Severus admired his courage. He wasn’t as weak-willed as him or his father. Good.
Draco patted her arm. “For which I am eternally grateful. Regardless of your loveliness, cousin, I do not wish to be more familiar with you than I am.”
“Good,” Draco smiled. Clearing his throat, he moved away reluctantly and released his hand. “Come along, then. Time for breakfast. Uncle Sev will be waiting.”
“Tea?” he asked. Draco nearly declined, but noticing the tension coiled in the boy’s shoulders, he decided a bracing cup after his scare wouldn’t go amiss.
A voice he vaguely recognized broke through the hysteria flaring along his synapses like wildfire. He couldn't place it in his current state, but it was calm and kind, soothing his scattered nerves like a cooling balm.
“If you require an interview,” Blaise interjected smoothly, “an adult should be present. Unless you would prefer that my mother, Carmina Zabini-Anselm, and Draco’s father, Lord Lucius Malfoy, be informed of your penchant for taking underage wizards into rooms without a chaperone.”
“Who else could it ever be?” Draco joked, but they both heard the ring of truth in the thinly veiled flippancy.
Guilt slammed into him when he saw Remus and Tonks alongside his parents and Sirius, hastily stammering out an apology that he wouldn’t be around for Teddy. With gentle smiles, they reassured him their son would be fine. There were plenty who would care for him in their place. While it was true, it didn’t hurt less to know he wouldn’t see his godson grow up. To know the dreams of he and Draco spending holidays with the Lupins or teaching Teddy to fly while Remus laughed in the background would never become reality.
His giant ears flopped when he nodded. “Yes, Harry Potter is a good friend to Dobby. Dobby is a free elf, but I is liking to work. The Headmaster is taking me in and giving me a job.”
With most Hogwarts students in class or the library, they had received little beyond frosty glares and whispers from the Durmstrang and Beauxbaton guests, but the tension between the older wixen and Harry was palpable. Which had them both feeling more than a little exposed.
“He knows he’s safe. Yes, that does seem likely,” Severus interrupted. “He knows there’s a traitor in our midst, but I’m still astonished he hasn’t stepped in. It’s not as though aiding Potter in this situation looks like favouritism to our foreign dignitaries,” he huffed.
“Quiet, Granger,” Malfoy hissed in her ear, instantly halting her attempts to free herself. “I need to speak to you. Can I trust you not to scream when I remove my hand?” She nodded, and he gently released her. Twirling around, she hit the door with a silencing charm and he arched an elegant brow in amusement.
“That was Fawkes,” Harry said to his astonished friends. From the corner of his eye, he saw Snape and McGonagall’s twin glares after his revealing conversation with the man’s familiar. He relaxed slightly as they took his words at face value, likely exposing whatever half-assed explanation Dumbledore pawned off on the teachers after the debacle in the Chamber.
With a spin and a crack the couple disappeared, leaving a hall of cheering students and stunned adults in their wake. Neville and Hermione high-fived, Dean slipped Seamus a handful of Sickles, and Luna giggled as the Weasley twins squished her in an exuberant hug. Ron blinked at his friends, wondering if they’d all gone mad, and Hermione rolled her eyes.
Without his friends or Malfoy’s goons waiting in the wings for one of them to throw the first jinx, they could safely put aside their public personas, freeing Harry and Draco to bare their souls.
His feet dragged as the hours passed until he nearly collapsed from exhaustion. He realized belatedly that he was in an unfamiliar part of the castle. Pulling out the map, he discovered he was near the basement, which meant he was close to the Hufflepuff common room. He definitely couldn’t be found there.
Unable to contain their amusement, the boys burst into laughter when they entered the hall, effectively catching everyone’s attention. Goyle snickered behind them and Harry spun around with a cheeky wink, walking backward for a few paces and breaking the others’ composure with his antics. Together, the seven companions squished onto the far end of the Slytherin table and completely ignored the astounded silence around them as they chatted amiably.
Lifting a haughty finger, Draco cleared his throat dramatically. “Dobby.” The elf beamed at Draco when he appeared and Harry made a mental note to ask Dobby about his relationship with his former Master later.
“Though,” the man said with a sly slant of his mouth as a thought struck him, “I do admire the lengths you are willing to go in defence of Potter. Even if it means you tempt my ire.”
Pansy squeezed next to him in the centre of the circle and slid a plain leather bracelet onto his wrist with a cutting smile. “It’s imbued with shield and misdirection charms. Nothing people throw your way will hit you. Wear it day and night, darling.”
Waving her hand airily, Narcissa replied off-handedly. “This way they have time to secure a better match for their unfortunate daughter, don’t you agree, dearest?”
The shocking reality of Harry’s situation was more akin to a nightmare, though he doubted even his massively screwed up subconscious could craft something so utterly bleak. He peeked at Harry, taking in his listlessness, and felt despair weigh down his soul, ageing him by a decade.
Sucking in a deep breath, Harry tonelessly informed his Head of House what happened the other night. A spark of vindictive gratification jolted through him when McGonagall sank unsteadily in her chair as he alluded to the abuse with the Dursleys as vaguely as possible to give background on his triggers without divulging more than necessary. But he made it clear that the Gryffindors he roomed with, and the Weasley family, in particular, were aware of them.
Severus listened with admiration as Theodore Nott—son of a Death Eater serving a life sentence in Azkaban—explained he’d found a way for the poster child of the Light to be re-sorted into a House known for Dark wizards. The
Tipping his face up by his chin, Harry smiled warmly at the boy he was supposed to hate. A brilliant bloke with his whole life ahead of him; a life full of promise and light and love. A life he wouldn’t allow Lucius to rob him of, branded forever as one of Voldemort’s followers.
Glancing at the professor’s table, Harry realized Dumbledore and McGonagall were unusually morose, rivalling Mad-Eye Moody for ill-humour. Snape scanned the room for trouble like he did every night, though his mouth quirked slightly whenever he reached the Slytherin side of the room. Flitwick, however, was positively giddy and toasted McGonagall every time their gazes met across the table.
Without waiting for an answer, Draco steered Harry to the bed and conjured a glass, filling it with an
“Yeah, Theo. Thanks,” Harry said to the floor, missing the furious glare that passed between his friends. Tapping his shoulder to get his attention, Draco hovered a hand over it in question. Harry happily nodded his acceptance, letting the warmth from his palm chase away the lingering chill in his bones.
In the past twenty-four hours his entire world had been upended, yet despite losing the support of his House, he found he wasn’t alone. Slytherin may have adopted him only a few short hours ago, but they accepted him without conditions and willingly protected him. It was humbling to learn how wrong he’d been about them all this time.
“It’s a complex sleeping potion combined with a stasis charm. So, good news! He’s passed the fuck out,” George offered with a grin.
Settling into the purposefully empty spot next to Harry, Draco pressed their legs together while he continued his conversation with Theo. From his periphery he watched Blaise and Pansy point out the choicest cuts of meat and flavourful sides to the newest Slytherin with a smile. When Pansy moved to add another scoop of broccoli gratin to Harry’s plate, however, Draco subtly shook his head. She frowned in confusion but set it aside with a pout.
“Oh, Merlin,” he sighed as an explosion of vanilla and caramelized sugar melted in his mouth, sending the group into a chorus of delighted laughter as they dug into their crème brûlée.
“Good idea,” Severus agreed. Checking the time with another swish of his wand, he said, “It is late and you must return to the dorms to check on our guest. Where is he staying?”
Entering the kitchen, he was met with a room that mimicked the Great Hall in size and layout. House elves rushed to and fro as silverware polished itself and dishes travelled in an orchestrated dance of wash, rinse, dry, put away. Removing the cloak with wide eyes, Harry stared in fascination at the behind-the-scenes hustle and bustle of the castle.
,” Draco said, smirking when Harry shivered with the use of his given name. “Why do you need protection from Muggles?”
How could he have hated him? A child marked by the Dark Lord, abused by the only family he had left, and manipulated by Dumbledore. It disgusted Severus that he’d been willfully blind to the boy’s tells—shirking touch, jumping at loud noises, avoiding the storage closet—but he vowed to right his wrongs. Harry needed an adult with his best interests at heart to step up and since Sirius was in hiding, he’d do it in the man’s stead.
There was an uncomfortable silence as the others chewed on the implications behind the logic before Krum grumbled darkly in Bulgarian and Fleur hissed in rapid-fire French.
The silence that welcomed him was deafening, and he knew without lifting his eyes from the floor he was the topic of conversation. Crossing the room, he took the stairs to the boy’s dorms two at a time with a chorus of jeers behind him. Stepping into his dorm room, he looked up and gulped as the four boys he roomed with pinned him under a unified glare.
Neither boy was stupid enough to argue as they crammed their books and parchment in their bags, but Colin didn’t have their good sense.
Leaving his shirt undone, Draco shrugged nonchalantly to disguise his nerves and pretended he didn’t notice Harry’s eyes lingering on his torso while he fought the urge to preen.
The taunts on the tip of his tongue that Draco would normally let fly without remorse withered in the face of Harry’s terror. It no longer felt right to harass the boy—his soulmate—about something that made Gryffindor’s bravest lion quiver with fright.
Brushing his lips across Draco’s in a barely-there caress, he breathed, “I don’t care about our past or the Mark. We have time to hash it out once you defect and allow my side to protect you. Right now, my priority is your safety and you’re running out of time. Please, Draco, say yes.”
“It’s brilliant, guys! Thanks,” Harry enthused while studying his updated look in Pansy’s compact mirror. The Slytherins traded secret smiles, assuming he missed Draco’s blush, but Harry wasn’t going to admit the sight of a flustered Draco made his pulse race.
Rubbing his hands over his face in frustration, Severus levelled Draco with an intense glower. “Find Potter. We must fix this. Extend your offer of protection, else he’s liable to waste away into despondency and die before the first task.”
He ticked all the boxes: attractive, athletic, smart enough to rival her for marks, and he’d long been a focus of Harry’s attention. They’d spent years riling each other, in the air and on the ground, and insulted one another’s friends and family on countless occasions. It was the strangest, bordering on toxic, courtship she’d ever seen. But now that she was paying attention, there was little doubt their jibes hid deeper feelings. Perhaps even
The former Gryffindor gathered his once-famed courage and opened the door. He barely had a moment to catalogue the men speaking to the Headmaster as Barty Crouch and Ludo Bagman before Professor Moody barrelled down on the blond behind him.
Following the directions, Harry gave a short bow and was rewarded with an approving smirk from Daphne as she straightened. “Well met, Heir Potter. Welcome to Slytherin House. We are honoured to have you.”
He hung his head with a dejected sigh. He couldn’t say the information surprised him. After years of intermittent meals and subsisting on junk food stashed under the floorboards of his room during summer break, there wasn’t much chance of him catching up to the boys his age. Honestly, he expected worse.
Upon reaching the main level, Severus quirked a disdainful eyebrow at a mixed crowd of Durmstrang and Hogwarts students at the opposite end of the hall, reining in his private amusement as they scattered under his affected derision. Turning to his charges, the man discreetly waved his wand and glamoured the crest on Harry’s jumper to reflect the House everyone thought he still belonged to. Harry released a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding and murmured his thanks for his quick thinking.
“Not very gentlemanly of you to tell a man you love him and not allow him the courtesy to say the same.” Goosebumps erupted along Harry’s skin as hope sang in his blood, but Draco’s powerful grip prevented him from leaning back to see his face.
Tears spilled across aristocratic cheeks and Harry tenderly brushed them aside. “Please, Draco, say yes. Let me keep you safe.”
“Draco,” Harry replied, voice husky and low, sending shivers down his spine. “I’m sorry, too. I’m sorry I didn’t take your hand all those years ago, that I didn’t help you with this mess sooner. For wasting so much fucking time —”
Harry blinked at him in surprise, his stomach fluttering with the unintentional slip. Either his favourite dessert was common knowledge among Hogwarts' populace, or Draco paid as much attention to him over the years as Harry did him.
Grateful the cloak hid his pleased smile at being remembered, Draco murmured, “You’ll have to try harder to get rid of me.”
“Very well. One last thing, will either of you require a sleeping draught tonight?” he asked, pulling a set of brilliant blue potions from his robes. Draco declined, but Harry accepted gratefully.
“Practically fool-proof. There’s no way a cursebreaker could’ve cracked it before the year was out,” Fred continued, wiping sweat from his hairline.
“Hey, breathe with me. In and out, in and out,” Harry encouraged on a loop as the other man mimicked him in stilted, wheezing pants. “That’s it, baby. Keep breathing for me. In and out, you’re doing great.”
“Yes. Is...that okay? Will you accept me and any other Slytherins who do the same?” Draco asked, drumming his fingers on his knee.
Holding them as requested, the small group watched with bated breath as the witch carefully layered the spells. Draco’s eyes widened under the cloak as she activated them with a Protean Charm, then added a flagrante spell, and finally sealed an intricate communication charm into the metal without even breaking a sweat.
She moved to stand next to him and extended a hand to a willowy honey-blonde with wide blue eyes and full lips. “May I introduce Heiress Daphne Greengrass?”
“Teekey,” he called. A petite house-elf in a sunshine yellow pillowcase instantly appeared with the summons.
Glancing forlornly at the hall that led to the dorms, Draco straightened and ran a hand over his shirt to smooth out the wrinkles. “Well, I’m off. I’ll be back shortly. Let Harry calm down while I’m gone. I’ll try talking to him when I return.”
Draco quivered with rage, his muscles twitching under his skin with the effort to remain calm. There was so much to process, he didn’t even know where to begin.
“It’s alright, Dobby. Calm down. You’re my friend and I say hi to all my friends. No need to cry about it.”
“Before or after I eviscerated the foul man for disrespecting me?” she asked, while casually inspecting her nails.
“Had you been in Slytherin years ago, I would have told you the same thing. Petunia is a vile woman because she was a spiteful, jealous child, and you didn’t deserve her cruelty any more than your mother did. I want you to know, I had no idea where Dumbledore placed you that night. If I had, I’d have come for you myself, rather than leave you with her.”
Running a hand across the opulent duvet in the quiet, Harry spoke first. “Without you, none of this would be possible. I don’t have the words to properly thank you, but I hope you know how much this means to me.”
Tumbling out of the Pensieve with a scream, Harry clutched the desk and gasped through his earth-shattering sobs. His entire life was a lie. The past year on the run destroying Horcruxes and slowly starving in a cramped tent hadn’t led to the end of Voldemort alone. While he’d always been willing to lay down his life without a thought, knowing that Dumbledore groomed him for death gutted him.
With a wan smile, Severus smoothed his robes and summoned a self-inking quill and parchment. No one dared speak as the nib scratched across the page. A few minutes later, he cast a quick dry spell on the page and moved to his desk to drip sealing wax on the folded parchment. After pressing his serpent seal into the green wax, he returned his attention to them.
Hermione nibbled her lip worriedly, sharing a pleading glance with Ron that immediately set Harry’s teeth on edge. “You would tell us if —”
Without breaking eye contact, Draco ordered, “Dobby, leave. Come back in ten minutes and do not tell my mother you left us unattended.”
“Uncle Sev,” Draco called as he marched into Snape’s private chambers. Arching an imperious brow at his godson, he invited him to take a seat across from him in the chair by the fire. Sipping his brandy, Severus waved his wand at the liquor cabinet, but Draco held up a hand.
Stealing the down-filled pillow with a grin, Draco smacked him with it. “Nope. Get up. I know you’re hungry.” Harry’s lithe arms flexed when he stretched and Draco’s mouth dried.
“Thank you, Professor,” he said, spelling a cushioning charm on the vial before pocketing it as they exited the hospital wing.
“Mr. Nott, this is where we must separate for a time,” Severus said in an undertone. “If you would return to the common room and inform the others that we shall return presently. There is one last stop we must make.”
“Let it out,” Draco whispered with a comforting squeeze. “You can trust me. Let go, Harry, I’ve got you.”
Raking his hands through his hair, Draco spoke in a monotone. “It was my fault, wasn’t it? You chose another House because of me.”
His godfather’s features softened infinitesimally, and Draco smiled to himself. “You’re welcome. Good night, Draco.”
Speaking of which, what the fuck was “Harry hunting?” He mentioned nothing of the sort yesterday. And burns? Were they sustained while cooking his family’s meals? The same ones they denied him while they forced him to live off scraps like an ill-bred crup? If he ever met those damned Muggles, he’d make them regret breathing Harry’s air and give them an
Shuffling his feet nervously, Harry pulled one of the enchanted Galleons from his pocket and tucked it in Draco’s palm, chuckling softly at his wide-eyed shock.
Nodding in resignation, Dumbledore said, “Of course, Severus. We shall speak another time, but first, ten points each to Mr. Nott and Mr. Malfoy for putting aside your differences to help a classmate. And ten points to Slytherin for Mr. Potter’s determination in the face of adversity.”
“Please, Draco,” Harry whispered, relishing the man’s hushed gasp with the use of his given name. Licking his lips as he hesitantly moved closer, Harry pleaded, “It doesn’t have to be this way. Let me help you. You don’t have to do anything he’s demanded of you, Dark Mark be damned.”
“What task, Draco?” Harry asked, wiping away the salt trails before they could dry on his delicate skin.
“Sleep well, Harry,” he whispered, absently smoothing his shaggy fringe. “You’ve certainly earned it.”
He looked at each of the Champions and none of them missed the regret shadowing his gaze. Guilt weighed heavily on the three wixen for their hasty judgement of the younger boy the night of the Feast.
Harry’s head swivelled to Draco in shock as the blond pair snickered softly. “I don’t mean to, but my honour was at stake. What would you have done?”
Though, when the dragon became visible, he’d researched the symbolism behind the creature, as well as names from other cultures, hoping against hope that it didn’t represent the boy who despised him. But the accidental brush of skin during their fight in the hall awakened their bond and confirmed his worst fears.
They shared a glance before Draco gave her a curt bow. “Forgive me, Mother, but we were hoping to cool off in the garden pond.”
Draco shot a meaningful glance at his friends, who perked up at the seriousness in his tone. He mentally applauded when they read between the lines, seething with the discovery that the Gryffindors hadn’t simply shunned Harry, but had hurt him in some way. If they hadn’t already sworn to protect him on Draco’s orders, they certainly would now. Salazar help anyone stupid enough to get between them and whoever they took under their wing.
Burrowing into his neck, Draco hid his smug grin. “Nor I you. We’re a team now, Harry. I’m afraid you’re stuck with me.”
Ignoring the intrigued looks from the Weasel and the resident know-it-all, Blaise tapped his fingers on the table and asked quietly, “You alright?”
Slender fingers plucked rectangular frames off his nose and levitated them to the nightstand before carding through his messy hair. After kicking off his shoes and getting comfortable, he noticed the tremors Harry tried to hide as he fought to maintain control.
About halfway down the indicated hallway, he found a massive painting of a fruit basket and grinned at the irony of the entrance to the kitchens hiding behind a still life of food. Double-checking the hall for Mrs. Norris, he reached out and tickled the pear, marvelling when a doorknob appeared under his hand.
“Probably a good idea,” Theo said. “By the way, you’re officially our fourth roommate! I checked when I arrived,” he grinned.
McGonagall nodded slowly in resignation. Rising from her seat, she asked, “Are you ready to see the Headmaster then, Mr. Potter?”
Bright laughter and half-hearted trash talk filtered on the breeze to the Malfoy’s sipping afternoon tea on the terrace bordering their quidditch pitch. Smirking faintly around the lip of her cup, Narcissa watched with amusement as the boys taunted one another as they raced across the sky. Lucius sighed heavily at their antics, earning a sharp glance from his wife.
The girl cocked her head and dipped into an effortless curtsy. Harry blinked, uncertain what he should do, but Blaise leaned close and whispered, “Bow, but not too low.”
“Of course, dear,” she replied, enlarging the space further to accommodate four people as Severus entered. Noticing Harry’s lip-biting habit with a frown, Pomfrey added a robust silencing spell to ensure the boy’s privacy.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Severus intoned gravely behind him. Draco smothered a groan as the man’s presence brought his rushed decision to track down the lost boy to a halt.
“The Lady has accepted his oath,” Cedric piped up from the corner. “I have no problem with Malfoy attending the proceedings.”
Draco only noticed how close they were when he could make out the gold flecks scattered in Harry’s irises and the faint freckles along the bridge of his nose. Harry studied his former rival, who suddenly knew more about him than his best friends, and drank in the long lashes framing quicksilver and soft, plush lips. He was acutely aware of how attractive he was beneath his sneer and his stomach fluttered.
“‘Course, mate,” Ron replied, a little too cheerily, but he counted the relieved smile on Harry’s face as a win.
Whipping his head around to his godfather, Draco blurted, “Dumbledore is using the house-elves to spy on Harry, which means he
my people: Crabbe, Goyle, Parkinson, Zabini, Nott. I’m offering my protection because Merlin knows you're gonna need it. Whatever I say, goes. They’ll guard your back.”
Pressing their shoulders together in commiseration, Harry nodded. “I get that. So you’re making your choice then? You’re choosing to side with me?”
Extending her hand, she said, “It has been an honour and a privilege to be your Head of House. I am sad to see you go, but I believe the Hat was correct. You will make a fine addition to Slytherin House and I wish you all the best there. Please know you can still come to me with anything, day or night. Unfortunately, I have business to attend to in Gryffindor Tower, so I relinquish you into Professor Snape’s capable hands.”
Blaise chuckled as he placed a setting spell on Harry’s tamed waves. “Yes. We have a reputation of excellence to maintain in the House. We tutor one another in our studies and keep our appearance immaculate.”
“Yes,” he said, grateful for the redirect. “Dumbledore has the house-elves, and likely the castle portraits, spying on Harry. Sev and I confirmed it with his personal elf, which means the old man knows someone set Harry up to take part in the tournament and where he’s been staying. The interesting thing is that he hasn’t swooped in to save him, so we can assume Dumbledore believes he’s safer here than Gryffindor Tower. Quite telling, isn’t it?”
Draco squared his shoulders and tipped his head. “You have my word as Prince of Slytherin. I have no need to lie to the true Hogwarts champion.”
“Harry,” Draco protested weakly. He didn’t deserve the effort the stubborn Gryffindor was going through for his sorry hide.
Taking the press of Harry’s leg against his to mean “yes,” he pushed his plate aside and stood. Their friends were quick to follow suit, falling in around Harry as though they’d been doing it forever. Pansy wriggled in the centre and linked their arms, chatting about nonsense as they braved the hallways. When they neared the entrance to the common room, Theo cast a few
A shrill cry yanked Harry out of his mindless rage. Breaking eye contact with the Headmaster, he grinned when Fawkes swooped down from Dumbledore’s private quarters upstairs, depositing the Sorting Hat with a soft
Ducking his head to hide his answering flush, he cut the blond some slack and dropped the subject. The unlikely companions drank their tea in comfortable silence and thanked the unknown elf who removed their tray when they finished.
Harry tipped his head against the bank with a sigh. “It’s just frustrating. I’m famous in wizard society, but I don’t know a damn thing about it. I don’t understand the traditions or the history. I just feel like I’m at a constant disadvantage, while the world at large has expectations of me.”
There was a moment of silence as everyone digested the information. Harry’s stomach knotted uncomfortably to learn his mentor was spying on him. Though Dumbledore hadn’t seemed concerned when he protested returning to the Dursleys after his first year, so maybe it shouldn’t surprise him that the mistreatment by his housemates did not bother the man, Harry decided bitterly.
It seemed almost criminal to wake him when he looked so at peace. When was the last time he’d had any? Draco’s stomach knotted guiltily and his cheeks flushed with shame, fully aware he added to Harry’s real-life burdens with their petty squabbles. They seemed so foolish now—the worst type of attention-seeking. Honestly, what had he been thinking, acting like a bloody first year?
Pansy gasped audibly while the boys let fly a truly incredible array of curses under their breaths. From the corner of his eye, Harry saw the incensed glare Draco shot his godfather and didn’t protest when cool fingers tangled with his in support.
A disbelieving puff of air escaped him as the Headmaster ventured deeper into his rooms. Draco was certain the wily old man would’ve forced him to return to the Dark Lord, trapped into spying for the Light, if not for Harry decrying the plan. How people saw the wizard as a paragon of virtue, Draco would never understand. Yet, he couldn’t deny he was his ticket to freedom, so he’d take what he could get and be grateful.
him—faults and all—and still cradled him as though he were something precious. Brilliant Draco with his barbed tongue and fierce loyalty, gorgeous Draco who rivalled him for power, staring at plain, broken Harry like he was worth his time.
“I could say the same for you,” Harry admitted with a grin. “It’s a miracle I ever caught the Snitch when you were in the air with me.” Leaning back slightly he drank in the sight of Draco flushed and panting and aching against his thigh. “God, you’re gorgeous, especially like this. Because of me,
“No, absolutely not!” Harry roared. “Voldemort coerced Draco into taking the Mark while underage and will not play a part in this war! My life is the only one that should be on the line.”
“Says the man who takes twice as long on his bloody hair,” she tossed over her shoulder. Blaise and Theo followed the others with a wink to Draco, not so subtly giving the boys a moment alone.
Fred and George thundered into Gryffindor Tower, holding their sides and gasping for breath. Shirts untucked and faces gleaming in the firelight, they leaned against the wall and tried to calm their racing hearts. The entire common room froze at the disheveled state of the Weasley twins until Ginny’s voice pierced the silence.
“There’s no harm in admitting how you feel,” Blaise said. “You’re among friends, Draco. None of us are going to rat you out to your father.”
The man in the portrait opened his mouth with a sneer, but she snapped her fingers and his hands flew to his neck as his tongue tied in a knot. “You will be silent until my Master wishes you free and you will be deaf since you cannot be trusted.” Teekey snapped again and his eyes widened in surprise when a thick layer of oil paint covered his ears.
“Yesss,” the Hat hissed, a touch smug. “As I said years ago, you will find greatness in Slytherin, but not all greatness is about power. Yet, greatness is only achievable if you are willing to discover all you can about yourself. What you need are those who understand you—like attracts like, Harry. Slytherin will help you find your place. They will help you grow and you will help them, in turn. So I ask, are you ready to leave the lion’s den and make a home among your true friends?”
“Fine,” Fred grumbled in defeat. “We used the poison apple idea from Snow White. The difference is our combined potion-spelled apple attaches to a person’s magical core. The only way to wake our boy up is to have his true love kiss him.”
Furrowing his brow, he rubbed his hands soothingly along his spine. “You won’t. I’m not going anywhere,” he promised.
Clearing his throat awkwardly, Fred opened his mouth, but George answered across the room. “Well, you see, darling sister, there is also a love potion component. Which was why it was perfect for Umbridge! No one could ever love the toad and she’s brimming with hate, so there wouldn’t be a way to...wake her.”
Without another word, their professor led them out of the open to the hospital wing. As they neared the infirmary, Harry resisted the urge to clutch Draco’s hand to ease the knot growing in his gut. Inside the hushed ward, Severus directed them to a bed and drew the curtains.
Hiding his pleased smile, Harry replayed their previous interactions over the years and realized most could be seen as a strange form of flirtation. He was even more startled to discover it wasn’t simply on Draco’s end, either.
Peeking at her colleague through her fingers, Pomfrey smirked. “I do wish that loathsome woman had taken the bait. I’d have shipped her to St. Mungo’s, and we’d all have been free of her.”
“Join me. Join my side and I guarantee you’ll be protected. From your father, from Voldemort, from anyone who comes for you.” Pressing a soft kiss to his lips, he said, “I won’t let anything happen to you, I swear it.”
He shrugged. “Dobby mentioned when we first met that he’d heard great things about me, but for the longest time, I couldn’t imagine anyone in the Malfoy family having anything nice to say about me. Seems I was wrong.”
Severus hummed thoughtfully. “That may be, but it’s a key component. Fairies’ ethereal beauty is part of their magic and when boiled out of the wings, it imbues the potion with the signature effect the customers seek.” Toasting his godson with a good-natured smirk, he said, “Though I’m confident you’ll come up with something.”
Fleur smiled genially at Draco. “Not by blood. The Malfoy line was originally French and somewhere in the 1600s, the Delacour's called upon the Malfoi’s still in France for aid against a rogue sorcerer who nearly revealed the existence of our world to the Holy Roman Empire. They swore a family pact and promised to never raise wand or blade against one another in return for their help. Naturally, the wizard was defeated and our secret was saved. When the Malfoi’s died out, my father’s family maintained our vow with the English line. We have been ‘cousins’ ever since, though we do not follow the tradition of marrying one another.”
Rising from his chair, Severus drawled, “See that you do and do it quickly. If you want him to cooperate, you must act swiftly.”
“Draco,” he huffed, “you should know by now that I gladly give my all to those I care about, and despite our history, I’ve always had a soft spot for you. If it’s within my power to grant, it’s yours. And guaranteeing you and your family protection is one of those things.”
“That’s rather forward, isn’t it, Granger?” he smirked. A smart comment almost flew off her tongue, but she bit it back when she read the humor in his eyes.
White-hot rage exploded out of Draco before he could contain it. Harry watched his untamed magic whip around the room in fascination, his heart tripping with delight and something else he hesitated to name. Reining in his fury with deep, measured breaths, Draco squeezed Harry’s biceps in reassurance.
Shaking his head in fond exasperation, Draco said, “It’s mentioned in Hogwarts: A History, but most people believe it’s a rumour.”
But the Horcrux was the most horrifying thing on the list. That was incredibly dark magic, darker than even his father’s associates were willing to tread. Draco shouldn’t even know about the existence of such a vile rite, but he’d stumbled upon it in a tome in the Malfoy library so ancient and weathered the script was barely legible. Never one to turn down a challenge, he used a charm to temporarily enhance the ink as he read until he reached the section on the “
“I-I can’t believe he would. And if that’s the case, you’re just as likely a candidate,” Hermione argued weakly.
Narrowing her eyes at him, she said, “Ron, you can’t be serious. Are you jealous? Is that what this is?” Ron’s face turned scarlet as Hermione threw down her quill. “Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous! Our best friend is in a bloody coma and you’re having a snit over the possibility of him secretly loving me beyond the bounds of our friendship? Unbelievable.”
“As to why I needed to speak to you, well...they don’t call you the brightest witch of our age for nothing.” Pulling a piece of parchment from his pocket with trembling fingers, he unfolded it and her eyes widened when she recognized her list from the library.
Harry woke with a yawn, blearily rubbing the grit from his eyes as his brain caught up with his body. After an hour of counting the stones in the ceiling while impatiently waiting for sleep last night, he finally caved and tasked Dobby with fetching him a sleeping draught. He wasn’t sure if the elf nicked it from the infirmary or Snape’s stores, but decided it was best to not ask. It wasn’t dreamless, for which he was thankful because he didn’t want to risk addiction, but it meant the ten hours sometimes featured unhappy images. Though it was better than no sleep at all, he supposed.
Anxiety thrummed in Harry’s veins as Draco’s grey eyes remained unfocused, the pupils mere pinpricks as he fought imaginary demons. All too familiar with panic attacks, Harry took one of his limp hands and pressed it over his heart.
“Bathroom’s down the hall, if you need it,” Draco informed him. “I can either stay here and do homework or guard the room against unwanted visitors in the commons. Your choice. I want you to feel comfortable enough that you can get some decent sleep.”
A chorus of agreement echoed around the room, and Snape nodded in approval. Clasping his hands behind his back, his normally stony gaze glittered with intensity as he continued.
But as he chatted with Kingsley about the Auror’s next steps, Harry couldn’t get his mind off the person he most wanted to see. Once the captured Death Eaters were shipped to Azkaban, he planned to eat a proper meal, sleep for a solid twenty-four hours, and then fetch him.
An incredulous puff of air escaped Harry as the wall slid open. Such a simple word, really; one he’d never fully appreciated because he hadn’t understood the depth of it until a few days ago. He blinked away the tears filling his eyes as Pansy squeezed his arm and the lads clapped him lightly on the back. Their kindness further buoyed the new sense of belonging as they passed through the common room toward the dorms.
“Owing to Mr. Potter’s unique circumstances, I have changed the password.” With a flick of his wand, a crisp piece of parchment with the new password stuck itself to the message board. “I will personally change it weekly, as opposed to bi-weekly, for the time being. I also strongly advise
“Thank you,” Harry murmured, drinking deeply. Dumbledore nodded and gestured to the pitcher in question to Draco, who mutely declined.
Severus scowled at the information. “He slept in the kitchens overnight?” Her pupils receded, revealing the pale blue irises of the elves, and nodded. Pursing his lips, he asked, “Is the Headmaster aware that Mr. Potter slept outside of his dorm and in what location?”
Dumbledore’s speech at breakfast resulted in fewer obvious hexes thrown his way during the day, but the venomous whispers of “traitor,” “cheat,” and “snake” were impossible to pinpoint in the crush of students. A few tripping jinxes from his friends at the more blatant gossips, however, made their attackers wary and granted them a bit of a reprieve by mid-afternoon.
Silver eyes flashed when Draco abruptly leaned forward with a sneer. “Did you know Gryffindor House doesn’t offer Sanctuary? I asked because it shocked him to learn Slytherin would take in outsiders. He’d never heard of it.”
Scoffing slightly, Draco said, “Of course I was. What’s the point of saving your arse only to find you keeled over in the castle kitchens a few months later? I mean, honestly Potter, where’s the ingenuity?”
Harry squeezed his hand. “I won’t. I may be reckless, but I’m not completely stupid. I’ve no intention of attracting any more attention than I have already.”
He wanted to argue he hadn’t put his name in the Goblet. How could he? Not even Fred and George bypassed Dumbledore’s spellwork, and they were devilishly brilliant. But the words stuck in his throat, leaving him mute and trembling under hundreds of judgemental eyes, wishing the ground would open up and swallow him.
The assembled Order members fixed him with varying expressions of vexation as Molly patted him on the back. “Of course, dear.” When Ron wandered off, muttering to himself, Molly grinned at Minerva. “Well, Christmas will certainly be interesting.”
An unwitting smile danced across Draco’s face as warmth pooled in his chest. This was Harry without any cares; without the impossible expectations of his fame or the stress of a dangerous tournament a homicidal maniac signed him up for. He looked younger, almost fragile, under the sumptuous linens bringing to mind the waif from the robe shop. Draco imagined the same lost boy shivering in a dark cupboard and the heat within him blazed into an inferno. He would do anything for Harry and it went beyond his alliance with the Light.
“Dunno, but it wouldn’t be me.” Tilting his chair on its back legs, he crossed his arms as he thought about potential blokes while Hermione began working on a shortlist.
Draco frowned as the bond between them flooded with a rush of anxiety and a hefty dose of fear. Since the acknowledgement of their connection was new, the influx of each other's emotions was more keenly felt, and Draco didn’t like the boulder taking up residence in his intestines that mirrored the weight in Harry’s.
Shuffling back a step, Draco allowed Harry to slide into the room and closed the door with a decisive click, instantly hitting it with a few choice privacy spells. Grabbing his bag, he settled comfortably on his bed with his homework as Harry crawled in the free one next to him.
Hell, even Harry’s magic knew his life was in danger! His first bout of accidental magic hadn’t been something expected, like Pansy’s levitating teapot, or entertaining like Blaise, who turned the water in his villa’s fountain into cherry-scented bubbles that stained the white marble pink. No,
“No, poor dear,” Pomfrey muttered. “She burst through the doors like the hall was on fire, sobbing and babbling about being in love with him, begging ‘please, let me kiss him so he’ll open his eyes.’ I rather think she feared her brothers had actually killed him.”
“And intelligent,” she pointed out, causing Ron to shoot her another glance. “Stop it! Harry is not in love with me, for pity’s sake.”
His dark eyes were intent and firm, but for the first time in his life, Harry didn’t bristle under Snape’s gaze when he saw the warmth he normally kept hidden. Draco smothered a laugh as Harry glimpsed his godfather, Severus, not the surly dungeon bat he pretended to be. Squeezing his hand to snap the boy out of his stupefaction, Harry returned the action with a lopsided smile that liquified Draco’s insides.
giving it to our honorary snakes from other houses until the furor regarding the re-sort dies down. This is a safe space for us, and for them, I know—however,
A hot spike of protective anger roared through his veins as he shuffled nearer the bed, raking his eyes over him, cataloging his thin wrists and short stature. Harry’s presence loomed large, which made him seem bigger than he was in actuality, but without his brash demeanor acting as a buffer, he could finally see the fragile boy beneath it.
“Harry,” Severus said, calmly turning to the speechless boy. “Is there anyone you would prefer to replace me as your guardian?”
“For me, I think it was the Forbidden Forest in first year. I saw your humanity beneath your mask that night. Though,” Harry ducked his head in embarrassment, “I’m slower on the uptake and didn’t figure out why I couldn’t stop staring at you until it was almost too late. Forgive me?”
“We were both very wrong about Mr. Potter,” Severus rumbled darkly as a fresh wave of guilt slammed into him. “But don’t worry about how to mend things, Draco. From what I saw at dinner tonight, I’d say you and your friends are well on your way to righting your wrongs with Potter.”
Sufficiently cowed by Draco’s protective stance, their housemates backed off. Harry blew out a relieved breath when they returned to their games and homework with sheepish smiles. As grateful as he was for their acceptance, the day’s events had drained him and he didn’t feel like socializing.
“No,” Draco snarled. “I do not uphold the fascist ideologies of my father, as you well know. How could I when you’re my godfather? Do you really believe I see you as inferior? Or Granger?” The man startled, but Draco rolled his eyes and waved a hand dismissively as he leaned back in his chair.
Soft grey eyes met his when slender fingers wrapped around his hand in a strong grip. Harry’s cheeks instantly pinked and his heart flew into his throat with the alarming revelation that he enjoyed Draco’s larger palm swallowing his hand.
As the light washed over the page, it revealed Snapes’s spidery handwriting in lilac ink and Harry huffed a laugh at Slytherin ingenuity.
He nodded faintly through his oxygen-deprived haze and was rewarded with a gentle squeeze of his fingers.
Harry dipped his toast in egg yolk and took a bite, pointedly ignoring the gawking Hogwarts students and curious glances from the foreign guests.
To be honest, Harry liked the idea of being the only person to see the private side of Draco. It made their bond more special to know they bared their souls for no one but each other.
Clearing his throat, he said, “Of course, Draco’s alliance with Harry Potter has given us considerable credibility in political circles.”
Shuddering violently, Draco said, “No, thank you. I love you dearly, but only as a friend, I’m afraid. Nor do I wish for my father to make any decisions regarding my life ever again.”
Snorting in amusement, McGonagall said, “It was fool-proof and I would be lying if I said she didn’t deserve it.” Flicking her eyes to the ward, she sighed. “It’s terrible to see Mr. Potter in her place, however. Poor lad.”
Stepping out of his hiding place in the far bookshelves with wide eyes, Draco hurried to the table and snatched the list of names Granger had been working on. His heart skipped several beats when he read his name at the top. Shoving the list in his robes, he quickly gathered his things from a nearby table and hurried out.
Rolling her eyes fondly at her friends, Pansy rounded everyone all up and led them out of the safety of the dungeon. Linking her arm through Harry’s, she discreetly checked his wrist for the bracelet as she rambled about their latest ridiculous divination assignment while the others fell into various conversations around them.
“Mr. Nott and Mr. Malfoy, you shall accompany Mr. Potter and I to Professor McGonagall. Theo, have the passage from the book at the ready. Draco, I will need you to tell her where you found Harry yesterday. Harry, you’ll likely have to tell McGonagall what made you leave the tower. Will you be able to do that?”
A wet thumb stroked his cheek and Draco’s stomach flipped in response to his tenderness. “Can I kiss you?” Harry asked, trepidation flickering across his face.
“He has potential, I will admit,” Phineas Black’s unsilenced portrait said. For whatever reason, the half-arsed endorsement of the man he cared about from one of his distant relatives broke Draco’s composure.
Wearily pinching the bridge of his nose, he continued, “Yet, Potter has proven time and again that he is not his father. He is undoubtedly arrogant, but no more than you or I. And now, knowing what I do of his life before Hogwarts, I can’t find it in me to dislike the boy any longer.”
“Because I had to keep up appearances,” Draco explained with a grimace. “Everything gets back to Father, in the end. But I can’t do it, Potter, I can’t. Not after what I’ve seen. I won’t be them. I won’t be like...him.” They shivered, imagining the horrible things Draco would be forced to do if he followed in Lucius’ footsteps.
Ignorant of the boys’ power struggle, Severus heaved a sigh at the floor. “I’ve made many mistakes in my life, but the way I’ve treated you is one of my biggest.”
“Now that the Champions have been chosen —” His statement cut off abruptly as the Goblet flared a fourth time.
Bobbing into a quick curtsy, she said, “Because they respect Master too much for his care of Slytherin House to undo his orders, sir. They know your actions are to protect, not harm.”
When the couple emerged from the gardens, giggling and blushing with fingers entwined, Narcissa watched them cross the lawn from the second storey with a warm smile. Yes, the boys would be happy in this new age, without blood prejudice or antiquated ideals tarnishing their connection.
They stripped down to their pants and dove off the bank into the crystal clear water. When they broke the surface, Dobby was laying out an assortment of sandwiches and pastries and chilled Perrier. Swimming to the bank, Harry selected an orange-flavoured water while Draco chose lemon to go with the club sandwich they split.
A blinding flash of light flooded the room, washing his rain-scented magic across all present, leaving the cool tingling of his indignation prickling their skin.
Closing his eyes to stem the fresh wave of tears welling in them, he covered his face with his hands when they spilled their banks. A sick sense of dread weighed down his heart, knowing that on top of all that Harry suffered at the hands of his relatives, he was unaware he housed a piece of the Dark Lord’s soul.
Crumpling the parchment nearest her, she threw it at his head, but it arched over him and sailed into a far aisle. “No, Ronald,” she hissed. “I haven’t found anything. At this point, I’m not sure we’re going to.”
Chuckling to himself, Harry glanced around the room, noting the usual House rivalries seemed to have waned. From the moment of their arrival, Durmstrang made themselves at home with the Slytherins, while the Beauxbaton delegation favoured the Ravenclaws, but the random pops of scarlet or yellow scattered amongst the other Hogwarts tables didn’t go unnoticed. Whether it was to keep up appearances for their guests or because whoever the Goblet chose as Hogwarts Champion would represent the entire school, Harry didn’t care.
Lowering his gaze to escape Draco’s soft expression with a hushed word of thanks, Harry broke through the crust and brought a bite of the custard underneath to his lips.
“Nutrition potions,” Draco said blandly before spelling his curtains shut and encasing the velvet in a resounding silencing charm.
is to wander the hallways alone once this becomes public. Until our new housemate is familiar with our ways, I fully expect you all to provide information or guidance, as not all the Houses follow the old traditions.”
Waving goodbye, Harry waited until they were far enough from the other Gryffindors to whisper, “Still with me?”
Reaching for the hand nearest him, Harry laced their fingers together. “I was starting to think you’d never come.”
As they left the room, they discussed the ingenuity of the Weasley’s curse, picking apart the intricate spellwork and complicated potioneering with enthusiasm. Hermione admired Malfoy’s intelligence. It was incredibly refreshing to break down the components and gush over the layering technique without having to stop and explain the finer points along the way.
The click of his throat as Draco swallowed echoed in the silence before he hissed through clenched teeth. “Like your uncle. I won’t...I won’t force myself on you. I have no expectations of this becoming romantic. I’m sorry I got carried away. I was out of line.”
me to? A lot happened today. It’s okay if you don’t want to be alone right now. It’s also okay if you want to be rid of me for a bit. You won’t hurt my feelings if you tell me to bugger off,” he smirked, trying for levity.
Harry choked on air, rendered mute by the man who couldn’t tear his eyes off the wisps of her form as it faded into the aether. The display confused the others, but they were acutely aware something monumental had just transpired.
Harry’s jaw fell slack and his eyes glittered with tears when he realized he wouldn’t be left to flounder and die in a tournament designed to kill him. A few feet from the common room entrance, he spun to face his onetime rival and threw his arms around him, forcing a startled “oof” past Draco’s lips as he squeezed with all his strength.
Clasping his hands behind his back, Severus straightened to his imposing height and nodded to the elf as he regained his composure. “Thank you, Teekey. You may go.”
. They could feel the similarities and the differences of their auras melding into something more powerful with every shared breath.
,” he whispered. “I don’t know if you can hear me, but I hope you can. I’m not sure I’ll be able to repeat what I’m about to say. I’m...not entirely sure this will work, but Granger seems adamant it will. I-I want you to know I’m here because I want to be. I care deeply for you, though my approach over the last few years has probably led you to believe otherwise.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll be fine.” Draco cocked a disbelieving brow and Harry blushed. “Okay, maybe I’m still a little shaken by our run-in with Skeeter. Honestly, I’m looking forward to heading to the common room after this meeting and doing
Harry appreciated the bloke who never grovelled at his feet, and whose sarcasm and confidence were both attractive and sorely missed. Here, locked in a staring contest he didn’t dare break, he could finally be honest with himself about his feelings for the Slytherin Prince.
The Gryffindor patch on his school jumper instantly changed to a silver snake on a green background and he sagged in relief. Severus removed the hat with a smirk, his dark eyes shining with approval when Harry mouthed his thanks. Theo stuck out his hand with a grin but huffed out a chuckle when Harry tugged him close and clapped him on the back.
Spinning to face Harry with a manufactured sneer, Snape growled. “Get your things and go. I want twelve inches on how peppermint counteracts the deadly effects of belladonna to make up for missing class, Potter.” He turned away after Harry mumbled an affirmative and snapped his fingers imperiously.
Harry noticed immediately that she did not have a title, but she mimicked the others, sending her bobbed ebony hair fluttering as she sank into a slightly wobbly curtsy, tension apparent in every line of her petite frame.
,” Harry snarled at the older wizard, “but that is precisely why I’m rejecting your proposal. Draco has been
“It’s okay. I’m not angry,” Harry murmured, squeezing his hand in reassurance. Draco tried to free himself, too ashamed to accept his comfort, but Harry tightened his grip and tugged their joined hands in his lap.
He should find Hermione and Ron and say goodbye, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to walk away if he did. No, it was better this way. They would miss him, but Harry would be another casualty of war this way, instead of a sacrificial lamb.
The Halloween Feast was always a boisterous occasion at Hogwarts, but this year surpassed Harry’s expectations. Giant pumpkins from Hagrid’s garden dominated the space along the Head table honouring the visiting schools: depictions of Durmstrang’s ship, sails billowing on an invisible breeze, and Beauxbaton’s winged horses flicking their manes as they pulled the massive carriage across the sky. Smaller pumpkins hovered along the room featuring scenes of skeletal thestrals, flying bats, and cloaked figures making traditional Samhain offerings around a roaring bonfire.
Harry clasped hands with the famous Bulgarian in a daze, green eyes wide with wonder when he glanced at Draco who looked fit to burst at the brusque wizard’s offer.
Patting her shoulder gently, she said, “Even if he doesn’t wake, I very much appreciate your willingness to help. It is more than we could hope for.”
Draco smiled wryly as sad eyes bored into him. “But there is one thing I’m not sorry for and that is, oddly enough, that your rejection of me led you to Granger and Weasley. I know I owe them apologies, as well, but they’ll have to wait. For now, it’s enough to know that though I won’t be around, they will guard your back.”
When they reached the gargoyle guarding the Headmaster’s office, Harry gave the password and hesitated when the wall opened so Draco could slide around him. As the wall closed, leaving them on the curved stairwell glowing with soft torchlight, Draco removed the cloak and passed it silently to the man behind him. Instead of taking the offering, Harry wrapped his hand around Draco’s with a pensive expression. Squeezing Harry’s fingers briefly as he pressed the silky fabric into his palm, Draco hastened up the stairs, blood pounding in his ears.
Draco scanned the hall for Potter throughout breakfast, expecting to find him hiding at another table. When he failed to locate his perpetually messy head anywhere, he monitored the door in case the fourth Champion slipped in under a notice-me-not charm, but he never showed. Shooting his Head of House an inscrutable look, he left the hall, his appetite vanishing with the Gryffindor.
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?” he spat, catching the attention of everyone in the room. Both boys took an involuntary step back at the vitriol in his tone.
Spinning on her heel, she raced back and launched into his arms with a laugh. “Oh my god, Harry James Potter! Why am I friends with you, you insufferable prat?”
Straightening his spine with Gryffindor steel, Harry dropped the cloak and ignored the heat searing his thigh as he walked to greet Death.
Misinterpreting his sadness, Teekey patted his hand kindly. “Do not worry, young sir. The vials are travel-sized to fit in your bag and spelled not to break. If you put the empty vials in the box each night, Teekey will collect them and disinfect them for reuse. Master will send a fresh batch each week until Madam Pomfrey says you’re not needing them.”
“Harry,” Draco murmured as he arched into Harry’s hand, chasing a firmer touch. “There’s nothing to forgive. You couldn’t have prevented this any more than I could have, but you’re here now and giving me more than I dared hope for.”
Spinning to his godfather with a snarl, he said, “He has literally no support. No one is going to ensure his safety in class or the hallways, much less during the tournament. A tournament that carries a high risk of maiming and death and none of those self-righteous arseholes gave a single damn. He’s the youngest in our year! The other champions are of age, yet he’s been thrust into a competition he can’t escape and could very likely die in.
A sea of nods rippled through the room and Harry wondered, not for the first time, what he was missing.
to? How many nights had he lain awake in the tower, staring at the hand that rejected the first wizard he met any time things soured between his housemates and wondered “What if?” before burying those traitorous thoughts in the darkest part of his heart?
With no after dinner speech from Dumbledore to keep them, they hurried through the hall after dessert to avoid a confrontation. No one in the group spoke as Draco steered them toward the dungeons rather than Gryffindor tower, their eyes piercing the shadows and scanning the alcoves for signs of trouble. Reaching the common room miraculously unscathed, they draped themselves dramatically across the leather furniture and Harry resisted the urge to snort at their theatrics.
“There,” Draco whispered huskily, smoothing the green and silver striped tie knotted in a perfect half-Windsor. “It was crooked. Can’t have that on your first day as a Slytherin.” His fingertips lingered on his chest, searing like a brand through his button-down.
Toeing off his trainers, he stood up and nudged them under the bed, sadly releasing Draco’s steadying hand for the first scan. A scroll appeared and automatically filled in the blank page with his information.
The room was square and spacious, if a bit chilly being subterranean. A bookshelf crammed with tomes and crumpled parchment lined the back wall, but the rest of the chamber was immaculate. There were only four poster beds, as opposed to five in the Gryffindor dorms, but Slytherin was the smallest house, so that wasn’t surprising. The beds were also larger owing to the additional space, Harry noted with a twinge of jealousy. Yet, while there was an even number of beds, there were only three silver nameplates: Zabini, Nott, and Malfoy.
Keeping his voice neutral, Draco stated simply. “With a kiss, of course. Our magic will see it as our acceptance of the bond and seal it, granting you protection from my family for life. Plus, it has the added benefit of helping you discover if you aren’t ‘one hundred percent straight,’ as you put it.”
“All this time, I thought Harry had everything,” Draco croaked. “That he basked in fame and sought it out, but none of it was true. He slept in a bloody cupboard for eleven years! I was so wrong and I don’t know how to amend my mistakes,” he finished despairingly.
Wow, okay. Draco was incredibly observant and scarily accurate with his assessment. Though Harry couldn’t help worrying how much of what he mentioned was from personal experience with Lucius or dealing with the other Slytherins’ unhappy backgrounds.
Pulling a couple of Galleons from his pockets, he double-checked the hallway and lowered his voice. “I need you to link these two together for private communication. Dumbledore mentioned needing a better way to stay in contact.”
Yes, she quite liked this Malfoy, and she wanted to help him. Whether or not he woke Harry, she would extend him an offer to join the Order to escape his father. Though she was certain he was the key to Harry’s problem, she fully expected them to be idiots about the whole situation.
The blond wasn’t what he expected—none of the Slytherins were—and no matter how difficult things were bound to be in the future, Harry wouldn’t change his new House placement. His cheeks flooded with heat when he flicked his eyes to the boy who remained staunchly by his side despite the madness that dogged his steps, inordinately grateful the surrounding ruckus hid the true cause of his embarrassment.
His voice tapered off and his godfather’s brows rose sharply, sending Draco’s blush past his collar. Clearing his throat awkwardly, Draco hastened to explain. “There is an empty bed in the room I share with Theo and Blaise. Harry is using it.”
“That’s why I had you all meet in here,” Draco admitted. “I’m sure the Slytherin portraits would stay loyal, but I wanted to eliminate the risk.”
Swallowing hard, Draco settled on the bed and took his limp hand in his own. Tears pricked his eyes when there was no response to his touch, no sign that Harry knew or cared he was there.
Sharing a panicked glance with his godfather, Draco knew a similar litany of curses were pinging in his head, too.
Draco frowned and threaded their fingers together when Harry’s clammy hand sought his in desperation. “It’s a physical health exam. It’s standard procedure for all incoming first years and new students. Haven’t you had one before?”
Silence reigned as another piece of smouldering parchment floated from the goblet and Dumbledore’s fingers deftly caught it. Dread coiled in Harry’s gut as the Headmaster squinted through his spectacles before reading the name.
Leaning back in her chair, Pomfrey shook her head sadly. “I nearly refused, because I hadn’t heard about the apple yet, but Ms. Granger said she was simply distraught and asked for a moment of privacy. I couldn’t deny the poor thing. Not two minutes later, she fled the ward in hysterics with Ms. Granger on her heels.”
“No, it’s that you still harbour prejudices long antiquated.” Lucius pursed his lips under his wife’s steely glare, unable to refute the truth. “We fought a war based on such ideas and
It took a few minutes, but eventually Harry’s breathing slowed and the fog blanketing his mind lifted. His senses gradually returned, and he used them to ground himself as they came. First, he focused on Draco’s patient counting, then the thumb rubbing circles along his knuckles, the spicy notes of expensive cologne and sharp antiseptic, the sour tang of fear in his mouth, and finally, when he opened his eyes, the warmth in heavenly grey.
“Even though someone entered your name in a killer tournament to make it a reality?” Draco joked to distract from the rosy hue spreading under his collar.
“Narcissa, even if such a match were advantageous to us, we couldn’t push for it. There are no magical guardians in Harry’s life who would sign papers for an alliance.”
Though, perhaps, that was the place to start: acknowledging that the list was far too long for a fourteen-year-old. No boy—no matter how rough and tumble—amassed such a sheer volume of injuries without “help” and he had a pretty good idea which of Harry’s relatives had been so inclined.
Stepping back with a nod, Cho smiled tightly. “Thank you, Professor. I’m ready to try. I hope I’m able to help.”
“Don’t be,” he replied with a wan smile. “You kept your word to me. My parents are their own people and I can’t force them to leave. It’s...a hard truth, but a truth all the same.”
Memories of gentle grey eyes and warm laughter danced through his mind, and he pressed a palm over his racing heart to calm the traitorous muscle that skipped multiple beats when Draco declared him “mine” to the entirety of Slytherin House. Rolling over with a muffled groan, Harry buried his head under the silk sheets and intentionally slowed his breathing until his tired body overrode his brain and gave in to the pull of sleep.
They stopped outside the doors of the Great Hall while Pansy smartened him up with a de-wrinkling and hair straightening charm. The hair charm didn’t straighten his waves so much as make them less chaotic, but she was not deterred. Spelling mousse through his thick mop and whispering a series of styling charms under her breath, she determinedly worked his hair into something more artfully tousled and less bedhead chic. Blaise, meanwhile, shrunk his jeans and shapeless tee to fit him and transfigured his glasses into rectangular frames, whistling appreciatively at their handiwork when they were done.
Shame filled Draco and trickled through the bond, prompting Harry to squeeze tighter. Merlin, Draco didn’t deserve this boy. Harry was far too good for him and he was certain when he came clean, he’d lose any chance at a romantic soul bond, but after all they shared he couldn’t lie to Harry now.
She stepped back with a pat on his cheek and a hushed promise to see him in the morning. Bobbing her head goodnight to the other boys, she spun on her heel and headed toward the girls’ dormitories. Blessedly, Crabbe and Goyle followed her lead and left the roommates to their own devices.
The witch flicked her hair over her shoulder with a haughty sniff. “Non, I would not wish it, either. You are handsome enough, I suppose, but you are not...how do you say?” Fleur pointed to Krum’s bulging biceps, which the Bulgarian flexed with a grin.
His friends waved him away and within moments he found himself outside Severus’ chambers. He steeled himself for the difficult conversation ahead, breathing out his anxiety on a ragged exhale. With a perfunctory rap of his knuckles against the hidden door, he sauntered inside.
Nipping the boy’s earlobe affectionately, the scarlet creature turned ageless eyes to Draco and bowed its head. Draco returned it automatically, blinking in stunned confusion when the phoenix shot into the air and returned to his perch upstairs.
He hopped off the bed and stretched his stiff joints with a hushed groan. Tip-toeing on socked feet, he carefully opened the curtains around Harry’s bed. The Gryffindor was sprawled on his stomach, arms curled under the pillow, plump lips slightly parted, and hair sticking in all directions.
When they reached the entrance further along the wall, Draco muttered the password loud enough for Harry to hear with a sly smile before confidently leading him into the snake pit. Everyone froze when they saw who stood awkwardly at his side, but a reassuring hand landed on the Gryffindor’s shoulder, and Harry didn’t miss how all eyes tracked the possessive gesture.
Harry hummed as he plopped on his trunk at the foot of the bed, now bearing a “Potter” nameplate, and absently toed off his shoes and shrugged off his jumper. Draco had the sheets turned down when he stood and his stomach fluttered at the gesture. It spoke volumes about Draco’s thoughtfulness and his cheeks warmed under the blond’s soft gaze, feeling exposed in his trousers and a faded t-shirt as he settled on the bed.
“Oh gods, Harry,” he croaked, heart fluttering wildly to finally hear his name caressed in his warm tone.
“Thank, Merlin,” Draco sighed before their lips met in a tender kiss. It said far more than either of them were willing to admit. Later, perhaps, but not yet. They parted after a few moments but didn’t go far, resting their foreheads together as their combined magic thrummed with contentment.
“It’s kill or be killed, Harry,” Dumbledore informed him sadly once they were alone. “The other champions are of age and they will be more prepared than you. I suggest studying additional spells and working on your duelling in your spare time. This is not a game, my boy.”
Gritting his teeth as she returned to her fawning friends, he caught a flash of platinum blond hair ducking out of the Great Hall and crowed to himself in triumph. Turning tail and running as soon as he laid eyes on the formerly cursed girl standing healthy and hale spoke of a man with a guilty conscience.
“Could be his ticket back in, perhaps?” Pansy said tentatively. The group hummed in consideration while Harry struggled to absorb the fact that Krum’s headmaster was a former Death Eater.
“If your editor asks, tell them his official response is ‘no comment.’ Now, if you’ll excuse us, we have a class to attend.” Closing ranks around the newest Slytherin, they hustled through the hall to the potions lab.
“Thank you. I am happy to be here.” He chanced a peek at Draco to make sure he hadn’t accidentally caused offence and relaxed at his subtle wink.
Severus grimaced and cleared his throat. “Your mother was about 5’ 10”, I believe, and your father was 6’ 1” by the time we graduated. I know because he and I topped out at the same.”
The atmosphere of the Great Hall crackled in anticipation of the revelation of the Tri-Wizard Champions after the feast. Yet even through the noise Fred and George could be heard recounting a rather embellished tale of passing the age line. Though their beards had disappeared, they transfigured cloth napkins into new ones for the enraptured first years.
Sighing heavily, Draco lowered his gaze and flicked an imaginary piece of lint off his trousers, wondering how forthright he should be. “I believe you, you know...about the Dark Lord and all the times you’ve faced him. This summer was merely a taste of what’s coming and despite my attitude over the years, I don’t believe all that blood supremacy nonsense. Not anymore, at any rate.” Swallowing hard, Draco peeked at him and fidgeted under his scrutiny.
“I hate asking a student to do such a thing, especially when the other is incapacitated, but it seems we have little choice.”
Her eyes shone with excitement. “Like Sirius’s mirror?” Harry flinched, and she instantly became contrite, but he waved away her apology. Studying the coins as she considered the options, she finally nodded in satisfaction.
He watched, rapt, as Draco threw back his head and laughed, showing off the elegant column of his neck and dislodging his hands from his face to rest lightly on his shoulders.
Glancing at the boy next to him, Draco frowned at his slightly hunched shoulders. “Are you alright? I know we’d already had our share of excitement before Severus went full dungeon bat to throw off suspicion.”
The leather creaked when the Hat’s grin stretched to match his wearer’s. “Well then, I’m glad I can finally say: better be SLYTHERIN!”
Releasing a long breath, Harry straightened his spine and slowly closed the distance between them. “I’m doing something I should have done a long time ago,” he answered, extending a hand. Draco gaped at him in astonishment, his arm falling to his side in shock.
The edge of the paper crumpled in her clenched fist, and her eyes flashed with anger. “Has someone hurt you?” He shook his head jerkily. “Threatened you, perhaps?”
The tears Harry valiantly reined in finally fell as Draco’s wise words soothed the jagged edges of his soul. Listening to his former rival speak so eloquently about abuse and the invisible scars left behind, while simultaneously praising him for not allowing it to diminish who he was, filled a void he didn’t know he had. A desperate need to validate his experiences without belittling his accomplishments—a desire to be
He was right, of course. Magic tied them together in the womb, recognizing they were two halves of a whole. When he thought about it, Harry realized he’d only ever had eyes for the blond boy. No matter how he lied to himself to justify his reasons for watching Draco so intently, the truth could no longer be denied. He flushed when he realized he’d been crushing on his soulmate for quite a while, but because of the biases he grew up with, he hadn’t connected the dots.
A wide grin lit up his face as he snorted in amusement. “Oh, just some scrawny git who stumbled into the robe shop, clueless and lost, but when he looked at me he flipped my world upside down in an instant.”
“Dumbledore,” Harry declared firmly, though Draco didn’t miss the disappointment flickering across his face with the abrupt shift of objective.
A choked whine slipped past his lips without permission as he cupped Draco’s face. “I promise,” he swore. “But you must promise me, no matter what you hear, no matter how long it takes, that you will stay safe. I can’t fight a war if I’m worried about you.”
Before he could reply, Harry cleared his throat and Draco immediately straightened. His forehead creased as he skimmed the boy in concern, but Harry shuffled through his inner circle with a faint smile.
“Thank you, Harry. I shall endeavour to maintain your trust and ensure it is not misplaced.” Furrowing his brows at the mediwitch, he said, “Poppy, it goes without saying that even the Headmaster is not to see this document. It contains highly sensitive information and I believe the fewer people who are aware of it, the better.”
“Stay close today,” Draco murmured, the fingers of his free hand trailing along Harry’s arm, leaving fire in his wake before tangling with his. “If I’m not with you, stick with Pansy or the lads. Do not go anywhere alone.”
Breaking apart bashfully, they scurried toward her, and she greeted them with a dazzling smile. “Hello, boys. Did you enjoy your fly?”
Merlin and Morgana. It would require copious amounts of alcohol to relay the troubling information to Severus later.
; not his fame or his Galleons. Someone who would understand him and accept him—even on bad days when he didn’t want to leave his bed after nightmares of the Dursleys or encounters with Voldemort.
A slender thumb caressed Harry’s knuckles, helping him remain centred as he considered Snape’s words. They were genuine and full of remorse, pricking his sensitive conscience. It didn’t help that his brain saw fit to remind him of the doe frolicking around the room while tears filled the man’s eyes.
Melting around him, Draco whispered, “I’m going to take care of you, Harry. I want to give you everything because you deserve no less, and I promise you’ll never be alone again. Whatever comes, we deal with together.”
Clearing his throat, Harry said, “Look, I have a meeting with Dumbledore right now. I’ll catch you in the common room afterward.” They nodded and offered him fleeting smiles as they turned to leave, but they hadn’t gone far before Harry snapped his fingers.
“Grand! Call me Tracey, yeah? Hearing anyone my age callin’ me ‘miss’ is likely ta be givin’ me a complex.” Daphne and Millicent chuckled and insisted he use their given names, as well, to which Harry readily agreed.
Draco furrowed his brow but reluctantly released him, leaving his hand hanging uselessly in the air as Harry fled.
The sound of Harry slamming his fist on the desk reverberated like a thunderclap. “He didn’t even know he had the option when we spoke earlier! Maybe if you gave him a choice, offered him some fucking hope, he might’ve taken it sooner. But we’ll never know now, will we, sir?”
Severus had a point. Assuring students were safe in the castle was the Headmaster’s job and it rankled that the man didn’t seem to care about Harry’s tenuous position within his House.
Draco’s scowl deepened with each shake of his head as a myriad of questions danced in his head. Why hadn’t his Head of House come for him? Or Dumbledore, for that matter? They knew where he’d taken refuge. Unless...the Gryffindors hadn’t informed McGonagall he was staying outside the tower. But why wouldn’t they tell her? Surely they could twist the story to their benefit and make Harry out to be the villain; it would be believable enough with the rumours swirling that he cheated his way into the tournament. Yet none of those questions explained why the Headmaster hadn’t swooped in to rescue his favourite student from Slytherin’s evil clutches. The man had house-elves spying on him, for fuck’s sake.
“Heir Potter, it is a pleasure to meet you officially,” she said, her voice surprisingly kind, yet commanding.
“All of my friends are from prominent families,” Draco said. “Our parents decided when we were young to set us up on play dates, but we weren’t actually allowed to play. Instead, we took etiquette and dance lessons with tutors who rapped our knuckles anytime we giggled.
Nodding crisply at his insistence, she flicked her wand to seal the scroll and sent it whizzing to her office. “I’ve locked it in the safe with my other highly personal case files.” Pinning the man with a stern glare, she whispered, “I imagine you have a plan?”
The icy glares and jeers of their classmates were immediate, but his re-emergence into Hogwarts society flanked by Slytherins made things worse. He should have expected it, especially after disappearing for an entire day following his announcement as the fourth champion, but after being safely sequestered for the afternoon the furor caused by his arrival unnerved him.
Twelve hours ago Harry marched to his end, where he had a lovely chat with his grandfather, Fleamont. Given the chance to return to the land of the living or step into the light and be free of life’s burdens, he took the first option without a second thought. As Draco’s name echoed on the breeze in the meadow they sat in, Fleamont gave Harry his blessing with a hug before sending him back through the veil.
Harry decided that of all times they would benefit from brutal honesty it was now. Lifting Draco’s head from his shoulder so he could see his face, Harry’s free hand skittered feather-light along his arm.
Harry chuckled. “No, I much prefer Draco to Lucius. I’m willing to bet the rest of the world will, too,” he said, idly thumbing the soft knuckles cupped in his hands. “You’re not him, you know. You will never be him. I keep my promises, Draco.”
Draco grinned to hear them claim Harry—a brother in all but blood. Joy bubbled in his chest and spilled past his lips with a laugh as he tossed a wadded pair of socks to the bed opposite him.
Clenching his fists, Harry breathed deeply as he prepared to explain. “My relatives aren’t...kind to me. They hate magic, which means they hate me. I cook and clean for them, but they rarely let me eat more than once a day. If I’m lucky, I can sneak scraps while they’re not looking, but that’s rare.” Draco hissed angrily as so many of the boy’s peculiarities suddenly made sense and took Harry’s hand in an instinctive need to console him as silent tears trickled across his face.
“Moody,” Dumbledore chided. The man curled his lip as though something stank and took an angry swig from his flask, but he reluctantly backed off as the Headmaster approached.
“Gee, thanks, Mione,” he deadpanned, stomach dancing with butterflies in response to the usually stoic boy’s rich laughter.
“Harry!” They both suppressed a groan as Hermione appeared looking mildly panicked with Ron pulling up the rear. “Where have you been? We’ve searched everywhere for you, but we couldn’t find the map —”
Shaking his head in bewilderment, Draco said, “You don’t even know how amazing you are, do you? You’re un-bloody-believable. You should hate me for the things I’ve said and done, yet you’re telling me you feel the same for me that I do for you.”
“I will reach out to them with an offer of protection, but they must accept it. To extract them abruptly would increase the danger to you,” he explained apologetically. Draco slumped in resignation. He knew his father would refuse—his fear of the Dark Lord outweighed his common sense—but his mother was an unknown.
Severus rapped his knuckles smartly against McGonagall’s door, swooping into the room with a self-important air when she bade them enter. She remained unfazed as the Slytherins filed into her room until she saw Harry sandwiched between them. Jumping from her chair in alarm, McGonagall sputtered when the letter was shoved unceremoniously in her face.
“Yes, darling. You can count on us,” Pansy mumbled against his shirt. “If only there was a way for you to switch houses so you didn’t have to leave.”
Sipping his water to cool the heat rising along his face, he hoped the man couldn’t see his flush in the dim light. “I was merely proving a point.”
Pursing her lips, McGonagall continued, “Of course, we do not know for sure where the Hat will place you —”
Theo pressed a hand over his heart and held Draco’s steely gaze. “I don’t care what colour uniform he wears; he’s my brother now. Same as you and the lads.” Draco nodded and shot a glance at Blaise, who flashed his palm in agreement.
It was a chaste press of lips, both too afraid of making a mistake to move them, but that didn’t stop their arms from circling each other. They parted a few seconds later, cheeks flushed and eyes wide, matching smiles blooming on their faces.
He chuckled as he left the gobsmacked Prince to deal with his errant subjects and headed to the bathroom for a cold shower.
a Slytherin, which meant he had cunning and ambition in spades. If his “seal it with a kiss” idea didn’t pan out, he’d simply devise a long-term plan to make Harry his. Some things were worth waiting for.
Draco hadn’t told his friends what he’d done for Harry over the summer; not because he didn’t trust them, but because keeping mum was the best way to guarantee Lucius didn’t find out. He’d gambled on the Gryffindor’s acceptance of his aid at the Cup and his silence afterward. It was a dangerous game they’d played, but it explained their startling lack of animosity with the new school year and the unwavering trust that flourished between them since their alliance.
Severus huffed wryly and pursed his lips to disguise his smile. “And why is that?” Teekey levelled him with a look the students couldn’t decipher, but Severus knew she was chastising him for hiding behind his aloofness.
“If you don’t mind removing your shoes, I’ll start with a simple scan to determine your height and weight.”
The elf smiled, gigantic eyes full of warmth. “Of course, young master. Are you needing anything else?”
Neville clicked his tongue in aggravation, and Dean rolled his eyes. “Because you’re Harry bloody Potter and rules apparently don’t apply to you,” Dean snapped. “We’ve been here from day one. Always taking a backseat to your adventures and watching the Headmaster make one excuse after another for you whenever you skive off to do whatever the fuck you’re on about.”
Once again, the group hastened through the halls, this time with McGonagall leading while Severus took the rear, sneering at anyone who stared at their retinue for too long.
“Thank you, sir,” they chorused, happily falling in behind their professor as he strode purposefully out of the Headmaster’s turret.
Resisting the urge to roll his eyes at his godfather’s dramatics, he trailed obediently in his wake. Once they were a safe distance from the Great Hall, they surreptitiously ducked into an empty classroom. Severus instantly warded the chamber for privacy but held up a hand to forestall Draco’s questions.
“Tomorrow all eyes will be upon us as never before, but no matter what the rest of the castle believes about us,
“How...how did he come out of whatever he’s gone through and stay so bloody nice?” Theo asked disbelievingly.
The cup flared again and absolutely no one was surprised by Viktor Krum’s appointment as Durmstrang’s champion. An electric hum of magic buzzed in Harry’s ears as the crowd waited on tenterhooks for the last announcement.
Pansy tutted disapprovingly at Harry’s sparse plate, piling it high with roasted vegetables while Draco poured a generous dollop of sweet gravy over his roast duck, and Crabbe laid two buttered rolls along the edge. Blaise and Theo chuckled at his gobsmacked expression across the table.
“Dinner is in four hours and I expect each of you to represent Slytherin House with all the prestige afforded to it,” Snape warned. No sooner had the affirmatives left their mouths than he nodded curtly. “Then I shall take my leave.”
After a brief pause, Harry faced him directly and asked, “Why are you here, Malfoy? How did you even find me?”
I hope you like it because as I said, I have some revising to do on what I have currently written and then I have to finish it, as well. So updates will be sporadic, but they will happen. Thank you so much to everyone reading! I appreciate it so much and I love your comments and kudos. They mean so very much to me!
With a choked cry, Harry clutched his shirt as though he was the last port in a storm, clinging desperately to him as his whole body shook under the force of his sobs. As his own eyes stung with heartsick tears, Draco held tight; a willing anchor against the maelstrom of emotion attempting to drown the boy in his arms.
Forcing down the lump in his throat, Harry replied, “I think I can forgive you in time, Professor. I need to think about what you’ve said, but I accept your apology.” He paused briefly to steady himself and said, “From what I understand about my mum, she was a warm, caring person and she wouldn’t have counted you as a friend if she didn’t trust you. So, I’m going to do the same, because you’ve been more honest with me than Dumbledore has in four years. I would like to be re-sorted, sir. Today, if possible.”
“And you, Heiress Bulstrode,” he said nervously. He needn’t have worried. Millicent’s disarming smile was enough to reassure him he’d done well.
Harry didn’t repeat the sentiment aloud, though he knew by Draco’s warm gaze he didn’t need to. They knew where they stood with each other now.
Hopefully, love would win out, not only in the small battles fought at home but in the war looming on the horizon. For now, though, they hugged their loved ones a little tighter each day and clung to the hope embodied in a boy with a lightning scar.
Covering her mouth with her hand, Hermione smothered her shocked cry, but couldn’t stop her feet from bringing her closer. “I’m so sorry,” she whispered. “I want to hug you. Will you let me?”
“Yeah,” Harry croaked, offering a shaky smile. “Thank you for your help. I don’t know why I couldn’t say anything. I just...froze. Gods, I feel like an idiot.”
Maybe it would be better if they took care of each other. Harry needed someone to support him without coddling him and Draco needed trust and security to lower his walls. They both required a partner who accepted their flaws, who wouldn’t run when things got tough, and who didn’t see one another as pawns, but rather as equals. Draco would fight for Harry and he knew Harry would fight for him, but they would go to war together.
“Mr. Potter is busy learning, Mr. Creevey. This is still a school, and no one is afforded special treatment. Not even our
“Oi! He’s not dead, you idiots!” Silence descended again and he cancelled the charm but made sure his voice carried through the room. “We’re not that stupid, you know. Merlin, give us some credit.”
, however, took Harry’s breath away. He swallowed hard when his eyes zeroed in on long, slender fingers working the cream into his skin with meticulous strokes, thumbs dragging across flexing muscles and delicate wrists. Well, that explained why the usual wand and broom calluses were absent on Draco. Unconsciously, Harry glanced at his own smaller, rougher hands and grimaced, recalling how most of the hardened patches on his palms had been gained long before school.
that we believed might help Harry with his predicament. It led to a discussion with Professor Snape and brought us here.”
Harry gasped when the dragon on his chest beat its wings and roared, and Draco responded in kind as the phoenix trilled through the pulse of their bond. Taking the opportunity afforded him, Harry slipped his tongue into Draco’s open mouth. His knees almost buckled when they slid and curled together as though meant to, which he supposed as soulmates, they were.
Securing his cloak and map, he pulled out his wand and slipped inside the bathroom, casting a silencing spell over the door. But none of his mental pep talks could have prepared him for the sight of Malfoy bowed over a sink, sobbing violently. His hair hung limp and his bony shoulders shook with the force of the cries, ripped from deep within his core. With a guttural snarl, he ripped off his jumper and gripped the edge of the basin until his knuckles popped from the strain.
“Try telling Harry that and see how well you come out of that argument,” she said dryly. “Malfoy, even if he isn’t in love with you, he
Peeking at him from under his arm, Draco smirked. “Hedwig is more than an owl, though. She’s your familiar. Of course, you two get along.”
Flashing him a smirk, Draco stretched out his legs and crossed them genteelly at the ankle. “We ally with him, of course. Well, the Slytherins and myself, anyway. You can maintain your disdain for him to keep up appearances if you prefer.”
Harry gaped at the suddenness of his departure. He watched Draco suck in deep breaths through red, glossy lips, his blond hair hopelessly tousled, and eyes wild with panic.
Harry spent a few quiet moments cursing the ancient magic that believed he could have a civil conversation with the Slytherin Prince; much less accept him as his soulmate.
“You’re welcome,” she smiled. Tilting her head in entreaty, she asked, “Would you like me to go with you?”
Shrugging lightly, he quipped, “Call me an optimist, but yes, I trust you.” With a soft smile, Harry cupped his face tenderly and continued. “This is your chance to escape. Hopefully, Dumbledore can save your parents, too, but I won’t lie and say you aren’t my primary concern.” Draco swallowed hard with the admission, a shy blush staining his cheeks with his frankness.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked. Harry ducked his head, but he caught his chin and held his gaze. “Don’t be embarrassed about your feelings or your fears. Not with me. I will never shame you for them, and if I do, you can sic Pansy on me.”
“Of course not,” she simpered, releasing Harry to bestow perfunctory kisses on Draco’s waiting cheeks. When it was Harry’s turn, however, she wrapped him in a tight hug and murmured, “Welcome to Slytherin, darling. Let me know if you ever need anything, and I do mean
Grabbing his favourite joggers and a loose t-shirt, Harry concealed the rush of conflicting emotions with a shrug.
Harry spread his hands with a bitter smile. “There isn’t one. If your name comes out of the Goblet, you’re magically bound to take part or you become a Squib. Period.”
Taking the disheartening information in stride, he forced a lazy smile. “Well, there is a silver lining, if you think about it.” Draco smirked as he waited for the punchline. “I’ll just have to put your absurd height to use and make you reach the tall shelves for me. Hope you don’t mind,” he teased with a genuine grin.
Theo narrowed his eyes as he leaned forward on his bed. “There’s more you’re not telling us, isn’t there?”
Her Scottish brogue was noticeably more pronounced when she spoke. “You are demanding a re-sort, Mr. Potter? You are unhappy in your House?”
Harry’s expression turned shrewd and Draco arched a curious brow at the Slytherin-esque transformation. “Protection, huh? Even from Muggles?”
Krum and Cedric shared an incredulous glance, but it was gone so quickly Harry couldn’t say for certain it ever took place.
Everyone watched with bated breath as the wizards stared at one another, a silent conversation taking place in the magically charged atmosphere. Books rattled on the shelves and portraits clung to their frames as the walls quaked. The crash of glass in a far corner of the room went ignored as Harry’s power lashed out at the man he held responsible for his pain. Leaving him on the Dursley’s front steps to grow up hated, purposefully withholding vital information every time he faced Voldemort, and now abandoning him when he needed his mentorship most.
“Of course we do,” Harry insisted. “I never meant to steal your thunder, Cedric. I was excited for you when you were announced. Why would I want to take that away from any of you?”
Ducking his head to hide his smug grin, he nodded. “Yes, Mrs. Malfoy. Our captain, Marcus Flint, assured me in a letter that I don’t need to try out, but I will anyway since it’s only fair.”
Rattling the frame in anger, he opened his mouth to tell her off, but no sound passed his lips. Swirling his cloak behind him in a manner very similar to their professor, he stomped through the forest and out of sight. The elf turned to Severus with a too-innocent expression, sending his astonished guests into a fit of giggles.
“But?” Draco coaxed gently, his stomach tying itself in knots over the crushing fear flooding the soul bond.
Harry nodded again, his eyes slipping shut to concentrate on synching their respirations to the steady four-count, filling Draco with pride at Harry’s implicit trust and reaffirming his oath to never break it. Hearing footsteps and murmurs as the adults approached, Draco cast a quick muffling charm to prevent Harry from becoming distracted. When Madam Pomfrey and Severus peeked around the curtain, he shook his head and they ducked out without a word.
