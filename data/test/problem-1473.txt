After a few more minutes, another eager hand shot up into the air and Fleur nodded, gesturing for Susan Bones to speak.
"Oh please! Do you think I'm a fool?" Pansy scoffed as she reached for her wand again and pointed it directly at Aria's hair.
She was insanely sexy, and every single person in the room (male and female) probably thought so too.
"What is it?" Hannah asked as she sniffed suspiciously at it before lifting it to her lips and taking a small, timid sip.
"How many more ingredients are left?" Aria sounded tired as she looked up from where she was arranging some Dittany herbs on her basket.
"I didn't want to do this, you know." Bentley turned his attention back to her, his features twisting into a derisive leer. "I would have been perfectly happy watching you from the sidelines with someone else...someone worthy by your side. But you were just so,
"I told you that wasn't me! I never said those things!" Pansy argued, her voice becoming shrill with frustration.
As Draco moved to follow Pansy and the rest of their classmates toward the doors, he heard Fleur speak up again and he froze mid-step, glancing curiously over his shoulder to where she stood waiting in front of the teacher's desk.
He yanked her toward him by her legs and spun her around, pulling her up and manhandling her roughly onto her knees. His hands squeezed at her ass, giving it a brief, stinging slap that made her gasp before he thrust into her from behind and shoved her head down against the pillows.
"Tell me the truth then." Draco's voice softened into a whisper as he stared imploringly at her, watching all of the turbulent emotions on her face. "What
As soon as he stood up from his chair, most of the students in the room gasped in alarm when Wood suddenly vanished into thin air — only to reappear a few seconds later at the very back of the room. He smirked at their startled expressions and sat down onto one of the empty student seats in the corner, forcing everyone to turn around in their seats to face him.
Bentley pointed his wand at him, levitating Draco by the neck and lifting him up until his shoes dangled above the floor. Draco struggled wildly, trying to reach for his wand but it was no use; and Bentley just scoffed at him before lifting him up higher and hurling him across the room. There was a loud 'smacking' sound as Draco ended up hitting the back of his head against the wall, and he winced, crumpling down to the floor.
It wasn't hard to stare at the last passenger who exited the train — a tall, dark-haired girl who began to turn heads the instant she stepped onto the platform. She was too far away for Draco to see her face clearly, so he wasn't sure if it was her at first (especially since it's been more than four months since he last saw her) but when she finally turned around and looked up, meeting his eyes from a few meters away, his breath caught and he instantly felt his cheeks grow embarrassingly warm despite the cold.
Astoria sniffed again and looked away. After a few seconds, she reluctantly glanced back at him and met his smug expression with a sullen glare.
Her features were frozen into a perfectly composed, indiscernible mask. "As in the Girl-who-Lived, the Chosen One, the Savior of the Wizarding World and all that rubbish,
She wasn't sure how long it took him to turn around and face her. It might have been seconds, but to Aria, it felt like
Wood noticed their ashen faces and he chuckled at them before sitting back down behind the teacher's desk.
"Eventually, I suppose. But Pansy and I just bought a place up in Chelsea, so I'm actually planning to take a short break. We've been thinking of doing some traveling around Europe for awhile. Pansy's even planned out a very detailed 6-month itinerary for our trip already." Neville answered, wincing to himself.
At least, back then, she liked to think that most of her clashes with Draco were born from the animosity between two innocent little kids who liked to pick on each other for the silliest of reasons. It was a different situation altogether when she thought about how she and Draco had fought in the last two years – when the two of them were on opposite sides of the war. In that situation, there was no need for name-calling or pranks anymore; because during the war, they were actually expected to kill each other.
"Basically, instead of a discussion, Instructor Delacour has so kindly agreed to take part in a question and answer discourse that will dispel most of the common misconceptions some of you may have about veelas. Be sure to make the most out of this opportunity as this will also help you with your research assignment on veela." McGonagall added sternly.
Eventually, he found Aria talking to Hannah near the windows, both girls busy as they helped the 7th years hang up a row of lanterns along the walls. As he watched her from across the room, Draco's eyes darkened and he bit his lip when Aria bent down to retrieve a mistletoe from the floor, inadvertently rewarding him with a good peak of her legs underneath her school skirt.
Unfortunately, it didn't seem to work because when he tried to part her legs even wider, Aria gave out a startled squeak and, reacting in a way that was probably born out of feminine self-preservation, she instinctively tried to snap her legs back shut.
"Besides." He added playfully, chuckling at the frustrated look on her face when he drew his mouth away. "I've realized that there are other, more interesting titles I'm willing to accept instead of 'mate', anyway."
"Good luck with practice, you two." Neville looked up from his book again and offered both Blaise and Aria a quick, distracted grin and a lazy thumbs-up.
He nipped at her again in admonishment before resuming his teasing, lapping hungrily at her and tapping his tongue rhythmically against her clit a few times before swirling around it, causing Aria to choke back a scream. When he curled his fingers inside her and nipped at her clit one last time, Aria finally came with a shuddering gasp, her eyes rolling back as she went completely limp in his arms.
"I noticed that the symbols on your neck are gone." He said in a quiet voice. "So...That means you really—?"
make them stop. She blinked rapidly and reached up, furiously wiping her eyes with the back of her hands. When she tried to look away, she accidentally met Draco's gaze again; but when she saw the way his gray eyes had softened as he stared at her, the last of Aria's restraint over her emotions finally broke down, and she began to cry softly.
"I don't know, okay?! I wasn't thinking!" Draco finally exploded, cutting off the rest of Pansy's outburst when he growled and crumpled up the parchment in front of him into a tight ball in his fist. "Potter was sitting there and she was watching but she wasn't
They broke apart, looking up and staring in confusion at the sight of a blank-faced Morag waiting behind them. Draco immediately scowled when he saw her and he leveled her with a warning glare.
"Well, maybe if you actually bothered to do your assignments ahead of time like you're supposed to, you wouldn't be pulling all-nighters all the time." Morag pointed out with a scoff, rolling her eyes and giving her an admonishing glare. "Honestly, Potter…Is it really that hard for you to act like a normal student for once and actually do your assignments on time?"
"That depends." Draco shrugged, reaching up to rake a hand through his blond hair. "Exactly what kind of errands are you planning on doing in London anyway?" He asked.
Aria could only nod silently in agreement, her features schooled into a blank mask as she processed everything Hannah had just said. She drowned out the rest of Draco and Neville's muted conversation as she sank back slowly into her seat and stared intently into the fire, wrapping Draco's blanket tighter around her shoulders.
"Beautiful, are they not? I'm quite proud of my wings, actually. I take very good care of them." The smile on Fleur's face was particularly smug as she took in everyone's reactions. Chuckling, she turned around to give them a better view of the intricate, feathered appendages, flapping them several times and causing a few papers to fly off the desks of the students sitting in front.
Aria didn't get to hear the rest of her redheaded best friend's retort as the doors to the library's entrance slammed shut, cutting off their little banter.
" Blaise chuckled and used his wand to float a set of newly dried goblets to the counter behind him. "I think Draco's mother hasn't really signed off on the engagement yet. And besides, Draco's been busy all summer trying to contact this supposed 'dream girl' of his." He added distractedly.
"Hermione helped me to translate it properly over the summer." Aria whispered, biting back a tortured moan when Draco began sucking at the juncture between her neck and shoulder. "Other than you, she and Ron are the only ones who know my name." She added quietly.
Skeeter ignored Aria's angry remark and stepped closer towards their group. "So...Which one of these young gentlemen is Aria Potter dating? Hmm?" She leered and inspected all three boys' tense expressions.
"Oh that's right, we haven't properly caught up yet have we, Potter?" He said, waiting until Aria placed her gloved hand in his before he continued. "In any case, you can call me Zach. I'm pleased to make your acquaintance."
touch alone that could make Aria give out more of those wanton, wonderfully delicious little sounds she just did.
"That Chaser girl in Gryffindor with the insanely strong throw?" Blaise shook his head and pretended to give Zach a serious look. "You should probably keep your hands to yourself tonight. I should know, she hit
When he didn't let up and continued snickering at her, the blush on Aria's face darkened with humiliation. She looked away and hid her face behind her hands.
"Apologize?!" Draco stiffened and he sneered at the other boy in contempt. "Why the hell do I have to apologize?!"
"I suppose I'll take that one with my new housemates then." Hermione retorted, looking annoyed at their reactions.
"I take it you're still single, Abbott?" Malfoy suddenly spoke up, leveling Hannah with a particularly vicious sneer.
When Blaise still looked put out and didn't look inclined to answer, Draco sighed and pointed her towards the corner of the room.
"N—no, I wasn't—" Her eyes widened in belated realization and she shook her head at him, trying to stop laughing long enough so that she could give him an apologetic smile. "—I wasn't making fun of you, I swear! I was just thinking about how…It's…I can't believe that this whole time—" She broke herself off and collapsed into another fit of hysterical giggles, causing Draco to sigh in exasperation and cover his face with his hands.
Aria tried to swat at his head but failed miserably when Draco pressed a finger inside her, causing her to gasp and squirm in anticipation. "Are you just going to tease me the whole time?" She complained, closing her eyes and biting her lip to hold back another moan when he began to stroke her very gently.
As they walked through the school's corridors, it didn't escape Aria's attention that a lot of the students from Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw had taken to shooting them angry glares now. There was also an unmistakable trail of hushed, whispers and blatant pointing that followed them everywhere they went.
"Do what you want. Sleep on the floor for all I care." Pansy retorted irritably as she pulled back the comforters on her bed and began fluffing the pillows.
She sighed and decided to ignore the incessant flashing of the cameras from the group of reporters waiting for her from behind the doors. Luckily, they seemed to be leaving her alone for now; but Aria knew that they were just biding their time, waiting for the right opportunity to strike before they descended upon her like the pack of vultures they were.
"Well, my being here wasn't exactly by choice." Aria answered him with a chuckle as she relaxed her stance, tucking her wand back into her robes. "But it's good to see you anyway, Firenze." She added warmly.
"So what happened then? Why didn't it work out?" Morag prodded curiously, a small smirk on her face as she took after Hannah and alternated her gaze back and forth between Draco and Pansy.
"I see." Draco paused and turned to look at her again, studying the strange, conflicting emotions in her eyes. "Is it because I'm a Malfoy? I can assure you, I'm not the pureblood supremacist that the bloody Prophet makes us out to be. Well, at least not anymore—"
that he actually made you believe in any of it! Frankly, I should have hexed his balls off for talking about you in such an ugly, disrespectful way!"
" Pansy shook her head and shuddered, silencing the rest of Morag's words with a nauseated glare. "No more disgusting comments out of you. At least not until I've finished my breakfast."
"She's right, though. That wasn't funny." Ron mumbled in agreement as he shoved a spoonful of mash potatoes into his mouth, accidentally spraying Aria with bits of food as he spoke.
"What?!" Ron blurted out, glaring at his girlfriend with a hint of betrayal. "You mean to tell me you're ditching me to spend time
Blaise winked at Draco, which Draco returned with another smirk before they both backed off, but not before they caged her between them again and they each pressed a kiss onto her cheek at the same time, Draco on her left, Blaise on her right.
"So what do we do now?" Blaise frowned and turned to Draco. "How exactly are we going to find a replacement Chaser in time?"
Hermione, thank you!" Ron grinned widely, instantly cheering up, and he gave Hermione a quick hug and kiss on the cheek.
To Aria's utter dismay, Draco chose that moment to finally look up from his book and stare directly at her from across the table.
Skeeter's face lit up with glee when she reached Aria, her beady eyes immediately scrutinizing their group with the senses of a hawk about to attack its prey. "What a lovely group of young ladies and gentlemen we have here. So...Aria Potter."
"What's not that simple?" Pansy asked curiously as she took the seat beside Blaise, helping herself to some freshly baked croissants. Neville, who had slid into the seat beside Pansy, reached out and took the basket of croissants for her, using a pair of tongs to place two of them onto her plate.
she chose to wear a dress from a muggle designer, Aria finally managed to wrestle herself away from the persistent group.
"I saw her just before I got on the train. She, Granger and Weasley were one of the first people here." Greg answered.
She gasped when he bit down onto the skin of her neck, just below her jaw, before licking soothingly at the forming bruise. His eyes heavy lidded with lust, he eventually pulled away and looked down at her writhing form, smirking at her until she growled and began pawing at his clothes.
When the awkward silence stretched on for a few more agonizing minutes, Draco sighed and, to avoid apologizing to his friends for his outburst, he turned his attention back to McGonagall again just as the Headmistress was beginning to explain to the crowd of 8th years the newly implemented rules and guidelines for the school year.
"Give me a break, Malfoy. I just got out of the hospital wing this morning, remember?" Aria pointed out, glaring at him over the thick glasses that were beginning to slide off her nose. With an exasperated sigh, she shoved them back up onto her face and reluctantly trudged after him.
Draco swallowed the lump in his throat and forced himself to continue. "I would know, of course. I learned that the hard way. I was a model son, after all. I followed my father blindly for the first seventeen years of my life, and well, look where that got me."
against my mother." Draco's eyes narrowed and the pitch of his voice suddenly lowered into an ominous, dangerous hiss.
"Expulsion?" Corner scoffed at the self-assurance he heard in her voice and shook his head. "You don't have
"Did I stutter?!" Ron growled again, gripping the other boy's robes tighter and jostling him impatiently. "Then let me say it again. You're.
Draco followed her gaze and turned around. Eventually, his eyes widened and an amused smirk formed on his lips when he saw Hannah (in a surprisingly seductive outfit, sans her usual pigtails) straddling Theodore Nott on one of the plush leather couches near the very back of the room. They were making out
"Once you get past her intimidating demeanor, you'll realize that she's just really shy and insecure." Hermione told her in an admonishing tone of voice. "And despite her size, she's a very lovely and gentle girl, actually. Did you know that every time she gets chocolates from her family, she shares them with all of us girls in the dorm? And plus, her cat, Butterscotch, is the
with it." Morag interrupted Aria, offering Draco a careless shrug. "It's like monogamy, really. It's good enough, but kind of overrated.
She slipped her gloved hand around Greg's offered arm, pointedly ignoring the sulky look on Draco's face. Greg nodded and they both walked off towards the Great Hall. Draco watched them leave, irrationally
But yes, just so we're clear - I still think you're nothing but a whiny, conniving bitch." She spat.
Unfortunately, her efforts were futile because Draco just smirked at her and grabbed the back of her knees to keep her in place. Then, ignoring the look of trepidation on her face, he spread her legs wide open and bent down, positioning his head directly between her thighs.
"A variety of reasons, I'd imagine." Fleur indulged him with an amused smile. "To accept a mate-bond with a veela is to form a deeply emotional connection that not a lot of wizards are willing to make. Your thoughts and feelings will be laid bare to each other once the bond is established. You'll be able to hear each other's thoughts, feel each other's pain, suffering. You can see how that would turn off not just wizards, but also veelas, yes? Not everyone is ready for that kind of commitment." Fleur explained.
"So that's a no then, huh?" Blaise made a face at her and pretended to shake his head in disapproval. "I'm disappointed in you, Abbott. Have I not taught you anything?! You're a Slytherin now, you have to know what you want and know
Aria sighed and lowered her gaze to the ground, but not before Draco saw the genuine fear and uncertainty in her eyes.
have to threaten you to finish this?" Aria let out another tired sigh as she turned around again, crossing her arms over her chest. "Look, Corner. I've had a really long day. I'm really not in the mood to deal with a bastard like you right now."
Draco smirked, ready to believe Neville was going to go all 'Gryffindor' and sit down beside Pansy anyway but to his annoyance, Neville made his way over to him instead and gave him a slightly sheepish smile.
After checking quickly to make sure Blaise and Pansy weren't looking at him, Draco held the white object up into the light and studied it closely, a deeply contemplative look on his face.
They spent the next couple of hours in harmonious silence, both of them working diligently through their list of ingredients with impressive speed.
She waited until Neville eventually did the same before she continued. "Neville's right, she didn't mean it. And what Pansy said actually does make sense. It's not even just about Corey – those other kids from last time didn't deserve to be expelled either. And if I can, I should at least try to put a stop to all this nonsense anyway." She looked up and stared intently at Pansy, carefully considering her words.
I'll be honest; I wasn't entirely satisfied with how this chapter turned out, mainly because there were so many scenes I had to compress together to make it all fit. In any case, I decided to just post it anyway and get it all out of the way.
"No need for that, Potter." He ignored the confusion on her face and stood up, peeling off the dark green sweater he was wearing and handing it to her. "Tie this around your waist for now to cover up that rip. You can give it back to me when we all head back to the castle."
He didn't protest when she began leading him to the large kitchen adjacent to the living area. Aria went straight to the refrigerator and took out a half empty bottle of wine, pouring it into two glasses and handing one of them to Draco.
Draco's half-amused, half-exasperated whisper sounded thick with tears of his own as he pulled her closer against him, one of his hands tenderly caressing the back of her head while his other hand caught Aria's chin and tilted her face back up towards his.
As Fisher stomped away, disappearing from their line of sight, Draco realized that Aria hadn't moved or spoken a single word in several minutes. He glanced down at her, noting that the pained grimace on her face hadn't receded and that her attention seemed to be mostly focused on trying not to show any of them how painful her injury actually was.
As soon as the words had left her mouth, Aria instantly regretted them, especially when she noticed the way Blaise visibly stiffened. She was just about getting ready to sputter out an apology when he surprised her by speaking up in a low, tense voice.
Luckily, Draco didn't have to think of anything else to say because that was when Blaise suddenly sauntered over to them, grinning widely as he slung an arm around Draco's shoulders. Luna Lovegood trailed after him, her usual dreamy smile on her face as she stopped beside Astoria and watched as Draco tried to shove Blaise away.
Draco knew his friend well enough to know exactly what it meant for someone else to say that about him so he just snickered at her and pretended to shake his head in disappointment.
"What part of what I said did you all not understand?" Draco gritted his teeth, beginning to lose patience with the entire conversation. "There is absolutely
" Aria's eyes narrowed again and she shook her head firmly, ignoring the look of protest on Hermione's face. "No, it couldn't be Blaise, Hermione. He wouldn't do something like that, he'd have absolutely no reason to do it. It just…That doesn't make sense." She argued.
They were interrupted when the doors to the dormitory suddenly burst open, followed by Hannah storming inside and racing furiously across the room.
Corey blinked again, biting his lip as he flicked his uncertain gaze back and forth between the books and Draco. "I—I suppose I was? I'm not really sure but...I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to go through your things—"
Another group of hands shot up into the air and this time, Draco was surprised when he noticed that Pansy's was among them. Fleur nodded at her and Pansy lowered her hand before she answered.
We were actually rivals in school. In fact, I think she absolutely hated my guts." He looked up and gave her a wry, half-hearted smile.
"I have nothing more to say to you." Pansy hissed back at him. "Frankly, I would rather drop dead than to ever let you come near me again!"
Draco grimaced as he finally mustered up enough strength to separate their bodies and roll himself onto his back. He fell back against her pillows, staring blearily up at the ceiling.
His father, on the other hand, had not been so lucky but to Draco's surprise, Potter had decided to speak up defensively even for him, pointing out to the tribunal that Lucius Malfoy had been the only Death Eater who hadn't actually killed or tortured anyone during the war. And because of Potter's influence on the Ministry, Draco's father had managed to scrape by with only being placed under permanent house arrest – as opposed to the rest of the Death Eaters who were all either sentenced to life in Azkaban or placed on the wait list to receive the Dementor's Kiss.
important thing I learned this year, Miss Skeeter, it's that we shouldn't judge other people based on flimsy stereotypes. If I'm not mistaken, that's how wars tend to start out...Wouldn't
"Well, if that is the case, then I see no reason not to agree." McGonagall answered, giving them a curt nod. "I shall apprise the prefects of the other houses of the situation."
"Oh come off it, Draco." Blaise snorted, arching an eyebrow at him in challenge. "You know as well as I do that Potter's personality is hellish strong. She knows exactly who she is, struts around the place with her head held up high and stares you right in the face when you piss her off.
Apparently, it wasn't enough that she almost got mauled by a baby dragon during their Care of Magical Creatures class a few days ago (which had originally been aiming for
McGonagall frowned. "I don't want to; but unfortunately, the house-elves will be busy with a lot of other activities in the next few days so no one will be able to get all of the decorations up again in time."
She didn't speak nor react for such a long time that Draco thought she was going to ignore what he last said but then, her gaze slowly lifted back up and Draco nearly recoiled when he saw the look on her face.
"And lastly, Blaise Zabini will be keeper and Aria Potter will be our new seeker." Draco finished, looking up from his record once more and inspecting them all one by one.
" Fleur chuckled and shook her head to clear the dreamy look away from her face. "Once a veela has spoken these words, well…in colloquial terms, that's basically
"I'm surprised Slytherin doesn't do something similar." Aria mused as she reached over and helped herself to a generous serving of freshly brewed coffee. "And speaking of Slytherins, are you all always this
"I don't know yet." Aria fidgeted nervously at his question and looked away, pretending to pick at an imaginary piece of lint on her skirt. "I mean, I know I should…I really
"Eh, the git can entertain himself for a few minutes. I just wanted to talk to you." Blaise cast Draco a distracted look over his shoulder before he shook his head and turned his attention back to Aria.
"The only reason I suspect for your wand to be working perfectly for you again is that it probably already considers you and Aria as the same person."
"Alright then. Save the best for last." Blaise's amusement faltered when he turned to glance at his friend.
"I'm sorry!" Draco's eyes widened at her reaction and he immediately looked contrite as he jumped to his feet, moving away from her. "I didn't mean to touch you like that, I shouldn't have assumed—"
Sure enough, Hermione's eyes narrowed and she met Aria's indignant expression with an angry, admonishing glare of her own.
He noticed that Seamus Finnigan, Anthony Goldstein, and most of the other male students around the room suddenly straightened in their seats and were now listening intently to McGonagall in piqued interest.
"But…why me?" Greg blurted out, staring at her as though she had grown an extra pair of limbs. "I mean, I know I
"Oh hey, Neville." Aria greeted him as she looked up, meeting his nervous gaze. "Where were you this morning?"
when I think about it though." Ron ignored the way Aria began slapping his arm and continued, schooling his face into an exaggeratedly disgusted grimace. "I mean, the idea of you and that ferret making out – all kissing and hugging and exchanging saliva – eurrrghhhh! Just…
"It's nice to meet you, Corey." Aria gave him a genuine smile back, amused by his exuberance. "Your sister tells me that you've been having a bit of trouble with DADA this year?" She asked.
Pansy! Leave him alone!" Hannah hissed out, causing Pansy to freeze and blink at her in angry disbelief.
Aria reluctantly followed his gaze, trying hard not to scowl when she saw the short-haired girl glaring back at her.
When Hannah just blushed darker and Aria responded by stuffing half a treacle tart into her mouth, Blaise glanced at Draco instead. To Aria's dismay, Draco just rolled his eyes and gave Blaise an impassive glare.
"If I remember correctly, Goyle's always been considerate with the girls in his year even back then. We probably just never noticed it because we were never housemates with him." Aria continued hastily before Ron could notice that she had drifted off in her own thoughts.
'Why not? He was forced to go home again and live happily with his parents that worship a monster; of course I should be worried about him,' Harry replied to his headmaster's words. How could he not be worried about Draco? Who knew what that cruel father of his had in store for his son after his escape. After helping both Dumbledore as the Dark Lord's enemy — after being on the
Growing up at your aunt's house, together with her husband and son, perhaps didn't sound so bad — that was, unless your aunt's name was Petunia Dursley. From the moment Harry'd been brought into her house at Private Drive number four, he'd been despised by the slender, surly woman. She'd given him
have a good story to tell this time. A story worth a field trip, mate!' Ron bolts off his chair with excitement, grabbing his coat and already throwing it over his shoulders.
But Potter had observed his room for quite long enough. Clearing his throat and pointing towards the chairs by his bed, he sat down and made a tea tray appear with a flick of his wand. Potter, of course, thought he wanted to attack him. Like he would ever do that while sitting down, in his room, in his house. Sometimes it surprised Draco that this very man had defeated the Dark Lord; not to mention with Draco's own wand. Where would that wand be now anyway?
'. They had marched towards it with their brooms at hand but had found their own feet turning around again as soon as they had crossed an invisible line. A kind of
,' he said to him. His words snapped Harry out of his enchantment. A nervous little smile appeared on his face as he nodded and basically ran back to his friends.
Turning his back to Harry, Draco tried to focus his mind — tried to find a solution to his current situation. He still felt weak, the pain in his arm and on his back still throbbing furiously. What could he do? What healing did he know to fix this? He'd have to analyze the wound first, analyze what exactly was wrong. As his mind wandered off, he didn't notice time resuming itself at first — until he saw a shadow on the floorboards lightly sway.
Stepping forward and entering the room, Harry drew his wand and pointed it at the boy's back. Furious, he was; a burning fire in human form. And before he knew it, he had casted the spell — a spell that was only to be used against his enemy.
Sneaking downstairs on the tips of his toes, Draco tried to listen carefully to catch a hint of sound that would let him know where his mother was. A ruffling of paper then caught his ears; his mother probably reading the Daily Prophet over some breakfast. Entering the breakfast room with still zero sound, Draco looked at his reading mother; elegantly dressed as usual but with slightly shaking hands. Clearing his throat, he got her attention and made her jump slightly. 'Draco?' Was her reaction as she folded the newspaper and placed it next to her cup of morning tea. 'I wasn't expecting to see you.' Her eyes were a bit red and slightly swollen; as if she had been crying for two whole months -- the two months Draco had been hiding in his bedroom.
His grey eyes had become thunderstorms caught in a heavy rain and Harry's answered with a green look of despise. 'Come on then! I would love to see you try!' The boy shouted at him. He crossed his arms and awaited Draco's next move, one he wouldn't expect. One he would have never wanted.
A meaningless waste of his life, that's what his work has become. Harry peers over the edge of his cubicle, catching a glimpse of red hair and then the look of a bored man. At least his best friend feels the same way about all this paperwork as he does. He sighs and drops himself back down on his chair, lifting his head up towards the ceiling and looking at the ugly, cool lights of the Auror Department.
Draco rolled his eyes and snuck his arms around Harry's middle, his tall figure towering behind him as Harry glanced at their reflection in the mirror. ‘A fine that makes me want to take it off again?' A kiss got pressed in the crook of his neck while Draco's arms wrapped around him even tighter.
Harry can't help but swallow with the subject of his thoughts only at an arm length away. He shakes his head again and wants to look away, yet he finds himself incapable of doing so. Grey eyes are locked in his with more determination than ever. 'You would laugh,' he whispers. Dearly he hopes Malfoy didn't hear it but by the deepening of the blond's frown, he probably did.
'We're nearly done so no, thank you,' uncle Vernon answered before lifting the cardboard box and piling it on top of another.
The locket was pure evil, he then knew — but it was already too late as there was no way it would allow him to take it off again.
Both the boys nodded. 'What will you do to Umbridge now, sir? You won't let her stay, will you?' Harry asked with worried eyes. Even Draco could share that worry and saw Madame Maxime glance in their direction at the mention of the pink devil's name.
wrong. Draco had known it from the moment Harry had appeared in front of them, the Triwizard cup deserted next to him and arms wrapped around Cedric's body. It hadn't been normal, the way Cedric's body hung in Harry's arms like a puppet. The music and the cheering had been loud but still Draco had heard Harry crying, spotted his tears from afar. And he had jumped off his seat, gathered all the energy he had left inside his body. '
Another sound was heard at the bottom of the tower; voices far away and more footsteps — but not very near. Still, it drew Harry's attention away for a few seconds — which was enough for the scene he had been spying on to evolve into catastrophe. A bright green light filled the whole Astronomy tower and Harry could swear he heard someone shout in a muffled way. Blinded and confused by it all, he couldn't help himself from hiding away any longer. His curiosity wanted to come out; see what had happened and know who had died. Because there was only one spell in the entire Wizarding World that blasted off a curse with such a bright color of green; the spell of Death. Avada Kedavra had been casted — but on who?
Tonks chuckled at his words. 'I'm not the queen, but I appreciate the gesture,' she said as she pulled her hand away, stroke Draco's kiss off the top of her hand as if she got infected by something. 'Your presence will stir up a lot of things, though.'
Draco would've cheered at his discovery if he hadn't felt so weak. Now, he laid emotionless and near-lifeless on the cold pebbles, his eyes searching for his wand of which he didn't know the position anymore. It was nowhere to be seen, and he was too weak to perform another spell without one.
'Another plan you've made up to let Wizards rule over Muggles?' Young Dumbledore asked with a roll of his eyes. 'Are you sure we're that superior to them? I mean — they can be quite inventive as well.' He wiped the sleep from his eyes and yawned before sitting down on the edge of his bed.
Normally Draco would always close the door immediately behind him, but this time he had left it open on purpose, giving Harry some time to enter as well. Hoping that the boy had been smart enough to actually enter, Draco closed the door and made his way to Raphael's portrait.
Harry himself was wearing a normal black suit which a Muggle would wear, his hair a mess as usual and his glasses the only accessory the boy would ever need. 'Probably,' he replied, not even looking at the robes Draco held in his hands.
Sitting himself back down, crosslegged onto the floor next to Harry's bed, Draco started drawing circles on the floorboards with his right index finger. "Many Mortals I've guarded before have gotten ill, which resulted in their passing… Once again — it's not
A small room he had never entered before; the walls painted a shade of lilac and a small bed pushed against a crooked window. Photographs of Fleur and Bill on the room's dresser — and one of Draco amidst them as well. Harry immediately hurried himself to that exact photograph; had to see it from up close as if it was Draco himself that was standing there. With his chin held up high as Draco usually did and dressed in Beauxbatons' uniform, he stood beside Fleur and her little sister with great pride. 'Do you have any photographs of him?' Fleur asked, joining Harry and glancing at the photo herself.
'Maybe I'll become a professor at Beauxbatons as well so I can be by your side the entire time,' the boy then said. Visions of Harry teaching classes in terrible French flashed in front of Draco's eyes and he couldn't help but laugh. It would be a terrible idea. 'But let's go to bed shall we? Do you want me to walk you back to the carriage?'
'What's wrong?' Harry immediately asked, taking Draco's hand in his and moving a bit closer to him. 'Why are you crying?'
Draco could feel his cheeks turn pink at the word 'favorite'; something he had known but had never really heard from her very mouth before. 'I'm sure he meant no harm,' Draco replied.
to hear over and over again. How much he had missed his smile, the green of his eyes and that messy hair of his. He dreamt away already while trying to imagine what clothes he would be wearing; worn-off denims and a hoodie three sizes too big, probably. He wiped a strand of silver hair off his own tailored trousers and decided then and there he would take Harry shopping for new clothes that holiday.
Depressing grey furniture and painted walls alike greeted Draco as he entered his room which he had left not even a month ago. He missed going back to his home in France; to the smaller cottage with walls painted in white and colorful flowers surrounding it. The scent of the nearby sea and a beautiful sun shining brightly at noon. Even the rainy days in France were always lovely; the sea a little more reckless and the sounds of its waves reaching all the way to his bedroom window. Simply depressing, were the rainy days in England. Thick drops clattering against his window and a strong wind mimicking the voice of a ghost.
Draco suddenly remembered that Harry was indeed the same age as him; only a month younger actually. But what did the boy mean by enough adventures in the past years? Draco didn't know; he only knew about the tale that made him famous to the Wizarding World. 'I don't know enough about you nor your past to judge on that, but I'll understand your opinion.'
And they weren't even mad about it; they put their arms to their sides, bowed deeply and took off to the castle again. Draco was surprised by such good manners and had often taken regret in sending them away. Only seven Durmstrang boys he found fit enough and therefore he could only please seven of the girls as well — but those whom didn't get a date from Durmstrang quickly found theirs amongst the Hogwarts students.
The large table with the endless amount of chairs have made room for a small, round table with four chairs. A large wooden cabinet covers one of the walls with a pristine collection of china behind its glass. Vases filled with red roses are set in every corner of the room, and wallpaper with extravagant plant patterns greet him from each side — making the large room appear a little smaller, and better suitable for the concept of a tea room. The carpet under his feet seems to be the only thing that has remained, as the baroque themed piece appears marked by the table and chairs that have stood on it before.
Harry sat back down on his chair, moved it a bit closer to Draco's and took one of his pale hands in his. 'I'm sorry for assuming things — I should've known you are different than him. It's kind of the same situation as with the Yule Ball, isn't it? When you also assumed I liked girls and—‘
Still thinking about all those things, Draco had decided to stay in his room until they would go back to Beauxbatons. But the good-hearted girls were worried about his health, about his hunger and Draco couldn't deny the rumbling feeling in his stomach whenever someone mentioned the word 'food'. And so he got dragged to dinner that night, dragged to a place he would be surrounded by people whom despised him. At least, if Harry told them the truth about his father.
A deep sigh followed as Harry tried to take Draco's hand again. 'I didn't mean it like that; just the clothes that you're wearing right now, that's all. Do I get offended so easily when you call me names?'
‘You’re amazing, Sirius!’ Another hug was given before Molly finally pulled Harry away from his godfather.
Harry couldn't help but grin himself, squeezing Draco's hand before letting it slide to his waist; to pull him even closer than he already was. Their noses touched, their breaths flowing into each other. 'I'm glad you here,' he whispered, his eyes closed again. 'I won't ever leave your side again.'
Orlin won't be able to join you,' Fleur suddenly said. She was the only one to not look awestruck by Draco's Yule Ball attire. Draco thought that they’d solved their small argument, but apparently that wasn't the case. Or was it? 'But I heard there are
Granger apparently found out that there was a similar case to Draco's in Bulgaria. A Wizard had suffered from a blackening curse that eventually led up to his death. The curse was caused by a special Mark he had taken from his Master; an ancient ritual that had gone alright for many centuries prior. But somehow it still had gone wrong; probably due to mispronunciation of some of the bonding spells. The exact details were still very vague and the Golden Trio considered visiting Bulgaria together with Draco if they wouldn't find anything helpful on Dolohov's body. Apparently one of the many Weasels lived in Bulgaria amongst dragons, making it easy for them to arrange a future visit. The thought alone left Draco shivering; even though his name meant dragon, it didn't mean he also liked the fire-blowing creatures that much.
Alright, perhaps Harry had only meant the stupid clothes he was wearing right there and then, but that didn't mean he could backfire Draco's own snide comments on his boyfriend's casual wear that easily. '
Draco glanced at the man over his shoulder. He had a content smile on his face as he took over the dance floor with Madame. ‘Well, he seems like
As they reached the carriage, he threw a meaningful glance in what he thought was Harry's direction and opened the door. The common room was packed compared to its deserted state it had been an hour ago. Girls were lounging everywhere; in front of the fireplace, on sofas and against portrait doors. 'Draco! What were you doing outside in that terrible cold?' One of them asked in French.
'Fine — if you're that tired, I'll leave you alone.' The boy stood up with a sulking expression on his face but young Dumbledore grabbed him by the wrist before he could walk away.
'What about his friends? Or those boys from Ravenclaw that made fun of you and Dean, they wear red quite often. Or—‘
"Good morning, mother," he says while sitting down at the opposite end of the table. Pibbly has outdone herself once again, serving way too many dishes for only the two of them.
, in Azkaban. One of his guards recently noticed that there was something wrong with the man's hand; and that's when he asked for an Unspeakable to come and check it out.'
'There's a part of him in it, and we must destroy all seven parts in order to defeat him. Two have already been destroyed, and the third one is currently hidden away in Hermione's purse. That leaves four for us to find, and five to destroy.'
'Is that why you came to the library?' Draco asked, glancing at Harry with a little grin on his face.
A soft cry then was hearable; as if the blond boy had suddenly started crying. Listening carefully, Harry tried to recognize to whom the whispering voice belonged, but it was almost as if a Silencio was cast upon him
Draco frowned his eyebrows at the headmaster's words. 'R-realize a few things?' He stammered, confused. 'That you — that you loved—‘
Potter sent him a few more letters; explaining that he found some clues of where the department of cursed corpses could be found. He and the Weasel were planning on breaking into the department using Potter's good old invisibility cloak as soon as they would find it. Draco could only hope the Ministry's wards were too weak for something as simple as that. But wasn't Potter's cloak one of the best ones in the entire Wizarding World? At least, that's what he said in his letter.
'And who's fault is that?' Snape replied before lowering himself again and lifting Draco's slender figure from the floor. 'He has to come with me.'
Wizards and Witches had shouted vile words at him as he'd left the Ministry that day, his knees wobbly as he'd tried to shield his mother from several wands that had been poking in their shoulders and backs. The green flames of a fireplace had never seemed so far.
Diagon Alley was just as packed as Muggle London; everyone shopping for Christmas sales and dragging their children along the snowy streets. Enchanted snow wandered down upon everyone's heads and for a moment Draco worried wether the invisibility cloak would be exposed that way. A singe shake of Harry's head was enough for Draco to know it wouldn't, and it amazed him how good Harry had become at reading Draco's mind —
Almost immediately Dudley’s chubby fingers curled themselves around its rungs and his heavy figure crawled up at the speed of lightning. “
Harry seemed surprised by Draco's appearance and gave him a questioning look with his emerald eyes. 'Hello, Draco,' he replied, pulling the hood of his hoodie a little straighter.
haunting him and keeping him from his sleep. His mind kept trying to figure out what it could possibly be, running down a list of possibilities as Draco fought with his blanket and punched his pillow. Feeling extremely exhausted by the complete lack of sleep, Draco got out of bed around eight; an hour he thought Harry would be awake at. He dressed himself in some casual clothes as it was Saturday anyway, a simple jumper and trousers would do for the day. The weather was finally starting to get better again and an early spring breeze blew a few strands of hair out of his face. He almost never wore hats anymore when seeing Harry, knowing that the boy loved his long hair so much.
"I have been reading your mind since you were a child, but I understand it might be a little strange to you now. Just know I do
a voice in his head told him. Harry nodded as he kept his eyes locked on his reflection. How much he wished at that moment that is wasn't just a normal mirror but that of Erised; showing him his parents one more time to encourage him. If only their hands could be put upon his shoulder again, whispering loving words into his ears — but the mirror stayed the same, only showing the reflection of a lost boy.
things, and he felt his own hardness grow with every stroke of fingertips that Harry sent over his body.
The sparkle in Fleur's eyes faded away and so did her smile. Draco pushed her hand off his arm and turned his head away once again. He hadn't forgotten how she had talked about Harry or acted towards him. Besides, she could ask any boy from Hogwarts or Durmstrang that she wanted and he would most likely say yes. She simply didn't need Draco and Draco simply didn't need her.
Madame knocked on the wooden door and within a second the face of Hagrid appeared in its opening. A big smile graced his face and he gave Madame's hand another kiss. A giant flower was placed in his fur coat's front pocket and it looked like he had combed his wild hair; it looked slightly different than before. Hagrid invited his Headmistress to follow him towards the Forbidden Forest, and Madame did so after throwing a glance over her shoulder at Draco; a sign that he should follow as well.
, he told himself, and hurriedly ran to his bed to get a pillow and blanket for the boy. But when he turned around again, he had crawled up to his feet, his covered-in-blood back positioned towards Harry. It made him swallow, drop the blanket and clutch the pillow, trying not to feel sick again.
Harry had drawn his wand without realizing, taken a step closer to his cousin and positioned the wood against his throat. Dudley's friends were almost on the ground of laughter, unaware of the existence of Wizards — but Dudley himself turned pale in a second and looked terrified. 'Shut your mouth, Dudley!'
. He glanced over at Hermione and Ron, whom returned his look with worry. They both seemed to know just like Harry did that Draco would recognize him in an instant; deformed or not. Yet Harry couldn't help but feel a certain warmth fill his insides — a dark cloud was slowly drifting away at the knowledge of life.
With frown eyebrows Draco glanced at Harry who shrugged and let go of his hand. 'I'll be back soon; don't do anything stupid without me being able to witness it,' Draco told him; making the boy in red laugh.
Draco couldn't help but swallow as he looked at the strange object, at its silver engravings. Whispers, as if a snake was singing strange melodies.
'Can you please inform me once you find something?' Harry asked the Healer and he nodded in return. The nod was more firm than Harry thought he was capable of but gave him a feeling of promise; the Healer would try his best to help Harry as best as he could.
Harry bit his bottom lip and shook his head. 'About that… I actually already knew about the dragons before you told me.'
?’ Raphael rested his face upon his hand in a curious fashion, the key’s wings still fluttering between his fingers.
get any ideas,” Malfoy scowls at him before Harry even gets the time to think about it. As if he even
Ron didn't know where to look and decided the red carpet underneath his feet was the best choice at that moment. 'W-we were wondering where you were. Thought you'd gone to bed or something.' He scratched his head, messing up his ginger hair in a nervous manner.
Everyone grew quiet again, as they stared at Luna Lovegood standing in the back of the room. Her eyes seemed confused; as if she hadn't said anything at all and was wondering why everyone was looking at her. But of course she had said something, and it had drawn Harry's attention. 'A diadem?'
The book lays opened on his lap, fingers clenched around the delicate pages. At least now Draco knows where all the dents and wrinkles came from. The man's green eyes stare at the page intensely and then lift up to look in Draco's, who quickly hides his tiny smile.
They were one of the last ones to leave the Great Hall, still held into an embrace to keep each other from falling out of exhaustion. 'I think we should go to bed,' Harry finally suggested. He had laid his head to rest upon the blond's shoulder, eyes hazy and tired.
Raising her chin as if Dumbledore had just offended her greatly, Minerva shook her head. 'Of course not. I admire mister Malfoy for wanting to continue his education even if that means going to a different school; we shall welcome him with open arms,' she said.
'It's not your fault. Probably some spell Voldemort hid away in the curse somewhere; reacting to any counter spell cast upon it.'
With a face alike to that of a tomato, Draco couldn't help but look at their feet — golden footsteps circling around Harry's as if waiting to bring him to a room of his own. 'Dumbledore basically saved all of you,' was Draco's reply.
, I guess. And most caring. For creatures that is; always trying to rescue them when others would want to murder them to extinction.'
Hermione nodded, seemed relieved at Harry understanding her theory. 'I've been reading about prophecies for hours now,' she then said, opening the book on her lap again and gesturing at the other two books she had abandoned next to her.'
'You shall play, and you shall play it well,' his Mother and Father always told him. 'Being able to play an instrument is one of the oldest and finest Pureblood traditions there is.'
. He’d flown high — higher than the top of the Manor and almost above the clouds on his first broom. A little boy feeling free; as if he had been the most powerful wizard already, even though he hadn’t even owned a wand yet. But that feeling of freedom had faded fast once he’d got enrolled into Wizarding School. All of the sudden there had been the pressure of responsibility and honor placed upon his shoulders. Father — never proud. Mother — worried about him all the time.
The heavy doors of the Manor get opened by a house-elf with big blue eyes. Harry could swear those eyes were the same color as Ron's, but didn't dare to make a comment about it as his best friend didn't really seem to be in the mood to be compared to Malfoy's house elf.
Harry now is the one to nod. 'Of course,' he replies. They both stand up from their chairs, only then noticing how close they had been to one another while seated. There's only a few inches between their faces; their noses close to touching. It makes Harry blush and Malfoy look away immediately. Harry takes a step aside, away from Malfoy and the chairs and hears Malfoy do the same in the opposite direction. When he looks at the blond again, he notices that he's once again staring at the tea cup Harry gave him. But this time he looks at it with a certain sadness, or was it perhaps a certain… longing?
Remember you can always just stop reading if you're not interested in knowing what Beauxbatons!Draco will be like in the future developments of the Harry Potter series.
'I hope Dumbledore has returned by now,' Draco said with a sigh, glancing at his mother's timepiece.
And indeed, once his feet dragged themselves up the many golden steps of a massive staircase, he was met with the buzzing of at least a hundred voices.
The Slytherin nodded his head with a smirk on his face, his eyes focused on one of the cabinet's handles; slowly bending downwards as if opened from the inside. And that was also the case, as the door opened itself and revealed clouds of black smoke — slowly transfiguring into Bellatrix Lestrange and a few other Death Eaters Draco had hoped to never see.
Looking at Hermione and Ron, they both seemed to be equally confused as him, wondering who dared to come steal things that weren't even theirs to take? 'Who took those things away, Kreacher?' Harry asked, looking back at the elf with a demanding stare.
But he didn’t. Castor stayed on the ground, and seemed to be in a state of shock. Staring at the wall in front of him, his eyes appeared blank. His mind must've exploded, Harry thought to himself. Not only had the boy faced his biggest fear was again — he had lost two of his friends in a situation he had created himself.
'So the Minister has seen him?' Harry then asked. Draco immediately thought about how hard the Minister had tried to hide the Dark Lord's return away as if Dumbledore had gone mad — how all of his plans now had become effortless and a waste of precious time.
'Draco, please. I'm sorry, I-I assumed things and—' Harry began, his voice sounding as if he was crying again. Draco bit his lip, wanting to turn around and face Harry, tell him that it was alright but — but it wasn't.
Putting on big eyes, Draco immediately shook his head. What was Harry thinking? How could he face something again that had given him so much pain — that had nearly taken away something that he loved most in the world. '
Harry sneered at his words. 'So you're saying that if that blond git from Slytherin wears red or gold that he's your friend as well?'
, it was probably him being one of the messiest persons of whole Hogwarts. Dirty socks hung on his headboard, his trunk opened wide with a rumpled pile of clothes within, books scattered everywhere and his wand deserted on a bedside table next to a picture of him and his best friends. 'Let me tidy it up a bit,' Draco said to him before drawing his wand, giving it a flick and making the socks fold themselves together with the clothes, the books pile themselves. Draco clapped his hands and glanced at Harry whom looked at him, utterly shocked.
Hermione nodded, but dark circles around her eyes and chapped lips were saying otherwise. Ron seemed to be the only one to sleep alright in the house, but he always had been one to sleep quite fast and easily no matter when or where. Often Harry could hear his friend snore all the way to his room, waking him up from his nightmares.
, a voice in his head told him. He shook it off as he had more important things to say and do. ‘You’ll have to fight a dragon. I saw them with my own two eyes! They’re hiding them deep inside the Forbidden Forest; spitting fire against trees and under control of a dozen of spells.’
, Harry thought to himself, shaking his head. The books in his bag weighed down upon his thin frame as he swung his bag over his shoulder, and for a moment Harry needed to find his balance again.
His eyes fell upon Arthur Weasley, a ginger-haired father who looked as if beaten to near-dead. He was seated in a wheel-chair, his head wrapped in bandages and his face the color of every existing galaxy. 'W-what happened to you, sir?' Draco stammered, a bit hesitant. Everyone held their breath as they looked from Draco to Arthur, who's colored face now added the color of an explosion; a bright red.
It worried Draco that the pink woman he had seen at the Manor last summer was now Harry's teacher; there was something demon-like radiating from her. He had sensed it the moment she had set foot on the Manor's tiled floors; evil had entered the building. Curious he had sneaked upon his father and this woman in the drawing room, had overheard their conversation and informed Harry. But now he had no idea what she was planning to do; she was too far away for him to reach.
Draco folded Harry's letter again and hid it away in his desk's drawer. With a simple spell the drawer got locked; only opening to the touch of his very hand. He looked over his shoulder, glanced through the window to see the morning sky clear itself from orange sunlight. How much he loved being in his room at Beauxbatons again; at being away from that cold Manor. Everything here was rich and warm, made of gold and white. Blue accents were hidden everywhere; as little flowers on his wardrobe or the tiniest curls decorating his door. At night he could land in a heaven made of silk, stare at a ceiling painted like the night's sky. Hogwarts had been wonderful, but Beauxbatons was just mesmerizing.
A wind blew in Draco's face, sending a cold shiver down his spine. He was wearing the dark robes again, his wand given back to him and tucked into his left sleeve. Harry took out the invisibility cloak from his father, gestured for Ron to come closer to him. 'Alright,' Hermione then announced with a deep sigh. 'Ready?'
'I-I know it's Malfoy, but- there must be something we can do to help him, right?' Harry says to them after the painful silence. He promised Malfoy he would help him; he promised he would care.
For a second it made Draco smile as well — only a faint glimpse — before his mother appeared in the entrance hall with a grim look on her face. He knew that look all to well; a look that showed that something was
It was the 15th of December when Draco couldn't take it any longer and decided to go find Harry. If the green-eyed boy didn't plan to ask Draco, then Draco would have to ask the green-eyed boy instead. It was as simple as that.
. ‘Castor,’ Draco managed to get over his lips. It was more of shock of what they had done to him, then of shock of him being there.
The others followed, and Draco started searching as well. He came across an old golden Malfoy crest he didn't know had ever existed. A moon cycle in silver, an antique piece he knew once hung in the hallway on the second floor of the Manor. An old tapestry he vaguely recognized as well. 'If my father knew about this…' he mumbled to himself at the sight of many other items they all thought had been lost or stolen from the Manor. His thoughts were soon interrupted, though, as the sound of jiggling filled his ears. He immediately turned around to find Ron with his arms full of the same golden dagger — multiplied.
Their second option had been a potion that would make one able to breathe underwater, but gave you the mind of a fish as a side-effect. Harry had tried it out, though; desperate to find something that would be better than a snapping bubble. As he had swallowed the vile potion down his throat, he had felt his normal thoughts slowly drift away. It had been as if he was dreaming; dreaming that he was a fish. All he had been able to think about was water, water and more water. Harry had launched himself into the bathtub and had apparently been swimming in circles for more than an hour; perfectly able to stay underwater without oxygen — but with the mind of a fish he wouldn't be able to succeed in his second task.
Harry nudged him in his side again and lifted himself off the blond, squinting his eyes out of pain once again but not letting it get in the way of hitting Draco fully on his stomach as if the pain was his fault as well. Maybe it kind of was. 'You're unbelievable.'
Biting his teeth, Harry tried to calm his mind, swallowed upcoming words but found himself unable to hold back. "Well, perhaps it's my fault after all — a heavy figure like yourself, should have seen that coming, shouldn't I?" He bit back.
'What about that table?' Draco asked the same Ravenclaw, a girl with blonde hair. He pointed at the table where the boy he had seen before was seated. She giggled at his accent, but Draco ignored it with a steel face — waited patiently for her to answer.
And he was telling the truth; Draco could see that in the boy's ever so green eyes. They had always been like a book, allowing everyone to read any emotion they wanted. Draco pushed Harry's reaching hands away, the silver locks of his hair once again falling beside the boy like a waterfall, and grabbed the boy by his robes. Pulling him forward, closer to him again like he had missed doing so much, he pressed his lips against his and tasted Harry's salty tears mixed with his own. 'I know you still do, Harry,' he said, and Harry smiled hesitantly.
Harry turned himself on his back now, eyes pointed towards the ceiling. "Are you less lonely now that I can see you?" he curiously asked.
couldn't keep the secret; knew that one day her husband would want me to become just like him. She was afraid that if she wouldn't tell me in time, I would blindly follow his orders and become just like him. And I now realize how close I actually was to becoming him without noticing, even though I knew of his past.'
'Scared, Idel?' Draco asked, looking down upon the blond Slytherin with a tiny smirk of himself gracing his face.
A round arena made of stone benches and protective, sparkling spells. Rocks everywhere, surrounding the structure and inside the circle itself; the perfect environment for dragons. Flags and banners with house and school crests fluttered in the wind, catching a soft autumn breeze in their bright colors. A cream colored tent beside it, giving the Champions a place to prepare and a place to rest.
to have written a book about it? Already reading Harry's mind, Hermione shook her head a few times. 'I agree with her, Harry,' Ron then said. 'If Hermione says there can't be a plan, then I wouldn't suggest to make one either.'
'I can't, I still have to visit that new department. You know; the cursed corpses one,' the other man had replied.
He gave the boy one last glance as he stood there, mouth wide open in awe. It made a smirk appear on Draco's face as he turned back towards the girls. As he helped them further down many hallways, he couldn't stop thinking about Harry Potter; the boy who had offered him his cloak because he had thought Draco was cold. There never had been anyone else that had even thought about helping him in such a way. It simply wasn't done. A girl, perhaps, could have been served the same way. He remembered the many rainy days he had encountered during his years at Beauxbatons; girls soaking wet but kept dry underneath their boyfriend's pale blue cloaks. There was a reason why Draco had learned a drying spell by heart; getting soaked and not getting the same attention as most did was simply something he detested.
Before Draco could answer, Arthur opened his mouth again. ‘That doesn’t explain why he’s here; he’s not a member of the Order.’
Voices were raised at his table; all the boys protesting against the matter immediately. They had kept to some sort of quiet at the start, but having such a small chance at visiting another Wizarding School just outraged them all. Draco bit his bottom lip and felt nervous all of the sudden. He really wanted to go to Hogwarts; to support his school and experience things no other boy of his school would experience. Would Madame choose him? What if she chose one of the twins? They were both the perfect candidate; talented
Halfway his walk, the boy spotted a stray cat making its way through the snow with small jumps. As Harry drew closer, it instantly turned around to come running the other way;
Harry had never known he needed someone like Draco in his life, someone to truly love. Even though he had always loved Ron and Hermione, the way he loved Draco was a whole different thing. He could tell the boy everything about his life, about his feelings, about his fears. He had told him everything about Voldemort and his past experiences; about how he was afraid the monster would return. Draco hadn't really commented on any of it, seeming to be afraid of the Dark Wizard without telling Harry why. And Harry hadn't dared to push the subject further.
Harry would forever remain clueless on how an angel’s eyes worked, or what powers they possessed exactly, but within a few seconds Dudley turned around again and went down the ladder in the most peaceful and humane way Harry’d ever seen him do. It was quite a strange sight, but one he could definitely get used to.
'Draco.' Light grey eyes opened themselves, were greeted by a light brighter than expected. It was probably around noon, and he had forgotten he had fallen asleep in the early morning and not at night. Looking to his left, he saw Harry wide awake stare back with vibrant green eyes. Polished emeralds. Sticky strands of hair against the boy's forehead. 'Hello,' he whispered, as if only now realizing Draco was there, next to him.
The students from Durmstrang were one big group of burgundy and were more modest in their cheering, just like the girls from Beauxbatons. They seemed a bit more reserved as they awaited the task's start, looking around with a hawk's eyes and giving Harry glares as if to eliminate him already.
The boys sat in silence for another few minutes before getting out of the bath and dressing themselves again. Fully clothed and hair tucked away beneath his hat, Draco suddenly felt more awkward than he had half-naked. Harry seemed to feel the same way as he couldn’t stop looking at his feet, eyes a bit wider than usual as if he was lost in his thoughts.
the blond was again, now only a forearm away. At the sound of jiggling china he looks down at his tea cup again, noticing that his hands are shaking. Malfoy takes the tea cup out from him, placing it next to his own on the small table. His pale and gloved hand now both find their way to Harry's and hold them still. 'Do I make you
Focussing himself on the boy named Harry Potter again, he thought about the glimpse he had gotten of his lightning bolt scar.
The back of the boy's shirt then slowly turned a crimson red — like spilled ink slowly drenching into paper. It spread fast, making white disappear and Harry's hands shake. A nauseous feeling overwhelmed him instantly; the sight of blood too much to bare. Feeling like throwing up, Harry looked away for just a second before biting his teeth and pushing through. "My God, are you alright?" he somehow managed to get out as he bended through his knees, a shaking hand placing itself on the boy's arm.
As Harry's vision slowly returned, the dark spots of a blinding spell slowly fading away, he looked up into the face of a man whose skin was covered in a striped pattern of blood. He was circling around his prey, glancing from one to the other. 'So… who do we have here?'
Draco's cheeks were probably turning a violent red by now, but at least they would match with Harry's whom had taken the same tomato color.
It seemed as if Draco didn't feel the push either, and his eyes kept focussing themselves on Harry's greens — almost in an obsessive manner. Harry stared back, noticing that Draco's grey eyes weren't the same as they used to be; they appeared darker. It confused him. How could one's eye color change? He wanted to ask wether he was alright, what was going on — but Harry had to keep his mouth shut, or he would risk betraying himself and his friends.
Harry then heard footsteps near, turned his head to the right to see the perfect resemblance of himself storm towards younger Snape, a wand drawn and a smirk on his face. It was his father — accompanied by young Remus and Sirius — making his way to Snape. 'What are you doing here, Snivellus? That's our spot,' his father called out.
He saw harry's eyes search in his; trying to find something — an answer or anything at all — but they couldn't as they appeared a more duller grey than they had ever been before. Draco tried to make himself a bit angry now as well in order to avoid any tears to show up in his eyes; it would only make the situation worse. But that anger only seemed to confuse the boy even more.
A hand was placed upon his shoulder and shortly after soft lips were pressed against his cheek. 'Come on now. I even dressed up in my full uniform especially for you,' Harry said to him, smiling a bit. Draco couldn't help himself but smile weakly as well. 'We could also fly together, if you want? On the same broom, that is.'
, Draco kept reminding himself. And he was right as he saw a raven haired boy walk away from him a bit further down the hallway, clearly in a hurry and trying to avoid someone. Draco sprinted his way towards him, his heart beating fast in his chest as he grabbed Harry by his shoulder and turned him around. Emeralds of confusion and hate looked straight into his eyes. 'Leave me
Dumbledore didn't seem to be changing his mind by Harry's words and kept a straight face as he guided Harry around a street's corner. A street-lantern flickered orange light onto the pavement and a slight mist, of which Harry's didn't know was Dumbledore's doing or just nature, hovered around them. 'Draco is a clever boy, Harry — and very talented as well. He will probably outsmart you any day of the week and defeat you in any duel as well. So for that; you shouldn't worry. Nor should you worry about mister Malfoy, his father. He won't be able to hurt his son — trust me,' Dumbledore told him before he stopped at a house that looked as abandoned as the others.
Deciding on going for the baggy black trousers, Harry pulled out a pastel blue jumper along with it, changed into the chosen items and closed the doors again. Watching his reflection once more in the cracked closet's mirror, Harry let out a deep sigh. The jumper was old and torn; its wool all fizzy. Not to mention it made his hair a completely mess after he pulled it over his head. With raven locks now directed in each possible way, Harry quickly went through it with his hands. To no avail.
It seemed to startle Hermione as she sighed deeply and placed a hand upon her heart. 'Thought you were McLaggen,' she answered in a hushed tone.
‘Because they’re a couple! They’re dating!' was Ron's reaction. He then looked from Draco to Harry and back. 'And you two — you two are not! … Right?’ Ron's eyes had been cleared of all anger in a matter of seconds. A new emotion had come up and showed something that could be described as discovery and a certain worry at the same time. Draco and Harry looked at each other at the boy's words and Draco found Harry looking away, with flushed cheeks.
Green eyes looked up into Draco's again. ‘You care a lot about those girls, don’t you?’ Harry stated with a smile.
Harry swallowed and nodded. Of course he saw Draco, but Draco hadn't seen him. No, Harry had been well hidden away from his eyes underneath his invisibility cloak. And did he even care to tell Draco about that earlier? N
'That's because you care about him, Harry. And that's a good thing, remember? Just — just try to distract yourself a bit,' Hermione suggested. 'Let's talk about something else, shall we? For example the fact that you'll become Quidditch captain this year?'
Harry gave him a weird look, as if Draco had said something absurd. 'Alright!' he then called out, way too loud for Harry's normal doing. He then kissed Draco's hand — something he had never done before — and left the common room. Looking over his shoulder at Hermione and Ron, Draco could see they were just as confused and worried about Harry as he was.
Barely being able to stand because of the terrible pain all over his chest, stomach and back — Draco somehow managed to get out of bed again. How in the world had he been able to bolt upright when going in against his father's words earlier this month? Or when he had tried to open the door? It seemed as if he had become even more wounded since then, and that his sudden lust to fight had weakened.
resurrecting Voldemort again or break into Dumbledore’s grave to steal the Elder Wand like he did, am I right? Don’t get me wrong; the Prophet would
"And who do we have here?" Another sweet voice followed. A woman with long, ginger curls stood waiting just beyond the gates, dressed in a lace white frock. "I'll take it from here, Draco," she told him, giving him a look of compassion with her eyes.
The man took most of his time observing Draco's moon cycle, painted above his bed. It had always been there; at least, as long as he can remember. He asked his Mother about it when he was younger and she told him a great-great-grandfather somewhere in the Malfoy line was quite obsessed with the moon. She pointed out some other rooms in the Manor that held similar paintings of moons in different phases. The attic was apparently the old man's favorite as it had all phases, including blood moons and eclipses displayed on every inch of the walls. Now it was almost all hidden behind old, cursed objects, long forgotten by any Malfoy.
It had all gone greatly, though. The bird had been delivered without Harry following Draco and as Draco had wondered in bed what was going to happen to the bird; the blond Slytherin had slowly taken it away into a secret, hidden room.
With that said, she disappears into her chambers again, leaving Draco alone in the hallway with a hooting owl and a concerned looking house-elf. “Off you go again, Pibbly,” he tells her. The house-elf hesitantly hands over the owl to Draco, who takes it from her with a certain disgust. Yet another reminder of that
The library was empty beside from a fourth year girl with lovely brown curls. She sat bent over an old book and followed the lines of words with her finger as she read them. Draco recognized her as Hermione Granger, one of Harry's best friends. It then struck him that he indeed hadn't seen her at the Gryffindor's table. Perhaps she had some homework she felt like doing during her lunch-break.
Draco had never felt so much like himself before; dressed up to his best, his hair waving behind him in his every move and Harry held close to his chest. It was simply
'Once I peeked through your bedroom's window and saw you writing a letter, and another time I saw you sitting on a swing in a park. I wanted to approach you but whenever I got closer, it felt like something was pulling me away; as if there was a bubble around you that was guarding you.' Harry didn't know what caused that, but he did know that it was a pity he hadn't noticed Draco glancing at him during his boring days. 'But then Dumbledore sent me a letter and—'
Followed by the running students were Viktor Krum he saw earlier, looking straight ahead and ignoring everyone around him. They all stared at him with longing eyes, suddenly aware of having a celebrity in their midst. And of course, Headmaster of Durmstrang Igor Karkarov closed the parade of students. Dressed in white he couldn't stand out more — but wether that was a good thing, Draco didn't know. Rumor had it that he and Madame Maxime couldn't stand each other and therefore Draco also glared at him with stares of pure hate. The man didn't seem to notice though, only kept his eyes straight ahead as Krum had done. Reaching Hogwarts' Headmaster, Dumbledore, he exposed some awfully rotten teeth and embraced him in what could be called an awkward hug.
he thought to himself as he took a deep breath to calm his quickly-beating heart. The sound of more footsteps then suddenly resounded through his ears; and through those of all the others. Seven heads turned towards the stairs to see the exhausted yet smiling faces of Ansel and André appear out of nowhere.
beside from feeling like a spy he also started to feel like an intruder of possible love. But his worries were faded away fast; a rising flame from amidst the trees froze him to the spot. Another flame followed and the shouting of spells and the screaming of men caught his attention. Madame and Hagrid had also stopped a bit further, closer to the flames and shouting. Draco also moved his feet again after taking a few deep breaths and hid behind a tree close to where Madame was standing.
Draco didn't dare to take another glance at the boy as he left the hallway, yet he knew Harry's eyes were following him, staring at him with what was probably unsatisfied hunger mixed with confusion.
Everyone still seemed extremely wary around Draco as they went down for breakfast the next morning. It had been the fist night that Draco had slept for longer than an hour, and his body and mind were thanking him greatly. With his hand locked in Harry's as if to catch up on lost time, they met the curious and doubtful eyes of their friends. Ron looked at him with a strange look in his eyes Draco found hard to decipher while Hermione didn't even dare to look at him at all. Bill seemed to back away a little at the mere sight of him, his hand protectively on Fleur's arm. 'It's alright everyone,' Harry explained, clearing the heavy air and presenting Salazar's locket in the palm of his hand. He hadn't let go of it since the day before; had kept it in his trousers' pocket the entire time.
'The Healer has one more week to run more tests but I wouldn't expect much from it, if I were you. But don't worry, Hermione is looking into things again. I informed her about what we saw and she seemed to have seen some sort of a light, to say. Let's hope she'll find something useful again,' Harry says with a sigh.
What had shocked Draco probably the most was that the Drumstrang boy had known his full name; something he hadn't told anyone from the other schools. It was a detail one could only know if they paid close attention to him; it was written on the bag he always carried and on a few of his notebooks.
Draco stopped, pulling Harry's hand to make him stop as well. 'It is. It's important for us to have each other — to trust each other. Is it that big of a thing?' Raising one of his eyebrows slightly, he watched how Harry sighed deeply and nodded his head.
A clicking sound followed as he remained frozen to the spot, his heart beating in his ears as he knew all too well to whom that voice belonged to. His bedroom door swung open and revealed a tall boy, dressed in blue silk from head to toe with a golden wand at hand. A grey eye glanced at him from underneath a hat and a grin graced his lips especially for Harry to see. 'Draco,' Harry stammered, not quite believing that he was actually there.
'Oh, but I believe you,' Tonks said, pulling up her eyebrows slightly. 'Otherwise you would've led Harry straight to that creepy Manor of yours instead of Grimmauld place.'
'There are many reasons for that, boy… too many to even count on these old fingers.' A silence fell, as all of them seemed to try and figure out what those reasons were exactly; as they had always known their headmaster as a caring person — someone with a good heart. 'But you want to get into Hogwarts, you say? Well, I
had just touched his back. Harry tumbled forward, fell over his own feet and hit the sidewalk. Car brakes, the sound of impact. Trying to ground himself, Harry placed his hands firmly on the street, digging into the freshly fallen snow. Slowly, he then crawled back up and hesitantly turned around, afraid of what he'd see. A feeling of panic raced through his veins, a rush of adrenaline joining as he saw what laid in front of him, on the street, on the spot where he stood just seconds ago.
'Was thinking about it,' Harry mumbled as a reply. They continued their walk to the pier, Harry's stomach growling with nerves. 'What's that in your hands?'
Draco tried to avoid his eyes, looked away, but as Harry grabbed him by both wrists, it was hard not to look at the boy. '
'I'll come back… don't worry,' he tells him. It's something he had to tell Malfoy; to reassure him once again, to not let him lose hope. 'We'll figure this out.'
'I know, Draco, but we're kind of locked in here, aren't we?' Harry replied with frown eyebrows. 'Or do you know a way out?'
Harry grinned and nodded. 'Where to? And why did I have to bring this?' He held up the invisibility cloak to Draco.
Before Draco knew, two arms were wrapped around his body in a tight embrace; Fleur was giving him a hug. That was the second time within one month — a few more hugs and Draco would slowly melt away in a puddle of limited privacy. ‘
They had started to make plans almost immediately after finding the whereabouts of the locket — at least, the person it was with. Of course there was no certainty of Bellatrix and Voldemort being at the manor, or the locket itself all-together, though the three of them knew there was no way around visiting the place anyway. They didn't have any other leads for the remaining horcruxes, and therefore it seemed the best to go with their gut-instinct.
,' Ron told him. 'You're the only way of stopping him.' Harry couldn't help but agree; he was indeed the Chosen One and therefore felt like it was all his fault. Felt like all the burdens of the Wizarding World were his to carry — but was that truly the case? Was he truly alone in this? Dropping his backpack to the grasses underneath his feet, Harry took a deep breath. Maybe Ron was right. 'And were you really going to find those horcruxes all by yourself? Without me; maybe — but without Hermione… you wouldn't survive a day, would you?'
'What I like you in would be nothing at all,' Harry answered, green eyes shining with desire as he pulled Draco closer to him. Layers of clothing were between them but still Draco could feel the beating of his heart transfer to Harry; soak into his body like water and fuel the shine of his emerald eyes.
As other students joined the dance-floor as well, they could exchange their failed waltz to a slow dance of turning in small circles across the dance floor. It gave Draco the opportunity to take in Harry's face more, and of course his body, dressed in stunning green robes. They had a velvet collar, silver details that looked like ivy on the sleeves and Harry wore a simple white button-down underneath them. Topped off with an equally green bow-tie, the boy was a mix of a Wizard and a groom.
Draco thinks. He forgot they had their own owlery here at the Manor's grounds. When he still had his Eagle owl, he would often bring some treats to it before bedtime. Or even sneak out during the night to sit next to it, and just talk. There were many other owls there as well, back in the day — but most of them had died of illness or age, and now only the new owl remained.
Nothing made sense to Draco at that moment, but he stayed calm and composed while he thought things through; tried to figure it out. Meanwhile he sent fog Harry's way through his eyes; the best way to keep a mortal dazed and still. "You can see me?"
'My help? But I already told you everything I know about dragons,' Draco could only say, but Harry shook his head.
In fury Umbridge rose from her seat, her plump self leaning closer to the man. Draco got surprised by it and had to hold a hand to his mouth not to let a gasp escape. 'Watch your words, mister Cuffe — you wouldn't want the Ministry to start involving itself with the Prophet, now would you?'
A soft kiss on a forehead, probably the last. A cough, so loud and painful it made a dozen eyes blink. The lights were dimmed, the curtains closed. In a crescent-shaped line family stood, their gaze upon a ten year old girl in bed. A blue blanket pulled to her chin, her mother by her side. Small, half-closed brown eyes looked around the room; resting their gaze upon each person for a few seconds before skipping to the next. A last look. A last
'Well, there are probably a lot of things he hasn't told you, Harry Potter.' Ron seemed even more shocked at hearing Harry's name roll of the man's tongue; as if there were a dozen other Wizards in this world whom wore a lightning bolt shaped scar on their head. It was obvious that the man knew whom he was, wasn't it? 'It was foolish of you to come here,' Dumbledore continued. 'There are Snatchers everywhere; hunting for the price that's on your head.'
someone. But he now understood and by the watery look in the boy's eyes; the feeling must be returned.
Fleur seemed to be doing well and she had informed Draco that her plan was working out perfectly. Madame Maxime was helping her the best she could, she told him. Draco had just nodded at every word and was happy for her. The disappointment that he couldn't help her had faded away quite fast; he just wanted her to do well and not get scorched to death by the fire-breathing creature.
There was no hiding, they found out as Voldemort's next move was to break all the glass the atrium possessed — all the tiny windows from Ministry workers their offices shattering to pieces and raining down upon all of their heads. Harry looked at Draco whom was staring up at the rain of glass in slight shock — the sharp pieces only a few inches away. He threw himself on top of the boy to protect him, and felt a few shards stab him in the back before Dumbledore stopped them. Grey eyes stared in his with fright, Draco's lips saying
different. And then there's Samael… you might know him as our fallen angel?" Harry nodded, though he had never heard about the name Samael before, but
'It's Harry Potter — you know; the boy from the tales.' Fleur's eyes widened at that and stared Harry up and down as if he was a ghost. 'But not to worry; he is too young to compete against a talented Witch like you.' His words made her smile and face him again. The back of her hand slid across his cheek in a loving gesture; something she only did to him and her little sister. It meant that she was grateful and expressing her love, a delicate move that Draco simply described as Veela.
'It's the only way we can pass,' Draco told her, feeling a stabbing pain go through his own heart as well.
Lucius Malfoy took a glance at Harry's face, but already seemed to be convinced by the Snatcher's words. He opened the gate for them to enter and walked back to his manor, a cane shaped in that of a snake in one hand and the other nervously clenched around the seam of his robes. Why would one be nervous at his own home?
. Hesitantly, Draco took the locket in his hands and immediately felt how dark magic started running through his veins — entered his blood to mess with it. He ignored it with a straight face, as if he hadn't felt anything at all, as he could still feel the dark presence of Voldemort behind his back. With trembling hands and shaking fingers, he hung the locket around his neck — it's heavy weight falling down next to the small medallion he shared with Harry.
day. He simply despised school, to put it into words. Not because of the actual learning part, but because of the people there. They'd always been cruel to him — because he didn't wear the newest clothes or owned the newest gadgets, wore glasses and they simply considered him to be
What an awful plan it had sounded in Draco's ears. Enchanted in a deep sleep but completely safe… as if Draco had been able to believe that. He had sulked while throwing vile glares at each of the irresponsible adults in front of him before demanding five minutes to at least go to the bathroom before they would unwillingly put him asleep. Of course Draco hadn't needed to go to the bathroom; he saw it as his opportunity to tell Harry about the gillyweed. He had only found out about it the night before while reading in his new plant book. Already on one of the first pages he had stumbled upon it and while reading its description, had known it was what they had been looking for all along.
A cheeky little game of telling lies he had had to play to be able to join Harry for the holidays. He had told his parents he would be staying at Beauxbatons; too much homework and special festivities were keeping him there and would make him unable to go home. Madame Maxime, on the other hand, he had told that he would go home; celebrate Christmas with his beloved family before the days were going to turn dark again. She hadn't understood his decision, but had guessed it was for his mother and therefore hadn't asked any further about it.
the cutting spell. He lowered his hand, long locks of silver now clutched in his fist and he stared at them with eyes as large as fish bowls, in disbelief of what he had done.
With those words said, the boy closed his eyes again; too exhausted to continue. But they knew everything they had wanted to know. Voldemort was aware of the destruction of the horcruxes — aware of the destruction of parts of his soul. He was upset, they now knew, and would go protect the ones that were left. And they had to get to them first; they would have to go to Hogwarts.
Was it truly that what he saw in his visions, in his nightmares — or was it something else? Harry had no idea, and his head was already too full to add another theory to it. He had said his good-night to his friends, picked up the few books he had brought down for studying and had gone to bed — to hopefully dream of more peaceful things than brightly shining orbs of glass.
His green eyes find Draco's greys again and this time it's Draco who looks away. Potter is interested in his life? Since when?
Draco bites his bottom lip, grabbing his button-down from the floor and pulling it on again. No need for him to keep sitting there, exposing himself to a helpless Auror that won't be able to help him anyway. An iron tastes spreads throughout his mouth, suddenly realizing that he's biting on his lip way too hard. Hands stop moving from his buttons and he looks back at Potter with tears welling up in his eyes, yet once again.
As that same yellow circle of Death grew and grew, Draco was shaken out of his state by Harry's hand — placed upon his shoulder and asking for his help. He followed the boy downstairs, through the door and onto the grassy grounds. A black figure whom he recognized as Bellatrix Lestrange stood on the other side; glaring at Harry with murderous yet teasing eyes.
Draco finally stopped his pacing, his head a little tilted as he gave Harry a judging look. "What makes you think I've never communicated with one?" His voice held a hint of anger once more, and Harry couldn't deny that it made his heart jump a little — made him feel perhaps a tiny bit scared.
They had left busy London and exchanged it for the quietness with a creepy undertone of Grimmauld Place. Seated around the small table in the kitchen, they held their heads together as they discussed where the real locket of Salazar Slytherin could possibly be. Harry had discovered it had been a fake only days after Dumbledore's death; the message inside clear to any of its readers.
way. It received pets on its ginger-colored fur with delight, and Harry couldn't help but grin just a little. Cats, especially strays, always seemed to be attracted to him — always asked to be petted and loved. It was like that with a lot of other animals too. Dogs happily barked at him or wagged their tails, birds randomly landed on his shoulder or flew close to him, butterflies were quite the same. There really wasn't a reason for it, but it fascinated Harry and made him feel less alone — perhaps
A few months after the war, the curse showed its first sign of spreading — it's first itch. Maybe Draco had even felt it itch right after the Dark Lord had been defeated — Voldemort or Tom Riddle, however one would want to call him. Of course Draco had thought of his arm itching before that time, had thought of it as a gigantic mistake and a regret. But that kind of itching had been something between his ears — something non-physical.
‘I- I’ll try to help you, Malfoy, but I don’t know if I can,' Potter mutters, eyes still fixed on Draco's.
, he thought as he kept staring around him at the deserted landscape of Hogwarts. The sky looked whiter than usual; snow would soon start to fall. Draco tucked his hands away in his coat's pockets, a blue one that was a shade darker than his normal blue attire. He had forgotten his wand as he had left the carriage in such a hurry; making him unable to cast a warming charm. He could cast a wandless one but it had to be refreshed every few minutes in order to keep it working. Just thinking about all the effort made Draco already wince.
It seemed to shut Hermione's mouth but open Ron's instead. 'What love life? She doesn't have a love life with him!' Ron then turned himself to Hermione. 'Right?'
As the alarm was silenced, but the men seemed to get more near — they suddenly heard a creaking sound behind their back. Four heads turned to be greeted by a face whom they had to look at twice; a near-exact resemblance of Dumbledore was standing in a door-opening. 'Quick,' he said, gesturing for them to come in. 'Hide yourselves inside!'
A crowd made itself presence by applauding their hands at the appearance of their first Champion. Diggory had left the tent with a face whiter than Draco's pale complexion as he faced the dragon that was awaiting him on the other side of the tent's canvas. Draco didn't even bother to go look at his performance; he already knew the Hogwarts boy would be smart enough to handle the dragon in some sort of way. Remaining by Fleur's side and encouraging her with sweet words, he knew he wouldn't run into Harry by accident or have the boy talk to him. Of course he also wanted to tell him that he could do it, that he was strong and skilled enough but in front of Fleur and Madame Maxime, it was impossible to do so.
