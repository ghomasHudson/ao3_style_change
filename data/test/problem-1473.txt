“No idea. Bought him from a fella down Knockturn Alley a couple of days ago. He only had the one left, and he looked so lonely. I couldn’t leave him, and I thought you two might like him for your new place.”
“Do you see any,” Harry said. “If this was a town, shouldn’t the Rai stones be the center of the magical signature?”
lost his mind. Or maybe things were just that crazy.
Draco traipsed through the jungle, reveling in the soothing din of rushing water and the cozy intimacy of the close canopy. He had always loved contained spaces, and this was no different. The comforting presence of ferns and leaves reminded him of the reading nook in the Slytherin Common Room.
“No, no, no,” he repeats. “Come on.”
Draco was unaware she had even made a mistake, he was so wrapped up in keeping his game alive. He thought fleetingly that life would be much simpler if all he had to worry about was running from one side of a maze to another.
“Rocks or jungle?” she asked.
Malfoy gasps, and Harry freezes. He drops his wand, hears it clatter to the floor, and curls in on himself with a sob of frustration. His thumbs are vices behind his knees, his head buried in a pillow, and he rocks himself slowly, instinctually. He feels the foot of the bed dip with Malfoy’s weight.
They lost the round regardless. When they lost the next one, too, Draco was relieved. He just wanted it to be over. Jeff dismissed them with a solemn nod and a “got nothing for you,” and, for once, it struck Draco as more smarmy than charming.
When Marie snuggles into Jess’s side, whispering “
“Draco!” Harry greets with a radiant smile and Draco can’t help a rush of warmth from flooding his chest. “No, no, stay! It’s just Ron.”
“... and Draco, I suppose I haven’t gotten to know him yet. He’s close with Isabelle, and that scares me. They’ve got the look of folks that mean business. Those two are a power couple. Oh, no, not like that, although Draco does have this disgusting sexual tension with Harry. They banter like parrots and then ignore each other for hours at a time, but you can always catch one staring at the other. I don’t think either will break, though. There’s a chemistry, but it’s way too, like, unpredictable. I guess weird people attract. They’ll leave this place sure they’re enemies, but then they can get water and work on the fire for hours and hug after challenges like it’s nothing. I swear, those two are some of the most oblivious nerds I’ve ever met,” Jessie, the girl from Mississippi, was saying.
“A witch?” She laughed, cutting him off. “Yeah. I do work for the FBI, but I’m a magical liaison for MACUSA. I was wondering about you. Your hair looked too good.”
“And why might that be?”
“Iz, oh my god, oh my god, are you okay?” he asked hysterically, shaking her. Her eyes were open, but very wide and very still.
Draco snickers, and a high, frustrated flush rises on Harry’s chiseled shoulders and structured cheekbones.
“Welcome to your final Immunity Challenge. Losers, you may be the last player voted off Survivor Wa’ab. Winner, you are guaranteed a place in the Final Three and a chance to plead your case to the Jury,” Jeff greeted. “This challenge is complex, so listen closely. To begin, you will climb to the top of your platform where you will configure a set of gears to lift a pulley. This pulley will raise and lower a bucket from the bottom of the structure. There are many ways to configure the gears, but some will be more favorable than others.
Three members of the opposite tribe had also pulled green, and Draco assessed the young woman and two middle-aged men shrewdly as they shuffled to stand shoulder to shoulder. The girl was the Mississippi-beauty-queen he had deemed spoiled and vapid on first impression, but she smiled brightly at Draco, and he grinned right back. The elder of the men stood protectively at her shoulder, holding himself with a gentle sturdiness, thick salt-and-pepper stubble tickling his kind expression.
to look sexy, to feel sexy, and to do it right, and he had intended so for nine bloody months. Harry thinks a lot of things look good on Draco, but empowerment is one of his favourites.
From there the strange happenings only got worse. On Sunday, Harry returned from the gym to a cloud of green floo powder, the entire pot having been tipped at the foot of the mantle. On Tuesday, the mail arrived shredded. On Wednesday, they received a Howler from the post office stating that no abuse of Ministry owls was to be tolerated and that they would be receiving a hefty bill to cover the vet bills and feather-regrowth potion. Harry was horrified, but when he ran to make a care package for the injured owl, he found his owl-treat stash overturned down the toilet.
“Potter, your obnoxious, possessive antics are going to get us voted out. How people haven’t gotten sick of us dancing around each other, I do not know,” Draco said.
“Draco. Draco!” he heard Harry say. “Are you okay?”
Draco was good at focusing. He was good at compartmentalizing. On command, he could block everything out except for what was directly in front of him. His peripheral would darken, colours would dull, shapes would sharpen, and any noise not worth hearing would reduce to a steady hum. The trick to the challenge was to establish a rhythm, and Draco was looking forward to giving it his best shot.
“Thanks Jessie,” he responded kindly. “You bring up some good points. I’ll think about it.”
Harry glowered. “Masochist.”
Yours,
“Is it not what we’ve been doing all along?”
“Yes, we’d better,” Harry said, turning to look at Draco again. “Or we’ll be in trouble with Minerva again.”
Draco, though, was also sad to see the camp go. He had grown rather soft in his ripe age, and he hated divisive endings. It came from the fact that he, after so many years, could finally say he was blissfully, disgustingly, sustainably happy.
Potter lands so close to him that Draco is pulled down with his weight, just enough that he feels water close over his head. Potter kicks wildly towards the surface, and Draco ends up pressed against him, chest to chest.
Most of his thinking power, however, was spent attempting to orchestrate his alliance. Lonnie naively offered to talk to Tara, and Draco was happy to let him take one for the team. When Harry had started to warn him that maybe he was in over his head, Draco had kicked him from across the hammock.

“It’s beautiful,” Malfoy says.
him?”
2) It broke my heart to read you talking about “leeching off” your family. I may not always have thought well of the Weasleys and of Ms. Granger, but I know very well that they take good care of their own and that they love you as if you had been born into their family.
“Always so sentimental. One would think you had a childhood trauma,” Draco teased, petting his husband’s jaw once more before retreating.
“What do you mean? Has something happened to Ichabod?” Draco exclaimed, voice full of worry as he took a step forward.
. “Courtesy of my Great Uncle Algie,” he announces. The thing is hideous-- a lumpy, writhing mound of scaly stalks and pointy leaves coated in brown fur.
They play strip checkers. They kiss. They do things that feel an awful lot like
He scaled the staircase on shaky legs, breathing hard already despite the adrenaline. He pushed on, fully in fight or flight.
He’s not prepared for it when Hagrid finds him in the garden. “Harry, my boy!” Hagrid declares. Harry winces when a slap lands on his back. “Come back to my hut. Jus’ like e’ old times.”
They’d only been there for half an hour when Pansy had given an indignant shriek and told them to get out. Harry couldn’t blame her. From the moment they stepped through the door, it was chaos. The door had slammed shut behind them without being touched, and nothing would get it to open again, then the tin in which Pansy kept her Floo powder had mysteriously toppled off the mantelpiece and smashed open, spilling the powder everywhere. To top it off, one of Pansy’s beloved scatter cushions had burst open.
As it turned out, Lonnie really was lovely. Draco had already known he was lovely, but he surpassed even the highest of expectations. He was attentive when Draco spoke, but could light up the sky when he told a story of his own. Draco felt warm and cared for and
There’s a buzzing in his ears that is strange and soothing. The longer he sits the more it drowns out the pounding of blood in his veins. Picking up a handful of soil from beside his shoe, he smiles faintly as it cascades from his palm and down either side of a root; an hourglass, or perhaps a mall fountain. He doesn’t need to dig to know what’s buried underneath. Instead, he examines the dirt lodged behind his fingernails.
“How did you get up into that mantle so easy?” Harry asks. “I had to try to bolt-hole the wall.”
Harry
Neville repeats incredulously.
“Third person voted out of Survivor Wa’ab… Doug. Now that the votes are read, the decision is final. It’s time to bring me your torch. The tribe has spoken.”
That Jonas seems to have been just such a prick as Geoffrey. (His opinions were just as antiquated as his name - looking back, I dated him thinking that I didn’t deserve anyone better.) Guess we all have our bad ex stories, and with my experiences with that type of bloke, I can’t imagine that you were the problem.
“I’m not letting go, Malfoy,” Harry called.
They parted with a kiss.
Harry skips dinner in the Great Hall. It would have been uncomfortably intimate-- not many people are here. After all, it is only June. For most, it is too soon after the war to be returning to the castle. For others, it is far too late. The few professors and alums who have come to rebuild the rubble are the ones who are stuck in Purgatory.
“A cave?” Harry exclaimed, looking at Draco with wide eyes. “Something he can use as
“The seeds have been sewn,” Draco muttered.
He lands heavily in the foyer of his London townhouse and suppresses a rolling wave of nausea, tossing his book bag and coat on the couch and striding towards the door. He swings it open with a thought, eyes roving across the porch. “Neville?” he calls.
It had a sort of mandala etched into its mahogany surface, and Draco traced it with his thumb. “Dream come fucking true,” he murmured. He had the urge to look straight into the sun, pump his fists, and scream.
The song ends, and the noise of the club comes crashing back all at once. A woman whoops from the front row, and the dancers disappear into the wings. Harry is flushed, head to toe, and desperately, desperately hard.
“I don’t think so.”
“Ron,” Harry cut him off. “The kids are 5. Or 9. Or 2. They don’t care. They just like watching Ms. Trunchbull get socked with tomatoes and chalkboard erasers.”
The coin vibrates from within his trouser pocket, and he leaps to his feet. “Wait here for just a moment,” he says, and pushes open the screen door with a whoosh.
“I agree,” Lindsay said. “I don’t like how he treated Isabelle in the challenge, and he’s been so anal about chores. It’s like he thinks we all need someone to take care of us.”
He’s not sure when they started kissing, but now they’re both deep into it. Hands are under clothes and Draco’s tongue is in Harry’s mouth and it’s bliss.
Harry limped to his side. “Draco, are you okay? Dammit, why’d you have to hurt yourself?” He massaged Draco’s arms and shins with gentle hands, still trembling from the Challenge.
Jessie stepped up, the penultimate to speak, standing in fresh makeup and a sundress with her hands clasped behind her back. “Claire, you decided to vote for Harry last night, despite the fact that you knew Draco was voting for me and it would force a tie. Why did you do this?”
Draco smiled as he put his wand down and replaced the lid of the tank. “There. I think he looks happy too. Should we head back to the school then? It’s almost dinner time.”
“Fine, do the spells,” Draco said, more sharply than he meant to, and Harry’s forehead knit.
On his 19th birthday, Draco Malfoy decides to visit every documented Ward Desert in the world.
I have always wanted your attention. At Hogwarts I would pick fights with you because I couldn’t interpret my feelings. You know that I was a prat raised to believe he would get everything on a silver platter just because his name was Malfoy.
Ron scowled. “To be fair, I like those parts too.”
Just as soon as it starts, the rain stops, and Draco collapses, magically, physically, and emotionally drained. The charm dissipates with a snap and the final few drops of the storm hit him in the back of the neck.
I can’t help but read into your disclosure of your history with depression and self-harm. If you ever want to talk about it, let me know. Everyone’s experience is a little different, but I know what it’s like to feel a prisoner in one’s history, one’s regret, one’s life. Perhaps someday we can compare scars or some shit. I will try not to talk about myself or my own experiences too much. When I’m not being an ego-maniac, I’ve been told I give good consolations-- and good hugs. I will just say this: I have met death, and the two of you would absolutely not get along. You are far too vibrant and witty. He’d fear the fact that you could see right through him.
“Oh. Well, I can join you,” she said.
A crunch of boots on glass is what gives Malfoy away. He is stooped at the foot of a crumbling arcade, wand in hand, breathing fast and laboured but eerily quiet.
“Always,” Draco babbled. “Everything is spiked. Everything makes me love you.” He gripped Harry’s hips with bruising force, biting along his neck.
“On accident. I’m a Niffler, prone to picking up shiny things. I didn’t know what it was. I’m still not sure I do.”
Harry craned his neck, pushing Draco away. “Waoh waoh waoh. Draco, people are watching.”
Oblivious to Ron’s tomfoolery, Harry grins. “I thought you were savouring your last week with a bachelor pad?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “We need to try something else. I don’t think the reaction was within the Rai stone-- the residue in the air is too strong. None of the Rai stone magic we’ve seen has left a trace. I think something has been placed to corrupt it. Can you break through curse walls?”
Please use this owl for all further communication with me. She will roost in the ministry owlery until Sunday, the 18th of this month. My home address will not be disclosed until after we have discussed my treatment. There is a reason I have maintained very little contact with the public in the six years since the War, and I would prefer to keep it that way.
feel good. Sometimes they even expect you to know without them doing so much as telling you (and punish you if you don't?). Don’t let some idiot ruin your self-confidence. From my experience, good sex is a matter of communication, consent, and learning what makes the other one feel good.
When Harry breaks the silence, it is just as fitting, just as seamless. “It lost something, too. Just like us. I think it’s grieving.”
The room erupted into whispers. “Will there be a tie?” Harry hissed.
They lined up on the rug seriously, eying where their prizes lay strewn about the length of the ship’s deck. When Jeff raised his arm and bellowed his signature “Survivors, on your marks, and… go!” the set exploded with a flurry of action. Draco took off, b-lining for a stack of green tarps tied 10 feet up a rope ladder near the central mast. He sprinted for it, dodging a pudgy middle-aged man in a snapback and two women who were already engaged in a shoving match.
When he saw it, he knew. The ghostly white trunk of a broken tree ducked headfirst into the surface of the creek, dozens of shelf fungi and vines circling its girth. At the base, a beautiful, broad mango tree rose above the canopy, wide green leaves glossy under the sun. The tree appeared to have once been a single specimen, with two sister trunks growing from a striking Y, but one had succumbed to the pull of gravity and fallen, while the other still stood proud.
Draco keeps it measured and intense for as long as he can. He can feel every twitch, every pull, every moment of delicious friction and heat and compression. “Beautiful,” he breathes. “Perfect.”
Harry shakes his head. “I want to feel it.”
“How’d you get them to let you off without prison?” Harry asks. He assumes the rebuilding effort is a parole-- he can’t imagine why anyone else would come by choice.
Harry pecked Draco on the lips before pulling a peanut-sized tome from his wand harness. Draco took it from him, returning it to normal size and flipping through its doggy-eared pages.
Harry paces through the 7th floor corridor, down and back again, down and back. Malfoy watches. Harry imagines laughing until his stomach cramps and his face turns blue. He imagines his eyes squinty with insistent, jubilant tears, his mind high and floaty and unencumbered. He imagines the black lake at night, and a stag running across it. He imagines a warm body beside him. With a puff of multicolored smoke, a creamsicle-orange door appears in the empty baroque wallpaper, giving the illusion that it was always there, and that Harry had simply chosen not to see it.
Day 19
They worked exceptionally well together. Draco only walked balls-first into a fence-post one time.
Her forehead shot up. “Really?”
“Dance class? Really, Draco, aren’t we a little old for that?” Harry had said.
4) I, and my own owl, Artemisia, would like Desdemona to visit us tomorrow, when the dittany has done its work to pick up a protective leg ring that I made for her according to an old Black family owl-keeping instruction. Don’t give her a letter to carry. If your magic is always eager to get the letters to me, we have to make it easier for Desdemona.
Day 6
“You’re so graceful!” Harry huffs. “When I climb slab I feel like a fucking beached baluga whale. I don’t get it. This is supposed to be the hard part of climbing! You hardly ever even come to the gym!”
He blinked in alarmed discombobulation, kicking away the covers with frantic lack of finesse and flipping over. Draco beside him was still and peaceful. Harry summoned his wand from the bedside table. A
Desire flooded his body. Maybe it was the stress and starvation, his biological clock having been convinced that death was imminent and procreation therefore necessary. Or maybe Harry really was just that pretty. Draco pounced.
Draco did not bother gracing him with a retort, just shuddered and leaned in for a hungry kiss.
Day 29
Along the fence, Harry has planted hostas and camellias and one tall, prized mock orange. Wisteria climbs the gnarled limbs of a lilac, and it’s an explosion of periwinkle and violet. Cornflowers and rose campion bloom untamed, popping up beneath the dwarf cedar and in the edges of pathways.
His feet carry him from groves of ash and birch to thick bracken and finally to pine. The clearing opens up in front of him before he can know to stop it.
“Thought I’d let you name him,” Hagrid grinned as he opened the door to leave. “He’s yours now.”
thought it was worth it, because he lost the challenge without bothering to check with his tribe.
. I—what happened to summer of love? I thought we were leaving this all behind? Why did you have to dredge it up? We had a good thing going. Why did you have to make it real?”
Potter reached for him, murmured something unintelligible, but Draco backed out of the shelter and into the clearing. Face still burning, he went in search of firewood. It was a sloppy attempt to cover his embarrassment, but he figured he would earn points in the tribe by making himself useful. When he returned to camp, arms laden with branches to sort into his neat piles of tinder, kindling, and logs, Isabelle, Harry, and Doug, the massive man that was supposedly a star boxer, were awake and sitting on the sand.
“Oh, surely not,” Hagrid said, turning to look at them properly. “How could he not be happy with you two?”
Draco shook his head and reached into the tank, gently lifting the toad out with one hand and placing him onto his free arm where he sat perfectly still. “See!”
“It probably just fell and broke,” Draco said.
“One Eyed Witch!” he says with a wink, and Harry already regrets showing him the Marauder’s Map of hidden passageways.
Draco’s steps are quick and precise, just as they always are (and that in itself is enough to make Harry swoon), but they are also flowing and sultry. When he drops to the ground, throws his arms above his head, Harry swallows hard, his body reacting to the display of flexibility. He catches sight of the tattoo on Draco’s ribs-- the one that says
Yes, I wrote that I was grateful to you, but, in my experience, gratitude is a common feeling among friends and family. I’m also grateful to Pansy because, when I was in the worst of my depression, she didn’t leave my side for days, thus keeping me from self-harming and for making sure I took my antidepressant potions.
“Mmm. How did you find it?” Harry asks, gesturing to the upset earth with his heel. He’s in the mood for non-sequiturs.
Draco grins. He is head-over-heels stupid in love. He has never been more in love, and it’s silly and sappy and filthy, but it’s them.
Malfoy laughs bitterly. “Yes, I can’t think of any better way to repent. A fucking drink, really? Do you also want me to pick up garbage on the highway? That’ll really turn me around.”
“Oh. Sorry, sorry!” Draco apologized, vehemently begging forgiveness. “You looked okay, and I’m just so focussed. Merlin, are you--”
There would be no more Immunities, no more Idols, no more devil-in-disguise Rewards, no more niceties or passive aggression. This was it; whoever won this challenge would be going to the final.
They had stepped only yards into the cave when Harry’s skin began to glow golden in the heavy shade. “My magic--” he said, “--pulling out of me, then back in.” He struggled to continue, pupils hazy and then rolling back in his head.
it seems to me I have to write two letters to you, one about healing your magic, and the other about you and me. I write them on a single paper, one on each side. A charm ensures that this introduction appears on the side you read first, no matter which one it is. With you, I can’t limit things to the professional, and my feelings refuse to wait in line to be written into the lower part of the letter. I can only flip the paper over again and again to give you concise answers about your magical and mental health and put the things I feel in one place.
They round a corner, and Malfoy careens towards him, Harry’s arms held out to catch him before his brain can catch up. Malfoy lands heavy across his shoulder, and they tumble to the ground, Harry breaking the fall as they roll over and over. Gasps of “sorry” and “are you okay” are lost to the feeling of skin against skin against marble.
His team cheered, and Draco couldn’t help a genuine grin from spreading across his face. He didn’t even care when Potter offered to help him up, just took the man’s hand in his own and stood to face the tribe. He had always been a little bit too competitive.
I need help, badly. I can only assume that my issues stem from deep-set trauma that occurred in the placement, hosting, and removal of Tom Riddle’s Horcrux on my soul, but I am long past the point of believing I could search for answers on my own. I cannot sleep, as I lose total authority over my magical impulses when I do. I cannot eat, because there is a constant buzzing inside of me that would make even the most seasoned of pirates queasy. Even when I do manage to rest or keep down food, magic strips any sliver of vitality I have managed to regain. My mental state and emotional well-being have suffered as well, although I do not know if that is a direct symptom of my magic
“WHY WOULD I KNOW,” Draco replied, wincing as his hearing began to return and his loud voice echoed harshly.
By the time they got back to camp, Draco felt like the bonfire had been burning his emotional stamina rather than oxygen. The Survivor drama had started, and now it couldn’t be stopped.
By late afternoon, Draco’s teeth were smooth and clean, and his throat free of exoskeletons, bitter grit, and crawly things, and the sun was custard-yellow and warm. He had a constant peeling sun-burn going, but he was growing fond of the pleasant, sleepy feeling of being baked. It helped soothe his aching muscles and distract from the ever-present hunger.
“Just don’t step on him,” Draco said nervously. “He’s only small.”
“Maybe the house got rid of it. We don’t know the habits of the magic yet – maybe it vanishes anything it deems dangerous.” Harry had never heard anything of the sort. He crossed his arms.
“Draco, I don’t even know what this thing is!” Harry exclaimed, holding the tank up to eye level and peering in again. “Do you?”
“Gin,” Harry says, “neat.” When Malfoy says nothing, he adds, “
“I thought you didn’t want me around! I was giving you privacy to pretend we weren’t a couple! Like you said on the first morning!”
Harry chokes on a moan, and Draco yanks him flush, chest to chest. The desperate groping of his hand tangles in the corset’s intricate lacing in the same moment Draco’s teeth close over his pulsepoint, and he just about comes. Every sensation is heightened; blood and trumpet and keyboard rush in his ears. Draco’s skin is hot-- so hot-- but the ribbons on his back are cool to the touch.
“Children,” Harry says. “Childhoods.”
Mr. Potter,
Draco watched frozen as Isabelle started to fall, springing into action only when the trajectory of her head threatened to intersect with a sharp outcropping.
I, too, like the charm you gave charm. It has allowed me a few hours of catastrophe-free sleep without the strain of keeping my magic manually contained. I rather think the colour clashes against my skin, but I’ll have to ask Ginny or Charlie; design has never been my forte. Perhaps you would have some input. Your robes last night looked damn well-tailored.
“You just need to go fast,” he said, beckoning Draco to follow.
“That’s what we’re here for, Hagrid,” Harry replied, nudging Draco slightly. They stepped into the cottage. “We’ve brought Ichabod with us.”
They end up in the kitchens, and Harry kisses Winky on the ear while Draco begs her for pudding. He should have known that pudding would end up smeared across his naked chest in the Slytherin Common Room.
Harry, love,
he continued.
Harry
Harry sprinted forward, and Draco and Jessie trailed at a jog. Claire was last to the top of her staircase.
“It’s seemed so flat and empty lately,” he continues.
“It’s a game. You’ll still be friends after.”
He gave Harry a healthy serving of eggy fried rice and sausage, hoping to dilute his blood alcohol. It did not work, and, hence, he had to pry Harry off his lap a total of six times (the same amount of times the Steelers had won the Super Bowl, incidentally).
Continuing his customary commentary, Jeff’s jaw hung open in awe. “There’s a lot of tension around here. It almost seems flirtatious. Frankly, I don’t know what I’m listening in on.” He addressed the seated row of other contestants, “Do you?”
“I was just going to get water,” Harry said. “Would you like to come with?”
Muggles would call the way your brain works ADHD. Wix usually refer to someone with ADHD as Kinetomagical. Wizarding scientists have only examined it in relation to magical activities that require meditation or concentrating over a longer time. The Muggle approach to studying it is more profound.
that smell? Are you sure you even know how to drive it? Are you sure it even drives at all?”
“That’s another thing I was wrong about,” he adds.
Kristen sneaks a glance inside the booth, nodding in enthusiasm. “I can’t wait to tell my art theory professor about this!” she says. “Using people as a canvas-- how novel. It really delves deep into our personal connection with our mediums and the humanity within abstractism.”
Jeff called Draco up last, and he readied himself, letting his mind clear and his nerves quell as anticipation turned to concentration.
Jeff lined them up, and with a “Survivor's on your marks… go!” the game was on.
With the sun high in the sky once again, he didn’t have the energy to talk about Harry. Turning back to Isabelle, he changed the subject; “There’s probably a new Idol hidden since we flushed one last night. I think we should look.”
“Minimart it is. Whadd’ya want?”
“I’ll race you!” Malfoy shouts over his shoulder, already a step ahead.
The pail was empty, but he had to tug it up the elevator regardless. A single drop plopped into the plastic pail beside him.
“I hope you are prepared because your first Challenge will begin right now--” there was a collective gasp-- “before either tribe has had the opportunity to introduce themselves. Stashed around this schooner are items you will need at your camps. Working as a team, you will race to collect as many items as possible and place them on your tribe mat. Tribes may steal from each other, so you will need to designate guards to protect what you have collected. The challenge will run for 2 minutes, after which you may bring whatever is on your mat back to camp with you. Take a moment to talk strategy, and then we will begin.”
Draco catches up to Harry in the far back of the nursery. He’s whistling as he scoops mulch and fertilizer from towering piles into sacks, every few seconds stopping to inspect a leaf or branch of one of the many items in his dolley.
Everybody respects you. You should see how Lindsay looks at you. She’s a superfan, and she thinks you are, like, the ultimate role model. It’s adorable because you’re nothing alike. The challenge yesterday was just a fluke. We won, so it’s all forgiven and forgotten. No one noticed. Look at me; you are incredible, and I love you more every day.”
His fingers trail upwards to the base of the corset at the center of his spine.
“I used to sit here and read,” Malfoy murmurs, “and the fairies would whisper, just too quiet for me to make out, and I would think
Draco sidled up beside Jones, hoping to speak with him but careful to not ask outright. When Jones got paranoid and erratic, he also got controlling.
other’s weakness, but the exception often proves the rule, and this was evident in the dedicated way people tried to ignore him.
Malfoy, the truth is that I am desperate. I am desperate, and you are brilliant. I do not assume that you could fix me, nor that you would want to, but I do believe there is possibility for a symbiotic relationship. I can finally begin to move forward, to make an attempt at clawing myself out from this hole I have dug, and you can study the shell casing of what once was the greatest feat in magical dark-arts history.
“Castaways,” Jeff began as he sauntered into view from behind the captain’s wheel, “Welcome to the 25th season of Survivor. You have been divided into two tribes, Ngael and  Nge’k. Ngael, you represent the West Coast, and your color will be turquoise. Nge’k you are from the East, and your color will be orange. Over the next 39 days, you will compete in a gruelling game to Outwit, Outlast, and Outplay your opponents to prove yourself as the Sole Survivor. In a moment, we will get started with our first Reward Challenge of the season, but first, let’s hear a little from our players; Harry, would you like to speak about what the game of Survivor means to you?”
She frowns, lips pressed tight. “I’m afraid that’s not possible. You must know we’re booked out pretty far.”
“No, your mind is supposed to be on the

“Thanks, Hagrid. We’ll let you know how… does he have a name?”
Please shower our wonderful creators with kudos and comments if you liked their work. Thank you!
“We’ve had quite a lot of strange things happen over the last few weeks,” Draco added, putting the tank down on Hagrid’s kitchen table. “Things being broken around the house, not to mention being broken in other people’s houses or my office here. Harry ending up in the hospital was the final straw.”
“Fine,” Draco hissed, struggling to cover up his bitterness.
Draco,
Malfoy laughs. “Which one would you rather hear?”
Malfoy sighs deep in his chest. The sharp points of his shoulders deflate from the shape of a boy to the shape of bones. “I get it.”
“I don’t know, Potter. We’re meant to research ones that haven’t been heavily trafficked.” He pressed his lips together on the first syllable of ‘Potter,’ pronouncing it with a traditional Malfoy sneer.
By the time they roll into the gravel lot for
He tries to sit up, but Harry catches him as he turns to his back in a show of martial-arts agility that has Draco cursing how he could have ever teased this man for being clumsy or oafish or anything less than perfect.
“Oh, thank Merlin. Harry, you’re in the hospital,” Draco said, his voice full of relief. “The Healers will be pleased you’ve woken up.”
Despite his flippancy, Draco would be lying if he said he wasn’t scared out of his mind. All was quiet for several minutes as Draco lost himself in his head.
“Why is it that color!” Jason shouts.
Perched on a knot, he dug through the soggy bracken that had collected in the rotted out hollow, shaking termites and leaf mould from his hands in disgust. He moved to the side of the live section of the tree, marveling at the way it had repaired itself and grown bark where the fallen branch had left a gaping hole. Noticing a strange cavity, he dug further, pulling out a heavy parcel wrapped in canvas.
Anyhow, I like plying you with sweets. Besides, it’s easier for me to eat when I’m distracted. I’m still all sinew and nausea these days. (If I ever get better though, you ought to give me a guest pass for whichever gym you use. That place does wonders.)
Draco listened, entranced. He was surrounded by people in Britain whose life stories were all identical. Everyone had been through hell, but everyone had been through the same hell, and the exceptions were public knowledge. It had never occurred to Draco just how varied the world really was.
Harry catches his eyes with an exasperated smirk. “Sure thing. The kitchen’s sort of inaccessible though-- I’m in the process of soaking my bulbs. They’re all over the counter.”
“Draco dips in with one digit, and then two, opening him up with efficient precision, but indulging in rhythmic pumps against Harry’s prostate. “Yes. God, yes. Merlin.”
Finished, Draco looked around.
Pansy was late, as usual. She burst through the Floo, her daughter Ellie clinging to her hand and Blaise’s son Jake running circles around his godmother. “Come to drop off the litter!” she announced.
There, in the middle of the narrow glade, sat atop gnarled roots and dropped needles, sits Malfoy. He is motionless, attention glued to his palm. The other hand is held out and aloft, clinging to nothing. Suddenly, it all clicks in Harry’s brain.
They’d been in their cottage for a week now, and most of their friends had been over to see it. It was too small for a party, something which they were both glad of.
They were on vacation, or, as Harry would say, they were
You wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise last night, so I figured it would be best to write.
Draco closed his eyes, fighting waves of fear and guilt. “Is this too much for you? Do we need to go home? I’m so sorry. I should have known. And you were doing so well...”
, Harry. Also, there aren’t any resorts close enough to the stones for apparition. This was the most viable option. You heard Hermione.”
Harry laughs. “Do we really speak in metaphors, or do I just hear it that way in my head?”
Claire listened with intent neutrality. “I believed that keeping the alliance together was the best for everyone's game. As we had the majority, I felt introducing more instability would only decrease all of our odds, so I focussed my energy on maintaining what we already had.”
For one, he’s got a scholarship riding on his 3.0. For another, Parker Parnassus, the pompous ass, broke the curve on the last physics exam, and damn him if he thinks Harry’s going to let it happen again. Not for the first time, he wishes he
“Ugh, don’t even get me started. How is that a
“Out out out!” Draco warned, shoving Harry back into the daylight. Harry gasped, running his hands over his limbs and sobbing in relief when he found himself whole.
“Good,” Harry said. “I’ll do the plants now. We can check with Hagrid later if there’s anything we shouldn’t put in.”
Upon return, the tribe had spiraled into pandemonium. The fire burned a little too brightly, and Draco sensed the buzz of Harry’s magic in the flying sparks. He looked ready to explode. Jones and Isabelle were caught in a heated argument, a purple blush rising on her cheeks, and Jones’s brittle retorts were punctuated with an ugly, toothy grin.
our spear? I’m fucking sick of it!”
They run to the minimart, wheezing from smoke and thrill. They run home, too, until Draco pushes Harry into the fountain. After that, they sprint. They make it out of the muggy fall night and into their dorm, sweaty and free, and Harry yanks his shirt over his head.
to like starfruit here,” he explained with considerable sass.
“Hold on,” he hears Harry say from the other end.
In order to uphold the Statute of Secrecy in the presence of muggles at both my job and university, I began to rely on potions to mask my magical activity so that it was more difficult for others to detect. When my control over my magical impulses began to rapidly decline, I regularly abused the potion, intentionally overdosing so that I myself could no longer connect to my magic either. This was a short-term solution to keep up with my heavy workload but ultimately resulted in me being forced by my friends, family, and professors to take an indefinite leave of absence.
Draco clasped their hands together, spinning Harry slowly to imaginary music. They waltzed to the melody of waking birds, and when Harry set his chin on his shoulder, Draco whisked them away and back to camp.
’. The surface of the Black Lake is still, the only movement a cascade of ripples timed to the cadence of their steps echoing through the cool, dark water.
“Mmm. I thought we were meant to be working?” Draco muttered.
“So good.” Draco whispers. If his voice cracks, he doesn’t care. “So good for me. Look at you. God, look at you.” Harry’s incessant moans sharpen, the tips of his teeth brilliant against the pink of his lips, the gold of his skin. His hair has escaped it’s tie altogether, framing the sharp lines of his face in a messy, feathered halo.
“In that case, are you good to Apparate?” Malfoy is smirking, but it’s a façade. Harry can’t tell if he's fighting giggles or nerves or both.
“Jeff, darling, I’m good at everything,” he retorted with a saccharin drawl, curling his lips with a self-satisfied sneer.
Draco woke up freezing cold. He shivered from head to toe, the sound of his teeth clacking together and the rain pinging off the tarp above his head blocking out all other noise. It was complete and utter misery. He was bundled in three layers of clothes, but they were all soaked, so he stripped them off one by one and crossed his arms over his chest to preserve body heat.
“Let’s look for new, then. After all, it is summer.”
The Tribal Council room had been entirely reconfigured into an amphitheatre, three rickety chairs lining the base of a rounded set of bleachers. A soft drizzle soaked their clothes, falling gently from a partly-cloudy sky. A few stars were visible to the North.
His wand was clamped between his teeth, but he slid it out with his left hand. “Where does it hurt? Tell me where it hurts!”
“Wow,” Harry said simply.
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but only a groan escaped.
“Saw that last week too,” Ron interrupted.
“Gladly,” Harry replies.
“Teach, Draco. You’ve got first years to
Note: Rai stones are a very real historical artifacts with real significance to the indigenous people of the Yap islands. Everything about them in this fic is entirely made up, and it is not my intention to appropriate, sensationalize, or spread false information about a culture I know very little about. I encourage you to research real Rai stones: they are very cool.
Harry
Day 32
“It might’ve been,” he says. Some things are still hazy.
Harry cast a few light diagnostic spells over the stone. “Yeah, it doesn’t appear to be letting off an aura. Usually, magical objects create static in the air, but this one isn’t. I can feel that it has a magical core, but it feels dormant or disconnected somehow.”
Of course I’m up for going to Grimmauld Place with you. Despite it being my great-aunt’s place, and her being alive when I was little, I’ve never visited. She wasn’t someone whose company anyone enjoyed, and Mother would always arrange meetings with her in a way that a house elf could take me to my rooms or Florean Fortescue’s after the obligatory ten minutes on her doorsteps.
Day 38
“Okay,” Draco said. “Okay. Keep going until you can’t feel anything but the stone. And darling?--” Harry looked up-- “Please be careful.”
Hermione was meant to be portraying his half-sister. He had been at the interview where she had meticulously explained how his mom and her dad had met at an elementary school fundraiser before falling in love and joining their broken families. They hadn’t planned this story; Hermione had been making it up as she went, and Draco had been seriously impressed.
The floo alarm turns out to be Neville, carrying a six-pack of craft beer and a plant of his own.
Dear Harry,
“Greeting Death as a friend, though. There’s something romantic about that, yeah? I think it would mean you really lived.”
Potter smirks in a way that speaks of a self-protective habit. Last Draco knew, he was the only one of the two of them to have picked that up. “I’d really rather not drown today. Just tell me where the secret society you’ve masterminded meets, and I’ll be on my way.”
He settled somewhere in the middle, putting the lowest-toothed gear directly against the handle. On the same hex-shaped axle, he placed a medium-sized gear. Next to it, he slid on a spacer and fit a small gear against the medium gear. Lastly, he placed a large gear on the same axle as the small one and connected it to a final small gear that ran the pulley, so that one rotation of the handle would result in the pulley moving the bucket ten or so circumference-lengths of the starting gear.
“Yeah, yeah, just keep an eye on him,” Harry replied warily. He watched the toad for a moment before finally pointing his wand at the tank and performing the spell.
I rarely leave my home, mostly out of the risk of losing control and either becoming stranded somewhere entirely incapacitated or creating a public spectacle. Because of this, I am often restless, and struggle with some serious attachment issues..
Draco,
“I’ve never heard of anything being able to hold magic inside of itself,” Draco said. “Wizards have a magical signature, but that’s more like handwriting left behind on energy flows. Wands channel magic, but they don’t produce it. Even Stonehenge isn’t magical in and of itself. The rocks have charms placed on them that pull magic to the surface. Since magic works like electrons or magnets, it’s circular shape keeps tons of concentrated energy inside of it; a capacitor, if you will, but if you took it apart and dropped a piece of it somewhere with no Ley Line and no circle, it would just be a rock with a useless charm on it.”
“Funny,” he said. “Neither am I. Guess we’re stuck with each other’s company. What do you say we make the most of it?”
Draco donned his sweetest, most soothing tone. “I know, love. It’s okay. Why don’t we go back to bed.”
Day 2
Survivor unfolded with a cyclical cadence-- Reward, Immunity, Tribal, repeat-- but Draco felt one step behind, the next twist just outside of expectation’s reach. His brain was
You wrote about your difficulties keeping still and reigning in your thoughts, and that you feel that it might have something to do with the difficulty of controlling your magic. By the way, while your script is messy, as it has been since Hogwarts, don’t feel self-conscious about your writing process.
Harry Potter is there too, his unruly curls flattened down with a net, a cropped brown wig on top. His costume consists of black jeans and a denim jacket. Green eyes meet grey as the curtains open. Blinding lights and 300 cheers spur the actors on..
A spacious yacht carried them through the incandescent aquamarine channels of the tropical island paradise, docking in a bay overlooking a small, bustling village. Compact fishing boats drifted in and out of the harbor, their drivers waving as they passed.
“Well, won't you just consider--”
“And what would that make us?” Malfoy says.
Harry senses Malfoy coming before he sees him, even through the whip of the wind and the syrupy, indistinct aura of dusk. He doesn’t bother to turn around.
“G’night,” Hagrid replied, waving a hand in their direction.
Another question: are you the type of person who can sit calmly and watch an ant crawl across the meadow, or do you need to be in motion to wind down? I need to determine what kind of calming exercises are more likely to help you.
Ron’s retort was cut off by a ruckus of pattering feet, greasy fingers, squealing, and roughhousing.
“Alright, it’s time to vote. Draco, you're up first.”
During the years my magic began to act up, I was attending the University of Cambridge and working towards a dual diploma in the Magical Department of Education. I had hoped to become a certified teaching staff member at Hogwarts as a DADA professor. I also worked part-time in a local muggle cafe as a server, in the hopes of reconnecting with my muggle roots.
“Well, you’re kind of biased,” Harry muttered. “Anyways, I like her. She’s got spunk. And she’s not stupid.”
“Don’t worry,” Harry said with a twisted grin. “By the time I’m done with you, you’ll be sufficiently sweaty again.”
“But you buried the stone.”
She gave him a tight smile. “Sure, honey.”
Claire put her arms up defensively. “Jeez, sorry. Isn’t this a little sudden?”
“No, we figured something out. We made a breakthrough. That’s worth celebrating, come on.”
I’m glad you liked the books. I’m sorry your ex stole your copy. That was incredibly rude of them. Someone I dated in uni took my hard-back of Dorain Grey-- said it was ‘infuriating stereotypical’. I wonder if it was the same boy-- did he also cheat on you with a girl named Eliza the day before your birthday?
Draco sighs, but sets the plant by the fountain. Harry thinks Neville’s gifts are odd in an endearing way. Draco thinks they are just odd-- and no amount of doe-eyed-ness is going to make him change his mind about that.
A healthy, normal wizard’s core only incites magical particles to deviate from a state of equilibrium when it has reason to, whether that be because a spell has been cast by, on, or around them.
Harry laughed. “Another day? I need to talk to you.”
The mud ate their feet as they trudged into place, greedily refusing to release them. Draco caught Harry when he stumbled, his shoe having come entirely off. Once they started pulling, however, the mud turned from molasses to vaseline. Both teams opted for merely laying on the ground and slithering like frenzied snakes; when a player would try to stand up to tug, they fell directly on their arse. It was grueling, and for the first time in the game, Draco was more than tempted to use magic. He had never excelled at wandless spells that exerted physical force, but he could get Harry to do it with a pout and his very best puppy-dog eyes. Instead, cursing his sense of integrity, he pushed himself semi-upright with a hand so plastered in mud it looked like an oven mitt and dug his heels in.
Harry snapped his fingers in front of Draco’s face. “The well is this way, darling,” he said.
Harry blushes harder. “No, no, not like--”
Draco’s nose was buried in the warm shoulder of Harry Potter. Their bodies were pressed together, Harry on his back and Draco snuggled against him, shoulder-length curls tickling his brow. He sprang away, eyes darting frantically to see if anyone else was up.
And she is grateful to me for helping her when she needed it.
Under normal circumstances, he would have felt confident coming out of a tribe with one extra member, but with Jones more than likely to flip, dodge, and betray, it was pressing for Draco to prove he could be loyal and open-minded. They were reaching the point in the game where a moment of intimidation, standoffish-ness, or apparent secrecy could give him the boot. He would have to further play down his relationship with Iz and Harry, and he needed to keep the Idol absolutely under wraps.
“I’m doing it now,” Draco replied, pulling out his own wand. He pointed it at the tank and performed the spells he knew would create a constant damp atmosphere within the walls. “I wonder what temperature we should go for…”
Draco’s jaw dropped as he stared at Ichabod. “H-how did this happen?”
“Sorry for not taking your worry seriously,” Draco said.
“No… this week for everything.”
Draco nodded. “I think that’s part of it, but without new Ley Line magic coming up from the ground, they would lose their charge over time. When I felt the Rai stones, they didn’t seem to be depleted, just sort of dormant. Their magic was deep inside of them, almost hidden.”
Draco shrugs nonchalantly, but a smug smile tugs at his lips. “So what if I am?”
He funneled water into his pail, already racing towards the stairs when Jeff called him to a halt. Draco’s flag had raised.
“You can’t just be sad because I’m angry, Harry,” Draco had responded.
“You’ll know it.”
“It’s whatever it wants to be. I think it’s crystal clear already that this night has taken the reins for itself.” In Harry’s head, it sounds terribly poetic, but he’s sure it’s not.
Harry shook his head. “I wonder if he understands what we’re saying.”
I can see part of your magic’s condition already from the state in which your letter reached me. It gave both the owl and me quite a fright. Your owl hadn’t even reached the perch on my desk when the letter pulled itself from the fastening and sped towards me. I assumed it was cursed and tried to block it, but it dodged my spells and rushed towards my face even faster. When I braced myself and tried to protect my eyes, it flew into my hand, fluttering almost like a Snitch. A powerful tendril of magic, intense enough to be visible without an Energiam Videre charm, came out of it, and I thought it would attack me, but it just touched my cheek, soft as a caress.
“Malfoy?” Harry says. They have their backs to one another, each a score of paces from the center of the corridor and progressing inwards. The floor is littered with soapstone bricks, several of which are shaped far too much like safari animals to be of coincidence. These in particular keep falling from the walls when they are replaced, no matter how much mortar Harry conjures. He rolls his eyes.
“Can I please be Potter’s girlfriend? Please, please, pretty please? It will be
“That was the only reason I let my mother take me to
“Really?” Draco snapped. “That’s stupid. Lonnie is likable, and everyone on this jury is too much of an arse to vote for likable.”
the Ley Lines, but that doesn’t make any sense at all!”
“Uhh,” Draco stammered, glancing left to catch Harry’s shocked eye, “why do you ask?”
Harry arrived first, stradling the opposite end of the hammock and bracing his hands on his knees.
; we will only meet up when it’s strictly necessary. Otherwise, I will send you tests which you do on your own and can send me probes of your magical energy to analyze.
“Don’t sound so smug about it!” Ron shouted from the kitchen.
Lonnie cut him off. “Jones, you can’t ask that. Draco, a word?” he said, forcing Jones out of Draco’s personal space in two long strides. He nodded towards the beach, jaw set in an angry grimace.
Draco’s body buzzed with nervous energy as he stepped from the narrow speedboat onto the rickety rope ladder of an anchored sailing ship. In place of a Jolly Roger, a flowing banner reading ‘Survivor Wa’ab: Coastal Divide’ flew from its uppermost mast. Trying not to appear too eager, Draco hopped the railing and boarded the vessel, taking a deep breath of the sweet tropical air and closing his eyes. Following the woman in front of him, he paced the deck, craning to catch a glance at the items littering it’s planks. Single-file, he took his spot on a green raffia rug, shuffling a little so as not to bump anyone else.
“Never said I didn’t like her. She just tried too hard.”
“Fuck,” he says-- without roots to stabilize it, the soil in the beds is bound to get everywhere. Summoning all his strength, Draco casts the strongest, widest Impervius he can manage and floats it over the entirety of the garden so that the rain rolls safely off and into the neighboring yards. Success.
Marissa stood, her auburn curls bobbing where they weren’t plastered against her face with rain. “My question is for Harry,” she said. “Harry, you called yourself a leader, but I want to know specifically what moves you made that directly affected the outcome of the game. It is all well and good to have human values, but this is not the real world, this is Survivor. I am not granting you a peace prize, I am judging whether you have done what it takes to outplay everyone else in a game that is fundamentally removed from common social constructs.”
Draco clicked instantly with the assertive woman, Isabelle, who had directed the challenge strategy. She was, apparently, from Oakland, California and worked for the Bay Area FBI branch. She had long cornrows, a slightly crooked tooth that Draco assumed had once been knocked out, and an intelligent way of speaking that Draco learned was, despite its brusqueness, incredibly thoughtful. Nothing Draco told her about himself was true, but she proved an excellent listener anyway. Even her racerback tank top and hiking pants exuded the air of a person who knew exactly what they were doing. Draco hoped they had a lot in common.
“Not a clue,” Draco said with a grin. “But that won’t stop me talking to him. Come on. We’ll be late.”
“No way. I’m not holding him,” Harry shook his head quickly. “Not until I know what he does.”
Harry slept wretchedly. He was pretty sure he’d not had a night that bad since the winter Teddy did a stint in St. Mungo’s with pneumonia. More than anything, it was frustrating as all hell. He woke up at half past two, sweat sticky down his back and sheets tangled around his ankles, hot and claustrophobic and reminding him acutely of Venomous Tentacula.
Still exhausted from the previous morning’s midnight escapade, Draco slept late. Well past breakfast, he was startled out of bone-deep sleep by the ruckus of shouting.
“Awake me thinks you’re pretty too,” Draco whispers.
The donut holes cut in the stones would hold energy for a while, but then I’m sure there are specified spells to draw magic from inside the structure of the rock itself to replenish it. There’s so many stored pockets of energy that the stones never fully ran out, even when wizards drew from the magic and dispersed it into the air for decades. It makes sense why it was so hard to figure out if the stones even had Ley Line magic at all; the hole at the center had long since lost its power, and the rest is just a sliver of magic in each molecule of the rock, and it’s entirely stable. It didn’t want to react with my signature because it was enclosed in a perfect balance.”
The next item was uncovered as well, and inspired an immediate and abrupt bidding war between Tara and Jessie. Only Tara would be stupid enough to spend all her money on the second platter, but for once Draco didn’t blame her. He would have traded his firstborn for that guacamole.
“Fuck,” Draco says. “Fuck. Gorgeous. So gorgeous. So eager.” Harry whines, hot and breathy. He wishes he could give more praise, but it’s hard to speak when his tongue is otherwise-occupied.
Harry smirked. “More perceptive than we thought,” he said slyly.
Isabelle grinned as she arrived in front of Draco, flowy jumpsuit and fresh cornrows giving her a happy glow. “Draco,” she said, “you know you have my vote. Instead, I would like to take this time to aid in your case. Jury, the most deserving here, undoubtedly, is Draco. I was with him through thick and thin, and he never lost his edge, his control, his wit, his attitude. This man embodies what it means to be a master of Survivor. He is a pioneer. Draco, I am so lucky to have met you.”
“Ah,” Draco states. “Have you ever been cliff diving? Because that’s my plan.”
Draco frowned. “Should we try to collect larger items like wood and fishing traps from the deck since they will be more difficult to steal? And then if they go for flint we can try to steal it?”
Draco grins, victorious and taunting and delighted and tender. “I married you, didn’t I? What’s mine is yours.”
I thought I should warn you about that. I don’t know her well, but I bet she’s scary when she’s stern. Good thing we’re 25 and she can’t actually send you to your room.
He rubbed his temples, uncapping the comically large and cumbersome pen and inking a neat ‘J’ onto the parchment. He folded it carefully into thirds and placed it at the bottom of the intricately engraved jar.
“You saved my head from hitting,” she said carefully.
“Love it.”
anything. I want a snapshot in a dreamscape, where you can’t quite tell if you’re seeing things a second too soon or a lag behind. I don’t want good or bad or past or future or fucking rationality. I want right now. I want right now to not be as horrible as everything else." Harry’s voice cracks between his words, and his syntax distorts. Tears on his face are commas, punctuating all the wrong pauses. Splotches on his cheeks fill the gaps between sentences, tethering them to each other, taking Harry with them as they fall. Malfoy wraps him in a hug.
Because there was an odd and constant glimmer over the lid of Ichabod’s tank, almost imperceptible, but Harry knew a powerful glamour when he saw one.
Harry thought for a moment. “Do you think that’s what the hole in the Rai stones are for? To hold the magic, like Stonehenge but smaller?”
It was night 1, and he was already going batshit crazy. By the time they had water boiling, the sun had gone down, and the whole tribe was hungry and irritable. A bland plate of rice did little to raise morale. It was in that moment, staring up at a film of dusky clouds and surrounded by subdued chatter, that Draco realized this whole ordeal was going to be much more difficult than anticipated.
“Here!” she exclaimed, uncharacteristic confidence evident in her smile. Isabelle was a stoic woman, but, as Draco had discovered, the more one got to know her, the more she opened up. She was sharp and steady and logical, but there was a youthful whimsy to the analytical way she studied the world. It was like she was a student of life. Draco envied it.
“Fine. Little Mermaid-- Chitty Chitty Bang Bang-- god, I forget every time how fucking weird that one is-- The Fox and the Hound--
I am sure this letter is coming to you as a bit of a surprise, and I will not blame you if you are suspicious of its good faith. Therefore, I will do my best to clarify my intentions.
what was wrong and that it was all
Harry, it turned out, was right. Harry was right about a lot of things he had said on the Reward Trip, excluding some blatant exaggerations regarding Draco’s sexual prowess, but, namely, he was right about Jones self-destructing his own majority alliance. Currently, it was Jones, Claire, CJ, and Jessie against just Iz, Harry, and Draco. At the past Tribal Council, Lonnie had been booted on a rock draw.
All is well.
“So, you going to write me a speech?”
Draco sent him a confident smirk. “Oh? It’s a turn-off, you say?” he snickered, earning himself a glare.
“They think you and Iz are a threat, and they want to take out the one who’s less strong in challenges. I suggested we keep you around for the eye candy.”
Draco closed his eyes to think. The challenge would require a balance of three skills: gear efficiency, throwing accuracy, and climbing endurance. He would need to get the puzzle done quickly and then pace himself for the rest.
“Falling in love is easy. No, Snape is a hero because he was brave. He put himself in constant danger, under constant responsibility for nearly half his life. He meant something. Even before I knew he was a spy, I always admired that he had intention.”
He feels more than sees the flash of movement from the direction of the trail. Malfoy approaches cautiously, stiffly. He sits neatly, cross-legged.
He told Harry such as they traipsed through the woods, heading towards the location of a third Rai stone that they had tracked the previous evening. This one was larger, nearly eight feet in height, and stood at the center of a wide swath of ruins. The town had to have been at least 100 years abandoned, but the skeletons of palm-thatched huts remained as obscure lumps in the undergrowth. Draco got the uneasy feeling that he was intruding. The seemingly sudden dereliction of the village struck him as off.
In seconds, all of the kids were in on the chant, even quiet Ellie and barely-old-enough-to-form-sentences Hugo. “Hotel for Dogs! Hotel for Dogs! Hotel for Dogs!”
“Contestants, let’s get started. This game has three core principles: Outwit, Outlast, and Outplay. Outwit is the social portion of the game, the relationships you make and the values you stand on. Outlast is your tenacity, your ability to make the choices that put you in the best position. It is your refusal to give up. Outplay is your overall understanding of Survivor and whether you were able to show true mastry to get you to this point. You’ve done the hard part, now it’s time to fill the Jury in. Claire, let’s start with you; tell us why you think you deserve their vote for the winner of Survivor Wa’ab?”
,” Harry replied, kissing Draco on the cheek as they headed for the door.
Harry nodded, giving Draco a sympathetic look. “I think we do, yes. When we go back up to the school tomorrow, I think we should speak to Hagrid about him. He might be able to help.”
“Your alliance consists of Doug, Ian, Lindsay, and Marissa. Doug might be our best bet to target. Everyone has sort of fallen under his wing because he’s older and commanding, but we can use that. Either Lindsay or Ian might be insecure enough to flip if we plant the seed. The question is, how do we tell them they’re sheeple for following him without explicitly telling them they’re sheeple for following him?”
“Kay,” Draco says, in earnest.
Waves echo and rebound through a limestone archway, lapping at Draco’s ears--
Sleep came fitfully, as it often did amid change, and so Draco was already half awake when the screaming started. For the gruffness of his speaking voice, Jones screeched like a girl, high pitched and maniacal. He shed his blanket and vaulted to his feet in blind desperation, unfazed when his head clunked against the bamboo scaffolding as he leapt from the cot. He ran until he hit the water, dunking his head beneath the waves and scratching at his scalp with snaggled nails. The rest of the camp watched in horror.
Draco rolled his eyes but smiled. “I’ll come and visit him next week. I’m glad he’s happy.”
Halfway into the 4th round, three players dropped. A burly man from the opposite tribe, Jessie, and Lonnie all nearly missed a catch, fumbling to place the ball on top and failing to notice when a ball landed in the sand beside each of them with a flat ‘plop.’
Tribal was quick, as even Jeff was inclined to put a shaking, hyperventilating Jessie out of her misery.
“Well, it seems like he had some kind of enchantment over him,” Hagrid replied, shrugging. “Couple of hours after you left, there was a flash and then he was this big. Must have been charmed to come off when he was happy. Turns out he’s some kind of oriental toad. Some Muggles see them and get a bit spooked, but most other Muggles don’t believe them. It’s only magical folk who get to see the real toads. ”
Harry looked about to cry. “I forgot,” he whimpered.
sharp, but no matter how much he had himself fooled, a corner was always fuzzy, blindspots filled-in by his overactive anxiety.
“It’s Harry, isn’t it?”
Ichabod continued to gaze at them.
“I never decided. I guess it’s time to pick, isn’t it?”
You are not alone in this difficulty to keep still or force your attention to go the way you are expected to, and, to be honest, hearing this from you doesn’t come as a surprise to me.
They had taken the brazen strategy of putting the puzzle together on the ground before mounting it on the stand. Apparently, it had been a joint decision, but when the other team began to cheat off their exposed pieces, Doug refused to give it up. Iz urged him to let go and start over by pressing what they had finished into the display, but he grew frustrated, ignoring whatever she said to him as he continued to kneel on the ground. The tribe had less than half of their slightly-culturally-insensitive illustration of a tiki assembled when celebratory cheers signaled them to stop.
Even Draco was getting paranoid, blacking out the windows and staying up past the crack of daylight doing research. He contacted the estate agent, inquiring whether there were any reports of curses on the house and scoured periodicals for similar stories. Harry, however, was already convinced of the source. The problem would be getting Draco to believe him.
Sincerely,
She cleared her throat. “As the wife of a senator, I have learned to appreciate the work that happens in the background. Just like a government needs a cabinet, a support staff, and families to come home to, so does an alliance. Although I was not the first to speak my mind or the first to share at Tribal, the contributions I made to my tribe cannot be dismissed. I was always present, I never panicked, and I was the person that people came to when they had a disagreement or concern. Namely, I was the calming presence who talked to Jones when he grew upset or uncomfortable. I believe many of you can thank me for the work I put in to keep our alliance together, and credit that to the progress you made in the game.”
spines!”
He approached the ladder with confidence, but as soon as he stepped on, it swung under his weight, forcing him to clumsily scramble the rest of the way. Draco didn’t have time to be embarrassed for long. He lunged for the twine securing the tarps, working at a series of square-knots with his left hand and his teeth. He had almost every knot undone when the sturdy man with the Boston accent barged past him, shoving Draco’s arms away and tearing at the rope. Draco waited until the tarps came free and then snatched them back, dropping off the side of the ladder and hitting the ground at a sprint.
And then they start dancing, and Harry is utterly enthralled. He cannot think as far as to want anything; he cannot think at all. His collar sticks to the back of his neck and his lips shine from being licked and bitten over and over.
” it read, and her voice grew more and more high-pitched as she read it. Together they stared at the medallion, transfixed, Iz letting out little squeals of uncontainable excitement every few seconds.
hold him and
“Maybe she should have thought about making a mark before becoming a pageant princess or whatever,” he hissed.
Harry rubbed at the raw skin absently, with a half annoyed, half fond expression on his lips. “So what do I do?”
Harry rolled to his feet easily, utilizing his honed auror agility. “You mean
Beyond the shore, a sweeping view of the castle looms over them, warm light filtering through windows. In the dusky night, lit by the remnants of a sunset to the west and a rising moon to the East, it is difficult to make out the destruction. The crumbling, unlit wings of the castle fade into the shadows. The ragged wounds in the sides of pews are smoothed over.
the vibrations around him, each different magical signature dancing through the air on a spectrum from red to violet. It was synesthesia on steroids. He could sense the direction, the distance, and the age of each magical location; they even seemed to have a personality, like the emotion and intent behind the spells cast could be sensed from the way they moved.
Draco shrugs, but it turns into a shimmy as he snuggles closer. “I did it a little bit for you,” he admits.
Harry laughed. “I don’t blame them. It’s a treasure.”
Please forgive me, I feel so ashamed of myself. I should have taken this aggravating factor of your condition into consideration.
Hagrid sets him up with a growler of something purple and steaming and a comically-sized wooden kitchen chair.
Jeff announced, emphasizing the final word, and Draco shot Harry a knowing smirk.
Harry groaned. “I know, I know. Somehow, though, he keeps surprising me. It wouldn’t surprise me if he got this toad from someone dodgy. We’d better make sure the lid on the terrarium is on tight, just in case.”
a Hidden Immunity Idol. All votes cast for Isabelle will not count,” Jeff confirmed. His gaze followed Draco all the way back to his seat.
They landed in the thick undergrowth of a deep jungle. The moon rays rippled a watery teal through the filter of foliage. There didn’t appear to have been people around for a very long time, but the forest teemed with life.
Yesterday was a disaster. I’m so sorry. I don’t know if I can forgive myself. I didn’t want to hurt you. That house brings out the worst in me. A stronger man would have been able to resist. Clinically, you are probably smart enough to understand.
“Right?” Harry says. “I don’t think I was right at all.”
"Think this is the first time people have fucked in here?" Harry asks.
Draco is covered in dirt and sweat from helping Neville move the lawn furniture onto the porch and mowing down the grass and weeds, an exhaustive process even with the aid of magic. Before anyone starts putting their hands on him, he needs a shower. “Maybe later. Did you need something else?”
“I didn’t mean to hurt him,” Harry whispered, voice bitter. “It was an accident. I don’t know what happened. I was so mad. I dreamed about ants in the sand, but I didn’t feel them; he did. It’s because I love you.”
Draco pulled Isabelle aside. Her face was stoic as ever, but he could tell she was upset. Dependability and logic were what she prided herself on, and she felt like an utter fraud. He pulled her in for a hug. The silver lining, he told her, was that everyone knew it had not been her fault. In the end, the emotions she was feeling, while valid, would not be impacting their game; the fact that Doug had made a fool of himself very well could. All they had to do was play it right.
Malfoy meets him at his room, like he said he would, like Harry asked. Harry knows because he is woken by a hesitant hand on his shoulder, a soft shake. His eyes blink open, and, just for a second, all he sees is a snake with it’s jaws wide open, an old man collapsing to a damp dungeon floor, threads of a house elf’s blood being pulled away with the tide. His hand is on his wand immediately, his wand against the stark tendon of a slender neck nearly as fast.
“After our challenge performance today, maybe we ought to start looking for that Idol again,” she said.
If you will have me, I can still do lunch on Tuesday. I can’t promise I’ll show, or, given I do, if I’ll stay. I should probably talk to Bullstode, rather than worry you with my thoughts, but you might have to drag me there. Hermione and Gin tried to get me to go today. You’ll have to ask them whether they were successful.
He hummed as he showered, lingering beneath the steady spray. He took the luxury of turning the temperature up and down as he fancied, relishing in the feeling of cool water running through his hair and hot steam on his back.
“Shhh,” Harry says, “I’ll be right there. Just need to water the sweet peas before the sun goes down.”
And so, when Draco had brought it up the first time, Harry had been glad, albeit surprised (and a little quick to judge). Merlin, though: he had had no idea what he was in for.
“That’s ar’ight. We can talk, then.” He clears his throat. “So, what’s next for ya’, ‘Arry?”
Yours,
“No, but I really don’t think this is a regular toad,” Harry replied. “I’m not taking any chances. The deeper it is, the less chance of him getting out.”
Draco was shaken out of his reverie with the crisp smack of a clapperboard as the cameras were moved back and adjusted. Jeff Probst, still smiling, pulled a piece of paper from his loose button-down and studied it for a moment, nodding to the producer as he adjusted his collar.
The challenge commenced with a shout and a cheer, and Isabelle dove gracefully into the sea, reappearing seconds later with a heavy ball connected to a length of green nylon. A ring with a key on it slid downwards towards where the rope was secured to the dock and Tara scrambled to unclip it with clumsy fingers.
A single thread of magic, soft, slender, and periwinkle, traced Draco’s feet, and he bent to study it. He ran his hand through the ethereal mist and closed his eyes, letting the gentle scent of mangoes and shade wash over him. He pulled Harry down with him, gesturing, and Harry nodded.
Draco bit his lip. “Thank you. And I will. He’s right, I mean. I am, and I’m out, and this isn’t my first rodeo.”
I am sorry you still have to live with triggers from the War. I saw glimpses of what you went through those months in 6th and 7th year; I can only imagine the lasting damage of living in and contributing to that environment. Your tenacity and resilience are truly commendable, not because you have ‘reformed’, but because you have survived at all. You have done what I have been unable to, what many have been unable to: live. You, Malfoy, are a force of nature.
Harry shrugs. “They’re in Australia.”
“You’ll like it. It’s good for first dates.”
“He is,” Draco nodded, bending down slightly to look into the tank with interest. “Is he a native species, Hagrid?”
“Sorry mate, but no-can-do. You really should have come in earlier, if you needed it this soon.”
I am sorry if I came across to you as unfriendly or unapproachable. I was simply trying to be as accommodating as possible. I did not mean to imply that I did not want to see you, simply that I did not want to be a burden.
“Clever, Potter. Although, I did read about Illuminati strongholds being built in Ward Deserts. If you find out more, let me know. I need to have a word with them about not inviting me.”
My Floo address is 687 Evans Ln, Devon, England. If you have any tests for me, you may bring them by hand at any time. I would prefer if you came alone and did not share this address with anyone else. Although it may be an inconvenience to you, please do not send anything heavier than parchment with Desdemona; her leg is still healing.
I’m not going to lie; visiting the house is going to be rough. Do you mind if I ask Hermione to tag along? I will try not to embarrass myself with too many shakes, tears, or explosions. I’d ask you to wear a bomb-squad suit, but that sort of outfit is far too modest for your (my) taste.
“Positive.”
Jeff called go, and, suddenly, nothing else seemed to matter. The big picture was no more; only details remained. Draco took a calculated breath and dropped his first ball. His right hand, the non-dominant one, was tied behind his back, but he opened and closed his fist unconsciously, tapping his thumb to keep time.
“I’m so sorry, Harry. What happened messed me up. You know why, I guess. You saw it. I thought I needed to process. I’m sorry,” Draco wept, backing away. His hands shook.
Camp devolved into an absolute cluster. Jones paced back and forth, pulling one person aside at a time and cutting them off mid-conversation. Claire, Jessie, and CJ, Immunity Necklace still lying across his chest, sat in a scattered semi-circle by the fire, looking lost and alarmed as their leader spiralled and frayed.
“If you say so,” Draco said. “Alright, what kind of enrichment should we give him? Do you think he’d like a cave?”
“That was like a magical friction burn,” Harry said hoarsely.
a few hits off someone’s dab pen and a burned throat...
Harry tries not to smile. “I’m minimizing risk.”
be,” Draco muttered, looking down at the toad too before sighing. “But you’re right. I suppose we do have to consider it, don’t we?”
The first item was a glistening carton of buttered popcorn, a box of off-brand Mike-and-Ike, and a coke, complete with a paper cup and straw. Draco hated movie theater snacks. Heck, he even hated movie theatres-- they were loud and overwhelming, and tended to make his head spin and his sleep suffer. This particular plate of movie theatres snacks, however, made his mouth water eagerly. He was just so damn hungry.
In their daily life, he and Harry were a team. They complimented each other, and although they each had separate jobs and separate friends, they were genuinely invested in everything the other did. The past few days had been a harsh reminder that Draco wasn’t really a people person-- he was introverted and tended to come across as a little too intense-- and that Harry was incomparably charismatic. The man loathed being famous and detested attention from strangers, but, without external pressure, he was naturally charming, fun-loving, and outgoing. As a social player, he thrived where Draco struggled, and Draco felt like something that was
“Oh,” Harry says, quizzical. Realization brings with it a smile that mirrors Malfoy’s. “
Draco had felt it too-- a busy, violent hiss of magic zipping past his ears, an insolent tug on his magical core as it combusted on contact with the energy in the air like a million tiny explosions. It was a situation where being more powerful meant being more vulnerable, and Harry was just that.
The merge feast was there too, under a thick patterned blanket and surrounded by a leafed banquet table. If anyone dropped from the challenge, they would have the opportunity to go and eat. Further, the table was out of earshot of the booths, giving those out early a much-needed chance to socialize.
“Here,” he said, pointing. “This spell causes areas with strong magical residue in the atmosphere to emit a vibration. It essentially works like sonar. The historical presence of magic needs to be very strong for it to work, as it reacts with the by-product of spell energy, but if we do it right, it should lead us to where ancient inhabitants of the island lived. Magic goes through a sort of radioactive decay, so it should pick up magic from even thousands of years ago, but the older the residue, the lower the frequency of the response. We’re trying to look for something that is within the past few hundred years, but not too concentrated.”
A first fat drop strikes Harry in the shoulder, and he eyes Malfoy quizzically. “The forecast was clear.”
Harry scratched his neck. “What if we track magical signatures. If we look for traces on the island, we can probably find where there used to be towns or main traveling arteries. That should lead us to where stones were likely kept.”
“I would be remiss if I did not mention Isabelle. I maintained multiple positive social relationships throughout the game, from my strategic alliance with Lindsay and Marissa in the early days of Tribe West, making the move to vote out Doug, to the post-merge, with my friendship to Lonnie and Harry. Beyond these superficial alliances, though, my relationship with Isabelle proves that I am capable of true teamwork.
“The castle magic. It reacts to whimsy. The way it bent to us— it wouldn’t do that if there wasn’t—you know.”
In the time Draco had been daydreaming about Potter-- and how much of a git he was-- the cameras had moved on to the rather motley agglomeration of Easterners. A scruffy man was speaking with a clipped Boston accent, gesturing demonstratively while a meek-looking southern-belle dodged his flying hands. Draco decided he was glad they had decided to impersonate the hippie kind of Americans instead.
I’m so glad that Robert Service has piqued your interest. Could I interest you in any more nature poets and essayists? I am rather well educated. If I can’t be in nature myself, I read instead. When I am at my most reckless and my magic at its most volatile, I sometimes apparate to the alps (rather far, but, again, I’m special, aren’t I?) and run through the mountain trails until I can’t anymore. I’ve spent many a night sleeping under the stars and snow, feeling the stones and the moss beneath my feet. No literature could capture that feeling, but something about you makes me want to keep looking. I want you to read it; I want you to read me.
Lonnie smiled with a nod. He probably knew it wasn’t the full truth, but what Harry had said was hardly a lie-- even if he hadn’t realized it before arriving on the island.
Isabelle undid the wrappings, squealing as the heavy pendant landed in her palm. She snatched a parchment from where it had fallen at their feet. “
“Beyond some kind of toad? No,” Draco replied, shaking his head. “But look at him, Harry. He’s quite sweet really.”
If you get this, I’m sorry you had to wake up alone. I couldn’t sleep and went out for some air. I’ll make sure to grab us egg-on-bagels from this place I know out in Cardiff.
When anyone else does this sort of problem, Draco thinks they look a bit like a juvenile orangutan, but Harry-- half naked, back taut and rippling as his limbs bunch and unfurl-- is the sexiest thing he’s seen all month.
Harry was well-liked by everyone, whereas Draco’s more cerebral and assertive personality left him on the outs of the social scene. The only person who seemed to genuinely enjoy talking to him was Isabelle, and they spent long hours on the beach discussing strategy, university, and boyfriends.
Draco frowns, confused. Every meeting with Neville he has had over the past week has left him more baffled than the last. Men and their hobbies… “Yes. I have no idea what would grow-- I suppose I could look at the bed on Harry’s balcony, but what if--”
“I didn’t. They got sent an anonymous letter pleading my release. I thought it was from you.”
And the way you said it, in such a normal, domestic situation, just as we got ready to take Teddy to the National Museum of Scotland! You gave me such a tender look. Had it not been for Teddy waiting for us, I would have dragged you upstairs immediately and taken you back to bed.
fault, but instead he turned his eyes up to Harry’s and said, “I guess I just thought I’d be better at this. Nobody seems to like me and the challenge yesterday was so awful, but everyone seems to want to be your best friend. I just wanted to be the hero for once.”
Harry’s laughs with his whole body. It feels nice-- so nice, the vibrations soothing and jubilant. Draco feels a wet kiss being pressed to his jaw.
“A camera,” she called, “It must mean we’re close.” She ducked her head to look at him, a grin splitting her face.
The advantage was a slim scroll tied plainly with taupe yarn. Himself, Isabelle, and Jones all put $500 up for it. Draco had zero grasp on the conversion of USD to Pounds, but he knew that, today at least, half a grand might as well have been the Gates fund.
The return trip to the beach was about as awkward as Draco expected. The older man held out his arm. “Shall we introduce ourselves?” he said. His navy NYPD t-shirt hung loose, but his cargo pants hit just at the ankles. He grasped Draco’s hand firmly in both of his, holding comfortable eye contact. “Lonnie.”
Jessie came next.
“Hello Harry, Draco,” Hagrid said jovially when they appeared at his door two days later. “How’re you two and toad doing?”
“I like a hot momma, and it’s not like she has anything to compare him to. I might blow her mind,” she had smirked.
Harry snorts. “Oh, and be careful of the mantle when you come through. I have a bunch of philodendrons propagating in vases. Don’t knock them over.”
Draco groaned inwardly. Merlin, Harry was good.
Draco shrugged. “Couples fight, Harry. It’s normal. I just want time to think.”
The gym is completely empty, and gauzy, smog-shrouded stars filter through the skylight. It’s past 3am on a summer morning, but their membership comes with a 24hr door-code.
Draco followed, still grinning to himself. He glanced at Ichabod over his shoulder, just catching a glimpse of him still sitting still inside his leafy new home before the door closed behind him.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I thought you were a student of the game. Isn’t cheating a little unethical?”
Draco pauses. “You’re… not?”
He pushed up with his legs, taking a massive lungful of air as he dragged her head above water. He Accioed his wand with a wave and a whisper, hoping the Disillusionment Charm placed on it would hold.
