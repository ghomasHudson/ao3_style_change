‘Really? Where did they find it?’
“I’d like to go for the hormone potions though,”  Draco attempted to be serious again, but Adelaide had such a laughing fit it was hard to be. He took his teacup and raised it for a sip when the kitchen floo roared to life and Harry came through.
Quickly, before he’d lose courage, Draco snatched the thing from the kitchen table, uncorked it and downed the potion. He swallowed it quickly, without tasting much, but made a face anyway. “It tastes green.”
‘I wasn’t sure you were ready for that conversation yet,’ Harry said, looking at Draco via the mirror.
‘How…?’ he whispered, not being able to raise his voice anymore.
“We’ll do once with the stimulants, and take a break if we need to do a third round,” Draco decided. Harry once more hummed his agreement.
“Okay…” Draco murmured.
“That’s early,” he murmured.
‘No, sir. I’ve stopped taking them this month in preparation for bonding with my prospected owner.’
“Please make sure that you do.”
Still rattled, Draco slowly let himself sink back down into the bed. He shuffled over to Harry’s side of the bed, pressing his head into Harry’s pillow, letting the scent overwhelm and calm him. His heart-rate went down to a somewhat normal level. He tried to relax his muscles, but couldn’t force them to. The alarm was still going off, making his ears ring and filling the room with saturated light.
‘Good.’ And in one firm thrust, Harry pushed in to the hilt. Draco yelped and moaned. It was one thing being filled up slowly, getting your arse stuffed within mere seconds was an entirely different thing. Harry must’ve known, because he waited patiently for Draco to initiate movement before he started to thrust. Even though they were shallow thrusts, Draco’s eyes rolled back in his head and he bared his neck again. ‘More, please,’ Draco choked out and Harry willingly upped the game of his thrusts.
“Harry, Adelaide is my friend, don’t hurt her,” Draco murmured whilst squeezing Harry’s thigh firmly.
They sat in silence for a while. Draco deepened and slowed his breath, acknowledging his relief and happiness and letting it settle deeper in his body and mind with every breath he took. He felt Harry’s tears against his shoulder, but was not worried. Through their bond, he could feel many of his own emotions reflected back at him. Harry was happy too.
“Ministry holding cell,” Remus replied. “They’re not moving him until negotiations are finalised. So he’ll stay there until they’ve decided where he’s going.”
They stopped in front of the bookstore and Draco pressed his lips against Harry’s for a chaste kiss. “Nothing’ll happen, okay? It’s only two hours and I’ll be spending them in a
“If you want to… I could help. It’s been a while since I left the house.” Lupin’s voice was unsteady.
“They had a visiting arrangement. The DMLE and the ORO have taken that away from Lupin and his mate,” Draco said, although he was sure Harry already knew. “It came to an end recently, and they dumped Lupin with Tonks, who obviously wasn’t the appropriate match for Lupin.”
“I got you four scoops.” Harry sat down next to Draco and handed him the ice cream cup.
‘If I could, I am very interested to see Draco’s records as well,’ Harry continued, as if he hadn’t just implied that Draco was pregnant, ‘I’ve noticed that he is quite studious and if his results here allow it, I would like allow him to study more.’
‘Yes?’
“Oh.” Harry sounded relieved. “Okay, so what else can I do?”
‘I never realised…’ Hermione considered out loud, ‘but did your parents know that the list only stated recommendations?’
Draco managed to smile a watery smile and let Harry drag him out the door.
Both Draco and Harry were quiet for a while.
Draco leaned back a little so he could look at Harry’s face. “You do realise it won’t legally matter?”
‘That’s good,’ Harry said. ‘I’ve missed you, you know. This “not allowed to have contact while waiting for the papers” sucked.’
‘I’m still wet. And I think I need a rather thorough cleaning down there since you came inside my hole endlessly.’
The girl smiled at him again. “There’s an additional fee for that – one galleon and two knuts.”
Harry’s hand slid over Draco’s arse, squeezing every now and then. ‘Probably the last bits of heat leaving your body, it’ll be fine.’
He could hear Harry moan, “fuck,” from outside the nest and made a soft noise of excitement in response to that. “Please, Harry…”
“Didn’t think you could still have kids, ma.” Ginny said, her tone unreadable.
“You don’t have a choice.” Remus stepped closer, moving into Hermione's space and placing a supportive arm around Draco’s waist. “Let’s just get it checked out. It could be false alarm. Who knows.”
Adelaide chuckled. ‘I’m fine, Draco, really. I’m happy you have Mr Potter to take care of you… you
Harry was slow to respond, wrapping his arms around Draco to keep him in place but was otherwise motionless. Draco pulled back a little. “Harry?”
‘Is that painful?’
“Mrs Malfoy.” Harry greeted coldly, having moved quickly back to Draco as soon as he had heard her voice. When Draco felt his Alpha’s hand on his shoulder, reassuring, he managed to breathe in and he relaxed a little.
‘You’re so clingy,’ Draco murmured, before answering, ‘I ahm – I asked Hermione if she knows if there are ways to induce a heat.’
‘Hello Draco, I’m Ginny Weasley. It’s nice to meet you,’ she told him.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?! How about this Tom Riddle guy, huh? HARRY AND DRACO COMING CLOSE TO BONDING MAKES ME FEEL SO EXCITED (I feel so weird for getting hyped for my own story...)  Let me know what you think down below ^^
“I won’t,” Adelaide promised.
Draco whimpered because of how good it felt, how good it felt to be filled up, how good it was to come for his Alpha, the praise… ‘Harry…’
As if these dawning realisations weren’t horrible enough, he could
‘Oh,’ Draco said, surprised. Alphas usually weren’t the type for domestic duties, but then again, the only Beta in their household was Ron. ‘Don’t you have house elves?’
“Really,” Harry confirmed, and he closed the gap between them to kiss his mate. It was a sweet kiss, and Draco leaned into it almost desperately. He breathed Harry’s scent in, letting it fill his nose, allowing it to chase away all other senses, all of his insecurities and thoughts.
Harry stepped inside too and wrapped Draco in his arms, ‘still aroused?’
“If I start to hope for anything we have more than now, I’m not sure if I could keep going.” Remus leaned forward, placing his elbows on his knees and blowing out a strained breath. “Maybe I should have let our bond be dissolved. I’m sure Tonks would have mated me.” The hopelessness in his tone was jarring.
Draco could feel her eyes sliding over them with new eyes, but she made no comment and filled out everything.
“Fuck me,” Draco breathed, his tone somewhere between a request and an order.
‘Good morning, darling.’ His mother sat at her usual spot, cup of tea in her hands and the Daily Prophet next to her. He sat down carefully, as dainty as he could. It was still a work in progress though and he could tell from his mother’s frown that it still wasn’t the perfect, elegant motion they were trying to create.
It was quiet on the other side of the door for a few minutes, but then Harry opened the door for them, letting Draco back into their illuminated bedroom.
But Draco leaned into Harry, letting himself fall into the bed. It was awkward at first, because he half laid into the bed and half on top of Harry, but then Harry moved and pulled the duvet over the both of them, covering Draco in the welcoming heat of Harry’s bed. He sniffed up the air a little, smelling only his Alphas wonderful scent. He relaxed.
Draco hesitated for a little bit. ‘No, but if you see anything about… Harry Potter… I’m interested?’
Not in the mood for talking - his throat felt like sandpaper - he eyed Harry warily as the Alpha flitted around the kitchen, making tea, oatmeal, and finally setting down a new test in front of Draco.
“Hey, hey, take it easy.” Harry was immediately close to him, placing a gentle hand on Draco’s forearm to prevent him from sitting up. “They cut you open less than 24 hours ago. Try not to strain yourself.” The concern in his voice was touching, and Draco felt tears -
With a groan, Draco disentangled himself from the Alpha to push himself up on all fours, presenting himself to Harry for the first time in months.
O my god I can't believe I almost lost this chapter. I couldn't find it in my files so I panicked like HOLY SHIT NO WHERE IS MY CHAPTER I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I WROTE AND I HAVE TO UPLOAD TODAY NOW WHAT?
Harry's leave of absence seems to do the job; he and Draco are growing closer. What do you think about Harry reading Draco's book? About how he protected Draco from Narcissa? About how Draco slowly seems to realise that this really is his life, that there's no catch?
“I know that now.” He sounded snubby but couldn’t help it.
Hermione took Draco by the arm again and gently led him into the new memory. ‘What happened right before dinner,’ Hermione announced the memory when they had landed in Grimmauld Place once more. ‘This was right after you and Harry talked. When you and Adelaide retreated into the living room I stayed with Harry in the kitchen.’ She led Draco towards her memory-self and Harry. They were quiet for a while, until Harry broke the silence. ‘I don’t want Ginny here when Draco is here too. She’s bound to cause more trouble.’
Harry remained quiet for almost a minute, his green eyes distant and pensive. “I don’t know,” he eventually said.
‘Hmm, is that okay?’ Harry whispered against his ear. Draco moaned and pushed back against Harry’s finger. ‘More… I need more…’
With practised ease, he rolled out of Harry’s arms, swung his legs out of bed and stood up. “I’ll go make us some breakfast.”
Draco moved a little bit, so that he could peer over the edge of his duvet. ‘You are the queen of blanket forts.’
‘I wasn’t allowed to come.’ Astoria kept looking at her feet.
‘Yes.’ Harry sounded hoarse when he added, ‘I’ve never heard of a male Omega getting wet like that outside of heat.’
‘Wet for you,’ Draco nodded diligently against the crook of Harry’s neck, and he pushed back on Harry’s fingers once more. Harry gently added a third one and made a gesture Draco couldn’t quite place, until it hit home.
Draco took a few reluctant sips, finding that he felt better almost instantly. “Thank Merlin,” he croaked and he nodded thankfully at Molly, who briefly smiled.
In the meantime, negotiations for Sirius had started, and Remus and his team - consisting of Hermione and Andromeda - had taken over the kitchen pretty much permanently.
Harry sighed. “They’re never letting him out of Azkaban. It’s futile.”
“Maybe,” Draco agreed.
So they went about their day, taking the girls to the beach to play in the sand and by the water. Remus and Sirius were there too, and Remus shot Draco a meaningful look, making Draco press a finger to his own lips, gesturing for him to keep silent.
! at the same time. It couldn’t be done and he cried out again, desperate for more.
“How close…?” Harry slowly stepped forward, until Draco drew in a sharp breath.
“Riddle can be quite convincing.”
“Work, mostly. Arthur’s getting promoted to manager of his division, and Ron told me they might be hiring some new employees for the store. It’s getting busier every week and they need to spend more time making their products, which means they can’t be on the shop floor as much.” Harry’s tone was quiet but even.
And then it was gone and he could breathe again, gasping for air.
“Draco.”
‘Shall we proceed?’ Miss Parkinson did not wait for an answer as she led them towards another part of the school, inside a building and knocked on a classroom door.
‘It’s just really crazy at the ORO now and I’ve been reprimanded for not paying enough attention so I really have to focus on my job for a while,’ Harry explained.
Harry stepped out of the kitchen floo, patting his overcoat to get rid of the soot. ‘Hi, Molly,’ he greeted Mrs Weasley in a careful, almost-cool manner. They didn’t hug either, Draco noted.
. His fear had made his scent go sharp and oddly peaked.
Draco shrugged. “Not all of them. And the book explicitly stated that especially the hoarding, nesting and hostility are symptoms of this specific case. I don’t have any of those.”
‘Oh sorry!’ Neville flushed. ‘I keep forgetting that not everyone knows… I don’t think I’m supposed to tell new people though… but it was like a secret group of people that fought against a dark wizard, so… I think it’s pretty cool.’
“That’s not an answer.”
“I found my advocates,” Remus announced in a quiet, but victorious voice. “Please meet Sirius’ aunt, Andromeda Tonks.”
‘Do you think so?’ Draco mused, ‘I don’t think most Omegas know their Alpha very well at all, even when they do have children.’
Draco purred at her and tried to move closer, wanted to be cuddled. She seemed to know exactly that that was what he wanted and moved over to him, putting her arms gently around him and cradling him softly. The rocking motion made him feel even sleepier and the snuggled closer, placing his head on her shoulder and sniffing up the warm Alpha-y scent. She chuckled and stroked his back with a gentle hand. ‘Such a good boy…’ she whispered to him.
“Romantic, sure,” Draco chuckled. “I’m not opposed to it, but we have plenty of time.” He bent down a little to kiss Harry. “We don’t have to do everything at once. I’m not going to leave you in any case.”
Hermione glanced at Draco, making him laugh a little. ‘You know I’m not going to support you.’
His voice was trembling, almost accusatory. “You really think I only like you because you looked after me?”
Draco frowned. “Sorry?”
“So,” began Harry, with no real plan.

“Obviously.”
But Harry – hands on the balcony railing, getting wetter by the second – has long since stopped listening. It’s noisy out here,
“Where are you going?” Draco rolled onto his side, missing the warmth immediately.
“What? I didn’t say anything!”
It was a strange thought, having a guest in his home, when he hadn’t spoken to anyone except his mother and Collins for well over a year. It was even stranger when Draco realised that he couldn’t remember ever having an exchange with Longbottom that hadn’t ended with Draco either insulting or hexing the man.
Draco stepped closer still, boldly moving his hand upwards so that his palm rested against Harry’s chest. He followed it with his gaze, pale fingers skimming over soft black fabric, gratified at the way the rapid rise and fall underneath his hand belied Harry’s calm exterior. He tapped his fingernails lightly against the Order of Merlin. In the absolute silence between them, the clinking sound seemed amplified a thousand-fold.
Was Harry supposed to answer, he wondered? The question seemed rhetorical, but Ron had stopped talking.
Draco snorted. “Oh Merlin,

Draco turns towards him, then, one eyebrow raised curiously. “I was. Working in the States, that is. I finished my residency last month.”

A few other people were milling around the Atrium. Their shadows flitted across the walls, in and out of nooks and crannies, making Draco feel suddenly vulnerable. He peered closer, hand on his wand – but no, there were only couples, giggling and flirting. Draco could hardly bear to look at them, so he leant over the edge of the Fountain of Magical Brethren instead, staring up at the enormous golden statues sparkling above him. They reminded him, as so many things did, of

Draco laughed. “I’d have thought you were the expert on that.”

and adrenaline, but he certainly welcomed the prospect of a little quiet. He made his way out into the Atrium, past the newly renovated fountain, and over to the side of the room, where he leant against an enormous stone pillar, half out of sight. He watched as a few giggling revellers stumbled out of the party, weaving over to the bank of fireplaces on the opposite side. The whoosh of the fire took them away, and then it was quiet again, the hum of the ball distant once more.

Harry laughed. “So you do remember.”

“Malfoy!”
As Draco recounted the story, Hannah and Neville ate slowly, exchanging occasional glances. Although Neville snorted several times at their various vegetation-related disasters, by the time Draco had got to the part where Harry stormed off, his expression was one of utter exasperation.
too, you said?” the female voice cut in.
Harry let out a little huff of displeasure, and Draco smiled, his nose nudging apologetically against Harry’s fingers. “It’s not that I don’t want to, believe me. It’s just that I’m still not quite… look, my memories are still coming back, and there are things I need to figure out. Before we – you know. I want to do it properly this time. To know… to understand…” He nipped gently at the soft mounds of Harry’s palm, one by one, eliciting a long, heat-filled groan, as Harry traced his fingers down to worry at Draco’s bottom lip.
“Sorry. Sorry. I just – I wondered, is all. I thought now, after today, maybe…”
Draco felt his face flame at the unexpected mention of Harry. And worse than that, he saw the very moment Pansy noticed, her beady eyes lighting up with glee. “Oh, Merlin,” he said, dropping his head to his hands. He may not have been drinking, but he was definitely starting to feel queasy.
going home with you. Got it?”
Nervously, he scanned the street. “Nothing.”
The match ended not two minutes later, the Snitch retrieved easily by the Wasps’ Seeker, and so Draco still wore the hint of a dumb smile as Harry collected his Omnioculars and Vanished his coffee cup. It disappeared, though, when Harry made to sidle past Draco and leave without a word.

But Draco wasn’t worried. He had a good feeling about things. He didn’t need to dwell on it, and so he handed the letter to Itti and put it out of his mind, as easy as that. He got to his feet. That was enough writing for one day. It was a beautiful spring afternoon, and the Manor gardens were always beautiful at this time of year – why was he wasting time indoors?
Every year, until this year.
Behind it stood Harry, deadly still. He wore that same expression that Draco had seen when he’d loomed over Crowson, arm raised, magic crackling all around him. A calm, careful madness. A snake, poised to strike.

in the past, but been quickly caught out when they’d found it impossible not to make impulsive and dangerous choices. Not so for Draco. So far as he could tell, every big decision he’d made had been logical, with no one suspecting any external influence. He felt certain that he could recognise an unwise decision and resist it, if required.

use was a bad idea, and he knew that he was already becoming too reliant on the potion. He didn’t like the way it blurred his thought process, or the way he couldn’t quite recall events after he’d sobered up. Draco had always been a perfectionist, agonising over small decisions and replaying them in his head.
– to be this close. Close enough to see Potter’s throat work as he swallowed, to track the way his shoulders rose and fell in that awful jumper, to watch his pupils begin to dilate. One more step, and then Draco could just reach out, and― no! For Salazar’s sake, he had to keep a hold on himself!
Draco couldn’t respond. The flickering at the edge of his vision was becoming more persistent, and he was starting to feel unsteady. He slipped down onto the seat of the chair, gripping the armrests tightly.

Draco’s head snapped towards the bathroom; watched the handle turn. He held his breath as the door swung open, in slow motion, towards him.
“I wish I could have, too.”
“Potter. Come here, would you?”
Narcissa was still putting in many long hours tending the Manor gardens, single-handedly cutting and preparing the magical plants and herbs for Draco’s use, and to his relief he was finally able to start paying her a salary for her hard work. When he’d first brought up the question of payment, she’d told him not to be ridiculous, that knowing she was helping him was quite enough reward. But the thought of her venturing outside every day through the harshest winter frosts, carefully checking climate charms and pruning the plants by hand made up his mind, and he ignored her protests. Besides, he knew, she would soon need money for new robes – for, to his mother’s great satisfaction, her social life was flourishing once more. Her rose garden had attracted so much attention that the prestigious Wizarding Horticultural Society had invited her to re-join, and she’d even resumed attending small benefits and luncheons with some of her old pureblood friends. Draco was pleased for her – hosting parties had once been her raison d’être – but knew very well what the other society witches were like: one tiny whiff that she might be in financial difficulties and she’d be ignored, ridiculed, or banished back to her lonely existence at the Manor. So Draco made sure that there was a steady flow of Galleons arriving each week, that Itti sent him the bills for any repair work on the house, and, as far as he could, that she wasn’t working too hard.
“What?”
He turns, then, and Harry almost wishes he hadn’t. His face is flushed, but it’s not the delicate crimson blush, high on his cheekbones, which Harry usually delights in; instead, it’s an ugly, blotchy redness, as though he’s been crying, or close to. His eyes themselves are cold and distant, shining like burnished steel, and his lips are pressed together so tightly Harry could swear they were trembling.

The door closed. Gentle footsteps padded closer, and a cool cloth was pressed to his brow. Water dripped down into his hair, seeping unpleasantly into the sheets.
“Yeah. I – I was walking past. Saw the For Sale board and – well, you know.”
He kissed the top of Harry’s head next, smiled again as he rubbed his face into the mess of curls. “You―” he poked Harry in the chest, his words muffled against Harry’s scalp “―

“Oi,” Harry protested weakly.
She had a point, Hermione supposed, watching, mesmerised, as the shadowy figure floated closer into view. His eyes were wide, two pools of molten silver fixed on her own, and his face was consumed by utter panic. Here, then, was the
“Trust me, you can’t miss Lee.” Draco replied, drinking his lemonade and peering through the dense crowds. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted Hermione, and opposite her – was that Harry? He willed the people in the way to move, as he leaned closer to get a better look…
Charmed by the way his given name sounded coming from Potter’s mouth, Draco hastened to reassure him. “It’s not.” He deftly caught Potter’s sleeve before it could slip out of his grasp. “But I need to know, what about you, Potter – Harry? Did you come here alone? What about what’s-his-face, that American guy?”

“What? Draco? Oh, no, he didn’t say anything.”
“I – I’d really like that, too.”

Draco swallowed, thickly. The irony of it all was painful.
was bound to throw up some logistical complications. Shortly after she started, Draco had popped out to Gringotts at the end of the day, leaving Lee cleaning the lab. When he got back, long past closing time, he found her stuck in a loop; she’d head towards the bench where Draco kept the
“You fucker! Bat-Bogey, really? Your ex’s favourite, if I remember correctly.”
But Apparating based on a description was wildly inaccurate at the best of times, and that, combined with Draco’s nerves and the bloody great pot he was holding, sent him dizzy and stumbling straight into Neville’s marble coffee table, ceramic crashing loudly against glass.  Chaos reigned briefly as half the guests were forced to jump backwards, while others shrieked, and several dropped their glasses. Draco himself bounced back from the table, wobbled precariously and landed directly on his arse, with the coiled tree trunk coming to rest over his damp, soil-covered lap a moment later.
good; so impossibly, ridiculously relaxing. Malfoy drifted closer, his broom knocking against Harry’s, until Harry could sense Malfoy’s body directly behind his own. He wanted so desperately to lean back, to feel Malfoy’s arms come around him, to bury his fingers in that silky hair, to meet those clever lips with his own… Harry couldn’t help himself – he closed his eyes and pictured it, as Malfoy’s fingertips moved around his sides, lingering over the bare skin where his top had ridden up, making Harry tingle with…
She was right – over the next few days, Draco’s lucid intervals lengthened. He was able to keep food down, to stand up without feeling dizzy, and even to sit out in his armchair for short periods. Hannah stayed with him, always there, making food and walking beside him to the toilet.
“It’s all right for you, mate! You’re – well―” Seamus tailed off, waggling his eyebrows in an exaggerated manner.
Potter glanced at Neville, gauging his reaction. Neville merely snorted.
Even if he did manage to wriggle his way out of significant prison time, he couldn’t envisage a future that he considered even
Around them the countryside stretched out as far as the eye could see. Wildflower meadows, recently-shorn fields of wheat, and right in the middle the one enormous hill, rising steeply from the surrounding grasslands. And carved into the side of it, a giant, fuck-off white horse.

An angry shout across the street makes them both look up; a bus speeds away through a deep puddle, leaving a dripping wet couple yelling in its wake. Harry gathers his courage as he watches them shake themselves off. “It was your idea,” he blurts out. He’s never told anyone that before; it feels strange to say it out loud. “The brooms. Do you remember?”
Draco awaited his response: contempt, anger or pity?
“Coming back here… it was an exchange, at first. The Ministry requested my assistance with a case involving a few of my dad’s old friends. I was supposed to go back after six months but… well, let’s just say that by then I had a few good reasons to stay.”
But Neville wasn’t finished. “I’m not sure you do, though. If you did, you wouldn’t have said what you did last night. Honestly―”
“Of course.” Draco extended his hand next to the table. “Pleased to meet you, Neville. Call me Draco.” After only a second’s hesitation, Neville unfolded his arms, reached out and clasped Draco’s outstretched hand. He shook it firmly.
“You did?”
“Sure. I’ve got the dry ingredients on the shelves to the left, wet ones, as you can see, are in the different containers to the right. Volatile stuff is under a

“It wasn’t a fling,” Draco echoes, sitting forwards to tug his top over his head, helping Harry to do the same. They undress each other piece by piece, deliberately: Harry’s belt, threaded back through the loops; his socks, peeled off one by one; his fingers shaking, fumbling over the knot of Draco’s baggy hospital trousers. Finally, they’re both naked, hands sliding over familiar puckered scars, pressing into the soft flesh of hips and thighs, tracing down the curve of a spine. Mapping out the contours of each other’s body. Memorising.
Pansy tutted impatiently. “Oh, come on, Draco. Did you shag Potter or not?”

He reached for the clotted cream. “I’m taking an Advanced Potions Diploma.”
, there were men. Muggle men, lots of them, and I―” He paused, the very words so repulsive that his breath caught in his throat as he struggled to force them out. “Well, how can I ever know if they really wanted me – it – or not?  It makes me sick to think of it, Harry. I can’t remember most of them, even now. I suppose it’s like Lee said, I can’t bear to try. So if anyone should be ashamed – if anyone took advantage – it was me.”
Draco tried to push his discomfort – and his craving for a little

“Look, Harry barely trusted anyone before all this, and then he thought there was something real between you, and it turned out that you’d been lying to him the whole time. And he couldn’t get angry with you, because you were really ill, and none of us even knew if you’d recover. He refused to take you to St Mungo’s – he was supposed to be out on some important job that weekend too, he had to lie to Kingsley about being sick so he could look after you – and you can’t even remember all the time you spent together when you were on
“I promise.” It came out as hardly a whisper.
Harry and Ron’s stunt seemed to have worked; rather than displaying outright hostility, most people appeared merely discomfited by Draco’s presence, with crowds parting in front of him as wix old and young shuffled back to avoid his touch. He spent a little while hiding behind a carefully pruned lilac tree, hand discreetly covering his nose as he stared at the dancing couples. When the glares became too much, he wandered out to the ‘balconies’, admiring the way the enormous false windows were charmed to display beautiful evening garden scenes, complete with breeze and bird-song. He managed to catch up with Neville and Hannah, who introduced him to a group of Hannah’s Healer friends, including, he realised, with amusement, Will, Harry’s date from the
“Harry. Mate. You’re going to have to deal with it yourself, alright? I’m not interested in that quasi-American floppy-haired prick right now. D’you want to know what
“Easy decision,” repeated Harry uncertainly.
“Bit him on the arse?” suggested Draco, wryly.
Their cackling and wheezing continued for several minutes, while Draco glowered quietly, considering the merits of throwing them both out on their ears. Finally, Lee looked up grumpily from her cauldron, which was spitting turquoise foam all over the workbench. “Look, I’m really trying to learn here. In case you didn’t realise, I missed out on your years of lessons in this stuff. If you’re just in here to gossip, could you go out to the shop please?”
dark. Something felt off. Wasn’t there normally a streetlight outside? Feeling uneasy, he closed his eyes again, fervently seeking the comforting blanket of sleep.
Judging by past experience, he had maybe thirty minutes before the withdrawal symptoms would get so severe that he’d be rendered absolutely useless, and probably incapable of speech. And then what would happen? Maybe he’d be locked up and never see Harry again. Maybe Harry would simply leave him there to waste away on his living room floor. Had Harry always known about the
tasteful, if a little on-the-nose. And it’s beautifully done too – the texture of the mane, the movement? Could’ve been a lot worse.”
It must have been written all over his face, because as he began moving towards Harry, Ron stepped forwards, thrusting an arm out between them. He clasped Draco’s hand with a tight, “Settle down, children,” which had Draco blushing, pumping it forcefully up and down in an enthusiastic show. He was wearing a wide smile, which was slightly strained and clearly for the benefit of the bystanders.
“You know damn well it is.”
, alcohol, and arousal coursing through his bloodstream, hyper-aware of every place Harry’s warm body pressed against his. He ran his hands lightly up and down Harry’s muscled thighs, his arms, his back, picturing trails of coloured sparks following the movement of his fingers. He felt untethered, transcendent, floating away on dizzy golden clouds of desire and joy and sheer, utter contentment. After some time – minutes? hours? – their kisses started to increase in intensity again. Draco felt his cock stirring, desire relighting that fire deep in his belly, a tingling sensation which spread throughout his body. Harry shifted above him, pulling back to meet his gaze.
. You’re no fun at all!”
She patted him on the arm. “Of course. Go easy on him, though. He’s not had a great evening so far.”
Crowson was on the grass, bent double with coughing and belching, slugs crawling over the ground next to him. He lifted his head, looked at Draco with loathing and spat a slug towards him. With a sneer of disgust, he shouted over his shoulder. “Seriously, Potter? What, are we fifteen?”
this, Harry wonders. Always pushing him away, always nagging him about this or that, when all Harry wants is to be close to him! “This time?” he pouts. “What’s that supposed to mean? And who are you – McGonagall, come to check up on me after curfew? I just had a couple, Draco, for God’s sake. Just a few shots with Seamus and the boys. Lighten

an option.
Yes, once upon a time, he’d felt truly missed. Pansy – allowed back at Hogwarts to repeat her seventh year – would send long, rambling letters; pages and pages of gossip he didn’t really want about people he didn’t really remember, studiously omitting any mention of the war. Greg’s owl had brought short, melancholic notes from Spain, where he was living with family friends and working as a magical housebuilder. Blaise’s missives had been frequent and hilarious, filled with convoluted tales about his mother’s latest conquests. Draco had even received a couple of – late night, and obviously drunken – messages from Theo, filled with a truly stomach-churning mix of wistfulness and pity.
“No,” said Draco quickly. “No, look, I just need one more minute. I’ll be fine. Thanks, though.” He blinked, embarrassed. Harry straightened.
. It was as though he’d been fighting to keep up a
He snorted. “I
Draco’s smile widens; spreads slowly across his face. The faint crinkles around his eyes deepen, and from this close, Harry can see more lines appear at the edges of his mouth. He aches to touch them; to trace over them with his fingers. With his lips.
Draco stretches; untucks those long, elegant legs, unwinds their fingers slowly. “I guess I’ll see you soon then.” He stands, looking down at Harry curiously. “Hey, don’t forget to add me to your wards – if you really do want me to Floo-call, that is.”
Draco leant into him, then, shivering at both the heat behind Harry’s words and his breath against Draco’s neck. He turned, grazing their lips together lightly, letting out a gasp when Harry returned the kiss with force. Intent began to build quickly once more as Harry sent the table skidding across the floor with a wave of his hand and moved to straddle Draco. He held back for a second, clearly gauging Draco’s mood, and Draco tugged him back in, rolling his hips forwards in an obvious invitation.
It was a Bludger that woke him in the end, a strange whooping noise ending with a gentle knock against Harry’s shoulder. He cracked open one eye to see Malfoy’s waning
Harry ushered him over towards the wall, leaning in close, his voice low and gentle. “Look, Draco, it’s okay. No one’s forcing you to do this. Let’s just get out of here, alright?”
, it would all be over soon anyway. He reached around, wiping the gathering sweat from the back of his neck.
“I know,” Draco said, insistently. “I know. But just let me tell you, now. The truth – the way I feel. Let me tell you all of it, Harry, before I lose my nerve, okay?”
“Jesus.”
, something actually edible! Nice work, sober Harry, he thinks, poking a hole in the bag of potato smileys, pouring out a generous helping of the little round faces onto a tray. They’ll need cooking, he realises, glancing over at the cold oven. Good thing he’s a wizard, right? He doesn’t need to wait!
“How?”
“Fine.”
As he watched, Malfoy extended his arm, lazily, dipping his fingers into the lake. Concentric circles spread rapidly outwards, perfectly even, the water lapping at the shore with tiny splashing sounds. Malfoy was frowning, worrying at his bottom lip again, so Harry took hold of his other hand and brought it up to his face. Malfoy’s hand shivered against his mouth, and he pressed a gentle kiss to the palm, feeling them then: tiny sparks of magic, trapped beneath the skin.

Blaise rolled his eyes. 'And still, you only care about your own comfort,' he muttered, finally gesturing for Draco to sit down. Draco sat down, interested in what Blaise was about to say despite feeling as if he wasn't ready to hear it. 'Have you, for one moment, thought about someone other than yourself? That not everyone is as privileged as you and has the ministry in their daddy's pocket?'
Hermione got that determined glint in her eyes that Harry realized all too late that spelled trouble.

Satisfied, she bid them goodnight and left them be.
'It's not like there was anything else I could do,' Harry huffed, sinking back down into his chair in the Gryffindor common room. It was the day after the arrival of the other schools, and Harry hadn't had the heart to tell Hermione and Ron what had happened yesterday, with their obvious excitement over talking to Viktor and Blaise, respectively.

Neither of them got to talk much further on what had happened since Neville, Dean, and Seamus dropped in on their compartment as they progressed towards the Hogsmead station, though Hermione and Ron were less than pleased if their looks were any indication.

'What?'
'Easy for you to say, when the person you've been pining after since third year admits they like you back,' Pansy said. Hermione choked on her laughter. Harry, beside her, resisted the urge to pinch himself.

Harry thought, almost bursting into laughter as he realized that Ginny had shuddered exactly as he had from across him.
'Okay, that's it,' Blaise said abruptly from where he was seated next to Ron, who looked red-faced at the proximity. 'Care to explain what's going on, Potter? You've been twitchy as fuck ever since we left you at Hogsmeade.'
Harry rose an eyebrow. 'Didn't think you'd be so easy to convince,' he lied. From overhearing Malfoy's conversation with Blaise, he knew
Harry set down the paper with a smile, a tentative beginning of a plan in his mind for the first time.
Draco was abruptly drawn back to the present by Crabbe's words. He forced a smile on his face and said, 'I was thinking of the Triwizard Tournament, that's all.'

Blaise patted him gently on the back. 'You know she's right, amore,' he said, the nickname sending Ron into a coughing fit so hard that Harry wasn't certain whether he should intervene. Hermione was smothering a chuckle behind her hands, and the others didn't look much better, so Harry just let them be, shooting a concerned look at his best friend who didn't seem to be recovering any time soon.

It was with renewed determination that Harry tried, in vain, to forget about Malfoy.

They were at the Room of Requirement, in a room that seemed to resemble both the Slytherin and Gryffindor common rooms at the same time - comfortable, black sofas that you could sink yourself into and never want to come back up, a log fire crackling merrily away on the corner, and the feeling of comfort that Harry only got from the Gryffindor common room. Though the Slytherins would say otherwise, probably.
The Slytherins rolled their eyes, eerily in sync. Harry decided to just shut up.
Pansy rolled her eyes. 'Don't look so alarmed, Potter,' she said. 'I just spelled her bag so it would be lighter to carry, that's all.' She took off at a brisk pace towards the Arithmancy classroom on the ground floor, Harry, Hermione, and Zabini struggling to catch up after her.
As they seated themselves on their tables, he saw the Durmstrang students were visibly struggling to choose a house table to sit at. The twins, saving them the trouble, waved them over to the Gryffindor table where they didn't hesitate to sit down.

'Master Draco! Dobby has missed you, even though he doesn't miss Master Lucius much - ' Dobby's ears quivered and he raised a hand to involuntarily slap himself before resisting with a conscious effort. Looking at him, Draco wondered whether the house-elves, the existence of which he had taken for granted was to help wixen - deserved something more than the servile position they'd been reduced to all their lives.
Hermione rolled her eyes at them both, but Harry could see the soft gleam in her eyes that she couldn't hide.

Harry and Hermione, wide-eyed, nodded vigorously.

The next day dawned bright and early without any incidents from either Fred or George, which Harry couldn't help but be surprised by. He could feel the thrum of excitement in his head, his heartbeat almost mimicking the words
He also suspects it might be a bit more than that.
"So, nothing's changed?" Draco rasps through a sip of firewhiskey straight from the bottle.
As long as Draco never finds out, everything will be fine. The Gala will happen, Harry won't attend, and then either Draco will be so furious about coming to Grimmauld Place every day for no gain that he’ll never come back, or he'll stop coming by, anyway, as soon as he doesn’t need Harry anymore.
a long time ago, but I know enough to know you're not exactly skint, Malfoy."
"Well, I've never done that before," Harry sighs happily.
"Go on then," Harry says, looking into light eyes and trusting. "No more waiting."
"Filch? You mean to say that's...
"Will you just use a fucking coaster?" Harry explodes, unable to hold back any longer.
Snorting, Draco says, "As if I'd worry about offending your delicate sensibilities. Seriously, coffee?"
“I’m not lying!” Draco says, indignant. After a few moments, his face falls. “Nothing is wrong, per se.”
"You're welcome." Harry mumbles, yawning and moving closer to Draco, because he can. "Hermione would kill me for this but I don't think I can get up yet, so do you think—"
"I know what you meant."
What he does feel is an irrational pang of guilt. It's not as if Draco cares much anyway, though, right? Not as if he plans on doing anything other than leaving in a few moments and never coming here again?
“I,” Draco begins, and is cut off by Harry’s mouth on his. “I won’t argue,” he tries again, when the mouth moves to his neck.
"You do realise that coming here every day is interrupting my own schedule?" Harry points out one day.
Harry stays in the kitchen and fries up an egg and some bacon for himself, singing under his breath absentmindedly. When he finally catches what song he’s been singing, he’s not sure if he should laugh or punch a wall.
"I don't expect you to do anything, Malfoy. I don't want your help! I never asked you to come here. I don't want you. Today is hard enough without having you sitting here and asking me stupid questions!" Harry yells, knocking his chair back and scrambling to his feet. Staring down at the other man, Harry is seconds away from punching him in the face.
Setting a plate of eggs and bacon down in front of Malfoy, Harry sits back and watches his food being consumed as if by a starving man.
"You're almost outside. Just a couple of steps and you'd be in the grounds; it's probably safer out there than it is in here, listening to sinfully boring old people telling you how they made their fortune in the insurance business."
"You look at me a lot," Harry informs him, and he means it to come out as a question, but instead it sounds like a statement. He stares into Draco's perfect perfect eyes and those eyes stare back and Harry wants to grab him and hold on forever.
A thought comes into Harry's head, with it the ammunition to get Malfoy to leave, maybe even for good; Harry won't have to go to the Gala and Draco will go back to hating him. Harry sets his jaw. "No surprises that you're good at fixing cabinets, eh, Malfoy?"
He says, raising his voice several pitches too high and putting on the most obnoxious tone he can manage so early in the morning.
"I meant—"
Draco laughs. “I’m joking,” he says, leaning closer and kissing Harry with coffee-flavoured mouth. “You can’t get rid of me now.”
His old life of sitting around all day, reading books with only Hermione, and rarely Ginny, for company. Harry sighs, and his thoughts go to Ron. He hasn't written back since Harry's last letter, a medium-length one that he wrote in reply to Ron’s five-line note, and the thought makes Harry want to cry—although that could just be the panic attack that is sure to come at some point, now that he's been outside of his house and surrounded by other people again.
"I'm going to need you well rested in time for the twenty-fifth, you know." Draco informs him, standing next to where Harry sits on the counter. "Which means you should probably stop wandering around the house in the middle of the night."
Though, that is a good question.
Taking his fogging glasses off, Harry looks back at Malfoy, who is sitting close enough to not be too blurry. "Forgive me if I don't go into details, Malfoy, but don't worry, it was a one-time, circumstantial kind of thing. I'm not immortal, if that's what you're worried about."
Hermione purses her lips, though Harry suspects that the annoyance isn’t for him. “That isn’t a question.”
.” Malfoy snaps, “Of course. My secretary is—never mind that, Potter. I demand that you give him back to me at once. Get your own owl.”
using my own name to make me feel uncomfortable," Harry opines. "You always manage to make it sound like something rude.
Settling down beside him, Draco laughs, although it's not very funny. "Did you expect to?"
And there’s Ginny, with her red hair and her curves and her fighting spirit that was never what he needed.
Regret clouds Malfoy’s face. Harry looks away. "I meant that... well, literally. Not as an insult. I
"That's not very nice," Draco says, as if they’re friends and this is amiable banter, rather than Harry very slowly climbing down from the Ladder of Homicide Contemplation. "And if you let me in, I'll tell you."
“How do you know how I take my coffee?"
Feeling like the world’s biggest fool, Harry leans back against the chair and sniffs.
“I’ll come in,” Harry says, “And I’ll explain why Draco is here. But you go, first. I’d like to know why I haven’t even heard from you in ages.”
Unguided feet carry Harry into Sirius’ room, a place he refrains from going on every other day. It hurts. He studies the faces in pictures on the wall of Muggle women that Sirius put up to annoy his parents, and the smiles of Sirius, Remus, James, and Wormtail. Unconsciously, Harry pulls a sour-faced look of disgust at seeing the rat there, among people Harry loves.
"Fuck you, Potter."
Merlin, it’s unlike anything, seeing Draco wrapping around him like that—it’s better than any sex he’s ever had, and he needs to have it forever.
"Yes,” Harry agrees, flashing a wide smile, “I walked up your drive and everything.”
Harry nods, standing up to get more coffee. Ron doesn’t want anything to do with him, then. Well, fine. Great. Harry doesn’t need him, anyway.
Harry doesn’t realise that he’s holding his breath until Draco clears his throat beside him. He attempts a deep breath; it comes out sharp and jagged.
And Harry is okay with that. He has to be. What other option does he have, anyway?
They talk idly about Hermione for a long time after that, until Harry’s been through another cup of coffee and his stomach is grumbling unpleasantly. He kicks Malfoy out of the house so that he can make breakfast for himself—because like hell is he going to cook for that git—and when Malfoy leaves and Harry looks at the time, he’s surprised to see how long they’d gotten along for.
Instead of talking about the Gala, Malfoy inquires, "Have you just got up?"
"No more so than usual. Actually, a little more so than usual. I'm not depressed, you know. I'm not like this every day, as you may have noticed, seeing as you've spent more time with me this week than everyone else put together. It's a bad day today. It's a hard day. On this day, I spend more time than usual debating the wisdom of that decision... the rest of the time, I just live with the consequences."
Harry inches closer, slowly because his mind is sluggish, not because he's thinking much about the situation.
A few women walk through the entrance hall, and Draco practically trips over him in attempt to step farther away. It's too late, of course; the women have noticed them and walked away giggling.
Harry glances up, scowling. "That's not fair."
Shrewdly deciding that it’s best not to think of wanking while being talked at by Draco Malfoy, Harry forces his mind to change topics. Idly, he notices that Malfoy takes his coffee the same way he had in sixth year, and still holds it the way only he ever has: rested in the palm of his hand, cradled by fingers.
"So you are still..."
"I know about Sirius Black," Malfoy says quietly, and Harry’s heart stops for a moment. His head shoots up and he watches Malfoy suspiciously.
Malfoy turns, smirking slightly. Harry hasn’t been this furious in a while.
After a few minutes of awkward silence, Harry decides to clear up and misconceptions from the night before. "You know," he says, and even he can hear how falsely casual his voice is, "I was pretty drunk last night. Probably talking a load of rubbish, I usually do. Not that I get drunk very often, but... yeah. Anything I did was just really... you should probably just ignore anything I said, or did, because—"
“I...” Harry says, then starts over: “He hasn’t been replying to my letters.”
"What the hell am I supposed to do, then?" Draco shouts, clutching the edge of the table hard.
"Show-off," Harry says, without infliction.
He looks gorgeous, black dress robes clinging to his lithe frame perfectly, silver lining bringing out the light grey of his eyes. Light blond hair is styled more than it usually is, and there’s a slightly pink colour to his cheeks that could be excitement or anticipation or both.
Malfoy sighs and puts his cup down. Harry finds himself annoyingly relieved—he really is going to hurt himself one day holding it the way he does."It's not about the money. It's about... let's call it damage control, for the Malfoy name. My parents are in France, so it's quite literally left to me. Don't think that I haven't exhausted every other option over the last two years," Malfoy says, studying his hands, and Harry has a feeling that he doesn’t talk about this much, to anyone. He wonders if Malfoy has any friends left. "Unfortunately, it turns out that charitable work for little children is the only thing that garners any respect for a Malfoy these days, and believe me, it's grudging."
The other day, Harry had read to him from an old book on Muggle diseases, and Draco had been so thoroughly confused that Harry had to stop multiple times in fits of laughter.
"Voldemort," Harry says, barely resisting rolling his eyes.
They make easy small talk for a few minutes, with how are you-s and nice to meet you-s, and then Harry, seized with a sudden idea, murmurs, "So how long have you known Draco for?"
"They're Muggles, Malfoy. They can't just drink a skin-regrowing potion and be done with it."
When Harry feels Draco move up to lie next to him, he opens his eyes and can’t resist a grin.
"I don't. Shut up. And I'm not coming to your Gala, so tell Janice I'm sorry she wasted her time," Harry says grumpily.
it, anyway,” Harry stumbles, slightly embarrassed at his own incoherency. “It was in my house, lying on my carpets and drinking my coffee and reading my—Ginny's magazines, and torturing my cat.” Harry takes a deep breath, tries not to mess this up like he has with everything else, watches a shell-shocked Draco, and needs him to understand: “And I... was a bit of an idiot."
*****
"You've already walked all the way up the drive," Draco calls out.
"Maybe that's because you never go anywhere. You don't have a chance to get tired properly."
"No."
"Great. Now they'll have something to talk about." Harry allows himself to scrub at his face with sweaty hands. "I'm going home."
Harry presumes he’s lacking more sleep than he thought, and snorts quietly. "Blanket ban on the 'Potter' while you're in my house,
“When would you say your house elves have been most content?”
When he moves over to the coffee machine, Hermione asks from behind him, "Where's Draco?"
"I died," Harry says without meaning to, voice gravelly. Anxiously, he runs his hands through his hair. No one knows that. Not even Hermione knows that.
"I 'spect all kinds of horrible things these days. Safer that way," Harry says, reserve going out the window as he holds out his cup for more firewhiskey.
“I think I’ve found the something.”
Malfoy snorts and steps closer. "You're rubbish at Silencing Charms. And you always forget them when you're angry!"
Harry opens his mouth, closes it again; he frowns, a cleft appearing between his eyebrows.
"I know. I heard you," Draco says, and Harry’s heart plummets. That would make sense, considering Hermione’s expression after she’d come back into the kitchen with more packages on Wednesday. Damn it, that had been why she’d called him an idiot! Draco must have overheard everything: how Harry had said he didn’t want Draco to come back, and had never wanted him in the first place.
Harry sighs, straightens his uncomfortable dress robes, and steps into the fire. Distantly familiar whooshing fills his ears, and Harry shuts his eyes tight as green flames dance around him.
“Is this a relationship?”
"Draco?"
Draco laughs, squeezing the life out of Harry's hand on the carpet. Harry finds he doesn't mind a bit.
"It's good air, I assure you," Draco claims, and Harry snorts.
"With me, then,” Draco says after a few moments, holding out his arm. Harry bites his lip but grabs it, nerves speeding his movement. "If you want to splinch yourself, be my guest. You can't Apparate out of here... at the moment.”
For the first time since the War ended, he feels like he belongs in the outside world.
"Care to elaborate?" Malfoy asks, glancing up from the floor and staring at Harry with wide, grey eyes that are devoid of anything less than kindness. "I know it's me and everything, but it rather seems like a good opportunity. And I shan't lie to you, I am curious."
*****
"I try not to think about it," is Malfoy’s whispered response.
"I don't know, Draco, I wouldn't want to over-stimulate you. Who knows what could happen?" Harry says sarcastically, taking his favourite seat in the living room and putting on his most convincing scowl.
“Sounds great, Malfoy. Ready to leave my house yet?”
Opening his letter, Harry smiles.
If he does, Harry has decided that he'll go to the Gala.
Harry yawns into his arms, pushing away his own plate of food though it’s scarcely eaten.
And not like expensive cologne, either, but like
Harry shakes his head hard, "Nope. Nooo. No thank you."
“You look terrified,” Draco helpfully points out, and Harry glares. He had looked a little ruffled when they left the house before, but he didn’t actually think anyone would
“You knew they'd take pictures," Draco slurs slightly, "It was a... you know. A gonefore conclusion."
Harry shrugs. “Most of the things she cares about are a bit… strange. House elf rights and werewolf legislation acts and evil cats are all part of who she is, really.”
"I thought I might get a reprieve since it's the weekend," Harry informs him, yawning into his hands and running a hand through soft-spiky hair.
*****
Harry finishes for him, and his chest constricts.
"What?" Harry asks, trying not to snap at her again.
Hermione purses her lips and looks at him deliberately. "Aren't we?"
"No more so than anyone else," Malfoy admits, and when he looks up, their eyes meet and hold for a few long moments. Malfoy has nice eyes, Harry notices absently.
"You do that." Malfoy says, bones cracking as he pushes off the ground to get up. It's very interesting, Harry decides, seeing Malfoy less than graceful. He thinks that maybe he likes the change. It reminds him less of school-Malfoy.
Harry freezes.
"When you call me Potter. No one calls me Potter. No one's called me Potter since I was at school. I feel like I'm about to be called on to answer a question about Shrivelfig extract or given detention," Harry elaborates, scrunching up his nose and thinking back to unpleasant teachers and blond Slytherins that, in the past, would have rather fed themselves to a werewolf than ask him for a favour.
Without thinking much of what he’s going to say, Harry blurts out: "That I see it."
Harry grabs a shopping bag and heads for the cabinets; he really isn't in the mood for bloody Hermione and her game of twenty questions.
"I'm not doing this for the good of my health, you know,” Malfoy scowls. “It's a necessity. In that it is necessary for you to attend this Gala, so that I might keep my position at the Trust, which is also... necessary." Evidently, even Malfoy can hear that fault in that argument; he frowns, looking slightly aggrieved.
"Did you even read them?" Harry hears as he busies himself with the coffee maker.
The sound of his name said like that, so open and vulnerable and unsure, makes Harry raise his head. He doesn't know what he's expecting though, and Draco only looks at him, apparently at a loss for words.
"I hate giving speeches," Harry murmurs, tapping his fingers absently under Draco's, still together on the carpet. He spends a few moments thinking more about it, but knows that in the end, he'll go. Of course he'll go. Draco needs him there. "Okay. But that's it. I'm not staying for the whole thing. And I hate Flooing, but... that's what we're going to have to do."
Harry takes the seat opposite Malfoy at the table, resting tall mugs of coffee in front of them both. "What would be the point? You'd only come back anyway."
******
Harry looks away again.
Harry hopes that she stays there. Or, better yet, that she comes out and attacks the man currently standing, unbelievably, in his entrance hall.
"Cooking again, Potter?”
When the first knock rings through Grimmauld Place the next day, Harry is honestly shocked. He knows that he shouldn’t be. He shouldn’t even be surprised. But he had been sure that Malfoy—and it definitely is Malfoy, anyone else who ever visited would have a key—wouldn’t come back, sure that he’d scared Malfoy off with the mention of his time in Malfoy Manor. Granted, he hadn’t meant to make the comment sting, it was only supposed to be a statement of fact. The way Malfoy had received it, however, made Harry think it had been taken that way.
Flurrying around on the stove, Harry mutters, "I'm not tense," and worries that his voice is showing otherwise. Or the tight line of his shoulders. Or the way his hands tremble slightly from all the caffeine surging through his system.
Harry frowns. That sounds suspiciously like his dream last night. He really needs a new set of fantasies.
And, really, Harry has no right to feel bad, because it’s his fault for staying locked up in his house. But Ron had left him during the Triwizard Tournament, and in the forest before the end of the war, and now…
Then, just when Harry's decided on a way to politely interrupt Her Highness, say goodbye to Draco, and make a hasty exit without speaking to anyone else, he hears an aged voice behind him.
"No. Filch died about six months ago, and nobody else wanted her. Hermione ended up with her at first; you know how she is," Harry explains, examining his own hands. "That didn't last long, though; Ron's a bit touchy about cats... long story," he says, looking at Malfoy, waiting for some response.
But he won't. It would only complicate things.
Harry watches Draco read the letter, studying his shoulders and jawline as Esme nips at his ears. He finds himself staring idly at Draco's left arm as it holds the letter, wondering about the Mark that is no doubt hidden underneath Draco's clothing. Inexplicably, Harry wants to lift Draco’s sweater off of him and see it; in fact, he wants to take
“You don't look too hot yourself, Malfoy," Harry growles, more out of need for retort than anything. Although truthfully, Malfoy didn't look too well, either. 'Distressed' would be a good word to describe him this morning. And ‘malnourished,’ but that’s nothing new.
Harry thinks of what Sirius would say if he could see him now. He thinks that maybe he doesn't want to know. Remus would understand.
"I brought your cat back, and... it's not important." Draco shakes his head.
Draco shakes his head slowly, and Harry’s heart sinks. If Draco doesn’t know how to handle this, either, there’s no way it will work out.
******
“That’s why you always looked starved, then?” Harry wonders. “I’m sure you could buy a better house elf if you wanted.”
Harry rises from his seat and moves into what he’s dubbed Draco’s Favourite Armchair. But it doesn’t smell like him anymore.
. "Come on," he urges, prodding Harry with his foot, "let's go down to the kitchen; you can make some decent coffee and I'll see if I can persuade Klinky that the danger has passed and he can come out of the pantry."
"Oh." Harry withdraws his fingers from the Dark Mark and rolls onto his back, staring at his fake sky. He could go outside and look at the stars that way, he could lay in the street with Draco and they could see the real sky—
It makes more sense this way. It's for the best, he mentally repeats, and the words have lost all meaning.
As Harry busies himself making coffee, Draco begins an ongoing rant about his parents, house elf, and job. Harry finds himself listening.
“Talking forever is better than being brutally murdered by my boss!” Malfoy informs him, composure cracking. Harry notes that Malfoy’s composure done that a lot today. He hopes it’s because Malfoy feels uncomfortable being here.
“Any chance of a coffee?" Draco asks softly, "Without firewhisky in it?"
"I don't see why I should have you invading my privacy
"I needed some air, oddly enough," he says, as Draco comes up next to him in the doorway.
There’s no way Draco will let him in, not after he had been kicked out so rudely.
Draco flashes him a smile, and Harry's heart soars. "I'm glad you came back," Harry says, grinning. "I wanted to show you something."
“So what’s wrong, then?” He questions, and Draco looks up from the table, startled.
He glances at Draco lying next to him, and his breath catches in his throat. The smiling, closed-eye expression on Draco's face is one of relief, appreciation, and beauty. Harry wishes that look could last forever.
Oh. They had been friends, recently, talking and laughing and smiling, but...
Draco pulls away, and Harry blinks at him, mind fogged by desire. Fuck, but Draco looks good with his lips swollen and his eyes almost black with lust. Grabbing his hand, Draco tugs him inside, and the warmth is more than welcome.
"So... that's it?" Draco asks.
"You can't really?" Draco inquires, following him and sitting down at his now designated spot at Harry’s kitchen table.
"Didn't know you cared, Potter," Draco murmurs, and Harry turns back to see a smirk lifting his lips.
"No waiting," Draco repeats, and presses his mouth to Harry's.
"It is if it's working. Now be quiet, unless you'd like to hear about how Grendel from the Weird Sisters 'got her look'."
When he emerges from the fire at Malfoy Manor, he's shaking uncontrollably.
Hermione.
Sunday has always been Harry’s favourite day to receive mail, mostly because it reminds him of Uncle Vernon having a panic attack. One Sunday, he and Draco are sitting in the living room when a scrawny owl flies in through a window in the room he’d taken Draco in to get Esme on that first day and settles on the coffee table in front of them.
“Yes,” Hermione says, not raising her head from the page she’s ostensibly reading, “But you never felt the need to honour that before.”
"Where did you hear that song?"
*****
"Well, that's disturbing. You won't sign one little piece of paper to say you'll attend a Gala because you hate me, but you're cooking for me?" Malfoy says, as if it’s that easy.
Also when Malfoy comes downstairs later, it will be their last conversation. When he leaves it will be for good.
“Don’t give me that bullshit!” Harry rages, blood boiling as what Draco is saying sinks in. “Of course you had a choice. We always have choices.”
"Thought not.” Draco sighs. “There will be people in the park, you realise that?"
"Well, tell me, then, before we both freeze to death," Draco says, arching an eyebrow and folding his arms. Christ, he looks so good. Harry only hopes that he can get Draco to smile again.
And strangely, Harry finds himself, for the first time, wanting to talk about those moments. It had always seemed terrifying, opening up, confessing what had happened in the Forbidden Forest that night; Harry had considered it something that he would keep to himself, a burden that didn’t need to be shared with other people. There had been several occasions, in the first few months following the war, when Harry had almost told Ron and Hermione. But each time, he had decided against it. In those days, it was because the risk of the
"You don't have people to trust?" Malfoy clarifies, sounding like he understands.
"Thanks, you too,” Harry mumbles, leaning closer. Then, because he needs to hear it: “No more waiting.”
Harry snorts, "Yeah right, Malfoy. That might be more believable if you weren't spending all of your precious time getting attacked by my cat.”
Harry continues putting food away while Hermione retrieves the other packages. She’s picked up his favourite coffee, which is a relief, but Harry finds himself less happy about it now that there’s no one to share it with.
"Who do you think you are, my mother?" Malfoy snipes, “And anyway, you've no business telling me I need to eat, have you seen yourself?"
"Have to be. Call-girls get kind of boring after a while."
Harry looks away. He can’t stand to see that expression on Draco’s face, and he can’t stand to hear those words; he can’t stand any of it, because he knows it’s all true.
Malfoy, it seems, has at least some sense, because he lets it drop. Instead, he takes off the duck gloves—unfortunately, Harry thinks, because really, he quite enjoys them—and mutters, "Her highness would certainly love that."
Draco shifts beside him. "I want to, though."
Harry doesn’t realise how anxious the conversation is making him until Malfoy’s soft “Oh,” from where he’s sitting at the kitchen table causes him to sigh outright.
"I know!" Harry says, jumping up onto the counter. When he receives a questioning look, Harry wonders if maybe he shouldn't be showing concern for Malfoy. Then again, maybe Harry just doesn't want people coming to his house and becoming burn victims.
Harry sighs, leaning down to examine (and pick at) his own cat attack-related scratches. "I was just saying that I don't believe you. If you had dozens of friends, you wouldn't have spent every day this week and most of your weekend with me."
Harry glares. Malfoy glares back.
Well. Draco was a Slytherin, and Harry isn’t stupid.
"Let's give them something to talk about,” He says, and there’s no doubt in his voice.
Rubbing a hand over his face, Harry says, “Things change, Hermione. Draco—Malfoy—he’s not like he was in school. He’s…” Harry pauses, shrugs, and tries to find the right words. “It’s not so bad, him coming here.”
The question, of course, is less of
Harry glares at her. She sighs for what must be the millionth time.
"And came back."
"It's cold out," Malfoy mutters into his cup.
"Your date?" Harry asks, before he can help himself.
Harry goes the bed the moment Draco leaves, and spends the next ten hours in the most dream-free and easy sleep he’s had in longer than he cares to remember.
“It came out of nowhere!” Harry defends. “What’s your point, Draco?”
"Very cutting, I'm impressed." Harry murmurs, looking at Draco.
Draco hesitates, looking like he wants to say something. He settles on, "You're outside.”
Shaking his head slightly, Harry rubs his eyes. Of course he’s aware of that. And even though Harry knows that if he truly didn’t want to tell it, Malfoy wouldn’t have gotten this out of him on his dying day, he replies "I didn't plan on confessing anything, Malfoy. You irritated it out of me."
Scuffing his socks against the floor, Harry mumbles, "Yeah," and hopes to God that he sounds surer than he feels.
"You called your owl 'Esme,' Malfoy?" Harry asks, raising his eyebrows and feeling something akin to amusement for the first time in... too long. "You do know it's a boy, don't you?" Harry’s amusement grows when a light flush crawls up Malfoy’s neck, and he fails completely at covering it up.
As much as Harry wants to leave, he finds that, once standing in the entrance hall, he rather likes it here. Not here as in 'at the W.O.T. Gala,' but here as in, 'right in front of the door at Malfoy Manor.' It’s quite beautiful. Harry's eyes scan the ground before him like a starving man, but he doesn't step outside.
Sighing, Harry returns to pondering the grounds. He doesn't need to think about that now. He's got enough problems being here as it is.
Once changed out of his dress robes and downstairs, Harry puts on the coffee maker and waits for it to be done with an unhealthy amount of anxiety. He'd managed to dig up some hangover potion, but it had been old and almost empty, so he hadn't bothered. Head throbbing and mouth dry, he leans against the counter and attempts to think through his splitting headache.
Malfoy Manor, Harry notes quickly, is really quite beautiful when it's not invaded by giant snakes and men with their souls in pieces. The ballroom—different from the one he had been dragged to two years ago when he'd been caught with Ron and Hermione is the forest, Harry is thankful to see—is sparkling. Glistening lights decorate the room, making everything glow in a light haze. Good taste hangs from every surface, along with velvet and wealth and silver. The people here look happy and content, and not like they care very much for any War Orphans, but then, Harry isn't here for the good of the children, either.
*****
"I was only trying to read my magazine," Draco says innocently.
Clucking her tongue, Hermione says, “You have mentioned that.”
"How?"
“It isn’t easy for any of us to be here, all right? Especially not now. These past few days you’ve been in such a mood, even Ginny said you were a bit off.” Harry clenches his teeth. “Look, I’m sorry. I’ll talk to Ron. He has been busy with work, you know, it’s not only that he doesn’t want to come here.”
, and the thing about going outside... not so appealing. Harry glares.
"—because you were drunk?" Draco finishes for him with biting sarcasm.
“Right.”
"I'll take that as a compliment,” Draco smirks
Harry winces at the mention of alcohol, at the sight of Draco, and at the thoughts going through his throbbing head, and gestures to the coffeemaker on the counter near him. "Help yourself. You know where the cups are."
Harry snaps back to the present; Draco is staring at him from his armchair.
Harry’s panic begins a steady inclination.
Malfoy had said. And now he knows the truth of all the things that occurred. And now Harry knows the truth of something entirely different:
Over at the stove, Harry thinks he wouldn’t be surprised in Narcissa Malfoy done just that.
charm confirming just that, Hermione moves from the kitchen table and makes her way towards the door. "You ought to consider coming out of this house eventually, Harry," she calls.
Harry laughs, filled with a happiness he never thought he’d feel again. "It doesn't. I've just missed arguing with you."
Harry smiles slightly, rubbing at his face a little, hardly believing himself. "Yes, Draco, I really will attend your horrible fucking Gala. I must have gone mad," Harry mutters. "You'll owe me big time, of course."
Harry doesn’t have time to dissect that last thought, though, because Draco is
"Shut up,” Harry mutters, and he can’t hold the eye contact any longer. "After I died, I found myself at King's Cross station... only not... and then Dumbledore was there, and I had to...” Harry sighs, images of whiteness and Dumbledore and a cleanKing’s Cross dancing in his head, “decide what to do."
Harry doesn't really remember what his point is. "My point is... that I don't mind. That I want..."
“I might have to, Weasley,” is the only response, and Harry laughs.
Growing angrier by the second, Harry almost shouts, "This is my house! Or had you forgotten?” He looks around at Malfoy’s expensive clothes, strewn across his kitchen table and chairs, “You certainly seem to have made yourself at home."
