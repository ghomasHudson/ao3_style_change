They all continued chatting, and mainly Draco chatted with Dave. His story was rather fascinating: his father was American military, so he’d gotten to travel all over—from different “bases” in the United States, to all over Europe.
Oh … Draco looked for the same type of strap that Harry had. Harry’d—what—produced it from someplace behind his shoulder?
Harry found himself rushing off towards the door to the waiting room, slipping out into the hall, and waltzing off without a destination.
‘I thought you were dead,’ Draco said, his mouth moving against Harry’s scalp, with a voice wobbly and wet-sounding.
‘I forgave all that, a long time ago, for what it’s worth. Though I think we can agree I have much, much more to apologise for.’
“We were wondering if you knew of someone bringing notes in. For Harry,” Hermione interjected, straight to the point.
Malfoy looked at Harry blankly for a beat, then moved his fingers to his left cuff, unbuttoning it and rolling up his sleeve in just a few easy movements. He stretched out his bare arm to show to Harry. ‘Butterflies,’ Malfoy said, quietly, as a muscle shifted in his jaw.
Astoria turned, looking over to find Draco just standing there. His eyes focussed in on her, bringing him out of his thoughts, as she tilted her head, like she was concerned or trying to figure something out.
Neville nodded, still dumbstruck. The gears in his head were turning, and it seemed like he wanted to keep talking about it.
Once ready for bed, they shut off the television and pulled their still slightly-wet and soon-to-be-a-bit-crusty t-shirts off, before tumbling into Draco’s bed, wearing only their pants.
The birds also seemed pretty cheerful at the change in weather—the sky was filled with their chatter.
Well. It was nice to talk. At least he could say they’d talked, now. Potter was doing well, he’d said so. So … so Draco would go back to London contented.
He'd certainly received his fair share. He could've been sent to Azkaban after the war, after all, instead of probation and community service.
Harry looked around the room and shook his head. It definitely had enough pillows and blankets. He only needed one of each, really. ‘No, no I’m good, thanks.’ He smiled at Draco. This was all a bit weird but … nice. ‘So, goodnight, then. Sleep well.’
Then, they stepped outside into the elements, into the quiet dark. Harry breathed the fresh, wintery air deep into his lungs.
Weasley’s cheeks went an unflattering scarlet again. “Yeah,” he fumbled to say. “I mean, I don’t want to hurt him.”
'You have an important message, sir.' He lifted a slip of paper from under the counter, and handed it over.
He’d shown too much of himself … he’d reminded Harry of who he was really talking to. A Death Eater. A—
him. Like... actually like him. Romantically. It defied logic, yes. But... maybe Draco didn’t need to tread too carefully.
Salazar … Draco didn't know what he wanted. Or he did, and he wanted Harry not to have to compromise or sacrifice any part of his life in Ibiza, certainly not for his sake. And he wanted Harry to stay and never leave. All this at once.
Harry regarded Professor Vector for a long moment as he fiddled idly with a letter opener, turning it around in his fingers. It was shaped as a sword. Brass.
The left side of Harry's mouth lifted up, and then the right came up to join it. 'I don't know how you could've had a good time.'
The screaming cut out in a flash, leaving a faint ringing in Harry’s ears. But still the ghost hovered there, staring out at them with hollow eyes.
It was surprising how turned on he was. He rarely ever got hard these days. His Mind Healer had brought it up, to his dismay and utter embarrassment. But in the end, she’d taught him it was normal to have a reduced libido after all he’d been through, particularly when a person is depressed, and that it would return in time.
—for both of us—very quickly. If you still want to go on a date with me, in six weeks, after you’ve thought about it—very carefully—then, I’ll go on one with you. I’ll … write you when I’m in London.’
Maybe Malfoy wouldn’t open the journal again, maybe he’d just been playing along to get Harry to shut up about it.
A thrill—a heat—blossomed in Harry’s chest. He picked up the note carefully and unfolded it. Hermione tried to peer over his shoulder.
? What business do you have, shoving him like that?’ Harry demanded, searching Malfoy’s face for something. Some reaction, some explanation.
Harry smiled again. Then, he grabbed a piece of blank parchment from his desk, and scribbled a response:
Harry worried his bottom lip with his teeth, and watched Ron pour the first glass of red wine first, before replying, “We … hung out alone together the whole time.” It made his chest tighten up, just saying it. “We talked. He’s … nice to talk to.”
A few ‘Ooo’s echoed from around the room. Harry sighed. ‘It isn’t unusual for me to get fan mail.’ He winced right after he said it. Those words sounded so vain and narcissistic. Pretentious.
Wow ... That'd been ... pretty amazing, actually. Spent and satisfied, he lay for a while, with his arm casually draped over his eyes. His heartrate took its time to slow down, as did his breathing.
Harry couldn’t wait any longer. His eyes flitted from Malfoy’s fingers on the blanket, to the soft, thoughtful expression on Malfoy’s face, to his
“Come on, need I remind you that we promised to tell each other everything?” she said, coming up beside him and laying a hand on his shoulder.
Harry huffed a breathy laugh. That de-escalated quickly. Thinking again of Tom Riddle’s diary, he scribbled:
So, during their free period, Harry did as he was asked. The library had a stillness to it, with mid-morning light streaming in through the stained-glass windows—dust motes dancing in their paths. Most people were in class, and the few people with free periods themselves were spread out with noses in their own work.
All right, now. Harry shook his head to clear it. That’d been enough thoughts on Malfoy for one day.
He was back at Gryffindor Tower now. He said the password and beelined for his room. He pulled out his journal and scribbled a note.
. Okay. He could laugh. Yeah, Voldemort’s dead, and Harry was alive. Now he could live. He could do … whatever he wanted, now.
“Go pink team,” Malfoy said, with a funny half-smirk and half-smile, as he wrapped his scarf around his neck.
‘And I don’t have a Saviour Complex,’ he muttered. He glanced at Malfoy across the Hall—just eating his meal with his head down.
That was quite kind of him. Harry knew it couldn't be easy—after all these years—to accept Harry and Draco as a couple. 'Thanks, mate. Really.'
He leaned forwards, so that no one would overhear. “It’s not about whether or not it’s fun.” He sighed and rubbed a palm over his face. Merlin, maybe Potter’s Gryffindor-ish honesty in conversation was rubbing off on him. “It’s about... well, no one wants me there.”
“What? Why? What happened?” The first place his imagination went was: Potter destroyed his book. Tossed it in the lake. He could laugh, what a stupid thing to imagine. He tried to look at Potter’s face, but the man was facing forward and it was impossible to get a read on him.
Harry connected their Floos so that they could pop over and back easily. And then, they went through.
As soon as the door banged shut, Draco set his book down and gripped the edge of the sink. He took a deep breath. What was he playing at—having lunch with Potter?
Harry made a dip in the centre of the dry ingredients, and poured the wet ingredients into it—like a little lake.
The party sounds were muted out there. It felt … peaceful. And Draco’s charm was just right—it felt strong and steady, not too hot or cold.
Harry smiled again, and closed the door. He flicked on the lamp on the nightstand, and changed into pyjamas. After he heard Draco leave the bathroom and shut his bedroom door, Harry slipped out the room and brushed his teeth. He looked pretty relaxed in the mirror, he had to say. He sort of had a little goofy smile. It’d been a good day. A very nice day.
“I haven’t practiced moving objects myself in many, many years. I always tend to find it’s best to leave things where they lay, and I do find focusing my energy on speaking to be much more fun.” He did a little twirl in the air. “But this must be an urgent quest you’ve undertaken, or you wouldn’t have gotten this far. Let’s see, let’s see—oh! Miss Hermione Granger!”
He brought his suitcase over to the dresser, and opened up the drawers. Empty. Meant for his clothes, then. He clicked his suitcase open and began laying his Muggle clothes inside the drawer carefully.
Malfoy nodded, and they sipped their teas, Harry’s black, Malfoy’s milky and sweet. It was the same lovely Malfoy estate tea.
Pansy left his side to go to Blaise. Draco watched as she grabbed the man’s arm and pulled him closer to whisper in his ear. Always plotting something, that one. Draco sighed and rubbed at a spot on his chest.
Harry ran a finger lightly over his tattoo. Smiling to himself. Feeling a little closer to Sirius in that moment. He looked at Draco, who seemed visibly relaxed, staring down at his own arm.
‘But I didn't stop you, of course not. And … Sixth year nearly killed … a lot of people. Nearly killed me. Granted, it’d be deserved.’
She shook her head. 'There's nothing for you to do right now.' She nodded towards the clerks. 'We're just scanning all the papers. That's priority right now. And since you obviously
Harry sucked in a breath, and immediately returned to sucking on Draco’s neck with increased fervour, nibbling on Draco’s earlobe, and kissing behind his ear. All while pausing here and there to have a peek at Draco’s lap.
'Er, yeah. Just for dinner, and how about I come back after, yeah? We can talk and catch up then. Would that be all right?'
?’ Harry repeated, incredulously. ‘Are you seriously asking me what the benefits of friendship are?’
Harry instantly felt a bit guilty thinking it, but that was all soon forgotten, when Draco leaned in conspiratorially, and muttered in his ear, “What
Draco flicked to the next slide—an image of Hogwarts taken from the south side, with dramatic stormy clouds overhead. 'These are some of Colin's works, kindly provided by his family,' Draco said, clicking through. 'We have some of these prints available for auction.'
Astoria had sat herself on a sofa with two somewhat bewildered-looking smartly-dressed men. She was waving her arms around, and speaking with wide-eyes.
'Mm, I like where your heads at,' Draco said, as he shuffled forward to position himself above Harry's mouth.
Biting back a heavy sigh, Draco toed his trainers off, and pushed them into the closet with a socked foot, keeping a wary eye on Potter’s back.
Before Harry could say anything more, like ask her how her Christmas was going, she leaned a hand on Harry’s arm, and got up on her tiptoes to kiss him on both cheeks—as the French do, Harry thought wildly.
He returned to the common room afterwards to learn Gryffindor had won Quidditch. Everyone was cheering and celebrating and Harry was just getting his bearings—a bit overwhelmed by the sudden crowd and noise—when Ginny had run at him with a look of determination on her face. Determined about what, he didn’t know. He was surprised, as he watched her approach, and something adjusted in his mind to remind him that he
Harry opened his eyes blearily, to see Draco’s angelic face above him, only partially lit from the orange glow escaping the Burrow’s windows. ‘Mm, okay.’
“A ghost?” Hermione asked, her face twisting up in confusion. “A ghost is bringing Harry love notes? Well that just doesn’t make sense. Ghosts can’t write.”
So, by the time they’d finished eating, they had a plan. And for the rest of the day, they all set to work baking cakes, contacting guests to dress for a party rather than a funeral, decorating, setting up a dancefloor and music, ordering alcohol to be delivered, and rounding up enough brooms for a Quidditch game.
Harry laughed, and went into the doorway of the bathroom, leaning against the frame. Malfoy stared up at him in disbelief, from where he crouched by the tub. Harry shrugged, smiling. ‘Yeah, I can do Scotch pancakes.’
Harry’s body moved up and down with Draco’s breaths, like a boat riding waves. And … he could feel Draco’s heartbeat. It was … quick. He focused in on Draco’s waiting face.
Merlin, that was depressing. But it felt nice to get it out. Maybe his Mind Healer was on to something.
Harry looked around at all the pots and pans hanging from the ceiling. Looked at the stacks of plates. The sink, the ovens. Then at last, he looked at Malfoy across from him, rather damp and hunched over. Time to settle things, then.
This was the perfect Christmas gift, Harry thought. The best gift. Now he didn't have to worry about Draco's parents' disapproval. He didn't have to wonder if there would come a day when they'd be forced apart. Now … now they could simply enjoy one another, and see where this went. (And Harry couldn't wait to see how it would go.)
Draco shook his head, and found he couldn't quite look at Harry's face at that moment. 'You live in Ibiza, I live here.'
Harry led them out of the castle, and they walked in silence, side by side, on the lawn towards the lake. Harry kept hitting his right palm against his left fist, in a nervous gesture. He didn’t know what to say.
'Well you know, you're friendly. You're shit at everything Muggle and mostly helpless with computers and the like. But you're the heart of the company, aren't you? It wouldn't be what it is without you, we wouldn't help the people we help without you.'
Before he knew it, Harry had several draped over his arm: one that looked like a Christmas tree, with pom-poms and lights that turned on when you flipped a switch on the inside; one that was all black except for a chubby elf body that started at the neck—making its wearer look as if the elf body was there’s; and, his personal favourite, a green jumper with various floating cat heads in various moods—ranging from calm to something akin to screaming. The jumper also had little bells that would jingle as the wearer walked. To his delight, he found a similar one in red with dog faces.
But Harry couldn’t help wondering: did he seriously think it a good idea to return to the exact place so many of his friends had died? The place
nice,' Draco finished. He opened his mouth to say more, to talk of how lovely it'd been to get to know Harry better, to see the island he called home, but he stopped himself. Instead, it was probably enough to say
Draco … was quite struck dumb. He stared at the side of Harry's face, without knowing how to respond.
—He hadn’t meant—“Just not with—” He’d scrambled to say the sentence, but found he couldn’t finish it. He’s never been able to admit it out loud.
He pulled himself up into a seated position, groaning, and rubbing his face. 'One moment, Potter,' he grumbled out, and then he forced himself onto his feet.
As the sun began to set, they settled down on a patch of grass to watch the sky transform into dark oranges and pinks.
Harry hung back with Draco, and felt Draco’s eyes on him. But Harry was watching the Weasleys’ backs, reading the tension there, the loss, written right on their bodies. He wished … he wished he could do something.
Draco received a letter from Harry the next afternoon. Eager, wasn’t he, then. Draco held the envelope in his hands, thumbing over the paper, and sighed.
, though? At least, that was what Draco wanted to ask. He didn’t understand Potter’s sudden interest in keeping him company. “Yeah, alright,” he said, instead.
Harry told him everything, blabbering on, while Dumbledore watched Harry’s face from behind his half-moon spectacles, wearing a funny little smile. He waited until Harry was done and nearly panting, before he spoke.
Draco stared at him for a drawn-out moment, then folded in on himself, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes.
Draco laughed again, throwing an arm around her shoulders and hugging her to him. “I know what you meant.”
People were whispering to each other, grinning, like there was some secret between them all. All of a sudden.
Whatever Draco was going to say, it was lost, because Hermione and Ron were running down the corridor at them, with wild-wide eyes and mouths agape. Harry’d laugh if he wasn’t so concerned.
Then Mulan became determined all of a sudden, and the music changed and Draco just watched it all with wide eyes.
‘Fuck, this is the single most arousing sight in all the known universe,’ Draco muttered, while his fingers kneaded Harry’s arse in pulses.
‘Fine,’ Harry answered simply—he didn’t want to get into it. He managed a strained smile in return though, as he sunk into the seat next to the window.
Draco’s mind glitched a little—he was trying not to look at Potter’s well-muscled brown legs. He licked his lips and stared at the screen. The family was having tea together now. “Just Mulan is a disappointment to her whole family, and she may never find love, and her father’s been called off to war.”
Potter had to walk around Draco to face him head-on. Draco tracked the movement with his eyes. His body didn’t seem to want to move.
Her eyes crinkled as she smiled—seemingly not phased at all by his verbal fumblings. “Good night, Harry. Nice to talk to you.”
Yeah, Draco should wash his hands too. He pushed himself up—which took an effort. He was absolutely boneless.
Malfoy’s fingertips found Harry’s nipples, which were pebbled and sensitive and oh shit—he was kind of turned on.
'Fine, but we need to sort this out sometime,' the bloke said, glaring once more at Draco, before walking off with a grunt.
He didn’t look like 'himself' anymore, hadn’t since Fifth year, if he’s being honest. And now... now he looked like a Muggle, with his flannel and jeans. The cosmetic charms on his hair and on his skin had worn off, and he hadn’t been able to renew them, on account of not having his wand. So, little scars on his face, and the darkness under his eyes showed far too clearly for comfort. And his white-blond hair just fell on the sides, it was down to his shoulders nowadays.
'I'm Draco Malfoy, you fucking fopdoodle!' He made a wiping motion near this villain's face, effectively erasing him. Then he twirled and showed the man a proper strut straight out of there.
It looked so soft, the silky strands that just hung there, past Malfoy’s shoulder. He licked his lips, and said, “Yeah.” And he reached a hand out, touching his fingertips to the ends, wrapping his fingers around them, pulling them a few inches up off of Malfoy’s collarbone and twisting them gently in his hand. Soft.
‘Ah,’ Draco said, starring at Harry’s mouth, now. ‘Well that’s good, since I’ve just accepted a job at Belford Hospital.’
She bit her lip, looking at him curiously. “If that’s what you truly want, darling, then fine—that's fine with me. As long as you’re happy.”
Draco snuck another glance at Potter. He was just sitting there, staring at the fire. He didn’t have a drink. Draco could... could get him one, perhaps.
‘Draco, I have to confess something … You’re not going to like it at first, but, hear me out, please?’ She flashed him her best doe-eyed look.
Draco leaned forward and forked another dumpling. ‘What about you, then?’ he asked, without looking at Harry.
The lift made a loud rattling noise, paired with a cheerful jingle, and opened. It looked empty, so Draco stepped inside.
She held up a hand to stop him. 'I'm aware I wasn't invited, Draco.' She smiled at him, tilting her head down. 'But I can't go a Christmas without seeing my son.'
He pulled back from Malfoy’s mouth and wild tongue, which was … an effort. Breathlessly, he scrambled to say, “We should go back.”
They walked up to the building in silence, and Draco held the door open, and looked at Potter—waiting for him to walk through.
Draco's fingers frantically fumbled for Harry's cock as it bounced in the air, neglected. He grabbed onto it, and pumped it just as fast as Harry's arse moved on Draco's cock.
Merlin … what if he was overdoing it? What if Malfoy took one look at him and decided he was trying too hard?
As they launched into an impassioned discussion of the trade, Madam Rosmerta brought over their hot meals. They debated who had the greatest odds of winning this season (Malfoy thought the Falmouth Falcons, but he was sorely mistaken—it was obviously much more likely to be the Montrose Magpies).
Harry nodded, and shifted his arse closer, until he was right next to them. He reached a hand out, and the cat headbutted his hand immediately. “Uh …"
How had everything gotten this way? It’d been so comfortable, their relationship had become routine. And maybe that wasn’t a good thing? Somehow they’d lost their way, perhaps without even realising it.
“Oh. I see.” Well, that was good. He was glad Narcissa was all right. He probably couldn’t say the same about Lucius, though.
'Sounds perfect.' And he meant it. He’d never had his own tree. Well, they’d be sharing of course, and it’d stay at Draco’s … but it’d be
So he got up, used the bathroom, and changed back into his clothes from the day before (after a Scourgify to freshen them up). He folded his lent pyjama’s in a pile on the dresser top, and made up the bed. He ate a few more of the dumplings they’d had last night, with Afghan television playing in the background (just to have something to listen to).
Draco nodded, not realising he was running his thumb back and forth over the cheap paper of the card.
Well, time to get ready for work, he thought glumly, as he pulled himself up. His limbs felt like cement. Hadn't slept much or very well, evidently.
Somewhere along the line, Harry’s mood had improved. Perhaps he’d just needed a good dose of sugar. He didn’t feel nearly as grumpy as he had in Draco’s office.
No, it was just another girl. Another person who thought he was something that he wasn’t—who projected all their impossible, unrealistic hopes and desires onto him.
Harry looked around. The sun had set, and the snow had settled. The stars were just becoming visible, and out here in the middle of nowhere—without light pollution—they were already glittery and breath-taking. He swallowed. It was truly a lovely place for a wedding.
‘When I was six, I was not allowed to fly on a broom. But, flying on a broom was just about the only thing I wanted to do.’ He laughed under his breath and averted his eyes. ‘My parents kept their brooms locked up in an old wood shed, way out on the edge of the property.’ Malfoy dipped his head down, but Harry could see a slight smile on his lips. ‘See, the shed did not have a floor; it was set on the bare earth. So, persistent to the end, I'd sneak off to dig a hole underneath it, right at the back of the shed—so that no one would ever notice. After a few weeks of doing this, clawing at the earth with a stick, finally I got a hole big enough to climb through. So I did, I crawled inside, and I snatched the shiniest broom I could find.’ Malfoy seemed wistful. ‘It was a classic Nimbus 1000. Beautiful broom.’
‘Where is Malfoy?’ Harry asked quickly, interrupting Neville mid-sentence. It was well-known by now that Draco had betrayed Voldemort, and Hogwarts wasn’t as safe as everyone had thought. If the Carrows knew about Draco—and surely they would? It was unimaginable what they would do to him. He’d worried about Draco for months. He’d lost countless hours of sleep worrying.
Remembering his journal, Harry cast a quick spell to clean himself up first, before reaching over to his nightstand to take it out. He opened it up, hoping there might be something new written there.
Harry paused in his tracks, and whirled around to find Lila and her group of friends excitedly coming down the hall towards him. ‘Don’t you girls have a class to attend?’
Harry opened his eyes. ‘When that happens, I’ll take you on a proper date. We could go to an actual restaurant.’ Merlin, that’d be brilliant.
She nodded. ‘And he wouldn’t give Harry away to Voldemort, even though it would’ve been very good for his family.’
Draco sighed—he was dating a sodding mermaid. Smiling to himself, he pushed down his bottoms, and began the slow walk over to Harry Potter.
Harry's eyebrows raised, but it was too late—Draco had captured him in that moment. Half-smiling. At him.
Oh fuck. Had Ginny written him another ridiculous poem, just like that sodding valentine in his second year? Shit. Now he was going to have to have another awkward conversation with her.
Malfoy put the kettle on, and pulled some mugs out from the top cupboard, setting them down on the kitchen island that was bare except for a single silver toaster. Harry sat at the table and fiddled with the edge of a purple quilted placemat, as he tried not to think about that fantasy anymore.
Draco followed behind him, and when they were completely hidden and tucked away from anyone’s view, Potter turned and took both of Draco’s hands into his. Warm. It sent a jolt through him.
Harry laughed under his breath, and resumed touching Draco, nuzzling at his jaw—planting kisses there.
He opened a new tab, and typed in "http://www,youtube.com/". It took him to the main page, so he had to type in "Evan James" in the search bar.
Hermione looked subtly sorrowful at that, but she nodded. “Just let it all out, tell me what you’ve been thinking.”
Harry felt the annoyance he'd been feeling slide off of him. Draco meant well. He’d only been interested in Harry’s reasoning—Harry didn’t need to be so defensive. He smiled, towards the dough under his fingers, and shot Draco a look. 'It almost seems as if you're complimenting me.'
It smelled like Potter—like a warm living room. Like home. That’s the only way he knew to describe it.
“I’m so bloody turned on,” Astoria muttered under her breath, reaching for Draco’s pants. “I applaud your self-control, Draco. If it were up to me, we would have done his months ago. So bloody traditional you are.” She grinned at him, and kissed at his jaw. “But it will all be worth the wait.”
Luna lay a hand on his arm and squeezed. Thank you, Harry.” She lowered her voice, and said, “Now why don’t you go talk to Draco. I brought him into this room, because he wasn’t talking to anyone out there, and I thought that might be you at the door. You’ll talk to him, won’t you, Harry?”
Hermione looked relieved. Ron took a long sip of his wine and stared at Harry, like he was thinking hard about something. But when he put his wine down, he neglected to say anything.
That nearly crushed him, but Harry had to persevere. ‘You can and you will,’ he said firmly, miserably. ‘
‘Sorry,’ Draco mumbled. ‘It’s a mess.’ He took his wand from his pocket and waved it around. The papers on the desk rearranged themselves into a neat pile.
On the other side of Malfoy sat Terry fucking Boot, prattling on to him about something. Waving a hand around and staring at Malfoy’s face like
Draco opened it up, and ended up lying on his stomach, stretched out, to read. But, he couldn’t concentrate on the words. He kept having to re-read paragraphs until he got fed up. He closed the book and peeked out over the edge of the dock. To his surprise, there were greenish-brown fish there, just swimming around, circling the dock. Some were tiny, some as big as his hand.
The ghost turned to Draco, looked him right in the eye. “Life is short, Draco.” She sounded much less windy, almost … alive. Then she turned back to the one she loved, wrapping her ghostly arms around her, holding her—in a sense—as the Great Hall watched on in stunned silence.
“Yes, well, we had to do a bit of shuffling,” said Flitwick. “Some people couldn’t room together due to previously unknown reasons.”
Harry frowned, deflating. She was probably right. It’d be logical, after all. And logic tends to win out in these cases. He didn’t have some fairytale ending in store—someone who knew him, and loved him anyway. Despite his brashness, stupidity, and moodiness. To love him despite his fame, not because of it.
Harry relaxed into a compartment with Neville, stretching his legs out with a sigh. Neville eyed him.
‘I know,’ he said again, through a smile. ‘I’m sure that’s one of the many things you like about me.’
‘Draco,’ he tried out the name again, it came out a bit breathy. It rolled off the tongue—so much smoother-sounding than the harsh “Malfoy”. Harry cleared his throat. ‘I can’t say you didn’t do bad things.’ Harry licked his lips, before speaking carefully. ‘But you’re not evil.’
She led him into her sitting room—a bright room full of various plants and mismatched antique furniture. ‘Would you like a tea, Harry?’ she asked, as they both settled down onto her pistachio-green couch.
Draco reached for Harry's hand, and squeezed. Harry squeezed back. 'I love him,' Draco said, and it filled Harry's chest with a sudden surprise warmth. Mrs Malfoy didn't even bat an eyelash—instead she kept smiling. 'I'm gay, mother. And Harry's my boyfriend.'
The lift did its thing again. It really didn’t seem an efficient means of travel. It made the noise and opened. Potter stepped off and held a hand against the lift door—frame? (He didn’t know the word for it, when the lift door disappears, the frame that remains—
Draco sighed. “Fine. One of them was: ‘Your arse is a work of art.’” He couldn’t block a blush from forming.
‘I saw him get jinxed by a Fifth Year Gryffindor. I did what any decent person would do, and I asked what happened, kept the kid from running off.’ Harry shrugged. ‘Malfoy didn’t take it well.’
‘Okay, let’s do this,’ Harry said, getting up and pulling down the blanket so that he could climb in. He took off his glasses, and set them on the nightstand on his side of the bed.
It … hadn’t really worked. He hadn’t gotten to speak to Harry Potter. Of course he hadn’t. Had he really thought that Potter might notice him, despite all the people, in the dark club? And, what, shout his name? Invite him up to the stage? Ridiculous.
Finally Harry’d had his fill of breakfast, and saw that Draco was done and making to stand up too. Draco said something to Pansy, prompting her sudden glance over to Harry. And when she realised Harry was looking back, she winked at him.
'If you don't want to, you don't have to,' he said cheerfully, then stepped away from Draco's loosely clutching fingers.
‘And, I suppose, there just wasn’t anyone since. Granted, I didn’t try too hard to meet anyone new. My job has been my priority lately.’ Harry peered at Draco’s face, unable to read it. ‘What about you, then?’
‘Yeah, a little. Around Europe, mostly. And I went to South Africa once.’ Draco pressed his thumbs into Harry’s palm, massaging from the center outwards. ‘Have you?’
Draco did as she asked, sinking into a hard-back plastic chair. He looked around, and caught the eye of a white-haired elderly woman in the next row over. He smiled at her, she smiled back.
Draco blinked at him. 'Ah, suppose.' He walked back over to his closet, and pulled out a couple things for him. Comfortable. Casual.
He jumped, and dared to look at Potter. “No. I haven’t,” he admitted. Pureblood wizards weren’t brought up with them, and perhaps that was unfortunate—since this was turning out to be quite an interesting experience.
“Besides … he’s straight and engaged to Ginevra Weasley. So, don’t go thinking there’s anything more to this.”
However, at breakfast time on an unremarkable Wednesday, he received another package in the post. He stared down at it with lips pressed firmly together.
Potter snatched it out of his hand, his fingers grazing Draco’s in the process. “I reckon you just press the on button.” He pressed a black button near the base of the thing, and it whirled to life, spewing hot air.
He opened the door for Malfoy, feeling rather exhilarated at the close proximity of him. It’d been so long since he was within two metres of another human. He stared at Malfoy. He could smell him. He smelled … nice. Like some expensive cologne. (But who bothers to wear cologne during a quarantine?)
A complicated look twisted over Harry's face, there was a line between his eyebrows. It was a look Draco didn't know how to interpret in this context.
“She’s just ...” Ginny rubbed a hand over her face. “She’s hard to read? I can’t figure out if I even have a chance.”
Draco gasped. He really envied people who could that. Mulan’s father was a good man. Just like another self-sacrificing (handsome) prat he knew...
'You've got this whole,' she paused to wave her hand in the direction of his face, 'my husband is lost at sea look.'
Clearing his throat, Harry sat on the edge of the bed and opened up a paper sack. 'Here, I got you a sausage McMuffin. I know it's not the greatest, but it's greasy and—'
Draco nodded, looking a bit dazed. He turned to Harry and said, ‘I should apologise to you, too, really. I was …’ He licked his lips. ‘I was spoilt and awful. I had no idea of what I was saying—just regurgitating my father’s skewed views. I was cruel and vindictive—’
Pansy grinned, and leant against the doorframe. ‘Wonderful.’ Then she shot up straight and clapped her hands together. ‘We need to go shopping for your vacation outfits.’
, as he'd been at fifteen, simply wishing for a shaggy-haired boy to notice him, to acknowledge him.
Harry groaned again, and grabbed the letter roughly from his bedside table, opening it fast—like he wanted to get this over with.
And he also knew what it was like, now, being a disappointment to his family—being a gay son, being the last of the Malfoy line, and a social pariah to boot. He was unable to live up to his family legacy, all those generations of Pureblood prosperity died with him.
Then, Pansy sauntered over to the table. He hadn’t even noticed her when they came in. But there she was, looking a bit worse-for-wear, with darkness under her eyes and a plain oversized t-shirt paired with leggings. “Good morning,” she croaked, looking intently from Draco’s face to Harry's. “I see that my work is done here.”
Harry thought the poem was quite cute, he realised. Usually weird notes from strangers made him feel uncomfortable, but this one … felt different. Harry was very, very confused, sure, but … the poem was … sweet.
Harry laughed. 'I don't know why you'd have to be one or the other.' He tilted his head to look at Draco properly. 'I'd like to try both ways, actually.'
‘So it didn’t work out with Blaise, then,’ Harry mused. His eyelids felt heavy, but he was very interested in this topic.
It was so still, save the gentle ebb and flow of the waves washing up on the shore. And he heard Potter’s soft breaths beside him.
He did a bit of paperwork himself, but his eye kept straying over to Draco’s letter. He found he wanted to … read it again. He liked the way Draco talked. He liked that they could just talk … like normal people now. So, he slid it over on top of his paperwork, and stared down at it with his face resting on a fist. Just gazing at it for a bit.
“Here,” Harry said under his breath, so that Flitwick—who’d just started the lesson—wouldn’t notice. He pulled a folded-up note from his bag and placed it in front of Draco.
Blaise was just starting to explain to Draco something about a new distillation of fairy wine, that made its morning-after effects a little more tolerable, when Potter sauntered over to stand right in front of them.
The air felt fresh and damp, like just after a rainfall, and smelled of evergreen. Draco took a deep breath, and turned his head to look at the tall trees around him in awe. Birds were chattering in the distance, and for a precious moment, Draco almost forgot about Potter, and found himself feeling... nearly peaceful. That is, until his classmates sprang to life, shoving each other and prattling on, drowning out the sounds of nature with their noise, bringing with it a heavy pit of unease in Draco’s gut.
He opened his eyes, and stared at the brown hand there. The bony fingers. The bitten fingernails. The scar that read ‘I must not tell lies’ in Potter’s own handwriting.
This was the man who made Draco take a cock bottle-opener back with him. The man who laughed with him, who listened to him, who trusted him with painful secrets.
Draco didn't know what else to say, and he realised he was staring. 'Right. Good.' He tore his eyes from Harry's face, and fished around for his Portkey in his bag. 'I think it was a ceramic spoon. Merlin, why are they always the most obscure objects?' Draco muttered, not really expecting an answer. His fingers caught on the edge of the handle.
” Merlin. She never left him alone anymore. He just wanted to read in peace, why couldn’t she let him?
“Sure, maybe it seems romantic or saintly or something... the idea of being the wise hermit out in the woods, the mysterious wizard who has turned his back on society...”
But he couldn’t see Draco too well, he was just a dot of that distinctive hair colour. So, Harry drifted down slowly, like a falling leaf.
“You alright?” Harry asked tentatively. It felt a bit weird to ask, since it was Malfoy and all. But … it was the decent thing to do all the same. The war was over. They were all rebuilding Hogwarts together. Harry was consciously putting in an effort to get along, despite the past.
Without overthinking it too much, he selected Harry's screen name, and it took him to Harry's "channel". He browsed the videos, without selecting any.
“What if I keep doing that? Not noticing?” Draco wondered aloud, as his heartrate picked up. “You do nice things, and I just go about my day, completely oblivious. You’ll tire of it... or worse, I’d hurt you by keeping that up—”
“It’s just sex, it’s not vital. Not for me. I have a perfectly good hand, and a great imagination.” Astoria snorted. “You know what is vital? For me? Having a partner I love, who I trust, who I can tell anything to and know I’ll still be loved. Having a best friend, who I want to spend every day with … who is hilarious and adorable and so, so kind. Pretty much perfect, really.”
He laughed a little. ‘Strange. Because … you see, somehow I managed to buy myself a magically-linked journal.’
'So, do you think he likes you?' Pansy asked, digging her black-manicured fingernails into the pile of biscuits, searching for the kind she wanted. 'Like, romantically?' She found the one, and popped it into her mouth, crunching loudly.
Harry had something to look forward to now, a night with his closest friends. One that he didn’t have to worry about Ginny, he could just … be free, unburdened, and enjoy the company. He missed that—he was afraid he might’ve lost that by breaking up with Ginny. Not that Christmas had been bad … just the opposite, really. It’s just … he just didn’t want everything to change too much. He still needed Ron, Hermione, Neville, Dean and Seamus around. In his life.
Surely if it were a prank, Harry wouldn’t kiss Draco in front of the entire common room—could it be … real?
‘Fine,’ Harry said again. ‘Neville teaches Herbology, so I get to see him most every day. Hagrid is there, and, well … most of all the old faces. I see Hermione and Ron once and a while. They’re doing well—married now, with two kids.’
“Merlin, you look rough,” said Ron, swivelling in his chair, as Harry arrived at their cubicle—a cramped space that sat them back-to-back. “Partied too hard this weekend?”
The water lapped at him gently, and he let himself float wherever it wanted to take him—likely back towards the shore.
Harry looked up at him, but he seemed to be more interested in the crystals and gems on Luna’s bedside table. “No?”
They collapsed, still connected, in a pile of sweat and limbs and ejaculate. Harry held Malfoy, kissing his shoulder. Malfoy twisted over to face Harry, causing Harry’s softening cock to pop out.
She seemed to accept that, and they went on eating. Astoria liked to dip her sandwich in her soup … A habit Draco thought was a bit unsavoury. Who wants a soggy sandwich?
Harry shook his head and looked off at the shore. 'I've talked plenty. It's just nice to ... well, talk about other things.' Harry’s smile returned. ‘I’m ready to go in. You can stay out here if you like.’
He wasn’t sure he wanted to know. This conversation had abruptly taken a strange, awkward turn. Draco couldn’t very well say anything about Harry this time, now could he? Not now that they knew their identities. And Harry didn’t really want to hear about Draco’s fantasies about other people. He wasn’t
He slid into the seat beside Blaise, and shot her a glare. “I’ll thank you to stay out of my affairs in the future.”
It had been comfortable, though, holding Malfoy’s hand. It fit well in his—the soft, smooth skin, the weight of it. And Malfoy had needed to be comforted, Harry guessed. He’d seemed so lost and spacey, and Harry just wanted to help him, to try to help ground him. It couldn’t be
One of those unfamiliar hands brought Harry’s to rest against a chest. A flat chest, covered in soft cotton fabric.
So, Harry and Draco went on, and Harry burst out laughing once they’d gotten out of earshot. Draco couldn’t help but smile at Harry’s amusement.
Draco took a breath and eyed a closed-down shop display of colourful hats as they passed by. ‘Well, there’s the Colin Creevey Memorial Fund. It helps war survivors and the like with access to Mind Healers, magic prosthetics, or financial assistance when someone cannot work.’
After a time of quiet contemplation, of comfortable silence, they moved out onto the balcony. Draco cast a warming charm on them, as they snuggled up into a lounge chair together, wrapped up in each other’s arms.
. And the world didn’t swallow him up. Instead, guilt and relief in equal parts swirled around in his stomach.
‘You’re a fucking good kisser, Harry,’ he said with a breathy laugh, tapping Harry’s cheek lightly with his fingers. His lips looked a little swollen, his eyes glassy.
Harry slid his feet in towards himself, so that his knees were up and he could lift up his arse a bit. He trailed the hand that wasn’t pumping his cock between his thighs to his arse cheeks below. His middle finger teased his hole, he imagined it was Malfoy’s finger instead of his. He pressed the finger in past that ring of nerves, his other hand fisted his cock faster.
‘Hmm? Sure it does. It’s real salt, real pepper, isn’t it?’ Draco said, sitting at the table with his glass and stretching his legs out.
And so they kissed—and it was nice. Harry held his hand softly against Dean’s throat, he could feel a pulse beating against the pads of his fingers. The other hand gripped Dean’s strong bicep. Harry didn’t remember choosing to put his hands anywhere—they were just there. And Dean’s hands were set low on Harry’s hips, squeezing in pulses, keeping him close.
‘Besides, you could use a vacation. You’re all work-work-work.’ She waved a hand around. ‘And when it’s not work, lately it’s all Potter-Potter-Potter. It’s
Harry’s free hand found Malfoy’s bicep, gripping on to it, as the Seeker raced towards a point on the far end of the pitch. Malfoy’s hand tightened on his arm.
'Sleep off the jet lag,' she repeated, with a smile and a sharp rap of her knuckle against his desk.
Draco snorted, a flimsy little sonnet, then. What was it—ABAB CDCD EFEF GG? Merlin, this was going to be awful.
Draco exhaled. Would he? Or would he retreat and try to pretend nothing was wrong—as had been his instinct for so long? Well... it was a choice, in the end, wasn’t it? “Yes, I promise I’ll talk to you.”
Draco mirrored him, leaning back and sucking in enough air into his lungs to keep himself afloat, spreading his arms out. His ears dipped underneath the water, plunging everything into total silence. No wind, no distant bird calls. Just complete silence. And Draco looked straight up.
Draco inhaled a breath, blinking down at Harry in wonder. His thumb made small circles on Harry’s shoulder. It felt quite soothing … It could easily lull Harry back to sleep.
They don’t? ‘Fuck,’ he whispered. ‘I didn’t want to say anything, not so soon. I didn’t want to hurt you—or take away from ...’ Mourning Fred? Harry winced.
Anyway, that was three. Three journal entries. He felt a bit exposed, but also … liberated? There was nothing there to indicate he was Harry Potter—he could be nearly anyone.
And the lighting on the ceiling made the edges of Malfoy’s hair glow. “You’re beautiful,” Harry blurted out.
Thankfully, Seamus interjected before anyone could prod Harry further. ‘Dean an’ I went to Portugal!’
He opened his eyes slowly. The library was dead silent again, save a cough and the turning of a page. Malfoy came in to focus, beside him now. Hands in his hands, holding. A thumb brushed over Harry’s knuckles, reassuringly.
“What? Was it?” His gaze snapped to Draco, but the man was drinking from his cup, obscuring his expression. Harry thought back, what had he last sent? Ah, it’d have to be the day he sent the jumpers, which was the day … “Oh. Sorry. Yeah, that was the first morning after … with Ginny …"
‘Yeah,’ Potter said softly. ‘Well … I think I’m good for now, I’m gonna swim in. But stay out here as long as you want.’
‘People are saying that … you might … well, love me,’ Potter said. His voice was light, but there was something underneath it, something--
But that didn’t work so well, because a group of Ravenclaw boys soon cornered him in the cramped passageway.
‘So, we’ve been writing to each other all this year, then.’ Might as well start with the obvious. Recapping made sense, and was easy.
Eventually his hand hit the right spot, and the thing stopped. He cracked an eye open, and saw the digital clock reading "9:00" in obnoxious red font.
She smiled. “Okay, darling. Let’s finish lunch, then go shopping for a rolling pin and cutlery tray.”
(I've been working on this old thing for 1.5 years ... at a certain point you gotta stop your polishing and put the thing in the shop window, I guess)
Dimitri raised his glass of something clear. The rest of them followed suit, Draco included. 'To Evan.'
Malfoy picked up his broom, and his plait swung behind him as he righted himself, and got ready to take off.
A pigeon waddled by near their feet, looking for crumbs. Harry stared at it, without really registering it.
Draco’s eyes found the source of the voice—a wide-eyed, curly black-haired Hufflepuff was clumsily making her way over to the ghost, stumbling and using people’s shoulders for support as she made her way over.
‘We don’t need no haters,’ Potter sang, throwing his face up to the sky, and scrunching his eyes closed. ‘We’re just trying to love one another.’
'Yes.' He watched Draco sink into a chair, facing towards him, and fold his hands on the table—setting his head down to rest on them. Merlin, he really wasn't a morning person, was he? 'Er, tea?'
Draco must have heard, from wherever he’d been, because he grabbed at Harry as he had just exited the front doors onto the grounds. Draco managed to pull the cloak off, letting it flutter to the ground.
It seemed similar to the concept of seeing your own life flash before your eyes before you die. He was being bombarded with memories of Ginny. And it … it hurt. He felt as if he’d wrenched her violently from his life, and all that was left was a big, sore, wound ... where Ginny used to be attached.
‘Right, Becca. Yeah, and they just wouldn’t stop after the ten seconds. So yeah, I guess they’re girlfriends now.’
Harry laughed under his breath, and pushed himself to his feet. ‘I love the enthusiasm, really makes a bloke feel special.’ He extended a hand, an offer to help Draco up.
He swallowed. ‘You seemed … I don’t know, awed by him. And I didn’t care for it. But I suppose I told myself it was irritating because you’d schemed to be in the Tournament and Cedric was being nicer to you than you deserved.’
Morgan threw her head back in a bewildered type of expression, and seemed to think on it. She shrugged, and twisted her mouth to the side. 'Well … Britney Spears cheated on Justin Timberlake apparently, that's why they broke up.'
Malfoy’s sitting room was just as empty as his office. There was nothing on the walls. Just a non-descript grey armchair near the hearth, and a small desk by the window, overflowing with papers. And then he had that bookshelf. There was only the one photograph in the room, sitting on the desk. Harry took a step closer. It showed Narcissa Malfoy standing in a lush garden—she wasn’t smiling, but the sun was shining and reflecting off her hair, and her hands were clasped loosely in front of her. It seemed a nice summery day in the photo.
Harry laughed, and it was a lovely thing to hear. 'Probably not. Guess that makes me an accessory to the crime.'
Draco hummed. ‘I suppose.’ He was meticulously running a fingertip along the lengths of each of Harry’s fingers in turn.
He smiled to himself. Despite the heartbreak, the loneliness, the guilt, that he might be putting himself in store for—perhaps … perhaps walking away from something was walking towards something better in the long run.
He was regurgitating the words he'd heard so many times. But … even now, they were a comfort to him. He
‘I regret showing you this,’ Pansy muttered as she clicked through, leaning over his shoulder. ‘Anyone else would’ve had a good laugh with me and been done with it.’ Another click. ‘There.’
Ginny smiled at him, tossing him a bone. ‘It’s alright, Harry. You don’t have to tiptoe around, certainly not for my sake. I’m fine, and, for what it’s worth, I’m happy for you. You seem good together.’
“Ah, so, you would’ve kissed a bunch of people then.” Merlin … Harry couldn’t believe he’d just blurted that out.
Draco yelped. He could admit, it wasn’t exactly the most dignified response to what was taking place. He didn’t look at Potter, didn’t look at his... But he knew it was there, and that was enough.
Malfoy looked at Harry’s disheveled head of hair with an awe it didn’t deserve. He brought his own hand up, tentatively, and carded it gently through the hair at Harry’s temple. It sent goosebumps up the back of Harry’s arms.
The other, gentler, voice in his head told him it wasn’t his fault. The Half-blood Prince had written that note in the textbook, aside the words ‘
'We can set up video calls for meetings. You could Portkey in once and a while for fundraisers and galas and whatnot. But it's
He’d spent woefully too little time with them throughout the year, though, so he had to force himself. For too long they’d only had the odd weekends or the odd Sunday dinner at the Burrow where it’s too crowded to have a meaningful two-on-one chat for very long.
The waiter came back with a bottle of red wine. He poured out a small amount in Malfoy’s glass first. Malfoy gave his glass a swirl and smelt it, before taking a small sip. He nodded at the waiter, who proceeded to fill both of their glasses.
‘Er …' Draco managed, looking off across the field towards Ginny who was deep in conversation with Luna and not paying them any attention, then he looked at George and Angelina. Then, at Harry. ‘Alright.’
Harry moved carefully to lie beside Draco, letting the soft cock slide out of him slowly. Draco leaned over and kissed Harry on the forehead, and leaned farther over to pick up his wand from the nightstand.
Draco eyed Harry, who'd sat himself down in the brown chair and was currently feigning interest in the arm rests. 'Good.'
“Would you go inside the Room of Requirement? It’s fixed up. It’s totally cosy and nice inside, and there’s a couch. And it’s private.”
His mind filled itself with images of Fiendfyre, with screams in his ear, with Malfoy gripping tight to his waist, overcome with fear. He couldn’t help thinking about it, couldn’t hold back the barrage—like a dam had broken.
She rolled her eyes. “Don’t be so dramatic, darling. I’m not some fragile maiden in a tower that you have to
It didn’t matter, he told himself. What mattered was that he had earned a semblance of trust, enough for Malfoy to confide in him, to let Harry help him. It made him feel sort-of warm inside, in his chest.
They tore their eyes away from each other and went back to reading the ingredient list in their textbooks. Harry couldn’t stop smiling, he tried—he just couldn’t quite manage it.
'Thanks, Hermione.' This was all rather sweet—he hadn't expected their support to be so freely given.
Harry looked out at the empty pitch. “Yeah.” He felt the same way. “What’s been on your mind, then?”
He was so beautiful—coming undone in front of Harry. The act of fucking his face with wild abandon … it just …
He tucked back into the sofa, sipping at his hot coffee, when his gaze strayed over to his horribly depressing bare Christmas tree. It was bare, because he’d saved the decorating to do with Ginny. And now that they were broken up, what was the point?
Potter swung him around under his arm, as if this were a bloody ballroom and they were dancing a waltz. Draco shook his head and laughed. Ridiculous. And bloody adorable.
And Potter seemed to stiffen, his mouth pinched, his chest rose and fell like he’d had to take a deep breath.
She faltered, blinking at him in incomprehension. “Harry Potter … but aren’t you, well, "mortal enemies” or whatever you always called it?”
“I’m sure it’s nothing. Maybe they’re from an ex-lover or something.” God, that felt odd to say. Draco Malfoy with a lover … how very weird. Harry gave a quick shake to his head to clear it.
Draco shrugged. “I just do. Harry Potter does not talk like this to anyone, and certainly wouldn't to me.”
‘Ah, well ...’ A pink tongue flicked over Draco’s bottom lip. ‘Cleans towels are in the top cupboard in the bathroom if you’d like to shower tonight, or in the morning.’
The door opened to the waiting area, and in walked Ron. He looked pale and frenzied, as he strode into the centre of the group, and announced, “She’s gone into emergency surgery. The baby … he’s got her … ah, umbilical cord wrapped around his neck.”
to become, was kinder … He knitted wonky blankets, watched cheesy films, and collected second-hand items to decorate his flat. Harry’s Draco helped him through an anxiety attack and invited him to a mental health weekend.
“Maybe I like him back! Hermione! I like that he challenges me instead of hero-worships me, he’s sees me for who I really am!
Draco held the unopened letter in his hand. “Well, I suppose we’re just … catching up. They’re just short notes, quite casual, actually.” He licked his bottom lip, searching for what else he could say.
And what would that do to a child… psychologically? How does a child still grow up to be kind, brave, and big-hearted?
“Ah... no. She broke it off this past summer.” He exhaled slow. "They were fighting all the time... it just... wasn't working."
“You brought an extra drink?” Potter asked starring at the contents of Draco’s hands, slurring his words just slightly.
Malfoy shrugged, not quite meeting Harry’s eyes. ‘It’s what I imagined a home should look like,’ he murmured, then, clearing his throat, said louder, ‘Should be like.’
—that Draco found freeing. The tightly coiled metal chain in his chest loosened. It felt so good, he took another deep breath.
‘Snogging,’ Draco echoed, smiling like he couldn’t help it. He brought his hand up to Harry’s face, brushing the pad of his thumb over Harry’s cheekbone, and lacing his fingers into the curls at Harry’s temple. ‘Fuck, you’re gorgeous.’
She sighed, and shot her husband a look. “It’s just … is that all it is, Harry? Friendship? Or, are there stronger feelings at work here?”
Draco smiled back weakly, and looked down at his salad. He picked his fork up and started eating again.
“I love your hair,” Malfoy murmured against Harry’s mouth, carding his fingers through the curls with fervour.
“He saw what I thought about to cope... to keep myself reasonably sane...” Green eyes. Black curls. Scars that read
Draco wanted to groan, wanted to protest that not everything was about Harry fucking Potter. But he didn’t want to snap at her, she really did
Harry cuddled into him, wedging under Draco’s arm and kissing at his jaw. “Don’t overthink it. Remember? It doesn’t have to be complicated for no reason.”
Malfoy—Draco—laughed with his groomsmen as they all came down the aisle in a wild bunch, and he was happier than Harry had ever seen him. Malfoy’s blond hair framed his face, clipped to chin length. He wore white tailored robes—scratch that, not white. More like an iridescent pearl, or … moonstone. His groomsmen, on the other hand, had matte white robes.
Harry smiled, and Draco didn’t smile back—instead, he bit his lip and looked off towards the barely visible horizon—a line of dark trees underneath starry sky.
‘Pansy.’ He ran one hand casually through his hair, leaving it smoothed, but still a little tousled.
Then there were the two small gifts from Draco to open. Harry felt a pang—he supposed it was at not having given the one to Ginny as he was instructed to. But she wasn’t here, so … Draco probably wouldn’t mind. Harry took a sip of coffee and then opened the first one, and nearly spit out his drink. Oh lord, it was socks with a Father Christmas showing off his cock and balls. Harry laughed, holding a hand over his mouth, and laughed and laughed.
“Seriously, he’s a bit fit. Like … minorly fit, in my opinion. You know, like a six out of ten at best. His hair’s a mess, he wears the same type of glasses he had when he was eleven …"
“So...” Potter started. “Is there anything you want to do today? Like swim or go on a boat or something? Go on a walk? Kick a ball around? Play a board game?”
‘How is it for you, living with the Hufflepuffs?’ Harry asked, looking into the deep dark brown of Blaise’s eyes. They were pretty nice looking.
“Well, er, that was all I wanted to say. Um … thank you. And, good night, then.” God, why did he have to be so bloody awkward?
He took a quick shower, then dressed in his nicest Muggle suit—every part of it was black, including the shirt and tie. But the suit jacket and tie had a little shimmer to them. It was a nice outfit. Simple, but nice.
“I hated it. I couldn’t stand seeing people hurt and killed. And I hated feeling powerless to do anything about it,” Draco admitted. Fuck, why was he admitting it?
“I’ll … I’ll try,” Harry said, worrying his bottom lip with his teeth. “First step is to find a good restaurant, something even Draco Malfoy wouldn’t have any objections to.”
‘I don’t … hate you …' he said slowly, realising that it was the truth as he spoke. His heart pounded with the admission. When had he stopped hating Malfoy?
Malfoy eyed him sharply, his cheeks were pink, but that might just be the autumn air. ‘I do. In London.’
Pansy leaned forward, and shot Draco a conspiratorial look, which he did not appreciate. “At the very least, you’ll get some prime wanking material. I bet he’s the kind of bloke that gets dressed out in the open.”
And then he noticed little Rose, in turtle pyjamas, curled-up sleeping on a blue blanket laid over two seats—with her mouth hanging slightly open, and small fingers bunching up the blanket in a fist.
Draco nodded, even though the man was looking past him at the next customer. “Thanks,” he muttered, and then he joined the group waiting for their drinks.
“And he’s different after the war—I've seen him … I’ve seen him actually be nice to people. Just the other day he helped a first year get up onto his feet after he tripped …"
His mind was already trying to think up excuses—ways he can get them switched back. He’s allergic to Gryffindors? He’d snogged Potter’s girlfriend and unless Flitwick wants to be responsible for Draco’s murder, he’d better switch them back? (Not true, of course, but what Flitwick doesn’t know...)
“Welcome to Heartlake Resort, can I get your name?” greeted the young girl with straight blond hair down to her shoulders. The nametag on her mauve dress shirt read 'Lucy'.
Draco nodded, furrowing his brow, and looked around at the crowd of guests—milling about, looking at photographs and sipping their champagnes, eating the hors d'oeuvres.
So Harry decided to get creative. And he enlisted one Felicity Adams, Second Year Hufflepuff, to help him out.
‘An arrangement made by their parents. I do think they respect one another, but …’ Draco trailed off. He cleared his throat. ‘Well, soon enough the same will be expected of me …'
Harry opened his eyes. That had been a stupid thing to imagine—a posh, well-read man like that wouldn’t write ‘trembles’ in a love poem. He sighed and looked back down at the page.
Harry found himself blurrily becoming aware of it—half awake, half asleep—realising that Draco himself came along with those feet. All of him. Like he had gravitated there, closer to Harry. Breathing slowly, in soft puffs against Harry’s cheek, his hands stretching towards Harry, fingers just touching the sides of Harry’s hand—featherlight.
Draco changed in the bathroom, and splashed cold water on his face. When he returned, Harry had already dressed in Draco's clothes, and was sat in that brown chair still. He looked very comfortable, very at ease.
'I only want for you your happiness,' Mrs Malfoy reiterated, as her expression softened. 'And if Harry Potter is the one to bring that about, then I accept your relationship whole-heartedly.'
Potter laughed under his breath. ‘Yeah. The experience was painful, and damaging. I was so frustrated that they couldn’t just … just
Ginny gripped the crook of Harry’s arm hard, too hard, when they apparated in to the wedding. She’d worn loose red robes, the shade of which clashed with her hair (in Harry’s opinion). He didn’t mind, she’d never been particularly interested in fashion, he supposed. And neither had he, really. Besides, he reminded himself sternly, they weren’t there to impress anyone.
That blush returned … the one high up on Draco’s cheeks. ‘That’s …' Draco licked his lip. ‘Awfully fast of you to say.’
When they returned, with the locket, and Dumbledore weakened and sick, Dumbledore inexplicably commanded Harry to cast
. A microwave, a toaster, an oven, a refrigerator. And they looked well-used, with chipped paint on some bits. He also had a blue and white chequered floor, with cheerful yellow paint on the walls. It all defied Harry’s preconceptions, had Malfoy always been this way?
And, as she’d reminded him, he hardly ever had anxiety attacks or broke down in tears lately. He’d already made great strides. He didn’t sleep all the time anymore, and he was interested in things again—most notably cooking. Lately it’d been his mission to learn to make all the Indian dishes he imagined his relatives (on his dad’s side, that is) used to make. It was … well, fun. And he was sort of good at it, though he hadn’t yet gotten any second opinions.
He shrugged. “We’re focusing on careers right now. There’s lots of time for all the rest.” He took a long drag of lager, hoping she’d take the hint.
Harry shook his head, frowning. He knew he should say something. Saying ‘I’m sorry’ would be the right thing to do. But how could he? How could he say those words to
“Everything?” Malfoy asked, lifting an eyebrow without looking at Harry—just staring down at his letters, carefully arranging them side-by-side on his desk.
“Yeah, I think it was like that for me, at first. I’d miss Ginny. But after a while … it’s easier to just—I don’t know—
Malfoy sighed. Peering up at Harry without raising his head. ‘No, you shouldn’t’ve known. It’s all right.’
Harry grunted and covered his face with the paper. What had he done? (He’d opened himself up to the ultimate embarrassment, that’s what. He’d never again be able to look Malfoy in the eye). He sighed, and took the parchment off his face in order to resume reading.
Well. Might as well see. Explore a bit, as it were. And if there was nothing suitable, he’d forget the idea completely.
Potter looked at him with an unreadable expression, and uttered a small, “Hmm.” And then he plunged his second marshmallow into the fire. He repeated the same steps, taking it out to watch the flame engulf its surface. “So,” he started.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest, and schooled his expression into one of indifference, before gathering the courage to look over. Weasley was glaring at him, a glare that reminded him that his very existence was offensive.
Once he had a big stack set on the kitchen island, the syrup and butter out, waters, and two plates and cutlery, Harry called Malfoy over. ‘Dinner’s ready.’
,’ he said with absolute contempt. ‘Well, thank you for the warning.' Draco gathered up his knitting, and stood.
‘Oh. Right. Yeah. Then I’ll just—’ He sat back down on the bed, over the blanket now. Was the morning after sleeping beside someone always so awkward?
And it simultaneously felt like he was miniscule... insignificant—a speck of dust on a giant tapestry, while also as if he and Potter were larger, bigger, somehow—the only two people left. Sharing communion with the great abyss.
'Just for the onion bit.' Harry kissed him on the cheek again. 'I'm sure you'll look quite handsome.'
Beside him, Harry grabbed his own quill, a pot of ink, and considered his page. A love letter to himself? Bit silly, but sure. He unscrewed the cap of the inkpot, and dipped his quill.
Bobby pins stuck out in all directions between Malfoy's lips, and Harry spotted a black hair elastic around his wrist. Malfoy's brow furrowed in concentration as his fingers worked, carefully parting pieces of her hair and folding them over one another.
‘I’m going to Dumbledore. Tonight. Okay? You won’t be able to take it back.’ Harry said, all of a sudden worrying that Malfoy would take it back. Undo everything they’d talked about.
The man nodded, and the two of them pushed the box, trailing after Draco. He led them to the modest-sized kitchen. It was nice and bright at least, a little bare for decorations so far. But they did have one nice spider plant hanging from the ceiling in the corner, and they had a two- (maybe three- but that might be pushing it) person table, which was plenty, really. They didn’t plan on ever being the party planners that their parents had been.
He exhaled slowly, blowing wisps of tea steam away from his face. Harry was going to have to talk to Malfoy. He needed them to acknowledge this … this situation. He needed it to be stated out loud, that it’d happened, that it’d been real. Because if they didn’t … Harry felt like it would all evaporate like the steam coming from his mug. And in ten years he might look back and wonder … wonder if he should’ve made more of an effort.
Draco stepped carefully over to his side of the bed, and climbed in underneath his puffy blanket. Harry wondered why this felt so hesitant and, well, rather awkward. This was
Potter wasn’t dancing, and his eyes had taken on a glassy look—staring straight ahead. Draco turned away to watch the DJ booth. Potter’s friend seemed to enjoy the song—he was bobbing his head and laughing. And, well … Draco was determined to enjoy it, too.
The three of them went down to the Great Hall for dinner, and settled into the benches at the Gryffindor table. Harry’s eyes immediately went to Hufflepuff, he couldn’t help it. Draco was there, sitting with Pansy on one side, and Charlotte on the other. Draco had been looking at him, Harry thought, because he saw him avert his eyes quickly—which was odd. Harry had better speak to him later and make sure everything was okay.
Malfoy’s gaze shifted to the side, to watch the retreating back of that kid running off. His expression settled into a mask of stubbornness, his mouth a firm line.
Malfoy nodded, politely. And, fuck, if the man didn’t kind of blink nicely. Like: softly, slowly. (What was getting into Harry all of a sudden—did weddings just make him sentimental and overly-complimentary of mundane things?)
They were only walking in opposite directions down the hall. It was perfectly normal for a professor to acknowledge another professor when they ran into each other.
“I like...” Harry started, trailing off so quickly, while he shoved an arm through a sleeve himself.
Pansy pouted, and looked behind her at Blaise, exchanging some kind of nonverbal communication. Blaise and Pansy switched seats.
Draco licked at his bottom lip again. He was off-kilter. He didn’t know the first thing about any of this. Their relationship (undefined as it was) felt fragile, like it might snap apart with any sudden movements.
Harry seem to mull that over. 'But even with magic, we are just as infallible as Muggles. We even have more efficient means of murder. Muggles have guns, poisons, but there's always a chance of survival even then.'
Malfoy magicked the door to open, and Harry—after giving an appreciative smile to Felicity—slipped inside, closing the door behind himself.
Instead, he stood rooted to the spot, hesitating, with his arms full of Eighth year textbooks. Harry tried to tune out the noise (and the bodies moving past him), considering something.
Ron pulled him in for another hug. “Okay. I’ll go and talk to the ferret. Come ‘round the house soon, yeah?”
“Are we moving too fast?” Harry said, breaking away, gasping for breath. His hands stilled on Malfoy’s perky arse.
Ron shifted forward in his seat, his eyes were wide with excitement. ‘Oh yeah? Before you tell us, what were all the gifts again?’
Draco watched the rest of the film, feeling a bit warm in his chest. It was possibly on account of Harry sleeping there. Being
It’d been foolish to allow himself to get swept up in it. To yearn for something … and feel like he might actually get it …
Between kisses to Malfoy’s cheek, his chin, the underside of his jaw, Harry asked, ‘Why do you dress up, at a time like this?’
Harry and Draco settled down into seats, and Draco surveyed everyone. Dimitri reached out to hold Harry's hand, shooting him a pitying look.
‘Blaise says they joke that Charlotte looks like yours and Malfoy’s kid. You know, since she's kind of pointy but has lips shaped kind of like yours. Malfoy hates it.’
‘Not much of a dinner,’ Hermione said, shrugging her shoulders a bit after placing the items at their feet.
“Personally,” said Ginny, gesturing towards the ceiling, “I think if Morgana had only come forward earlier, this whole adolescent display of dramatics could’ve been avoided.” She had her feet splayed over Harry’s lap and her head lay on the armrest of the sofa. “And now I’ve got to deal with her passive-aggressiveness, with absolutely
Nonplussed, Ginny nodded. “All right, I’m going home then, because I've an early practice. See you tomorrow at the pub for Morgana’s 25th?”
He trailed a hand down his flat stomach, through the short blond hairs, and onto his aching cock, palming its length. He let out a little sound of pleasure, he allowed himself that.
The music shifted to a new song, and Astoria and Malfoy stopped dancing to embrace in the middle of the dancefloor. They kissed, and mumbled something private to each other. It was like they were the only two people in the world. They pulled apart, cast one more smile at one another, and then moved off to separate places. Harry’s eyes tracked Astoria over to her sister’s side, wrapping her up in a hug.
been good, right? It hadn’t been his imagination? Or had Draco been faking it the whole time? Just … just waiting for it to be over and done with, so that he wouldn’t have to talk to Harry again.
Those words eventually absorbed, but Draco wasn’t prepared for them. ‘Yeah, all right,’ he said, but internally he was … Well … perhaps best described by a bit of “?”, and some of “!”.
They both stood, and the dock rocked a little. Draco feared for a moment that his legs would give out—he felt a bit noodle-y. But, thankfully, he was able to make it to solid land, one step at a time, breathing in and out carefully, with Potter trailing behind him.
The blob stretched out, and took full form. It was … a slug, if he wasn’t mistaken. A slug floating around in the air.
He kissed her nose, which she crinkled in response, and then he turned to everyone, smiling. “Hermione’s awake, we can introduce you all to Hugo now. Though, the rooms a bit small for everyone at once.”
Harry bit back a groan, as Ron burst out laughing, spraying bits of egg over the table, to Hermione and Ginny’s immediate disgust.
Shouts and whoops startled Draco. The ruckus was coming from a group of blokes sat against the wall opposite the bar.
‘You can’t sacrifice yourself! I told you not to die! It isn’t an option!’ Draco said, grabbing on to Harry’s forearm tightly, keeping him from taking any more steps.
'I do.' And he flicked his tongue out, in the hopes that Draco would meet it with his own. And he did.
“I thought you’d think so. It’s called ‘The Sword in the Stone’. It’s another cartoon, just like Mulan.”
They left it at that, and Harry fell asleep feeling happy, light; believing that it could be Pansy on the other end—turning over a new leaf, being herself, apologising to him despite what someone like Malfoy might think.
, often these spells were used to connect wedding rings or to enchant a mirror so that you could gaze upon your lover’s face, and such things.’ He exhaled. ‘But—just as well—a spell can be used for two friends to make their journals chime when they receive a new message.’
Finally, Malfoy seemed to come to a decision. In a neutral tone, he said, ‘I’m supposed to kill Dumbledore. And find a way to let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts.’
Hermione and Ron exchanged a glance, and both shrugged. “The usual, really,” Ron said. “Just that you weren’t there, and Ginny was especially techy.”
Harry felt himself lean back against the door; he was knackered. He could probably fall asleep where he stood.
‘These are for you,’ Harry said, breathlessly, as he pushed his bouquet of red roses into Draco’s hands. Draco held them, as if automatically, while staring back at Harry’s face.
Harry knew there was absolutely no reason for Malfoy to trust him, to tell him anything. But he hoped—
Harry laughed under his breath, splaying himself over Draco, resting his cheek on the hip closest to him, and his hand on the other.  “
Harry grinned, and they moved into the sitting room, settling onto the couch. Harry put on the Ninth Doctor, from his first episode. That’s always the best place to introduce people to the show, he figured.
Thank you for reading so far ❤️ feedback is welcome (especially since no one reads this over besides me)
“Yeah, well. I can’t exactly be the epitome of Gryffindor, then, can I? Perhaps I’m pretty resourceful, cunning, and ambitious. I don’t know.”
It was written with a good quality quill. Good quality parchment too, actually—thick and creamy paper. The page had been torn on one side—came out of a notebook, then?
He edged even closer, and Malfoy’s breath hitched. Harry went for it, he leaned in, and brushed their lips together.
been the sort of person to have a clean, minimalist flat before. Or at least something far more expensive-looking. Maybe he’d been pretending to be that sort of person back then, or maybe Malfoy might’ve thought he’d been that person himself. He’d always seemed to care too much about how everyone saw him, and … and probably his parents would been overbearing about the way things were “supposed” to be.
Astoria’s expression was soft. “Thank you, Harry. It’s sweet of you to think of us. I’ll talk it over with him, all right?”
Malfoy let out a breathy laugh. “Spain. Of course.” He rubbed a hand over his face. “Where in Spain?”
“Beg pardon?” Draco asked, a bit annoyed at his fantasy being shut down so quickly. He turned to Potter then, and caught the stern expression on the man’s face, his unfocussed eyes looking outwards, unseeing.
A curt nod, and Malfoy stood up, tossing the magazine to the pile with the others. They made eye contact as they passed each other. Malfoy almost seemed … nervous? Close-up, his eyes were wide, a bit frantic looking.  Harry flashed what he hoped was an encouraging smile.
Draco turned back, and shot Harry a little smile, before resuming to pet the cat. “For the record, I am sorry for … well, everything, how I acted—what I said and did—back then.”
Malfoy didn’t respond, instead he untied the twine around his letters with those nimble, pale fingers.
Bit odd to see him without a t-shirt and shorts. Bit strange to see him at Draco's charity function in London, full stop.
It was … the hottest thing. Malfoy circling his own arsehole with long, slick fingers. His other hand gripping onto Harry’s cock, slicking over it, applying heavenly pressure. All while Harry looked down and watched both hands move.
they called “leaves”?), green in the centre, red on the outside. The little card in front read “peperomia graveolens”.
The ecstasy was plateauing. It wouldn’t be much longer. He straightened up, and gripped Malfoy’s hips again, thrusting in. Out.
At least, Ron hadn’t told him he need to learn any Italian. It was an area tourists went to, after all.
much ... too much of something. Harry felt himself stiffen. He and Malfoy were never this close—at least, not when they weren’t fighting.
“What the fuck,” said Seamus, from Malfoy’s left. And under his breath, “That’s bloody well spooky.”
She pulled him towards the dancefloor, where so many bodies were grinding and dancing along. June, Beth and Nancy trailed after them.
Potter grabbed Draco’s hands, and held them out to the sides. ‘So grab somebody, and get your ass on the dancefloor.’ He bit at a grin, lowering his arse towards the ground in time to the music.
Harry let out a satisfied sigh, after having enjoyed his laugh, and just grinned at Draco. “Alright, alright, just a second,” he said brightly, and went to wrestle Draco’s shoe out of the mud behind him.
Hermione reached over to pat his arm. ‘You’re a kind person, Harry. You see something wrong and you want to right it. There’s nothing the matter with that.’
Harry’s eyes caught on Draco Malfoy’s—looking back at him with an open, naked expression. Malfoy’s cheeks had coloured a blotchy pink; his jaw slackened.
The school, as a whole, felt tainted by the war. It wasn't quite the same home Harry had known for 6 or so years.
He paced around, through the crowds. He people-watched, reading some of the signs people held up—welcoming soldiers, friends, or family. A few people, mostly middle-aged ladies, cast Harry knowing smiles. Probably on account of the big bouquet of red roses in his hand, and the nervous way he was holding himself. Harry smiled back at those people—it was sort of an odd humanity moment. Two people sharing a smile over something universal: love. Well, not that Harry would say he was in love. Not yet. But … he was certainly at least half of the way there.
talked. And she was away a lot for work—which is fine, it’s great. Her career is important. It’s just … that absence became normal for me, and it became a bit of a distance emotionally, you know? It was almost like I already felt single, because at the end of the day, there was no one there to talk to.”
missing her, if you know what I mean? Like, I became resigned to it. And that resignation eventually became … acceptance. And acceptance became indifference.”
'Right.' Harry blinked at him like he'd only just realised that Draco was at work. 'Sorry, yeah, I'll just … try you later,' he said, getting quieter the more he spoke. Harry turned towards the door and reached out for the handle. Something made him pause, because he curled his fingers into a fist, and turned right back around.
'Harry,' he said carefully, arranging himself to sit up more comfortably. Harry looked back at him like he was expecting him to agree with all the bollocks he'd just been spouting. 'First of all—fuck off with all that. Second of all—last night was very fun. For the most part.' Harry just blinked at him. 'But I'm never drinking again.'
After another long day of paperwork, and idle chatter with Ron, Harry decided to walk home. It was already dark when he exited—though the streets were lit up in merry multi-coloured lights from shops, from holiday decorations—lights that bounced off the piles of snow that were collecting in heaps that hadn’t yet been shovelled. The London streets were busy with people, rushing around with glossy bags, getting their Christmas shopping done.
Harry winced, and shifted his weight from foot to the other. 'Yeah, I cast a Notice-me-not at the start. I've just lifted it temporarily so I could talk to you.'
‘I don’t know what you’re try to say,’ Harry murmured, pretending to be interested in something in the distance through the window.
Harry sucked in a breath, and his hands dropped from Draco’s arms. 'Okay. I'll ... yeah. Well, I'll send you the photos by email? Or on Facebook?'
‘You should know … sometimes I …' Draco began carefully. ‘Have cold feet, and they—well—seek out heat. All on their own.’
His thoughts flitted to Potter. He couldn’t help it. He thought about bright emerald eyes—glaring at him, daring him, or the way they softened when directed at a friend—Draco thought about scars and thick black curls. He thought about Potter’s hands, the cadence of his voice. The curve of his mouth. He wondered if he’d ever get to fly with Potter again. Eighth years weren’t allowed on the Quidditch teams, so, probably he wouldn’t. He tried to remember the last time they’d flown together.
After a bit, Harry leaned in to ask, “Who are these people?” As he looked at all the unfamiliar faces, people engaged in their own private conversations. Some were even snogging in a corner, or squished into an armchair.
Potter spoke slowly. Gently. “I get... well, Hermione calls them episodes, but I’m not sure that’s the right word. Anyway, I get them too. Where everything becomes... overwhelming.” He squeezed Draco’s clenched fists, just once. “It’s helpful to focus on what’s around you. Hermione calls it ‘grounding’. You try to focus on what you can hear, what you can smell, what you can touch, what you can see...”
Draco turned, ready to push past everyone and go to his room. And possibly never leave it again. Maybe he could take his NEWTs in his room, surely McGonagall would understand.
Harry sucked in his bottom lip to moisten it. And then he smiled. ‘I’m so grateful for you, too.’ He leaned in, and kissed Draco’s lips. Just lightly.
“Mum and baby are fine. Perfectly healthy,” Arthur said, standing up to pat Harry on the shoulder. “Ron’s in with them now, and we’ll get to go in once Hermione wakes up from the sedative.”
Draco searched Harry's eyes—impossibly close, impossibly bright. Those … those black eyelashes. 'I think this means yes, doesn’t it?' he breathed out. 'To your question.'
Harry didn’t have to be told twice. He leaned over, and positioned his cockhead. Then … he applied pressure. Malfoy’s arse gave way, and he was in … inside Draco Malfoy. He pushed in slowly, allowing time for Malfoy to adjust. Harry watched his face, looking out for discomfort. Malfoy just stared back at him, biting his lip.
“A little,” Draco answered. If it were all healthy skin, his body would’ve likely reacted to the touch much more embarrassingly.
She pulled her head out of the fire, and Harry got up to stand back. In a flash of green flames, she was there.
He glanced up again at Malfoy there. Just sitting at the Hufflepuff table, with no idea of what Harry was thinking.
“I love you, too.” This was all a lot for him to wrap his head around. He thought she'd scream at him, storming out the door, cursing his name.
“No, I haven’t forgotten,” Harry said slowly, furrowing his brow. “I guess we both can’t shake our seventeen-year-old selves.”
Harry returned with a tray of drinks, sinking into his seat. He tossed a small smile at Draco. But Draco forgot to return it, he was studying Harry's face.
Malfoy sat up fast, and the covers dropped from his chest. But Harry couldn’t think about that now. He had to get dressed. He started pulling out dresser drawers, dropping the blanket to fumble at pulling on fresh pants and joggers ...
Sound was beginning to return to normal—it was just a room, with people quietly chatting over meals.
Draco turned, momentarily forgetting his towel-problem because an apology was the last thing he expected to hear right then. “Sorry... for
So they went down to get bloody breakfast. And Harry reached for his hand in the elevator. And Draco couldn’t stop smiling. He’d turned into a sap, seemingly overnight.
wearing clothes,’ Harry said, turning his body around fully to face Malfoy, and gesturing towards his navy-blue boxer briefs. ‘See?’
Harry was still rooted to the spot. He should leave. Malfoy was fine. There was nothing left to say. Except … But, no, it was too hard to say ‘I’m sorry’. This was Malfoy. He’d certainly never apologised for stomping on his face. But, on the other hand, his conscience was nagging at him, telling him that he
. He didn’t really like using it either, truth be told. They weren’t exactly friendly. Harry only used it when the situation merited (i.e. when she deserved to be a bit annoyed). “Why would he do that, when Voldemort is dead?” He touched the door handle and glanced back at her. She hadn’t moved an inch.
'Thank you again Mr Malfoy,' Mr Creevey said, taking his hand again. 'We're just glad Colin's helping people.'
‘It’s all right, I reckon. Harry knows what it’s like to be cursed. He says it’s safe? Then it’s safe,’ Ron said.
“Er, right.” That was odd. Draco didn’t think people paid that much attention to his drinking habits.
Harry glared at the retreating back. He’d almost forgotten the Fifth Year, until he registered the pull of the fabric on his hand. Harry tightened his grip and swung the boy around to face him.
. The worst part was when Malfoy had died, slumping back with a soft gasp, and the life gone from his eyes. That’d been when Harry woke up.
It was definitely a lie, but … if Harry had said yes, Draco might’ve insisted on letting him sleep. And Harry would rather lose a little sleep if it meant getting to talk to Draco.
Neville chuckled. “Guess you missed that part of the conversation this morning. With all the hub-bub, Minerva cancelled all classes for the day.”
about what he looked like that evening. Which, he didn’t. Well... not really. As Pansy had repeated so many times—it'd be outside, in the dark.
The movie was over, with credits rolling. He quietly and gingerly climbed out of bed, so as not to wake Harry, and stepped over to the television.
Potter nudged Draco’s shoulder again, and swallowed his mouthful. “Can I have your second marshmallow?”
Without answers, he found himself talking to Luna next, but he was distracted. He kept touching the sticker on his hand, tracing its outline. Why on earth had Malfoy given it to him?
Were there even any good dancing stations? He usually stuck to the dramatic readings or classical music.
A curly browned-haired woman walked over. She had an apron tied around her waist, and a tight-lipped smile.
Harry handed it over, and Malfoy forked up some his food and handed it back. They were careful to not brush fingers. A splat of white sauce dropped on Harry's pizza, and then he took a bite.
He Floo-ed over, and they settled into the sun room chairs in front of the laptop. Pansy placed one hand over her heart, and clicked.
Potter exhaled slow. And Draco could see him rubbing his palms against his jeans out the corner of his eye.
Harry climbed the stairs to the next floor up; Fred and George’s door was wide open. He sighed heavily, and took a step into the bedroom. He hoped he hadn’t been too awful, there. But it did feel like a relief to get his feelings out.
Hermione spoke up first, telling them when the funerals were set. Harry only half-listened, sipping his tea, and taking a hot scone onto his plate.
Harry took a few steps closer, looking over Draco's shoulder at the organ pipes towering above. He glanced back at Draco, and asked, 'Is this you, now? More fascinated by Muggle culture, rather than …'
Climbing into the driver's side, Harry strapped himself in and leaned forward to check the overhead mirror. Next, he stuck a key into a keyhole beside the wheel, and turned it. The whole machine whirled to life, and Draco gripped onto the edge of the seat without thinking. He wasn't quite sure about this. It did seem rather dangerous.
Malfoy took a sip of Firewhisky. ‘I have cleaned every surface of my flat. Including behind the refrigerator. Ten times over. And I’ve read nearly every book I own.’
Potter backed up, bobbing his head, revealing a bare, sun-kissed and toned torso. Draco sucked in a breath.
Draco pulled back, and it took him a beat longer to open his eyes slowly—which just made Harry want to kiss him again. 'How are you planning to spend your Saturday, Harry?'
“I don’t hate any of you.” Had that really been what Potter had thought all that time? “I just... didn’t think I’d be welcome.”
Harry randomly grabbed a decent-sized, brown, leather-bound one off the shelf, then navigated his way through the other students to pay at the counter.
No response. The hand finished tearing the page, and was now folding it up slowly … carefully, as Draco watched on.
'My darling,' she began. 'I hated to see you struggle and isolate yourself.' She looked around the room again. 'You locked yourself up in this little flat all summer long. Pansy had even mentioned that you had failed to return her letters.'
A smile blossomed on Draco’s lips, and his eyes shined, reflecting the lights of shop windows and cafés around them. Squeezing Harry’s hand, he said, ‘Je t’aime aussi, Harry.’
Draco moved. He toed off his shoes and sat back on the bed, swinging his legs over to lay on top of it. ‘Lie down with me?’ he asked.
Dave led him into the centre, and began moving to the beat. Dave danced like water. Every movement flowed seamlessly into the next. They were so close—Draco could feel the heat off him. Lord, the man was tall. Draco had to crane his neck if he wanted to get a look at his face.
They chewed in silence for a moment. They were lovely snaps. He should get the recipe for Ron to make …
Draco slowly approached the counter just as Potter and Weasley walked away from it, with matching confused expressions. They didn’t even spare Draco a glance. He was used to that though.
Malfoy just went ahead and rushed in to kiss him, right then and there, fisting at Harry’s suit jacket lapels.
‘Good.’ She eyed him with her mouth pinched to the side, then let out a long sigh. ‘Ah, why did I even think to show you this,
‘Mmhmm,’ she said dryly, narrowing her eyes at him. ‘And it has nothing to do with his arse in those trousers, huh?’
By lunch Harry was certain he couldn’t figure this out on his own. He needed help … but Ron was Ginny’s sister. He needed a more neutral party—someone with good, sensible advice. He needed ... Hermione. Only problem was: it was rather hard to get her alone.
Something loud woke Draco up in a panic. As he came to, it became clear that the sound was an awful ringing. Like that of a sodding Muggle telephone.
Harry pushed through, past the mourners and celebrators, the living and the dead, and knelt at Draco’s feet. He removed his cloak, tucking it away, and wrapped his hands gently around Draco’s forearms.
'Did you?' Harry said, with amusement in his voice, as he brought the glass up to his lips and took a drink.
Harry opened it anyway. Inside, without a note or anything, was the engagement ring. He deflated, crumpled into himself, and rubbed his eyes as tears began to pour out again.
Draco shrugged. ‘Exactly what it sounds like. The war is over now, and … I … I may not see you again.’
Potter nodded, and dipped his head down, so that Draco couldn’t see his expression. “Alright. Yeah, maybe I’ll swim again or see what Ron’s up to.”
The only real issue might be getting meat to eat. Draco didn’t know if he could muster killing a living thing... not again.
Draco lingered a moment, paddling around, looking up at the blue sky—with nary a cloud in sight. Just one wispy one making a slow path overhead.
He glanced at it—it seemed like a list of activities, things like: bubble bath, watch a favourite film, light a scented candle. Bit romantic, really.
They entered the Great Hall, and Harry’s eyes automatically sought out Draco. He was there, yeah, at the Hufflepuff table chatting with Charlotte. She was frowning, shaking her head from side to side as Draco told her something. Harry had to bite back a sigh. He wanted to know what was going on, but marching right over there and demanding to know was probably not the gentlest way of trying to figure it out.
He took a deep breath. ‘My aunt and uncle forced me to cook for them when I was a kid, so … so I’ve been pretty used to it from a young age.’ He picked up a packet of basmati rice, and tossed in the trolley. ‘But it wasn’t until this past summer that I started cooking again, for
They fell into a silence again. It was easy to do. Didn’t Potter see that he should stop trying to spark a conversation? (Or whatever the hell he was attempting.) His efforts were futile. Pointless. The two of them were too different. They
Draco sent Robespierre off, and he returned empty handed. Which was quite normal to expect, since Harry had work.
Harry watched Malfoy, with legs swinging up on that desk, and a thoughtful expression on his face. If only Ron and Hermione could see him like this, then they’d know what Harry knew, that Malfoy was not terribly
Draco took it and moved it off to the side, keeping the big tome he’d been reading in front of himself.
Draco took a sharp breath. Potter shouldn’t be able to tell that, it’s a dim room, and they were still a couple metres apart. Fine, whatever, he’d come clean. He’s not ashamed to care about a girl who has let her whole family down and may never have true love (just like him). “Yes.” He waved a hand towards the telly. “Mulan.”
He opened his mouth a fraction, and Malfoy’s tongue wasted no time in pushing through, in exploring, in rubbing at Harry’s tongue.
‘Maybe I should’ve been easier on them.’ Potter looked off at the distant mountain to the right of them. His eyes glassy and unfocussed.
Draco fiddled with the tablecloth edge. So there’d been a party, then. He presumed Potter had been there. He wondered if everyone knew about this party but him. Pansy and Blaise included.
coffee places. He was somewhat-familiar with those establishments, always keen on invading one’s privacy. “Bartholomew,” he muttered. Like he was going to fall for that trap.
Malfoy nodded, looking around. His fingers curled on the table in front of him, pale and slender. And Harry couldn't help staring at them.
, knew who they both were—and did that anyway. Did it mean anything? Or was it exactly as Draco said—he'd needed something, just something to wank to, to help him sleep.
Oh, Merlin. Just the very suggestion got Draco’s heartrate going. Blood was... definitely pumping. He licked at his bottom lip. “Well... it certainly wouldn’t be comfortable watching a film in our school uniforms, now would it?”
Their food arrived, and Potter pulled away. Draco let go of his hold on the tablecloth. He’d wrinkled it. He did a quick swipe of his hand in an attempt to smooth it, before the waitress set his plate there.
Harry looked back towards Draco and Astoria—but found it was only Draco, and he was making his way back to Harry. Beyond him, Harry caught a flash of someone leaving the room.
He looked at her, thinking over her question. “Not really,” he answered, and found it felt true. He needed to think about the day, about his revelations.
He felt a furious blush coming on, and turned away to face the wall. Harry seemed to think nothing of that, moving over to his corner of the room. Draco was definitely not going to look. Instead he inspected the green wallpaper, and the little corner at the bottom of the seam, that’d got itself un-stuck. Wallpaper was nice, sure. Because of the wide variety of patterns. But paint was just tidier over time, wasn’t it? Although... paint could chip, come to think of it.
He needed to know. He came back into himself, finding Minerva and Neville staring at him. “Er, sorry, what was that?”
Harry went straight into a toilet stall, locked the door, and leaned against the wall. He tried to school his breathing—it was too fast. From running off quickly, probably. And not because he was upset.
“Draco Malfoy?” asked Rose, evidently up from her nap. She appeared in front of Draco, peering up at him curiously.
She quirked an eyebrow. 'Did you and,' she cleared her throat, and very-obviously fought back a full grin, 'Harry Potter see one another?'
“I’m busy!” He examined the thing. It really didn’t look easy. But... he can’t just have wet hair. It could dry funny.
And then Potter leaned forward, brought his face right up close to Draco’s, and, kissed him. Tentatively and sweetly. Those perfect lips so soft and pliant against Draco’s.
While he waited for it to cool a bit, Harry got to work, pulling out the clean cutting board, and his good knife. Then he began chopping the onion and garlic.
Harry fiddled with his own hands, not knowing what to do with himself. Malfoy emerged a moment later, dressed in a grey blazer, and was pulling on a grey herringbone overcoat.
Draco's fingers drifted below the hem of Harry's shirt, and came up underneath it, to fumble against bare, hot skin. Draco hooked his fingers into Harry's shorts.
And Potter was a fantasy for him, a fantasy that only now he allowed himself to indulge in. That was all it was.
Draco was shuffled in through along with the crowd, making him feel rather like a sheep. People were brushing up against him on all sides. It ... wasn’t exactly ideal. But his heartrate quickened in a sort-of nervous anticipation.
Ruben seemed more serious than the others, so Draco wouldn't have guessed him to be the party one. Ruben starred straight into Draco's eyes, unblinking, as they shook hands firmly,
Harry sat on the bed beside him; the mattress dipped and the springs creaked. ‘I don’t want to sleep in Fred’s bed … can I sleep here?’
the one who has been insisting all year that Malfoy is up to something!’ she poked a finger at Harry’s chest. ‘You can’t trust him! Don’t you think that whatever this is—with him—could be a trap? I really feel like—like you’re making a terrible mistake!’
The air was quite nice and fresh, Draco had to admit. After being stuck inside for one day, it was good to stretch his legs and admire the scenery one more time before they had to go. Not that being stuck inside was bad, of course. It'd involved snogging with Harry, amongst other things. But... outside was nice too. They could still snog outside, he supposed.
Harry looked over to said-person. Said-person looked up from his book and shot Harry a warning glare. Harry looked away quickly, back to Hermione, sighing. “We hate each other,” he said miserably.
“And you pestered him about his personal letters, even after he asked you not to?” she asked, raising an eyebrow.
It cocked its head and extended a leg, revealing a cream-coloured envelope. Harry untied it, fingers smoothing over its surface. It felt like expensive paper—thick and soft. He wondered at what it could possibly be.
She patted his knee and smiled. “A kiss can be quite powerful, especially in conjunction with magic. It binds and seals. So, yes, it was rather necessary. That is, unless you wanted the whole spell to unravel and to start again from the top.”
‘But they’re romantic!’ Tejal piped up. Her face lit up, all wistful-like, as if he were some character in a romance novel.
'Yes,' Draco said, nodding slowly. Harry seemed quite happy to've shifted the focus of conversation from himself to youth drop-ins and charities.
The walls inside were painted white, and a table was set near the entrance. Desks and shelves overflowing with papers lined the walls. There was a whiteboard with hand-written patient notes on one wall.
Something was floating around in circles in front of her. Her ghost friend, the one in the funny clothing.
Harry tore at the Father Christmas-patterned wrapping paper, to reveal a chunky maroon-coloured knitted blanket. 'It's beautiful,’ he said, holding it up so he could see it. 'Thank you, Draco I love it so much.' He leaned over to kiss Draco hard on the cheek. Harry's heart was so full.
He leisurely soaped himself, and the wall, off. He took time to wash his hair thoroughly, massaging his scalp, and breathing in the citrusy scent of the shampoo.
That earned another laugh. ‘Sorry, yeah it’s been a long time since I’ve attempted it. Rather rusty, aren’t I?’
He shut the journal closed, and then climbed under the covers. It was a while before he fell asleep.
Draco placed the box on the desk, and went over near his mini fridge area to fumble around for something—forks and two small plates, Harry realised, as he walked back over with them in hand. He set them on top of the box, and then transfigured another chair from a scrap piece of paper on the desk. It came out all white with blurry scribbled writing on it.
He took a step closer. ‘Who else knows I’m here? Does the Prophet know?’ His eyes showed a dangerous intensity.
Merlin, he looked even better close-up. Malfoy was one of those types, Harry realised, that you don’t always notice are handsome. Like, in photographs, it doesn’t always show through. But when you’re close to them, you see all the little details that make them handsome … In Malfoy’s case, his smooth complexion (Fuck, he had, like,
Closing his eyes, he could see Potter very clearly in his imagination. The lopsided smile, the shorts. Draco found himself smiling. He tried to focus in on the music, and he bobbed his head—slowly at first.
'I see.' Draco followed suit with a towel Harry'd lent him—it had a giant smiling sun wearing sunglasses, and a rather cheerful rainbow.
Seemingly bewildered and amused all at once, Harry asked, 'Would you rather I wear a t-shirt, shorts, and a pair of sunglasses to your fundraiser? To your workplace?'
Potter faced him and smiled cheekily, walking backwards. Draco very much did not look down, using all the self-restraint he possessed. Sure, it was dark, but he was quite certain he’d be able to make out everything in the moonlight.
Draco let a laugh escape, before he could clamp his mouth shut. He didn't want Potter to get the wrong idea. Because... Merlin, the 'demand' had been so bloody endearing, and the memory of it—just... it made him want to laugh. Not in a mean way, but rather in a happy way? If that was possible? "Sorry," he rushed to say, and cleared his throat, taking another step forward. "It was fine."
Draco brushed his fingertips over Harry’s bicep—he had a tiny raised bit of skin on the back of his arm, near the armpit. A mole perhaps? He turned his head to bury his nose in Harry’s inky black curls, and kissed gently.
‘I still feel as if I should’ve done something. I feel like I let Charity Burbage down. I feel … like I’m partly responsible.’
Draco scrolled down—he never scrolled down. Hadn't known to, before his class. The video description read, simply:
Harry had to smile at that. Hogwarts’ best, huh? Better than Snape, better than Slughorn? Well ... he could actually believe it, couldn’t he?
Draco rolled his eyes. Pansy was so bloody dramatic. The video ended. It was just a black screen. ‘It’s stopped.’
This was the boy who danced in the middle of the Great Hall with Parvati Patil, and the man who danced with him at red-tinged gay club in Ibiza Town.
'Draco, don't give up just when you've got everything you've always wanted. Choose happiness.' She looked into his eyes meaningfully. 'Or you'll regret it for the rest of your life.'
“I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but, you do seem... sensitive.” Potter leaned back in his chair to worry his bottom lip with his teeth, watching Draco.
He was just walking toward his classroom, and Malfoy had appeared from the other end of the hallway.
Draco sucked in a breath, and reached out for Harry's ankle (the closest body part to him). 'Harry—'
Harry opened his mouth to say something, but couldn’t find any words. He turned to watch the treeline, too.
He patted her knee. “This is pretty strange, isn’t it? Us trying to figure out who’s the ghost sending me love notes?”
“Ah. Interesting name. Er … Drah-co, and … Ast-or-ia?” she asked, blinking at the names that popped up on the screen.
Malfoy’s expression went from confused contemplation to darkly amused in a flash. “Merlin …” He rubbed a palm over his face. “Similar reasons to you, I suppose. Except in my case, actually based in reality. I used to be a Death Eater, or have you forgotten?”
Harry was calling him … intelligent? Well, it was obvious that he was book-smart anyhow, just … it was different knowing that Harry …
“I think I do,” Draco said, closing his eyes briefly. “It was easy because it meant I was special—part of a superior group. It appealed to my sense of pride. He told me I was better than Muggles, Muggleborns and Halfbloods—simply for having been born a Malfoy—and I accepted it.”
He turned, and smiled at the latest hair change—bright green and styled to defy gravity, bit like a fire. 'Hello Morgan. I like the new hair. Were you going for a Floo flame look?'
He tossed the paper aside, and lay flat on his back, with arms outstretched. He starred up at his white, slightly cracked ceiling.
Malfoy’s eyes were daggers, boring into him. “Because I don’t like you,” he said, heavily enunciating each word. “In fact, I hate you. Now if you’re bothering me because of … that
Hermione shot him a warm smile. “I think so. Say … since we’re sure it isn’t someone in Gryffindor, maybe we should ask the Fat Lady if she knows anything? The notes have to be getting in somehow, and we know it isn’t by owl.”
Draco nodded, peering up at Harry. So, they got up and collected their trunks from beside the front door. Draco trailed behind Harry silently, as they ascended the creaky stairs.
They settled into a quiet two-person table by one of the few windows. There were only two other patrons, eating quietly on the other side of the pub.
Harry spread loose flour over the clean countertop and tipped his bowl over, so that the dough fell down with a plop, making a small cloud of flour puff up in the air. 'I'm famous because my parents were murdered protecting me.' He pressed his hands into the dough, and kneaded—hard. 'I'm famous because a homicidal maniac tried to kill me several times.' Harry kept kneading, throwing his weight into the base of his palms.
“—Ron sent a few samples for us to try out. I’m sure it’s not really my thing. Something about a bouncing ball that never quits. Do you want …" She paused. “Harry, are you even listening?”
‘Easy, get closer,’ Harry said, shifting himself closer to Draco so that his chest was just barely touching Draco’s arm, and his face rather close to the side of Draco’s head.
Laughing, Draco carried Astoria through the threshold of their hotel room—Astoria had insisted on it, on both those elements: being carried, and the hotel room. Something about a Muggle tradition she liked, as, rather than going home, they were someplace special for the night. They could order room service, and not have to worry about tidying up.
“Draco, darling,” she spoke slowly, that she was trying to say the next part just right. “Have you ever
Harry bit back a happy smirk, and put a stasis charm on their leftover food before shrinking it, so that he could tuck it away in his pocket. And then he said, “Let's go,” and moved to join the crowd of walkers.
(He telephoned the store. It was too late to cancel it. The cabinet was already en route. Bloody efficient.)
So, Friday night was pub night with their friends, and sometimes old Hogwarts acquaintances. They’d meet at the old Hog & Boar, snatch up one of the sticky faux leather, peeling booths, and laugh the night away over pints. It was usually the best part of Harry’s week.
He was pretty, for a boy, Harry decided. He sort of ... glowed. Maybe it was because he was pale. But … he just stood out. In a room full of people, he sucked in all the light.
Draco swallowed, and tried to ignore the visceral reaction that name caused. ‘I … do …' It’d been all over the Prophet. It’d been all anyone ever talked about for a long while—how Potter had snapped and left everything and everyone behind. There had been sad photos of Granger and Weasley walking in the rain on the front cover. Yes, Draco remembered it well.
Draco glanced up. ‘Yes.’ He cleared his throat. ‘We should test it.’ He slid Harry’s back over to him.
Draco smirked. “Haven’t you got enough love notes, Potter? I see you getting them in the post every day. Fans from all over the world.” He twirled his fork around in a dramatic flourish.
And so he danced, without letting himself think for even a second on how it would seem to others, because no one would ever see it. He danced until he was sweating through his shirt. He collapsed back onto his sofa, laughing to himself.
“What a nice cat,” Draco said, as he pet her stomach. The cat went to swipe at him, but he dodged her claws at the last moment. “Ah yes, you’re very tough, aren’t you? A fierce predator.”
‘Right,’ Harry said. And then, he yawned. He closed his eyes and tilted his face into the pillow. This probably wasn’t the right time to say it, but, well, dumb Gryffindor courage … ‘Would you ever be my boyfriend?’
Harry sighed. ‘That about covers it, yeah.’ He slumped in the chair, wishing he could slide off of it onto the floor, and then have the floor swallow him up whole.
Harry raised his eyes then—watching her excitedly spin the bottle in the centre of the circle, then back away to see who it would land on.
He ignored her question. ‘What happened? Is everyone okay?’ He looked around them—the castle seemed whole, just as they’d left it. From what he could see, anyway. But looks can be deceiving …
Harry leaned in. He smelled nice. Draco had missed his smell. 'It's, ah, a gay club.' He looked at Draco with uncertainty. 'We don't have to—'
Draco deflated, and allowed himself to look, just for a moment. Because this was it—there weren't going to be other chances to see him. Draco was going home, and normal life would soon re-claim him.
She licked her lips. ‘Okay, don’t freak out … but Blaise and I might have slipped a little something in your juice this morning.’
Sighing, Harry prepared to tell her to bugger off. But the door opened again, revealing all the grandparents with Rose. Molly caught Harry’s eye—and she was absolutely aglow with happiness. “Your turn, Harry and Draco. Room 202.”
. Disgusting. You should’ve taken the bubble-gum shot, Hermione.’ Ron shook his head in dismay. Then he rounded on him, ‘You dodged a bullet there, Harry.’
They found the place: a tiny little restaurant with paned glass on the façade, and a terrace at the back overlooking the square below. Harry held the door open for Malfoy, and then he approached the host standing behind a tall little desk, dressed sharply in a black and white suit.
'No,' Harry said, taking hold of Draco's waist and turning him—switching their places. 'Can I suck you off instead?' He wanted to do something for Draco first, to show how much he appreciated him.
‘Morning,’ Harry said back, directed to all of them, as he smiled a little. He’d been a bit presumptuous to sit there, probably.
'Perfect, thanks. I'll just send it off to the Department, then.' She went back to the fireplace, and Floo-ed the form over to the Department of Arts and Culture. 'Now then, what's with this dancing alone in your living room thing?'
Potter’s mouth twisted into a slight frown. ‘I’m a bit angry with Britney at the moment.’ His fingers released Draco’s wrist.
Harry’s face felt hot. Suddenly the intimacy of this strange meeting struck him. He was alone, in the hospital wing, at night, with a nearly-shirtless Draco Malfoy, who, inexplicably, might be, could be—an attractive person. It was enough to flip one’s world upside down.
“To be honest, I think Ron and I have both sensed a distance forming there, between you two. And at the end of the day, it’s up to the both of you if you want to try to get back what you used to have … whether that’s through a series of long, difficult, honest conversations ... or whether it's with couples' counselling, or some other way. Or, you could take some time apart, maybe even break up, if that’s what you decide is best. And if that is what happens, Ron and I are going to support you, you know that, don’t you?”
