As they all sat down with their mugs of tea, Andromeda asks, “Draco, dear, how is your research going?”
Harry suspects that Draco and him had kept inadvertently challenging each other with how much they could drink. Harry is finding out quite quickly that he cannot hold his liquor nearly as good as Draco can.
“Of course not! Don’t be silly. Come, come. Sit down, both of you.” She ushers them into the cozy living room where they sit on opposite sofas.
It seems like the bastard is not nearly as drunk as he should be after the drinks they’ve had. Fucking hot arsehole. He feels like a right knob next to him.
He tries his best to look down at Teddy without dripping any of his own ice cream, which was melting faster than he anticipated. He licks the side of his cone when the sound of a chair scraping makes him look up and see Draco’s slender figure rising from his chair.
“I was put in Slytherin because I…because my whole family has always been in Slytherin. It’s what was expected of me, it’s what I expected of myself…and it is just what happened. Had I been sorted into another house; my parents would have thought there was something wrong with me.”
“I started taking a medicinal course, the hardest one I had ever taken. The professor was teaching us about psychoactive potions and mental health and suddenly I kind of…
Harry had already found Draco to be extremely attractive, but seeing him in direct sunlight makes every beautiful feature about him even more pronounced. His impeccable posture makes him look confident despite the colour in his cheeks that betrayed his embarrassment, and oh how Harry relishes in it. Something about Draco blushing gives Harry just a little too much joy.
Draco looks in his eyes as if searching for something and takes a deep breath. “It only made me want to kiss you more than usual,” he manages, looking at the ground. Harry’s heart begins racing again. This was probably more than he had intended to admit. It was too dark for Harry to see if Draco was blushing, although he didn’t need proof to know that he was.
Draco lets out a breath as if he’s been holding it. Puts both hands on either side of Harry’s head against the wall and inches closer so slowly that Harry thinks he might’ve gone cross-eyed.
Harry takes a slow, deep breath and tries to steady himself despite feeling as if his whole world is shaking.
Harry and Teddy are taking a less-than-leisurely stroll through Diagon Alley. Teddy is on a mission.
Harry is sure he looked a mess-- his red button-up shirt and brown jeans must look ridiculous to Draco. His hair is still damp from the shower, since he had forgotten to dry it in his haste to leave the house. Slightly self-conscious, he follows Draco to a pretty outdoor patio bar seat in the garden where it was a bit quieter. Harry couldn’t help but feel that Draco was amused at something.
As if hearing his thoughts, Draco dips a finger into his shot-glass and sucks his finger while maintaining eye contact with Harry.
“Spying, were we?” Harry says, as they turned the corner. Teddy made the wise choice of staying silent.
Draco stops in his tracks and whips around violently. “We’ve been calling each other Potter and Malfee all evening, haven’t we?”
Draco fixes him with a steady, sobering gaze, and it’s the most serious he’s seen him all evening. He shakes his head resolutely.
“Good luck, dear. I believe you’ll do well, as I always do,” Andromeda supplies kindly, reaching over to gently pat Draco’s hand. He gives her a small, shy smile in return. “And you, Harry? How’s work been treating you?”
“A five-year-old patient is nearly done with her treatment for a rare blood condition, and it looks like she’s going to make a full recovery. It has been exhausting for everyone involved, though,” he chuckles.
It’s so ridiculous that Harry has to laugh, breaking the kiss. Draco looks at him with the goofiest smile Harry had ever thought he would see on a Malfoy and with eyes that are drunk in more ways than one.
Draco looks at Harry for a short second and nods. “That’s alright. It’s a lot. We don’t have to talk about it now.”
Draco looks at Harry with a relieved expression. “Yes, actually. It made me want to know more about myself, if anything. There was a lot of shit under my gorgeous outer shell, just so you know.”
Draco eyes the full shot-glass sitting in front of him, giving Harry a mischievous look that is so hot that Harry thinks he might pass out. Draco Malfoy makes everything look sexy, the absolute bastard.
Draco glances at Harry, unsure and a little bit frightened. Harry nods behind the little boy’s head and smiles.
“I–and are you…are you kissing me because of what you said earlier? Because I listen to you? Because I can’t–”
Harry looks over his closet for the fifth time. They had agreed to meet at eight o’clock at a bar Draco picked out and Harry had never heard of before. He has a whole hour to take a shower and decide what to wear, yet he can do nothing but stare at his closet and ponder over the fact that he probably does not own a single item of clothing that would look cool enough to compete with even Draco’s pyjamas.
“Okay,” Harry whispers, his fear subsiding. He smiles shyly at Draco, his breath catching as Draco comes closer again in one swift movement.
Harry suddenly feels thankful for the long process he had gone through after the war that made it possible for him to have conversations like this at all. And with Draco Malfoy, his renowned former enemy, no less.
“Believe me, I’m not” Harry grumbled low when Draco kept teasing him while bobbing himself up and down, increasing his speed after each time, and all Harry could do was stay there and try not to come. Draco fitted him like a piece of puzzle on every aspect, and he was glad Pansy made his friends tie him up and brought him to his party. If Pansy hadn’t done all of this, he might have never got the chance to see Draco again. While Draco was still lost in ecstasy, Harry slowly grabbed hold of his waist and rolled them both over before Draco could even react.
far from now, but well, I will” Theo winked at him and leaned closer to mumble “So…I noticed something”
“I need five minutes, sir, that’s all” Harry put his foot in between the door when Lucius was about to shut the door in front of him. It was barely a few weeks after he and Draco got back together, things were back to the ways they were, but Harry wanted more to happen, he wanted to get married to Draco
“Please, just, er…” Harry looked at the clock and back at Draco, this was the perfect moment, the blond was already standing, he was sitting on his couch, just a bit more “Five minutes, that’s all”
fall for Blaise. And even though it took him months to deny it at first, he still had to realise the brutal fact, that he was in love with Blaise. And after half a year, Blaise started caring for him way more than a roommate, or a friend should, he had shown Ron multiple times that he was serious. But Ron didn’t let it happen that easily though, he wanted to make sure Blaise was faithful to him, so he temporarily put his feelings behind and tested Blaise’s feelings first.
The blond couldn’t even argue with that, he had seen himself in the mirror being fucked by Harry once, he looked like he even craved for more. Harry pushed Draco’s legs up so it was pressed against his chest, he looked down and thrusted faster “
“We are not, just a little bit” Harry said in his raspy voice, the same voice that always held Draco back in their bed. Sometimes he knew Harry did this on purpose but he couldn’t resist this urge against his boyfriend with high libido. Draco met his lips halfway for a chaste kiss and grabbed at his gifts tightly so they wouldn’t fall.
He said, opening the door and running out of the room as soon as possible. He ran, he ran like someone was after him, he didn’t stop until he reached the Slytherin Dungeon.
“I will tell you…soon” Draco said, he might have to tell him eventually, and he also figured he has to stop being so harsh on Potter, he was just doing it out of habit. They have known each other long before that, he has to understand him. Draco started getting sleepy after a while and soon went to sleep.
” Pansy waved at him repeatedly until he noticed her “Take a break! You too, Theo. Wait until Ron’s done!” Draco nodded and leaned back on the table. He avoided Smith’s eyes and looked at Ron, who was posing awkwardly with the small dragon on his shoulder, and Blaise suggesting him to relax. Draco diverted his eyes and looked at the corner of the room, Harry was standing there, talking to Neville, Dean and Seamus, laughing casually, Draco glared at the git. Of course he was still pissed about Harry for not remembering anything from that night, he hated himself for being the only one to remember, he hated everything, because Harry was the one to initiate the kiss and he didn’t remember, it was infuriating. And he didn’t notice it but when he looked back at the git again, Harry was actually looking at him. They stared at each other for a second before Draco tear his eyes away first, watching Ron again.
“Oh, right” Pansy nodded along with Draco, Blaise was never the one to take action without thinking of everything out carefully. If he was unsure, he would never do it “So you think he actually likes Weasley?”
“Two hundred percent sure” Theo chuckled quietly and based on the gentle way Blaise was guiding Ron to help him with the photoshoot, Draco was two hundred percent sure too.
“Nothing, I just can’t believe I’m in Draco Malfoy’s room, former enemy, current boyfriend” He said in a proud tone, he grazed his hand over the table, the curtains and the paintings “Draco Malfoy’s bedroom, where he studies and sleeps”
“Oh, er, I feel like I should explain everything to you” Harry began once Rose ran back to the kitchen with Ron, but he paused and picked up his fork
“It’s alright, I won’t tell Pansy and everyone else you’re back together with Abbott” He leaned on the wall of the lift, giving up.
five years ago and it started as a place only a few wizards come, throughout the years, the place was now crowded with people “See? Not a strip club”
going to date someone that looks like Draco, Ron” Harry glared at his best friend, it wasn’t like he didn’t try. He had spotted many people with gorgeous blond hair and figures like Draco, but none of them made him feel the way Draco did, that warm feeling in his chest and the urge to be next to Draco all the time “I’ll deal with it myself”
Draco settled on one of the chairs Ginny had set outside the Burrow earlier and held on his cup of cocoa between his cold hands. He looked up at the sky and watched as the others played Quidditch at night. It was Oliver’s suggestion, who was also invited over by Percy, and everyone loved the idea. They have split into two teams, Ron and Oliver were Keepers, George and Bill were Beaters. Ginny tried to persuaded Fleur to be Chasers with her but failed because she was already pregnant. And Percy agreed to play after a lot of pleading from his own boyfriend Oliver, while Harry and Draco were Seekers. However, it has been a long time since he played Quidditch and Draco only joined the first three matches, after that he had switched with Charlie. Draco looked at his boyfriend and realised just how charming Harry looked flying on a broom, his hair was even messier due to the wind, and the way he flew so smoothly to find the Snitch was making Draco hot in his cheeks.
“I can’t believe you collect articles about me” Harry grinned, showing him the articles in his hands “You like me and you’re obsessed with me”
men still ogle at me? I am yours, why are you worried? If I’m yours, I’d never let another man touch me. They can look as much as they want, they can never have me. Don’t you get it?” He said, he folded his legs together and looked down “Why do you have to care about everyone else when you could just care about me?”
“I’d love to have a dinner date with you tomorrow night, Harry. I’ll wait for you” Draco smiled, his breath hitched when Harry wrapped his arms around the blond’s waist, pulling him close “Really? In front of all of our friends?”
“Great show, honestly” Blaise said while draping his arm over Ron and gave them a slow clap “We rarely ever get to watch live porn”
“Fine, you can stay” Draco sighed, he didn’t understand why he let Potter stay, there was something in him that couldn’t say no, because it seemed like they were alike “Don’t sit too close to me, and not one word”
” Draco raised his head, stayed up on his elbows and ogled at Harry “I can’t believe you hid that from me for 27 years. Well what are you waiting for?” Draco opened his legs wide in the bed, pointing at Harry’s cock and at his loosen entrance “
Harry sucked on his bottom lip, his tongue exploring Draco’s mouth while his hands found Draco’s face and he cupped it, warming the blond up. Harry smelled nice, like treacle tart and chocolates, just what Draco loved. He clutched on Harry’s hair, pushing deeper into the kiss.
“Okay” She held his hand and dragged him back in the room, he kept his eyes on the ground until Hermione led him to the chair next to hers “Sit down”
” Draco took a sip from his cocktail and looked at the Auror lazily “It’s still their anniversary, they’d still want to enjoy it alone”
So he knew Draco didn’t trust him, the blond eyed him carefully and listened. Draught of Living Death was indeed one of the hardest potions to make, he couldn’t even make it to perfection back in Sixth Year, but somehow Harry did it, so perhaps he should listen. Draco held tightly to the dagger and crushed it like he asked, earning a really small smirk on Harry’s face.
“Good” Pansy smacked on Harry’s chest while Hermione nodded and they both left to get to the other side of the room “
. Why don’t you ask me that again a year from now?” Draco laughed softly at his offer and kissed his lips. It wasn’t a joke when Harry asked that, if he could, he would get married to Draco right this second. After all, he has Pansy already downstairs and she had become an officiate for Blaise and Ron’s wedding before.
“Hey, I bought ice cream” Harry said when he heard the squeaking sound the stairs made whenever someone go down. It was
? Now that’s a bit old fashioned, Mister Malfoy” Pansy laughed, Narcissa hasn’t spoken a word, instead she just looked around the place “I think when it’s time, he’ll get married”
“I’m sorry” He put his hand on Harry’s chest, feeling comfortable with that action “I really am. When it comes to the things I’ve done to you…it’s too much, that I didn’t know where to start”
“I said what I said, I like you, from the moment Hermione invited you to my house so you could help me with…everything” Harry said. And it was true, a year after their graduation, Pansy had nagged him with Hermione so he’d help Harry be ready for social events, like some kind of assistant, since Harry was the saviour and all. Unfortunately the git had no taste in fashion and anything. Draco had been there for Harry before every event he had to attend, and it had gone like that for three years, that was when Draco decided he could not work with someone he likes because it’d interfere with his business, he gave up. But they still remained friends until now, Draco was never able to get over Harry, no matter how hard it was.
subtle “Hermione found out first, then Pansy, then surprisingly, Theo, the last one to find out is Ron, but he somehow became the biggest supporter, he kept wanting me to confess to you”
like Harry more than you. You know what Ron told me last week? He said if Harry ever gets you as a boyfriend, it’d be fucking amazing because Harry is a real mess”
“Blaise and I are fine, the honeymoon were spectacular. And, did Pansy leave because of Hermione again?” Ron cackled when Draco nodded “As usual. So…” The redhead looked at the both of them before talking again “Hannah told me what she saw when I came in”
“Yes, I’m alright” Draco smiled, he has officially been a detective’s boyfriend for five months now, the other one month was how long it took for Harry to finally made Draco agree to be his boyfriend. Harry was very protective of Draco, probably because of how they met “I know, I brought a taser with me,
“No, I believe you, I do” Harry grabbed him by his hand and pulled Draco flushed against his chest “Come on, hit me”
“What did I say, Potter?” Draco groaned after a full minute of silence. Potter was already talking again, he turned to the Gryffindor and met his green eyes. Under the moonlight, it seemed even more green, shining brightly at him, twinkling like stars “I told you not one word”
I always thought Harry would bring Draco to meet James and Lily at some point in their relationship, and I’m sure as hell it’d always be emotional.
Potter said soothingly in his ear, his arms wrapped tightly around Draco’s slim waist, he felt a shiver running up his spine just from the way Potter said his name
“Not really” She pouted, fidgeting with the bracelet on her wrist “But I am eager to talk to that one right there” She pointed at a blonde girl and Draco gaped
” before coming inside him. Theo let out a relieved laugh and released his legs from Neville’s waist, lying satisfyingly on the floor
“Your hat doesn’t fit my robes” He said as Harry grinned at him, not saying anything, completely focused on making Draco warm. Then he took Draco’s hands, making the Slytherin jumped, but didn’t recoil from the touch. He held both of Draco’s hands in his, cupping them together and leaning closer. Draco was still in a haze before he realised Potter was blowing puffs of warm air into his hands. It was hard to stay on his feet, Draco’s breath hitched at the way Potter intertwined their hands after, enveloped him in his warmth, it was as if he was trying to protect Draco from the cold “Are you warm now?”
Draco stuttered, he didn’t know where to start “Well…About three months ago, I saw the Mirror of Erised, and it brought me to another world”
“You’re weird, Harry, and stop calling me by my full name” Draco chuckled as he pulled out a small black box from under his bed and Harry quickly sat down next to him “Now, if you make fun of me, I
be true” Potter said softly next to him, Draco took a deep breath to calm himself, because he just found out his former rival has feelings for him, so much that his friends complain about it. What was Draco going to do with this information? What would he do with Potter? What would…
“She barged in, Pansy” Draco argued, moving a bit and glaring back at his best friend “What am I supposed to do?”
“The last thing she told me was that she felt uncomfortable, then she just fainted” Luna was on the ground, her hands holding Ginny’s limped hand, her lips were white, he knew she was trying to hide her stomachache earlier, the girl was just too stubborn, like the rest of her family, he should have told Hermione to check on her.
“I love you” Harry stood up, crowding Draco against the bathroom sink and locked him in his arms “I am truly, undoubtedly, extremely fucking in love with you, I don’t think I could ever love someone this much. If anyone asked me what love is when I was a teenager, I honestly wouldn’t know what to answer. But now, I’ll answer that it’s
He cried out, his cock jerking and spurting all over his stomach. He could hear Harry murmuring that he was coming too, his hot fluid flowing inside Draco. The blond was breathing heavily when Harry thrusted in “
“Are you seriously asking me that?” Granger chuckled, pushing her hair back behind her ear “A lot, I might say, he’s been in love with you for a long time, always wondering what you’re doing, always wanting to be with you, to see you. At first, I didn’t understand why he’s so swooned with you, but when I got to know Pansy, I know how he feels, and I can say that he’s in love with you very deep, Draco. Why do you suddenly want to know?”
He heard Potter call him, his first name rolling off Potter’s tongue just easy like that, Draco’s stomach felt weird “
people” Pansy flicked his forehead and Draco hissed in pain, covering the slight pain on his forehead
“Yes, mother” He said, pushing Harry away as they scrambled up to standing positions before his mother walked in. She has a few boxes in her hands that she had shrunk down “Oh, you brought boxes?”
“You’re a beauty” Harry smiled and pressed a kiss on the blond’s forehead, Draco felt a blush creeping up his cheek and buried his face in Harry’s neck. Draco’s eyes widened when he remembered where they were again, in a pub, where their friends could come back any second now.
“I was telling you about the story I went travelling around the world” He said with a bright smile, Draco gave him a polite nod and felt guilty for thinking of Harry while he was on a date with another guy “Oh, time’s up” The bell rang and the guy, whose name Draco couldn’t remember, stood up to get to the other table. The blond was now greeted by a new guy, with dirty blond hair and a green robes
“Don’t make me cry more than I already am, Harry” Draco broke into a smile, and only then Harry stopped, because he knew he has succeeded in making him feel better.
“Pansy says we need to be on the second floor at 9am sharp” Theo held up the note Pansy gave him and showed it to Draco
“I might be” Draco blushed when Harry suddenly asked “You were half naked with only the shoulder holster on you, Harry,
” Draco gaped, stepping forward and looked at the sight of the city from the balcony, the moon shining above them, the starry night, Harry knew how much Draco loved seeing the city at night “Why are we here?”
, you better be good at all of it then” Draco mumbled, leaning in at the same time as Harry and their lips met slowly. Draco closed his eyes, savouring this moment and blocking out all the noises from other students around them. He let his bag fall on the floor, locking his hands around Harry’s neck, his fingers running through the Gryffindor’s messy hair, and it felt soft in his hands. Draco hummed into the kiss, his voice eaten up by Harry’s tongue slipping in his mouth, his hands ran up along Draco’s back. When he touched the nape of his neck, the blond shivered, heat coursing through his body as he pressed harder against Harry’s body, he desired for more.
“I know” Pansy pushed him away and continued “I’m a wonderful wife, you guys shut up about it, alright?”
Calm down, Draco. Then Potter asked again that could the mirror be broken if it only showed their reflections and not their desires like always” Pansy told him as he started getting more worried every second “Granger then proceeded to say that maybe the reflections are exactly what they desire, it means that if two people look in the mirror and both of them see them together, it means—…”
“Er…dur-during our…” Draco stuttered, because he remembered it so much, it was still there clear in his mind “When I couldn’t sleep, because of the nightmares, I would snuck up to the Ravenclaw Tower, and sat there, to look at the stars” He mumbled “And one time, Harry was there when I got there, at first we just sat in different corners, then gradually, we sat next to each other and didn’t say a thing, just look at the stars”
kept bothering me today, but I guess I can’t” Draco chuckled, it was incredibly hard referring to Potter with his first name, but he couldn’t just call him Potter here anymore
He murmured without thinking, and suddenly Harry was spasming, his body shaking and he let out a low growl in Draco’s ear, the man then buried his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, and the blond felt the warm fluid flowing inside him, he smiled to himself and ruffled Harry’s hair “Such a good boy” Harry didn’t answer, but he heard a soft and quiet chuckle from him, and then a cleaning charm was casted on him. Draco stayed there, playing with Harry’s hair for a while before the Auror pulled his soft cock out of Draco and spoke
“I do” He mumbled, blushing when Harry kept licking his earlobe, sending shivers down his spine “You know I d—
“Thank you, mother” He sniffled at her words and gazed at his father “Father…are you okay with this?” He asked and his father finally looked up at him, settling his knife and fork down on their proper spot before waving his hands everywhere in the air, looking like he was throwing a tantrum already. However, there was no sound emerging from his opened mouth. Draco raised an eyebrow and though his father seemed angry, he couldn’t hear what he was saying.
” He mumbled, knowing whenever he spoke French, it would turn Harry on even more. He felt his husband’s arm around his waist and prepared himself for a ride. Draco closed his eyes and felt happiness fulfilling him up, he finally got what he wanted, and it was
“Really, I told you, you’re his exception, might sound weird to you, but it’s true” Draco said, he saw the spark Blaise and Ron have at the other world, he wanted to see the same here as well “Do you want to know more?”
“Of course” Ron handed Harry the notes and he started looking at it, only to realise he didn’t need it “Draco, I’ve proposed to you so many times, more than I could count, and I honestly can’t think of any other words than I love you, because I do, you are my home, my world, and my everything, you are the only person I want to be with every second of the day, I want to wake up with you and go to bed with you, I want to argue with you and I want to make up with you, I want us to laugh and cry together, I want us to grow old together, until we both have grey hairs and I’ll still think you’re beautiful and you’ll just think I’m teasing you, but I’m not. You’re always imperfectly perfect in my eyes, I don’t even care what others think, because I just want you, and I want to go through everything with you, for I cannot bear a second without you next to me”
” He uttered when Potter was standing behind him with a curious look. It wasn’t weird to see Potter, he has been visiting the hospital wing for more times than Draco could count “What’s wrong now?”
“Oh” Harry said quietly as the truth struck him, Draco cocked his head to the side, eyeing Harry carefully. It couldn’t be that he was…jealous?
“Fine” Draco squeezed some sunscreen from the bottle and applied it on himself, first he put it on his legs, so far it was his best features so he has to make sure his legs will be safe from the sun, he rubbed the cream from his toes up to his mid-thighs. He slid his hands under his short black swimming trunks to make sure if his trunks got ridden up, he’d still have legs with the same colour and not two different colours,
“That party is definitely going to be wild, Potter, everyone will be done with studying by then” He scoffed, two minutes left “And Pansy’s one of the people who host it, I’m sure it will be insane”
“Don’t tell me it’s Wolpert. Isn’t he straight?” Draco kept looking down, listing out more guys who have blond hair, insisting it was the one that Harry liked, meanwhile he forgot to mention his own name, there was definitely jealousy in Draco’s eyes, he knew it, it was like the time Pansy got close to Ron and Draco was jealous because he thought he’d lose his best friend, Harry could recognise it anywhere “
“Er, no” Potter answered and Draco exhaled in relief, the Gryffindor didn’t have a concussion, that was better. The blond took a deep breath before pulling out his wand to heal the injury on his head “Take off your robes” Draco said and Potter slowly opened his robes, flinching at his moves and Draco has to take over “Stop, sit still, I will do it” He ordered, pulling the robes off entirely and his scarf as well. He still has a layer of shirt left, Draco placed his hand on his forearm, Potter didn’t react, he moved his hand up to his upper arm and Potter’s face scrunched up a little, he traced up and earned a hiss from Potter when he touched his shoulder blade “I need to take off your shirt”
” Harry whispered as Jamie’s mouth opened wide, mesmerised by it and he clutched on his lollipop tightly.
“You crave it, blondie” Pansy teased him and chugged the rest of her drink left before getting off the stool “Gotta go in the lady’s room, order me another one please!” He nodded and she ran through the crowd to get to the loo. Draco asked Hannah for another Firewhisky and fiddled with the rim of his cup, he thought about love sometimes, he wanted it of course, but it was hard for a person like him to find a partner, it wasn’t just because he was a former Death Eater, it was also because his personalities were hard for people to love. He’s stubborn, opinionated, reserved and it wasn’t easy for anyone to read him, he was like a closed room with locks all over the door, and no one seemed to know the keys or find ways to get in, at least not yet. All the men that have been in his life and have gone away, none of them really left him with any important memories, he winded up forgetting all of them quickly, no one got him the way he wanted, no one really knew how to get under his skin…well, except one, one person he has been trying to avoid talking about, yet still ended up talking about him a whole lot. Draco turned to his left and saw a glimpse of Potter at a booth alone, his friends must be late again
She said, clapping her hands and everyone opened their eyes “Oh, and if you have the same names, please sit on each other’s lap”
“Oh, sorry” The girl smiled and pulled out her badge from her pocket “I’m a police officer, those two guys are too, we’re undercover. We’re investigating this creep who has been, er, I should
Pansy said, exhaling tiredly and plopped back down on the seat, melting down next to her wife with a frown “I give up”
“I’m going to die” Draco groaned as they were hiking, they have been walking for hours in the forest and it felt like forever, his legs sworn to give out on him soon. The massage was amazing, but they tried kayaking earlier, and he was already tired because of that, and now, more walking.
“Done already?” He asked and Pansy nodded, no wonder she kept wandering with them recently. She’s been with Hermione for so long, now she needed the company “You don’t have anything else to do with her?”
Draco ran to his door and put on his shoes before running downstairs, he quickly opened the back door of the book shop and locked it carefully and just started running. The street was dark and empty, there were barely anyone walking, and Draco kept sprinting, he would normally be tired of this, but not this time, he has to make it. There was no way in hell Draco’s going to let Potter give up on him. He ran and ran, until he saw the Grimmauld Place, the blond quickly stopped and walked to the doorstep. He has been to this place so much even the house knows him when he comes, it knew that he was allowed, but it wasn’t the point.
“Do what? Seduce men? Now if you’re so disgusted with me doing that, then you should have just gone home, if—…” Draco stopped when he heard a small noise from one of the stalls in the restroom “Did you hear that?”
“I’m so glad we can finally have tonight to ourselves” Harry began, raising his wine glass up in the air, Draco smiled at him fondly and raised his as well, they clinked their glasses together and Harry continued “Is your food good?”
“Just follow us” Luna said softly in his ear and he was led somewhere, he smelled perfumes and fresh flowers, but they didn’t stop walking. Not until he heard a door creaked opened and his blindfold was finally off and his hands were untied did he see everything. The huge white ballroom with a shining chandelier on the ceiling , the “
“Listen, I will do the talking, all right?” He asked before opening the door inside “You just stand there and be attractive, I guess”
“Your wish is my command” Harry chuckled and sat back up with Draco clinging onto him like a koala bear, he stood up and grabbed Draco’s arse to balance them both before walking up the stairs, he smiled into the crook of Harry’s neck all the way up to his bedroom, he was unbelievably happy, and there was nothing that could ruin his mood right now, Pansy was right, he just need to live for the moment first, fuck everything else
“I’m sorry…Anthony, I want to sit with my boyfriend” Draco stepped up to stand next to Potter, his hand finding its way to hold Potter’s, he put up a smile and glued himself to him “Maybe you could ask your friends, they’re also brilliant” He said, walking away with Potter following him, he was grinning like a happy crup behind him now, Potter was so easy to figure out
again” Harry laughed, his best mate was wearing a formal red robes, it seemed like he was going to one of those fancy parties he always went with Blaise again “What’s the occasion?”
“The past three months was the worst time that I had to go through. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep, I think about you all the time” He said, his hands trembling just as Draco’s cheeks started to heat up “When I got here, seeing you with all those people, I was…I thought you had moved on, and maybe you have, but I decided to say this anyway”
disobey her. Ron pressed his lips together and switched places with Harry, sitting down next to Blaise. If Draco moved when Harry sat down, Blaise didn’t move an inch, and now their shoulders touched, Ron had to stop himself from blushing
“Just…you just clenched and moved” Harry grumbled, closing his eyes in distress. Draco widened his eyes and realized he has been clenching on his husband’s hard cock the whole time
“Wreck me, Potter, as hard as you can” he said daringly and heard a small chuckle behind him before his trousers was opened under Harry’s hand, the Auror pushed it down Draco’s thighs, the blond supported himself by resting his elbow on the table, lifting himself a bit to feel Harry’s cock at his bare arse
” Harry said. What did he want to say now? He seemed to forget all words that came to mind when he stared at Draco’s face, Draco’s eyes. All he wanted to do was to confess, everything, everything he wanted to say, he just wanted to tell Draco right now
“You like that?” Theo smiled, kissing Neville, slipping his tongue inside the blond’s mouth, he put both of Neville’s hands on his bare arse and got back to stroking Neville eagerly “
“And, er, we also heard Draco dumped Brandon” It was now Neville speaking “Last week, Draco was more mad than sad”
Draco stared at the guy, he challenged Draco, and though he was always a cautious guy, he could not back out of this one. Draco dragged Potter up by his arm and pulled at his shirt, standing on his heels with their faces close to each other
“Oh, come on, you cannot tell me all the things you and Harry did after the war were nothing! I mean, sure, you guys are not even friends yet, but it’s because it’s always so awkward between you two because
“We are doing an Auror calendar! Twelve months, twelve hot Aurors” Pansy stepped in to tell them “You guys are the models, that’s the team I’ve hired to help” She pointed her finger at Theo and began “That’s Theodore, he’ll be in charge of your outfits. Then there’s Draco, he’ll be doing your face and hair, putting oil on your bodies. And Blaise, he’s the brilliant photographer, you’ll have to listen to him during the photoshoot”
“Bring him back to the precinct” Draco watched as the police officer that saved him tapped on the police car with the creep inside and the car drove away. He was surprised to see it, he never really witnessed anything like this before, he was almost a victim to a horrible crime.
someone else also wants to ask you out” Ron said slowly, carefully looking at Harry and tilting his head “Maybe that
a lot the previous night, Harry and Draco have woke up to find their friends sitting casually in the living room, Pansy was the one to break the silence first
you have to stay tonight” She nagged, swinging his arm and sticking her face up to his ear “We all promise to go back home at the same time, you can’t leave, Theo will leave for France soon and Blaise is going to be busy studying about photography”
“What do you do if they don’t love you back then?” His voice broke, tears rolling from his eyes as he couldn’t take it anymore, he hugged her back tightly and just straight up crying on her shoulder “What if you know you can never have them but a part of you still want them? What if-…”
was going to stop you” Pansy finally spoke and folded her arms together with a party hat on her head “But I wanted to see how long it will take for you guys to realise that we’re here. Honestly, in my humble opinion, I wanted to see more, I even expected you guys to go straight up to the bedroom without noticing us”
“Ask Luna to make that shirt” Ron mumbled, his fingers fidgeting with the collar of Blaise’s white shirt “And cook for me every day”
“I can’t force you to do anything, it’s bad enough I’m helping you in secret when I should have told my girlfriend, who’s actually
“I love you, Draco” Harry said, his green eyes staring into Draco’s deepest place in his heart, it felt like the first time he said those words to Draco again, the same feelings, the only thing different now was that it hurts “I still do, I don’t want to lose you, I never wanted to lose you. I don’t even know what I’m trying to say” He stuttered, scratching the nape of his neck as a sign of him being extremely anxious “I know why we broke up, but, I think, I can wait” He looked at Draco with a puppy-like look, like he was begging for forgiveness even when he did nothing wrong “I can wait for you to be ready, I don’t care how long it takes. I just want to be with you, Draco, you’re all that matters to me”
“You’re jealous with yourself?” Draco felt funny at what Harry said “You’re not even in love with me”
“Here, you have to chop it” He did it as an example and placed his hand on Goldstein’s, helping him prepare the ingredients “See? Steady hands, alright?”
Seamus yelled out loudly, he was one of the first few people to come, along with Dean. There was even Ginny and Luna behind them, Draco sipped on his blue drink and observed them carefully. The party wasn’t too wild, just a few spots with games, some light drinks and Sobering Potions ready to make sure the Professors or Filch won’t catch them later.
“It’s like our first date” Harry said, hugging Draco from behind as the blond leaned on the balcony “Remember?”
“You’re more adorable” Harry teased him, pinching his cheek and leaning close to kiss his wet lips “Do you want to put it on?”
” He said, releasing his hands from Potter’s grip and cupped his face, he slipped his hands up and grasped his hair, pulling it a bit
He ogled at the redhead from the moment he changed into his outfit, which was only trousers and suspenders, and yes, he was half naked again, no shirt, just suspenders. Theo really got this whole hot-Aurors-calendar thing set up in his mind the second Pansy explained it.
him?” He turned his phone back at his face and asked the girls “How could you not tell me…” He whispered quietly so that Harry couldn’t hear “
“You just need to say it harder” Draco smirked, sitting down on the spot next to him “I thought you are used to it. Being famous and all, people must be all over you all the time, you should know how to say no”
“No, it’s fine, honey” Pansy tapped her hand on Hermione’s legs as a way of assuring her wife and shook her head “I have to do this myself”
“Please stop doing that, you look like you’re about to have a stroke” He said, making the guy frown, only four minutes to go. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and watched the guy embarrassed himself thinking he was successful in wooing Draco. This guy was a menace, he looked at Pansy for help but she could only give him a grin and a shrug. He should never trust Pansy every again.
“Are there any questions you guys wanna ask? Now that we’ve picked everything out” Hermione clasped her hands together and beamed at them when no one said anything “Nothing? Alright, you Aurors, get ready for makeup and hair and change your clothes, Blaise will be ready”
“Who? Blaise’s sitting on the couch, staring intently at Weasley as if no one sees. Theodore is grinding up against some people, and you are bickering with Granger over who has to clean the party”
“Oh” The man finally replied and looked at Draco “I’m sorry, I didn’t know, I didn’t see your ring…before” Draco stared at the guy confusedly before looking down on his hand, there was actually a ring on his ring finger now, the blond cocked his head a bit to the side and looked back at the two men in front of him
” He pleaded and Harry finally pulled out, the blond sat up as Harry placed his cock at his entrance. Draco lowered himself down and whimpered. At first, getting used to Harry’s size took some time, but now, his arse felt empty without Harry.
Move over, you always sit on Harry’s lap, why the sudden change? Are you mad at him or something?” Weasley laughed loudly and leaned back on the couch as Draco fidgeted with his robes. How could he possibly sit on Potter’s lap?
he told himself, and when Harry touched his leaking cock, Draco bent his back and came all over himself, he ended it with a loud moan, the blond heaved heavily and lied back down
“My Draco hates peas too” Harry was smirking at him now “And you love sweets but you despise white chocolate”
still rough like always?” Draco gasped when Harry ripped the fishnet tights apart. Harry stared at the lace underwear and tried to find ways to breathe properly “If you’re wondering, it’s a black lace thong, except the skirt from Pansy, everything else is mine” Harry exhaled deeply and hooked his finger under the thong, this barely covered anything, Draco’s cock was even threatening to break free from it. Harry pulled Draco down and pushed the string of the thong to the side before squeezing his arse apart, he murmured a few spells and started licking at Draco’s rim
” Draco raised his arm high and greeted the guy loudly, startling the man, he walked quickly to meet the guy halfway, his heart racing. When he approached the man, he was surprised by how handsome this one looked, his face showed he was kind, Draco could tell, he was good at looking at faces.
think it’s good, I might buy a few to give Ron” Potter smiled “Almost bought a beachcomber straw hat too”
“I know” Neville replied “I know, I’m an idiot, I never let my feelings out because I fear I’d show it too much, you were always with…attractive guys, and rich, and good in bed, and I-I didn’t know if I could compete with them. I was just…I was too worried about the differences between us that I forgot how much I love you, and I neglected your feelings, I’m an idiot, I wish I was braver, I wish I wasn’t so indecisive, I wish I could be better for you”
“Well, Rose” Brandon said, leaning close, showing a friendly smile to the kid “Guess I’m Draco’s boyfriend now”
a tease, do you know that?” Harry chuckled behind him and stepped forward, he could feel Harry’s hard cock pressing between his arse
“Er” Draco furrowed his eyebrow but stretched his legs and rested them on Potter’s lap anyway “What are you do-
“Hey, busy day?” Pansy asked once Draco arrived at their booth, Harry looked up at the blond and soon realised he was smiling at him, who was still in his Healer robes
“Corporate with me, alright? I don’t wanna embarrass myself in front of him” He whispered to the dragon and she just let out a small blue fire from her mouth, he will take that as a ‘yes’ then.
“You fractured your shoulder blade” Draco stood up and gazed at Potter, this time he has to, he couldn’t tell a patient bad news without looking into their eyes. The blond swallowed and looked down, murmuring the words out loud “I’m sorry too” He said, and he meant it, for all the things he had done. There was no better time than this, especially when Potter had just apologised to him too. When he looked back, Potter still has his eyes on him “What did you do?”
“Potter, I—…” He stuttered and took another breath, he pulled out the black chocolate box with a red ribbon on from his bag and pushed it into Potter’s hands, he looked down on the ground and started confessing “Here’s the thing, I like you, I
“Doesn’t this feel good?” Pansy hummed softly when they were lying lazily on those lounge chairs near the resort’s pool. It was sunny and no matter how much Pansy and Hermione nagged him to get tanned like them, he wouldn’t dare, his skin was too sensitive for this, and that led to him lying under a poolside umbrella to protect himself
“Well, next time, don’t talk about other topics while I’m talking” He looked away and out the files in his briefcase “I really hate it”
“Yeah, Hermione told me Harry found you in the Room of Requirement, seemed like you fainted there” Pansy said, finishing everything and finally looked at him “Are you alright?”
“Oh, honey, you’re too heavy for him now” Ginny carried the five years old boy up in her arms and pinched Draco’s cheek “Look at this, you used to have cheeks”
Hermione glared at her and pushed Pansy back up, both of them sitting up on the bed and she watched as Hermione fixed her dress again “What do we do?” Pansy groaned loudly when she realised what Hermione was asking her about, she rubbed her face into the crook of Hermione’s neck while they sat there, her arms slinging around her wife’s waist and she felt like a baby “It’s fifteen minutes until midnight and we gotta find a way for them to talk to each other. You said you want them to be together”
after this he would have to face Neville, it wasn’t as exciting as he expected, he was hyped to meet Neville on the first day of photoshoot. But now? Not so much, not anymore. It was already a miracle he could get out of bed today “Just a stupid accident”
I’m serious” Draco stood up and rested his hand on Potter’s chest, pushing him back on the booth, he swung his leg over Potter’s leg and settled down on his lap, he put both of his hands on the Auror’s firm chest and leaned closer “Kiss me like you actually like me”
“Yeah, she barged in an Auror meeting to announce that” Ron added, which only made Draco more horrified.
“You think I’m going to believe that Harry Potter is dating you, Malfoy?” The guy smirked, Draco could already sense what he was going to say next as he balled his hands into fists “A
“I couldn’t help but overheard your conversation” Pansy said and smiled at Harry mischievously “Hi, I’m Pansy” She bent down and whispered into his ear
“Well…” Draco took a deep breath before answering, it took him a lot to agree and go to this event, he hasn’t been out socialising at big events for a while now “Yeah, I’m free tomorrow, I’m only going because my friends will be there too”
Draco’s moans were muffled as Harry slipped his fingers in his mouth, he swirled his tongue around, sucking on Harry hard.
“You’re friends with Granger?” He asked but Pansy only chuckled at him again, running her hands through her hair
“Visiting Draco, why are you yelling, darling?” He could hear Narcissa’s voice and he quickly chugged off his wine glass before getting off the seat
“Nothing” Draco replied, he heard something, but ignored it anyway “Potter, just...if you have any problems, I could just bring McLaggen home, then you won’t have to see me grinding on him anymor—…”
“Nothing happened, Pansy, I can tell you that” Draco glanced at Potter and looked back at Pansy “He still doesn’t remember what happened that night”
!” Draco heard Ron’s voice and suddenly Harry was pushed in the room by the redhead “Hi” Ron smiled cheekily and when his eyes caught Blaise’s, his cheeks turned redder than his hair and Ron turned away, Draco smirked once again,
“He sucks at it, I can see it on his face” Draco looked at Ron, giving him a slight smile “If you want, I can play with you, you’ll have a real opponent then”
“I will” Harry said, tightening his grip on Draco’s hand as a way to reassure him, and somehow, by some miracle perhaps, he did feel less anxious.
“Okay, fine” Harry groaned, feeling the wind blowing by when they finally got outside of the Ministry, he closed his eyes as he remembered that day “It was one time, twelve years ago, I bumped into Draco in a pub, we talked, we laughed, and we kinda had sex”
, I love you too” Draco said, turning his head to the side, meeting Harry’s lips midway, his body was sweating, the pub was hot, and he was still wearing his long jacket and that only made it hotter for him, then sex with Harry just added the fuel to the fire inside him, in a good way “I have never felt so good, Harry, you are so good to me”
“Hey, er, how much do you think P—Harry loves me?” He asked in the library, lowering his voice so Potter couldn’t hear him. Granger was next to him, he figured it’d be easy just to ask her how her best friend felt about him
“Hey, where are you, darling?” He brought his dead phone up to his ear shakily and pretended to talk to someone loudly, hoping it would scare away the creep “Yeah? You’re on the way? How soon?” He said to no one at all “You’re close by? Okay, see you halfway” He put the phone down, but he could still feel the creep’s footsteps following him, the streetlight helped him see the shadow of the man behind him when he looked to the side a little. Draco took a shaky breath, he looked at the starry sky and hoped for the best, he hoped someone would come and save him right now.
“No, not her” He shook his head, overhearing Ron’s mumbles about how he was tired of studying and smiling unconsciously “Are you interested in tutoring Ron Weasley?”
“Until you realise you’re wrong and apologise, don’t speak to us” Draco said, grabbing Brandon’s hand and jacket “I’m disappointed in you, Harry. I can’t believe you’d damage our friendship like this” He said, pulling Brandon out of the restaurant. Harry groaned and buried his face in his hands, sitting down on the chair again, murmuring incoherently, he messed it all up.
“Don’t blame yourself” Harry said, still looking down at Draco, making the blond blushed. Luckily it was dark, the officer wouldn’t be able to see it “Do you want a ride home?”
“Oh, alright” Theodore said, shrugging and picking up another Witch Weekly, Theodore might seem like he has no manners at all but since he was a Pureblood, manners was the thing he cared most “Is he cute? I didn’t remember anything, I only know that he’s warm, I still get that fuzzy feeling when I woke up”
“I was…packing” He said, as Potter’s eyes shining with shock and joy when he heard Draco “We have to visit your dad tomorrow, right?”
“Are you interested in…” Draco leaned up and whispered in Harry’s ear seductively, his voice soothing but it didn’t distract Harry from the fact that Draco’s hand was clutching on his towel strongly “Having a real life experience?”
“It’s alright” Potter gripped on the man’s arm tightly and chuckled “People ask him out a lot when I’m not around. It’s our fifth-year anniversary, I just went to grab the sunscreen for him, can’t let this gem get ruined by the sun, right? He’s beautiful, isn’t he?”
“I know, but you said the first time you saw the mirror, you see us holding hands and kissing right?”
at your birthday party, but well, make sure you look exactly the same as before. For example, Draco, did you fall on Harry’s lips or you just got bitten by a huge mosquito?” She pointed not so subtly and Draco quickly covered his neck, he didn’t even know Harry made marks on him that fast. He grinned guiltily as the girls continued talking about something else that he couldn’t focus on. This day was better than he ever expected, he’d never think that the day he was sure was the worst day of his life turned out to be the best day of his life, that he’d lost and find love again in one day, that he’d be able to find his true love back then. Looking up at Harry again, Draco thought the last fifteen years with him was the best years he has ever experienced, and he couldn’t wait to spend next fifteen years,
“You really think I don’t have anything for you?” Hermione chuckled and put the bracelet on Pansy’s wrist “Each symbol on it represent each meaningful event of our relationship, look, an ink bottle, because when you apologised to me after the war, I was so shocked I knocked down my ink bottle and spilled it all over the parchment, a wine glass, because you drank a lot of wine when you confessed to me, a bowl of soup, because you dipped your hand in it by accident on our first date”
, the party that you two kissed” Ron chimed in, pointing at the spot on the ground, with the same hat Luna used that day for the game “Well, you didn’t actually kiss, but you know what we mean”
“You know, those hot firefighters’ calendar where they’re all half naked?” Pansy squealed, clasping her hands together “We’re going to make it like that, but well, with Aurors” Draco’s lips formed into a smirk, he
“Okay” Harry said, walking away to Ron’s spot. Draco let out a silent breath and made his way to where Theodore was standing, he needed a distraction.
“Uncle Draco likes you” Rose argued, which Harry chuckled at, there was no way Draco would ever think of Harry as more than a friend, or else Harry would have known “I’m going to fix it”
Draco felt his eyes heavy but he still couldn’t open it, the only thing he knew that he was lying on a bed, with a blanket covering him, an odd scent filling up the room, it was a nice scent. The bed dipped and Draco felt someone lying next to him, their arm draped over his stomach and someone was burying their face in the crook of Draco’s neck, tickling him with their hair.
“Pansy, why did you light up candles? Did Rose break the light—…” Harry looked up at the entrance and saw Draco there, in a black sweatshirt and a pair of black trousers “What is going on?”
He mumbled as Harry pushed the third digit in, curling it up and earning a loud moan from him. Harry has been fucking him long enough to know where his sweet spot was and he kept pushing at it. When he leaned down and licked around the rim while his fingers were inside, his other hand stroking Draco’s cock, the blond grabbed Harry’s wrist immediately, it would be too much for him to handle “
“Look, Hermione, we’re not the only happy married couple here” Pansy put up a smug as they approached Draco and Potter’s table
The shower ended way quicker than he realised, Harry wrapped the towel around his waist and walked back downstairs, he still needed to eat something at least. He saw Draco from behind when he reached the kitchen, the blond was sitting on the couch, looking at something Harry didn’t notice, the television wasn’t even on. Harry furrowed his eyebrows and decided not to open the fridge but instead approaching Draco to see what he was doing.
The truth was, he couldn’t say he was sorry because he didn’t know where to start, there were too many things he could say sorry to Harry, but it was hard, too hard for him to do, he wasn’t sure how to do it properly. And he couldn’t face it if Potter rejected his apology. Draco groaned when he got back to his dorm, he shouldn’t have played the scars card like that, he should have told him the truth.
neck and kneeled down on his knees, stroking him quicker, and then Blaise was jerking, Ron closed his eyes and felt Blaise’s hot fluid shooting at his face, some got in his opened mouth, and he opened his eyes once Blaise was done. Ron licked his lips, feeling the salty taste and Blaise pulled him up for a kiss
“Absolutely” Pansy said “Yesterday, I asked the staff the decorate the room with roses and everything, when we came home after the opera, Hermione and I had the best bath ever, and yes, we had sex in it”
“Is everyone done with their potions?” Professor Slughorn asked as some of the students exclaimed that they weren’t done. It was three minutes until the final exam was over.
“No, what is it?” Theo asked and Draco stood in the corner of the room, he knew Pansy’s intention already, he just didn’t want to spoil it
“Be pretty” Pansy curled her red lips into a smirk “They’ll be so head over heels for you that they will buy it”
“For knowing a lot? Then why are you friends with Blaise and I? We can be know-it-all too” He pointed out, which made Pansy realised it as well. He smiled, he was getting into the right way now “Right? So go easy on her and the Gryffindor”
“I want to see you” Neville mumbled and Theo chuckled before turning around again, his lips met Neville halfway, and when he was pushed back on the floor, Theo opened his eyes in confusion
going to see that bastard again, and stop blowing it in my face, you smoke like a chimney” He frowned
“Okay, fine, you and your eyes” Draco sighed, retreating his hand so he could open the gate. Once there was nothing between them, Harry took his hand again, intertwining it and pressing his lips against Draco’s knuckles “Harry”
“I don’t” She said quickly, which was the exact reply he had expected from Ginny. She was a tough one to crack, the Weasleys have always been hard to impress.
“Oh” Potter said and looked down “Here” He put the shrimp he just peeled into Draco’s bowl and grabbed another from the plate
“No, it’s alright” He thanked Potter, pushing his hair behind his ear and looked up at the Auror. Another thing he hated about Potter was that he grew five inches more or so over the years and now he was taller than Draco “Thanks for holding me back, I don’t know what I’d have done to that guy”
“Well, are we ever sure about anything?” Draco said, applying some blush on Ron’s cheeks, making it a bit rosy “Look, do you get jealous when he’s with a guy?”
“So I won” Draco spoke once he pulled away, he crawled back up to face Harry and licked his lower lip in a seductive way “What do I get?”
The blue light emerged from his wand and hit the mirror, but it didn’t explode. Instead, there was just a little crack there in the middle of the mirror, this was supposed to shatter in pieces right now. Was this mirror enchanted? He stepped closer when himself and Potter in the mirror stopped kissing each other. His own reflection also stepped closer to the mirror just like him, as they both raised their hands to touched the mirror, Draco hissed in pain
“I know, I just want to lighten the mood” His best friend shrugged, nudging him with his elbow, he understood Harry, he knew Harry still wanted to propose, he just didn’t want to push “You know what I think when Blaise proposed to me?”
“That is so not insulting at all, Potter” He rolled his eyes, it was weird to be carried like this, he could feel Potter’s sweat dropping on his arms, and the git claimed he wasn’t tired. But Draco tried not to think of it much, soon they have reached to the girls’ spot, he didn’t know Potter was that fast, or the girls slowed down for Draco to catch up
“See, I know you’ll look good in it” Theo smiled and handed Colin the shirt “What do you have to pose with?”
Ron breathed out when Blaise teared his shirt opened after pulling Ron’s robes off, the buttons on his shirt flew everywhere, he latched on Ron’s chest, his hands caressing the redhead’s waist “
Harry? What the fuck?” Draco shouted at Harry, and Ron was in the stall, trying to stop himself from letting out any noise while Blaise fucking him again, slowly this time, every thrust was another hit at his prostate
“A baby sheep” He said and Draco froze, he has to stop himself from laughing. Pansy was really crazy with this. He squeezed some moisturiser into his hand and started applying it on Boot’s face
“Hey, having a wife who’s the Minister for Magic is just useful” Pansy winked at him again and sighed “I just really hope they get together this time. After all, they’re both forty now, better late than never” Ron smiled and nodded softly. Harry was his best mate, Draco was his friend too, for once, he supported Pansy’s crazy plan
“Yeah, I was surprised how fast Harry could take Draco’s robes off without getting mad and just rip it all off” Ginny said, clapping her hands together “Ten points to Harry”
“It’s better if you join” Hermione elbowed Pansy and gave her a secret look “Harry obviously wants to do it, and without you, he’d be alone”
“His cigarettes” Draco said, picking up the boxes from the table, the jerk always had a thing for cigarettes, which Draco hated, he threw it in under the girls’ chants and smiled a bit, the bastard deserved it “His car keys”
“Robards found out the location of this group of dark wizards and we need to bust them right there and then” Harry explained, his hand rubbing a small spot on his left arm
“Ginny and Luna are bringing their kids to mum, so they’re probably stuck there for a while, since mum always do that” He said, she’d always keep them for an hour or two to give them something to talk. He couldn’t blame her, all her kids have grown up and sometimes she wanted to talk to them “Blaise is on a business trip and he’s supposed to be here an hour ago. I’m so going to kill him” He huffed loudly and folded his arms together, he hated when Blaise didn’t show up on time. On their first date, Blaise arrived thirty minutes late and he received a one hell of a nasty fuss coming from Ron for not respecting him. Ron was in a bad mood that day, he couldn’t help it, but after they got married, Blaise revealed that it was
” Neville said, holding himself up by his elbow to look at Theo. With his hand stroking the base, his mouth was fully engulfed in the now hard length, he bobbed his head, sucking Neville off in earnest. Theo murmured a spell quietly and his other hand slipped into his rim, he didn’t expect Neville to know how to prepare for him, so he’d have to finger himself. How he managed to suck someone and finger himself, he never knew he could. Theo sucked hard on the head of Neville’s cock, moaning when he put the third finger in, thrusting himself back on his own fingers, he didn’t even notice that Neville was touching his face
“Wow” Pansy hummed, looking at Granger, who was now joining Potter and Weasley, smacking them both on their arms and scolding them “I guess that’s understandable, they are friends for a long time”
“Oh, that’s not it” Draco shook his head and sighed out loud “Look, I’m sorry I wasn’t being clear before. Ernie has a crush on Terrence Higgs. Since Terrence is a Slytherin, Ernie asked me for
Then I confessed that I like you during Quidditch last year, remember? We’ve been boyfriends since then”
“Please me, Harry” He could hear Draco teasing him, wiggling his arse until the Auror grabbed hold of his two round globes “
“You are” He flinched and turned around to see Ginny with a smirk on her face, her arms folding in front of her chest as she stood next to Luna “Hey, blondie”
“Hey” Blaise approached them with Rose on his arms while she finished her dessert, Harry quickly put the ring box back in his pocket so they wouldn’t see “Ready to open?”
. Luna had also been a good conversation partner, although she talked about weird stuff a lot, but Draco still enjoyed it. He also talked to Weasley, who forced Draco to call him Ron, who also blabbered about everything and eventually passed out on the couch until Blaise picked him up. He talked to Hermione and Pansy for a while, they talked about politics a lot, and Pansy got bored and dragged her wife away, then Theo. However, he never once talked to Potter, the one that invited Draco to this party, which was weird, it seemed like the Auror was avoiding him because every time he looked at him, Potter looked the other way, it was infuriating.
Totally unrelated but in chapter 7 of Haven’s Taste, you can also notice a small detail where Hermione saw Harry and Draco holding hands in the pub even when they were talking to their friends on different topics.
I won’t” The blond grunted, this guy has no sign of giving up and Draco has no idea what to do “Why are you so-…”
“I want to kiss you badly right now” Harry said, earning a chuckle from Draco, the blond leaned closer and pressed his lips on Harry’s. That kiss during the game was already way too much for him to handle, but now, it was even more than that.
“Are you kidding? He bloody loves you” Weasley said, fiddling with his quill “Like a lot, you two are each other’s first love, and you’re special to him”
” Harry mumbled and pulled Draco back against his chest, his hands playing with Draco’s hard buds again. Draco didn’t have to move anymore, now it was all Harry’s work and all the blond has to do was kneeling there and take everything “I love you”
” He mumbled when Harry took his glasses off and put them on the sink nearby “Your eyes” He said, mesmerised by Harry’s eyes up close, the first time he got to see these green eyes so close was probably the time back in the war, when he was asked to identify Harry. Who could possibly not know that it was Harry? Even if he was turned into another person, Draco could sense it a mile away. He cupped Harry’s face and stared into those eyes, the way his pupils dilated when Draco smiled, he realised how much Harry liked him.
Draco gasped when his best friend turned around and splash water at his face, the girls laughed louder and even Hermione joined to splash more water on both of them, Draco covered his face with his hands until he felt someone covering for him, he opened his eyes and looked up to see Potter smiling at him
“It takes everything in me to try and hold back from fucking you right now” Harry said, one of his hand moved up to grab Draco by his chin, turning him to face Harry
“Oh, yeah” Draco replied “The salmon is exceptional” Harry’s legs began to shake, he felt so nervous still.
in the mirror. What the hell was this mirror? What was going on? Draco pulled out his wand when images of him and Potter started looking at each other, his hand shaking when their lips touched
“Smile for the camera, Draco” The blond turned around to see Blaise with a camera, standing next to Weasley “
Harry flinched when the bag on his head was pulled off, revealing a smiling Pansy in front of him, she was wearing a black glittery jumpsuit with an a cocktail in her hand “So you guys used plan B?”
“It’s alright, they can watch us from afar, there’s a restaurant near the beach too” Pansy reassured her wife “Then they can join us after?”
Theo couldn’t care less, he swallowed Neville’s length and kept going, his hips moving on its own, pushing back against Neville’s tongue inside him, it felt
“Yeah, that’s true” Harry said, and then it got awkward, it was complete silence again, it was like Harry didn’t even try to make a conversation at all, Draco rolled his eyes and turned away.
“Harry, I can’t, I have all these books to organise, we almost finished it yesterday but…” She said, looking at Pansy with a glare “
“Are you…disagreeing with me?” Pansy said, her eyes widened, Draco has to admit it, Pansy could be scary when she wanted to
“Hey, what are you talking about?” Hermione leaned over with a puzzled look “I thought you are watching the opera”
helping” Draco saw Hermione nudging her wife through the screen with a sigh “It’s alright, he’s not worth your tears”
“Yeah” Shortly after his answer, Draco found himself being wrapped by Potter’s strong arms again. His face rubbing against Draco’s back, the blond sighed, placing his hand on top of Potter’s “I’m sorry for snapping at you, I was…you know, I’m not the Draco you know”
“I casted a Silencio on him” His mother said, picking up her teacup calmly as if it was something so casual “We saw you two in the garden, and we had a quick discussion before you came in” She gestured to the broken vase at the corner of the room that he only noticed now.
“This one is out” Blaise spoke, putting his cigarette in the ashtray on the table and picked a sleeping Ron up in his arms “We’re heading home first”
“Hey, er…” Ginny started, looking at him strangely “I got the broom, I like it a lot, so, thank you, for doing that”
He said as Harry smiled, it actually happened once or twice, they had actually did it way too much that Draco fainted halfway and Harry had to stop, since then Harry never let that story go
“Are you, er, are you going to the party next week?” Harry suddenly wondered, turning to him as Draco stared at him “The one Hermione, Parkinson and other Prefects are hosting?”
“That’s a bit dramatic, don’t you think?” Ron laughed softly, unwrapping the sweets Blaise had prepared in his bags daily, since they were husbands and Blaise knew Ron liked to eat sweets every single second of the day “Want some?” Harry shook his head and remembered all the time Draco ate the chocolates his mother had sent him in their living room, the blond would have that smile on his face and he would hum whenever he tasted something good “So you confessed to him, doesn’t mean you two would stop being friends. Maybe it’s worth the shot, maybe Draco likes you back”
Harry feels like collapsing. Draco’s is waiting for a reaction with darkening eyes. Darkening for him.
“Well... at first I thought it would be the only thing I could be halfway decent at. And it turned out that when I actually went to study it at the academy, it started being intriguing to me not just as a science but also as an art. I didn’t know there were so many…. possibilities out there. I realised I never thought about how much goes into it, or how many areas you can use them for-- anything from gardening to medicine.”
They were now a few shots more drunk. Harry honestly can’t remember how many. They’ve been talking for hours.
Draco straightens up slightly. “Quite well, actually. You remember I told you about that anti-anxiety potion I was working on?” he inquires. At Andromeda’s nod, he continues: “Well, I managed to isolate a chemical I wanted from a muggle SSRI, an antidepressant.”
, Harry thinks. He can’t help but be charmed by the way Draco’s eyebrows raise when he explains something he cares about, his careful optimism, his determination to improve his potions. It makes his heart grow a little bit bigger in his chest. It hurts, just a little.
Draco and Andromeda give him understanding smiles and Harry can suddenly see the striking familial resemblance in their faces.
A few months ago Andromeda had insisted that they start calling each other by their first names. She had said they sounded like schoolboys and Harry secretly agreed. Recently, Harry began feeling things...
“Yes, the muggle drug was quite helpful. The anxiety potions currently being given in magical hospitals do not do a good job because they sedate more than anything else.” Draco looks over at him again with a searching gaze, probably knowing Harry would understand. “They’re not very useful in small doses, and even then, it has a sedation effect that is undesirable for long-term treatment, to put it lightly.”
Draco finally looks around him and eyes Harry, cheeks flushing. Harry quickly regains his composure and walks up to the table to put a hand on Teddy’s shoulder.
Harry freezes, instantly embarrassed. As much as he hated dealing with money, he feels even worse at the prospect of owing people money. But Draco smiles widely at him and Harry knows he isn’t angry. A flash of playful challenge flashes in Draco’s eyes. Oh no.
Draco, of course, arrives a few minutes late looking absolutely gorgeous. He is wearing black tight-fitting jeans and a simple white t-shirt underneath a lightweight black jacket which he rolled up to his elbows, showing off his strong pale arms. He wears a long silver necklace that Harry had never seen before.
” Draco exclaims, his brow furrowed. He was now leaning closer towards Harry and putting a hand on his arm across the small bar table between them. Oh god. He was so close. Harry wanted to speak quietly so that Draco might have to do that again.
,” Draco almost whispers, and Harry thinks he would not have been able to hear it at all if he hadn’t been staring at Draco’s mouth.
“What is it? Did I do something wrong?” Draco steps back and removes his arms from Harry's waist, looking concerned.
“That… makes sense.” Harry hurts for him, and feels helplessly speechless. He really hasn’t given the sorting process more than a passing thought. He opts for honesty. “It’s…I’m really sorry. I don’t know what else to say.”
He feels Draco’s tongue wanting to enter his slightly parted lips, and he grants Draco entrance with enthusiasm. Draco moans softly, and the sound, however welcome, brings Harry painfully to his senses. He puts his hands on Draco’s cheeks, pushing him away gently.
“But it seems like you’ve really come into your own, Malfoy.” Harry smiles in a way he hopes is soft. “I hope you don’t get flashbacks anymore– I know what those are like. Absolute fucking hell.”
Teddy puts a hand over his mouth to unsuccessfully stifle laughter, looking up at Draco. Harry blushes spectacularly; he’s sure he is.
Fortescue’s was finally within view. Harry watches Teddy. He loves seeing his eyes light up at the sight of his favourite ice cream place. Harry is not disappointed- Teddy starts jittering excitedly and lets go of Harry’s hand to run into the store. His godson’s excitement about sugary treats has never failed to amuse Harry.
“No,” Harry replies quietly, opting to maintain eye contact despite how uncomfortable he now was. “But you’re making me feel as if I ought to have.”
“No,” Draco declares, taking a few steps in Harry's direction. Harry steps back instinctively and realises his back is already against the bar’s brick wall. His head darts to the side instinctively, and when he turns his head back, Draco’s face is even closer.
“Yes, exactly.” He looks over at Harry, his brow furrowed. “Now I have to figure out how to incorporate it into my potion. The aim is to make a potion that can eliminate the overwhelming fear without making the patient sleepy and unfocused as it does with muggle drugs or sedated like the potions we use now. So it’s a bit of…” Draco looks over at Andromeda for a moment before returning his glance to Harry. “…taking the best elements of both worlds and making something new with more benefits and little to no drawbacks.”
Harry told Andromeda he’d take Teddy back-to-school shopping in Hogsmeade today, and Draco came along at Teddy’s insistence. He gives his opinion on the different quills and schoolbags when Teddy asks (which is often), and Teddy’s overflowing warmth and excitement towards Draco makes Harry and Draco feel more comfortable around each other too. He couldn’t help but be surprised at Draco’s patience with Teddy. It charmed him, as pathetic as that might sound. He is more than happy to be an observer on this shopping trip, seeing as Teddy was clearly excited to have Draco around. And anyways, Harry wasn’t able to concentrate very well. He was mostly too busy staring.
“Thanks, I’ll be back! I’m sorry!” He calls as he hurries out the door, wanting to get outside so he doesn’t leave Teddy outside by himself for too long. After his day out with Teddy, he’ll come back here and pay. And make sure this never happens again.
Suddenly, Draco pulls on his hair accidentally as his fingers graze his scalp, and he softly mumbles “Sorry, Potter” against Harry’s lips before continuing the kiss with a growing hunger. For the life of him, Harry can’t understand why that makes him want Draco even more than he thought was humanly possible.
“Yeah,” Harry exclaimed. “A while back I had to administer this potion to a child who was having tantrums so strong that she was a danger to her family. Things were thrown around the room and such. But giving her that potion was the most horrible part of it all. It was like taking her fear away, but also her ability to talk to us properly. So it was nearly impossible to get to the root of her problem. Anyway, it was
Draco’s eyes flicker down to Harry's lips and it’s clear to Harry that Draco knew he was watching his in turn.
“Yes, Teddy?” Andromeda says evenly. She’s used to Teddy’s dramatics. Harry catches Draco’s startled expression at the commotion as it changes into an amused and fond look he gives the panting little boy. Harry couldn’t determine which of them was cuter.
Draco clears his throat theatrically from  the opposite side of the room and Harry glances back at him, amused.
“Huh.” Harry contemplates this and realizes, as he does often these days, that he never really thought about it that way.
Harry sees Andromeda looking between the two of them with an amused expression. She can probably see Harry’s feelings all over his face. He just hopes Draco doesn’t.
“Does there ever come a point in... which you aren’t so fucking….elegant?” He puts his face in his hands.
When the three of them had reached an agreement that they purchased everything Teddy needed, they floo’d back to Andromeda’s from the Leaky Cauldron. Draco came along, no questions asked.
It’s well after two in the morning when they attempt to shuffle their way out of the bar. Draco walks into someone’s chair on their way out and has to lean on Harry for balance. Being quite tipsy himself, Harry struggled to hold onto him and shot an arm out to Draco’s waist to keep him upright, feeling a strip of bare skin where his t-shirt had ridden up. Draco regained his bearings after a few moments- too quickly for Harry's liking.
“Hey, I’m really sorry. I’ve forgotten my money at home, can I pay you back at the end of the day?” Harry asks apologetically, feeling immensely uncomfortable.
Harry holds his hand out for Teddy to take. “Of course, Teddy. They’re all good Houses, and it doesn’t make a difference to me which one you’ll be in. The hat will put you in the House that suits you best. I can’t be against that, can I, Teddy bear?”
The soft lips pressing against his are the only thing he can feel. Kissing is the only thing he can do. He never wants to stop. Any thoughts remaining in his head turn to mush with every soft moan, every time their tongues intertwine, every time Draco rakes his fingers into Harry’s much-too-long hair.
“Sorry,” Draco mumbles, but giggles at Harry as he sways while exiting the bar a few steps in front of him. Maybe he was wrong about Draco’s liquor-holding skills.
After a few moments Harry feels his thoughts running. Anxiety bubbles up again so he takes Draco’s face into his hands once more.
Harry is rooted to the spot, watching the pair of them. He can hear Teddy talking animatedly about Andromeda and her chocolate eating habits. Draco has a small smile on his face but looks slightly uncomfortable.
It is three drinks and a shot later when Harry decides it would be an absolutely fantastic moment to ask Draco something he had wanted to know for a while now. He wants to know
Draco releases a breath and eyes the ceiling, looking as if a physical weight has been lifted from his shoulders.
“Thank you, Andromeda.” Harry can tell he still isn’t entirely comfortable calling her by her first name. “Yes, I had so much to do for my potion trial. Are you sure I wouldn’t be intruding?”
Ten minutes of serious deliberation later, Harry orders for them both and allows Teddy to sit at the table outside of the parlour so he could start eating his caramel-chocolate and hazelnut-raspberry scoops without delay. Harry is happy to see some treacle tart ice cream and waits patiently as the teenage employee scoops some up into a cone for him.
“What made you interested in making potions for a living? I mean, I know you’ve always been good at it and all…”
“Thank you for listening to me all evening. All of this…I don’t really talk about it with anyone anymore. People usually just get silent and change the subject. And then I feel like I shouldn’t have said anything.”
“I understand” He said, finally turning to Potter and giving him a smile “I feel the same when I heal people, like I’ve done something nice for them” He fidgeted with his fingers, trying to make out the rest of his sentence “And…I think you’d be a good Auror, just don’t get yourself hurt”
you’d forget to do so I get to bring him here?” Pansy turned to look at him and winked, earning a gasp from Ron “
“Yeah, I know” Draco placed his hands on Harry’s bare chest and slid them down slowly with a smirk forming on his lips “I can feel it, on my hips, right now”
“Only if you can win” He smirked and pulled Harry down by his beck, biting his ear gently and kissing the spot under it, it was Harry’s weak spot “
“Did you enjoy the meal?” Ron approached the bar with a bright smile, he placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders and gripped it tightly “Any comment?”
“I wonder what this hand could do to me in my bedroom” Smith whispered “We could be so good together again”
“Just, I hope it’s not much, but, please, er, don’t avoid me” Draco glanced at Potter when he said the words, so he knew something was wrong, but still, he was being understanding enough to wait for Draco to be ready to talk to him. Would the Potter in his world be like this too?
” Draco chuckled quietly and leaned in to kiss Harry, the Auror closed his eyes and sunk into the kiss. It felt like an absolute dream to finally kiss Draco, the softness of his lips, the taste of the champagne on Draco’s tongue, the small sounds the blond made every time Harry kissed him harder, it made Harry all fired up
!” Hermione gasped and smacked Pansy’s arm playfully while blushing, Draco chuckled and grabbed another champagne glass when the waiter came, he enjoyed his birthday party a lot. He had talked to his coworkers, his parents and his in-laws, he even stayed with his kids for a while but Harry’s parents took them, saying they wanted Draco to celebrate his birthday instead of taking care of his kids and told him to have fun, which he gladly obeyed. Draco was happy, he thought the start of his 40s would be depressing, he even expected himself to have some kind of mid life crisis, but he felt alright.
He stroke faster, his thumb gliding over the head of Draco’s cock, spreading the precum all over. Draco arched his back and pulled Harry down with him, Harry slammed in his sensitive bundle of nerves repeatedly while his hand was pleasing Draco’s front.
“It’s a walk down memory lane” Harry grinned at him “The day I kissed you…it was supposed to be the best day of your life, but I ruined it by forgetting it. I’m a dumb arsehole, I know, so…with our friends’ permissions, I asked for their memories of that day, and I watched all of it, and asked them to corporate with me, and…recreate that day for you” Harry stepped back a bit and sighed “Everything I said that night, about me liking you, it’s all true, you know”
“I told you it didn’t work” Draco said, realising that Potter was still sitting half shirtless in the hospital wing, he pointed at the robes and looked away “Put your clothes back on, you’re fine now”
much” Harry mumbled, his finger touched Draco’s jawline lightly, trailing it down to his chin and tilted his face up, planting a soft kiss on Draco’s plum and glossy lips “I can’t imagine a life without you, ever”
“Yeah, separately” Potter said, scratching the nape of his neck “I’m staying with my mum for a month, my dad for a month, and two weeks with Remus and Sirius”
“Well, you should, Hermione and Rose and I are in front of his place now, he called me earlier and cried—
“I’m still very much in love with you too, Draco Malfoy” Harry grinned before kissing him again, this time, it was deep. For the first time in the past months, Draco felt loved again, he felt secured, he was happy. Kissing Harry always felt like the first time, passionate, romantic, he could do it forever, he thought as Harry slipped his tongue inside his mouth, his hands sliding under Draco’s shirt. It was all he could ask for.
” Harry grimaced but soon forget about the pain when Draco started taking off his belt, he quickly work his hands down Draco’s robes but it has way too many buttons “You know, I never like Pureblood robes”
“I’m not worried, I just have a method of teaching him, Granger will mess it up” He answered coldly, his eyes glued on the book, Draco was sure he wasn’t reading at all. Even Blaise’s nostrils were flaring just a little bit, perhaps Draco’s senses were right. He smiled while looking at them, it was going the right way.
“Alright, just calm down, you’re like a scared Kneazle right now” She grabbed his shoulder and started talking, he listened carefully to everything she told him. From the start, since he was born, Draco then realised he was in some kind of alternate universe where everyone that had died in his world was all alive, no war ever happened, and everyone was in love with people he never expected them to be in love with. Potter was his boyfriend ever since Sixth Year, they have been best friends ever since they were five years old kids, when they bumped into each other on the street. His father, who seemed to be a kind man in this world, suggested they should have play dates, and somehow Potter’s parents agreed, and they’ve been friends ever since. Pansy was in love with Granger from First Year when they met on the Hogwarts Express, and have been a couple since the Yule Ball, Blaise and Ron were in a secret relationship, the Weasley girl turned out to have a big crush on Lovegood and they just started dating a week ago, and his friend Theodore was also in love with Neville and they have been a couple for almost a year.
Pansy shouted so loud that everyone moved away quickly, Hermione crouched down on the ground, pulling out her wand “What’s wrong with her?”
Theo squealed, raising his hand up in the air that was intertwined with Neville “Just this afternoon after the photoshoot”
I cannot believe we’re leaving Hogwarts tomorrow” Pansy smacked his arm and squealed loudly, the graduation ceremony had just finished, and everything went well. Draco wasn’t quite himself yet, he couldn’t sleep much the night before, he couldn’t stop thinking about Harry “Hey, what’s wrong with you?”
“I wanted to help you, Potter, but it seems like you’re a brat that can’t hold a decent conversation with others”
Draco flipped another page over on his book, his eyes glancing at Blaise and Ron, who were studying at the table in front of him. It’s been an hour, normally Blaise’d get so angry he stopped talking to Pansy when she asked too many obvious questions. But Blaise hasn’t done it to Ron, so it was a good thing, since another week has passed, perhaps their relationship has evolved just a bit.
“Now, go up and start packing, we will come help you later” His mother placed her hand on his forearm and smiled.
This was it, Draco was so scared, he felt tears forming around the rim of his eyes, the man behind could be a creep, a thief, a rapist, or a killer, none of those sounded good. Draco feared for his life, he’s young, he has so many things to accomplish, he didn’t want to be in this situation. It has been another five minutes, he wondered why this man hasn’t made a move yet, but it was better than the man attacking him now. Draco rustled through his bag, trying to find at least
“Come on, get up so I can scoot over” Harry laughed softly and watched Draco got up, they all sat a little closer so the blond can squeeze in, just like that, they all started talking.
“Haven’t you noticed?” He said, avoiding her eyes, instead he kept looking at the certain group of Gryffindors “I hope you will”
don’t be stubborn” She cupped his face and sighed “Do you think Hermione and I never fight? Do you know how hard it was in our first few months together? Even in the first year of our relationship, we still fought, over even the stupidest things ever” Pansy pinched his cheek and smiled “But we worked on it, now we barely raise out voice to each other. Love doesn’t come that easily, you two will fight, but you will work on it, unless in some certain circumstances like infidelity, violence or stuff like that, then I can’t force you” She trailed her hands down his shoulders and held it tightly “But I know, you won’t give up that easy, I know, that a small part of you
“You see where I’m going with this?” Harry muttered seductively, burying his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, his beard tickling the blond. Harry started growing his beard out years ago, and Draco absolutely loved it, the blond tilted his head to the side, inviting Harry in for more as the firefighter’s hand slipped under Draco’s outfit. He felt shivers running up and down his spine when Harry kept nibbling the sensitive spots on his neck, his hands were playing with Draco’s nipples, the blond pushed his arse back to Harry’s crotch when he felt the bulge already poking him. Harry grabbed the blond by his chin and turned his head around, locking their lips together in for a heated kiss. Kissing Harry has always felt the same, like he was being devoured by a beast, in a good way, and he always begged for more, his kisses were both tender and intense at the same time. He could taste the champagne off Harry’s tongue, he felt his skin burning a bit when Harry’s beard kept scratching his face, his hands reaching around to undo his husband’s belt.
“I know, me too, I know now, I only need you” He said, sniffling a bit and pouting at Harry when he remembered what happened back in the pub “When I saw you, I also thought you’ve moved on, you were smiling with everyone”
loveable, but it annoyed Draco, because he knew this Potter here wasn’t like the one he knew. If he fell for him any harder, he wouldn’t be able to bear his own feelings when he got back, that was why he wanted to refrain from doing things that made him swooned by Potter.
“Who’s Brandon?” Ron poked Harry and asked again, putting his chef hat on the kitchen counter and leaned on it next to Harry, their shoulders barely touched “Oh, is it Draco’s new boyfriend?”
talking” Ron looked down, hiding a smile at Blaise’s words “I can stop interacting with them, I can even act like they’re strangers. I won’t look at other guys when I’m with or without you. I have stopped doing it with other guys from the moment I knew I like you, I swear, ask Draco, or Pansy” Blaise tilted Ron’s chin up by his finger and smiled “I will do
of hers, and he really didn’t want to bring her down, even though he didn’t like it, she was his friend and he will be there for her
“I mean, er” He glanced at their friends, all of them were ogling at him, forcing him to spit the truth out…but he would never “I think you should go on this date”
“I’m just…” Draco swallowed hard “I really hate eating seafood, all the peeling, cracking, I’d rather just eat more fish”
, but my mummies said you aren’t, and I was sad, but then mommy gave me ice cream without telling mum, and then I’m happy again” Harry chuckled softly at her story, he also wished he could get ice cream and stopped sulking over Draco “Auntie Ginny says if you and uncle Draco get married, I get to be a—a flower girl”
“Cheesy, but I get it” Ron nodded, putting the ring back in the box and gave it back to Harry, huffing out a soft breath “You sure you don’t want to do it? I think there’s a reason you brought it here tonight”
solution…or you know, you can stay there pining over him until you both grow old and you’ll die regretting not telling Draco how you felt”
“It won’t, trust me” Theo reassured him “Not because I have done it a lot, because I prepared already, and you
“Be you, be persistent and believe in yourself. I did that and it worked, right?” He said, making Draco chuckled, he did have a good point “And remember, I love you, back when we were kids, now, in the future, in another life, another universe, I’ll still love you”
, I didn’t expect it either” Theo laughed and sighed happily “I felt it, you know, in my heart, that he’s right for me, Neville is right for me”
“I do not need to know that, Ron” He laughed quietly and sighed again, he sometimes still thought about it, about the fact that Draco moved to Paris to become a Healer there. Sometimes he woke up with sweats on his forehead and a bulge under his boxer, because he dreamt about that night again. It was so memorable that he could not forget how it felt, how he felt when he was inside Draco, the way his body writhed and the sound he made underneath Harry, how they managed to do it multiple times a night until both of them fell asleep, or perhaps he was the only one that really slept.
“If you say so” He shrugged, knowing he was, since Theodore was an easy one to read “I thought you wanted to get back with your former lover”
“Hey, where’s…Haley?” Hermione asked carefully when Harry got back to their table. He had got the ring back from her and told her to understand what was happening, that he had no feelings for her, it ended in a few tears from Haley but he had to let her go, she crossed the line.
” Pansy squeaked, clutching on Hermione’s wrist on the table “Is that…” Harry glanced at Draco when Pansy asked, he supposed Draco knew now, the ring band fitted perfectly on her finger, he didn’t know it could even work, but Draco’s fingers were thin and elegant, so of course it’d fit a girl.
“Alright” He turned around, swatting Harry’s hands away, opening his robes and unbuttoning his shirt “I’ll show you why I didn’t apologise to you, out of all people”
“You are very much pissed too, Harry” He said “I can smell the Firewhisky from your mouth” Half of them were on the edge of passing out already, the rest were the responsible ones, holding themselves back, like Draco
“Oh, of course not” Harry said and quickly stood up with Draco, getting out of the booth to let the girls go
“You’re so lewd” Harry said as he came to the big revelation, he didn’t even know this fact about Draco himself, but he loved it. The blond didn’t answer, instead he licked a line up Harry’s jawline and knelt down steadily, his eyes locked with the Auror. The second Draco has his lips on Harry’s cock, he felt like his world had just exploded. Not in a million years has he ever think he’d be able to see Draco on his knees, his mouth on Harry’s length, swallowing it whole without any hesitation. Harry smacked his head against the wall, but he didn’t feel any pain, the ecstasy was filling him up instead “
“I, I guess what I’m saying is, I like you a lot, er, I think I’m falling in love with you, and, er, I really want to propose to you for real, someday” Harry took a deep breath and stood up, he slowly bent down on one knee and pulled out the ring box inside his pocket, he opened it and looked at Draco, he has never felt so scared yet brave before, his heart was thumping, his hands were shaking and his knees were weak “Draco, will you marry me…one day?” He looked down at the ring before looking back at Draco, who was gaping at him, his mouth opened, his eyes didn’t blink at all. And it was different from all those fake proposals they have done, because he knew Draco’s acting face, but now, he knew Draco wasn’t faking it, he was stunned “This, er, it could be our promise ring, and one day, maybe I can ask you to marry me again. And I hope, er, we can say I
“This is the Mirror of Erised, I’ve seen it, but it’s cracked now” He pointed his wand at the mirror and looked at Draco “Is it really broken?”
“Yeah, because then, I asked is there any universe where you two aren’t kissing, then the funny part is, Ron suggested maybe a world where you two hate each other” Pansy said, he knew Lovegood was always the one to say weird things, but he didn’t know the things she said might actually be true “But then you said, and I quote ‘
!” Draco groaned mentally when he heard their answering machine. He couldn’t reach either of them on their mobile phones so he called their home phone, they were on their usual Friday date night, of course, so they wouldn’t answer their phone until the next morning. He had sent her a text saying ‘
“Are you seducing me?” He smiled and Harry gave him a lopsided smile, pulling him closer “Because we just did it like less than five minutes ago”
Harry murmured as Draco looked up at him, he tightened his grip on the blond’s hair and pushed Draco further, he breathed in with his nose, swirling his tongue inside. He has done it way too many times to know just which way to make Harry go insane. Harry leaned back on the table, pushing himself inside Draco’s mouth as the blond moaned in pleasure “
“Okay, okay” Pansy nodded, clearing her throat “Do you, Harry Potter, take Draco Malfoy to be your lawfully wedded husband?”
“Come on, I could never carry you up here, we’re the same size” Draco pointed out, they practically have the same height, normally it’d take both him and Pansy to bring him up. Blaise could easily carry him too but he would use magic instead “I can’t believe you cuddle with him”
“What’s this, mummy?” They heard Hugh pointing at something on the water and the girls leaning close to look
“It’s my fault” Harry said, smiling and kissing Draco’s lips, he looked at the door and held the blond’s hand “Do you think our friends are right outside listening?”
“Oh, okay” Potter yawned, closing his mouth and stood up, extending his arm to Draco, waiting for him to take it “Oh, I forgot” He retreated it when Draco flinched, there was something heavy in his chest, as if someone was telling him he was hurting Potter by acting like this, Potter must have thought Draco would follow him like usual
” Ron admitted to Harry and grabbed the cup of beer when Blaise approached him “But you didn’t want to leave your office, so we used plan B, tying you up and bring you here”
“Oh right” Draco said “Sit down” He gestured and glanced at Harry one last time before focusing on Seamus
?” Draco asked when Harry didn’t finish his sentence, and since they understood each other, Draco slowly turned around to look at the direction Harry was staring at
“Hey” Draco leaned over, whispering into Harry’s ear, he got an idea in his mind “Ever think of doing any wild thing like that? Fucking in a public restroom like Blaise and Ron, or in the Ministry’s lift like Nev and Theo?”
“Alright, no big deal” He ran his hands through his hair and tried to fix it while calming his breath, Draco ran for five straight minutes without stopping, he has to have a break first “Just knock” He murmured to himself, and knocked on the door twice. Draco waited, tapping his foot on the ground and fiddled with his fingers, he looked around, there was no one around, only the streetlights. He knocked on the door again and bit on his lips, maybe Potter was asleep, it was an hour after they got home, and it was nearly midnight, so it was possible that Potter has gone to b—Draco stilled himself the second he heard the doorknob rattled, he braced himself for this moment, it was all or nothing.
“Hey” Granger came to the table again, looking at the three of them “There are quite a lot of books, do you mind helping me? Oh, you don’t have to go, Draco. Just these two, they’re pretending to study like I know they are” She rolled her eyes,
that in you, because you put up a fight, I love a challenge” Harry said “Even when we’re best friends, we still have duels, Quidditch matches every week to test each other, I love bickering with you. Ask our friends, we still fight like crazy”
“I don’t know” He rubbed his own hands unconsciously, something was bothering him “Is it my business?”
He heard Pansy squealed quietly in front of them, but he was still gazing into Draco’s eyes, who was grinning at him. When the blond suddenly winked, Harry knew Draco was just teasing him, that no matter what he did, he still didn’t have feelings for Harry, which made his whole happy mood go down quite fast.
“She’s just excited about the party, ignore her” Granger said, even when they were done with studying, she still has a book in her hands. Pansy would always joke around, asking Granger whether she loved books or Pansy more “Harry, are you visiting your mum and dad this summer?”
” Draco grabbed her hand to stop her from poking him, so this must be how Robards felt when she threatened him “I just, because it’s complicated, Pansy. What if, let’s say I confess to him, we become a couple, and then what? We are too different, we will fight all the time, eventually he will grow tired of me and dump me for another person, and then our relationship will be ruined, and then you guys will have to have
“It’s alright” Hermione put her hand on top of Pansy’s, pressing a kiss on her rosy cheek “I will convince Robards again”
“You better” She said, her frown turning into a smile soon after “Still, I’m happy you two finally got together. But…get a room”
Draco mumbled, watched as Harry aligned himself up at his entrance. When he slowly pushed in, Draco gripped on his arm and pushed back, making it go deeper. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist as their chests touched, he kissed Draco lovingly and trailed the kisses down his neck “
“This is our promise rings” Harry said, slipping the band on Draco’s ring finger gently “I know we’re still young, but this is a promise from me to you, that I will do everything I can to make you happy. Then, maybe after a while, I can ask for your hand in marriage”
“Can I ask you out on a date then?” Harry asked, and Draco looked up, staring at Harry from the kitchen with surprise in his eyes.
was Draco. It was easy asking Madam Pince, she loved sweets and just with a few boxes of chocolates that his mother sent him, he was able to persuade her.
Draco walked in the meeting room quietly as some of the Aurors looked at him on his way in, they were already all there, waiting for him to talk about the newest case. He walked to the spot in front of the huge table and looked around, his eyes landing at Potter’s horrid hair today. Couldn’t he just comb his bloody hair for once? Not to mention, his robes needed ironing. The moment Potter looked back at him, Draco quickly looked away.
“You could walk around in a box and I’d still be turned on by you” Harry laughed, touching their noses together, making Draco snicker with him “Have you
“Er” Robards’s Adam’s apple bopped up and down, the Head Auror finally grabbed Pansy’s hand and pushed it down gently “I don’t, Miss Parkinson, you’re perfectly capable of blowing this place up. And…” The Head Auror looked back at the table full of Aurors and raised his hand, that’s when Draco prayed silently in his mind,
“Draco, I…I’m not sure how to say this, I’ve been trying the whole day today, and even before that” Harry said, still holding on Draco’s hand “You know that I love you, right?” He slowly slid down from the couch and crouched down on one knee, watching Draco’s expression turned from sleepy into shock “We’ve been together for so long…”
“So…six people just randomly know Potter’s length?” Draco asked, because what the fuck? How could…? Why would…? He just… “I don’t understand”
” Draco covered his mouth when Harry thrusted up into him, he glared at the git before looking at Luna “So soon?”
” Theo murmured, his heels digging on Neville’s back. He would do anything to always be Neville’s, this was both the worst and best day of his life, but the ‘worst’ part was slowly replaced with the ‘best’, now that Neville was fucking him deep, with every stroke that hit his prostate, he could come any second now. Theo squeezed Neville’s hands, and the Auror slammed in harder. It wasn’t fast and short like with other men he had been with, Neville was slow, soft, passionate and so, so
“I know they will” Harry said, pressing a kiss on his head, his other arm wrapping Draco close “You’re more loveable than you think” Draco laughed quietly at his words, and noticed Harry was pulling something from his pocket, surprising him even more “Draco”
” Blaise finally spoke after being nudged by Ron for the tenth time “Perhaps, you should wait a little more before you accept his offer”
She had told him he was good at it and promised him a place as a Healer in St. Mungo’s after he graduated from Hogwarts. He didn’t believe her at first, but eventually he realised she was a kind woman, and she couldn’t be lying. And he has been helping her for three months now, already preparing for a future where he saved people. He didn’t expect himself to be a Healer, yet he found himself loving the feeling when he helped people, it made him feel…good, as if he wanted to make up for his past of doing bad things to others.
“They are, Harry” Draco said, he has caught the couple snogging secretly in the Restricted Section in the library many times but it wasn’t his business to tell anyone. And based on the way Harry was still staring at him in shock, Harry has no clue about it “They’re just doing it in secret, they have been doing it since the beginning of the year. Everyone knows, how could you not know? You guys live in the same dorm with them. And they just kissed in there when the ceremony ended, didn’t you see?
Ron exclaimed loudly but then shut himself up after Madam Pince shushed him “No, I don’t get it at all”
“Neville turned her offer down, of course, said he was already having feelings for someone else, then she cried a bit, Neville comforted her, then after she went home, Neville then just rushed away, then Seamus fell asleep at the bar and I had to bring him home”
“Personally? I don’t think so” Granger shook her head, he knew she’d always be the logical one here “Why do you ask?”
“Why are we here?” He said, looking around to see many tables were decorated with roses and there were balloons around the pub, waiters and waitress were wearing heart shaped headbands “
” Draco rolled his eyes, he turned 30 just last month, and everyone, including his parents have been nagging him about getting a partner, he wanted to, there was just no right person for him “I’m just focusing on my job”
“Oh, er, you know I don’t mind you…er, you know” Harry uttered when he remembered what Pansy had told him
“Here are your meals, sir” Rose grinned and received the wine bottle from Blaise’s hand, which she poured carefully down “The entrees will include, Pasta Aglio e Olio, I have memorised it, for uncle Harry, and Pasta with Browned Butter, Anchovy, and Kale, for uncle Draco” Rose said, following Blaise after she was done with serving the appetisers
“I know” Draco’s lips formed into a smile, he pouted a bit when Harry pulled out, but gasped as soon as Harry pushed his fingers inside again “
He gaped but Pansy only shrugged and walked away. What was she talking about? He exhaled and glanced at Harry, who was still talking to Hermione, he turned to look at Draco. And the blond’s heart skipped a beat, just by looking, he was still able to sweep Draco off his feet. He felt his throat burning up and he looked back at Lilian “I’m sorry, I’m just a mess right now”
“It is?” Potter wondered, raising his hands and humming “I never noticed, I just thought it was normal” He said, putting his hands on his lap “Are you going to be a Healer?”
cheat on you. And infidelity is a horrible, horrible action in my opinion, I would never condone it. So I guess…it’s a yes from me”
“You’re forty and single” Pansy mumbled to him, sipping from her colourful glass of cocktail with her hair fell down to her shoulder “Harry,
Draco finished the letter and heaved a long breath, so time must have really gone by when he was brought there, he thought it might have just been a dream.
“Does Pansy need tutoring again?” He finally stopped writing and looked at Draco “I thought she’d need it once we’re a day before the test?” Somehow Eighth Year took a little longer to end than the semester he had spent over there, so now Draco has to study again for the N.E.W.T.s tests, but it was fine, he enjoyed it.
“Hey, you’re here” Potter beamed at him, grabbing a glass of blue drink that the Hufflepuff have made and giving it to Draco “Here, your favourite”
“Just, just listen, alright?” He mumbled and kept going “Three months ago, I saw the mirror for the first time, I saw us there too, apparently I’ve wanted you before I even realised, I was stunned and I tried to blow the mirror up” He said, pointing at the crack on the mirror “When I touched it, I woke up in another place, an alternate universe. Everyone was alive, even your parents” He said, watching Harry’s expression unfold “There was no war, everyone was happy. Everyone was together, Hermione and Pansy, Blaise and Ron, Ginny and Luna, even Neville and Theodore…and, us too” He looked away when he said the last two words “We were in love, we were a couple there. I was stuck there for more than a month, I was friends with everyone, I fell for you, well, not you, the other Harry Potter”
” Pansy rolled her eyes annoyingly with her arms folded, Hermione tilted the phone to her side and continued
“Is this…” Harry asked, looking around as he was holding Draco’s hand “The party that year? After graduation?”
“I want you to keep it” Harry chuckled in his ear and knelt down to pulled Draco’s trousers up again, he spun the blond around and buttoned his trousers up for him before putting his own trousers back on. The firefighter leaned in and kissed Draco’s cheek, pulling a handkerchief from his inside pocket and cleaned the sweats on Draco’s forehead and then using it to clean his hands and the mess Draco made on the floor.
“No, Draco, don’t lash out at him” Brandon said soothingly, whispering in Draco’s ear “It’s my fault, maybe I did something to make him mad”
” Harry groaned, his hand cupping the nape of Draco’s neck. The blond pulled his mouth away, swiping his wet lips with his hand and slithered back up from under the table, he straddled Harry’s thighs, feeling the Auror’s hard cock poking at the cleft of his arse from outside of his trousers
“See? You agreed as well” He chuckled and continued under her sceptical gaze “I just…I want to change, if anything, I want to be a better person. That’s why I want to apologise to everyone I’ve hurt, Luna, you, I’m sorry for acting like a total arse”
“You’ll feel…horrible if you don’t see them every day, you will feel like someone is ripping your heart apart if you can’t be with them, and all you want to do is love them, protect them, be next to them. When you visit a random place, eat a random food, do a random thing, and it reminds you of them, or you want them to be with you right there. When everything they do makes you…have these butterflies in your stomach, the tingling feeling inside you. When you feel like you’re on cloud nine when they call you by your first name” She smiled, tilting his chin up with her finger “When you feel the need to always make them smile. When they’re on your mind every second of the day, when they still look absolutely perfect to you even when they look like shit. And…you know you’re in love when you’re questioning it” She pulled him in a hug and let his face be buried in her soft hair “That’s how I know I’m in love with Pansy”
The door burst opened when the Weasley girl barged in with Lovegood behind her “You don’t know how long it took me and Luna to escape that sugar party there” She meant the Hufflepuff party, Draco could only assume that. The redhead pulled her girlfriend by her waist and they both squeezed into the long couch, making Potter sit closer to Draco, as if it wasn’t awkward enough already
” His voice broke when Harry opened the black box in his hand, showing him the two silver bands, it was simple but beautiful nonetheless. It was surprises after surprises, Draco felt his stomach fluttering and pressing his lips together to stop himself from crying, it didn’t work when tears came running down his face again.
She stopped when Draco held her back “I remembered that there were a lot of articles about Potter, and some others. But mostly were about the famous stories, and how we’re all wondering where he was”
“I’m sorry you had to go through that” Harry told him, it made Draco look up at the detective and realised his eyes were green, it was so alluring, Draco couldn’t stop staring
“Say you’re beautiful” Harry stood up, but his fingers creeped down and he pushed a digit in, making Draco jolted a bit
” He exclaimed, and everyone looked at him, he softened up and cleared his throat, his eyes stopped at Pansy “Pansy, he’s ready, give him the animal”
“So we were both mutually obsessed with each other” Harry hummed, flashing him a huge grin “Then we must be destined to be together”
“Here” Harry pulled out the ring from inside his shirt, his ring was simpler, with no diamonds and just a short sentence engraved inside it, he put the ring on a necklace to wear so Draco wouldn’t notice if he wore it on his hand.
” Ginny pointed at Ron, whose hair was being ruffled by Blaise gently, she stuck her tongue out at her brother and leaned back on Luna lazily “
Harry stammered, squeezing the cream into his hands and rubbed it together, his movements when he touched Draco’s skin were slow and careful, like he was afraid Draco would break. The blond laughed quietly and grabbed Harry’s wrists, placing his rough hands on Draco’s bare chest and moved it down to his own stomach
” Draco murmured and pushed Harry back until they both hit the table “We might as well make a special memory here” He licked his lower lip and kissed Harry, feeling his tongue slipping inside. Harry’s kisses were always full of passion, love, and even without wine, Draco still felt drunk on it. He sucked on Harry’s bottom lip while his hands went sliding up and down his husband’s firm chest, all the Auror training paid off well. He bit playfully and made Harry hiss.
I’m fine” Draco took a deep breath, putting his hands on Harry’s shoulder and sitting down until Harry was all inside him. The blond began bouncing up and down slowly to get used to the size, even when they have been doing it like rabbits ever since the vacation started, his entrance was still tight every time Harry thrust in “
“Er, no, I didn’t mean…” Potter said, standing up and stuttering like a kid “I just thought…no, never mind that” He exhaled and headed for the door, he looked at Draco, eyes focused on him and the corner of his lips turned up for a small smile “Er, thank you, Malfoy”
“Right” Pansy nodded knowingly. Draco groaned inside his mind, the mischievous cow was now married to
, it was all fine until his horse went crazy and that was when Draco fell off the horse, and since the place was crowded with Muggles, he couldn’t heal it there right away, he has to get back to his suite first
“I could never” Harry cupped his cheeks as Draco leaned into it “Like Luna said, there are many universes, and maybe your world doesn’t have the same beginning like us, it can still have the same ending. Don’t you think?”
He moaned when Harry finally pushed it all inside and started thrusting slowly. Draco locked his legs around Harry’s waist when he began quickening his pace “
“Fair point” He said before walking away. He knew Blaise, the guy was so patient, too patient if he was being honest. If he could help Pansy pass her tests, helping Ron would be no big deal to him. Draco walked in Charms class and sat down next to Pansy, who was huffing and grunting with Daphne on the next table
Harry kissed him tenderly, caressing his lips while his hands trailed from Draco’s neck down to his waist, pulling him closer until their chest touched. Draco smiled into the kiss and embraced Harry tightly, he’d definitely join Harry’s birthday tonight, after all, he has become his boyfriend.
“Aren’t you late for your date?” Harry looked at the Muggle clock on the wall and tried to distract Draco “It’s almost eight, you should get ready, you haven’t even done your hair. I’ll go make some food then, are you hungry? I sure am. Maybe you can eat something light before you go, or not, I’ll just make—…”
He said, running out of there as quick as possible. Why did he insult him again? Moreover, why did he call him Harry? He ruined it all, Draco could not make it worse.
“Wanna get off?” Potter turned to ask him and Draco realised he won’t get to be on his back anymore, he nodded and slowly got off to the ground
“Stop blaming him” Luna finally appeared into the screen, sitting down next to Ginny with a soft smile on her face and her cat in her lap “How can we help you?”
” Draco mumbled to himself, he clutched on his bag and shook his head, his right foot tapping repeatedly on the ground, he was standing in the middle of the Great Hall alone, his back against the wall. They have just finished eating dinner, and guess what day it was,
” Draco ruffled Potter’s messy hair, as if he was a dog. After a while, Potter just stared at him and Draco had to retreat his hand to cover his blush instead, he faked a cough and got back to watching Hermione and Pansy
” Pansy shrieked when the doorbell rang loudly “Draco’s here, everyone in position, Blaise, Ron get back in the kitchen! Everyone else, settle down! Gin, come on, dinner hasn’t even started yet”
” The blond turned around to see Goldstein again, who was waving has a huge smile on his face “Want to sit next to me?”
“We…” Draco blushed, giggling a bit before turning his head around and spoke “We did it the first time on the balcony of that rooftop too”
