But Malfoy just licked the pre-come away and came back to Harry’s balls, slowly licking them, and then lower again on Harry’s perineum.
"Wow, Draco," Harry said, not tearing his eyes off the scene, "my hair really was horrible back then!"
. No, having a fuck-buddy was simply too perfect. Draco always loved a good shag, which Potter was.
Harry felt guilt and shame creeping over his face and chest and he dropped his gaze. “I know. I’m so sorry, Ginny.”
Potter, but you’re a fucking lost cause, always wearing your emotions on your sleeve!”
Draco nodded, his eyes fluttering closed and his smile hollowing his cheeks in the dimples Harry loved so much. Damn, but he wanted to brush his fingers over them, kiss them, worship them with his lips.
“Do you remember,” Malfoy whispered at his ear, “the safe word?”
He clamps hard on your cock every now and then, and you see stars.
Harry’s world must have turned upside down because there was no way he’d heard that right. Ignoring the way his heart was vibrating in every fibre of his body, Harry scrambled for something to say, anything. He took a marble and fidgeted with it. “Erm, these are beautiful. Did you buy them?”
“Did you... just say… dildo?” Ron had a horrified look that didn’t match the smirk on his wife’s face. “Can I see it?” Hermione was stretching her neck to try to have a peek at the gift too.
Malfoy smoothed a hand down Harry’s feathers, gentle and intent. Harry hadn’t even noticed his wings coming out.
“Oooh, but he’s so cool with his glittering grey eyes—”
“Okay, I think... I
You shake your head. Clench your fists to prevent the tears from spilling. He stands up, reaches you with two big strides, and punches you in the guts.
When Harry turned, his face was more relaxed, lips tugging to a lopsided smile. “Why is it so important to you?”
Harry’s mind felt empty, as if he couldn’t think of anything that wasn’t Jacob and having his stupid bond removed once and for all. When he finally saw him entering the room at St. Mungo’s that Draco set up for the breaking of the bond, Harry wasn’t even angry anymore.
“You’ve chosen him as your mate for life. Harry, have you read even one of the books about Veelas I’ve given you?”
Potter nodded, still staring at the lily and when he spoke, he did it directly to the flower. “This is weird. Um… Do you— Are you… sure your magic…?” He didn’t get to finish his sentence, as a voice interrupted them.
With a gesture, Harry made all his clothes disappear.
the problem, Blaise. He did, and I don’t know why and I never thanked him and how the fuck am I supposed to greet them?”
Draco shook his head; without even realising it, he had put down his glass and was now grasping the edge of the table so tightly his hands started to feel numb. Pansy sighed, gesturing towards Draco’s glass of wine.
Spent the rest of the night loathing him. Scowling at the way his suit trousers hugged that perky arse, at the way his perfect lips only turned slightly up in a kind but modest smile, the way he’d walk around looking like a fucking model.
This is sick!”
A full page picture of Malfoy, standing proud in a black fitted uniform, at the middle section of the newspaper.
He had cried all his tears that night, married Astoria the day after, and carried on his life,
They were all destroyed after the War and before that they were high security items.”
Pansy eventually saved him from his embarrassment and spoke.
“Yes, you stupid git, I’m okay with that.” Draco rolled his eyes, but added, “Thank you, though, for asking.”
^^^^^
, they had said. To see if you were able to think quickly, discern what was true from what wasn’t. Draco had made it his own personal goal to be the best prankster in the entire Department.
Draco now opened both his eyes and they stared at the horizon, where sky and water met in a trembling line, in front of them in silence.
Harry had scrunched up his face, mocking him, ready to reply, “Okay, but why—”
“But no one was supposed to know where I was. It was a secret mission.” Malfoy’s expression was deeply perplexed until realisation dawned. “Fuck, you can— your Veela tells you where I am, doesn’t it? And the other day! After sex, you practically
That was when Draco took Harry to visit his childhood home, a big Manor similar to the one in London; telling him how he had spent the first six years of his life there, and then always came back every summer. It was currently 1985, past-Draco was five years old and they snooped around the French household under the Invisibility Cloak.
, Potter, it’s what, the fourth or fifth time? It’s
With his cock still hard in his pants, Draco made a cup of hot tea and went to lay on his hammock in the veranda of his cabin. Even if it was evening, the sky was still bright and clear, and a light breeze gently dishevelled Draco’s hair, soothing his nerves.
“Nngh, honey, you’re so fucking hot and tight…” Harry whispered, holding onto him for dear life. Draco smiled hotly, his cheeks showing two perfect dimples, melting Harry’s already nonexistent bones. He lowered again, slowly, until he bottomed out and was fully seated on Harry’s cock.
“Right, Bill and Fleur. Sure, I guess so. I mean, Fleur would look ethereal even in a trash bag.” Draco scooped a hand to his hair, smoothing it flat on his head again, tucking it behind his ear, nervously rolling his waves around one finger.
Potter’s messy hair was the first thing Draco saw, fanning out over one of Draco’s pyjama t-shirts. Draco’s eyes travelled lower, stopping at Potter’s round arse cheeks, hugged in too-tight-to-be-comfortable pants, not able to resist ogling Potter’s lean thighs, the hairs on his legs looking unfairly soft.
That was true. Harry had been surprised to hear that meticulous order leave his mouth, as if it were the most normal thing in the world. But the truth was — it
“What…?” Draco turned to find Potter a few metres behind him, an embarrassed smile on his face and a blush covering his cheeks.
Malfoy glanced up at him, then down at the cauldron again. “We could play a game.  ‘I’ll tell you mine, you’ll tell me yours’.” Malfoy’s cheeks turned a bright red as his eyes widened. Briefly, his eyes found Harry’s again, and he muttered, “I don’t know why I said that. It was stupid.”
His voice came clearly from behind Harry. He had followed him, then.
“The wanker, and he didn’t tell us, all this time! Do we know him? Her? Please tell me they’re a ‘he’.”
“I’m here,” Draco said, feeling stupid at the statement but still afraid of letting himself believe this was really happening.
Harry kneeled next to him, drawing his wand. “You can try to
Harry’s chuckle sent sparks of pleasure throughout Draco’s body as his balls tightened. “Come for me. I want to taste you, Draco.”
Shifting his head to Boo-boo he smiled, trying to distract himself.
.” The ‘s’ unrolled pleasantly on his tongue and Harry realised he’d spoken Parseltongue without meaning to.
“Here.” He enclosed Lady Luck in a ball of ocean water and levitated it towards Potter.
“Draco, why do you swear so much, honestly!”
Potter chuckled, dropping his gaze to the floor. “Well, yes. I missed it a lot this week, you know?” He finally raised his eyes, bright and greener than ever. Draco wondered if it was possible to love a colour, and, if so, he was certain he loved green. Not all greens, but the exact shades of green he was looking at right at that moment.
“You…”
"Erm," Malfoy seemed to be thinking hard about the words to use. But in the end he only exhaled a, "Yes."
He offered his hand to her to seal the deal. She narrowed her eyes at it and slowly smiled. Shook it. “Deal.”
Well, that wasn’t entirely true, either. Because the truth was that before he started this ‘whatever-this-is-for-the-last-time’ thing with Malfoy, they’d been friends.
“Harry!”
“I think my time has come.” Draco got up, amazed at his ability to stand up without falling or swaying. Pansy followed, muttering something that sounded like, “You really can’t hold your liquor, Draco.”
Hoping to not meet anyone he knew, Harry went to a park nearby, laying on the grass and watching the sky, trying to guess the funny forms of the clouds. The first drop of rain splashed Harry’s glasses as a tear crossed his cheek.
again — the way he rolled the ‘r’ in a kind of spanish accent, the way his warm tone pronounced it, like all those years ago that suddenly seemed not that far away — when he felt Harry's hands on his belt-loops, his lips mouthing at Draco's neck.
“Ow, you bas—”
“You fucked!” Theo’s cheerful voice butts in and Draco raises an eyebrow to him. Since when was he eavesdropping the conversation?
They went to sleep without eating that night, lost in conversation about their love, about what they liked in each other, reminding each other how wonderful the other was. The last thing Harry remembered, before drifting off to sleep, was Draco murmuring into his ear how lucky he had been to meet Harry, to have him in his life, that he would never exchange this cursed life with another if it meant losing Harry.
“I don’t see why I should agree! It’s not my dare!” Malfoy was half-shouting to Pansy, who looked far too amused.
Malfoy waved a hand in front of Harry, scowling. “Okay, okay! Well! If you don’t like my notes, you could have just said so.”
As soon as the words were out of his mouth, Draco realised they were the stupidest thing he could have possibly said. He sealed his lips and scrunched up his face, waiting for the scathing reply; but it didn’t arrive. Instead, Potter stopped walking, and turned to face Draco, an indecipherable look on his face.
A heavy silence fell over their table. Astoria and Ginevra looked like statues, astonished expressions frozen on their faces. In that exact moment, the waiter brought them their first courses: spaghetti amatriciana for Ginevra, two pizzas for Draco and Harry, spaghetti mussels and clams for Astoria.
Maybe it wasn’t Gryffindors’ fault, after all.
weird.
. It never worked well for him.
"Erm, right, ah-ah, just funny, thanks Remi. Anyway… Do you guys remember the Time-Turner?”
ed two brooms he took out of his pockets, casting strong Disillusionment Charms on them both.
“Gods, Malfoy, I… that was…”
—  but he shook his head, trying to resist the Veritaserum. “No questions, Malfoy. I’ll tell you mine, you’ll tell me yours.”
"Are you two married?"
When the moon was starting to fall down and make space for the rising sun, Potter led Draco towards the shores, taking off his tremendous leather sandals and dipping his feet into the cold water, hissing at the feeling.
As it turns out, that wasn’t the last time. Nor was the time after that, or the one after that, and—
Draco feebly shook his head, then let out a resigned sigh. “Er, maybe?”
“Are you alright?” Harry asked. He was so close that his breath ghosted over Draco’s cheek— and when had Harry reached him? Draco turned to look at Harry, his vision locked on his bright eyes. It looked like he forgot how to speak for a moment, lost in the way the light danced in those green irises, his gaze shifting lower to Harry’s plump lips.
“White blond is old, Harry!”
“Because I didn’t! Florence! No… Just, before, we were talking close by my great-great-grandfather’s portrait and he started doing so…”
, turtles are slow! She’s carrying eggs, what do you expect?"
"We know." Malfoy again used that silky tone. It was unsettling for Harry to hear him speak so kindly.
Pansy raised an eyebrow, putting down her fork to get a pen and a paper out of her large leather bag. “He knows the chef of this restaurant.”
“Oh, yes, Harry, yes, fuck, those pads… aah…” Draco started moving around the dildo to feel it against his walls, scraping his nerves. He brought a hand to his cock and meowled when his fingers finally wrapped around it.
Malfoy’s face lit up with a bright smile. “I don’t want to see you ever again, either, git.”
Draco sucked in a breath. Released it. “The… you know. Between the guests… there’s also… Potter. And Granger and Weasley.
of Bacalar, you know."
He felt himself smiling back, and Malfoy brought a hand to stroke Harry’s hair, and opened his mouth only to close it immediately after. He blushed and looked almost scared.
Harry had nodded, adding two pinches of salt, the stew was still a bit tastele—
“Stop, stop,” he said, as tears started wetting his lashes. “I thought maybe with the word please it would have changed the force, I don’t know.”
, after years of calling him
“Oh, c'mon Malfoy, don’t be difficult and just answer the fucking questions!”
“With reason! I know, Potter, I know! That’s why I took it. But I can be honest without it too. I’m afraid you’ll have to trust my word then, though.”
Harry sighed and re-opened his eyes. Ginny was staring at him, wide-eyed. She didn’t seem inclined to really talk.
“I didn’t hear you.”
“Draco…” Harry’s worried voice slowly became clearer until Draco opened his eyes to see Harry crouched next to him, softly caressing his hair.
Now, Harry's entire face heated up, while he heard Hermione snorting behind them and Ron whispering something that sounded too much like 'busted'.
Malfoy almost dropped the flask, looking scandalised. “What! Why? How? Why didn’t you— ”
Draco couldn’t believe his ears. What the fuck? His throat dried, but he tried anyway, “I don’t…” The portrait kept on:
Potter hummed next to Draco, leaning in to whisper into Draco’s ear. “You still want to marry them if you find them?”
“Head Auror Potter, so serious, look at you now.” Malfoy jerked his head up, looking into Harry’s face. The feather slowed to almost stilling.
So. Fucking. Slowly.
Mr Serkin stopped, startled from the sound of Potter’s graceless fall. Weasley was helping him get up — laughing as he did — while Granger probably scolded him, judging by the look of disapproval that crossed her face.
“Charity Auction. I’m giving away the Manor along with other minor magical objects for beneficence.”
It had been Malfoy’s turn and he had been dared to snog Nott. Harry had watched as their lips had collided, pecking at first, then more and more rough — Draco had grasped Nott’s hips, pulled him onto his lap, and they’d started to rut against each other.
The anger was dangerously coming to the surface again, Harry could feel it in the magic now tingling on his skin. “Tell me why, dear Merlin, why you stepped on my face on the Hogwarts Express, instead of reaching out for help.”
There's always something weird in watching someone sleeping, as if intruding in a private moment. Surely Malfoy looked like the kind of person who didn't sleep in public, and here he was, his hair rumpled, cheeks and nose red, lips slightly parted emitting gentle puffs of air.
Moreover, Draco hoped that leaving their ladies waiting for them half an hour would spur them into drinking some wine and therefore, they would be at least a bit tipsy before hearing their news.
Mrs Darsley chuckled, startling them both. “So salty! I like you, Harry. You remind me of my big love; she was such a brilliant girl, you know? But the temper. Wow, she was easily inflamed, let me tell you. But I loved her… and you two remind me of us.”
Harry and Malfoy were walking a couple of steps behind Hermione, both busy gaping at the inside of the Unspeakable Centre.
Harry turned to find him once again blushing in that weird ghostly way and casting curious looks right and left.
The January air was particularly cold, and as soon as Harry's fingers started feeling numb and condensation formed on his glasses, he cast a weather charm, that wrapped around him, warming his body and unfogging his lenses. He turned to look smugly at Malfoy, who looked back at Harry with raised eyebrows and perfectly cool skin, unbothered by the cold air.
"Why are you so red in the face? Are you sick?" Boo-boo asked, trying to put his little transparent hand on Harry's forehead and frowning when it passed through.
Harry nodded, unable to hide his disappointment.
“Harry! Draco! What are you doing here already? We didn’t expect you for another eleven hours.”
“Shouldn’t we just go to sleep? It’s late…”
“Malfoy—”
“What?” Malfoy’s forehead creased even more. Harry couldn’t believe how easily he was falling for the spoiled brat already.
I’m merely keeping in touch with him to be sure he's not up to something."
“Their what?”
“Do you think he’ll ask me to wear his shoes to enlarge them, so they won’t hurt his feet?”
Harry hadn’t slept that night. He was sick of Draco’s negativity. They’d be back home, eventually, Harry was sure of it.
“What did he say?”
Draco answered from the floor, barely keeping his happiness out of his voice. “I know, I’m sorry, Harry. I just… forgot some things I used to do as a kid, you know? You grow up and leave some stuff behind.” He turned and started touching the walls, his hands quickly roaming on the wood, searching behind the drawings.
He didn’t remember going to sleep in his bedroom last night. He was on the couch with Potter.
He waved his hand and something that looked like a protective charm wrapped their bodies, shielding them from being hurt by external objects. "Better?"
By the time he got back to their tree, Malfoy was awake and doing… yoga on the grass.
Ron’s eyebrows lifted as he chuckled, a hand still resting on the handle of the door. “You weren’t thinking about whom?”
James was breathing calmer now, his attention fully drawn to Harry; Albus lightly patted his shoulder and Lily kissed Ginny’s temple. Harry had no idea what else to say to his children — it wasn’t like they should know everything like he owed Ginny.
Harry heard Malfoy draw in a deep breath and a moment later, he appeared in front of Harry, sitting on the rug at Harry’s feet, fixing him with what looked like fury in his eyes.
Malfoy sighed and brought himself into the centre of the circle, a scornful expression on his face. “Well, hurry up, Potter, I don’t have all night.”
Hermione chuckled, fidgeting with another pen. “As if. You know what I mean, Draco.”
Harry giggled too, some nervousness coming back to him. “Oh yes, we’ll do that. But… well, you know how fights go with us. We’ll fight and then we’ll fuck and it will be scorchingly hot, and then we’ll fight again, and we’ll have sex again, and again, and again."
"Someone cast an illegal bond on me, didn't they?"
“If you stop now I’m gonna have to kill you.” He doesn’t open his eyes, but his voice is steady.
The three of them snorted at the same time and Scorpius grabbed his phone from the pocket of his jeans. “I shall do it. Merlin, this is weird stuff. When did we become the protagonists of a tv show?” He shook his head, sticking out his tongue at Draco.
You both need to relax. You lean in closer to whisper in his ear: “Such a slut, Potter, and your small, tight hole can’t take me?”
Draco pinched Harry on the arm. “Idiot! It’s not our tastes, oh Merlin! He’s just being stupid!” Draco took another worried look at the incriminating dildo.
Malfoy nodded, expression serious as if he was really understanding, as if Harry’s words really made any kind of sense. “Would you like me to keep reading you that book I found yesterday?”
Draco beamed, happy they had that settled. As he took another forkful of cous-cous, Draco narrowed his eyes at Ron. He was definitely taking too long to swallow his wine and Draco didn’t really want Ron’s stuttering love words for Pansy to spoil his dessert. Draco cleared his throat, waving a hand towards him. “Spill the beans, Ron.”
“Merlin, we really aren’t young boys anymore, are we?”
“Good morning, Theo,” Draco replies dryly. “No, we didn’t…well, yes, um. We had... sexual intercourse, okay?”
“I’ll make you come like this,” he breathes hotly against your sensitive skin. You cry out— yes, he definitely will.
hard.
. My skin prickles, and... and my chest is so damn tight!”
“Hi, Draco Malfoy.” Potter held out a hand. For Draco. To shake.
Draco set the flute on the table, and turned to head toward Potter, who had disappeared. Everywhere he looked was Potter-empty. Scowling, he decided to seek out Bill and Fleur anyways to say hi and he’d get the opportunity to talk with Hermione too, as she had joined them now.
Draco watched his movements, drawn to the wet sounds of Potter’s tongue against his own lips. Merlin, he was completely fucked. The erection he had painstakingly subsided came back with full strength, tenting his pyjama bottoms.
, but he also needed the fresh air and time to himself.
"Dream about me often, do you, Potter?" Malfoy's raised eyebrow was the last proof Harry needed — definitely awake.
“Neat.”
“Clear that smug face, Potter. It was just plain luck, like your entire life’s always been. And I don’t know if your brilliant mind knows it, but turtles don’t have babies, they carry eggs, you git.” Draco waved a hand off, dismissing the conversation, frantically scanning in his head for all the options he had right now.
With Teddy laughing in his arms, Harry kneeled next to Malfoy and tried to smile at him. If he could be civil, Harry certainly couldn’t be any less.
?” He asked with a trembling voice.
Boo-boo suddenly stopped, his face going back to a blank expression.
Draco’s mouth quirked into a half-smile before he could realise how much it hurt to have Potter there, casually mentioning a time when they used to tease each other as a sign of love.
“Indeed.”
“What more could there possibly be?”
Malfoy.
“Well, they took completely different choices and they both regretted some of them. They faced evil and, in the end, they both survived. They are scarred now, they have suffered and lost loved ones… and after all this, they met again. From the ashes of their past, they met and slowly started to rebuild, to make good from it. And…”
“Look, Draco, I know that—” Pansy huffed before continuing. “I’m just gonna say it. I know you’re afraid because you think that Potter’s going to wake up one day and realise you’re
“What are you thinking about?”
rains here! And—”
Eight months in, that had become a routine, too. They bought some dildos and plugs and played around with them. One memorable time, Draco had magically affixed the dildo onto the bed and bounced on it while Harry watched, cock in hand. Nothing was anything near satisfying — Harry needed more, needed to kiss those rosy lips, to lick Draco’s tantalising neck, touch his pert arse, bury himself into him.
,” looking at your arm. He lets go of your arm, leans in to whisper, “I said ruin me, Malfoy.”
Feeling his cheeks grow hot under the implications of Malfoy's question, Harry averted his eyes from him, and looked around himself in time to see Hermione and Ron bursting into the room with what looked like a medi-witch.
Draco looked into the eyes of the love of his life, knowing right now, right here, he wanted to stay with him for the rest of his life. “The ring…” he murmured and without letting Harry reply, took it out of his pocket.
By the time he reached the bedroom, Draco was naked too. Harry was sitting in the middle of the bed, a bowl of whipped cream in his hands.
“I wanna know everything,” he whispered. “What did you feel? Did you feel it?”
Malfoy shakes his head. “I’m just so fucking full. I can’t get enough, I can’t—
In the worst case scenario, they would stay trapped in that past timeline for too long; they would need money, a place to stay, some food…
“I do,” Draco whispered. “I love him. And we had this rule when we first started, you know… fucking, that if either of us had feelings for the other we would stop.”
“You like to live dangerously, don’t you, Malfoy?” Potter talked slowly, his hot breath ghosting over Draco’s aching erection, which was throbbing towards Potter’s lips, so close yet so far.
“She’s right,” Parkinson interfered. “And you know, Potter, Seamus is entitled to three more questions now.”
Harry was his friend, the boy next door, the one who cooked breakfast for Draco and smiled at Draco’s moans whenever he ate delicious food.
Yeah, Harry supposed he did. So he went to find Malfoy with a somewhat lighter and heavier heart at the same time. He was in the garden, sitting on the grass, his head tilted to the sky. A lit cigarette lay untouched between his fingers.
“Twenty-seven years.”
He turned to see Malfoy shaking his head along with him.
They stared at each other in silence for a few seconds, their thoughts reflected in their eyes, not daring to give them voice. Taking a step forward, Draco moved closer to Harry. “I’d like to help you, but I think I need to recover a bit more before.”
Draco practically ran to Harry, pinning him against the wall of the room, latching his mouth to every visible part of Harry’s body — his mouth, his ear, his neck, his collarbone. Harry sighed into the kiss, opening his mouth, capturing Draco’s bottom lip between his teeth till it bled, arching his back to rut against Draco’s thigh shoved between his legs.
Harry finally caught up with their argument, excitement filling him.
. This was absurdly fucked up. Harry’s jaw slackened and he couldn’t think of a single thing— a single
Harry was eighteen-and-a-half when it happened. He couldn’t forget it.
“Tell me,” he whispered on Harry’s neck, massaging the spot he had hit on his arse  cheek, “Tell me what we did that night.”
Harry wanted more.
“Harry, you’re gonna inflict yourself with a heart attack!”
“But I may say something to cheer you up,” Draco started again, his voice suddenly low. “What if… we try with penetration?”
Draco levelled his shoulders, cocking his head toward Hermione.
“Let me,” Draco groaned as he lubed his own hand and pushed a finger in, leaning his body down, tilting his head towards Harry’s and crashing their lips together. As soon as he was in, Harry’s muscles tightened around his finger, warm and inviting and Draco couldn’t think anymore.
He felt Malfoy softly giggling on his chest and then kissing somewhere at Harry’s ribs, he had no idea, he only craved for that mouth to go lower and lower, until he felt Malfoy's hand grasp his pants and tugging.
Draco’s eyes widened abnormally before a thought occurred to him. He quickly regained his composure, raising an eyebrow at Ron. “I didn’t know I was your type, Weasley.”
“It means that whatever we’re doing in this time-travel, our interactions with the Muggles we meet and work with, our wanderings through the city, everything we say and do without even realising it, we’re leaving an impact, we’re leaving something behind. Something our past selves already lived.”
what this bond does?!"
. Did you tell him about your magic? That’s why he said you’re courageous?”
“No. I told you not to take the Veritaserum, because I don’t trust you to not use Occlumency to shield it, Malfoy. I don’t trust you.”
“Oooh, I asked you if you think Bill and Fleur will be elegant as their usual tonight.”
The fifteen-year-old Harry and Draco were fighting, fists and insults flying everywhere.
The feather’s touch was gone but Harry laughed again, just because yes— Malfoy was right.
As everyone waved their goodbyes, Hermione called Potter over to tell him something private. As Potter bent down to listen to whatever Hermione was telling him, he glanced at Draco, smirking. Potter slid his tongue over his upper lip in a clear invitation to Draco.
Harry stood up abruptly, running to their hotel, noticing distractedly the sun was already down and hoping to find both Boo-boo and Draco back there. He stepped through the atrium dripping water all around himself, a little puddle already forming at his feet. He cast an apologising gaze to the receptionist who shrugged and went back to her duties.
He stood up on unstable legs, forgetting about their friends, about how that long time ago, Malfoy and he had sworn they’d never tell anyone what had happened. With a trembling voice, he shouted, “You
you want to reply. You take a deep breath, instead.
“I’ll tell you,” Draco said slowly, “what would happen if we were to do the imbecility that you just suggested. What would happen is we would
“Right! The ball! I have to go, sorry. See you inside, Potter.” Draco dragged Pansy out of Potter’s reach, walking quickly, only glancing backwards once and catching Potter picking the flowers out of his hair one after the other with a half-smile on his face.
Draco looked into Harry's eyes, a mix of pride and envy at how easy magic came to Harry in every situation. He smirked and pulled his fingers all the way out Harry's arse.
“Ok! I have this! You order the pizza and I’ll go to the bathroom—”
"We need to go there as fast as we can! Boo-boo, damn, where is he?"
“Something went wrong yesterday, though.” Ron picked it up from Malfoy, as Harry kept staring into the void, thinking
had just been cast on them all. Mr Serkin seemed as baffled as everyone else by the offer, his eyes wide, jaw opening and closing multiple times, and he completely forgot to ask if there were other offers. As if anyone else would dare to bid on something that one of the Saviours of the Wizarding World wanted.
"We're here." Hermione announced, tearing Harry away from his thoughts, and unlocking a metallic door with a wordless spell, signalling to Harry and Malfoy to follow her inside.
Malfoy’s eyes bore into Harry’s, focused. “Let’s say I want to be magnanimous tonight,” Malfoy said, voice steady, calm—
Harry felt Malfoy's magic flowing over him, steadying him on his chair as Malfoy got up and rushed to their room. Barely a minute later, he was back and poured the potion in Harry's coffee; gulping it, Harry could finally see clearly again.
He looked over to Draco, who was looking at him with apprehension written all over his face. Harry exhaled slowly and turned to Boo-boo.
How would he know?! Seriously, what’s up with you and time travel?!" Malfoy's eyebrows were knitted together, his eyes quickly darting from one to the other.
Potter was already messing with his head and they hadn’t even had a proper conversation yet. Why was he here? How long would he be around?
“Yeah,” he sighed, casting a discreet freshening breath charm on himself. “Malfoy, what are you doing ordering Kreacher around in my house?”
Draco had leaned back, looking into Harry’s eyes, the tip of his ears reddened. “That potion… it makes me sleep but it also makes me
kicked up a fuss.
“Fuck!” Harry cried out, his eyes widening to the point of pain, trying to stay still, but he knew he’d never resist. Malfoy snickered against Harry’s skin, and blew some more air over the wet patches he left, and the feather was now brushing against Harry’s neck—
He spreads your thighs, vanishes your joggers. “Hey, I liked them!” you faintly protest.
“Sing love songs? Oh, dear Circe, no. Why should I? Are you two in love? Draco, you didn’t tell me you found a boyfriend!”
exactly Malfoy had felt like this. Harry certainly hadn’t noticed. Malfoy had been so self-possessed, even when Harry had started to get annoyed and directly grasped Malfoy’s hard-on under the table.
“Harry,” she called out softly. Harry turned. “Remember what the Healers told you, two years ago?”
Draco thought about Apparating, but then the possibility of Splinching himself wasn’t appealing. Even only a pint of beer was enough to tip Draco over the edge. He turned right and started walking, the frozen leaves on the streets cracking audibly under his shoes.
while his cock cried
"I'm afraid I wasn’t too clear with you, Harry, but this kind of bond requires constant touch. Constant touch
"Today I saw Malfoy in Diagon Alley. He didn't even stop to say hi. What does he think, he's better than me? Always the same spoiled brat."
"Oh Merlin, what— what will I do when the potions are gone? I don’t have that many more… I-I…"
Boring. Boring and annoying. And boring. Good lord, was it even normal that Draco couldn’t have any fun at the pub if he couldn’t encourage Potter’s jealousy by flirting with random blokes?
"Why is he here? He's not a healer."
And if Draco had been happy for Pansy’s appearance just when he was beginning to fear he’d have to invent some weird excuses to run to the loo, he was hating her now. Even though, considering the soft blush that again covered Potter’s face and his embarrassed smile, he could reconsider that.
"Malfoy and I!" Harry entered the kitchen, landed a kiss on Hermione's cheek, and clasped Ron's shoulder.
“I-I don’t know… someone I haven’t seen in five years and I don’t know anything about anymore.”
It’s Halloween. You’ve never really loved it; apparently, Potter doesn’t either. He finds you sitting by a small river deep inside the Forbidden Forest.
And really, Draco could be such a drama queen sometimes. So, Harry thought of breaking the tension with a little innocent joke.
"Help for
Draco Malfoy
Draco felt himself blushing and smiled shyly. “I wanted to fuck you,” he said, disappointed.
She probably should have warned them about what she’d tell her colleague, and that got Harry thinking about what the hell she would say about him, cold sweat already forming at the base of his neck. He wasn't good at lying and he had a scar on his hand always there to remind him.
“Just wait for us here, will you? We’ll fix this in no time.” And just like that, they were gone.
‘This is the year I lose my virginity’ is as good a way as any other to start a new school year.
Malfoy looked at him. Nodded.
Harry looked at him with wide eyes, thinking of all the possible replies he could give Draco without getting him mad. In the end, he went with, “I’m… sorry?”
“Oh, damn, sorry Malfoy, you may talk.”
“Disgusting,” Draco whispered, his breathing difficult all of a sudden.
Scanning the room for his clothes, he detected them in a tangled ball on the floor near the door.
, and asking the receptionist for a room for two.
towards your master? Because in that case I—”
"Well, I guess the git has a bloody beautiful smile, mate." Ron snickered next to Hermione, glancing at Malfoy's picture.
, efforts, warm room, posh bathrooms…”
Malfoy's already puzzled expression deepened, as Harry tried to understand the meaning of her words. Hermione was an Unspeakable, was she trying to imply that—
He sat up straight now, not without difficulties. Ginny was right. He smiled at her, trying to look confident. “I’m fine, but thank you for caring, still.”
As they chatted about Potter's hideous choice of clothing — a lime green t-shirt with 'Lady Luck' written in purple block letters — they reached the cafe, which consisted in an open counter on the beach with large speakers for the music and no closing hour.
Their gazes locked and Harry could feel his face burn with lust, could see Malfoy’s cheeky smile, how he’d licked his lips looking right into Harry’s eyes.
Harry’s entire body shuddered and he had gripped Draco’s hips hard, pulling him to his chest.
Boo-boo hummed, narrowing his eyes at Harry. "But your order for him is so precise."
, why was his shirt poking out of his trousers? Wasn’t he able to tuck it correctly? Did he need help for it? … Oh
Harry snorted, taking Draco’s hands in his, stopping him from redressing and cast a warming charm around the two of them. He conjured a blanket, slowly dragging Draco down onto it with him.
“Girls, you don’t have to help us. We know we fucked up and — ”
— that got them a raised eyebrow from their wives, Draco and Harry could finally Disapparate back home. After everything that happened, Ginevra and Astoria were still living at the beach house to take some time for themselves and Draco and Harry would stay at Harry’s place during the weekends.
that I’m in, er, love with Potter.” Draco poured some more wine into his glass. If he was seeing Potter tonight, it really wasn’t advisable to keep drinking like this, but he didn’t dare broach the Potter topic while sober.
As soon as Harry unlocked the wards and stepped foot in Grimmauld Place, confused shouting and yelling reached his ears.
“Christ.” Harry whistled, threading a hand through his hair. “I won’t… of course we won’t—”
“Harry!” Ron elbowed Harry next to him. “Oi! Earth to Harry! Are you still with us?”
Draco blinked, hesitating as he reached for his second slice of cake. The world was running upside down if Ronald Weasley had affection in his tone when talking about Draco Malfoy.
it. Alright? I just wanted to tell you because I do need to knot someone. Sometimes the need is stronger and…”
Teddy turned his head to Harry too, and his hair became almost black as he stretched his hands towards him. “Up!”
’d Pansy’s magazine. He was halfway through it, still dutifully avoiding the poll —someone should really compliment him for his self-control— when he came upon a paparazzo’s picture of Potter entering a library. The caption read: “Will Harry Potter’s book ever see the light of day?”
“I was... jealous,” Malfoy continued. “You and your Gryffindor friends, your Gryffindor adventures, and, um...”
They barely had time to cast a quick
Hermione’s eyes widened briefly before she rolled her eyes. “No need to get ridiculous, Draco. Okay, yes, I was messing with you. Everything’s fine, they fixed it. Some idiot cast a Sticking Charm to all the doors of the lifts and—”
"Potter, you idiot! C’mon, what are you, twelve years old? We are here because you are
Harry wiped the few tears stuck in his lashes, feeling a weight sitting on his chest. He knew all too well what being abandoned felt like.
The first time they’d done this, it was by accident, and Harry wondered just how many things in his life could happen like that, by accident.
“Hey! I was—”
Draco took a deep breath as the song of the wooden canary reverberated through the walls. It was six o’clock, time to start. Smiling as widely as he could, Draco cleared his throat and hoped his voice wouldn’t crack. “Welcome, witches and wizards of London. I am glad to see so many of you decided to participate in my Charity Auction. After the War, I had a hard time. I know what you’re thinking: I deserved it, the entire Malfoy family deserved it. Nonetheless, I felt wrecked, I thought I didn’t deserve to exit these walls again.” Draco inhaled slowly, trying to maintain his smile intact. “But it was a foolish thought. I understood that I needed to do something to change my situation and show you all I wanted to change, that… I
“But above all, I love the taste of your skin.” Potter’s tongue finally found Draco’s lips, still stained with chocolate. Draco closed his eyes, groans escaping him as Potter traced their outline with a long, slow lick, his breaths mingling with Potter’s own.
“Good boy. Use it if it’s too much, okay?”
“Mmmh.” You peek into the bag, a dangerous smile forming on your face. “Is this for you or for me?” you ask, lifting a brow at him.
Harry just shook his head, his eyes drifting off towards the miles of green behind Draco.
Draco let himself be held, forgetting about his ruined plans for a moment. If anything had happened to Harry…fuck. He wanted to say something, something about how much he hated that stupid job of Harry’s, but he refrained. They’d had that conversation one too many times already.
That wasn’t supposed to happen. Everything had been magically set up for the occasion, checked several times by curse-breakers and the organisers of the event. Portraits were supposed to stick to the wall.
Harry nodded solemnly. “A very sensible conclusion. I have one of my own.” At Draco’s raised eyebrows, he said, smirk back in place, “You have a great imagination, love.”
"A trip?!" Boo-boo exclaimed, his resounding voice excited. "Can I come?"
Sweat formed on his upper lip and his breathing looked more laboured. When he started again, his voice was strained. “
“Stop playing with the ocean water, Harry, you’re not Triton!”
becoming a problem. I’ve spent more time than normal at the infirmary, but it wasn’t just for Quidditch-related injuries or, you know, Voldemort-related things. I would lick everything, even— well, once, at Potions, I licked moonstone powder and apparently it’s poisonous if it’s not brewed in a potion, and so—”
For a moment, it looked like the moon shone brighter because Malfoy’s eyes glossed over and he sank his teeth into his bottom lip.
. All he did to acknowledge Harry at all was looking at him with an imperceptibly raised eyebrow.
“Shit, shit, shit, shit!” They were in the corridor just before the ballroom again, a few feet from Mrs Darsley’s portrait.
Malfoy snorted and Harry glared at him. “I’m serious. I don’t want to risk anything. First of all, we need to understand what is an order and what is not and how much you can or can’t resist it.”
“Dad, your hair is just fine. Have you seen the mess of Harry’s hair? Don’t listen to him, he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. You’re handsome and if you have some grey hair then you’ll simply look sexier.”
"Black really doesn't suit him, don't you think? He looks even paler than a ghost, ahah!"
Draco stepped back, taking deep breaths. Harry opened his eyes: Draco’s smile mismatched the tears streaming down his face.
Malfoy turns his head to look at Harry. He’s at a weird angle, his hair is all plastered to his forehead, and he’s panting. He’s never been this beautiful.
Potter’s hand came to rest on the small of Draco’s back, hot and steady against his shirt.
Followed by Seamus’ reply.
Harry closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. Whether Malfoy knew or not, Harry recognised his firm voice and his cock throbbed in his pants. He’d never disobey Malfoy.
Draco huffed; his anxiety was starting to nudge at him again. Inhaling through the fresh breeze of the evening, he spat, “And I am sure you shouldn’t be here, nor anywhere near me. Why, mh, why Potter are you here? Why can’t you leave me alone? Why did you testify at my trial? Why did you save me in the Room of Requirement?!”
When the waitress walked away, Harry felt Malfoy's eyes burn a hole in his face and then Boo-boo asked the worst possible thing.
He understood very soon that the “marriage with a pureblood girl and three-kids-life” wasn’t what he wanted— no matter how strong his desire to satisfy his father’s wishes. Draco was gay and he had always known.
“So gorgeous,” Malfoy murmured. Sometimes Harry wondered if he realised the things he said to Harry in these moments— but of course, he did. Malfoy never left anything to chance.
Sneaking a glance one last time towards Potter, he found him smiling, absent-mindedly scratching his stubble. Great Salazar, didn’t he have the time to shave like a normal human being?
back to life, he has been able since he was sixteen years old, impressive, mh?"
Now, you push two fingers into Potter’s hole: he cries out; one hand flies to grasp your hair. His hole is so tight you almost come in your pants as his muscles spasm around your fingers.
On Saturday, Draco didn’t even let Potter speak first when he entered in a lavender sundress. “What the heck are you wearing, Potter? And don’t even start again, Lady Luck is perfectly healthy!”
of working for our Hero's well-being and that gives me some privileges."
“Fuck, yes, keep— keep giving me orders, I—” Malfoy whimpered, a string of pre-cum dropping down on the rug. Harry couldn’t believe the turn the day was having.
“That’s an, uh, interesting piece, Harry.” Gary looked at Harry’s vase with raised eyebrows, his nose scrunched. Harry had been commissioned an hourglass vase by Hermione’s colleague after he finalised a way to get quick glimpses into people’s futures.
“Fuck, it sounds so beautiful in your mouth. I had forgotten…”
Malfoy's office was exactly how Harry had imagined.
"Shut up!" Boo-boo shouted and zigzagged far from them, flying away, helped by the cold wind of that January morning, quickly disappearing from their sight.
, is all.”
The door burst open and Draco jumped out of his chair, crying, “I wasn’t thinking about him!”
The realisation left him gasping for breath. Pansy smiled, crooking her head, as if to say ‘I’m here, it’s okay’. Draco blinked, then blinked some more, before finally breathing again.
It didn’t even work when Harry tried to rim Malfoy. Harry really preferred to get rimmed, but he figured it was worth a try. After all, it was what would always make Harry come without even needing so much as to touch his cock.
Draco was about to cast a drying charm and redress, angrily muttering under his breath. “
Malfoy finally slipped out of Harry, this time delicately guiding him to turn so they faced each other. His hand was still tangled in Harry’s hair. “It is. Look, this was… just sort of— sort of fucked up.” He swallowed audibly. “That’s why we can’t do this again. This is the first and last time.”
Talk.
Harry was pacing nervously in the bedroom, looking at Draco’s sleeping form resting on the bed. He looked calm, his breathing deep, lips slightly parted.
Harry grasped the items from Hermione’s outstretched hands and snorted. “It’s not a problem, thanks ‘Mione!”
"Cute? Cute! Malfoys aren't cute…"
"Have you seen Malfoy on the cover of
“I desire you, honey,” he whispered, each word causing a spark through Harry’s body, raising goosebumps on his skin.
He’d make sure to brew more and more.
. The look of someone who knows what they want and how to obtain it.
“What does that mean
Harry’s eyebrows knitted together. “What do you mean?”
“Have mercy, for fuck’s sake.” Malfoy had been so breathless his complaints weren’t holding any strength. His cock had swelled slowly, but oh so beautifully, red, sticky, vein throbbing.
Harry threw his head back against the pillow, trying to gather his thoughts. He’d never be able to stay still, but he could shut his mouth.
Because Harry hadn’t felt it. He had grown wings on his back and talons on his hands while something positively
A stag firework burst forth, together with a dragon one.
Harry laughed, looking at Malfoy in a navy blue hood scowling at people passing by. There was something about this, the two of them together, sharing little moments of their daily life that warmed Harry's heart.
Harry huffed as his supposed best friends kept laughing and sending silly messages on their chat. Why couldn’t he learn to just shut his mouth?
“I lit the candles, yes, it can work.”
^^^^^
“Draco, darling, we know you are gay!” Mrs Darsley’s voice came from her portrait and Draco’s head whipped to it, a horrified look on his face.
Harry smirked, approaching Draco again, getting impossibly close and still too far away. “You
“Pansy’s the one who made such a big deal out of them, involving the entire Wizarding world in the research!”
Harry itched to take him into his arms and wrap him in a tight hug, his chest feeling tight all of a sudden. His eyes watered and his voice broke when he spoke.
They snorted together, eyes locked. Draco held his breath before slowly replying. "Maybe Lady Luck has something in store for us after all. Speaking of which… what's wrong with her?"
His eyes were dark, intent on Harry.
Draco’s blinking rapidly, his breathing laboured. “Oh. Did the Confundus go away?”
“Why, Malfoy, someone’s greedy.” Zabini snickered from his place next to Pansy, moving his hands to form a heart with his fingers.
“Your cock,” he rasps. “Want it. Inside me, now.”
Harry wondered when he started noticing such things, when he got to know Malfoy so well.
“So, um...” When Hermione cleared her throat, Draco raised his head to look at her. She continued. “Right. So, Ronald… he fancies Pansy, doesn’t he?”
Draco was handling last minute flower-related issues, together with Pansy who was talking with one of the waiters, when he heard the sound of faltering steps approaching behind him and he knew it was Blaise before seeing him. He had started limping two years prior, due to an injury he got during his work as a curse-breaker. “That one time,” Blaise always ranted, a hand on his forehead, “I thought I was gonna die. The Dragon got scared by our spells and—” Draco knew the entire story by heart, thanks to all the time they had shared when curse-breakers from all around England came to eradicate the Dark Magic in the Manor. A show-off, in Draco’s opinion.
Draco crossed his arms at his chest, faking offence at his best friends mocking him. His blush intensified, extending to the tips of his ears, his neck and collarbone. “Will you shut up???”
As soon as Scorpius saw Draco, his eyebrows wrinkled, and his lips tightened. “Is this true?”
Malfoy glared at Harry. But the effect was ruined when all through his little speech and angry gestures his face had turned blotchy red, which it only did when he was embarrassed.
"Hola, erm, amigo."
“Yes, Harry, yes! Unhygienic! And gross, and not to mention dirty, and—”
Incident II was born.
When Harry finally finds Draco and Goyle at the shore of the Black Lake they look like they’re having a fight and Harry’s not sure how to approach them.
"He said he arranged a meeting with the Greengrass family."
It’s not a question. Your cock is now fully, achingly hard. Sex with a stranger in a pub bathroom sounds dirty; sex with Potter in a pub bathroom only sounds dangerous.
Ron blinked, staring dumbstruck at Harry until his eyebrows shot upwards, his eyes growing wider. "You mean, like I suggested more than
“Are those… peacocks? What are they doing? Don’t they sleep at this hour?”
She sighed deeply. “Because… I am heartbroken.”
Harry pointed at his overstuffed trunk on the bed next to him when Malfoy went on. “Right. Once back home, for everything regarding your medical conditions, you’ll keep in touch with Alicia and her team here at St. Mungo’s; while I’ll only take care of your bonding situation. I have some ideas to start working on, so meet me in my office tomorrow morning at 9 am?”
“Not even the beginning.” The second Malfoy was undressing himself, climbing the bed right next to his Malfoy. Harry realised he had no idea anymore who was the real one.
"It shouldn't look like this. Something went wrong when Jacob cast it, and that's the reason why he disappeared."
“Mmmh,” Draco murmured, inhaling deeply. “Can you smell the scent of freshly cut tomatoes mingled with garlic and basil? This—” He gestured with a hand around the restaurant, finally pointing to the dishes on their table. Pansy rolled her eyes. “
In response, Malfoy had grunted, shifting on the sheets, hands curling into fists. “It-it
You grip his waist harder —you’re sure you’re going to leave some nasty bruises there— and push all the way in, holding your breath. He’s holding his too, stomach taught, hole clenched.
"Do you know what this is?"
Pansy folded the piece of paper, still smirking. “Why do you care? You already have your knight in shining armour, don’t you?”
A sudden pang in his chest made him double over himself, falling on his knees on the dry grass. People hadn't arrived and still, he could feel the press of their bodies in the same room, the heat emanating from them, the sounds of their chattering…
“But that’s beside the point. When my stomach started reclaiming a normal bacterial flora, I went to see a Healer, Mrs Richmond. She told me cooking could help to focus my energies onto the activity so much I’d forget about licking things. And, well, it worked. The more I cooked, the more I was happy and I stopped being sick all the time. So—”
His own cock was dripping pre-come, throbbing in the air at Malfoy’s words. He lowered a hand to it and took it in his hand, giving a couple of harsh tugs.
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?”
He turned his gaze on Granger again and tried to smile. “Sure, I am very intrigued. Can’t wait to discover more about your project.”
And there it was. The moment Draco was waiting for the entire night. That little detail he had come to know about Potter and couldn’t help but chase every time they were in each other’s presence.
For a moment there was a silence so dense in the room it could be cut with a knife, when Hermione continued her speech again.
was he still here, indeed?
Draco held Potter by his waist, led him on unsteady feet, wavering with alcohol and emotion. Potter's smell, the way he giggled and stomped on Draco's feet with every step, made Draco ache with all the possibilities he turned down when they were nineteen, all the memories flooding back to him.
He kept drinking his firewhiskey, happy to let it flow in his body, helping him free his mind, just enough to forget for an evening who he was, the War he just survived, the horrors he lived. His cock throbbed in his pants every time his gaze crossed Malfoy’s; he remembered all too well what those eyes wanted from him when the grey almost disappeared, replaced by the black of their dilated pupils, sparkling with desire.
“You bloody well did.” Frustration quickly pooling in his chest again, Draco groaned, taking his turn in the safety of Harry’s neck. “Dammit. I need to call the hotel to cancel the reservation before it’s too late.”
He whined and pressed Harry’s face impossibly closer. “
Draco?!"
“What do you mean orders keep them alive? Christ, this… sucks.”
The kettle whistled and Draco went to turn off the cookers. He poured himself a cup. His mind was lost in his memories, memories of Harry, memories of lost time, of lost opportunities.
Hermione sighed loudly before speaking again. "Send me your position, we'll come fetch you."
Harry straightened from under the desk, smoothing his hands down his uniform. The cheerful feeling was still lodged in his chest.
“Err,” Draco said, feeling his cheeks heat up. “Nothing. I, um... what are you doing here?”
Harry’s sight blurred and he threw his head back, his mouth opening in a silent gasp, his stomach clenching. The feeling of Malfoy’s tongue on his cock was almost unbearable and his hands itched to move and grasp Malfoy’s hair, urging him to take his cock finally.
“Female? With babies! I need to find another name!”
“Mmh,” he murmured, sounding satisfied. “God, Malfoy, I’d lick your spunk any hour of the day.”
“Ouch, stop doing that!”
“Or!” Harry’s voice raised, his hands now balling into fists at his sides. “Why you chose to cast the
At some point, Harry must have put away the toffee apple because all Draco could taste now was Harry’s mouth, sliding hot and wet against Draco’s; Draco could still feel his lips tingle, sticky with sugar. He was utterly lost in the sensations that were assaulting him, his cock throbbing against Harry’s thigh, smearing it with the residue of the cream.
“As a matter of fact,” you say, leaning against the counter, “yes, I do.”
The idea of having twice of what he usually had started to implant itself in his mind. If his orgasms were already so strong with one Malfoy, how would it be with two?
Not only that. Since the spell went wrong, you can't do any of those things with
Malfoy’s face was a funny mix of shock and amusement. Harry didn’t resist and burst out laughing.
“At least give us the juicy tidbits!”
Harry was already lost in the pleasure that sparked from every thrust of Malfoy’s finger, already followed by a second one. He laid his forehead on the wall and murmured, “I only had you, only you, Draco. After the War, I-I was with Ginny, and then… One date, but… no one was you, no one
Harry pushed his hips down again with a hand and murmured against his chest, “You seem like you want to try that dildo. In fact, I’d love to see your reaction to it.”
He only needed to be himself, and everything would be all right. Giving himself a firm nod in the mirror, he decided he wouldn’t rehearse a speech, either. At times, Draco wasn’t sure he still had one, but Pansy always went on and on about listening to one’s heart, and this would be the perfect moment to listen to his.
For the dinner, big round tables had been adorned in red and gold – bloody Gryffindor colours. ‘I already explained to you,’ the catering chief had said after the thousandth time Draco complained about them, ‘that red is the colour of energy, passion; something that you must convey on such an occasion. And gold is luxury, is associated with liberation, opening up to others. They are just the perfect colours for your auction, Draco.’ In the end, he resigned to their recommendation and agreed to use the colours.
“Order,” Malfoy gritted out, then clamped his lips shut as if he hadn’t wanted to say it. “Don’t ask, formulate it as an order, please.”
Before Harry could decide to stand up and open the bloody door— even only to stop Kreacher’s babbling— Malfoy spoke again. “Actually,” he said, voice faltering slightly, “don’t bother with breakfast at all. Thank you anyway.”
“Yesyesyes, so good, so good, unf, more, more,
He rose a bit, leaning on his knees, and Malfoy took the hint, starting to fuck him at a rough pace, soon finding Harr’s sweet spot.
.” He chokes on his words, crosses his ankles around Harry’s waist.
his arse!
“It’s complicated. We don’t know much about the spell yet,” Ron said, scrunching up his nose in an apologetic gesture. “I need to leave now. Malfoy can fill you in on the rest. I wanted to be here to tell you we’ll work on this as hard as we can.” Ron stood up, patted Harry’s shoulder and reached the fireplace. “See you soon.”
"Wow. So now, you were finally able to fix my hair and I taught you to eat Muggle food. We've come a long way, haven't we?"
“Here he is, the traitor.” She had stopped, her hands full of flour and what seemed to be chocolate. “Do you have any idea how mortifying this is, Harry?”
Harry’s hands tightened around the wrapping of Teddy’s present and his eyes snapped to Andromeda. She was apparently concentrated on knitting some sort of coloured scarf and wasn’t paying attention to the fact that a former Death Eater happened to be in her house.
Hermione texted him that night to check on him. She had turned her old scholar self in an attempt to give him reassurances, hypothesising Jacob as a deluded fan in love with
“That was fucking hot,” Harry said, bringing Malfoy’s other ankle up too, unable to keep his hands off Malfoy’s feet. “Do you think…”
They unfolded the piece of paper,
A shift in the protective charms of the Manor made Draco halt, stilling in his stance. Hurried steps rumbled outside the door of the room they were in, becoming louder. Everyone’s attention turned towards the door, and Draco cleared his throat, trying to recall it. “Erm, as I was saying, I th—”
The implications of what happened were heavy, settling into Harry’s soul like a soft caress. This couldn’t be just a coincidence, they were meant to do this time travel; in some way, what they were doing now had already happened, had already been part of their lives. And Draco… of everything Harry discovered about him, knowing he believed in soulmates was the most shocking thing.
You spend all your time at Potter’s place. Your aunt’s place. Whatever. It’s almost like you live there.
Harry rummaged clumsily in his pockets but didn’t find anything more than his wallet and keys, a bill for Ron and Hermione’s Christmas gift, his headphones and… his mobile! Damn right, he had a mobile!
Draco fidgeted with his hands, not knowing what to say. Astoria beat him to it once again and started talking. Her voice was small, trembling, and holding a sadness Draco couldn’t remember ever hearing from her before. “Draco, what have you done. I trusted you. We… thirty-five years, Draco. What have we been for you, all a big lie?”
Harry raised an eyebrow at him and smirked. “Sure, sure, I was just kidding. Also, how thoughtful girls, green and red, like Slytherin and Gryffindor! We are lucky men.”
it away?
The last two years of training spiked in Harry’s blood and he ducked under a desk, hand tight around his wand. He strained his ears, squinting to catch something through the thick smoke in the air.
The only furniture present was a little glass coffee table, a white leather couch, and three white orchids arranged in a vase exactly at the centre of the table, while the big windows let the light seep in, making the ambience warm and welcoming.
“So, you really don’t remember anything about your life?”
Draco sighed, glancing outside to the wide sea of green of his gardens, the stems of flowers gently bending over in the breeze of the evening. He smiled, a little stretch of his lips, against his will: everything seemed to have a different colour with the sun resting behind the mountains.
He looked at Malfoy blushing now for Zabini’s stupid joke and felt his heart shrink in his chest, his head spinning. Without thinking, he brushed his fingers to Malfoy’s hand and brought it to his face, without ever looking away from his silver eyes.
They were just steps from the ballroom, faint notes coming from it, wrapping around them. Potter slid a hand on the small of Draco’s back, mockingly moving two steps with the distant rhythm. “Can I, really? A gift from Malfoy, the Slytherin prince? Wow.”
Next thing he knew, they were all heading towards the Unspeakables building; Harry asking himself exactly when had the world turned upside down.
“Now, now, Mr Malfoy, I wouldn’t use such a term. If it’s true, though, that you won’t make an Unbreakable Vow, you will still need to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement.”
“And anyway, why do we have to share a room?”
“Will you let me?” Harry started, his voice soft, almost a whisper. “Take care of you?”
Ah, the house at the beach.
“You’re babbling, Draco. You never babble. What’s up?”
wet like a duckling. Why am I not surprised?”
A pirouette, two fast steps forward, one backward.
Harry looked at her and then at his friends, who were waving at him and mouthing some greetings. And then he looked at Malfoy.
“Say my name again.”
He unbuttoned his jeans and pushed them down just enough to make his cock jut out, already hard and slick with pre-come. He aligned it with Potter’s hole, moaning at the sight of the pink furled skin fluttering around his cockhead, invitingly so.
Draco looked at Astoria who was nodding furiously. Harry swallowed loudly and Draco decided it was about time he said something. He cleared his throat and tried to sound reasonable. “Girls, we know we fucked up. We don’t have any excuses, but we… I mean, we cheated on you this last year but it’s not like you might think.”
spaghetti hanging from his plate. He loved how simple Sweet Prophecies felt, even though there were some weird and delicious dishes on the menu. “You agree this is the best restaurant in London, though.”
D+H encircled in a heart.
“Kreacher is so happy! A Black in the house, again! Kreacher will cook breakfast for you, sir, just—“
Draco’s eyes were shining when he turned to look at him and Harry ached to take him into his arms, hug him, whispering love words into his ears. Draco looked up at him, his voice broke.
Malfoy’s
They looked at each other and snorted together, Malfoy's cheeks quickly flushing magenta.
"Listen, Harry, I know this sucks. But you heard them, they decided to stay here until Jacob gets better. I'm sure they're still here, damage like this takes months to fix."
“I think you know,” he murmurs in your ear, his hand already palming your growing erection.
Just like that, they had a ‘home’ together. After that chaotic day, they’d moved in together in the wizarding neighbourhood near Draco’s office in a tiny flat where they spent the majority of their time fucking loving each other.
Harry snorted, turning to smile at him. "I'll definitely convert you to Muggle culture. That's a
“Not yet, sweetheart. You don’t want to ruin your birthday gift, do you?”
Draco tried a smile, that probably looked more like the face of someone with a stomach ache. “Depends on what you are referring to.”
“Okay,” replied Harry, flashing him a big smile.
When he was fully seated, Malfoy bit on his shoulder and grabbed his tied hands with one hand. He thrust lightly in and Harry wiggled his hips, the feeling of Malfoy’s cock stretching him making him weak.
Harry reached it on unsteady legs, sighing in relief when he felt his body warmed again, feeling a bit of lucidity coming back to him.
Harry giggled, wiggling his hips again, rubbing his dick inside of Draco. He did the cutest noises when asleep and he was no less when he came, totally incapable of resisting Harry or sending him one of his bratty replies or mischievous smirks.
“Okay…” Harry looked around, only to find himself saying, “um, take off your socks.”
Malfoy cocked his head, his eyes bright. “Now, we travel through time.”
“Malfoy, you do know you’re the one who chose to— oh, whatever. I’m not moving my foot.”
“No! No, no—” Draco tried to stand up, but Harry held him by the waist, locking his fingers at the height of Draco’s belly and pulling him back down—right onto his lap. “Harry, the Portkey! And—and Paris, and—” Harry had cleaned himself up, he realised. Probably with a spell, since his clothes still felt weird to the touch. “What the heck happened?”
“That won’t be necessary, Kreacher, thanks.”
“Me,” he says, looking at your chest. “And
Harry stopped, blinking. “Hey, I needed those!” He snorted and lowered his head, attacking Draco’s nipples with his tongue, licking them and gently taking them between his teeth. Draco gasped and pushed his hips up from the couch, searching some sort of relief against Harry’s body.
am going to be somewhere else when you do!” With that, she stalked off, probably to the kitchen to fix the last things for the brunch.
“Right. Er—” Malfoy tightened his grip on the flask, pouring ten drops into the cauldron. “When I was eight I had an imaginary friend named Harry Potter.” He blinked hard as Harry burst out laughing. Malfoy’s cheeks grew even redder. “Salazar, why the fuck did I say
Harry listened as Malfoy thrust in more forcefully, sliding one hand over his chest to brush his nipple, smashing his ability to think.
When Pansy saw him she narrowed her eyes, not even waiting for him to sit before a reprimand formed on her lips.
He had been so busy bickering with Malfoy that he had completely lost the direction they took and had no idea where they were anymore. Actually, if he tried to recall the steps they took to get here or the corridors they passed, he’d just get a fuzzy image. Throwing a sideways glance at Malfoy, Harry thought he probably felt the same judging by his perplexed expression and the way his head kept turning from right to left.
Just to drop it immediately after.
Harry sighed, gesturing vaguely in Seamus’ direction. “Dare, if I’m allowed.”
He heard a single reply from two identical voices. “Come, sweetheart.”
“Did you plan it?” Harry’s look was one of complete amazement and Draco found himself raptured by his face.
Their entrees arrived and Harry allowed himself a second of distraction to enjoy the delectable scent coming from his spaghetti.
Harry looked to his left, where Boo-boo was floating weirdly silent at his side, his cheeks looking extremely more corporeal than usual… wait, was he blushing?
, Harry— Merlin, hurry up!”
Draco looked at him and pulled out his tongue jokingly. Teddy blew raspberries at him and ran away, calling Andromeda to show her Draco’s work.
“It’s okay. I should try and explain the rest of what we know.” He inclined his head towards the tray and Harry grasped the first thing he found there: toasted bread with butter and jam. He bit into it— not bad.
left a bittersweet pang of disappointment in Harry’s chest, and a plea to remain almost escaped his lips.
The third time they met there, Harry knew it, it was planned. So, he should have been more prepared. But he wasn’t.
Malfoy climbed on the bed too, parting Harry’s legs to sit in between. He trailed his fingers down Harry’s thighs, feather-light, stopping at Harry’s hip bones. He smirked, then curled his fingers and Harry’s muscles clenched as his teeth sank into his bottom lip.
“None of your business.” You sneer, grab his shirt and pull him closer. “Black tonight?”
Potter’s genuine smile made Draco’s mind up in a second. He chuckled and finally put the stasis charm on the turtles, waving his wands once towards the reproduction of ocean for the samples, and once towards Lady Luck.
Harry planted his feet on the mattress and raised his arse from the bed to help him get them off, the fabric maddeningly brushing Harry’s cock. He let out a strangled moan and looked down to see Malfoy looking right at him, lowering his head and licking a long stripe from the base of Harry’s cock to the tip.
Doomed. Draco was
With that, they took their purses and stalked out. Every person in the restaurant was looking at Harry and Draco, whispering, pointing at them, laughing up their sleeves. Harry stood up suddenly and waved his hands angrily. “What are you looking at?! The show’s over! Mind your business!”
“Hair?”
,” Draco said with another groan. “I was going to take you to the Ritz. And—and I was taking you on a hot-air balloon, and—I have it in my pocket, you know! The hot- air balloon! And there were gonna be fireworks, and love confessions, and it was going to be perfect, and—”
that's
“You went on a date with the Weasel.”
“Of course it's normal, Potter, it's a shell. Shells don’t have regular patterns?”
the War?”
Fuck.
"Well, we are fifty years old after all." He stood up, his black hair glinting in the sun — the blond roots were growing out again. "Speaking of which," he went on, stretching out, "I can't sit this long without getting a backache. Shall we go?"
Harry stretched out his legs on the bench, looking intently at the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch.
All the memories from the previous night came back in a rush, making Harry's heart pump quickly.
Malfoy wiggled his hips. “Perhaps,” he said, casting a quick cleaning charm and slumping on the rug, rolling on his back. He widened his legs and Harry crawled between them.
“I don’t know.”
“Right. That’s a story for another time. You’re right, Draco, after the Second War the Ministry destroyed all the Time-Turners in circulation, afraid that someone could have used them to go back in time and save Voldemort. But, the thing is, my team of Unspeakables created a new object to travel through time, and that's that little box."
who turned down my help,
“Cook me breakfast,” Harry croaked, licking his lips. Then, “And bring it in here.”
Swot.
"They can't see me. It's always been like this! But you, you can see me! I've had glimpses of you two lately, but you disappeared so quickly that I never had the chance to speak to you! I'm so excited someone can finally see me!"
“Draco’s fixated on Potter again.”
. People, friends, even animals, can’t touch you without you feeling excruciating pain. The potion takes away the constant pain, but can’t do anything to shield you from the touch of others. It would be an infernal life."
“Nice joggers,” Harry said, voice husky, lips stretching into a playful smile. He approached Draco, raising a hand to tuck a loose strand of hair behind his ear.
“I want us to be very clear about what we want. You know when… ” Draco moaned, feeling Potter’s tongue drag along his neck, circling his Adam’s apple.
When he returned to London, he felt slightly better, though still uncertain what to do with his life. Ron, Smith, and what’s-his-name from Ravenclaw had joined the Aurors right after the War -- Harry decided to try and follow their lead. Kingsley had still insisted on getting him into the program, and eventually, Harry found himself enrolled.
Seeing Potter again had been shocking at the very least. Draco had dreamt of the day this would happen for years, imagining all sorts of scenarios, especially after reading about his divorce with Ginevra — the two of them casually meeting in Diagon Alley, or at the platform for Hogwarts.
After a few moments of silence, Draco sighed, his gaze dropped to his hands folded in his lap. "How you can still keep track of time passing, it's a mystery to me."
“I know.” He lowered Teddy on the floor who ran to the paint bucket, meddling with his hands and squealing happily.
Draco’s mouth dropped open, but he had no idea what to say in return. This entire conversation was bordering on something too intimate for a friends-with-benefits situation and the air around Draco started to feel too thick.
“Erm, thanks Fleur. Um, Hermione.” Everything seemed to stop for a moment while he outstretched his hand and waited for Granger’s next move. But she just smiled and nodded in acknowledgment, taking his hand.
“—that we’d alert when we lit up the fireworks to try and attract boats to us—”
it said.
Everyone’s eyes are on Harry now, and he feels restless. How iss he supposed to tell them the truth?
“Or worse! The fireworks would set themselves off in my pocket while we were in the air and we’d be dead before the balloon could even hit the water! Two explosions! On your
They landed on the frozen grass, stretching out after the flight. Malfoy’s black uniform clung to him as he stretched and Harry couldn’t stop his eyes from checking him out head to toe — Merlin, but he was fit.
Draco snorted, and Harry almost whined at the sensation on his neck. “Well, I hope so. I know I’ve done some shit, but…”
Hermione blushed, chewing absently on her upper lip.
Malfoy took a deep breath. “Specifically they’re experimenting with a new form of the Imperius curse.” He held out his pinky and realisation started to slowly sink into Harry’s brain, freezing him as he listened to Malfoy. “It creates a physical bond that lasts as long as the caster wants.”
. Draco cocked his head, taking a deep breath for dramatic effect. If there was something he loved about Gryffindors, it was how transparent their emotions were.
They each got ready in the two bathrooms of their house and while dressing, Draco hoped he could still meet Harry later in Diagon Alley as they had planned to do before all of this.
He had fished a vial out of his pocket, a dense dark blue liquid swirling inside of it.
“Malfoy?” Harry heard the door of Grimmauld Place close as Malfoy entered the house, the scent of his citrus shampoo lingering in the air behind him.
He opened his eyes again. “For the same reason you triggered my magic. You’re right, Harry. We’ve been important parts of each other's lives and we are who we are even thanks to that. And honestly… damn, I grew up with the story of the great Harry Potter, you know? I dreamed of you being Slytherin with me, of us becoming friends and then… we didn’t, and I was so angry, but… I can’t remember a time when I didn’t know who you were, and especially, who you are to me. I’ve always been worried about what you think of me, what you do, everything…”
“Fuck, buddy, I was kiddin'. What the f—”  Seamus was looking at him with wide eyes, as were all the other Gryffindors.
Draco sighed; he knew she wouldn’t drop the topic so easily, but he tried to delay the conversation anyway. “Thanks for tonight, Pansy. Actually, thanks for everything these last five years. I couldn’t have made it without you, and… thanks also for being my partner for the ball. I stole you from Blaise though; I feel guilty.”
It sounded fair enough to Harry, and that’s how it started.
Both Alicia and Malfoy nodded, all trace of sarcasm gone.
Harry ran to the living room, not even minding where the hell he left the glass of wine, his ivory linen shirt already starting to dampen with sweat.
With that, she turned on her heels and exited the room, her lime-green robe billowing behind her, wand still flashing.
Harry looked at the second Malfoy as he started stroking him and he knew, right in that moment, that he could not hold back his orgasm anymore.
“Thank you. We’re all here for the same cause: 100% of the proceeds will be donated to ‘The Tree of Life’, a charity association that works to support and help war orphans.”
Harry started brushing his thumbs over Malfoy’s cheekbones, tenderly. He stepped forward, bringing their bodies close again.
“With your horrible dancing skills? I remember the Yule Ball.” It was so easy to fall back into known territory, banter, mocking, reminiscing stupid things done during their younger years.
“Yeah, and the best one, as the newspapers seem to think.” The smirk appeared again on Potter’s face, and Draco felt his ears heating up. Thank Merlin for his now perpetual tanned skin since arriving in Bacalar the first time.
“It… I think something’s wrong with its legs or maybe… its sight, err,” Potter stuttered as his cheeks tinged light red. It looked incredibly cute on him and Draco cursed himself again.
"What does it mean for us?"
who betrayed me! I can’t believe you!”
Draco faltered behind Harry, before picking up the pace again, brutal and almost painful. “Ah,
Ron elbows him. “Idiot, Harry’s been hexed!”
They shared a half-smile in silence. Taking a deep breath, Draco snorted, his eyes searching for Potter in the room. Finding him at a stall with Bill and Fleur, more gorgeous than ever. “You know what,” he brought his eyes back to Pansy, “I’ll go talk to him right now. And you’ll go talk to Blaise.”
“I ordered a bottle of Chianti, I hope that’s fine. And some appetisers, your favourites.”
He pulled it out excited: maybe Hermione had found a way to contact him? But when he looked at the screen he saw the notification: five percent battery left.
That had been their first experience settling into the same timeline for a longer period.
“Errr, I may have come in my pants, or I may haven’t.” Draco snorted loudly, scrubbing a hand on his face.
“Hey! This looks like Durmstrang!” Malfoy exclaimed suddenly, but they didn’t have any time to talk more about it—
Draco looked behind himself, seeing the albino peacocks padding through the gardens, close to them. He returned his gaze to Harry, amused. “They are albino peacocks and yes, they usually sleep at this time, but I guess the noise is keeping them awake tonight. They aren’t used to life here anymore.”
Harry was the chef. Draco was sure of it.
And then the next item, the very first wand made by Shikoba Wolfe. They were famous in America for making highly complex wands, their reputation was well-known around the world. Their first wand wasn’t possible to master but had an incredible value, even more for that reason.
“I’ll admit the first time can be overwhelming. But once you taste the food…” Draco trailed off, kissing his fingers in a top quality gesture. Pansy laughed, serving herself some of the salmon nuggets.
Astoria snorted quietly, clutching the bowl of ice-cream in her hands. “Do you want a bit of ice cream? It’s delicious.”
But to talk about it with someone else, with
Draco spent the entire, exhausting morning staring at the door of his office, wishing he could implant one of those televisions Potter was so fond of to distract himself.
“Right. And if I say…” Harry shifted, trying to distance himself from Malfoy. “Please, jump up and down.”
These fantasies always ended up with Draco under the cold spray of the shower, trying to resist the urge to imagine having sex with Potter again, slicking him open with his tongue, fucking roughly into his puckered hole as he’d squirmed and begged for more.
“Do it, Harry. Then I’ll explain it all.”
And yet, it had seemed the lesser evil compared to revealing to the world his… “complications” after the War.
Hermione smiled, stopping for a moment to swallow her quinoa. “You fell in love. Harry, I know it’s hard to believe, but it happens to the best of us. You can do this.”
Harry reached out, trying to grab Ron’s arm. “No! Stop, you traitor! I was kidding!”
“Mh,” Malfoy hummed, laying down on the carpet right in front of the couch. The books landed neatly around Malfoy’s body and he picked one up, throwing a glare in Harry’s direction. “Do you mind moving your foot? It's right above my face.”
“Ready for the big finale?” Malfoy asked when he wasn't wearing anything but his pants.
Harry leaned down and bracketed his elbows next to Draco’s face, whispering, “Next time, we’ll use wine. Chianti.”
To this day, Draco had no idea what force possessed him to say what came out of his mouth next.
’re tired, Potter?! I— you made me— have you any idea!”
“No!” Draco almost begged, “Not again! Please, let’s just go inside to dance!” He took Potter by the hand and dragged him inside, both of them bursting into a fit of giggling.
“Fuck, Potter,” he whispered.
“Eww, do we have to stay here and bear your honeymoon phase, now? Get your shit together. I’ll go talk with Luna, Tori come with me. Ron, you and Hermione should go find Rita.” With that, Ginevra stalked off, in the direction of the fireplace.
Fuck.
He looked up to check Malfoy’s reaction to it; as always, his lips were parted and his eyes were darkened. Harry conceded himself a small smile before taking off his trousers and pants and finally lay on the bed completely naked.
They built new traditions together and Wednesday mornings were one of them. They would always meet in the pub next to the hotel where Jacob brought Harry that nefarious night and would have breakfast together.
After five years.
, pretty early on. I’m a Malfoy, I can’t simply walk around with people begging me to take them. I have dignity.”
He loved this place.
“Your hair is black! And your beard, you have none!”
By Merlin, but was the sex
Harry rolled his eyes and stuck his tongue out at him, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
He loved Harry. Harry loved him.
“I — ” Draco was trying to work something out when Harry stepped in. “Well, to be honest, we were in love since forever. It’s just a year that we — ” He stopped, probably realising he wasn’t dealing with the situation in the right way.
Here, the time, t-the…”
Draco liked his life. It wasn’t what his father had envisioned for him, but Draco was perfectly fine with it.
He didn't turn towards Potter but he felt him huffing, annoyed, knowing.
and stood up, stretching and looking up at the sky.
Harry sighed, laying back on the pillows, finally relaxing the muscles that had tightened without him realising it. He ran a hand through his hair, feeling it even more rumpled than usual.
Harry blinked. What the fuck?
“Don’t step on my Guccis, Granger!”
As if. Malfoys didn’t get crushes. They either loathed people or loved them. He could see how that might appear contradictory, but this thing with Potter, well… they’d agreed. It was a mutually satisfying arrangement. It was a Slytherin move, right?
incident.
They spun on their heels, hands flying to their wands secured on their thighs, but all they could see was a floating little ghost, who couldn’t more than nine or ten years old.
“Tie?”
"We talked! Remember, you suggested we should do it."
Malfoy turned his head to Harry, his eyebrows drawn close.
He sighed loudly, cringing at the stench of alcohol on his breath, barely resisting the urge to empty his stomach, taking deep breaths one after the other.
“I’m all right, love,” Harry said, and suddenly he was hugging Draco closer, burying his face in the crook of Draco’s neck. “Glad to be home.”
lettuce, Pansy, I hate it, yet I always eat it here.”
Someone was singing… someone that definitely sounded like Malfoy and whose voice was so deep that Harry’s chest felt tight. Without thinking too much, he pushed the door slowly open to find Malfoy standing in the centre of the room. Teddy, with bright blond hair, tears in his eyes, but relaxed in Malfoy’s hug.
“Sure, why not.” Harry looked amazed while Draco took his wand and muttered a spell he never heard before. With his wand still sparkling golden, he asked Harry, “I need you to tell anything, anything at all. It’s just to impress your voice with the magic in the paint of the walls.”
Malfoy was bent over his waist, kneeling on the floor, emptying his stomach.
Harry whispered into his ear, “I love you,” but Draco didn’t reply nor did anything to show he was awake. It probably was something he said unconsciously and that fact blinded Harry with arousal — the idea that Draco was
Right at that moment Draco raises his gaze and meets Harry’s eyes. His beautiful, bright, green eyes and—
The more Malfoy realised, the higher his voice got. It made Harry smile into the crook of his hands. “Two weeks ago, you brought me lunch at work. You said— you said it was for Ron, but that Ron wasn’t there, so… It was actually for me, wasn’t it?”
“This is bullshit! We didn’t kiss! Okay, we held hands. So what!” Harry’s cheeks were flushed red and he was looking around them all as if trying to read the situation.
“No, we don’t have to.” Astoria interrupted him, “But we want to. You may have been disrespectful with us, but we are family and this stupid demeanour of judgement and resentment amongst the Wizarding World should stop.” She reached Ginny at the fireplace. “We’ll update later.”
This is how it should go, you tell yourself. You don’t deserve happiness.
In a flash, Harry realised Malfoy hadn't come yet and made to grasp his cock, but he gently batted his hand away.
“See you never again, thank you very much.”
Ron mimicked gagging and rolled his eyes. “You’re all so disgustingly sappy. Why Paris, then? It’s just a city like—”
“Yeah, that makes sense, Harry. You’ve chosen him.”
“Mate, I know. But we’ve been paired a couple of times during Auror training, and I don’t know, he’s good. We get each other, when we’re out in the field.”
“You’re welcome.” Harry heard himself speaking with an affectionate tone, feeling his fingers itch to touch and reassure Malfoy, help him feel better, stroke his hair, his cheeks.
Harry blinked two, three, four times. Either Malfoy had succeeded to fuck him into silliness, or the overwhelming pleasure was intoxicating him, because in front of him Harry could distinctly see another Malfoy, dressed in shirt and trousers, a smirk on his face.
Ron took a deep breath, still smiling. “And stop talking about those polls, Draco. They’ve been going on for at least a year now. Drop it.”
Zabini’s mouth forms a small ‘o’ and he looks relieved, for whatever reason. “I see,” he says, scratching with a hand under his chin. “I really think you should go find Draco.”
That day, though, something went pear-shaped they said. The entire Ministry was blocked as they tried to fix it. Perhaps it was a weather charm problem? The lifts? Or maybe it was a leak from the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes— they had all sorts of weird artefacts and people up there.
Draco opened the door of his flat, slumped on the couch and took a deep breath. His head was throbbing, he really needed to take a Sobering Potion or he’d never survive the night with Harry. Plus, he wanted to remember his big declaration of love.
Yes, everything would be perfect. What could go wrong?
Harry stared numbly until Gary shifted and mumbled, “It’s the seventh mug you’ve broken today.”
Draco closed his eyes, slowly traced Harry’s lips with his thumb. “I’ll kiss you forever.”
late, demonstrating once again how poor-mannered he was! And, and… Oh, Merlin’s tits, in what state!?
It was late in the night when he was finally able to keep his eyes open for more than a few seconds, but he wasn't sure he was really awake when the first thing he saw was Draco Malfoy in a lime-green robe and golden halo around his head.
and every other wizarding newspaper sported a picture of naked, winged, and screechy Harry in the middle of Diagon Alley the next morning.
“With me?”
“I was,” Potter admitted, raising an eyebrow. “You did leave me without a single word, or your cock for that matter, for an entire week.”
Through the waves of pleasure that were still running through him, Draco could only comply. He kissed Harry again and it felt like coming back home, like fireworks. He could actually hear them, roaring up in the sky, flashes of lights like bolts of lightning breaking the dark of the night…
“What?!” Hermione’s eyes are bulging so much they look like ping-pong balls. The guys are all wearing either shocked or amused expressions.
Ginny inhaled slowly, closing her eyes. “Let’s go inside and get some rest, shall we?”
He picked up a pink flower from the soil and approached Harry, stopping mere inches from him, his breath ghosting over Harry’s lips. He brought the flower to Harry’s nostrils and Harry inhaled deeply, closing his eyes.
Harry grabbed a red rose from the coffee table next to them and swirled it in the air between them.
He felt nausea clawing at his stomach and curled a hand over it, trying to get a hold of himself. If he was feeling this bad, he could only imagine how Astoria was feeling right now. He needed to find her.
“Oh my fucking—” Harry’s breath hitches and he keeps trembling as he comes a third time, knot pulsing and pulsing until he almost passes out.
It wasn’t gentle or slow or kind. Draco shoved Potter’s jeans and pants down, tucking them just below the knees, not even bothering to undress him fully. Potter kept squirming and writhing under Draco, begging to ‘hurry up’ and ‘just shove it in’ or he’d ‘do it alone’. Draco took one moment to admire Potter’s round arse cheeks before roughly spreading them, muttering the preparation spells. They both preferred to take their time, to stretch Potter’s hole with Draco’s fingers and mouth, but tonight Draco wasn’t one for patience.
He turned to leave but Boo-boo called for him, “Draco! Dad, wait!”
Harry would have been offended if Malfoy’s tone hadn’t been so soft and satisfied. He snorted, gently untangling himself from Malfoy. “It’s your fault,” he declared, waving a hand to cast a discreet cleaning charm on the both of them.
and the slave can’t do anything to resist it.”
"Nngh," he clutched the hand to his chest, trying to breathe around the pain, like Alicia had told him to do.
The glasses cleared in time for Harry to see Malfoy’s jaw clenching tight, regal and elegant in its anger. Dear lord, but Harry liked to rile his Sir up from time to time.
“Why not you?” Harry asked, starting to hyperventilate. Ron licked his lips. “Harry, I’m needed to finish these investigations… and being tied up with Draco means that you can’t leave the house. Initially, at least, the bond requires physical closeness and… We also believe, some sort of contact.”
Draco broke away a moment, took off Harry’s glasses, ‘they are distracting, fuck, Harry come back here’, again connecting with those delicious lips and sunk his hands into Harry’s hair, untying it.
"Well, Potter—"
This time Malfoy positively snarled at Harry, showing his teeth and all, but his body didn’t move an inch.
— put together, resolved, and everyone liked him. And, by Merlin, how dare Malfoy look so
Resting her hand on Draco’s shoulder, Pansy’s tone softened. “Okay, listen honey, it’s dessert time. The buffet tables are piled high with sweets and fruits and people are already gathering up to choose their favourite. I can see Potter and Granger there too. Why don’t you get up and go talk to him? Just say hi.”
“Draco, is he now?”
“Merlin, Pansy, you’re revolting when you’re eating cherries. Can you not?” He huffed impatiently, pulling at her elbow to make her follow him. She dropped the second cherry already in her hand, rolling her eyes. “I already told you, you need to work on your way of speaking with people, Draco. You’re rude.”
Malfoy's lips were clenched in a tight line, his fingers tapping lightly on his desk, fidgeting with the cacti.
Harry hummed and pointed toward Draco's gift on the bed. "Yes. Your favourite flavour, isn't it?"
And you go, closer, feeling yourself drawn to him like a sailor to a siren.
"I don't! I have no idea either!"
Harry smiled, his heart warmed by his words. “Thank you, Al. I hope so. What about you?”
Neville finished for her, “That for all those years you weren’t fighting, but
Harry gasped, turning abruptly towards Ron. No, no, he wasn’t still there with them and hadn’t been for the last thirty minutes.
But he didn’t. They swam in silence that day.
It never rained in Bacalar. Since Draco had arrived, the sun hadn’t stopped shining. But he would quickly learn nothing stays the same forever.
“You’re chatty under Veritaserum, huh.” Harry chuckled, unable to restrain. “If it’s as strong as all that, I think it’s best we don’t go out right now. I’m an Auror, there are things I
“Yes.” He said once more, voice shaking, breaking into a stream of sobs, his lips trembling. Draco wanted to capture them in a kiss, but…
Eleven months in, and Draco’s hair was turquoise and Harry completely lost it for him. Their tub wanking sessions had multiplied and Harry couldn’t be happier than having all this time with Draco. He got to know so much about him, his life and choices, during their nightly chats, about Draco’s love for light blue jumpers, his absolute huge fear of bugs, how he would go on long French rants when he was angry, how it turned Harry on, how Harry speaking Parseltongue turned Draco on.
Another Hop later, Harry was feeling his stomach in his throat and his head pounding as if all the woodpeckers of the world had decided to peck at it together.
“No, I’m in. Sounds like fun.” He flashed a smile to Malfoy, who blinked, cheeks still deliciously flushed.
“Erm, Draco? You okay?”
Harry felt a shiver run from his neck to the very tip of his toes at the idea that a person could even think of abducting someone else into a relationship. Malfoy grunted and whispered to Harry to follow him out to meet Boo-boo again.
Shaking his head, he grabbed Pansy’s elbow and tugged lightly. “Err, what are you doing here, Pansy?”
Grimmauld Place had been cleaned up: everything was shiny and polished, Walburga’s portrait had been shut down somehow by Kreacher— Harry didn’t ask for details, he was just savouring the sudden quiet in the house.
Malfoy’s voice felt close. Before Harry could process why, his lips were spreading into a grin. When he looked up into Malfoy’s stormy —
“Mate, go home and get some rest, will you?”
Draco had placed the vial on the table and stood up, reaching for him, talking directly into his ear.
Ron shrugged. “I’ll come by tomorrow to discuss developments. For now, just… please.”
“We may as well talk about our sexual preferences. I’m starting to— ah, well, I’m getting off on your orders now and I think it would be safer if we knew…”
“They said it was a problem with the lifts so it wouldn’t arouse suspicions. But all the Unspeakables had been called in half an hour ago; apparently, someone broke into the Thought Chamber and stole all the Pensieves. It’s gonna be a disaster.”
“Ah, you’d like that,” he drawled, raising an eyebrow and jutting out his chin a bit, staring into Draco’s eyes.
The more the water slid down his body, the more sober Harry felt. Soaping himself up, he let his mind drift off to the memories of the previous night.
Hermione raised her eyes from the menu she was perusing to fix him with an I’ve known-you-for-fifteen-years look. “I could feel your Veela screeching from ten blocks away.”
Pansy and Blaise didn’t leave his side once, helping him out of difficult conversations — ‘did you know Hermione Granger would buy the Manor?’ ‘what do you think she’ll do with it?’ That was an interesting question: what
There. Without even thinking about it, Draco had just called him Harry. For a moment, he hoped Harry hadn’t heard him, but judging by the way Harry’s eyes nearly bulged out of his skull, he had.
Now Draco’s eyebrows knitted together. “With you? Where are you staying?”
Draco cast an extremely strong wandless and wordless locking spell on the door of the room and a powerful
Draco nodded, feeling his face heat up at the implications of Potter’s words. He was so anxious while they were talking earlier that he hadn’t had the time to really understand the meaning of his statements. Now that he had repeated them to Pansy, Potter’s words resonated deep in Draco’s heart.
“I actually feel amazing.” Malfoy anticipated him, understanding immediately what Harry had wanted to ask him. “Orgasming is probably a good way to keep the bond at bay for a while.”
When they were alone again, Draco pulled at Harry and guided him to a more hidden part of the gardens, far from the cackles and the music. “Hermione told me she has a project for the Manor, with other people…”
Again, Alicia was able to calm him down with her smile and sweet tone. Harry understood why she had chosen that profession.
Harry buried his face in his mug and in no time, his glasses fogged up. Not being able to see Malfoy’s face gave him a boost of courage.
Draco had huffed, not meeting Harry’s eyes. “Well, okay, I brewed it. But it’s safe, I know what I’m doing!”
“We could go out in the gardens and continue this conversation…”
"Potter’s chasing the Snitch like a horny Hippogriff who forgot how to fly. A Quaffle approaches but Jacob kicks it low into the opponent's area. Game’s back on for Harry Potter, he may do it this time, Jacob's smiling and Potter… Potter fails! He drops the sex bomb, stumbles over his drunken words, and faints on the counter—"
Hermione was holding Harry back; she was laughing too. Ron started again, “Oh, he also said —and I’m quoting— that
.” She snorts and winks at Harry. Damn it.
He stormed out the bathroom, leaving a confused Draco behind. A confused Draco who had no intention of letting Potter win this argument! Feeling adrenaline coursing through his body at the idea of having one of his old quarrels with Potter, he hurried to follow him out. Ah, he had forgotten how good Potter looked when he was angry, how his eyes sparkled, and his throat worked deliciously.
The water made his movements rougher and Draco was looking for reasons to get out of the ocean to have what was sure to be more comfortable sex, when a couple of drops hit Draco’s head and he huffed, annoyed.
Harry thought,
Harry looked on the scene horrified — those words should have probably been coming out of Harry’s mouth, not Boo-boo’s.
In a rush, James, Albus and Lily all entered the kitchen, looking hurried and astounded. Ginny glanced sideways at Harry, who had no idea what was happening. They had barely the time to share a look when the three children started talking at the same time.
confused, Merlin.
, bloody hell!”
Harry asked for a hot tea without anything to eat, receiving raised eyebrows from his best friends. He was usually famished when hungover but this time, Harry was restlessly shifting in his chair to try and ease the itching on his skin and his stomach was still churning and turning over and over again — he really didn't feel like eating.
“So!” A blush threatened to show its way all over Draco’s face. “Where’s Hermione? I saw her here just a minute ago.”
“Are you telling me you don’t read my magazine?” Her tone was light and amused, but Draco knew it was a way to contain her disappointment.
“Don’t call him that!” She blurted out, her cheeks quickly competing with the tomatoes on Draco’s dish in redness. “Well, yes, Ron invited me to his place to have dinner last night. I don’t see how that—”
A small crowd of the people they most loved was waiting for Draco, Harry standing gorgeous at the centre of it, a flower crown in his hair: narcissus and lilies. They took an eternity to decide which flower to use for their crowns but in the end, there were no doubts. Not only did they symbolise their mothers, but they made a perfect contrast one next to the other: white and yellow; while brightening Draco and Harry’s faces, they highlighted, even more, the joy radiating from them.
“You can stay here if you want. I have to go, now.”
Malfoy sighed again, closing his eyes with a soft smile. The sight stole Harry’s breath away.
Harry exhaled loudly from his nostrils and nodded, muttering something Draco didn’t quite catch, but that sounded a lot like ‘ugh, women’.
Ron snorts when Harry says it; Hermione rolls her eyes but wears a fond smile.
It was the last straw; with a couple of thrusts Harry came, crying Draco’s name between kisses, pumping his release in his lover’s perfect arse. His whole body tensed up and then relaxed, embracing Draco’s spent body on his, his arms still secured around his waist, holding tight.
As he left the dining hall, Draco let his gaze wander over the walls of the corridor, the portraits, statues and the sculptures his family collected over the years. He had them all checked for old spells and curses, after having previously hidden them for all those years, and now the ones remaining stood proudly in the Manor again.
Wavering on his wobbly legs, Draco somehow managed to pay their bill, before telling Jerome something along the line of “I’ve discovered your secret, you’re not safe anymore.” Pansy apologised profusely a couple of steps behind him, and before he knew it, he arrived home in one piece.
“I just wanted to tell you something. When we… when I have sex with you and you’re, err, asleep. Well, do you think there’s any way you could just…
The answers to Malfoy’s questions started circling in Harry’s head —
“I was hoping you’d say that.”
“Dirty,” he said, guiding Harry to slide up his cock.
“Malfoy! What the—! No, I wasn’t, I don’t, I mean…”
Harry closed his eyes as the vibrations of Malfoy’s words on his lips went straight to his cock. Malfoy’s smell was strong up close like this, clouding his ability to think, bringing back too much, too many feelings.
He thought again about Malfoy’s offer.
“Yes! What is the occasion, once again? Forgive my old memory, Draco.”
But then, Malfoy’s eyebrows drew together and he pursed his lips.
"I'm telling you one last time, Draco."
And Harry looked up at him, trembling like a leaf, cock leaking incessantly, mind scattering with thoughts, trying to grasp
“Now, turn on your stomach, pet.”
“If I have to be entirely honest, it doesn’t surprise me. I mean, I’ve been friends with Harry for longer than Malfoy and we never bought a house together.”
“No! See, I was right! I didn’t wanna know! Why did you do that to me, Draco?” He shook his head and Harry laughed despite having just lived one of the weirdest moments of his life.
Hermione rolled her eyes, a smile pulling at her lips. “It wasn’t funny, you git. It blocked the entire Ministry for half a day.”
With the last strands of sanity left in Draco, he inhaled deeply and looked around themselves, frowning slightly.
“I have vibrators. And marshmallows. I can cook— you can still hate me, it’s alright.”
Potter sat down next to Draco, smiling as if it was nothing. As if they really were only
“C’mon, Harry, take out the Cloak.” Malfoy nodded his head towards the entrance of the cottage, where Jacob and the other man were entering with a concerted effort.
It’s always driven Harry crazy. How he’d always look in order, hair perfect, not a strand out of place. Suit perfectly tailored, shoes shiny, not a single wrinkle on his shirts.
“It’s different. Blaise is… we’ve been friends for so long. It’s scary to think of changing everything now.”
Moving his gaze to the walls again, Draco sighed. “You know, I’ve charmed it.”
Harry was still staring at the fireplace when Malfoy made a clicking noise and huffed impatiently. “I’ll explain more, Potter, but right now I seriously need you to give me an order. Something bigger this time.”
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at Harry, muttering, “Congratulations, Potter.”
“Idiot!” Again, Ron’s elbow startled Harry out of his reminiscence.
Ugh, Draco shook his head, trying to clear it of everything.
“Didn’t tell me
“I… I’m just tired, is all,” Harry muttered. He sat down in front of Malfoy and picked his mug up.
Draco snorted and got up, casting a shy
This time the silence that stretched between them was comfortable and Harry found himself brushing his fingertips all over Malfoy’s ankles, down his calves, his thighs.
Hermione sighed, sucking on her ice lolly. "Your obsession with Malfoy is insane."
The game went on pretty much the same, with Hermione and Ron sending him glances from time to time, reminding Harry that he hadn’t escaped it and that they’d wanted every single detail of what happened the day after.
Then, once, something happened — Harry woke up and Draco was… having a sex dream. Harry was sure of it. Draco’s cock was hard and straining against Harry’s arse, and his breathing was quickened, soft groans escaping his parted lips. Harry turned to look at him and the sight stole his breath. The idea that Draco was turned on and aroused while not fully conscious rubbed something into Harry, a primitive instinct, animalistic. He watched mesmerised, cock achingly hard in his briefs, as Draco writhed and moaned in his sleep until he stilled and his breath caught on a single word. “Harry.”
entered my messy head. Just
Ginevra raised an eyebrow and looked at him. “Why, Malfoy, it seems you’re troubled tonight. You never drink alcohol before the food arrives.”
Malfoy’s lips were now curved in an amused smile. It was beautiful.
Harry looked between them, finally putting the pieces of the puzzle together.
"This place always looks a bit impersonal to me, don't you think?"
here, then?"
Draco bit on his lips, looking lost for a moment. Trying to think how to make him happier, Harry had a silly idea and hoped it would work.
“Oh really?” he asked, his lips quirking at the sides. “Well, you know, at least I’ve got good company. It just so happens that your ex-boyfriend fancies me.”
It’s over too soon, but you take what you can and taste every single drop he spills down your throat as he growls like an animal. “Take it, you stupid, stupid idiot, just fucking take it.”
He took a deep breath and started again, his voice firmer, “I really struggled to find the perfect birthday gift for you today.”
In no time, Malfoy’s hands were on Harry’s body again. He brushed his fingers to Harry’s ribs, ever so slightly, roaming them up and down, his eyes intent on Harry’s.
Draco smiled at her. What beautiful, intelligent women saw in that Weasel, he had no idea. “Hermione, you’re smarter than this. Besides, I’m not the one you should talk to. If Ron has something to tell you, he should be the one to do so.”
going to miss Potter. Not again.
Hermione smiled. “Uh, well, I thought you might need them, so I asked Alicia to provide some more flasks and I brought your Cloak, Harry. I hope it’s not a problem.” A faint blush covering her cheeks; she was always so modest but she was the best when it came to details of planning, especially when it involved Harry’s safety.
“Yes, found it! I’ll call her Lady Luck, like the goddess.”
“As I told you, I started trying to get Scarlet Tribe’s attention a couple of months ago, but I was finally contacted by them three weeks ago. I haven’t been inside their base enough to know everything about this spell.”
Ron's voice came out slow, like the one you'd use after hearing your best buddy saying they want to lead a bunch of flobberworms on a leash down Diagon Alley.
Draco finally disentangled himself from Harry’s embrace, fistpumping the air above his head, screaming in triumph.
"Meaning that you'd be bonded with the other person in three ways. Feelings, mind and touch."
“I… erm, I see. She, um, she bought the Manor.”
Hermione went on. “Harry, we are all immune to your Allure. It works to signal attraction to you, not the other way around. And that goes for Draco too, and you
“What the actual fu — ” “Is this true?” “Mum, how are you?” Lily went running to hug Ginny, covering her face with kisses. She looked completely taken aback, but soon enough relaxed in her hug, whispering, “Oh Merlin, thanks, Lily.”
“Hmm,” Potter mumbled, eyes glinting. “So, this is the moment where you ask me if I want something to drink, I refuse politely, and then we go to your bedroom and fuck each other senseless?”
“Draco! Don’t worry, you were busy. In the end, we did a really good job with the curse-breakers, don’t you think? Everything is beautiful, safe and in order again. In addition, I made sure that protective spells and wards were in place so that people wouldn’t go wandering outside the festivities area and messing up tonight’s event.”
Malfoy uncorked a deep purple flask and stuttered, “I— I was kidding, I need to start the potion again and, um—”
The sounds of the wireless danced around them, swirling in the air, vibrating in Draco’s ears, reaching his sore soul. Beethoven had always been Draco’s favourite. He closed his eyes, savouring it. “Do you really think this is a good idea, Pans?”
A pillow flew into his face as Potter’s laughter — delightful, full, warm laughter— filled the room.
He comes in his fist, shoves the vibrator just in the right angle, and you finally come, untouched, his smile filling your vision.
Draco found himself more than once almost choking on a piece of food, taking deep breaths, closing his eyes to get a hold of himself. That dildo was clearly intended as a joke, but it got to Draco and Harry noticed as much, so he decided to torture Draco, with excellent results — so that at the end of the lunch, Draco’s head was spinning and his cock was aching in his trousers.
She stopped, her scandalised face soon morphed into an amused one. “Can I have some?”
“Well… let’s see if Teddy likes what I bought him.” He unwrapped the package, revealing a big stuffed horse doll enchanted to gallop an overexcited Teddy around the house.
Draco’s heart again started pumping so fast he could feel it in his throat, and he hurried to go sit at the table with his notary. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw a waiter picking up the portrait, fixing it. Cool, everything was cool.
You haven’t said a single word since you arrived. You’re just fucking him, scratching your nails over his chest, fastening your mouth on every secret corner of his body.
“Yeah, and the shoes.”
Maylfoy had started complaining about every single detail from the moment they first appeared in that neighbourhood, and Harry had given up on arguing almost immediately.
“Er,” Harry spluttered, flushing slightly. Draco decided he liked the reaction.
Harry looked flabbergasted at him. “If we go out now, in the middle of the song, alone, we’d make the front page quicker than a Snitch just released.”
Malfoy came to stand next to him, his deep breathing soothing him somehow.
Malfoy loved it. He arched into Harry’s touch and let a soft moan escape him when Harry’s tongue breached him and— that was it. The rest of the time he stayed there, arse in the air, hands curled into fists on the sheets, taking Harry’s tongue until he croaked, “Fuck, ‘m gonna come—” muffled against the pillow.
“I want to see you.”
Harry backed a couple of steps, regarding him with a wild expression — because Draco used his first name or because he suddenly sobered, Draco didn’t know for sure — but he hoped it wasn’t the latter. Luckily, after a moment, Harry’s mouth quirked, wicked as he said, “Catch me, then.”
“Nothing,” Harry quickly amends, wrapping both arms around Draco’s waist. “Now, what about we make our first time only the first of many?”
! But then he keeps coming back! And we keep having sex!”
“Yes—”, Harry cleared his throat, his voice still breathy and resentful. His chest roaring, shouting that Malfoy should be
He had broken the kiss to moan into it, “I love you too, I love you, I love you.”
to take care of you.”
Malfoy and him laying on the floor, kissing.
Draco’s breath hitched. She didn’t seem inclined to burn it down, after all. “Ah, yes, yes, you did. I must say, though, quite unexpectedly. I…” He trailed off, unsure as how to continue the sentence without being offensive:
Draco glanced at the vial still resting on the nightstand.
clumsy.
Except that Malfoy was still drinking that horrible slop he dared to call hot tea.
"You what! And I never discovered that in thirteen years? How!"
He tried to take a deep breath but his chest burned and another sob escaped him. Turning to look again at Malfoy, he ran out of the room, Ron’s ‘Harry, wait! Where are you going?’ already fading into nothingness behind him as he left the Room of Requirement and wandered through the hollow corridors of Hogwarts.
Offering a weak smile, Draco accepted Potter’s hand and squeezed it. It was a strong hand, warm and soft. Not at all how Draco had imagined it would be. Potter was smiling his ear-to-ear grin and Draco realised too late he was staring at Potter’s
It was her favourite motto and it was true, every single time.
“Yes, yes. It
"Two teaspoons of cold milk and one of sugar. I remember it because I always thought it was kinda posh. Who takes his tea with a precise amount of milk and sugar, always the same?"
It was the closest thing to a smile Harry saw on her face since the War was over.
“Wait—” Harry grabbed the envelope with the snakeskin and threw it at Malfoy. “Okay. It’s my turn, right?”
, ex-Death Eater, and—”
“Not always. I had no idea, for example, because my Muggle relatives didn’t want to acknowledge that magic exists.”
not loved your presents?” Harry said. “Don’t listen to Ron. I knew what I was signing up for when I started dating you, and I haven’t regretted it one day. Well, except for that time with the—”
The shit of the war were still fresh wounds, their past rivalry playing an important role in their difficulties but with time they had learned to coexist, and they had even become friends. Sometimes Draco thought it was inevitable; they had a lot of things in common and they had strong chemistry and compatibility, once they had abandoned their childish selves.
changing lately, and there was no point denying it.
Draco nodded, his fingers curling on the stem of his glass.
“I honestly don’t remember, I don’t know what to say,” Harry starts. The room falls into a silence so deep Harry fears for a moment everyone’s disappeared. He opens his eyes: they’re all still there, expectant eyes and raised eyebrows.
“—there are no cannibals in the English Channel—”
“Well then…” Potter cocked his head and a strand of curly hair fell on his glasses, catching the last rays of sunshine that enhanced the emerald of his eyes. Draco was lost in it before he knew it.
He blushed some more and then asked in a whisper, “Do you remember… our first time, when you came…”
Harry cleared his throat next to him. “Erm, thanks Astoria. We want to thank you all, guys, for being so understanding and supportive, after that article came out…”
They descended the stairs as quickly as possible, and when Harry and Malfoy arrived at the reception area it was to see Jacob sitting on a sofa, a hand still clenched on his stomach, white as a sheet.
“The ballroom! Everyone is waiting for you. Pansy went to get you and then you weren’t coming back…”
“Listen, Harry, I asked Granger to be here today because we tried to come up with a solution during the days you were unconscious. But…”
Munching on the most perfect, delicious, heavenly pancakes he had ever eaten, Draco’s mind reeled. What were they doing? Why did Potter cook breakfast for him? Why weren’t they fucking?
Harry was cooking dinner and he had turned his head distractedly. “What?”
Once at Hotel ‘The Compass’, they hurried to the reception desk, while Malfoy's face looked almost as green as his Slytherin scarf, and was muttering something that sounded like, "I'll never trust Potter again in my life."
“I want to hear you—” Harry whispered as he spread Malfoy’s buttcheeks. “Talk to me, tell me what you feel.” He dug his nose into Malfoy’s crease, shuddering at the musky scent that was so intimate, so darkly
Right at that moment, the past Harry and Jacob started walking towards the fireplace and before they could Floo, Harry and Malfoy heard them pronounce the destination: Hotel ‘The Compass’, room 17.
Harry nodded, feeling every fibre of his body vibrating as he worried he’d not be able to contain his laughter at the feather’s teasing. But that was always the best part; Malfoy knew exactly how far to go with the teasing, and Harry always loved showing how much he was willing to take to please his Sir.
Draco looked at the piece of paper with trepidation. He nodded, taking the proffered clue to his happiness, tucking it away in the inside pocket of his blazer.
here feels more than fine. So, you also keeping tabs on me. Good to know."
The use of his surname had Draco’s head snapping up. He and Hermione had agreed to use first names during their early days of training, wanting to put a stone on their past.
Harry was openly beaming now. He chuckled, leaning his hip against the writing desk. “A way out from what, Draco?”
should do something for that,” Harry drawled, not able to resist the small smirk playing on his lips.
"Wasn't Boo-boo w-weird?" Harry stuttered out, trying to keep his tone as low as Malfoy's, attempting to make his brain work.

“Harry, I know this isn’t Paris. There isn’t the perfect sunset and the
Malfoy gasped too, hot and broken on his neck, inhaling deeply against Harry’s hair before speaking again. “And now, Harry, now how many times has someone done this to you?”
That was one of his favourite things about Sweet Prophecies: it easily accounted for everyone’s tastes because it provided dishes from practically every country of the world, of every culture, with all kinds of ingredients. Draco hummed, lost in pleasure, when a thought occurred to him.
Hermione Granger was real, real and solid against him, and he was back in the Unspeakables laboratories! This couldn’t be true. She disentangled the hug, murmuring that—
The wooden canary softly sang the half hour: 11:30 pm. Potter looked up at it and smiled. Turning to Draco again, he extended his elbow. “C’mon.”
“I’m sorry, Boo-boo. Sorry I didn’t talk about it anymore or try to explain… I… um. Think you could be right.” He side-eyed Draco, who had his eyebrows knitted together, doubt now replacing apprehension.
Malfoy’s eyes were a liquid silver. “I think,” he started, his voice trembling. He cleared his throat. “I think I can be lured into the life of a kept man.” He smiled, honest and open for the first time. “Regular sex, food, and attention…”
When dinner time neared, Draco politely refused again Andromeda’s invite, greeting them at the doorstep, promising he’d stay next time.
flirting. Interesting, I should reconsider your behavior during our years at Hogwarts.” He raised an eyebrow and brought a hand to Draco’s face, his fingers feather soft on his jaw. “So, you like my piercing.”
Harry laughed.
Without saying anything more, Harry Summoned the dildo their wives gifted them as a joke. He regarded it with a worried look for a moment, before saying to Draco, “Um, love, I don’t want to hurt you. I think it would be better to use a spell to, erm, get you ready?”
and we are useless and stupid.”
“Fuck,” he murmurs. Harry closes his eyes, bringing his hands to massage his temples. His head’s pounding. He spares just a vague thought about how that’s not how a Sobering Potion should make him feel.
They just continued a relationship that felt inevitable by then, with Draco’s stomach fluttering every time Harry would be close to him, and his lips quirking up every time Harry brought coffee to him during a lesson or lingered that moment longer in a stolen hug in the corridors.
“Now who’s the whore,” he says as he splutters saliva all over your hole. You don’t care as long as he keeps doing
“Can’t breathe—” he croaked. Barely an hour without orders and Malfoy was already choking.
"No." He repeated, calmer. They've had this argument too many times, and it always ended in the same way. It wasn't worth getting angry all over again.
“Harry! Harry, stop it! Christ, your— your wings!” Gary was holding his hands against his ears, and that’s when Harry realised the trilling sound was coming from him. His Veela was fully presenting, and he was lost to it.
“We have to come up with good questions if we want to know the name of his gay fling.” Hermione rose from her seat and moved next to Seamus, Ron following her and Harry watched, impotent, as they started whispering, writing down notes, deciding what to ask him next.
doing here? With a turtle in your hands! Don’t you know you can’t take them off the water? They’re a protected species!"
He felt like all of Harry’s dreams merged together, like bread given to a starving man. WIth a frustrated noise, Draco snatched Harry’s hand off his cock and grasped it himself, lining it up with his hole, and lowering himself on it until the head slipped in.
Ron's voice called out, slightly muffled, from the Floo a second before vanishing. "And don't forget the potion!"
“So I take it I ruined your birthday surprise for me?” Harry mumbled a moment later, burying his nose in Draco’s hair on retreat.
It was getting hot under the Invisibility Cloak. Harry and Malfoy had come back to the night of the party at Luna, Rolf and Neville’s and between having to be careful not to touch or be touched, and whisper and walk amongst hoards of tipsy people, Harry was feeling irritable and sweaty.
“You know, in these last years I haven’t asked, I wanted to give you time, but… since you said that… why don’t you tell me something about your childhood here?”
Zabini looks uncertain for a moment but then he nods and stands to follow Harry out of the Great Hall. Whispers raise frantically as the two of them walk together, but Harry doesn’t care. He needs to know the truth.
The Time Machine broke? They did something wrong? Someone saw them and did something to get in their way? They had no clue. After hours of inconclusive talking, they decided to try and think about what they could do until they found a solution.
Shaking his head, Harry reached that door,  thinking to himself that he was probably in a Muggle hotel since Wizards were still reluctant to use electronic devices and happy his brain was starting to produce sensible thoughts.
"Err, nope."
Harry sticks his tongue out to Draco, feels his face heat up. “Well excuse me if the memories of last night distracted me.”
. It’s… intoxicating. Christ, Malfoy, I don’t know I’m that righteous man Ron seems to believe me.”
Being so far from home meant they had the time and opportunity to think through how to survive and they’d started some of their strongest traditions — staying in Muggle hotels, sharing a room with Boo-boo, finding a job, making the potion for Harry, glamouring themselves, buying new clothes for the time period and moreover there was Harry’s project to teach Malfoy about Muggle culture.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, will you shut up?!” Turning his head slightly, Draco could see that all the nearby guests were looking at them laughing, whispering to each other, pointing towards them.
He ran without apparent direction until his lungs hurt and he had to stop, bending at his waist, legs apart, hands on his knees. Closing his eyes, he tried to control his breathing again — inhale through his nostrils, hold three seconds, exhale through slightly parted lips. That’s what his therapist taught him.
together.
“Guess who’s fault that is… you didn’t give me a moment to catch my breath!” Draco’s hands slipped under Harry’s shirt, roaming over his chest, his stomach, and clenching his sides.
They were now standing face to face, so close Draco could feel Harry's breath ghosting on his lips, rendering him unable to think properly.
It made Harry look down at the poor mug in his hands— In another life, Harry would have probably become an Auror, but in this one he hadn’t. Because Harry had been so confused and angry after the War, and everyone,
He shivers, and it feels amazing inside him. “Move, fucking move!” he cries out.
You almost spill your drink over your shirt when you see him.
Malfoy’s eyebrows knitted together and Harry's went on. “No, I want to see it.”
Thankfully, after finishing the first bottle of wine, they had all started to chat and Draco was pleased to see his old friends were still interested in him, his life, how he was doing now. Draco always directed the conversations to their lives, to get to know what they were doing now and they easily took the hint, abandoning the topic of his isolation and bringing him up to date on their lives: Goyle was about to become a father, Nott had started dating Longbottom only a few weeks earlier — to utter disbelief of the entire table—, and Daphne and Astoria were opening a magical beauty centre.
"Harry, you know that's not how time travel works," Hermione admonished him, rolling her eyes.
“Oh Draco, do you like his neck, mh?”
, curry.
“Oh,” is all Harry can say when Draco’s words sink in. “How do you…?”
Draco exhaled slowly, relaxing in the view of the light trail of moisture that formed from his breath. Things with Potter
top quality. You’re clearly obsessed, though.”
“No, you git, I’m merely meditating right now.” Draco cracked one eye open and huffed. “Where’s Boo-boo?”
“You know, I always wanted a cuckoo clock when I was a kid. My Muggle relatives had a little one in the living room. Well, actually, my uncle bought it and then eventually my aunt screwed up the mechanism that made the bird sing. She said it gave her a terrible headache, but I found it relaxing. I knew time was passing by, that… I was still alive. Forgive me, I didn't mean to ruin the mood, but yeah, your cuckoo clock is beautiful.”
Malfoy jolted and grasped the broom, flicking his eyes up.
Harry looked as Malfoy's face drained of all colour — as if Malfoy's face could be any paler — and his jaw twitched in a visible effort to play along with Hermione's words. Malfoy’s lips stretched in an emotionless smile while Geremia's lips mouthed a silent 'wow'.
. Only thinking about those insinuations, got Draco all warm and tickly and oh no, no, no, this wasn’t at all the right moment for that goddamn tickle to appear…
?” Draco asked, scrambling for anything to say to try and cut the tension.
He never loses his patience now. His voice is always controlled, calm, toned down.
And apparently, neither had Ron or Malfoy themselves.
“I… what should I…” He glanced down at Malfoy, his rigid stance, the crease between his eyebrows. “Get up,” Harry commanded and watched as Malfoy visibly relaxed, his lips parting slightly as he hurried to stand up.
When Malfoy grasped Harry’s cock covering his hand and started pumping fast, he licked his ear, whispered, “Come for me, love”, and Harry knew he couldn’t hold it back anymore. He came, gasping out Draco’s name over and over again, soon followed by Malfoy, and the room was now filled with moans of Harry’s name too.
Everyone in the room seemed to be turning to look at them, pointing, whispering, someone laughing, the clicking of the cameras almost louder than the music. But Draco was only half-aware, concentrating only on the feeling of Potter’s body pressed against his, moving together sinuously on the notes of
He stopped to flash a bright grin to Harry, raising a knowing eyebrow.
He made love to her throughout his Veela awakening too, apparently.
Boo-boo nodded and zagged through the door, as Malfoy cast a
Little do they know that by the end of the school year, Harry will be walking back to his dormitory dreading the moment he’ll have to reveal his friends he lost his virginity to a Slytherin.
“I changed, Draco. As did you, it seems.” Potter smirked and picked up a cherry from the dish.
“Well, I asked you if you wanted to go out for a walk, you said yes and… I thought… you needed company, maybe.”
, what kind of thought was that one?
You’re undressing him in the Quidditch lockers, and you stop, amazed, as soon as his pants are out.
Astoria raised her glass and inclined it to Draco and Harry. “To a lifetime of happiness, eh?”
The morning after, Draco entered his lab yawning loudly. He was feeling the tiredness of the night before but the nice thing about Mexico was the relaxed attitude towards life of its inhabitants.
“Please tell me we didn’t just frot against a wall, coming in our pants like randy teenagers.”
“Fuck.” You almost miss him cursing, because you’re slamming your cock in him and by the time he’s talking, you’re balls-deep in him, your teeth scratching his ear shell. “Please,” he murmurs. “Please,” again. He’s begging you.
“Fuck, more Potter,
The first suggestion already made Harry realise that he was holding his breath and he hurried to release it at once. Right, oxygen helped clearing thoughts, Hermione had once told him.
“When…?” Potter said, hot breath ghosting over the wet trail. It really shouldn’t have been so hot and arousing; saliva was gross, but Draco must have lost his mind somewhere around the time when Potter was licking the damn salt off the glass.
And really, Harry's fifteen-year-old self would kick his arse right now for having such thoughts about his former school rival, but he couldn't help it. He spent years following Malfoy's every move, convinced he had to keep an eye on him, but Harry was starting to doubt his intentions.
Potter had grinned wickedly, the sight sending sparks throughout Draco’s body. “Damn right, Malfoy. Who would have known you’d be so wise, after all?”
Hermione smiled. “Oh, c’mon. It was preposterous for her to assume we were together only because we
—And when Harry presented as Veela, all those signs intensified. And then Malfoy started giving Harry
Harry stuck his tongue out at him. “Hey! I just
The finger on Harry’s hole slipped in, wet, til the first knuckle and then out again. Malfoy sucked on Harry’s cock, swirling his tongue on the shaft as the finger thrust back in, until it was completely buried in Harry’s arse.
Harry definitely didn’t belong with the second group. He didn’t blush every time Malfoy did so much as say an icy “Potter,” in the lift, and he definitely didn’t start stuttering when replying “M-Malfoy.” It was a little pathetic, actually, but Harry couldn’t help it.
Malfoy caught Harry’s eye and just stepped into the living room, silently approaching Teddy and sitting next to him. He made Teddy’s magical marbles dance around him, eliciting heartfelt laughter from him.
