have to say, the Mercury model is not the most dutiful and professional quill on the wizarding market. It is an absolute menace. It yanks the tail end of Draco’s g’s and un-dots
“Your magic will continue to fluctuate if you two do nothing!” Her frizzy hair bounces around her head like a brown halo as she scolds them. “It doesn’t matter if your actions are good or bad, the need for gratification will build and build until you satisfy it! It’s that or satisfy each other!”
“What’s my problem,” Potter repeats incredulous. “Did you miss the last twenty minutes or did you just block the whole thing out? You’re good at Occlumency, I wouldn’t put it past you.”
“Right.” Without another word she turns and stomps in the direction of the dormitories. “Harry!” Draco winces as she continues to shout, disappearing from sight.
“O-oh, yeah. Right. Okay.” Potter’s eyes still seem a bit glazed as he leads Draco towards his dorm. They’re at the top of a set of steep stairs, with an excellent view of the grounds through the high, round windows. Potter opens the door to a circular room with four four-poster beds similar to Draco’s own room. It’s a bit cozier, a little messier with the open trunks and owl cages and robes draped over every surface, but there’s a homey quality to it like the rest of the tower that Draco associates with Potter.
At the register, Draco daps at eyes. He blows his nose and wipes, careful of his nose and it’s tendency to turn red. He’s embarrassed beyond belief. Not to mention wildly confused as to why he felt the need to cry in the first place. He’d been angry in that moment — frustrated, annoyed. And while he known himself well enough to know he was capable of his fair share of strops, the suggestion of theft certainly wasn’t an occasion Draco felt merited
“Mmm,” Pansy hums over the rim of her drink, her eyes twinkling. “So this is what all that bickering has been about, eh?”
"Really?" Finnigan's face is a mixture of disturbed and surprised. Draco considers whether he ought to feel insulted on behalf of his friend. While not beautiful in a conventional sense, Millicent exudes a confidence that makes her far more attractive than many of the girls Draco's ever known, romantically or otherwise. He'd once been tempted to express this idea to Pansy, but rightly judged that she'd take it as a personal slight. Blaise had unknowingly been the one to fall upon that particular sword and Pansy had returned to them two weeks later, not with a renewed sense of assurance, but a newfound appreciation of muggle rhinoplasty.
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you,” quips Parvati, taking a generous dunk of ink. Draco mentally adds her name to the small list of obnoxious people in his life. It’s also the list of people in his life at all.
or if Potter was pronounced
The door of the open top carriage swings open.
As strange as it was, those simple words were really all Draco needed. He knew he could trust the words Harry was saying, because he never had been one to say or do things he wasn't genuinely feeling. It was a wonder, that kind of truthfulness wasn't as suffocating when it came from him -- chalk it up as another form of Gryffindor recklessness, always having his emotions on display.
"I have to go." He pushes through the door to the stairs and melts into the flow of witches and wizards moving up and down the steps. Potter doesn't follow.
Yet, despite the distraction, Draco can’t help but overhear:
"I know." Harry eyes are bright in the darkness, lids half-mast. "I know exactly what you're like."
Draco snorts, but doesn’t look up. “For what. Giving you another opportunity to show off?”
“Don’t bother.” Draco starts as Ernie draws up beside him, shaking the slush from his boots. “I’ve already tried asking how they work. She won’t let anyone get near the stuff.” Ernie points, and Draco follows his gaze to the long, green cords that disappear into a supply shed.
"Is that all?" He turns back to his horse. Draco is of half a mind to pick up his abandoned trowel and throw it at him.
“Hey.” Potter shoots him a shy smile before pulling his glass close to fill it with pumpkin juice. He’s wearing a maroon jumper today that somehow makes his bottle-green eyes pop even more in contrast, and Draco feels his heart skip. He can remember staring into them last night, rolling his hips again and again to feel Potter’s cock pressed against his own.
“Hello, hello. Bit nippy isn’t it? She rubs her gloved hands together. “Well. As you all know we’ve been discussing Father Christmas, and the associated muggle traditions associated with him.”
The old man steps back. If he looked alarmed before, he’s positively frightened now. Frantically he paws beneath the counter. Draco’s certain he’s searching for his wand. “I don’t know what you’re up to, but I’ve had just about enough!”
"I was sort of hoping Ron would be here," Potter sighs more to himself than the table at large, "but I guess he's been put on another rotation."
"Romilda Vane is a belligerent cow." Pansy raises her arms over her head, an open copy of
Draco feels his face heat as Harry turns back to the table to speak to the elf. Then he and Hermione are crossing the courtyard.
“Ye—” Draco clears his throat and tries again. “Yes.”
"That's not—" Potter jerks his head, rubbing right where Draco knows his scar lies hidden beneath his fringe. "I don’t expect you to understand."
“Just until Hangingbone gets back,” Potter murmurs, his voice thick. He stares at Draco from under impossibly long lashes and this close up, his eyes smolder. There’s a dull roar in Draco’s ears, the anticipation stuttering his breath as Potter’s hand slides over his waist, digs into the flesh of his side.
sentence.” Ernie flashes a joking smile from beneath his knit hat. “You don’t have to send it today.”
“It’s the man of the hour!” Blaise’s booming voice seems to fill the room. He vaults over one of the small end tables to stand in front of Draco, his arms spread. There’s confetti caught in his long beard.
there was a trip to
“I should,” Draco grumbles, crushing the paper. He pitches it into the wastebasket next to their bench. “Everyone leaves tomorrow and I still haven’t thought of a way of going back to the Manor.”
cake. Potter already invades his dreams. He’s universally loved and arguably the most famous wizard in Europe, if not the world. Draco would never be able to escape from him even if he wanted to. It makes it doubly impossible if they’ve got some kind of… magical
to visit.”
Witnesses agree that Malfoy’s influence was more than evident in the proceedings, as Potter did not deign to help a poor crying girl catch her lost crup, nor pose for photographs. However, candid shots reveal that the Death Eater’s thrall is strong, as evidenced by Potter’s glassy-eyed appearance and flushed skin. It is suspected that illegal potion use is at play. Connections have been made to the Malfoys and illegal potions rings in the past.
"I just thought I’d make sure." Draco sniffs, settling back in his chair. He smoothes a hand over the upholstery. "Wouldn't want anyone to get the wrong idea."
“Is it to your liking, Master Malfoy?”
When Draco pulls away, he’s dizzy. He has the absurd thought that he must be floating. Blinks heavily as another thought comes to him.
"I'm in recovery mode. Soft food, soft voices." Finnigan grins, although the gesture seems to cost him. He immediately cringes. "Took Dean out to The Veela's Touch until the wee hours, with the intention to sleep the rest of the day away. This is technically breakfast."
Jaw clenched, Draco hoists himself up, swinging his legs over the side of the bin to jump down "Hello, Lovegood."
“Truly a sacrifice on your part,” Potter says wryly.
Draco feels a bit of the tension bleed from his shoulders when Potter makes no qualms about sitting next to him, their knees knocking as he settles into a comfortable position. He leans forward to catch Draco’s eye. “Are you any good at this?”
"Hmm." There were quite a few delicious looking chocolate eclairs with his name on them. He buys them, along with Opal’s Pumpkin Pasty, and a few apple tarts for Theo as a last minute impulse. He does not think about Potter’s circumstances or the fact that there are no treacle tarts in the display case. "I guess this is where we make our pleasant goodbye."
Weasley scowls. “We’re not holding you hostage you know.”
Draco sags. He's been so caught up in his own drama. "Mother, I'm sorry. I'm sure he's fine. We can send Coopey to check on him."
“..Sensitive?” Draco increases the pressure of his lips, teasing with little nips that he soothes with the pad of his tongue as Potter trembles. Moves his hand from Draco’s arm to his waist. The darkness of the room makes Draco feel braver as he pushes Potter back onto his bed and straddles his lap. Potter’s bites out a command and the curtains full shut around them, enclosing them in the space of Potter’s bed, as he bucks his hips up.
"I'm a strategist, Draco. You're too intelligent not to know that much. And you're too intelligent to take these suppers at face value."
"They never served fish at Hogwarts. The elves are branching out."
you don’t have another.”
"I observe a lot of things," Harry looks up, chewing his lip thoughtfully. The stars are out, bordered by a canopy of trees. "For instance," he says, "do you realize this is our third(fourth?) dinner date? It's like we're going steady and we haven't even kissed."
Pansy shakes her head. "None of that explains why the Ministry insists that you do this. You’re in no danger of energy loss if you barely touch your wand." She stares intently at Draco, watching his face for confirmation. "So that does mean …"
Draco can feel his heart hammering in his chest, but he doesn’t dare cower under Potter’s intensity. Instead, he matches it with his own, leaning in just as close to lower his voice to a hiss. "Yes, that’s exactly what I think. Because you know me too."
Potter’s a bit slower to move over to him than Draco, but they squeeze in and Ernie scoots down to make room.
As if he can hear him, Harry pulls off and sits back on his haunches, chest rising and falling. Sweat slick hair stick to his forehead, his lips deliciously plump like Draco's cock is all he could ever want.
“Oh, don’t be so dramatic,” Blaise croons. “Look, I even have an early present for you, Malfoy. Consider this a truce.” Reaching into his own satchel, Blaise pulls out what looks like a thin leaflet with several pages. Draco leans in for a closer look. “A.. calendar?”
He doesn’t allow either of them to close the distances. Instead Draco dips his head and brushes his lips to Potter’s neck.
“Nothing—” Hangingbone looks up at him, utterly confused. “
, was vanished and followed by,
in anyone, no matter their gender, we would support you.” She finishes the last with a delicate sniff, but never breaks eye contact. Their gaze remains locked for a long moment, Draco trying to send all the gratitude and sheer
“How about some cushions,” Granger interrupts, elbowing him with a sharp look as she summons them with her wand. They settle on the floor while the Weasley girl throws herself onto the couch, socked feet dangling over the arm of the chair.
Focusing his magic in order to ignore Potter’s, Draco takes a deep breath, trailing his fingers along the shelves. Every book in his path hastily moves to crowd amongst themselves, going so far as to rearrange the letters on their spines, despite his stasis incantation. Draco drops his hand. The titles are now all indecipherable gibberish. He’s still not fast enough.
“I suppose the right thing doesn’t come naturally to me.”
Draco stops pulling books from his shelf long enough to fix Pansy with a dour look. "Do make yourself comfortable." The following Wednesday finds her strolling through his floo once again, accompanied by a sleeve of chocolate biscuits and a request to hear a full report of his weekend. Theo, unwilling to endure anything beyond the most basic notions of friendship (unless there was something in it for him), had hurriedly eaten his sweets and extracted himself, leaving Draco to bear the full brunt of Pansy’s questioning.
Draco’s mouth pulls into a smile. He slides a hand onto Harry’s hip, resting his chin in the crook of his shoulder. “I think you forgot something.”
“Find what you’re looking for?”
"Fuck. You."
“It’s sort of like a casting a Patronus, isn’t it?” Ernie murmurs to Draco. “Channeling your emotions to produce the results.”
"You’re leaving." Harry’s face is in shadow, his voice flat. The mattress creaks under Harry’s weight as he stands. "Is that really what you want?" He’s all warm skin and sleek muscle, the sheets forgotten on the bed.
"I just assumed it was up to me to pick up the slack."
Draco lifts a careless shoulder. “Does it matter? It’s errant magic. Thought I’d try my hand at something new, and as you can see, it was both unsuccessful
for my ego." She grumbled.
"Just give me a lemon one." Draco glanced over at him. "Do you still have those?" Draco slowly took the packet out of his pocket. When Harry opened it, all that was in there was lemon cigarettes. Draco tried not to stare at him as Harry lit his cigarette. Harry had always liked kissing Draco after he had smoked a lemon cigarette. He always thought Draco was just like a lemon. Sometimes sour. Sometimes sweet. Always delicious. Harry blew the smoke out slowly.
"Stop staring Potter. You're giving me the creeps." Draco said. Harry bit his bottom lip and stepped closer to Draco, taking a deep breath.
"Maria Zhang?" Ron said. "She's from Ravenclaw." Harry shrugged. He didn't even know who that was. "Fauna Thompson?" Harry shook his head.
"How about all those times you would shout at me across the entire hall to insult something about my appearance?" Harry said.
Draco was frowning at Harry. "Don't make that face." Harry said, shaking his head. The two boys were currently standing in Draco's room and Harry was pacing in front of Draco. Harry had just told the older boy how he had come out to his friends and Draco was excited for him, happy even, that is until Harry suggested that Draco come out to his friends as well.
"No." Harry said.
"So, be honest, my sister dumped you didn't she." Ron said.
"Pucey, from the Quidditch team." Ginny said. "He was one of the only players on the team who never tried to cheat. I would know, I analyzed their moves."
"No! No it's not! I can barely... I can't even
"Isn't Ron and Hermione
"Can I help you?" Pansy said, crossing her arms over her chest.
"I think it's really good of him." Luna said lightly.
"We've had too much to drink." Draco said finally, his brain coming up with a million excuses for this situation.
"Bloody hell." A voice muttered. The person turned to look at him and Harry's eyebrows furrowed together when he realized it was Draco Malfoy. "Potter." Draco said. There was a cigarette butt between his fingers that Harry hadn't noticed before. He slowly put it to his lips and took a long drag.
"Anything for you ex-boyfriend." Ginny said. Harry chuckled and slowly, the conversation drifted away from Harry and how unbelievably smiley he was at the moment. Harry slowly raised his head and looked out across to the Slytherin table. He locked eyes with Draco who looked like he had seen and heard everything by the smirk on his face. Harry almost waved but then decided that might look stupid. He settled for smiling instead and across the hall, Draco's heart skipped a beat.
Tears spring to his eyes.
Draco flicks under Harry's hood before swallowing him down, down, down. Harry's hands find their way into Draco's hair, guiding him up and down at an increasingly frantic pace. He moans as Potter bucks his hips, swallows noisily around him until Draco pulls off with a wet pop. He adds his hand, stroking, twisting his wrist with every downstroke until all Harry can do is moan.
Sorting Hat is the only one in the
Draco ducks his head, as the others smile, slowly removing the gifts he needs to wrap from his bag. He remembers Fred Weasley. This is only the second Christmas since his death -- a death Draco, no matter how roundabout, had a hand in. Even though he’s formally apologized, both in letter and in person, the cowardly side of himself would rather avoid the awkward reminder. His presence is likely reminder enough.
Draco purses his lips and reaches for his plate. "Shall I summon Karrey for another piece?"
Draco launches himself at Harry before he can think better of it, pressing his mouth to his with a ferocity that feels urgent, wild. It feels crazy when Harry doesn't rebuff him, dizzying when he returns Draco's kiss with an intensity that matches his own.
"You just happened to be assigned here tonight, did you?"
"If you'd actually done anything during the war, Theo, you could take my place. Suffer for me."
"Cow or not, you had lunch with her yesterday." He adds The Young Wizard’s Guide to Practical Potions to the growing stack of books at his feet. "And you didn’t even tell me until I brought her up." The next volume off the shelf is heavier, falling from his hands with a resounding thud.
to,” Parvati corrects, her olive skin flushing prettily. “Padma hasn’t decided what she wants to do and it’s likely to be our only chance to see each other now that she’s on the continent.”
Hangingbone confessed to everything. They’d sent a Patronus to McGonagall, who in turn met them halfway wrapped in her tartan dressing gown, complete with matching hair bonnet. Together, the three of them levitated the former Muggle Studies professor up to the Headmistress’ office. Aurors were summoned to take their statements and administer veritaserum. Flickwick had also been sent for to corroborate Hangingbone’s story and review the spell work placed on the hat. Once this was done, they were able to lift the curse off of Harry and Draco with next to no damage — at this point, they’d grown so used to balancing each other’s moods that it didn’t feel much different to their usual state.
that for him Harry. I refuse to let you do this to him." Pansy said.
"If anyone is being weird Potter, it's you." Draco said. Harry could feel a slight blush creeping up his cheeks.
"Shut up." Draco said.
"I'm not obsessed with him. He's a prat." Draco said in a calm voice. Pansy snorted, rolling her eyes a little. Blaise didn't even look at her.
"Most things you do are my business since, you know, we live together." Harry said. Draco smiled broadly. For the past month, Harry had been unable to stop bringing up the fact that the two of them lived together. He was always slipping this fact into every conversation they had together and every conversation with their friends. It drove everyone except Draco absolutely nuts. Hearing Harry say that they live together comforted Draco. It was something he had always fantasized about, a plain, boring, domestic relationship with Harry Potter.
"What he wanted was to kill me." Harry said.
to be around me." Ron huffed. Hermione touched his arm lightly.
It was well past curfew but per usual, Harry couldn't sleep. Everything was far too loud and Harry needed to get his head space cleared out. He certainly couldn't do that with the other Gryffindor boys snoring up a storm. Just being in a room full of sleeping people, wishing you were one of them, was torture for Harry. He needed to get out. He needed to go somewhere quiet. And so Harry went where he always did, the mostly abandoned North Tower.
." Ron said, waving his arms vigorously to get them to stop talking.
"I never thought he would be able to." Draco muttered. "You're fucking Harry Potter. Some nasty, old wizard wouldn't be able to kill you. If anyone was going to do that, it would be me." Harry's lips twitched up in a slight smirk. Draco swallowed hard.
." Draco said, sipping his tea.
"I used to eat grass because I thought it was just like any other vegetable, green and gross."
"No but... I've had Voldemort breathing down my neck for years and... So have you so I'm sorry." Harry said. Draco rolled his eyes.
"All I'm saying is, I want to make sure that whoever this girl is, they have Harry's best intentions and they're not dating him simply because he was the Chosen One." Ginny said with a nod of her head. Harry sighed.
. I'm sorry. Will you let me explain?" Draco said. Harry looked up at him. Draco wasn't someone Harry would characterize as someone who would beg but right now that's exactly what he was doing, pleading for Harry to talk to him. There was this fragility and softness in his grey eyes that Harry didn't want to say no too. So he didn't.
"You can but there's got to be a reason. All last week you were frightful and now you're little miss sunshine." Pansy said with an air of distaste.
"I can't believe..." Draco had goosebumps up and down his arm. He wasn't sure if he was simply shocked or scared. Why would his mother do that? Is that why they were trying to hustle him away when Harry jumped back to life? Voldemort would know she lied and then... "Why would she do that! Voldemort could have..."
"Quit fussing. They won't see us." Harry murmured against his neck as he continued to leave a hickey on Draco's pale skin. Draco bit down on his bottom lip, preventing a groan from escaping his lips. The voice in the hallway drifted away and then vanished. But Draco was still on edge. When Harry pulled back, smiling at Draco he was met by a steely cold glare.
"I just like the smell of it." He said lightly.
"I don't think so." Draco swallowed hard and while Harry fell asleep almost instantly, Draco took a while longer to clear his thoughts.
"It doesn't concern them." Draco said. That's when he had frowned, both of their good moods slightly soured now.
"We'll talk about it tomorrow." Harry said with a laugh. "Goodnight Draco."
"Of who?" Hermione said. Harry laughed.
"I don't know who." She cried. "Some Gryffindor boys. They made fun of me because... Because of my parents and my house and they spelled my hair and took my books." Draco nodded slowly.
"So aggressive." Harry said with a grin.
because it makes me feel better about the fact that my boyfriend plays for both teams and could potentially leave me for literally anyone who suits his fancy and..." Draco would've continued but Harry chuckled.
"No. I'll just make sure Pansy's around. At the very least she'll pry him off me if he tries to beat me to a pulp." Draco said. Harry kissed his cheek.
"He's not that bad honestly." Harry said.
"Of course it does." Draco said, sitting next to Harry. "But the fear of what my friends, my parents might say to me is
"What?" Draco said in a deadpan voice, hoping Blaise hadn't heard him humming. No such luck.
"I'll think about it." Harry said with a laugh. The Headmistress nodded and turned to leave. "Umm.. McGonagall?" Harry asked. She glanced back at him. "Earlier, when I was in the corridor... Did someone run past you. I thought I saw...." Harry stopped, feeling stupid.
"If you must know... I was dating Draco and we broke up." Harry said. Hermione's eyebrows shot up and Ron's jaw dropped.
"Draco, come on." Hermione said. Draco looked frozen to his spot, staring at the ground. "Draco we're not leaving you out here. Now come here now. Pansy will kill us if we leave the forest without you."
"Are you real?" Draco breathed out. Harry walked over and kneeled down next to Draco, pushing Draco's hair back lightly.
"Well good, now we can set you up with someone that isn't my sister." Hermione threw a pillow at Ron. "What! I can't talk to Harry about girls if he's dating my sister. That's gross." Ron said.
"You know how I told my parents about... Myself. Last week." Harry nodded. "Well I've just been thinking about that and you and how... They wouldn't approve and neither would your parents if we're being honest. They'd probably want to kill me." Harry laughed.
"No it's not. I'm not leaving the two of them with you. You don't need them badgering about something that's
"I'm taking mental notes as we speak.
... How did you even..."
"Harry is part of the family." Mrs. Weasley insisted.
"You better be sorry because I..." Ron said but Hermione put her hand over her boyfriends mouth.
"Yeah well Harry can fuck off for all I care. I'm not going to apologize for hating Malfoy or any of them." Ron said.
Not much later though, Draco would find out just how right Harry actually was.
"No. I don't care what he's doing or not doing." Harry said.
you. You're still in pain. You said this is going to happen for the rest of your goddamn life." Harry said.
But no matter how pretty Harry thought her smile was, that spark they thought they had was no longer there and they both knew it.
"Oh yeah, what's the reason I asked that question then?" Draco said.
"I'll think about it." Harry said and before Pansy could call him a prat, he slipped out of the room.
spell.
"Might as well. I should find us a proper bed." Harry had laughed but Draco had been a tiny bit serious. He hated sleeping alone in his Slytherin dorm. He always had nightmares. Even though there were two perfectly good chairs, Harry seemed to prefer the soft faux fur rug and pillows.
"Draco's happiness is no concern of mine." Harry said. And it was the truth. Draco's happiness wasn't something he tried to think about anymore. Harry could see that he was unhappy. Hell, the happiest he had seen him in days was when he had first opened his eyes in the Forbidden Forest and Draco was leaning over him, trying to use warming spells on him. It immediately took Harry back to that first night they had gone into the Forbidden Forest together and Draco cast a warming spell on him. That was the first time Harry's heart had skipped a beat when Draco was looking at him. Pansy laughed.
"Don't talk like that. Nothing is going to happen to us Harry.
"Well, I'm taking it as a compliment." Draco picked himself up off the side of the wall and walked forward. "I'm a rubbish teacher."
"Exactly,
"Are we being precise now?" Draco said.
"Of course I knew. I'm not an idiot. I recognized your voice and you left your stupid glasses on your face." Draco said, rolling his eyes and pulling Harry's glasses off his face. Harry blushed red and watched Draco put on his glasses. He looked... Hot. Harry had always thought his glasses made him look a little geeky but Draco somehow managed to rock the style. "God you have dreadful eyesight." Draco said, taking the glasses back off and handing them to Harry who chuckled.
"I'd rather choke." Ron said. Hermione snorted.
"Then what did you call me?" Harry said.
"Nothing. I was trying to wake you up. I kept poking you." Harry said. Draco yawned as Harry spoke and nearly made Harry yawn as well.
"No I think you look pretty cute when you orgasm too." Draco shoved Harry's shoulder as the dark haired boy laughed, his tea sloshing out of the cup a little. "Hey, this rug is nice Draco."
"I wish I had just taken the cup when Cedric offered. I wish I had been alone in that graveyard. If I was... Cedric would still be here." Harry didn't realize he was crying until Draco rubbed at his cheeks.
inside that castle okay! Is that a good enough fuckin' answer?" Draco's face was red with anger and Harry felt a weird moment of déjà vu. This was the Draco that Harry recognized.
"I know. I'm sorry for... Pushing. I was just happy and I wanted you to feel the same way." Harry said. Draco exhaled heavily and squeezed Harry's hand.
"Why? Do I only look cute when I'm concentrating or something?"
, us?" Draco asked with a sigh.
"But I mean it." Draco said, squeezing Harry's hand, voice low. "I'm sorry I tried to tell you that you shouldn't feel like this."
"I'm not. I don't know if I would forgive me if I was you." Harry said. "And you forgave me at least mostly... Before we even tried to become friends Draco. You're a
... I'll hex you so badly, your grandchildren will feel it." She threatened before walking away to go find Blaise. Hermione and Ron said nothing, just stared at Draco as he continued to sit up against the wall. Hermione eventually sighed and sat down in front of him, crossing her legs. Ron grudgingly sat next to her.
It used to be natural for Draco to search for Harry in a crowd of people. The reason used to be so Draco could taunt or tease Harry in some way but now... Draco was looking for him because he desperately wanted to talk to him at all hours or the day and the thought absolutely horrified him. The knowledge that Harry wanted to talk to Draco too didn't comfort him though.
"Twat." Draco fired back. Harry was still laughing and Draco was straining, fighting the urge to lean in and kiss the stupid boy beneath him.
"No it's not. It's what anyone would do if they saw a little girl crying." Ron said.
"Don't leave." Draco finally said, sitting up and frowning at Harry. His hair was even messier from sleep and his eyes were barely open. Harry thought he looked completely adorable as he pouted.
"Harry what are you saying?" Ron said.
"It's an acronym Luna. Bring Your Own Booze." Harry said,
"I'm still not convinced he talks to Scarface." Pansy said airily.
"If I was shagging someone, I would brag about it." Pansy scowled. "Leave me alone. I can't be genuinely happy for once in my miserable life?" Draco asked.
"What? It's true isn't it." Pansy said looking at Harry with part innocence, part know-it-all attitude.
"Oh come now." Draco said. "Being a Slytherin is fun."
"Over my dead body." Draco growled at him. He actually growled. Harry almost laughed.
"How would you know?" Draco said. "You're always at Pansy's dorm breaking the rules. How did you even manage to unspell the doorknobs?" Draco said. Blaise was a powerful wizard without even trying. It sometimes made Draco jealous but not all the time.
"Y-you what?" Pansy said.
"Well how about you leave me alone for tonight." Draco said. "I left you alone with your thoughts last time so it's your turn to do the same."
"Because I'm not used to us not talking, even if we are just at each others throats." Harry said.  Draco looked over at Harry in half surprise. Is that really how the
"Malfoy I swear..." Pansy began. Draco muttered something Harry couldn't hear and Pansy scoffed before taking three steps back and taking slow even breaths. Blaise swallowed hard as he did the same. Malfoy turned around and stepped away from the golden trio. His face was void of all emotion.
. I want you all to myself. My father doesn't even know about me. Though... He'll probably know soon." Draco said, shaking his head. "He's still got dreams of little blond kids running around that look like me."
"We just... Draco we've looked everywhere for him. It's been two days and we're worried. Is there anywhere you can think of that he would be? Places you would meet?"
"My whole life was pretty sad up until I turned ten." Harry said. Draco took the bottle of firewhiskey back from him and took a drink, staring at Harry the whole time.
"I'm not the worst." Harry said.
"Trying to get me in trouble by making bird notes fly around me?" Harry said.
"What were you thinking about?" Harry said.
"I think my boyfriend just broke up with me." Blaise and Pansy shared a look as Draco slowly took a sip of tea with shaky hands.
"I... no." Harry said.
"Are you insane?" Draco said, wondering why he was getting so worked up over three little words. "Me? Do you know who you're talking to?"
"I... I don't like to think about it." Harry said softly, touching one of the small scars, his thumb running over the bumpy ridge.
"Have you been... Talking to Malfoy?" Hermione asked slowly at dinner. Everyone looked to Harry who shrugged lightly.
"I think so... At least McGonagall thinks it's a good idea. I have to take a couple classes but I think it's a done deal."
"You put a bow on your head and said Merry Christmas you bastard."
lie to us!" Hermione shouted. "Come back to Hogwarts right now or I'll make you Harry Potter! I'll drag you kicking and screaming." Hermione said, eyes bleary with tears.
"Are you sure?" Ginny asked. "That's your..." Ron put his hands over his ears.
A few days later, up in their tower together as they sipped peach tea, a package which Draco had finally mustered up the courage to steal, Draco asked Harry a question. "Have you figured yourself out yet?" Harry glanced up at Draco as he stirred sugar into his cup.
"That's rather dramatic of you." Hermione said. Ron sighed and stood up.
"Well it was well deserved. Honestly, the state of your hair sometimes Potter." Draco said, trying to think up excuses.
"Why?" Harry said.
"It is a step up." Ginny said with a sigh. Harry looked to Draco again. He was still staring at Harry, clearly ignoring whatever Pansy was saying.
"Well, when you do have kids Mr. Potter, please don't name one after your dad." Harry eyed her quizzically. "Another James Potter around here might just kill me." Harry snorted and started to laugh. He hadn't done that in quite some time.
She was... Inconsolable."
"Hello." Draco said. Harry smiled.
"Don't ask about Blaise while I'm trying to kiss you." He said as Harry laughed. "He's off with Pansy doing heaven knows what which is exactly what we should be doing." Draco said. Harry could tell Draco was teasing him as they kissing again but... Harry actually wasn't opposed to the idea of doing
Harry ran down the hallway again, determined to catch up or get a closer look at the person to see if it really was Draco or not. Instead, when he turned the corner, he found Headmistress McGonagall standing in the middle of the hallway, orbs of light floating around her as she moved through the corridor. She locked eyes with him immediately and Harry paused, wondering if she would yell at him. McGonagall came to a stop in front of him. "Well, Mr. Potter?" The Headmistress asked. Harry sighed and looked away.
"I'm not avoiding you. I'm busy." Draco said.
"I was trying to downplay it so I wouldn't freak them out." Harry said. "But Ron was pissed anyways." Harry pursed his lips.
"Oh fuck was he in the room that night I burst in on you?" Blaise demanded.
Had they really been together for over a month? It didn't seem real sometimes, at least not to Draco. Sometimes he expected to wake up from some crazily long dream and be completely devastated if Harry treated him with cold, unwavering indifference. Harry was good at that. And Draco wasn't entirely sure if he could say that they were "together" if their relationship consisted mostly of them sneaking around at odd hours of the night and day. It was especially hard for Draco to consider that they were "together" because they had barely been friends for three months. Harry couldn't just decide to like Draco now after years of them hating each other. It was just... It didn't sound right at all.
"How would you know Potter." Harry sighed slightly. Draco was going to insult him, he could feel it. "Can you even see anything with your stupid hair in your face?" Then Draco did something neither of them expected. He pushed Harry's hair out of his face so that it swept back lazily across his head, exposing his large lightning shaped scar. "Besides that, you have awful vision Harry."
"So... When do you and Malfoy hangout?" Neville asked, confused. "I've never seen you two together." Harry shrugged.
"Sine sensu." Harry said. Draco wrinkled his nose and Harry knew he had said it wrong.
time. Can't be much of a Chosen One if you loose to someone like me." Draco said. Harry shook his head.
"Is she right?" Seamus said. "Did you kiss someone?"
"You're not acting... Like yourself." Suddenly Harry felt very stupid. What a stupid thing to say.
Harry. You were fucking dead. Hagrid carried your limp body into that courtyard and I
"I'm gonna be sick." Ron said. Hermione rolled her eyes and rubbed her boyfriends back lightly.
"If you haven't killed me in the past seven years Draco, I doubt you're going to do it now." Harry said.
"Well I don't." Draco said.
"Don't follow me Potter, I mean it. I swear to god." Harry paused at the top of the stairs, seeing the savage look in Draco's eyes.
"Because you have them and clearly have a lot of anxiety." Draco rolled his eyes.
"Probably off brooding somewhere." Draco said. Harry snickered. "It's true. I brood in towers a lot."
"Harry, lets go talk to the Headmistress." Hermione said.
you saw me." Draco said.
"Good." He said.
"Yes, that's it. Unless you
"You never read a
"Yeah, I know. Bye Draco." Draco half raised his hand in a goodbye gesture, not bothering to turn around. When he heard the tower door close, he exhaled quickly, the tension in his shoulders dropping. He hadn't realized he had been holding his breath. And as Harry headed down the stairs, he tried to figure out why exactly his heart was racing in his chest. It used to be because Draco was a big anxiety to him but Harry had gotten over that feeling. This must have been something else. Shaking his head, Harry chalked it up to the excitement of learning a new spell.
"I will."
"Oh whatever, he knows what I mean." Ginny said with a shrug. "I'm not entirely sure about the whole, Draco fought for our side since I didn't see it myself..." Ginny said.
?" Harry was unsure what to say. "If I was you... I would've just..." Draco made an evaporating sort of motion with his hand.
. Happier than I've seen him in a long time and I couldn't figure out why and then suddenly... He's back to his old self and I don't
"Hey, you're late." Draco laughed as he stared down at Harry who was lying on the ground. The two of them had slowly made this tower into their own little space. Harry had started bringing (stealing Draco called it) different items from god only knows where and putting it into the room to make it a little more comfortable. The first couple of things were small, a rug for the floor and some pillows so they weren't always sitting on the cold hard ground but Draco said if they were going to spruce this place up, they might as well do it correctly.
. He didn't even like to hear the spells name in his own head.
"They're just sitting there Ron. Keep your voice down. Don't start something." Harry said. Ron had been drinking nonstop since they arrived. He was pissed that they were here "ruining" everything even though they hadn't done anything except arrive.
"That wasn't what I was doing!" Draco snapped at him. Harry snickered and Draco kicked him. Blaise didn't seem to notice any of this as he rummaged through his drawers.
shouted my name. I thought Hogwarts was being attacked again." Harry said, rolling his eyes.
"Why do you think?" Draco said with a scoff before tossing the butt of the cigarette onto the stone ground and then jumping off the window ledge. Harry watched him grind the cigarette butt under his heel before casting a small spell to close the window.
"I still win." Draco said.
"I did hate you Harry and I couldn't believe that... I scared you enough to make you use..." Draco bit his bottom lip. "I tried to use that as fuel to help me get over you. I kept thinking...
"Don't be stupid."
"I hurt you. I almost killed you. I shouldn't be with you." Harry said.
. I'm sorry you had to go through that." Harry arched an eyebrow at Draco.
"I'm not spelled!" He said with a shake of his head. "I promise. I... I told you guys I was bisexual."
"I know." Draco said.
"Why would you want to do that?" Draco said with a frown.
"No it's not."
"Voldemort told you to find it. To stop me." Harry said. Draco scoffed.
"Sounds like a great story already." Hermione called out with a laugh.
"Maybe you should have. Sometimes I feel like I
"You want to know if I've figured out if I'm gay." Harry said with a grin.
Not because he didn't think Ron wouldn't understand but because... Even if Hermione didn't understand at least she would be calm about it and not be completely dramatic and aghast like Ron might be. Problem was, the three of them were always together. How was Harry supposed to talk to Hermione without Ron being there?
"You're better at me in loads of things." Harry said.
"That's it?" Ron asked with a smirk. Harry swallowed hard.
"I still think you should apologize to Weasley." Draco said. Pansy huffed.
"I didn't choose you! It wasn't about
"I actually didn't have nightmares for once last night." Draco said. Harry paused and looked up at Draco who stopped with him. Harry smiled widely.
"Well are you shagging someone?" Blaise asked. Draco shot Pansy a look. She knew about Draco's preferences but Blaise didn't. Draco didn't think Blaise could handle that much... Change in one year.
"No but that's not the point. Whose side are you both on. Are we defending Draco Malfoy? Malfoy? Seriously?" Ron said, looking to Harry.
"I... I refuse to be an experiment Harry." Harry cocked his head, giving Draco his signature look of complete confusion. "I'm not going to be your gay experiment Harry. I'm a god damn human being. I don't want you to try to figure yourself out with me and then reject me because you realize this isn't for you."
"Why else would I be asking?" Draco shrugged. They had only gone on one date and that had only been this past Saturday. Unless... did making out in random hallways and hanging out in this tower count as dates to Harry? Draco wasn't sure what to consider any of this honestly. He still hadn't convinced himself that this was all happening. It just seemed... Weird sometimes.
"I don't see why you won't let us just..." Pansy scoffed and shook her head.
"He just said he's... Done. He's tired." Harry said.
believe in and she believed in this place a hell of a lot more than I did unfortunately." Harry was surprised to see Pansy a little misty-eyed. "Don't you dare erase her death. She
She had said once.
"Aurora Cruz?"
"I knew you had to win at
"I... Dumbledore was there. You don't have to believe me but it's true. Or at least... It was my mind trying to reconcile everything." Harry said slowly. "I can't be sure." Draco blew smoke out, the lemon scent washing over Harry.
"Thanks Gin."
hard.
Speak of the devil.
"Someone's feeling brave." Harry said.
. We need to ask you something." Hermione said, ignoring Pansy.
"Yes, it would be funny. Now repeat after me." For the next minute, Draco and Harry mimicked one another in the pronunciation of
'"Is this a bloody Q and A?" Percy asked. Harry shrugged but even Ginny was giving him a look.
"Why don't you finish your homework. I know you have some." Hermione said.
"Sorry." Harry murmured.
"I'm sorry. You know I am. I apologized Harry." Hermione sounded like she was about to hyperventilate. Harry shook his head.
Isn't it funny how both Cedric and Draco have canonically grey eyes????? Grey eyes aren't that common so for two of Rowling's characters to have them is wild. I also just think it speaks to the type of guy Harry is attracted too lol.
"What?" Draco asked.
"Well don't intend to have a bad dream Potter." Draco said with a sigh. Harry smiled.
"Oh come on. There had to be
"But I saw.. Well I heard... Your parents were calling for you. Your mother was crying. Even if I wasn't dead why come back and fight for Hogwarts?" Harry said.
"Don't." Draco snapped at him, knowing what Harry was going to say next.
"All I'm saying is... If Draco says he's different, then I believe him. I don't think he's the enemy anymore and we should recognize that." Luna said. Ginny laughed a bit sarcastically, looking to Harry.
"Fine, I'll do it."
"There's giant spiders out there?" Draco said, looking startled by the notion. Harry looked at Draco funny.
"Good thing you're so fit then right?" Draco scowled.
"I was not rambling I was telling you how I felt and you interrupted me." Draco said with a frown as Harry finished cleaning up the tea. Harry chuckled again.
"What does that even mean?" Harry said.
"No but... I've noticed you're not here sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night. I've also heard you... Sneak out before. I just want to know where you're going." Ron said.
"You're such a loser." Draco said.
"I'm pretty sure that's not one of the commandments Ginny." Neville said lightly.
"I knew it!" Ginny exclaimed.
"It's the hair." Draco said with a small cough. Harry took the cigarette from him and put it to his lips. Draco watched him inhale lightly, blowing smoke out his nose a little as he exhaled.
"Draco I'm sorry okay."
"Okay, this Saturday then?" Harry said.
"Why... Why didn't you tell me before now though?" Harry said.
"Never thought I'd cry in front of my arch-nemesis." Harry said teasingly. Draco rolled his eyes.
have put Cedric's life at risk like that." Harry said.
"I've known you since you were twelve Harry. You're terrible at lying." Harry sighed.
"Of course." Draco said. Harry huffed.
"You're
"I... I didn't know what you would like." Draco said. Harry was surprised to see how hard Draco was blushing. He smiled widely and reached out to brush some of Draco's hair out of his eyes. Draco looked up at him nervously.
"What about you Weasley. Don't you have somewhere to be?" Draco said. Ron scowled at the ground.
"Every week. She... Worries." Draco said. Harry nodded, squeezed Draco's hand one last time and took up another sandwich.
"Really Ron? Everyone would stop to help her?" Hermione asked. Ron hesitated to reply.
the war. We're just teenagers Ron. We shouldn't have had to fight for
"Wow, look at you. Didn't know you were into the whole bad girl vibe. She's got you smoking and soon you'll be wearing leather jackets and slicking back your hair." Harry laughed lightly, shaking his head.
"Probably." Harry said. Draco snorted and shifted around in the windowsill so he was no longer hanging all the way out of it. He put one leg back into the tower and then the other. Harry backed away from him a little as Draco stood up.
if someone tried to fix it." Harry said with a cheeky grin. Draco looked away from him.
"I talked to other people that weren't Slytherin you know." Draco said. Harry didn't really know. Draco sighed. "Whatever. I told Reginald not to invite us. He did. I went to keep Pansy in line. If Ron hadn't tried to..." Draco paused. He knew blaming Ron wouldn't be a smart thing to say to his best friend who was now half glaring at him. "It doesn't matter though. Ron probably hates us even more now."
"It's nothing bad." Harry said.
"I heard Teddy has taken quite a liking to you." Harry smiled softly.
"Okay but Hermione was never your girlfriend." Draco grumbled. Harry kissed his temple with a smile as the doorbell rang.
"Honestly Harry, you're so oblivious sometimes. Penelope is the girl with the big eyes and dark hair. She's a Ravenclaw." Harry vaguely recalled a small girl with a shy smile and frowned at himself for not knowing her name. He'd known her since year two.
"Are you sure?" Harry half smiled and Draco arched an eyebrow at him.
"Zabini." Draco said, turning around on the couch. Blaise turned to look at him. "Your sister. What's your mom planning on naming her?"
"I love you Harry." Harry smiled and pulled the covers up to his chin.
"My friends figured out that I've been... Sneaking around and seeing someone." Harry said.
"How?" Draco said with a roll of his eyes, still trying desperately to pick his arms up from the table.
"They were being a bunch of prats anyways." Blaise muttered out. "I don't know why you even converse with Potter." There was that singing feeling again. Blaise was frowning at his book.
"You call this being nice? I'm moments away from hexing you Potter. Don't bother me." Draco snapped at him. Harry frowned. Why was Draco being difficult all of a sudden. They'd been fine for over a month now. What was with all the defensiveness?
"We'll just have to get her to leave." Ron said. Without waiting for a reply, Ron marched over to them. Draco saw them approach but didn't acknowledge their presence.
"Seriously what?" Draco said as Harry slowly took the bottle back from him.
"If none of it's true why does it matter to you if I'm being loud?" Pansy demanded, crossing her arms over her chest.
"I uhh... I should get going." Draco said lightly. "Don't you have somewhere to be?"
make me." Draco felt that familiar singe of Harry's magic. Draco wanted to say he didn't want Harry to take it back he just... He wanted to make sure that Harry was positive. He didn't want to hear Harry say I love you, only for him not to mean it in a couple days... Weeks... Months... Surely they wouldn't last that long. Harry would figure out he didn't like snogging Draco. Maybe he'd figure out he didn't like snogging boys at all and then... Then this will be over and Draco would be all alone again.
"So have I." Harry murmured, pushing Draco's hair out of his eyes. Together, they stubbed out their cigarettes and stood and hand in hand, they walked out of their tower.
"I said it would." Draco said, turning and walking a bit away from him. Harry took another drag on his cigarette, deciding he liked the blueberry flavor the best, the other flavors be damned. "So tell me Potter, if you really died, why come back to this fucking place." Draco asked.
"Yes." Harry said with a smirk.
"Hermione hated what I did to you." Harry said, surprising Draco. "I mean, I already hated myself. I thought I was going to watch you bleed out and I was just... Petrified with fear. I didn't even try to help you Draco I was so fucking scared that I had just killed you. I... I had never seen you cry before." Harry said lightly. "Hermione called me a monster. She said I was like Voldemort after I explained what happened."
"Sounds like a date." Harry said. Draco smiled wider.
"Really? Dating her is what has completely confirmed for me that I'm into girls." Blaise said. Draco started to laugh loudly and soon, Blaise joined in as Pansy started to punch both of them in the chest.
heard you hum." Blaise said.
"I wish things had happened differently too." Harry half smiled at her. "But honestly, dating you didn't live up to the hype." Ginny and Harry laughed together. That's something that Harry really liked about Ginny, she could always make him laugh.
"Aren't they though? Didn't all of them try to help me? Weren't they around me just because of my parents sacrifice? Because of this fucking scar?" Harry demanded, pointing at his forehead. "Sometimes I just want to..." Hermione stood swiftly.
"If Ron were here, I'm sure he'd think I'd done something to you, slipped you a love potion or casted some sort of spell on you." Draco said watching Harry pick up a sandwich and bite into it.
"What the hell are you doing?" Harry asked, his tone accusing. Draco frowned.
for you. That's not what..."
"Draco where..." Hermione began to demand.
"Why should I? I meant it." Pansy said with a slight roll of her eyes. Draco knew she was partly lying which gave him hope. It was actually Blaise that Draco worried about the most. The older boy had become even more distant and restrained since Goyle had died. Draco had tried talking to him about it before but it was like... Draco could feel Blaise's magic leaking out of him in angry waves. Blaise wouldn't even be holding his wand and Draco would be singed by his magic. Sometimes a wizard can be... Just that powerful. Being around Voldemort had felt like that, only on a stronger level. Sometimes when Draco was around Voldemort he felt like he was being burned alive. Sometimes it would leave smoking holes in the clothes of his Death Eaters.
"I'm not avoiding you." Draco said, glaring at Harry.
"We could sell the story to Rita, make some money." Harry said. Draco chuckled.
"You disarmed me asked me to..." Draco shook his head. Harry remembered. He asked Draco to not do this, to just let them take the diadem. "Goyle was always a little more... Trigger happy. He casted
"I'm just curious is all." Ron said. "Who could be better than my sister?"
"Holt shit." Harry said, unsure of what to do. One second he's kissing Draco, wondering what's going to happen next and suddenly, Draco is wincing, pulling away and suddenly has several small cuts on his chest, all of them seeping blood. Harry fumbled for his wand on Draco's nightstand behind him as Draco grabbed his own on his bed. "Are you okay? What happened? Let me see." Harry touched Draco's bare chest lightly and normally, Draco would've been thrilled but he didn't want to have to explain this to Harry. He didn't want him to know what this was.
"Fucking
"Oh come off it 'Mione." Ron complained. He stood and stumbled a little and Hermione sighed.
"Why did you choose me over your family?"
"I do." Harry said. Draco tried not to blush. "Tonight?"
"I didn't have bad dreams either." Harry said.
"I didn't say anything." Harry said.
"That would be funny to see." Harry whispered to Draco, sending a shiver down his spine. God, Harry hadn't even really said anything and he had Draco squirming.
"Why not!" Harry said a bit too loudly, flabbergasted. Draco shook his head and turned back to face Harry.
"There's nothing else to say." Harry said, starting to walk away. Hermione grabbed his arm.
for Harry. She died for
notice's Harry.
"Should have cast a warmth spell." Draco said, pulling out his wand. Harry shrugged.
"I have to tell you something Blaise." The taller boy barely looked over at him. "Blaise." Draco said, more insistent this time.
"In... Like what-" Harry fumbled for the right words.
"It's been a week Draco. Can we please talk about what happened in the tower?" Harry said.
"Malfoy." Harry said. Draco had already finished his cigarette. He dropped the butt to the ground and stomped out the fire again.
"Hush up." Pansy said. Harry rolled his eyes. "Draco needed to let some things out and I don't know how we got on the subject exactly but..." Pansy paused. "Harry, Draco basically told me that he believed the only way he could ever be happy
"I didn't get that far. I... I talked to Dumbledore and then..." I said. Draco started to laugh.
"I mean... You're their son. It does concern them." Harry said.
"My life has always been like this Draco. I should have
Where even was Harry in the first place?
"Could've fooled me." He grumbled. "Last time we were there, Ronald glared at me the whole night and your first and last girlfriend bombarded me with questions and accusations and..."
I couldn't do that and I didn't want to stop loving you. I'd invested too much of myself in you, in wanting to be around you, wanting to talk to you... The only way I could come to terms with this was... If I started to forgive you."
for something more." Harry was really blushing now. Draco swore his scar was changing color.
"Can we head back inside? I'm freezing my ass off here." Harry said.
"Maybe I want some creepy crawly to kill me Harry. I don't know. I just felt like I was
"Shut up." Harry held out the cup of tea to Draco who closed his book and took it with a smile.
"Draco..." Harry said, standing now as well as Draco grabbed his cloak off the ground from where he had tossed it earlier.
close to that spiteful look Draco would always get when talking to Harry. It was more like slight annoyance or displeasure.
"Shut up. Let me do this." Harry said, looking up at Draco. Draco shut his mouth as Harry kissed down his chest. Draco was breathing fast, chest rising and falling quickly as he ran his hands through Harry's wild, dark hair.
"I told Reg not to invite us." Draco said, running one hand through his hair. "I knew once Pansy found out about it she would want to go out of spite, Blaise too."
"Oh." Harry said. Draco shook his head. "Well... Sorry for thinking otherwise then." Harry smiled sheepishly and Draco grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and pulled him closer.
"What do you mean you knew?" Harry and Ron said in unison.
"I have not!" He said indignantly.
"You're entitled to your privacy." Hermione said. "We won't pry their name out of you. Right Ronald?" Hermione demanded, half glaring at the redhead. Ron rolled his eyes and Hermione took her hand away.
"I'm glad we're friends."
"I did it!" Harry said excitedly.
than us." Ron said with a scowl. "Why did they even come back? Why did McGonagall allow this?" Nobody had any good answers. "The Slytherins are bad.
"Adelaide Murton was a friend of mine before she left two years back." Luna said lightly. "She cursed out some rather... Ruder older boys from her house so they would leave me alone." Ron didn't look impressed.
"You don't mean that." Harry said.
"I mean... I'm not sure but I think I remember him making a joke about it once..." Neville thought for a moment and shrugged. "Can't be sure honestly."
"Yes you are." Ginny retorted. "What about that time I told you not to tell Ron about..."
"Well if he's not gonna say it I will!" Ron said indignantly. "They're plotting something. Just look at them." Blaise seemed to be reading an excerpt from his book, not paying attention to his two friends and Pansy was teasingly swatting at the strands of hair in Draco's face. He was smirking down at her. Harry really wished he could just walk across the way and kiss Draco full on the mouth but he restrained himself.
"Well it's the polite thing to do isn't it? Didn't your..." The sentence died in Draco's throat. He had almost asked,
"I wasn't going to leave you there."
fought and
"Goodbye Potter."
"Is it Fanny from Hufflepuff?" Neville asked. Everyone looked to him. He had been quiet as Dean, Seamus, and Ron threw out the names of girls from different houses. Neville blushed when he saw that everyone was staring at him. "Sorry Harry. You don't have to tell us." He said with a sheepish grin.
"I know but shut up." Harry sighed and wiped at the tears on his cheeks with her handkerchief. "I found out he still liked you... Not that long after the incident and when I asked him why he just... Shook his head and said,
"Daphne Phillips?"
"But he still went to their side." Neville interjected. "When his parents called, he went. Voldemort bloody congratulated him." Neville said with a frown.
don't freak out." Draco begged. He wasn't exactly sure why he himself wasn't freaking out. Maybe seeing how stressed Harry was calmed him but... Barely.
"I wasn't ready." Draco rolled his eyes and walked forward. Harry was smirking at him. Draco clenched his jaw and muttered an undoing spell under his breath, tapping Harry's hand with his wand. Harry immediately regained use of his hand. He rubbed his wrist with his left hand, the blood rushing back to his fingers.
"Probably another ten minutes."
"No you don't." Draco said. Harry frowned. That wasn't the answer he was expecting.
"Not a bad thing?" Ron demanded, standing and glaring at his friends. "He's an asshole. All of them are assholes." He said through his teeth. Ron had been more... Volatile as of late. Ginny was constantly sending owls out to their parents about his behavior and everyone kept urging him to talk to someone, anyone about how he was feeling but Ron always... Shut down.
"He did actually." Draco arched an eyebrow, waiting for him to continue. Harry sighed.
"Your jam?" Harry asked with a cheeky smile.
"It's the only way they'll all find out at once. It might be a bit awkward at dinner but... At least we can get it out of the way right?" Harry sighed but nodded. Ginny was right, as usual.
"That's my point." Ginny said. "Malfoy basically dismissed your presence and it's not bugging you at all. That shit used to get on your nerves. I would know. You would complain about it constantly." Ginny said as she and Luna giggled.
"I... I don't want to say something and then... Jinx it." Harry mumbled out. "I'm sorry."
"No. She felt my pulse and then she asked me if you were alive, if you were okay, and as far as I knew, you were so I said yes and she told everyone that I was dead." Harry said.
"You don't know shit." Harry laughed as Draco rolled his eyes. "Where's your cruddy wand?" Harry produced it and Draco took out his own. "The spell I used was simple. It's
"Who thought it was a good idea to have your parents and I formally meet?" Harry said.
"Hermione likes you." Draco rolled his eyes. "Luna likes you too."
"Fine. Whatever." Harry said under his breath. Draco saw Harry look away out of the corner of his eye and part if him wanted to say he was sorry but the other part wanted to tell him to fuck off. Draco has never apologized to Harry for anything he did but then again... Neither has Harry. Draco wasn't sure why Harry wanting to be friends with him felt like a bad idea but it did. Maybe it was because of who he was. Maybe it was because of what he'd done to Harry, Hermione and Ron. Or maybe it was because... Draco just couldn't picture them as friends.
"You couldn't have lied?" Harry said.
"Potions." Harry and Draco said at the same time, making Ron rolls his eyes. What the fuck was happening? They were talking in sync now? Ron's hands shook slightly. Draco wasn't surprised to smell smoke, Ron's anger coupled with his magical power was probably sparking something nearby.
"Lemon." He said curtly. "
"It's bloody horrible. I hate it." Ron said.
"You're not wrong but I'd probably have a whole lot more to say than that."
"Because you never really think." Draco said. Harry was going to say something but Draco cast the spell, stopping him. "
"We're trying not to antagonize them remember?" Draco said. Pansy shrugged.
"I.. I..." Draco stammered out. "Harry can we..." Harry stood though and stepped away from Draco. Harry looked to Hermione and Ron and then at Draco who still hadn't stood.
"I know that." Harry said.
"Shut up. No it's not." Harry said. He was staring at the scars on Draco's chest with fear and almost... Anger. "I
"Yeah! Bisexual!" Ginny exclaimed, finding her voice. "Not that you were shagging your arch-nemesis!" Hermione hushed Ginny who was red in the face with... Embarrassment? Confusion? Harry couldn't tell.
"Why do you care Harry? Can't you just leave me alone, please." Draco snapped at him, half glaring at Harry who involuntarily smiled a little. "What's with the stupid grin?"
in my room tonight." Draco said. Harry paused. Draco's hands were in his hair and he was breathing hard. When Harry looked up at Draco, he was flushed with embarrassment.
"Where's Malfoy?" Harry didn't mean to say it out loud but now that it was out there, he couldn't exactly take it back. Harry could feel Ron and Hermione's eyes on him as well as Dean's and Seamus'.
"Boo." Harry jumped in his seat, slightly startled and heard Draco laugh above him.Harry turned with a frown to look at the blond Slytherin.
"Oh please. I'm Draco's best friend. You think I haven't noticed how happy he is?" Pansy said.
"How could I forget?" Harry said, jumping off the log and landing right in front of Draco, leaving hardly any room between them. "You ran off you bastard."
"If all you're going to do is repeat my questions back at me Draco then what's the God damn point." Harry said, narrowing his eyes at Draco. Draco always liked how easily he could rile up Harry but he didn't really like it right now.
"Liar." Draco huffed.
Harry wasn't sure he had ever heard Draco Malfoy say thank you to anyone, let alone to Harry Potter. Harry hadn't realized he had made it to the dining hall until he was sitting himself down next to Hermione, across from Ron. Hermione poked him in the ribs. "Ow." Harry mumbled.
"Then what are you doing out here Draco?" Harry demanded, stepping closer to him. "Why are you going into the Forbidden Forest?"
"You don't know
"Never knew you liked taking it up the..." Dean put his hands over Seamus' mouth and smiled apologetically.
"You're positive that's what he said?" Draco asked. It looked like Hermione had put a little life into him.
him honestly.
"You've never met my parents Harry but you know what they're like." Draco said in an even tone.
"Harry Potter." Draco said again. Harry looked back to Draco, trying not to smile. "Come. Here." But he didn't need to say that, Harry was already stepping over the bench, running one hand through his hair nervously.
when you laughed! When you
"We'll see." He said, heading back to his bed. "I won't keep you from your lady, see you tomorrow Harry." Harry nodded.
"What are you talking about Potter?" Draco said in that same listless tone he's been using on everyone. It unnerved Harry a little. Where was that spark, that fire that burned deep inside Draco? What had happened?
"Just don't okay. I'm used to Malfoy. Just call me Malfoy." Draco said, glaring at Harry.
"Yes. I wanted to talk to you." Harry said, slowly standing.
"Like I said, he's not that bad." Harry said.
"You're shit at making people feel better." Pansy rolled her eyes.
"He's shagging someone." Pansy said. "That's the only explanation."
"We've known each other for years Draco. I can tell how you're feeling from a mile away probably." Harry said, finally looking up and adjusting his glasses. "You forget I know what your magic feels like when you're angry." Draco swallowed hard. "This isn't exactly a skin burning reaction but it's... Prickly. I know you're agitated." Draco scowled a little, hating how well Harry could read him (not that he couldn't do the same). "Just tell me what's wrong." Harry said.
Harry could hear someone crying and he was trying to find out who it was. Harry had a free period and was on his way to the library but the moment he heard someone crying, he turned around and followed the sound. "It's going to be okay little one." Harry heard a soft voice say.
"Was it that bad?" Harry asked. Draco paused in fumbling to put on his cloak.
"Shut up Harry."
"Well you've chosen the wrong guy to be your first one." Draco said with a small chuckle. Harry exhaled slowly, and wrapped his arm tighter around his boyfriend.
"Ah yes, all us former Death Eaters and the Chosen One all in one room for a fuckin Christmas party. God the room had some much tension you could have cut into it and served it for dessert." Harry laughed and plopped down onto the couch next to Draco.
"You do know her name right?" Harry asked, arching an eyebrow at him.
you." Harry said.
"No it's not!" The girl wailed. "The friends I met on the train didn't want to speak to me anymore after we were sorted and then..." She sobbed bitterly and Harry swallowed hard as the girl said something to Draco he couldn't hear.
"It's never been proven that I'm the
"Okay." Harry said, suddenly feeling more confident. He marched over to Draco who tried not to move a muscle. If he leaned in, Harry would know how badly Draco wanted to kiss him. Harry's eyes searched Draco's expressionless face, trying to find some hint that he was messing with Harry or some form of revulsion but there was nothing. Harry sighed.
"Bummer. What if I intend to have a bad dream tonight?" Harry said.
"I'm listening." He said, turning the page of his book. Draco sighed and Pansy gave him a curious look, continuing to page through the magical newspaper in her hands.
"No." Harry interrupted. "I've known this for a while because Ron and I actually thought about pulling a prank on you that involved raspberry jam and a laxative in Year five." Harry said.
"I don't want to hear it!" Ron shouted, drawing attention from the rest of the Gryffindor house down the table. Ginny started to laugh.
"I just... I still don't get it. I know my mom loves me but..." Draco didn't want to say it but he had thought about it on several occasions. He had thought his parents fear of Voldemort, trumped their love for him.
"I never agreed to that." Harry said.
"Yes, yes. I'm fucking cute. Tell me something I don't know." Draco said, shaking his head.
"Shut up I'm talking about you. Although, they do think you're a girl." Harry said. Draco's heart skipped a beat and his cheeks flushed pink. He had hoped Harry was talking about him but he had prepared his heart for the worst. Maybe this was a regular thing for the Chosen One, snogging people in different areas of Hogwarts.
"I mean if that's not what..." Harry cut him off with a kiss. Draco could still feel the tears on his face.
"Luna likes everyone."
"So was Merlin." Hermione reminded him.
"Well, good." Draco said. Harry laughed a little. "Let's go to sleep." Draco said as Harry dried his eyes. Harry nodded and as they laid down, Harry immediately wrapped one arm around Draco and put his head on his chest. Harry could hear how fast Draco's heart was beating and he smiled lightly as the blond boy wrapped him up in his arms. Draco felt three little words trying to
"I never really thought about having kids much myself but... Being around Teddy makes me want to have one... Or two." Harry said. McGonagall smiled at him as they stopped outside the Gryffindor tower.
"How much did you steal exactly?" There was enough rolls and sandwiches for almost a dozen people. There was five different kinds of fruit, some leftover roast from last night, jars of jelly, peanut butter, a tossed salad, what looked like a thermos of soup and Draco was just now pulling out some custard and several slices of pie.
"W-what?" Harry said. Draco always thought Harry looked kind of cute with that stupid confused look he always wears. Draco held his hand out to Harry. Harry took it and stepped a little closer to Draco, squeezing his hand lightly.
"How did you know I was here?" Harry asked as Draco allowed Harry to enter his room.
kissed
"Shut up." He said again. Harry said nothing, just looked down at the ground as Draco shakily took a long drag on his cigarette. It had almost died out in his hand.
"So you two really don't think that..." Hermione paused. "I mean you'd only been together a couple months before we left and..." She stopped.
"I... I'm sorry about Goyle."
The tower was a wreck. The table and chairs were overturned, partly smashed or stomped on. The tea set was in shattered against one wall and Draco had even gone as far as breaking all the glass out of the windows, letting in the cold night air. Draco himself was lying on his back on the ground, eyes closed with a blueberry cigarette between his fingers. "Is lemon not your favorite anymore?" Draco shot up, startled. His eyes were wide as he stared at Harry, wondering if the dark haired boy would disappear.
"Good." Draco said, turning away. "Now leave me alone." Harry chuckled and headed for the door.
With Draco absent from Hogwarts, Harry almost felt like there was a piece of him missing. The first week of classes was a complete disaster. Harry couldn't focus, let alone do his homework. Hermione, Ron, Luna, Neville, etc. were all obviously worried about him. everyone asking him if he was okay, if he was feeling alright. Harry always answered with, "Yeah, what could be wrong?" Nobody had figured out how to answer that yet and once they did, Harry knew he would have to find something else to say. He was glad his friends weren't trying to pry very much. He wouldn't know how to talk about his feelings even if they asked.
Draco thought.
"Don't tell me what to do." Harry said.
"Well I just go to my tower. I've told you about this. It helps me clear my head." Draco said.
going to be an experiment. If you want something from this Draco. I mean it, I wouldn't bullshit you." Harry said. Draco knew he could trust his word. If you couldn't trust the Chosen One that would be pretty sad after all.
"Hello Blaise." Draco said lightly as the taller boy came to walk beside them on Harry's right side.
"I've never just gone for a walk in the forest before." Harry said, as he slowly walked bak and forth on the fallen log in front of him. Draco watched his movements, having half a mind to use a spell to knock Harry to the ground but he decided Harry looked better like this, balancing up above him. He had always liked taller boys but... Harry being shorter than him was something that made Draco's heart skip a beat for some odd reason. He was only shorter by about an inch but, that was enough for Draco.
"I'll try not to Professor." Harry said with a cheeky grin. Draco rolled his eyes and Harry took a deep breath, holding his wand over Draco's outstretched palm. He moved his wrist, practically shouting
." Draco said, waving his wand over the top of Harry's head. the spell washed over him and Harry immediately warmed. He smiled a little.
kissing Draco. It felt way different than kissing Ginny but a good different. Draco tried not to kiss Harry back but her couldn't stop himself.  As Harry put his left hand up to Draco's face, Draco put his arms around Harry's waist, under his stupid Gryffindor robe. When the two of them finally broke apart the first words out of Draco's mouth were,
"Look... I... Your guess is as good as mine as to why... Why Draco thinks you're still worth something even though you tried to kill him."
"I'm busy." Harry said, taking Draco's hand again. If he didn't keep an eye on his boyfriend, he might just leave the party.
Harry should have known that Draco, Pansy and Blaise would be in attendance. They were, after all, Eighth years. Harry just assumed the Ravenclaws wouldn't invite them for some reason. But there the three of them were, sitting on a ratty couch and only talking to one another. They had arrived fairly early on, not long after Harry, Ron and Hermione but they hadn't really talked to anyone. Draco seemed to exchange some words with Reggie who clipped Draco's shoulder much to Harry's surprise but that was about it. For the past three hours, they had been sitting at the back of the room by themselves.
"If you aren't there in the next..." Harry began.
"Thanks Draco. That does
you." Harry said. Draco blushed hard.
Pansy was standing in front of Harry, smirking as if she knew something. "Can I do something for you Parkinson?"
"He didn't use a damn love potion on me." Harry said with a roll of his eyes.
"He doesn't need to know."
"Who said we're friends."
"Yes we are." Harry said, smoke curling out from his mouth. "Got any more of these?" He asked. Draco slowly pulled the packet out from his pants and despised how the only thing he could think about was the fact that Harry and him had indirectly kissed.
"It's fine." Harry said, thought he was trying not to look anyone in the eye.
is making me happy over my dead body."
"Lover boy? Hot stuff? Pumpkin? Darling?" Harry would have continued on for ages but Draco waved his wand at him and Harry suddenly found he couldn't speak. Was this another one of those American spells Draco had learned. Harry frowned at Draco whose teacup shook slightly in his hands.
Before, when Draco could pretend that he didn't like Harry, that he just liked making him angry, liked watched him scowl and narrow those emerald green eyes of his, it had been easy for him to ignore the underlying feelings of his that wrapped around the one and only Harry Potter. Harry didn't like him. This was a known fact for Draco. Draco had long given up any fantasies of him and the Chosen One being together. It was a stupid dream anyways. The thought of seeing Harry again this year was almost enough to make Draco never want to set foot in Hogwarts again but... Draco wanted to graduate. He wanted some sort of normalcy in his life and most of all, he wanted to get away from Malfoy Manor.
having people stare at me." Harry rolled his eyes.
"You were
"We were twelve. What did you want me to do?" Draco said.
important." Draco said with a slight grin, leaning to kiss Harry again but McGonagall interrupted them in a loud voice.
"I'm just a warm body to you aren't I." Draco said. Harry just smirked. "Fuck you."
"Well I don't like secrets." Ginny said, getting back to the matter at hand. "Tell us who you're seeing or else Harry Potter." She threatened. Harry laughed.
Potions class was much the same but this time Draco sat at a two person desk by himself and quietly brewed potions without so much as a peep from him. Harry was positive that Draco was even making a point not to look at him. Harry didn't understand what was happening. Was this really Draco? The same Draco who was always so outspoken and energetic? The Draco who was a snobbish know-it-all and constantly trying to one-up Harry? What had happened this past summer? Why was Draco so abhorrently different?
Draco decided to just come right out and say it. There was really no other way to go about this.
"Yes." Harry said. "I had my invisibility cloak on." Blaise scoffed.
"Harry." Draco said, standing.
"Well it's true." Ron said.
"I have no other plans." Draco said.
"Of course." Draco said. "I've even invented a little game we could play." Harry's nose wrinkled as Draco stood from the table.
"We haven't shagged yet." Harry said and as Dean choked on his food, Harry suddenly realized what he said. "I mean! Wait..." Harry said, wracking his brain.
"It was funny." Harry said with a snicker. "Come on babe, lets go hang out with our friends please. Invite Blaise and Pansy." Draco scoffed.
"I won all of them!" Harry exclaimed with a laugh.
"Your mother sacrificed
"You sure you don't want me to hold your hand while we walk?" Harry teased as they continued. Draco snorted out a laugh. The thought was tempting though.
"Ginny said I was dramatic."
Dark Curse on us Potter? We're unarmed." Pansy snarled at him. The tension in Harry's shoulders immediately dropped and the color drained from his face. Draco shot Pansy a look but she was glaring at Harry. "What? Scared? Just
"Yeah but that's what makes you love me." Harry said.
"If I was afraid of snakes, I would make a piss poor Slytherin." Harry shrugged a little. "Can you do that thing still... Talk to snakes?"
"And pray that you never do because this won't be helping
"Draco,
"I didn't stutter Potter. You heard me." Draco said.
"Who said anything about an experiment?" Harry said. Draco huffed and crossed his arms over his chest. "It's not like I'm going to go around kissing other guys to see if I like this or not. I
"I'm not starting anything. They're starting it." Ron said. Hermione took the flask out of Ron's hand.
It was about beating
"Well that's what
"It was a joke Ron. You know what a joke is right?" Ginny said, winking at Harry who blushed slightly.
"Yes it did Draco. You can't just pretend that it didn't." Harry said.
WHOEVER PUT TOGETHER DEATHLY HALLOWS PT 2 AND DECIDED TO CUT THAT SCENE WHERE DRACO RUNS BACK ACROSS THE COURTYARD SHOUTING "POTTER" NEEDS TO FUCKING SQUARE UP.  HOW DARE THEY. HOW DARE. DRACO DESERVED EVEN THIS TINY BIT OF REDEMPTION. HE DESERVED THE WORLD. ANYONE WHO DOESN'T THINK SO CAN FIGHT ME.
but he managed to hold his tongue.
"How much longer you think I have then?" Harry said. Draco shrugged, putting the lemon cigarette to his lips, still holding the pack out out Ron.
"I cant think of one." Draco rolled his eyes, spinning his wand between his fingers. "You're not gonna try and hex me right?" Draco didn't seem amused by Harry's comment.
"Prat."
afterwards."
"Nothings wrong." Draco said. "But you know it's been a month since..."
"How do you know what..."
"Fuck." He said pushing some of his hair back out of his face as he grabbed Harry's hand and pulled him down a separate, darker hallway. He pushed Harry into the corner of the dead end hallway, praying the darkness would hide them. Harry was squeezing his hand tightly and Draco's other hand was balled up in a fist against Harry's chest. Harry leaned in and kissed Draco's cheek. "Stop." Draco hissed as Harry continued to kiss Draco's jaw, his neck, Harry's teeth grazing his skin. "I swear to god Harry..." Draco said in a harsh whisper, even though he wasn't trying to stop him.
"Ah, yes,
"Dean's right." Ginny said, moving to sit on Harry's right side. Harry sighed.
"You're right, it looks even worse than I imagined." Draco said throwing one hand in the air and scowling lightly before running that same hand through his white blond hair. "How did you mess up a simple drought?" Draco demanded.
being around you. I
Draco could feel Harry tugging the rest of his shirt out of his pants where it had been tucked in and finish undoing the buttons that he had left behind in favor of running his hands through Harry's hair. Harry pushed the fabric down his shoulders and Draco slipped it off. Just as Draco was about to demand that Harry remove his shirt, Draco felt a sharp pain on his chest that made him hiss and pull away from Harry completely. Not now. God why did it have to happen right now?
"You? Studying?" Harry wasn't all that surprised honestly. Draco did have some of the best grades in their class. Harry was just being an ass to see if Draco would bite back with something but Draco just stared at him with dead eyes before slowly turning around. "That's it?" Harry said.
"N-no!" Draco stammered out, so surprised he took a step away from Harry. "I won't do that."
"What'd you do?" Harry said. He was still holding the arm of a salamander and a spring of mint. Draco took the mint from him and dropped it in. The mixture began to smell like toothpaste.
"No. It's a fact." Harry said, running his hand through his messy hair.
"I'm not worrying about anything." Draco said.
"No but I would be afraid of
"I resent that. I am not." Draco said.
looked
"Well I'm coming anyways so I can at least laugh if something tries to kill you." Harry said. Draco's lips twitched and Harry thought he might just start yelling again but Draco actually smiled a little.
Either way, Draco simply pursed his lips and said nothing more to the Chosen One for the rest of class.
"No... But I always wanted some. A little sister, perhaps or a brother. Maybe both." Harry was surprised by this. "I'd make an awful big brother though."
(See the end of the chapter for
that?" Harry could see that and he needed to know why. Why him? Why after everything?
"Well I don't want to be called
"They're your parents. They should love you no matter what." Harry said.
"Don't make me hurt you." Draco said. Harry was still smirking.
"I don't need to tell you who it is." Hermione was still the only one Harry had told that he was bisexual. It's not like he was hiding it per-say he just hadn't found the right time to tell everyone else yet.
Harry listened as Draco murmured a spell under his breath. The spell sounded familiar but it wasn't one of the normal healing spells. In awe, Harry watched the wounds on Draco's chest slowly close up until they were nothing but faint pink scars all over his upper body. Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He hadn't realized he had been holding his breath. "Draco are you okay?" Harry asked softly. Draco wouldn't look him in the eyes. "What was that?" Still nothing. "Draco."
"Your gray eyes get all soft, less stormy." Harry said. "I don't know if it's always been like that but... It is something I noticed this year." Draco scowled. There was no way Draco would try to look at Harry fondly over the past several years. Harry would have teased him endlessly about it if he had.
"God, can't you ever just shut up?" Draco groaned as Harry kissed him heatedly, trying to tug Draco's shirt out of his pants where he had had it neatly tucked in. "Stop kissing me. I'm trying to argue with you." Draco said. Harry chuckled.
"I thought she had too. Apparently, she's been dating my soon to be step father since last year." He laughed a little darkly. "That's longer than most of the men she's been with." Pansy and Draco didn't know what to say and Blaise's smile fell.
"You never know Harry, maybe I finally poisoned one this time. This could be the last blueberry cigarette you ever have." Draco said. Harry started to laugh and that really confused Ron. Usually Harry would retort with something else. Instead, he was laughing.
"Oh really?" Draco said, trying to be nonchalant. "Whose the lucky lady?" Harry shoved him lightly.
