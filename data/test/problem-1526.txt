“Obviously. She’s up there looking out for us, making sure we’re happy.” Draco smiled softly. “She only ever wanted that for us.”
“I know, and I don’t care. Anyone that makes the children feel so sad is not, and will never be in my good graces. Mother or not.”
Draco nodded. “I know. I don’t want to see you hurt, Harry. Or Jamie, or Lily, or Albus, or Scorpius. You’re my family.”
Draco scoffed. “Karma’s a bitch, or so I’m told.” He sucked in a breath, and Harry felt helpless. “Thank you for coming.”
As they ascended the stairs to get backstage, he leaned down to whisper, “After this, I want you to be my assistant. You’ve more than earned it through this whole ordeal.”
Draco’s eyes went wide. Distantly, he realized that everyone in the dressing room was looking at him to see his response. He shook his head. “I do, but…”
Laughing, Draco replied, “My money’s on him pursuing Teddy. If Teddy could get over their age difference, that is.”
Draco sighed. This was getting even more depressing than he had anticipated. “I’m not quite sure. I....” he took a deep breath. “I stopped hanging out with all of them the day I took the Mark for their safety.”
It was times like these when he desperately wished he could truly love her as a wife instead of a friend. She was the mother of his child, his dearest friend, and Draco knew he was doing her a disservice in his marriage to her.
Draco scoffed. “Please. Contrary to popular belief, I am quite cultured.” He sucked in a steadying breath. “Well, I think she was. The greatest good I’ll ever get, I mean.”
Harry just rubbed over Draco’s knuckles with his thumb. “That about sums it up, yeah.” He shot Draco a conspiratory grin. “A chihuahua, huh?”
Harry decided to make his appearance at that moment, striding to Draco’s side and plopping a quick kiss atop his head. “Ginny does have her reasons, little one. And we will find them out in the morning, but for now, all of you little nargles need to go to bed.”
That year, he tagged along with Harry to drop off Teddy, James, and Lily at Kings Cross for the semester. They had left Albus and Scorpius at Aunt Andromeda’s so they could go get lunch and a few beers afterward. This time, Draco insisted they go to a muggle pub if only because he was sure many other parents would get the same idea of getting drinks after the children leave.
“What?” he responded petulantly, dumping the ash in the bowl of the pipe in the little bowl and knocking it against the cork. He set the pipe down, taking in a deep breath.
His children were so lucky they were raised in a house full of love, and he was so immeasurably glad they would never have to come to that realization.
He knew she was all he would be able to think about when performing later, and all he could think about was how she would have been so proud of him. At that thought, Draco smiled.
Because it was. Here was Draco, next to the man he loved, holding his darling baby boy close to his chest. It was better than anything Draco would have dreamed for himself. It didn’t matter how Harry didn’t know about Draco’s feelings for him, how he would likely never learn. He was here, and Draco was more than content with that.
He was met with a resounding series of boos from his cast and crew, but it was good in nature so he let it slide.
Scorpius sighed and scrambled off of Draco’s lap, heading for his room. Before he entered the hallway, though, he paused. “I love you, dad.”
“You are their stepfather. And you’ve been more of a parent to them in the last two years than Ginny has ever been.”
Draco flinched when he heard the door click shut behind him. The sound was worse than a slam, quiet but no less dramatic. No less painful.
Draco’s flat was a muggle brownstone on the other side of London. He once told Harry he bought it because he couldn’t live with the memories that soaked the foundation of the Manor, but, while some part of that had to be true, Harry always suspected Draco bought the place because he liked how ordinary and quiet it was.
Harry wasn’t sure what to think. Draco, while he was generally as talkative as they come, was shockingly taciturn in regards to his work and all it entailed. Outside of absentminded comments made after too many fingers of firewhiskey, he never spoke of how he became involved in theatre.
“The baby, Harry. He’s coming and Astoria -” Draco’s voice cracked at her mention. “God, Harry, she’s white as a sheet and there’s blood everywhere and I don’t know what to do.”
Draco gave a drawn-out sigh at that. “The useless interns are keeping this late, actually, so I’m not sure.”
He did not envy his family’s matriarchs if this was what they felt all those years. He did, however, relate.
Draco turned his face so his mouth was free. “I said, I don’t think I’m going to survive this weekend.”
When Draco was a boy, he used to sing songs with his mother. In secret, of course, for Draco’s father would have never allowed it. Draco always thought he got his voice from his mother.
He was thankful Harry understood his hangups when it came to the wizarding world; how Harry met him halfway.
He told Ginny when she came home, sweat-soaked and sinking. He pointedly did not think about how seeing his wife all flushed brought him no thrill, no blood-rush as it had when they were young.
Draco groaned. “I swear to god, Harry, you do not understand the wrath I felt when I had to explain to the kids that Ginny actually loved them.”
Draco resisted the urge to cup Harry’s face and wipe those wrinkles away, and instead waited patiently for Harry to think through his words. “Aren’t you lonely?” Harry blinked, shocked - as if that wasn’t what he meant to say.
It would be fun, probably. Something for the parents to ooh and ahh over, and the kids to feel accomplished about.
“You’ve got the head for it,” Mildred added. “And I believe there’s a course starting in a few weeks at the College.”
Harry knelt in front of them, first aid kit open. “No,” he said. “A little bit. I’m disappointed more than I’m angry.” He gave Betty a reusable ice pack. “Hold that against your lip, yes, like that.”
“I can see the appeal, I think,” Draco said, when he finished his second cup of tea. “I’m not sure what I was expecting—some kind of latent magic, perhaps, to be triggered by contact? But it’s actually just nice.”
Harry didn’t know if Malfoy would like to visit an Irish horse farm. “Yeah. Sure. I’d love to.” He bumped fists with Dean.
Anti-Bone Breaking Charms on Quidditch wear weren’t technically illegal, so Harry didn’t comment. He did inspect Love’s hand anyway, for any sign of injury, and when he found nothing wrong he directed her to wait with Nathan and Anthony.
Harry was losing his voice, but he didn’t care. He couldn’t have asked for a better first game. “All right, all right! Players!” A few more shouts and he got their attention. “You were all amazing! This victory was well deserved!” The kids cheered. “But don’t forget. What do we do when we win?”
Oliver was refereeing this game, and Lee was commentating. Oliver stood in the middle of the field, one wand raised, waiting for the time. His whistle sounded, his wand came down, the balls went up—and the game was on.
“Yes, you get to play Beater this time,” Harry said, glancing at his roster and all his notes. “And Anthony, you’re Seeker, and Jamie, you’re Chaser. Is everyone ready?”
“That’s fair,” Peony acknowledged, after a while. “I’m sorry. About everything. I didn’t ask you to come here to make it all worse, I was…hoping for something better. Like maybe we could give each other some closure, or something. I don’t know. What do you want?”
Harry picked up the ex libris list. “I can make a note of which ones you’ve already looked at and fix you up a new request form, and then all you have to do is submit it to the front desk tomorrow and you’ll get,” Harry gestured at the trolley, “this, but just the stuff you haven’t looked at yet.”
… Abruptly Harry realised that Draco was out of touch with the world. Neither Pansy nor other friends of Daco’s from school had seen him in
Draco was shaking his head even as Padma was answering. “It’s been repaired once before magically, but the spell wore off and it broke again in the same place.”
It’d be empty around here with just Hugh and Betty around. One more year and then they’d be off to school full-time, too.
Harry led the way. The café was usually buzzy with people; customers from Direction Alley and Diagon Alley, workers from nearby businesses, the staff. Today it was a little fuller than usual.
Because that’s what it was. Abuse. The fact that he’d been used to it, that he’d borne it, that he’d just lived through it as if it were any other day—which it had been—didn’t make any of it less awful. It didn’t make him less angry, apparently.
The rest of the time before the kids would be picked up, went with Harry dutifully letting them dictate him messages for the cards. They could all sign their own names, with varying levels of skill, and he asked them to sign his own two cards, all the while ooh-ing and ahh-ing over their penmanship; he’d keep one for himself and the other he’d find a nice home for eventually.
Harry had lost all appetite. Maybe therapy could fix that part of him that was all dead and ugly. Maybe it could fix his feelings about sex. Maybe he could…he’d never get Ginny back—didn’t really
“I’ve already been to jail, and so have you.” Harry was done with this discussion. He put his plate aside and got up, pacing. “We’ve had our punishment. That’s enough. I’m not going to continue to punish myself just because. It’s done! It’s in the past! I just want to move on!” He glared at Draco. “I want a normal goddamn life, a fucking happy ending, and I don’t care what anyone else thinks. I want—I
Nobody else was there, and while the receptionist had told him kindly to take a seat, Harry was too jumpy to be able to just sit. Instead, he went to look at the rack.
Harry had taken Draco to a Muggle bookstore on the weekend, where they’d each got a copy of the same book to read—carefully selected, after perusing the Young Adult section for hours, and on recommendation by the store clerk who’d been restocking shelves nearby. After, Draco had cooked him dinner. At Harry’s place, mind, as it’d been within walking distance, and Draco had made a funny face when Harry had asked him where he lived.
“I feel a bit like I’m about to ride into the night on a dark horse,” Harry told Draco when he came back outside. “All I’m missing is a sword.”
“Yeah.” Harry sighed, suddenly tired and exhausted. He thought about leaving. He thought about the fact that Draco had been an asshole to him, too, but he—they were in a different place now. But he hadn’t grown up with Draco, not the way he had with Peony, whom he’d had to hide from or deal with on a daily basis for ten years, and every summer after that until he could leave.
“No, everyone gets an equal piece,” Harry cut through, picking up the scissors. “There’s enough of this that everyone still gets a big piece, all right?”
Harry’s resolve wavered. There was still Sunday for homework, but the book…he wanted to finish it this weekend so he could talk to Malfoy about it over lunch on Monday. On the other hand, it would be nice to come to the pub since he hadn’t gone the day before…but the pull towards the book was strong.
By the time Harry made it home, exhaustion warred with excitement and he stumbled into the bathroom to draw up a bath only to discover he’d run out of bath bombs. He should’ve eaten something, but he crawled into bed instead, ready for twelve hours of uninterrupted sleep.
“I might have to move,” Harry said slowly, thoughtfully. He could probably find another flatshare if the old one wouldn’t take him back. Or he could move into Grimmauld Place if he really had to. Or he could stay, and ask Bill for advice—he did still have some of his inheritance left and while he’d put it all aside for the future, a nice house or something, he could live off it for now if he had to. And maybe—well, maybe this would be a good excuse to get rid of this flat and the last dregs of his relationship with Ginny.
Harry huffed, exasperated. “I’m serious, Draco. You’re my husband. She’s going to be here the entire weekend, and you live here too. You’re bound to run into each other eventually.”
Draco shook his head softly, a small smile adorning his face. He had never smiled quite as bright as when Astoria was alive. Draco thought it was the cost of losing one’s best friend. “I think because we were that bad, we’ll know how to handle them.”
Draco blinked, and Harry seemed to shift even closer, and it was scary. It was electric, addictive, this air; it felt dangerous just the same.
He sighed and entered the ghastly old house, climbing up the stairs until he reached the attic. The door to the room was shut, but the knob twisted when Draco reached for it. He could hear loud music coming from the inside, and he briefly wondered if this floor was warded so no sound might leak downstairs.
Admittedly, there weren’t many things Draco would face head-on, as his husband was so apt to do. But for his children, he’d do anything if only to spare them any pain.
Draco hadn’t thought of it much at the time, but he understood when he heard what happened to Sirius Black, and his understanding deepened when sickness took his mother the winter after the war ended.
“Actually, tonight is one of the first dress rehearsals. You and the kids could come watch if you fancy. And Teddy. If he wants to come along. We could go to dinner after?”
He checked his watch and stood up. If they wanted to make it to the theatre in time, they should leave now. Draco had an alarmingly accurate internal clock and would give them (but mostly Harry) hell if they were late.
Harry nudged him with his ebow, shooting Draco a wide-eyed look. “We’ve been married for about two years now.”
Mark swiveled around, and looked up at Draco sheepishly. “I don’t know what happened, dude. I swear.”
Ella babbled on about some new boyfriend she had, and Draco was happy that at least her life was so simple. While he was not that old, listening to her tales about her mundane life made him feel young in a way he never had. He tried not to pity himself too much for it - that his childhood was ripped away in the face of a racist megalomaniac.
Could he please just crawl in a hole and die? Would that be okay? He sighed. Maybe he’d do that if he didn’t have a husband and kids.
Finally, Harry said, “I think this weekend just -” He made a vague gesture with the hand that wasn’t holding Draco. “It had to happen eventually - the whole Ginny thing, that is. I just don’t think any of us were prepared for it.”
Ella gave him a soft smile, but then looked confused. “How did you sound so good just now if you haven’t sang in twenty years then?”
Albus and Scorpius froze, shooting each other frantic looks before synchronously turning to face Draco.
Draco sighed and carded his hand through his husband’s hair once more, before getting up. He left their room, Harry still asleep in bed, and went back to the kitchen. He perched on one of the barstools lining the island and plucked his phone from his pocket, absentmindedly scrolling through Instagram. He heard someone clunking about in their bedroom upstairs.
Draco sighed. He’d been doing that a lot this weekend. “Remember when we first got together, and you said you’d always be by my side?”
He realized it was Draco when the person shouted “What the fuck do you mean, you don’t know the -” His voice went quiet again, suddenly, as if he realized exactly where he was.
As soon as they stepped inside, Draco made a beeline for the kitchen. He’d need a nice, strong cuppa while he gathered his words.
And then there was a commotion coming from one of the corridors. Harry could hear someone furiously murmuring, steadily getting louder as they came closer.
Scorpius never asked about Astoria, so he didn’t know Draco had truly loved her, even if it was only as a friend.
“Surprisingly, yes. I mean, it was awkward as hell - I don’t think she knew how to interact with me.”
“I’m like one of those muggle rat dogs,” he interjected. “You know the ones; what are they called again? Chiwowowows? Cheetahs? Cheetos?”
After she left, Draco shook his head to himself. That whole conversation was stilted, more awkward than his last interactions with his father.
When Harry and Ginny got divorced, it was such a spectacle in the Wizarding World that even Draco heard of it from where he stood, far removed from wizarding society.
For a single moment, Draco was glad Scorpius would never have to deal with that. He wouldn’t have had to if Astoria were still alive, either, because she was actually articulate about her love. The thought only made him cry harder.
Draco heard the front door slam open, and five boisterous voices echoing in the hallway. He smiled to himself.
But he couldn’t concentrate. Not now. For once in his life, he couldn’t compartmentalize what had happened in the real world and focus on the fictional.
Draco hummed in affirmation. “I’d had an on and off relationship with a muggle man before I proposed to her.” He paused. “Granted, I broke things off long before that, and we lost contact after the war, but he was my first love. And I didn’t want to begin a marriage on a lie.”
The blond rolled his eyes so far back Harry thought they would have disappeared. “God knows I have plenty of that.”
Ella gasped and he chuckled. He opened the door, and heard the crowd loudly settling in their seats.
“Who do you know here that auditioned for Angel? Maybe we can just go short one chorus member.” He looked at Ella, who was fanning her face.
“What is it, darling?” Draco asked. He felt his husband’s arm drape over his shoulders and leaned into the embrace, still looking at his son.
“I won’t go into too much detail as I’m sure you’ll learn about all this in your History of Magic class,” Draco continued. “But…” He shrugged.
When Harry looked at him this time, Draco felt as if he was missing something. “No,” he said. “It isn’t.”
Draco gave a harrumph and looked at Ella appraisingly. “You did well tonight, Ella. I don’t think I can thank you enough.”
He sighed. “I broke up with William maybe two months before the Dark Lord took over the Manor. We remained friends - he introduced us all to his new partner a few weeks later; but...the day I said I couldn’t see them anymore, Will announced he was diagnosed with AIDS.”
Harry nodded. “I didn’t explain anything, either. After I kicked Ginny out, I told them I was going to find you and left right after. I think Scorpius was worried.”
Harry sighed and stepped up to wrap his arms around Draco. “I know, love. I think she wants to talk to me about something.”
Oh. So that’s what this was about. “Don’t let your guilt complex take over now, Harry,” he said, sternly. “I made my choice. You didn’t force me to do anything.”
She should be happy for them, Draco thought. They were happy, and in love, and they had found anything they could ever wish for in each other.
“Don’t you ever get lonely, like, romantically?” Harry’s brow was still furrowed. He was going to develop wrinkles if he kept it up.
It was so silent in the room, Draco could hear a faraway muggle ambulance. Then it dawned on him. “Oh, fuck.”
But his son had just lost his mother. Scorpius would never know exactly how much Astoria loved him, still loves him even in the afterlife, and Draco would never be able to quite explain it.
His mother had turned and looked at him, booping his nose and smiling. “You have the same eyes as he did, the Black eyes. And he had long dark hair, and high cheekbones, and a laugh you could hear from a mile away.”
Which wasn’t much, honestly. Draco couldn’t decide if he was disappointed or if he was just that old as he nursed his finger of Odgen’s across from Harry. The other man was drinking from a mug of beer that left traces of frothy foam on his top lip every time he took a sip.
Harry’s hands were soft when they cupped Draco’s face and he tasted of wine. He cradled Draco’s cheeks with such care that Draco forgot all of his worries. In the end, he decided, if he had this, all would be well.
“A lot can change in two years, Draco. Who knows? Maybe by the end of it, you’ll want to keep her as an assistant.”
Draco didn’t know how to feel about it, but as long as history wasn’t going to repeat itself anytime soon, he supposed he could accept it.
Harry was met with a series of groans and protestations, to which Draco snickered, but Harry was firm. “I’m serious, guys, go to bed. We’ll see you in the morning.”
He had one of those clear tenors that could ring in a room like a church bell on Sunday mornings, and somehow it maintained its clarity despite his weakness for a pipe in the evenings, and despite how little he utilized it.
“It’s stressful,” Draco slurred, glaring at the water bottle Harry pressed into his hands. He took a sip of the offending drink and looked at Harry. “We work long hours with little food and rest to make people happy. I love it.”
Draco rolled his eyes just as the cast began singing. He looked over at them and grinned. “No,” he said. “It’s really not.”
He didn’t like to think about Harry’s childhood, though he knew the only love he had received was from Molly Weasley and Hagrid when he was 11.
At this point, Draco had come to terms with Ginny’s impending arrival, and he desperately tried not to let it loom over his shoulders. He didn’t want her to affect his mood around the children, especially since they were moody enough already.
And, honestly, this was why he did it. Working in the theatre industry was its own little version of hell, the perfect concoction of caffeine and insomnia and anxiety to make him go a little batty. He pitied poor Harry for choosing to live with him and his erratic schedule. But Draco wouldn’t change a thing. He felt at peace here, with the audience cheering up at him and his castmates by his sides. No matter how much it made his father roll in his grave, Draco wouldn’t change this for the world.
Draco froze, his phone clattering to the countertop, loud in the silence of the kitchen. Belatedly, he realized he was shaking.
Draco liked to read. His mother made him learn at a very young age, and it was a wonderful skill to have when he was younger and he needed to flee from the megalomaniac living in his house.  With books, he could escape to new worlds where he didn’t have to be himself. He liked how characters in books were normal, how they led mundane lives with only a few menial problems.
Well, he thought, as he made his way back to Harry, there was a reason he barely went to wizarding places. It had taken him years to fully be accepted at the Three Broomsticks, with countless apologies and amends on top of that.
Later, when they were in bed and Harry held Draco close to his chest like he did every night, Harry said, “You have a beautiful voice.”
“Oh, I’m just dandy. My children heard about my - rather unsafe, might I add - teenage sex life. What could ever be wrong?”
Draco pushed himself off of the jamb and went to sit cross-legged on the floor next to Harry, uncorking the bottle and taking a hearty swig in one fluid motion. “I don’t suppose the kids can hear this?”
Harry, Draco thought, should be happy. Out of everyone, he was the one who deserved it the most. Seeing him upset made something horrible twist in Draco’s gut, made worse from the recurring thought that maybe if given the chance, he could make everything better. Even if he didn’t make it better, he would at least try and make it bearable.
“Hey, Draco?” He heard Ella ask. Draco looked at her. She gulped. “You know all the lines and choreography, don’t you?”
Owe him, Harry did. The night before Ginny was due to arrive, the kids all came through the floo. His darling husband wasn’t there to greet the children like usual since some emergency case came up and he had to leave only five minutes before the children arrived.
Draco sighed to himself at that. He and Pansy used to be close, but after the war, she had fucked off to Europe to marry some rich pureblood Frenchman. They hadn’t talked much since, although they did occasionally meet up if either of them were in town.
Harry barked out a laugh at that, too loud in their near-silent room. “No more than your parents or my aunt and uncle did us.”
This turned out far longer and just a tad angstier than I expected, so fair warning. Thank you so much for reading!
He heard footsteps coming closer and turned his head to face Harry’s favorite pair of worn dragonhide work boots. Draco would have to get his husband some new jeans soon, he thought; these were fraying at the edges.
Draco sighed. Ginny was due to return from visiting her parents with Lily and Jamie within the hour. She had taken to leaving whenever he was around. Draco knew that as soon as the Weaslette was off of maternity leave, she would be touring with the Harpies, leaving Harry to care for three children under the age of eight. Draco had made a point of not voicing his opinions on the matter. “Do you want to talk about it?”
After that, Harry looked at Draco and nodded. Draco hummed, “See you soon,” then walked off, the kids trailing behind him.
“Really? I heard that Nott boy - Theo’s younger brother -” This time, Astoria threw a pillow at him, rolling her eyes and laughing.
Draco had been working at the theatre for about a year, at that point. He had been hired around the same time as they had found out Astoria was pregnant, and he loved it dearly.
Harry had perfected the art of giving his all into everything he deemed worth it, and while Draco adored him for it, the habit was unfortunate at the best of times. Harry couldn’t possibly put his all into his marriage, and his friendship with Draco, and his relationship with his children, and his work. Something had to give eventually, and, well, now something was giving. It was just difficult for Draco to watch.
Draco turned to face them and smiled kindly at the kids. “Okay, so, house rules are as follows: Talk only when you have to, and when you do, whisper. Do not clap until the end of the performance, if at all. Do not run down the isles and please, try your best to be courteous of the actors on stage. This will not be perfect.”
Were it directed at anybody else, Draco’s glare would have been scathing. Harry just took it as confirmation. He sighed, biting back a smile. “Give her time, Draco.”
And all Draco could do was be there for his children, he thought while waiting for the kettle to boil. He laid a teabag in a mug and rested it on the counter.
Draco liked his office. He supposed he’d have to since he ran and hid there whenever he was feeling too much, too fast. As such, his office was comforting, cast in the buttery light emanating from the Tiffany lamp on his desk. It held all the basic amenities: he had an electric kettle sitting next to the lamp and a couch laden with throw pillows and blankets pushed up against the far wall. There were pictures of his family and leftover programs hanging from the ceiling on little string lights. It was his home away from home.
She was hunched over her purse, clutching it to her chest in a vice. Ginny looked to be on the verge of tears, upset.
Harry turned to Draco, still wearing that frown. “I didn’t like hearing him say that shit about you.”
They ran into the Weasleys - quite literally - when they entered Platform 9 ¾. Draco cringed and tried to suppress a snicker while Jamie profusely apologized to his Uncle Ron, who was lying stunned on the ground.
But then he realized that maybe he had already paid for all his sins. Maybe, just maybe, this was his happy ending after all these years of hardship.
Draco had gasped, both his small hands flying to cover his mouth in surprise. His eyes were wide. “Really?”
They met at the pub at eight. Teddy had agreed to watch the kids for the night, and Draco was endlessly thankful. Without the responsibility that came with having kids, they could drink as much and as long as they wanted.
“I think they got the point after I ripped them a new asshole this afternoon if that’s what you’re referring to.”
He’d already wept so much his tears had stained Harry’s white dress shirt a soggy looking gray. Harry had just held him like a child until he calmed down, and Draco wanted to be embarrassed, but he wasn’t because this was Harry and he knew everything about Draco. He accepted everything about Draco, and Draco was so in love with him, despite how his wife had just died. How fucked was that?
Later, when Scorpius was down for the night, Draco clutched his finger of firewhiskey like a vice and watched his son sleep. Harry was next to him, unwavering, steady, and Draco was clinging to that steadiness as if it were a rock in a storm.
Draco shook his head, plucking his oxfords from his bag and putting them on. Left foot first, always. He gathered his things and stood, waiting for Harry to meet him at the door so they could walk out together. “No, I don’t think he would have. Mother never tried to reach out to him after Azkaban.”
He wondered what someone would see if they walked in to see him like this. It wasn’t likely; the only people who were here more than he was were the build crew and various maintenance workers.
It was also Ella’s first time at one of these things, and Draco would almost feel bad for her if it weren’t for her excitement. He had taken to the girl like a fish to water, once she figured out how to help without being in the way. Eventually, he would make her his assistant. For now, she was with the others on the dance floor, with her raven held up in a ponytail at the crown of her head.
The girl with blue hair just gave him another look and started applying something on his lips with a brush.
The room became charged with...something, so thick it felt tangible. It felt like one of those moments that had the potential to change everything, and Draco wasn’t sure if he appreciated it.
“Oh, come on, dad,” Scorpius rolled his eyes. “You wouldn’t sound so sad about your friends if you weren’t fucking at least one of them.”
Draco didn’t answer. What was Ginny’s game here? What was she trying to do? He knew she wanted to see the kids more, but she had always hated him.
Surely this is how most people felt when interacting with the estranged mothers of their stepchildren?
The thing about the front door was that there were two windows on either side of it. They let in a nice amount of natural light into the foyer, but they also served the purpose of allowing someone to check and see who is at the door, before letting them inside.
Draco drew in a shuddering breath. Truthfully, he and Scorpius had never really talked in depth about Astoria. Scorpius had never expressed interest in learning about his mother, and Draco always suspected it was partially because his son didn’t want him to feel bad.
When Harry and Draco had first gotten together - when they knew they were serious - they decided one day they would sit the kids down and discuss their respective pasts. Harry had anticipated it would come up after James learned it in History of Magic, but Draco always had a feeling it would be earlier. Guess he was right.
They were met with a series of “love you’s” as all the little Potters left the room. Scorpius hung back, though, looking for all the world like someone killed his kitten.
“We’re waiting at Fortescue’s, but now you’re done, I suppose we’ll come home. Do you want us to pick up curry or something on the way?”
Now, however, he did not have the time to be nice to her. So, Draco turned to her with a pointed look. “What.”
Draco looked up at Harry and his kids and gave them a tired smile. “Sorry if you heard me earlier - interns.”
Draco gave a world-weary sigh. “It’s not so funny, Scorpius.” He gave his son a pointed look. “William and I had broken up a few months before everything. He was good, but we were better off as friends.”
At least she wanted to build a relationship with them, he thought. Whether the kids wanted to take her up on that offer was still up for deliberation.
Harry scratched the back of his neck. “Er, yeah. I only got her text just now. She must have apparated.”
So, he got up the morning Ginny was due to arrive and proceeded as normal. He brewed himself a cuppa and made breakfast for himself, Harry, and the children, then went outside to have his morning smoke and annotate the script for his theatre’s next show.
Harry took a sip of his beer and swiped his tongue over his upper lip to get the foam. Draco tried not to think about it. “It’s fine. I should have seen it coming, I think.” He looked down into his mug, contemplative. “I...I don’t think I ever really loved her, Draco. I think we were each other’s source of comfort during the final years of the war, and then we just...stagnated.”
How would he explain everything to the kids, he wondered. Draco knew Scorpius likely had heard of some of his past - the other children probably had as well, but, if they had, they never brought it up. Draco thought it was to respect his privacy, even though he and Harry had long ago established an open-door policy for any questions they had.
At Harry’s nod and smile, Weasley’s face twisted into a frown. It looked like he had tasted something particularly disgusting. “Harry, what the hell is Malfoy doing here?”
This was odd. Scorpius had always been cunning - he inherited that from Draco - but he was never likely to carry anything out. If anything, he came up with schemes and had someone else execute them so that he wouldn’t have to take the fall.
Harry didn’t say anything, but Draco could tell he was just mulling over his words. Finally, he whispered, “You saw this coming, didn’t you?”
That must be the curse of being a parent, Draco mused in his chair. One can’t protect their children from every heartbreak.
Harry sucked in a breath. “I doubt it’ll get any better. I told Ginny I’d meet her for coffee tomorrow to discuss everything away from the kids.”
Draco wondered where they received their volatile emotions. Harry was bullheaded, stubborn, and authoritative, but he rarely showed any sort of feeling around others. Draco always chalked it up to his hero complex; Harry couldn’t play the savior everyone adored if he cried all the time.
Finally, Ginny said, “I requested to meet you and Harry so I could ask if I could rebuild my relationship with the kids.”
Draco sighed dramatically and slumped onto the daybed. “Ella, my darling, please do kill me now before I do so myself.”
“I’m not sure.” Draco bit his lip and received a smack on the arm. “Look, everything is okay. Tonight will just be...unexpected for you, and I just wanted to tell you that I love you.”
There was a light in the attic of Grimmauld Place. From where he stood on the sidewalk, Draco could see a shadow shifting about up there - likely Harry. But what Harry could be doing up there, Draco couldn’t guess. Harry generally avoided the place like the plague - it was once Sirius’s room, and it was too drenched in memories to be safe.
He wanted to make a joke of it. He’d lost nearly everything now, and it felt like retribution. This was his penance for all the wrong he had done, and Draco was fine with it, honestly.
Draco let out a dramatic sigh, tossing his bag in the corner and plopping ungraciously in his desk chair. Distantly, he thought his mother would have been appalled. “My husband’s ex-wife will be in town on holiday for the weekend and wants to see the kids.”
“Careful, dear, you’re going to catch flies,” he said with a grin. He looked back in the mirror for a second before turning back to her. “How do I look? Not bad for an old man, I hope?”
“But then you think of all the good memories you have and realize their leaving isn’t so bad after all,” he finished. Then, he gave each of his stepchildren a stern look. “I want you to know I’m not trying to make you feel guilty by saying this. You are all entitled to your feelings about this situation, and that is perfectly normal and valid.”
Potter must have brought him here, when he fell asleep after their talk… he shudders. Then, he sighs. Miller is best left in the box where forgotten memories are kept, along with Crabbe,
beside Draco, holding him close while pressing a line of kisses down his temple, and Draco . . . Draco is so exhausted. He's far too exhausted to even brush Potter away.
It’s hard work, what they have him doing at the bar. That much is true. So hard indeed Draco’s taken to being really, really grateful for having magic on his side when he goes home. Especially when washing yet another glass might make his fingers drastically fall off, with how jaded they feel all day long. But at least he gets paid, even if not quite as much as before. And anyway—Draco shudders in revulsion—he likes what he’s doing now much, much better than lying back down and spreading his legs for others. This is nowhere near as shameful as that was.
Morosely, a thought goes through his mind: that he’s not going to be here forever. Draco doesn’t want to lose this, these brief moments that mean everything.
At least not the bit about how badly he wanted to lick them. (And he did want to lick them. Still does.)
"No, listen to me," she demands. "He does travel a lot, and there are, what, hundreds of different magical illnesses? Thousands?"
He knows that, and he knows some promises are important enough to keep, even if it takes years for it to happen.
Draco’s glance, in turn, drops venom. “So sorry for not being up to your magnificent standards,” he sneers. He’s really quite affronted. He doesn’t think he’s any of that, not anymore. In fact, he’s not even sure he’s ever been both at the same time, especially when those terms are basically opposites.
“Definitely. You used to be like this,” she says, holding up her pinky, “and now… what, Potter hasn’t noticed yet?”
"You know what? Fine!" Potter's breathing is coming faster now, and Draco can feel the heat of Potter's magic on his skin. But he can't remember why it once made him feel safe. "Fine, I'll go. You won't even have to worry about me coming back, it's not as if I'd
Draco can’t answer that. Inside, he’s panicking slightly. He is already considering it, and that’s not exactly good news. It’s leaving another hole open—a hole his soul could accidentally slip through, a hole far too close to his heart.
with you?” Three tissues and an incommensurate number of tears later, she finally told him: “Ron died two years ago, one of his new inventions blasted and took him with it.”
The whole world seems to have slowed magnificently, to the point where Draco is stepping on his own toes out of pure clumsiness.
His smile is met with a kiss, Harry’s lips are salty when he tastes them. There’s yet another kiss, and another one and then Harry says, his hands resting on Draco’s shoulders, “Well then, I’m hoping here you also know your life can’t get much more normal than
Draco doubts it. Without him, Harry would have found another way, and he doubts Harry really believes a word he's saying. It's probably the life debt speaking, but still, Draco's throat feels thick, as if he were about to cry, and he can't help falling a little in love with every new word because no one,
"Well, yeah, I wanted that, at some point. It's just, I'm not so sure anymore—I mean, I don't want following dark wizards to be the rest of my life. I know it's what people expect of me but . . ." Harry opened his mouth and closed it, and then, just when Draco thought he'd given up on whatever else he'd been going to say, opened it again to add, "I don't know. To be honest, I think I've done my bit by now."
"I told him—" Potter hesitates. "I told him I could have him fired if I wanted to—I told him . . . and then he went and handed in his resignation, how is that not my fault?"
he liked that, but he seriously does now. He wonders for a moment if him being pregnant has anything to do with this. It doesn’t last long though, as he sucks in a breath when Harry moves lower and puts his mouth on his belly. Right where it gets soft and vulnerable.
The first touch of their mouths is soft, almost more of a brush than a kiss. But then Draco, who’s nothing if not determined when it comes to kissing Potter, leans forward, pressing his lips harder against Potter’s as he tilts his head slightly to one side.
(Yes, with a song. Only this time it’s not some violin virtuoso born in Italy, almost three centuries ago. Muggles tend to call her the Queen of Pop on the Web. He often wonders, does that have anything to do with popcorn?)
“Really?” Washing machine, huh? He’ll have to search Google for that when he gets home, his best guess is that it’s a machine that washes something—what though, he has no clue. “It must have been terrible.” He’s trying here, mostly because her face looks like it was.
"You have a visitor," his mother tells him a few weeks later, when he returns from his daily wanderings through the town and its outskirts. Draco has met quite a few people in the months he's been there, so when he opens the door to the living room to find Potter standing there, he's understandably surprised.
. It just loops over itself repeating the same mistake again and again until you fix it within the code. And that’s what happens here, too, only instead of spelling things wrong, you just need to mispronounce a single...”
When they come back from their holidays, Harry is even colder to him, and Draco has no idea how to fix that. Their eyes meet occasionally, across the room, but Harry's gaze is guarded now and there's a small frown between his brows. Draco can't read him anymore.
“I feel like the other one would have been for me,” Ron, the ghost, said, and Harry answered, “Indeed. And pay attention to whatever she’s saying because that’s also meant for you.”
Her eyes are fixed on Draco's face as if she were trying to read his thoughts—and if Draco didn't know she's always been pants at Legilimency, he might have been a tiny bit scared. As it is though, he's merely tired—tired of keeping secrets, tired of lying to his friends—to his
“Or quite a lot, rather…” Draco adds, a filthy smile on his face, and that finally goes through the cover up Potter is trying to keep. At last, Potter cracks a smile. At last, Potter touches him again, remorse left behind with Weasel’s sis and the fight.
"It's okay, Malfoy. Forgotten, really." Potter had looked down at his shoes then, shrugged lightly before apparently deciding to dig the knife deeper and twist it. "We just did what we had to do, right?"
Draco mostly thinks he’s a tiny, tiny replica of himself. He didn’t even get Potter’s eyes, or his hair—on one side he’s grateful, as he’s not too sure he’d particularly enjoy the daily reminder of one of his biggest mistakes. Still, he agrees with her.
(It’s not like his prick feels raw from all the wanking he’s been doing. It’s not like his forearm hurts so much he’s now wanking with his left hand.)
Gradually, the letters stop arriving. He still gets a weekly parchment from Pansy and, once, a Ministry reminder that he ought to pay his taxes in the UK—which he knew already and will do eventually, thank you very much—but that's all. After a while, there are no more angry letters from customers, and no more demands that their orders should be taken care of even though the shop is now closed.
"'Seeker Potter to go on week-long holiday to France after Quidditch World Cup, along with his current girlfriend'," she quotes, her polished nails trailing under the headline as she reads. She looks vaguely expectant, as if she thinks Draco must be dying to talk to someone—
“Potter, duh.” Honestly, he doesn’t even need to see her. The sheer tone of her voice is more than enough for Draco to picture her eyes rolling. “Obviously.”
He flicks a quick look at Potter. Come to think of it, perhaps Potter is, as in his complete lack of poorness he still somehow manages to dress like a church mouse. In all honesty, all Draco wanted was to do the shopping himself, just so he could keep a small part of the change. He’s obviously not going to ask
“We…” Potter pauses, thinking for a moment, as if he’s not too sure he should be talking to Draco about… whatever it is he’s going to say. “We had a bit of a fight, Ginny and me.”
On the short walk from the Ministry to the nearest Starbucks, Hermione kept talking about this new thing they had her doing all the way down there, in the Department of Mysteries.
But still, Draco's never told anyone about it. He's trying to be more cautious this time around, and besides, he guesses Potter hasn't told any of his friends either. Draco sees Longbottom—who's shockingly still friends with Potter, despite the whole bonding fiasco—and one of the Weasley twins rather regularly at work, and none of them have yet threatened to turn his head into a cabbage. Draco guesses that must mean they don't know.
They fumble with each other's clothes until they're both lying naked on the couch, the hard planes of Potter's body fitting perfectly between Draco's thighs, and Draco has to bite down a gasp as Potter's cock slides against his own. It's shocking how well they still fit together, even after being apart for so long.
"I told you that you wouldn't get very far," Potter's voice came through the doorway. "You seriously thought I hadn't tried that myself?"
Draco does try to keep both of them down, but apparently one of his eyebrows has life itself: it seems to rise without previous command. Admittedly, scolding someone for not being on time—even though this one time it’s perhaps warranted—is not the best way to welcome anyone. “My apologies,” Draco says. “I just got the appointment.”
And then there’s Walburga’s, on the stairs’ crossing. Potter hid her behind a blanket. It’s sometimes fun to lift a corner just to watch Potter’s jaw drop. She praises Draco for things he’s not, but the face Potter makes is, seriously, priceless.
"I might have noticed you were much busier than you used to be, so either you'd been meeting with him or you were doing something illegal," Pansy says, and she looks so smug all Draco can do is glare, frozen as he is with a chess piece in his hand. "And by the way," she adds, "if you
(It’s definitely not Potter he spends all day thinking about. There are other people up there, definitely. It’s not like Potter is his wank fantasy, though he has to admit he’s actually a great fantasy. He’s definitely thinking of other people, too. It’s just a shame they all happen to look quite a bit like Potter. Or,
Draco buries his face in his pillow, but he can still hear the door slide open and Pansy's nervous steps as she walks closer to his bed. She sits beside him, running a hand through his hair.
It had been true in the past, but right then, it felt like there was some sort of special magic between them. A kind of subtle energy Draco couldn't quite understand, but that kept pushing and pushing under his skin, pushing them closer, making Draco's heart beat faster whenever Potter was in the room—which was to say almost always, except when Potter was in the bathroom next door—and Draco thought . . . well, he didn't think it was the bond. He thought perhaps it had always been there, even before everything went wrong—before they both landed themselves in the Hospital Wing, before their potions accident. Only back then, Potter was never around for long.
Instead, there's Draco naked underneath the sheets, his clothes strewn all over the floor, and then there's Potter, naked as well—naked and
“Well.” Pansy laughs, again, but there’s something dangerously desperate in it. “This is huge. Massive, even.”
“Bollocks. Let them hold grudges,” Harry whispers, his arms tightening around him. A shudder of want shivers down Draco’s spine. “It’s not like I care,” Potter adds. “You—” he turns Draco’s head towards him, a hand under his chin “—shouldn’t care either. We’re together in this, that’s all that matters, alright?”
“Never mind. Listen, you won’t remember but we talked yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that...”
his father.” Draco’s hands clench into fists. “His father is that bloke who kicked me out of his home when he found out about…” His own lips press tightly closed—he can’t say it, he won’t say it. He doesn’t want to feel like that again, like he’s useless. He’s doing something with his life now: he’s working a decent job, he’s taking care of Scorpius. He is
“Voyeur,” Draco says, while Potter pulls him close. Hands sliding up Draco’s back, trapping him in an embrace he doesn’t want out of. “That’s what you are.”
because it's far too embarrassing and far too complicated to discuss. He's not entirely sure what he wants more: to break Potter's ridiculously straight nose, or to throw him down on the ground and have his way with him, until neither of them can do much more than moan into each other's mouths. And it's a mess. It's all a bloody mess, so he never mentions it to Pansy.
He doesn’t have to. Pansy’s free tomorrow. He could leave Scorpius with her. She keeps complaining he’s a pest, but Draco knows (his tiny little monster is the most precious human-shaped living being on Earth) it’s said lovingly (and she is indeed the one largely massive pest standing in that whole house).
And that's the whole problem, isn't it? He's wanted so many different things from Potter, but not once has Draco wanted out.
He sometimes contemplates writing to Potter, just so Potter will have a chance to write back. But he's not stupid. He knows nothing would hurt more than writing that letter to have it go unanswered, so he never tries.
“You wouldn’t last for very long out there, Draco. Last time you tried to do that, you couldn’t even get one of their passwords.”
Harry drops his fork. "Really?" He looks like he's going to laugh or cry, or possibly even do both at the same time.
Draco laughs once, bitterly, because if only she knew how much—how often—he's wished that was closer to the truth . . . but it's not.
“No, I didn’t,” Potter says, quite dejectedly, “but sometimes I wish I had. I wouldn’t have to remember other people dying around me, people I
It’s nothing but a suggestion. But somehow a suggestion that’s now stuck in his mind, and no matter how hard he shakes his head it’s not leaving. “I am not falling for your words of advice again. Honestly, keep your tip-offs to yourself.”
"Didn't you know?" Bones tells him eventually. "He's on sick leave. Bad case of Black Cat Flu, apparently." She grimaces. "Will probably be gone for a few days."
"Potions. I've been working on my thesis, so I haven't had much time to go out or—" Draco shrugs, "—socialise, I guess."
“I don’t think I’d be against that.” There’s quite a bit of amusement in his voice. “Please, go ahead. I’d rather like to watch—”
Of course that's not the end of it for Pansy. "You do realise he's never going to leave her for you, don't you?" she asks him the following day, as she steps through the tinted doors into Draco's workshop.
"No, I…" Harry pushes him back with so much strength Draco's skull collides painfully with the wall, and for a moment he's almost deafened by the persistent silence of his brain flatlining. He can't let that stop him. "Stop avoiding me," he says.
Potter swears, stretching an arm over the back of couch. There are a few whispered words before something hard slaps into Potter's hand, and then Draco can feel a slick finger rubbing at his entrance. "Okay?"
His mother's frown deepens, and Draco is certain she must have caught on to his last ditch attempt to avoid this conversation. But thankfully, she doesn't ask again.
He reckons Father might have disagreed with him there, likely thinking both jobs rate equally in the distasteful scale. Given Father’s ideals though, Draco is prone to believing he got stuck living in a different century—likely the nineteenth, with Queen Victoria ruling over Britain; prosperity and domestic prudery, girls in long skirts and complacency being all Lucius valued most. Yet, Father is Father and not him. By now, Draco can send Father’s thoughts to hell and wish them to stay there forever. If it weren’t for him, Mother would still be alive, and he wouldn’t have the Mark etched into his skin.
It stings like a thousand needles trying to crawl their way through his skin. It stings so much it takes Draco several seconds to register the cracks of Apparition around them, and he's only faintly aware of Harry dragging him behind cover, all the while mumbling, "You bloody idiot…"
He’s not too keen on being prey again. It’s too humiliating. He reckons he’s had enough of that up to now. He has the last tiny bits of what he calls his ego, whatever is left of it. Draco’s clutching dearly to them, thank you very much, even if most days it feels a bit like clutching at straws slipping through his fingers. He’s really not looking forward to making himself a victim again, not if it can be avoided, especially considering that to most of the Wizarding World he
to want, but he can’t help it. He does kind of want that. He just doesn’t want it for a day or two—he’d want it forever, but Potter here is the farthest thing from trustworthy he can think of. And honestly, he can think of plenty of untrustworthy things. Like his luck. “Or we could have tea, no alcohol there. How about tea? Shall I make some?”
at all. It’s just insane. “What else could I have done? It’s not that I didn’t trust you, I couldn’t even trust
"Because this will work far better," Draco grits out. He holds his breath, counting to ten in his head as the blood-red veil of anger clouding his vision melts away. "You want it to be perfect, right? Well, this is as perfect as it gets."
He takes a second to memorise the soft curve of Potter’s face. The way his bottom lip, full and chewed on—boy, he really loves that look on him, the one he gets whenever he ponders over something, anything—seems absolutely perfect. The way his eyelashes shadow his cheeks whenever he blinks. His eyes, green as spring grass, green as Slytherin, as new leaves on a maple tree, search Draco’s, as if he knew there are questions he’s not uttering.
It would have been easier if they'd had a sample of Longbottom's potion, Draco guessed, if Slughorn hadn't vanished it so quickly. If only they'd been able to study it.
, Pans." Draco feels the tightening of his throat, the sharp pricking of tears behind his eyelids, and wants to hex himself for being so bloody sensitive of late—so
As he leaves, he’s not thinking it bloody hurts that Potter is willing to settle for Scorpius over him. He doesn’t feel battered and bruised from being Potter’s second best. Not at all.
Draco would ignore him. When their lips met, slow and tentative, Harry's fingers would sink deep in Draco's hair to pull him closer. Harry's mouth would open for him. Harry would hum happily against his lips, melt against him, spreading his legs in invitation, and it'd be just as hot and wet and brilliant as his dreams back in sixth year.
“They took my life away, Potter.” Honestly, guilt is being truly unreasonable here. He shouldn’t feel it now, not when that part is true. “I can’t even find a decent job. I can’t… I have
,” he corrects. “It’s the tiny book with manky pictures that don’t move.” Not like the videos on YouTube. He wonders how they do that. Muggles seem true masters at living without magic.
“Wow.” She shook her head, looking like she might cry again. “That was perhaps more honesty than I wanted.”
He was surprised to see that despite the disastrous training session, the formations they’d practised (attempted to practise) were working beautifully. Dorcas, Denise and Avery, on Chaser rotas, were moving together in a beautiful uniformity Harry would not have believed five and six year olds capable of, torpedoing through the opposite defence and scoring another goal. Behind them Love and Jamie were attacking Bludgers with a terrifying ferocity—one Bludger whizzed past Faulkner’s head, ruffling his curls in the process. He was so startled he nearly fell off his broom and forgot to give out any kind of penalties.
“I’m serious about the flat. I can cover the rent on my own, but…” Harry shrugged. “You know how it is.”
Once inside and back at work, fetching maps from the strongroom, Harry realised he’d forgotten to ask about Malfoy’s Muggle Studies. He’d ask later.
“Oh,” Draco said, his shoulders firming up. He blinked. “I wouldn’t want to impose,” he started, but Seamus waved the protest off.
“Thanks, that’s all,” Lee said, switching off the recorder. “Off the record and all personal: are you free to babysit sometime in the next two weeks? I want to take George and Angelina out for an evening, no kids.”
“Yes. You too!” Harry called after her. He looked at the books Malfoy had brought, but instead of examining them he put them away. Then he went to the front desk and went over the collection of pamphlets and brochures they had displayed beneath the clock until he found the one about the archivist course.
Maybe, if Harry could complete the moving in process, it would make a difference. As if by unpacking some boxes he could…magically fix what was wrong between him and Ginny. Or fill up that hole inside that should be all for Ginny, that strange, unalive mass at his core that did nothing but cause him anxiety whenever he tried to wake it up.
Harry kissed him. Draco took his hand and once they were out of the stadium, Apparated them to Godric’s Hollow, where he took Harry to an ancient bookstore that smelled of dust, oak and tobacco, and that also served tea and coffee. He got Harry an entire pot of black tea, a table under a window that overlooked a grassy field with sheep, and several brilliant smiles.
“No,” Malfoy said. “I just…I have anxiety. I don’t do well in crowds or around unfamiliar people.” He was quiet for a bit, looking straight ahead. The blizzard had left behind a heap of snow, some of which was already melting and turning into dirty slush. Not in the garden, here the snow was still more or less pristine, save for bird tracks on the ground. “I’m in therapy, actually. For anxiety and other things. It’s why I’m writing a book. My therapist said I should keep a journal or something, so I decided to write a book.”
“Just because.” There was a reason, but Harry wanted to talk about that even less than he’d wanted to talk about the Auror programme. “They’re great, right? I had help from the kids.”
The barn turned out to be a semi-run-down building from the 17th century, located a fair distance from the Malfoy Manor but still within the grounds. A short distance away was the farmhouse associated with it. Both the barn and the farmhouse had been in use until the First War, Draco explained, until Voldemort had killed the Muggle family who’d rented that bit of land from the Malfoys to farm on it. The farmhouse Draco had already repaired a few years back and then partitioned the land it was on off from the rest of the Malfoy estate and given the lot to relatives of the family who’d lived there (they’d sold it, and now a different Muggle family was living there). The fields of arable land within the estates he’d also partitioned off and given to neighbouring farmers (all Muggles, bar one), and the barn…well, he’d kept it.
When Harry finally stepped out of the shower, his fingers were prune-y and his skin scalded, and the bedroom smelled like sex. The bed was a mess, a familiar site of destruction, and Harry—Harry suddenly had
Malfoy shrugged. “It is. The general ideology seems to be that if it can’t be fixed with a potion or magic, it can’t be fixed at all. But Muggle therapy—it’s a relatively new thing here, there’s just the one clinic and it’s run by Muggleborns who, rightly, thought not enough was being done for mental illness in the magical community.”
“I’d love to, but I have homework.” And a book about robots to get back to…though the temptation to stay and watch the Harpies throttle the Magpies was strong. “It should be a short game, right?”
Oliver resumed the game, and while it continued in a less dirty manner it was clear that both teams were playing for blood. (Or a very large chocolate trophy.)
“Yeah—she founded it. Don’t be fooled by my extremely aristocratic white English packaging. I got that all from my dad.” Gilliam shrugged, but he was smiling proudly. “Blaise showed me your painting, the one he keeps in the bedroom? It’s very good.”
Harry had Quidditch Daycare on Monday mornings, so he wasn’t at the Archive until after lunch. He inquired with Albert, but Malfoy hadn’t come by—yet. Malfoy hadn’t said when he’d come in again or asked when Harry would be in, for the matter of it, so Harry didn’t know if he’d come at all. He took over front desk duty from Mildred, checked the visitor logs and made a quick round of the reading hall, and settled back behind the desk.
“Creepy,” Draco repeated, then shrugged. “I eventually got tired of being a dysfunctional mess and got myself into treatment, to therapy, and medication, which was a struggle and a half, and when I’d been doing that for a while and improving and just generally…turning into a human being again, I went back to the property I was working on. I finished it up. A few hours here, a half day there, five minutes sweeping, that sort of thing. What I could manage at any given time. And therapy. Then as I got better, I started doing other things. That was when I came to the Archive, you know. For a while there all I did was the repairs, my research, and therapy.”
“What’s he like, these days?” Ron asked. “I haven’t seen him around in a while. He dropped off the grid. Thought he’d left the country.”
“An ensuite for us, and a family bathroom for the kids,” Draco answered. “And I thought of building all the furniture myself, and a new flight of stairs—I recently learned how to warp wood with steam, so I could make a really nice curved banister—and I thought about putting in hardwood floors. Maybe something bright, like whitewashed pine—”
There had to be something wrong with that. All right, Percy tended to be embarrassed about public displays of affection, but he engaged in them all the same. But he and Ginny…they’d always been private, though even in private Harry had never gone for cuddling when he could just look at her instead. Surely that was fine? Not everyone had to be like…a Valentine’s Day postcard, right?
“I don’t know. It was kind of boring I guess?” Harry frowned. “And frustrating. I didn’t like the bit where they break up. It was stupid.”
Alice glanced at Hugh, who had the decency to look shamefaced, and held out her hand. Her broom zipped up without her even saying a single word.
Draco stood up, collecting his hat. Harry shifted in his chair, ready to get up. “Yeah. Look, I—what now?”
“There is a point in that book somewhere, buried under all the crazy,” Malfoy said. “Not a lesson, exactly, but a kind of uncomfortable truth that no writer since has dared to express.” He held up one hand in imitation of a scale. “So on the one hand the novel is critically acclaimed for that.” He raised the other hand, now weighing the two. “And on the other it’s 400 years old, so the fact that it hasn’t been done again is in itself an uncomfortable truth.”
“I have a job I love,” Harry said, thinking of his daycare. “I’m captain of a Quidditch team—it’s a magical sport played on brooms—for charity, I’m in college getting my degree,
“Awakening? Nothing is awake in me,” Harry said. “That’s kind of the problem.” He paused. “Bisexual doesn’t sound too bad though.” Except for the sex part of bisexual. That made it a pretty stupid word, all things considered. But it still made room for all these feelings he was having about Malfoy, so maybe it was good for something.
All of the hurt and upset from the breakup had as good as evaporated the second Ginny had walked out, leaving behind only hopelessness and anger. As it turned out, when one was angry and dejected, reading about humans and aliens in space not doing much else but existing and having relationships and cross-cultural blunders was strangely uplifting. There was a political subplot, but not one that had democracy and welfare weighed against war and death and it was…nice.
“Yeah, well, you’ll find out soon enough,” Harry said. “Once you get kids. When your kids get big enough to start trouble, all bets are off.”
“Yeah,” Harry said. “Thank you. I didn’t know any of it before.” He poured up the rest of the tea. “How do I know if there are still house-elves in Grimmauld Place?”
Merlin’s balls on a stick, no wonder his relationship with Ginny had imploded. No wonder—Harry’s breath hitched.
Harry tracked mud after him when he met Malfoy for lunch at the archive. “I know, I know,” he said, swishing his wand about and getting rid of most of the dirt, “you’d think I’d have learned to use weatherproof charms after all these years as a wizard.”
Instantly, the bath bomb started fizzing, a trail of pink, blue and yellow behind it as it went. At first there wasn’t much of a scent, but then suddenly it was there, rich vanilla rising out of the water to fill the room.
“Tell me what you like,” Harry said, wanting to let Draco have everything. He’d give him everything. And Draco was good, kept talking, directing Harry, and giving praise, and he was beautiful, really. Flushed, and happy, and vibrant.
Harry had always thought he and Ginny would’ve had one or two little ones by now, but when he’d brought it up she’d said no. Harry had started a daycare instead. And now he and Ginny were a thing of the past and Harry was…relieved. Relieved that he was relieved, because that meant breaking up had been the right thing to do.
“I’m sorry—you’re right. I shouldn’t have asked.” Harry’s stomach pinched and he suddenly didn’t feel like finishing his lunch.
“It’s…” Harry shrugged. “I don’t really know. It’s relaxing, I guess.” They were walking close enough together that Harry could touch his elbow to Malfoy’s, so he did. “I bet you have some kind of reading room to read in, with a nice chair and all.”
“You need to learn where your boundaries are. Communicate with your partner what you’d like to try—or not try. Stop when you have to. Make sure you respect his boundaries, too.”
The tree was easily dealt with: a swish with a wand put the fire out, and a flick produced a stream of water to drench the smouldering remains, just in case there were still live embers in the tree. The brooms—well, the brooms could wait. Addressing the crying and the cause of the crying (and the cause of the fire and the unresponsive brooms) was next.
Calling in sick was a mistake. He should’ve stayed at work. He shouldn’t have cancelled practice either. He should’ve…he shouldn’t have let Draco leave, he should’ve tried harder, he should write him again, he should, he should, he should.
The parents disentangled themselves and soon all twelve kids were gazing up at him and positively vibrating with excitement.
He avoided the Manor by a wide berth, but behind it he spotted a roof behind a copse of trees about a Quidditch pitch’s length away, and what was more, there was smoke coming out of the chimney. Somebody was home, and Harry hoped it was Draco.
“Yup. It’s a happy one. Always puts me in a good mood.” Harry directed him to the appropriate pile. He watched as Draco, barely controlling his excitement, turned the colourful bath bomb over in his hands, sniffing it and studying the label. “It makes the water look like a galaxy,” Harry told him. “All colourful and sparkly. Until it all gets mixed together in the end, but there’s a lot of glitter and it smells really good.”
Harry exchanged a few pleasantries with them—apparently Roxanne had made the walls sing just the other day—and then headed out of the stadium. The journalists had mostly left, though a few were conversing with the celebrity coaches and the stands were filling up more as the game would soon be underway.
song-and-dance. He’d watched Percy and Oliver squirm uncomfortably through it, seen George, Lee and Angelina on the defence more than once, witnessed Pansy’s raised hackles, and Padma’s carefully calculated defiance.
When he’d finished the roll and made his way through half of another one, he spoke again. “What kind of books do you like to read?”
“No, no, I just noticed that Pansy didn’t talk about you anymore. Never mind, go on, you were saying.”
“Thank you.” Harry leaned in to kiss her. “Do you know more people with five-year-olds who would like to play for chocolate?”
Harry’s heart sank. This wasn’t new information, not by far—and he’d known her long enough to know that. It’d just…never disappointed him before.
“I should bloody well hope so,” Millicent added. “I need to fucking breathe. Oi, Pans. Who do you know who’s single?”
“Okay.” Draco paused uncertainly by the front desk, manned by Mildred today, and turned to face Harry. “If that’s all…”
A quarter of an hour before closing, Malfoy came to the front desk. He was pushing the trolley ahead of him. Harry eyed the trolley, then Malfoy, who was fidgeting.
“It’s not so bad, is it? Nobody’s given me any grief about it. Though I suppose I’ll be fielding questions from journalists tomorrow after the game...What about your parents?”
“You might,” Harry said. “Maybe not now, but later. That’s what—” That’s what happened with Ginny, he nearly said. She hadn’t said so, but he had seen it in her eyes, read it in her body language every time they’d fought about it. “I wish sex didn’t exist,” he said, viciously. “I hate it.” He immediately regretted saying it and was about to backtrack when Draco just nodded.
queer friends about Big Gay Pub Night, a small handful of Quidditch players that Harry didn’t know had turned up, too. They’d set Draco on edge for a hot minute, but once it was clear they were there to chill he’d relaxed again.
“Yeah, okay. I’ll stay for the game. Damn it.” He shook his head. “But then you have to come over tomorrow and pick up your things.”
He closed his eyes and drew in a deep breath. Exhaled. Opened his eyes again and focused on the pamphlets in front of him.
“Okay,” Harry said, to no one in particular. He leaned back in the chair. Nobody was in the Archive but him—correction: nobody was in the public areas of the Archive; the archivists were at work in their offices and work rooms and down in the strongrooms, cataloguing collections or conserving documents or whatever it was that real archivists did, and that Harry didn’t.
He’d also become keenly aware that every day he had been looking forward to a few minutes of awkward conversation with Malfoy, and that he probably shouldn’t have been.
“Imperialism,” Harry replied promptly. “Same reason why we’ve got Scottish and Welsh documents, and a number of other things that don’t strictly belong to us. There are other archives around, mostly small local ones, but we have a staggering amount of important documents here.”
“It’s fine! Another time is fine.” Harry glanced towards the front desk, where Albert was going over the Archive’s correspondence, then back at Malfoy. “Uhm, I finished that book.”
“You probably don’t have to convert your daycare,” Ginny said as they got off the train. “You could probably register the team independently of the daycare. That way they don’t all have to join the team if they don’t want to, and you can schedule team practice at normal team practice hours in the early evening which opens the team up for more kids.”
Harry fed the request form into a different slot in the trolley and waited while three thousand coroner reports made their way to him, floating out of boxes and folders through the air to stack themselves neatly in the trolley. As he waited, the request form copied itself, the copy wandering off to file itself in the archive’s request history ledger.
“That,” Draco said, nodding towards Padma. “Magical repairs work short term on minor damage, but the effect will inevitably wear off. It’s not like a healing spell; wood isn’t alive in the same sense as a human is. The human body will repair itself, and the spells help with that process. Wood and rock and metal can’t knit itself back together.”
“Oh, sorry. I’m his cousin. Harry. Should I call at another time? Or is there no Dudley at this address?”
“You’ve made headway with these,” Harry commented as he prepared the new request form. He’d deducted a considerable number of reports from the pile.
This was boggling Harry’s mind. “How come? I mean, we never saw them—I didn’t even realise there were house-elves at Hogwarts until I went to the kitchens…”
Yes. He’d do that. Harry swallowed the last bite of toast and washed it down with orange juice. He’d have a shower, shave—he’d gotten a bit stubbly—find a gift, and then go. Everything else on the list he’d figure out as he went along.
