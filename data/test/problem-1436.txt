Harry squinted and his eyes flickered before meeting Draco’s again. “DADA lesson?” He tilted his head. “Third year ..... yes.” He was starting to remember. “W-We were going to discuss Vampires. Scorpius has a lot of questions.”
Harry only ever looked away from Draco to glance at Daphne Greengrass, Astoria’s sister, and apparently, the only one to ever visit her. He felt a bit bad for Astoria. Ever since the war, she had drastically changed. She wanted nothing to do with the old ways and Harry was proud of her. But that left her alone and isolated. He decided that if she ever woke up, he would try to talk to her more. Since her old friends and most of her family didn’t really care for her, she ought to have new friends. She deserves as much.
Draco recognized the nervousness. “Harry, relax. I don’t care if you cum soon. If anything, I’d love if you came. Is that what you want, then? Do you want to cum inside me? Do you want me to make you cum?” He bit his lip and let out a moan. He greatly enjoyed being able to tease Harry.
With a lack of interest in history, he didn’t study the chapter on his father. This made him unaware of the true extent to the war and completely oblivious to abuse. Therefore, he was blissfully unaware of why Harry was so freaked by shouting, loud noises, and sudden bright lights.
In their room, Draco’s bed was closest to the bathroom. He had just sat down on it when he heard Harry’s chilling words. His blood ran cold and he froze, wondering what could possibly be going on in the bathroom.
“I’m also sorry. I’m sorry for the circumstances in which we got together. I’m sorry for how rough it was in the beginning. I’m sorry that you probably felt like shit for a while and I wasn’t doing much to make it better.” That was something he had been thinking about for a while but never said.
Soft muscles, tanned skin, scars littering his flesh, the dark hair that ran down his body, the gentle V imprinted into his hips. Draco's eyes were guided downward and it was all so gorgeous. He saw Harry panting to catch his breath, getting a glimpse of what he might have looked like when he was in his room only two days ago.
Draco felt a warmth embrace his body and he smiled at the strange ruggedness of the man. It was very easily because of his stubble, ability to start fires, and the fact that he was stronger than Draco. Something about it all felt so different from the primmer boys that Draco was used to, they would never look like this or do the things Harry could. Something about it was strangely exotic to him, and that was exciting, but he was just familiar enough that the blonde was still comfortable.
"Seriously?" A grin spread across her face and she felt hope bubbling up in her stomach. She knew she'd win with Harry on her side.
There came a pause as Harry realized he was the driving force of The Cupboard Project, Pawk's bill, and Crow and Pansy's St. Mungo's reform. Harry had all the cards and he was forcing everyone to play his game. By tossing around favors, he got the Searcy siblings’ support, Crow and Pansy’s influence, and Greenwood’s unwavering subordination. Through charm he got Alexis Wright’s vote. With subtle manipulation he got Crow on their side, not to mention how he built up and knocked down Luther’s career and political party at will, for the premeditated purpose of eating up the opposition, one by one. He had everything at his disposal. He made the game, he gave everyone their cards, and still, he told them what moves to make. He orchestrated a dance that everyone followed flawlessly. At no point was he not in control. For reasons that he wasn’t proud of, he actually enjoyed his work. It was strangely fun. But he could never confess that.
“Of course I am. They’re out of excuses. What is it, twentieth of September? I’ll have them together before Halloween.”
They talked about classes, their futures, family members that had been arrested, crushes, all the normal teenage bullshit.
“Not officially.” Ron spoke as if they were in total agreement that this was, in fact, a competition.
Usually, there were 560 students at Hogwarts, but when he entered the Great Hall, he saw that the number was greatly reduced. So much so, that he could count the remaining students if he wanted to.
A hand reached up to scratch at his throat while he tilted his head back, keening for air but unable to fill his lungs. His heart pounded in his ears as a headache slowly crept forth. He dropped his head and stayed in a ball, preferring to hold himself over trying to take in air that wasn't there.
Draco nodded in agreement. But the moment Harry pulled his hand away, Draco blurted out, “Harry’s still a virgin.”
Draco did his best to stop a grin from slipping onto his face as he nodded. Of course he loved the idea of Harry showing skin, but he didn't want to make it obvious.
Draco let out a laugh and shook his head. “And you wonder why I”m so confident, you make it easy. But then again, with my arse on the line, it’s tempting to lose.”
Harry read the paragraph about himself aloud. “The Potter family gained their riches through a cycle of inventing potions and selling the companies for a fortune, while still retaining a large portion of the stock. This guarantees their riches will only grow through the years. The Potter line has come down to one Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived and saved not only magic society, but potentially the world from Voldemort’s plans. Rumor has it Potter’s been working in the Muggle economy to bring in thousands more each month, working to support both himself and his godson, Edward Lupin, son of war heroes Remus and Nymphadora Lupin. Did we mention he’s single? See more on Harry Potter in our top ten most desirable bachelors list on page 24.” He rolled his eyes and passed the magazine around for his friends to see. He figured somebody at the bank snitched to the journalist about where his money was coming from.
Harry nodded. “I uh. Didn’t have anywhere safe to put them. I figured keeping them with me at all times would be safe.”
Narcissa shared in his strange smile. “I think that's the best way to look at it.” It hurt to hear her son say that about his father, but by the same token, she knew it was best for him to think like that. He’d never stay sane if he didn’t.
Later, Draco was pulled from sleep by gentle fingers running through his hair and a soft voice telling him to wake up. Gentle shivers ran down his spine from the fingers in his hair. It was so relaxing but it occasionally set off electricity in his body. He tilted his head back into the hand, eliciting a chuckle above him. He groaned weakly and slowly opened his eyes. He found that his head was on Harry’s lap, he looked up and saw Harry was playing with his hair. He gave a soft smile but he felt a pang in his heart. He realized that this, this exact moment, was everything he ever could have wanted.
Draco stared down at him, his eyes getting a bit more intense with arousal. “Don’t tempt me like this. You aren’t ready for that Harry.”
“It’s no problem. Happens to the best of us.” An apology wasn’t how Draco thought Harry would respond to his letter. He figured it would either spark a conversation about their feelings, lead to sex, or at the very least, make Harry a coy and blushing mess around him. Now he was facing an unforeseen forth option where Harry is an apologetic gentleman. Somehow, it was still sexy.
Love wasn’t a competition. Not inherently. But now that Harry has made it a competition, Draco had to win.
With three fingers nearly all the way in himself, he decided it was time. “Harry, are you ready?” He could be rough, he could be wicked, but he had to know that the other was okay.
“Oh yea! You taught a group of teenagers magic that was so advanced, most adults can’t do it.” Hermione remembered, “You’d be an amazing teacher. And you were always good at Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
“You’re probably right. It’s painful to watch.” Harry said with a nod, Dean and Seamus were wrapped in their own little world.
Harry smiled, feeling better. “Thank you Draco, and I’ll still need physical therapy after I get it off, yea?”
“Of course.” He said with a smile and a soft chuckle. “First year, when I met you, you were objectively attractive. You were also a bloody bastard and a pain in the arse. But cute. Years go by and you’re still attractive, yet somehow even more of an annoyance. Then fifth year happened. I guess I sort of enjoyed bickering with you. You made things interesting. You were the bully I could actually stand up to, and beat the shit out of. Even though I never said it, I guess I decided that I secretly liked you. You were fun. A bitch. But fun. Then, sixth year rolled around. The battle happened. I realized over the summer that you weren’t really a bad guy. I still thought you were cute. I think learning the truth made you even more attractive. I got to know you and your personality made it all even better.” He blushed a bit and looked away. “You just ..... I realized that everything about you is beautiful. Your personality, the way you dress, your sense of humor, the way you walk, your subtle grace, your thighs, your hair, your smile, your laugh, your eyes, you drive me wild. And now, I am completely, utterly, truly, madly, deeply, in love with you.”
Upon beginning his career in Wizengamot, Harry never intended on being an important figure. It was only ever his intention to undo Voldemort's influence and to push through much needed progress. He never intended on being the leader that everyone expected and wanted him to be. He's encountered articles about how he should do more, run for Minister, or take over Wizengamot. Conversely, he's also seen articles saying he's too influential and powerful already. Others want him to take an official role of leadership while others think he had too much power as is.
Harry’s noises were soft and desperate. His hips occasionally jerked as electricity rushed down his spine. “Okay! I’m pathetic! I’m absolutely pathetic, Draco.”
“It’s okay. Take your time.” Draco would wait as long as Harry needed and didn't want the other to feel pressured. He was also a bit concerned for the nervous tick, which he had never seen before.
Apparently, things were slowing down in Wizengamot. Now that all the rebels and the Minister had gotten the change they wanted, there wasn’t much to do anymore. Now they mostly worked on criminal cases, which lasted a lot longer than their political discussions, mostly because Harry wasn’t able to shut it down with one small speech. They had to sit and listen to predicaments, hear all sides of the story, look at evidence, and come to a legal decision on the verdict and punishment.
He didn’t want to grow old, he didn’t want death to creep onto him, he chose to die in the war, he chose death. Now he would have to wait.
They got Harry up and Neville started jogging ahead. “I’ll go on and let Pomfrey know what happened.”
Draco wrapped his arm around Harry and the moment Harry felt Draco’s warmth, he struggled not to melt. He wanted to fall into Draco and close his eyes. He could stay there forever. He almost hated how mushy and warm he felt.
“Bollocks! All those evils trying to rob us of our freedom! Just like a cheesy young adult novel. Aren’t I right, Potter?” He seemed to be implying that Harry, as a young person, should understand and agree. In some strange way, Harry was amused by how desperate everyone was. He knew he was still a prominent figure due to the war and his takeover of Wizengamot, but he didn't think he was really that important. The longer he turned the idea over in his mind, the more he understood. He didn't know any of these people. In wizard society, they were nameless and faceless. But Harry, everyone knew him. They were desperate to impress to gain any ounce of friendship, support, and notoriety. It was kind of sad. Part of him didn't understand what they saw in him, but when he looked at things from their perspective, he understood that no matter what he did, they would always idolize him because of his part in the war. Voldemort had the government and the media. If not for Harry, he would have won.
Harry suggested a radio station and they laid back down together, with soft music in the background.
“I usually eat a few bites of everything at each meal.” It added up when considering that Harry was presented with many entrees and side items in the Great Hall.
Lucius raised an eyebrow, seeming amused. “Oh, well that's wonderful news. I wouldn't want you married off to some man who's nothing more than a seething ball of pent-up aggression. You used to bully him and his friends pretty severely, yes?”
The breath was stolen from Draco’s lungs and his eyes widened. He wasn’t afraid, there was nothing left to fear, but he was emptied by how helpless he was. He turned to his mother with a hollow expression and voice. “What has he done?”
“Oh, don’t do that. Don’t act so coy. You’ll only make it worse.” His blue eyes were intense and filled with lust as they caressed Harry’s body with their gaze. “I’d like to spend the rest of my days on my knees before you. You’d let me, wouldn’t you? You’d grant me that blessing.”
The blonde unwrapped the palm-sized gift to find a box containing silver cufflinks with little snake heads on them. He let out a laugh. “Because I’m Slytherin?”
Perhaps he really was less upset about his father being charged with child abuse, and was more pained by the fact that he was finally being made to deal with it. Somewhere inside of himself, he also might have been upset that no one had said anything before. When his father felt like humiliating him, people saw the way he was sometimes treated. People saw and said nothing. People saw and did nothing. For the first time, Draco realized that his life could have gone very differently if someone had just questioned the way Lucius treated him, or if they had questioned his outbursts. Someone could have stopped it. But no one did.
Draco bit his lip and smirked. “Do as you please.” He’ll never admit how charming Harry’s requests for permission were.
“Oh, yes. Sorry. It’s just that it’s been a while since I’ve been around people who knew my parents. Everyone who ever knew them seems to drop like flies.” He let out a nervous chuckle, wanting to punch himself in the face for being so damn awkward. But then again, he was talking to three dead men via a piece of paper, he was far past normal conversation.
“The Dursley’s I guess. Called me a mutt, freak, monster, a dirty rat, anything degrading. I guess at some point I started to believe it since nobody told me any different until I came here.”
Sitting in his usual booth with his friends gave Harry a sense of comfort. He felt like maybe, he would get to Hogwarts and it would be just like old times.
“I shouldn’t be teasing you.” In truth, Harry was angry. He was angry at himself and Draco. He hated how Draco so easily sent him into a momentary panic. For a split second, he wasn’t sure what Draco was going to do, and he hated that most of all. He couldn't stand how he lost himself in the moment. He let out a huff, “It was just a joke, it wasn’t meant to go that far.”
Harry, on the other hand, was shorter and his body was covered in a nice padding of muscle. He didn't have anything very defined, instead, the muscles of his body rolled and curved in ways that were absolutely tantalizing when shirtless. He had a soft strength and endless flesh, vastly different from the sharp and thin beauty of the other man. Although Draco had yet to see Harry's bare upper-half, he knew what to expect given the little peaks he's gotten when Harry stretches or wears white.
The two regularly visited Teddy. They had started going over every Sunday afternoon since they wanted Saturdays to relax by themselves. They wanted to be able to take Teddy out see everything, but we’re hesitant since they knew they’d have to deal with paparazzi. Teddy was walking, running, he was starting to hop, he danced, spoke in broken little sentences, and could sort of feed himself. Harry kept Remus up to date on all of the things Teddy was learning to do. He was still sad that he couldn’t be there, but he’d learned to cope and made the best of his situation.
Harry looked up at Draco, and somehow, he knew that he was ready for this. His nerves were gone and he felt completely certain.
Draco leaned back in his seat and thought a while. "Well, I suppose I know a bit about sneaking around at Hogwarts."
Harry took his hand and rose, “Mine, please.” Part of him couldn’t believe he was about to have sex with someone that he hasn’t even kissed yet. His sexual history was very brief and only stemmed from romantic relationships. He’s never started a relationship with sex before. But somehow, it felt right.
They both silently agreed that they weren’t going to tell anyone about their plot, no need to have everyone doing it. That could ruin the economy. But they might as well take advantage of their creativity.
Harry speculated about his upcoming job as a professor and Draco talked about his unofficial internship with Madam Pomfrey. They talked about grades, classes, finals, their friends, everything.
Draco only shrugged. “That was always the job of the house elves.” He mumbled the sentence, knowing they were a bit of a touchy topic for Harry given his friendship with Dobby.
Draco gulped and took in the sight, he made sure to remember every detail for his future fantasies. Not only was he immensely proud of himself for giving Harry a boner, he was also proud that he was technically the reason for Harry’s orgasm.
Harry crept back into his dorm around two in the morning. He couldn’t wait to flop down on his bed and sleep the day away. But a voice interrupted him.
Draco only tilted his head before they continued to their dorm. Of course, one bed had a green duvet while the other had a red duvet.
When it was time for them to meet up, Hermione was left standing alone in the dark common room. Harry arrived five minutes late, “Sorry, I lost track of time talking to Draco.”
“It was loud. I don’t like loud noises. I can’t stand loud noises. They make me jump and then I’m just, off, I’m afraid, and I can’t just be normal. Why can’t I just be normal?! I’ll get worried for the rest of the day and I just sit around and wait for bad things to happen, all because of some stupid loud noise.” He shook but he didn’t know why. Some violent shiver ran through him and he glared at the ground as he spoke. “Shouting is the worst. It reminds me too much of them. Which I’m actually not scared of them. I think I was only ever afraid of no one believing that they hurt me, because if no one believes that what happened to me was abuse and was wrong, then maybe I wasn’t abused, and maybe I deserved everything that happened to me.”
"Then let me help you." She offered. "I've seen how everything works. The Ministry is centered around the Minister, and I'm his intern. I'm positioned in the dead center of the entire government, even the Minister himself revolves around me. I see how all the parts and pieces work. I can help you."
She nodded. “We’ve exchanged a few letters. She can’t write much, as you know.” Draco understood what she was implying. She couldn’t write much because of his father. “But we’ve met up once. She even-“ Andromeda was cut off by a knock at the door.
There was a moment of pause as the words sunk in. Greenwood understood how important this was and he wasn't going to mess it up. His eyes flickered around his office as if the answer was going to be hung on a wall and he had to stop himself from springing to his feet as he came to an answer. "Give me two hours and I'll have something for you. I'll have to look in the archives but I do remember his name being mentioned in a few Voldemort-era cases that were never investigated." The answer was almost frantic. As if he had received the key to something that would ensure his own safety.
Harry took the silence as a sigh to take it further. “Then I’ll occupy my hands some other way.” He commented as his hand drifted up to toy with the blonde’s nipple.
A groan rolled out of Harry’s throat and he tossed his head to the side. “Oh fuck, you’re perfect, Draco. You’re so bloody perfect.” Somehow, the wooden tip of the wand that pressed to his neck made everything feel even better. His body stretched back and his muscles peaked, quaking through his flesh. He was shaking as he felt his own slow build. He knew he was far behind the man above him, but he found himself indifferent to the end. He only wanted this moment, himself and Draco, alone and vulnerable, pleasured, forever.
“You’re as ball-less as a doll, Potter. You act like you don’t have any desire besides giving. That’s all you do, give. Why not take? Or at least ask? I feel like every time I want to return the favor, I have to convince you.” He paused a moment and after thinking a bit, his voice came out much quieter. “Do you not like when I touch you?”
"Uh." He felt how his face heated up and shrugged, "It's just ..... it's a bit descriptive in one part, where ..... where Claus is ..... touching ..... Sebastian." He covered his face and felt absolutely stupid for the coy way he tried to describe what went on in the book.
The foyer also contained two hallways and a grand staircase to the second floor. The left hallway lead to the sitting room, library, an office, and a covered patio. The right lead to the kitchen, the dining hall, a bathroom, and a small laundry room.
Hermione tilted her head at that and thought a moment. She took the paper back and searched it. "Some kid, who was it anyways?" She mumbled.
His father knew he was there but didn't speak a word to him. He came into the sitting room and saw him, looking sad and distressed. He only raised an eyebrow and left. Draco hated how satisfied Lucius probably was with the whole situation. He likely thought something terrible had happened to Draco and not the other way around. He wanted to lash out yet again, this time as his father, but he didn't. He hated himself when he was mad, he reminded himself too much of his father. He didn't want to be anything like that man.
Conversations slowly started up again, talking about other things. Tests and spells. Normal stuff. It wasn’t that they were pushing aside the conversation, but it was understood that Harry didn’t want to discuss it any further.
Draco shrugged. “Because I didn’t like how I treated you. It wasn’t okay. So, I thought that turning my old bad habits into something positive would be, ..... nice? I don’t know what exactly I thought. I just wanted to take something bad and make it good.”
Hermione was talking to the current Minister for Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt. Of course they had already met being in the Order together. But now Hermione was talking to him about political advice as her ambition was to take over once he stepped down in about a decade or so. He only wanted the position in order to secure the arrests of dark witches and wizards, and to help rebuild what he could. Hermione wanted the position to push for change. Shacklebolt thought she would be an excellent successor, he also advised her to look into previous Ministers and try to learn from their downfalls.
Moony was concerned about his injury, Padfoot was encouraging Harry’s pursuit, and Prongs was concerned about both.
An involuntary groan punched out of Harry when he met the tightness of the blonde. He bit his lip and his eyebrows tensed. He wanted to curl up and arch his back at the same time. All he could do was settle for squirming. He shifted as most of himself slid into Draco.
Harry swallowed. He wanted to speak but he was silenced by the fiery stillness in the woman that sat, patient as a predator, not laying down or hesitating, only in wait. "I wouldn't be surprised if he had something to do with it but I think we both know he's far too pretentious to get his hands dirty. So it was probably his idea, but I don't doubt he knows exactly who it is."
Draco rolled his eyes, sitting on his bed. “Geez. All I did was publicly announce that I like your eyes, so you go and write poetry about how ethereal I am. And lucent! Conquering the beauty of the heavens, I’m a light in these dark halls, a creature of elegance and enchantment, I’m more ethereal than celestial bodies. Come on, Harry! That was poetry! Pure poetry! Nothing casual about that at all.”
Quills sped up, everyone was soaking in every word Harry spoke. There was also a slight confusion in the room. It sounded more like Harry was analyzing Draco rather than defending or berating him. Even Draco looked a bit unsure of how this was going to go.
“Oh, Pansy, you look wonderful! Who’s husband have you come to steal?” Draco asked as he took in the pink frilly dress she wore. It was very similar to the one she wore to the ball during the Triwizard Tournament.
When he entered, Seamus stood to greet him and Draco made his way over to the little table in the corner. He sat down with a soft smile as the scent of coffee beans hit him from the other’s cup. Although he wasn't a huge fan of coffee, he liked the smell and didn't mind kissing the flavor off of a man's lips, as he did to a coy Hufflepuff in year five.
They all insisted she sit with them. Hermione was going to sit on Ron’s lap to make more room, but Dean and Seamus beat her to it. Nobody questioned why Seamus insisted on sitting on Dean’s lap, everyone knew why, and everyone was frustrated by the fact that they still weren’t a couple.
Draco’s jaw dropped and a smile pushed onto his face. “Merlin!” He exclaimed in a mix of shock and joy. “But why me? I’m the least experienced person there.”
Draco made good on his promise to carry Harry’s books around when he was released from the hospital wing. But it didn’t do much good since Draco seemed tired. He was falling asleep in class and at meals.
Draco found himself agreeing. He would hate if Harry felt bad about it because he does believe that Voldemort deserved it, but he would also hate having to encourage Harry to believe killing Voldemort was good.
The next day was a headache for Harry, who had breakfast, took his Potions exam, had lunch, and then had his Herbology exam. Draco’s day had actually been quite lovely. He went to see his mother for lunch, he studied a bit, hung out with his friends, and planned his birthday party a bit more. It was one of the least extravagant ones he’s had in a long time. Just a small get-together at Andromeda’s house.
She went to go tell Shacklebolt their choice of lawyer while Harry sent off a letter to Greenwood, giving him the official position.
He cried and frantically moved his hips, chasing his orgasm. But the ocean finally relented, the wave rushed forward and crashed into him. His back arched and his arms gave out. His face dropped into his pillow and he let out a raw and throaty wail as he came. He shot out just as Draco wanted him to, whimpers mixing with his soft gasps as he succumbed to the aftershocks.
The pen in his hand began to move and he found himself writing about brownies. He decided he would eventually make brownies. Ever since he met Remus, chocolate had become another coping mechanism of his. It was then that he remembered he still had three bars in the fridge.
Harry was about to try and greet Draco, but his three dragons stood before him and growled at Draco. They were the size of Great Danes at only six months old and very strong. Their sharp teeth bared to keep this new person away from Harry, who hissed at them in Parseltongue. “Retreat. He is a friend.”
"This isn't about his jeans, Pansy." He said as he set the roses in the silver vase he bought and carried it into the kitchen along with the table cloth. "Did you see his jacket?"
McGonagall was stunned into silence. It was extremely rare to see something like that. In fact, Harry has no memory of a time where McGonagall has been silenced. Her eyes grew teary and she smiled. “Come here, my boy.” She opened her arms.
Harry and Draco both take steps towards their future careers, they also push Dean and Seamus together.
"I am too." He agreed as he picked up another biscuit, taking a bite. "I don't know what you're talking about when you say these need more cinnamon. I think they're lovely."
He couldn’t help but to ask later. Yesterday they silently agreed not to discuss the letters with each other. But Draco couldn’t help himself.
Perhaps it was the bit of power it gave him, or just the way it flustered his lover. Either way, he loved it.
Just a little touch and his mind, busy from the day’s tolls, derailed. He closed his eyes and there was nothing. All he wanted to do was focus on the sensations of touching Harry. He focused on the way Harry’s robes felt under his fingers, the way his hand felt, the warmth that came from his body, he focused on everything about the man before him. He hoped to commit every detail to memory, just as Harry had done when they danced at the Yule Ball. It was so simple and overwhelming.
Hermione quickly caught on to what Pansy was doing and decided to help out. “I’ll admit, I did consider it a few times. But then I would remember you’re an oblivious idiot and a waking beacon of death.”
After the responses came flooding in, Harry sent off two final letters; one to Gringotts, settling half his titles; and one to Minister Shacklebolt, sending his list of the newest members of Wizengamot.
Unfortunately, Draco only got to see Harry shirtless, which was a sight he had come to know and appreciate. A deep tan, faint muscles, dark curls; it was enough to make the blonde's mind wander.
Harry blinked a few times, knowing Draco was right. “I know. I know I don’t have to be stressed. But I suppose I’m just so used to it that I haven’t gotten comfortable with the idea of relaxing yet. I wish I didn’t have to.”
“Is my father there? Is he with her? Tell him I love him too. Tell him that everyone says I look just like him, but with my mother’s eyes. Tell him about me, tell him everything. Tell him he didn’t die for nothing. Please.” He wiped his eyes as a whimper broke through.
His stomach twisted and his body shook, sadness sank into his bones and he felt his jaw ache. His face felt hot and shamed. His breaths shook, and for one sick moment, he felt like he could breathe again. It was like the sweet breath that filled his lungs before he spilled his guts. He held on to the air and took in his surroundings, his condition, his emotions. He called them each by name and they numbed before him, shrinking into a heavy weight in his stomach.
On the day of the dragons’ first birthdays, Harry had a little birthday party for them. He played with them all day and released some hares for them to hunt down and eat. He also watched them, after months of awkwardly flapping their wings around, finally take flight.
“Now, I should get going. I told your father I would only be gone half an hour and he’s very particular about being on time. See you next month?”
Harry let out a quiet, almost breathless, chuckle. “You’re absolutely stunning. I could marvel at your beauty all day.”
He eventually separated himself from the crowd and sought out McGonagall, who had been standing by and watching with a proud smile.
Draco rolled his eyes, “I’ll do as I please, Harry.” With that, he cleaned his plate and went to get dressed.
Part of Harry wanted to take Draco up on every offer he’s made. But he was a bit nervous since he’s ever done anything like that before.
Harry was still silent. He wiped his eyes and looked at the page expectantly. He hoped to finally know their identities. Most of all, he hoped that they were who he thought they might be.
He let out a shaky, "Fuck." As Draco continued to rub him. He squirmed and whined at the new feeling. "Draco." He mewled. His eyebrows furrowed as a frustration took him over. It felt good enough to make him writhe and whimper, but it wasn't enough to push him to the edge. He needed more. "Draco, you're killing me."
He left the kitchen a moment to trade ABBA for a Christmas record since this was their last chance to enjoy appropriately-timed Christmas music. He also wanted a festive atmosphere for Draco to walk in to. But just before he set the record on, Draco entered through the Floo, making Harry jump. He turned back with a small smile and got the record on. “Merry Christmas.” He greeted.
Draco suddenly stood up, feeling inspired. He went into the bathroom and fixed himself up, running his hands through his hair and fixing his clothes. He smiled at his own reflection before going into the sitting room where Harry was sitting, looking over some parchment that was doubtlessly work-related. Though he didn’t have much of a plan, he confidently strode over and sat beside the man, confused to see relief on the other’s face.
Harry, on the other hand, felt great. He got Draco acquainted with his friends, and they were going to set up two couples. He thought their time together went better than expected.
“Now, beyond houses without heirs, the House of Crouch is in a unique position.” Demgass began flipping through his folder, searching for something specific. “Crouch Jr. took the Dark Mark and relinquished his inheritance, Crouch Sr. never took the Dark Mark and has no other heir, therefore, you’re the heir to the House of Crouch, but not yet the head. You would have to discuss this with Crouch Sr. so he can find another heir, or, if it’s in his best interest, allow you to remain the heir to his house.” He finally found the page he wanted and skimmed towards the bottom. “As it stands, your status as head of twenty-one houses, and heir of the House of Crouch, will be finalized in roughly half an hour.” He looked up at Harry, an inept excitement rested in his eyes, “You’re about to become the richest wizard in history. Though already wealthy, the House of Potter is to become an incredibly prosperous one.”
“Draco there are hundreds of genres of music and thousands of musicians out there. Muggle music doesn’t have a tendency to sound one way or another.”
“Writers block.” His smile dropped in an instant and he looked a mix of serious and upset over his problem.
“Very. There are a few more complex treatments that I haven’t started learning yet because I’m not experienced enough, but soon I’ll be running the entire hospital wing.” His face fell as he was hit with a realization. “Merlin. I’ll be running the hospital wing and you’ll still be at Hogwarts. You’re a walking disaster.”
“I have nightmares. Everyone dies, you die, Hermione, Sirius, McGonagall, my parents, fuck.” He covered his mouth a moment, closing his eyes as his throat closed up and burned from how much he wanted to cry. “Everyone dies. I kill someone. Something goes wrong. I’ve seen Hogwarts burn a thousand times, I’ve died a hundred times, I’ve seen and done things and sometimes I wake up and I can’t remember what really happened.”
Harry shrugged and got a bit coy. "It's what I would always call the people I was with or that I was flirting with. I wanted something more than girlfriend or boyfriend. Those are hardly words of affection, more like titles. I wanted something that I could call them and know I was the only one. Others could call them my boyfriend or girlfriend, but only I could call them lover. It just always felt more intimate to me. So that's what I use."
Harry, meanwhile, dressed in five minutes. He threw on his cheap dark clothes and Sirius’ old leather jacket. He brushed his hair and ran his fingers through it so it returned to it’s messy and wild charm. He cut any parts of his stubble that had gotten too long, and decided he looked good enough. While he was looking in the mirror, he noticed his scar. He spent his whole life with the scar looking red and irritated all the time. But now, it had turned into white raised skin. There were little flecks where it had tapered out and lengthened since the war. To him, it looked a lot more like real lightening now. He figured that with Voldemort dead, his scar was able to heal as much as it was going to. He sort of liked his scar now. It almost marked the end of an era for him. It was older and a bit healed, like him, and he couldn’t ask for anything more. He wouldn’t wish for his scar to heal. It had become strangely precious to him. Of all the bad it may represent, it also had some good, and Harry appreciated both sides of it.
“I’m not working myself to death, I’m getting ahead so I can finish my lesson plans as soon as possible.” He knew he was probably working himself too hard. He knew he was close to getting burned out, but if he hurried up and finished reading, then he could be done before the burnout set in. In his mind, it was a perfect plan.
He opened his mouth as if he was going to formulate a response, but nothing came out. He knew Draco was right. He knew that if he didn’t stop, I’d probably kill him. “I know that I should. I want to. The war is over. I need to rest.” He paused a moment, staring into the distance, zoning out a bit before returning and saying, “Just give me time. Then we can live our lives as coworkers at Hogwarts, hexing each other at Quidditch games, sending love letters, and growing old together.”
“I seriously can. It happens to be a talent of mine. Observe.” He said as he turned to his side and closed his eyes. He curled up slightly, laying in the fetal position.
Harry closed his eyes and smiled through his tears. “I knew it. Oh, I knew it.” He whimpered out his words and started to calm down from his outburst. He was relieved and rapturous to know it was them.
The conversation moved to Harry, who just sat there a moment. “I. I don’t know, honestly, I didn’t expect to live this long.” He bit his lip, “I think I want to teach.”
“Oh, you’ll find a reason. Probably sneaking off to the restricted section, tumbling down the moving staircase, or perhaps someone will hex you. Probably me.”
Out of curiosity, Harry tried to lie but found that he couldn’t. So he told the truth. “Every word of it. I ever hated him and never thought he was a bad person. Somewhere along the line I began to realize how similar we were. I think it was when I was on the run. I had a lot of time to think.”
He smiled softly until he felt a few gentle kisses on the side of his neck. A shiver ran through him and he quickly sat up. “Did you do that on purpose?”
“That sounds wonderful.” Harry bit his lip and silently thought his next words over before finally confessing, “I really think I love you, Draco.”
“I don’t know.” Harry said with a shrug. “I just am. I think it’ll be fun. I can’t wait to give you your present.”
Draco finally thought of enough fucked up things to kill his boner, and with that, they were both drifting back to sleep.
They were silent as Draco examined the rest of him. “You’re lucky. Your only other injury is a bruised rib. It’s minor and it’ll take about three weeks. But you’ll be confined to this bed today, all weekend, and likely Monday. You’ll have to take it easy for a while after that. That means relaxing, Harry. No matter how you feel about it, you have to relax.”
Harry looked up and grinned at the news. “I was thinking we tell Neville that you and Hannah were talking, and she happened to confided in you about her crush. I think Neville only needs a confidence boost.”
“It’s basic psychology.” Hermione said with a shrug. Sometimes, she really couldn’t keep her mouth shut. But in all fairness, Draco did seem to enjoy that Harry had formulated a strategy to charm him.
He continued by saying, “That was ..... beautiful. You were supposed to embarrass him, not seduce him. That was poetic.”
During their silence while Slughorn was teaching, Draco tried to come up with a way to cheer Harry up.
“At the very least, I would like to lose my virginity to someone I’m in a relationship with.” Harry excused, making Draco chuckle.
Harry cried out and his body shook at the rush of pleasure the moan gave him. It sent vibrations through his most sensitive place and he couldn’t handle it. “Fuck! Draco!” He nearly shouted the words.
“Right. Now I have to send it off to Hermione, then it's round two in the Ministry and I have to find a lawyer to sponsor the department.” He mumbled as he set his head down on the table.
He reached over and gently nudged Draco. “Draco, hey, wake up. It’s time to go see Teddy, yea?” He called softly.
Though it was cold, his cheeks were kind of numb, and his nose was suddenly very runny, he enjoyed himself. His first instincts was actually to wipe his nose on the sleeve of his jacket, but when he remembered how expensive it was and that Draco had got it for him, his pulled his wrist away from his face before it even touched. He looked around and saw absolutely no alternative, so he bend one knee and very awkwardly wiped his nose on the kneecap of his jeans. To say he felt like a total idiot would be an understatement. The fact that no one saw him was really the only thing that made it worth it.
Harry decided to enjoy what he could get and he let his hips slowly begin to move at Draco’s pace. He couldn’t deny that Draco was phenomenal at what he does. When Draco saw this he pulled his hand away, making Harry let out a flustered huff. “Git.”
Harry nodded a bit and went back to sifting through parchment. They were sitting around Harry's kitchen table, looking over the final changes and adjustments to the Cupboard Project. It was mostly just Greenwood's legal side of things.
Harry looked surprised to say the least. He tensed up a bit but hugged her back. Something about the hug felt so genuine and caring, as if, somehow, they were family. She thanked him for taking care of Draco and then took her leave.
Harry chuckled to himself, “You’re good at this. Pomfrey might like you so much that she’ll hire you.”
His story moved on and got him excited for what his romance in real life may hold. His lawyer’s walls had been broken down and the photographer introduced him to love and warmth. They were in love and almost together, he just needed something to push them. In the end, he decided that the lawyer would be the one to make the move over dinner. He wrote out the scene and felt strangely satisfied with what he had done. All the tension, unspoken feelings, and pining has finally come to a close. But now he was a bit worried. Many of his novels would end after the two main characters finally got together, but this didn’t feel like it was over. The lawyer was still sponsoring an important bill and the photographer had only two weeks left to finish his portfolio for an important job interview. Their love might have reached an important and long-awaited point, but this story wasn’t over. They still had lives and things to figure out. Should they eventually move in together? How would the lawyer cope when he hasn’t technically come out as liking men? Would their honeymoon phase fade into eternal embers, always warm and dangerous, waiting to be stoked into passionate flames when the mood hits them. It felt as if there was still so much to be done. Maybe his story didn’t need to end.
"That idiot happens to be my friend and it was written by my instructions." He confessed. He wasn't worried about Greenwood knowing this about him. The lawyer was still very much vulnerable and he relied on Harry. If anything, this display of power could prove useful in adding to Greenwood's willingness to do a favor. "I set up the opposition behind a weak man and I did it intentionally. I did it so that now, in such a trying time, I can knock him down. With the opposition leaderless and confused, I convince those of ambiguous morals to swoop in and pull them to my side." He gave Greenwood a friendly smile and added, "
"You aren't unloading your problems, you're letting me in. There's a difference and I'm honored that you would tell me these things." He set his hand atop Harry's without even thinking and saw the corners of Harry's mouth lift slightly. "You were without doubt abused. Emotional and verbal abuse are just as valid as physical."
Draco found himself outside of a quiet cafe in a little corner of Hogsmeade, away from all the hustle and bustle of the major shops and few inns. He was there due to an invitation from Seamus of all people.
Somehow, it wasn’t too hard when Draco had his mind set on riding him. But now that Draco was set on the backside, it was scarier. There was a certain vulnerability to it. A vulnerability that Harry didn’t like.
He asked her about her stance on Pawk’s bill, and just as Hermione predicted, she supported it. He asked her to convince younger members of Luther’s old following to give it a chance and she responding by jokingly asking what was in it for her. Harry knew very well that it was a joke, but he also knew the power of owing someone a favor, so he made it even then and there. He offered her positive press and a role in a very good-looking project: the revamp of Crow's St Mungo's reform. Though it would require a small donation and some work to make the reform fit more modern needs, Pansy accepted.
They spent the afternoon listening to music, till it was time for the Christmas feast. Harry turned off the radio and hid it under his bed.
Narcissa nodded and sniffled again, wiping her eyes. "Yes, of course. You're right. But I mean it Draco, do not leave."
Harry's eyes popped open and he sat up straight, flinching at the almost-immediate pain in his back from how he fell asleep. He stood and took a few steps out, standing by the foot of Draco's bed as he saw Daphne Greengrass with a fresh set of tears streaming down her face.
“Okay.” Draco was significantly more at ease with what he had been told. “Then who have you actually considered being with?”
He didn’t necessarily picture marrying a woman and having children. He was also quite interested in men, though he’s never dated one. He’d even come to the conclusion that he might as well try, just to see what it was like. In fact, he’d met a werewolf in Wizengamot who was only two years older than him that he was quite interested in.
“Harry, you slut! What have I done to you?!” Draco exclaimed, intentionally overdramatic. “You wank one time and now you’re addicted.” He huffed.
He appeared in a familiar sitting room and took his place on the couch. Harry was sitting on the other side of it, looking down at some papers and taking notes on it. Part of Draco wanted to ask about what he was doing, another part wanted to ask about why he woke up in his bed and not the couch. Instead, he didn't speak a word. He sat there and took in the atmosphere of the room, looking around at every little detail. The furniture was a mix of deep and pastel colors. It all complimented each other surprisingly well. Tall windows with white curtains lit up the room with natural light. The pale blue walls looked like some clear and bright sky. Though it had its dark and deep shades, the room was quite happy. It had been decorated so carefully, it's appearance was entirely intentional. It was meant to relax and soothe its occupants.
Hermione and Pansy were right on it. Pansy recognized that Harry and Draco were talking about what they liked about each other, therefore, Dean and Seamus must be doing the same thing. Hermione, who Pansy revealed all the details of her work to get Harry and Draco together, also came to the same conclusion. Luna was also slowly reaching the same conclusion, even though she didn’t know what Hermione and Pansy did.
When he returned, he was careful to hide what he had gotten in his robes. He hid it under his bed and then went out to meet the rest of his friends in the Great Hall as he accidentally stayed out too long and was late. But in his defense, he was out making very important decisions.
Hermione nodded and decided to make an attempt at changing the subject. She's noticed that Harry only ever wanted to talk about work or her life. He never spoke about himself. So she decided to check in on him. "And how have you been? Anything new, that isn't work related."
What are Harry’s plans for the future? To become the next Defense Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts.
Draco raised an eyebrow and grinned. “Oh you’ll see me alright. Hope the view is nice when I knock you on your arse in Quidditch. And don’t even get me started on potions! You got lucky in Year 5, but this time you’re going down.”
Hermione, though silent and only an intern, had a very unique position in Wizengamot and overheard many useful bits of information. Harry and Pawk considered themselves lucky to have her on their team.
“No matter what you end up doing, know I still expect an heir. But surrogacy or not, make sure the mother is of good blood. I believe one of the Abbot girls is open to working in surrogacy for couples who can’t produce, I’m certain she’ll take you on. A few Greengrass girls are in the business too.”
Harry understood. “I know, Neville. I’ve known since the moment I met you that you were like me. But I guess I never said anything because I knew we were both afraid of what would happen if other people found out.”
Draco beamed at the praise he received. “I’ll always be a pain in your arse, Potter.” He smirked down at the boy. “Or I could be quite pleasurable.”
They ended up buying Teddy a few clothes he could wear now, and a few others that he could wear in his future. They were essentially building Teddy a wardrobe for the next five years of his life. They left with three bags of outfits for Teddy, four new toys, and two lidded cups for toddlers.
His satisfied expression fell when he remembered tomorrow was the day of the big Yule Ball at the Ministry. He knew for a fact that Draco wouldn't have forgotten that. Of course, Harry had no problem with Draco flirting with him in public. The more he thought about it, the more amusing it became. He smiled to himself and pulled out his parchment, working again.
While the other family names were accompanied by a family portrait or crest, Potter was accompanied by a picture of Harry laughing. It was obvious he didn’t know he was being photographed.
Harry was strangely pleased by Draco’s offer. “Mind peeling and dicing the tomatoes for the sauce? If you run it under warm water for a bit the skin will come right off.”
Ron stared at them a moment before slowly catching on. “If you want to try it, I won’t stop you.” He said to Harry. He didn’t want to outright encourage it, but he understood why they wanted him to do it.
He didn’t even know he was crying until there was a wet spot on the collar of his shirt from where his tears had rolled down his face and neck. He wiped himself off and took in a shaky breath. He didn’t even have to think about his decision. He already knew what he would choose.
Harry turned the water on and climbed in. For the first time in a year, he didn’t immediately start scrubbing. He turned around and let the warm water wash over him. He spent a few minutes relishing in the warmth before he actually began to clean himself up. It felt so nice to be able to take his time. He washed himself and let his hands roam, no harsh scrubbing to hurry and get the job done. After only two minutes he became painfully aware that if he didn’t stop he was going to turn himself on, but he didn’t care. He treated himself to delicate hands and sweet touches. He hadn’t had such privacy in years.
The nails that dug into him soften to fingertips. He wasn’t dug in to, he wasn’t gripped, he was held. His arm slowly crumpled under him and he laid on Draco’s chest, hardly able to hold himself up. He let out a series of grunts. They were strangely soft and desperate, almost hums. He chanted out the noise as he got closer and closer, incapable of words.
Remus paled. He was already a bit hurt by Harry’s heartfelt message to James and Lily. But he didn’t except he would have a turn.
Since he was already in the bathroom, he went ahead and brushed his hair and teeth. He took a deep breath and didn't want to put on clothes just yet, but he knew he needed to. He went into his room and picked out his clothes. He took his pajama shirt off and pulled on a grey shirt. Black pants and shoes followed, before pulling Sirius' old leather jacket on that he had acquired when he was first given hold of the Black property. It still smelled like his late godfather and he hated how he enjoyed that. It was almost embarrassing, but he had once put a charm on it to it kept his scent. It comforted him in some sad way. Though he would like to put on the coat Draco got him, it was much too warm for that.
“Oh? So you’re naturally so pathetic? So virginal and righteous that you can’t handle how it feels to cum? You should have seen yourself. Shaking and trembling, your hips were moving so fast, you were like a rabbit in heat. So innocent, but you wanted it so bad. Absolutely pathetic.”
“Bollocks!” He cursed as his eyes suddenly popped open, disappointment running through his veins. It was then that he remembered the Malfoy summer home in Venice. He should have taken Harry there, as he remembered it only had one bed.
Since his life had nearly fallen apart before his very eyes for a second time, Harry had turned to some strange coping habits. Although the Weasleys were used to seeing him sitting outside, taking in the warm sun and enjoying nature, they weren’t used to the barrage of food presented to them. Of all things, Harry had turned to cooking. Since he began doing it for himself and for the people he loves, he found that he actually enjoys it. They spent the next two days being sent hordes of food.
Harry was done fighting. He had given everything, even his own life, to the war. Now, he wanted to repair things. He wanted to see things get better. He wanted simplicity. Amidst his writing, he came to realize that this was his second chance at life.
Harry wasn’t sure what fluttered first, his heart or his dick, but both responded to the profound statement from Draco. “I love you.” Harry said once again. He needed to hear it back.
Harry moved into his house in Hogsmeade and began wondering what he was meant to do with his life. Should he date and find someone to marry, was he to get a job or live off his wealth like his father? Harry liked the idea of working, but he didn’t know where to start. He didn’t want to work in the Ministry, that was certain, but he still wanted to make a difference.
“Wonderful. We’ve got a flat together and we’re working in the Department of Magical Sports and Games. We’re trying to revamp all the merch, and Dean wants to be an official referee for the Quidditch World Cup.” Seamus explained with a grin, sounding proud of Dean.
Draco licked his lips. “You can do anything you want to me, Harry. But remember, this isn’t my first time, far from it. I‘ve learned self-control. So don’t be surprised when I’m not nearly as bad as you.”
“Yes. I really like him. He makes me so happy, he’s a sweetheart, stubborn as a mule, beautiful, a sarcastic bitch, goes out of his way to make me laugh, and he loves Teddy.”
Despite their distinguished careers, Hermione and Ron were the next to get married. After a few months of Hermione getting on as Minister for Magic, Ron was given his first extended vacation. Auror missions can last months as a time, so agents are often given a few weeks off between jobs. His latest had lasted nearly half a year and he was given three months off to compensate. They took that time to finally get married.
The word caught them both a bit off-guard. Draco didn't even realize he had said it until he heard the word in the air.
Of course, there were plenty of lame tropes and stereotypes that made him roll his eyes, but it was an otherwise excellent book. Then again, he’s read it five times now. He’s read most of his books multiple times. Although they were good, he was nervous about eventually getting tired of them.
Teddy was in the sitting room, waiting with Andromeda. He was dressed in a onesie with candy canes and snowmen all over it. He was absolutely precious.
Narcissa let out a laugh, “You, going into medicine? Of course you would! You always did enjoy it. I’m not surprised someone recognized your talent for it.”
Harry caved inward and crawled into Draco’s arms, mumbling, “I don’t like sad things. It’s really good, but sad.”
Draco expertly posed himself, throwing an arm over his face and turning his thighs out to show himself off. He knew what he was doing, Harry knew it too.
Draco wanted to make things better, but he hardly knew how. "This isn't something you can bounce back from with a few months of self-care. I know you've been trying, and I think that's wonderful, but you can't fix everything. That just isn't realistic. Some things might go away today, others in ten years, some things are here to stay, but it will get easier. You spent years in that house, it'll take time." He thought a moment and tried to make a suggestion. "Would you like to drink wine and eat chocolate?"
Instead, he said, “Only if you do something about that stupid beard. You look like an ill-bred brute.” But they both knew what Draco really meant. Truthfully, Draco was getting to the point where Harry looked so damn sexy that he’ll probably snap and tackle him.
Beyond staring at Draco and worrying, he didn't have much to do. He ended up talking to Astoria and Daphne for a while. He made sure they were alright and asked about how Astoria was feeling. She said she was fine, but he could tell that she was saddened by something.
"No, dead on." Draco corrected as he tried to stop a grin from forming on his face. He honestly didn't expect Harry to remember something that he only mentioned once, but he did. Just like how he remembered the Christmas music and went out to buy a muggle device that would play him all the music he wanted. Once again, he was reminded of how much he liked the man beside him. Harry made him smile, he made him feel loved, he felt wanted and appreciated, he forgot to call himself an acquired taste and thought himself attractive, he felt flirty, he was confident, he wasn't worried about anything and lived in a bubble where nothing else existed beyond whatever room he and Harry found themselves in. He was living in a bubble and it wasn't suffocating like his old life. It was warm, safe, and he didn't want it to pop. It was then that he realized he felt at home. Harry's house wasn't Draco's home, instead, he was hit with the harrowing reality that Harry himself was home. Draco didn't know how to deal with that, he couldn't handle that in the slightest. He was being hit with deeper feelings than he had ever felt before and he didn't know what to do anymore.
Luna gave a soft smile. “I think your children would be lovely. Just as strong as Hermione, and as clever as you, Ron. The world wouldn’t stand a chance.”
Harry let a grin slip onto his face before he took a deep breath and gave his instructions. The way emotions flickered on and off of his face so quickly was yet another little tactic of his. It was unnerving in ways people could never quite pinpoint or explain. "I was only wondering if there was something in Luther's past that might be a bit, controversial. Something my friend in the press could use to knock him down."
“Oh, no. You aren’t allowed near my neck again. Not with that mouth. That thing isn’t allowed below my face.”
Spending every second of every day together would get boring and vanilla. Having their own hobbies and lives that didn’t revolve around one another gave them things to talk about, and it made seeing the other after a long day even more sweet. But of course, spending a day together every once and a while wasn’t bad either.
“Oh.” He realized he never told Harry his characters names. “The lawyer is Amell Adler and the photographer is Othello Hamel.”
Harry shrugged, “Someone wrote a bit about the afterlife, or whatever.” He paused a moment, “It was exactly what happened to me when I died.”
As everyone left, Pawk, Hermione, and a few others were going to go out for drinks, but Harry declined, saying that there was something he had to do and it couldn't wait.
“The Shrieking Shack back at Hogwarts. They left a few things behind, there. I figured the jacket would be a good start. I wouldn’t want to dump a bunch of memorabilia onto a toddler. I think Remus would have wanted him to have it.” Harry’s voice started out engaged, but it slowly turned dull and flat as he spoke. Even though he was still able to talk to Remus, he still missed him. He’d never be able to hear his voice or hug him again. The sight of Remus’ dead body was burned into his mind. It still hurt.
“I kissed you a few times and that was enough to make you beg for more. It’s hard enough to deny you.”
They both knew what was going on. They could tell how the other felt but neither did anything about it, not until the new guy came along.
Harry clutched the necklace tighter and pressed his forehead to Draco’s chest. “Yes. Just stay with me for a while.”
He'd tried to pick up hobbies before, but they never lasted. He'd learned origami and it took him two weeks to realize he didn't have the patience to stick to it. Dancing was fun but it gets boring on his own. He knew how to sew, but he didn't exactly enjoy it.
Because of it, Teddy called James and Sirius his uncles, and spoke of Lily as if she were his aunt. He also called Andromeda and Narcissa his nans, seeing them both as grandmothers. But then, there was Harry and Draco. He knew Harry was his godfather, so he saw no problem referring to Harry as his father, as well as Remus. Even Remus understood and took no offense to it. Since Draco was Harry’s husband, Teddy also thought it made sense that he should refer to Draco as his father too. Remus was his father, Harry was his dad, and Draco was his pére. Of course it was Draco’s idea that Teddy call him father in French. With Draco and Harry being his unofficial fathers, it only made sense to him that Scorpius should be his brother.
Harry sighed. “Fine. I guess I saw how ..... muscular ..... they are. I don’t know. They were just bulging out of your pants and I dropped everything and I couldn’t stop staring. I don’t. I don’t know, Draco. I just like them.”
Harry somehow felt guilty, wishing he was smaller and easier for Draco. “Sorry.” He whispered. That was all he could do to hold back the satisfaction in his voice. The warm and wet grip around him made him want to call out and writhe, but he didn’t. He only wanted to show his love for Draco. Though he tried to stay strong and solid, he couldn’t stop the trembling in his thighs.
He started to wonder about Harry’s interactions with others, so he could try to identify who hurt Harry.
Somehow, Harry had never been so domineering. Draco was almost intimidated by it. Even from the bottom, Harry had never been so in control.
"I've slept with around six Hufflepuff boys, which was really most of their Quidditch team and a few others. I also started on the Ravenclaw team, but I only ever got two."
The contact came as a bit of a shock to Harry, as did the look Draco gave him, but some reason, he liked it. He really liked it. He liked it more than he wanted to. Although Harry had been a bit oblivious in the past, it was easy to not notice his surroundings when he was constantly wondering when the next slight on his life would take place. But now, he was aware. He was so painfully aware. He knew exactly what Draco was doing and he knew it was being done on purpose.
She gave a sad smile. "Harry isn't happy about it either. The older members of the Ministry, the ones more likely to agree with Voldemort, this was their idea. I think the younger members saw this as something they could agree on; it wasn't worth fighting. I tried to tell them I had spare shacks you could live in, but they wouldn't listen. I think it's a petty form of revenge from the older ones. A way of embarrassing you both."
“Harry, we don’t have to do this if you don’t want to. It’s okay.” He wanted Harry to be comfortable with everything they did.
No one was sure who started it, or when exactly it happened. But at one point there was a wave of Slytherin students from the dungeon, mostly upperclassmen, who rushed into battle. Of course, the Death Eaters thought they were there to assist them, but it was quite the opposite.
"I'm Harry." He said it as if he had just discovered his own name. As if he had spent his entire life only as monikers, and now, he was finally himself. The Golden Boy, and The Boy Who Lived really were dead and gone. Harry was all that remained. He was an amalgamation of all the broken pieces, trying to squeeze back together and take shape. He was a mess and he couldn't've been happier. He was only Harry, and he was more himself than he had ever been.
"He really isn't worth the effort." He decided to make himself useful and looked around at a few other piles of scrolls and papers. "I don't really feel like dealing with him. I think I'll just have someone newer dig up something from his past to shut up him."
Draco’s jaw dropped from such treatment. No lover had ever dared to treat him as anything less than a prince due to his old reputation. But now, someone was rough with him, someone put up a fight, and he loved every bit of it. “Fuck.” Was all he could say in return. Everything felt so much hotter and a hand reached down to undo his own pants. His legs frantically moved to kick them down and into the floor before he returned to his desperate rutting.
Harry rolled his eyes and settled in Draco’s arms. “Of course we’re dating. You lot have been waiting months for it and I’ve loved Draco since Christmas. Hell, it feels like we’ve been dating for months instead of two weeks. This was bound to happen.”
“You two already spend a good amount of time together. Though I’m sure it means a lot to the both of you, I don’t think quality time is Harry’s love language either.” Hermione pointed out before addressing the other two remaining languages. “If I had to guess, I would say it’s touch
Dean shrugged, “I don’t know. I guess I never thought it was important, and it never really came up before.” He paused a moment, going back to Seamus’s previous question, “I think I’d like a nice lad. Shorter than me, sandy hair, blueish-green eyes. I like short hair too, but not too short. I also like a few freckles and a little cleft chin, adorable. Actually, I really like freckles. They’re so cute. I think I have a thing for Irish accents too.” Like Seamus, he was a bit worried that he was being too obvious.
Harry was chided by the sight of Draco crawling onto the bed and muttering a spell that made one of his hands slippery and wet with some mysterious clear liquid. It took him only a second to realize it was some kind of lubricant.
“I’m literally richer than you. My family’s vault has been collecting interest for centuries, we’ve always been a bit frugal, and we kept inventing potions. I’m loaded.”
Draco felt pretty proud of himself, and he was still a bit giddy that Harry was officially his Valentine and got him flowers.
Both women moved to protest, but Harry cut in. “‘S fine.” He mumbled as he stood up. “Just, send word if anything changes.” He stepped towards Draco and kissed his forehead. “Please wake up.” The words came as a whisper when he meant to speak them in a stronger voice. He turned back to the Auror and gave a somewhat awkward expression. “Don’t you need to cuff me, or something?”
Harry, however, had quite a busy day. He spent it running around, trying to make everything perfect for Draco’s birthday. He spent his morning in the library, researching flowers to try to come up with the perfect bouquet. He found himself going off of appearance, until he realized that many flowers have particular meanings associated with them. Then he found himself with an obscure list of pretty flowers with romantic meanings, before he realized that Draco probably doesn’t know or care anything about the flowers’ meanings. Now he had two feet of parchment and three hours down the drain.
He stood in the shower for a while, just staring at the floor. He was deep in thought about what he was about to do. He was filled with anxiety, excitement, doubt, and determination. He wasn’t sure of himself, but he knew exactly what he wanted to do. No amount of second-guessing would make him change his mind. He’d made his decision and there was no going back. He’s come too far to let doubt control him.
He also wasn't blind. He saw the way the elite tried to manipulate and bribe newer members into joining their side. He also saw the way they panicked at the changes in the political climate. All these newer people no longer tolerated bribery over morals. They couldn't be swayed and the elite didn't know what to do anymore. They were afraid because they knew they were losing. This would become an important battle to them and they'll be desperate for a win, which is why Harry can't afford to play nice, not this time. He had his morals and his rules, there were lines he wouldn't cross, but right now, he was prepared for a fight.
“Three times. But don’t tell anyone. Especially not Potter, that git’ll never let me live that down.”
Harry’s jaw dropped. He stared at Draco for a moment, frozen. The air was knocked from his lungs and no words came from his parted lips. He eventually broke through his bout of speechlessness. “I can’t believe you just said that.” His voice was softer, hollow. He couldn’t even begin to formulate a response beyond that. He didn’t know what to say, let alone how to process his own emotions. It was like being hit with cold water. There was only shock, and just a hint of betrayal.
With her taken care of, he only had to worry about his final two names, Gaius and Cassiopeia Searcy. He stepped out onto the streets and an owl flew down to him with a letter. He took it and saw it was from Pawk. She wrote about how she’d already finished off half her list. He sent off a reply saying he only needed to convince the Searcys.
Dean crossed his arms and rolled his eyes. “At least I didn’t get too excited and spontaneously combust.” He mumbled.
Sure enough, the woman had an unpleasant look on her face and she was slowly turning her head and wrists, as if slowly struggling against something.
Harry blinked a few times and put the letter down. He was clearly flustered. He found the poem quite flattering. He didn’t think his eyes were that significant. He'd received a few complements on them but they were mostly comparing his eyes to his mother's. He found himself with a small smile and a light blush, staring down at the table. The poem obviously worked. He couldn’t believe what was happening, Draco wanted to flirt with him, competitively.
Draco was having the time of his life. A smile spread across his face as his moans slipped out. He set a hand on Harry’s lower stomach to help brace himself as he went faster. His legs were shaking but were still steady enough to support himself. He arched his back as he was slightly overwhelmed by pleasure. His moans grew louder and he stopped for a moment to grind down onto Harry, almost trying to take the boy in even deeper. He was also searching for the place inside of himself that he knew would make him scream.
“Ten?!” Draco exclaimed with a dropped jaw. “I could have touched you ten times this week. Why didn’t you ask, or say something?”
A few paparazzi saw them. Harry straight up offered to give them five minutes to talk to them if they promised to leave him alone after that. They agreed.
Pansy let out a laugh tilted her head. “It seems as though you two are getting along. Think you’ll ever be friends?”
Draco was regularly studying plants with Neville and brewing potions for the hospital wing. This also caused him to get close to Professor’s Sprout and Slughorn. Madam Pomfrey let him handle minor illnesses all by himself, everything from diagnosis to caring for the patients. He spent his weekends running around the hospital wing, assisting Pomfrey and caring for patients. Word got around that Draco was helping out in there and suddenly everyone was referring to him as “Nurse Malfoy”. He didn’t mind it, he actually seemed to like it. Pomfrey had also started throwing out comments about how she was getting old, though she was only in her mid-sixties, and that she needed someone she could trust to take over when she’s gone. She made these comments to both Draco and McGonagall.
Everyone looked momentarily sad at the mention of Dumbledore’s death. Especially Draco, seeing as he was the one who was meant to kill him. Even though he only ever disarmed Dumbledore, Draco had genuinely planned on killing him. There was a silence amongst them as everyone was a bit brought down. Everyone except Harry.
Narcissa finally divorced Lucius. She’d also gotten him into a bit of trouble. He’d been tried for his crimes as a dark wizard, but his blackmailing, slander, and threats had gone unchecked. She sent an anonymous letter to Wizengamot, detailing and giving evidence of all the smaller crimes Lucius had gotten away with. It was enough to have him convicted once more. With him away, she filed for divorced, and became a free woman.
For Dean and Seamus, he bought them a big book that was filled with just about every Muggle sport on earth. He figured they would love that given what they were trying to do.
“You are, you’ve celebrated Christmas a certain way every year. I don’t mind if it’s radically different from what I’m used to. We can compromise.”
"Yes, but they think they're geniuses." He remarked with a small smile, referencing their earlier topic.
Draco scoffed. “Why is everyone so concerned with how I treat Harry? Why not question how he treats me?”
“I suppose you’re good at making me desperate.” He knew that appealing to Draco would be the only way for him to finally get off.
"Oh, understandable. I'm like a fine wine, you know, I really am an acquired taste." He'd gotten into the habit of using his old superiority as a joke around Harry. Since it pleased Harry, he's started using it around other friends.
Draco let out a grunt and commented, “The Black family are a bunch of over-dramatic sluts. Everyone’s related to them.”
So there he lay to bask and burn under rose oil and lemongrass, with the sun draping him in something fiery white. His body uncurled to stretch across the bed. He let his eyes close and he took in a deep breath. The peace that came before death sheltered him and he hadn't felt this way since he laid on the forest floor. Maybe if it had been this warm, he never would have risen. He didn't want to rise if the sun couldn't follow.
“That isn’t real, Draco. It isn’t and you know it.” He reached up and grabbed his necklace, sending a warmth through the blonde. “But this, this is real. We’re real. Not some stupid marriage contract. I want us to be real and I hate that I can’t manage that right now.”
“You should see Harry. He’s the most coy little bastard I’ve met in my life. Watch this.” Draco said before turning to Harry. “I love you.”
Their hearts were filled with admiration and attraction towards the other. They each liked the other more than they cared to admit. But neither of them said anything.
Pansy is quick-witted and stubborn, but seeing her own family makes her sick. She grew up with monsters and she was finally realizing it. Their ideology killed good people. She’ll never forgive that.
They then handed over their silver to the bank to be minted into Sickles and then exchanged for Galleons.
Harry didn’t say anything at first, contemplating about how to proceed with such a confession. He might as well be honest since he’s been this open. No point in going back on it now. But he knew he should probably stop being so telling to strangers.
Harry rolled his eyes, “There’s a proper way to cuddle? Seriously? I might not know much about physical intimacy, but I’m fairly certain there are no rules or proper techniques.”
In their relationship, they’d each been so shy to show much affection. They hugged, kissed, cuddled, fooled around, but there was a fragility to it. As if one wrong move could topple over their entire reality. Their worlds had been crushed before and now that everything was okay, the thought of it happening again was terrifying. But Harry was way beyond that. All he wanted was to have his lover. He wanted to fling himself into love and melt in it. He wanted to drown.
Harry perked up at the knowledge, excited that he was right, but now he was curious about who exactly he was talking to. “Are you talking to me from the other side?” He wasn't exactly sure what to call it and 'the other side' seemed appropriate for how strange it was.
Hermione smiled, “Oh it’s beautiful! Your mother would have loved it, silver would have gone great with her hair.” She complemented.
Draco only gave a shrug. "To watch you squirm. Stop you from fighting back so I can tease you, uninterrupted, for as long as you can take. You'd cum begging."
A horrible thought passed over him as he stared down at the still body, only moved by soft breaths. Had he ever told Draco that he loved him?
“Yea. Her and Hermione are roommates, so I imagine she heard about the pining from Hermione and wants to help.” Harry had also been surprised that Pansy wanted to help out. Maybe it was because of how Draco changed, but part of him hoped that if he gave Pansy a chance, she’d prove to be better than she was.
Arachne Chutz, the landlady, invited him to see her properties next weekend and he quickly wrote out a letter accepting the offer.
He was mewling for his orgasm as he felt the pleasure in his hips reaching out for it. When he finally grasped it a low groan was all he could manage. His hips jerked and his thighs shook. He writhed and gasped as relief flooded his body. Soft noises left him, curses, gasps, whines, whimpers, and unfortunately, Harry’s name.
“If we’re lucky, they’ll be nothing like us. But if we’re even luckier, they’ll be just like us.” A smile crept onto Hermione’s face as she answered.
“Oh, great.” She said as she stood up, getting off Ron’s lap. They had been studying potions together, but she recognized the excitement in Harry’s voice and knew he wouldn’t be quelled until she heard him out.
Draco laughed, "Yes! That'll be perfect! Oh, it could be a trilogy and he could move on to the coast and date a fisherman."
Harry closed his eyes and no one said anything else. They let him have a moment to process it before Arthur finished up the article.
Draco let out a laugh at Harry’s expression. “Yes. Harry, I don’t think anyone is completely pureblood. It’s more of an idea than a literal thing.”
“Oh please, he’s a baby. Babies don’t know what lying is, so he could never say such a thing about me.”
Draco sighed and thought the question over. “Oh, I don’t know. I just feel as if a happily ever after wouldn’t make the story feel complete.”
The next year, in the summer after Teddy’s fourth birthday and after years of conversation and thought, Draco had his heir.
His own breaths picked up and tears pricked his eyes. He held Draco’s hand and looked down in regret.
Dancing isn't sexual, he shouldn't be thinking these things. But he was. His throat was suddenly dry and he was hit with the sudden fear that his palms might be sweaty. Was his hand shaking? It was all almost overwhelming. His eyes rested on the floor, too nervous to actually look the blonde in his eyes. He couldn't believe how close Draco's chest was. If he wanted, he could so easily rest his head there, or perhaps, on Draco's shoulder. It was so intimate and close. Now, at the worst time possible, he kind of had to pee. But he didn't want to leave. Draco's closeness aroused him, it made him feel warmer, everything felt so right and good.
“I don’t like shouting, and he shouted. It was a spell I had never heard of before, but through the crowd, I saw the skull mask. I saw it and I knew that it was him. I knew what he was going to do so I ran to Draco and I tried to yell for him to duck, I tried to tackle him, I just had to get him out of the way of the spell.” He bit his lip and another shiver ran through him. “I was too late.” His voice wavered and his emotions finally broke through. He was trying so hard not to start crying again. “He was hit and fell down. I think he was out before he ever touched the ground.”
Finally. Draco could finally see Harry completely nude. He slipped off the boxers and a grin spread over his face at what he saw. It was easily about 20 centimeters long and fairly thick. There were a few visible veins and the tip was cherry red. Draco wasn’t sure how, but it was actually kind of cute. It was a few centimeters longer than his own, less veiny, and his own tip was pinkish-brown. But Draco wasn’t insecure in the slightest. He’s learned to appreciate a wide variety of dick.
Draco blinked a few times to try and get rid of how surprised he had been by Harry’s appearance. He opened his arms. “Come here, let me show you how to properly hold someone.”
Draco went to go get some supplies while Harry turned to his friends. “You guys can go, don’t want to be late for class. I’ll be fine. I get thirty Galleons out of it. I’d say it’s worth it.”
His eyes widened. “Last night wasn’t getting me back for teasing you?!” This was news to him. He genuinely believe he was off the hook.
After taking a moment to think about it, Harry finally spoke a number. “Ten.” Only a month ago Harry hardly ever wanked, hardly ever got turned on, but now that he had a taste, he was addicted. Touching Draco, being touched by Draco, that’s all he wanted.
Rather than having Slytherins on one side of the room and Gryffindors on the other, they were intermingled for the first time. It was something that had done on their own.
Sleep was another issue. He laid in his bed and found that sleep wouldn't come to him. For as exhausted as he was, laying there for a solid hour brought him no rest. Rather, he only felt more awake as he bathed in his own frustrations.
Harry let out a laugh, “Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” He mocked, pitching his voice up two octaves just to pick on Draco.
It wasn’t a shop Harry had ever heard of, but Draco insisted it’s where they needed to go. According to him, it was the only place in Hogsmeade where they could get all their shopping done. He explained it as a shop that sold everything one would need for each season, and their Christmas stock was going on sale.
They arrived and Draco immediately flopped on the bed while Harry unpacked. He was about halfway through his trunk when Draco spoke up.
Then on to all the trauma and heartbreak of his years at Hogwarts. It was insane to think his own dad nearly died so many times. Was hunted like an animal, manipulated and hurt. He read about the war and Harry’s pivotal role in it. How he really did die for a while, but came back stronger. How he battled it out with Voldemort himself, and stopped him. The explosions, cries at the final breaths of children and adults alike, the bodies, the flame, the smoke and ash, and it was only sixteen years ago. There was still a bit of rubble and a few injured spots on the grounds of Hogwarts. But it was easy to feel unattached to what happened. It was as if he finally realized he was living on a battlefield.
The sunset clause made the contract null after a certain event or amount of time had passed. Purebloods typically set it as the birth of an heir or the passage of ten years, as those events were considered signs that the marriage would last. Harry was even willing to bet the contract between Narcissa and Lucius was void by now.
Harry didn’t like how easy it was to get him to feel enough hate to end a life. He’s healed so much from the war that he had forgotten all about his childhood. All the terrible things he went through. He pushed it to the side, assuming he was just over it and grown past it. But now he knew he wasn’t.
They had met up for tea in a little restaurant that they’d been going to with their families since they were children. It was casual and familiar. They both found a strange comfort in the place. They both knew they’d never come here again with their parents as things had changed within both of their families, but they hoped to make memories and turn the restaurant into their own space.
After class, Harry and Draco snuck off and switched jumpers and ties, the both of them mumbling about how funny it was.
His case has only been going on a few days, and every ounce of evidence was against him and nobody was called in to support him besides his mother.
The wedding happened in his second year as a teacher, during spring break, in a garden. The floral setting was Draco’s idea. It was small, friends and family only. Teddy was the ring bearer, and Bill and Fleur’s daughter Victorie was the flower girl. The map was kept near Harry at all times. Along with his nerves, he also felt a certain sureness. Like he knew for a fact that he was doing the right thing.
Draco nodded and let James in. “Neither of us can sleep, thankfully tomorrow is Saturday. Go on and talk to him. I think he’d like to see you.”
Harry was waiting there with Molly and Ron Weasley. The two seemed a bit sad, but Harry mostly looked surprised by their sudden appearance.
Those lips sank to his jaw and he felt a growing anticipation, hoping they would move lower. Though he's never experienced a mouth on his neck, he‘s done it to other people, and found himself eager to know what it feels like. In truth, nothing could have prepared him for the sweet shock of pleasure that made his back push into a soft arch. The feeling ran straight between his legs and he was almost at a loss. He didn't even realize he was holding back a noise until he almost let it out.
That was the exact opposite of how Draco thought Harry was going to continue the conversation. “Wait, what?”
Harry blushed lightly. Of course he’s had conversations with Ron about what they like in a partner, but he could tell those conversations weren’t as detailed and open as the ones between Draco and Pansy.
Harry recognized him as the anonymous source behind an article published a few weeks ago, dragging Hermione for being friends with Crow.
A week into their relationship and Harry hadn't spoken to the Marauders or told them he finally got with Draco.
“Oh, I’m not?” He gave Draco’s hair a light tug. He couldn’t resist the thought of doing something that would bring Draco pleasure. It wasn’t about topping. It was about making Draco groan, and also pissing him off a bit. That’s always fun too.
Harry smiled. So that was it. Greenwood was afraid of him. For reasons both unknown and unappealing, Harry enjoyed it. It was his first real taste at power and he wanted to relish it just a moment longer. "Given that I set you up with Pawk's bill, I assume you know I support her very much. But there's been a man giving us both a bit of trouble: Louis Luther. Heard of him?"
“I am. I wrote all those love letters, flowers, blowjobs, I hold you at night, I make your bed, damn.” He spoke as if he had just realized how amazing he was. “I’m bloody perfect.” Of course he wasn’t serious.
Something about it scared him. He was afraid he would mess it up. He felt like a big responsibility was being put on him, but he also felt so loved.
They watched as the blonde began letting out a few soft whines. The noises weren't particularly pained or fearful, but it seemed as if there was something he wanted.
One thing Harry learned very quickly was the art of crying silently. He couldn't afford to be loud as a child. It made Draco wonder how long Harry had been crying for.
Maybe Harry could have both. His warmth and his old safety. Sunbeams used Draco's hair as a ballroom but the moon was always in his eyes. It was everything he wanted.
Draco blushed. It was the first time Harry said he loved Draco during sex. “I love you too.” He moaned in response. He felt a fire spreading in his stomach, hot and white. He knew he was only moments from the end and he could feel it. He bounced as fast and hard as he could manage, chasing his orgasm.
“I’m not, I’m being honest. There’s gotta be someone you’ve got your eyes on. Some lucky witch or wizard.”
“Did he mention you’re dismissed from your regular duties for the next week? Because a week from today we need to have a rough plan.”
Harry's lips parted and he looked completely shocked. He knew Draco said he was going to flirt, but somehow, he didn't think Draco would go for it at his first chance. He hesitated but turned away. "I'm cooking. You'll survive a minute." He couldn't believe Draco was actually speaking to him and looking at him like that. He made two plates and set them on the table while Draco slowly made his way over to take a seat.
Harry got up with a grin and made his way back inside, pulling off his coat as he entered the sitting room. “Have fun in Paris?”
Draco bit his lip, his eyes glued to the moving target before him. Part of him wanted to pounce and jump in tongue-first. But he didn’t. Perhaps, next time.
“But you already know I will. So be a good boy,” he pushed Harry down so he was flat on his back, “and take your boxers off.”
“I promise, my jaw is alright.” Harry was still embarrassed about how he managed to get Draco in over halfway.
The blonde wasn’t surprised by Harry’s hesitance to domesticity. He knew the other wasn’t as much of a traditionalist and didn’t see how normal a quasi-arranged marriage was to Draco’s class, even though their's was completely arranged.
Harry spent the morning and afternoon charging right through the restricted section. The W’s were a bit beefy as there were a lot of books with titles that began with werewolf, witch, or wizard. X was only a few books long, Y had some interesting books on dark Yule rituals, and Z had two sickening books on zombification.
Harry had never been pinned down like this before in his life. There were spells that had rendered him immobile before. But he’s never had someone physically pin him down with such a carnal intention.
But only an hour later, at breakfast, everyone noticed that Dean and Seamus were both having a hard time looking at Harry.
Dean always enjoyed the warmth of Seamus on his lap. He also enjoyed how relaxed Seamus became in his arms. He was proud to hold Seamus, like it was certainly something that not many people could say they’ve done. He buried his face into the back of Seamus’ shoulder and closed his eyes, deciding he could sit like that forever.
He remembered the few toys he had as a child. They all ended up broken by Dudley. He remembered every name he was called, every almost-friend chased away from him, every Christmas and birthday his spirits were crushed, how he wasn’t allowed to sing, to dance, to play, to be a child, every teacher who pretended they didn’t know what was happening, each physical ailment that was cast aside, every neighbor who looked at him with pity, every officer he prayed would notice him, every scar and bruise that he wished someone would question, every family gathering where he witnessed a loving family that he yearned to be apart of, every night realizing he would never escape, every day realizing his life was a living hell, when he realized that he’d rather be dead than a slave, every time he only wanted someone to love him. Someone. Anyone. Please. Everyone who finally loved him, the friends he made, only to have them die one by one, slowly picked off, dragging on, never knowing who was next. Spending his entire fucking life in pain and misery.
Neither of them were surprised that it happened. But they wondered the extent of which the radio was enchanted.
With four bags of clothes and a grin, Harry made it back home and began setting up his new wardrobe. He got so excited he decided to change into a pair of black jeans, new shoes, and a button-up that he tucked in the front. He checked himself out in the mirror a moment and felt good until he got to his face. He tilted his head and grabbed a pair of scissors and a comb, deciding to undergo the tedious process of trimming his beard. He kept it just long enough to look mature. He liked the appearance of dark and heavy stubble on his face, not planning on growing it out. He put the scissors away and messed with the hair on his head. It was just as wild as ever, but with it's newfound length, it was curlier than before. They weren't perfect curls, more like soft waves and twists. He raised an eyebrow and found that he really liked it.
The Weasley children, the sons of Luna, and most of Harry’s kids all knew about Harry’s past. The Weasley children were a nosy and unstoppable force, Harry couldn’t have kept his past from him, and even if he wanted to, they’d learn all about his childhood and life in their first year History of Magic lessons. The sons of Luna were told by the Weasley kids, but Harry’s own children found out in school.
But now that Harry was finally getting over his physical ailments, Draco thought it was the perfect time to get back on his plan to make Harry his. He had to briefly abandon it when Harry got injured. But now that he was healed, he was ready to turn up the charm once more.
Draco laughed and looked down at his own thighs. He supposed they were muscular from years of Quidditch. He never thought anyone would find them to be particularly attractive. “Wow, Potter. I didn’t think you were so wanton. You have no standards. You think almost everyone is attractive. You’ve thought of shagging your own friends. You thought of shagging the enemy! Seriously?! Now here you are, fawning over a Slytherin’s thighs. How pathetic.”
“I hope I can still hex you in the afterlife, cause I’m going to try.” He flopped down on his own bed. “Can we go to sleep now?”
He remembered seeing Draco perform cleaning spells on himself sometimes. He decided it might be nice of him to do the same. He pulled out his wand and awkwardly aimed it. He looked away and blushed as he cast the charm. He let out a whimper and squirmed at the feeling of magic running somewhere so sensitive. He put his wand away and looked at his reflection once more before there came a knock at the door.
Draco let out a laugh, glad the other found his jest to be in good tastes. "Alright, so they go out for coffee, and then what? They have to have lives other than each other. What do they work as, who are their friends?"
“No Harry, it isn’t only a fracture. Skele-Gro fixes broken or, as it happened to you, missing bones. It’s too potent to fix a simple fracture.”
“Harry, I’m so sorry. I wish I could’ve done more.” Molly said as she wrapped her arms around the boy.
Harry's jaw dropped and he stared at her a moment, suddenly reminded that she is, without a doubt, one of brightest people this world has ever seen. While he marveled at her, he was hit with his own idea. "I can use my anonymity to leak a story saying he's the man to beat, he's the one to watch out for. I'll let my opponents fall victim to rumor and watch what is written come to fruition." He tilted his head and beamed at Hermione, "I think you ought to sent Pawk a letter. I feel you two would get along very well. I'd also like to recommend that you and Pawk befriend Crow. With her soiled reputation, you two could offer her a friendship and sway her to our side. It would benefit Pawk's cause, and it wouldn't hurt to have an influential friend when you eventually run for Minister."
His body began to curl up slightly, protecting himself. His knees pressed together and his shoulders pushed forward, causing him to sink into himself. He wanted to curl up into a ball but couldn’t. This was the best he could manage.
While they cooked, Harry brought up a new topic. “So, I remembered you said that there were only four books in that shop that you didn’t own. Seamus mentioned something like that once. He said he there hasn’t been anything new in nearly a year.”
Their eyes widened and they looked at each other as if they should have known. Unfortunately, it spurred a half-hour conversation on the schematics of it. Harry did his best to hide his impatience and eventually got the conversation back on track. They nearly dismissed his revival of the topic of Pawk’s bill but agreed that they were voting in favor of it. His sigh of relief was nearly audible. When they offered more drinks, he politely declined and said he had to get going to meet a friend, but thanked them for conversation and paid for their drinks thus far.
Now Draco gave a light blush. He stretched a bit, and though he didn’t feel a trace of arousal, he decided to mess with Harry a bit. “You shouldn’t speak to me like this, you know. I haven’t wanked in, what was it? Five days?”
Draco pressed down as hard as he could, and though it was stark, he tried moving even faster than before. He wanted to be overwhelmed.
“Finally." Harry was glad to have someone who was willing to seriously meddle in Dean and Seamus' lives in order to get them together. Everyone else had insisted that they let Seamus and Dean come together naturally, but Harry knew that wouldn't happen. "On the train here, Seamus sat on Dean’s lap.”
What Harry didn’t notice was that between his name and the paragraph about him, his net worth was listed.
“It was this broken mix of English and parseltongue, and you were shouting it out, and it was so cute.” Draco explained between chuckles.
Harry glanced down at it, realizing it's size. But rather than defend the book, he got excited about it's content. "It’s a complete history on dark magic of Vampires. Rituals done with Vampire blood, how to use their venom, how to extract it and keep the Vampire contained and alive. It’s quite gruesome and a bit fucked.”
Draco tilted his head and got up from his seat, moving to lean on the front of the desk. "Have there been any other side effects of this bond?" He was a bit more comfortable around Harry, but as he got closer, the dragon on Harry's lap eyed him.
With that, people afflicted with lycanthropy were given full rights as members of the magical community and were removed from the list of creatures. They were also given their own department in the Ministry, which created nearly a hundred new jobs for them. It was called, “Lupin's Law”. The legal term for werewolves was also changed to, “people afflicted with lycanthropy”. By calling them werewolves, one could argue that the rights of “people” didn't belong to them, as they were not people. It was an intentional wording that allowed bigots to push their ideals into law. Now, it was undone.
“I’m going to pretend I don’t hear you.” He was willing to humor the conversation earlier, but honestly he had no real evidence to prove what his role in sex would be, so he figured it was better to deflect the conversation than admit he had no argument.
Draco nodded, a little startled by the information. “Yea, a bit. I hope we end up together so I can piss you off for eternity.”
He naturally wanted to gift him some nice robes or a suede satchel, part of him also considered getting him a book. He forewent those ideas and found himself looking at kitchenware, as Harry enjoyed baking. Still, he felt like it wasn't enough. He briefly considered a bouquet, but he doubted Harry would enjoy it. Then again, Harry did seem to enjoy nature. As he passed by the selections of bouquets, he found himself at seeds. There weren't a lot out, as the upcoming winter wasn't a very popular season to start growing anything, but they had out apple seeds and a few flowers. He bought them and made his way back home, feeling a bit better about himself.
He wanted to feel bad. He wanted to feel remorse, he yearned for any semblance of regret, he needed to know the ache of contrition, but he didn’t. He didn’t feel good about it, but he didn’t feel bad either. It was as meaningful to him as stepping on a flower. You don’t think about it, you don’t notice it, the damage is done, and it makes no difference to you. Killing Voldemort meant absolutely nothing to him. There was neither qualm nor glory. Just another thoughtless action. That was all.
“My father gave up so many Death Eaters that he was able to use it to bargain for his freedom. He’s out. One of the conditions is that I’m barred from returning to the Manor until I inherit it.”
Hermione didn’t respond for a moment. Of course she had no qualms about it, but she wanted to be careful with her proceedings as she wanted to encourage and support Harry as much as possible. It was, after all, a heavy confession.
Draco tilted his head, raising an eyebrow, “Perhaps I was wrong, Seamus might not be the bottom after all.” He mumbled to Harry, who jabbed him in the side.
“I don’t just like him, as a friend. I-“ He cut himself off, a bit embarrassed to confess his feelings. “I’m in love with him. Completely, utterly, deeply, foolishly.”
Harry, on the other hand, was thrown back into politics. Due to the attacks, much of Wizengamot’s meetings were pushed back to make room for the quite urgent and quick trial of the Yaxley man. Guilty and thrown in Azkaban. That left two weeks of work to be dealt with as soon as possible. He could hardly catch a break. Now he was reminded of why he couldn’t wait to leave. Not to mention those stupid plum robes he was made to wear. He began putting on jeans and shirts on under it instead of the proper layers.
