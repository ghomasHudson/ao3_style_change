Draco watched him go into their connected bathroom, seeing the door swing shut. His lips turned upwards into a bright grin as he felt that familiar tugging in his chest. Maybe he did have a shot after all.
Draco pulled him into a short kiss, careful not to mess up his hair. “Thank you.”
“Probably Scrivenshaft’s, I need more parchment and a new bottle of a certain ink. You?”
“Don’t laugh but green. Not because I’m a Slytherin, it just happens to be my favourite colour.” Draco admitted,
Draco walked next to him. “Uh, Neville said you’d be here. And sweets are okay, in small amounts. And definitely not treacle tarts, despite how much you tell me they’re good.” He picked up a few peppermint toads, deciding to get them.
"The bloke said life was too short for our nonsense." Seamus added.
“How long have you and Pansy been together?” Harry asked seriously and Draco burst out laughing. “W-what?”
“I could’ve paid, Harry.” Draco said more seriously, trying not to focus on the fact that Harry was now holding onto his wrist. He could so easily grab his hand. Harry shrugged and continued towards the pub, dragging poor Draco along. He saw McGonagall and changed their path to go speak to her. “Harry, no. C’mon, let’s go to the pub.”
Harry cleared his throat before he answered. "Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude. I was passing by to see what kind of room I could expect for the party, I had no idea you…"
Harry's shoulders curled forward as his chin almost touched his chest as the man almost hissed at him. That man was quite difficult to get around with. Would have thought the war changed people for the good…
Well, Draco couldn't agree to those words more. "Why in the world is it so difficult..." He mumbled against the other's chest. "Why are we making this so difficult?" He looked up, finding himself closer to the other than he'd anticipated. Merlin, why was that boy so dreamy...
As soon as he got the paper on top of the book, he clicked on top of the pen to write. His mind registered the clicking sound and he was paused in his actions for a moment. That had been a while, hearing the sound of a regular pen. When he saw the blank paper his attention was back. Right, letter for Ron and Hermione. That should be easy.
Flushing as all the attention was drawn to them at once, Harry picked the other from the ground. Well, he tried - keyword 'tried'. "Stop it. You're embarrassing," he hissed. "Fuck if I care, unlike you I know how to talk myself out of stuff. So, I guess you're the only one being affected by this," he smirked.
It felt weird to laugh while laying down on the bed, yet he couldn't help himself. "My bad. Forgot someone already did. Let me rephrase it. 'It's not as if someone will just break down the door to sweep me off my feet'. Is that better, Mal?"
Soon enough, fingers found blond locks and the glasses-wearing boy breathed in deeply as he pressed his face in the soft mop of hair. If they both wanted this so badly, then why did they hold themselves back? What had stopped them?
"I mean… this was discussed during class, but you're usually busy with anything but the class, so, this doesn't surprise me." He stopped for a bit. "Snape isn't exactly the kindest either, he doesn't reward students in the right way. It should be based on knowledge, not houses." It sounded like a thing a Slytherin would never say, but it still fits with one of the main Slytherin traits: wanting to achieve things. Some preferred to do that by cheating, but most purebloods actually played a fair game.
"Draco, there you are! That's great to hear, we have been setting up a list here as well. We should add them to it later."
While he hummed in agreement, Harry noticed the ache he felt at the thought of the two of them hiding away from the other students.
He wondered what Ron and Hermione would say if they had seen him with Malfoy like this. Surely, they wouldn't believe him anymore about the guy and him 'just lately having become friends' anymore. Harry was quite sure Ron would point that out as well, whether with Malfoy around or one-on-one. And he had to be honest that there was nothing he could do to stop it. He longed for the other's touch. Maybe he should have buried this crush before it could grow. But for now, he was quite content the way they were.
Being around Potter kind of felt like being around a puppy, or a very friendly dog. He'd noticed this before, but was still kind of charmed by it. Draco had to admit that he liked his kindness and acceptance. None of his other friends were like this, it had to be some kind of Gryffindor thing. Gryffindors were often kind and warm towards others, but Draco had never been on the receiving end of this. It was nice, and maybe a tad addicting. He had to admit that he was drawn to Potter's warmth like a moth to a lightbulb. His only fear was if it would burn him.
He then took a step closer to the other and lowered his voice, pressing his lips softly against the skin right between his jaw and ear.
Looking at the decorations in the hospital wing, he started to hum again. "We need our own decorations as well."
So... The Gryffindor had actually appreciated his music? Draco wasn't sure why this stunned him as much as it did. But that wasn't even all; Harry had also asked him to continue playing.
Suddenly, the idea of them becoming friends seemed very interesting to Draco. It would cause chaos. It would make things exciting. It felt so rebellious and daring. Something about it really intrigued Draco.
What was he supposed to do now?
Even though the Slytherin had wanted Potter to leave since the first moment he'd noticed he was in the room, he couldn't get himself to just send him away like that. Besides, would Potter tell anyone about this? What did he even think of all of this? It was like giving him a peek into not only Draco's head but also his childhood. What would the other do with this information?
That was probably all exaggerated, but it was a thought he couldn't push away.
"I'll just make sure you'll regret it if you don't."
"That could work you know," he agreed.
"So. Ron and Hermione told me you uh, fetched them and such. I don't really recall much, but I guess I should thank you."
"But it's Christmas, most students are gone anyway... If we just sneak into the kitchens, we might make it without being seen."
"I'm the one who actually should ask that," he softly chuckled. "After all, It was I who had draped myself all over you. But just to have answered your question, no that was no problem. Even though I'm still not as used to it."
A shiver raced up the blonde's spine after the other had briefly let his lips flutter over Draco's neck. Heat spread over his face, which luckily, was buried in the other's sweater. He loved the feeling of fingers raking through his hair, and he loved being this close and comfortable, but he hadn't expected contact any more intimate than that. His neck still seemed to be tingling a bit. He didn't dislike it. They both seemed to be a bit sedated by each other.
"You've got to be kidding me," he breathed when he reached the Gryffindor.
Malfoy hummed. "I'll try." There was no way people were gonna listen to him, but if Potter dared him to do it, there was no way he was backing off.
"I have a feeling you're not gonna leave in a while," Harry laughed. He and potions, not taking long? Malfoy had to be kidding, right?
He was dazed, yes, but not that dazed.
Oh god, they hadn't fallen asleep like this, did they? Why didn't Malfoy push him off, or gently drag his head over to the real pillow at least? Had the other been too tired to care? Harry felt heat rise to his cheeks as he clumsily tried to get away from the other.
He hummed as he took the ends of the blanket to wrap it tighter around his frame, feeling quite cozy in it before he looked up to answer. A surge of energy shot through him as their eyes met and his breath was stuck in his throat for a moment before the need of breathing made him let it out in a shaky breath. What was that just now? His eyes fell back on the blanket. "Yeah, people did. Snape as he gave me that stupid assignment and, like I said, Voldemort in my nightmares to state some examples."
When the song ended, he lifted his head and tipped it back so that he was now looking at the ceiling. A laugh-ish sigh left his mouth. Yes, he had actually just done that. He felt so grateful that Potter seemed to appreciate his so-called hobby.
Draco noticed the other tense up a bit.
"Oh, I see," he mumbled. "You know, if I didn't know any better, Draco, I would have said you were offering."
Flashback:
Father: Sirius Black
Morning at the Riddle manor…
Harry was sitting on his bed when he heard a tap on his window. The young boy looked over and saw an owl.  He smiled a little and opened the window and took the note from the owl and opened it. It was a letter from Griphook telling him to meet him.  Harry left right away and when he arrived he met a goblin named Snaggletooth.
Later that day. . .
I hope you are doing well. I don’t need to tell you how I am. You’ve known just how I felt for a long time and will still remain the same probably for eternity. I’ve heard rumors that you, Lucius, Draco, and the rest of our friends are trying to take down Dumbledore. I admire what you are trying to accomplish, but I ask you not to go through with it. You are fighting a war where the game is rigged. We’ve seen what they’ve done. The losses that would follow. We weren’t able to stop them before and still we can’t now. Dumbledore will win, no matter the cost. I lost Rodolphus and my sons to him. I don’t want to lose you too. For the good of you and your family, Cissy, I am asking as your big sister to not do this. Don’t do it. Don’t go up against Dumbledore. Promise me. I’ll probably see you again during the winter holidays. I want to see that your family is doing fine. Please stay safe, little sister.
The Malfoys
Dear sister,
Remy paced endlessly in her mother’s office. Hadrian and the others were holding the fort down until her mother returned. Luckily, there were no crashes or shouts. No spells being cast or roofs collapsing in on themselves, so that means no one was arguing. Remy repeated her mother’s words like a song: “Pup, we need to talk later on. Once class is over, meet me in my office. Don’t look at anyone or say anything. Just discreetly go to my office.” Those words scared her. Remy expected them to talk and laugh, catch up on the days they weren’t together. She did not know if her mother was going to give her bad news. From his tone, it sure did sound like bad news. Tirelessly pacing, she ran the words back and forth in her head like it was the most impossible riddle in the world. In the midst of her pacing, she caught sight of a few of her mother’s belongings. She remembered seeing some of them when he taught last year, but she never paid much attention to them until now. Stacks of unfamiliar books lined countertops. There were tanks filled with many different creatures: grindylows, hinkypunks, changelings, and many others. Jars were filled with many materials: leaves, flowers, liquids, animal specimens, formaldehyde. Crystals, metals, and ores of many colors covered the desktop. Near her mother’s bedside, was a photo of him and his friends. Before Remy arrived at Hogwarts, her mother told her the story of the picture.
Death Eaters
“Hadrian, I missed you so much, where were you?” Severus said as he looked over the young boy for any injuries.  All Hadrian could do was hug his mother tighter and cry into his shoulder.  Tom hugged the both of them then they pulled away so Hadrian could talk.

Chapter 3 is now finished. Sorry it took so long. This thing called writer's block hit me and with help of a close friend I got to finish yet another chapter. So please enjoy.
Severus’s POV:
(See the end of the chapter for
She was waiting for Severus to come to the classroom, but he was late. He missed the first two periods with the Slytherins and right now it was going to be class time with the Gryffindors. Violet was getting more worried about Severus as each minute ticked away on the clock. Hadrian said that the professor was going to come back today, but it looked like he wasn’t coming. She hoped that her favorite teacher would have come back today, yet it seemed like wishful thinking. “I hope the professor has gotten over his illness. I’ll go check on him at the hospital wing later on,” she thought to herself. Bringing her mind back to the present, she focused on the class in front of her. The Gryffindors were being rowdy today. Dean and Seamus were playing with their cauldrons, Lavender was gossiping to other girls who cared to listen to her stories, and her brother Neville was for sure saying nasty things about her behind her back to his tablemates. The one who did seem to partly listen was Alira, the familiar face she met earlier. The Gryffindor girl was doodling on her parchment. From her vantage in the room, Violet could see it was of Hadrian’s weapon. The day that Tom had taken out her heart, she tended to Alira’s wounds as Hadrian and Valorie took Severus to the hospital wing. The two got to talking when they left. Although nearly everyone else distrusted that girl, she seemed ok. However, Violet became a little uneasy when Alira began to talk smack about the professor. “Professor Snape is a good man. He has done nice things for people. The only reason he is mean to you Gryffindors is because you are mean to him. If you say another bad thing about him, I won’t hold back my instinct to hurt you,” she remembered threatening her. The shouting from the Gryffindors became louder. She was getting annoyed with them real quick. Violet spotted a small knife near the edge of the desk. Taking it in hand, she threw it at the door. “QUIET!” she screamed. The students immediately stopped talking, watching the blade travel across the room. It was aimed to hit the center of the door and splinter its wood. What she did not know or expect was for Severus to open that door. A hush fell across the room as the blade was about to pierce his face. Inches from his nose, Severus caught the blade with two fingers. The Gryffindors gasped at the spectacle, wondering if this was Violet’s last time at the school before she would be expelled. Moving the blade away from his face, Severus looked at the knife, then at Violet who was heaving with anger. He was impressed at how tough she was becoming and her excellence in knife throwing. Severus gave her a smile. “Nice throw,” he said, smiling at Violet. “Nice catch, Professor,” Violet quipped. Severus flipped the blade into the air and caught it by its hilt. As soon as he got a grip of the knife, he threw it back at Violet. The knife flew in the air, soaring through Neville’s cauldron and shattering it into a million pieces. It then arrowed towards Violet, who caught the knife by the edge of its hilt. The class gasped in unison at the scene. Neville looked at her sister in anger. Violet gave her brother a sideways glare as she clutched the blade. His face no longer showed anger, but now taken aback with surprise. He was looking at a sister he didn’t even know anymore. He and the rest of the class turned to see Severus slowly gliding his way towards the other side of the room. Violet moved over so Severus could take his place. “Don’t think I am going to ignore how rude you were being to Ms. Longbottom. As punishment, I am taking 70 points from Gryffindor for being unruly and undisciplined ingrates. I trust this won’t happen again?” The Gryffindors began to argue for how unfair it was, but they silenced themselves when the professor looked like he was about to subtract more points from their house. “Now, we will get started. I’ll be teaching from here on out and Ms. Longbottom will help me survey you all. Today, we are going to be making a Confusing Concoction. You should already know its ingredients and how to make it by now. Whoever makes the potion with the most accuracy will get top marks. Go get your ingredients.” The Gryffindors scurried to grab what they needed. While they mixed their potions, Violet turned to Severus, her face in a full glow. “I’m so glad you are ok, Professor. Are you feeling better now that you are over your illness?” Ruffling his robes, he gave a small nod. “Yes. I am better, thank you. Violet, I am truly grateful for what you have done for me. Tom and Hadrian told me what a wonderful job you have done when I was gone.” Violet filled with pride at the compliment. “Thanks, professor. But, it was really not a big deal. You helped me. It is only fair that I help you.” Master and apprentice watched the class make the potions, criticizing everyone for their mistakes. Violet caught him up on what the classes did when he was away. They watched the class from the desk. Violet just noticed that he didn’t have Amelia with him. “Where’s your adorable baby? I would have thought you kept her around at all times,” Violet asked him. “She is with Tom. I would have brought her to class if I came earlier today. Tom insisted that he watch her as I slowly get back into teaching.” Violet looked at the empty cradle near his desk. Amelia did make helping the classes all the more tolerable. Her cute face made people forget about their troubles. About half an hour past when the Gryffindors began to finish up. As each student called out that they were finished, Severus and Violet went over to their tables to grade them. “Horrible. Disgraceful. An utter waste of time,” they told Gryffindors as they tested their mixtures. Most of the class got Ds and Fs. “Professor Snape? I’m done with my potion,” Alira called to him. The two headed over to her workstation and tested out her potion. “Not bad. Not good either, but close. I give you a B.” She frowned at the professor. She knew she did everything right. “Professor, I followed the recipe exactly. I checked my results many times. Why am I getting a B?” Severus turned back to face her. He leaned in a little closer, whispering to where only she could hear. “You know, you are right. I could have given you a full grade. However, on top of shouting out my name in class, questioning me and my helper’s recipes and methods, insulting my family, and may I add your terrible lie that you had saved yourself a few days earlier with, I simply do not like you. That is why you are getting a B. Now sit back down and do your work.” Alira looked away, submitting to his insults and did as he said. She returned to sketching out the weapons. Severus walked away while Violet lingered for a moment. “I would have given you an A-. Not everyone can make pretty accurate potions.” she said. “Alira, I think you are a nice person. Just, just don’t try and hurt the professor. He and the others might lighten up once you do.” Violet followed Severus to the next student. To her disgust, it was her brother. “P-p-professor. I-I’m done.” He held out his replacement cauldron out to the both of them. Violet was the one who looked into the cauldron first. It looked nasty. The liquid looked like it was curdling into lumps and it smelled unpleasant. Violet had to fight her reflex to gag. “What is this?” she asked her brother. “It’s the Confusing Concoction,” he sniped at her. Grabbing the ladle, she scooped up the contents. It looked more like a dubious mush than a potion. “The only good thing that might come out of this potion is that if they were dumb enough to drink it, it might kill them. Unfortunately, that is the only use this useless blob has. So, brother, F!” Neville fumed. He knew that he was not the best at potions and that was mostly Professor Snape’s fault for terrifying him in class. He wasn’t scared of him right now, but raging that his sister is the one who is failing him in class. “No. I don’t get an F. Violet, you may have impressed the faculty with your ‘amazing’ potion skills, but I am not falling for it. You just suck up to them so you can have people by your side. That is not how the world works, sister. I’m writing to Gran about this. And I bet she will send you an embarrassing Howler for you being who you are: lousy and horrible and a suck up!” Violet had enough. Her brother had no right to treat her this way when she was helping to teach a class. She slammed her hands on his desk, rattling the remaining contents on it. “Enough! I’m not the same scared girl I was earlier, Neville. I’ve changed, for the better. You’re petty insults held me back. I’ve made so many mistakes and because of it, including into thinking I could make you proud. But now, now I realized that I am much stronger than you wanted me to believe. You never knew me, the real me, at all.” Neville could swear that her eyes flickered grey for a moment, grey like a Malfoy’s. It was only for a quick second, her eyes then shimmering back to their normal fuchsia. Neville stood there dumbstruck, watching his sister glare at him until she and the professor moved on to the next table. The class went by quite quick. Violet and Severus were quite unimpressed with them, but what else can you expect from Gryffindors? After shooing them out, Severus got to talking with Violet. “Violet, do you know why I was absent for the past few days?” he inquired. “Wasn’t it because you were sick? Hadrian told me. Is there something else that I don’t know?” Taking a deep breath, Severus told her the truth. Violet handled the news quite better than Severus expected; although, she was confused on some parts. “I am so happy for you Severus, but I’m worried that you won’t be ok. Maybe you should have me as a substitute from now on whenever you don’t feel good. And even if you do feel good, I can teach the classes. You saw today. I’m capable enough of doing so,” she emphasized. Severus smiled. “I know you are capable. But, Dumbledore will get suspicious if you keep taking my place. Um...so how’s this? Only when my pregnancy is an extreme emergency, you can teach. I trust that you can do this.” Violet nodded with vigor. “I will.” She got up from her spot and began to stuff her bag. “Where are you heading, Vi?” he asked. “The training room. We decided to meet there at lunch sometimes. And I also promised to bring a few potions,” she asserted as she opened her bag to reveal the tiny pockets made for each individual vial. “When you have the time, come visit us. Valorie told me that she’s been dying to show you around. You’d be surprised how well we cleaned it up. Bye, Severus. I’ll see you then.” Violet slung her giant mushroom beanie over her ears and left to join the others.
"Merlin, let me wake up on time," he mumbled as soon as he had finally arrived on the side of his bed. "I don't need both Snape and Malfoy breathing down my neck."
He'd never taken the proper time to think or feel anything about it. Now that he did, he realized that the emotions he'd put away had been piling up. The letter had affected him, contrary to his own beliefs. He felt hurt, and abandoned. He had been making things up to hide the true meaning of the letter.
"After that, the potion should turn green," Malfoy began. "If it doesn't, add more mushroom. Easy as that. I hope you do know what comes after that?" He looked up to the other, searching for a sign that told him he didn't have to repeat his whole explanation again. After that explanation, the rest came back to him and his mouth shaped in a small 'o'. "Yes, yes. My bad," he grinned. He picked up his quill, dipped it in the ink and continued writing.
"I'm sorry for everything," he continued. "And I don't just mean during the war, I mean before it too. I've been a jerk and I've never been mature enough to apologize for it." He sounded pathetic, bitter, and absolutely ashamed of himself. His usual proud scowl had turned into a broken face. He wasn't the vain, arrogant, important boy anymore. He was just Draco, a human like everyone else.
Luna, who stood next to him, rose her eyebrows. Not only because of the first name basis, but for the silence that lingered with the other students too. Harry sensed her speak up already but didn't hold her back. Maybe it would do well if she would speak.
Maybe that was why he loved it so much: all the drama surrounding them made it interesting and intense.
Harry's mind started drifting towards his friends. Ron and Hermione as well, they had given in to old habits as well. Yet things had been so different during the war… Bad memories came back against his will and he sucked in a deep breath. Stop.
Now that he'd finally told them what was going on, he felt more confident than before. Blaise had helped him see that even though not everyone would be able to forgive each other, Draco shouldn't let himself be held back by it. He had decided to start doing the right thing and would stick with it.
He got up and started fixing his clothes a bit more.
One of them noticed him and Harry, and walked up to them, asking them in a squeaky voice what they would like to have.
There had to be something to get his mind off of things, there had to be something he could do. Malfoy was pacing the common room, thinking of a way to distract himself. Reading wasn't good enough, and going outside with his broom would be no good in this cold either. He didn't want to spend time with his friends as well, he honestly preferred to not talk to anyone for a while. Then what was there left to do?
He couldn't wait to begin.
"Right, Christmas." The Slytherin got up and hopped onto the other's bed, pretending to not be phased by that at all. "I haven't really talked to my friends about it yet, actually… You see…" Draco hesitated for a moment, biting his lip and wondering how he could explain that he hadn't even told his friends that they were friends. "... They don't even know we hang out like this. I'm just… I don't even know for sure why I haven't told them."
"A-ah," Harry managed to get out. Illegal stuff, huh? That did sound like something they would do. He didn't wish for that to be brought, he knew himself to be quite dense when it came to things. Someone might slip him some of that stuff without him noticing. Though he doubted they would even go ahead and do that, he still would prefer that that kind of stuff was out of his reach.
There were no students down here anyway, he could play around for a bit.
One that made him powerless but which he didn't resist.
He looked around and fiddled a bit with his robes. "Sorry, you were probably not waiting to hear me whine about excuses."
"No," he stated, "you're garbage."
When Draco finally realized what he was doing, he quickly looked away. That had not just happened, that was just because Potter had saved him a few times. People tended to like heroes, right? That was all just some kind of natural thing. It didn't mean anything weird at all.
Draco couldn't think clearly, he hardly registered Harry's words. He was too busy trying to comprehend that he was even there. It took him a while to figure things out, but eventually, he did. Sort of.
Then why didn't he move? For Merlin's sake, why was he still lying there, contemplating useless things?
It took a while for him to drift off as well, but eventually, he did.
They chatted for a bit in silence as both of them gave in to their faults and after some minutes they broke out in smiles before embracing each other. Harry was glad to know it was okay between them again and that Ron was willing to give Malfoy a chance.
Ron didn't seem to be pleased to have been stopped in his tracks but after a few seconds, he crossed his arms and sniffed.
Eventually, the nurse left and returned with some water and a potion. She put them on the little table next to the bed and asked Harry to drink them. After that, she left, muttering something about students not taking good care of themselves. This left the two students in a slightly awkward silence. Draco wasn't sure what to say or do, he had no experience with this sort of thing. He was useless when it came to healthcare or comforting someone. "I suppose I could try to fetch your… friends," he spoke eventually, looking everywhere but at the pale looking boy.
Draco decided there was only one thing he could do to get attention. As Harry walked away, he ran after him, dropped himself onto the floor and started rolling around dramatically. "Pottaaah!"
Draco wasn't sure if he would be able to do that while the other watched him. He wasn't even sure if he was able to play in front of anyone. However, he did want to do it. Or at least try. He didn't know why exactly. His practice time would go to waste if he stopped just because Potter had walked in, maybe that was a reason. Or maybe he just enjoyed playing the instrument he loved so much. Whichever reason it was, it caused him to get a proper grip on his violin again and lifted it up a bit.
"Then don't just kiss people."
"Well, take my cup with you then, if you're going down there already."
"I'm keeping you here until you can normally function again," the nurse, who was done examining Harry, sighed. "Try to take better care of yourself next time boy, this could have serious consequences. Fainting is just the first and least severe one." A hum left the black-haired boy's lips as he went to stare at the ceiling. He recalled how back at his uncle and aunt's house he would feel nauseous when he was locked up for long in the small, dusty space. He couldn't really comprehend why it would have such an impact on his body. Doesn't it like, adjust to circumstances over time...?
He did want to go. He didn't like hanging around this arrogant twat. The boy who lived. The young Malfoy was still convinced he didn't deserve the fame. He hadn't achieved it, he'd just rolled into it. To Draco, a Slytherin, this had always seemed very unfair. However, not liking Potter meant that he'd do anything to annoy him. If the boy asked him to leave, he simply wouldn't. "You'll fail potions, you know. With an essay like that…"
Draco couldn't do much about Voldemort haunting his dreams, that was out of his reach. He could, however, do something about the homework. He felt terrible as he thought of how pleased he'd been after hearing Snape giving Potter the extra work. Maybe he could make that right just a little bit.
As he pressed himself closer to the other he let out a little whine. Had he acted like this that night as well? If so, he was surprised the other had put up with him. When Harry had dated Ginny he never really had any problems with giving her hugs, though his heart had felt fluttery. Then again, he had never shared a bed with her… Lingering on that thought, he suddenly felt his mouth move. Harry was silent himself until he realized what he had just said. 'Have you ever dated someone?'
"Thank you," he said while preparing his tea. The elf nodded and scurried off, already busy with the next task.
Harry forgets about a potion assignment and gets himself in trouble
"Is it really now?" Draco mused back, shifting into a more comfortable position on the bed. He looked around for a bit and already felt his mind wander off to the events that happened there the previous day. It was never going to leave him completely, wasn't it? Potter was never going to leave him. Well, not his mind anyway.
He wasn't getting out of here soon...
He walked up to Granger since he thought she'd have the least aggressive reaction and would actually try to figure out what had happened. Weasley would just get angry. He cleared his throat to alarm them of his presence and held up the paper as he spoke. "Potter's in the hospital wing, he nearly fainted due to a lack of sleep and food. He's still a bit dazed, but I do think he wants to see you guys, so that's why I'm here."
It was clear Potter wasn't in the mood to talk, but he cared little about that. "I want you to forget what happened just now." That surprised the Gryffindor. Forget what he just said? Well, that little- "I'm not sure what you're talking about Malfoy." He let a silence linger to give the blond time to form an answer before cutting in. "Or you must be talking about the way you had been rolling around the floor? I mean, I knew you were in Slytherin but that it would mean you would just up and go act like a snake all the way?"
Why did he have to mention that? A frustrated growl came from him and he pulled on his locks to frame his face. Some kind of 'if I can't see you, you can't see me' tactic of some sort. He had been acting weird around Malfoy, Malfoy had been weird as well. To think he believed things would be less infuriating as usual. What a joke.
Draco put the potion, which was empty now, away and averted his eyes. Yes, Potter had actually just compared his smile to a Christmas miracle. Why in the world was that such a big deal to him? "I guess I'm done here then... ?" He asked after a little while.
"I feel like a child," he mentioned, having progressed the scene somewhat by now. "That's… not surprising actually, I mean you're being fed…" Draco let out a small, almost laugh-ish sniffle. This whole scene was just too idiotic. He really hoped Potter was dazed enough to not remember this had ever happened afterward. Harry looked at him with his mouth still open, eyes slowly widening. "It can laugh." He made it sound as if he just figured out a miracle, something like that he figured how to survive on Mars or something. Now gawking at the Christmas tree he started to slowly speak. "Miracles do happen. It's Christmas time at last…"
"Thank you," Malfoy sat down on the sofa and gently placed his violin next to it. "But I'm not going to play at the party, sorry. You're actually the fourth person to hear me play, my parents and Pansy being the previous three. I wouldn't... I just don't think I could play at the party."
Rubbing his eyes he looked at his two friends. "Yeah, I'm sorry. Didn't know it was this bad…" Hermione let out a long sigh. She looked at him for a few seconds before hummed and after a short pause, patted her lap twice before she stood up. "We're going back to class. Make sure to rest up, okay?"
Because he'd been standing in the middle of the hallway for a while, he decided to stretch and pace around for a bit, loosening his stiff muscles. The house elves had really taken their time with the Christmas decorations, he'd noticed it before, but it was quite impressive. Maybe they should decorate the room of requirement properly too when they held their party.
"Getting uncomfortably friendly, I see?" The blond boy responded, refraining from looking too surprised. Hiding behind disgust and irritation, his to-go escape plan. He and Potter weren't friends, where'd that idea even come from? Utterly stupid… right…?
Mrs. Weasley had made him another Christmas sweater, she had probably sent it to Ron. But why? Had she already assumed he wouldn't join them this Christmas? Harry would feel bad for not wearing it. He got out of the sweater he was wearing and slipped the red garment over his head as he let out a deep breath.
“Yeah. What of it?”
Potter chuckled before grabbing his suitcase and taking out some clothes and hygiene stuff. "Your hair products better not take up all the space, Malfoy."
The blonde reached under his bed and grabbed the broom, pulling it out. “This? It was from you? But… you said you bought something for someone you fancy.” Harry nodded in confirmation and Draco felt his heart beat faster as he set the broom back down. “I left because I saw Hannah kiss you.” He admitted
“It looks really nice, Dray.” Harry observed. He pulled his fiance closer, kissing him for a moment. “You happy with it?”
Draco frowned and cupped Harry’s cheek, turning his head up to look him in the eyes. “Don’t think about that. I’m here with you now, that’s all that matters.” Harry grabbed his other hand, bringing it to his lips and kissing it. Draco rolled his eyes and laughed. “Enough with the sappy shit, Potter.” He pressed their mouths together once more before latching onto his neck. His hips moved as he kissed and sucked, spreading pre-cum over the other’s stomach with the movement.

Yet a another chapter. we hope you enjoy this chapter.
Madam Pomferey let him sleep for a while. Once he was awake enough, she gave him a couple of potions for the pain and to help the baby. He fell back asleep after she gave him the medicine. She watched over him while he slept. He tossed and turned, mumbled a few times, but was pretty fine overall. As she straightened up the hospital wing, she watched the sky change color from a bright blue to honey gold. Even though many patients came and went, she was quite lonely. During Severus’s school years at Hogwarts, she helped him when he was being bullied and became quite close. Later on, Severus woke up from his sleep. He felt a little refreshed now that he relaxed. Feeling a little chilly from a draft, he pulled the blankets closer. “You’re awake. I’m glad.” Severus spotted Poppy walking towards him with a cup in hand. She placed it by his bedside. When looked in it, he saw a rich red liquid sloshing around. Blood. “I know it’s not Tom’s, but I always keep a vial handy just in case you need it,” Poppy said. Severus took the cup and slowly drank the blood. It wasn’t sweet like Tom’s, but it wasn’t bitter like Mud bloods. “Thank you. It helped.” As Severus looked around, he realized that the rest of the room was empty. “Not that busy today, huh? I would have thought you’d have your hands full with Ms. Weasley’s incident.” Poppy lightly chuckled at his remark. “I did have my hands full. Once Ms. Weasley came in, she was my top priority for most of the day. Your son did quite a number on her. After casting numerous spells and giving her potion after potion, she was recovered. Although, by the time she walked out of here, she looked quite shaken up. She is no longer physically hurt, but I bet that experience will traumatize her for a long time.” Severus took another sip of the blood. “Well, at least some good came out of that,” he whispered to himself. Poppy noticed that Severus was becoming agitated when she talked about Ginny, so she changed the topic to something else, trying to keep his mind off troubling thoughts. “I wanted to say ‘congratulations’ on your baby. I know I said it earlier, but I wanted to say it again because I am so happy for you, Severus. When I first saw you all those years ago as a lost and confused student, my concern was to help guide you to find happiness. I’m so glad that it finally came.” Severus smiled a bit. He really did come a long way once he put it in perspective. “Yes. I agree. Happiness is...something that I’ve noticed is really hard to come by. The moments I’ve had with Tom and the children were truly amazing. The thought of spending those moments with our newest member is quite thrilling.” “Speaking of your baby, Severus, your glamour spell will only harm the both of you more. If you want to hide your stomach from Dumbledore and the rest of the faculty is fine by me, but you need to be careful on how you are going to do that. Glamour illusions may sound appealing to use, but they sometimes have negative side effects.” Severus sighed. “And here comes the lecture.” Poppy placed a hand on his shoulder. “I’m not going to lecture you, Severus. I’ve already done more than enough with students today. From what Tom told me, Narcissa Malfoy has been watching your pregnancy thus far. If you two have the same friendship now as you did back then, she must be constantly berating you. Your friendship aside, Tom told me that she helped you correct your eating habits and made sure that the baby was growing correctly. Since she helped that from early on, the baby seems to be developing nicely for the first month. I don’t want that to regress because of a glamour spell. Maybe you should wear looser clothing from here on out to conceal your stomach. With that, no one will take a second glance.” Severus packed longer robes for special occasions. Seems like they now had to be put to use. He stared at the blood in the cup, watching the liquid slosh and sway as he moved it. Placing a hand on his stomach, he imagined seeing his child in front of him, holding hands together. That vision lasted for a couple of moments. Severus’s headache returned and felt dizzy, chills shuddering down his spine. Poppy noticed it immediately. “It’s already time for another dose of medicine. I’ll be right back.” Poppy hurried to grab it while Severus hugged his stomach in pain. Once she rushed back with the medicine, he gulped it down. The pain began to subside; the dizziness gone. “Get some rest, Severus. With the remainder of the year ahead of ourselves, you’re going to need it. If you need anything let me know. I’m here to help, ok?” Severus nodded to her. He quickly drifted off to sleep, the vision of his unborn child warming his thoughts.
“Mhm. If it bothers you I don’t have to help with quidditch.” Draco frowned, dropping Harry’s hand. He was filling in for the current captain while he was away for a month.
“Hey, sod off. I was starved for the first eleven years of my life, I’ll eat what I please.” Harry laughed.
“Be quiet, Longbottom.” Mrs Pince’s voice startled both boys.
“Shove it, Draco.” Harry laughed as he dragged him by the arm to the counter. He took Draco’s items as well as his and placed them on the counter before paying. Everything was placed into a bag and they headed outside.
“Treacle is great, I don’t know what you’re on about.” Harry chuckled. He suddenly stopped and reached for something behind them, trapping Draco between him and the candy shelves. Draco swallowed hard, he could smell him, he was so close. He smelled good, like the sugar he’d been eating and cedarwood, probably from his cologne. “Sorry…” He mumbled when he noticed what he’d done. But he didn’t move, just stared at the slightly shorter boy and moved closer.
"Where did that pillow go?" He shifted, rather searching for the soft bundle with his head in order not to lose the blankets again. Once he felt his hair pressing back against his scalp, he let his head fall on the supposed pillow in content. The pillow wasn't as soft as he had thought.
Pomfrey mumbled a few things about a potion and how she would be right back as he sipped his hot drink. He finished the cup and sneaked out of the bed to get away from the room.
He offered a small smile the blonde's way before turning around again to listen to Hermione. Ron was chewing away on his food and didn't seem bothered by her rant and all he could do is join his best friend. Eat and nod, the easy way to handle Hermione Granger.
Now that he had woken from the dream they'd in, reality hit him.
"As it comes to the dizziness from yesterday, I think it's gone," Harry stated. "Although I still have a headache, plus I'm hungry."
"We can't possibly walk out like this right..." He mumbled softly.
"I don't want you to say that when it was your mom that spared my life to get back to you," Harry snapped, freezing as he realized he had. He shouldn't have yelled, not with the other in this state. With a deep breath, he silently apologized, before pulling the other closer again. Harry reached for the other face again.
"Can be anything, as long as it interests me," Draco replied. There wasn't a specific thing he wanted. Proposing a deal like this was ridiculous anyway, but he still wasn't backing away. Maybe he'd expected Potter to react a lot more offended, or angry.
It confused him why the other had actually kissed him after thus.
Draco was happy with the other's explanation but decided to add some more to it. "I thought the party could be a way to strengthen the bonds between the houses, to get rid of the old feuds and have some fun before we all leave Hogwarts." He paused for a moment, looking at the group of people that was now silently listening to him. They wouldn't like what he had to say next. No one liked to talk about that, he'd noticed.
"You must really value that then," he mumbled. "And I just crash in to disturb you. Goodness, why didn't it just isolate the room, seclude it for others?" He ran his fingers through his hair, which did no good to it, and shook his head slightly.
"I might hope so, cuz else I would need a backup plan." It was nice to be complimented, even though it wasn't quite a direct one. Harry could sense the other believed in it. The weight of his lack of sleep from the other night started to get to him as another yawn tried to escape him. He laid his head down instead of resting his chin on the boy's frame.
If he hadn't been burning up already, he absolutely was now.
He had to stay floating in a sea of his own bigoted prejudices and norms, he had to survive himself in this.
Now that took a turn he had never thought it would. Surely, he had come to the conclusion the other appreciated his presence, but that was about it. Or so he thought. He wasn't sure what the blonde had been about to say, yet it couldn't be that. There was no way, he shouldn't hope for such a thing. It was ridiculous he even came up with the idea.
I'm not J.K Rowling and thus I don't own Harry Potter nor do I get paid for any of this.
He'd never known how good it could feel to do these things with someone.
He let the Gryffindor struggle for a while but eventually pulled the sheets up a bit so that he could wrap himself into them. Draco wondered how he could be complaining about the cold. Because of how close they were, he could feel the other's body warmth radiating through the sheets. He felt like moving even closer but instantly threw that idea away. What was he thinking?
In a swift motion, he poured himself a glass of water, put the jug back, and with the glass in hand made his way over to the other two.
To Malfoy, it seemed like the golden trio was in quite a quarrel. He didn't feel like he had the right to interfere but did realize he was the one who'd caused this. This meant he should be helping to resolve it.
Harry gets into the hospital wing, again. Draco gets mad and Harry is clumsy with words
He wasn't really sure what he was implying, all he knew was that he felt himself burning up under the guy's gaze.
He should have expected his friend to ask that, considering he had joined them on many occasions through the years. But this time he just didn't feel like he should interrupt. Yes, he desperately wanted to spend this Christmas with others, he needed the company, but he just couldn't allow himself to join the Weasley family.
"Thank you," he murmured, glancing back shortly at the elf.
It seemed like he already had though, and there was no stopping the chain reaction now that Draco had started it.
Draco was glad the subject had changed. "Probably something healthy that doesn't taste healthy," he guessed. "Why are you here anyway, just because of a cold?"
The room was silent, except for the sounds they made.
A broken sob left his throat before he seemed to force out the rest to that.
"The night you didn't have a nightmare… I don't want to brag but I was there too. And to be honest, I had quite some peaceful sleep too. So I don't want to propose any weird ideas, but the reason that you didn't have a nightmare could also be that you didn't sleep alone."
Though he wasn't sure if this was forced on him or that he had picked it up himself considering the boy had looked content and somewhere else with his thoughts as he had played just now.
When had the innocent snogging turned into a half make-out?
"Come on it could be wonderful," she insisted.
Harry snorted at that. "Hmm, are you daring me to say I do? Because in that case..." He stopped himself as he lingered on that sentence. Wait, no, he couldn't just go with that. Malfoy was something he had to keep his hands off.
Draco had not wanted the other to see him like this. It showed that he was weak, that he couldn't even control his own emotions. That he wasn't always the stiff, controlled Malfoy others knew him to be. It showed that he was merely human after all.
He was about to say something when his stomach decided to interrupt.
A sudden stroke of anger and bitterness hit him, raising the volume of his voice as he continued. "They left me," he cried, "those bastards left me here, running away now that they're hunted for the shit they've caused. They can't do that!"
The dinner tables in the great hall never served it, most of the students were still minors after all, but Draco had grown up drinking only the finest wines during his family dinners. It was like any other drink to him, really.
What in the world was that and why did it drive him so crazy?
"Mal," he called out as he stood up quickly.
Harry didn't really know how to respond to that, let alone had the will to do. He simply shook his head with a sigh and turned back around again - he really had to find Ron or Hermione to help him after all.
Their walk there seemed to last hours and Harry wasn't too sure if he should say something to break the silence or whether it was awkward at all. Fogged as his mind was he didn't really register everything around him. Thinking back that he had just left Ron and Hermione without notice, he squeezed Malfoy's shoulder. "We should have told them we were leaving."
Yet right now, this was their own secluded place where they didn't have to worry about any obligations or other people.
"Am I now?" He laughed. "We'll see about that."
Draco found himself at a loss of words for a moment. Fear was creeping up his spine, accompanied by worry and panic. It had indeed been blunt to ask a thing like this, he'd made a mistake. He had to fix this. "I just thought, well, it seemed like… " Where in the world was his mind? He had to get himself back together before he lost Potter's respect completely.
He was so focused on the other that he didn't even mind the tear stains on his expensive shirt. Draco would've cursed anyone for doing such a thing, but Potter...
Harry's grin grew wider. He never teased someone in a matter that excited him for their reactions this much. He had teased Ginny yet she never had quite those reactions, rather laughed a bit or brushed him off. Maybe this was why Malfoy had been going around mocking people in the old days, he could quite understand it.
He felt as if his chest was about to burst, it felt twisted and ached like hell, but in a good way.
Malfoy, however, had stopped what he was doing and didn't move. He had to be very careful now, the wrong words or no words at all could be the end of him. He couldn't keep his mouth shut for long. He carefully straightened up from his crouching position. "You've asked me this before," he answered.
Draco didn't know what he'd expected after last night. Had he expected to wake up with the Gryffindor still next to him? Maybe that was a bit of a bad assumption, seeing as he had made the other confess just before they went to sleep. It wouldn't be weird for the other to look for some privacy after that…
Draco nodded. He didn't know what else to do, so maybe they could just return to the common room, get some tea and a book… They left the great hall and started walking back to their dormitories. It was then that Pansy suddenly perked up, wearing a smirk that simply meant trouble. "Speaking of acts for the party," she began.
"Off you go mister Longbottoms. This boy needs to get taken care of, you go and take care of yourself," Madam Pomfrey said, waving the blond off. Neville gave an apologetic smile before he headed out, leaving him alone with the nurse. She stared at him and Harry found it both hard to look away and not meet her gaze. He knew he ought to have looked after himself a little better as this. Yet who could blame him? He was having fun playing outside with the snow together with his friends, too bad he caught a cold.
"I can assure you, I'm fine," Malfoy snapped coldly as he finished putting his skates on. Then he sighed and let some warmth slip back into his voice. "Thank you for caring, but I'm able to figure this out on my own for now. Potter's a delicate subject to me, for now, it's only my business." Draco got up and looked at the other, making sure they were okay again. Pansy just nodded and stepped onto the ice.
If he told him, what would they do? It wasn't like they could just start dating. That was the only thing holding him back. No one would want a Malfoy to date their hero, it'd be a terrible combination and Draco would probably put Harry into a lot of trouble with it. It was simply out of the question, no matter how bad Draco wanted it.
He was and had always been, toxic. It was almost astounding how well the Slytherin could beat himself up, how low he could think of himself while pride was one of his foremost characteristics. Pride and vanity were his armor, his way to protect himself. He must have lost them during the war because Draco had noticed they had been absent all year.
As Harry walked away, Draco got up. "THAT'S WHAT SHE SAAAID." "Oh my, Malfoy. I didn't know you knew muggle memes, how interesting~" Harry grinned, making sure he kept walking. He was wasting time with this childish behavior.
He slowly turned around to face Harry. "No idea of what..?" He asked.
Never had he thought he would feel betrayed due to the fact that his best friend wouldn't be on a date outside, in the freezing air.
"Need a description of that," he expressed his thought. Whether it would help him through the night and stop the nightmare was something he both hoped for as that he felt like it wasn't that. Yet he had no other option, now did he?
Harry could feel his cheeks heating up and his hands balled into fists as on instinct, grabbing the sheets tightly as his knuckles turned white. Why did he say that? Now he had to cover up or Malfoy would think weird of him, well if he didn't do that already.
He wanted to mock him, saying he looked a mess or something, just to get this awkward feeling off his chest, yet his breath rather got stuck in his throat.
It was however very nice to hear him say it. It lightened the Slytherin's mood a bit to know that Potter didn't loathe him for his actions. He looked at the other, suddenly feeling exhausted. That was probably due to the emotions he'd just experienced. "I guess so," he replied, referring to Harry's earlier words. What should they do now? The hug hung between them like a thick cloud, probably making them both slightly uncomfortable.
The girl frowned as if she noticed his behavior. "Well, I would suggest the library possibly to research some plants?"
It had been nice, the quiet undramatic moment just before that girl had come. He wondered if tomorrow things would be back to old. He kinda wished he didn't have to endure the next day with Draco challenging him again and the like.
A fake gasp left the black-haired boy's mouth immediately.
What in the world was Potter doing?
Thoughts rushed through his mind. Had he scared him? Had he disgusted him?
Astrology was a very mixed class. Most classes were held with just two houses, but somehow this one included all of them. It was probably due to the lack of students wanting to take this class, which meant there was often a max of 15 to 20 students attending. Draco didn't really know why. Though the lowered number of students following the course this year had dropped as well due to various reasons...
A sigh left the black-haired boy's lips as he came to a halt, turning his head to spot white locks. "Malfoy." An eyebrow was raised at the sudden contact. "So he does understand English, marvelous." The boy remarked. Irritated at the sassy remark Harry rolled his eyes and continued on his way.
Draco's eyes widened as he made a very offending noise. "You… How dense… That's not how it is at all." For Merlin's sake, where were the words when you needed them? "You think spending time with me will be fun? You're forgetting that any time we spend together is filled with arguments and curse words, I don't see that changing anytime soon, not even for an essay."
He knew very well that things would get complicated if people knew what had happened between them.
He nestled himself to fit better in the hold Malfoy had on him, his hand combing through blond locks as he allowed his fingers to curl the locks around his finger. With that, he also started to hum and nuzzle his head in Malfoy's nape, noting that his skin felt soft, just like his hair. He moved the locks aside as he pressed his lips shortly to the skin unconsciously before leaning his head against the other. Yet he didn't realize it yet, was not conscious of his actions.
What should he do? Could he just pretend it had never happened, and if so, did he want that? Did Potter want to forget about it? It had been nice, and Draco was sure they'd both gotten a healthy amount of sleep, which was great.
Draco had doubted if the other would actually stay but found himself looking for what he should say now that it was clear he would. He'd forgotten that a remark like the one he'd made required further information. He was obligated to explain himself.
"What?" Harry felt a rush of panic. Had he said something wrong to make the other feel bad? "No, no of course not. It's fine. I'm glad you can just be honest with me about that."
"Thank you for… Handling… things I guess… " He stammered.
Harry stopped staring the other way to find the other's eyes again. "Hmm, well you know about Cho Chang and Ginny. Aside from the two of them, I haven't dated anyone, though…" He frowned lightly. He was bringing the topic up again. "I do have my eye on someone, as I might have mentioned. For my future plans, well, honestly I'm not all that sure. But I guess I want to try and be an Auror?"
"It's what friends are for," he added.
He stopped. Maybe he shouldn't have said that. Maybe it had sounded way too heavy and dramatic. Maybe he was too obsessed with trying to apologize and maybe he should leave the war for what it was. It was all he could ever talk about lately and that had probably gotten annoying by now.
As much as he liked making out with the other, it was beginning to feel like that still wasn't enough.

Father: James Potter
Mother: Lily Potter
Core: Dark
Hadrian’s POV, again:
Hadrian’s POV:
Hadrian’s POV:
Tom: (Sees me) Nope! Not dealing with you today
Hadrian was still trying to wrap his head around the information his father told him. “My Father was never the true dark lord and Mother never truly hated me. They were forced by the pain they felt when they lost me and my sister. Dumbledore is the real evil, and he wants my entire family dead.” That thought spun around in his mind many times, popping up whenever he tried to think of something else. Valorie, Remy, and the others looked just as shocked as he felt. They were rubbing their heads anxiously, processing the truth. No one spoke for a couple minutes, the silence deafening. Valorie started to pace frivolously in circles. When she did stop, she turned and punched a wall. “Are you ok over there?” Draco said sarcastically. “You could have broken your hand, Valorie.” Valorie walked up to him, glaring daggers from his comment. “Val,” Hadrian called over to her. She looked up at her brother and saw him shaking his head. The look in his eyes made her back away. Valorie now knew the power he possessed was strong and did not want to provoke him more. She sat back down, collecting herself. Hadrian looked to his father, who pretended to read more of his tome. No one was going to ask the first question, so Hadrian decided to step up. “Father, what’s going to happen now? How are we going to defend ourselves against Dumbledore if he attacks?” His father looked at him with alarm in his eyes. “I never wanted to teach you such skills under these circumstances, but you and your family need to be prepared for the coming battle. I’ll teach you spells that are not taught at the school,” he told his son. Elaina chimed in, eager to help her nephew. “And I’ll teach you your vampire skills with your mother.” Hadrian turned to Remy, Valorie, and Draco, worried about their wellbeing too. “What about you?” he asked them. “I’ll teach them everything they need to know,” Remus stepped in. “After all, I was a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. With proper training, they will be able to stand against even the most powerful wizards.” Hadrian looked at everyone, surprised that they were willing to stand up against a powerful wizard who manipulated most of the magic community. He smiled confidently, certain that they were going to succeed. “So, when do we start?” Hadrian asked his father. “Tomorrow, at dawn. You will be assigned your tasks for the day and have to follow exactly what we tell you. There is no room for error during a fight. For, now all of you should get some sleep. All of us had an exhausting day.” Severus appeared next to Tom, waiting in the shadow he warped from. Tom noticed his husband in the corner of his eye and turned to him, smiling slyly. “Sneaking up on me, Dark Angel? You know you cannot startle me.” Severus grinned weakly at Tom. He swayed in his few steps toward him and fainted in his arms. “Severus!” his husband screamed. Tom cradled him in his arms, holding him close. The twins rushed to their mother’s side, concerned about his fainting spell. Their father told them to back up and give them both some space. Tom looked at Severus with love and fear in his eyes. He put his head down on Severus’s chest, waiting to hear the two sounds that made sure he was ok. Tom heard his soft breaths that were indicated by the rise and fall of his chest; he also heard his heartbeat, rhythmically thumping against his ribcage. Tears streaked down Tom’s face, saddened that his husband was unwell. “Oh, Angel. You shouldn’t be shadow traveling in your current condition. You could hurt yourself and our baby,” he whispered. Tom scooped Severus into his arms and tried to regain his balance on his feet. “I have to take Severus back to bed. The rest of you should go to sleep. You’ll have a long day tomorrow. I will see you all in the morning. Good night,” he said to the others. Tom trailed to his room and the others followed suit. The road ahead was going to be long and tedious for all of them, so they prepared for their last peaceful night before the coming storm.
Draco smiled a little as he looked around his house's table, seeing the bright faces of the first years that were just sorted. It was always something he enjoyed watching, though he wouldn’t let anyone know that. He loved seeing how they looked around at everything in awe. And more recently he realized that he loved seeing the muggle-born first years especially. They had never seen magic before and he loved to see the pure wonder and astonishment on their faces. The same look he’d seen on Potter’s face many years prior.
“Shut up, Longbottom.” Draco mumbled, flushing pink. “You’ll be with Seamus and Dean most of the time, I presume?”
"I only use a couple now. No worries." Draco's voice sounded dainty compared to how deep Potter's had gotten.
Harry took the lead again and pulled Draco through the crowd and over to the table Hermione and Ron were at. “Hey, guys.” Harry greeted as the two sat down, hands being dropped.
Potter grinned, taking his hand and shaking it. “Well you can call me Harry then I suppose.” He dropped the hand but his smile stayed as he closed the suitcase. “It’s nice, seeing this side of you, Draco. Excuse me.”
Draco hummed happily to himself as he exited Scrivenshaft’s, carrying a small bag with his items. He looked around, seeing a bunch of students walking but no Harry. He thought back to what Neville had said the day before and headed towards Honeydukes.
He pulled out his wand and cast his Patronus charm, something he'd practised a lot over the summer. It was a hummingbird, small and quick, and reminded him of his role as seeker. He didn't have many happy memories but the one he always thought of was his first time on the train, first year. He'd finally be away from his family and be able to learn new things, he'd especially been excited about potions. Despite how hard things had gotten, he'd always loved his studies. He and Granger had that in common.
“Yeah, yeah, Malfoy.” Harry grumbled. He was not a morning person.
Once dinner ended, Draco stayed behind a few minutes and waited for a majority of the students to go ahead of him. Many people had been giving him dirty looks and though he deserved it, it still hurt. He had this year to prove he wasn't actually like that anymore. He was no longer the spoiled brat that was rude to everyone different than him, that had just been a cover that he had to use for his own safety. His father was now in Azkaban and Voldemort was dead. He was finally able to be himself.
The door’s bell jingled as he stepped inside, alerting Ambrosius of a new customer. Draco grinned, seeing Harry sneak a small piece of fudge into his mouth. “Still got that sweet tooth, Potter?”
The trio looked at him as he approached them, Harry going a bit red from being caught. “I don’t understand how he doesn’t have any cavities, he eats sweets like he needs them to live.” Hermione told him.
Draco couldn't help his heart fluttering at the tone used. "Things have changed, we've changed, Potter." Draco stood, holding out his hand. “Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” He recited the words he’d said to the boy that first year. “Though I’d prefer you to call me Draco.”
Neville’s eyes snapped up. “My lips are sealed if yours are.”
Pretty soon a month had passed with no incidents and they were coming up on their Hogsmeade trip. The air was buzzing with excitement as it usually was for these trips. The third years were ecstatic, this was this first year going. The eighth years though, they were equally excited. They were eager to go, wanting to experience something simple and happy again. This was one of the last trips they’d have together as a class.
Harry came out about ten minutes later. He was shirtless and had on grey plaid pyjama pants, slippers on his feet. Draco couldn’t help but stare, the man was fit. He had a decent set of abs on him and his arm muscles were just perfect. His chest was full of dark hair and he had a trail of it heading downwards. He’d always liked the boy but damn, he looked better now than ever before.
“I don’t know what you mean, Pans.” He brushed it off. His eyes darted over to the empty seat beside her and the two next to him. Blaise had gone to another school and Goyle stayed home to finish his schooling. And Crabbe… well he was gone, another tragedy of the war they’d been forced to cope with. Draco never saw him as a real friend, being the stubborn brat that he had been. But now he missed the poor fool quite a lot, the quietness bothering him in a way he never thought it would.
The blonde smiled and headed into the bathroom. He quickly changed, having picked out a cute outfit. He was wearing ripped skinny jeans, as the muggles called them, with fishnets underneath. Paired with a plain white t-shirt and a green flannel. He opened one of the bathroom drawers and pulled out some of the jewellery he had brought. He’d gotten magically pierced over the summer so he could go without jewellery in for however long he wanted without it closing. He put in his septum ring and snake bites, the names sounded funny to him but that’s what he’d been told they were called. Reaching into the drawer, he pulled out eyeliner and put it in his waterline, making his grey eyes pop more. After making sure his hair was somewhat presentable, he exited. “You can have it back now if you need anything else, Harry.” He sat on his bed and put on socks, then the black boots he’d brought along. “Harry?” He asked as he looked up, having not heard a response. He blushed quickly when he realized that the Gryffindor was staring at him. “What, is there something on me?”
“I love you too, Draco.” Harry trailed his hands down some, slipping a finger into the waist of Draco’s pants. “Do you want to-”
“We already ordered for us and you, Harry. Draco, what would you like? I can go add it to our tab.” Hermione asked sweetly.
“Wh- Oh… shut up, Ron.” Harry mumbled, holding up the fabric of his hoodie to cover his neck.
“Told you they liked each other, Ron. You owe me ten galleons now.” The girl said smugly, sipping on her tea. “Draco, you really did a number on him, huh?”
Harry set the bags on his own bed and walked over to Draco’s, sitting down next to him. “We're back on last name basis now? Would you like to explain why?”
“Dray, no it’s not. And hey, did you get my gift?”
Draco chuckled and moved closer to Harry, leaning on him as he looked around the room. Neville suddenly walked in, equally covered in marks and getting Draco's attention. The boy walked over to one of the tables, sitting in between Seamus and Dean. Draco noticed Pansy and Lavender sitting close as well. All were in a similar state as Harry and him. He smiled knowingly and snuggled further into his boyfriend’s side, glad they were all going to be happy.
Harry set down the dye and started running his fingers through Draco’s hair, making sure he got all of the strands. “Do you miss him?”
Harry reached over and pushed his fingers into Draco’s blonde hair. He’d cut it a while ago but now it came down to the bottom of his ears. “You should dye your hair before class starts.”
“G’night, Harry.” Draco whispered against his partner's chest, eyes closing.
"Just wanted to say that I'm sorry about Sirius and Tonks. We all know you guys weren't close but they were still your family." Dean, who was resting against his boyfriend, nodded along to what was said.
“Don’t be silly, Draco.” Harry insisted. “Hello, Minerva.”
"I- fuck." Draco lost his composure quickly and he knew his eyes were watering as he spoke. "I just wanted to apologize for everything I've done over the years. I know it doesn't change how I made you all feel but um… that wasn't who I wanted to be. I did what I felt like I had to do and eventually, I actually did need to behave that way or I would put myself in more danger." He thought about what Seamus had said to him and looked directly at Ron. "Ronald, I'm very sorry to hear about your brother's passing and I hope your family is doing well. Fred was a good man."
“Whatever you say, Harry. Ron and I are going to The Three Broomsticks, meet us there in a bit. Let’s go, Ronald.” The couple waved goodbye to Draco, leaving the two boys alone.
“Yes, love?” The brunette asked.
“Oh, dear, we don’t need to talk about that now. Go, have fun. I’ll call you to my office sometime soon, alright?” McGonagall laughed. “Nice to see you two getting along.”
The Gryffindor chuckled as he wiped his mouth, ridding it of saliva. “Why’d we stop, angel?”
Harry stretched and got up, heading over to his side of the room and dressing. He put on joggers and a hoodie, grabbing his slippers as well. The floors were always freezing. He left the room and quietly entered the common area, seeing most of the student’s there as they always were on Sundays. “Hey.” He greeted Hermione and Ron as he sat down next to Draco on one of the couches.
Draco pulled off with a pop and started trailing down further, running his tongue down Harry’s thighs and licking over his hole, watching him tense. “You’ve never shagged a bloke, have you?”’
Draco chuckled. "Well, you're a nice couple. Goodnight, guys." He said, standing.
“Told us what, Nev?” Dean asked.
"Of course, Pans. Have fun." Draco mumbled to the girl, grimacing as she pressed a kiss to his cheek before taking off. He loved the girl but he was not a very affectionate guy, at least with friends.
“I- Draco,” Harry whined, feeling his cheeks flush. He leaned down again and connected their mouths in a short kiss, Draco making a sweet sound at it. “Stop being cute.”
“Make me.” Harry chuckled lowly, grabbing onto Draco’s hips and thrusting hard into him, finding his prostate again and ramming into it repeatedly.
Draco laughed. “Love you too, Harry.”
He started walking back to his table but got stuck as a bunch of people were leaving. He just stood there, rolling his eyes as he waited for people to get out of the way. Once he was finally moving he spotted Harry, smiling to himself. It quickly turned into a frown as Hannah Abbott sat down in his seat. He stopped walking, watching what happened. Hannah placed her hand on Harry’s arm and a surge of jealousy ran through him. Then she was kissing him and he didn’t bother to stick around any longer, didn’t even bother to grab his bag. He just left, swiftly walking out of the pub and into the cool autumn air. He just walked and walked and walked, eventually arriving at his room. He went inside and shut the door, letting a few tears finally slip down his cheeks.
The door jingled again and distracted them. Harry moved away, blushing, then walked to the other side of the store as Draco followed. “What are you getting now?”
Harry grinned at his fiance. He absolutely adored the man, as well as the way he thought and spoke. “That sounds beautiful, sweetheart. I think I’d like something like that as well. Have you thought about that a lot?”
“Just about to head to the pub to meet Hermione and Ron, miss. How’s the role of headmaster been?”
Neville didn’t even need to think before he answered. “Zonko’s. I need to find something to get Seamus back for cheating off of me the other day. I’ve been telling him I’ll help him study, he’s never going to get anywhere with his current way of going about things.”
Harry leaned down and pressed their mouths together as he started thrusting his hips, moving in different ways to try to find the blonde’s prostate. He knew he found it when Draco let out a loud whimper. “You’re beautiful.”
He eventually stood and Pansy joined him, the pair walking arm and arm towards the dorm the eighth years would be staying in. "Who do you think you'll be paired with? I'd be fine with most of the girls really, except Granger. Still feel awful about what happened to her at your manor and I don't think she'd be very happy with us being paired."
"Someone read off the roommate list." Ernest Macmillan shouted once the entrance closed.
“We’re not gonna see each other as much with NEWTS coming up. And you’ll be helping with quidditch again.” Harry muttered, gazing at his partner's face. His eyes traced over the freckles that dusted his cheeks and nose, noting that two of them formed a heart-like shape.
Harry pulled him into another kiss, much gentler this time, before pulling away again. “You sure you’re alright, Dray?”
Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s neck. “I’ve wanted you since first year. I’m so sorry I was such a prat.”
Draco grimaced as the first bit of dye touched his hair. It was cold and he didn’t necessarily like the feeling. But on the other hand, Harry touching his hair was a very nice feeling. “Harry?”
“Watch your mouth, love.”
Ron held in a laugh, earning a look from Harry. “Mate, did you get into a fight with a bear last night?”
“Definitely not anything like traditional muggle weddings. I’ll show you some pictures later but just know that they’re very bland. I hate them. And not ranch style.” Harry told him as he finished up the roots of his hair. “You?”
Draco quickly cast a drying spell and colour preserving charms on his hair before walking over to the mirror. It was nice, a dark green that complimented his eyes just like Harry had said it would. He smiled a little and walked out into their room, seeing Harry on their bed. After they’d gotten together, they’d requested a single queen-sized bed instead of the two full-sized ones that were in their room before. “Finished.” He announced as he plopped onto the bed next to Harry.
His head snapped up when the door opened, a concerned looking Harry walking inside. “Dray, why’d you leave? You had us all worried.”
The door opened suddenly and Potter stepped inside, surprised when the Patronus zipped past him before disappearing. "Hummingbird." He mused, looking over at the blonde. "Fitting."
Draco shook his head, it couldn’t be. It must’ve just been a coincidence. A stupid, poorly timed coincidence. He sighed and placed the broom under his bed so it didn’t get damaged. He ran his hand through his hair, pulling at the strands to ground himself. He didn’t have a reason to be upset, not like Potter was his or anything. He should be happy for him, he deserved a nice girl like Abbott.
The trio, Seamus and Dean, Daphne, Lavender, Pansy, and Draco all stayed. The trio took a seat at a table, the girls sat at another, and Seamus and Dean sat on a couch next to the chair Draco was in. "Hey, Malfoy?" Seamus called, making Draco nervous about what he might say.
“Just came to say hi. How’s it going with you all?” He asked as he sat down.
Draco giggled and took his hand back, playing with the ring. It was a beautiful silver band with three diamonds in it. He made a ‘tsk’ sound as he thought about the price, which he’d scolded Harry for when he first found out. “Well
“What was that?” She asked again, not hearing him.
