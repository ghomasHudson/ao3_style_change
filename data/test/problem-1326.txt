“More like an absolute bollocksing up”
I am getting tired of watching.
“Here. At Hogwarts” Harry said gruffly, eyes still trained on the forest. He was silent for a few long moments and Hermione let him gather up the courage to finish the story. “There were…. extenuating circumstances around my death. The way it happened, it would have probably meant I could have survived. When I died I went to this heaven sort of place” He finally looked at her again to see if she was following “I guess it was a sort of purgatory or waiting room, I don’t now. I’ve been looking up a lot of afterlife theories in the library all year but I’m still not certain. It looked like kings cross station, but empty and stark white. And I knew somehow that if I wanted to I could just….go back” Harry’s hands were twisting in his lap and Hermione desperately wished she was close enough to reach out and hold his hand “I knew I had to go back to you all and so that’s what I did. What I tried to do, anyway”
“Now don’t freak out—” Hermione began, as if approaching a spooked horse.
“You can’t save everyone.” Ron said, with more bluntness than intended. Harry looked at him with startled bright eyes. “I mean, no one can save everyone. Most people can’t save anyone at all. Not ever. What you’ve done already Harry- we don’t know where we’ll end up, but I do know from what you’ve told me that you’ve gifted people lives they never could have had before. You’ve saved people.”
Harry had a skip in his step. Hermione had noticed that the boy, despite his exuberance and joy in seemingly all mundane aspects of Hogwarts life, seemed often weighed down by something. It must have been the knowledge of the murderer he kept under his bed. Alleged murderer, anyway. Hermione and Harry had been assured by an embarrassed ministry official that there would be an extensive- and he’d emphasised
She was going to die prematurely at age ten from pure excitement, she just knew it.
Her Slytherin girlfriend Kassandra (in charge of the Layout) stood slightly behind her grinning and handing out copies to slightly intimidated students. But there actually seemed to be a lot of interest in the paper which made Luna unreasonably joyful for a project Harry had practically shanghaied her into.
Luna shrugged “Not this year” Usually she and her father would spend the Christmas hols in various locations, searching for crumple-horned Snorcacks. Last year they’d spent a lovely if unfruitful fortnight in Iceland “Dad’s taken some freelance work in Afghanistan for Magical Creatures Monthly, so I’m staying at Hogwarts”
He often said things like that. Like he’d known her for years instead of a fortnight. Harry looked to the ceiling as if asking for answers from some cruel god. Then he let out a tremendous groan.
So that was how the movie club started. Luna liked it. She liked the scary ones especially- though on Halloween instead of a scary movie they’d watched a strange movie about singing transvestite aliens in lingerie. This had inspired Fred and George to paste an A1 poster of Snape dressed in a Frank N Furter costume outside the great hall. It had been disturbing but very well drawn, Luna had thought.
Harry and Hermione looked at her as if they’d just been caught mutilating a dead body, instead of standing over her school cauldron. Hermione had a hand behind her back and Ginny frowned at it intently.
She shrugged, crossing her legs up onto her chair and leaning forward. “It is when you refuse to ever tell the truth”
Harry shifted awkwardly, fiddling with the prefect pin on his robes. He’d tried not wearing it for he first few weeks, until McGonagall yelled at him. Now it was something he often fiddled with, and always took off as soon as he could. It was as if the badge was a virus Harry’s body was violently rejecting. “I do. I’m sorry.”
Draco seemed confused, and she knew he wouldn’t understand until she showed him. She slipped the record out of its cover gently, wary even if she knew they were only replicas of her mother’s collection. She placed the record down, adjusted the needle and then turned the player on. It crackled familiarly for a few moments, then it cleared, and the first guitar chords sounded.
“Oh, come on” Hermione said “It’s cute! They were apart for ten years”
“Who’s Seamus taking?” Ron said, alarmed at how quickly his friends had moved.
“You were enemies with Draco?” Ron repeated with disbelief. “I don’t see it.”
Harry squeezed her hand, telling her everything was okay. He waited for her words to come with the understanding patience of someone who knew the pain of loosing one’s mother. The person who brought you into the world lost to your world forever.
“Yeah, well” Harry said, sounding just to the right of bitter “I’m available, I guess”
“What? Oh. Nothing. I didn’t say anything.” He said hurriedly, tripping over his words.
He turned his head and looked at her. They were mirrored then, knees tucked up and feet tangled, heads resting on the cool window.
“He did,” Neville croaked darkly. Despite their early, er,
“It isn’t your fault.” Ron said fiercely, wishing he could somehow protect Harry from the world. Keep him buried somewhere safe until the sun came out. “None of this is your fault.”
“How are you going to get her out?” Neville asked.
“If Fudge doesn’t get re-elected on Thursday, I promise I’ll eat my hat” Ginny said heatedly, before realising that she’d accidentally stumbled into talking about politics. She changed the subject.
Harry shifted ever so slightly, looking nervous “What—?” He began.
Malfoy stared at her, slightly alarmed, while Harry let out a baffled laugh and Ron a strangled sound of surprise.
So, Harry had called the first meeting of the DA and opened the floor to a discussion about where to go from there. The whole group, from Seventh year to the new firsties, had been reluctant to disband the group which had become many of their favourite part of the week. Luna herself would be upset to see the group go- she was close to Ginny because of their history but the rest of the Gryffindor group (and Draco) had only become her friend through the weekly meetings.
“Because you are so hiding something!” Ginny cried, just this side of petulant “You were sneaking around my room and I know you took something—” Harry winced “and you and Hermione are always sneaking about and coming back at odd times and whispering at each other! And I found Hermione’s notebook”
Neville wondered if the enchanted student body was intended to kill Harry. Then he thought how surreal it must be to be Harry Potter, with people caring about your existence enough to try and end it. “This is crazy,” Neville muttered.
“He’s keeping a close eye on me.” Harry explained snidely when he was twenty minutes late to a meeting for The Plan. “I swear he’s trailing me.”
“Why are they all so beautiful?” Hermione muttered under her breathe, eyes wide as she watched the Beauxbatons students stream past into the entrance hall, huddled together as if it was mid-winter rather than a balmy autumn night. “Is it, like, a requirement for their education?”
“Here?!” Ron exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air. “Harry you’ve gone absolutely barmy, you have.”
“Ginny” A voice called her out of her stupor, and she realised suddenly that the kitchen was no longer invaded by strangers. Her mum sounded bemused as she said “Ginny you can come out from under the table now”
“I didn’t think they would be that sensitive” Draco snapped, attempting to give a full body flounce of dismay before wincing and gingerly cradling his arm.
They’d been ice-skating at a local lake which always froze over (though this claim, which was plastered across the lakes picturesque advertisements, always prompted a rant about the coming effects of global warming from Hermione) and had made cookies and had watched every Christmas film under the sun. They had also consumed far, far too much hot chocolate. Christmas was the only time of year that the Grangers let refined sugar into their household.
“Um. Do you have any information about the cost and distributor information for Wolfsbane potion?” Harry asked, the whole question coming out in a garbled rush. Both Snape and Hermione blinked at Harry slowly in disbelief. If Hermione had had any predictions at all for where this was going, she certainly wouldn’t have said here. She made a mental note to add this to her
They’re research was slightly hindered by their lack of access to dark magic books. There only seemed to be a handful in the restricted section and there was only so many times they could sneak in under the invisibility cloak to steal them before they had more restricted books in their possession than on the actual shelves.
“How long does it take to learn,” Hermione said with interest.
Harry shook his head, “Draco asked her. We did it together so that they could both come. Neville’s going with Parvati and Dean has asked Lavender but I don’t think she’s said yes yet.”
The news had been broken by a lower ministry worker, who had been allowed to leave with the intention that he would spread the gospel. Voldemort had walked into the ministry and his only obstacle had been an underpaid man with a mop who had died easily. Voldemort had control of the ministry, and by default he had control of magical Britain.
“I’ll have to go in, too.” Percy said, his usually pompous tone significantly dulled. “Help out Mr Crouch with….” He winced visibly, “Everything.”
An empty room. Had they even been in here? Or was this just an old storage room, locked in past times and forgotten?
They didn’t end up going too far from the ugly house, but instead simply finished the walk into the village and stopping in the church graveyard. The village was sleepy, and the lanes were mostly deserted. An old man they passed gave Ginny’s attire and muddy appearance a dubious look.
“It isn’t Wednesday” Draco points out needlessly. Luna just smiles at him.
“Are you…okay?” She said, and then it all came out of her in an unstoppable Hermione-style Ramble. “It’s just, I saw you appear on the platform. And I’m sure that’s normal, for magically imbued folk or whatever, its just you looked shocked, and so I thought maybe it was an accidental appearing, or that you’d appeared somewhere wrong. But you do look like someone heading to Hogwarts, I thought with your clothes you must have muggle parents but then you said merlin so I thought, of course, magical accident. Because wizards must have accidents too, right? Like high speed broom collisions and accidental tax avoidance and magicking yourself into tight corners. That must be it, right? A magical accident.”
_______________________
“When are they not being weird?” Draco said with a dramatic sigh. He’s laid on the bottom bunk of one of the camp-beds, decked out in full Bulgarian regalia and looking rather mardy about it.
“You look—” He croaked out.
“Nothing happened in first year.” Hermione said unconvincingly, her voice two octaves higher than usual.
“Some Hufflepuff girl in the year above.”
Professor Lupin seemed to shrink in age under his boyfriend’s joyful gaze, he grinned back, eyes sparkling. Harry looked at them both with un-masked affection and happiness. It was a sight almost too much to take in. Luna fought the immediate reaction to think about purple smoke and cry about her own lost and incomplete family.
Neville was silent for a long moment. He wondered how Harry knew. Had he read about it in one of the books about the war? The incident was often referred to as the last event of the Wizarding War. Or had he looked it up in the Newspaper archives contained in the Library? It did seem like something Harry would do. Unable as he was to let anything go.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Something like that. But he needs these objects, so we need to destroy them.”
“Hope your dad’s not too mad.” Hermione said with genuine concern.
He walked down the transfiguration corridor happily, swinging his arms lazily. He’d done all of his schoolwork and was frankly looking forward to doing absolutely nothing at all for the evening. Before, he was sure, they were assigned a mountain of holiday homework the next day. Merlin, OWLS year was exhausting. The pep in his step began to drain slightly as he thought about it. He knew he would surely fail at least one of them. Potions? Transfiguration? Both? He’d fail and then his grandmother would look down from heaven and really, really hate him. He thought of his parents’ results, which his grandmother had kept framed and hung up in the conservatory so she could look at them with pride on sunny afternoons. Straight O’s. A single, lonely E for his mother’s divination.
Harry frowned, “We’re what?”
Ginny paused in her reading, she had tears brimming in her eyes. The rest of them were deadly silent to, a mirage of stillness in the sudden heat.
It was close to seven in the evening now, the sun just beginning to sink in the sky. Harry and Neville had returned from the Chamber of Secrets in awkward silence, the only noise coming from Harry’s hissed Parseltongue and Neville’s squeaky soles, damp from the chamber.
“Shit” Ginny muttered, and Hermione looked at her sideways slightly scandalised. Ginny couldn’t help but giggle.
Harry watched it intently for a moment. “Look,” He gestured for Neville to come closer. Neville watched the map with curiosity—outside of where they were, marked with two dots in a closed off cul-de-sac, was a great crowd of students, filling up the hallway outside and spilling out across the near by ones as well. The rest of the school was practically empty, with only a single dot or groups of two scattered around the castle. They had completely barricaded them in.
Ron was looking at him oddly now. “Seriously Harry, how is it that you know all this weird stuff?”
Anyway, usually it’s just her and mum in the house so there wouldn’t be anything to eavesdrop on. It’s been weird ever since Hogwarts got out in June. Suddenly there are all these people around the house. And sure, they
Draco gave him the look you give all sane people when they’ve done categorically insane thinks. “Right.”
“I have to.” Harry said his voice desperate.
Ron noticed Harry blush happily at the phrase ‘our kid’. Ron also knew that Remus sometimes worked at an odd antique bookshop in Soho, but that the owner was oddly understanding of Remus leaving at regular intervals to search odd corners of Eurasia.
Draco seemed poised to say something at first but held his tongue. As the first side of the record played out he relaxed too, and closed his eyes, a soft smile swimming about his lips. She watched the sky of his face clear and become just as blue as the album they were listening to.
“Hermione” Harry said, waving his hands at Hermione “Put it down. We have to cast the spells first”
But Hermione, Harry, Draco and Ron had formed an easy, if often jovially combative, quartet. Harry seemed to be already attuned to all of Hermione and Ron’s quirks and demeanours, and well versed in how to handle them. He often seem baffled by Draco’s very presence though, despite being the one who had initially introduced them all. Any time that the Ravenclaw boy would make a joke that made Harry laugh, or go an extended period without making a snide comment about Hermione’s heritage or Ron’s family, Harry seemed to have an internal crisis. Hermione had noticed that Harry tended to periodically find the closest rain-soaked window to stare dramatically and stoically out of and this always increased anytime he seemed befuddled by something. She attributed this to him being a boy, and therefore inept at handling his own emotions.
Sometimes the lines converge. I find myself witnessing the ending to stories I have already seen play through. We have crossed a wire somewhere. We have followed half faded footsteps and found ourselves exactly as we were before. It doesn't matter. This boy dies with the same fresh pain every time.
Dumbledore gave a small sound which could almost be classed as a scoff if it wasn’t coming from their fastidiously benign headmaster. “Harry, there are things you must know.”
“You hear?” Neville asked, even though he was certain Harry had. Harry nodded, then spoke because Neville had kept staring resolutely forward.
Hermione rolls her eyes, “Only because no one’s crazy enough to look at the confusion of Harry Potter and conclude ‘time travel’ as a logical solution.”
Ginny thought, but out loud she said, “It speaks to you?”
Christmas break started odd and got stranger from there.
“Where are you going?” Hermione said with interest.
It read:
“Whatever it is, I’m coming with you” Ginny says, sharply. She’s already pulling her hair bag into a ponytail with the bobble on her wrist. If Harry’s involved, she’s sure there’s going to be an obnoxious amount of running.
“You. Are. Fucking. With. Me.” Ron says, holding four glittering galleons up to the hanging camping lantern.
“Yeah,” He said, “And he’s right about your cartoon. I laughed for a good twenty minutes.”
“How did you tell Hermione?” Ron asked, all the cruel accusation gone from his voice.
They were breaking into a bank it seemed.
In hot pursuit, Hermione had caught the Portrait door before it could swing shut and climbed out after him.
Harry hugged Molly back fiercely, like he was greeting his own mother. Molly looked faintly surprised, but patted him gently on the back of the head nonetheless. “Are Remus and Sirius feeding you well? You seem skinny”
“Come on,” Harry said, stuffing his essay into his bag without delicacy. “Let’s go somewhere quieter.”
“Wish I could enter,” Ron said wistfully, because one thousand galleons was a lot of Brand New Things and getting things new was a rare occurrence in Ron’s life. “It doesn’t seem hard.”
Neville had made his way out to the lake only half an hour earlier. Most people were out by the lake. The castle was a furnace, and the heat spilled out onto the grounds as well. It must have been more than thirty degrees. People had abandoned their robes for summer dresses and shorts. Ice lollies had been brought by the hundreds from the house-elves.
“You and I both know that the burden of proof lies with the accuser, not the accused” Harry said, momentarily distracted.
“What?” Ginny exclaimed, shocked. It was true that Ginny couldn’t picture Luna in Gryffindor, couldn’t really picture ineffable, indescribable
“You said ‘Sirius Black, there’s no one else on earth I want to spend the rest of my days with-‘ “
There was no better description for it than a
“Oi. I’ve kept it a secret, haven’t I?” Harry said, insulted,
weird,” She said, unable to stop herself. “Now. What the hell is going on and why is that box
Tonks didn’t seem offended, just shrugged magnanimously. “I qualified as an Auror two years ago. Been under Mad-Eyes tutelage that whole time.”
“Sure” Harry answered ambivalently “She mainly just likes to inform me of the quality of the rats. It’s not like we can talk about the weather”
“I want to be involved,” Neville said, calmly.
Hermione stopped at the door of an abandoned classroom “I suppose this would be poetic.” She said, smiling tightly ta Harry. She looked at Ron, “This was where Harry told me.”
“Save them for something special.” Harry said.
She couldn’t hear what Hermione was saying, only heard the odd word here and there when the bustling of the house elves ebbed or when Hermione seemed to get particularly passionate. She heard
“No” Ginny said blithely “I snooped in their room and found it written down. Then I tested it out and started using it myself”
Harry was quick, moving into the vault and picking up the small yellow cup from a high shelf at the back of the room.
She turned around immediately and left before Harry Potter could drive her clinically insane at the tender age of twelve.
The wedding was beginning to wrap up when Neville found himself sitting next to a forlorn looking best woman. Tonks was dressed in a suit, too, and had morphed her hair into the classic Black family raven curls. Though she did keep the ends bubble-gum pink.
It baffled her constantly that there were actually people in the world who willingly wanted to do all those things with her.
“I have not heard a thing,” Fleur said bitterly, looking at her fireplace with a deep frown, “I have floo’d and sent letters- Nothing. I cannot get through to, to a
They’d simply been taking a couple hours to relax with her dads trusty Christmas songs mixtape on in the back ground. Hermione was reading, Ron was eating and Harry, apparently, was
seen you willingly interact with Percy.”
“People shouldn’t do that,” Harry said, frowning.
Hermione and Ginny only took a few days of this before they were ushering the others out. Fred and George tasked first in trying to apparate them to muggle London.
“Potter.” Snape had said, lips barely parted and voice teeming with suppressed anger. “Detention.”
“Will the wards go off?” Hermione asked Harry curiously.
Ron and Harry were behind them, because they’d been left to pull the cart quickly off of the tracks and into the side shadows of the cavern they’d all stepped into. The Goblin inside had been imperiused, something Harry apparently knew how to do, and forced to follow along behind them.
“What’s happened?” harry had demanded, but Ron had looked past him to a nervous looking Neville who was half up from his lounging position.
Hermione rolled her eyes, “You’re terrible at this.” She said with disbelief. “Harry died at the end of our seventh year, then he came back. To the first day of our first year. He’s living it all again.”
“That’s not true” Ginny said weakly but thought of her brothers calling her Loony behind her back.
—” he bumped into Harry’s back, his face smacking into Harry’s mop of hair. Harry had stopped dead after turning a corner.
Ginny shivered. Then she heard it. A rasping, cavernous slither. The sound of giant scales scrapping against wet stone pipes. She clutched Harry’s hand tighter.
“That’s what we think, too. They’ve increased muggle security in most European cities but—” Remus was cut off.
On the first day back of her second year she placed it once again on the wall, next to a print of
“So, what?” Ginny said, apprehensive. She became even more apprehensive when Hermione unceremoniously pulled out a shovel from her bag.
“Voldemort’s immortal?” Neville asked, distraught at the thought
“Someone who’s only important tertiarily, and for nefarious deeds” Harry quipped.
“Dumbledore is saying they hope to take it back before anyone is hurt. The Minister.” Fleur’s face crumpled “She is almost certainly dead.”
“I—" Harry began.
Remus laughed, rapping his knuckles against the doorjamb. “Bye, Draco. And you two, be downstairs in twenty.”
“Hello” She said, voice timid with her nerves.
“Maybe we should have told him a while ago.” Hermione said critically.
When Harry came to the end of his magazine, he closed it wearily and finally gave Draco his full attention. Draco soaked it up greedily while trying to pretend he wasn’t.
“I’m not a bad person” Draco implored, sounding desperate. Luna wondered who he was trying to convince.
The Rabbit dissolved and they all stared at where it had been for a single moment. Then Sirius let out a string of expletives and kicked the first stone step.
“He contains multitudes” Hermione said drily, and Harry grinned at her.
Neville could feel an uncertain chill settling over their world, turning bright things insular and colourless.
She’d sort of just tagged along to be Harry’s morale support when the headmaster calmly broke to the boy that he was obviously insane and would need to be taken to the nearest wizarding psychiatric facility as soon as possible.
“My mum made me bring a whole packet, to share. ” Hermione explained. Then cursed herself when she realised she hadn’t said that ‘Witchily’ at all, “Um, forsooth.” she added, but it came out more like a question.
“Luna there isn’t—”
Being the youngest boy of six was a difficult burden to bear. Being the youngest boy of six and not eve getting the condolence of being the actual youngest was just cruelty.
Harry shook his head, but the pursed his lips in frustration “Well, sort of. It’s like..” He sighed, heavily “It’s not like Back to the Future time travel”
“Hermione only found out because she wouldn’t let it go.” Harry shrugged.
Ginny felt the consequences of not taking the winter break to sleep in their first week back. On that Thursday Ginny found herself nodding off while trying to copy her Transfiguration notes into a neater semblance of order. The world blinked in and out, flickering between the red-pink abyss of the inside of her eyelids and the yellowed page of her scrawled notes, the gaps between prying her eyelids apart growing longer and longer. The next thing she knew, the angle of the world had changed, and she was waking up to an almost pitch-black common room. The only light was in the dying embers of the fire. Ginny was lying on her side on the over-stuffed sofa. The room was empty.
“And the power you have?” Dumbledore asked.
“It’s passed curfew.” Ron said, though he too began to pack his things.
Colin had stopped with Luna, too. He was holding his camera up to take a picture of Luna. “Colin! Why are you taking a picture of
Harry laughed loudly as he came to the end of the letter, but when he passed it on to Neville, Neville couldn’t see what was so funny.
Harry’s face did an odd thing; half a smile and half a grimace. “Yep. Cool. Hope he can make it” Ginny couldn’t tell if he meant it or not.
“Yep.” Harry said, popping the p and being altogether far to happy with himself. “Like if you really needed the bathroom it would become a toilet. Or a place to hide from Filch.”
He would sneak out, of course. To see the boys and to see Hermione. He was clutching a teary Hermione’s hand right then, hands squished between them. Ron wouldn’t leave his friends alone in their fear and their grief.
He couldn’t comprehend it. That war had taken over the sleepy, provincial routine of their world without them noticing at all. Now it was shocking them starkly awake.
The lower vaults were built like rows of verandas, all looking over into a cavern in the middle. A cavern containing a screeching dragon.
“I know” Luna said, confused. “Why would you hate muggles?”
Ginny didn’t say anymore. That was why Neville liked her so much.
“Nothing” Harry said unconvincingly.
“Harry!” Neville cried; voice strained. He had to jog to try and catch up. “Just w
Neville took the opportunity to take in the crowd. ‘These times’ referred to the events of the end of last school year, which Neville had been told in strict confidence by Harry and Ron.
“Even when I’m not” Harry agreed.
“But it was agreed centuries ago that the Headmaster or mistress always gets the final say on faculty,” Hermione said, even though she still looked worried, “I read it in—”
They all dug in to their gifts and by the time they had finished a fresh fall of decimated wrapping paper littered the living room carpet. “This can be Kreacher’s present” Sirius said with a toothy grin.
Hermione tended to spiral into extremes when she was nervous.
Neville had at first spent a lot of time with Ernie, Justin and Hannah, who he still studied with from time to time. In fact, Harry had been the one to introduce them. But—but.
He knew Harry didn’t believe it, but Ron would say it until he did and that was what mattered. That one-day Harry might believe he was worthy of a forgiveness he already had.
Harry jerked suddenly, then stood still. His mouth opened and closed like he wanted to say something. His whole body was frozen, desperate for motion with no where to go. Suddenly, he turned. Ripping the door open, he stormed out of the room without a word.
Ginny finally got her first crack in the case in February. Valentines day, to be precise.
Neville yelled, twisting around as if ready to pull Harry blindly back up to the castle.
But there had been some surprises. Slytherins who had come to DA meetings in days past were staying quieter than their more vitriolic peers. In fact, the Slytherins in their year were particularly silent on the matter. Never making their pureblood more apparent than they had before.
Fleur smiled at them beatifically. She was wearing professor robes like any other, her hair pulled back in a neat bun. She had glasses perched on her nose. Neville wondered if she wore them for effect or out of genuinely impaired vision.
“Broom practice. Being left alone” Ginny shrugged, and Harry gave her a small smile.
He just shook his head, dismissing it. “Why won’t Dumbledore just cooperate with the ministry? Then Bones wouldn’t have to get underhanded.”
Draco just shrugged, “It’s just a hope. Which is almost as good as certainty.”
Harry looked up at the woman with badly hidden curiosity “And was that before or after you were an agent of you-know-who?” He snarked, but it was weak at best.
Ginny clutched her new pewter cauldron slightly closer to her chest. She’d never been worried by crowds, but it seemed almost as if there was five people to an inch inside the bookshop. Luna made a funny face had her and Ginny giggled, relaxing slightly. Mum took them to wait in the line to meet Gilderoy and have him sign their books.
What was before them wasn’t impressive in the wondrous way that suddenly appearing magical doors were, but in the way that landfills were sometimes impressive due to their very size. There were stacks and stacks of- stuff. Every type of -stuff- that you could ever imagine. Furniture and books and clothing. Reams of paper and stacks of tea cups and ornate gilded mirrors. Feather boas and stuffed parrots and even a discarded diamond chandelier.
“Are we still calling it the DA?” Ernie Macmillan asked with confusion.
, and
“Mate. Draco is going to kill you when he finds out you left him out of
“Yeah. I was godfather,” Harry looked off into the distance thoughtfully, as if viewing his own life through one of those muggle cinema thingies, “I wonder what happened to him. Poor Teddy.”
“You’d find tie to eat on your own deathbed.” Hermione had said drily, flicking a page over sharply and releasing a cloud of dust into the air as she did.
Ron looked at Harry sideways, eyes full of doubt, “Did we go together last time?”
Harry Potter never seemed to cease in his endless crusade to frustrate her. She was becoming used to his almost constant look of panic after he did or said something, like he felt he shouldn’t have. He seemed absolutely thrilled to personally greet and chat with everyone they crossed paths with, as if he was reuniting with lost friends. Sure, whatever, Hermione was all for socialisation but there
uni is a lot more stress then i anticipated and i accidentally joined a kayaking club that took over my life so i guess? life is strange?
“Er” Tonks says awkwardly “We should probably get going?”
Dumbledore assessed Harry languidly, his whole body relaxed apart from his intense blue eyes. “Love is the most powerful thing in the world.”
By the time mid-October rolled around the weather at Hogwarts had turned from mild and grey to miserable and ready to storm the Bastille. Hermione had woken up every morning that past week to the soothing sound of rain slamming against the girls dormitory window.
“So you stunned him?” Diggory said with rightful indignation.
The day before had been Luna’s birthday, so she’d gotten Luna angel cake and lemonade from the house elves in the kitchen and they’d had a sleepover sequestered in Luna’s Ravenclaw four-poster bed. Ginny had gotten Luna the newest Weird Sister album, because Luna liked to go through all of their songs with a fine-toothed comb and find clues that pointed to Donoghan Tremlett, the bass player, being secretly dead. She also passed on her mother’s present; a knitted pair of radish earrings and a box of home-made toffee.
And now he was untethered. An escaped balloon losing air.
Ron wasn’t sure how much time later it was, but eventually the shouts filtered over to them. Ron’s head shot up, staring across the grounds to the gates. They had been pulled open. There were clear figures standing around- Ron recognised Tonks, Dumbledore, McGonagall.
“Like what?” Ginny, who couldn’t think of anything she cared about more than quidditch, almost yelled.
On Christmas night, after a full day of not getting out of their pyjamas and eating much too much food, Sirius finally declared that it was time to open presents.
She brandished this piece of evidence at him as her magnum opus. Harry just blinked at her in confusion. “What notebook?”
Harry nodded sagely “Yeah. Hermione’s terrifying enough and she’s only a first year. Imagine what she could do as a trained dueller”
That had been when they’d spotted it. About half a mile before the Thief’s downfall there was a small ridge carved into the side of the stone-face.
“Yes. Thank you, Ronald” Her mum said, bustling into the room with a washing up basket full of clothes. She dropped it lightly and then turned around to smile at Harry, who was still stopped just inside the kitchen door. “Well. Let’s have a good look at you then, Harry dear”
“Nothing” Harry said quickly. “Hermione thought she might have left her book with your stuff”
“Hogwarts: A History,” Ron finished, giving her a teasing smile. Hermione gave him a half-hearted scowl.
“This isn’t a house competition.” Hermione scolded.
The plan had come together finally the second time they’d visited the bank. Neville had come alone at the end of the Christmas holidays because he knew his grandmother had a vault in the lower levels of the bank. He’d ummed and ahhed over his grandmothers’ things (mainly antique chairs with faded upholstery) counting silently until he’d finally heard the sounds of another cart fly past.
not talking.”
A secret passage way. A merlin-blessed
He didn’t split his time between a sulking Ron and a worried Harry and Hermione. He rolled his eyes and told Ron to get over it and stop messing up the ‘dynamic’ and then he left to talk about some muggle band with Luna. The Buzzdicks or something.
“It isn’t magic,” Harry said with a shrug, “But it’s certainly something to see.”
“The questions. The cutting remarks,” Hermione moaned.
“You can fight between yourselves for the front,” Sirius said with false cheer.
But then Ginny was coming down the stairs, dressed in shades of blue and grey. Draco smiled at her charmingly. “Terrifying as always, Ginevra.”
“We have uniforms and it doesn’t mean that we all look that good.” Neville pointed out.
“You okay?” Harry mouths, catching her eyes across the table and giving her a weak smile in return. He’s still sad about Pettigrew, put pushing through for them.
“This is going to be hell.” Ron bemoaned, staring into the fire gloomily.
“Just recognised it,” Harry said simply, but he didn’t meet Neville’s eyes.
The last thing Ginny heard was
I see the world and it is nothing special. It is a brick wall that you can not run through. It is stone stacked shoddily on mortar and nothing else.
To be truly honest it wasn’t the voice which made her get up. She had been pretty comfortable after all. It was the wafted scent of pumpkin pasties carried on the wind. This meant one person- Harry- and meant one thing- Harry
Plus, it was notoriously unreliable. More often than not you committed heinous sins to only achieve a shade of your lost loved one, or a miserable and unstable ghost.
sign and her name in red letters- was open slightly even though she knew she always closed it fully because she didn’t want her brothers to snoop.
“Brain damage equals life time discount.” Fred finished.
“You, Harry Potter, are
“It wasn’t too bad. But it was hilarious.” Harry insisted.
It was so obviously a lie. It was
At three, the news came that there was all out battle in the Atrium. At five, that the hostages taken by Voldemort had been freed. At six, the whole common room sat in hushed silence to listen to an emergency address.
Harry pouted harder. “Who says I’m planning?”
Sirius gave him a puzzled look, his eyes searching. “Course I worry, Nev. You’re one of my lot now, crazy little pack that we are.”
“You matter.” Ron said, aghast. “Harry, you
Harry shook his head, “Not now. In the past. He was always trying to get my attention.”
“I hope Draco’s dad isn’t mad.” Hermione said with worry, as if reading Ron’s mind.
“Yeah, yeah. ‘The Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives’.” Harry said this all in a bored tone, as if he were reading a weather report.

“Oh, god yeah.” Tonks laughed. “Look at me. Consummate professional, I am. I’m Tonks.” She flicked her wand at the blackboard and her name appeared there in chalk. “You can just go ahead and call me Tonks.”
“Wonder what Fleur will be like as a teacher.”
“In between the extensive tournament reporting.” Hermione sighed. “It hasn’t even properly begun yet.”
Luna took a moment to swallow the tightness in her throat away. “Purple. I mean. She died in this cloud of purple smoke. Like a magic trick”
And down below the heating flagstones Neville Longbottom kissed Harry Potter next to a raging fire of dark magic, only separated from it by a single stone wall.
Harry was looking at Dumbledore with a look that could only be described as a glare.
Harry had laughed to himself. “Oh merlin, times really do change.”
“One of those mysterious
“I thought maybe we could start having muggle movie nights or gatherings where we played muggle music?” Harry said, shifting awkwardly in front of the room of fifty or so students. Harry didn’t generally take a leading role at these meetings, though it was widely acknowledged that the club belonged to him. His public speaking could certainly be improved. Mainly because he always seemed as if he would prefer to be anywhere else when he had to talk in front of large crowds.
“Is she happy?”
“He did defeat You-know-who” Rupert pointed out, shyly.
To Hermione’s surprise, Harry looked vaguely excited to see the rude boy. Hermione thought he and his two shadows looked like just the sort who would nick her bookbag off her and then refuse to give it back and laugh while she tried to get it.
But it was okay, they told him, they were doing it for a ‘good reason’
Before they could climb through the portrait hole, they both stopped and turned to each other.
In May all anybody would talk about was politics.
“Go. Where.” She said through gritted teeth.
I can feel cold wind whistle through the cracks. Next to me the stacks of his lives taunt me and the floor beneath me is cold.
” Fred said rolling his eyes.
She looked at him with interest, pushing her mane of hair away from her face to give him her full attention. “Yes?”
Hermione turned to the final pages of her notebook and began the list
Harry laughed, “No, Nev. We’re trapped here forever.” He said sarcastically, then he ran a hand over his eyes and sighed, “Sorry. Yes. I can get it back. Don’t worry.”
Also can you tell i love Fleur Delacour with my whole heart? please ask me about my little head canons discussing hp makes me so happy.
“No” Harry agreed “But we are the things we think will hurt the people we love least” He shrugs “And for me that means I’m alright”
“I’m Patrick. This is my wife Jean” Said the overwhelmed man. Patrick shook his fist lightly “And yes, we were going to try and change this lot over”
Harry just rolled his eyes and clapped the boy on the shoulder. Ron and Hermione gave him enthusiastic hugs hello. She gathered from their greetings that the boy was actually called Draco.
It was easy to imagine the worst. Susan Bones had left school immediately, whisked away by sobbing relatives into, what could only be presumed as, hiding.
“Think she wants to get all E’s and above on her Owls like Bill did” Harry said.
“Hm,” Harry said, scrunching his face up in memory, “Krum first maybe. Or Fleur?”
Neville noticed that she looked rough. Her eyes were red-rimmed, smudges of eye-make up crowned her cheek bones. She had clearly been crying.
_______________________
When Hermione, Ron and Draco pressed him further for information he simply pressed the flimsy excuse that it was for ‘research’.
“Well” Hermione said drily “At least we won’t need the lock pick set”
Ron laughed, then frowned again. “Ginny’s left out, then.”
“They’re iron. Iron protects from cursed objects. It’s old fae magic I think, from before they went extinct” Hermione said.
I feel them locked away in leather prisons and their lives rip my heart from my chest. Every breath they take is one I do not.
Twenty minutes later- and two explosions right in Draco’s unamused face- the first champion broke the surface.
“No,” Neville huffed, “Where are you going?” His voice was harsher than he felt he had ever been in his whole life. He was shocked by his own vehemence.
You couldn’t just go about liking everyone you met. It was indecent. It was simply un-British.
He blinks at her slowly, looking for all the world as if he’s talking to a rabid griffin instead of a twelve-year-old girl. “Erm” He starts, and Luna’s noticed that Draco is a person that only ever seems eloquent in situations he feels in control of. Otherwise he’s a stumbling mess. She sort of prefers it. She wishes she had a pair of her spectre-specs so that she could check him for wrackspurts.
Luna had also decided to sneak into Gryffindor tower rather than stay with the Ravenclaw lot. She was the first one down the stairs, dressed in a floaty orange dress that was just on the slight side of garish. She had clementine earrings to match and her shoes were large, hob-nailed boots. Harry grinned at her widely, offering her his arm.
Hermione swung the backpack of her shoulders and it thumped heavily on the ground “We want to make sure that those nefarious deeds can’t happen”
Just this life, and my eyes left to treasure it. I turn to the closest shelf, and feel cold leather beneath my fingers.
“Well, lucky us she remembered this one.” Harry stared Dumbledore down, the both of them unwavering in their gazes. “Take the guard off the prophecy room. It’s useless. Let Voldemort get at it.”
“And you would, too.
Colin passed her her hat with a teasing grin.
Nobody would ever think there is anything unusual or special about Ron Weasley.
“Oh, excellent.” Draco said as they all stood up to cheer and peer across the lake. “It’s Delacour.”
He went to his bed, closing his curtains. He didn’t emerge until the next morning.
It was—a map. Neville vaguely remembered catching glances of it before.
She’s just coming up to the weeping willow when she spots them. They appear out of mid air next to the tree and Harry stuffs something silky into his pocket. An invisibility cloak, she thinks in surprise. Hermione, who’s tied her mane of hair back into two neat buns and who’s wearing an outfit reminiscent of a muggle spy, is laden with a ginormous back pack. Harry picks up something from the ground and throws it at the tree. The tree freezes.
Ten years of being the younger and only sibling of six brothers had taught Ginevra Weasley (who had been only 5 years old when she realised the full extent of her hatred towards her full name) several important lessons that she would carry through her entire life.
Hermione’s lips curled up reluctantly at the corners. It did explain a lot of Harry’s strange behaviour, she had to admit. Like how he seemed to always know when Draco was about to insult Ron or the few times he’d called someone by name even though they’d obviously never met him before.
Ron felt someone trying to usher him away, heard words like ‘Aurors’ and ‘minister’, but he didn’t process it and he didn’t move. He just stared down at Pettigrew, who’s dish-water blonde hair was stained a dark drown with dried blood.
Voldemort was back. But you would hardly be able to tell from the crowd of happy weddinggoers, orbiting merrily the happy couple in the centre who swayed with each other, eyes never straying.
“Look, Luna! Didn’t I say they were up to something?”
“A museum!” Hermione crowed. “Oh, Har
“I need to do something,” Harry snapped; voice harsh, “You don’t have to come.”
Ginny rolled her eyes skywards “Harry won’t change much”
Sirius bent down onto his knees so that he was Harry’s height “Harry” He said nervously “I know you live with your aunt, but..” He bit his lip “We’d like you to come stay with us over the summer”
Ginny, Luna and he had found their friend group outside, basking in the June sun. Their three pale faces had tipped the group off quickly, with easy smiles slipping off their faces and Harry shooting into the air.
In fact he was mainly focusing on the realisation that in asking Hermione to the ball he had failed to mention that he meant as just friends. had Hermione known what he meant? She had said yes anyway. She must know. He had a horribly unnerving thought; that perhaps if it wasn’t as strictly friends, he might not really mind.
“Harry!” She cried, letting out an ear-bleeding screech, “It’s been so long.”
Neville flushed, looking down awkwardly at his black dress shoes. He didn’t say anything. Sirius just patted him again, warmly.
Harry whooped. “This, my good friends, is the Room of Requirement. It’ll become anything you need.”
“Okay,” Harry said, finally letting out an exhale. “Okay.”
“Come on” Hermione said “Maybe it would be fun”
“See” Sirius said smugly to Lupin “I can do thoughtful things”
“They’ll be busy.” Harry said with a wavering certainty, “Are they trying to take it back?”
“Mione don’t react but Victor Krum is here.” He said with excitement.
“You know occlumency?” Ron exclaimed, almost dropping his sandwich. “That is so cool!”
Then she saw it. Red sparks shot up from inside a cluster of trees and bushes at the far side of the shore. Then smoke plumed out towards the sky. Suddenly, two figures ran out of the copse, hands over their mouths and faces smudged with dirt.
Ginny sped up, her feet slapping wetly against the floor. She wanted to catch up to Harry as soon as possible so that she could leave this place immediately. She followed the winding pipe, which bent this way and that seemingly on a whim. Finally, she turned a bend and caught sight of Harry, standing in front of a snake-decorated door. He was hissing at it.
was going to be staying in this very house for a week. With her.
Hermione thought there was equal part welcome and strange reluctance in Harry’s voice, though Hermione attributed that to the Malfoy boys generally unpleasant aura.
“Glad you could stay with us in the end” Remus Lupin said, opening the door to a previously hidden, and unexpectedly Gothic, London townhouse.
Harry laughed like Ron had made a purposeful joke and then waved his hands in a shushing motion. “Give me a sec and you’ll see, alright?”
The weather improved over the next few days of Harry’s stay. The house was constantly bustling with activity normally, but with Harry there it seemed to double as everyone found new and improved ways to entertain him or things to show him. Ginny got the feeling that Harry would have been happy to watch paint dry with them.
They both plonked them selves down on either side of Harry.
“Even when you’re not” Luna said.
“Of course.” Draco drawled.
“You’re Harry Potter?” he gasped, “
The sun was beginning to set when the compartment door once again flew open. However, this time it wasn’t chubby Neville, but a pointy little boy with atrociously gelled back white blonde hair, a book under his arm, and two boys who were clearly lost extras from an Al Pacino movie.
Hermione gaped back at him. She was just about to mouth something back at him, make first contact as they say, when a tower of trunks floated by (with magic!) and blocked the boy from view. When her eye line finally cleared, she caught only scraggy black hair disappearing into the crowd.
Neville gave Harry a sideways look of judgement. But he was a supportive friend, so he didn’t ask why Harry was spending so much time in a girl’s bathroom.
Hermione looked at her in alarm. “What did you just cast?”
Neville had mistakenly come across a few things in his life. First, his grandmother’s underwear drawer. There were just certain things about your grandmother you weren’t meant to know. What her underwear looked like was one of them.
“When I was seventeen” Harry clarified “May of our seventh year” He frowned again “Not that we spent much time at school that year”
Harry whirled about then, kicking at a pile of dead leaves, “That’s the thing. The odd thing is that Draco Malfoy and I are friends at all, that we can even stand each other. But everything’s so different here.” He looked at Ron with desperate eyes, wild with panic. “I don’t know anything anymore, not really. I can’t predict a thing.”
Then she grabbed Tonks’ hand, dragging the woman ahead and talking at her a mile a minute in a mix of French and English.
“Kreacher!” Harry called softly into the emptiness, voice tinged with tense worry.
“Maybe one of their classes is about intense beauty regimes.” Harry said ponderously.
“Well, no.” Harry conceded. “I was hoping that this time would go a lot better than the last. After all, I have insider information. I’ve literally robbed it before.” He shrugged, “And I can’t just leave the horcruxes in the Chamber of Secrets indefinitely. I need to get them all, then destroy them.”
“Not really” Luna shrugged, closing her book. Obviously, Harry needed to have a Conversation about something “They got distracted by NEWTs. I thought it was an intriguing idea, though”
He unfurled it to reveal the final few inches, three neat stanzas in Luna’s curling handwriting.
Harry looked a little bit wrong-footed for a moment, and then he straightened again. “Trawlawney told me.”
“I told them that they needed to put anti-Animagus charms on the castle” Harry hissed to their cluster of sleeping bags in the corner of the Great hall. They’ve been taking under their breathe because Percy ordered them all to stop talking ten minutes ago. He’s on the other side of the hall now so they’re being treated to Harry’s tirade.
“Well daddy only owled me Monday” Luna said, shrugging.
“You-know-who is dead” Ginny said, jumping despite herself at Harry’s casual use of the name of a man who had died when she was hardly a few months old.
Neville wondered who she had been trying to contact. Who would Fleur know in the British ministry?
His stare cuts my soul.
“Yes, I didn’t think it was important. Now, Malfoy, are you sitting down or not?” Harry said, cutting off an increasingly baffled Malfoy once again. Harry cast a distasteful look at Malfoy’s two friends, “Sorry I don’t think there’s room for all of you.”
He broke off, eyes drifting over to look at the wall of collected Ravenclaw paraphernalia. Or perhaps it was propaganda. Or just the impedimenta of a hundred or more lonely intellects trying to share a thought with a non receptive world. Luna didn’t turn to see what he was looking at but just watched his face instead. How every emotion danced across the delicate bones built below translucent skin. Draco always gave off the initial impression of chill—it was why people like Ginny, who was all fire, took immediate dislike to him. He seemed insular and arctic. But it was an illusion—a trick of the light which danced off his sharp angles. Draco wasn’t cold- and he wasn’t fire like Ginny or sunshine like Harry or rainstorms like her mother had been- he was the sky. Ever changing and ever moving. Grey to blue to pink to apocalyptic red. Changing with moods and feelings and winds. Hidden by flimsy clouds.
“Welcome home my boys” He said warmly.
But it was staying put where the cauldron had been. It danced and surged, hooves seemed to stretch from the flames, galloping on the damp air, racing to get away but instead they were sucked back in. As if the flames were behind a whirlwind. The fames would reach up into the air, then surge back down.
Draco’s eyes snapped to her, bewildered “Because I’m a Malfoy”
“I’m not following him because I have a crush on him” She yelled, indignantly.
A fourth year Hufflepuff by the name of David wrote fabulous articles about the History of Hogwarts that were more interesting then Bins could ever hope to be. Luna hoped that the articles renewed interest in history for the student population. His friend Paloma and a Sixth-year Slytherin called Hattie (who had admitted rather embarrassed that she was Rita Skeeter’s niece) were in charge of current affairs.
“It’s my father” Draco said dismally “He has half the Wizengamot in his pocket not to mention the sway he has over the school board”
Malfoy, looking like someone who has lost the plot of the world rather completely and was now completely off the rails, nodded. “I- Crabbe, Goyle. Go- find somewhere else to sit or whatever.”
Hermione shrugged, giving up a half smile “You can go tell Ron if you want. But I’m the one who has you currently trapped in a classroom.” He laughed “Harry. I want to help you”
“What’s all this about, mate.” Ron asked quietly. “Aren’t we a bit young to be doing stuff like this without, I dunno, a supervising adult?”
was circled extensively in one corner of the page.
a lie.
“Welcome to the peasants view.” He joked.
“This is way more fun than being in that bloody tent. Wanna make a wager?”
“Who’s Bellatrix Lestrange? I recognise the name.” Ron questioned, the name ringing a bell. For some reason Neville shot into his mind but he couldn’t say why.
“I think it’s an optical illusion.” Ginny said, squinting. “Like with the uniforms or whatever.”
“The tunnels are all under the castle, but I’ve found where some of them come out. I’m going to blast the hell out of one of the grates at the end and she can get out that way.”
Neville shrugged awkwardly, “You know,” He murmured, pointlessly. “I mean,”
“It really isn’t that big of a deal.” Harry said, though his face said the opposite. Ron braced himself for the truth. “You see the truth is—”
“In a secret underground chamber?”
When Neville stopped speaking, no one spoke. Mulling gently over what they had heard. It was a beautiful sentiment, but it wasn’t only that.
“No one Sirius and Remus would invite would talk to your parents.” Harry said, though he too looked around assessing at the crowd.
brilliant."
Hermione paused and stared at him suspiciously “What did you do”
Ron looked at Draco with disgust. He was waving a small powder-blue flag.
“Well,” Harry amended blushing, “Obviously
“So, two options out of the three.” Draco laughed, rolling his eyes. “Very helpful Potter.”
“Oi.” Draco said, making his way over and plopping himself between Harry and Ginny. “What are you whispering about?”
Sirius pouted “Spoil sport”
“No,” Harry said harshly. Neville looked at him in surprise. He looked oddly determined, but also slightly green. “She’s dead.”
“Well we managed to watch Star Wars” Harry shrugged “So I guess this room has its own rules?”
“The weather’s not summer-like at all.” Neville pointed out, then wondered if that was another one of those odd things he always found himself saying even when he tried not to.
A photo of his parents on their graduation day, laughing. Too much for a heart to handle.
“Everyone knows that Fudge will just get re-elected. He’s been minster for two terms, and no one seems to hate him that much”
Ginny thought,
It was early may and they had been generally taken up with revising for exams (“I didn’t have to do them last time.” Harry had said with a pout. “Yeah, but last time you had to fight a dragon, so.” Ron had pointed out, which had shut him up.) or revising dark necromantic rituals. It was an odd mix. But fitting for them.
But before she or Harry could go on a sharp ringing sounded. It was coming from Harry’s pocket. They all went quiet and stared at him.
Harry and Hermione looked at each other meaningfully and Ginny once again got the feeling that she was on the outside looking in.
magic?”) when Harry suddenly shot up from dawdling on Hermione’s plush bedroom floor with is Plan Face on. No good ever came of Harry’s Plan Face.
Hermione gave him a smile and patted him awkwardly on the arm.
It was true that Lockhart was an abysmal teacher, but Ginny was surprised still when the flyer went up in the common room.
i get so happy when you tell me your thoughts so please, please do. believe me it means so much to me
“Oh, you know.” Ron said lightly. “I have an overactive imagination.”
Harry and Ron burst out of a tapestry, giggling. Hermione followed at a more sedate pace, rolling her eyes.
Ginny shifted it awkwardly in her arms, and Harry’s gaze broke. He blinked, then looked up at her and gave her an abashed smile.
And if Hermione hadn’t known better, which she was always sure she did, and had been slightly more cynical, which she was sure was a skill that would come with age, she would have called Harry’s extreme perturbance, worry and strife over the lost rat just a
They were children playing in their parent’s world, blindsided by the shadows they cast on every wall.
But before Ginny could finish Cedric was breaking the surface of the water, Cho Chang gasping for breath in his arms Krum followed not even moments later, a bulky Durmstrang boy in hand.
“No.” Harry said, disbelieving laughter in his voice. “Don’t try and read my mind,
“He went this way.” Hermione said, a few metres ahead of the Weasley siblings. “God, what the hell is happening?”
“Why’s it got you bothered
Harry’s eyes kept roaming over the map frantically- then they stopped. “Fuck!” Harry yelled, throwing the map to the ground and tugging his hands through his hair.
“Did this happen last time?” Ron asked frantically, eyes skimming the page over Harry’s shoulders. Harry was staring in disbelief at the prophet- a newspaper he referred to exclusively as ‘utter rubbish propaganda’.
Halloween finally came and with it a black cloud hanging over Harry’s head. If Hermione had thought a normal Harry was impossible to deal with, she’d obviously just jinxed herself.
“And Nev if it comes to it.” Ron said, and Neville rolled his eyes and gave him a friendly whack on the back of his head.
Harry and Draco both eyed the package with interest. Draco because he’d never actually seen a pen before and Harry because he suspected everyone of nefarious behaviour despite being the most suspicious person to ever exist.
Draco glanced at her, and gave her a friendly if awkward smile “You must be Weasley’s sister? Sorry for that sad turn of events”
“I’ve been really lucky twice now to have you as my friend Hermione” He said gratefully.
Then they were back off, winding their way along the vault pathway, climbing up the stairs and edging their way along the cavern edge, ducking around the waterfall as they went.
Hermione lifted her wand, took a deep breath, and wiped the goblins memories. Then she closed her eyes, her wand swaying back and forth in her hand, and created new ones.
“He’s always trying to get your attention now.” Ron pointed out drily.
“We could learn Therianthropy,” Neville sighed, one afternoon. They were all stressed because they had decided to move the plan up to the end of March. The first Sunday of the Easter Holidays. (“Then we can spend the rest of term revising. You know. After we rob a bank,” Hermione had said)
While in the cubicle Hermione could swear she heard the sound of stone scraping against stone. She really hoped to harry wasn’t destroying school property while she was present.
The general election would be in two days, on Thursday. She’d received many a pompous lecture from Percy on the candidates and magical political climate. She’d also helped Draco make a “Vote for Bones” Poster which he stuck in the entrance hall. It got taken down after only an hour by McGonagall however because apparently the school was supposed to be a politically neutral environment.
Colin turned around, smiling “They’ve headed back to the castle. But I got a picture first”
“Plus its literally my second year. Don’t know why Ginny’s so bothered” Luna agreed.

Ginny did, avoiding her mothers’ judging eyes and placing the half empty jam jar on the kitchen table before running up to her bedroom and promptly screaming into her pillow for three hours.
“Hermione!” He cried, and they hugged each other like they hadn’t seen each other in ten years instead of, at a stretch, two months. Fred and George made kissy faces at each other and Ginny mimed vomiting.
_______________________
Harry lingered. The other two occupants of the table and Hermione herself stared at him in shock. Harry never spent any more time in a room with Snape than he needed to.
“What happened in first year?” Ron insisted, directing it towards his sister indignantly.
“And we are really excited to stuff herself with clotted cream” Si joked.
There was an awkward minute after that while they both bit into their scones and avoided eye contact. Then Ginny decided to et it go and move the conversation onto greener pastures.
“Very alliterative of your narrative Harry” Hermione said.
They truly didn’t know a thing. Not even if Voldemort was back though Harry was convinced. The student body and wider population had not been told of the final attack, with Harry and Ron sworn not to speak of it publicly despite Harry’s protests.
” Ron exclaimed.
“Ginny you can’t come” Harry said, in a voice that brokered no argument. Well. Ginny Weasley could argue with a brick wall and come out victorious.
After everyone else had chimed in with their agreement, Harry was fixed in his goal. Luna still wasn’t sure about McGonagall- but if anyone’s stubbornness could rival hers then it was Harry Potter’s.
’. Despite how desperately, unrelentingly and woefully Hermione Granger wanted a friend, the need was still outweighed by her pathological need to be right. Always. And to make sure that people were
Neville guessed he slipped in with Ginny and Luna. By third year he spent more time with Ginny, Luna, Draco and the crazy trio then with the Hufflepuffs. By fourth year it was solidified.
“Nah” Harry said, rolling his eyes “That’s third year stuff that is”
Molly Weasley (nee. Prewett and don’t you forget it) goes into labour at six in the morning, just after she places that mornings bread loaf in the airing cupboard for a final rise. By nine o'clock Ron Weasley, baby-pink and not making a fuss, is swaddled against her chest as she orders Arthur to put the bread in the oven or breakfast will be
Draco leaned around Neville, “Who’s up first, then?”
of august, the day after Percy’s birthday- it rained. It had not rained all summer and Ginny was certain that this was an omen. This visit was going to be the death of her.
“Oh shut up.” Draco scowled, throwing one of the cat-smelling pillows at Harry’s laughing face. “Prat.”
Grimmauld place- as Luna found out the townhouse was ironically called- was a much different place to live then her home. Her father wasn’t dull or boring by anyone’s standards, but he often lost himself in his work and left Luna to her own devices. Sirius and Remus weren’t like that. They seemed overjoyed to spend their time joking and laughing with the three teens occupying their house. Sirius often started the morning by announcing what that days ‘adventure’ was going to be over breakfast.
“Cedric Diggory.” Dumbledore called out warmly, on the night of Halloween. The Hufflepuffs burst into raucous applause and the rest of the hall followed sedately behind.
Another red tie. Bravery seeped deep into strong bones. He was never offered greatness by a magic hat, this boy bleeds red and gold.
Ron had come to her mid-way through November and told her to stop following Harry around because it was creepy.
It was the look on Harry’s face that finally convinced her. He looked positively crushed. She looked into his eyes and saw a boy who was truly doing the best he could, even if his best sometimes fell short.
A sombre silence engulfed the classroom, but Professor Delacour broke it with a radiant smile, “But we must not always be serious. Over the next few weeks we will be reviewing and expanding your knowledge on counter-curses. Today, a practical.” She clapped her hands together and all of the spare tables and chairs flew to the sides of the room. “Up, up,” She said, and they scrambled to do so. “Time to show me your moves, oui?”
“You orchestrated this.” Neville said, laughing and nudging Ginny in the side. He, Ginny and Luna were all squashed together on one sofa, with Ron and Hermione in another and Draco and Harry each curled up in separate armchairs.
“And being family doesn’t already mean that?” Ron asked wryly.
Bowtruckles left scars on Neville’s left hand (and Hermione’s right kneecap. Though she had been more annoyed about the ripped pair of tights), Europa, Callisto and Ganymedes refused to show up for him when he tried charting them, Summoning charms had left so many books flying straight at Neville’s head he had begun to worry about compacted head injuries (he took a book about muggle medicine out of the library) and his dream interpretations were so terrible his creative writing talents were being exercised more than his third-eye ever would be.
In the end they didn’t need to worry too much about exams- everything went smoothly of course. Hermione still spent an hour-long autopsy on every single exam. Luna was glad she had taken different ones so that she didn’t have to be subjected to it. Hermione did however quiz her to determine what had changed from her second-year exams to Luna’s.
“What happened?” Hermione asked the Weasley siblings softly, Harry and Draco similarly next to them to give Nev and Luna some small privacy.
“Oh” Ginny said, stupidly.
“It’s her job,” Harry said, looking slightly more relieved.
Harry looked at her with pity. Like he thought she was just Ron’s stupid kid sister, upset over being left out. Maybe she was.
“Well,” Ron said simply, “Hermione has homework.”
Ginny Weasley maybe didn’t know it consciously, and her brothers certainly didn’t teach it consciously, but she knew it either way.
November passed without much ceremony, though it couldn’t exactly be described as calm. Although had any of the months of his Hogwarts life been calm? No, not possible. This was Neville. This was
She shoved him. He laughed. She unlocked the door just to have something that meant she could turn around and hide her smile.
. Ginny couldn’t keep up.
“Kreacher I order you not to say that word.” Harry snapped, real anger colouring his voice now. He took a deep breath. “And now,” He paused, like he was scared, “I need you to bring me Regulus’ locket.”
Which Ron just really didn’t think was the best declaration to start on? Ron loved his best friend, he
“Come on” She said, standing up in a switch of her over-sized school skirt. She left all of her work where it was. Ginny had done something last year which meant no one bothered her things any more, though she wouldn’t admit what. She grabbed Draco’s hand and pulled him up, leading him across and out of the common room.
Hermione and Ron met eyes over Harry’s head. Sometimes it seemed like all they did was look at each other in confusion or frustration over Harry’s behaviour. Now they both shared matching looks of concern.
. I just don’t think the magical woodland creature knows that snide remarks are how you impart love”
“Can’t she?” Hermione muttered with the chagrin of a good friend who’s been forced to put up with too much.
“I better no get brain damage from this.” Ron grumbled, rubbing the back of his head.
“Not if I’m doing it for good,” Harry said, sounding manic in his determination.
Harry shrugs “Don’t know why” He grinned slyly “It’s surprising they’re both cat people”

“Oh, is it,” She said through gritted teeth, “And will it also shower on Easter and be chilly on Halloween? Oh, how
“Remus,” Harry said, scandalized, “Did you let Sirius wear eyeliner?”
“Just the chickens” Harry soothed, and Ginny relaxed.
“Ages ago. And it was interrupted, remember.”
“I’m sure we’ll be back to normal next year” Ron said drily “This is Hogwarts after all”
Ron frowned. This didn’t seem to be how you’d act of you were about to announce a relationship. “This is serious, isn’t it?” He said quietly.
“See ya.” He mumbled, turning an about face to head out of the library. He absently noticed that Victor Krum was glaring at him, but he was hardly focused on that.
“Go after him,” Fleur said, “Make sure he is safe.”
Hermione hadn’t decided if she was someone who was comfortable with swearing yet, but she was sure it didn’t count if it was a direct quotation in one’s own mind.
Holding Harry’s hand was different to Luna’s. His palms were rough and unpleasantly warm, she could feel hers already beginning to sweat in his embrace. She wished Luna was here with her. She knew Luna would give her left foot to meet a real-life basilisk.
“Oh, I’m
They were in the Room of Requirement, which currently had changed to a perfect blend of the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor common rooms, with cosy chairs and a fireplace but shelves of books lining the walls. The blue and red was slightly clashing, however.
Luna and Colin exchanged an obviously exasperated look. They agreed anyway, but all they found in the trees were exploded pinecones and a smoking log. Ginny was disappointed but she made Colin take pictures anyway.
“The paper’s given up hope on that already.” Neville said softly.
He tried to spend time with Ginny before he abruptly remembered that Ginny was the devil. Plus, she spent half her time mooning over Lovegood so it was futile anyway.
“What else hurts them?”
“Han Solo” Harry corrected “But anyway, yeah thank you Draco”
Ron groaned “I half wish I wasn’t going home for Christmas with the way you’ve been harping on”
“What’s that?” Draco asked, looking in alarm at the record player as if he thought it might be a torture device Luna was going to use on him.
Harry shook his head, “I don’t have a clue.”
“You can’t know that” Harry said, mildly offended.
“Terrible French.” Tonks shrugged. She glanced at the class, seemingly remembering that she was meant to be teaching. Fleur noticed them too.
It was strange. There was nothing extraordinary about Ronald Weasley. There should never have been anything special or extraordinary about him or his life at all. And yet—
_______________________
“Well to start I suppose we should go inside” Harry said, his brown skin looking almost pale. Hermione grabbed his hand and gave him a reassuring nod. She wasn’t smiling, though she didn’t look scared.
She wasn’t exactly feeling hopeful for its utility in Hagrid’s case.
Hermione choked on air. They were going to have to also have a talk about revealing world-altering information with tact. “And where in god’s name are they now?”
He started to head to the library with the sounds of Harry’s spluttering fading in the background.
Hermione huffed “Yes, well. However odd Kreacher can be, that still won’t make me condone institutionalised slavery”
“Do you have it here?” Ginny asked, pulling Luna’s crocheted bag towards her. She pulled out a roll of fresh parchment. “This it?”
“We don’t know that it’s him.” Remus said softly.
Just like—” But Neville didn’t hear who it was just like, because Harry as storming away from him again, striding down the long corridor.
“No,” Neville said, but he was already tumbling back, his feet turning over each other in their haste to get away. Harry began to chant. A spark flew from his wand.
Harry seemed to have a clear philosophy: Whatever people were saying when they thought you couldn’t hear, that’s what you wanted to know.
Charlie he only heard about in fantastical tails of Dragon keeping from the rest of the family around the dinner table. Percy was a quieter figure than his preceding reputation suggested. Neville had been to busy hiding from his authority to know him very well, and he gained little from his stay except to learn that Percy was still as diligent and obsessive about work as he had always seemed before.
And that was when the opposite wall of the tent burst into flames.
Neville nodded jerkily, spinning around on his feet so fast he almost fell over sideways. He was grateful when Sirius didn’t laugh.
Ginny was watching bemusedly. “You know I’ve always thought that the gambling culture at Hogwarts was slightly worrying.”
“I bet you two galleons that Ireland catches the snitch before Krum.” Harry said, baring his teeth as he bit into a red liquorice wand.
It was mid-December and Neville was still riding high off of the letter he’d recently received confirming, because he hadn’t been sure, that Sirius and Remus expected him back for Christmas break.
He held it out to Harry preciously. “Regulus be giving his life for his locket.” He said mournfully. Hermione desperately wanted to know who this Regulus was.
“Then this is like a reset. Magic is giving me a second chance.”
What he said was, “Because stuff like this can only go on so long.” He gave another huff and went back to staring out the window.
“Well it’s a book for girls” Ron muttered stubbornly.
She couldn’t quite seem to figure out how this fit into whatever it was Hermione and Harry were up to. She signed her name up, anyway, and Colin’s too for good measure. She made a note to get Luna to do it too.
“Hello Mrs. Weasley” Luna said, squinting to look at her directly. She pushed her long blonde hair out of her face, where it had fallen as she drew.
It couldn’t hurt. Just to go up through the tapestry. It would be a shortcut, wither way. And if he found some clue, some errant piece of evidence- Well. That was only a secondary benefit.
“They’re decreasing the number by two.” Ron said, frowning, “If it’s a ritual that must have something to do with it.”
Harry shook his head, “He wouldn’t do that. I’m sorry I brought it up.”
“Come on.” Ron said gruffly, helping Ginny steady herself after tripping over a tree root. The wood was dark, the only light illuminating their paths the periodic flashes of spell light from the campsite.
“But we have Herbology,” Hermione began with surprise.
“Maybe we could do a book club” Hermione said hopefully. Ron rolled his eyes.
you plan a murder in it.”
Hermione and Harry-
She swung her legs up and over the log, swivelled so she was sitting up and made grabby hands at a dishevelled Harry. He held out the pumpkin pasty, wrapped in a napkin.
“You go after him, Ron.” Hermione fretted, “He never listens to me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Neville couldn’t stand it. Harry, Ron and Hermione hadn’t returned to the common room at all that afternoon. He fled the crimson room, walking swiftly through the castle. Something unruly was simmering in his chest. He felt as if he were full of some strange adrenaline, and yet also as if he was stock still. Frozen in churning movement.
Ron frowned, “What plan?”
“We don’t have to be anything” Luna said simply.
Thereis never as much depth to these relationships, but then again that means that there is so much less devastation when he is once again torn away.
“Look, Draco would be proud of you expanding your repertoire,” Harry cajoled, but Neville thought that Harry was simply caught up in the magic of Christmas, and in their own freedom. Happy to be here and wanting Neville to be happy too.
Harry shrugged, “Obviously it was an imperious. Then whoever was imperiused cast the spell on the papers and it was triggered when I touched one of the editions.”
“Course’.” Ron nodded, wincing. “How could I forget?”
Neville took the brown envelope delicately. When he slipped the close open, he pulled out a small bundle of photographs. He pulled them out with the back showing. They had been dated in an inky scrawl ‘25/12/81’.
Harry shook his head “We never talked about it, I’m not sure. They gave me a joint Christmas gift once, though, before Sirius—” A dark cloud came over Harry’s face, “Before he passed.” Harry shrugged. “Remus married someone else actually. Had a baby.”
“Yeah, about that” Harry said, returning to sheepish “We’re going to do something after this that’s…not adult approved if you catch my drift, Gin. It’s a personal mission.”
“Fleur. Are you alright? What have you heard?” Harry asked, voice verging on desperation. Fleur walked into her office, leaving the door open for them to follow. Neville closed the door behind him softly after entering, feeling awkward.
“No, no it’s worse than that,” Hermione said, looking traumatised, “She’ll make us
And he pulled the lever, bringing them back up into the light.
“Neville,” He said, about to utter the three worst words in existence for someone with weak nerves, “We can explain.”
Next to him, Hemione let out a soft sigh of joy. Neville noticed she was squeezing Ron’s hand tightly in her lap.
things.”
I like him best this way. Ignorantly happy. He isn't as fun, he isn't as him. No scar, no lessons learned with blood and anguish. But this boy is blissfully unaware. There is an arrogance in this version that I do not see in others. He is gifted the grace of oblivion. His mother kisses his forehead, his father ruffles his hair. His uncles. His friends. His lovers.
Harry pouted, hands on his hips in either an ironic facsimile of the aforementioned Lost boy or in a very good impression of a petulant five-year old. “Seriously. Ron, Hermione. I need your help in something.”
“I just don’t understand why it still happened this time. It shouldn’t have gone the same way.”
potion like Wolfsbane?”
He said, commiserating sympathetically.
“You’re staying another year? But your grades are excellent.” Ginny said with confusion.
When they reached a stretch of corridor that didn’t seem any more notable apart from the pretty cool tapestry of dancing trolls, Harry called them to a halt. “Here.”
Another beat of silence.
It wasn’t that she was unrecognisable. But that was only because Neville knew it was her. If a witness were to be asked, they would give a description entirely unlike Hermione’s un-disguised face and body.
Ron chuckled, but shook his head. “Nah, mate. I’m scared off bets with you for life.”
Ron surged forward, flinging himself off the desk. He snatched the letter out of David’s hands, eyes scanning passed the useless information from David’s aunt until he reached the crucial information.
Nev blushed fiercely, as he did any time Ginny so much as looked at him “J-Just going to my Grans, as usual”
Although not as striking and impossibly handsome as his soon-to-be husband, Neville couldn’t lie and say that Professor Lupin hadn’t cleaned up smartly. His own waistcoat was gold, matching his sandy colouring perfectly. He looked suffused in a warm light, even his terrible scars softened and over shadowed. He wasn’t wearing eyeliner, but he did have a lovely red poppy in his buttonhole.
“Leave it to me to nab the only rich spoiled brat with no money”
Hermione had almost entirely filled up her second spare notebook at this point so it was lucky that her dad had gotten her more for Christmas. She’d tried to get another look at Harry’s own notebook, but he’d become much better at keeping a close eye on it ever since he’d found Hermione holding it. It was probably just full of Harry waxing poetical about Cedric Diggory’s eyes. Hermione was going to be a good friend about that and not push it until Harry wanted to talk to her about it himself.
“Hey!” Ron said, even while laughing. Ginny grinned back at the boy.
It was in the lake, in transfigured swimming costumes, that Hermione had a sudden moment that she would have called numinous if she hadn’t been a staunch atheist.
It turned out Harry was right about the boat. Ron still thought that the Beauxbatons entrance was cooler.
“It was Pettigrew. I know it has to be. He’s trying to bring Voldemort back.”
Harry nodded. “You’ve done really well, Kreacher. But I’m going to destroy it. I need you to give it to me so that I can do what Regulus wanted.”
“’Arry,” She said, her voice thicker with her accent than usual. Or perhaps thicker with emotion.
But when the first dance ended their whole friendship group descended on the dance floor. Draco and Ginny danced elegantly. While Harry and Luna showed them up by dancing like absolute lunatics- waving their arms about and jumping around even to the slow songs. Ron led Hermione happily about the dance floor, listening to her natter on about history and inter-school camaraderie and never mentioning when she stepped on his feet. Ron hadn’t thought he would like dancing much, but he didn’t mind when it was Hermione.
It took her days to realise what had struck her as odd about that, apart from the whole of it of course. She’d never told him her last name.
Molly laughed “I’d love to have him, of course. Harry has been through far more than any 11-year-old should have to. He needs a bit of fun. The boys will see to that”
” She said for what felt like the millionth time, “How do you know where it’s going to be?”
“What do you mean?” Ginny said, yanking the bag away from her brother and bushing fiercely.
The record Harry picked out was black, with a sepia toned image of a non-descript man. “Here, Songs of Leonard Cohen. Perfect.”
They all wait with bated breath for what is surely to come.
“Ah. It seems you know more than I thought,” He looked at Sirius and Remus accusingly.
Harry laughed and rolled his eyes. “Ron’s my favourite.”
Three years after that, they had Luna. Nine years after that Pandora was dead.
“Why did he send you? He should be sending adults”
“Well I’m sor
“Lucius” Her dad greeted, voice equally as chilly.
He dies in a graveyard at fourteen. It is a mercy. The lovers saved from fighting on opposite sides of the war.
“Ah, ah. For me to know and—”
Ron didn’t know how he was keeping his eyes open. They’d done a very small heist the night before, breaking into Ludo Bagman's temporary office at Hogwarts to check that the cup wasn't tampered with. When they’d gotten the all-clear, no super-secret death port-key in sight, they’d trudged back up to bed.
because Harry had helped in revealing it.
“Ginny. He can do it, I promise” Hermione said kindly “I wouldn’t go myself if I didn’t trust him not to leave half of my body behind”
“Well at least it isn’t that.” He said with relief. Hermione gave him a soft smile and he blushed, though he couldn’t say why.
“Sirius, you should have sent them upstairs.” Dumbledore said, frowning.
“They are.” Fleur said without bashfulness. “I will be your teacher.”
warnings for this chapter: character death, mentions of violence, darker themes
“Seriously, Ron. You looked, and I quote, like your Great Aunt Muriel on a bad fashion day.”
Then she ran giggling towards the skates, shouting out a challenge that Ginny couldn’t beat her in a race. It was a wonderful afternoon.
Neville gaped at the sight before him. It was one thing to know that Basilisks were 50ft long- but to see it? Neville’s mind could hardly comprehend. She fit in the chamber they were in, though. That was because the chamber they were in was ginormous, with cavernous white walls. A humungous carved effigy of a domineering man towered over the end of the hall. Streams of pale-green water ran down the edges of the room.
, Neville thought sadly, sipping his butterbeer.
“We’ve been unable to see Harry for a long time…due to unforeseen circumstances” Remus explained to her interested mother “But Harry and I have been in contact these past few months and Sirius’…circumstances… just recently changed for the better”
“Who’s in the box, my dear boy?" The wizard asked, his voice clearly denoting that he believed he was conversing with someone who was a few marbles short of a gobstone set. He looked over Harry’s head at Hermione, clearly wanting her to be the one who would explain what was going on. She stared back blankly at him. She didn’t have a clue either, despite Harry’s obviously insane explanation.
Harry had explained to Hermione privately that she shouldn’t get too close to Draco because his family were what was known as blood purists and he couldn’t be trusted not to discriminate against her for being a muggleborn. It was true that at first Draco had seemed vaguely suspicious of her, and obviously alarmed that he’d carried out a lengthy debate on magic with someone with muggle parents. But as the weeks went by, nothing had happened and the two had only grown closer. Whenever Draco made an uninformed or distasteful comment about muggles one of the other three would just correct him. Ron’s attempts often lead to hilariously inaccurate explanations, but the thought was there.
“So, we have until April,” Neville said.
By breakfast on their first day of classes they had definitely noticed. They kept exchanging worried glances. It only added fuel to Ron’s indignant flame. Ron had an inwardly spiteful animated conversation with Seamus and Dean about the Triwizard tournament that had been announced last night.
I wonder if there is a place where he lives out every afterlife. Perhaps that is where the tracks converge. A single Harry Potter, arrogant and humbled all in one soul.
Harry nodded, then dived in to an explanation and demonstration of the spell. He was a good teacher.
next up: Ronniekins
Neither is there anything notably unique about his childhood. A collection of mundane fears. Spiders (severe), heights (he’s working on it) and (though he’ll never tell a soul) inadequacy. A soft toy called Mr. Babbleford he’s had since his birth, the first and only toy he played with that wasn’t a hand-me-down. Special birthday teas around a sibling-crowded dinner table. Small hands clutching the worn lintel of the kitchen door listening to his parents worry about money. A little sister he didn’t want but loved desperately.
and facts about werewolves and magical artefacts. She had to go on a reconnaissance mission to find out (she stole one of Ron’s old letters out of his trunk) but she confirmed the writing was Hermione’s. Whatever Harry was up to, Hermione had initially not been involved.
“Ginny” Hermione said, clear panic spilling across her face. Up close Ginny can see that strapped to the backpack is a bedroll. Merlin, she thinks.
“Oh merlin,” Ron shuddered, sharing a look of commiseration with Neville. “You’re so lucky, Gin.”
“Kreacher I order you not to wake up Mrs. Black’s Portrait.” Harry hissed, and then, “And don’t insult Hermione.” He added, pointing at Hermione to indicate her.
“Mummy” She’d been saying, because a girl in the village had said she couldn’t join in on their skipping game because she was weird “Why don’t people like me?”
“This,” Harry said with far too much smugness, “Is Barty Crouch,” after a stunned moment of silence he added with quite a lot less dram,. “
Upstairs it was barely lunchtime, and people were trading information about the coup like any other gossip, hands wringing with the unknowing. It had been only a few hours since they had heard the news themselves. Fleur still sat in her office, desperately awaiting another Patronus. The first wave of soft heat was only now drifting up through the stone floors. People were wondering why the weather had picked such horrible day to be so lovely and warm. They rolled their eyes, blamed it on the baffling British weather.
Actually, Hermione wasn’t entirely sure wizards believed in gravity. They probably just believed Merlin had cast some exhaustive sticking spell on the world to stop everything floating off.
She didn’t often fully understand what Harry was talking about. He didn’t seem to expect her too, and in return he never laughed at anything she said or gave her odd looks. She’d even heard him telling off Ronald for calling her Loony. Harry always seemed vaguely fuzzy to Luna, as if he was somehow out of place. She didn’t mind too much. Apart from Ginny and Colin, he was her only other friend in the world.
had someone to sit with at dinner. That she always had someone to partner with. Someone to spend her free time with.
“What was that?” Ginny asked, frantically.
“Bonjour, class.” She said. Neville noticed that her accent was less thick and wondered if she had spent the whole summer in England. Her English had always been excellent, however. “My name is Professor Delacour. I am sure you remember me from last year.”
“What do you have to tell me?” Harry said, looking sad to break up the joviality.
The only other times she felt unburdened like that was when she was with Luna. With Luna, she didn’t have to be anything except there.
“Hey, Lu?” Harry says quietly one evening, plopping down the book he was half-heartedly pouring over in a dramatic cloud of dust. It had just been Luna and Harry available tonight, as both Ginny and Ron had decided to watch the Ravenclaw Quidditch practices and Hermione and Draco were writing their arithmancy essays together across the room.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “So It’s probably actually safer for you to tell me. No offence, Harry, but you aren’t exactly a master chess player”
“If you don’t stop chewing with your mouth open, I’ll tell mum at Christmas” Ginny snapped.
. Little sis. The
Hermione leaned forward to give her two-sickles but was interrupted by the slam of the door against the wall.
Because Neville knew one thing that wasn't very Gryffindor in spirit. You couldn't be good all the time. It just wasn't possible.
“Oh,” Hermione said, coming up next to them, “Hi, Nev.”
Harry stared back at her, green eyes boring back into hers. They flicker, staring into her left eye, her right. Searching for the resolve she has hidden there. He blinks.
Hermione straightened up, shaking her head fiercely, “No. I’m happy to do it. We’re saving you.”
Ginny looked at Harry in trepidation “Please tell me we aren’t about to set of on a 5-mile walk”
“And Luna.” Draco said over Ginny’s indignant yell of ‘oy!’.
“Truth” Neville said cautiously.
When Hermione stopped her chanting, they all watched with lips tight as the Goblin slowly blinked his way into awareness.
?” Draco asked uncomfortably, “It’s been the norm for the last three years.”
Once upon a time a boy lived and died and died and died and died and I could do nothing but watch.
“Well,” Luna said happily, “How romantic.”
“That’s brilliant,” Hermione said, and they all congratulated her in equal measure.
“Well there isn’t a guide book exactly, is there?” Harry said, volume rising in frustration. “I just know that it was in the transfiguration book, last time. Then he put it in the cauldron”
He went silent again. Hermione pressed him gently “How did you end up…. Time travelling?”
“It is.” Harry said sharply, brooking no argument. Remus and Sirius exchanged a concerned look and Ron wondered for the first time how much they suspected of Harry’s behaviour.
“I think I can hear him.” Hermione called back. There was a soft sound of explosion from ahead.
They spent the meal happily discussing everything about Gryffindor and Hogwarts they could think of, while devouring a splendid meal. Hermione decided she was going to like Hogwarts. Even if Harry, Ron or Draco might soon decide that she was too bossy to be friends with.
Harry gets this little grin on his face. This stupid sly grin. The grin that says,
They all nodded. “Hey,” Harry said, “We’ll partner this year, eh Nev? Leave the lovebirds to it.”
. Though of course Hermione had been taught by her father never to judge a book by its cover, she figured it was probably acceptable to judge when the book seemed to spew a constant stream of absolute nonsense and grinned at the world as if it was viewing a rather charming absurdist play.
Hermione was more withdrawn around Harry in the last week of the Christmas holidays. Sure, they were spending time together constantly; Watching films, going on walks, talking mindlessly about anything and everything for hours on end. But Hermione was always cautious now.
That part of the night had been surprisingly quite educational. Hermione had begun to have doubts about the calibre of many Wizarding civil services ever since she had learned of the entire community’s existence.
I awoke stolen in this hall of mirrors. I know nothing else. I breath and I run and I stare at the stretched reflections of a lonely boy and try to find meaning in a narrative that does not care.
“Now,” He said hesitantly “Here’s the thing.”
“What is this?” Ginny whispered, wondering why Harry’s big secret had anything to do with this dying house in the middle of nowhere.
Instead he did the bad thing, because it was better than doing the good thing for bad reasons.
When she went to wash her hands Harry was hurriedly shutting his bag and standing awkwardly in front of the sinks.
“Oui.” Fleur said, dumping a stack of papers on Tonks’ desk. “I’m doing it on the ancillary nature of counter-curses.”
In almost every retelling this boy finds a mirror that shows him something he does not have.
All seven of them followed behind him as he led them to King’s Cross carpark. He stopped in front of a regular green three-door car.
“Common room.” Neville said, even though he had been going to dinner.
Sirius, who did in fact look great in a suit, smiled sideways at him. He’d been incredibly kind to Neville ever since the boy had come to live with them. “We always wanted to get married at Christmas. That was when we got together you know, over a Christmas break where only us two stayed at Hogwarts.” He stared down at the wedding preparations, eyes gazing into the past. “But I suppose August will do.”
“She isn’t the editor,” Ginny said, her usual Pansy Parkinson hatred sounding flaccid as she moved her porridge around in its bowl drably.
“So, we just wait for an hour while their down there?” Ron asked after the three champions had dived into the lake after their prizes.
didn’t lose it. It’s been lost for ages.”
Who could blame him?
In truth, she was inclined to call it divine only because she’d had the misfortune as to never have experienced it before.
That night she proceeded with her evening as she usually did and had a shower around eight pm. She always baggsied the first shower because her hair took the longest to dry, and her mum’s drying charm always made her hair go frizzy.
“Nope!” Harry crows, oddly cheerful about having lost two galleons. “Who could have predicted that game?”
They are brilliant. They almost make it.
“You shouldn’t be here, my boy.” Dumbledore concurred, his usually serene voice tight.
Harry gave the box a demonstrative poke. It shook. Harry seemed rather self-satisfied with this speech. That was until Dumbledore seemed to stump him with one croaked question.
“Oh shush,” Ron Laughed, “If Fred and George weren’t at it you’d be the one doing it.”
“Same.” Ginny said. “A girl champion would be cool.”
“I guess I just… know a lot of the stuff already” Harry said, shrugging and sitting down on a bean bag.
“I haven’t let any of it go. You’re terrible at subtlety Harry James Potter”
list.
They reached the door and Harry yanked it open, pushing Neville through. Harry dove through after- but the flames came to screaming cinders in the shape of demonic Cornish pixies.
Ron had mouthed at her with commiseration.
“Ah, my boy. I find that usually when we say something isn’t personal, it tends to be incredibly so.”
, certain that this was nothing sort of normal for wizards, she still didn’t stop staring at the boy. He was short, shorter she was sure than even she was, and terribly skinny in that way that people are when they’ve missed too many important breakfasts.
Hermione couldn’t help but like the boy, however, even if he was strange and getting stranger by the minute. When Ron had seemed ready to make biting comments in response to Hermione’s, admittedly, poor first impressions, Harry had cut him off with happy questions about muggle football, which had seemed to intrigue Ron despite his reluctance. This had segued into the current, seemingly never ending, explanation of ‘quidditch’ which Hermione thought sounded far too dangerous and a little bit redundant. Pointing out that the seeker seemed to make the whole game pointless didn’t exactly endear Ron towards her though. Harry had just laughed.
“What have you lost?” Ron said in confusion.
“Yeah but it would be way easier to explain why you know things than having to make up a million excuses.”
“I don’t hate muggles” He said, voice flat and mood clearly overcast “That isn’t what I meant”
“So you’ll rob a bank without making us tell you a thing?” Ron said dubiously.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ah” Sirius said, nerves creeping into his voice “That would be from me”
“I was in here last week,” Harry told the ghost, eyebrows raised.
“Not much use against dragons, though.” Harry muttered under his breath, eyes flicking to the great lake. Ron was the only one close enough to hear.
One day I find the end of the cavernous book shelves and I feel my own heart stop in my chest. I stopped reading the lives miles ago- just ran and ran and ran and tried to find a boy who God damn lived. But I am at my end now.
So when Ron came into the common room late from helping Fred and George (he’d been stuck with the clean-up. There were always a lot of soot marks.) and heard his name, he paused. He was only a few steps into the room, still hidden in the shadows. The only light in the room was coming from the dying fire. Two figures were partially lit, sitting in opposite armchairs.
“Harry” Ginny said, slow and clear and deliberate “If you don’t let me come with you, I’ll just follow you anyway. You know I will”
Which was how they spent Christmas eve morning with Harry revealing odd bits and pieces of his life and leaving others up in the air just to tease Ron with the mystery.
______________________
“We try to help her.” Harry said, shaking his head sadly.
“What happened in your first year?” Ron said with alarm.
Snape seemed to suddenly conclude that it would probably save him both time and sanity to just give in to the odd force that was Harry. Hermione saw this as the best course of action for self-preservation. He rifled quickly through his first, then second, desk drawers. When he found what he was looking for, he flourished it at Harry. It was a dull grey pamphlet, not embellished in any way, and Snape was holding it out loosely with as little of his hand touching as if he thought Harry’s general madness might infect him.
“What do we call you?” Seamus asked jovially.
When Harry had paced three times he stopped and turned to the wall opposite the tapestry triumphantly. Ron and Hermione turned too and-
“Next time, eh Weasley?” He’d said, before asking Ron’s opinion on some famous Chess controversy or something else Hermione had no interest in.
Ginny could remember being told about fae, who were seen as half fiction and half fact by many wizards and who had supposedly gone extinct long before the time of Merlin. She knew that that was why wizards often still hung iron horseshoes above their doors or wore iron jewellery if they were particularly suspicious.
Harry laughed at him, shoving his shoulder. “I mean yeah if you want. I’ve taught Hermione some basics, but she can’t stand it. If you promise to keep your mouth closed when you eat.”
She could see a copse of trees ahead of them, and this was where they eventually came to a stop. In the dark cluster of trees was a dilapidated house.
She and Hermione had grown closer in their stay. Luna had often felt that Hermione was close-minded, and she knew that Hermione in return saw her as supercilious. But as they spent more time together one-on-one Luna began to understand the older girl more. Hermione had a softer side, one that was egregiously hidden by a thick membrane of self-protection and insecurity. It wasn’t a refusal to believe in the outlandish that had her judging Luna, it was a refusal to believe in the outlandish- or anything at all- without proof. Hermione looked at the whole world as a court room with she as the constantly deliberating jury.
“He’s got a point” Draco said, which got him a few looks. Luna sort of suspected that he was just agreeing with Harry for the sake of it. He shrugged under everyone’s doubtful looks “What? I want to see the next Star War too. I want to know what happens to Hans Solo”
You couldn’t be a useless, bumbling fool if somebody wanted to be your friend. That had to make you worth something.
Harry shuddered and made an odd face, “I think we should all be very glad we got the Hogwarts champion we did.”
Harry squinted at her “Nothing. Schoolwork”
Harry sighed, “Maybe.” He stood up. “I’m going to bed, you?”
The sorting hat smelled like mildew. Hermione was focusing on this instead of her overwhelming fear that the hat was going to touch her head and immediately scream that she being there had been a mistake, that Hermione wasn’t really magical at all, and that actually she was so ordinary that no one should really ever bother with her at all. Then she was pretty sure she would have to be executed by the wizard with the impressive long beard for seeing things she wasn’t actually worthy of seeing.
Ginny zoned out then, sitting with Luna on the wide steps before Gringotts while everyone else filed into the bank to go about their business.
I think it is too much to hope.
“Not sure what you did last time.” Harry said casually, then his eyes widened, “Erm. I mean. Not that I—”
“Cessabit ignis,” Neville screamed, sweat and tears rolling down his face from the heat and the terror. “Cessabit ignis.”
Harry looked at her, seemed to remember she was there, and winced. “Erm.” The greatest seer of all time said “It’s going to snow this Christmas.”
“You should. It isn’t a weapon. All it says is that the one to defeat the dark lord could have been any baby born in July with ballsy parents, and Voldemort picked me.”
“S’pose we’re lucky death eaters only hate us for our blood not our skin.” Harrys says bitterly.
But Harry hadn’t done a single not weird thing since Hermione had met him and so she thought that was neither here nor there.
I’m sorry,” He cleared his throat, “I’m stupidly fucking sorry.”
Ron shivered. “He’s right ‘Mione. You were always terrifyingly competent.”
I can’t believe you did that”
“You can’t,” Hermione said immediately, “We can’t tell you—”
“What are we going to do?” Luna said, looking up at Harry intently.
“Harry” She cried, and he spun around, eyes wide.
None of them answered, each of them deep in thought.
. Bored of finding them and having heavy silences descend on the room. Of knowing they had a secret but not knowing what it was.
Neville wasn’t a part of the wedding Party. In fact, the only people Sirius and Remus had standing up with them was Harry, on Remus’ left, and Tonks who was stood next to Sirius. Andromeda Tonks, nee Black, was officiating for them.
He paused. He wasn’t proud of it, but he paused.
Hermione, who hadn’t noticed him arrive or sit down, looked up at him in surprise. Her hair was frazzled around her ace and Ron guessed she had been tugging at it, the way she did when she was in deep concentration. She looked around wildly at Krum, blinked owlishly at him a few times and then let out a small huff. The sight of her, frizzy hair and all, send odd shivers through his body.
The first time Ginny actually saw Harry Potter, it was only a glimpse through steam and shifting bodies on the Hogwarts train platform. She’d only realised that the boy had been Harry Potter when George had pointed him out to her under his breathe while mum lectured Ron about sandwiches or something. Ginny had craned her neck to see him again, but he’d vanished. A few months later Ron sent their mother a picture of his friends and him in front of the lake, which she had leaned up on the kitchen window sill behind a mug. It was a picture of four people, standing outside looking decidedly windswept. There, between Ron and a girl with dark skin and a mass of curly black hair, had been Harry Potter.
Ron joked, then quickly dropped his smile when Hermione gave him a look like a Cruciatus curse.
Harry let out a small breath but didn’t relax. “Did you just hear me call you? Or is elf magic as cool as the books said it was?” Harry said with a false lightness.
Ron had never spent Christmas at Hogwarts before. When he’d mentioned this to Harry the chaotic boy had blinked slowly for a long moment, as if blinking away a film from his eyes, and then grinned widely.
“Luna.” Harry said simply, “Asked her at breakfast. She says she has an absolutely ravishing pair of fruit earrings.”
Ginny Weasley was poor. Ginny Weasley was last. Ginny Weasley was a girl. Any number of reasons, but they all boiled down to this; Ginny Weasley was not enough.
“Merci, ma petite fleurs.” Fleur said, smiling beatifically. She reminded Ron of a fairy queen greeting her subjects.
And on top of all that, Harry and Ron refused to stop yacking to him about quidditch despite the first match going swimmingly.
She lets the memory wash over and into her. Luna is four years old and her mother is singing Joni Mitchell to her in her laboratory and inventing a spell she says will save the world and everything is okay, and Luna has never known anything but peace.
Ron shifted his jaw uncomfortably, “She probably has someone else to go with, right?”
“What is this place?” She asked again.
“Tell me.” Ron said, grinning back.
“There should be an identical one next to it for Luna” Lupin said. He had a lap full of fluffy ginger cat and seemed perfectly content to sit back as Harry played Christmas elf to them all.
“Truth” Harry said cautiously.
Ginny sighs, and angrily smashes the stone she’s holding back into the ground. It makes a satisfying thump against the dry mud. For a second, she imagines throwing rocks at her brothers, but shakes that away as slightly too psychotic for comfort.  Instead she just gets up, brushes down her school skirt which she hadn’t even had the time to change out of yet, and begins to make her way back to the castle.
Harry shook his head, lips pursed. He was staring intently at the door, wand held high but no sound coming from his mouth. Finally, the door glowed a soft purple, then sunk into the stone as if it had never been there. Neville gaped.
“Fine” Ron sighed, long-suffering “But I am not answering any questions about girly stuff”
who thought it was acceptable not to turn up to lessons and who relied too much on their unearned fame. Snape seemed rather agitated by Harry’s obvious wish to avoid him and spoiled for a fight any time Harry mistakenly made himself present in the bat-like teacher’s vicinity.
sor--“
They let a few moments slip by in silence, a quiet funeral for something none of them quite understood. Perhaps it was the unknowable concept of childhood, lost to each of them as they resolved to fight a war no one else even knew about.
He looked at her for a moment, brow pursed in thought. “Your mum and dad are called Jean and Patrick. Your first pet was a gerbil called Mr Darcy who went behind the sofa and was never seen again. Your first act of accidental magic was to make your library card say you were allowed unlimited books on loan. The librarian thought you must be a brilliant forger and banned you from the grown-up books for three weeks.”
And wrackspurts, of course.
Ron Weasley is the sixth son of a second son. The storybooks will tell you that there is nothing special about this. They’d be right. There is nothing special about Ronald Weasley’s birth.
About two-thirds of the room but their hands up, with the other third following reluctantly out of peer pressure.
“He’s always skinny” Ron said, shooting Ginny an exasperated and commiserating eye roll. Ginny giggled quietly. He came to stand by her, and she passed him a bread roll from the bowl on the counter. They both settled in to wait for their mother to stop fussing, even though they both knew it could take hours.
“Because I’m Ron’s little sister” Ginny said, not meaning anything by it but simply stating a fact in her shocked state.
Neville’s heart didn’t stop racing for five hours.
Hermione and Ron shared a look, and then nodded. Split up and look for clues it was then. It was a good thing she’d always held Velma as a sort of personal hero.
“That Atmospheric charm was inspired.” Hermione said, looking awed.
The truth is, what? He thought desperately, but the worry was soon overlapped by the rushing tide of sleep.
Neville snorted, “Your life. Mine’s normal.”
“Harry. What?” She hissed.
This is how Luna knows that Draco Malfoy is going to be her True Friend. It’s also why she feels comfortable laughing and calling him an idiot when she goes to visit him in the hospital.
“Yeah” Ginny huffed “But not to us. We can’t vote, we’re in school. Why should it be the only thing everyone in the entire school can talk about?”
Hermione had chosen the sort of gift that she thought Draco would like the most. Ron had said that it was too boring to be a present, but then again Hermione and Draco tended to be pretty boring to anyone who didn’t understand him. The sparkly wrapping paper fell away to reveal a beautifully bound set of Alberta Toothill’s
Hermione would swear until her dying day, she was sure, that the boy mouthed her name in shock.
“Nope” Sirius said, popping the ‘P’ “And instead of lousy France you get the unrefined Lupin-Black Holiday experience. C’est la vie! Strap in kids”
She held out her hands to pause them after they’d arrived back at the shrieking shack “Why were you in my bedroom last year? I know you took something, I just don’t know what”
“Have a little tact ‘Mione.” Ron said, snorting lightly. “That was a house elf. They’re like—for cleaning houses and doing wizards’ bidding and stuff. Only really rich or really old families have them.”
Ron could see that there was a blush blooming under her brown skin. He was also aware that he was gaping like an idiot.
It started with the first edition of the Hogwarts Oracle. It’s editors and writers had waited until the end of the month so that everyone could catch up on their work and prepare for the first edition of the year, but it was anticipated with much impatience. When it was distributed, nary a hand went unclutching of a copy across the whole school.
“I,” The goblin began, looking baffled. Then his expression cleared out into its usual professional distaste, “Not to worry. Sometimes there’s something that needs to be cleared up ahead and all the carts are stopped. We can keep going now, I’m sure.”
“I need to get to dinner.” Another familiar voice said tersely. Neville frowned. He knew for a fact that Harry had just left after having dinner in the great hall with their group.
Tonks gave an exaggerated shudder, “Gods no. You’re all good kids, sure, but I am not a teacher.”
Harry huffed out a little laugh, “I’ve been down there before.”
Sir Terry Pratchett, Witches Abroad
waterloo
Harry smiled a little more brightly at her, “You wont mind if we keep the whole seer thing between us?”
Yes. The Hogwarts Oracle shortly found itself to be a more popular publication among the Castle population than any established newspaper, and on print day hardly a student could be found without a paper in their hands.
They all froze again, looking at him warily.
mum said. She was patting her hair nervously
Morality was infinitely complex, Neville thought. Mostly he felt an overwhelming desire to go back to bed.
Harry looked back at her with a cheeky grin and tapped his nose. “Ixnay on the uestion-qay, Hermione.”
“There hasn’t been a day in your life you haven’t channelled Marc Bolan.” Remus said, voice frazzled.
“He’s reliving the seventies.” Remus said with an exaggerated exhaustion.
Luna agreed with this. The wireless never even played anything good. She hadn’t heard David Bowie on there even once.
“I don’t know how to begin.” Harry said softly.
Instead, he could hear the haughty, practically RP, accent floating out of the mirror and he connected that particular lazy smile of Harry's to the only person it was ever directed at.
Hermione thought this was a bit rich coming from a teacher that hardly ever heard Harry talk, but the professor seemed to hold a grudge against Harry. Hermione tried to catch Harry’s eye to check if he was alright. Not, as she suspected was the case, possessed.
Draco had followed them to their tent in the after-game commotion, but he’d been gone for a few hours now. Knowing Lucius Malfoy he already had gold leaf adorned missing posters hung up.
“Was that—” He couldn’t believe it, “Did you just do non-verbal magic?”
“Sorry about all this,” He said to the whole group of them over Neville’s shoulder.
“I guess you get it.” Neville whispered, not being able to look at Harry.
Harry winced, “You aren’t going to listen to me if I tell you it’s just a really big spider I caught, right?” He sighed at her continued look of disbelief. “No, I didn’t think that one would work on you, Hermione."
Once, he dies of the flu in a cupboard under the stairs because his uncle insisted it was just a cold. He is a child.
She paused just outside the door to see if she could hear anything. If Ron was in her room
They burn and I cannot watch them anymore. They burn and I cannot shed enough tears to put them out.
Fleur’s eyes lit up, seemingly oblivious to the dozen saucer-eyes trained directly on her, “You speak French?”
He couldn’t even think it.
“It’s a good thing there’s no Quidditch this year.” Ron had remarked, plonking another dusty tome on the ‘done’ pile. From the whole book he’d only managed to find a page and a half of slightly relevant information. Plus, he’d stretched pretty far for a lot of it. He labelled the parchment now, placing it onto the notes stack. Hermione was pretty into stacks when it came to research. “Merlin I hardly have time to eat.”
“Can’t believe its dragons.” Said Neville with a shudder.
Neville shook his head, “I don’t like you. And you don’t like me.”
“Why would we be governmentally trained spies if the government is who we’re spying on?” Hermione said, looking at her boyfriend with judgement, Ron just shrugged, going back to throwing Harry’s stuffed quaffel cushion into the air.
“And they don’t think I am?”
“If only we could say it was wizards.” Harry sighed.
“I think she has a crush on Susan Sarandon,” Luna said serenely.
“Look” Luna said dreamily, pulling out the never-ending Lolly-pop that Hermione had gotten her “There’s still one present left”
“Ah!” Harry said, wiggling his finger like he was Sherlock Holmes explaining the case to a befuddled John Watson. “That’s what he
Ron suggested the sleepover a few weeks before exams and they decided to hold it on Friday. The Gryffindor bunch trekked over to pick up Draco and Luna from Ravenclaw, and they filed in a line of two’s towards the room of requirement- ducklings trailing behind Harry.
Ron saw Sirius shoulders shrug in the embers, “Who knows? But it’s safer to follow up on every sighting.”
“Yeah.” Ron said with a sigh. “I’ll be boring and fiscally responsible or whatever.”
Neville was stoic, his initial tears replaced with a strength Ron had not expected. Ron should have known. Neville was a Gryffindor. He was a stronger person than any of them knew. Sirius and Remus had stepped up immediately to take him in and so he would be going home with Harry. Ron wondered what the mood of Grimmauld place would be like that summer. He wondered if his mum would even let him go over to see them, or if she would keep them all barricaded in fear.
Hermione giggles darkly, “Yes. Terribly
“Oh, bloody hell.” Ron said, head under his four-poster. “I haven’t a clue where my nice shoes are.”
“It just isn’t safe.” Harry muttered, looking shifty, “The more people who know, the more dangerous it is.
By the time she drifted off to sleep she had come up with two answers. The first was an easy one; she had never let anything go in her life. The second was harder.
“Draco has a lot to do with it.” Ron said, when Neville brought it up.
“You must be Hermione’s parents” Mum said, holding out her hand and shaking Hermione’s mum’s hand vigorously. “I’m Molly Weasley, Ron’s mum”
Neville stayed silent, eyes watching the still glass of the lake.
Harry had then suggested the solution; that the group became a study group/society for Hogwarts other failing subject; Muggle studies. Luna wasn’t personally sure of the calibre of the muggle studies pedagogy, due to it being a third year and above elective, but she took many of the older students’ words to heart. Apparently Professor Burbage tried her best, and came from a place of genuine kind heartedness, but often times missed the mark.
______________________
“London?” Hermione said, looking up in actual interest, “What ever for?”
Harry lead Neville into a girl’s bathroom.
Christmas was a strange affair, then. Odd days of sitting sequestered in one of the bedrooms or trapped outside in the yard.
“‘let’ is too strong a word” Professor Lupin said with clear pain. He sighed and walked to the bottom of the stairs “Padfoot! We’re home!” He hollered.
“You said she broke out last time.” Hermione said with worry.
“Does it hold any water?” Harry asked.
Draco was blushing happily as he took the gift “You really didn’t have to do this for me, you guys”
“Um,” She hedged, lightly, “May I offer you a Tunnock bar for your troubles?”
Their first lesson, and the many which followed after, proved that though she may be young, Fleur Delacour was astoundingly competent. And terrifyingly good at curses.
“Oh, shit” Harry muttered under his breathe, so quiet that only Ginny and Hermione, who were stood closest to him, heard. Ginny giggled but Hermione scowled and elbowed him lightly.
“Don’t.” Harry croaked, standing still. He clutched his hair at the roots, rubbing his eye sockets with the butt of his hands. He seemed wrecked “Don’t.”
He frowned, placing his wand on the desk so that it would illuminate the pages. He picked up one of the pieces of scrap paper. In Hermione’s, and it must have been Hermione’s, handwriting it was scrawled
Harry nodded, “She followed me in second year. She comes down to feed Beverly with me sometimes.”
“Anyway. Sorry Ginny!” Harry called, smiling at her slightly desperately.
(Harry took a sip of it when she left the room and gagged. “You could stand something up on this stuff.”)
The extended Weasley bunch, Hermione and Neville all stared at Harry’s guardian with confusion.
“She’s just taking care of some stuff for me” Harry said, as if this wasn’t a shady thing to say “I was just making sure it was okay”
“She does seem very smart,” Neville said quietly, “She spent a lot of mentoring time with Tonks.”
“Kassandra pushed us to do an Oracle special for tomorrow morning. She asked me to write the cover piece,” Luna said, looking pleased.
It was a nice quote. Pretty calligraphy.
A side effect of befriending Harry Potter at an impressionable age was that you became naturally inclined to eavesdropping. Every time you heard your name around a corner or through library stacks you became conditioned to pause and listen instead of to confront.
“Have you read Kant’s essays on that?” Tonks said animatedly, looking up from Fleur’s pages.
Harry gave a slight shudder. Ron wondered what he was thinking about.
Fleur smiled at her charmingly, “I am focused on the spell making theory. Partially philosophical and functional, also. I am very interested in the ontological approach to spell making.”
“Did you finish it?” Ginny asked, and Neville looked away from Harry. Ginny was directing her question at an ethereal Luna, who was backlit by the pink sunset. Both Luna and Hermione’s hair had frizzed up in the heat. Ginny’s was piled atop her head.
“Thank you, poppet,” Her dad called back. She could here the repetitive click-clack of her dad’s magical type-writer. He must be writing a new article.
“What did you want to talk about?” Hermione said, in a falsely light tone.
Pandora hadn’t been like Molly Weasley. That’s what Luna remembers. Where Molly Weasley was brilliant in a softer way, Pandora had been all sharp edges. Sincere and unfailingly honest with Luna. Tidy in every place but her lab which sat at the bottom of their rook house. Luna would sit, feet dangling, on whichever work bench Pandora wasn’t working on, padded out in a bubble of protection charms, and ask a million questions. Pandora would answer every single question with the same brutal honesty, regardless of whether it was age appropriate for how ever old Luna was at the time. Pandora Lovegood did not believe in censoring the world for Luna.
Ron sighed and braced himself.
Hermione, Ron and Harry were in fact planning on breaking into Gringotts.
Harry looked doubtful but shrugged “Well I mean yeah, if anyone’s interested in that I could suggest some books”
The residents of the kitchen all stared at each other in confusion, though after Ron went and talked to him, they all agreed not to mention it to his face again.
“We’re on a mission for Dumbledore. It’s to do with Voldemort” Harry said calmly, and because she was still staring at the house Ginny missed the surprised look Hermione shot him.
“What about you, then?” He asked, voice sly.
“What’s that about” George said, as their mother rummaged busily through her seemingly endless handbag.
The three conspirators shared one final look of conspiracy, then Harry sighed, taking the satchel off of Hermione’s shoulder and pulling out the contents.
“Can I come, too?” She said.
Neville was in Harry’s face, he was screaming. His eyes were watering, from the fire or form emotion Neville didn’t know. “I’m sorry,” Harry croaked. He looked distraught.
The ball was everything promised by the professors- beautiful icicle decorations, a dazzling dance floor, grand and towering Christmas trees. The hall looked positively transformed.
Draco stared at the map on the floor with bewilderment “When did you even get this?”
Harry was grinning at their mum with unbridled joy. “Hello Mrs Weasley”
Right after they’d breached the water, as his stomach flipped over and over at the rapid decline, Neville had craned his neck fiercely to see a row of steep steps leading down to the floor of vaults.
It’s a marvellous wonder that a human being can be a generally happy person despite, under it all, not really being that at all.
“No” He said softly “No, Luna. I don’t think there is”
“What’s all that for?” He asked, tomato ketchup from his bacon butty landing sloppily on his chin.
But as he moved across the room, he noticed another figure lingering in the stacks. He gave a small yelp of surprise and hurried over to Hermione’s side.
“Because I want to know what you’re up to. I’ve wanted to know all year” The other two exchange a weighted look. Ginny hesitates “And because I can help. I’m a better witch than people think”
“You appeared out of no where on Platform 9 and ¾ last September, eleven years old again” Hermione supplied, mind flickering back to the first time she’d seen Harry all the way back at the beginning of the year.
“It’s a book about the first woman to win the All-England Duelling competition in history. And she was one of the greatest duellers of all time. These books have some of the best duelling tips in the genre, but most people look them over because they’re written by a woman” Draco said, absorbed in feeling the spines of the book.
But he didn’t hold out much hope.
“Harry, they’ll get in.” Neville said desperately.
“Finish what?” Ron asked curiously, sprawling out with his head in Hermione’s lap.
“Oh yeah” Ginny taunted “What’s your big secret then, Ronniekins?”
” Hermione cried, flinging her arms up in the air.
Malfoy looked as if all balance had once again been restored to his world. “Ha! You didn’t even
On to fifth year, he supposed wearily. How much could go wrong this year?
- trial and investigation.
“You two are being weird. Again.” Ron said, glaring at them.
Fleur jumped to her feet; hands clutched to her heart. She lets out a desperate noise.
The worked tirelessly throughout January and February, buried in the library researching dark rituals any time they weren’t doing their actual homework.
Neville followed him blindly and was pulled into an empty classroom. Neville recognised it as the classroom they had had charms in in second year, before one of Seamus’ explosions had scorched the walls. The scorch marks were still clearly there.
“Let’s hope they also got taught defensive magic too.” Ginny said shrewdly.
“I’d never be a danger to your kids. Mol” Si said, slightly reproachful.
ry.” Ron teased. “Last term alone you got a teacher fired, found a man who everyone had assumed dead for a decade and discovered the Lost Diadem of Rowena Ravenclaw. Which, by the way, you still haven’t told us what you did with. You’re always planning.”
“You’re the one calling for his liberation” Draco shot across.
“Bet mum wasn’t happy.” Ron said, purposefully avoiding the tight feeling Harry’s words had caused in his chest.
“Actually I dropped dangerous magical objects down a password operated secret passage way hidden in a girls lavatory” Harry said, voice sarcastic even though she was sure it was the truth.
When she’d finished eating, Harry spoke. As if Luna was a fairy creature that needed to be presented with gifts so she wouldn’t bite his head off.
"Okay" Neville drawled doubtfully, but everyone was obviously too exhausted to push the issue further than that.
“Ever the charmer, Ronald.” Draco teased. He’d snuck his way into Gryffindor tower an hour earlier and had spent the last forty minutes roundly beating Harry at Chess on Harry’s bed. Harry looked flushed though Ron didn’t have any notion as to why.
Sirius had been released by the ministry under conditions, Harry told them. He had to report to his probation officer weekly and couldn’t leave the country. A lock had been placed on his wand so that he would only be able to use minor spells. He wouldn’t be completely exonerated of his crimes and allowed to live a free life until Peter had been given a trial and officially convicted of the crime. Harry informed her that Dumbledore had fought for this situation, as the ministry had wanted to keep Sirius in prison until the trial was over, even though that could take months. It was the only time Hermione had seen Harry look anything but wary towards the headmaster.
“Luna dear, is that you?” A warm voice asked. Luna looked up to find Molly Weasley standing above her, arms full of brown paper bags, with a concerned smile on her face.
since then.”
Eventually they turned off from the main lane and ducked through a gap in the hedge. The path they followed after that was winding and sloped and Ginny found herself almost tripping twice on the uneven ground. She blushed furiously each time, annoyed at herself for being the burden she was sure Harry and Hermione thought she was.
Hermione had managed to lure Harry into an abandoned class room by half past nine, after she’d nagged him sufficiently enough that he’d finally packed his things. She was ashamed to admit that she used the exact same boggart excuse as she’d used on Draco. Thankfully being reckless was Harry’s bread and butter and so he happily stepped foot into the empty room.
thanks for reading. up next: Neville. we in the home stretch boys.
“What was he doing?”
Ron hadn’t known that. The reminder of yet another thing Harry hadn’t thought it important to tell Ron twisted the knife in even further.
Harry wandered back into the chambers a long half an hour later. Neville’s thought had eventually turned to the ministry coup, and his spirits had been thoroughly dampened. Almost as damp as this whole place was.
Two hours later, after the unsettling reveal of the Grown-Man-Trapped-In-A-Box who was possibly a murder suspect, a drawn-out discussion that Harry had looked bored throughout, and the arrival of a myriad of ministry officials, Hermione and Harry were finally off to bed.
Neville stared at Harry with deep worry, “Who on earth is Beverly?”
“You were excellent.” Ginny gushed, holding out her hand for a high five which Fleur gave with bemusement.
“A summer wedding.” Sirius said, coming to stand next to Neville where the lanky boy (he’d shot up four inches in the past few months. He wondered, morbidly and with great guilt, if it was due to a sudden lack of crushing parental pressure. Then he went back to missing his Grandmother a lot.) was staring out of the window at the usually skinny yard. Now it was big enough to fit over one hundred guests. And it would do just that in less than an hour. “Never thought I’d see the day.”
DA meetings were becoming less fun and more serious every week. Muggle movie nights were switched out with curses and self-defence lessons. With morbid readings of that week’s sad series of events.
thank you so much for the support
“What?” Hermione shrieked, flinging her hands in the air.
It was a better day than it could have been, even if it wasn’t good.
They didn’t stop holding hands even when the others traipsed out of the bank, or while they walked down the street, or in every shop they stopped in to get second hand school supplies, or even when they entered the crowded bookshop. Ginny didn’t do it purposely, but the warm weight of Luna’s hand in hers was oddly comforting.
Ron laughed, shoulders relaxing slightly at the familiar banter of his closest friends. “She has a point, mate.”
“Can you not see who this is?” Harry said exasperatedly, gesturing at the indolent man with his foot. Ron didn’t think Harry quite had the upper hand to be acting all inconvenienced about this. “It’s Ba-“
Everyone clapped lightly and the two boys stepped forward. They spent the next half hour demonstrating the stunning charm and explaining the theory behind it. It was pretty funny to watch the two fifth years bicker with each other, especially because she knew the two were actually good friends.
, Harry. Don’t be dense. You have to tell the
“Yeah,” Sirius sighed, “The twins, you’ll share. Then the fifth-year boys are in Harry’s room. Sorry. Hermione and Ginny can have Reg’s old room.”
Harry headed up the stairs, so only Ginny was present to hear Hermione mutter to herself “Or so much worse”
“Harry” Mrs. Granger called up the stairs, sounding confused “Ron, Hermione. Come downstairs a minute”
She had looked determined as she had perfected a by-the-book swan dive into the lake, bubble-head charm in place. Krum and Diggory were only half a step behind, their own various charms in place.
“Happy Valentines day Ginevra” Luna said softly and after a quiet beat she craned her head slightly and kissed Ginny softly on the cheek.
Ginny stared at the paper in shock, and then peered down the table to where Harry was sat with his three ever present shadows. Draco was brandishing a paper in Harry’s face wildly, looking frantic. Hermione had her head on the table, her hair forming a cloud which threatened to encroach on the jam pot. Her brother just looked like he’d completely lost the plot.
_______________________
When she saw Luna at the garden gate, her yellow hair whipping around gently in the summer breeze, her heart swelled with excitement. For the rest of that sunshine-bathed evening Ginny never thought of Harry Potter at all.
“Right.” Harry said in a far too calm voice. “The elf was an accident.”
“Well,” Hermione said lightly, “Breaking out the old-fashioned way it is."
“Especially those in power with active death eater sympathies.” Hermione said, looking at Draco cautiously. “Sorry, Draco.”
“Draco is terrible.” He huffed, pushing his long blonde hair back harshly. “I can’t make up an excuse to get there. Mother wants to floo to York, today of all days, and get tea together.”
Well. What if his mum had paid him the kind of attention she paid his brothers? Would he be a prodigy too?
Luna nodded. “It’s called Utilitarianism” Luna said, because thankfully for Harry she had actually read a book on muggle ethics. “It’s a Victorian theory suggested by a muggle philosopher called Bentham. It posits that the most ethical thing to do is the thing that brings the most happiness to the greatest number of people”
Hermione winced slightly at the name, but let it pass, “Oh.” She said softly. Despite her many skills, comforting other people wasn’t one of them. She liked cold, hard facts and often didn’t know what to do or how to react when those cold, hard facts revealed sad, uncomfortable truths.
Peter Pettigrew is a small man, at least a foot shorter than her daddy is. Next to willowy Lupin he looks miniscule. He doesn’t carry shortness the way Sirius does- with stocky surety and a personality to make up the extra inches. He wears it like a disfigurement. Like it’s something he is hallowed by.
“Go on.” Harry said grimly, and, in that moment, Ron could see the much older person hiding behind his best friends’ eyes.
“She’s harmless.” Harrys aid simply, as if a basilisk wasn’t an XXXXX classified beast.
“And they believe you.” Ron said sceptically.
God, she hated it when Harry was right.
Then, when Harry finally lifted his head to respond to Hermione with a scowl, she heard his shout.
“Or a missing magical artefact directory, apparently.” Ron said drily.
“Draco asked me where I was going, again.” Hermione said, her voice pinched.
The man’s voice is wheedling. He’s clearly desperate, though Luna doesn’t blame him. There are at least a dozen people towering over him. Harry stands just behind his guardians, face stony. Dumbledore as well as three Aurors and a ministry official are also clustered around, though in far more official capacity than that of Luna and her friends. The ministry official they sent was Fudge. He keeps sending murderous glares at both Dumbledore and Sirius.
