Harry placed a hand on Hermione's arm as she resumed her place next to him and he gave her a grin, which she returned half-heartedly, a frustrated look in her eyes. Harry smiled as he realized she was annoyed for having lost the duel. He hid his relief as Neville whispered his amazement at the spells, Seamus thanked her for going first and Ron smugly kept silent even as Hermione glared at him. With a glance at the innocent clear bag on Professor Opacre's desk, Harry thought it could have gone a lot worse.
“Surely you must have found something,” Fudge said after he shuffled towards Dumbledore and focused on Jonas.  “You have had excellent work with magical maladies, specifically splinching and - ”
Harry looked at Draco again.  Despite the wary look he was giving the twins, his hand never moved from resting lightly against the small of Harry’s back, warm and solid and pleasant.
Eyes flickered before opening slowly and tiredly. Sleepy jade eyes blinked softly up at the sterilized white ceiling.
Qye stilled in opening the book before continuing to the table of contents.  “Just because I was ten when I was locked away doesn’t mean anything.”  He slammed the book shut and shoved it back into place.  “Just that I lost years of my life.”
He saw the Hufflepuffs, led by Professor Sprout, move their way towards the stairs and saw the chance to slip around them.  He tightened his hold on Hermione and made sure no one was looking as he edged towards them.
“Oh, that sounds great,” Sirius cut in, frowning, shaking off his surprise.  “I’m sure you’ll be telling whoever exactly what to say and do - ”
“Do you damn well say anything else?!” Malfoy snapped as he slipped around a vampire who threw a punch at him and broke another wall, sending old stone crumbling down.  The vampire pulled his arm out and flicked his fingers at Malfoy, who grimaced and shook his head before snarling and throwing a Cutting Curse at him.
“Oh,” he said.  Leaning away, he looked back at his cousin.  There was silence in the room again, Saira and Leon looking at their liege in new understanding, Marylin in pity and what appeared slight anger, and Verna with amusement.  Jacob was still scowling at the tabletop and Krista was still shamefaced.  Jordan just looked at his cousin.
And then he felt a similar sickness and shock, distress, the imaginary shaking of another person who wasn’t actually…
:: Qye said sweetly. There was a pause as Harry struggled with the task of putting his clothes on properly. ::
“Go,” Snape repeated and started down the path Draco had taken earlier.  “Better for you both to get this over with.”
Ron stopped in the middle of arguing with Hermione and blinked in confusion.  Raising an eyebrow, he looked at the Slytherin table.  “Oh yes,” he quietly cheered, hope rising in his eyes.  “Please,
:: he replied softly.  Darkness once again began to surround him and he welcomed the freedom from the confusion gratefully.
Harry’s mind was whirling with the influx of new information, barely mindful of Qye silently listening in.  A thought struck him and he frowned at Draco.  “Wait…if wizards and vampires have really had this animosity all this time, why did your father try to tie you in?”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded and flushed a bit when he remembered staring at the large box he found at the end of his bed on Christmas.
“Harry?” he whispered and he wondered at the hoarseness of his voice, the trembling quality of it and cleared his throat softly, suddenly realizing how parched he was, how hungry and sore and generally weak he felt and he made himself let go of Harry, bracing his hand down on the bed and slowly standing on his legs.
“Get the hell out, Lest,” Qye said softly, venomously, looking away to Harry whose eyes were falling shut.
There was a tense silence for a moment, Harry staring down at the plain white coverings, Ron standing awkwardly by the bed, Hermione sitting on the edge. Finally, the girl let out a tired sigh.
“I don’t either,” Snape said quietly. “But they have done nothing – I can assure you of that, I’ve been keeping my eyes on them – so there’s no reason to fret yet.” Glancing at his protégé, he grimaced as he identified the reason as to why the blond was still tense. “And despite their interest in your Golden Boy, there’s nothing they can do to him. He’s one of the most protected people in the world and Dumbledore has plenty of eyes keeping tabs on him. I don’t see any way for them to do anything to him.” Draco continued to stay silent and Snape sighed, dropping his hand.
“Just because you don’t plan on being a Healer doesn’t mean you shouldn’t know the basics of simple healing potions,” Hermione sniffed.  Snape had told them that this year they would be focusing on healing potions, both for mind and body.  Today they had brewed a basic potion for healing minor infections.  (Harry’s had been going alright until Malfoy had dropped an extra diamond-lily weed, which caused it to turn bright yellow instead of a soft violet.  Needless to say, Harry had gotten a low score today.)
He couldn’t help the slight smile when he saw Lest’s back stiffen, Myn turning her head slightly to blink at him with a puzzled look on her face. He didn’t notice the surprised looks on Granger and Weasley’s faces.
Ron who, while Harry had been chatting with Draco, had taken a few steps away and calmly talked with Dean and Neville.  Hermione had been standing next to him, a puzzled but pleased expression on her face.  It had gotten stranger when Draco flicked him on the shoulder to catch his attention again, drawing a surprised sound from Harry, which had in turn made Ron turn to look at him.
Draco tilted his head at him as he leaned carefully against one of the old fence posts.  “You willing to hear me this time?  You didn’t seem too open to it last time when I warned you about Opacre.”
“Hold on,” he mumbled, turning to look at her pale face while he fought back his own nerves.  “They’re - ”
Jerking, both of them moved away from each other, Malfoy releasing his hold on Harry.  The green-eyed boy blushed furiously, placing his hand in his lap, his eyes fixed firmly on the tabletop while his heart hammered in his chest.
Silver eyes darkened to mercury. Opacre was not going to win again. Not now, not with this. He may lose at everything else but he wasn't about to lose this.
“Harry, stay with me,” Dumbledore urged softly but he couldn’t hold on. As the world began to fade, he fought for a little strength to let Dumbledore know one last thing, feeling as though if he didn’t tell him right now, he wouldn’t be able to tell him later.
Shaking his head from the first meal he had in months, he recalled what happened next with a slight smirk. Pomfrey had picked up the tray with a satisfied smile and Qye had watched her magic it away. She then prodded and tested him for an hour or two, to Qye’s annoyance, trying to find the reason to his (Harry’s) speedy recovery. Finding nothing, she huffed and temporarily gave up, to Qye’s relief. She went away but kept her eye on him so much that he was confined to the damn bed. It wasn’t until after lunch – a meal he ate with just as much relish as breakfast – that he found his chance. After finishing his meal, she sternly told him to lie in bed and rest – to which he responded innocently and meekly – and then returned to her office. He had waited a full minute after hearing her office door close, then jumped out of bed, hastily changed into Harry’s clothes lying at the end of the bed, and fled the Infirmary with a victorious smile.
“Never had a need before you came,” she mumbled and he shot her a dirty and unamused look. Refraining from rolling her eyes, she turned a stern look to the two uneasy Gryffindors. “Now, is there a reason why you two are rushing through the corridors without looking where you are going?”
“I thought so,” Smethwyck said quietly and Qye gave him a grudgingly grateful nod as he moved his wand over to Qye.  “Okay, we really need to get you both back in bed, there’s healthy and there’s pushing it and we are incredibly beyond pushing it.”
Harry tilted his head slightly, confusion increasing when he saw Hermione shoot a longer glance at Ron with what he thought might be a rosy tint staining her cheeks.
Qye shrugged nervously. “Seems I do.” The nurse continued to stare at him suspiciously and he swallowed, maintaining his weak grin. “Well…since I’m better…can I go now?” She had ruined his cover so he might as well enjoy physical freedom for as long as he could. He didn’t exactly fancy spending his first day after having no body for months cooped up in the Infirmary.
:: he thought, panicked.  His eyes shot open, bright green eyes flashing in the darkness of the room.
Harry couldn't even begin to explain the rush of pleasure that flooded him as Lest's eyes widened in shock and he
His eyes widened and he stumbled back, his hands flying up to grasp his throbbing head.  The pulsing had grown, stronger and louder and harder, so hard his mind reeled back from it.  It felt like someone had punched him in the mind and he gasped.  He could vaguely hear murmurs in the classroom but the pulse had grown and -
“They’re all ‘only trying to help’,” Qye scoffed, standing up and pacing the space between their beds.  “Trying to bloody help get to what they want instead of what we do.”
Qye eyed her and glanced back at Harry.  After a moment, he shrugged and she nodded before turning again to Harry.  When Harry still didn’t look at her, she nodded again as she took out a notebook similar to Smethwyck’s and a quill, making a brief note while Qye stared at it mistrustfully.  “As I hear no objections, Healer Smethwyck will stay for medical support only.  He will not make any comments at any point in this evaluation without direct request from myself, Qye or Harry.”
“Mr. Potter’s magic needs a stabilization charm,” Pomfrey said stiffly, holding Harry by the other arm and gently steering him closer to the Healer.  “And the other one didn’t want to stay behind.”
Shaking his head, he stood up, forgetting he had grown since last being in the cupboard.  He hissed as his head hit the top of the cupboard.  He fell back down on the floor, wincing slightly as he rubbed his head.  ‘
“You really know how to liven a gathering, don’t you, Hastai?” Saira Latvian asked sarcastically, her blue-violet eyes glaring darkly from her seat at the table to Leon in the armchair.  “The damn thing is finally fucking done and all you can think about is how many have died and how much we’ve lost?”  She snorted derisively and crossed her arms, a sneer playing on her lips.  “Bright ray of sunshine, aren’t you?”
Professor Opacre placed the papers on her desk and kindly looked at him.  “Of course, Harry, you know I’m always eager to help.  Although, you’ve been doing so well, I don’t think you need to worry about the upcoming exams.”
," he called out, flicking his wand out and he saw Lest's eyes widen and narrow as he dodged the blast of red light.
Annoyance flared back in his eyes and he turned back down to glower at the vampire. Before he could stop himself, he growled at the vampire.
He had come back from the Dursleys' home with many things.  A sadness and bitterness followed him everywhere for about a week after going back to the house he had been raised and lived in.  He had sadly wished that he and the Dursleys could have mended some things, bridging the gulf of hatred between them.  But they were dead now and that separation between them would always be there.  He had laid in his bed a couple of sleepless nights, staring bitterly at the canopy of his four-poster bed, thinking about how that mend would never come because the Dursleys had been so close minded, so stubborn, so
"Hello," she smiled, finishing off attendance and standing up from her desk. "Sorry I was a little late, I had to get some extra materials for today's lesson and Professor Snape...well, since teachers are supposed to talk nice about one another, let's just he was super helpful." She smiled a smile which showed her fangs.
They stood there for a long moment and Harry swallowed as he felt Draco’s fingers slowly move and back forth on his own.
Jonas watched the man slam his hands down on table and snarl at Opacre while Lupin seemed to have lost all words, his eyes glimmering strangely as he stared at the vampire.  He saw Opacre twist at the thing at his neck and his fingers twitch while his eyes flashed and his sister worriedly put her hand on him.  Finally, Jonas sighed and slipped away as Dumbledore’s voice turned sterner and grimmer with every vicious comment hurled, making his subtle retreat into the hallway.
:: he thought to the other boy as he watched Snape snarl out their homework and dismiss the class.  The younger boy still wasn’t saying anything, the only indication of him being there his feelings, which were steadily growing darker.  He bit the inside of his cheek as he plugged up the now filled vial.  ::
"The strength of a vampire with his or her jewel depends on how well they resonate together," Lest said quietly and eyes moved to him. They snapped back to Professor Opacre when she snapped her fingers and grinned.
Harry winced at the shout and closed his eyes tightly, pressing the palms of his hands against them as his head pounded further. ::
“I am being nice,” he smirked and he suddenly threw Harry a sarcastic smile. “You’ll notice I’m not throwing acorns at anyone.”
," he said calmly and he saw Lest's eyes narrow. No one must have used this spell, a first-year spell quickly learned and forgotten, so innocent. He couldn't see what Harry was thinking so he couldn't know what the spell did, as the broken off leg from the desk Harry had blasted hovered up.
Smethwyck flicked his notebook shut.  “My offer to take you on supervised walks around the corridors still stands.”
,’ he thought, probing at something and wincing as his head throbbed.  He raised a shaky hand and grimaced at the weak feeling, his eyes widening as he saw too-thin fingers and wrist.  The last time he saw the hand, it had been stronger and more golden, weathered with ink from the writing Harry had done for the O.W.L.s. and stained with blood from the attack.  He turned the hand around and saw the pale skin on the back of it as he slowly fixed the fingers in the low light of the room.
“As I was about to say before we strayed from the topic,” Pater Nosferatu said, acting as if the displays of disrespect had not occurred, “Dumbledore obviously wants an alliance with us.  Before this meeting, I was ready to agree with you, Saira.  However, because of these new developments brought forth by the Jeaneyls, I think we should reconsider it.”
“What’s Hermione done now, Harry?” Seamus Finnigan chirped, sliding in to the seat on the left of Harry, Dean sitting next to him.  Neville took the seat on Harry’s right and shyly waved to them, which Harry waved back to.
Remus exhaled shakily, rubbing his eyes.  “She said she was going to continue it tomorrow.  She wouldn’t – I mean, it’s not done yet.”
He saw her glance over to where Dumbledore sat, speaking in low tones with Snape and McGonagall.  “Should we tell him now?  Or include him - ”
“No!” she yelled and threw up her hand, crying out as Dazain’s strength slammed down on her and broke her concentration.
“Don’t think I won’t feed you a Canary Cream if I think you’re dodging us,” Ron warned, frowning as he shifted his school bag.
Harry stared back.  And slowly cursed as he felt a flush slowly creep up his cheeks as a knowing smile came upon her face.
“I said I don’t care,” Harry said, his voice darkening as he slowly started to walk past them, still holding Draco’s wand with his other hand.  “Nothing gave you the right to do that.”  He saw Lest’s eyes darken.  “Try anything like that again and truce or not, leader of vampires or not, nothing will help you by the time I’m done with you.  Clear?”
He was about to ask who Lest was when he connected it.  Lest was Professor Opacre’s brother.  Qye knew Lest wasn’t trouble.  Therefore, Qye had to know Lest personally. The thought of sleep fled from his mind and he slowly opened his eyes.
“Harry,” she said softly, “I’m sorry about what I said.  I spoke without thinking and I should have realized why you could see them.  I was just so caught up in the moment that I didn’t realize - ”
“It’s him,” Dazain said quietly across the silent space.  “That’s who he is.  This is where he’s been.”
coming here?” Malfoy hissed, his hand clenched into a fist, anger radiating from his trembling form.
Her brown eyes narrowed as he said nothing and just stood there, mind whirling with trying to think of how to best answer that.
Her eyes sharpened and he fought back his instinctive reaction to force a smile, knowing it wouldn’t fool her.
Hermione sighed again and sat next to him, making him scoot over to accommodate her small form. She took one of his hands and rubbed it comfortingly and he squeezed it gently back, lifting his eyes to see Ron stand up and sit on the end of the bed, an awkward look on his face.
,’ Harry thought as he pulled his clothes over to him and pushed away the covers.  Qye was silent but he got the distinct feeling that the other was listening.
“Would you mind if we tagged along?” she asked, ignoring her brother’s startled look. They blinked at her and she smiled. “I just want to make sure he’s okay and all.” She winked at them. “After all, I can’t lose one of my best students.”
Harry watched his friends over the brim of his cup.  He didn’t like this idea anymore than Ron but he could see why Dumbledore wanted to start it.  With the rise of Voldemort again, it wouldn’t hurt to have as many allies as one could have.  He glanced over at the Slytherin table, where Malfoy was sneering at his schedule.  ‘
The vampire sighed as Remus carefully chose to say nothing and followed after his friend.  “No, I suppose not.”
He stopped as the vampire shot up from the armchair and stood between them and the doorway, his eyes glaring viciously at them.  Remus barely noticed the moment he pulled his wand and saw that Sirius had done the same.
He leaned towards Ron and whispered, just loud enough for Hermione to hear, “When did she become my mother?”  Ron snickered and Hermione squawked.
Harry looked up from his treacle tart.  Her hair was messier than usual, a stray strand cutting across her tired face but her eyes unwavering.  She met his gaze evenly and when he glanced over at Ron, he found that same level stare looking back at him.
“I would like you and Mr. Lupin to sit down with Harry and Qye before I write my recommendation,” the Mind-Healer repeated, standing calmly in the doorway to their rooms, far too early after the night Sirius and Remus had spent finishing off the bottle of Firewhiskey in weak celebration and heavy anxiety.
’ Harry thought briefly, as he ducked out of the Great Hall in between written exams.  He flashed a sense of apology towards Qye.
“Pater,” Nilsson breathlessly said, her normally composed expression ruffled.  “One of them is awake.”
“Why are you asking me?” Harry asked strangely, giving the redhead a weird look. Glancing at the still befuddled group of teenagers, he turned away and followed Hermione at a more leisurely pace. “Come on, if Professor Opacre really is going to drain us dry, I’d rather have it over and done with so I can work on that forest Snape gave me.”
Leon glanced at the still figure of his other cousin and his lips twisted slightly.  Quietly, he whispered back, “Because some people think Pater Nosferatu killed his.  Krista obviously is one of those people and he hates hearing that accusation.”
The teenagers shared a look before following him and Marylin raised an eyebrow as she walked behind.
Wainscott looked at him and Qye stared at the kindness in her eyes, swallowing, wondering if it was truly this easy.  “We’re not done yet, Harry.”
“Are you getting tired again?” the Healer asked, clear concern in his voice, taking a step towards him as he took his wand out again.  “I know Madam Pomfrey was worried about the physical exercises I was having you start yesterday but your muscles looked - ”
He bit back the snap on the tip of his tongue and fought off the urge to glare while calming down his heart. Stupid vampire.
Then they grew darker, a darker shade of blue.  A darker blue that mocked in a friendly manner.  A darker blue that held amusement in them, amusement that annoyed him…in a good way?  Harry didn’t understand.  He just knew that these darker blue eyes captured him, held him…so familiar…so warm…
Harry mumbled and curled up into a small ball, absently pushing the voice away while trying to cling to the rapidly fading sleep.
Their plan of separation really consists a lot of “…now what?” after they get through one hurdle and face another.
“I was wrong,” the redhead interrupted her and Marylin watched as he shot the brunette a look. “Besides, you know Harry. He’s always doing
," Ron muttered and the book smacked against the invisible shield, quivering in the air as it was caught between two extreme pressures before clattering to the floor.
“Fight fire with fire,” Jordan suddenly said, eyes widening.  He blushed when everyone turned to look at him and sunk in his seat.  He coughed and looked timidly at his cousin.  “That’s what you mean to do, isn’t it?  Use this alliance with Dumbledore to fight against Voldemort if the Dazains do join him.”
“Should we?” said Leon Hastai quietly, his pale brown eyes looking at Jacob with his usual serious expression.  “So many have died in this war…so many families have been broken, so many old ways. Do you honestly think we should celebrate?”
Harry said distractedly as he took control again, stumbled forward and crouched, shifting through his pockets to look for his wand.
“Look, like you said, I spend enough time in the hospital wing I don’t exactly fancy adding another day to it, especially when I’m fine, so I really don’t need to go,” Qye said, restraining his irritation as much as he could. “It’s not like it’s going to kill me or anything.”
“You will not touch these students,” Professor Sinistra said coldly, raising her own tall frame to match the vampire.
“Good,” Marylin murmured.  The siblings were silent for a moment, each lost in their own thoughts.  After a few minutes, Marylin opened her eyes and looked at her brother.
potion did exactly what Hermione said and turned the memory of a person into a tangible product, expelled as a mist from the drinker to form into a material which contained all the thoughts and feelings associated with the memory.  The memory was typically guided out by another individual or concentrated on by the drinker.  And just like Hermione said, its effect lasted for only two hours before it lost its form and dissipated back into the individual it came from unless restrained in a magical construct.
He looked at her, turned his head to look back at Ron who was still watching him with narrowed eyes.
“You’ll come to us when it gets too much though, right?” Ron frowned, looking at him. Harry nodded and Ron sighed. “Well, guess there’s much to do but wait then.” He made a sour expression. “I hate waiting.”
The black-haired boy blinked and Draco dropped his eyes, turning around to pack up his own bag.  Harry looked at the Slytherin but the pale boy was refusing to meet his eyes.  Sighing silently, he turned around to find a worried Hermione and wary Ron.  The shorter boy started in surprise when he realized they were the only ones left in the class.
“With you, I’m not surprised,” Hermione said sweetly, eyes flashing.  Ron glowered at her before taking off his prefect badge and polishing it slightly before buttoning it back on again.  They had been made prefects of Gryffindor House and even though he complained about it, Harry often saw the pride in his blue eyes when he looked at his badge.  He had been thrilled to see his best friends become prefects although he had also felt a pang of loneliness.  They both now had new responsibilities and he felt like he was slightly on a different level than theirs sometimes.  But they were still his best friends and he wouldn’t let something as stupid as positions get in the way of their friendship, or anything else for that matter.
“I’m okay,” he said aloud, a calm look on his face and still faking a smile. “And I just left the Infirmary - ”
“Ah…no,” she said, shaking her head.  She smiled and hugged him.  “It’s good to see you again, Harry.  I’m so sorry we weren’t able to stay, I was so worried when I left, Ron and me both, you were unconscious and wouldn’t wake up and we stayed with you as often as we could and - ”
Remus couldn’t help but be relived as the castle towers came into view, even with the looming worry of what could have possibly happened to call them here.  They wasted no time between receiving Dumbledore’s letter and rushing to the school while staying low on the radar of the Ministry.
“Of course, he knows about those dreams!” Seamus said, laughing uncontrollably as he clutched Dean’s shoulder to keep his balance.  “He-he’s just too embarrassed to admit it!”  The sandy-haired boy stopped talking as the snickers overwhelmed him.
Taking another breath, he lifted his eyes calmly to meet the wide-eyed, confused looks of the other three. Lest had his head turned away, his eyes focused on the lake. Qye couldn’t help but glance at him before turning his attention back to the others.
“But - ” Hermione began again.  Fortunately, Ron came to his aid by laying a hand on her arm and shaking his head.  Hermione glared at him slightly but the redhead just looked at her.  She let out a frustrated breath but thankfully remained silent.  Harry shot his friend a grateful look that Ron returned with a grin.
Ron slowly twirled his wand in his hand, his blue eyes fixed on his best friend as the silence stretched.  The rest of their dorm mates had left earlier, prompted by Hermione while Ron made sure Harry wasn’t disturbed.
“Don’t get any ideas about leaving again, Potter,” she warned. “You’ll not be leaving my sight until I’m positive you’ll not collapse again.” She waved her wand again and Harry gave a small sigh of relief as the pale yellow light blinked out.
“Nothing wrong then?” the Slytherin asked softly, his eyes trained on the room where the Gryffindor lay.
“Okay, no,” Harry said hastily, struggling against her inhuman strength.  “No, no, this is where I draw the line, I am not taking makeup.”
“Hm…it appears your quick recovery has left you with a reminder,” Dumbledore said thoughtfully. At the boy’s questioning look, he explained. “Your eyes appear a little darker than what they used to be.”
Harry leaned against the bed, crossing his arms and looking down at the floor.  Qye had a point.  He doubted anyone, not even Ron or Hermione, would believe him if he told them he had a voice in his head that he had conversations with.  Maybe Dumbledore…but he didn’t want to take the chance.
:: Harry asked sarcastically, finding his glasses and putting them on. He swallowed thickly as the room spun and wobbled shakily.
Harry,” he said jerkily, jutting his chin to the other teenager still leaning heavily against him.  “
There was a rattling sound as a ring tapped across a windowsill in Copenhagen.  A hand picked up a long pole.
There was silence as he continued to stand there, his face burning and his eyes downcast as he continued to hold onto the other boy’s hand.  He wanted to move very much but the fear of what might happen if he let Draco go – and what might happen to him – kept him in place.  ::
:: the newly named person said after a long moment of silence.  He once again got the odd feeling of the person – Qye – raising his eyebrow.  But…was it actually him?
Harry had dropped back at that.  With Lest still hovering around, it was hard to worry about House rivalries. But even he couldn’t think about that much, not with Qye snapping at him every time his mind started to wander to how dangerous vampires were.
Marylin and her brother shared long looks again and Jordan furrowed his forehead.  There was something about their looks to each other…
He took a deep breath and lowered his eyes, forcing his voice to be quiet. “I apologize for causing you pain.” Granger lowered her hand and Qye raised his eyes to see Lest blink, confusion evident in his eyes. The vampire shook his head slightly and the confusion was gone, hidden behind the cool expression once more.
“Not with vampires, no,” Snape said coolly, turning away from the angry vampire and walking back to his desk.  Professor Opacre’s eyebrow twitched slightly.
,’ he wondered as he laid his folded arms on his knees, carefully balanced on his heels and evenly meeting the teenager’s assessing eyes.
and… I can’t even tell you what I was thinking when I told you to say yes.  All I can say is that when I saw that notice, I wanted you there with me.  So that I could be with you.  So.  Please come to the dance with me.”
"You know it's going to happen anyway, Ron!" someone said from the group in a low whisper and Harry's eyes spun back to see Seamus hiding behind an embarrassed Dean. "Might as well get a move on."
“They tore him apart,” he whispered, his body trembling. “They just…Voldemort said something to someone…to not spoil them and to control them I think…the other person…”
!” a man’s voice yelled, shaky and distressed and fierce and he heard it grunt, shout out protests, and he ignored it because he could only focus on so much and right now all his focus was on hurting Lest as much as he was, slashing down, striking across, punching and kicking and hitting him with every morsel of strength he could muster.
Harry shuddered as Professor Opacre hummed happily as she set aside another aquamarine shirt and a lavender vest.
Qye said, watching from behind his eyes as Harry pulled back his spells and put up his Shield Charm again. Lest paused, eyes narrowed at him as he stood next to a toppled over desk.
Professor Opacre blinked at Ron as the redhead stopped the accepted distance away from her brother and stood stiffly, staring at the male vampire with a stoic expression.
:: he shouted in his mind, frightened and confused.  He was listening to a voice in his head and could feel its pain…had he gone insane?  ::
“It’s shit like that,” Qye said tightly, rubbing his hand, “that they’re going to try to take advantage of.”  He dropped his hands and stared hard at Harry.  “Or have you changed your mind?”
"Yes, well," she said, locking the door. "Let's see if we can find something for that bruise." She looked up at him. "Still hurt?"
“I’ve got this,” Ron said.  He glanced back at his dorm mates, shifting uncomfortably.  “Give us a moment?”
“Thanks for the cheerful thought to look forward to, Hermione,” Harry sighed and she winced and looked abashed.
“I’m fine,” he assured her, trying to keep the grin on his face. “Just need to have a spot of tea and eat something, that’s all.” His stomach rebelled at the thought. “Besides,” he continued hastily to cover up his queasiness, “you don’t want me to fall behind in class, do you? With O.W.L.s coming up and all…”
“Hermione, look at me,” he said firmly.  Her brown eyes glanced up and blinked.  “I’m not jinxed, hexed, cursed, bamboozled or in any way thinking Malfoy is anything but a plain and utter git.  If he were to disappear from all known existence or fall into a vat of poisonous flobberworms and die, I really couldn’t be happier.  But as we’re currently stuck with said git, I’m just going to pretend every time I see his damn face that there’s a bouncing ferret.”
“Probably the same as you,” Hermione replied blandly.  She suddenly smiled brightly and grabbed Harry’s hand, dragging him to stand up with her as she looked at Ron and Malfoy.  “I think we need a refill and Madam Rosmerta looks busy, we’ll be right back.”
“I thought there wasn’t supposed to be any interference,” Remus said slowly while Sirius stood stunned.
The beast grunted as the red lights bounced off its side, bared its teeth and clawed deeper into his robes, snapped harder, its wide eyes fixated on his neck.  Behind it, he could glimpse Hermione desperately fighting off her own, Ginny hurling her own hexes while the professors and proctors pushed and pulled students back.
,’ he thought to himself and in the next moment he shook again, this time in wild fear, reaching out with his mind, reaching like before for another –
“The sessions you recommended,” Lupin said quietly, closing the repot and setting it aside.  He glanced to Black, who was looking down at his own copy, blank-faced.
“Leave it, Ron,” he said quietly, not raising his eyes.  “You know he’s just trying to bait you while we’re around Snape.  It’s not worth it.”
Harry stopped at the bottom of the stairs, slowly putting his hands inside the pockets of his robes as Hermione regarded him from her spot at the table.  There was a Transfiguration textbook open in front of her but no notes, no study chart, no quills or parchment.
Her brother turned his furious look to her. “Your students are foolish,” he hissed at her, his eyes flashing. “I almost killed them! Why have you not taught them to be more careful?!”
Memories of being forced to dress up and scheming with Lest to hide turned to memories of laughing as Harry was subjected to Myn’s ministrations turned to memories of Lest kissing Harry and he threw a glare to the side, blinking away tears.
He caught Draco looking at him sideways as he coughed and he paused in cleaning. He chewed his lip for a moment, and then on impulse, grabbed the other boy’s hand, giving it a small squeeze. “Thanks for worrying,” he said softly, giving him a small smile.
“What in Hélène’s name are you doing sitting in the dark?” she muttered as she stood next to him, peering at him in the dim light.  “Thank you for waiting for me by the way, I didn’t need your help cleaning up at all, it’s not like - ”
“I’ll give you this back,” he said, raising Draco’s wand, “once we’re at the main street.  Then I’m going back to Hogwarts.  Alone.”
Sirius’ growl reverberated through the room as Remus’ body stiffened.   She gritted her teeth and continued as if she didn’t hear them.  “Now that you are
“No one’s talking,” Seamus flailed his arms slightly, looking a little panicked. “I always talk to the Hufflepuffs after lunch to find out what the lesson is so I can prepare for it - ”
“You should think a little highly of yourselves, I suppose,” drawled another, sauntering closer as Malfoy’s shield dissipated.  “Mere children making such nuisances of themselves.”  He saw him glance over at Sprout, leaning heavily on Neville and still trying to hold onto her wand.  “How proud you must be of them.”
“I’m not disrupting him,” she said through gritted teeth, her blue eyes flashing.  “I’m making sure he’s on task and having small talk.  Perhaps you’ve heard of it?”
The Gryffindor blinked, looking up from his Potions essay to see Malfoy staring at him with an irritated look in his pale gray eyes.  They were inside the library once more for another study session, this time for Potions.  They had chosen a table that was secluded away in one corner, right next to a window that was showing the new weather at Hogwarts, signifying the beginning of March.
He jerked, shocked. Harry! Where was he? He snapped his eyes closed and instinctively turned inward, probing around his mind for something that might resemble…
“If neither of you has a preference,” Wainscott said, lifting up her quill again and turning to a new page of her notebook, “then maybe we can start here as I already have both of you.”  She made a note and underlined it, followed by a bullet point before she looked back at them.
“It’s so unfair that we still have our own exams to do,” Dennis Creevey grumbled.  “You lot are finished but we still have - ”
After finding Qye's Journal, he had searched the rest of the compartment and found other things as well.  He had wanted to inspect them even more but he had heard the Auror calling for him so he had bundled everything up in his robe, checked the compartment one last time, and left.  His mind had buzzed throughout the entire trip back to Hogwarts, pulsing with something.  However, it was so late by the time the group had gotten back that he had only stuffed the findings under his mattress and gone to sleep.
"Harry is not me," Qye finished in a final tone of voice.  His eyes hardened and broke no argument.  “I am not Harry and Harry is not me and that's all there is to us."
The male vampire shrugged elegantly and slouched further in the soft leather chair, stretching out his denim-clad legs even more. “I say let the one with the highest rank enjoy the comfort of this remarkably made chair.”
Harry let out the deep breath he hadn’t known he had been holding in as the hooded vampire turned his eyes away.  A million things whirled through his head, not one of them a coherent thought.  His own green eyes turned away from the vampire, looking down at the table.
He blinked and lifted his eyes from the floor to meet Granger and Weasley’s curious faces. He forced a smile and shook his head, shoving his hands in his pockets to hide him clenching them painfully.
“Perhaps my office would be best,” Dumbledore said, no twinkle in his eye.  “I’m sure Mr. Potter will be stable enough as we sort this out.  Poppy, alert us if there are any changes.”
They reached the part of the village where the paved streets slowly transformed into a worn path, the houses growing further and further apart as the trees grew larger.  Without giving it a second thought, his feet automatically began walking a familiar path to the Shrieking Shack.  It took him a moment to realize Draco wasn’t with him and he stopped to turn around.
“Common ground doesn’t mean dressing up Harry however you’d like,” Ron immediately broke in, unwilling to look at such emotion from Malfoy of all people.  He drew both their gazes and he frowned severely at Malfoy.  “Honestly, Malfoy, for all your wealth you couldn’t get him a shirt that fits?”
“Let me think about it,” Harry said, looking back down at the potion.  He gave them a quick smile as he pulled back his Astronomy notes.  “It’s not like I should do any of this while O.W.L.s are going on.”
Harry stirred, wincing at the loud tone of voice.  Apparently those weren’t his thoughts but the words of someone else in the room.  He sighed silently as he roused from his deep sleep.  Some people had no respect for silence, especially in quiet places.
The kiss was warm and inviting, dazing him with each breath they took.  Harry lost track of when his eyes had closed, trying to ground himself with the taste of butterbeer still lingering on Draco’s lips.
“The same like the rest of us?” Dean suggested and smiled when the sandy-haired boy scowled at him. “Look, she’s never given us anything that we can’t do so how can this be any worse?”
“I’ve already thought of that, Leon,” his cousin said, smiling humorlessly.  He looked at Marylin and she stood up.  “And here’s the answer.”
Professor Opacre gave him a long, considering look and then suddenly grinned, beaming with her bright eyes as she rapidly stood up.
“Ah, so you’re finally awake, Mr. Potter,” she said crisply, walking over to his bed.  “We were all quite worried about you for a while.  How are you feeling?  Do you feel anything different?”
" - and take time to review your notes instead of goofing off," Hermione continued.  She stopped however when she noticed them smiling too innocently.  Narrowing her eyes, she crossed her arms and glowered at them.  "I mean it," she snapped, looking at them in annoyance.  "You two will be in so much trouble if you don't start studying for the O.W.L.s now!"
“There is much to explain, Sirius,” Dumbledore said patiently.  “I understand your concern about Harry and felt it would be best to show you first that - ”
“It looks like I’ll be doing all the work this year,” Hermione sighed as they trudged from the Potions classroom to their next class.  “Working with Goyle…it’s like trying to work with a two-year-old on advanced physics!”
“No dream,” Harry muttered, glowering slightly at the bouncy Irish boy.  “Seamus is just acting funny today.  I have no idea what he’s talking about.”
“Well, you’ll like it here,” she said cheerfully.  “You’ll at least have one other of the family to talk to at least.”
“Pensieve, pensieve,” she muttered, brows furrowed.  Ron and Harry exchanged looks and looked back when she suddenly cried “aha!” and pushed it over to Harry.
The winter wind was blowing in through the open doors at the end of the hall and as Harry wrapped his arms around himself for warmth, more and more students entered, returning from their visits back home.
He was waiting in the corridor, most likely for Professor Opacre, leaning against the wall with a distant look in his eyes.  As soon as most of the other students cleared the corridor, the vampire glanced over at the doorway and met his green eyes.
He went silent again and Harry knew he wouldn’t be getting anything more from the other boy tonight.
“It was from a while ago, I wasn’t sure if they might’ve incorporated other topics from previous years when they revise the exams every year,” Hermione said absently, still looking at Harry, who’s expression had gone curiously blank.
Her body stiffened, her eyesight went far and from her lips it came, as she listened with her telepathy, “
"Oh good, thank you, Ron!" she chirped, gesturing for him to come forward. He nodded and unpocketed his wand. Harry and Hermione moved aside, still bewildered by his sudden offering. As he passed them, he paused. Harry blinked as Ron gave him a look.
The vampire continued to look at him for a moment, face emotionless and eyes churning.  Then, without a word, he turned swiftly away and swept out of the classroom.
“Of course I’ll help!” she said enthusiastically, sweeping over him and ruffling his hair.  Her eyes were shining again as she wrapped an arm around him.  “I already have some ideas and I would love nothing more than to help my favorite student!”  She winked at him as she gently started steering him for the door.
“Mr. Potter?” he asked carefully, keeping his wand out but trying to instill as much of a nonthreatening aura as he could in his voice.
Qye opened his eyes, stared at his shaking hands, at the redness of his knuckles where he had hit Lest –
The smirk deepened and Harry couldn’t contain his flush from finally making its way onto his face as the blond leaned closer, his lips almost brushing his ear as he whispered.  “Great.  I’ll see you Saturday at seven.”
Lest shared a look with Myn, who Qye realized had not said a word.  She sat quietly, looking at a report in her lap, smoothing her hand over it.
Qye kneeled above Lest, rage twisting familiar features as his lips pulled back into a snarl and a hand strained to plunge something wooden and sharp straight down into Lest’s throat.  His body was shaking and his eyes were red-rimmed and Lest looked helpless, his own hands shaking as they held onto Qye’s wrists and yet the stake kept edging closer and closer, pricking at his throat and pushing the skin in.
Ron took one look at the furious expression on Madame Pomfrey’s face, thought of his mother, and came to an immediate conclusion. Grabbing Hermione’s hand, he ran out of the Infirmary, shouting over his shoulder. “Don’t worry, we’ll bring him back!”
Harry paused, blinking exhaustedly down at the words that blurred together.  He rubbed his eyes and squinted down at the page.
“Indeed. Which is quite surprising, given the state you were brought in.” Qye shrugged, turning his eyes to his plate.
Instead, it was a gold-zippered black shirt that fit comfortably with sleeves just a little past his elbow.  The hem of the shirt barely reached the waistline of the dark grey jeans and he tugged on the black boots with a small heel.  He wiggled his feet and cast the adjustment charm that had become very familiar.
Chaos erupted as the students panicked, lurching in confusion away from the snarling beast, stumbling from the tables while the professors shouted and pulled out their wands.
She grinned as she capped her eyeliner.  “Harry asked for clothing advice,” she sighed happily, holding the tube close as she remembered all the fun of the afternoon.  “I was so happy to be asked I…”  She ruefully looked around the messy room.  “Well, I suppose I might’ve gotten a little…enthusiastic.”  She laughed and whirled around as she continued cleaning up.  “Oh, but I haven’t done that in such a long time.”
"Watching out for your little friend?" Lest said mockingly, blue eyes flicking slightly over to where Harry was standing. Harry met his gaze for only a moment before turning his eyes back to his friend, teeth gritting.
Gray eyes glanced into the office, noting the nurse as she mumbled and turned over in her blankets. Soft leather boots tapped their way across the smooth floor of the Infirmary, sliding past the other patients and stopping by a door. A pale hand gently eased the door open, aristocratic features wincing as a soft creak echoed through the sterile place. Quicksilver eyes sharply looked back to the office but the nurse continued to sleep soundly.
“A midget in glasses,” Weasley grinned, mirth replacing the strange look in his eyes. Qye couldn’t help but scowl at the other boy but fortunately, the idiot seemed to think it was mock-scowl and not real. “Sorry about that, it’s just…” Weasley stopped and shook his head, grinning again. “Never mind, it’s probably nothing.”
He hesitated, looking at it, looking at Harry.  He could feel strength slowly coming into his body but uncertainty about what lay beyond the room made him think about collapsing back into bed, think about sitting next to Harry and waiting for him to wake up to talk about what to do next because Harry had been right, they hadn’t talked about what to do after, what to do if this worked out.
“Bastard!” Lest snarled and his punch finally landed, sending the other vampire grunting back as it collided against his mouth.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered. He saw them both look at him and he cleared his throat, clenching and unclenching his hands. “I…I didn’t mean to do that to either of you. I didn’t mean to push you away, I wasn’t even aware of it.” He shifted his gaze to his hands, playing with his fingers. “I didn’t want to worry either of you. I thought I could handle it on my own and I could hide it so you two wouldn’t be disturbed.” He gave a mirthless smile. “Guess that didn’t work, huh?”
“I’m sorry, Qye,” Remus said softly and Sirius heard that same undercurrent of impotent rage so carefully disguised in his mild voice.  The teenager shrugged again, slouching in his seat with his arms wrapped around himself.
His punch sent the vampire’s head cracking into the wall and Qye’s heart thumped rapidly as he stared dumbly down at the unconscious man.
Harry patted the neck of the white horse he and his friends had first gone to.  He let his eyes wander around, watching all the horses enjoying the treatment they were getting.
:: Harry suddenly found himself assaulted with Qye’s own pain and he spared a moment’s thought to wonder where it came from before it added to his own torment and he heard that lone, piercing scream in part of the world grow louder.
“Look,” he said, clearing his throat and slowly lowering his hands as he tried to fight off his blush, “I really do appreciate your help.  Like I said, I normally wouldn’t have bothered with this but…”  He faltered as his blush deepened before he pushed ahead.  “But…thank you anyway.  And I am
Harry stopped and saw the chapter entitled ‘Products of Telepathy.’  There were several subsections and he shifted uncomfortably as he read ‘Persuasion’ and ‘Manipulations’.
Yes, I will be replacing most of the 'Mione's with Hermione.  As I vaguely recall Hermione did not like that nickname.  Also: ellipses. All those ellipses. Why, past Shades, why.
Turning around, they saw a smirking Draco Malfoy with his arms crossed in an arrogant pose.  Ron began to turn red and Hermione blushed as she got the comment.  Before Ron could let his temper fly loose, Malfoy swept past them and into the classroom without another word.
The chapter got split in two because there is still a loooot of talk. Next part already written and will be out on Friday!
Qye said slyly and Harry wished not for the last time that the other boy was out of his head with his own body if only for a moment so that Harry could hit him for the smirk he felt.
He jumped slightly as he felt a hand fall on his shoulder.  Blinking, he looked at the gnarled hand on his shoulder then up at the sorrowful figure of Dumbledore.  The blue eyes looked down at him sadly and the hand squeezed his shoulder.
Lest growled out something in a different language and Professor Opacre rolled her eyes, clearly unimpressed as she went around organizing her things and flicking through attendance.
He walked quietly over to her and sat down on the couch next to her, carefully watching for any more signs of violence.  “I’m sorry, Marylin,” he said softly, his dark blue eyes meeting hers calmly.  “I didn’t mean to.”  He shrugged, his eyes darkening slightly.  “You know how I get around that spoiled…Malfoy started it.”
“Hélène,” Saira said in disgust, glaring at Krista.  “What are they teaching you at Nosle?  How to tie your shoes?”  Krista blushed and looked down in embarrassment.
The thought penetrated the darkness, sharp and loud in the silence.  He stirred, trying to banish away the words that were trying to bring him from the soft black place.
Ron's eyes widened and he stumbled. In that second, a few lighter trinkets smacked against the side of his hand, causing it to reflexively loosen just as Lest gestured with his hand again.
He opened the door to his room and stood in the doorway, looking around the place in which he lived for only a few years.  Walking in, he looked around.  Everything looked pretty much the same except for a few ruffled papers and books dropped on the floor.  Picking one up, he absently put it back on the shelf.  The attackers had been in this room.  But why?
Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, opened his green eyes, eyes that were once full of good cheer and happiness.  Now, even after arriving at the only place he really considered home, the bright glow in the emerald eyes was gone, faded to a dull, tired look.  Sighing, he ran a pale hand through his messy black hair and exited the carriage.
Lest nodded, glancing around the Great Hall again and frowning when he still didn’t see the green-eyed teenager.  “I know.”
Hermione gazed at him.  “You don’t think he means to hurt him, do you?”  Her hand unconsciously tightened around her wand.
Both men looked back across the table and for the first time since waking up, Qye looked young and uncertain.  Harry had lowered his eyes once more and was staring at his tightly clasped hands.
“Oh, you know, he just wanted to bug me again,” he said, shrugging and shoving his hands in his pockets.  “It’s his role in life, remember?”  Ron growled slightly and continued to glare at the corner as if it were Malfoy himself.  Harry smiled slightly, then turned to look at Hermione.
His voice cut off and Qye opened his eyes to see Harry lifting the pillow from his face, looking confused.
,” Harry said, placing special emphasis on the other boy’s last name.  Draco’s eyes darkened and Harry smiled tightly, slinging the bag over his shoulder.  “Are you going to leave me alone now?”  Without waiting for a response, he turned away to leave the classroom.
“Qye,” Harry’s muffled voice came wearily from beneath his arm.  Smethwyck merely continued writing his notes, having learned on day three not to interfere.  That was the same day he had banished all the breakable items and mirrors from the room.
Silence again and Marylin was beginning to think that perhaps she should skip this idea and just go straight into the books when the bushy-haired girl, who Marylin identified as Hermione Granger, raised her hand.  She saw the red-haired boy known as Ron Weasley begin to shake his head in warning but Harry murmured something and Ron stopped, although he looked a bit irritated and worried.
“He’s only trying to help,” Qye heard Harry quietly say from the other bed while he glared at the door, clenching and unclenching his fingers in the fabric.
She jotted down the name of class and watched as the ink shimmered into parchment a moment before fading away.  While she waited for the attendance list to appear, she glanced quickly at the lone pair of eyes that held neither fear, nor mistrust, nor anger towards her.  Instead they looked steadily at her, calm and serene like the sea.  Yes, there was wariness in them but there was no sign that the boy had judged her already.
He could see his hand reaching for the door knob, felt the chill of the bathroom but for all his want he could not move a step forward, could not lift his hand any further.
It was true that the past DADA teachers hadn’t been the most honest of people.  All of them, in one way or another, had lied about themselves and had only been able to teach for a year.  There were rumors that the job was cursed and Harry dimly wondered if this new teacher would last the year.  The silence returned, just as uncomfortable, and lasted to the end of the feast.
:: the other boy laughed softly, his first words since the encounter.  The words were full of fond remembrance and deep relief.  Harry was momentarily puzzled by the emotions but the situation at hand distracted him from thinking about them further.
“Come on, then,” he muttered, brushing her off and beginning to stalk down the corridor.  “We wouldn’t want to miss anything, would we?”
The hooded figure laughed softly and stepped closer to the frightened family.  Vernon tried to shield his wife and son, all the while glaring at the man.  “Don’t worry, Dursley,” the man said lazily, shoving his hands in his pockets.  “I’ll be more than happy to leave and never return.  That is, after I picked up something I entrusted to you some years ago.  Oh, and definitely after I check to see whether or not you listened to my warning.”
The war might have been mostly over but he was struggling with his role as the Pater Nosferatu of Europe so long as he remained here and distracted by something he would not say.
In an instant, everything switched around.  His mind rushed out, stretching and stretching and stretching and something was fragmenting, tiny little cracks were somewhere, growing bigger and bigger.  He tried to focus, to cling to something stable but his mind was stretching, being pulled in a million directions.
Harry lifted his head from his plate, blinking at the irritated redhead.  "What was that?" he asked, pausing in lifting a spoonful of corn to his mouth.
Harry explained and he glanced around, trying to think of his next move. Now that Qye had alleviated his concerns, his burning desire to beat the vampire revived.
’  For some reason, the thought didn’t cheer him as much as he thought it would have.  The idea of Malfoy missing from his daily life seemed…wrong…somehow.  He sighed and turned his head to the Head Table.  He waved and forced a smile to Hagrid, who was sitting next to Professor Sinistra.  Then he blinked.
The stake edged closer and Qye felt the arms around him tighten, felt Harry’s heartbeat against his back as he hugged him closer.
Qye’s plan sounded reasonable.  He could learn more about the other boy and if they didn’t find a solution, at least he would have some proof to back up having Qye in his head.  Sighing, he ran a hand through his hair.
He sat there and wished he could do something, had done something more, and wondering if all this had anything to do with the mysterious Qye next to Harry he had seen on the Marauder’s Map before all the students had been evacuated from Hogwarts.
The cupboard.  Before magic and Hogwarts.  Before Ron and Hermione.  Before the Weasleys and Sirius.  Before Snape and Voldemort.  Before the Ministry and the press.  Before his life became so complicated.
“I was only offering,” he quickly backpedaled, holding up a hand and giving the most apologetic look he could.  “I completely understand - ”
He shrugged.  “That’s all he said.  Mind you, the git’s got bad blood with him obviously but the way he said it…”  He shrugged again.
Next to him, he heard Ron growl out, “Don’t flatter yourself, Malfoy.  Harry would never stoop as low to even think about cowardly, little rodents like yourself.”
He shot up in bed, gasping and trembling. Then he groaned as he was hit with gravity and sight and smells and feeling and sound and all the other things he hadn’t dealt with for months.
“Either way, mate,” Weasley continued, drawing back Qye’s attention, “You’d better go back and calm her a bit. With all the time you spend there, I don’t think you want her mad at you for the rest of our time here.”
“Fine,” Harry muttered behind him and Qye shut his mouth, gritting his teeth.  The man inclined his head and then turned around to the crowd behind him, watching them in stunned silence.  Qye looked away from them as he saw a black-haired man watching them desperately, held back by the brown-haired one who looked at them as if unsure how to react.
More than a decade of thinking, plotting, writing in between terrible changes in real life and being so thankful for everyone who took the time to read over all these long years. For everyone who has stuck with me since the beginning or has only just recently discovered this, thank you, I love you all and will never have enough words or time to tell you. I hope you jump over to Carus, which will be finished this year. As much as I have loved this story, I am sure everyone can agree the ending and certain reunions have been a long time coming.
“Oh, ha ha,” Seamus snorted sarcastically. “What do you know, Malfoy? Then again, Slytherins know a lot about sucking, don’t you?”
“Why do you say that?” he asked in the politest voice he could muster up, forcing himself to not glare at Opacre’s brother as he pulled the ladle from the gently bubbling potion and placing it down on the table as he looked mildly up at the vampire.
“Oh, are you heading home Olivia?” the woman said brightly, turning to watch the witch go and raising a hand to faintly wave.  “As I said, always a pleasure!  Don’t be a stranger now, you know I love a long conversation!”
“A moment, if you would,” Dazain suddenly said, sliding past the astonished wizard.  He stopped a few feet in front of Harry, who leaned away, expression wary.
She doesn’t feel the expected joy or pain, the burst of relief or worry, the fear of the consequences – all she felt was numbness with detached thoughts of how screwed up it all was.  She had seen it coming and ignored it, dismissed it, tried not to think so much on it and now that it was out there, finally, in the open…
Harry furrowed his brow slightly before clearing it out, not wanting to show any reaction.  There was an odd tone in Qye’s voice…::
"However," she sighed, "I'm not naive. In light of this recent knowledge, I've thought maybe it would be best if you got more than just lecture and secondhand knowledge. I mean, that's really all it is. I can tell you all sorts of things about us but I don't think you'll really understand it without firsthand knowledge to supplement your learning. And I don't want any of you to gain that experience from situations where you face true danger."
“I’m just going to remind you that we’ll be going home soon so if you jinx them now, Mum’s going to remember it better,” Ron pointed out as he dropped in the seat next to Neville.
I hope you stay with me and I appreciate you taking your time to read, leave kudos, comment or anything.  Thank you.  See you soon!
"Lest, stop antagonizing," Professor Opacre scolded as she waved a hand at her brother. She moved back behind her desk and raised her hand. Lest merely smiled coolly as Ron tightened his hand on his wand.
“Thank you for the demonstration of your fine motor skills, Qye,” Smethwyck said as he pushed his hand down, one of the few unphased.  “Now do you want to hear the recommendation and participate in our discussion or will you be using some more of your nonverbal communication skills?”
Sirius idly scratched his chin, trying to work out what to say.  “Something I thought about those first few years.  Before the dementors really…well, there were still a few Black properties I could have raised you at if I got out.  Probably best I didn’t, I found out many got raided and sold by the Ministry after my imprisonment.”
Ron tapped the wood a few more times before taking a deep breath and exhaling.  “Probably.  He stayed after on Friday to ask her something.”
Harry gasped suddenly, jerking as an odd sensation bloomed in his mind.  Nimble little fingers seemed to touch his mind, rifling through it gently and he shivered from the new feeling.
Sighing, he gave up.  Dropping his hand from his head, he glanced at the clock on his bedside drawer.  It was just about the usual time he got up, albeit a bit earlier.  For a moment, he just sat in his bed and wondered whether or not he should stay for a bit longer.  He could find no reason to so he dragged himself out of his warm bed and stood up, walking over to his trunk to get out his uniform.
There was an odd silence following his statement, Qye staring at the floor, bouncing between irritation and something he hadn’t felt for a long time.
From the corner of his eye, he saw the vampire woman make a move towards them and Qye hissed at her, stiffening as they walked next to the bed, putting himself between her and Harry.  “Fuck off!”
“I’m not a teacher anymore, Mr. Malfoy,” Remus said carefully, considering the atmosphere as Sirius moved restlessly in place.  “Remus, please.  Mr. Lupin if you have to.”
Much as he had done the past six years, Lest closed his eyes and ignored that voice, turning away and walking back to the desk where he sat and stared down at all the plans and accords and letters that waited for a decision.
She flicked her wand, a copy of the report and its recommendation neatly conjured in front of each of the adults in the room.
.’ He glanced at the vampire, who still wasn’t looking at any of them, cool and and distant once more.
“I think Ms. Granger is right, actually,” Myn’s soft voice broke in gently and he blinked, turning his face to her. Her bright, concerned eyes fixed on him and he desperately fought the urge to just drop the act and throw himself at her, harshly reminding himself that she didn’t know it was him, that she was talking to -
He sighed and opened his eyes half way, looking at the flames licking at the logs in the fireplace.  He guessed that was why they were worried.  When he talked, he hardly said anything about how he was feeling.  Hermione often asked him how he was and he always answered with a simple “Fine” before changing the subject.  Her annoyed and frustrated looks plagued him for the rest of the day.  He rolled his shoulders uncomfortably, remembering the hurt in her eyes when he brushed off the questions.
“Really?” Ron asked sarcastically, looking at Hermione in slight annoyance.  “Well, gee, I hadn’t noticed.  I always thought it was spring when we came back.”
"Remember," Professor Opacre said, voice faraway, as Harry and Lest stared at each other. "Use whatever means necessary to incapacitate my brother, Harry." In the corner of his eye, he saw her hand lifting.
is anymore! Damn it, Harry!” Ron cursed, dropping to the seat next to the bed and glaring at him. “We’re your friends, treat us as such and not like everyone else who doesn’t know who you really are.”
Jumping, Harry whirled around at Seamus’ shocked shout, startled and alarmed.  His brow furrowed at the staggered look on the sandy-haired boy’s face, the blue eyes almost popping out of his face.
“Enough of that now,” she said gruffly, sniffing loudly and holding onto her bag.  “The kind of people they let here nowadays, hardly a moment’s peace.”
“Where do you think?” Ron managed to snap back as he shook him off, adrenaline coursing through him.  He saw Hermione and his sister pulled back into the group of students as Sinistra put down another beast.  He met Hermione’s worried eyes and saw her glance over to Malfoy next to him.  “Probably right in the thick of this, as always.”
“I think this is a little more than gossip,” Zabini said dryly at the same time as Seamus grinned widely and answered with a cheerful, “Nope!”
It was only the next day that Marylin realized that her brother had erased Qye’s face from her mind.
“No, after that,” Qye interrupted roughly and Sirius looked at him, confused by the way the teenager stared at him, wary and oddly tentative.
"I said," Ron muttered irritably, pushing his food around with his fork, "I wish the Professors would take a look at their calendars and notice what time of the year it is."  He glowered up at the enchanted ceiling that showed light snow cascading down into the Great Hall.  "As if it weren't obvious enough," he snorted, taking a bite out of his meat pie.
He frowned slightly as he noticed the teenager pick up the sunflower stalk.  Glancing around, he saw the rest discarding the stalk and only using the petals.  Turning his eyes back to
In the distance, somewhere far way, maybe the classroom, he heard people screaming and crying out.  He thought he recognized one of the screams as his own.
“I don’t trust them,” the Malfoy heir said again, his mouth tightening and ice burning in his eyes. His godfather sighed and in an uncharacteristic gesture, laid a sympathetic hand on the young man’s shoulder.
"I'm afraid Hermione here threw most of them out," Harry continued dryly, "but your sentiments were well understood, thanks."
“Ron, don’t be so biased,” Hermione reprimanded, but she too glanced uneasily at the vampire.  “I’m sure Dumbledore knows what he’s doing.  Don’t you think so, Harry?”
“They’re on the grounds,” Lest interrupted, stretching out as much as he could.  He tried to stifle his frustration that he could not see the entire castle but he knew where the trouble waited.
From his safe spot in the small alleyway, Harry watched from the corner of his eye as other students hurried over to the Three Broomsticks, all dressed up.  He leaned against the cold wall of Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop, twisting the bracelet Professor Opacre had given him.
“Alright,” Hagrid suddenly said loudly, grinning slightly.  “Well, seems you got yer horse for the quarter, Harry.”
He idly played with his quill as he watched the other boy read his essay.  They sure didn’t act like rivals anymore.  He couldn’t even remember the last time they had a real fight, with heated words and wands ready to come out at any moment.  Sure, they still argued, but it was less serious now.  If Harry was honest to himself, it was more like friendly bantering than anything else.
The memory of the force trying to hold him back came to him and he quivered at the thought, looking up at the old wizard, fear flickering in his eyes. He opened his mouth uncertainly, then closed it again and rested his head back on his knees.
“How are you okay with that?” he hissed at Remus, alternating his glare between his friend, between Lest, between Dumbledore himself because the vampire was still here.
And he knew, he knew even as his forced his body up, up and staggering and pushed himself with his eyes fixed on the other boy who looked exactly like him, all broken and twisted up on the inside, what to do.
“You’re half a person,” Lest said, his voice strained.  “She says you’re capable of critical thinking.  If you have any sense of rationality left, you know this is stupid.”
“Ms. Nilsson, please,” the Healer protested and Lest saw him standing in front of a black-haired teenager sitting in a chair between the beds.  Smethwyck had his hands raised and Lest vaguely noted a flash of frustration cross the man’s face as Lest walked further into the room, right behind Nilsson who was reaching out a hand to start scanning, the confused frown on her face deepening.  “Wait, please, just give us a moment - ”
“Harry,” was all the Animagus said and the werewolf wasted no time, scrambling for their meager belongings.
“Anyway,” Hermione said, her voice higher than usual taking Harry from his thoughts and focusing back on her to see a full out blush covering her face, “Malfoy must have meant that…well, not yet, I don’t have anyone to go with.”
:: growled the voice.  The black-haired teenager just snuggled closer into his covers.  The voice sighed.  ::
“I understand, Headmaster, I’ll make sure I have my notes prepared,” Smethwyck reassured.  He lifted his wand to Harry again, a soft blue light pulsing gently.  “In the meantime, I do have one more recommendation.  While they are both healthy, I think it would be best to limit their interactions with others until after the evaluations.  I will run point with them to make sure they remain physically stable with Madam Pomfrey’s support and Ms. Nilsson consulting as necessary.”
It was right when he was passing Seamus that his vision blurred and before he knew it, he suddenly hooked his leg around the leg of the Irish boy's chair and yanked, dropping Seamus on the floor. The fuzziness faded and Harry came back to himself to find everyone staring at him.
“Are you sure you’re not coming down with something, Ron?” Qye replied, raising an eyebrow and forcing a playful grin onto his face. “I mean, really, do you know how ridiculous that sounds?” He forced a slight laugh, making sure that his eyes weren’t narrowed or full of suspicion. They would suspect something if he showed signs of suspecting them. “Really…me not being me. Who else would I be?”
“You don’t understand, Albus,” Fudge said, a touch of desperation in his voice as the older man began to guide him out.  “The reporters are out for blood and - ”  He stumbled over his words and glanced wide eyed over his shoulder.
Draco tilted his head and took another step closer, leaving barely a handspan between them.  “You never told me no.”
’ The teenager became aware of the wetness that covered his cheeks and blurred his eyes. He blinked and heard his soft, frightened gasps. Closing his eyes, he felt the cool metal of his glasses placed back on his face lightly. Opening them once more, he saw Dumbledore’s solemn blue eyes looking down at him.
“You should know I would have updated you if anything changed,” Marylin said abruptly, taking a step towards the teenager and raising her hand.  “Draco, I know things are - ”
“Maybe I just finally hit the point where I’ve about had it with what life throws at me,” Harry said flatly.
“Lest?” Harry blurted out, blinking rapidly as his hand dropped away from his wand.  His heartbeat started to settle from where it had begun to pound furiously against his chest.
“Brilliant,” he whispered, his dark green eyes taking in the beauty of the landscape. “To hell with whoever said green earth isn’t more valuable than grey industry.”
He was less impressed by Lest’s stare turning onto Harry, still stone-faced.  “Harry, what I did - ”
“Best for who?” Qye said bitterly and Smethwyck sighed.  Before anyone could say anything else, Dumbledore stood and eyes turned to him now.
“Voldemort?” Harry said quietly as he buttoned up his shirt.  Ron shivered.  “No, Ron, I haven’t had any of those dreams for a while now.”  The redhead saw Harry shiver a bit.
Professor Opacre went quiet, eyes still watching the suspended stone. Then she turned her eyes to the silent class and smiled slightly. "Or, at least, that's the fairy tale our parents tell us." She winked and the spell was broken.
“You will not harm the boy, Tom,” warned Dumbledore and Marylin had never heard such a cold voice from the Headmaster, so different from the wizard she had seen all year, warm and welcoming with twinkling eyes.  “Let him go and leave while you still have a chance.
Qye refrained from curling his lip in contempt at the thought of connections instead of competence, refrained from unleashing the scathing commentary at the tip of his tongue as he studied the woman with laugh lines at the corners of her eyes and the streaks of white hair in her neat ponytail despite her youthful face.  He made no move to look at Harry, curled up in an armchair next to him, still looking drowsy even though they had woken up less than an hour ago.
“We should go now,” a quiet voice said and the three men turned to look at the forgotten woman, looking down at the ground.  Marylin glanced up and then looked back down again as she walked in between them, down the hallway.  “He’s waiting for us and my brother is not doing well with patience right now.”
The following weeks were harder, the studying for O.W.L.s finally coming to the forefront.  The only good thing about it was that the whispering gossip slowed down, the other students dragged into their own studying and no longer fueled by Draco and Harry spending visible time alone together.
Dark green eyes stared up at the ceiling, clouded with sleep, half-closed and blinking slowly. They traveled around, looking languidly up at the white ceiling, the pale sunlight casting small beams across it. They flickered closed again.
He lifted his head and glanced to the left to find Malfoy looking at him with a sharp gaze.  Scowling slightly, he jerked his hand free, his mouth tightening as he remembered the Slytherin’s words in the corridor.
,’ Jonas sighed inwardly, beyond irritated and tired because he knew what argument was coming and there were frankly more concerning matters he'd rather be spending time on, such as the two young men he left Poppy with, who at least was making an attempt to handle the unusual situation with her usual brisk professionalism.   “Who the hell said you get to make a decision on his treatment?”
“Fine,” he finished lamely. Professor Opacre raised an eyebrow and Harry blushed slightly. He rubbed his forehead slightly, heat beginning to rise in it as well as a mildly painful throb.
“Pater,” a careful voice spoke and Qye narrowed his eyes as he watched Lest twitch, his own nails digging into the wooden bedpost.  “I will step outside.  I trust Healer Smethwyck will reach out when he needs to.”
“I think this is it!” she said excitedly, almost skipping over to him.  “This will most definitely work tonight!”
The boy with the lightning bolt scar continued to stare, not knowing that his future was being shaped.
,’ Lest thought, staring at the back of the head of the young man he had spent an hour fighting to stay with, fighting for days to save, fighting years to reunite with.  The arguing voices of the healers, the gasps and shouts of the others fighting for entry, they all faded away as he stared at him, finally awake.
She tried to follow his gaze but all she could see was a wave of all her students, some dancing more enthusiastically than others.  And then she saw a few of her older students slowly making their way over to her.  She tilted her head as she saw them focused on -
"We haven't reached this part of vampire culture yet," she said absently, pushing back a sleeve of her robe. "It's discussed later in your texts despite the fact that this is a keystone aspect of our society." As her sleeve was firmly tucked up, a small silver bracelet on her wrist was revealed from which a small stone hung suspended on a delicate chain. "At the beginning I was unsure as whether or not I should present this but giving that it
“As soon as you stop looking like a ruddy green vam - ” Ron stopped and looked warily at the Head Table. “Like crap,” he finished, eyeing the DADA professor and her brother.
“Didn’t sleep at all looks like,” Seamus muttered as he eyed the ruins on the bed, the sheets still tucked in.  Neville bent down and carefully put some of the books back in the trunk, still uncertainly looking at Harry.
’ Harry mused as his eyes quickly scanned his messy writing while munching on his piece of toast.  ‘
“Bloody hell!” Ron shouted as he dodged another swipe from the clawed hands of a beast.  It lunged forward and tried to grab at his knees, to pull him down as the one before him.
“You just don’t seem like yourself,” Weasley’s voice came from beside him and Qye narrowed his eyes slightly as he turned to the redhead.
It was a Friday night as Harry flipped through one of the supplemental texts Professor Opacre had advised when Qye suddenly said
Cool emerald eyes clashed with interested cobalt eyes, Lest raising an eyebrow as Harry gave him a steady look.
Sighing mentally, he returned his concentration back to his Potions essay, tapping his quill against it while wondering what to write next.
“I’ve had worse initial intakes,” Wainscott shrugged lightly, leaning back and picking up her notebook again and making another note.  “But for the sake of time, I believe we should continue.”
:: Qye muttered, flipping through Harry’s memories.  Harry hushed the other boy but silently agreed with him.
“Talk to you soon,” Draco murmured against his skin before he pulled back and walked away, leaving Harry alone in the silent corridor.
“Shit,” he whispered, shaking as he uncurled his fist and wincing as he flexed it.  He hadn’t thought about it, reacted to the fangs immediately, but the battle had other vampires.
Turning around, he looked down the shadowed hallway.  Slowly, his feet walked down the corridor as if having a mind of their own.  They led him down the hallway, slowly and hesitantly.  Then they stopped.
“Really?” Harry said, a little disbelieving as he looked at the blond.  “Four years of what can at best be called rivalry and now we’re…” He made a small gesture with his hand, brows furrowing as he frowned slightly.  “What are we doing?”
’ she mused as she watched the list of students that were all enrolled in this class appear on the parchment.  She shook her head and banished the thought.  ‘
"You don't honestly think I'm that stupid, do you?" Lest asked calmly. Harry's eyes widened and he felt his shock echo from Qye. "I think it's okay if I break some of my limits with you...Harry."
“Listen,” she said dryly, “the house-elves go through a lot of trouble to prepare my meals.  I don’t fancy ruining my appetite and having a bunch of mini elves crying and weeping because I didn’t finish my meal.”  There were a few laughs at this and she smiled in relief, glad that she managed to stop any rifts before they began.
"Now," Snape smiled unpleasantly.  "For our demonstrator. . ." Cold, black eyes looked straight at him.  "Mr. Potter," he said silkily, "your potion seems adequate enough.  Stand up and drink it.  Describe the effects."
“Again, medical professional,” he said, watching her scan the latest summary he had written the night before.  “And, as you can now read, I’ve been under quite a bit of pressure.”
“Haven’t you learned anything from me this year?” the Slytherin growled, putting down his own quill and scowling at the black-haired boy.  “It’s sim-
“Harry, move, can’t you see Ron’s been enchanted?!” she shouted.  Ron leaned back as she turned to him, grasping his arm.  “Don’t worry, Ron, I’ve read all sorts of countercurses and Madam Pomfrey will surely - ”
Tearing his eyes away from the breathtaking site, Qye forced a smile for a curious Granger, jogging to catch up with the group.
“I don’t know,” Harry blurted out.  Hermione blinked and he took a step back, resisting the urge to run his hands through his hair, remembering how Draco had complimented it earlier and how it made him feel.  He squeezed his eyes shut and pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Hermione, I don’t…”  He slowly exhaled as he dropped his hand and opened his eyes again.  “I have no clue what I’m doing,” he admitted, dropping down on one of the benches in the small decorative garden.
“Hand it over,” Malfoy said promptly and Harry wordlessly handed his essay over.  As the Slytherin skimmed through the essay, Harry looked at the pale boy thoughtfully.
“Next March,” she said in an even voice, “I shall be turning twenty-five.”  The room went dead silent and some of the people turned pale.  She cleared her throat and continued.  “I know that most of you think that by being a vampire, you’re privileged to being young forever.  Unfortunately, that isn’t true.  We do live for a much longer time than wizards and humans but even we have an age limit.  I don’t personally know any vampire that has died of old age but I know that there have been some.  Most die before they manage to reach that point however.
His idiot twin fortunately seemed to know what he was thinking and closed his mouth quickly, wincing.  “Sorry, cousin,” Jacob muttered, lowering his eyes to the floor, a submissive look on his face.  “I was just saying - ”
Lightning crackled outside their safehouse, its light bouncing off the glass Sirius held.  He watched it as it flashed and quickly dissipated but the memory it ignited lingered.  All he had of Harry were baby memories, that wretchedly bittersweet night two years ago, the brief moments the year before in Hogsmeade and countless letters.
Ron looked away and saw Malfoy’s merciless gaze on the vampire.  Silver eyes met his and he took in a deep breath, turning back to the remaining vampire.
"So it is," she sighed, walking over to the middle of the room. She held out her hand and Lest gave her Hermione's wand, which she returned to the dazed girl.
“I don’t know what anyone can do,” Harry said, gently breaking Hermione’s hold as he turned away from her.  “Unless you know a way to help me get these thoughts out of my head,” he mumbled.
Qye’s mouth jaw hung open as he stared at Harry indignantly.  Harry rolled his eyes at him and his mouth snapped shut as he gave him a withering look, unclenching his fists and rubbing his aching palms on his thighs.
“Apology accepted,” the Opacre replied coolly. His dark blue eyes flickered. “I…I apologize for making you fall out of the tree.” Myn squeaked, her eyes turning into saucer-sizes.
Draco looked up from reading a book in the section on Charms, and Harry froze as he remembered how they left things.
::  The person went silent suddenly and he grew slightly worried at the pause.  Before he could say anything though, the voice continued.
He had barely taken a step away when Malfoy’s hand flashed out and grasped his wrist.  Frustrated, he turned back around to face the other boy, his eyes flashing angrily at him.
Struggling to keep up his façade while inside, Qye lashed out waves of fury in his mind, fear and confusion rolling over him.
’ He stumbled back, looking at Harry’s wide-eyed face looking at him. He snapped his eyes – and saw Harry’s eyes imitate him – closed and took in a deep breath. Then he opened his eyes again and looked at the familiar face.
"Now then," he heard Professor Opacre say and from his peripheral vision, he saw the female vampire raise her arm. It hung there for a moment, and then dropped.
“You,” he heard Professor Sprout cough from where she stood next to Neville, who had returned to assist her despite his shaken look.  “You’re the ones Professor Opacre - ”
She smiled faintly and straightened up from her desk, which she had been leaning on.  “Are you still uncomfortable with me, Mr. Potter?”
“No,” Ron said flatly.  He jabbed a finger at the smirking Malfoy, ignoring Harry and Hermione’s confused looks.  “No, no and, I cannot possibly say this enough, no.”  He turned to Harry, who was staring at them both.  “I realized he tricked you into saying yes but you do realize you don’t have to go along with everything he says?”
“He’s still here, 'Mione,” Harry helpfully pointed out as they rounded a corner and the Great Hall’s light poured out into the corridor ahead of him. “And he’s feeling perfectly fine, thank you very much. What he does not need is to spend any more time in the Infirmary or he might go mad and take it out on poor innocent brunettes who act too much like his mother.”
The green-eyed boy looked at Seamus in confusion before turning to his best friend in puzzlement.  He blinked when he saw the knowing grin on the redhead’s face and he felt his bewilderment grow even more.
“I didn’t think it would be something you want to hear from a man you barely met and knew, Harry,” Remus replied, turning his gaze to him, a trace of apology finally entering his eyes.  “Keep in mind, I had no knowledge of your relationship with your relatives besides what I heard in rumors.”
A few gasps of horror met her statement but instead of accusations and shouts, silence was the vampire's overwhelming response. Harry could see a bunch of students staring at her, some with looks as if they were expecting such a thing and were justified in mistrusting her, some with wary looks as if unsure of what to think. Others were looking hopeful, as if waiting for an explanation so they could continue to trust.
She raised her hand and sent up a shield too late as Harry jerked free from a Death Eater, lifting his wand to stun him, stumbling a few steps, raising his eyes.
“I didn’t realize you and Malfoy were on such terms,” Lest said, tilting his head as his jaw clenched slightly.
Everything seemed hazy in his mind, clouded and confused with a few blank pieces floating around as well. He didn’t know what happened, couldn’t concentrate enough to think. All he knew was that he was stuck in the Infirmary – again – recovering from an apparently serious fever.
Once Ron and Hermione were thoroughly engrossed in their own studying, Harry subtly used his wand to copy the potion onto a blank piece of parchment, tucking it between Defense Against the Dark Arts notes.
“As unconcerned as you may about this, I am not, Mr. Potter,” Madam Pomfrey said, frowning slightly at the bickering teens before turning her look on him. “I would like to keep you over the weekend just to make sure that you’re completely recovered and this…memory lapse…won’t happen again.”
Professor Opacre looked coolly at him, her smile fading away.  “Yes,” she said calmly, meeting the blond’s incensed look serenely.  “He’s arriving tonight and he’ll be staying here for a while.”
“I didn’t give him that shirt,” Malfoy said slowly, his brows furrowing.  He glanced over at Harry, who was suddenly very interested in his butterbeer.
,’ he thought firmly to himself as he surreptitiously began to relocate his bacon and sausage. Ron was gulping down at lightning speed so he doubted the redhead or brunette would notice any more food added to the Weasley boy’s plate.
A flush graced Harry’s cheeks and he shook his head rapidly.  “No, no,” he said quickly, blushing further under the vampire’s amused gaze.  “I…I d-didn’t mean to call you that old – I mean any old!  I just called you sir because…well…you’re young but you’re not that young.”  A horrified look came into his eyes.  “I mean…um…sir….ah! Wait, sorry sir – gah!  I mean - ”
,’ she said, smiling slightly as she looked at her chatting with her two friends, Ron and Harry.  Her smile faded and she looked thoughtfully at the green-eyed boy who was smiling slightly at his friend’s enthusiastic attitude.
outfit as Professor Opacre cheerily continued her torture in the guise of finding him the perfect outfit.
you?”  All the while, his dark little eyes looked wildly around the hallway for something to use a weapon.  He spotted a hammer lying against the wall.  Quickly, he lunged for it –
Jordan glanced nervously at Verna who was still knitting, wondering why she was allowed to be at ease and if she knew it was her turn to present herself.
“We have to stop him, he just woke up!” the Healer’s voice shouted and the woman shouted again, “The Pater will kill anyone who goes near him like this, you fools, stand down!”
Before he could say anything, a quiet laugh came above him.  He glanced back at the vampire…and blinked when he saw a small, pleased smile on the pale, amused face.  Harry looked confusedly at the laughing eyes.
“So I was right.” Harry blinked, startled, and Ron and Hermione jumped beside him. Turning around in their chairs, they found Professor Opacre looking worriedly down at Harry.
All that time he spent trying to find reasons as to why the voice of a ten year old boy suddenly appeared in his head, ignoring all the signs that indicated he lost his mind, the blurry memories that so conveniently hid the truth.
Leon frowned slightly.  “The Dazain threat right now is extremely low, I told you that. They’ll be nothing in a couple of months,” his bull voice rumbled.  “And if they join Voldemort…” He sighed and rubbed his eyes.  “Well, even if your plan with Dumbledore doesn’t work, we’ll still beat them though it might take longer.  And if your plan does work…well, the Dazains won’t stand a chance.”  He paused.  “Why do you ask?”
Dazain slowly turned to look at the suddenly grimacing Harry, a considering look growing on his face as the expression of rage once again crossed Voldemort’s face.  The vampire holding Harry roughly jerked him, making Harry grunt and Lest twitch as Voldemort slowly turned back around to the teenager.
“What was what all about?” Hermione asked, having managed to move through the crowd and looking curiously at Ron and Harry.
- flinging a hand towards her and jerking as he saw her eyes widen shortly before she cried out and flew back, her body crashing into the other people, pushed out the doorway and onto their backs.
Harry unfortunately was unable to respond, seeing as he hadn’t managed to keep the polite look on his face.  A glare sneaked its way onto his face and his eyebrow twitched slightly as he looked heatedly at the vampire, whose amusement seemed to be growing.
“I asked for a moment, Draco,” Harry said softly, staring straight ahead, his steps slowing.  Draco stopped and looked furiously at him.  “I just wanted a moment to think about what you said and what the next step would be.  I had no clue he was there or what he was going to do or why.  I’m going to assume you didn’t either so I don’t know why you didn’t give me that moment.”
He blinked.  A small girl – no, a teenager? – stood in front of him, cracking her knuckles as she shifted her feet.  Her black hair was done in a short ponytail and he noticed an armband high on her bicep as she lifted her fists up.
Movement happened in his peripheral vision and he turned to see Ron lightly shifting from one foot to the next. He blinked, not understanding why Ron was doing such an odd thing but when he glanced back at Lest, the vampire's eyes had narrowed even further and a grimace had appeared on his face.
“That was back then,” Malfoy said stiffly, removing the ladle from his own potion.  “I don’t know if you may have noticed this or not but I haven’t tried to make your life a living hell this year.  I think I’ve been relatively well-behaved, don’t you think?”  Giving up all pretenses, the other boy turned in his seat and glared at Harry.  The Gryffindor refused to look at him, removing the ladle from his own potion and stubbornly glaring at it.
“I don’t know what the hell is going on,” Harry continued, heart beating rapidly as he slowly looked back and forth between them.  “Frankly, I don’t care.”
She stepped uncertainly closer to Lest, trying to think of how to soothe away the look on his face.  She had to stop that look before someone – likely Draco – got hurt and dimly wondered why Lest was so upset.  Before she could do anything, Lest turned away.
Harry stumbled away from them and ran into the Death Eater who held the wand on him.  The silver hand jerked him around and a snarl appeared on Harry’s face as threw himself at the Death Eater.
he thought, furrowing his brow. He turned back to the class and felt his mouth drop slightly in shock as he found almost every eye pinned on him, both Gryffindor and Slytherin. '
“Perhaps we should go, Frater?” Professor Opacre said mildly, placing a calming hand on her brother’s arm.
“We’re taking this a step at a time, right?” Harry reminded him, dropping his hand.  “There’s a lot I’ve got to wrap my head around.”
“Don’t give him so much credit,” Ron grinned.  His grin faded and he looked sympathetically at Harry.  “Besides, you don’t have it as bad as Harry here.”  He grimaced.
"That...that was good, Ron," Professor Opacre said unsteadily. Lest finally turned away from Ron, moving back to his spot as the redhead jerkily dusted himself off. The smirk was still on that face and green eyes stared at it until it disappeared. Only then did they slowly move to Professor Opacre.
The brown-haired man frowned at black-haired Saira.  “I was only saying,” Leon said in his mild voice, showing how insulted he was, “that we should not make light of the end.  As it is said, no war - ”
“Welcome back,” Ron muttered to Harry as the displeased Gryffindors turned to face the smirking Slytherins. Harry glanced sympathetically at Hermione when she let out a small sigh.
Dark blue eyes turned to the small, flickering fire in the hearth, the eyes half-closed and looking half-asleep.  The few people who had seen him with these eyes no longer graced the world with their presence and a cold smile came upon his face as he recalled this.  The smile faded when another part of the memory came to him.
:: Harry thought back, smiling inwardly.  He heard Qye chuckle quietly as Madam Pomfrey wrapped up her check-up.
He shook it off and clung to his current anger and looked up to see Lest throwing the man away, sparing a glance as the man crashed into someone with brown hair as his wand fell to the floor, blinking and thrown asunder because that was Myn next to them, Myn staring at him with her bright blue eyes wide and tortured, mouth open in dismay.
Harry opened his eyes and stared at the hangings covering Ron in his bed.  The redhead had not predictably gone into a fit upon learning what Malfoy had done.  No, instead he had adopted a curiously neutral expression, shrugged and made his way to dinner.  Harry had not questioned him more at the time in his dash after the blond.  It was only after he tiredly returned from his failed mission and stumbled upon Ron blandly telling Seamus that there was no point to asking out a person with a date.  Harry had glanced at Hermione, thinking for one moment it had finally happened but the bushy haired girl merely looked surprised, confused and suspicious.  When Harry had turned back, it was to Seamus (and most of Gryffindor House) practically jumping him and demanding in various tones the identity of his date.
“Now really,” Hermione suddenly interrupted.  The three boys turned to her and saw that she looking at them in annoyance.  She had given up her argument with Ron, who was now chomping on his dinner happily, glad she was going to go off on someone other than him.  There was an irritated and stern look in her eyes as she looked at them.
Harry’s eyes fluttered and slid shut again as Draco pressed harder against him, his hands settling tightly on his hips as his thumbs toyed at the edges of his shirt.
“Someone has to watch out for you if you won’t,” he grumbled.  “You’ve got the bloody survival instincts of a puffskein in a kneazle pen.”
Yelping, he jerked back in his chair, looking wildly around.  His eyes flew over to the boy across him as the blond let out a soft chuckle.
“Sorry, Harry,” she said, a bit sheepishly.  “But it is fun to pat you.”  And she patted him sympathetically.  Harry growled and spun around on his heels, quickly resuming their walk to the kitchens while blushing.  Hermione and Ron followed him, laughing slightly.
A short while later the door opened as Healer Smethwyck apologized to the woman standing guard, watching him sharply as he walked to the monitoring globe.  It spun slowly, its lines as steady as earlier that day.  He ran his finger across a small curve and glanced over the two occupants of the room.  He sighed and rubbed his eyes, mumbled about natural variations and another review in an hour as he walked back outside, carefully closing the door behind him.
The younger man stepped in from outside the room, quietly walking towards his godfather, his cool demeanor broken by the tightness around his silver eyes.
“Go away?” the vampire laughed quietly, his smile turning into a smirk.  “Just for that, I don’t think I will.”  The teenager’s eyes rolled and he stared in annoyance, causing the vampire to laugh again.  ::
“What about the Wiggenweld potion?” blurted out Fudge, taking a step closer and then two back, casting a wary eye to the beds as if they were contagious.  “I know there was promise to it - ”
“Which one are you asking?” came Harry’s subdued voice and Sirius turned his gaze towards him, saw how his bangs fell into his face, barely held back by the glasses slipping on his nose.  Sirius glanced back at Qye, taking in his features without the glasses, the way the teenager irritably pushed his hair out of his face, baring his scar-free forehead.
Before Harry could give his assent, a small book suddenly flew from Professor Opacre's desk, aimed right for Ron's wand hand. Harry sucked in his breath because if Ron lost his grip on his wand -
::  - Harry realized with a small start that the rummaging feeling was back and had been for a while - ::
Harry’s flush deepened and he tried to shove the other teenager, making Draco duck and back away with a small laugh.
“Right,” she said as she turned the page and crossed her leg over one knee.  “Well, unfortunately, you’re not getting off that easy.  Let’s go back to this subconscious potion…”
Qye’s breath caught as he heard the change in pronoun before he pulled back into his anger.  “You’ve never had any say in this, Lest,” he said bitterly, looking away and sitting back down.  “Why don’t you fuck off like you did before?”
Qye admitted as Harry inspected each part, making sure they fit properly.  Despite the adjustment charm, the shirt didn’t seem to get any lower than waistline and he mentally made sure to not raise his arms too much.
Marylin looked curiously at him but he didn’t say anymore. Sighing, she looked down and thought about the conversation they had with Dumbledore yesterday.
“Oh, no reason,” the redhead said offhandedly, his blue eyes still watching Qye, flickering oddly. “We can never be too careful, right? I mean, for all we know, you could be somebody else pretending to be our dear Harry, right?” Weasley smiled lightly but his blue eyes were locked on him.
“I’m their Prince," Draco responded loftily. "They may grumble, rumor, hiss, disapprove, call for my beheading and all that rubbish but in the end, I'm still the Prince and they're still plebeians."
By the time he had finished his breakdown in Dumbledore’s office, he had already missed all of Potions and the beginning of Care of Magical Creatures.  He had been embarrassed to have broken down like that in front of Dumbledore but the Headmaster had shook it off, saying things that Harry couldn’t really understand but made him feel slightly better.  Still, he had been more than ready to leave the office but Dumbledore wouldn’t let him leave until he promised to visit Madam Pomfrey for a Dreamless Sleep potion.
“It would seem a little more normal,” Harry snapped, rubbing his arm and shifting uncomfortably.  He glared at the suddenly calm looking boy, taking a step back.  “You can’t expect me to just accept you acting human all of a sudden, Malfoy.  No one can change as much as you seemed to have.  Frankly, I don’t trust you or your little act.”
“I want all of chapter one read by our next class and have review questions 1- 4 done,” she called out to her class as they began to pack up their things and leave.  She smiled and waved at them as they exited her class and beamed when some of them waved back.
He had seen the look in the vampire’s face when Harry had collapsed – he didn’t let himself think thrown – into his arms that night. Seen the delighted pleasure and hungry lust behind the gentleness.
Wormtail’s grip on his wand faltered, uncertain.  Harry felt his hand curl into a fist and threw with all its strength straight at the masked face of a traitor.  For a moment, there was no distance, no strangeness, just the knowledge that both Qye and he wanted this.
Two black-haired teenagers, unresponsive to anything magical or vampiric, lay in the beds in the Infirmary, Madam Pomfrey flitting back and forth with her wand constantly waving and circling and a tightness in her eyes the only show of her emotion.
“I mean,” Madame Pomfrey said tightly, her lips thin and eyes dark, “he left. He must have left soon after lunch.”
Harry sighed and closed his eyes, slumping back in his chair.  The fire blazed in the Gryffindor common room and for a few minutes, he just sat in his chair, listening the crackling and popping sounds.  It was a little past midnight and he was the last person in the common room, Ron and Hermione leaving just half an hour ago.  They had both argued for him to go bed but he simply didn’t feel tired.  In the end, they had both grudgingly gone to bed after he promised to go to sleep the minute he finished his essay.  Of course, he never said
“Fine,” the man laughed.  Instantly, the choking ceased and Petunia was left wheezing.  Dudley was crying now, and Vernon could smell the slight smell of urine emitting from his son’s side.  Vernon trembled, glaring at the man though fear filled him.
Asking Madam Pince for assistance was out of the question as well.  Even if he didn’t feel like he had the curious eyes of every Hogwarts student in the library on him – which was getting busier and busier as exams approached – he had no clue what he was looking for.
“Well…” Krista said hesitantly, looking nervously at the Pater Nosferatu.  She gulped under his cold gaze and spoke in a rush.  “Well, you see, some of the Dazains under Jeaneyl custody have been interrogated and by adding that with the information our informants having been sending us we’ve been developing a tentative theory about something the Dazains were planning to do before that final battle in Norway and even though the Dazains are pretty much crushed we’re still getting information that’s still pointing to the way the Dazains were planning on going to before - ”
“They’re on a date,” Ron said bluntly.  “For whatever reason Harry’s gone mental and giving the git a chance.  And I’m asking Hermione to dance because I’ve done my task as best friend but even I have limits.  Bugger off now.”  He turned to Hermione, whose cheeks were turning pink.  “Want to dance and get away from these idiots?”
"Anyway," she continued, looking away from her brother grinning, "once they finish Maturation, they come away as strong as they'll ever be with their jewel. So both Lest and I are at our peak, unable to get any stronger or weaker than we are now for the rest of our lives.
“Of course I am,” she said merrily.  “I’m a teacher.  I give you homework and tests.  I make you use your free time studying instead of doing fun things.  I am a tyrant over how you spend your time.  Therefore, I am nasty.”
“I suppose I just messed up my potion really bad,” he said hesitantly, as he looked up at the school nurse looking down at him.  She pursued her lips, her eyes looking thoughtfully at him for a moment.
He tore open his curtains in time to see Harry hurl a tray of potion vials at his headboard, shattering on impact and falling to join the mess of items on the barely slept in bed.  Books lay scattered on the bed, on the floor, the trunk at the foot of the bed wide open as Harry reached in for another object to throw.  One of the curtains hung loosely from a bedpost as if someone had tried to tear it off and the Firebolt was tossed carelessly aside.
She reached over with her free hand and dug her nails most unmercifully into the back of his hand.  She grimly smiled as he wrenched his eyes away from the crowd back to her.
“Don’t blame yourself for things you have not done,” Dumbledore said gently, sitting down on a chair next to Harry.  He tried to keep his eyes focused on the Headmaster but his eyes were getting so blurry.  He tried to keep his attention on the Headmaster’s voice but his ears were ringing.  He was so numb…
Ron and Hermione were once again bickering over something – Harry thought he heard the name ‘Viktor’ in the argument but he wasn’t quite sure – and Harry had to break them up as he pointed out the nervous looking first years who didn’t know where to go.
“Krista Jeaneyl,” she said, her voice trembling slightly from her nervousness.  Jordan recalled that this was her first – and possibly last – time in a meeting of the Opacre leaders.  “Representative of the Jeaneyl family of vampires from Europe, which is the Head family of the lower-caste class,” she continued, flushing a bit because of her status.  She quickly recovered and continued.  “Daughter of Nathaniel and Ginger Jeaneyl, cousins to the Heads of the Jeaneyl family who are David and Daniella Jeaneyl.  Loyal to the Opacre family of vampires and on the side of the Opacres.”  Krista sat back down and Jordan saw Jacob grin at her, which she returned.
:: the other boy muttered and Harry rolled his eyes.  He hardly noticed when he felt the other once again began to flip through his memories as he resumed in his search for his friends.  Memory-browsing had quickly become one of Qye’s favorite pastimes, much to Harry’s annoyance.
Snape flung the door open.  Harry couldn’t see around his billowing black robes or tall stature but he saw the Potions Master’s shoulders tense up and his hands tighten.
“Leave him alone already, Hermione,” Ron interrupted, finally managing to tug his hood up.  Hermione glared at him but he just glowered back.  “If Harry says he’s fine, he’s fine.  And if he isn’t, it’s because you’re hounding the poor guy.  So drop it already!”
Draco looked at him, his gray eyes dark and lost in thought.  Gray and green eyes met each other steadily, warily studying and weighing each other.  Harry firmly held the gaze, determined to figure out the other boy’s strange attitude once and for all.
Whatever she said, Lest sat in his chair once more, hunched over with his head in hand while his other shook and flexed.
“Gee, what would ever give you that idea?” Harry said sarcastically as he glared at his potion.  He spared a moment of his glare to the blonde.  “Why do you care if I’m angry at you or not?  You used to live to infuriate me, didn’t you?”
It was the last week of classes before break let out and a high feeling of anticipation filled the entire school.  All around, longing could be seen in the faces of the students and staff.  He could see the impatience and frustration in everyone's eyes as they sat through the long, slow lessons, waiting anxiously for the class to end and the vacation time to come closer.
Care of Magical Creatures, Charms, Potions, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration…all of them were with the Slytherins.  Oh yes, they had Astronomy and History of Magic with the Ravenclaws, and Herbology and Divination with the Hufflepuffs but it was clear that the Gryffindors had more classes with the Slytherins.
“Will the others be there as well?” he asked, barely biting back a growl at sharing a room with that cursed vampire so close to his godson.
“Sorry, Mother,” Harry muttered, taking a bite out of his toast.  Ron sniggered and Hermione shot him and Harry dirty looks.
“I understand that most of you don’t trust me,” she said quietly, moving her eyes around the class.  “I understand that most of you have grown up with stories and ideas about vampires, making my kind nothing more than heartless blood-sucking villains who delight in being what they are and have no remorse.  And I understand that given your upraising, you would all rather not have me as your teacher.”
"Shut up," Harry muttered to both of them, trying his hardest to bury his blush as he turned away from the Slytherin. Clearly his idea of actions and consequences failed to work at night. He fiddled with the straps on his book bag. "Talking to me in public? Won't that get you in trouble with your court?"
“Shut up, boy!” Saira growled, not taking her eyes off their cousin.  Jacob growled, leaning forward slightly and Jordan put a calming hand on his shoulder.  His twin bared his teeth at him but settled back down.  Saira ignored them and leaned forward, glaring at the Head of the Opacres.
The rage broke through and finally he let loose what he had been holding back since he heard Lest say he locked him away and left him behind.
Harry sighed and turned his head on the pillow, staring out the window at the half-moon sky filtering through.
When Harry woke up on the Monday following Lest’s arrival, he knew he should stay in bed. He knew that something really bad was going to happen when he opened his eyes to find that some idiot leaving a window open and him kicking off the covers in the middle of the night had led him to developing a stuffed up nose and sore throat.
Dumbledore moved forward, his powerful voice grimly crossing to Voldemort.  “If Harry is injured you will not leave well, Tom.”
Spells weren’t all she taught them, of course.  Each week she alternated with different subjects in DADA.  One week it would be spells; the next curses applied to objects and making them study and analyze the curse from afar before proceeding to find the appropriate counter-curse.  The week after that she had them studying a Dark creature and how to combat them.  And all the while, she managed to find time in every week to teach them something new about vampires.  Needless to say, Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were quickly moving from being a class to be afraid of to a class to wait anxiously for.
“And every year we throw it back in his face,” Hermione said calmly, letting go of Ron’s arm and walking to the Potions classroom.  “Don’t let him get to you, Ron.  Just think of how he might get humiliated this year.”
Thankful for the distraction, Harry grinned at them as they rounded the corner to the hall of the classroom.
Qye asked suddenly, causing Harry's wand to twitch and a wizarding chess piece to fly towards Lest. The vampire batted it aside carelessly, sharp blue eyes barely moving from Harry's face.
“Again,” said Jonas patiently, watching as Dumbledore carefully polished his glasses with a cloth from his robes, “as I told you before when we administered it two days ago, there has been no effects.”  They had administered the potion, with its power to awaken a person from a magically-induced sleep, when none of their other treatments showed any reaction in the sleeping pair.  And like everything else, it had done nothing except cause suspicious looks from the other staff on the case.
His pale lips curved into a humorless smile.  Well, his eyes weren’t the only thing that showed how pissed off he was.
