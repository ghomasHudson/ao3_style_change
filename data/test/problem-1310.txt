They couldn’t keep their hands off of each other. They got each other off in the shower, which earned them a disapproving stare from Anthony Goldstein who was brushing his teeth when they exited. They ate a quick breakfast in the Great Hall before wandering around the castle grounds.
A wet tongue swirled up Harry’s balls before finally licking up his hard shaft. Draco stared deep into Harry’s eyes as he swallowed him down, daring him. Harry knew what he wanted, but he could play a tease, too. Draco moaned as he took Harry deeper and faster. When the blond eventually let out a sound that resembled a whine, Harry laughed. “You’re such a cock-whore.”
“Indeed.” Draco stopped at a shelf full of Sleekeazy products. If only his grandfather hadn’t sold the company, Harry could have an unlimited supply of the stuff. Harry grabbed the purple bottle.
“Good. You should start collecting recommendation letters from all your professors. I’ll write you one this weekend. I’m proud of you, Draco.”
He shrugged. “It’s probably not the advice I’m supposed to give. But you’re only eighteen. And for the first time in your life, you aren’t fighting another man’s war. I don’t think anyone would blame you for taking some time to just…be.”
Draco cast the spell then set to work with his tongue. He reached around and jerked Harry off. It didn’t take long until Harry cried out Draco’s name. Draco smiled. He could get used to that.
Draco sighed. “Okay. But you’re not going to just replace me when another devilishly handsome delivery man shows up, right?”
He’d teased the poor boy long enough. Draco pulled Harry’s pants down, letting his weeping cock free. Draco was impressed, and he’d seen a lot of penises. “You’re thick. Really thick.”
Dennis Creevey, a recruit fresh from the Academy, banged his head on the desk. “No one told me fighting dark wizards involved mostly paperwork.”
“And sometimes, I get so scared to go out in public. I feel like I have to be ready for an attack at any moment.” Once he started talking, he just couldn’t stop. He told Draco about the darkest memories of the war. He told him about the guilt he felt for all the people who had died, and how he often felt like the whole war was all his fault. He told him about his inability to have relationships. It all came pouring out of Harry for the first time in years. The dark bedroom shifted to the pale grey that comes just before dawn. Harry had talked for over an hour, and Draco—he had just listened.
“Second, I think we have touched briefly on anger being a secondary emotion. Can you identify your primary emotion?”
Eventually, they found themselves back in front of Harry’s building. For the first time that evening, the two men stood in awkward silence.
“I don’t remember much about that night,” Harry reminded them. It wasn’t his fault that Lavender had an open bar. He tried to remember seeing Malfoy but he couldn’t.
He cast a tempus charm and nudged Harry awake. “We’ve got to meet everyone back in Hogsmeade in fifteen minutes.” Harry groaned. “Nope. You’re not sleeping through my first night out in over a year. Get up.”
The meeting with Kingsley and Dawlish went so well that Draco nearly jumped up and down like a schoolgirl when he and Harry exited the Ministry and blinked in the bright sunshine. It would still be nearly two months before the law hit the Wizengamot, but it was on the agenda, and copies of the law were being sent to every member. They encouraged Draco to go ahead and establish the charity so that training and public information could begin immediately if the law passed. Both officials seemed to think it would.
“Good.” Harry locked his arm through Draco’s and turned toward the door. He and Draco walked slowly back to the crowds where Celestina Warbeck was singing a song she had written for the victims. “Sometimes, being famous comes in handy.”
She went on to discuss the symptoms of depression and PTSD. Draco was shocked to learn that physical symptoms like nausea can manifest. He wasn’t crazy, then. Other symptoms she listed felt like she was singling Draco out. But when he looked around, he saw everyone looked uncomfortable. When she mentioned addiction and risky behavior, both Granger and Longbottom shifted in their seats.
Draco grinned. Their nearby friends expressed their happiness for Draco. Even Millicent smiled at him. His old friends were starting to come around, slowly but surely.
Harry shifted his torso and leaned forward to capture Draco’s mouth in his. Draco moaned into his mouth, and Harry’s cock sprung to full attention. He pulled Draco onto his lap and twirled his fingers in his silky, blond hair. Draco rutted against him, gasping and sighing.
Draco gave him a watery smile. Harry set the containers down and opened one. He pulled out a chocolate cupcake and handed it to Draco. Then he sat on the couch next to Draco, curled up his legs underneath him, and laid his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Oh.” He blushed, and Harry found it endearing. In school, he had never noticed how Draco’s face gave away so much. “I do, too.”
Harry looked up to see Malfoy gesturing to his left forearm, where he knew the Dark Mark lay behind the fabric of his shirt. “And where do I come in?”
“Because you’re emotionally immature and refuse to talk about things before they become a big deal,” Hermione replied matter-of-factly.
“Hermione, I need to talk to you.” She was laying on her bed reading a book. After a few weeks of the sleeping draught, she had returned to her bookish self. Sleep deprivation has terrible effects, Artemis had taught them.
He pulled himself out of Draco’s embrace and stood, taking special care to stretch all his tense muscles. Why on earth did he feel this way? He pulled on a pair of boxers and thought. Well, Draco was meeting Hermione and Ron today. Not meeting, per se. But being reintroduced years later...and as Harry’s boyfriend. It was a terrifying prospect. If Draco had been awful to Harry in school, he had been even worse to Ron and Hermione. Especially Hermione, what with the whole mudblood business.
“Well, fuck yes.” Draco reached for his wand and cast the cleansing spell. Then he handed Harry the lube. “Lots of lube. If you think it’s enough, use more.”
He felt bad for him. He can’t imagine how it must feel to discover something like that so late in life. And to grow up thinking it’s taboo. Poor bloke. He thought about how lost Harry looked when he came out of the shower. And how hot. Merlin, that boy was built well. All muscles and short and stocky. That messy, dark hair.
Harry swatted him. “We can be as loud as we want from now on. No silencing spells. No worrying someone will walk in.”
“I’m sorry. Did you say something?” He tried to be polite, tried not to give away the fear in his voice. He grasped his wand in his pocket, afraid to use it in case it looked as if he were violating the terms of his release.
“I do, though. Harry, Harry, Harry. Harry Potter. See, I was mean to you. So mean. And to Granger and Weasley, too.”
Harry laughed sardonically. He had fought a war and defeated the darkest Wizard of all time since he last saw Dudley. He tried to find a way to say it without sounding cruel. “Um, you know. We had that war.”
And Malfoy did. He ran his nails over Harry’s back as he fucked him harder, faster. Harry’s moans were punctured with sobs of satisfaction. “You’re so fucking tight, Potter.”
Draco stroked Harry faster as Harry sped up his own movements. With a shout, Harry spilled over Draco’s hand and their chests. He clenched down as he came, causing Draco to throw his head back.
“You saved me again, you git.” Draco bumped his hip against Harry’s. “Thanks. How’d you happen along my way?”
Harry ran a hand through his hair. He had no idea what to say. Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry. “She has no idea?”
Malfoy raised his wine glass to his lips. “Touche.” Then he launched into an explanation of reallocation of funds and fiscal years and some other boring terms that Harry tried really hard to pay attention to; instead, he found himself staring at Malfoy’s lips again.
Their Indian food soon forgotten, Draco launched himself into Harry’s lap. It wasn’t long before they made their way to the bedroom, an intense repeat of last night’s events. It was Harry who made love to Draco this time, eyes gazing into Draco's as he entered him. If Draco had felt made to fuck Harry, well, Harry might be even more made to fuck Draco. It was everything Harry had always craved from a shag but never gotten.
“She, um. She told me that if I don’t have a place to go after Hogwarts, I could come live with her. I don’t know how to feel about that. The Manor might be given back to me. But I’m not sure I could live there after everything.”
Artemis had them start by introducing themselves so she could learn all their names. They were to say their name, former house, and favorite dessert. How stupid. Draco fought against rolling his eyes. He had to play nice, or he could go to Azkaban. “Draco Malfoy, Slytherin, chocolate.”
“I do believe the people who have spent the last year with him would know better than you,” Anna bit back.
Draco watched Harry’s Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed hard. His arm was still thrown over his eyes. Draco waited.
Remus left the eighth-years alone. The Ravenclaw boys—Anthony, Michael, and Terry—announced that they would not be separated and took off to claim a room. Hannah and Susan offered to room with Millicent and Daphne so that the Patil twins could share a room. Hermione kissed Ron goodnight and followed Parvati and Padma to their room.
“You went through some pretty major shit, Harry. It’s okay that it still affects you. It’s not okay to just pretend it doesn’t, though.”
Harry threw an arm over his eyes and muttered a string of obscenities. Then he was quiet for several moments. Draco tried to cool his shock and anger, realizing it couldn’t be an easy thing to talk about. Finally, Harry spoke.
“Yes. She’s Teddy’s grandmother. She was dropping him off to Remus, and I ate lunch with them. Look.”
Harry wrapped a wet hand around Draco’s cock. Draco had a great cock, if he was being honest. It wasn’t as thick as Harry’s, but it was well above-average in length. It was good for fucking.
“I know most of you are probably not very happy about this situation. But the more you are willing to open up, the more healing you can do. We have a very important rule in these sessions. What is said in here, stays in here. Do not go discussing a group member behind their back. People may say very personal and vulnerable things. You wouldn’t want them airing your secrets. Don’t do it to them. Can everyone agree to this?”
Harry couldn’t help feeling suspicious; old habits die hard, after all. Not to mention that seeing both Malfoy and Dudley had made all his nightmares and anxiety return. But despite his wariness, Harry could not figure out what sinister thing Draco would be up to. Any possible explanation he came up with were all innocent. Harry had also become extremely horny and visited the bars a couple nights a week, although he was quite sure this had nothing to do with Draco. He had a few dates that went well enough to become second and third dates. But none of them were relationship material.
“Um. I don’t know. Whatever.” But his brow furrowed. He did know, and he was going to make Draco pry it out of him.
It was Hermione’s turn to laugh. “Hello? Don’t you remember when he came out in fourth year? It was the talk of the school for a solid fortnight.”
Harry perched on the sofa with crossed legs. He closed his eyes and counted his breaths, focusing only on the inhales and exhales. When he felt his heart rate slow a bit, he took an inventory of his body, paying careful attention to what was tense. He pushed every non-mindful thought out of his head; after so many years, he had become quite skilled at meditation. Then, he concentrated on all of his senses. He could hear the ticking of the clock and muffled voices from the down the hall of the building. He took note of the way the leather cushion felt under his rear. He could smell the leather and wood of Draco’s furniture.
Half of the eighth year students were in this session. The Golden Trio, of course. Padma, Daphne, and Susan were the girls besides Hermione. Blaise, Neville, and Terry were the other boys. Great. His former nemesis, the sister of the girl he was betrothed to before the war, and his ex-boyfriend.
Whereas his trial and sentencing had been public, his hearing was held in a small, private room. No amount of calming potion kept Draco’s stomach from churning as they descended into the Ministry. He remembered the feeling of being imprisoned here all too well.  Three members of the Wizengamot and the Minister for Magic sat at a table. Draco sat in a lone metal chair opposite them.
Harry sat up and looked Draco in the eyes. “Stop thinking you deserve bad things, Draco. I didn’t know what the spell did. I could just as easily have cast a Protego Charm. I’m sorry I hurt you.”
The article was widely well-received. Draco and the Golden Trio gave interviews to the Quibbler, Witch Weekly, and other publications. Letters of support flooded in to the editors and to the members of the Wizengamot. There were a few people, of course, who didn’t think the government should stick their nose into people’s personal lives like that. Harry suspected Draco mentally added those names to a list of individuals to watch once the law passed.
“Sorry. It’s just, well, the war’s over, Malfoy. Aren’t we too old for petty shit that started when we were eleven?”
By the time they made it out of the shower, Harry had only thirty minutes to get dressed and get to the Ministry. Draco scourgified his clothes for him, then transfigured his jumper into a Slytherin green. “So no one knows you’re wearing yesterday’s clothes.”
“Good night, Draco.” Harry lay staring at the ceiling for a bit. He should have taken a bit more of the Dreamless Sleep, but he didn’t want to fall asleep so quickly that Draco knew he had taken a potion. He thought about quitting the Aurors, about the charity, about Draco. He was falling in love, was probably already there if he would just admit it to himself.
Draco shrank back into his armchair. Always with the yelling. He couldn’t take the yelling. Yelling. That was Lucius’ favorite pastime. Then when Bellatrix was in the Manor it was a war of yelling, and then the Dark Lord would yell at them to stop and...
Harry nodded. “Yes, well. This specifically.” He shifted onto his stomach and reached behind him to place the bow on his arse. Then he pushed himself up on his hands and knees and looked at Draco expectantly.
Dudley let Harry go, and Patrice stood. “We’re done here, Mr. Dursley. Daisy, it was lovely to meet you. Remember to try your best to control your magic. Mr. Potter, I’ll see you soon, I’m sure.”
“Don’t touch yourself. I don’t want you to come yet.” Draco’s voice was warm but commanding. Harry removed his hand.
Harrry let out a breath and looked at the sky. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a blank piece of parchement. He tapped it with his wand and said, “I solemnly swear I am up to no good.”
If Harry were completely honest with himself, it wasn’t just the quality of the food that made him place an order at Curry Cauldron again. But Harry was never completely honest with himself. After thirty-five minutes, he paced his apartment, eager for his delivery.
They stood, and Harry walked him to the door. “Can I take you on a proper date sometime? One where you don’t deliver the food?”
“But that’s just it. We’re friends. What if he says no and it ruins our friendship? What if he says yes? I’ve never been on a date with a guy. I’ve never kissed a guy! What if he wants to have sex? I don’t think I’m quite ready for that yet. I mean, I want to. He’s really fit. What if I bollocks this up? I’m not exactly Cassanova, Hermione.”
They both groaned. Harry’s was pure pleasure. Draco would be walking funny later with so little preparation, but he didn’t care. He sat still for a moment with Harry sheathed inside him. Once adjusted, he began fucking himself on Harry’s cock.
“Honestly, Potter.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Here, get the matching shampoo. It will help with the coarseness.”
The next semester brought with it a new task for the seventh and eighth years: career planning. Between studying for NEWTs, therapy sessions, and career meetings with their heads of house, Draco and Harry’s relationship turned into mostly late-night cuddles. In Draco’s first career meeting, Remus handed him a chocolate bar and a cup of tea in his small chambers. Teddy was playing on the floor with blocks and giggling at some unknown baby joke. He was sporting blond hair today, a sign that he was happy to see Draco.
“Slowly,” Draco reminded him. He knew from experience that the first time Harry felt how tight it was, he would want to thrust deep and start pounding.
Harry let out a breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding. He took Draco’s hand and led him back to the dorm. “Are you sure you’re okay?”
Harry stepped out of the Floo and gawked. Though Draco was a thin man, he was also extremely muscular. His pecs were well-defined, and his arms looked like they could easily pin a man to the bed. At least, that’s what Harry thought when he saw the half-naked wizard. His normally impeccably combed hair was wet and ruffled. Harry’s cock twitched at the sight. Draco was gorgeous. But he had a few deep, old scars down his abdomen that filled Harry with shame. He swallowed, conflicted.
Harry had never felt anything so wonderful. Draco’s arse was like a delicious vice grip on his cock. He moved his hips, fucking deep into the beautiful man below him. Draco’s nails were digging into his shoulders, pulling him closer.
“Wow, okay, sexist. It’s complicated because your relationship with Draco is complicated. I mean, two years ago, you nearly killed each other. But bloody hell, Harry. You fought Voldemort, multiple times. You led a battle. You
Harry’s prick jumped at the mention of toys but quickly settled back down, spent and exhausted. “Toys, eh?”
“I don’t know. Sometime far less embarrassing than two days into this relationship. What about you? When were you going to tell me?”
“You’re brave, too, Draco. I hope you know that. Brave for growing up with your father, for betraying Voldemort, for coming back to Hogwarts. Brave for making yourself vulnerable, for going to Azkaban to visit your mother. And you’re brave for taking a chance on me. Because Merlin knows, I’m a mess.”
His two best friends and his boyfriend gaped at him. He gulped his wine and plopped down on the IKEA sofa that had been the source of a legendary Ron and Hermione fight back before Hugo was born. “Sit.”
A serpent-green Oxford near the back drew his eyes. It matched his eyes perfectly, and it was quite the Slytherin shade. Draco might find it amusing. And hopefully attractive.
Draco’s hand unfastened the button of Harry’s trousers. Harry’s breath hitched. It was Draco’s turn to be jolted from the mood.
It was more than an hour. Draco and Harry fell asleep, a mess of arms and legs and blankets. They awoke in the early hours of the morning, giving each other sleepy kisses and gentle caresses.
Everyone said yes. “Good. This applies to me, also. I will not discuss what happens in here with my colleagues, your professors, or any other students. There is one caveat to this. If you say something that makes me believe you’re in danger or are going to harm someone else, I will have to discuss safety interventions with Professor McGonagall and Professor Lupin.”
Draco took his hand and got to his feet. Then he threw his arms around Harry and crashed his lips against the other boy’s. Harry froze for a half-second in shock before parting his lips and deepening their kiss. He parted his lips, inviting Draco in.
“I’m not sure what you want me to tell you. You’re friends. Say, ‘Will you go the Halloween Ball with me?’ That’s it.”
The first time he saw Draco Malfoy was in a Muggle coffee shop near the Ministry entrance on a Monday morning. Harry had been too entranced in his new mobile phone to notice that the blond man in front of him was his former nemesis. But when he approached the cashier, she informed him that his drink had already been paid for by the man. Harry looked around, confused, only to find Malfoy standing by the bar, grabbing his coffee from the barista. Malfoy nodded at him, expressionless, then left without a word. Harry tried to convince himself that he had imagined it, partly because he had definitely checked out the man’s arse as he left the coffeeshop.
“She’s as well as can be expected. I received a letter from her this morning. She’s been reading some Muggle romance author so must of the letter was about books.”
Finally, the Chief Warlock announced the Child Services Bill. It would establish a new department under the Investigation Department, hire social workers, and work in conjunction with the Wizarding Children Protection Society. It would criminalize child abuse and give the Ministry the power to investigate suspected adults and intervene in various capacities. It also included an education program for parents and educators. Dawlish opened the floor for final comments, but no one stood to speak. Harry heard Ron whipser to Hermione, “Is that a good sign or a bad sign?” Hermione shrugged. Harry felt Draco tense beside him.
“I think you’re right that it should fall under the DMLE instead of Magical Education, but should it go under an existing office or a new one? Pass the pad thai.” Malfoy held out his arm for the container of noodles on Harry’s other side. The two wizards were spread out at Malfoy’s dining table, also obnoxiously made of glass and sharp corners, with a myriad of documents and containers of takeaway.
But the third member of the Wizengamot seemed determined to see Draco hanged. And Draco was unsure if all four had to be in agreement about Draco’s sentence. His stomach roiled as the man harangued Draco about his past crimes.
Twenty minutes passed before Draco’s name was called. Andromeda squeezed his hand. Steve gave him a small smile. Draco threw his shoulders back and schooled his features into a haughty, cold look.
Dudley laughed. “Can I buy you dinner? I know Daisy must be getting hungry, and I promised her hamburgers. There’s an American restaurant on the second floor that’s quite good.”
“I was hoping so. I’ll pick up dinner. See you later.” He kissed Draco one more time for good measure and Apparated away to the Ministry entrance.
They embraced for the last few minutes, each sobbing into each other’s shoulders. But they had endured worse. They had survived worse. And they would survive this.
Draco bounced faster, harder. He scratched Harry’s chest in ecstasy. Harry never moved his eye’s from Draco’s face. He was enamored by the look of euphoria lighting up Draco’s features. And he wanted to make it even better.
“Drinks are on us at the Leaky in an hour!” Harry yelled to the crowd. Then he leaned into murmur in Draco’s ear. “Come on, you. We’ve got an hour to celebrate alone.”
Draco banged a spoon against his drink to call everyone to attention. He cleared his throat. “I want to thank all of you for your support. We’re really going to make a difference in this world. And I could not have done it without all of you, writing letters and testifying at the Wizengamot and talking to your friends. I especially want to thank Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley for their help. But most importantly, I could not have done it without the love of my life, your very own Savior, Harry Potter.”
Draco visibly shook himself and stood, brandishing his wand. “Yes, well, I’ll fix that in a moment.” With a few quick waves of Draco’s wand, Harry felt the clothes loosen, and the pant legs shrink. It took him a bit longer on the wrists of the suit jacket. He appraised Harry with a proud eye. “Much better. Now about the tie. Can you tie a double Windsor?”
“Did you not know? How did you not know?” Draco had known from his first wet dream that he liked boys.
The nightmares did not go away completely; Harry doubted they ever would. But they became far less frequent the more Harry confronted them. Whenever he woke panting and sweating, Draco woke, too, and listened to Harry talk out his dream. Whenever Harry’s anxiety rose about leaving the house, Draco noticed. He wouldn’t say much, just listen and squeeze Harry’s hand. Soon, that anxiety was nearly gone.
Draco stopped, ready to move along to Harry’s grand finale. His own cock was aching for release. He slathered his fingers in lube.
“My Auror. He took me in. The Ministry put me under house arrest with no house until school started. He believed in me. Told me I was a good man.”
He disappeared into the loo, and Harry could hear him rummaging through a cabinet. He stood awkwardly waiting, stark naked and feeling vulnerable. Draco returned a few moments later and held out a tin. “It’s a dittany salve, but there’s no burn. You’ll be right as rain within a couple minutes.”
“I need new friends. Anyway, things were getting pretty, um, heated. And then he just pulled away and left. No explanation.”
But he intertwined his fingers in Draco’s hair and moved Draco’s head up and down, faster and faster. He could feel Draco nearly choke, could feel the tight muscles at the back of his throat constrict. But he never stopped. Briefly, Harry wondered how many men Draco had practiced this on. But he pushed the thought away and lost himself in fucking Draco’s perfect, tight mouth.
He nuzzled his head deeper against Draco’s chest. Draco was stroking Harry’s hair, lost in his own thoughts. A whole year. His life had changed so much. In some ways, he couldn’t believe it had only been a year. At the same time, that night felt so far away.
“Well, if you get Os on your Potions and Herbology NEWTs, you will only need to do a one-year apprenticeship. I don’t think that will be a problem for you. If you get Es, it will be a two-year. You can start writing inquiry letters to Potions Masters. You’ll need to include your OWL grades, research you’ve done, and what you want your apprenticeship project to be.”
The rest of the evening passed without event. Draco could talk Quidditch and business with Ron. He and Hermione bonded over books, having shared tastes in both nonfiction and fiction. They both left with a list of recommendations to read. And they all cared for the child abuse law. Hermione didn’t even act upset when Harry told her he quit the Aurors. She did gripe at him for calling her Jean Granger, though.
Draco smiled. “Excellent. I’ll see you tomorrow at one.” His face disappeared from the flames, and Harry was once more left alone with his thoughts. He sighed. He had just given himself a deadline. There was no avoiding it any longer.
When Harry entered Kingsley’s office, he noticed how little had changed in here since the end of the war. Somehow, Kingsley had barely aged; it must be that his bald head didn’t have any hair to turn grey. He had redecorated the office only once—after he was given the position officially. It felt comfortable, which was good, because Harry was nervous. He always left ceremony at the door with Kingsley, old war buddies and whatnot. But today, he did not collapse in the oversized blue armchair. He stood nervously.
The Leaky Cauldron was packed, as it always was on the weekends. People waved at Harry and looked at the small girl in curiosity, but to his relief, they were left alone. He had taken a Calming Draught before he left home that morning, just to be sure he could handle the outing. He introduced Daisy to Tom the barman then took her out to the small patio behind the pub.
Draco won, and he gloated like he usually did. Harry smiled at him, instead of throwing light-hearted insults about cheating his way.
Harry shifted in his seat. Draco was enjoying this way too much to stop. “Now, there was one more boy in your dorm, right?”
Harry bit his lip and sighed as he slipped off his own pants. Draco couldn’t believe how irresistibly sexy he was. Draco pointed to his wand, and Harry handed it to him. He cast the cleaning charm and summoned the good lube from his nightstand. The stuff they could conjure wasn’t ideal for anal. And it had been a long time since Draco had had more than his or Harry’s two fingers up his arse.
Harry chimed in. “Yes, I lived with them so Voldemort could not find me or hurt me. Your grandma is the sister of my mum.”
Harry blinked in surprise. He wasn’t imagining it. Draco’s face was floating in his fireplace. “Oh, hey.”
“I don’t think you have anything to worry about. Let’s pretend for a moment that when you leave Hogwarts, you’ll be free to do as you wish. What would you like to do?”
He walked up, hesitant to interrupt but eager to get out of there and head home. “Excuse me, Patrice? I’ve finished with the witnesses.”
“Ah, yes. Fuck. Move them around.” He used his own hand to show Harry how to scissor his fingers. He closed his eyes and let himself enjoy the stretch. “Another one, love.”
“Harry!”  A smack to his thigh jolted Harry back to reality. He blinked and found himself sitting in a compartment on the Hogwarts Express. Right. He absent-mindedly rubbed his leg where Hermione had smacked him.
“I could go on…or I could come back. And it was a hard choice. After everything, it was tempting to just go. But I came back.” Tears leaked out of his eyes and rolled onto the pillow. “Time moved differently there, so it was only a matter of moments. And then your mum came to see if I was alive. And, well, you know the rest.”
The rest of May passed in a blur of studying. Draco’s stress was amplified by the prospect of his and his mother’s hearings. His was scheduled for June 2nd, giving him time to finish his NEWT projects and take his tests before either being set free or locked away when the schoolyear ended.
He was yelling. When had he started yelling? He pressed the heels of hands into his eyes until he saw stars.
He placed a hand on Draco’s hip and gestured toward the door with a raised eyebrow. Draco nodded. They followed a large crowd of older students out of the Great Hall.
“Hello, Mister Malfoy.” She snapped her fingers and a house-elf appeared to take Draco’s belongings. “We have a seat ready for you in the Great Hall. There is an eighth-year table. After several meetings with the Minister and your appointed Auror, we have implemented a plan for your safety. But please, if you feel unsafe at any time, come to me or another professor.”
Harry disappeared from the flames, and Draco collapsed onto a sofa. He really didn’t deserve someone like Harry. The tears flowed freely down his face, and he didn’t bother to try and stop them.
Harry liked Dennis. He was no longer the annoying little boy from school. Dennis had decided to dedicate his life to stopping another wizard like Voldemort from rising to power. It was a nice way to honor Collin’s memory, Harry thought.
“Yeah. It was fine. I’m glad I spend most of the time in the back, but it still smells like owl shite and dead rodents.”
He felt Draco’s hardness press against him as he straddled Harry, and Harry’s own erection strained against his trousers. He put everything in his soul into his kiss, and Draco began grinding his erection against Harry’s. Harry moaned, and Draco moved harder. He turned his head and exposed his neck to Harry, who kissed and nibbled all the way down to Draco’s collarbone. He sucked and bit, hard, and Draco let out an animalistic moan.
Blaise looked torn. “Sorry, mate. I promised my mum that I wouldn’t associate with you. Social suicide, she called it. And she’s right. No hard feelings, yeah?”
As soon as they exited the Ministry, Harry Apparated them straight into Draco’s living room. “You did it, Draco! I’m so proud of you!”
Draco stepped away. Harry had barely noticed Draco tying the tie to his satisfaction. For a brief moment, Harry wondered if Draco really cared about the double Windsor, or if he had used some Slytherin conniving to get close to Harry. He pushed the thought aside. “Great. Ready to go?”
But Harry couldn’t hear him. He left the Leaky Cauldron and walked out into Muggle London. He was fuming. How could he have ever agreed to get a drink with Malfoy? What sort of sick mind games was he playing?
“Fucking hell,” Neville said as he entered the common room from the hallway, Luna in tow. “Those bastards had said I could have the room tonight. They can go into Hogsmeade, but Luna can’t.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair. Was Draco looking forward to these meetings as much as him? “Yeah. I got off work late. I’m famished.”
To top it off, Harry realized that he had taken Dreamless Sleep three nights in a row. He had to stop or risk an addiction. Maybe he could find a way to tell Draco he wanted to sleep alone. He looked at the sleeping blond and remembered last night. Yeah, he wasn’t sure there was an excuse good enough to get rid of Draco for a night.
Harry felt larger than life when he left the MInistry. He blinked in the bright sunshine. He was unemployed. Well, for now. But he was freer than he had ever felt, and he only had Draco to thank for it. He turned down an abandoned alleyway to Apparate back to Draco’s flat.
Draco shuddered. “No. The last thing I want to see is Luna naked. Too…female. And a relative, technically. Although Neville has gotten quite fit.”
Draco turned on his side to face Harry. He ran his fingertips over Harry’s chest. “I’m your bloody swot.”
Harry slept most of the day Saturday before meeting Ron and Hermione for a pint. Neville and Luna joined them. He always enjoyed their company, and he loved seeing them so happily in love.
He felt an odd sort of peace when he finally pulled himself from the bed. It was like a hangover with a touch of catharsis. But when he looked in his bathroom mirror, he realized he looked terrible. His eyes were red and puffy with huge bags underneath. He didn’t want Daisy to see him like this, and he certainly didn’t want Draco to see him, either. Harry summoned Kreacher and asked him to make the strongest pot of coffee he could, then he rummaged through his cabinets to find some sort of potion to make him look presentable. He took extra care picking out his clothes and threw on a Harpies scarf. He folded the eight pages of parchment he had written the night before and stuffed them in his jacket pocket.
“I love you, Harry.” Draco felt oddly emotional. “I love you so much. Thank you for, well, I could spend the rest of my life thanking you for taking a chance on me.”
Draco stood and gathered his things as quickly as he could though he felt like he was moving through molasses. He met Professor McGonagall at the front of the greenhouse. Her eyes were warm and sad. “This is a personal matter, Mister Malfoy. If you would like Mister Potter to join us, that would be acceptable.”
“Completely.” I’ve never once Splinched myself, he thought. But he decided not to mention Splinching at all.
Well, tears was an understatement. Earth-shattering sobs racked his body. Draco’s nausea returned, and this time it came with a lump in his throat. He wondered how a hero could be having such a hard time.
“I get that.” Draco sat on the sofa and pulled Harry down next to him. Harry snuggled up under Draco’s arms, amazed at how natural it felt. Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s head. “Well, now you can use all the sex magic you want.”
And he had Draco. Draco Malfoy, his former nemesis, an ex-Death-Eater, a boy he had nearly killed at sixteen, had brought a purpose into Harry’s life again. And somehow, that handsome wizard felt more like family than anyone else ever had. He laughed to himself as he found a deserted stretch of the park. Harry Potter was in love with Draco Malfoy.
Harry was certain Draco wouldn’t come back. He chastised his stupidity for the entire three minutes that Draco was gone. But when he heard a knock on the door, his heart leapt.
Harry just smiled, and Dudley and Meredith gave him a knowing glance. He shook his head. The game wrapped up shortly, and Harry gave Brian a big hug for playing so well. “Let’s go get ice cream,” Meredith said.
So Draco told her about therapy at Hogwarts, which she didn’t quite understand. He told her that he had become close with Andromeda. She seemed pleased, though she didn’t say much about it.
The train rolled to a stop at Hogsmeade station, returning a trainful of war veterans to their final year of school.
“He’s my godson!” Harry said. Draco looked at him, surprised to see him beaming with pride. This morning had already been the oddest morning of his life, and it wasn’t even nine o’clock.
“Mine and Harry’s fluxweed project is coming along nicely, and so is my Potions capstone. I can include those.”
Once naked, Draco rubbed his hard cock against Harry’s. He swallowed his boyfriend’s moan with a kiss. Harry bit and sucked Draco’s earlobes, neck, chest.
“I know. Snape told me.” He cleared his throat and wiped his eyes. “Harry, thank you for opening up to me in that statement. That can’t have been easy.”
Harry wondered how Draco had learned to cope, but he decided it was way too early in the morning for that serious conversation. He gave his lover a smile. “How about some coffee?”
“Asked Kreacher to keep an eye out and let me know. I knew you wouldn’t want to bother me, so I wanted to make sure you were okay.”
Draco rolled off of Harry onto the grass. They held hands and panted until their heart rates slowed.
“I want you to sit on my lap facing me. You’ll have more control over how fast or slow I go in.” And Draco really wanted Harry pressed against him. He wanted to be able to stare into his eyes and kiss him as much as he wanted.
This was just odd. Malfoy had never even feigned politeness before, and he had certainly never cared about Ron and Hermione. They were silent again, and Harry took the opportunity to really take in Malfoy for the first time. He had filled out, Harry noticed, no longer a scrawny git. The lines of his face had matured and sharpened; Harry’s eyes kept flicking back to that jawline. His eyes gave nothing away about what he was thinking, but Harry couldn’t help but notice they were the loveliest shade of silver. He wore navy shirt with no tie, and the first two buttons were undone, exposing his Adam’s apple and the slightest hint of a chiseled collarbone. There was no doubt about it. Draco Malfoy was attractive.
“No, I don’t.” Harry shook his head. “I sat in every day of your trial, you know. I saw the Veritaserum. I saw the memories you shared. Your father is a monster.”
Just then, Ron and Hermione showed up. “Going out for drinks tonight with everyone,” Ron told Harry and Draco. “Are you two coming?”
“Mm.” Draco leaned his head against Harry’s chest. “I want to do this, Harry, if you do. But there’s so much…what people will say, all the shit between us.”
“No.” Draco sat up. “Come on. We can’t hide in here forever. It would look terrible if the Saviour and his ex-Death Eater boyfriend don’t show up.”
“Chrissake, you’re a horny bastard.” Harry made a gesture. “I suppose you want to know about Seamus.”
Draco shrugged and flashed Harry a flirty smile. “That may be. But I’m your bastard. How long were you going to wait to tell me?”
Interesting. Draco inched closer to Harry. “You used to room with him. Tell me. How big is the real sword of Godric Gryffindor?”
“And I’m scared that I won’t be able to find an apprenticeship. I’m scared that my hearing will go badly in June, even though I have done everything right. What if they decide I need two years of house arrest like Mother? I don’t have a house. I can’t live with Steve for two years.”
Harry had no idea what to expect when he arrived at the Leaky Cauldron. He had spent a good thirty minutes showering and picking out an outfit, finally settling on a pair of dark, fitted jeans and a black button-down. What sort of drink was this? Malfoy had said he wanted to talk to Harry about something. Was this actually a date? Surely not. They hadn’t even spoken in years until today. Was it work related? He couldn’t imagine what Malfoy would need with an Auror, or why it would need to be Harry specifically.
Draco took the toothbrush out of his mouth, and toothpaste dribbled down his chin. Harry had the urge to lick it off. “I need to get the file from McGonagall. I can’t find it.”
Draco thought for a minute. Plenty of people didn’t come out until much later in life, even in the Wizarding World. He had heard people say that Muggles weren’t very accepting of homosexuality. “Well, you have had a lot going on the last seven years or so.”
“Funny. I still think the same thing about you. I’m not trying to be your friend. I’m trying to be a cordial roommate because I just want one goddamned year of my life to go smoothly! Voldemort is dead. I never have to see my aunt and uncle again. Snape isn’t here to torment me in Potions. Just one fucking year of some bloody peace!”
“Thanks, Steve.” Draco’s heart swelled. They said their goodbyes, and Draco trudged through the snow toward the castle, tears streaming down his face.
“I have your class rotas.” He began passing them out in alphabetical order. “You’ll notice more free time than you had previously. The NEWTS are demanding, so you will need that time for revision and projects. If you find yourself overwhelmed by your workload, my door is always open.” He glanced down at the sleeping baby. “Metaphorically. Please don’t wake the baby. Perhaps I should have included his nap times on your rotas, as well.”
“As hot as I find the prospect of thoroughly corrupting you, we should probably talk about boundaries and expectations and such.”
“I will.” The words were out of Draco’s mouth before he knew what he was doing. He shot a panicked look at Harry. Harry smiled at him.
Kingsley smiled a bit and jotted it down. He was the only one who knew Harry’s actual residence. “Very good. And employment?”
Harry uncovered his eyes and stared at Draco through glistening tears. “I’ve never told anyone. And I don’t plan to. And I’m not going to tell you details about it because, well, it feels wrong.”
Harry and Ron let Rose lead Daisy around Diagon Alley as they followed along smiling. They visited the Magical Menagerie and Eeylop’s so Harry could get some owl treats. Ron let Daisy buy whatever she wanted from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, and Daisy thought George Weasley was the funniest person she’d ever met. Daisy wanted to look at broomsticks, and Harry talked up Quidditch as much as he could. “I want to see a Quidditch game!” she cried.
Draco grasped Harry’s hand tightly as they rode the Ministry elevators down to the dungeons. Harry never liked this descent. Too many terrible memories had occurred in the lowest levels of the Ministry. He squeezed Draco’s hand back; he could talk about this later, after the good news. Right now, he was here for Draco. They exchanged a small, private smile.
Daisy had insisted on pizza for her party, and she and Rose chatted nonstop. Hermione and Meredith hit it off well, and Ron somehow managed to be cordial to Dudley. Harry could tell it was hard; he had seen Dudley and his parents years ago, and Ron was always protective of Harry. When all the kids went upstairs to Daisy’s room, and Meredith and Dudley cleaned up the meal, Harry was left alone with his two best friends in the living room.
Then, Dudley did the most unexpected thing Harry could have ever imagined. In fact, Harry would never have imagined it. Dudley stepped forward and wrapped Harry in an embrace. “It’s so good to see you.”
Harry sat up and leaned on his elbow to look at Draco. He had not expected that, although it was true that they had not spent a single night apart in two months. Draco wrung his hands and blushed. “We can work out logistics later. And it can be here or your place, I don’t care.”
Harry’s breath hitched as Draco stepped toward him. He smelled so good, and he was so close. Draco seemed to move slower and more carefully as he reached his hands toward the emerald tie. He unknotted it, and Harry was overwhelmed by desire. His cock became half-hard, and he was thankful Draco wasn’t looking down. Every inch of him wished Draco wouldn’t stop at unknotting the tie. He wanted Draco’s long, slender figures unbuttoning the shirt, reaching for his zipper. He was so close; Harry could easily tilt his head upward and kiss him.
His breathing quickened; he felt like was going to suffocate, though Draco’s bedroom was quite open and a pleasant temperature. He quietly recused himself from the room and made his way into the living room. He needed to calm himself down.
The Dursleys stood in their living room to watch as Daisy Apparated for her first time. “Take my hand, Daisy. It feels very funny, but you’re safe with me.” Daisy nodded bravely and grabbed Harry’s hand.
“Thanks for your time,” Harry said as the door to the shop opened, setting off a cacophony of screeching owls.
“The paperwork for starting a charity. It’s a bureaucratic nightmare.” He pushed the papers aside as Harry summoned plates and forks fromt he ktichen. He rummaged through the takeaway bag. “Did you get raita?”
Draco helped himself to a piece of toast. He knew that if Steve were here, he would insist on Draco eating something. And a bit of food did usually help the nausea. He nibbled on the wheat bread and studied Granger. Who would have thought the bookish Mudbl—Muggleborn, he corrected himself—would be a nympho? And who would have thought the Weasel would be packing such a nice cock? Too bad his face wasn’t attractive. Draco had never really been attracted to redheads. Dark hair, that’s what he liked. Dark hair and shorter than him, although Blaise had a good two inches on him. But that ship had sailed.
“No, he’s right, Ron. I’m obviously not fine. I can’t bloody sleep, and most of the time I’m so overwhelmed by all these memories that I can barely function. I haven’t finished a whole book since before…” Her voice trailed off.
“Only if there is an arrest that needs to be made or a situation of imminent danger. The Magical Law Enforcement Patrol is full of buffoons. I’d rather not set this up for failure from the beginning.”
Several people said hi to Harry as they made their way to breakfast. And several more people glared at Draco and muttered nasty things. No one threw a hex at him, though, so he decided that was a success.
“Okay, fine. You know me too well and blah blah blah. Right. Well, I want to invite him to the Halloween Ball.”
Draco raised his torso then stood suddenly. Harry groaned at the loss of contact. Draco stuck a hand inside his boxer-briefs and grabbed his throbbing member. “You need to see this?”
“Cool.” He tried to think of something else to say as they walked toward the back. “Uh…so you work here, too?”
Ron sat back in his armchair—another source of contention—and Hermione perched on the settee. Draco sat gingerly on the sofa next to Harry as if he were ready to flee at any moment. They stared at each other, and Harry refilled everyone’s drinks from the now-floating wine bottle. Draco took a sip and sighed.
Harry wrapped a towel around himself and opened the shower curtain. Draco was sitting on the floor directly in front of him. “Don’t tell anyone, please. I need time to…figure this out.”
Harry floated on cloud nine for the next several days. He resisted the urge to show up at the Potioneer’s shop over the weekend, thinking that might come on too strong.
He led Harry down an aisle to the nausea potions and gestured at the selection of hangover potions. “Here.”
“And now the Death Eater begs for mercy. How ironic.” He cast another hex, and Draco seized up in pain.
“Eighth years! Over here!” a warm and familiar voice called.  Harry couldn’t suppress a smile when he saw Remus Lupin standing in front of a small table off to the side of the Great Hall. It had been a close call, but Remus’ werewolf blood gave him the strength to survive his injuries. He did not know, however, that Remus was returning to Hogwarts.
“I don’t remember things being this complicated with girls! Is it because he’s a bloke? Am I turning into a girl?”
“Right. Hey, I know we haven’t spoken since your sentencing, but why the hell are you showing up everywhere all of a sudden? That will go well.”
“You’re a filthy little bastard, aren’t you?” Harry murmured. Draco grunted in agreement, taking Harry’s whole length down his throat. “Fuck. Oh, fuck, Draco.”
“And it was you showing up and forcing me to face my past that gave me the courage to finally, finally kiss you. I want you, Draco. I have for months.”
“Try spending the whole summer with her.” Ginny and Harry had ended their relationship amicably at the beginning of the summer. Too much had happened. Too much had changed. Sometimes Ginny was in a great mood, laughing like everything was fine. But then someone would say something, and she would flip. Molly thought it was because she wasn’t eating enough, and they’d start screaming at each other over Ginny not touching her meal. Then Molly would start crying, and Ginny would storm out, and George would start screaming, and...
They walked through the empty castle, looking for somewhere they could be alone. They found themselves outside, walking toward the Quidditch pitch.
“All right. Weasley, I mean Ron. I was a right prick to you from the moment we met. I was only spouting off shite I’d heard my father say, and he was a right bastard. I’m sorry for all the things I said to you, and I’m sorrier I ever believed any of it. You’re a good man; anyone who reads the papers can tell that.”
But when she looked into her son’s eyes, a smile spread across her mouth and spread past the dark bags under her eyes. “Draco.”
“If you’re so curious, ask him next time you see him,” Hermione told him, like it was the most obvious suggestion in the world.
“I’m taking you out to celebrate tonight, obviously. Honestly, Harry. Did you think you would quit your job and we’d just eat the same old takeout and watch the telly?” Harry rolled eyes.“Anyway, I’m taking you out. I have a wonderful celebration planned.”
“He slipped out after the ceremony. I imagine seeing so many people from the past at the reception seemed unbearable.” Hermione poured herself another glass of firewhiskey. “But it is odd that he has suddenly reappeared in public recently.”
“Right. And in regards to the anal area, what are you comfortable with?” Draco did not know how to make this sound more sexy.
Harry didn’t want to give a speech today. Harry didn’t want there to be an event at all today. But he was the Saviour of the Wizarding World, and he had no choice. He had even accepted a couple of interview requests—Hermione had told him it was important for people to hear from him. And one of the interviews was Luna for
It was more than a moment when Harry stepped through the Floo. He was laden with several containers of food. “Sorry,” he said. “Molly insisted on loading us up with enough food for a week.”
“Or you could just forget about it. It really isn’t any of your business, Harry. The war is over. We aren’t at Hogwarts. You don’t have to be obsessed with Malfoy’s every move now.”
Harry obliged. He moved his hips hard and deep, ramming himself inside of Draco’s warm, tight arse. He groaned at the tightness around his cock. He dug his hands into Draco’s hips and looked down the length of his stomach to watch his cock enter and exit his boyfriend. Moan after moan escaped their mouths, until Harry wasn’t sure who made what noise. “Harder, Harry.”
“Newt Scamander’s biography. He’s fascinating. I always read before bed. It helps calm my mind down enough to sleep.” He leaned down to kiss Harry, who melted under his touch. Sleep wasn’t far off, not when Draco felt this good.
“Apparate. And no, I want you to see Diagon Alley the same way I did the first time. Plus, Apparating can make your tummy hurt the first time. I wouldn’t want you to miss out on the ice cream.”
“About those scars you said we’d discuss.” Harry leaned his head against Draco’s shoulder as they sat near the Great Lake.
“Thanks. Uh, there’s this great Italian place a couple blocks away. Muggle. I thought it might be…less distracting than a Wizarding restaurant.”
“But there is so much history between us—unpleasant history—and I feel like we need to talk about it.”
Hermione shook her head. “I can’t wait for her to deliver that baby so they can be a happy couple again.”
“Bye, Magic Lady!” Daisy waved. She was a cute little girl, with blonde pigtails and a spattering of freckles across her nose. She gripped her father’s hand, and Dudley smiled down with pride at his daughter. His witch daughter. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose.
Draco didn’t need to be told twice. He stripped off his button-down and threw it on the floor. He unzipped his trousers and removed them with his pants in one motion before jumping onto the bed with Harry.
want to be with Draco for the rest of his life, but he didn’t want to propose to him in the hallway right after Draco’s father was murdered.
“So, you’ve never seen a niffler? We have to go the Magical Menagerie! Can we, Daddy?” Rose gave Ron her best puppy-dog eyes.
“Of course. You look well. Are you enjoying the Aurors?” Malfoy had a polite expression on his face, but the forced small talk felt wrong.
First they were roommates. Then they were in the same therapy session. Now they had to work on the same project together. And they had an almost identical schedule, except Draco also had Ancient Runes and Arithmancy.
Malfoy sighed and calculated his total. “I only work here on weekend days. Ten Galleons, two sickles, and twenty knuts.”
He slathered his fingers in lube while he swirled his tongue around the head of Harry’s cock. Then he breached Harry with two wet fingers. Harry gasped in pleasure. Draco used his other hand to reach up and play with Harry’s hard nipples. He moved his head up and down over Harry’s shaft while using his left hand to stretch him.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck as he fully sheathed Draco’s cock inside of himself. Draco groaned, and Harry’s mouth trapped him in a kiss. Harry began to move slowly, letting out little gasps whenever Draco’s cock grazed his prostate.
“If you’re going to get involved with him, you need to address the hippogriff in the room. You do remember that your hatred for each other almost resulted in both your deaths, right?”
He shook his head. “It just… Ron had just lost his brother. Hermione was days past being tortured, and she had to go find her parents in Australia. They think the curse just killed the Horcrux.”
Ever a Gryffindor, Harry grabbed Draco’s collar and pulled him into a kiss. His lips crashed onto Draco’s, soft and inviting. It didn’t take more than half a second before Draco returned the kiss fervently. He parted his lip, letting Harry’s tongue slide inside. Harry pulled Draco onto his lap, never breaking contact with the blond man’s soft, sensual lips. He sucked and nibbled and felt Draco whimper into his mouth.
He rolled his hips, and the friction of his cock against Harry’s was electrifying. Slowly, he worked his nibbles down to Harry’s collarbone, his chest, his nipples. Merlin, how had Harry never known his nipples were such an erogenous zone? When Draco finally reached Harry’s lower region, Harry placed his arms behind his head and looked down the length of his body. Draco smirked and licked his lip. He twirled his fingers in the soft mound of hair at the base of Harry’s penis. He lowered his mouth and planted soft kisses on Harry’s inner thighs. Slytherin fucking tease, Harry thought.
Harry thought for a moment. The dream was starting to slip away. He’d never thought to just confront it. “It’s been ten years. I shouldn’t...”
And then Harry Potter jumped out of his seat. “That’s it?!” His voice was loud, shrill, full of anger.
He sighed. He never liked to return to Surrey, although he had managed to avoid Little Whinging altogether. He decided he needed a stiff drink and a good lay after this week’s barrage of the past. He promised himself he would hit the Muggle bars tomorrow then headed to the Auror’s Apparition point.
Harry downed more of his drink. His heart had started racing, and he very much did not want to have this conversation.
Harry squeezed his hand, reassuring him. There was no reason for Draco to have any further conditions of his probation. He would blow his NEWTs out of the water, and he would be gainfully employed. There was just one thing missing.
Harry kicked off his shoes and pulled his jumper over his head. “Free! Like Dobby given a sock, free!”
Harry nodded in agreement, but he tuned out as Malfoy continued. At first, he had simply been impressed by Malfoy’s dedication to this project and how much research he had done. And it was a cause Harry could get behind easily. It was personal, after all. But over the last week, he had discovered he genuinely liked Malfoy. Sure, he could be a right arse at times, but his snide comments were never truly malevolent. He was funny and smart, and he had the added benefit of being nice to look at. Shit, Harry realized. I have a crush on Draco Malfoy.
Harry and Dennis asked the same questions they’d asked everyone else and got the same descriptions of the gang of teens.
“Yep. My dad, Sirius, Remus, and Peter Pettigrew. They called themselves the Marauders. Honestly, I figure Remus was most of the brains behind this. He was nearly a Ravenclaw, you know.”
“Honestly, mate. Aren’t you a little old to be stalking Malfoy?” Ron asked over dinner at Grimmauld Place on Saturday night. Rose and Hugo were at Molly’s with the other Weasley grandkids. Molly insisted on watching all of the kids Saturday nights and sending them home with their parents after Sunday supper. Every Sunday, she reminded Harry that the offer stood for any future children he had and then asked about Harry’s dating life.
Steve folded him into a bear hug, and Draco eagerly returned it. He had missed his guardian-turned-friend. When they parted, Steve greeted Andromeda.
“I said it shoud have been you that got killed in the battle. Not my mum. She was an Auror. It should have been you.”
Harry laughed, a deep chortle that warmed Draco to his core. It sounded like home. “It was so good that I couldn’t think.” He yawned.
Andromeda stepped back and put her hands on Draco’s shoulders. She patted his face, just like his mother. “I am so glad to meet you, nephew of mine.”
A wide grin lit up Harry’s face. Draco’s heart swelled. Though it had only been a few months, Draco could hardly remember why he ever hated Harry. This wizard truly was incredible, and it had nothing to do with being the Chosen One. He was a survivor, just like Draco. And yet, he still had so much love to give.
He switched back to fucking Harry’s face. Harry grabbed him around the thighs and pulled him deeper. Draco couldn’t hold back. With a shout, his filled Harry’s throat with his orgasm. Harry sputtered a bit, but he swallowed.
Harry answered by tugging harder on Draco’s hair, making his neck easier to access. He sucked on Draco’s neck as he slipped a hand inside of the wizard’s waistband. Draco’s arse was smooth and firm, and he couldn’t wait to be inside of it. Draco tugged on Harry’s jumper and pulled it over his head, flinging on the ground. He pulled his neck from Harry’s mouth then peppered kisses and nibbles all over his chest. He flicked his tongue over one of Harry’s nipples then took the other in his mouth and teased it with his teeth. Harry bucked against Draco, wanting more.
Malfoy’s impassioned smile faded. “Because my life would have been a lot different if someone had stopped my father from abusing me.”
“Gladly.” Harry turned Draco around and pushed him down on the bed. “Get on your knees.” Draco obeyed, exposing his tight entrance to Harry. Harry climbed on the bed behind him. He peppered licks and kisses down Draco’s back. He placed a gentle bite on Draco’s arse cheek.
Harry shook his head. “If it’s stuck under something, I don’t want it to break. That’s some expensive stuff that Kingsley gave me.” He stretched. “And I’m just too comfortable to get up. You’re still standing.”
“We haven’t spoken in ten years. We haven’t so much as seen each other until a month ago, when you bought me a coffee and said nothing. What was up with that, by the way? We aren’t friends. We’ve never been friends. We were the bloody opposite of friends. And you think you can just ask me shit like this over a pint? Fuck you, Malfoy.”
Daisy’s birthday was coming up soon, and Harry wanted to take her to her first Quidditch game. He stopped by the Department of Magical Games to buy tickets to an upcoming Holyhead Harpies versus Falmouth Falcons game. He thought Daisy would enjoy seeing an all-women team play against a mixed gender team. After all, football wasn’t like that. And Draco’s favorite team was the Falmouth Falcons. On a whim, Harry bought three tickets. Even he wasn’t sure what he was he was doing.
Draco cleared his throat. “Nothing. It’s just Molly Weasley invited me and you over for Christmas. But I figured you had plans, so…”
On a Friday, about a month after Malfoy had bought Harry a coffee without so much as a hello, Harry finally came face to face with his old enemy. There was no epic showdown. Their meeting was far from poetic. It occurred at the urinals in the Ministry toilets.
Wednesday was a long day at work. He really needed to spend an extra hour or two finishing up a report, but as soon as five-thirty struck, Harry rushed to the Floos. He impatiently tapped his foot as the long queue of Ministry witches and wizards inched forward. He envied all the departments that could leave on time.
“Please refrain from giving any normally forbidden substances to the younger students.” Remus looked directly at Justin Finch-Fletchley, who was known for both his high-quality weed and his ability to smuggle in booze. “And as this is not a typical house and you are all adults, I expect you to treat each other with respect.”
“Oh. Just going to stay here with Harry, and whoever else is left at Hogwarts.” Draco’s eyes darted around. He had lied when he told Weasley he would ask. He didn’t want Steve to feel obligated. “What about you?”
The two lovers lay panting and sweating on their backs, legs intertwined. They had ten minutes to get to the pub for the celebration but they needed to catch their breath. “Harry?”
Hermione, as sober as if she’d just drank three pints of sparkling water, shrugged. “Every so often, the Prophet runs a theory about him on a slow news week. But no one knows.”
He looked up. Harry had an almost-smile on his face. He returned Draco’s earlier thumbs-up. But it was Hermione who surprised Draco the most. She crossed the circle and leaned down to give him a hug.
Draco took the same seat at the eighth year table that he had last night, on the corner closest to the staff table. Granger was seated across from him, her nose already in a book. Potter went to sit on her other side, but she gave him a look that Draco couldn’t interpret. He moved to sit next to Draco. Ah, she must have been telling him to save the seat for the Weasel. Of course.
Harry blinked. He had not expected this to be so easy, but it was Kingsley Shacklebolt. He wasn’t the type of man to force anything on anyone. It’s why he was such a successful Minister. “Thank you, sir. Um, the Prophet article goes up next week. I’d like to wait until then to announce it. And I can finish out my duties here for...”
“Judging by his current marks, I don’t think that will be a problem,” the other Wizengamot member said. Draco didn’t know his name.
Harry bolted upright in bed. He was drenched in sweat and tears. He panted hard. Draco placed a hand on his back, and Harry jumped. “Sorry sorry sorry,” Draco murmured. “I’m sorry. Harry, are you all right?”
But he couldn’t. So, when Remus asked him what he wanted to do with his life, he blew up. “I don’t know! I never expected to live long enough to pick a career! I don’t fucking know!”
from Remus, books from Hermione, and candy from Ron. Andromeda had bought him a placeholder. Luna had sketched a drawing of him and Harry sitting by the fire in the common room. But there were three gifts that threatened to put Draco in tears.
“I’m proud of you, Harry.” Draco’s voice was little more than a murmur. His eyes were heavy with sleep.
Harry withdrew his wand and showed Daisy how he cast his Patronus. He sent it to Ron to let him know they would wait at Fortescue’s before leading Daisy inside. Daisy sampled every flavor before deciding on the butterbeer flavor, just like her Uncle Harry. They sat at a table, and he saw Daisy looking at the memorial of Florian Fortescue against the back wall. “He died?”
Draco’s stomach lurched as he and the Auror appointed to his case landed in front of Hogwarts’ gates. This Auror, Steve, had all the grace of a drunk hippogriff when he Apparated. But Draco could only Side-Along Apparate for at least the next year. It was one of many conditions of staying out of Azkaban.
The Ravenclaw fell face-first to the ground with a loud thud. Draco heard something crunch, likely a nose. Harry knelt on the ground next to Draco. “Hey, are you all right?”
Draco agreed with a sad look in his eyes; he knew better than most people just how cruel Voldemort had been. “Very mean. Your Uncle Harry is sometimes called the Boy Who Lived.”
Draco didn’t understand, but he thanked her. She promised to send a house-elf with his potion later.
Whenever Harry woke from a nightmare, he transferred his thoughts to Draco. Something about him had always obsessed Harry. But now instead of mindfulness to calm his brain, Harry thought of Draco’s appearance and his voice. More than once, Harry had a nice, long wank to the image of Draco. Then he would feel ashamed and dig out his porn magazines from his nightstand. “It’s just because we’re spending so much time together, and I haven’t gotten laid in weeks,” he told the dark bedroom one night. There was no answer.
When a witch opened up a curry restaurant on Diagon Alley, Harry couldn’t be happier. They were also offering delivery, so after a long day of grueling paperwork as a Junior Auror, he could have a steaming bowl of saag paneer delivered directly to his flat’s door.
Harry took a few more drops of Dreamless Sleep that night, knowing that he couldn't continue for long. But Draco had asked him to stay again, and he wanted to, more than anything. Draco read while Harry watched him. Draco’s lips would turn up a little at the corners when he read something amusing. His brow would furrow in serious parts. And occasionally he’d say, “Listen to this,” and tell Harry some new fact with excitement. He was such a swot, and Harry wondered if he had been this way in school. If only he and Hermione had gotten on...Hermione!
Hermione cocked her head and waved her wand to close the office door. She cast a quick Muffliato for good measure. “What the fuck? Tell me everything.”
“Um, sure.” He attempted to flatten his hair and dusted his dinner crumbs off his jumper. A moment later, Draco stood in his living room. He crossed the room and pulled Harry into an unexpected embrace. Harry stiffened, shocked at the random display of affection. But Draco felt nice, and Harry had wanted to hold him in his arms for so long. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist.
Everyone nodded, and a few people thanked Harry for trusting them. Draco gave Harry a thumbs up from across the circle.
Draco sucked and licked while his right hand moved at the base of Harry’s erection. It was sensory overload, and Harry felt his knees weaken. Then, Draco added his left hand to the mix, fondling Harry’s swollen balls. Harry wound his hands in Draco’s hair to steady himself. As he did, Draco removed his right hand from Harry’s shaft and took him deeper into his mouth. Harry smirked, knowing exactly what Draco wanted. He used his hands to force Draco’s mouth back and forth over his cock, fucking his face faster and faster. Draco moaned, and the vibrations of it nearly sent Harry over the edge.
Things turned strange after lunch. Ginny, who had been shooting daggers at him all day, came up to him with tears in her eyes and threw her arms around him. Draco awkwardly hugged her back, his eyes wide as he looked at Harry. Harry smiled and gave him a thumbs-up. He must have told Ginny what Draco had said about her the other day.
“I know, mate. But you can’t just ignore the past. It has a way of affecting you even if you don’t confront it.” He gave Harry a pointed look that clearly said, since you refuse to deal with it.
Harry listened as Malfoy explained his plan. His law would make child abuse illegal and punishable as a crime. He had plans to set up a foster care system. He had thought up the ways to report abuse and had researched how to identify abuse. He met with McGonagall about her experiences with abused children, and she was on board to help. He was working on a charity to help fund it and produce literature about child abuse. He had already thought of a training program for what he called social workers. Harry was amazed, and he was moved by the passion with which Malfoy spoke.
Harry looked down at his attire. His jumper was fairly new, and his khakis didn’t have a stain on it. And his Converse were clean, too. “What’s wrong with what I’m wearing? This is what I wear to the Ministry every day.”
Harry groaned as a loud tapping noise roused him from his sleep. He was convinced the noise was coming from inside his aching head, but as he came to his senses, he realized an insistent owl was at his window. “Okay, okay, I’m coming,” he moaned as he pulled himself upright. Owl first, then hangover potion.
“First, your common room fireplaces are connected to the Floo Networks only for communication. If you would like to fire-call home at any time, you will be able to. If you need privacy, please arrange a private fire-call with your head of house in their chambers. Second, we know how hard it is to be away from home at this time. If you need to spend a weekend with your parents or pop home for dinner, please arrange this with your head of house. All heads of houses Floo Networks are completely open, as is mine.”
died. Did you learn nothing in the war? Life is too short for what-ifs. Put on your Gryffindor pants, and ask. him. out.”
His orgasm flowed from him in sweet release, and Draco’s hot liquid spurted over Harry’s hand at the same time. “Fuck,” Harry shouted as his orgasm rippled through his body. Nobody had ever made Harry come the way Draco could. He thought briefly how much amazing sex he had missed out on by hating Draco for so long.
When his sobs quieted, Artemis asked him if he would like to share. Neville wiped his face and nodded.
Cheers broke out from the visitors’ stand, and Draco and Harry leapt up with joy. Draco planted a huge kiss on Harry’s lips. If the wizarding world did not know about their relationship before, they certainly did now. Harry saw a camera flash in his periphery. Hermione hugged Harry and Draco in turn, and Ron embraced his best friend. Then he grinned at Draco and pulled the blond into a bear hug.
The precocious child read the card. “It says he is your best friend was croo-shal to your defeat of Vol-Volde...”
In the ten years since the war had ended, Harry had become quite skilled at avoiding the darkest parts of his past. Sure, there was the annual celebration in May that required a speech, a few interviews, and an awkward photo shoot. But even then, he tried to keep his focus on the present and the future: look how far the Wizarding world had come, and look how far they still had to go.
“And guys?” Harry didn’t say anything. “Potter, turn the bloody shower off so I don’t have to scream to talk to you.”
The next day, Draco was walking back to the dorms from the Great Hall after lunch. Only one person had spat at him today, so it was a good day. Most of the eighth years had gone into the village. He assumed Harry was with them because he had been gone by the time Draco made it back from tending to the fluxweed that morning.  He was almost to Sir Cadogan’s painting when he froze. Bellatrix LeStrange was walking straight toward him. “No.”
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake. Come with me.” He gestured for Harry to follow him then turned back toward the corridor. “Lucky for you, I’ve got several suits, and I think I know one that will look good with your hair and eyes.”
That was how their meal continued. Long pauses between tentative conversation. Harry watched as Draco took the last bite of biryani. He couldn’t take his eyes off Draco’s mouth.
Harry pulled Draco toward him and poured his gratitude into a kiss right there on the street. When Draco stepped away, he looked well and truly dazed. “Right then. Shall we?” He held out his arm to Harry and together they entered the restaurant, their first-time dining as a couple. The maitre-d' greeted Draco as Mr. Malfoy, and Draco introduced Harry as his boyfriend. Harry couldn’t stifle the grin that spread over his face. He had acquired many titles in his twenty-eight years—The Boy Who Lived, The Chosen One, The Savior of the Wizarding World, Auror, One-third of the Golden Trio. But he thought that Draco Malfoy’s boyfriend might be his favorite title yet. Merlin, he had it bad.
Draco pulled back the shower curtain and flashed that devilish smirk at Harry. “What do you take me for, Potter? Some kind of slut?” He climbed in, and Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s fit waist.
Harry looked up. Neville was staring at him, concerned. Harry forced a smile. Neville reached into the pockets of his robes and pulled out a flask. “Need a kip?”
Mission accomplished. Harry was so aroused that his nerves were gone. He glanced down. “Take off your goddamn underwear, Harry.”
Draco reached his hand to Harry’s lap, finding it less hard than it had been just moments before. “Well, let’s see if we can’t get you back in the mood.”
He met Dudley and his family at a park instead of going to their house for dinner, as Brian had a footie game. He didn’t say much and cheered when he was supposed to. “Uncle Harry?” Daisy asked.
“Now, I would like to address some major changes that will be occurring with your schedules this year,” McGonagall continued. “In the last few years, we have all witnessed terrible events. Events that haunt us, day in and day out. Most of you are grieving losses of loved ones. Some of you fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. And for those of you that were here last year under the tyrant regime of the Carrows, you experienced unspeakable horrors. We will get through these together.
He threw open the cupboards looking for his stemware, only to find them cloudy with water spots. “Let me just clean these.”
Inside, Harry’s nervous energy manifested in being an overly attentive host. “Do you want something to drink? I’ve got wine. Beer. Water. Milk. Tea?”
“That’s not true. You saw him at Pansy and Lavender’s wedding a couple years ago,” Hermione chimed in.
“Your home is lovely,” Draco said stiffly. Oh, these two would be the death of him with this formal awkwardness.
“Ah.” He shook his head and threw his shower caddy and dirty clothes on the floor next to his bed. Harry, who had the bed closest to the door, put his own shower belongings on the shelf where he kept them and folded his pajamas to place at the end of his bed. Malfoy was so uptight, he had figured him for a neat freak. Apparently, he was more like Ron.
Harry gave a generic response, and soon Luna was talking about some new species of Nargle that had been discovered in Thailand.
“Yes, he killed the ice cream man and lots of other people. When your Uncle Harry was a baby, this bad wizard, Voldemort, tried to get rid of Harry. Harry lost his parents that night, but he was the only person who had ever survived Voldemort. He was so bad that people were afraid to say his name. They called him You-Know-Who or He-Who-Must-Not-Be Named.”
By Wednesday evening, he still had not heard from Draco. He had sent several owls, finally just inquiring about their work. If he wouldn’t talk about the kiss, then at least he would talk about the project he had so fully dedicated himself to. And as badly as Harry wanted Draco, he’d rather just stay business partners than not have him in his life at all.
He picked up an excited Daisy from Surrey. She was more excited about going to the Quidditch game than she was about her birthday party the next day. And she was thrilled to finally Apparate, although her parents were less sure. “You’re sure it’s safe?” Meredith asked for the hundredth time.
Harry smiled. He fumbled in his nightstand for his glasses and a piece of paper. “Thanks. I’ll keep you away from gin in the future. I’m free this evening if you want to...” Harry paused. What exactly was he inviting Draco to do? He shook his throbbing head and scribbled “work on our statement to the Daily Prophet.” He sent the owl off with the note and stumbled into the toilet to find a hangover potion and a bath.
Harry pushed just the head of his cock in. They both groaned. Harry was biting his lip, hard, to keep himself from pushing too soon. “It’s so tight.”
Ron pulled himself out of bed, completely starkers. Malfoy’s eyes widened. Ron dug through his dresser for his uniform and dressing gown. He scratched his bum, loosely tied the robe around his waist, and headed for the shower.
It was too much. Draco still wasn’t sure he deserved Harry’s love, but he didn’t want to figure that out right now. He shoved the cards out of his way and crawled across the floor to Harry. He pushed Harry down to the floor by his shoulders and climbed on top him, snogging him senseless.
His thoughts wandered back to Draco. Was Draco seeing anyone? Did he deliver food full time? Where did he live now that he didn’t have the Manor?
Harry met Draco’s grey eyes, the ones that used to sneer at him now held only kindness and warmth. Running a charity with Draco. Dating Draco. Life had taken a whole new turn. He had only intended to lend his name and support to this project, but now Draco offered him a new direction in life. “Yes.”
Back in the room, Harry was pacing. He forced himself to breathe in the rhythm that Artemis had taught them. When he finally caught his breath, he sat down on his bed and drew the curtains. He needed to experiment. He stuck a hand out of the bed curtains and grabbed his wand and a copy of
She smiled and hugged Harry goodbye. She and Draco gave each other an odd look before she pulled him into a friendly embrace. Harry grinned. He couldn’t have hoped for any better outcome.
“I've seen Kingsley Shacklebolt drunkenly karaoke Celestina Warbeck, and Dawlish has a pet cat that he baby-talks to. Forgive me if I'm not intimidated.”
Draco’s first finger breached Harry’s opening. Harry gasped, and Draco waited a minute for him to adjust before moving further in. Harry, ever the screamer, began swearing and groaning. Draco felt around for the special spot.
“So full,” Draco murmured. Harry smiled down at him. Draco raised a leg and put it over Harry’s shoulder. “Fuck me now.”
Straddling Harry’s hips, it wasn’t long before Draco could feel something hard pressing into him. He rubbed his own erection against Harry’s, savoring the little mewl that came out of his boyfriend’s mouth.
Draco’s response was just a whisper. “I’ll listen. Anytime you want to confront the past, I’ll listen.”
Ron’s jaw was slack as he stared at Draco. Harry smiled into his wine glass, determined not to ruin the moment. Ron cleared his throat. “I, uh, I forgive you. And I’m sorry for anything I ever said to you that was uncalled for.”
She smiled at Draco and moved to the next person, which was Padma. On Harry’s turn, he sounded just as excited as Draco when he said, “Harry Potter, Gryffindor, treacle tart.”
“Draco, shove it. All right, listen up. Draco and I have talked through our past. And we’re all going to do the same thing. Draco’s in my life now, just like you two. So, Hermione, cut the Jean Granger act. Ron, stop being a cunt. Draco, try not to be such a posh arse.”
“Um. Thanks. You, too.” Harry cleared his throat. He was glad Dudley was alive, glad Voldemort had never found the Dursleys, terrible though they had been to him. “Why?”
“Yeah, it was great. But, I don’t know if I’m ready for, you know, all of it yet.” He looked embarrassed. Draco planted a kiss on his lips.
“I’m sorry. I’ll try not to yell around you anymore.” Harry ran a hand through his hair. “Want to skive off Defense?”
Malfoy smirked. “I’m not sure how Investigation will feel about taking on more work that isn’t dark magic. But I suppose it doesn’t really matter how they feel. We’ll be training new staff anyway.”
Harry cleared his throat unconsciously as he thought this. Draco looked up and met his eyes. He gave Harry a distinctly Malfoy smirk. Did he know Harry had been admiring him? “So, Malfoy. Why am I here?”
“Oh, fuck no!” Harry’s voice boomed behind Draco. “Nope. Rita, you know you’re supposed to stay away from my people. That includes him. Consider this your only warning.”
Someone called to Harry from the end of a long tunnel. At least, he thought that was what was happening. He didn’t see a tunnel. He didn’t really see anything. Maybe he imagined the voice.
“Oh.” That was as vague an answer as Harry could have gotten. He was no more enlightened than he had been before he took a piss. “Well, see you around, I guess.”
“I’m sorry. I have to ask.” Draco glanced at him then down at his plate. “Is this a date? Or are we just hanging out?”
“Bellatrix? She’s dead, Draco. She’s no—oh.” He looked up at someone standing behind Draco. “Yeah, I forget sometimes. Draco, Bellatrix is dead. Molly Weasley killed her. You saw her sister, Andromeda.”
“How’s your mother?” Remus asked softly. There was something strange in his voice that Draco didn’t understand. Perhaps he was just unsure how to talk about Draco’s imprisoned mother.
Harry and Ron made their way to the last door in the hallway, next to their fellow Gryffindors. Ron went in and called for Winky.
She nodded again. “Well, hurry along to the Great Hall. The other students will be arriving soon.” She turned to walk away then paused. “Oh, and Draco. Welcome home.”
“I don’t know. I had been trying to muster the courage for weeks. And we did need to address everything between us first. But I’m not brave...”
“Oh, bloody hell. Of course it’s you.” He held out the plastic bag of food. “Here you go. Two Galleons and eighteen knuts.”
“Oh. Nice.” He handed over the coins. He noticed Draco’s skin was soft as their hands brushed. “Well, thanks, mate.”
Harry gave Hermione a small smile. “I know we’re all having a tough time. I shouldn’t have snapped at you, though.”
She thought for a few minutes and watched her brother’s game. “Uncle Harry? Do you think Draco has ever been to a footie game?”
“I’m in. Whatever you need, interviews, endorsement, money—although I’m sure you’re richer than me—whatever. I don’t know what getting a law passed entails. But I’m in.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Fine. But only because you’re cute.” He made his way into the common room and looked everywhere for the wine, turning over cushions and looking under tables. The wine was nowhere to be seen.
It was just after one o’clock in the afternoon when they entered Eeylops Owl Emporium. The owner, Dave, confirmed what the other shop owners had said: a group of edgy teens had been loitering outside every evening for the last week.
They finished in the bathroom at the same time and walked in heavy silence down the hallway to their dorm. When Harry opened the door, he saw Hermione buttoning her top and Ron splayed out on his bed, thankfully under the covers.
Harry processed this. Draco stared at the floor. “When exactly were you going to invite me out to a romantic dinner?”
The trio turned to see Dudley standing in the doorway. Meredith smacked her husband on the back of the head.
Draco’s face was unreadable, and though only a few moments of silence passed, Harry felt like it was an eternity. Finally, Draco spoked. Breathlessly, he whispered, “Well, we aren’t crying now.”
The ceremony went as well as one could expect. It was mournful and heavy. Harry’s speech went well. He talked about hope and finding lights in the darkness. He used Artemis’ words that she repeated often: “It’s okay to not be okay.”  Candles were lit for every lost loved one. When Harry was pulled away for photo ops and interviews, Draco visited with Steve. That is, until Rita Skeeter, sidled up to him, her Quick-Notes Quill at the ready.
Draco’s cock twitched. Inappropriate, he muttered. But it was just a fantasy. No harm in that. Draco was never one to judge his own fantasies. “Fuck it,” he said. He stood and stripped off his clothes and stepped into the shower.
Hermione had tears in her eyes. She nodded. “Thank you, Draco. That means a lot. I forgive you and hope we can start over. And I’m sorry for punching you all those years ago.”
They stopped in front of the doors to the Hospital Wing. Harry grinned at Draco. “Let’s get you that note.”
“Mother.” Draco’s voice hitched, and he crossed the small room in one stride. He wrapped his arms around her and buried his face in her shoulders. And he cried.
It was Draco’s white-faced owl. Last night suddenly came flooding back to Harry, and he groaned again. At least Draco was alive this morning. He untied the letter from the owl’s leg and opened it. He blinked, trying to read it.
He turned toward home and decided he would walk. He was too angry to Apparate without splinching himself, and he’d be damned if he would go back inside to use the Floo. Fuck Malfoy. Years of images flooded his mind, and he could barely breathe. Malfoy taunting him. Malfoy smashing his nose. Malfoy trying to kill Dumbledore.
“Oh, I took over the Malfoy investments. Well, the ones that stuck around after the...after everything. I’ve gathered up some new ones, as well. Lots of meetings with stuffy businessmen, you know. Nothing exciting.”
Draco collapsed on the ground next to Harry, panting like he’d just run a marathon. But Harry was too turned on to let him rest. He planted his lips on Draco’s, letting Draco taste himself. “That was so hot. I need to be inside of you.”
Harry checked his breath and ran a hand over his hair before rushing off to the library. Hermione’s pep talk had helped, but he was still nervous. He wished he had some Felix Felicis right about now.
Harry nodded, unsure what else to do. He followed the two, and Daisy chatted happily about meeting the Magic People and about the scary clown and about her pink shoes and some television show she liked. Dudley responded to her comments with “oh wow” and “that’s great, honey.” The fact that Dudley was such a doting father might have been the strangest part of the whole day. Maybe.
“Harry?” Draco’s voice sounded concerned. What was he doing here? Go away, Harry thought. “Harry?” He knocked on the wall outside the shower. “Are you okay?”
Draco opened his mouth, and Harry took the opportunity to deepen the kiss. When Draco’s tongue slipped inside Harry’s mouth, Harry let out a small groan. He felt a warm breath of air against his nose as Draco tried not to chuckle.
Harry responded by casting the cleaning charm wandlessly and summoning lube from his nightstand. Draco rolled his eyes at the cheap liquid, but it would be fine for now. He slathered Harry’s cock with it then positioned himself to slide down on top of Harry.
Harry looked at Draco, who grinned. He could finally join his friends for drinks. “Yeah, but let us pop home and drop our stuff off first,” Harry said. He winked.
Loving Draco was an experiment in unlearning everything Harry thought he knew and rebuilding his world brick by brick. The boy who had spent his Hogwarts years sneering and belittling everyone he viewed as lesser had turned into a man who couldn’t do enough for the people he cared about. Harry suspected that if he were lucky enough to be with Draco the rest of his life, Draco would still surprise him.
Harry sighed and buried his head in his hands. “Why do discussions about my love life always end up with a huge audience?”
Harry took a deep breath, trying to find his Gryffindor spirit he was famous for. “Do..do you want to come up? I mean, no pressure, but…”
He wasn’t sure the conditions of Draco’s release. He knew Narcissa Malfoy had only received one year in Azkaban and two years on house arrest. He didn’t know where Draco had gone after he was released from prison. He wanted to, but he couldn’t just start prying into his arch-rival’s life.
Harry had already closed his eyes at Draco’s touch. Draco peppered kisses and nibbles down Harry’s chest, teasing his nipples with teeth and tongue. Harry’s back arched, and Draco took note every time he touched a new spot that made Harry writhe.
Harry’s already hard cock twitched at the demand. He glanced at the clock; they still had time. He lubed himself up with Draco’s spell then pressed the thick head of his hardness against Draco’s hole. With one, long swift movement, he entered him. Draco grunted, and Harry realized he had not stretched his lover at all in the heat of the moment. “All right, love?”
“Okay, Draco, I’m cutting you off.” They were starting to get looks from the other patrons. Harry gestured to the waitress to close out the tab. He walked a crying Draco through signing his name then led him outside. They were both too drunk to Apparate, and they were nowhere near a Floo. He could hail the Knight Bus, but a drunk Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy would feature in the next day’s Daily Prophet if he did. He had no Muggle money on him. “Draco, give me your wallet.”
The anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts fell on a bright, warm Sunday. It felt wrong. No one spoke much in the dormitory that morning. Everyone's memories were suffocating. Draco had only left the bed to throw up. But now he was back in bed holding Harry, who had no intention of going down to breakfast.
When the last of the Muggles had been sent on their way, Harry went out to let Susan know that he was finished. She wasn’t around anymore, but he caught sight of her boss sitting on a bench, talking to a large Muggle man and a sniffling little girl. That must be the one the who had shrunk the clown.
The Monday of the last week before Christmas break, Draco was quite sure he had awoken in an alternate universe. The owl post arrived dropping letters off all over the Great Hall. Remus handed Draco a letter that had been screened. It was from Steve.
“It’s all right. I don’t remember the particulars, but I’m sure I deserved it.” He lay his blond head on Harry’s shoulder. “Well, we’ve got all day. Want to lay around and do nothing?”
Padma cringed. “Yes. There are some things you should never know about your twin, and what they sound like during sex is definitely one of them.”
Dudley pulled Harry back as they walked to the parking lot. “You don’t have to go get ice cream. You should go find that Draco bloke. We’ll see you next week, all right?”
Harry still had no plan for after school. With Draco’s and Bill Weasley’s guidance, he made some smart investments with a portion of his fortune. And he still studied for his NEWTs in case he ever decided to go to the Auror Academy—and because Hermione and Draco insisted he study, but he no longer felt like everything hinged on these tests.
“Cool.” Draco looked at Harry. “Well, this has been fun. And enlightening. But I’d really like to continue snogging you.”
There would be time later for slow, romantic sex, Draco decided. He murmured in Harry’s ear. “I want you inside of me. Now.”
A bell above the door tinkled when he entered. He stared at the long aisles of shelves, unsure where to find what he needed. There were thousands of potions here.
Harry looked at his best friend’s face. The bags under her eyes that had been there for months seemed to be getting darker. “I’m okay, Hermione. It’s just weird to be going back.”
And Draco loved surprising him. When Harry woke from his nap hours later, he found Draco digging through his closet, looking for something specific and throwing anything that was not his goal on the floor. He muttered something about finding the right one when Harry inquired. Harry shook his head and waved his wand, his wordless cleaning spells straightening Draco’s mess.
Harry took Draco’s hand and guided him toward the leather sofa. He pushed Draco down on the sofa and admired the tented shorts in Draco’s lap. Harry was ready to take control now. “Touch yourself.”
The Weird Sisters performed, and Draco dragged Harry onto the dance floor. Harry licked his lips more than once at the sight of Draco dancing. Around eleven, Ron yelled in Harry’s ear that a bunch of them were going into Hogsmeade.
“Oh, I’ve noticed.” Huh?  “A few quick spells, and it will fit you perfectly. Trust me, Blaise and I used to share clothes all the time at Hogwarts, and we’re built nothing alike.”
Harry wandlessly summoned Ron’s toothbrush and toothpaste. His best friend re-entered the room a moment later. “I forgot my—”
“Your reputation is intact, then,” Harry spat. He rubbed his eye absentmindedly, and pain shot through his head. “Ow.”
“Who would kill an ice cream man?” Daisy asked in a voice that clearly said killing ice cream men was unthinkable. Harry gave her a sad smile.
Harry swallowed. It had been a long time since he stayed overnight, usually slipping out after a shag. And he certainly had not shared a bed with anyone since his nightmares had returned. But Draco was warm, and he wanted nothing more than to wake up beside him in the morning. Brave, he reminded himself. “All right.”
Kingsley waved his hand. “We are slow right now. Go ahead and leave. We won’t announce it before you’re ready. Everyone will just assume you’re on holiday.”
“I died, you know. That night in the forest.” He had told Ron and Hermione about Kings’ Cross, years ago. And many people suspected that he had in fact died and come back to life. But he had never told anyone else what had happened in the world between worlds that night. Once the words came, however, they would not stop. He told every detail of it to Draco, not caring if he sounded like a crackpot. “Sometime I wonder if I made the right decision, coming back.”
Harry closed the distance between them. He placed one hand on the side of Draco’s face, feeling the coarse stubble against his palm. Draco’s breath hitched. Harry pulled him closer and brushed his lips against Draco’s. They were soft against Harry’s perpetually chapped lips.
Draco sighed. “I suppose we should get it out of the way. Fine. Harry, I deserved it. I was casting the Killing Curse. You hit me first, thankfully.”
That night, for the first time in years, Harry dreamed about the bathroom in sixth year—yelling Sectumsempra and Malfoy’s dying body bleeding out over the tile. He woke up in a deep sweat, full of shame and fear. But he quickly pushed it aside and focused instead on the sounds in his dark room and the breaths he took.
“All right. I’m not buying any more rounds. I only do that for good friends.” He rolled his eyes, but he couldn’t stay annoyed at them for long.
Harry pulled Draco into their room and pushed him onto Harry’s bed. He climbed on top of his lover, taking charge this time. He ran his tongue over Draco’s sharp jawline, savoring the roughness of his stubble, so different from a woman. Draco ran his hands under Harry’s shirt, and Harry sat up to pull it over his head.
“Hey, Draco. It’s all right. You’re okay. Look at me.” He pushed Draco away just a little. Draco tried to focus on Harry’s green eyes, but he was too scared.
Parvati smiled. “Yes! She’s recovering well. She will likely be returning to Hogwarts in a month or so. She had hoped to make it back at the beginning of the year, but her Healers wouldn’t clear her yet.”
Harry updated Draco on the fluxweed as they walked to Friday’s therapy session in the third week of school. He had nearly missed his morning watering session, but Draco had launched various items at his head until he woke up. Draco had already agreed to take on both weekend days of watering for the sleepy bastard. Seriously, who knew the Savior of the Wizarding World could nap so much?
Harry’s heart pounded in his chest. The images from his dream replayed over and over in his mind. He swallowed a large gulp of air in an unsuccessful attempt to steady his breathing. The tears had not stopped. He knew he looked a mess, but he nodded at Draco, embarrassed. “Fine.”
The Friday night before the Quidditch game, Harry sat in his living room and stared at a blank piece of parchment. He was seeing Draco tomorrow. He had to write this. His thoughts drifted to Draco for a bit, and his daydream became so real that he could swear he could hear Draco calling his name.
Draco sped up and leaned forward, his chest against Harry’s back. One strong hand reached around to Harry’s front and grabbed the thick prick that Harry had been rutting against the arm of the sofa. He tugged Harry’s cock in rhythm with his fucking. Both men panted and moaned and cried out strings of nonsensical obscenities. When Draco bit Harry’s shoulder, Harry spilled over Draco’s hand. With just a few deep thrusts, Draco came, hard, and cried out Harry’s name. He pulled out and ran a hand through his hair, enjoying watching his cum drip out of Harry’s perfect arse.
“All I could think about was you and inviting you to the ball and then, well, you know how things went.”
“Yes. A good length, too. But really thick, which I think is far more important. You have a beautiful cock, Harry.”
“Great. It was delicious.” He was about to tell them all about Malfoy, but he remembered his former nemesis’ embarrassment. “Speedy service, too.”
Artemis asked Draco to stay for a few minutes. She said she could give him a potion to help prevent the anxious nausea. “Shame is a useless emotion, Draco,” she added. “Guilt is healthy. It means you aren’t a sociopath. But shame…you don’t need that.”
“What? Oh, no. Sorry. I meant, your life with those Muggles. I believe I read that they were rather abusive to you.”
He showered quickly and cast a drying charm on his hair before styling it with the orange bottle of Fleamont’s. Then he stared helplessly at the clothes in his wardrobe. What vibe was he going for? Sexy and down to fuck? Handsome and romantic? Bugger. Clothes had never been difficult for Harry.
His slimy voice was closer now. Harry turned to cross the street to get away from him. A horn sounded, and Harry looked up just in time to see a car headed straight for him. He froze in fear. “Damn it, Potter!” was the last thing he heard before someone grabbed his arm and swirled him away.
“I know, it’s involved. That’s why I think we should put it under an established department. Let’s put it under Investigation for now.”
At that, Draco pushed Harry across the room and onto the bed. He put his dress robes over his head and tossed them aside. The two men began furiously grasping at each other’s clothes, trying to remove them.
Draco closed his eyes as Harry stroked and tugged. He fondled Draco’s bollocks and ran his fingers through the dark blond nest of hair. He snogged Draco while he did it. It was the most sensual, emotional sex Draco had ever had. But that was Harry, he thought. Emotions on his sleeve. Harry sped up as Draco’s breathing did. He buried his face in Draco’s neck, sucking hard. He would leave a mark, and Draco loved it. Tomorrow, everyone would know he had spent the night with Harry.
“Yes, well, you are about to find that I have very different anatomy than the Weasellette, so I need to know what you’re willing to do.”
“Says the man starting a charity and passing a law to protect wizarding children from abuse. Who is the Gryffindor now?”
“Happens a lot. One time, I saw Professor Sprout and Madam Hooch in the green house. Their dots were literally on top of each other.”
Harry had bought him a new watch, silver with emerald green numbers and hands on the face. Draco could finally discard the one his father had given him. Harry had remembered Draco’s complaints about it from months ago before they were even dating. There was a small note in the box that said, “I’ll give you the rest of your gift later.”
“Oh.” Was Harry a terrible kisser and had never known? And Draco had imagined it? Harry’s heart pounded in his chest. Draco noticed how Harry’s face had fallen.
Once on the other side of the gates, Draco took out his wand and floated his belongings behind him. It had been deemed unsafe for Draco to take the Hogwarts Express. Not enough supervision. But returning and finishing his studies had been yet another condition of Draco’s release.
When dessert disappeared, Professor McGonagall began her speech. “To our new students, welcome to Hogwarts. To our returning students, welcome home. I know that this place may hold dark memories for you from last school year. But we are working hard to return a sense of happiness and normalcy to these hallowed halls.”
“She, ah, never hit that spot. Fuck, that’s amazing. Draco, can you put another finger in? I want to feel more…full, I think.”
“Don’t wait on me,” she said. “Go home. Cry. Hug Harry.” She gave him a quick peck on the cheek and disappeared to meet with her sister for the first time in over two decades.
Remus smiled, a far-off look in his eye. He was a nice man and a great teacher, but Draco still thought he was a little strange. But Remus pulled himself out of his thoughts and looked at Draco. “Good. I’m glad to hear that she’s well. Now, let’s talk about your career. Are you interested in pursuing a potions mastery?”
Fully spent, the two laid on the floor with their hands intertwined. They laid there in silence for a long time, recovering and replaying the scene in their minds. Finally, Draco rolled over on his side and gazed at Harry.
Harry moved his tongue deftly. He loved the way Draco just melted when he ate him out. He reached around to grab his lover’s cock and began to stroke in time to his licks. He blew gently against Draco’s wet, swollen entrance. Draco whimpered. It wasn’t long before Draco was crying out incoherent strings of exclamations and obscenities. Harry darted his tongue in and out and sped up the strokes of his hands. Draco tensed, and Harry knew he was on the bring of an explosive orgasm. But he stopped himself. “Get inside me and fuck me, Potter.”
The second time he saw Malfoy was that Wednesday when he met Neville for a pint in Hogsmeade. As Neville rambled on about some new species of mimbulus that he had gotten for his NEWT students, Harry’s eyes were drawn to the far corner of the Three Broomsticks. There sat Headmistress McGonagall deep in conversation with a platinum blond man that Harry would know anywhere. Harry blinked a few times, sure he was mistaken. But that same chiseled jaw and piercing eyes from the coffeeshop, from his past, sat smiling with their former professor.
He started slow at first, not wanting to overwhelm Harry. But it was Harry Potter, and he was good at everything. He took Draco’s cock like a champ, and soon Draco was snapping his hips faster and faster, hitting the back of Harry’s throat. They both moaned, louder and louder. Draco was close, and he wasn’t ready yet.
“It’s not…you don’t get it, do you? Typical.” Ginny scoffed a little. Neville cocked his head at her. Her face grew red, and she stormed out of the compartment down the corridor.
“FUCK!” Draco cried as he spilled himself inside Harry. His body convulsed and shivered as his orgasm continued for several seconds. Harry waited until Draco had spent every last drop before climbing off and rolling onto the bed next to his boyfriend. He curled into the crook of Draco’s arm and cast a quick, wandless
That night at Draco’s flat, he and Harry bent their heads together over a draft of a statement about the child services law. It was important to get this right. The wizarding public could be vicious in their letters to the editor; this was the most crucial step yet. But Harry kept losing himself in Draco’s smell and the drawl of his voice.
They finished their breakfasts without another word. Draco got up when the Golden Trio did and followed a few steps behind them to the classroom. He heard jeers of “Death Eater” and “Traitorous bastard” and a few other colorful insults. But no one would risk a jinx hitting one of the three most famous people in all of Wizarding Britain, so he was safe.
Draco placed a gentle kiss on the head of Harry’s penis. Harry shivered. Draco darted his tongue out and swirled it on the tip, tasting the saltiness. He opened his mouth and took Harry in as deep as he could go. He liked to show off. Harry’s hips bucked, and he cried out. Draco moaned so Harry could feel the vibrations deep in his throat.
“Hope you like biryani!” Draco didn’t enjoy being interrupted when he was deep in thought like this, but food was always welcome. He looked up at Harry, confused for a moment, then smiled.
When they parted, Harry wanted more. Draco’s lips were pink and wet, and Harry could imagine them around his cock. His erection strained against his zipper.
That worked. He pumped some lotion on his hand and set to work. He flipped the pages with his free hand while he stroked himself. He stopped on a full-page spread of a platinum blond with a Chaser’s lean build. He imagined going down on his knees for him, what it would feel like to have a cock in his mouth. He rubbed and tugged, harder and faster, sucking an imaginary cock.
“You look terrible,” Draco said when Harry entered their room that evening. Harry’s eyes were red and puffy. But otherwise, he didn’t look terrible at all.
The graduation ceremony was short and sentimental. Hermione and a 7th year Ravenclaw gave speeches. Stoic McGonagall choked up during her address. Draco beamed as he crossed the stage. Everyone cheered when it was Harry’s turn, and Draco cheered loudest of all.  After the ceremony, Draco looked around for Steve and Andromeda. He found them standing near the Weasleys. Andromeda had a green-haired Teddy on her hip. And in between them was his mother.
“Yes, my dearest. I’m not hungry, though I do miss proper cooking.” She reached up and patted his cheek. “I am fine. It’s not ideal, but I have survived much worse things. And I’m already halfway through my sentence here.”
Harry and Daisy rode the Tube, and the little girl talked nonstop the whole way there. Harry had to remind her more than once that magic was a secret, and she would lower her voice into the whisper-yell that only little kids can do. Harry chuckled and decided anyone who overheard them would think she just had a vivid imagination.
Draco paused with a forkful of crème brulee halfway to his mouth. Harry’s eyes widened, and he felt a blush creep up his neck. Shit, he thought. I said I love you on our first real date. Smooth, Potter. Draco set his fork down and stared at a red-faced Harry. Maybe he could cover it up. “I mean, I love this crème brulee.”
Harry explored Draco’s cock and bollocks with his tongue. The sensation drove Draco wild. It was slow, teasing. The feeling made Draco incredibly sensitive by the time Harry finally put his whole mouth over the head of his cock.
Harry pulled Draco down to kiss him. He could still taste his own saltiness on Draco’s tongue. Draco whimpered as he pulled away. “It’s your turn now.”
“I’m your new head of house and Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor again. Minerva decided to tell the Board to screw themselves and that a werewolf was far less dangerous than a staff of Death Eaters.”
The people in their therapy session all congratulated Hermione. She had slowly begun to catch up on her homework since her admission on Wednesday. The others just smiled, knowing that it must be something she had shared in therapy. They had their own moments like that.
“I don’t know anything about money stuff. Can you help me find someone to talk to that won’t screw me over?”
When he finally stopped talking, Harry’s head spun with all the new information and emotions. But one question loomed above all his other thoughts. “Malfoy. Why?”
Harry’s chest was tight and his heart pounded in his chest when he woke. He tried to steady his breathing and stay wrapped up under the blankets in Draco’s bed. Draco’s head rested on his chest, and he really didn’t want to disturb him. But anxiety was creeping up, and he had to get away.
His words seemed to snatch Draco out of his pleasure, and the taller man quickly pulled away. He clambered off of Harry. “Sorry. We can’t. I just...I have to go.”
“Really. Even Purebloods, we might be queerer than everyone. As long as you get married to have an heir, no one cares who you fuck. That’s the real reason we have so many arranged marriages.”
“Merlin, you’re cute.” Draco pushed Harry’s shoulders until he was lying on the ground. Then he straddled him and leaned down to kiss him.
“Draco. I won’t insult you by pretending that your past decisions won’t make some things harder. There will always be those who look at you with disdain. Trust me, I know. But there are also those who will see what you have become. Who you have become.”
Therapy started like it always did. It was like a bad replicating charm, and Draco could recite it by memory. Padma couldn’t wait to talk about how hard her sister was taking what happened to Lavender, and how she wished Parvati would talk to someone else, which then made Padma feel like a bad twin. Susan would talk about losing her mother to the Snatchers. Hermione would politely say that she was still having trouble sleeping but that she thought the sleeping draught was starting to help. Then Artemis would ask if anyone else wanted to share. They would all stare at each other awkwardly until she dismissed them.
Draco ran his hands through Harry’s hair. Harry  tentatively touched Draco’s back, gaining more confidence and running his hands over his shoulders and spine. Draco pulled back for air.
He shook his head. “No, it’s Daisy’s birthday party. Ron and Hermione are bringing Rose and Hugo, too.”
Harry took a piss, lost in his thoughts, until a flash of white-blond hair appeared in his periphery. He glanced over to see Draco Malfoy unzipping his fly two urinals down. For a fleeting moment, Harry wished Malfoy was next to him so he could sneak a peek. He pushed the thought aside.
He probably shouldn’t have asked to walk to breakfast with Harry. But when Harry was about to leave, that nauseous feeling returned. The thought of walking through the halls of Hogwarts with no protection was terrifying. No one would mess with him if he was with the bloody Savior, right?
Draco was done for. He sobbed as he ate the cupcake. Harry let him. When he finally caught his breath, Draco told him everything that had happened.
The room was sparkling and the bedding looked new. The floors were polished and a vase of fresh flowers sat on the dresser.
Two months flew by, and soon the day of the Wizengamot vote was upon them. Though public opinion polls favored the law by a large margin, Draco was a nervous wreck, even worse than he had been the day of the meeting with the Minister and Chief Warlock. Harry was nervous, too, but calming down Draco required too much of his attention to focus on the possible bad outcome. There’s not going to be a bad outcome, he told himself.
Teddy burst into tears at Harry’s yelling. Harry knelt and whispered sorry over and over as he picked up his godson and rocked him till he calmed down.
Harry paused. He wasn’t sure. It just sort of happened. “I don’t know. I guess I thought it would be bloody awkward if we shared a room and didn’t talk. And no one else seems to be talking to you, so…”
He looked at the file that had appeared on his desk. It was just clean-up from accidental, underage magic. Muggle Liaison was already there and had rounded up all the witnesses; they just needed an Auror to Obliviate their memories. He looked at the address. Surrey.
Andromeda, Remus, and Teddy had made themselves at home. Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Longbottoms and Lovegoods, and a few other people Draco didn’t recognize were there. McGonagall and Aberforth Dumbledore stopped by in the afternoon.  And everyone seemed like they belonged. Well, maybe not Mr. and Mrs. Granger.
Malfoy stood as Harry approached the table and stuck out his hand to shake Harry’s. Harry accepted it, and he remembered a time many years ago when he had refused to take the same hand. But they were older now, both victims of a childhood neither should have had to endure.
He slipped his cock out of Harry’s mouth, and Harry groaned in dismay. But Draco lowered his balls, and Harry took them in his mouth, sucking and swirling his tongue around.
Artemis smiled. “I’ll be in my office this afternoon if you need me, Draco. Perhaps you and your not-evil aunt can do some catching up?”
The last time he had spoken to, or even seen, Malfoy was at the Death Eater sentencing. Harry’s testimony during the trials had ensure the freedom of both Malfoy and his mother. Malfoy murmured a quick “thank you” before the sea of reporters and photographers had separated them. Narcissa had written him a letter of thanks, but then the two Malfoys disappeared from public life.
Harry sighed and collected his thoughts. “First of all, I’m not getting involved with him. It’s strictly business. Second, he’s not the same person he was back then. And frankly, neither am I.”
Draco placed his head on Harry’s chest. Harry’s strong arm pulled him close. Harry dozed while Draco thought about his new life. He thought back to what Artemis had said months ago and finally understood. He felt guilty about his past decisions, but he had started to make them right. But the no longer wore the burden of shame. It was an emotion his father had put on him from an early age. Now, he chose to live in the light.
“Damn, Draco. That was…wow.” His eyes popped open. “I haven’t even touched you. I swear I’m not normally so selfish.”
He pulled Harry against him into a passionate kiss and used one hand to remove the bow. Then he smacked Harry on his firm arse, making Harry moan into his mouth. They took their time, kissing and grinding against each other.
Draco was quiet most of the day. He kept scratching his arm where his Dark Mark was. It was easy to forget about at Hogwarts. But here he was, an ex-Death Eater celebrating Christmas with a bunch of war veterans. Veterans who had fought on the right side of the war.
Lupin appeared at the head of their table with a chipper good morning. The other eighth years greeted him back in various stages of enthusiasm. The werewolf had a long cloth wrapped around his torso, with a large bulge on his chest. A bulge that moved. Lupin patted it.
They made their goodbyes, and Draco promised he would come visit Narcissa the very next day. Outside of the gates to Hogwarts, Draco took a deep breath, savoring his freedom. Harry watched him, grinning.
The first two years had been rough. Strangers ran up to him on the streets to thank him for defeating Voldemort. The press stalked his every move. When the anxiety attacks and nightmares became too much to bear, Hermione convinced him to see a Mind Healer at St. Mungo’s. But the Mind Healer was too starstruck to help. His best friend loaded him up with self-help books instead, and Harry used something called “mindfulness” to avoid confronting his demons. (“I don’t think you’re using it right,” Hermione had said on more than one occasion.)
“My pleasure.” But Harry knew it was about to be his pleasure instead. Draco unzipped Harry’s jeans and tugged them down to below his buttocks. Harry’s thick erection pressed against his boxers, vying against the fabric for its freedom. Draco grabbed Harry’s cock through the thin cotton, and Harry gasped. “Fuck, you are thick. I can’t wait to take your huge cock up my arse. But first...”
“Oh, Merlin no! I’m a horrible liability in the kitchen.” He grinned. “Two Galleons, a sickle, and thirteen knuts.”
Harry exited the Floo into his living room with a bounce in his step. It wasn’t a date, of course. There would be an almost six-year-old girl with them. But still, he was going to a Quidditch game with Draco. For the first night in weeks, Harry’s sleep was unplagued by nightmares.
At home, Harry drank a whole bottle of elf-made wine by himself. That night, he dreamed that Vernon The Clown kept taking his food away but Dudley kept shoving it down his throat as he yelled, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”
Harry chuckled. “So demanding. But we are celebrating your win. I guess I’ll let it slide.” He whispered a cleansing spell that made Draco shiver as it worked. Then he lowered his head between Draco’s beautiful, pale arse cheeks. He started with one long, smooth lick. Draco let out the most glorious moan, encouraging Harry to continue.
“Fuck. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck shit Merlin fuck.” Draco was moving his hips, eager for more. “Oh, fuck, Harry. You’re so good at that.”
Draco said nothing; he waited for Harry to make the next move. Harry grabbed Draco’s left arm and pressed his lips against the Dark Mark. They had both been scarred by the same enemy, he realized. Draco gasped and a single tear rolled down his cheek. Then Harry moved his gentle kiss to each of the scars on Draco’s chest. He vowed to himself that he would stop running. He let his lips brush against Draco’s lightly then pulled away with a grin.
“No!” Harry remembered how Draco felt about yelling and counted to five. “No. Thank you. I’m not suicidal.”
Draco thought for a moment, trying to figure out the swirl of emotions in his chest. “Remus said he was proud of me. And it just…my father never said that to me. Ever. So, I’m angry. And sad.”
“Did you hear what I said, Harry?” Neville tapped him on the shoulder. Hermione gave him a strange look. “Sprout is retiring next year and wants me to take the job.”
He thanked Harry for saving his life and for testifying at his trial. “You gave me the chance to be better, just like I told Daisy today. I’ll always be indebted to you for that.”
After nearly two months of evening meetings, including several with Blaise, Draco and Harry were ready to meet with the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and the Minister. With Harry’s help, the pair had collected the requisite endorsements of the law from members of the Wizengamot. If Chief Warlock Dawlish and Kingsley approved the draft, it would be added to the Wizengamot’s agenda.
Draco laid back down and snuggled against Harry. “Thank you for trusting me. Thank you for baring it all to me. It means more than you’ll ever know.”
Draco worked his mouth lower down Harry’s body, stopping to leave bite marks all over his chest, claiming Harry as his. He grabbed the lube from his nightstand in one hand and went lower. He murmured a cleansing charm just before he put his mouth over Harry’s erection.
It wasn’t long before Holyhead’s seeker caught the Snitch, giving a huge win to the Harpies. Daisy cheered along with all the fans, and it was so adorable that even Draco didn’t look disappointed. When Harry told Daisy that she was going to meet the Harpies’ chaser, she looked like she might burst. Harry led Daisy and Draco into the VIP section and down to the locker rooms. Harry, of course, was the only person in the crowd who didn’t have to show their VIP badge. Every now and then fame came in handy.
The expression on Draco’s face clearly said he didn’t believe Harry in the slightest. “If you’re sure. I was just wondering what the plan was for tomorrow. Do you want to meet at the game or before?”
“I just mean…The Dark Lord didn’t only want to kill you. He wanted to literally take over the world. You were just an obstacle for him to overcome. If there had never been a prophecy, never been a Harry Potter, he still would have tried to take over.”
“This sounds terrible. It reads like a textbook. It needs to be more personal.” Draco buried his head in his hands. For all his planning, he became easily overwhelmed. Harry resisted the urge to place a hand on his back.
“Yes. You will be given a grade for attendance. Now, you can choose your own roommates. There are two rooms for the young ladies, each with four beds. Miss Brown will take whichever bed is left when she returns. And there are four rooms with three beds each for the gentlemen. Summon a house-elf once you’ve decided where you’re staying, and they’ll bring your belongings. Any other questions? No? Very well. My little flat is just down the hall from Sir Cadogan’s painting, if you need me. Blue door. Goodnight, and welcome back.”
Harry smacked his arse. “You should use your talents to get me a glass of water.” Draco rolled his eyes and bent down for his wand. He summoned two glasses from the kitchen and filled them both with a wordless aguamenti. “Oh, right. Magic.”
Harry furrowed his brow, thinking. He had always assumed that Lucius had doted on his son, that the two were close. He remembered how Vernon’s yelling made him feel, and in that moment, he saw the same feelings in Draco’s grey eyes.
Draco grabbed his own cock hard and jerked himself as Harry fucked him. It was almost too much to bear, with Harry’s thick shaft hitting his prostate over and over. He cried out as he spilled out all over his and Harry’s chests.
Harry stepped outside the gates of Hogwarts and Apparated away with a pop. Draco checked his watch. Steve should be arriving in ten minutes or so. He had hurried Harry down early so that he could have a few moments to collect himself.
Harry gaped like a fish, unsure what to say. He didn’t mean to propose to Draco, but that’s what it sounded like. And he
“Hurry up, Malfoy,” Harry said. He was trying to tease him, but it just came out desperate. Draco moved back onto the bed next to his partner. He placed his fingers just inside Harry’s waistband, ready to pull it back. He leaned down and whispered in Harry’s ear.
Draco Malfoy sat in a corner at a small table. He waved Harry over, and Harry suddenly feared what would happen if the press saw him in public with Draco. He hadn’t even considered that earlier, because he would have insisted on a Muggle pub instead. But Harry didn’t see any of the reporters he recognized. He took a deep breath and walked over to have a drink with Malfoy.
He made his way to the back of the store to find help. A blond man in a plaid shirt was behind the counter with his back to Harry. He had strong shoulders and a perfect round arse, and Harry let himself admire the man’s backside for a moment before asking for assistance.
Malfoy Disapparated with a resounding crack. Harry stared at the spot where Draco had stood for several long moments. He supposed they were still enemies, even after all this time.
In the next breath, they both fell into roaring laughter. For no good reason, they started laughing and couldn’t stop. Harry’s gut ached from the deep chortles, and Draco looked like he might piss himself. It felt good. Right. And the sight of Draco’s tear-stained face filled with a grin was the sexiest thing Harry had ever seen.
Once everyone knew everyone’s favorite dessert, Artemis waved her wand. A floating display board appeared above her head.
“Yeah. Let’s move in together.” Harry grinned, and Draco returned his smile. Harry loved when Draco smiled so big that his grey eyes squinted. Harry patted Draco’s stomach. “Come on, let’s clean up and get dressed, roomie.”
“I know. We can work up to that. Just get me off with your hand.” And I’ll be able to train you exactly how I want you, he thought.
Malfoy smirked. “I’m not apologizing for my impeccable style. But I want to apologize for what I said before. I was quite nervous and had no idea where to begin. It came out all wrong, and I am sorry.”
An instant later, they stood in front of the Holyhead stadium. Daisy wobbled on her feet for a moment and looked slightly green. But then she burst out a loud, “That was so cool!” and Harry knew she was fine.
Harry was the first of the eighth years to reach the table, and he threw his arms around his friend and mentor. “Remus! What are you doing here?”
The house was dark and dismal. Draco wrinkled his nose. “Your sense of interior decorating is abysmal.”
Harry enjoyed explaining Quidditch the wide-eyed girl. And he had Draco to help. Daisy couldn’t decide which team to root for because Draco cheered for the Falcons and Harry, out of loyalty to Ginny, cheered for Holyhead. So, Daisy cheered for both.
Harry paused outside, gaping at the sign on the door. He’d never been to one of these restaurants, never had a reason to. No date had ever seemed worth it. But he’d heard so many great things about the French restaurants with waitlists and three-course dinners. He felt, well, special.
She didn’t say much as they walked to Fortescue’s, only occasionally pointing at things and asking Harry to explain. Harry smiled and remembered how overwhelmed he had been when Hagrid brought him to Diagon Alley all those years ago. They stopped in front of the ice cream parlor, and Harry asked Daisy if she was all right. She nodded then shrieked as a ghostly Jack Russell Terrier appeared in front of them. Ron’sexasperated voice said, “Sorry, mate. We’re running late. Apparently picking out which shoes to wear requires tantrums and drama.”
It was a good thing he did, too, as Hermione let out a string of obscenities about the rude goblin she had just encountered. But then she shook herself and smiled at Harry. “You look like you’re about to burst. You finally slept with him, then?”
Steve gave Draco a strange look. He knew Draco wasn’t saying anything. “Doing gifts with my mum tonight. She’s got a new boyfriend, and they’re going to Bora Bora for the holidays.”
“Fine. Welcome to our home, Draco. I’m sure it’s not up to your standards but---OW! Fine, I’ll stop.” Ron rubbed his arm where Hermione had pinched him.
When he reentered the bedroom, he felt shy and uncomfortable. He didn’t know what to say, and Draco just stared at him. And he continued to stare for a really long time. Harry shifted his weight from foot to foot, waiting for Draco to say something, anything. Finally, he cleared his throat. “Right. Well, you’re quite a bit taller than me.”
Charlie was the first person that came to mind. But he already knew he could get off to Charlie. He suspended the magazine above his head with a wordless Wingardium and flipped through the pages. He imagined the shirtless Quidditch players completely naked, fisting their cocks like he had seen Neville do that time.
“Everything. Our past. And...and we cried. And then we laughed. And then I kissed him.” Hermione and Ron exchanged a glance. Hermione rolled her eyes, and Ron grinned. “Oh my god, guys. Did you bet on my love life again?”
“Don’t you think you should wait to see if the law passes before you resign? I think it will, but throwing aside your career on a probably seems rash.”
They said their farewells, and Draco, Harry, and Daisy left the stadium. “Have a very happy birthday, Daisy,” Draco told the little girl. She hugged him goodbye.
Parvati and Lavender entered the room, and everyone that was left burst into applause. Lavender, ever the diva, took a bow. Then Terry asked Draco to play chess with him. Draco was surprised, but he agreed. When he looked up again, Harry was nowhere to be found.
Now free to touch Draco as much as he wanted, Harry wound a hand in Draco’s perfect hair and pulled gently. Draco whimpered in response. Harry’s other arm slid down Draco’s back and grabbed the curve of his tight buttocks. He pulled Draco closer, grinding his pelvis against the taller man’s. Draco’s hands slipped under Harry’s jumper, exploring the firm muscles of his chest. When a hand found Harry’s nipples, Draco pinched, hard, making him let out an embarrassing, guttural noise. Draco giggled into Harry’s mouth. “You like that, huh?”
Harry was taken aback. He had just unloaded years’ worth of heavy baggage onto the boyfriend he had only been dating for four days. But he nodded. Draco pulled him back to lay down on the bed then wrapped his arms around him. He kissed the back of Harry’s head and pressed his warm body against Harry’s back.
He tapped his wand on the appropriate brick, and Daisy gasped loudly as the archway to Diagon Alley sprung to life. She gripped his hand tightly, unsure at the new experience before her, and Harry guided her onto the bustling street.
“See, the Muggles have government departments dedicated to stopping child abuse. In England, it’s under the Department of Education, but in America it’s under social services. Either way, it’s part of the government because there are laws against child abuse. They remove children from dangerous homes. They give parenting lessons. And yeah, it’s not always the best system. Bureaucracy is a bitch, you know. But there are also charities that work with children. But did you know the Ministry has no such laws? They’ve always taken the approach of turning a blind eye and not getting involved in family life. And well, that’s just wrong. There are innocent children being hurt by the people who are supposed to care for them. And no one is doing anything about it.”
Narcissa sighed. “Well, it’s not the finest accommodations I’ve ever stayed in. But I pass the time. They give me all the books I can read. I’ve been reading Muggle books, Draco. And we really did have it all wrong.”
He could get used to the begging. Harry was laying there on the ground, hungry for Draco. Desperate for him. He had his own hand gripping his own cock as he begged for Draco. Draco licked his lips and slipped off his pants.
Steve pulled miniature versions of Draco’s trunk and bags from his pocket and waved his wand to bring them back to full size. Draco smiled. He liked Steve. They had spent a lot of time together this summer. When Draco was released from the holding cell at the Ministry and learned the Manor was still in the government’s custody, Steve had taken him in. The young Auror lived in a small flat in the Wizarding neighborhood of Birmingham. He was kind and didn’t judge Draco at all. He was the first person that Draco had ever started to open up to about life as the son of a Death Eater.
They drank in silence for a few minutes, neither sure what to say next. “How’s your mother?” Harry finally asked.
Harry seemed to know that something was wrong the second Draco entered the common room. He leapt to his feet and folded Draco into a hug before leading him to their bedroom. They laid down, and Harry spooned his boyfriend.
Neville shook his head and sat down across from Harry. “She’s so angry. I mean, she’s always had a temper, but I can’t figure out what will set her off next. She’s yelled at me no less than five times since King’s Cross.”
“What makes you think something happened with Draco?” Harry shot back. Hermione just fixed him with her hard stare. “Fine, okay, okay. We kissed.”
“Piss off,” he said. But he smiled. “It’s hard, you know, to realize that when a madman has literally been after you since you were in nappies.”
Harry and Draco ate, chatting about anything and nothing. He asked Harry about his day, and he seemed genuniely interested to hear about it. “I suppose it’s a good thing that work has been slow. Means less dark wizards and whatnot, right?”
Draco placed a hand on his arm. “You’re making a difference now, with this.” He gestured at the paperwork. “I need help. I can’t run the charity alone, and I want to be hands-on with the children and the training when we start. I don’t want to pressure you into this. I want it to be your choice. But will you run the charity with me?”
Their wands were confiscated for identity verification and placed in small lockers. A guard escorted them to a small waiting area where several other people were waiting. No one looked happy. No one talked.
“Yes. You know, after the trial, they took nearly the entire Malfoy estate. He had a small inheritance fund that wasn’t in Lucius’ name, but rumor has it, he donated half of it to the War Orphan Fund. Then he disappeared.”
Nothing sounded better. Harry didn’t remember the last time he just lounged around the house. Weekends were full of obligations and errands and whatnot. It felt good to be free. He nodded. Draco pressed a quick kiss to his cheek then stood to open the television cabinet. He sat down on the couch with the remote. It was odd seeing Draco use Muggle technology and so comfortably at that. But then he flipped the telly on to some home decorating show, and Harry took a moment to appreciate how right it looked. How right it felt. He looked forward to more days like this in the future. Then, he decided to just be mindful and appreciate right now.
“I think that’s enough of that line of questioning,” the Minister said. “Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. Now, do you have a place of residence lined up for after graduation?”
Draco looked at the floor. “Yes. Sorry to trouble you. I, uh, had a bit of an episode because I thought I saw my aunt. But this is my other aunt. Not the evil one. So. I’m fine now. Thanks to Harry.”
At precisely three o’clock, the Chief Warlock, Dawlish, called the Wizengamot to order. Kingsley Shacklebolt greeted the visitors and listed out the agenda. The vote on the Child Services law would be last.
He stepped forward and pinned Harry against the front door, his lips crashing onto Harry’s. Harry couldn’t help the moan that escaped his lips. How many times had he imagined being pinned by Draco’s strong arms? He returned Draco’s kiss with fervor, unable to get enough of his taste. Draco bit his bottom lip, and Harry pressed his waist against Draco so he could feel his erection. “Fuck,” Draco murmured. He released Harry’s arms and ran his hands over Harry’s chest.
The vote opened. One by one, each member of the Wizengamot cast their vote with a wave of their wand. Magical tally marks filled the air in the center of the courtroom. Harry’s heart beat faster with every vote. The “for” column filled up. In the end, only three council members voted against the law: all were elderly and unpleasant.
Draco shrugged. “If it’s not an easy answer, what does that mean?” Harry didn’t respond for a while, and Draco ate in silence. “What would you be doing if you weren’t an Auror?”
Draco grinned. “Well, get over here. You deserve a celebratory blowjob.” He patted the bed next to him with a sly smile. It didn’t take long for Harry to remove his trousers and pants and climb into the bed next to Draco.
Harry swallowed and made his way to the couch. “Sorry. I’m acting like a blushing virgin on her wedding night.”
“Oh, Draco. Look at me.” Draco gazed up at him with sad, silver eyes. “You are so brave. You changed your life. You confronted your past, while I just ran away from it. You are single-handedly changing our government to protect children. You came to me the other night and poured your heart out. Don’t ever think you aren’t brave.
“More,” Draco said through his teeth. And Harry gave more. It was a stretch, a good stretch with a bit of a burn. He probably should have let Harry warm him up more, but he would adjust. Harry ran a hand gently through Draco’s hair, the sweetest gesture Draco had ever experienced during sex. He relaxed more.
It didn’t take long for Draco to come, and Harry swallowed down every bit of his release. He stood, and Draco kissed him. Then he lathered Harry’s body with soap, using it as lube when he got to Harry’s penis. Harry came in an embarrassingly short time; he’d been horny since he woke up.
“Hello, Harry! Good to see you. We’ve rounded up all the Muggle witnesses into the shop just over there. There’s only about a dozen. Some little Muggleborn girl got scared of a clown, and she shrunk him. Can’t say I blame her. Clowns are damn creepy.”
Draco smiled. “It’s okay. I like a bit of orgasm denial. Makes it better in the end. Sometimes I wank for forty-five minutes or more before I let myself come.”
Harry stared at Malfoy as he continued to explain. Malfoy could have told Harry that he was a hippogriff in love with a unicorn, and Harry wouldn’t have been as surprised as he was by this revelation. Draco Malfoy, champion for child welfare. But Harry listened, intrigued.
There was a long silence as everyone settled back in their seats. Draco felt as if he might be sick. But Potter had stopped yelling, and that was all that mattered right then. He did the breathing technique that Artemis had taught them on the first day.
Draco blushed and hoped his mother hadn’t heard. But she was talking to Andromeda and Remus. And somehow she had ended up holding Teddy, who had turned his hair blond with a black streak like Narcissa’s.
He looked so hopeful in that moment. Draco wanted to say yes, of course they were friends. But he was a Slytherin after all. “We can be if you tell me about Neville’s cock.”
Harry saw Malfoy five more times over the next several weeks, always at the Ministry leaving meetings with various important people. He wrote to Neville to find out if he had learned anything about Malfoy’s meeting with McGonagall. All Neville said was that he saw Malfoy leaving the Headmistress’ office a couple times.
The Wizengamot was meeting in Courtroom Ten. Several members already sat in their plum robes, but Harry and the others were a half-hour early. They wanted good seats for the result. They made their way into the front row of visitor seating and sat in relative silence, occasionally whispering to each other some random observation. The visitor seats began to fill up around them, and more members of the council took their places. Not everyone was here for the Child Services law. Three other laws would be voted on today. But many people were there in support of Harry and Draco. Blaise Zabini took a seat on Draco’s other side. Neville, McGonagall, and Luna sat behind them, as well as a few other professors. Pansy Parkinson waved at Draco as she entered and took a seat a few rows back. Molly and Arthur entered with Andromeda, and much to Harry’s surprise, Narcissa.
Harry collapsed onto the floor and hit his head on something. And something large fell on top of him. “Ow,” he moaned as he tried to get his bearings. He adjusted his glasses and saw that he was laying on a black rug and had hit his head on the corner of a glass coffee table. “Fuck.”
It worked. Harry pushed himself further down. It was so tight that Draco swore he saw stars. He hadn’t fucked someone in a long time, and it was pure bliss. He let Harry continue to ease down onto him.
“I am in love with Draco Malfoy, and he’s in love with me. I didn’t save Draco. He saved himself. If anyone doesn’t believe that Draco is capable of good, then they’re saying I’m a liar. We have no secrets from each other. This isn’t a fling. I haven’t been Imperiused, and I’m not under a love potion. We expect everyone to now respect our privacy.”
“Already? Glad to see that rashness your house is famous for didn’t wear off after puberty. Well, how do you feel?”
The week just got stranger. He didn’t see Malfoy on Thursday, but he did see someone else from his past. Someone he had never thought he would see again. Someone he very much wanted never to see again.
Back at Hogwarts, Harry and Draco headed to their dorm room laden with gifts. Harry collapsed on the bed with an exaggerated sigh.
“Malfoy, is it now? I kind of like that.” Draco snapped the elastic band of Harry’s pants. Harry groaned. Draco knelt to the floor and pulled off Harry’s shoes and socks. He slowly pulled off his trousers next and cast them aside.
That was the only thing Harry needed to hear to spring into action. He pushed Draco off him and flipped him over. The sight of his tight arsehole alone would have been enough to make Harry come, if he hadn’t so desperately wanted to be inside of it. He murmured a wandless cleaning spell over Draco’s entrance. Draco shivered, and Harry swiped his tongue over the hole.
“Oh, Merlin, no! It was amazing. Truly.” He stopped, and Harry was more confused than ever. “I just meant that, I imagined me taking you out to a romantic dinner and inviting you back here. And, well. I didn’t want our first time to be after we had just cried for two hours. I’m not a bloody Hufflepuff. And I was worried that it was just the heat of the moment, that you only kissed me because we had just been so emotional and sharing and...If the Slytherins could see me now...Merlin.”
Daisy nodded knowingly. “Sometimes I make bad choices, like when I don’t let Brian play with my toys. But I try to make good choices, too.”
Harry grinned and looked up at Draco. His hair was combed, and he was fully dressed. If he didn’t look so damn good in his suit, Harry would be disappointed that his chest was no longer bare. It took everything in him not to tell Draco how sexy he looked.
“It wasn’t always physical, you know. Mostly he would berate me and humiliate me. Emotional abuse, they call it. He would hit me and hex me when I really pissed him off, though. I was five the first time I remember being hexed. And he was worse to my mother, especially if she tried to stop him from hurting me.” He cleared his throat. “But then he would buy me something or take me on holiday some place great. I wanted nothing more than his approval. And look where that got me.”
His thoughts grew incoherent as he approached his climax. Soon, he spurted over Harry’s hands and both of their stomachs. He let out a loud groan before collapsing on his back next to Harry. Harry propped himself on one elbow and licked a finger.
Years spent beating death and fighting evil created a unique bond, and Harry was still in the habit of rushing to his best friends whenever something major happened. He checked his desk for any new cases—there were none—then rushed down to Hermione’s office. She was meeting with a goblin representative, and Harry paced up and down the hallway waiting for her to finish. When the goblin finally left, Harry pushed into her office, slammed the door, and cast a silencing spell.
“Incidentally, Ron,” Hermione said. “Want to go into town for the night? I don’t think my room will be available any time soon.”
Harry bent further over Draco’s back to deepen his thrusts. He reached his arms around Draco’s waist and began to furiously stroke Draco’s weeping cock. Draco came with a shout and a whimper. As he tightened around Harry’s cock, Harry threw his head back and roared with his release.
Harry waited for Draco to continue. They were still standing by the door, neither making a move to sit in the living room. The tension was palpable, and for the first time, Harry was actually afraid of what Draco would say.
“I love you, too, Draco Malfoy, you brilliant, wonderful man. Let me prove it to you.” With a wave of his wand, he undressed both of them. Draco smirked but Harry planted a passionate kiss on his lips before he could reply with some smart-ass comment. He ran his hands over Draco’s bare chest down to his already swelling cock. He gave Draco’s long erection a tug. Draco groaned into Harry’s mouth, sending a shiver down Harry’s spine.
The meal was mostly silent. There were no exciting summer holidays to discuss. Save for the neutral Slytherins, the last time everyone had seen each other was the Battle. Some of them had crossed paths at the various funerals over the summer, but all of those ran together in Harry’s mind. They had all lost friends and family members. Harry wondered if returning had really been a good idea. Kingsley had offered to let Harry into the Auror Academy without his NEWTS, but at the time, Harry wasn’t so sure he wanted to ever fight again.
As Harry was debating whether or not to say hello to Malfoy, the sorting began. The Sorting Hat’s song was surprisingly upbeat and optimistic, which did not seem to match anyone’s mood. Harry zoned out as all the first years were sorted. Ron had to nudge him when the food arrived.
“Your arse is my gift?” Harry nodded and continued staring at Draco until he understood. “Your…arse…is my gift. Are you sure?”
The eighth-year common room was empty. They heard moans coming from the second door on the boy’s hall. “That’s Blaise and someone,” Draco said. Harry got a strange look on his face. “Hey! I dated Blaise. I can’t help that. But I want you now.”
“Aha!” Hamish said, as if he’d caught Draco in a lie. “And what if you don’t get the requisite grades? What then? You must have employment lined up. It’s part of your conditions.”
The Daily Prophet published Hermione’s article within the week after she hosted Harry and Draco for dinner that first time. Now, Draco came to every Saturday night dinner, ever Wednesday family dinner with the Dursleys, and he even came to Sunday lunches at the Burrow. He also dragged Harry to Thursday dinners with his mother and whoever she was dating that week.
Hermione, Padma, Millicent, and Daphne were laying on the floor studying. Ron was playing chess with Terry. Harry was busy working on an essay for Charms. Draco was trying to read a potions book for his capstone project.
Harry stepped up and hugged Narcissa, and to Draco’s surprise, she embraced him back. “Thank you for taking care of my boy, Harry.”
Draco smirked. “And here I thought you didn’t have a romantic bone in your body. Yes, I’d like that.”
Harry nodded. “I can’t guarantee how friendly Ginny will be. She’s had a rough time this year. We finally got a chance to talk today. I think she’ll be okay, but…”
Someone was puking in the toilet cubicle. Harry splashed cold water on his face and tried to ignore the retching. He was shaky and weak and wanted nothing more than to climb into his bed and sleep for the next week.  The cubicle door opened. In the mirror, Harry saw Draco exit the stall. His hair was disheveled, and his tie was untied. He wiped his mouth and walked up to the sink next to Harry.
Narcissa’s eyes welled with tears, and it nearly broke Draco. A lump grew in his throat. She patted his face again, then stroked his cheek softly. “I can start writing and receiving letters just after the new year.”
“You’re a good man, Draco. You had shit circumstances and made some shit decisions, but you’re a good man. Don’t forget it.”
Draco took off at a run, with a laughing Harry trying to keep up. He threw his arms around Narcissa and cried into her shoulder. She murmured how proud she was of him, how much she had missed him.
“Absolutely incredible. We can work up to it. And Harry, you can tell me to stop at any time, okay?”
Weasley’s voice snapped him out of his spiraling thoughts. Everyone was looking at him. Harry was still standing, his piercing green eyes wide and fearful. Weasley of all people had jumped out of his seat and knelt at Draco’s feet. “You were shaking, mate. And I didn’t think you could get any paler, but—”
Draco placed the books back on the shelves, put his bag over his shoulder, and made his way out of the library. The halls were abandoned; everyone was getting ready for the Halloween Ball. McGonagall had decided that the year was going so well, they all deserved some fun. He wondered again if he should ask Harry to go with him, but he didn’t want to ruin their friendship. Things were going well for Draco. He had several friends, and his classes were going well. Steve had written to tell him that he was trying to get permission to let Draco visit his mother over Christmas. Andromeda and he had met for tea in Lupin’s apartment a few times.
Harry shook his head, laughing as he returned to his office. He got through another slow day then stopped to pick up Indian takeaway before returning to Draco’s flat.
Harry’s strong hands grabbed Draco’s arse and pulled him closer. Draco moaned at the contact of their erections. Then Harry’s hands slipped into Draco’s pants. He kneaded the tight muscles in Draco’s butt and reached between his legs to massage his perineum.
They were late to the party. But they came in holding hands, and everyone gaped. Harry saw a couple of cameras flash, and he knew that they would be on the cover of the Daily Prophet by Monday. He said as much to Draco, who shrugged.
Draco sunk back to his knees. Harry sat up and rested his weight on the palms of his hands. Draco gazed into Harry’s emerald eyes. “Take off your glasses,” he said. Harry did.
“I almost didn’t think you were going to order,” Draco said when Harry opened the door at nine forty-five Friday night.
Malfoy stared after Hermione, his jaw dropped. Harry just rolled his eyes. “Better get used to it, Malfoy. These two go at it like Kneazles in heat.”
Harry shook his head. “Because you realize they were shit choices. Because you’re fighting those choices every day.” He bumped his hip into Draco’s. “And because you put up with me.”
Then Rose insisted they visit Flourish and Blotts; she was her mother’s child, after all. But Daisy loved to read, and Harry had no problem buying her as many wizarding children’s books as she wanted. As Rose pointed out all of her favorite books, Ron leaned into Harry. “It’s hard for her to make friends, you know. She’s what the kids call a nerd, and she can be a bit of a know-it-all.”
“Mm?” Harry lay with his eyes closed, relishing the satiation that comes with powerful orgasms. He didn’t think he could form a coherent sentence just yet.
It was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes. “No, Draco. I’m not sure. That’s why I planned to send you in the other room so I could put a giant red bow on my bum. Yes, I’m sure. Now, get over here and unwrap me.”
Draco nodded. A third finger breached him, and Harry gave him a moment to adjust before he began pumping his fingers. Draco opened his eyes. He could see the arousal painted on Harry’s face. He couldn’t wait any longer.
Harry snorted. In general, he agreed that MLEP officers were incompetent. Indeed, it was one too many botched Obliviates by MLEP that gave the job of dealing with Muggle witnesses to the Aurors. And MLEP were the arch-rivals of the Aurors in the annual inter-office Quidditch tournament. But Seamus was an officer, so they weren’t all bad.
Of all the wizarding businesses to open in the post-war boom, Harry was most excited about Curry Cauldron. Perhaps it was the one-quarter of Tamil blood that ran through his veins, but there was just nothing like the combination of spices and layers of flavor that Indian cuisine provided. Not that bland excuse for a chicken tikka masala that Aunt Petunia used to make. But the times the Dursleys ordered out were some of his only happy memories.
Harry ordered curry again on Tuesday, but someone else delivered it. He tried to hide his disappointment, but he swore that his lamb vindaloo was bland. Friday was Molly’s birthday, and the disappointment he felt at not ordering in was absurd, even for Harry’s irrational emotions.
Seconds later, Draco landed next to Harry on Grimmauld Place. He watched as Number 12 appeared, pushing 11 and 13 out of the way. Harry took his hand and led him inside.
Draco sighed. “I don’t know what it is about you that makes me turn into a bloody, cuddly badger. Next thing you know I’ll be wearing yellow and black. But yes, I’d like to do this. All of it, not just the sex, although that shag was the stuff of legends.”
Steve picked up Draco at seven in the morning. Harry gave him one long kiss at the gate. Draco had begged him not to come. He didn’t want Harry’s influence being the reason he got free. He wanted to have earned it himself.
Harry slept fitfully and not much at all that night. Why had Draco left like that? Maybe he didn’t feel the same about Harry. But he had returned the kiss quickly and urgently. And he had definitely been hard. Was he seeing someone else? It was possible, but he had never mentioned it. Maybe he had never been with a man? But based on the Hogwarts rumor mill, he was pretty sure Draco was as pansexual as he was.
