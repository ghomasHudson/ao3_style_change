Potter's eyes widen. „And you think it was Andi? That's
I love them all.
to.“ He can't believe he's saying this. He can't believe he means it.
„Do you? Do you want me to?“
The smile Harry gives me is calming.
„I think you're very brave. Standing up for your brother like that takes some courage.“
„I mean she isn't as annoying anymore. And she's very good at making sweets.“ Harry takes a look at Draco's choice. „That's two sickles.“
I sigh and let Potter in. „What are you doing here? You ditched me earlier,“ I sign. I know I keep surprising him with how good I already am at BSL. Little does he know I spend more or less my whole workday secretly learning it. I'll take that secret to my grave. Let Potter think I'm just a natural.
„But you don't want to see me.“
„Scorpius wanted to show me his
„I don't know what you want me to pick,“ she says.
, maybe easier to bear. But – no. It was horrible. I don't think I'll ever -“
He won't believe another word out of Draco's mouth. Men lie. It's all they do.
I'll side-along him to my flat and we have sex. Then we'll sleep or we'll talk and then Harry will leave.
„Except live.“ Draco's voice breaks as he looks at Harry.
It's not quite morning yet when Draco wakes up. The nightsky is only just morphing from pitch black into a faint grey.
„Why not?“ I sign and I don't think he can really understand it, but he gets the sentiment.
„No way. No. We're not letting him near Teddy.“
He hesitates and I almost die. I don't want to be right.
„They'll probably all end up in a psych ward.“ Ron's voice sounds hollow.
„Then you should rest, I guess.“
“Do you want to fuck me? Is that it?“
„She didn't.
The waitress smiles at me. Her curly hair is falling to her shoulders, almost like a little cloud around her head. With her round, almost black eyes and the full lips, she's gorgeous.
But the Gryffindor seems to have other ideas. He hugs me hello and I'm panicking immediately.
„Alright, I'm coming in now.“
Harry groaned. „Don't ask. I have no idea.“ He looked at him. „What about you?“
Harry grins. „You wish.“
My father is looking at me with so much disgust in his eyes, it makes my knees go weak. But I won't back down.
„Let's just be adults about this.“ It feels like every word coming out of my mouth is wrong.
„Great. Then I'll make you some at my place.“
„'M really sorry,“ I get out, the bloke with the nice brown eyes glancing down at me as I wrestle my body into a sitting position, away from his hands. „Just... so drunk.“
„I hate that you scared,“ he says. „But I also love it. I thought...“ He cuts himself off. A small blush is rising on his cheek.
“Um, it's not urgent.“
“I've paid for the whole night, obviously.“
He quickly loses the timidness and starts working me properly, drawing long moans from my mouth. When he leans down to swallow them, I come, all over his fist.
I'm sitting in my car with Draco on the passenger's seat. He has his legs tucked under, facing me, head leaning heavily against the seat.
And now, he finds that he can't handle it.
Draco just snorts and Potter shakes his head.
Sometimes, I notice you looking at me and it makes me think that maybe, my very first guess has been right afterall. You want me. I've had so many men looking at me with that gleam in their eyes, there is no mistaking it.
„I mean it.“
„Your lines are getting old,“ Draco tells the cup. Derek is apparently running out of ideas to scare him. Draco doesn't even flinch anymore and he doesn't turn around.
I want to snarl at him.
With a dooming, sinking feeling, it clicks.
Ron makes a wounded noise.
Going against my first instinct – slinking away as fast as I could, praying he hadn't seen me – I approached him on quiet feet. He didn't see me, didn't hear me. His back turned to me.
„Don't ever call me sweet again.“
„I could help you,“ I say.
Even now, after all those years, I can't stop looking at you.
He looks at me, still disbelieving.
„Out, Malfoy,“ the owner spits before I can say anything.
Five times. I've old him five bloody times. But if he gets the letters (which I
The temptation is pulling at the strings of my heart. I do want it. But I know it would be a mistake. If I had it, I'd use it. And then I'd go to Azkaban and who's going to take my place if I do?
The first of December is always a special day to Harry because it's when he decorates his shop and puts up the huge advent calendar. Every day until Christmas Eve, the first child to visit the shop gets to open the little present for free.
„And are you speaking yet, honey?“ Hermoine asks, petting Lily's soft hair.
“What kind of stupid question is that?“ I hiss.
For the first time, he looks up. Not at me though, but at his wife.
„We didn't know about Remus, either.“
As much as Harry wants to function like a normal human being, he can't escape the thoughts. They mostly come at night.
Malfoy crosses his arms.
I still hope for an apology. Afterall, I really hoped he'd come.
“I changed my mind.“
“Take me for a ride?“ I murmur, fingers tracing his jaw.
„Yeah?“
Harry moans when I gently push him back and unbutton his trousers, slipping one hand inside to stroke his erection.
If he's dropping my name, I can drop his.
“Yeah.“
Just as Draco wants to move on, the print on the green shirt changes. The letters move and merge into something new until
„A year in Hogwarts during which she spent most time studying?“ I arch an eyebrow at him.
It's Hermoine who proves some days later how right Terry is with his assumption.
George's face is gaunt and the fingers around my wrist a little too strong for comfort.
“Mother, you need to eat something.“
„Yeah, I just... it's late,“ I sign, aware that my hands are fluttery, that I can't meet Draco's eyes.
„Is it okay, if I -?“
Harry is beyond words. All he can do is nod feverishly.
„You felt that way?“
Your voice is wrecked already and sweet desire is pooling in my belly.
„You like them?“ he asks and he sounds like his happiness depends on my answer.
I rim him until he comes rutting against the mattress. When I slide into him, all loose and relaxed, he sighs.
Of course, he loved Ron and Hermione and they loved him, too, but lately, he felt like the third wheel. They were in love and it was hard enough to get some alone time at the Burrow even without having Harry lurking around all the time.
„Don't fucking lie to me!“
„When you said if you could come over today, I didn't expect you to mean
Draco just nods.
„No, dinner sounds good.“
Sam and Pansy lock eyes. Unease is rapidly building in Pansy's chest, hovering closely on the verge of panic.
„Yes, obviously.“
He has a scar now, a pretty ugly, angry scar stretching from the left side of his jaw down over his neck, disappearing into his collar.
“Can I help you with something?“
The tip of my wand digs into his neck. Still, no one moves to stop me, even though I can hear whispers now, distressed and captivated by the scene I'm making.
„You too.“
“Rest now,“ I say.
„What is it, Pans?“ Blaise asks before Draco can, crossing his legs elegantly and sipping on his drink.
Harry shrugs. „Yeah, well. They've always worked well together.“
“Or hot chocolate?“
„That's love, Draco. I'm sure you know.“
Malfoy frowns.
“I just want to know if I have to pack my bags soon.”
I approach the bars. I want to reach through them and touch Draco's hand.
„Some people would call that shagging.“
Harry keeps looking at the floor.
„Not with a boy,“ he adds, biting his lip.
I'm already half-asleep when my son storms into my bedroom and jumps on my bed. „Jesus, Al.“
Archer beckons him closer until Harry suppresses a sigh and sits down, in front of the Auror's desk.
At the sight before me, my heart clenches.
„You'll know soon enough. Tomorrow, probably.“
„I don't know. I think I am, but I know I shouldn't be. So... yes and no.“
A tight heat coils in my belly and I open my mouth and start sucking him.
Potter looks at him funnily.
Granger certainly won't feel obligated to grant me asylum.
„I'm not good with kids. I don't like them much.“
„She strips, doesn't she?“
„Percy just said Malfoy and him have published his second book,“ Hermione signs, her eyes flickering between me and Draco.
They won't stop looking at me though and I turn my head away, blood rushing in my ears.
Suddenly, I remember the allure. The veela allure that caused Ron to make a complete fool out of himself in front of Fleur.
Panic is surging though my body, ice cold and bright. I've misread the situation. Now I'll pay for it.
„Have fun then.“
„No,“ he says. No need for clarification. The answer will stay the same in any case.
„Oh, shit. That's... I mean, good that she was able to abort. In her situation, having a child would have been horrible.“
„You don't have to leave,“ she says, then writes it with messy hands.
Ron's eyebrows almost disappear in his fringe and Ginny leans her hip against the counter, tilting her head.
„Oh Merlin, I love you, Harry. I love you I love you I love you.“ He can't stop saying it. I can't stop moaning.
“I'll look more closely into her condition. If she wakes up before the trial, I think we have a chance.“
The Gryffindor opens his mouth and bites his lip. Shifts his weight.
I shake my head, arms wrapped around my body in an attempt to calm myself. The empty flat isn't threatening, yet half of me doesn't seem to be here. Half of me is in front of my mother's flat, hidden behind dumpsters.
„We'll catch him soon. He won't get away,“ Harry says, putting as much conviction as he can muster in his voice.
I smile wryly. „It doesn't matter now anyway. He's with someone else.“
„The stunning curse Runcorn was hit by before the killer slit his throat?“
„I'll be too busy keeping from coming to laugh at you,“ I say.
„I'm fine.“
Slowly, I crouch down and pick it up.
„Don't move.“ My heartbeat is heavy in my throat. I lean in and take Draco's cock into my mouth.
Slowly, she straightens her limbs and gets up. Her legs are wobbly as she heads over to me and half collapses on the other side of the bars. My hand finds her cheek. I stroke it until she catches it and intertwines our fingers. I squeeze. Her skin feels like a Dementor's breath.
The liquor burns as it runs down my throat, but in a good way. I've always liked tequila, little slut that I am.
„Don't we all?“ Parkinson chimes in and I have to chuckle.
„What?“
„That was better than I expected.“
I tease him, licking at his hip bones, his thighs, pretending I wouldn't see the gorgeous cock begging for my attention.
„Can I see her?“ I ask numbly.
The warning is clear in Serpent's tone and I nod obediently.
„Nothing! Just that me being concerned you might not be serious, especially after dropping those shit statements, is valid!“
I find her in her bed, the window open, gasping for air.
„Maybe I will.“
„Maybe you want to... don't know, maybe play Quidditch with... with me. Or something.“
„Do you really want me to have dinner with you?“
„Yeah, because Connor was in polyjuice,“ Harry says through gritted teeth.
I shake my head. It's impossible to talk about something you don't really understand yourself. Something you don't dare even taking a quick glance at.
„You don't want her. Not like you want me.“
The Ferris Wheel might be the highlight – watching Draco watching London, cheeks tinged pink and blond hair slightly messy might just be my favorite sight.
Draco has been snapping at me all day and it took me a while until I realized that he's
Or almost. When Draco didn't respond, the Gryffindor had added: „Even though you're very welcome to join me when I shower. You don't even have to knock.“
„I'm scared of having kids,“ I say.
„Um...“
I'm really glad Blaise never used it against me. He could have, easily.
He's become an Auror to help, afterall. To do something important. To do what he's good at – taking down the bad guys.
Draco glares at him.
“After ten others, the last man was a little much. But I'm a whore so it's fine because it's my job. Satisfied?“
I do. Once, twice. Three times. I can feel the vice like grip of the panic loosen.
My given name rolling off her tongue is even more strange than her being here at all.
I feel stupid how I'm standing there, shopping bags in hand, fumbling for my keys.
But a faint blush appeared on Harry's face, so Draco was quite sure he'd heard him right.
„You like that?“ I murmur. „Me on my knees for you?“
„It's him.“
„I very much doubt he's been serious.“
“Hm?“
Pansy looks at her lap. „Alright. Anything else?“
Jack, my oldest student, graduates in July and my heart is singing. I'm so proud of him.
„Well, Ginny and I won't. Not
„It's okay. I'm okay with that,“ he says.
“I don't believe that.“
I lift my gaze, eyes boring into his. „We've been friends for years now, Harry. Pretty much since -“
„Yeah,“ I say.
„I'm flattered you believe I'm strong enough to put a spell on the Chosen One,“ I say, eyes on Weasley.
„Yeah. I know what you mean.“
“Do you want to go home?“ I ask him under my breath so the others won't hear.
Harry reaches for me, trying to take my hand. I pull it away as if he'd have burned me. I don't think I could bear touching him right now.
„I can take care of that.“
Weasley lifts his brows. „You can ban him anytime you want. You know that's up to you. None of my business.“
„Okay, but you're crazy.“
I definitely don't want to tell Harry that every time I so much as think about him leaving me, I feel like throwing up.
I nod.
„Relax, love. I'll make you feel so good, I promise.“
„You've never been with a guy at all?“ I ask, not able to stop myself from carressing his cheeks, feeling the slight stubble under the pads of my fingers.
The defendant is found not guilty. Fucking Julien is going to get away with it.
It's wrong. It's wrong wrong wrong but I don't care.
“You live here, too, now.“
The day is warm enough to be outside without a jacket, but no toot hot. No sweaty armpits – the perfect weather.
Draco thinks about it for a moment. He's not sure, really. He's used to Derek setting the pace and just following his lead and Derek had always wanted to get into it pretty quickly. No pun intended.
„I just miss him,“ Harry mumbles.
For a brief moment, Draco's eyes flick up, but then he resumes staring at his feet.
“Later today?“
I regret saying it the moment the words leave my mouth. Because I know, while this is something I sometimes think when I go to my darkest places, I have the suspicion that Harry really believes it.
When I go harder, he stops me.
I almost smile, that's how relieved I am. Relieved enough to let the
He makes a weird noise and holds me even tighter. A tear is slipping out of the corner of my eyes.
worse off than the offender. Draco needs to be aware that the chance of them blaming him, calling him a liar and worse, is high.“
I should have never let him kiss me.
„I mean, I can certainly think of many different reasons why one would dump you, but she always seemed very into your whole savior-complex.“
Hearing my godson scream in pain and not being able to do anything to help him ranks under the top five of the worst experiences of my life. It's as horrible as it was listening to Hermione's screams as Bellatrix tortured her, and I didn't think I'd ever experience something alike again.
My breath catches.
I open my eyes fully, bearing the light.
She does know. We both knew.
„What d'yer mean?“
„Mom asked me if Albus and I wanted to go on a trip with her.“
Albus rolls his eyes, his sympathy for me apparently already forgotten and then he drags Scorpius away from me.
I know I'm blushing. Heat is zipping through me.
„Malfoy?“
„We'll leave now,“ he says to Flint and grabs Draco's wrist. The blond goes rigid and the urge to smash Derek's face is surging up in Harry again.
With one swift motion, Harry sweeps Draco off his feet and into his arms, burying his face in the crook of Draco's neck. Draco breathes in Harry's intoxicating scent and holds on tight.
Either way, it doesn't matter anymore. Still, I feel almost relieved to finally understand it.
I hide my smile in his chest. „Sounds good to me.“
Already, he feels a little sick, heart speeding and speeding in his chest.
A sharp dagger stabs my chest. I hold him tighter against me, breathing through the jealousy. I know it's the veela, hightening this primal urge.
Harry gives me an assessing look.
on it as a murder weapon?
He swallows thickly. For the first time, I recognize that particular look in his silver eyes for what is: Fear.
The Gryffindor rolls his eyes.
„You look atrocious.“
“You always seemed rather close in Hogwarts.“
As Hermione tells us about her short-lived romance with Viktor Krum, we're all laughing. Tequila is burning in my stomach. My knee is pressing against Harry's.
But Ncuti has never cared about that and he doesn't now, either.
I've only walked about half a mile from the apparition point over to Malfoy's house, but I'm frozen to my bones. Frozen and out of my mind.
“Didn't mean to startle you. It's time for a little check-up. If you'd wait outside, please?“
Ron seems to feel guilty.
„Hey, Potter.“
„You're Flint,“ Harry says. Who else could it be?
Ginny follows me.
„Because the timeline matches. The time he first got successful with his team has also been the time when the first cases of Ipo abuse dropped in here.“
Leaning into each other, we walk the rest of the way to his flat. In front of it, the last thing I want to do is say goodybe. I just want to come inside with him, make him curl around me and fall asleep in his arms. Wake him up with a blow job. Make him breakfast.
She lifts her chin. „Potter. Thank you for seeing me.“
I kiss his shoulder blades and start searching for that sweet spot. The moment I find it is made very obvious by the shout Draco lets out. „Oh my God.“
„Of course,“ I say, my voice tinged with a hint of annoyance. „I'm professional.“
„We'll see about that,“ Draco signs, small smile on his lips.
I know I'm being selfish. I just want things to be like they used to. Just some.
„So what are you saying, Harry? That we don't see each other anymore?“
„Didn't know you were such a punk, Draco.“ Harry grins and takes the bottle from Pansy, then passes it to me. I take a generous swig. Warmth is starting to spread in my belly, laughter bubbles in my chest.
Stunned silence fills the room.
But I won't do that. I'm rather sure I can't hurt him.
“You're crazy.“
„What do you think why he kept coming at you in school?“
The Slytherin pulls his briefcase onto the table, not even looking at me while he's opening it.
Harry almost drops his quill.
Before Draco can come up with anything else to say, she has left.
I let him lick into my mouth, moaning. It feels like he's claiming me and all my morals, all my shame, are sent flying out of the window under the hot pressure of his tongue.
“It's our flat, Ron. And it's not like he's sleeping in your bed.“
„Draco?“
He kisses me and I wrap my arms around his neck, tightly. His hands are on my waist, one slipping to my lower back. When I open my mouth, he groans, pulling me tighter. I can feel his erection pressing against my belly and push against it.
Draco swallows. Shakes his head.
I know Hermione would have a lot to say about that, but right now, I merely find it annoying.
My friend kicks off his shoes. „Look, if you want to try again, go ahead. But nothing's changed, Harry. He doesn't want to see you. He doesn't really want to see anyone.“
He's insane for still being so nice to me. I've been nothing but an arsehole toward him. Plus, of course, I'm a whore. Not really someone to deserve niceties.
“Alright.“
Honestly, Draco is very sure that wouldn't be nearly as weird as eating with Potter.
I only have a black one, but I guess that would do.
“You’re still mad at me?” Harry asks.
It takes less than a minute for him to make me come like this, sucking me and working his fingers.
Harry's brows rise.
I move back up and kiss his lips again. Then I nip at his bottom lip.
It takes me a lot not to set his desk on fire.
„Why would Malfoy hate Runcorn?“ I repeat.
„We weren't
Lit only by the faint moonlight shining through the window, Draco props himself up. His eyes are huge grey orbs. Smoke instead of storm today.
Ron snorts and reaches for a bowl of peanuts, almost empty. „He's out there either way.“
Blaise opens his mouth, then closes it again. He knows Draco's right.
„I have work of my own,“ I say. My free days are very limited and do I really want to spend them on a business trip with Cole?
He should've known.
that suggests he disagrees.
„Can I help you with something?“ I ask.
But in the end, he doesn't do anything. Just waits and stares.
I get up and look out of the window, my back turned to Harry.
Draco rolls his eyes and looks away, but he can't hide the blush on his cheeks.
As I feel the familiar pull of apparition, my mind collapses and everything is fading into darkness.
„Not like this. Please?“ Draco's looking up at Harry, anxiety coming off of him in waves, he knows that and he knows he's ruining the mood again and he doesn't want to, but he can't help it.
Draco's eyes narrow.
When I tell Draco about this line of thinking later that day, snuggled up on the sofa, his back against my chest, he turns around and looks at me out of sober eyes.
One tear. She lets one tear slip. „Always.“
„One Japanese Lover, if you have it.“
But Ginny put her foot down when she first fell for a girl – halfway, at least. It didn't last long, but it made her realize how impossible she and I were. So she broke it off.
They sit in silence, holding hands and sharing a bottle, until the sun rises.
„I liked you throwing yourself at me. And I only turned you down that one time because, well. I didn't think you'd actually want to and I also thought it would complicate things. Which it did.“
„If you have no comparison, it's kinda hard to tell,“ I explain.
„I mean, I didn't ask him for fucking marriage. But I'm not into, you know, open relationships and stuff.“
When I touch you, you moan. It's my new favourite sound. I didn't know it before.
I blink, pulling back a little more to be able to think clearly again and make sense of Draco's stammering.
I'm strolling listlessly through the aisles, my gaze wandering over a huge assortment of book covers, when I notice my son talking to another boy. At first glance, I'd think he's younger than Albus. Skinny and tiny with a head of platinum blond hair.
We don't talk about Harry a lot. I'm honestly not quite sure what she thinks of us, which is unusual. She doesn't hate it, obviously, but beyond that... I don't know.
„Me neither.“
Still, I need to make a decision which one I like best.
Draco only nods at me.
I know it's bad when I find myself asking Ron and Hermoine about Draco.
It takes you some time to work up the courage to also tell me that you don't want me to go back to selling myself.
“I should go,“ I say and drain my chocolate.
„I know it's unnecessary luxury, but I really want to have this peacock feather quill,“ she tells me.
He doesn't stay longer than twenty minutes, but before he leaves, he says, blue eyes incredibly tired: „I'm really sorry, Ferret. I know she means a lot to you.“
„Unhappily so.“ I press a kiss to his hairline and I think he sighs.
My mouth falls open, my eyes wide as saucers, as I find myself nose to nose with Draco Malfoy. A very
„Maybe you shouldn't always look for the fault on your end,“ I say, kneeding his shoulders, sliding my hands up his neck. „Maybe she's making it hard, too.“
„What the hell?“
He snivels, but can't stop the blood that starts trickling out of his nose. He turns away and rips some paper towels from the dispenser on the wall, pressing them to his nose.
I almost drop Draco, but then we're there and I slip out of the Dementor's reach.
“Bless you,“ someone says.
I talk to the inhabitants of the shelter and while I often have to reign in my disgust for the people I meet there, sometimes – sometimes, I hear stories that make my blood run cold.
„It's not like there weren't enough reasons why you belong there,“ Ron says.
So maybe that's the reason why he usually doesn't touch. Or maybe he simply doesn't want to be sexualized – or perhaps he even thinks
I let go of the bars.
I don't know what she means with that.
But I thought we've managed to move past that. It's been... three weeks? I thought we were fine.
„Is it Derek?“
I give him a long look, then reach over him and pull the blanket up, tucking him in.
I fully intend to beeline to the gates and then leave him to it, but a pale hand catches my wrist. „Harry, wait.“
I follow her into the flat. It's rather large, with a big, open living room and a modern kitchen that I'm sure Pansy never uses.
Hermione walks in on me way too early in the morning. I've tumbled into bed only two hours ago and my whole body is sticky and
„I've never had a crush on Malfoy.“
Harry's jaw drops. An incrediulous smile spreads on his face.
„Do you? Pray tell.“
But I'm not going to refuse a free dinner.
I tell it to shut its stupid mouth. I've been fucked by the most disgusting men. It's ridiculous that I'm squirming now at the thought of you inside me. I've wanted that for so long. Dreamed about it.
I bite my lip and look down.
Harry can't understand why he'd prefer if he wasn't.
„Impressive endurance.“
Draco is paler. He looks like a ghost.
“Now I get why you were so admant he doesn't go see his mother alone.“
“Yes.“
“Yes, please.“
Adrian Rogers is standing not that far from Harry and Draco, talking to a woman. They're standing really close and Draco nudges Harry.
„Fuck.“
He walks in, shaggy hair, tired eyes.
The guard behind us clears his throat. I want to hex him into oblivion.
My suspicion hardens when George says: “No, it has to be him. When can I see him again?“
I arch a brow. „So you're saying you still love Ginny?“
He arches an eyebrow at me. „There is still an hour of my shift left.“
“And you're a drooling addict that visits Knockturn whorehouses,“ he says.
Draco hesitates. He's not sure Harry would like for the whole team to know.
“I can't go home. I have to be here when she wakes up.“
„What?“
„Oh, you two have fun,“ Draco says, pouting.
I swallow. „I'm sorry.“
The film is a little stupid, but I don’t pay attention anyway.
Our worlds aren't intertwined anymore like they used to be. They hardly even touch.
He's sitting hunched over, folded into a corner. His head is hanging down, blond, messy hair covering his face.
Draco's pale eyes seem to pin Harry's down. „Is that why it didn't work out with you and the – with you and Ginevra? Because you didn't want to have kids?“
Weasley shifts his weight.
I manage to sneak out of the flat without waking Ron – or at least I dearly hope I do.
Hermione avoids my gaze. I'm sure she remembers what she told me (and Draco and Pansy, of all people) only two days ago.
When Harry gets back to Grimmauld Place in the evening, he pretends he's not nervous. Or unsettled.
journey.
„Is it true that you've fancied Hermoine?“ Harry asks Zabini, the liquor making him bold in his desperate attempt to distract from his own fixation on the blond boy next to him.
Instead, I just lean down and kiss him once more, rays of sunlight highlighting our flushed faces and puffy eyes.
„I mean, why did she say that? Why then? Why did she want me to know?“
„You're not just saying that because you want me to fuck you, right?“
“All good, Ferret?“ Weasley asks me.
“Aquaria, what...“
Harry slips inside the room, closing the door behind me. His smile is easy and warm, as if we'd be meeting at the Leaky. But I'm overcome by a fresh surge of shame. Humiliation.
Harry nods. At least they all made it out alive.
„Good,“ Ron says, bringing me back to reality.
“I count on it.“
His gaze flickers. „Sorry. But... you
Now, he sounds like he really thought about it, analyzed it even. And moved on.
„Are you sure you can't take Draco?“ I'm being a lousy friend, I know. For once, Ron has plans, and here I am, begging him not to make me bring Draco to Azkaban.
I rub my face, exhausted. „Right. But – see? That's what I'm talking about.“
Of course it doesn't. You're always the exception.
„Are you free tomorrow then?“
Julien's eyes are black and angry. So angry.
I wonder whether my fingers show the same light sarcasm my voice would have carried. My face certainly does.
Pansy is so much shorter than me. As my arms close around her body, I notice that it's softer than it used to be. Her curves are back. Her shoulders aren't bony enough to sting anymore and her collarbones not much more than a shadow.
I run until the house disappears behind a hill. Then, I drop to my knees, wetness soaking my jeans in seconds. I fall forward onto my hands, fingers blue. My head is swimming.
„Would you like a drink?“ she asks. „I certainly need one.“
I glance at the tray, already drooling.
Harry just shakes his head again and drains his glass. „Do you?“ he asks. „Want kids, I mean.“
„We'll do what they suggest. Find someone else.“
„That's Harry. We're working together,“ Sam says to her, then turns to Harry.
He closes his eyes.
Harry smiles at him though. „Sure. Come here.“
He settles on my lap and at the press of his naked skin, my cock is quickly rising.
It belongs to an elderly witch with grey hair, an impressive bosom and lipstick on her teeth.
They both look tired. I want to smooth out the line around Malfoy's mouth.
„How was your talk with Brighton?“ I ask him, hand lingering on his elbow. Draco pushes it away. Takes it in mine. I think some people are staring, but I don't care.
„They wouldn't have to know.“
The Slytherin looks at me sideways. I just look at Dawson.
of willpower to reign it in. Let Weasley see that I'm actually wary.
I take a deep breath.
„I write,“ he finally says.
„Alright, Potter.“
The smile Harry gives him makes Draco weak in the knees. Harry looks happy.
Rons steps closer to me, his eyes big.
I nod.
He's ashamed.
Draco smiles at me and scoots closer.
„He's been recommended to my by St. Florence. I've looked into them, as you said, and his name kept coming up.“
This is not the time for long foreplay, for teasing and petting, even though I love all of that.
Ginny blinks at me, bleary-eyed, her short hair sticking up to all sides.
„Any particular reason for that statement?“
I blame it on him. On us. We're somehow inevitable.
„Oh, and, to be honest – I wouldn't tell mom and dad unless you're sure it's serious.“
„I'm not hungry!“
„What happened to him?“
They're silent for a moment, then Harry asks, gently: „I take it your family wasn't... very accepting?“
„What is it?“
When our drinks are empty, he orders another two. In the following two hours, I learn that Brighton is a good listener and has a intriguing sense of humor, subtle and a bit weird, which I like. He has two younger sisters and is two years older than I am. I try for a bit of banter, but quickly realize that I offend Brighton with my little jabs.
„I hope I don't have to explicitely tell you that you're obviously not going to kill anyone.“
„I got to, um...“
He's quiet. I lick his thighs and hope he can't sense my nerves. I push them away.
„What do you think about this weekend?“ I ask her, Albus already dragging Scorpius up to his room.
„But Otis said he's seen some of the important guys around.“
He hides his eyes and takes some measured breaths.
I crawl into bed next to him, snuggling to his chest.
“I am sorry for running off like I did. You should know, I would love to give you what you want, to go meet your friends and be your date. But you have to realize, Harry. They
Dazed green eyes find my face. Alcohol is dimming their light a bit.
No visitors are allowed at Weasley's trial. I'm honestly not sure how that makes sense – why everyone who felt inclined could watch me getting taken apart on the stand, having to spill the ugliness of my rape all over the cold stones, but no one is allowed to watch an Auror getting taken a crack at.
Draco looks at me. His eyes are so sad, they almost make me cry. I can practically see him searching for the right answer, his mind too foggy to find it.
I stare at him.
In the morning, we're both exhausted. Draco looks like he just ran a marathon and I plan to send him straight back to bed when a patronus bursts into the living room.
„Draco, let's -“
„Yes. Goodbye, Potter.“
“How was your talk with Robards?“ Draco asks Ron.
When I get home, Draco is in the kitchen, cooking. I stand in the doorframe and stare at him. He's so tall. So bloody handsome in his fitted jeans and casual jumper.
I can see the pulse thrumming in Potter's neck. He looks more vulnerable than I ever seen him.
I don't look at him.
Granger looks at me.
„Go arrest some other junkie. Hell knows there are enough of us out there.“
And yet I don't think I like her very much.
My eyes widen and I stare into his face.
“No. Please.”
But what can I say?
He pulls me up and I go with him willingly. I'm surprised when he kisses me (my mouth tastes like cum, afterall) and I'm surprised how much I like that he does.
„I'm a whore though.“
„How would I have known, Draco? You never say anything.“
„Yes. Did you expect anything else?“
„Hi.“
Harry rolls his eyes. „Thanks, Gin.“
Ron's brows lift. „Should I be worried, mate?“
The bloke steps closer. Harry turns his head away, but doesn't run. Doesn't even snap at the bloke.
A smile flickers over Draco's lips. Then stays.
I sink to my knees, heartbeat too fast. When I pull his pants down, Potter stops breathing.
“May I leave now, sir? I need to be with my mother.“
She sits on the edge, knees together, spine straight as a board.
I pull back a little, my hands still fisted into his shirt.
He looks at his hands – elegant and long-fingered.
“I don't need your money.“
Harry startles at the untypical curse. „I am not doing this right now. I'm staying, Harry. I'm staying and you will tell me what the fuck is going on.“
Sometime between me processing that he's actually shown up and that processing that I haven't eaten in so long that I'm getting stomach cramps now, I say: „I think I'm seriously fucked up.“
“Malfoy.“
„It's nothing,“ he says, looking at her.
Unseen, I make it to the Leaky.
There is a lot of hurt and angst in this chapter - I'm really sorry!
„Harry?“
„It must get tiring sometimes,“ Draco says, leaning forward.
Before Samantha can answer, Draco turns to Terry.
„Potter.“ I didn't expect him here. We don't really meet at the club anymore.
My tongue slips into his mouth and he opens it obediently. I'm rock-hard, pushing against him, my hand stroking all over his body, slipping under his shirt. When his hands find my fly, I'm afraid I might come from the first touch of his fingers on my cock.
I remember he's scared of small spaces. Now I know why.
„I – no.“
I nod before he's even done talking. „Yeah. Sure.“ I look around. „I can get fresh sheets for Al's bed. You could sleep in the guest room.“
„I don't think I should give you more Dreamless, Potter,“ he says.
Another look from Robards. „You are dismissed.“
„I... just need some space. For now.“ With that, Potter is gone, leaving the rest of them in awkward silence.
„Is everything alright?“ My voice is just a tiny bit shaky.
„I am with her. But that doesn't mean we can't be friends, does it?“
Draco rolls his eyes.
Something powerful surges through me and I pull the Gryffindor tighter to my chest. He stirs, maybe because of the morning light coming through the window, maybe because of my hands.
„I mean... I think everyone's different, right? And that's good. It's fine to go for guys who seem a little more typically masculine. Just as it's fine to go for very feminine presenting men. Whatever you're into, right?“
„It doesn't matter. They will, with or without my help.“
, however horrid that sounds. We're a bit awkward about the whole thing, but in the end, pushing inside you is heaven. When you fuck me afterward, you lock our fingers and I die for you. I always have.
I lean my back against the door, my vision kind of blurry.
„He'll heal,“ I say.
„Are you alright?“
„Whatever, slut,“ he says and pushes me back onto the bed.
The flat is quiet when Harry and I arrive, carelessly leaving our shoes in the doorway.
. Even Neville's already asking about you.“
Harry's eyes sparkle as I nod and push a cup of steaming tea into his direction. Before I lift my own, I roll my stiff neck.
As for Zabini, he's still quite close with Malfoy, at least as far as Harry is informed, so he's probably wondering why he didn't know that Malfoy would show up in their office today.
Ron leans forward on his elbows.
„Winter hols? He's not in Hogwarts yet, is he?“
Completely unexpectedly, I learned that Draco doesn't like PDA at all. Whenever we have friends over (which is not that often), even if it's only Ron, he will hardly touch me and if he does, he usually keeps it to a strictly friendly way. I really think Ron has only seen us snuggle once, and that was when Draco was quite pissed.
Maybe I really am dreaming.
But Harry wants this. Maybe even needs it. He wants Draco Malfoy to belong to him.
„Do you recognize that?“ Ncuti asks.
He studies my face.
Cautiously, I ease out of him, but he winces anyway.
He holds my gaze for a long time.
Sometimes, we transfigure paper into muggle money and buy food that way. It works quite well – only that, under closer inspection, it's obvious the money is fake, meaning one shouldn't frequent the same shop too often.
„I'm ashamed.“
Something ugly is fouling my skin. It feels like mold would be spreading over my face. „Is that your answer?“
„It wasn't for me.“
The glare Potter sends my way is surprisingly dark.
We've reached the end!
Pansy flips me off, but she's smiling.
“I want more than just that. I want – I like you.“
„I'm glad I can help. For real.“ His eyes on me make me uneasy and I have to turn away.
Harry sighs.
„So should you.“
„I'm not sure when Potter comes back. But I'm starving though.“ She heads to the stairs and I follow her dumbly – until we actually reach it.
While I'm busy mixing two Gin Tonics, Draco approaches me on socked feet. He really is a bit like a cat, the way he always sneaks up on people.
Potter looks at me for another long moment. His face betrays no emotion. Which is more than a little disconcerting. He can never keep it under wraps. Usually.
„Lucius Malfoy is in Azkaban. Still there. Or isn't he?“ Harry's heart is pounding.
„I don't want to... I like...“ I can't finish the sentence.
Harry grins, so incredibly smug.
Now though... I'm not sure.
When Draco is doing the walk of shame the next day, I'm not sure how I should be acting.
Your smile could light up the moon.
Flint leans forward, pressing against the bars. „Look, if you found Malfoy's signature on Runcorn – why are you coming after me? I didn't kill that bastard. I was fully planning on never hearing from him again.“
„I love you,“ he says and then he kisses Draco so he won't have to answer.
Harry says it's a good thing. If Kingsley wants to keep things official, but private, that might mean he doesn't want the press to blow it out of proportion.
„Why are you sitting here?“
Ron frowns at me. „She got out two months ago. I think she's now under house arrest somewhere in France. Why?“
„Does Ron know?“
Potter blinks. He almost looks like a kicked puppy. „Oh. Okay.“ He makes to stand.
My friends, who all know me so well, can see through it, even though Ron has already complained that it hurts his eyes.
I grin. „Good.“
Harry smiles at me and his smiles are dangerous. They always remind me of before. Of how he used to get to me.
„I'm sleeping in your bed.“
I'm halfway up the stairs to my shitty apartment when I'm startled by a door opening. The apartment on the first floor has been deserted since the old lady occupying it died two months ago, leaving nothing behind but a distinct smell of catfood lingering in the hallway.
Andromeda doesn't honour that with an answer, just keeps on flipping through her magazine, legs tucked up on the sofa.
Malfoy narrows his eyes at me. „Watch it, Potter.“
Malfoy swallows and lifts his chin. The right half of his face is full of purple bruises. By the way he's distributing his weight, leaning heavily on his left leg, I assume he's limping.
Harry looks up. He looks into Draco's eyes. Draco doesn't move.
We're sitting at my kitchen table.
But still, sometimes I get uneasy. I don't know why.
Harry kisses my lips, my chin, my cheekbones.
So am I, but what does it matter? I shrug lightly and wish the room would stop spinning.
Malfoy looks to the side again, right hand slowly stroking over his left forearm. The forearm with the mark.
„Why do you even care? Wasn't I just a little experiement for you?“
“I am sorry,“ Malfoy finally says. “For a lot things. My attitude toward you, my blindness. All the times I hurt you and your friends.“
„I really like you, Draco Malfoy. I really, really like you.“
I'm reading without ever looking up.
„I just – I
Scorpius snickers a little and exchanges a look with his mother.
Potter's dark brows knit together, his eyes fiery. „He'll hurt him. It's all he does. We don't need him.“
I take my time looking and it makes Harry blush. I don't know why. He's so perfect. So absolutely gorgeous in every way.
I'm halfway through my first portion when Draco says:
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
I don't miss the glance Astoria casts me – even though I'm looking at Draco. He's staring at me until our eyes meet. That's when he swiftly averts his eyes.
Harry reaches out, touches her shoulder tentatively. Sam laughs, a watery sound, and wipes the tears away. „Merlin, I'm sorry.“
„Not completely, but she very likely wouldn't have the same career she could have without children. I mean, honestly – would you stay at home so she can go to work?“
That makes Ron and Harry laugh and Draco looks endearingly confused.
„Okay.“ Draco doesn't look at Harry, rather walks to the sink and fills a glass with ice-cold water.
„Shut your mouth, Blaise,“ Pansy says.
. Malfoys are not
„Hey.“
„That must be tough for you.“
„Okay, Potter. You got me confused. Even you, I wouldn't have thought foolish enough to enjoy sitting in cold hallways smelling of catfood. Apparently, I've undererstimated you.“
„Should I – can I?“ His hand is on my pants, somehow eager and shy at the same time.
„Thank you so much.“
„I do. Come on. It'll be fun.“
He does, without much elegance. Almost falling in his hurry to get to me.
He kisses me one more time. „I'll see you around.“
But it doesn't feel like it. Not when I watch Teddy getting stronger, then watch Harry watching his godson with a vibrant smile on his face.
Hermione and Luna are the ones who save us all from too much awkwardness. I'm deeply grateful that they apparently decide in a split second to treat Draco like anyone else and forget about the schooldays. They're doing it for me and it warms my heart.
I look away. „It's not like that.“
The fingers grip my chin so tightly now that I gasp.
Draco charges at Derek and Harry jumps to help him. A curse shoots out of Derek's wand, but Draco bends his hand away from them. Harry gives into the urge and lands one right in Derek's face, sending the man to the ground.
She looks away.
“Have you... had boyfriends before?“ I ask him.
The ginger turns to Draco, holding out a little box filled with grey powder, rougher and less glittery than Dreamscales.
„Do you know who?“
Andromeda takes a deep breath.
I clench my fist and try not to lose it. My magic is flaring, crackling on my skin.
He turns his head away.
„Why was she pissed?“
I feel myself smile in return.
Things don't go as planned.
When Harry pads into the kitchen on bare feet, wearing his ratty sweatpants and one of my shirts that is too small for him, stretched tight over his biceps, I instantly feel warmer.
Ron grins at us and the lines around his mouth are not to oversee.
My heart is racing as I dash out of the flat, probably looking like an absolute maniac.
I count to ten.
“Neither can I, Draco.“
Flint's eyes flicker to Derek.
„Oh. No. Of course not. Exclusivity works both ways.“
That's when Ron chooses to open the door. Both him and Hermione freeze for a split second.
Draco swallows thickly. For a moment, he's the same bratty, insecure little boy I remember from school. From Azkaban, even.
„I needed to see you. Can we talk?“
Harry is close now, Draco can tell. He starts breathing through his nose deliberately, determined to swallow everything and not make a mess. Harry tilts his head back, mouth open, brows drawn.
He looks away, into the distance. His right hand slowly runs over his left forearm.
„Draco, what happened?“
„Scorpius is really cool,“ Al tells me at dinner and if I'd believe in fate, I'd wonder why it's doing this to me.
I'm so stupid. How could I not have thought of that?
I was just surprised.
Pansy blinks then flaps her hand and laughs a little. „Oh, no. That's fine, we've been over forever ago. Blaise is... an interesting mind and dead sexy, but he's not for me.“
I almost laugh and smile up and him widely. „Yes, please.“
I just give him a vague smile for a thanks. My hands are cupping the mug, trying to soak up the warmth. The rich, sweet smell almost makes me dizzy.
But he still didn't want to come back.
He doesn't touch me, but my heartbeat is kicking anyway. He bought me. At the club.
I'm not sure how serious he is.
“Hey,“ I say, getting up.
„Watch out!“
I hesitate. Just look at him. „I just really miss being able to hear,“ I sign and I don't think he understood it, not with the new sign I used or my messy movements.
By now, I honestly believe that you hardly ever know anyone. Not even yourself.
Two weeks ago, Draco's question would've made Harry fall silent.
kids?“
„Hi, Harry.“ I'm sure he can see my heart beating.
Ginny looks pretty in her tight jeans and cozy sweater and yet, it doesn't do anything for me. But I do notice that she's throwing me looks. And smiles.
He's tired of people using him.
. No one forced you to do that. You did it on your own.“
„Why?“
My heart is pounding ridiculously fast as I prepare her coffee and, after a pathetically long moment of indecision, put a large piece of cheese cake on one of our small, dainty plates.
„Hey.“
My gaze snaps up.
„Until later, love.“
„I want to be alone,“ I say.
Robards closes his eyes for a short moment. Some of the many papers on his desks flutter.
His legs are opened to the side, his throat bared for me and as sexy as he looks like this, I want to see his face.
But then, not showing didn't really feel like an option. So here he is.
„It's not a very good hide, I know. But I couldn't think of anything better,“ he says.
I smile at her, hoping she doesn't mistake my nerves for hostility.
Ron grins. „Oh, I do. And they will be. I'm not planning on having just one though. Maybe my youngest and your oldest will become besties.“
„Harry, I'd like to talk about your childhood a little next session.“
„That doesn't mean you're going to be heartbroken when he finally has enough of your cock? Because I think it means exactly that.“
“Wow. We're fucking good at this.“
Paranoid as I am, I could swear they're all talking about me. A boy with curly hair and eyeshadow that glitters in the light is flirting with Thomas, which has Finnigan basically spitting fire. I'm grateful, because it distracts the others from my presence.
. Because you're afraid how it will reflect on me. How do you think it's going to be with Potter?“
Weeks passed.
Harry's throat clenches.
„Stop worrying about me, Harry.“
„Ron, Hermione. I need you to take Andi home.“
„He confessed,“ I say.
„What?“ I feel gutted. And stupid.
Malfoy clears his throat and shifts in his seat. His silver-blond hair has grown and is now brushing his sharp jawline, falling to his shoulders and hiding his face quite effectively. He pushes it behind his ears before starting to speak.
I hesitate once more. This is a bad idea. But do I even have a choice?
I take another bite, mostly so I won't have to say any more. When I've swallowed, I say: „Let's just talk to Flint and then decide.“
“Why would I be mad at you, love?”
I come from just thinking about him.
But hanging out with Potter and the Weasel plus girlfriend? Not his idea of a relaxed evening.
„Of course. My apologies.“
Andromeda seems to read my thoughts.
After the last night Sam spent at Pansy's place, Pansy had been hopeful. She'd grinned at Sam when she saw her at work the next day and Sam had grinned back. It had felt secret, like the grin had only been for Pansy. Her heart had been pounding in her chest and she'd tried to reign in the butterflies in her stomach.
I start slow on his neck and shoulders. His surprised, pleased little sigh goes straight to my chest. I'm working my fingers into the hard, knotted muscles of his back, up and down his spine, as far as I can comfortably reach.
I don't turn around. My cheek stings with shame. Humiliation.
„Then why?“ Draco asks, voice small.
„I guess, I... I can't just be friends. Right now. Because it... fucking hurts.“
„Only if that's really okay.“
I nod.
There hasn't been any hint of the She-Weasel soon popping out some brats of her own, but it is understood that that's only a matter of time.
„What are you doing here?“
„Hold out your arm, please.“
Hands are pulling on my hips, urging me up on all fours. I'm shaking so much already. Malfoy is stroking my flanks, his hands finding the slender curve of my arse. He's pulling my cheeks apart and looks. Under his gaze on the most private part of my body, I almost pull away and curl into a ball.
He looks... good. His skin is glowing like I haven't seen it ever before. The dark circles under his eyes are significantly less pronounced.
I've had him in my hand yesterday, but I couldn't see. Now I can.
„Yeah.“
Draco is standing on his doorstep and Harry has never seen him like this.
His sick mother. The main reason why he's allowing strangers to abuse his body and his soul.
“We need someone smart in the house,“ I say, just barely keeping myself from adding
Draco looks back into those eyes that he adores so much, it sometimes hurts to look at them.
„Anytime.“
„I'm sorry,“ I say, pushing him away. „I drank too much.“
„Okay, what is up with you? You're glowing,“ Pansy tells Draco as he continues smiling while helping her chop up carrots for the vegetable curry they're cooking.
Draco glances at him.
„No, I mean – in kissing. Because I won't sleep with you.“
„Yeah. I probably should.“
Lydia nods. Stays silent.
„That would be nice,“ the Slytherin says.
„Call your friends,“ she says. „The more the merrier, right?“
I want him to be happy. I want to be there for him.
I nod. I don't need to tell her that I don't really believe anyone will be able to heal Teddy if St. Mungo's can't. They have a splendid reputation in Europe and our healers are certainly among the best worldwide. The German healthcare system might be a lot more social than ours, with larger capacities, but if it comes to the competence of the healers, I wouldn't know where else to look.
We're both breathing heavily. My brain feels fried.
Harry's finger tug at my shirt, pull it out of my waistband, so that he can slip his hands underneath, touch my heated skin.
He makes it sound like a horrible confession.
„He did. Unlike you, I really did my research. He lived on the streets for two months after his trials.“
He looks at me in alarm.
He comes closer and wraps his arms around Harry's neck. „It was good. Wasn't it?“
„What? Sorry, I just needed to check that real quick.“
My gaze wanders from Ron to my visitors.
His hands tighten even further. His eyes search mine.
I look at her and, for the first time, I realize how kind Hermione is. Bossy, a smart-arse and always needing to be right. But also kind and very compassionate.
„Lash out how?“
He decided to walk so he could grab a coffee on his way. Real coffee, not the plonk they're dishing out at the Ministry. On his way to the toilets (the entry to the Atrium), he takes another sip – and stops dead, staring at his cup.
„Good morning.“
„As I said. Ten sickles.“
Ron drains his mug of rather disgusting Ministry coffee. „Honestly, mate, I don't give a flying fuck about what Malfoy's up to. For all I care, he can go piss off into one of Daddy's secret hideouts and never show his ugly face again.“
And while she did that, I started visiting Draco in Azkaban. At first, because I felt guilty. Then because I felt curious.
I wait for her to go on. When she looks at me, her eyes are basically boring into me. It's hard to hold her gaze, but I manage.
Malfoy lines himself up, one hand on the small of my back, soothing.
while wanking in the bloody shower, that's for sure.“
I flinch. I really don't know anymore what kind of guy I am.
On two of those dates, Harry had gotten to take Draco home and knows now for sure that no one in the world can give better blowjobs than Draco Malfoy. He also knows that Draco is shy about sex and that his pale skin flushes when he's aroused. He knows that Draco likes to nip at Harry's bottom lip and that it turns him on when Harry leaves love bites on his skin.
Pushing some stray shirts out of the way, I sit down next to Draco and kiss his upturned lips.
But we're not. And I don't want to be. Not anymore.
cleaning. He gets anxious when he does it.
Blaise hesitates.
„Did she? Good. So, are you coming?“
„I'd be bored throughout the day,“ I say, even though I'm perfectly capable of enjoying myself on my own.
„Afraid not.“
Even though I think Draco got it all wrong.
They all look at me.
It makes him
Malfoy grins and dazes a Snitch with a flick of his wand, keeping it from exhausting itself by trying to lift the heavy metal box off the shelf.
Men not letting me out of their (metaphorically speaking) bed are often dangerous.
Then she sobers again.
“Right. You paid.“
of your lying arse, I -“
„Yeah. I do.“
When doesn't say anything else, I say: „It's nice to see you.“
„Are you serious about her?“ I ask.
With that, Weasley turns around and heads toward the kitchen.
Draco smiles. He's soft like this. Not so unbothered.
„Of course. Do you want to sleep in my guest room, or...?“
I think about it. Count.
I open my eyes again.
He slips off the counter.
„Cheers.“
„Show me, then.“
I shake my head.
Sam looks at her. „Can I stay here for a while? I really need someone to talk to.“
A hot meal would be nice as well, but that's not really on the cards tonight. Or most nights.
„Good. You probably haven't seen Draco?“
When Draco's thighs are starting to shake from the effort, Harry helps with his hands on Draco and starts thrusting up to meet him.
Sam is all over them the second they step back into the office.
“I told them because I needed to talk about it, I guess. It... was affecting me.“
I look back to Harry, whose eyes had been darting between me and Granger.
, of course. Hermione's eyes have been grey orbs of uselessness for almost two years now.
„I'm just kidding,“ I say, looking at her still face. „I should buy him flowers instead. Or some diamonds or a new broom. I've been so horrible to him, Pans. Even by my standards. I'm always yelling at him, because he keeps trying to console me, but he doesn't get it. How could he console me when you're here, in this fucking bed and you can't talk to me?“
Now I avert my gaze. „You better get going.“
„Nice to finally meet you, Granger,“ Pansy says.
„I'll see you tomorrow.“
I'm not going to refuse you.
„I think... I've always known. From when I first started to think about, you know, sex and all that. But I didn't want to admit it, even to myself. I've spent a lot of time praying the gay away, I'd say.“
But Pansy doesn't have anyone but me and we love each other, so she comes around pretty quickly.
Draco's breath catches in his throat. Harry's fingers trail over his face.
„And Weasley was mad because he also is still in love with Granger, but spent most of his time over the last year to forget her?“
First, I want to flip you off. Or say something sarcastic. But your eyes are so open that I can't.
„I don't think we do,“ he whispers back.
I land in the yard, only barely catching myself before I fall, slowly regaining my balance. My chest is heaving, a scream forming in my throat. I stare at the front door, then turn and head past the house, my steps getting faster until I'm running, into the fields behind the building, leaving footsteps in the snow that will soon be covered with a fresh layer of white.
Harry grins at me. „Wait a sec. We're a bit early.“
„You know I didn't mean it like that,“ Potter says and Draco looks at him, at the blush that is rising in his cheeks, those beautifully awful glasses and wonders what Potter means saying he didn't mean it like that.
have. Otherwise, Draco can't explain his presence in his office.
„Certainty?“
“Please, fuck me.“
„Malfoy?“ Sam is looking at him with gleaming eyes.
Because I can never resist Harry. There is just something about him that brings me to my knees.
„What about... you know. Dates. Kissing in front of our friends. Watching movies together. Goodnight kisses. What about that?“
It's difficult.
The tip of a wand is pressed against my throat. Dark, hungry, vaguely familiar eyes are gazing into mine.
He turns to me. Looks at me.
„Thanks, darling,“ he says.
I'm such a bad person for wanting him to say no.
Harry does without further objection.
„Why did they break up in the first place?“ Malfoy asks.
Only after I said it, I realize
White-hot rage burns through me.
„Mr. Potter, I – I'll have to -“
„Yes.“
I pull back even further, rolling off of him. He gazes at me, at the frown on my face.
My chest is tight with anger, but I stay silent. Harry steps closer, his face morphing into that puppy look he does so well.
I scratch the back of my hand. „I think it was stupid to sleep with him.“
I don't take advantage of his pliantness, even though I'm not going to lie, sometimes it's dificult. I don't think he does it on purpose, but he's he worst tease, the way he'll wrap his legs around my waist, push against me and sigh when I push back against him.
„If you've found someone better, pray tell,“ the witch says.
Malfoy blinks at me. „That's unfortunate.“ He pulls my shirt off, then presses up against me, hands digging into my hips.
My fingers starts scratching at my knees and thighs, but I can't stop them.
If I have my way, he's never leaving. He's staying here, exactly like this.
I take off my coat and watch her turn, walking to the kitchen, not waiting for my response. She has put on a little weight, her hips runder and legs more shapely. Gone is the bony girl I used to know.
The mood in the office seems to be rather dim, contrasting Harry's own. He's feeling pretty amazing, even though there are still some lingering remains of anger at Draco's asshole-ex, which he really just wants to hex into Nirvana.
„You can take anything you want. And here's a list for groceries. I'm not sure if – I mean, you're free to go whereever you like, of course. But I can go shopping too. Just – yeah. Tell me what you'd prefer.“
„Jesus, fuck.
„I've wanked yesterday,“ he tells me. „Thinking about you.“
I don't know why. I guess I'm more lonley than I thought.
I pause.
She kisses me cheek.
Before I can protest, I'm dragged behind the dumpsters around the house. Broad, rough hands force me to my knees. My pants are shoved down, the stink of trash in my nose.
„I didn't cheat! I swear, Ron.“
She's crying, but that doesn't rob her of her voice. „You know it was bad between us! It's been for so long!“
I snort. „What would I say?
Harry's face brightens. „Yes?“
„But I doubt it's important. Maybe I'm confusing him with someone else. Or even if I have seen him before, it might just have been at a club or something. It doesn't mean anything.“
Again, I come first, while Draco is looking at me serenly out of those blue-silver eyes.
„Mr. Potter, a pleasure to see you again.“
“Nothing we can do about it now anyway,“ Weasley says. “A beer, anyone?“
I'm not sure if it's just his inexperience or if Draco prefers to give control over to his partner. But I know that when I first did this, I was thankful for every piece of guidance I was offered.
But it's still weird that Draco would leave her side, now that she's finally awake.
A white-hot arrow of arousel shoots through Harry, his cock pulling up hard. He starts sucking again.
, Malfoy?“ he shouts, right into my face.
Throughout the whole day, I think of what Draco never said.
„Did the three of you have a party last night and didn't invite me?“
No matter how completely over Ginny I am, it still stings, seeing her so happy with Luna. It probably makes me a terrible person. I know that and I've tried so hard to feel genuine joy when being confronted with their happiness, but all I come up with is a faint feeling of loss and a lot of envy.
Rose starts crying. Hermoine shuts her eyes for a moment. „I just changed her diaper. She also can't be hungry. So what is it, Rosie?“
„So, are you thinking cheese crackers or crisps?“
„Yeah, I thought it would be fun. I can't very well fly to work and I'm really not a huge fan of floos, so...“
Pansy rolls her eyes for some reason and throws the chopped carrots into the wok. „Whatever. Draco, love, I'm so happy for you,“ Pansy says and Draco knows that she's genuine. No matter how good of friends Slytherins make, they usually have a hard time being happy for their loved ones when they're not succeeding themselves. In other words, Pansy truly being happy for Draco means the world to him.
„What are you doing here?“ He sounds so tired.
“You can do that wandless now?“
“No, Draco, wait -“
I swat his hand away, but can't stop the smile spreading on my face.
„Draco is smarter than that.“
It doesn't matter who will come through this door. I'll be elsewhere.
With a sigh, I close the file and hand it back to the archivist who gives me a tight-lipped smile.
„I'm sure you can survive peeing your bed for the rest of your life, if that's how it is going to be.“
„Would you really help me?“
„Draco Malfoy killed Runcorn. I told you before and I have proof now.“
“Open it,“ he says softly.
A bitter grin is tugging on Nott's lips. „On and off. Can't seem to keep out for more than a couple months.“
But I don't, of course. The story would never hold and I'm not that kind of Auror. I don't want to be.
“Only on rare occasions.“
I look at my hands. The faint pitter-patter of rain hitting the window and roof calms me.
An almost smile grazes her lips. „If you have to get blacked out drunk, do it here, in our flat. Okay?“
Harry grins back.
“Here you go.“
Hermione looks at me and I put my fork down, shocked at the intensity in her gaze. „Harry, are you okay? You just... you seem very upset.“
„No.“ The answer comes too quickly. He lifts his brows at me. I shrug, face hot. „I like your teeth.“
Potter stills.
“No, I paid them to keep this slimy Serpent git off your back.“
Draco waits. I wait.
„I am not going to have sex with you again,“ he says, not looking into Draco's face.
“How did you find me?“ I ask.
I drink from my hot chocolate that's more lukewarm now. Potter's fault. Of course he had to show up during one of my scarce moments of peace and quiet.
„You're absolutely right, Jenna. I totally forgot about that. I'll include it in the curriculum.“
„I'm sure he wouldn't. And even if he did...“ Harry can't end the sentence.
Something unfamiliar and powerful is surging through me. It's something I have felt only toward Scorpius up until now, and even that was a tiny bit different.
Maybe it was harsh, but he finally felt like he could breathe again, like he was over her.
I bite my lip and flip through an example file of a fictional criminal that I should know by heart by now.
I smile at Pansy and squeeze her hand. Before I go, I throw Weasley a curious glance.
“That's mostly though because you used to treat them like exactly that when we were in school!“
“That's exciting.“
I didn't even listen.
I think there are about three chapters left! Thank you so much to everyone who has commented and left kudos <3 It means a lot to me!
„Albus, too.“
„So you just...?“
I really want to get him to look at me.
„Draco?“ The blond looks up at Harry, swallowing. „Everything okay?“
I reach out and squeeze his hand.
One drunken night, curled into a tight ball on Pansy's guest bed, I give in and write to him.
„I see. Don't worry, I always cast the charms. I'm not keen on catching something from you, Potter.“
„Hi.“
„Perhaps, but I'm not sure yet.“
Brown eyes narrow at me. Firey hair seems electrified. „Stop being such a baby, Harry.“
I don't need flowers when I have Draco right here with me.
am living with her.“
„Alright,“ Draco says. „But don't take too long.“
Weasley and his partner share a look.
„And to think I've been the one taking a whole year off to coddle her while you were working ten hours a day,“ I complain.
After the second tour, Jackson folds his hands.
He closes his eyes for a moment. „Why do you keep doing this to me?“ His voice is rough. „Does it amuse you?“
Like everything about him, Draco's legs are long and thin, the knees sharp. Harry's thighs are thicker as Draco's, his legs stronger, less elegant.
But something about the way we talked makes me want to get to know him better. Malfoy is different – different than the person he used to be and different from all of my friends. He has a unique worldview and perspective and for some reason that I really can't explain, I feel like I need that.
What Harry likes most about his job is making children's eyes light up. He knows – or, at least has a vague idea – that this might have (definitely, definitely has) something to do with the fact that, when he was a kid, his eyes rarely lit up. No one ever bothered to make them.
“He's gone,“ I say. “And I don't think he's coming back.“
„Alright, I think. She misses you. And she's worried.“ I pause. „Why aren't you talking to her?“
„It is.“
I stare into my cup. I know she's right. It's just...
The rain around us is blurring the world, smoothing out the sharp edges, dimming the light. We're alone in our bubble.
„I don't want to hurt you.“
Since he's dating Draco Malfoy, Harry will be the last person to tell Sam who to go out with. „Well, then I hope you'll have fun.“
My lips are on his in a quick exhale, our bodies pressed together. Draco's mouth opens under mine and we're burning up together. Our teeth are clashing and Draco bites my lip so hard that I'm bleeding, but we don't care.
But not in the way many others are. Not like Blaise, who rents prostitutes to slap around, because if he doesn't, he'll blow up his small, shabby office. Not like Millicent, who hasn't been seen since she – accidentally or maybe not so accidentally – set fire to Headauror Robards' house. Not even like Pansy, who only has sex with men if they let her fuck them.
I come inside him and he stops breathing, staring up at me in awe. I pull out and suck him off, two fingers shoved into his swollen, fucked-red hole. He comes quickly, fingers fisted into my hair.
I move out of Grimmauld Place two months later. You try not to show it, but I know you're upset about it. You want me to stay.
Hermione gives her a porcelain smile that tells her they're not there yet.
I make him a drink. He takes a sip. I pretend not to watch him. Serena looks at me, brows raised. When she makes an obscene gesture with her hands, I blush.
His tone makes it clear that he is dead serious and not in the mood for flirting and dirty talk right now, so I just say: „Yeah, I have. Twice.“
I lift my shoulders. He might be right.
Harry cracks a fourth egg into the pan, the sizzling sound filling the kitchen.
„Can I talk to you for a second?“
„Yeah, sure. I can take over here, if you want to go now.“
The ghost of a wry smile is playing around Draco's lips. „I just gave you permission to.“
Having that someone as one of your closest friend makes it truly unbearable.
I don't know why I'm dreaming about the Dursleys again.
She rushes over. Takes his hand. Worry is written on her face. „How are you feeling?“
His eyes are black and his whole body is shaking and suddenly, he seems so young. I cup his cheek with one hand and he leans into my touch, as if he couldn't help himself.
„Harry, I -“
“Like, mental health stuff?“ Thomas asks.
It's not like I don't think they'd deserve an apology.
„Everything alright?“ Draco signs and I force a smile.
He smiles with half of his mouth and gets up, grabbing both our empty cups.
I should’ve kissed him right in front of Harry. I want to tell him about all the blokes I took to bed.
Lucius Malfoy has reached the level of anger at which it's impossible to talk him down.
„Are you sure, Harry?“
And afterall, this suits me just fine.
“Do you have a place to stay?“
Zabini sets his own cup down with a little more force than necessary.
Malfoy's eyes squint as he regards me. The height difference between us has shrunken as I've grown. He's not really taller than me anymore. An inch at most.
„You're way too sweet, Harry, do you know that?“
Just when I think I'll come just like this, from his mouth on me, he pulls back. His hands on my hips urge me to turn around again. When he kisses me, I can very faintly taste myself on his tongue and maybe that should be disgusting, but it only turns me on more.
My mouth falls open at the sensation of Draco's tight heat gripping me. The Slytherin lets out a sweet, broken moan, one hand clenching around my biceps.
„You'll regret saying that.“
He kisses him and the Gryffindor's hands find Draco's hips, pulling him closer. He really seems to like that particular place, just below the sharp jut of the blond's hipbone and Draco finds he quite likes it too.
„Harry, I just... I don't know how to make a case. All you're giving me are suspicions.“
I'm working full time and during the first couple of weeks, Pansy pretty much is a full time job herself.
The Gryffindor drops down on a chair across from me, still dressed in his robes, and rubs his face.
„Well, I should get going,“ I say and get up.
The look Rogers shoots him is pitying.
I shrug.
He eases out of me and I miss him the moment he's gone, this weird, empty feeling confusing me. When Draco kisses me, slipping two fingers easily inside me, my dick twitches.
The blond's lip starts trembling. „Harry,“ he whispers. „Don't leave me.“
Pansy is shrugging on an elegant black coat when I enter the kitchen, already showered and fully dressed.
I'm moaning, shivering. Arching and clinging to him. Begging him to fuck me.
The blond looks at him warily. „I already know I won't like it, but you can ask.“
I'm not sure whom I mean.
A man passes us, throwing me a dirty glance.
„You've done it before?“ he asks me.
„Don't we always?“
He's around our age, ridiculously tall, rather thin, but well-proportioned. His hair is cropped and his skin dark.
„I don't mind getting fucked after I've come,“ he says, cutting me off. He spreads his legs, but I kiss him, then ask: „Would you mind... if I wanked?“
They stumble out of the stall. Draco wards the door and cleans the floor, if only rough and ready.
„Mrs. Flint, how well did you know Albert Runcorn?“ I ask.
He hasn't taken off his hood, which would be weird around many other places, but it isn't here. The build seems about right. So did the height, but that's not really much to go by.
His fingers are twitching in mine. I hold on a little tighter.
„We're going out and I'm going to do your face.“
Potter taps against the lock of the door. So I guess he doesn't even need words to do magic now anymore. I hate him even more for that – non-verbal magic has always been
„How are you doing?“ she asks, leaning in the doorframe, red hair like flames around her shoulders.
Harry turns his head, kissing his throat, sucking bruises into his skin as he's jerking Draco off. It doesn't take long and Draco comes with his head thrown back, moan caught in his throat and fingers digging into Harry's shoulders.
„Yes, thank you,“ Parkinson says.
Slowly, he straightens his back and pushes his hair out of his face. He concentrates on breathing.
But of course I still know how to do it. I used to practice every night. Then every week and now, a rush of panic I might have forgotten overcomes me at least twice a month and then I go through all the signs he taught me and a couple more.
I lean against him, relishing the feelings of his strong arms. He presses a kiss to my cheek, lingering.
Not today though.
„That's
“That's the idea, yes. Even though I'll need a bit more than that.“
My skin is crawling and I feel like throwing up, but suppress the urge.
It feels weird to ask that after just having his mouth on my cock, but somehow, I feel like I need special permission for this. Draco nods and I think his heart is beating faster.
He stops himself, body tensing. He holds his breath, anxiety washing over him. „Sorry, I didn't mean...“
„Are the two of you...“
Harry smiles so widely that my exhausted heart speads up once again.
Pansy is trying. She is really, really trying to be a good friend and ignore her jealousy and attraction and want, but it's hard. In fact, it's not working. She can't look at Sam anymore without having this horrible pain in her chest. Without wanting to kiss her.
„Do you really think I have nothing better to occupy my time with?“ he writes, arching one regal brow at me.
„What do you think about pizza?“
I keep him on his belly. Kiss my way down his spine.
„I didn't cast protection spells,“ I whisper.
„Did you sleep with him?“
I give the bottle to Harry, fingers brushing lightly. I watch him while he drinks. Puts his mouth where mine was just seconds ago.
„Why?“
I look away my heart is pounding.
He opens the door for me and I lose my breath. He's just wearing a simple jumper and old, worn jeans, but he looks good enough for me to sink my teeth into.
Harry bites his lip. Draco wants to tell him to stop. With a shake of his head, Harry says: „No. I'm sorry.“
Albus almost crashes into me. I take my wand and send a patronus to Draco.
„It doesn't matter.“
„And that means?“ Harry asks, one hand on my shoulder.
„Yeah, I am!“ he yells. I flinch, he's so loud. „And maybe in return for pissing off all my friends, you could at least not antagonize them on purpose.“
„I can see that.“ Astoria hands me a crystal glass with red wine and I take it, trying not to leave fingerprints on the delicate glass.
We've been sleeping on the couch for a week when I decide that I want Harry back.
„You're so tight,“ you say, wonder in your eyes. My eyes flutter shut and my legs wrap around your waist, pulling you closer.
I hold my breath. Try bracing myself for anything Weasley might dish out. For more punishing hands on my body.
„So you think I can't be friends with a queer guy?“
„Always so over-eager. Just keep doing what you did before.“
I shake my head.
A stinging hex forces me to let go of Draco. The Slytherin glares at me.
It is embarrassing to think it now, but... Harry thought they were friends.
“It's not that complicated, either.“
„Oh, by all means, you can pay for my drink, Potter,“ Pansy says and Sam laughs. Pansy doesn't look at her, but smiles at Draco. „You've spotted this one well, Drake. I'm proud of you.“
Harry and Terry exchange a quick look. The Ravenclaw tends to be intimidated by the Slytherins snapping at each other – but he is also better than Harry at easing the tension.
Pansy's fingers dig into the blanket. „I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.“
„Why wouldn't you tell us if you really were friends with Malfoy?“ Hermione asks.
„That's fine with me. The more the merrier. You all are welcome as well, obviously,“ Sam says and Harry silently thinks that this is everything but obvious.
„Not really,“ Draco answers. „I wanted to talk to you.“
“I still think of you. Of us.” Harry’s voice isn’t much more than a breath. “I want you. Fuck me.”
„Oh. I'm sorry.“ Malfoy didn't know, judging by the look of shock on his face.
“Let's sit,“ Pansy says and we climb on two high stools. A deep blue drink in a delicate glass is standing in front of her. She takes a sip, then passes it on to me. “I moved with my family to France, for a year. Kept my head down and mostly dreamed of better days.“
„What are you doing here?“
It's not like I have counted the days until the next sleepover.
“It's one year more practice,“ I say.
“Ron and I are trying to change that.“
„Where will you stay now?“
She spins around and puts her wand to my throat. She must know that hexing me would be the dumbest thing she could do. But there she is, pointing her wand at me.
“ I think Harry is holding his breath. My voice grows more confident with every word I read.
The witch inclines her head.
„Okay, well... like to fuck him or like him?“
As a dad, you can't just start fights in the middle of a bookstore.
„Look, if fucking a Malfoy is beyond you, we can pretend it has never happened. But I need to talk to you about your godson.“
“I think I've heard it a time or two.“
I look into my empty mug. „Turns out I don't love her and that means she can't love me.“
He checks his phone again and just in that moment, a text pops up.
Potter takes some deep breaths. „Well? What new evidence do you have?“
Zabini takes his mug, his long fingers tracing the rim.
I have to say, I wasn't completely prepared for this. I thought he'd deny it, say it's all lies, but apparently, he thinks that's too risky. Perhaps because of Parker, I'm not sure.
Since it's a Friday night, it's even more packed than usually. Ron and I bump into three strangers until we finally make it to the table with our hollering mates. Dean and Seamus seem to both be already quite intoxicated, meaning they're even louder than normally, laughing and exchanging smacking kisses from time to time. They're cute, they really are, but they're also... a lot.
My hand is in my pants. I don't allow myself to stop and take a moment to think about this. What it means.
I know. I can't wait. And I'm terrified.
It's past four in the morning until everyone is gone.
„Wasting my time in some sleazy pub with you, as it seems. What about you?“
„What do you mean?“
Malfoy rolls his eyes and runs one finger over my arm. „I wouldn't be here if I didn't, would I? I'm simply saying there are still a lot of things I could show you.“
He blushes a little, but his smirk is almost confident. A few more good fucks and he'll be an awesome shag.
„It wasn't me, Harry,“ he shouts and Harry has never heard his voice so desperate before. „I wasn't lying, I swear. Harry, you got to -“
Ron's face is indescribable. Finally, he turns to Hermione. „Someone must have hexed him.“
„I feel like you're avoiding him.“
„I don't know. But it would explain why we don't remember.“
Ron doesn't argue. He rubs his face. „Murder is murder. If Malfoy did it, there's nothing we can do to help him. Not that I even think that's a good idea.“
„Malfoy?“
„We already have. Sorry we didn't notify you, but...“ With a shrug, Sandy Hair nods at me. „We got him. And there're some vamps down the hall.“
“You've spent your whole childhood and adolescence chasing the bad guys. I'd imagine you'd like to do something else for a change.“
Well, I guess for most people, going to a club to pull wouldn't fall under the category of desperate measures, but for me, this is a first.
I know that.
Harry kisses me and I keep his face close to mine. His smile is touching something deep inside of me. He kisses my nose and then my eyebrows before he pulls me close, curling his body around mine.
Finally, she manages to close her mouth. My throat is clogged with humiliation, pride and white hot burning shame.
„Fine, then. I'm off.“
„I'm fine,“ I sign and she steps closer. Sits next to me on the bed. I can smell her – familiar and earthy.
Instinctively, Harry moves away. There are hands grabbing at him.
My voice comes out broken and croaky. Potter startles. Stares at me.
„Yes.“
I press my knuckles against my eyes, then sign: „I don't know what to do.“
„I guess they do.“
To Harry's surprise, Draco pushes Harry's arm away and takes a step toward George. „I understand if you hate me. But I still need to tell you that I'm deeply sorry for your loss.“
Harry stays for my whole shift. Once, a vampire hits on him and quickly aborts the mission when he's faced with my anger. Harry smiles softly at me and finally, I realize that he really doesn't need me to fight off any vampires for him. He doesn't need me to.
„But he's sure?“
„It'll only make you tired, kiddo.“
Draco glares at me. „I do not.“
„Well, I'm happy for you two.“
Without offering us something to drink, she sits down in an armchair, rather stiffly. Ron and I take a seat on the sofa, both perched on the edge.
„An advent calendar?“
Something uncomfortably honest must have slipped into my voice, because Malfoy's eyes settle.
Granger pushes some of her wild hair back.
I stretch out my legs. It's seven a.m., meaning I have some more time until I have to be at the office.
„Help me with those fairy lights real quick, will you?“ I ask Harry when he stomps through the door on December first, heavy boots on his feet and two cups of steaming coffee in his hands.
Harry looks at Draco and feels a slight blush rising in his cheeks when the blond is locking eyes with him.
Leaving Potter standing, I take the drink to the tall witch who ordered it, instead of just sending it flying there with my wand.
Harry knows he gives decent blow jobs, but he's not amazing. Deep throating is difficult for him – his gag reflex too strong.
„I don't think what you're saying is crazy,“ he finally says. „But I just don't see how Narcissa would have gotten away from the guards, out of her house without anyone even
Draco slinks down the stairs and looks at me over Hermione's shoulder. I mouth: „They broke up,“ and a small crease appears high on Draco's forehead. He nods and quietly turns around, ascending the stairs again.
Hermione gives a smile, only slightly tentative. „Now I understand why I'm here.“
I lift one shoulder and smile wryly. „She says it is. I think fashion designer would still be her preferred career choice, but she definitely likes stripping better than waiting tables.“
I'll never understand how someone as smart and at least decently attractive as Granger could end up with Ronald Weasley, but even I have to admit that he isn't quite as far below average as I remember him. Tall and broad-shouldered, freckled and red-headed.
“My pleasure,“ I plan to lilt, but it's more like a croak.
The last ones to arrive are Neville and his wife Hannah. I haven't seen both of them in quite a while, which is a shame, since Hannah and Draco are getting along pretty well.
Harry is quiet and Draco feels bad. They pretend they're asleep when both of them lie awake.
“I think it would be time to change the subject,“ Luna says, her huge eyes unblinking.
It's almost as if I could hear both our hearts speed up. The room is quiet. It's only us.
I wait for him to go on. „I used to think we were fine. When we stopped having – you know, I eventually asked her why. And she straight up told me that it's bad.“
“Do you know when Serpent is going to get new dittany?“ I ask her, finally managing to close the last button.
His face closes off so quickly that I flinch.
„I'm not sure, it's hard to keep track of time. About a year?“
He has a nice throat. I got to admit that. It's long and elegant and...
Draco snorts, then smiles. „I assume I was. But at least in Potions, it was well-deserved.“
I want to say something to him about it, but Albus is right next to me, so I can't.
“Yes. And probably more thouroughly than most people.“
Pansy gives me an indulgent smile. „Sweetheart, I know how you get when you're stressed. You even
I mean – I could seduce him. I know I could. But that would be wrong.
He sucks in a breath and his hands grip my hips.
Weasley just grins.
The pretty woman narrows her eyes, but lets her drag me over to the table Harry is sitting at, deliberately not looking at me.
„To us,“ Blaise says as they all raise their drinks for a toast.
The night is not yet fading into grey morning light. It's the darkest hour, on the verge of tilting.
Draco Malfoy. No way.
My hand runs over his hair. I pull him close again, until he settles his head back on my chest.
Leaning forward, Ron gives me a closer look.
„Then tell him that. If Potter is the man he claims to be, he'll understand. If he truly likes you, you'll figure it out together. And if not, you come to me immediately, okay? Don't let him hurt you.“
When his fingers curl around mine, the world narrows to skin on skin.
„Yes. I'm here to see Pansy. What happened? Is she okay?“
t first, he wants to say no. I can see it. But then, another thought seems to cross his mind.
“I count on it, Ferret.“
„So am I.“
„You're sweet,“ he then says.
“I intend to make it count.“
Draco hums and tries to move in to kiss him, but Harry flinches away.
“She's ill. I think she might die, and I...“
over any piece of furniture I like.“
My heart is so heavy.
„Of course, you don't have to use it. I can take it back to my place, if you don't like it. It's probably been a stupid idea, I just -“
“Suck your cock?“ I ask.
My left eyebrow shoots up. „Being the Saviour of the whole fucking world? Always surrounded by your adoring fans, friends and family? No, I assume I don't know what it's like.“
“I guess.“
„Yes?“
Potter throws me a look that's almost enough to irritate me, if I wasn't so used to all kinds of creepy looks by now.
Without a word, I get off his lap and start undressing. I don't do it gracelessly, but I'm not giving him the full show, either. I'm impatient and I can tell he is, too.
The sound of my name sends a pleasant shiver down my spine.
„Jesus.“
„What happened to your teeth?“
Draco's mouth softens and he looks down. „I'll think about it, alright?“
I shift Rose in my arms.
„Are you happy now, Malfoy? You know you're going to Azkaban anyway. You've gained exactly nothing, you fucking bastard.“ Ron is fuming.
, it reads.
„Is Scorpius coming over on the weekend?“
“You may. But, Mr. Malfoy – if you want to return later, maybe continue this conversation, you're very welcome to.“
Parkinson nods again.
„Your lips are blue,“ Potter says in alarm. I can't bring myself to open my eyes. I need to relish this warmth while it lasts.
My mouth goes dry. „You're... You're a fucking arsehole, Draco.“
in his direction, and I'll kill you. Hear me?“
The kids next to Harry are smiling at me. I wonder who they are. They obviously can't be Harry's, but they're not siblings either. Harry is an only child. Maybe they belong to the Weasley clan somehow, but they lack the trademark hair and seem too old to be anyone's children.
That makes two of us.
„Harry. I can't stand thinking you'll beat yourself up because of me. I don't want you to... put blame on yourself that isn't yours. So, please. Promise me.“
„I'm sorry,“ I say. „I should have never -“
Harry leans back in his chair, moonstruck.
„Yes.“
Draco looks to the side. Back at me.
But, you see, I'm a coward. I know you know. I could never take a life. Not even my own.
Blaise meets his gaze evenly.
I almost spit out my drink. „For real?“
I think he's trying to slow me down with his hands on my hips, but I can't, and so he comes with a shout. With my name on his lips. I watch him and think that this is by far the most erotic experience of my life.
“I can give you clothes of mine, for now,“ I say.
It does when Scorpius tells my parents.
„Why do you even care what everyone else thinks?“
„Well, then... I'll see you in a month?“
„Hey, Ferret.“
But it's so rare that someone defends werewolves with such determination. People usually either speak in blatant hatred or with carefully put in place political correctness.
Harry is quiet for a moment.
I blew him until he wasn't saying anything but
Suddenly, I have no idea anymore why I'm even here. I don't think Uncle Vernon
It's also better because I get free coffee every day and can lend books without paying for a membership.
„I -“
