“If your fingers aren’t enough, then-”
“You're so
at her. Or,” Granger paused with a conflicted look on her face, “or you and Harry together because I'd sell my soul to the devil to see you two get it on.”
"So… you’re into choking."
“Do you-” swallowing the lump in his throat Harry asked, “should I do exactly what I was doing before?”
and his reaction showed as much, “
fucking hot. So, I don't know. It's something I'd be open to trying sometime, if you want to of course."
Harry wasn’t sure if it was the words, or the use of Draco's given name, but Harry felt him pull away before a hand was on the small of his back and he felt something much larger brushing against him. Harry didn’t have to ask again before Draco slowly began pushing into him, his moan going directly into Harry’s ear as he draped himself over Harry’s back.
“I fucking hate you all.”
warmed his blood more than the alcohol flowing through his veins did. It was as he spoke that Harry became acutely aware of Draco's ankles pressed against his under the table, and the way his fingers were tracing circles over his hand in an almost mindless fashion.
With how slow he was working him open, it was clear to Harry that Draco was holding himself back for the sake of not hurting him, but dammit Harry wanted a little pain with his pleasure and he wanted to please Draco even more. Bringing his hand to his mouth Harry coated his fingers in spit before he summoned all his Gryffindor courage and reached around, sinking a slick into himself alongside Draco's. Harry’s lust addled brain not registering the moan Draco let out at seeing him finger himself with him.
“You heard me perfectly well ferret face. Take your shirt off.”
Harry swallowed the food in his mouth before speaking, “okay, I’ll admit things got away from me a bit.”
After a few seconds Harry was coming back to his senses, a jolt of concern passing through him when he saw Draco sitting up and coughing, “oh shit, are you okay?”
be bent over himself.
After they began kissing Malfoy couldn’t help but think that if he had known Potter was this good of a kisser, then he would've done this years ago. It was just “tame” kissing but wow, Malfoy wondered what other hidden talents the golden boy had.
That was all the warning Harry got before Draco gripped his hair and tugged him flush against his pelvis, cumming down Harry’s throat with one of the most beautiful moans he had ever heard from the blonde. The taste of Draco and the feeling of him spilling into Harry’s mouth brought him to climax, his entire body shaking as his orgasm washed over him.
Every muscle in Harry’s body locked up for a moment before his back arched off the bed and he came with a hoarse cry of Draco’s name. That sight. Seeing Harry’s brows furrow and jaw fall slack, his whole body tensing and trembling with pleasure as he painted his chest white was enough to send Draco careening over the edge after him.
Beginning to move his body against Draco's, Harry moaned “b-both.”
Harry silently thanked every deity out there that Draco was usually a rather heavy sleeper, giving him the chance to play uninterrupted.
Malfoy pondered his answer for a minute because there were so many things he could say that he wanted to do. Leaning up on one arm Malfoy brought his other hand to cup Potter’s face, his finger tracing his bottom lip as he answered, “I would strip him down and get him on his back, or all fours, working him open with my tongue and fingers until he’s begging me to fuck him,” Malfoy watched Potters lips part with a gasp, his words faltering as his thumb partially slipped between the lush skin and into Potters mouth, who barely hesitated to hum around the digit and swirl his tongue, “or maybe I would take him against a wall with a half-assed prep spell, fucking him so hard that he would feel me for
Faster than any tipsy person should be able to move, Potter pushed Malfoy back into a sitting position before swinging a leg over to straddle his lap and pulling him into a bruising kiss. Ripping a strangled noise out of Malfoy as he dropped his weight down.
“Position yourself like you were before,” Harry took a shaky breath as he rolled back onto his stomach and rose to his knees, keeping his eyes trained on the headboard he spread his legs, presenting himself to the man behind him, “fuck, you look perfect.”
Draco suddenly grabbed Harry’s wrists and pinned them above his head, soft silk wrapping around his wrists and binding him to the headboard.
Yet again, Draco looked at Harry with surprise on his face as he sat up, “are you serious?”
One of Draco's hands pushed Harry’s hair back, allowing him a clear view of Harry; the flush painting his cheeks, the drool dripping down his chin, the tears rolling down his cheeks. Draco saw it all, “you look, fuck- Harry you’re perfect, so good. So good at this, so fucking-” Draco cut off with another pitched moan as his hips bucked up into Harry’s mouth, “so good for me.”
Blowing on the wet trails of saliva, Harry shivered as Draco moved back to his mouth, pulling violently at his restraints when Draco hovered just out of his reach, “oh what’s this, do you want to touch me,
Even though Harry could tell that Draco was annoyed at him, with a flick of his wand there was a full plate of food now sitting in front of Harry, “I’m sorry, I lost track of time and just… forgot to eat.”
Bumping his leg against Draco's Harry smiled, “sometimes you’re really cheesy you know.”
, or how he thinks they’re beautiful, but he doesn’t stop Harry from worshipping them like they are his religion and Draco’s body is his temple. And even though Draco has never outright said it, Harry is convinced that sometimes Draco enjoys the special attention he pays to his scars.
Draco collapsed on Harry’s chest, not caring that they were both covered in a thin sheen of sweat, or that he was laying in a puddle of their mixed cum.
Smiling brightly Harry responded, “can we go to that muggle Italian place?”
Draco looked down at Harry; mouth full of cock, drool dribbling down his chin, and tears brimming in his eyes, “you really are a slut for my cock aren't you,” pulling out of his mouth Draco gave Harry a split second to take a deep breath before he plunged his cock back into that hot cavern, “so desperate to take me any way you can.”
I had an idea of how I wanted to pace this fic and when smut would come into play, but that plan went out the window... I ended up writing smut. It was an accident I swear.
They converted an old classroom on the sixth floor for all of the returning eighth years to stay in, and it was probably big enough that everyone could've all had their own rooms, but is that what happened? Ha, no. She put Luna, Hermione, and Pansy in a room together; Ron, Dean and Theodore together; Neville, Blaise, and Seamus in another; which meant that the last room was for the two people who shouldn't be anywhere near each other. What could possibly go wrong with Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter sleeping in the same room?
After a few minutes of silence Draco asked, “You okay?”
Draco helped Harry sluggishly maneuver himself under the crisp sheets before crawling in with him, pulling Harry against his chest a beat later. Who then shifted back against Draco a moment later with a content sigh.
paper that he laughed, easing Harry’s tingling nerves, “I suppose you’ll be wanting a list of my own?”
you are really good at that.” Draco smirked at him before it faded into an all out frown, “what’s the face for?”
“I’m sure I want this, want you.” A light blush painted Harry’s cheeks as he continued, “and as long as you treat me to a nice dinner after this, I’ll have no regrets.”
As he took in Draco’s appearance, Harry realized had no idea when Draco had removed his own clothes or, judging by the state of his soft cock, when he had cum. But Harry was too sated to care, “enjoy the show?”
Pulling away completely Draco stood up to grab a small bottle from his bedside table before getting back on the bed. He didn’t give any warning before he pulled Harry’s pants off, allowing his aching cock to spring free, and settled himself between those muscled thighs. Harry’s face was on fire at being completely bare in front of Draco but he couldn’t look away. It was a sight out of his darkest fantasies and he wanted to see every moment of it.
Running his fingers up those glorious thighs Draco leaned forward and slowly dragged his tongue along the underside of Harry’s cock, his own cock twitching at the moan the ravenette let out. Taking Harry’s cock in his hand Draco jerked it a few times before leaning in again and swirling his tongue around the head, lapping up the beads of precum that leaked out.
“Harry, go sit next to Malfoy.”
“Kiss Granger.”
It was Malfoy’s turn to let out a low noise when Harry bucked his hips up, allowing both of them to feel just how hard the other was. At this, Potter opened his eyes and gazed up at Malfoy with a look that set his blood on fire. They were both only vaguely aware of the sudden chatter that erupted in the room as they looked at one another, at least until a voice yelled that it wasn’t right to
Draco laughed as he stood up, pulling Harry to his feet as well, “we could always order in and go out for drinks if you want, I think it’d be good for us to go out somewhere, even if for a bit.”
Those words the only warning he got before Draco was cumming down his throat with a low groan. Harry nearly panicked as the salty fluid filled his mouth and he struggled to both breathe and swallow, but Draco pulled back almost fully, giving Harry what he needed to swallow around his cock. No sooner had the words “good boy” left Draco’s mouth, was Harry cumming for the fourth time.
. None.”
Harry pushed the image of stripping down wallpaper and ripping up the floorboards out of his mind and headed to one of the bedrooms he used for storage, having been too scared to open the door to the attic with the eerie sounds of whispering he heard behind it. Harry might have battled numerous dark wizards and witches in his time but that didn’t mean he lacked all common sense.
Because of everything Draco had told him, Harry was more understanding as to why he couldn’t attend the Battle of Hogwarts memorial get-together and dinner. And that night when Harry went alone, and people asked where Draco was, Harry was glad not to lie. He had felt so guilty before when he would lie to his friends about Draco’s work, but now he was
The past few weeks had been tolerable with everyone living in one large shared space as they finished their new dorm. Except McGonagall seemed to have this delusion that she can somehow make all of them into people who will braid each other's hair and make friendship bracelets; not threaten to rip one anothers spine out and choke them with it. But hey, Harry thought that if Malfoy and he didn't kill each other in the first week then color him impressed.
As soon as Harry said those words it was like a switch flipped in Draco. The blonde leaned down and pressed their lips together in a passionate kiss. It was almost nothing like before. Before there had been uncertain nerves of not knowing what the other truly wanted, but now. Now Harry didn’t hold back the moan he let out when Draco’s tongue slipped into his mouth, teasing and brushing against his own.
Chuckling at his boyfriends neediness Draco placed a quick kiss on his forehead, “I’m just getting us something to sleep in.”
Groaning Harry smushed his face against the couch, “that was not my finest moment.”
With sluggish movements Draco retrieved his and Harry’s underwear, not bothering with the pants, so they could put them on and get under the blankets of Draco’s bed. The magic mattress a true godsend for their sore and tired bodies.
“Oh fuck you.”
That same smooth skin blushed pink, glistening with a sheen of sweat. That blonde hair sticking to his damp forehead, going in every direction from being pulled and grabbed and brushed through. That voice hoarse from moaning and begging, from crying out Harry’s name.
For the next two weeks as Draco worked to get certified Harry did his own research on places to go and things to do, and he called Hermione to get some ideas from what she and Ron had been up to. It was fun, both to find these things himself and to finally have a proper catch-up with one of his oldest friends and find out what she had been up to traversing the globe.
For all the bravado Malfoy had been showing these past five or so minutes, even with everything that both he and Potter had said, there was still uncertainty on his face as he asked, “do you want to head up to our room?”
"Did you really kill a Basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore's office?" Terry Boot asked. "Or was that just Malfoy's song?"
What was not so satisfying was the positive klaxons that sounded above them when Hermione tried to drag Draco up to her dorm with her, drawing the whole common room's wincing attention. "What are you doing, Malfoy?" one of the Weasley twins called. "No boys in the girls' dorms, don't you know that?"
be more acquiescent."
So, please look forward to Draco Malfoy and the Talon Brand...
Harry kissed him and it was like the release of the guards in Draco against his own magic, the dam loosed and a world of possibilities let out unchecked, danger and yet life, vital and painful and perfect on the tongue. Harry tasted like sparkling cider and frustration, kiss harsher and sharper than under the mistletoe, laid out in bed with Harry on top of him, sucking down on his bottom lip. Draco arched as he strained into the kiss, pinned wrists his leverage to lift his back off the bed and press up his mouth in whining demand.
I did Protego Diabolica on one of my first tries without
"Says the boy in a hoodie for a party?" Sirius said mutinously.
Hermione let out an astonished gasp and slowed when they flew over a knot of albino peacocks, clustering around a garden snake they were hunting. "They're so pale!" she squealed.
"What?" went Theo, and he had definitely used to be more fun. "Draco, I don't know, but Professor Snape says anyone who wants to be on the list has to come out and tell him now, so..."
He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then turned towards Ron, and Draco feared the worst. "Wait!" Draco called. "Wouldn't it be more fun to make his friends watch as he dies?" Ron gave him the dirtiest look, and Draco shrugged weakly at him.
There was no guarantee that a ritual of that power hadn't already been detected, not by wards of Nurmengard's strength. There could be wizards of any number and strength coming to arrest them for their attempt to help this thick bugger, the long arm of the law rearing itself. Or, worse- the
I don't ever want us to be against each other. I didn't want to leave home. I didn't want to leave you alone with him. I just didn't have a choice after what I did. And I know it was my choice to do that, but I made that choice. And you can make that choice too.
Potter had never looked this hapless and out-of-sorts, even trying to deal with girls. "No, but... you like Quidditch, don't you? I heard you tell Hermione you were really good once, and when we were playing, you seemed good- I wish we could play together again, but I know first-years aren't allowed to have brooms or play Quidditch, so we couldn't, but-"
as if they were discussing the unimportance of an intramural Quidditch friendly.
Dobby had brought them a total of twenty-seven croissants. "It's a symbol of his devotion," Draco said happily, once Severus had finished counting them out and silently shaking his head. "I'm surprised you haven't managed to figure it out, Severus. Are you covering for me? Or do you mean to tell me you've genuinely failed in uncovering what I've done?"
"Who's
"Theo didn't join up until you named his father in the Quibbler," Blaise protested, "And neither did-"
Draco had agonized over the inscriptions, before deciding the simple truth was incredible enough.
Draco chuckled, trying to ignore Pansy's death glare, and reached out. "Here, Krum. Let's have us some Christmas crackers." He only remembered halfway through his lot of them, at Theo's amused side-eye, that he had previously passionately declared them as only suitable for commoners.
"I don't think anyone says that," offered Neville, and Draco left them to their burdens and puzzles, Harry to Slughorn, Ron to Apparition, Hermione to her usual academic hysteria, and Luna and Neville to each other. He only flinched as he heard their conversation turn back to Apparition in his imminent absence. Hermione asked if anyone else besides Draco had missed every single Apparition lesson.
"I don't know what to think about," Draco said, but not loud enough for Lupin to hear.
"Why- why would this be a place to build a castle, though? Such a horrible place- you said- experiments to find its origin, or-"
"You don't need my permission," Draco sighed, "Though I can't promise you success. And as long as you don't act like a jerk or do anything awful to her, you don't have to worry about any of my retaliation either."
A murmur went through the crowd, and the next sob that sounded was not Mrs. Weasley's, it was Hermione's. Draco looked over at her, noticed her for the first time, and wondered how long tears had been running down her face. He smiled at her, and she smiled back through her tears. Tonks put an arm around her shoulders.
"Very well." Severus strode out without further ado, leaving Lockhart staring wistfully after him.
Draco took more time finishing Potter's Slytherin tie than he had to, before straightening the dark green collar of Potter's robe and not bothering to hide his admiration for the picture Potter made, for once. He would think it for the Slytherin apparel only. "Perhaps I would have changed my mind, Potter, should your appearance have too gravely profaned our noble colors. But instead... I find Slytherin rather suits you."
me. Just a little bit. But I think I'll have to see your name engraved there up close to believe it fully. Harry James Potter," he mused, and gave Harry a last soft, half-lidded look through his light blond eyelashes before departing. "Bring it to the Tower. And don't you dare tell anyone where you're going."
Draco's hands went to Potter's waist, clinging there desperately. Potter didn't stop him. His hand began to stroke the back of Draco's head, without any of the awkwardness that Draco would have expected in a more lucid moment, only the soft brush of Potter's fingers through his hair. "She's going to be fine, Draco, I promise, don't cry, she's not dead..."
"Striker, you have to realize, even before I knew he was innocent, I didn't consider Uncle Sirius my worst relative. Or my second
"No one is 'licking my boots', Draco, as if you haven't noticed! Everyone hates me since we lost those points, which we wouldn't have if
"Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix," Dumbledore explained. Draco wracked his memory. Mr. Weasley hadn't died in the blue loop, so this was either non-fatal, or
he thought towards Harry with his eyes, and Harry just simmered more at him in return. "I did try to blackmail him."
Severus absented himself, already as dressed up for the ball as he was going to get, and they all went to different rooms to change. Hermione didn't really start panicking until she saw Draco. "Oh my God," she said, looking instantly on the verge of tears. "You look so
"They don't do that anymore," Dantanian said quietly, but neither seemed to hear him.
aren't going to fall from your broom and crack your skull open-" She realized her voice was rising and lowered it. "And really, from everything I've read about other methods of Wizarding transportation, brooms are an unnecessarily arcane means of transport for the modern wizard. Not to mention that the scoring system of Quidditch is insanely unbalanced-"
it. The thought of being seen publicly with a Muggleborn had Theo more than nervous enough to let it go.
The five of them ran out of Nurmengard and Draco nearly stumbled over Karkaroff's cooling body. He didn't trample it, but it was a near thing.
mad..."
Harper didn't get the Snitch, though. Harry was faster. He was always faster, and for the first time in Draco's two lives, he could cheer with his whole heart as the Snitch once again was caught up in Harry's hand as securely as Draco's heart.
"Come on, let's go!" Draco hissed, and grabbed her hand and positively ran down the stairs.
With that accomplished, Draco hurried to push a page from the Malfoy genealogy register into Dobby's hand, in case Dobby didn't even know this was his birthday. "Look, Dobby, I found this, it says the day you were born, it's what gave me the idea..."
"Draco," Remus said cautiously, "I don't know how to put this in a way that won't offend you. Maybe we should have talked about this sooner, since I am one of your guardians for the summer, and I take that responsibility seriously. Draco, what do you think about happiness?"
he thought with satisfaction.
What was the saying? Save someone's life, and you're bound to them for the rest of

Potter hadn't been saying much, nor did he try to walk with them, so his preoccupied air made Draco wonder if his scar had been hurting again, and not just from Draco poking at it all the time. "Imagining all the sexy students we'll be getting from abroad?"
"You're sure it was romantic?"
here."
Between Draco and Hermione's charm skills, they managed to construct a sort of magical blanket fort around the three beds they had put together, which fit all four of them if a bit snugly. Draco summoned the Gryffindors' pajamas, and they all went off separately to change.
Hermione, who had just recovered from her laughing fit, had to bury her giggles in her arms again. Draco looked around, irritated at this insufficiently appreciative response to his sincere efforts to be civil, and decided his first priority should be securing a last meal, should he perish in this deceptively bland-looking den full of Muggle machines and daughter-worship. "Will we eat soon? I am rather hungry, Mr. and Mrs. Granger," he added winningly, and gave them his best smile.
When Draco Apparated, Severus was barely a second behind him. He started speaking frantically in Draco's ear as they went around to the front, crumpled letter shoved into his pocket. "Draco, where did you get this- are you certain it is
If Sirius Black could sneak his way out of Azkaban, you would think he could have done the world a favor and snuck on over to off Aunt Bella before making his merry way out. From the way Aunt Bella had used to brag about Potter's face after he watched her kill his godfather, it would have been for Black's best interest in the longterm. But no, whatever Gryffindor fluke allowed the Prisoner of Azkaban to escape from the inescapable hellhole Draco remembered all too well, Black had not had the grace or sense to get rid of one of the many ticking time bombs that faced Draco in the red line's future.
Draco approached the cauldron with its lighter pearly gold contents, set a bit apart from the others because of its strong smell, and finally let the whiff of Amortentia hit his nose. He remembered it smelled differently based on what attracted you. He could smell a confusing array of aromas, with broomsticks, fresh-cut grass, sweat, a cheap-smelling Muggle shampoo, and a sharpness of powerful magic palpable in the air, so strong it was not just a feeling there but a scent-
This time, the stones seemed to go up in smoke, an instant contraction from beautiful and luminous to joining the dark hissing morass already sliding in ribbons of red beneath them, joining the pool so quickly Draco shoved Harry back, out and away from the circle. Draco followed as quickly as he could, but he was still drenched in blood up to his knees, so much his robes and trousers were sodden and heavy with it.
"Don't cry, Striker," he laughed, wiping at the tears that were streaming unrestrained down her face. "Don't cry, everything's fine now, everyone is going to be fine..."
"Safer than with Crookshanks, I'd reckon- actually, I'd bet we're all still safer right now than poor Scabbers alone in the Tower with that beast- bloody hell, Draco, are you alright?"
Draco could only express his gratitude by giving Potter a kiss on the cheek. Ron was even more tickled by that, doubling over in laughter once he witnessed Potter's frozen face, as good as if he'd been petrified by the monster. The two of them practically had to bodily drag him the rest of the way to the hospital wing. They had to follow McGonagall's orders now.
"It wasn't that much work," Draco lied, and she eyed him with a strangely regretful look.
Harry crossed his arms. Draco unfolded them for him purposefully, extracting each hand so he could hold both in his. It made the tense look on Harry's face melt, once Draco swung them a bit between them, playfully. "You're so funny," Harry said helplessly, and kissed him.
Luna looked an adorable combination of abashed and still oblivious. "Should I not send him any more poems?"
Ginny came into the kitchen still in her nightgown, blearily rubbing her eyes and asking what was for breakfast. Her shriek when she noticed their visitors had arrived was enough to draw more Weasleys piling down the stairs in great excessive bursts. Ginny ran off to get dressed, while Mr. Weasley, the twins, Peter, and Ron squeezed themselves into the kitchen in turn. Ron and the twins accepted hugs from Hermione, while all but Peter got handshakes from Draco.
"I have never heard of anyone breaking out of Azkaban successfully. But nor had I heard of anyone breaking successfully in." The headmaster leaned back in his chair once he was sure he had woken their patient, in a sea of beds so collectively empty, it was like some contagion was feared within. "Until you. But then, I doubt there are many attempts. Tell me, Daniel Shaw. Why would a Muggleborn Hogwarts fifth-year break
Draco leaned against the window of the nearest compartment, ignoring Pansy and Millie waving at him, and opened the paper. It took some doing, given how many names had been copied onto the parchment in magically inscribed Ravenclaw-blue, with a silver shimmer to only two: Luna Lovegood and Draco Malfoy. When Draco touched them each, a fetching glitter rose in the air between the two, as if a set of fireworks going off to celebrate their discovery as cousins, even if it took the distance of a Hogwarts-sized family tree to link the names.
, to render you... pliable... by his own means. But you would
Draco flopped backwards onto his bed, letting his head fall back against the pillows with a groan. "Merlin, you do my head in, Hermione. Someday, when you're older, maybe you could do something to change things, but not now- any changes would have to come through legislation, and you wouldn't want to start with pushing emancipation, almost no one wants that, masters
"Severus," Remus said, a pleasant smile appearing glued onto his face. "You've come just in time to join us for the meal. I hope you like lamb."
"For a wizard of your overall power, your earth magic is notably weak," Severus went on, "Which indicates paucity of light magic, or magic with creative properties as opposed to destructive ones. Apparently Periander guessed without needing to be told that you cannot produce a Patronus."
Severus stared at Sirius, so long that Draco feared Severus would draw his wand. If he did, Cruciatus seemed the
"We live in the Muggle world, Maman," Dantanian said slowly, looking to try and show off his understanding, "Because you like to do Muggle art, and not wizard art?"
And I won't reverse
"How?" Karkaroff asked eagerly. For a moment, he looked almost happy, like he thought he'd inadvertently hit the jackpot. With Periander gone, he might look to Draco as another potential protector. That was the nature of so many Death Eaters. Always looking for someone more powerful to hide behind like a coward, so they could deny they weren't powerful and deny they were cowards.
"I will, Draco, don't worry, I
"So dramatic. And what if it makes you hurt someone
The aftermath of the Dementors' search of the train was most obviously shown the next morning in Potter's glumness over at Gryffindor table, with Zacharias Smith over at Hufflepuff taking up Draco's mantle and doing an impression of Potter passing out in terror. Draco thought with irritation how much funnier his own had been, before taking the chance as he walked by that table to catch Smith's eye, stick out his tongue, and push it up with his finger to the roof of his mouth.
say that, Frankenstein, you pervert!" she hissed, and snatched the letter from him, only to see to her dismay that it did indeed read
"It's alright, Draco, he knew about Dantanian already," Luna chimed in. "That's too much to let Voldemort know from the start. I don't want you being the biggest target because of your wand."
Draco's memory came to him clearly. "I'd think it was a transparent attempt to manipulate the public. Remind them you're poor orphaned victim Potter who deserves their sympathy, all their coddling to make up for the parents he never had, so it's only right for him to be given the world."
Apparently, the once-strutting peacock was so ill-informed about the world, he had spoken glumly of the Dementors he thought he would be facing in Azkaban. The vampires had told Lockhart little beyond the rise of Voldemort. The Dark Lord's return had supposedly been an impetus making them bolder, with the eventual intent of joining him the way other dark creatures were. But the vampires hadn't specified Dementors in that group.
"It's not what you'd think? You don't have to tell us what you see..."
was it now? Which was what he had hoped for, what he had berated Potter over, so he couldn't start feeling bitter Granger and her boys were a package deal. "And... I suppose now that I'm getting on better with Harry and Ron, I hoped that all four of us could be friends."
"You should never have been allowed to set foot in the hallowed halls of Hogwarts, you disgraceful mutt," he snarled at Hermione.
"What?" Harry said blankly, seeming to search his mind for who he had just been dancing with. "What do you mean... Ginny? Ginny Weasley?"
secrets?" Draco said caustically, refusing to buy this. For all he knew, Severus had put Gilderoy up to it.
Draco screamed. And realized that Protego Diabolica Grindelwald had cast under such pain had been his final spell. He'd already taken the deathblow.
about us if we
The courtroom was a cavernous dungeon of a room, its insufficiently torch-lit confines like a place carved out of the depths of the earth. Draco had known Harry was going to testify in his trial, but unlike in Mother's case, he hadn't thought it would be enough. Drained of so much hope by the Dementors, he'd almost resented the interruption to the predictability of his regularly scheduled soul-draining, certain he would be returned there summarily until the end of his days. But like so many times, he had underestimated Harry. He hoped Fudge would be making the same mistake.
Harry stared with interest as they went through the Auror cubicles. Father had used to threaten Draco with signing him up to become an Auror if he was too badly-behaved. He hadn't been able to imagine anything more undignified than running around as a common member of
"You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just before- ah- the start of term?" Severus said, in a tone like he was wishing Peter out of existence.

Harry's eyes lit up, his forearm sliding along Draco's on the table. "You're going to sit with us at dinner too?"
"I don't have to answer to you," Draco said tonelessly, "I don't care what you think of me," and Potter shook his head, intensity sparking between them so much that Draco could practically feel Potter's magic brushing against his, like it was trying to push in.
"Who is the one foe no man can escape?"
to see the decorations."
"The Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this. It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so- either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that the world has not become a much more dangerous place will only put all of you in deeper peril."
could tell Harry. If he took Harry to Grindelwald,
"So, the Mirror of Espilce," said Grindelwald, with poppy seeds between his teeth. He licked them out leisurely as he reclined back on his vast pile of gold and bronze cushions. He seemed to be enjoying his reheated breakfast of mohnzelten with Kaisermelange, from the finest Viennese bakery Munich had to offer. It was Draco's third visit to Nurmengard, and he already had Grindelwald living like a king, or a Kaiser. Draco wouldn't think Fuhrer.
"Protego Diabolica!" he called, making the wand motion from the book, and nothing happened. "Protego Diabolica!" He made the motion the opposite way, and there was nothing. "Protego Diabolica!" He tried it the first way, and nothing still, though he saw blue sparks at the tip of the talon.
"You kissed me," Theo corrected mildly. "Although it hardly matters. Your housemates were so easy to Obliviate when they were that drunk. Even COUSIN!" He imitated Draco's fawning tone of voice perfectly, and some part of the past died, then and there. "You should have trained her up better, for her sake."
many Stunning charms," Severus said, "Even were you 24 and not 14, and even for a brief period. Hence the profound magical shock your body seems to have been submerged in. The charms you performed after, while impressive in their destructive force, are not outside your usual repertoire? I am so unfortunate a man as to have to postulate thus..." Draco nodded weakly.
"Because if you could enter someone," Ron panted, "You would have just entered yourself, because you know you'd

thing."
, before a historical telling-off. But Umbridge could just turn on her heel, smirk as if she'd had some great victory, and tell the court she had no more questions.
Potter laughed, more gentle than mocking, before raking a hand back through his unruly dark hair. "Anyway, I just- I'm glad you're alright. And I'll leave you alone, I will, just- I have something for you that I keep meaning to give you and I keep forgetting..."
"I just- you want me to be?" Draco asked, with a shyness he found embarrassing in himself, and got his shoulder shaken again by Sirius.
"Draco said Harry had the map," Black said in a dazed voice, as if Lupin had needed any more proof that Draco was more than an innocent bystander. He must have decided Draco had wanted to learn the Patronus to protect his Dementor-pursued uncle.
"No, like an ambush!" Luna said happily. "We think our aunt is coming to kill Draco and probably Harry, maybe also your parents, oh, and definitely Uncle Sirius, Dumbledore if he's there, it's really an exciting assemblage from a Death Eater perspective- and so we're planning a counter-ambush. A counter-trap! Isn't it exciting?"
"Azkaban," she said, and his smile grew wider.
"How are we going to rob Harry Potter of his blood?" she asked chipperly. "Will you bite his neck too hard giving him a hickey?"
"I am, I'm quitting our House team," Draco informed him, and Severus just stroked the back of his hand with a tired look.
"No," Draco said miserably. "I need the three mirrors. And more- even more than that, Striker, I can't- can't let anyone else-"
That was easy. "A crown," Draco said, although he might have also said,
Draco had been sure to place himself between Ron and Hermione, after all, barriers between himself and any unfortunate thoughts or urges towards Potter, who had seemed to feel shafted when Draco set their final sleeping order from left to right as Potter, Weasley, Malfoy, Granger.
such a strange burn on your hand,
Draco smiled. "You have no idea."
he thought in amazed incomprehension, as they entered a pub that seemed to attest to nothing about the owner but his lack of interest in sanitation. Draco had never so much as gone close to the window of such an outré establishment, but he did have to smile and stare for a while at the battered old rusty sign, with the head of the titular hog no cutesy cartoon pig but a real severed head, which bled eternally for the onlookers. He produced the reloaded Polaroid camera Hermione had given him so long ago, enchanted by now to work even at Hogwarts, let alone in its vicinity, and took an admiring shot of the head, artistically skewed. "See, definitely too fond of decapitation," he heard Ron mutter to Neville as they made their way inside.
"He has very green eyes. You might do well to add that to his list of accomplishments. Yes, quite the specimen indeed," Grindelwald cooed, as if he had a pet Rottweiler who'd just brought him back a particularly intriguing decapitated head. "But- the slayer of dark lords? Should I be quavering?"
"Give her some time to cool off," Draco advised.
"Okay, yeah, one of you will have to kill the other," Draco said with a shrug, "Stands to reason."
," Theo said quietly. "Hurt others, or itself."
The world did not go up in flames, only in screaming. Voldemort screamed like a siren going off and flew backwards, before crumbling to the ground only just before his followers who were still half on fire. The potion had hit the right side of his face squarely, and the smooth white snake flesh there was melting away, dripping down clean off the bone in pus-like rivulets of white and wine red. He clawed at his face and more flesh came away, left side of his face getting mottled with it, as his palms smeared it across that as well. He left holes in his cheeks, spots of brighter white that Draco did not understand, until he saw the skin was liquefying and peeling away down to the bone.
"My name is Draco Malfoy," Draco said, and he could see that from her widening eyes she knew the surname, at least. Elves tended to be more aware of inter-family politics, he had learned from Dobby, than their owners ever gave them credit for. "Are you alright?" She was hiding her face behind her hands like she thought he might hit her. "I'm not angry at you, Winky, don't hide."
The only surprise in Defense came at the end, when a hand seized him by the arm to drag him around the corner once he emerged. Draco didn't even try to struggle. He recognized the hand and its grip already. "Hey, Harry," he drawled, trying not to look pleased to see that handsome anxious face insert itself in his vision. "You shouldn't let Umbridge see you hanging around. I'm not exactly her favorite. And she's not scared of
," Gilderoy was saying, in a very uncontrolled, rash tone. "I
"What happened to them?"
But he found that he couldn't.
"Lower your voice, just because it's his mother's house doesn't mean it's any less dangerous than last time-"
Draco had planned to be, but his instinct was to be contrary. "Oh, I haven't decided. It would be a hassle to rearrange my study schedule, which I take very seriously because I'm going to be an Unspeakable, so..."
His first instinct was the truth, and damn what happened to Dobby after. He didn't know if it had been against the rules or just the spirit of them, for Dobby to help Draco the way he had. But no configuration of those would save Dobby from his father's wrath, a more convenient scapegoat than the only heir. At 11, Draco might have enjoyed watching the elf take the punishment destined for Draco, before he had seen enough punishments to lose his taste for them. He would have turned Dobby over to Father anyway, if Dobby had been just any elf. But he was Potter's. He was meant to save Potter in the future from this Manor, from Aunt Bella with this terrible wand in her hand. Dobby was meant to be a war hero, bizarrely enough, and if Father hurt him too badly or killed him, that might be enough to make Potter and his pet Weasel and Mudblood perish that night. Because Salazar knew Draco would never have the strength, not if he travelled back and forth a thousand years, to be the one to save them.
"I would think you'd find it nice, sir," she said primly, "That we feel safe here, after the end of last year," and if Draco hadn't immediately stepped between, Draco gave it about a fifty-fifty chance that Severus would have unleashed his verbal venom and made Hermione cry on
"Luna," Draco lied, "There's no one I want to take
Draco didn't curse any of the people who looked at him that way. What was the point?
"What are you going to do to me?" Theo asked, a pronounced pallor to his angular visage. Draco smirked, unable not to enjoy the sensation of being imposing when it came to Theo. In the blue loop, he'd been hard-pressed to intimidate Theo no matter what he did, even with a Dark Mark on his wrist.
Severus's empty face flashed with annoyance. "Those two are still alive, I assure you-"
The more I know, the more I can protect all of you. Yeah, bodies haven't been dropping yet, but believe me, it's coming. And once the Dark Lord fully understands what we did to him with the Naufragiam? I know it will be a struggle to keep all of us alive. Especially Luna."
Weasley stepped out of the way. Draco was gratified by the knowledge he hadn't seen Weasley in all his shallow Gryffindor glory, so Weasley shouldn't able to see whatever vision the mirror conjured up for him. He was doubly glad Weasley couldn't see, when the suggestion of his reflection disappeared completely, to replace it with only Harry Potter. He looked as he had in the dim light of the Quidditch shed, when he confronted Draco over Finnigan, poised right on the edge of saying or doing something irrevocable- except it was Draco on that edge, but Draco had disappeared. Potter looked out at him from inside the mirror, with that fierce look that never failed to split him in two, that look that Draco could travel seven or a hundred years and never escape-
The wizarding world will surely be troubled by the association of the famous Chosen One with an individual of such a dark reputation. Yet Mr. Potter and Mr. Black have reportedly flaunted their romance. "Harry Potter bought his boyfriend a necklace with his initials on it, HJP," says Alice Whittaker, an employee at the fine dress shop Madam Malkin's. "They kissed right in front of me afterwards. I thought they seemed very sweet and in love." Mr. Black is said to wear this necklace daily to his classes at Hogwarts. He has proved appreciative of expensive presents from Mr. Potter and his family since he was disowned from the Malfoy fortune.
"Alright!" Draco called. "Cousin Tonks! Guess that makes us officially Team Black. Team Weasley, it is
"Wait, we're still doing that game?" Lamia groaned, and looked around the Ravenclaw table. Either none of their friends were there, or the two outcasts were still yet to make any more, even by fourth year. "Give up already, Malfoy, the only extraordinary things about Daniel are his ego and his hair."
"I know he did!" Pansy shrieked, and there it was, the last piece of the puzzle, if Luna had needed it.
"Abraxas?" the boy said, frowning at him in dismay. That gave Draco a last bit of certainty he hadn't needed.
Unless that
"He seems like a very private man," Draco said, and Lockhart nodded in agreement.
, he almost said. But however much Theo claimed not to like boys, Draco still had enough suspicion of his feelings for that to potentially seem cruel. "Anyone here to care for my beautiful hair the way Luna-Luna does... I missed you so much..." He cast a look at his dormmates, who were listening unabashedly, then pulled her in, closed the curtains, and cast Inmotus.
"Where?" Draco asked, and Remus's brown eyes sparkled.
"Expecto patronum!"
"Draco is trying to be nice, Ronald," Hermione sighed, "Do be kind and reciprocate," and Potter took the paper and read over the article himself with a frown.
"Draco," Neville whispered. "What did you
Severus's hands dropped from Draco's shoulders. "And so," he sighed, "From what I gather, you addressed this situation not by correcting it before it could do damage... not by surreptitiously slipping it out of the girl's things, which your friendship with Gryffindors could have granted you access to, without even the need for magic. And then you could have brought it to me in secret. But you unceremoniously seized the offending object from the hands of the girl, inside
Potter had to lie down beside him to catch all of his whispering, though he hardly could have looked more petrified if it had been a Dementor crawling over his sheets. "I was having a nightmare, Draco. About my parents. And I woke up and saw you..."
-" Harry shot Draco a nervous glance through his eyelashes, a flash of sudden furtive attention that made Draco's heart go a little faster. "No, if
Draco shifted his feet shyly. "You will be after today, won't you? Don't worry, I'll figure out how to get you on the tapestry this summer..."
"Oh, you
Percy drew himself up, very calm and steady. "Ah, yes, you're right," he said, loud enough for half the ballroom to hear, with a slow quiet song and many people already having been trying to listen in on the Chosen One's very public three-person spat. "Mr. Crouch
"Take your hands off my cousin," Draco hissed in a voice more animal than human, "Or I'll take your hands off your
It was a horrible thing to do, that way of calling in the debt, but call it in Draco did. And it worked, as Draco had known it would. "Yes," Gilderoy said with a fearful glint in his blue eyes, gone wide and haunted and slightly distance. "Yes, you're right. Yes, I'll do it." He walked over to Grindelwald and offered his hand. Grindelwald seemed surprised and a bit pleased by the texture of Gilderoy's palm in his. He wouldn't have expected it to be nearly as rough and worn as his own.
Voldemort gave Father the wand, and Father pressed it into Harry's hand, before rushing back to take Draco by the shoulders and keep him there. Harry rose to his feet, and seemed to consider fleeing, before the circle of Death Eaters closed the gaps, taking all a step closer to where the circle was filled by Malfoys, the Dark Lord, the Boy Who Lived, and the corpse of Peter Pettigrew.
It was causing such an immediate furor that Draco and Harry must indeed
The more he read on tracking charms, the more he realized how fickle they could be, and the more things he found that he might have done wrong himself. It had probably been his own mistake. And it wasn't like any other wands worked for him anyway.
look.
Draco gave himself a few moments snuggling into the covers, burying his face into the generous pile of furry black pillows, before peeling his face off the top one again, and making the incredible effort of forcing his eyes open. Several such aborted attempts let him know he was indeed in Severus's rooms, in the sparse, barren room where his fireplace and armchairs had once been, migrated to another after he and then Draco had destroyed the wall behind the tapestry, by distrust. Draco lay in a bed that had not been there before, with a warmth accumulated from his body under the covers that he was reluctant to let dissipate, even though his mind had the dim awareness that once it got itself thinking past the most essential questions, an abyss awaited him...
"I'll let you go to your meeting on one condition!"
"A word, Mr. Potter," Severus intoned, forestalling Potter's attempt to follow Draco. And Draco found himself standing outside Potions, waiting for Potter to come out like a simpering fanboy, until the realization Potter probably just wanted to talk about how evil he thought Draco's godfather was made his Malfoy pride send him stomping away.
Draco delivered his objective assessment of Harry's lessons, perhaps more positive than strictly truthful, with only half his mind on it. The rest of him was wrestling with himself. He had thought he would feel differently, more magnanimous about Harry's adoption, after their relationship changed.
Draco flew, making for the crack in the darkness around them where the Dementors were fleeing, and in his final glance back, telling himself he was not a coward leaving the only godfather he had to die, he could see the deer charging about the ground and then into the air, making all the Dementors scatter and separate again, and its ears were small and rounded, the shape delicate in its ethereal beauty, and it almost reminded Draco of Potter, when they played Quidditch together at midnight. It was a deer, but not a stag. And it was beautiful.
Neville looked so unjustifiably grateful, it was agony to behold. "Thank you, Draco. I can't believe you would do that for me..."
to his strengths."
," Severus snapped. "There will
Draco yawned more forcefully, stretching his jaw wide like a lion, and found himself too drowsy to care if it looked undignified in front of Potter. "Yes, so worry about that first, and
Had you no fear you would be unmasked?"
The years had passed, with Lockhart the one human ever alive for long at Castell de L'Infern. In this rather high-octane study abroad experience, Lockhart had learned decent amounts of Catalan, Spanish, French, and a number of spells related to castle-building, as well as closing wounds. This repertoire of necessity was narrow but potent. It included powerful-sounding animation spells. The most interesting was a variant on Piertotum Locomotor called Piertotum Corporestitur, which for rebuilding a castle allowed the caster to direct the armor and statues- or, say, perhaps,
Krum blinked. "You did not give the specific time."
him-"
"You just make the best noises," Harry whispered, "When I bite your neck," and did again to demonstrate. Draco whimpered despite himself, though he glared at Harry after. Harry attacked Draco's mouth until he was flat prone on his back again, their legs starting to fall entwined together, and Draco tried to keep his mind on something besides just Harry.
"Who is that?" Harry said, coming out at the unfamiliar voice, then froze. "Is that- are you Professor Lockhart?" he asked dubiously, and Gilderoy looked thrilled at his reunion with another student, starting the cycle all over again.
Practical
him on the agenda?"
Draco bit back a complaint, because she wasn't completely wrong. Call it a distinction between the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. "Forget it. You want Gryffindor to win. And you've been hanging out with Potter and Ron all the time, why should I care what you think?"
Draco stared down at the L that had simply appeared there.
"What do you think?" Draco whispered. "Would it suit me?" It couldn't be any more horrifying for his godfather to see than what would hopefully be a Gryffindor tie around his neck.
"Okay, okay," Draco said, smiling brightly, and wrote Sirius's name. "Filicida remittetur," he said, and just like that, Sirius reappeared on the tapestry.
"What," Severus said with an unsuspecting sigh, "Is it you are so aggrieved to have lost?"
Draco managed to tire himself out regardless, though, with further experimentations with the Mirror of Espilce and fire. He felt unaccountably exhausted after his labors of testing, so he dragged himself to bed for a well-earned nap.
"Like what?" Potter asked, and Draco looked up, fearing Ron would end up feeling neglected and unwanted anyway, after all this fuss for his sake. "What can we do together?"
In one way, he wouldn't have been surprised if his Boggart had been Potter himself.
Ruthlessness
Suffering Granger's company was not just implausibly unpalatable, it was a change to the past he could not afford.
have known, should have known protection would have done nothing to win the loyalty of a man whose sole drive in his remaining life did not seem in truth survival, but revenge-
Hermione had Arithmancy with Draco first thing in the morning. That was strange, given that he'd overheard her in the Great Hall, telling Potter and Ron she'd see them in a minute in Divination, but Draco was too distracted to wrap his mind around the rigors of Hermione's schedule.
"You go," Draco said with a sigh. "I have to send an owl to Uncle Sirius."
"Second-favorite?"
They piled into Mundungus Fletcher's Muggle car without Harry and Sirius, and Draco was glad of his experience riding in these before. He would have hated to act the way he did his first time in front of all the others. But he didn't stop Hermione from telling them all the story of Draco's first ever car ride in the 'family beast' that he thought had eaten his luggage. Draco caught Luna looking rather reassured by this narrative, given that she'd taken a solid physical dragging by Draco inside in order to be convinced it was safe. And the 'Draco vs. Muggle London' horror story at least kept Mrs. Weasley from breaking into sobs again over the absence of Percy. As if Draco had needed another reason to keep Percy firmly at the bottom of the Weasley ranking.
Aesthetic appreciation was superseded by irritation at that point. "Listen, I don't care how cross you are at me that your godfather gave me a Firebolt too-" Harry looked surprised at that, as if his reservations hadn't actually stemmed from that quarter, but Draco plowed on. "I'm not going to argue with you, because it's not my choice. If you drag your feet, I'll tell Hermione, and you can argue it with
Harry imitated what Draco did, with more enthusiasm. There seemed to be a natural tendency in him to apply pressure, to try to take the lead and dominate the kiss. It just made Draco feel even needier, like he should never have let himself be alone with Harry. Once he started, it was too hard to stop, too explosive where their bodies touched. Harry's hands slipped down from Draco's hips to cup his arse, and Draco whimpered against his mouth.
"It won't be the same without Hagrid and Professor McGonagall," Hermione said sadly, and Draco seized her shoulders and made them sway with a goofy grin.
good, you're
, period, but he gave you just a clue. A series of hoops to jump through. Really not the fair play he would probably claim it to be, the sod-"
Pansy's voice that came down to him then was pitying. "Draco," she said, "The woman didn't speak."
He'd actually surprised Grindelwald. You always knew when that happened, because he'd stop running his trap for more than a second or two.
you..."
- maybe to hurt Draco by it- but if his progressively worsening suspicions about Theo were true, the last thing he should do was admit there was still a very strong attachment between himself and the supposed Death Eater. "What were you stealing? What were you trying to steal?"
Severus tilted his head. "If one is willing to be taught."
, to think I care an iota more for the worthless life of this simpering child than any other at this school. Believe me, I would relish the excuse to punish this nuisance for all of his
There were gasps, with Ron staring at Scrimgeour hatefully. "Bloody hell, did you really say that?
Mr. and Mrs. Granger seemed utterly at a loss what to make of Draco, whether he was being sarcastic, rude, confused, or simply a bit insane. "Oh, Draco," Hermione sighed for what felt like the tenth time. "These are Muggle pictures. I've told you about them, remember? They just don't move about the way Wizarding pictures do."
☒1: Shielding: Protego, Protego horribilis, Fianto duri
in Mad-Eye Moody seemed lamentably removable to Draco, as the class began with Crouch telling the students they wouldn't need their books. When Theo persisted in leaving his out, never one quick to put away a book, just in as in the blue loop, Crouch transfigured it into a rather grumpy and foul-smelling iguana.
Potter flinched, then cast a nervous look at Ron and Hermione bickering in front of the boat before leaning over and whispering, "I was almost sorted Slytherin, you know."

But how would
"You can! You can! My little dark lord! You can!" Grindelwald cried out in ecstatic, bloodthirsty confidence, "I cannot, you can, Kaktusblüte-"
"Pardon me if I do not take your judgment as gospel. Truly no alteration since last Sunday, despite the additions made to the solution? And you have been assiduous in its application?" His eyes ran up and down the lean form perched beside him, a stare of clinical and scientific assessment that would have made more sense if he could have seen Gilderoy's scars through his clothing.
of class." Severus was surreptitiously rubbing his hip where it had hit the desk. He looked intent on causing similar pain in Harry. "We shall test your wordless jinxes as well, Draco. Class, come and observe."
When not one but two people asked Draco out on Saturday, he figured that was his cue to get himself moving. Not to secure a date, but to be sure his friends were adequately provided for. Not Ron and Potter- if they didn't seem inclined towards the Patil twins, he could try and give them a push, but otherwise, the bad experience they both seemed to have had last time would be salutary. He couldn't in his right conscience deprive them of that chance at character-building. No, paternalistic as it was, it was his female friends he had to sort out- Hermione first, whether Krum would be again allowed to take her, and then Luna, whether she would go. As he could recall, he hadn't seen her at the Yule Ball. But she'd seemed to enjoy the Malfoy gala so much, he would have to find someone, if not worthy of his cousin, at least who he felt comfortable trusting her with.
your idea, right? You read the articles. He was helping with rebuilding their creepy vampire sex murder den. And Sirius and Remus are rebuilding the citadel. Have the Ministry turn him over to Dumbledore's custody, and serve his confinement on the Isle of Xaphan, instead of the island of Azkaban. Easy as."
"Oh no," Potter said glumly, bright fierce eyes dimming as he looked down at the sullied Snitch in his hand. "I caught the Snitch."
"Well-reasoned," the knocker said, and Ravenclaw Tower opened for him.
a great candidate for last heir of House Black. That's why he chose me! Because Aunt Bella, she's on our family's side, but me- he's going to have me kill all of us, isn't he? The dragon and the fucking stag! No- Trelawney, the stag-"
"Yes, I was."
Ron drew himself up tall, and Draco could hear his father in his voice as he said, cool as ice, "Oh, I think we all have a different idea of what disgraces the name of Hogwarts, Mr. Malfoy."
"No," Harry said, ignoring him, and rubbed at his scar. Draco considered, then grabbed Harry by the shoulder, rolled him over, and began to poke insistently at his scar. "Hey! What are-"
, and the day one is born is hardly any great accomplishment- really, it's an arbitrary choice of celebration-" Her lower lip began to quiver quite mightily. "It's just, no one's even told me happy birthday."
, with this tainted blood, tainted wand- tainted money, tainted magic, this evil fucking heart in my chest- I'm never... never... never never
"My wand," Draco blurted, for the lack of anything else in the world to say. "My wand started, I don't know, reacting to it. I got a feeling from it there was something awful nearby. Something worse than any magical object I've encountered. My wand seemed to know it."
"Harry," Draco breathed. "Harry, did you come back to Ravenclaw Tower last night?"
"You don't live with your father anymore, though," Theo said softly, dark blue eyes a distressing piece of loveliness, for the threat of pity held in them. "Do you."
Hermione and her mother were also glum. But Draco was more amazed than anything by the spectacle of the affair, organized in such scale without any magic. If the team he had chosen to support had performed poorly, well, that was only a bonus. It made him feel less like some glory-hunting Montrose Magpies fan. And he did enjoy the chant the Arsenal fans made in response to the loss:
"This is what you saw in the Mirror of Erised," Draco realized suddenly, making sure to speak quietly. "Parents lost in the war, magically restored to their son's side, all his family around him again. It's just that it's happening for someone else."
Broken glass rained down on Draco, and he screamed.
"And you loved every second," Draco drawled, bumping his hip against Harry's. "You don't need to go to all this trouble, you know. You've already got me, you don't need to woo me with flowers-"
"No, it's alright, Minister, you don't
"Theo, you-" Draco tried to speak, but he had to try hard, through a throat tying itself in knots. He wanted some draught of peace, but he'd already drank his draught today. If he tried to drink the one vial in his pocket, he'd be imbibing liquid Fiendfyre. Even if that was rather what it felt like to face Theo. "You win, alright? You- you're smarter than me, you've proven it, you've won, can we please just stop this, this Death Eater act, alright, just be Theo again-"
Draco couldn't even follow what he was saying anymore. "Charlie Weasley was a champion Seeker. And they say he's gay and good-looking..."
"I take it you found your gargoyles," Draco said shakily, but didn't manage to make Gilderoy smile.
Draco answered with an eye-roll at the predictability, always chomping at the bit when it came to the smallest factoids about his godson. "Hey, Meatball. Well, there's a girl, Cho Chang, a year above us. The Ravenclaw Seeker. You just missed seeing them play at the match last week." He rolled his eyes again at Black's regretful look, delivered in a disarmingly puppyish fashion while he snarfed down Hagrid's rock-like cakes in his dirty hands like they were made of ambrosia. "Potter fancies her, that's all, and I think a rumor's gone around school about it somehow."
"Wanna show him, captain?" Draco drawled. Harry's green eyes went bright again at another ill-considered nickname.
Again, it seemed to have floated near the direction of Remus's lawn chair, who yelped and jumped off, rolling out of the way while struggling to keep his most recent vodka martini upright. Draco went into a dive of his own following Millie's shout. Harry would have beaten him easily, should the Snitch not have flitted beneath the slots of the chair. Harry crashed into the chair, hand groping through the chair in desperation. Draco rolled over his broom with what he thought a rather stylish flair, and shoved his hand under the chair to pluck it out from below, just an inch from Harry's fingertips.
to- Professor Sprout made him stay-"
"I like you," Theo insisted, taking a deep breath, and then leaned forward and tried to kiss Draco.
Squeezing his eyes shut tighter, Draco let himself slide out of Severus's chair to the ground, wiping angrily at his face with the sleeves of his robe, with his nose starting to stop up like breath wouldn't go through it even if his lungs were working properly. He opened them to glare as he heard Ron and Potter settle on the ground beside him, with the gall to have these genuinely worried-looking expressions on their faces. "Don't worry, blunderbusses," Draco panted, "It will pass, I'm not going to die," and Potter grabbed him by the shoulders like he thought Draco was dying already.
"Harry loves my hair! Oh, what a great signal I still want to be with him, he asks for space and I get rid of his favorite physical feature of mine."
Thomas seemed favorably impressed when Draco talked about learning how to play with the Grangers. And Draco drew more attention, when that led to the disclosure that Draco had spent two weeks in the Muggle world with Hermione.

- I left home after fifth year to live with other family, a
Then they reached row 90 and heard voices. "Homenum revelio," Draco whispered, and saw the distinct outline in blue of two figures behind rows of the dusty crystal balls. A tall one was standing over a smaller male figure on the ground. There were more figures standing around them, in long robes from the outlines, with voices audible now. Some of them sounded very familiar. There was Vince's father, Theo's father, Greg's father, and on it went. There looked to be almost a dozen of them: Death Eaters, surely, to accompany Father, and they had them outnumbered...
"Thank you," Luna said, and then her eyes widened with what she looked to find a marvelous idea. "Would you like to help me sell them?"
Ron was full of opinions on the matter, as it turned out. After a notice went up in the common rooms, Ron was suddenly more anxious about the Apparition test than both dark lords put together- Draco supposed he should say all
"Draco, hey, are you gonna- oh, um, hey. Draco," Theo said, walking past, only for his head to turn and for him to walk right back over. "Wow, uh, you look, er, good in Muggle clothes. Uh-"

did. And now our Defense professor does. I hate it so much! If they
"It's another surprise," Draco said, the words and actions coming into his mind as surely as if Felix Felicis was guiding him. As if they were perched on the symbol of Hecate, the balance between perfection and doom braced on either side of the hurtling wheel. "Close your eyes. You can't have your surprise unless you close them."
"Theo," Draco said, rolling his eyes and descending to his step, "I guarantee you, if you're not the best choice for Chaser, I will not put you on the team, end of-"
"Oh, I'm not trying to

"I'm sorry I pulled your hair earlier," Harry whispered against Draco's knuckles. "It was an awful kiss. I can't sleep thinking how stupid I was. I've been worried about Mr. Weasley, of course, but- I can't stop thinking of that either. Please just tell me you aren't angry-"
Apart from their new hoard of books, the weeks that followed were less eventful, with no blood magic actually performed. At least Draco did have cause to be glad he'd not taken Care of Magical Creatures, when he heard they were working with unicorns. The stories of unicorns greatly favoring virgins were false, but they could definitely be more ornery towards those who weren't. Draco didn't know if he counted, in a body that had never so much as been kissed. He was falling quickly behind his blue loop self in that department. But best not to risk it.
It was as good as a dismissal, and yet Draco followed. "What, are you mad none of your friends got you anything? I know the Weasel is poor, but Potter's got loads of Galleons-"
"It would be as hard for me to be
On an impulse, Draco raised his wand to the Snitch and concentrated. Its material wasn't that different from ones he had transfigured for jewelry before. There were enchantments woven into the very fibers of it, but protections of that sort never seemed to do much against the talon wand. He remembered the display Lockhart had made for Severus, and the gardens at the Manor. Then with an ease he smugly exaggerated, he transfigured the Snitch into a long-stemmed golden rose, each individual petal delicate and distinct.
"Yes, Harry," Luna said, rolling her eyes. She pulled Neville to sit beside her on the rug and kissed him again. "Oh, Neville, you have to be my boyfriend again, please say you will!" Neville nodded with a stupid grin on his face, before indulging Luna in everything she asked for.
"3... 2... 1..." the voice from Draco's watch recited. Draco shut off the countdown as cheers exploded from downstairs, and then there was the rumbling of fireworks outside. His room didn't have windows, but the impression of intermittent brightness filtered through with the booms, diffused flashes of lightning over the face of Harry waking.
"No promises," Draco said, and was gratified to see Potter and Weasley subsequently disappear from their table. Granted, that meant that on the rare times that the blunderbusses did remember Hogwarts had a library, Granger would invariably be seated at another table with them, but it wasn't as if he missed her. He didn't protest when she called him her friend these days, it was too much work, but he wouldn't personally use a word stronger than study partner, and that would fade in time too. She'd taken up wearing the bracelet he'd given her every day, but why wouldn't she? If it was fit for Narcissa Malfoy, it was more than fit for an 11-year-old Gryffindor.
"He did try and help a bit," Gilderoy said defensively. "You saw they've bettered. And it was my idea he claim to be meeting your uncles while we were working, and he would go back to the library by himself to read- if you have to blame anyone, blame me-"
"Shut up," Harry muttered, looking sheepish. "I just miss when we lived just next door. I get worried when you disappear and I don't know why..."
"Do you think Neville is still alive?" Ron blurted.
Draco could not resist the urge to look at Theo when Dumbledore alluded, however obliquely, to dark forces trying to enter Hogwarts, Severus's promises notwithstanding. But Theo was just listening, and if his eyes hadn't been so shadowed, his face would have worn the same calm intelligent look as if his father was safe at home, sending book recommendations and sake...
"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."
Draco expected that to be just about the end to his natural existence, but Crouch finally just turned away and began harassing Severus. Which was wrong on so many levels, but Draco could barely hear them over the relief of not being exposed. "Why didn't he turn us in?" he hissed to Harry, and Draco put a finger to his lips.
Hermione's parents had been unwilling to take his money to pay them back for his ticket like he'd wanted, and inexplicably dismayed at a minor calculating error he'd made.
Theo smiled, face unbearably handsome in the firelight. His deep blue eyes held the balance of every constellation in the sky frozen in them.
Potter looked guilty. "He woke up and saw Ron and I missing, and, well, after the midnight duel he got caught up in, I think he worried we were up to something like that again, and went out to find us and bring us back."
, though Draco's hints about Severus teaching it to him were met with glares. Severus brought an ample supply of dittany to apply in the week to come, leaving no doubt that even impaired, he expected Draco to be more than capable of making it into a paste by himself.
to me, Harry Potter, the one I most wanted to meet..."
Potter looked inexplicably nervous. "Thank you, Draco," he said softly. "For helping Hagrid like that, even though it could have meant your wand. I can't believe that you did that. Thank you," he said, and leaned forward and kissed Draco on the cheek, before pulling them through the barrier together.
Draco picked up the figure with the discarded blue line still hovering forlornly over its head. "So except if it's some alternate dimension, there's only one body, so the loop can't happen, and there's no original future to go back to." McGonagall nodded. "So it's not a question of messing up a past. Everything is happening for everyone for the first time in the world here. Except the traveler." Draco ran the figure over the red line with the feeling of a dream, then began to take notes again. It was that or start screaming. "So... the traveler can't screw up the past, because there is no past?"
It was impossible to tell what it was for some time, uselessly wiping at it with his hands and sleeves, only getting it filthier and bloodier. Then he realized how he could see what it was, and plunged his arm with it elbow-deep into the snow. When he pulled his arm out, finally, he was shivering as well as sobbing, and the object he had taken from inside the torn chest of Grindelwald's he had cut open was showing him back his own reflection. It was a mirror.
Ron gasped, while Potter got that incredible calm command on his face that he had when negotiating with Aragog. "I'm going down there," he said, and Draco resisted the urge to kiss him on the cheek again.
to discuss the Mirror of Espilce, yesterday morning. It was your agitation, at the revelations about the second mirror, that required that discussion's postponement-"
Dobby was looking hesitant and rather queasy. "Master Draco is wanting a wand, and Dobby only knows of this one, but Master Draco should know this wand is-"
us to think the worst of you!"
"Severus, you... you were punished, weren't you? For what I did? The after-effects... the color of your eyes, your ears, the base of your nails...
"Don't worry, Striker," Draco said facetiously, "My beautiful totems will protect you from the nefarious Prisoner of Azkaban," and made her giggle.
"When did you first meet Pammaque Periander, and what was your relationship?" Hermione asked calmly, and Draco was grateful to her for taking this part on. He leaned over Luna's shoulder to watch her making notes, then got out his own parchment and cast a dictation charm, turning his quill to something like Rita Skeeter's for the moment. Although this was one of those ways that wizards liked to ignore that Muggles had it more efficient. If they'd had one, they could have just turned on a Muggle video camera or tape recorder.
Draco got to sleep late, having had to have an infusion bath, as much from mental as physical or magical exhaustion in truth. He had also gotten advice on brewing draught of peace from Severus before he left, along with assurances they would be covering be it this year in Potions, as standard for the curriculum. A final look showed Draco that in Severus's mind, the issues they had discussed in the dueling room were far from settled.
"Yes,
"How'd you like that?" Draco would ask Dantanian after. Or, "Performance review? You know, I take requests..." But even that was not enough to bestir Dantanian to speech. And so in his bed Draco remained, at a remove from everyone. A safe distance, most of the time, from almost all of his nine names. That was where all the monsters that could hurt them belonged.
didn't like it, Potter must be thinking, it
The dragon was as brilliant as any Patronus that Draco had ever seen. Remus had done a good job teaching him in the end- if Remus was even still alive, if he was going to survive this night, him or Sirius- but Draco couldn't afford to think of anyone but Harry, who had Dementors crouched over him still-
She had the power to wake the other portraits, who began a merry chorus of
He might just have gotten away with it, however murderous Hermione was starting to look, if Myrtle hadn't chosen that moment to insert her two undead cents. "That's not what
"No, I mean, I guess I was just wondering if you would be at the match?"
WITH HIM! YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME!"
"Bonsoir," said an affected young voice, and a small pointy pale face inserted itself between Dantanian and the lights. "I didn't see you on the train." The boy was very blond and slender, though taller than nearly all the students around them, and had his silky silver hair cut neatly just above his shoulders. A few other boys flanked him, with more ordinary faces. "Were you hiding?"
And the red line's Theo had committed the similar offense of
with you, and I never wanted to be. I've always wanted this feeling to go away, and it never has, no matter what I do, I just can't make it
"Draco," Potter said slowly, "Those are girl's pajamas." When Draco emerged from the en suite bathroom undeterred in Luna's largest set of pajamas, oversized enough to fit him, Potter nearly fell off his top bunk at the sight.
my fault the school thinks you fancy her, you did your share of sniffing around after her-"
"First year, actually, wasn't it?"
Hermione eyed the chandelier serpent, and then the candelabras and wall sconces, all of which were that same distinctive serpent shape. "Say what you will about the need for a serious uptick in house elf retention," Draco whispered, "You can admire the consistency of motif-"
It all went so much worse than Draco could have even predicted. For starters, he was thoughtless, and woke Severus up barging into his chambers. Severus informed Draco that he would speak to him at noon, when he would wake up for lunch, and went back to bed. So of course Draco used that opportunity to scour the shelves of Severus's private library, on the off chance there was anything that could help with this or the challenges of the whole year, but shockingly enough, the books were almost entirely about potions.
"Not Lovegood!" one of Cho's friends yelped. "Cho doesn't mean Lovegood, please don't hurt her..."
"You'll go in together," Draco said decisively. "He'll help you in and out, to make sure you don't freeze or drown, isn't that nice? Remember, Gilderoy, complete immersion."
Draco knew the voice even before the darker-skinned green blur came into more focus before him. "Blaise," he whimpered. He tried to drag his weightless, floppy-seeming body up by his elbows and got nowhere. But then he felt the once familiar feeling of Vince and Greg at either side of him, pulling him up, and Theo touching his face, asking him if he could hear him.
wizard of a generation came of age.
He directed Claudius to wait in the Owlery for him to send it back out. Oh, he would write Father an answer. Tomorrow. Maybe, if he felt like it. Or the next day, whenever he had some spare time. But he had more important things to do at the moment than appeasing Voldemort's preeminent bootlicker. He had a Muggleborn to find a birthday present.
Except Severus, from that attempt as his secret admirer, but that hadn't exactly panned out. "I'm gay, you know," Draco said bluntly. "So the part that it's a man doesn't bother me."
"What is wrong with you?" Harry demanded, voice free to rise with Inmotus in place. "WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?"
"From everything Luna had written about you, I know you like to play the hero. And once your Mudblood whore had been taken-"

"For someone so famous, he's rather bashful and humble, isn't he?" she mused.
Tryouts for Seekers in Slytherin, apart from participation in the other drills, consisted of a set of three one-on-one games. The other Slytherins flew down and dismounted, staring up from the grass while Flint hovered ready to release the Snitch. If his deal with Father had not been sufficient to reconcile Draco to fighting for a position he had not initially wanted, the collective front of opposition from Slytherin's older players
"Well," Draco said with a grin, "That's what I'd say about my favorite cousin too. Sounds like we're in agreement!"
"Oh, I wore that the night of the Third Task," Draco said absently, "So I don't remember exactly, but it must have broken at some point in the graveyard," only to wilt under their stricken stares. "What? You asked. Should I have thrown the thing out? Performed an exorcism? The set's not complete without it." He had the feeling the dragons and their chain would be the last presents he got from Mother for a while, if ever. "Its wing is ugly, yeah, but I'm getting around to fixing it."
"Hello, I'm Luna," she said brightly, "And I think you ought to be killed."
"Either you have improved at lying," Severus sighed, "Or I have worsened at detecting it. Yet why this hurry, Draco? Why this frantic manner of questioning, and this surreptitious look in your eye now, like there is something still you do
"Two figures," Draco said, "Instead of only one."
"An invention of yours?"
Then Bole came stomping in with the beleaguered air of a Beater pressed into service as an owl, one too intimidated to say no to either party. "He says that if you don't come, he'll wait out there all night."
"Are you talking to me about
But Potter looked tempted, torn almost, especially when Black came up behind Draco and seized his shoulders, shaking him eagerly. "Do it, Draco," Black urged. "End him, now."
"No," Potter said, visibly struggling to keep his composure. He lay down on the bed, facing him on his side. Draco had lain in the same position with Hermione, back when they visited each other's families, a lifetime ago. "No, that... would not be good, no."

kill him- if not because of me, then- then because- but no, no one listens to me, no one
Headmaster Dumbledore. Aren't we supposed to be 'Dumbledore's Army'?" To which Draco wanted to retort that the Grindelwald situation was too personal to Dumbledore for the man to be objective, but he held his tongue.
Something cold slimed its way down Draco's spine. He told himself it was January wind, but he still wrapped his arms tightly around himself, against its bone-chill. "Why would Theo be happy?" he asked, more softly than he meant to. He felt his teeth chatter, like his warming charms had been mere empty noise. "You think something that would make
taking proceedings, eyes darting around like they were about to fall out of her head, but he persisted. It was not until he took out his talon wand and tapped it against the bloodied serpent that the door swung open.
Luna insisted on helping, though Colovaria was not a charm she had technically learned yet. He only trusted her on his less valued items at first. Once she proved a good hand, though, he let her work on everything, even silk and cashmere. She managed to get his sets of silk pajamas, for one, perfectly Ravenclaw blue, before he went to bed. And even if he didn't get to kiss Harry goodnight anymore, at least he got to give a goodnight hug to Luna, with the impression that she would be expecting one nightly from her favorite cousin.
Say one thing for being Lord Malfoy. The Lord was in possession of an astonishingly extensive wine cellar.

I'm pleased to hear you've found the textbook we gave you useful. I used that textbook myself, when I spent miserable summers in empty rooms at Grimmauld Place, practicing every spell I could think of try and get stronger. Sometimes it was my only consolation, that even if my family didn't believe what I did, and probably never would, that at least I could do a spell right. And I would do even the hardest ones over and over until I managed. The summer before fourth year, I spent an entire month practicing the Disillusionment charm before I could get it right.
"We have intelligence," Draco explained, "That if they can find the location, they'll attack en masse, but defense of the wedding as a whole is something Dumbledore's concerned about. Maybe it should be canceled, but if it isn't, we're narrowing our focus.
"Well," Hermione said huffily, "Harry
be expected."
"Only that I wish to dedicate our winnings," Draco said, seizing Sirius's arm and lifting it in the air, "To our team's official Man of the Match, Sirius Black!"
The others fell silent, Dobby instantly at the sound of that walking stick. Draco looked up to see Father looking down on the three of them, and then saw the scene through Father's eyes: his only son and heir covered in dried blood and filth, beside a boy similarly dirtied, but not enough to hide he was a Weasley. The one family Draco had promised to stay away from in their deal. Then there was Dobby, the house elf Father had freed for helping Draco defy his will. Hanging out there with Draco on a corridor floor,

But what was it
As if he'd laid down anything this year but plots to end up in him committing more murders...
And then there was movement in Draco's peripheral vision, as Potter's gaze went from the dog to the air between them, where there was gold at last. And Draco as always had been a step behind and missed it. Potter began a kamikaze dive towards Draco, zooming in already closer when Draco should have been based on where they started. Draco flattened himself to his broom, squinting his eyes against the rain, trying to ignore the threat of Potter and narrow his entire world to the gold. Potter had said he would catch the Snitch no matter what, but Draco had to try-
On the Saturday before the First Task, it came time for the long-awaited Hogsmeade visit. Draco realized belatedly what a jackass he'd been, promising to spend the day with just Potter when it was Luna's first Hogsmeade weekend. When he told her and Hermione, though, they both urged him to 'have fun with Harry' with inconsiderate giggles, even after he insisted it was
When Severus finally opened the door, he found Draco sitting on the ground. "When we began these Sunday morning check-ins," Severus said crossly, "One had never anticipated the
"Dantanian Black knew about Castell de L'Infern?" Draco gasped.
"Bloody hell, a ring," Sirius groaned, "How could I forget..." His eyes went to the tapestry again, and Draco traced a finger to follow his gaze. It fell not on Sirius's name, but those of his parents.

"I don't know if it was a punch or just a knee there, it was all kind of a blur," she said thoughtfully.
Unfortunately, this made Draco slow following Severus up the stairs, who was stalking towards the sound of Gilderoy's voice. Gilderoy was calling down to Draco, having heard his voice yelling, but apparently not the words. "Oh, Draco, you're awake too!" Gilderoy sounded as unduly cheerful as last night. "Everything alright down there? I'll be down in a minute- I've just been enjoying these lovely accommodations- you can't imagine the relief of running water, to properly do my

to give me the name of the restaurant that makes such delicious sauerbraten."
"Alohomora," the soft murmur of Harry's voice came from outside, and then the palpable sensation of every lock in the room opening. Harry's magic was so excessive for such small spells. He had no attention to or conception of his overuse, though. In Harry, there was no magical exhaustion or depletion like in Draco. His fount of magic seemed borderline inexhaustible.
"Stop!" Draco yelled. "Stop!"
"Dementor!" Dantanian barked, and the Dementor froze. "Stop it." He waved his hand imperiously, and the Dementor moved aside mechanically, as ordered. Dantanian seemed to have a puppeteer's control of the creature.
you to be."
Draco didn't know who had told Lockhart he looked good in that plummy shade of purple, but whatever their job was, they ought to be fired from it.
Mother had done an incredible job shrinking the dress to fit a rough idea of Luna's proportions, on short notice at that. Either Mother had a soft spot for Luna, or she thought Luna had to be turned out extra-beautifully, to compensate for the flaws of the girl beneath the dress.
"I'm just going to have to do a great deal of color-based transfiguration," Draco sighed, "And I can't turn it all preemptively red and gold, Harry, it's not guaranteed I'll end up in Gryffindor no matter how bad you want it." He smiled reassuringly at the girl, when she returned from the back to tell him that no, they had nothing like that. "Thanks, don't worry. I know it's not a specialty shop."

"Is that why Remus and Sirius took you in?" Harry breathed in stricken guilt. "Oh God, I was such a
Draco forced himself to grin. "It's a figure of speech. It means it's a mystery, and that it's bad for me. Like that song I wrote about me being a Dementor for you- expecting your Patronum-"
Hooting and hollering greeted them from all sides, as thunderous an applause as had greeted Draco shielding against all those stunners or more, with Draco amidst the cheers. He slapped his working hand against his non-working hand, and told himself not to panic.
"Hermione," Draco sighed, closing his eyes, "My godfather just sent Aurors after me, you think you could forgive me just this once?"
yet. It was annoying, having everyone not just one step behind but three or four. He would have to take care not give anything away without meaning to. It gave him a great temptation to invade Potter's room that night and go,
Potter's fingers traced over Draco's hair on the pillow. "Are Dementors really that bad?"
"I would be proud to look like Professor Snape," Draco said loftily, "And I would be proud to follow in his footsteps with potions as well, should fate have not already given the call to vocation to become an Unspeakable. We've been looking for you, Potter. You're staying at the Leaky Cauldron, aren't you? Ron's father told us."
"So you wouldn't say yes if Cedric Diggory asked you?" Potter blurted, "Or, um, Charlie Weasley, or Theo Nott, or..." He trailed off, the determined strength he had put on his face falling away just as quickly, body swaying towards Draco's seemingly of its own accord. Draco could smell that cheap Muggle shampoo he used, grass and dirt and male sweat and a magic so strong in his veins it always seemed to give sharpness to Potter's scent, some potency only it had.
"He attacked me," Theo snapped, "The papers are right, he really is psychotic-"
He turned aside and hacked for breath, not from panic but sheer overexertion, so nauseous he could throw up or more likely pass out, air barely coming. He reached past what he now knew was Naufragiam, found a vial of draught of peace that had somehow made it unbroken too, and unstoppered it. He downed it, though half of it ended up all over him.
"Harry," Draco whispered, leaning to press a soothing kiss to his cheek. "That's it, come for me..."
Dantanian snuggled back down under the covers. "Because," he said through another yawn, "You can't expel your own nephew."
Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once, and Merlin, Draco had never wanted to hear that laugh again. It was normally one reserved for when the Cruciatus curse contorted its victim's limbs into particularly novel or unlikely positions. "This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?"
Perhaps it would have been more effective without the visible injuries lessened, but Draco still did his best to look small and pathetic there in his Slytherin-green pajamas. Even though he knew it was a task that grew more difficult for manipulative purposes with each year he got older.
Draco assisted, and allowed Severus to persist in his belief that it had only been a practical joke, if perhaps not by his godson. But if Severus didn't notice how incredibly glum Lockhart looked at the staff table the next day, and how many times he kept yawning, well, some people were just bound and determined not to see what was right before their eyes.
, and tried to think of an item to replace it. Then he realized the biggest items he had missed.
"I won't ask any more questions. I'm not here to socialize," she insisted, lower lip quivering alarmingly. "I just need a place to study, same as you."
a parade of names also embedded with an undead one, but their disadvantage was that they were also eleven now.
"What other ingredients are there, sir?"
Draco was too tired to properly roll his eyes in Severus's manner, so he just stuck his tongue out. "Oh, so brave and handsome. You're my

Except his arrival at Potions with Gryffindor revealed that the second Wizarding War had started early, and Draco had missed it, down in the dungeons.
rooting me on, weren't you?"
"But of course," Grindelwald finished, "There is one comfort for Orpheus."
And stronger. He felt that too.
Ginny flinched, flying back from him, but Millie held her ground, unimpressed. "Please, Grindelwald.
Draco dropped Hermione's book into the fire.
"You? Wandless magic?" Father marveled, beginning his pacing again. "You have never been able to so much as summon a spark from your hands. And you expect me to believe you singlehandedly shattered a glass case enchanted to hold the darkest artifacts in Malfoy Manor?" Draco nodded weakly, and Father lowered his wand, which boded worse rather than better to come, as it would have in any other man. "Show me then. Let's see this incredible wandless magic my master wizard of a son can now produce."
, which Draco found extreme at least in his case, until he remembered he was wearing the garb of the Muggle kicking game.
Neville's face took a long time to process the information, as he tried to wipe tears away to look properly. Once he did, he looked no more comprehending. "No, isn't that
"Potter, he's talking to you, not me, you absolute pillock," Draco hissed, red-faced, and Ginny came up excitedly, going,

friend."
"I know why you ditched Quidditch with everyone," Draco said in a low purr, and crooked his finger at Potter. "It'll be better to kiss me, won't it, without my godfather watching?"
