“You chose a cat over me,” Harry replied blandly. Draco placed the cat on the couch and kissed Harry on the lips firmly.
After several moments of severely uncomfortable silence, Draco moved closer to Harry and pulled him into an embrace.
“Really,” Sirius affirmed. “Now, let's go back inside, shall we?” Draco grabbed Harry's hand and they followed Sirius back into the house.
Hermione scowled at him. “And who, exactly, do you have in mind who will tell the whole truth and not be biased toward Harry about this?” she demanded.
“What do you want to do to my throat?” Harry asked, his voice in a whisper. A hand slowly reached up and held him by the back of the neck, Draco’s thumb putting a very small amount of pressure on Harry’s Adam’s apple. It came around the front of Harry’s throat and Draco’s fingers grabbed him by the jaw, palm pressing into the front of Harry’s neck. Harry tilted his head back in obvious submission, feeling the warm hand spread prickles of sensation down his neck and to his cock.
Draco leaves and rushes up the steps before Harry can see him cry. He puts a locking spell that he knows Harry could disarm if he wanted but knows he won’t. He lays on the bed for an hour before there’s a knock on the door. “Astra and I are leaving. We’ll wait a few minutes if you want to go. If not, I understand.”
“I don’t know why you started with love letters in the first place,” Draco tells her with an exasperated tone.
“It wasn’t a dream to me!” Draco shouts, sitting up and opening his bed curtains, finding Harry illuminated in the moonlight streaming in. “It was real! You and me and Astra, were real! And now I’m back here and you don’t look at me like he did! It’s like you’ve died and it’s like she died! And I can’t- I can’t
“Sorry.” Draco mumbles, standing to his feet quickly and disappearing with his things before Harry can stand himself.
They spend Valentines day holed up in their room, Draco admitting he’s not quite ready for it to move past making out. Harry assuring him that just making out is perfectly fine with him and that he doesn’t want to do anything until they’re both ready for it. Draco falls even more in love with him. They both agree that they want to keep it hidden for a while, both liking the idea of stolen glances and secret kisses.
Draco and Granger stare at each other before Draco lets out a stifled laugh. “I’ve never heard you curse before.”
They’re only halfway into breakfast when Pansy finds him. She marches over and stands beside him with her hands on her hips. “You aren’t eating with us?”
Of course that sends Harry into a panic, wondering if people hate him. Which makes him feel guilty because people shouldn’t hate him for being friends with Draco. Draco had tried time and time again to make up for his actions. As had Pansy and Blaise. And nobody was mad at Ginny for walking into the lunch room holding hands with Parkinson. Or at Dean for getting caught making out with Blaise in a closet. Of course, he and Draco were just friends so it shouldn’t even matter.
Draco hesitates, looking down and then back up at Harry. “I told him it wasn’t possible. That I wouldn’t give up our friendship to appease him. But- He wants nothing to do with me if I’m friends with you. It’s a hard thing to overcome, the loss of a parent who doesn’t
“Now you’re just delusional,” Draco teases, finishing his last piece of toast. “The world doesn’t revolve around you, ya know. No matter how much your little followers think it does.”
“You and Draco could go together?” Hermione suggest before she rushes to add, “As friends, I mean. Since you two are the only ones without dates.”
“Well, Luna and Neville have been together since summer. Ron and Hermione, the same. Dean is still pretending not to be making heart eyes at Blaise every chance he gets,” Ginny explains, Dean turning bright red. “And I have my little secret admirer. You’re the only one luckless in love.”
Draco started off slowly, with shallow thrusts. Harry relaxed his throat and managed to take a few more inches into his mouth. He felt the tip of Draco’s cock pushing against the back of his throat.
“Mhm.” Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist once again. “Harry, you know how much I love you, right?” Harry nodded. “Okay. Good.” Harry gave him a small, confused smile.
“And what did you say on the train? When we were talking about collections? What did you say about me?”
“Hello to you too, gorgeous,” he said nonchalantly. Harry faltered for a moment but quickly recomposed himself. “How was supper?”
They walked into Draco’s Prefect room and Harry was shocked at the inside. It was neat and tidy and there were hundreds of floating candles all around. Harry picked up a small bouquet of flowers that lied in front of a small mirror. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist loosely, kissing the nape of his neck.
Harry shrugged. “I didn't mean to. I was going to wait for you at the bottom of the stairs. I wasn't trying to listen.” He paused. “What's overwhelming? Why do you want to go back home? Why were you talking about Voldemort having your room? Am I stressful to you? What will be over soon?”
“Oh. Winky. Is this my tea?” Harry asked quietly, relieved. Winky bowed and set it on the nightstand.
Draco started the water and helped Harry undress slowly as if he’d break. Sitting in a ball in the tub, Harry grabbed onto Draco and held him tight. Arms immediately wrapped around his waist and he buried his face into the familiarity of Draco’s warmth.
“What—if Draco's upset, he'll want to see me! I can calm him down. I can help,” Harry protested. “Sirius, please.” The man hesitated for a moment before nodding and Harry took off down the stairs, skipping steps.
“Go on, then. I don't want you getting in trouble,” Harry replied. “Just don't forget about me.” Draco grinned and kissed his head.
“Actually, I talked to Draco the other day,” Sirius remembered. “Remus was out doing… something, I don't know, when suddenly my wards went off and a Malfoy was trying to get through. Thought it was Narcissa at first, honestly, before I saw who it was. Draco explained everything to me. Poor kid. Lucius is still mental.”
Harry looked up at the feeling of someone’s eyes on him. He immediately locked his eyes with a pair of glittering silver ones across the Hall.
Harry’s whole body was shaking by the time Draco paused. He swallowed thickly and shuddered when Draco’s breath coasted across his skin.
Malfoy stared at him intently. Not necessarily maliciously, but intently. Harry blinked. Malfoy blinked back and sent him an annoyingly flashy smirk that did odd things to Harry’s stomach. He rolled his eyes and looked away, deciding to focus on the shininess of the House point system, his appetite forgotten for the afternoon. A piece of parchment and a quill appeared in front of him. Harry looked at Malfoy again, eyebrow raised. Malfoy scribbled something on a parchment by him, and the words appeared on Harry's paper.
“I like that idea,” he agreed. Draco got off his lap and Harry moved further up the bed, propping himself up against the bed frame and holding his arms out expectantly.
“Shut up,” Draco replied without venom. Harry felt Draco’s fingernails drag up and down the small of his back. “I still don’t like you.”
“I’m hurt,” Draco whispered. Harry shot him an irritated look. And louder, “yeah, Potter, let’s see who got the pleasure of marking the Chosen Neck.” Harry rolled his eyes and didn’t even bother to lean back when Draco leaned forward.
“I was in an argument with Percy, and he got upset so I said it to make him feel better. But I was really pissed off and didn’t really mean it at that moment.” He shrugged. “I do love him, though. Most of the time.” Harry chuckled softly and lied his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Draco,” he whispered, taking his hand, “choose for yourself, yeah?” Harry smiled sadly. “Choose because it's what you believe. Choose a side because that's what you think is right. Don't let yourself get pressured into anything.”
One of Draco's hands left Harry's arse and he pulled off his glove before poking two fingers at Harry's mouth. Harry let them push past his lips and held eye contact with Draco as he wet the fingers with his saliva. Draco pulled them out of his mouth and reached his arm behind Harry again, kissing him slowly. Harry bit Draco's lip when he felt Draco's hand slide into his pants and a finger press against his entrance.
“I'm sorry about doubting it, mate,” Ron spoke up, “it's just a bit hard to wrap my head around. I mean, it's weird that one minute you don't like Malfoy, and the next you're dating him.” Hermione nodded again.
When Draco pulled back he tucked a strand of hair behind Harry's ear. The simple sweet gesture had Harry blushing as he returned his hands to the pocket of his sweater.
Harry stared at the shut door of Ron's bedroom, silently hoping that Draco would come back in and tell him it's all right, that he's forgiven.
“I really have turned you into a Hufflepuff,” Harry said thoughtfully. Draco looked up and arched an eyebrow.  Harry glanced at the clock on the wall and realized he’d been at Grimmauld Place for over two hours. “I should get going. I need to wrap Hermione’s gifts before tomorrow.” He stood up and hugged Sirius, stroked Freddie’s fur, and glared at Draco for good measure before kissing him on the cheek. “Replaced by a goddamn cat,” he muttered. Harry turned to Sirius. “Can I use your Floo?”
“I didn’t know you’d care about comfort,” he admitted. Draco looked over at him and mumbled something before looking away again. “Hmm?” Harry asked. Draco shook his head.
“Definitely not.” He planted a kiss on Harry’s nose before removing his glasses. “Here, lift up your arms.” Harry did as he was told and Draco tugged his sweater off over his head. “You’ll overheat if you wear this tonight.” Harry smiled softly.
“I couldn't give less of a damn about it, but Kreacher insists on keeping it clean and it was the closest sitting room to where we were. What do you have to say?”
After what felt like hours of annoyingly grueling accusations and questions, Harry left the courtroom without so much as a slap on the wrist. Mrs. Figg was truly a saint in his eyes, now. He had attempted and failed to gain Headmaster Albus Dumbledore's attention, but the old Professor clearly had no cravings for small talk with a student, as he had ignored Harry's calls.
“But since every piece of evidence of the cause of my parents’ murders pointed to him, he got chucked in Azkaban. So… I was entrusted by Dumbledore to my aunt and uncle.” Harry burrowed as close to his boyfriend as physically possible.
“My friends hate you,” Harry replied. “They don't trust you, they don't know you. They won't even give you a chance.”
“Hey, Harry. Sorry—I was just looking at the photo. I keep wondering if he had been better... if he knew more if he would have survived.”
“Draco’s giving—m-me a blowjob under—the table,” he whispered, gasping. Ron paled. “Please—don’t look,” Harry pleaded. His friend nodded. Harry had the sudden urge to slam his forehead on the table. “Oh—g-god.” He cleared his throat to hide his groan. He felt Draco chuckle quietly around him. He found grip on the edge of his bench, both of his hands whitening because of how hard he was gripping the wood seat. Draco was unrelenting in taking Harry down to the base again and again until he was trembling from being so close to coming.
“Well, hello,” he cooed. He picked Freddie up from Harry’s lap and stood up, cradling it in his arms like one would with a baby. “You’re so cute, yes you are, aren’t you, Freddie?”
“We could have been in a private room this whole time!” Harry cried. “And you're using it for a date!” Draco laughed lightly. “And just so you know, all of them call you ‘Ferret’.”
“You will be back in forty-five minutes. No stops along the way. If Draco tells you to leave, you come straight home,” she warned. Ron nodded. “Hurry along. Time is ticking.” Ron jumped toward the fireplace and threw Floo powder down, saying the name of Number 12 Grimmauld Place just a bit too loudly.
“He’s not my boyfriend,” he argued, “we went out once. Oh, god, maybe I am just the worst company ever and he never wants to talk to me again?” He let his head fall into his hands. “I’m the worst, aren’t I?” A hand found his thigh and squeezed it lightly. Harry looked up at Hermione, but her hands were both on the table and she was looking at him pitifully. Then at Ron, but he was too busy shoveling food in his mouth. Harry tried inconspicuously to look under the table, and saw silver eyes, blond hair and Slytherin robes holding a slender finger against pink lips. Harry’s eyes widened and he returned his gaze to his plate with flaming cheeks. Draco tugged his pant leg and Harry moved forward on his seat so that his stomach was pushed against the edge of the table. He laid a hand on Hermione’s arm.
Harry slid off and fell ungraciously onto the bed beside Draco. “Fuck. That was…” He turned his head to look at the boy next to him, who was staring at him lazily.
“Hate to break up what seems like a smashing reunion of lovebirds,” Fred startled them out of their kiss, “but mum says lunch is on and that Malfoy's invited to stay as long as he wants.” He winked at Harry, who blushed, before walking back inside.
“What did you want me to do, grab his arse?” he growled. Hannah grinned and Harry rolled his eyes. He stuck his hands in Draco’s back pockets, squeezed, and glared at Hannah again. She smiled happily.
Harry looked between Sirius and Remus. Then at his hands. “Well, I… I'm… I like—god fucking dammit, this is difficult to say—”
“No, it's Blaise’s,” Draco replied sarcastically. “Yes, it's mine, you dummy. Put it on.” Harry nodded and slipped it over his head. It went halfway past his thighs and the sleeves covered his hands.
“My mother is amazing. I wish there was a way for you to meet her.” Harry looked over at Draco and kissed his cheek. “What was that for?”
“Oh, come on, Fred,” Hermione scoffed. “Put Harry down.” Fred shrugged and started to roll Harry off his shoulder in such a manner that would send him toppling to the ground on his arse. Harry clung to Fred’s stomach embarrassingly, not wanting to fall. Fred laughed.
Harry groaned softly in frustration and Draco kissed his head. “Yes, Weasley, he did, and if he were sober we would have done it on your desk just to spite you.” Harry snorted quietly.
“I didn't make you choose, did I?” Harry asked quietly. “I didn't—you're not making this choice because of me, are you?” He took a step backward. “Did you—”
It was going to be odd, not meeting the DA in the Room of Requirement for the two weeks of Winter Holidays.
“Care about me and want what's best for me?” Harry finished for her. She nodded eagerly. “I know. I'm sorry I got upset.” He held out his arms in invitation and she ran into him, bushy hair tickling Harry's neck. Harry grinned at Ron, who was raising an eyebrow. "Are you wanting a hug, too, Ron?" he teased.
“Harry… how would you feel about maybe not hiding and sneaking around anymore?” he asked quietly. Harry looked up at him.
“Nothing,” Harry answered truthfully, “I'm happy, I'm not really thinking about anything.” He shrugged.
“Yeah,” Draco repeated quietly. Harry hummed and buried his face in Draco’s neck with a yawn. Draco’s arm draped over his waist to pull him closer. Harry heard Draco’s heart beating quickly.
down on the parchment and circling it. “This entire thing—it’s so simple, yet so brilliantly executed, and it wasn’t even intentional...”
“You two didn't have to spend this much on us,” George said after hearing the news that the three hundred packaging materials would be delivered on the 27th to the place they had bought in Diagon Alley.
Draco kissed his forehead. “Yes,” he decided. “And the way we’re going to come out to people is…” He twisted off his ring and held it out to Harry, who took it in curiosity. “You’ll wear this around your neck on a chain until we graduate. If you want to. Because by then I will have gathered my sparse courage and finally bought an engagement ring to replace it with.”
Harry looked at the full bag slung over Draco's shoulder and the trunk at his feet. “You're leaving,” he realized. Draco ran a hand through his loose blond hair and nodded. “Are you going to stay at the Burrow for the rest of hols?”
“Yeah. I know,” he said. “I just hate sneaking around. It’s stressful, and I hate it when Astoria Greengrass pins you with her creepy look that makes her seem like she wants to eat you.”
After shutting the shower off, Harry was a bit hesitant to go out of the stall naked to grab a towel across the bathroom but did it quickly anyway and wrapped it around his hips, sure to hide those bruises. He grabbed his clothes off the floor and walked back toward the boys’ dorms, hyper-aware of people staring at him. He jumped when a Ravenclaw in a higher year grabbed his wrist. “Do I know you?”
“Mum, please! He’s my best friend, and I can’t just let him be depressed over Malfoy!” Ron whispered. She sighed and pinched her nose.
“Good. I’m really sorry, again, I didn’t even think about it, I just said it.” Mrs. Weasley rested a comforting hand on his arm.
“No!” Harry cut him off, attempting to reassure him. All he really did was make Draco jump. “No it's fine, I understand what you mean, I didn't mean to make you feel obligated to stay. It was just an option, I'm sorry if I made it seem like something else.”
He was met with murmurs of “no, it’s fine,” from Zabini and Dean. Nott had gone back to staring at the ceiling unhelpfully.
“Yes sir, Master Harry Potter,” the elf replied. “Do you need anything else from Winky, sirs?” The boys shook their heads and he bowed again before leaving.
“GET OUT OF MY HEAD!” Harry yelled. Something else broke. The burning in his scar subsided and his mind went quiet. All that he could hear was panicked breathing and his own sobs.
"Mr. Weasley, how many people will be in there?" Harry asked before he opened the doors to a courtroom that was awaiting his presence.
“You wrote me a letter explaining why you love me because you thought I might be overwhelmed.” Harry rose an eyebrow. Draco opened his mouth to speak again, but Harry beat him to it. “It was two pages long.”
“I love you,” he whispered. Draco returned the phrase in a haste mumble and slid Harry’s shirt off his shoulders, kissing down his chest needily. He dropped gracefully to his knees and bit at Harry’s stomach above the waistband of his trousers, leaving light pink marks behind and pressing his face into Harry’s hip with a soft groan. Harry felt a cleaning charm zip up his spine and he exhaled sharply when Draco pulled his trousers down and mouthed at the front of his pants.
Draco must fall asleep reading one before he’s startled awake when Harry comes in the front door. He waits a moment before asking, “Where’s Astra?”
“That’s not true. They wish you hadn’t been forced to be there.” Harry explains, hoping Draco believe his words. “They know you were just a boy trying to please his parents.”
Draco’s chest tightens when Harry turns and starts walking away from him. He scrambles to his feet, having to do a slight run to catch up to the taller boy. “Harry, I’m sorry!”
“I’ll take the couch tonight.” Harry informs him and Draco’s stomach sinks at the thought of being alone in an unfamiliar place.
“Mr. Malfoy, you’re awake!” The healer says, smiling as she sets his chart down. “Do you know where you are?”
“No, I put mine in a little metal infuser. I’ll probably need a new one soon but, it can wait.” Draco points to a small table with infuser on it. He turns back to the wall of teas and doesn’t notice Harry wander off.
“You were teaching your potions class. You were observing a student’s work and we’re really not sure how it happened but the potion wasn’t correct. Small explosion sent you flying back.” The healer explains and Draco’s mind tries to catch up. “Your husband has been called.”
“It’s nothing.” Harry watches Draco as he runs his finger over the infuser before wrapping it back up with careful hands. After Harry’s put it back in the bag, he tells Draco, “C’mon. I wanna go to the sweets shop. They have pumpkin fritters this time of year.”
A few minutes later, Harry woke up from his half-sleep because of people's voices outside the door. He heard Ron clamber into the bed above him and Draco, who hadn't moved an inch.
“I'm gonna give you two a minute.” Sirius patted Draco's shoulder and walked down the hall to the kitchen.
“Can I at least try? Harry’s at home crying in his sleep. I mean, who cries in their sleep?” Ron asked. Sirius rubbed his forehead and nodded, gesturing up the stairs.
“Quite possibly,” Harry laughed softly. “That’s not what I meant, though.” Draco looked over at him. Harry smiled tentatively, the expression widening when Draco squeezed his hand.
Harry’s whole upper body stiffened and he embarrassingly burst into tears, sobbing, begging Draco—for what, he didn’t know anymore. Draco’s intentions were to obviously torture him with overstimulation.
I'm late but I'm here! Oof sorry it's been debilitating heat for so long where I live, I have been in a lump in my basement and haven't cared to glance at a computer screen even once. Enjoy :)
He was cut off by Draco’s mouth covering his own. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck and pulled him closer. “That was a nice surprise,” he laughed quietly. Draco kissed him again. Harry slipped a hand down and played with one of the buttons on Draco’s shirt. “Well. If we’re not going to be doing anything, I need to get dressed.” Draco rolled his eyes and kissed his forehead.
“In Ron's room, dear,” Mrs. Weasley hummed softly. Harry nodded and skipped steps up the stairs and burst into Ron's room.
“I think you’re beautiful.” Harry smiled softly. Draco kissed up the side of his neck to his ear. “Are you still wearing the necklace?”
“I don’t understand why marrying a Muggle is such a big deal,” Harry said. “I mean, we’re all people.”
“Your friend just—bit me and it bloody well—hurt, Nott, don’t ask if I’m enjoying myself!” Harry snapped, breathing heavily. Draco laved over the bite as if apologetically and Harry squeezed Draco’s waist for a moment in acknowledgment.
“Do you need help at all?” George asked worriedly. “With anything?” Harry shook his head before looking over to Draco, who still had an extremely concerned expression on his face. He laced his fingers into Draco’s.
“Harry?” A quiet voice stirred him from sleep. He groaned softly and rolled over. His blurry vision vaguely made out a tall blond figure in the doorway. Harry immediately sat up and shoved his glasses on. “Can I—”
“Don't you forget about me, Potter,” Draco hummed, releasing his arms from under Harry's arse and letting Harry's legs drop to the ground. Harry grinned.
Ron felt bad for Harry. He was his best mate. But, he also wanted to sleep. He couldn’t handle the hiccuping breaths any longer. Who knew people could cry in their sleep? Ron sighed and got out of bed, quietly stepping down the stairs. He made sure to skip the squeaky stair.
That lasted for about five minutes until Draco came in without a shirt on and a towel wrapped lowly around his hips. Harry set his book down. Dean and Zabini’s conversation ceased, and Theodore Nott turned his head to stare at Draco’s shiny figure. Harry rolled his eyes. “Care to cover up?” he asked. “Not sure everyone wants to see you naked, myself included.”
Harry looks to Ginny who nods to him. He turns and must spot Draco before he walks to where Draco is concealing himself. He stands behind him and asks, “What’s happening?”
They’re a small class, some of them opting not to come back and some of them… Well, the war had claimed people. They play darts and dance and drink butter beer, they have
Harry rolls his eyes and turns around to head inside. Draco watches him go and stands there for a few minutes after his figure disappears inside the doors. He turns around and heads in the direction of the dorms, eyes burning.
Harry pressed a firm kiss to Draco’s forehead. “I’m not going anywhere, love. I’m here to stay. No matter what, okay? I love you.”
Once the attention is off of him, he turns to Harry. “Thank you. You don’t have to take me, I’m sure you have someone you’d rather take.”
Granger corners him in the library later that night, pointing a finger in his face, “What the hell are you doing to Harry?”
“Er, yeah.” Harry’s cheeks flame and he shuffles his feet. “I’m 6’4 now. Mrs. Weasley said it’s like it happened overnight.”
Draco nearly questions who Potter was speaking too in the woods but, he already knows the answer so he just responds, “And risk getting yourself in trouble?”
“I thought you wanted to be patient and wait until they came back.” Draco points out in  quiet voice.
at the sight of Harry’s tears spilling over onto his cheeks. “I just wanted to make sure you were alright!”
Draco felt a weird sinking feeling in his chest. “Oh. Boy Wonder finally falling for one of his adoring fans.”
“Can I sit in with you?” Draco’s mostly looking at Harry but, he casts a glance to Ron and Hermione.
Harry laughs, dropping his hand from Draco’s face. “I want you to wait until those memories come back. You’ll want to remember those on your own.”
The next morning at breakfast, Draco pointedly did not look at Potter. He took his seat, ate his toast and sipped his tea like a normal human being. If he kept his head down and didn’t look at Potter for a week or two, he could go back to keeping an eye on him. Then someone is sitting down beside him and when Draco looks over it’s Potter. He quirks an eyebrow and asks, “Can I help you, Potter?”
He’s cut off by the door flinging open. Draco’s eyes widen at the sight of Harry fucking Potter standing there, holding a small girl in his arms. There’s a full beard on his face and his hair is long and pulled back into a low bun. Potter sets the small girl down and she runs to Draco’s side with a huge smile on her face. “Daddy, you’re okay!”
The first day of eighth year, Harry and Draco form a truce. They’ll cease the angry looks, the foul tones, the always at each others throats, and all the back and forth. Of course, they’re still Harry and Draco so they get into spats often. Mostly about Harry’s arm bumping his while they’re studying in the library. Or about how Draco wakes absurdly early, grunting out push-ups and sit-ups making Harry rip open his bed curtains and then they’re off. More importantly, they become sort of… friends.
Draco’s heart soars at the thought that he had been able to be so honest with Harry. That Harry knew his weird quirks and he’s hit with the desire to know Harry’s weird quirks. “Will you be here tomorrow?”
They manage to keep it hidden for most of the semester. It’s the second week of June. McGonagall agrees to let the eighth years hold a small get together, not a party she insists, in an empty classroom.
Draco stands there, arms dangling at his side and doesn’t know what to say. He then blurts out, “I’m sorry.”
Two weeks into the new semester, Harry is rubbing his eyes over a charms assignment. Hermione refused to help him so asking her was pointless. He lets out an annoyed sigh before Draco pushes a paper over to him. It’s his charms notes for this assignment, explaining how to do it. Harry looks over at him with thankful eyes and begins reading over his notes.
“Draco, calm down.” Hermione tells him softly. “You were hit with spell that slips you into a dream state. You dream about what you want most.”
His Mother had written him weeks earlier, stating that she was going to join Andromena and Teddy on a trip to Spain for Christmas. He had declined her invitation to come with her told her he would spend Christmas with his friends. But now, he wasn’t sure if he had any friends. Would he still be able to talk to Hermione? Or Ginny? He knew he’d always have Pansy and Blaise. But, he wouldn’t expect them to choose sitting alone with him over their partners.
Harry’s face falls and Draco must’ve said something wrong. “No. I think we should wait until the memories comes back.”
Draco draws a slow hand up, pushing Granger’s finger out of his face. He shakes his head and answers, “Like I told Boy Wonder this morning, the world doesn’t revolve around him. I haven’t been watching or spying on him.”
One side of the bed has clothes everywhere, the other clean and pristine. There’s a bathroom but the door is only slightly cracked so Draco can’t see in. The closet is the same way as the nightstands, one side messy and the other perfectly clean. When he looks back to Harry, he’s wearing a patient look on his face. Harry makes the bed with a wave of his wand and gestures for Draco to sit. They sit with their legs crossed, facing each other.
“It’s actually, Asterope. Which means, starry-faced or lightning.” Draco looks to Harry’s scar as he explains. “Astra for short means of the stars. Her full name is Asterope Poppy Malfoy-Potter. “
“Waking up to find out I’m married to Potter? Yeah, madly weird.” Draco doesn’t miss how Potter flinches again. He makes a mental note to try and call him Harry when he can.
“Our daughter’s name was Asterope, meaning starry-face or lightning.” Draco says in one breath, his pointer finger tracing Harry’s scar. “Astra for short meaning of the stars. Poppy for the flowers I bring you when you’re cross with me.”
“Right. I thought you were going to dinner at Pansy and Ginny’s?” Draco asks, setting the book on the table by the couch.
“Don’t be sorry, Potter. Mum will surely give him hell for months to come. I just wanted you to know why I’m being weird.” Draco explains, closing his trunk and setting it on the ground.
“I’ve wanted this for so long,” Harry whispers, his breath hot against Draco’s neck where Harry’s trailing kisses.
“We haven’t even heard any speeches,” Harry answers making Draco groan, leaning over and resting his head on Harry’s bicep. “Let’s sneak out. We can go down to the lake.”
“That’s a lie,” Granger spits out. “Every time I look at you, you’re staring at him. What’re you up to, Malfoy?”
Finally after the song ends, Harry pulls Draco into a small alcove after swiping two cups of punch. They sit down on the small couch there and Harry hands Draco a punch.
Draco looks up from his Muggle Studies homework to see Harry standing there. He’s got a chair half pulled out, waiting for Draco’s permission to sit down. “If you must.”
Draco sighs in annoyance as he stands and Potter pulls the pants up over the curve of his ass. When Potter goes to button them, he swats his hands away. “I can button my own pants, Potter.”
He walked through random hallways, looking at pictures on the walls to try and calm his mind. This was usually a surefire way to make him sleepy enough to go back to bed without having to distract his mind from thought of the past couple of years.
It’s quiet for a long pause before, “Well, I guess now you know. You and all your friends and followers can all make fun of Draco Malfoy, the death eater who most wants The Saviour.”
Harry sends Draco a glare but drags the brush through his hair all the same. His hair poofs out and he lets out a little groan before stealing a hair tie off of Hermione’s wrist and pulling his locks into a bun on the back of his head. “Better?”
He wakes slowly the next day and snuggles closer to Harry, not wanting to face the still cool March draft that was sure to be in their room. Harry’s chest rumbles with a groan as he pulls Draco in more. “Morning, love.”
“This one’s quite personal,” Ginny says, folding the paper up and slipping it under her robes before anyone can take it from her hands.
It’s quiet for a long time and Draco thinks that maybe Harry had fallen back asleep. “You don’t think they’re going to come back on their own?”
“By listening in on my private conversations?” Harry screams, hand running through his hair in frustration.
“You’ve been calling me that a lot lately.” Harry says into the darkness. “You’ve been whispering my name for two weeks.”
Harry freezes and then curses softly. He untangles himself from Draco and moves away with an apology before he turns on his side away from Draco. It takes Draco a full five minutes to calm his racing heartbeat and push the thoughts of how good Harrys mouth had felt on his neck before he can get up to use the bathroom. He finds some towels and a wash rag and showers while he’s in there.
.” Harry whines, bucking his hips when Draco’s just barely runs his fingertips over the tip of Harry’s cock.
They sneak out, practically running down the hallways and not stopping until they’re outside and can see the lake. Draco shivers against the cold air, wishing he’s brought his winter jacket.
And for all that Draco’s done, he doesn’t know what good deed he did to deserve seeing Harry bend over his desk in just a towel. Draco takes a steadying breath, hoping Harry can’t feel Draco’s eyes on his ass. Draco slams his book closed and stands, “I uh, I just remembered I- I have to go.”
Harry was waiting at the end of the hallway and Draco’s breath caught in his throat at the sight of him. He was wearing a white button down, tight in all the right places, with the top few buttons open and showing the top of his chest off. It was tucked into a pair of tight, navy blue slacks that stopped just at his ankles where a pair of brown loafers started. His hair was down and laying perfectly as he smiled at Draco.
Draco sighs and gathers himself before going back to his Charms paper. Granger’s words bothered him, Potter wasn’t trying to have a normal anything. He didn’t know how to go back to normal, apparently. He didn’t know how to live a life without a villain to take down.
Everyone looks at her with surprised looks and she shrugs. “Their handwriting is in impeccable. The way they talk about certain things. The way they speak of marriage. It could very well be a more feminine man, which would be just as well. But, I wouldn’t mind it being a girl.”
Harry’s face softens and he sighs, tracing Draco’s jawline with absent fingers. “I forgot you don’t like being alone at night. I’m sorry, of course we can share a bed.”
“You’re not going anywhere? You’re not going to suddenly realize that I’m Draco ‘Deatheater’ Malfoy and disappear?” Draco asks in a whispered voice.
He’s spiraling into a panic attack before he knows it. He’s gasping for breath and sobbing at the same time. He can’t lose Harry, can’t lose Astra. He doesn’t realize the doorbell has been ringing until the door opens and Granger is rush into the kitchen. She’s throwing her wand and bag down on the table and rushing to his side.
Draco lets them go and when he’s sure they’re gone, he removes the locking spell and goes downstairs. He examines the pictures on the wall, willing his mind to remember even just one of the moments. Granger and Weasleys wedding, Astra’s newborn photographs, he and Harry in Paris. There’s a picture of Pansy, Ginny, Granger, Weasley, Harry and him in front of Hogwarts. They’re all wrapped together and he sees himself gazing at Harry in udder adoration. Merlin, he wants this. He goes upstairs and opens every drawer in their room. After finding nothing of importance, he goes through Harry’s bedside table. He freezes when he sees a few bottles of lube, two dildos, and pair of handcuffs. He swallows hard before slamming the drawer shut. What in the fuck were they into?
Draco doesn’t miss the way Potter flinches at the use of his last name. Draco wonders when Potter started calling him Draco in a soft voice instead of Malfoy in a distasteful tone. He has so many questions but he doesn’t have a chance to ask them because the small girls appears at the door again. “Aunt ‘Mione and Uncle Ron are here!”
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake. I forgot how insufferable you were.” Harry groans out before softening his tone, “If Astra becomes anything like you, she’ll be amazing. We don’t spoil her, she is sweet and kind. We have a running joke that she’s going to end up a Hufflepuff. Which, could you imagine?”
Harry realizes then that he’s been so focused on not seeming happy that everyone had went and got happy. And suddenly, Harry has to kiss him. He can’t stop himself as he moves forward, pushing through people rather rudely. He doesn’t notice how the room goes quiet as he gets closer to Draco, who only notices him when Harry’s lips are on his.
He must fall asleep because the next thing he knows, he’s being startled awake to someone banging on his door. He rubs his eyes, flinging the blankets off of him. When he opens the door, Pansy stands before him. “You didn’t meet me at the clock tower. And you missed lunch and the rest of class. And dinners about to start.”
“Thank you,” Draco says as he takes the cup from Harry, their fingers brushing. “How long does this usually last?”
“I know.” Hermione says, squeezing his hand. “But if you don’t, you’ll gain new memories with him. With Astra and with us.”
Draco nods, “Usually, I would. But, we’re friends now and I thought you’d appreciate the gesture of me being honest.”
“Did you need something?” Harry asks and Draco notices they’re alone now, everyone moving inside for lunch.
“Christmas can only be so good when you have Lucius as a father.” Draco says honestly and Harry’s heart hurts for him.
Harry’s head snaps up and searches Draco’s face before he surges forward, capturing Draco’s lips in a deep kiss. They spend a few minutes on the couch before Harry moves Draco’s legs around his waist and hoists them both up.
Draco grabs the same plate he used the night before and sits, grabbing a few waffles. “What are we doing today?”
Draco looked away to see everyone was dancing, holding each other close. He looks back to Harry and reluctantly nods. “Fine. Let’s dance.”
would do; answer honestly, “I have nightmares sometimes. Walking around, reading about some professor who used to work here ages ago or about a quidditch match Hufflepuff won, it helps to distract me and make me tired enough to fall back asleep.”
Ron and Hermione agree to take Astra to her tutor and to watch her another night. So they sit in the examination room, Draco’s hand gripping Harry’s hand so tight his knuckles are white.
“Well, Blaise is going to be dating Dean as soon as they get tired of the stolen glances and pining. And.. I think we both know Pansy is Ginny’s secret admirer,” Harry tells him as if those facts are supposed to explain why they should be friends.
Draco arches an eyebrow and gives him an unimpressed look. “Wow, Potter, I didn’t think I had to tell you that.”
He collects his Early Grey, Chamomile and decides to grab a peppermint tea as well. He pays for it and looks around for Harry but, the a large group of students had just walked in. He goes outside to wait, holding his bag with a tight grip.
Harry drags Draco to the library with him most nights, sitting beside each other and pretending not to steal glances at each other. Harry begins to dream about Draco’s lips and his fingers and his legs that seem to go on forever. He thinks so much about kissing Draco that sometimes he’ll stare right at Draco’s lips in the library. Of course, they’re tucked in the back corner of the library so nobody sees.
“Hm,” Draco says, not trusting his voice. Who? Who was it that Harry had found cute? Who did he have a crush on? Why did feel so jealous of him?
“Honestly?” Draco asks, earning a nod from Harry. “I’d forgotten about it. Also, I didn’t expect you to be
“Thanks for that, they probably think I’m plotting to steal your soul now,” Draco says harshly, rolling his eyes, “Go back to your friends, Potter. Nobody was spying on you.”
Harry waves Draco off and replies, “I will, I will. I just remembered in the shower that I was supposed to let Hagrid know I’m available to help him led a class with Buckbeak tomorrow.”
“I wanted to be with my Mum. It’s hard for her, to reconcile with the fact that the man she married isn’t the same man who sleeps in her bed.” Draco confessed and Harry reaches out and squeezes his wrist. “Besides, the Weasley’s probably hate me. I was on the side of the war that killed their son.”
Hermione moves to Harry and he whispers, “It’s my name he’s been whispering for two weeks. I’m not going anywhere.”
Days pass quickly after that, Astra going off to her private tutors for schooling. He and Harry spend most days talking of different things they’ve done. Their wedding, how Astra become about, Ron and Hermione’s trying for a baby, where the rest of their class ended up. Draco tells Harry stories about his childhood that he’s probably already heard but Harry listens with a steady gaze and attentive ear. They both grow impatient with Draco’s memories not coming back.
“I could ask you the same question,” Draco counters and wasn’t it just yesterday they’d agreed to be friends?
Harry’s face snaps back to stare at Draco with a hurt expression on his face. “No, of course not, love. I’m here. I love you. I know exactly who you are and I love you all the more for it. For overcoming your old self and becoming someone you like.”
The couple nods and Draco walks stiffly to Harry. Harry pulls out his wand and Draco blinks before their standing in front of a large country home, cold air swirling around them.
The next day at breakfast, Pansy pulls Draco with her and Blaise to sit at the Gryffindor table. Pansy, of course, sits beside Ginny who is sporting the same red cheeks that Pansy is. Blaise takes the same spot beside Dean as he’d done the day before. Leaving Draco to sit between Dean and Harry.
“It’s- It’s nothing against you. I would understand if you did.” Draco explains, fiddling with the bottom of Harry’s shirt. “I just thought it would hurt less if you didn’t know how much I really care for you. Or if people didn’t know. Or if you didn’t… If we didn’t..”
Harry snorts, lifting his head up and in doing so, running his nose up the side of Draco’s face. “Parvarti was only a bad dancer because I didn’t know how to lead.”
“I’m fine. Go to sleep Harry.” Draco replies, closing his eyes when he realizes he didn’t call him Potter.
Christmas Day is joyous and loud and filled with so much love that Harry can barely stand it. He gives gifts and gets them in return but, he would’ve been happy even if there hadn’t been gift to be had.
was the guy Harry had a crush on? “I’d like to go with someone who isn’t going to try and snog me against my will.”
He leads Draco past everyone, ignoring Ron’s yell to be safe. He waits until they’re just outside the room before focusing and apparating to their quiet bedroom. Draco takes a steading breath before grinning at Harry. “You’re mad, you’re absolutely mad. They’ll never leave us alone, now.”
He stumbles into the person and grasps onto them for support. When he looks up, it’s Harry looming over him. “I found you.”
Draco panics, hand reaching out to grasp Harry’s wrist. “Wait. I’m sorry. I’m.. I still think of everything you do as an ulterior motive to try and make me look stupid.”
“Earlier this year, I sort of followed Harry down the lake one night. I overheard him talking to.. someone and it was personal conversation. He’s quite mad at me.” Draco felt incredibly vulnerable telling Luna this but, if there was one person who wouldn’t go blabbing her mouth to people, it was Luna.
Harry leads them up the stairs, past a purple door with Astra’s name on it in black lettering. He opens the door to their room and Draco looks around. The bed is unmade, flannel sheets strewn about and pillows everywhere. Both sides of the bed has a nightstand beside it. One has a book on magical creatures, a picture of Lilly and James, a half drank cup of water and a few tissues. The other is neat and organized, just a notepad and a picture of Harry and himself. They’re standing at the alter, holding hands and facing each other with huge grins. The picture moves and Draco tears his gaze away after he sees Harry surge forward and kiss him in the picture.
“Good. Hermione and Puck have been begging him to get a dog.” Harry replies, running a hand down Draco’s arm and entangling their hands. “Tia called, she said the baby’s kicking.”
“Stop worrying about me and tell me what you’re going to say to her,” Draco insists, pulling the attention from him.
“I haven’t seen you in two weeks. You don’t want to see me?” Pansy asks, eyebrows drawn together in a hurt expression.
He was glad that not many 8th year Slytherins had returned, it meant everybody left had gotten their own rooms. Which in turn, meant that Draco didn’t wake anybody up with his nightmares caused him to cry out in his sleep. He shivered against the chill in the air, never seeming to get warm after Voldemort had turned their house into a fucking icebox.
“No, that’s quite alright.” Draco says as Harry turns and his eyes look up the mans body. Draco clears his throat suddenly and turns on his side away from Harry. “Goodnight, Harry.”
Draco wakes up with a gasp, thoughts of war swirling in his head. He takes a few minutes to calm down, wiping his face dry. He throws a green sweater on over his pajama shirt, slipping his shoes on and walking out of his room.
“I’m not giant!” Harry exclaims with a frown. Draco looks up, any further up and his neck would be in pain, and rolls his eyes at the taller boy. “Okay, fine, I’m a little taller now than most.”
Draco pulls out his wand, closing his eyes tightly as he hears Potter stands and start walking into the forest. He quickly says a disillusion charm. He stands perfectly still and doesn’t make a fucking noise until Potter gives up and goes back inside.
“I think I’m going to tell her today,” Pansy says, bringing his attention back to her. Draco looks at her with raised eyebrows, gesturing for her to go on. “It’s just.. I want to hold her hand and kiss her and sit with her at lunch.”
They keep it to making out, hands wandering and sneaking small touches but never going past that. They share the same bed at night, making out until they can barely stay awake. They opt to studying in their room so they can touch freely without the prying looks of Ron and Hermione. Harry brings him chocolates and Draco helps with his charms homework.
“If we attempted to get the memories back we could risk him losing them forever. In these types of situations we usually wait a few months to see if they come back on their own before attempting the retrieval process.” The healer explains, a look of sympathy on her face.
“I saw Harry,” Draco explains, turning and leaving the door open for her come in. He crawls back in bed as she lingers in the doorway for a moment. She finally comes in, shutting the door behind her and comes to sit beside him. “It was awful. He hates me. And Weasley saw me cry.”
“No. My.. I have to go back.” Draco says insistently. He can feel himself start to have a panic attack and he so desperately wants Harry’s arms around him.
“He really is glad you’re his friend, you know.” Draco turns his head to see Granger is standing and walking away from him.
The following morning finds Draco waiting outside the front doors for Harry. Pansy and Blaise had left him already to join Ginny and Dean. He shivered against the October air and pulling his winter jacket more tightly around him. He looked towards the hill where everyone was walking before he looked back to see Harry sauntering towards him. When he was close enough to hear, Draco starts. “Finally, I’ve been waiting out in the cold for ages.”
Harry turns slightly to look at him before turning back to his paper. “Hermione told me some potions that have been known to help with memory recovery. They don’t interfere but rather coax the mind into remembering. I thought we could go to Diagon Alley and find some things.”
“Oh, Mol, look at how red his cheeks are.” Arthur jokes, making Harry cover his face with both hands.
Draco turns around then, wanting to give the girls some privacy and sighs when he’s met with Harry’s chest. “Would you mind, you giant?”
“I have a crush on Harry and we’re fighting so I don’t particularly want to see him because, if I do I’m afraid I’ll die.” Pansy blinks at Draco’s rushed confession. She takes a moment before she sits beside him.
Draco sends him a small smile before picking his book up and resuming. It’s not ten minutes and Harry is holding very still because Draco Malfoy has fallen asleep on his shoulder. He carefully grabs Draco’s books and marks it before pushing it between his thigh and the wall of the train. He sits still as a statue until the train comes to a halt and Draco jerks awake.
He turns over, turning out his lamp and mumbles a goodnight.  Draco lays there in silence, hands aching to reach out and his cock softening by the minute. He turns out his own lamp and it takes him an hour before he realizes his was mistake was calling Harry by his last name.
It’s two days after Harry realizes they’re friends, a couple weeks before Christmas break. He finds Draco at their usual table, hidden in a back corner. He sinks into the chair across from Draco. “So, we’re friends.”
“I would love to,” Ginny agrees, both the girls smiling with red cheeks. “Could I come to your room later, I’d like to…”
Harry licks his lips, nodding. Draco’s barely gotten the words out of his mouth before Harry’s kissing him again. They stumble back against the bed, Draco falling back when the back of his knees hit the bed. Harry follows him down, both of them moving up agains the pillows.
Draco doesn’t have time to react before Astra is kissing his cheek and hugging his neck. “Goodnight, Daddy. Love you most.”
He doesn’t want to sleep that night, afraid he’ll see Harry and Astra. He doesn’t know how to.... move on from that. How do you move on from that sort of thing? It’s like- It’s like they’ve died. He has to press a fist to his mouth to muffle the sob that rips from his chest.
The healer sighs and clears her throat. “He must’ve hit his head harder than we originally thought. He believes it’s still his 8th year at Hogwarts.”
“Sure, Draco. A friend.” Draco tries to decipher the emotion written on Harry’s face but it’s gone in second; Harry turning away to face Ron and making a joke about Seamus dating Lavender now.
He’s laying beside Harry for seconds before Harry’s rolling over, tugging Draco’s black slacks and briefs down. Draco’s hips lift off the bed at the release of his dick and he gasps when Harry starts wanking him off with a lubed up hand.
“Bloody fucking amazing,” Draco replies, pushing up on his toes and pulling Harry down the rest of the way. They stumble back, Draco’s back flat against the wall of the small alcove. Harry’s hands are moving from Draco’s neck, to his hips, to the curve of his ass like he can’t decide just where he wants to hold first. They snog for what seems like forever, both out of breath when the pull apart.
Draco has a fleeting thought that kissing Harry is like the first heat of summer after a long, horrible winter.
“Hermione told me what happened.” Harry says, sitting beside Draco. Draco open his mouth to speak but Harry shakes his head. “I love you. I’m in love with you. I’m not going to leave you. I cut it off last night because I was scared that you would leave me if you couldn’t remember.”
And then he’s pushing Draco against the door and putting his hand around Draco’s slender neck. Draco barely has time to process what’s happening before Harry’s pulling him into a deep, wet kiss. Draco lets out a moan as tangles his hands into Harry’s hair, pulling him closer. They kiss for a long minute before Draco pulls away, his lips red and panting. “I was biding my time for that.”
“Because you’re friends with Harry. Which means, you and I are friends,” Granger explains as if it was so obvious. “And who Harry and I are friends with, Ron usually follows.”
Draco hummed in thought. “I’ve never said ‘I love you’ without meaning it.” Harry looked up at him and smiled brightly. Draco grinned back and Harry saw Fred take the rest of his glass in one gulp.
They sat down at the table, Harry to Draco's right and George to his left. “Hey, Malfoy, have you tried any of our products yet? I hear Slytherins are quite the pranksters.”
“Hm. I'm not, but thank you,” Harry mumbled. He leaned forward and kissed Draco, biting his bottom lip lightly before pulling back to look at Draco's reaction. Draco tried to follow Harry's lips and Harry smiled before kissing him again. “Two weeks,” he sighed in defeat.
“Hey, Malfoy?” Hermione’s voice came softly from the direction of Ron's doorway. “I don't want to overstep, but I just want to say that I was walking by the room when Harry was—graphically, I might add—asking for sex, and I heard you say no because he was drunk.” Harry cringed slightly at how weird he had acted. “I just want to say thanks. It made me trust you a bit more.”
“Odd,” Harry repeated with a grin. Draco hoisted him up by the arse, causing Harry to gasp in shock. “Draco!” he laughed.
“My jaw is sore,” Draco admitted, before delving back in with more intention than before. Harry’s knees buckled and he gripped the side of the windowsill to stay balanced. Draco hummed against him, and Harry felt his skin vibrate with the noise.
“I didn’t mean that we should go out I just said that in a weird way,” Harry clarified with a small pang of disappointment. Draco hummed.
“No one's perfect,” Hermione repeated firmly. “You'll be okay. I promise. This was your first fight. No one breaks up after the first fight. You made it three months without having any problems. That's a great accomplishment, Harry.”
“I stayed up really late last night with Ron and ‘Mione.” Harry shrugged. “How was Christmas? I got your letter.”
"Wait, I've seen her before," Harry interrupted his friends at the Hogwarts Feast that began the new school term. He pointed his finger at a toadlike woman sitting at the staff table where Alastor Moody - Barty Crouch, Jr. dressed as Alastor Moody, actually - sat the year before. The new Dark Arts Professor was wearing a sickening amount of  pink. Her makeup was all bright pink, her outfit, shoes, bow, and all. It made Harry's eyes hurt at the brightness. "She was at my trial."
“Oi, Harry!” Ron hissed from Harry's other side. “Stop eye-shagging each other, we can all see it.” Harry nearly choked on his chicken.
“Yeah,” Zabini chimed knowingly. “He would. So would everyone else. Get on with it, Potter.” Harry bit his cheek to stop a grin. “Or we’ll start guessing.” Draco rose a challenging eyebrow with a smirk. Harry hesitantly moved forward and his lips brushed Draco’s. The blond coaxed Harry’s mouth open with his tongue and it slipped inside. Harry thought he felt a smile on Draco’s lips but there was no way of knowing for sure and he didn’t want to stop the kiss. These kinds of kisses were rare; the post-orgasmic feeling always left them floaty and breathless, and when Draco did kiss Harry like this, he always left right after. Harry was still attempting - and failing, honestly - to deny any feelings past sexual attraction and he doubted Draco had any feelings for him at all. It wasn’t as if they had been friends before they started getting each other off. It was just sexual attraction, and Harry knew that. Several people started murmuring in shock and some gasped.
“It’s going to burn,” he warned quietly, “at first it’s going to hurt. You need to stay relaxed. It will make it easier and better.” Harry exhaled shakily and Draco straightened his body again. Harry’s legs got spread further apart on the bed. He felt the head of Draco’s slicked cock push against his hole and tried to stay relaxed like he was told. When the tip pushed in, Harry gasped and Draco stopped. Draco was right; it did burn. Not as badly as Harry had expected, but it was still quite uncomfortable. There was a hand running up and down his back, shoulders to tailbone, and that helped Harry relax.
“I’m going to clear some things up with Harry. There was a big misunderstanding and I just messed it up worse,” Malfoy answered. “I’ll be back soon, Sirius. I promise.”
“Honestly, Harry, I don’t like the relationship at all,” Hermione said when Harry brought it up again. “I mean, those marks he left on your neck stayed for
Draco sighed. “You're turning me into a Hufflepuff, Harry Potter.” Harry grinned and Draco whipped out the Polaroid to take another picture.
He was crying when Ron walked into the room. “You didn't come downstairs when Malfoy was leaving, I just wanted to—Harry? What's wrong, mate?” Ron came to sit next to him, enveloping him in a much needed hug.
“What about the other way around, then? If he got under the table, on his knees, and got you off with his mouth, would you be mad?”
“If you’re willingly giving up sex, you really must care,” Harry laughed quietly. He smiled into Draco’s collarbone.
The tip of Draco's tongue traced along the vein in Harry's neck. He sucked lightly on Harry's pulse point. Harry bit his lip.
Draco grabbed Harry’s chin with a hand and tilted it up towards his own face. He leaned down and planted a kiss to Harry’s lips.
“Sorry.” Harry shrugged and kissed him again. “You know, I think I rather like saying ‘I love you.’” Draco grinned and bit Harry’s lip, tugging on it lightly.
Harry’s eyes flew back open again in surprise and he squeaked unintentionally when Draco bit a small amount of skin on his collarbone.
“Oh,” Draco whispered. “I still write to my aunt, even though she married a Muggle. My mother’s side of the family disowned her because she ‘brought shame’ to the Pureblood line of the Blacks. I’m not even supposed to know about her, but family has a way of getting brought up in conversation.”
“You aren't going to talk to Charlie Weasley at all. I don't want you to look at him, talk to him, and you can't touch him.” He got very close and murmured in Harry's ear. “You're mine now, Potter, and I don't like sharing.” Harry's chin rested on Draco's shoulder, Draco's body essentially curled around his own, hugging him tightly and pressing their fronts together. His cheek pressed against Harry's. Harry exhaled a shaky breath when Draco reached down to palm his arse in both hands.
on Earth do you think you’re doing?” the voice of his mum asked shrilly. Ron spun around guiltily and saw his mother standing with her hands on her hips in the kitchen. “Where do you think you’re going, young man?”
The whole exchange was over far too soon and Harry walked back to Hermione and Ron's compartment, rubbing his bracelet affectionately.
“Oh?” Draco grinned. “I know this particular person, Weasley, I could set you two up. We’re quite good friends, and I know for a fact they have a certain affinity for Gryffindors.” Ron’s ears turned beet red.
“Shut up. I have a habit of demanding things and I’m… trying to break it,” he grumbled. Harry brought his hand up to Draco’s chest and his fingers started dancing over the flawless pale skin lightly.
“I… have to go in thirty minutes, but yeah, I guess,” Ron answered. Malfoy opened the door all the way and sat on his chair, leaving the small sofa available to Ron.
“Please don’t say anything. If you do, he and I could both get badly hurt. This is a new thing and we’re testing the waters, and would really like to keep it private for now,” he said quietly. Ginny hesitated for a second and Harry gave her a pleading look.
Draco fingered him open slowly and teasingly, and it drove Harry mad. He tried to pull Draco closer by the waist to get friction, but Draco just smirked and nibbled on Harry's earlobe. Harry retaliated by biting onto Draco's neck and avidly working on leaving a large bruise in his wake. He worked a hand in between their bodies and was pleased to find that Draco was already hard. “Draco—”
“Well, we tried,” the twins said in unison. The chatter that had paused now resumed around the table and Draco leaned to Harry's ear.
“Fred!” he yelled, chucking a pillow at the twin. Fred grinned when he caught it and threw it at Hermione. She spluttered and turned red, walking over and proceeding to smack Fred with the pillow repeatedly.
“What's going on, love?” Harry whispered. Draco didn't look him in the eyes and dug a divot into the dirt with the tip of his wand.
Harry was fucked. Absolutely and utterly fucked. He still had no idea what he and Draco were doing since it wasn’t dating and they weren’t fucking, but he’d seen a softer side to the Ice Prince. Like for instance, Draco wouldn’t go any further than blowjobs as much as he obviously wanted to. So he did have standards. And Harry was starting to really like him.
The question was vague but in the filthy tone that he said it, Harry knew what he meant immediately. “I—I want to ride you,” Harry replied quietly, having regained his senses. His chest fluttered from the kisses that Draco had pressed over his face. Draco shuddered behind him and nodded. They shifted and Draco moved so that he was on his back, holding Harry’s hips that were straddling him. Harry grabbed Draco’s cock under him and lowered himself onto it. It was different; sitting like this, and being so full.
“Draco!” he scolded, cheeks burning. Draco just grinned and they stood up, walking back into the house. “Look, about the whole Mark business, if you decide to not take it and you need to stay somewhere else, just come here. You'd have to share either the twins’ room or Ron's with me and him, but I'd rather you be here and safe than with people who would hurt you. Just make your decision on your own. I don't want you to feel forced either way.”
“Actually, I should be going back home,” Draco said. “I’d love to stay, really, but I told my mum I was going on a walk, and I've been here a while.” Harry followed him to the door.
“Harry, my father’s not a bit mad,” he laughed softly, “he’s a complete lunatic.” Harry grinned, and Draco kissed him lightly. “You should get dressed.”
“Get out, get out, get out,” he repeated. Red eyes flashed under his eyelids and maniacal laughter rang throughout his ears.
“Second year,” Harry said, “I’m not the heir to Slytherin, I was told that. But I tamed the Basilisk, I talked to it, I understood it, I figured out how to get into the Chamber. I met Voldemort's soul from before he was Voldemort. If I’m not the heir to Slytherin, then how did I do that?”
“Congratulations,” he managed to say, a bit hoarsely. Everyone else in the room congratulated Sirius and Remus while Harry was internally panicking.
Harry shrugged. “I’ve always had this weird… feeling, just a little question of whether I made the right choice in being a prick to him in first year. I know he treats us like shit, but I’ve seen how much he cares about his friends. And he’s not… unattractive.” He’s really fucking hot, in other words.
His normally natural-tanned skin on his throat was littered with purple, circular bruises that went all the way down to his chest. Harry’s face reddened. He regretted not bringing his wand. But then again, Harry didn’t know healing spells very well at all. Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair, grimacing when he realized that it was greasy. He stripped his shirt and pants off and stepped into a shower stall, turning it on hot enough that steam filled the whole bathroom.
“Fine.” He sat up and moved from straddling Draco’s hips to walk into the dorm. He fell on his bed and saw Draco walking to his own. He reached out and grabbed Draco’s hand, effectively getting the boy’s attention. “You’re warm,” he mumbled.
“No. No. It’s just… snogging.” He looked up at Malfoy again, but the blond wasn’t looking at him anymore. Harry felt a disappointed frown tug at his lips.
“So are you.”  Draco paused. “How about we just lie here tonight?” he asked. “I’ll fuck you senseless tomorrow, but I just want to lie down with you right now.” Harry smiled.
“I love you so much that I want to cry,” Draco said. “I want to be around you all the time. I want to hug you constantly, and I want to kiss you, and just be with you. Like a big stuffed animal.” Harry laughed softly.
“He’s… not wanting to talk to anyone right now,” Sirius answered cautiously. “Look, I don’t know what happened with him and Harry, but he’s torn up about it. He hasn’t come from his room, and the door’s locked.”
“Tu es trop fou pour moi,” Draco said in a joking tone. “You're too crazy for me.” Harry leaned back slightly and cuffed him on the shoulder playfully. They laughed. “Je t'aime. Je t'adore. Tu est parfait.”
“I don’t know, Hermione,” he said. “I’ve had dreams where I see what Voldemort’s seeing, and I have dreams where I am being controlled by Voldemort; it’s all so confusing, ‘Mione. I don’t know what to do or how to handle it.” He shook his head and lathered some conditioner into his hair. Draco sat on the edge of the bathtub and ran his fingers through Harry’s soapy hair, massaging his head soothingly. Harry dropped his hands back into the water and leaned into the touch. “Draco,” he sighed. Draco hummed. “You are perfect.”
“When Voldemort murdered my parents, guardianship of me was supposed to be passed to my godfather. Sirius Black. I'm sure you remember him.” Draco nodded softly, cheek resting atop Harry's head.
Stepping through the Floo, Ron was pinned with a cold stare from his mum on the couch. “What? I’m home fifteen minutes early,” he muttered.
“Oh, really? So if he asked you, right now, if you would go with him to Italy for a year, would you?” George countered.
“Ancient, traditional Pureblood families believe that anyone who’s less than 100% magical is a lesser being because they have 'contaminated blood.' Hence the slur, ‘Mudblood.'” Harry winced in sympathy for Hermione at the word. “It’s not…
“I… I—” Ron stuttered. “I was going to Sirius’ house. Malfoy and Harry had a fight. I want to tell him to stop being pissed off because Harry is up there sobbing in his sleep and I can’t let him keep thinking that it’s over because of one stupid thing that they both said. Mum, please let me go. Or come with me, I’m doing this for Harry.”
“Harry, what—what are you…?” She trailed off and her jaw worked but no sounds came out. Harry walked towards her and grabbed her arm lightly.
“You’ll never be free of me,” Voldemort’s voice echoed in Harry’s mind. His grip grew tighter on his hair, and tears spilled over onto his cheeks as he let out a loud, choked sob. His scar burned like a bitch.
“Yes, well, I don't care what your friends think of me. I couldn't be arsed to care about their opinions on something that hasn't anything to do with them,” Draco scoffed. “Your friends are utter Gryffindor arseholes.” Harry rose an eyebrow.
Harry grinned. “I appreciate that. I really do, but if you want to do something for me, just be with me.” He shrugged. Draco leaned forward and kissed his cheek.
Harry practically jumped on Draco, straddling his legs, and grabbed his face to kiss him enthusiastically. The sheer force of this gesture nearly toppled Draco over. “Say it again,” Harry requested breathlessly, between kisses. Draco's arms circled Harry's waist and pulled him close. “Draco, say it again.”
“You know I wouldn’t, right?” he asked. “That no matter what happens, or what changes, or anything, I'll never hurt you?”
I just posted ch 5 like a couple hours ago but I really wanted to write more and came up with another mini chapter, so here is more word vomit from me. Do what you will with it. It's 9:30 PM I've been writing for so long I need a damn life :/
“Harry,” Draco sighed in exasperation. “I could never be on that side knowing that I’d have to hurt you someday. No matter what kind of shit we go through, I'm fucking here for you. It's done. I've made my choice. And I'll never regret it.” He rolled his eyes. “You've turned me into a Hufflepuff.”
“Yes, well, you also got incredibly lucky in that department, and I am now regretting my choice.” Draco laughed quietly.
After a moment, realization dawned on Harry. He pulled away and Draco set him back down. “You're here. Why are you—are you okay? What's happened? Why aren't you at the Manor?”
“No, Harry!” Draco cut him off. He grabbed Harry's arms lightly and looked him in the eye. “Well, yes, but—”
Draco let go of Harry’s cock and ran a soothing hand down his stomach and leaned down, taking Harry's cock in his mouth.
“No,” Fred replied. “Tell me, Harry, if you two had the whole house to yourselves, and Malfoy wanted to bend you over this table and shag your brains out, would you object?”
"It means he'd let Malfoy eat him out in the courtyard of Hogwarts, Ronnie," Fred offered. Harry frowned thoughtfully.
As Harry still adjusted to being in Slytherin dorms and Slytherin-themed décor and Slytherin beds, Dean was talking and seemingly flirting with Blaise Zabini. So Harry could either seek out George or Draco, or he could read silently in his temporary bed. He chose to read silently.
“That’s rude.” There was a lull in conversation as Draco helped Harry out of his trainers and jeans. “Will you fuck me?” Harry asked suddenly. “Please? I really want you to.” Draco hummed softly and placed Harry’s legs in his pyjamas, pulling them up over his hips.
“Shh,” Draco cut him off breathily, “let me do this.” Harry nodded and continued to lightly suck at Draco's neck. He didn't even realize that he had been rolling his hips in small circles and riding Draco's thigh until his movements stuttered when Draco added another finger. He moaned softly and moved his head up to kiss Draco firmly on the lips. “Come on, Harry, I know you're close,” Draco whispered against Harry's lips. He was right. Harry was close. “Come—” He broke off his sentence as Harry started massaging his cock through his trousers. Draco bent his fingers and Harry bit down on his lip, wrapping his free arm around Draco's neck.
They’re gone the next moment and Draco leans back against the sink with a heavy sigh. Harry joins him again, standing beside him. “We have a daughter.”
“Trust me, they’re insufferable,” Harry agrees, pulling Draco away from the couple. They spend the next hour making small talk with everyone and assuring everyone they’re only here as friends.
Ginny shoots her brother a smile before changing the subject. “So, Harry. You’re the only one left.”
Draco looks up from his notes when Ron and Hermione find their way to his table in the library. “What bring you two here?
By the time he emerges, Harry is gone and the bed is empty and unmade. Draco rolls his eyes and grabs the wand he recognizes as his and makes the bed quickly. He finds a pair of black jeans and steals a sweater from off of Harry’s side before he pads downstairs. Astra is in the den, eating waffles and watching a muggle cartoon on the television. Harry greets hm with a smile and hands him a coffee. “We have a television?”
Draco clears his throat, as the little girl climbs her way up the side of the bed and curls into his side. “Uh, early September. We’ve just gotten accustomed to being roomed together.”
“I am rather dashing,” Draco agrees, making the trio all roll their eyes at him. “You look amazing yourself, Hermione.”
“You barely spoke to me in September of our 8th year. I’m just... I don’t want your mind shutting me down and not remembering because you want to spite me.” Harry tells him and Draco looks away, not wanting him to see the hurt in his eyes.
Harry leads him to a spot by the lake and conjures a large blanket for them sit on. Draco sits after Harry does, bending one leg at the knee to rest his arm on it. “You really like it here.”
The night of Slughorn’s party, Draco breathes deeply as he smoothes out his outfit. Ginny, Hermione and Pansy had picked it out the Saturday before at Hogsmeade. He wore a dark green turtleneck underneath a black blazer, black slacks and a pair loafers. He checked his hair once more before leaving his room and heading upstairs.
Harry grins and shakes his head. “No, you’re a sap for most everybody you care about. You just don’t hide it with me.”
“Papa, can we take Daddy home now?” The small girl, who Draco notes has Potter’s unruly hair and his own grey blue eyes, asks with a little yawn.
“From me.” Draco tells her, raising his eyebrows in a challenge. “I find it hardly fair that you can tutor Ron in the subjects he’s having a hard time in but Potter shouldn’t benefit from my tutoring.”
“Draco. It’s so good to see you,” Hermione says, smiling at him. Harry looks at her with angry eyes making her gaze at him, annoyed. “Just because
Draco’s sobbing now, mumbling Astra’s name. Harry sits beside him on the bed and cradles his face. “Malfoy, match my breathing.”
Harry heaves a sighs, rolling his eyes. “McGonagall is also pushing unity. Which means, Blaise and Pansy will be able to sit with their significant others. Meaning, you’ll either sit alone at the Slytherin table or you’ll sit at my table.”
He turns his focus back to the girls and sees Ginny place her hand on Pansy’s forearm. Ginny gives her a small smile and asks, “It’s you, isn’t it? My letters?”
“Mr. Potter, we should wait to see if his memory comes back on his own. Giving him information now could cloud his memory retrieval process.” The healer interrupts and Draco sends her a glare. He wants to know how he ended up here. How he landed Harry Potter and how he has a life and daughter with him.
“I got sad using the hairbrush you bought me,” Harry confesses with a sad look in his eyes. Draco brings a hand down from Harry’s hair, caressing his face. “I’m sorry.”
It’s so easy to calm down when Harry’s touching him. So easy to look into Harry’s eyes and match his breathing. When he’s calmed down, Pomfrey leaves them alone and Hermione asks, “What did you dream?”
. I really am sorry, Harry. I was only at the lake to make sure you were okay. I didn’t mean to listen in on any private conversations.”
“You were always the one with the ulterior motives,” Harry mumbles and Draco feels a pang of guilt in his chest.
“I’m in my 8th year at Hogwarts.” Draco says slowly. He swallows hard as he looks down at his left hand and sees the black metal band on his ring finger. “I cant be married. Who would want to-“
She eyes them both suspiciously before telling them, “I’m not sure I believe that you two are suddenly friends but, never the matter. Detention for you both tomorrow with Slughorn. Off to bed with you both.”
Harry cuts him off, “I go down to the lake to clear my head at night, I get terrible nightmares from the war. I thought I heard something a couple nights ago so, I asked Malfoy if he’d be willing to meet me at the door when I came in. Just to make sure I was okay.”
“If… If it was about us, together, it could be.” Harry starts, voice shaky. “Real, I mean. You and I.”
Draco pretends not to notice Harry’s staring, smirking about it in his bed at night. He can’t pretend he’s not attracted to Potter, that he hasn’t had a crush on him since the day he saw him on the platform. Of course he only started thinking about Potter’s dick inside him over the past year or two. He’s biding his time, making Potter wait for it so that when Draco does kiss him, it’ll be all the better.
“Answer the damn question, Malfoy!” Harry exclaims, drawing the attention of some surrounding students.
He knew there was no way Potter would know for sure that he was the one in the woods. But, as Potter had put it, he’d been watching him.
“Yeah, so?” Draco shrugs. “I’m gay, Dean’s gay, Blaise. Pansy, Ginny. Plus, you told everyone else. What’s the big deal?”
“Begged to stay at Ron and ‘Mione’s. Ron can’t say no.” Harry explains, shrugging his winter coat off.
“Papa, I’m hungry.” The girl whines, tugging on Potter’s robe. Potter leans down, bringing her up into his arms.
“Well.. I’m just- I didn’t think-“ Harry cuts his own stammering off with a sigh. He closes his eyes for a moment and takes a breath. “I just meant, that I’m glad. I didn’t realize it. I’m glad we can be after everything that’s happened.”
“I just know. I have a name picked out.” Draco tells him and Harry nods for him to go on. “Asterope Poppy Malfoy-Potter.”
The next morning he wakes up and almost thinks it was all a dream until he realizes that Harry is wrapped around him like a serpent. Their limbs are all tangled together and Harry’s long hair is down, messy and fucking everywhere. He pokes Harry in the side repeatedly until the other man groans. Harry’s lips starts a trail of open mouth kisses down Draco’s neck and Draco freezes. “Harry?”
“An older man?” Luna muses with a smile, leaning over into Neville who just takes Luna’s hand without looking up from his herbology book.
“What’s his problem?” Ron asks around a yawn. Harry purses his lips, shrugging and staring down at the book Draco had left behind.
Draco swallows hard and looks down. Harry grabs Draco’s chin with a firm hand and tilts his face up to look at him. “Which is when I told you that you’re worth the fucking world. And then well, we fight about who really kissed who but, you get the picture.”
Instead, he found Luna and Neville, wrapped up together on the couch while they read. Luna looks up when he entered the library and she smiles. “Draco, what are you doing here? I thought you’d gone home.”
“You should fix that, then.” Draco retorts and Harry uses his hands to rip Draco’s shirt open, sending buttons flying. “Harry! That was a nice shirt!”
“Okay, fine,” Pansy relents, tearing her eyes away from Ginny. “But if she says yes, I’m allowing myself one week of being wrapped up in her before I start trying to set you up.”
“What are you thinking?” Draco asks, looking over at Harry who’s staring at him with a weird look in his eyes.
Draco allows himself to feel a little warm at the thought of Hermione and Ron being his friends. “Where’s your better third?”
Harry holds Draco for a while, letting him cry. When he’s calmed down, Harry pulls back and gazes at him. “What did you dream about?”
Now he’s just feeling rejected. He knows Harry wants him, they’re married for bloody sake. But what if... what if he doesn’t want this version of Draco? What if his memories never come back and Harry leaves him. Where will he go? Back to his mother and father?
He decides to go in the direction of the library, head craning down every hallway he passes. He’s beginning to think he’s not going to be successful in his quest when hands pull him into an alcove.
Harry scoffs, pushing up from the table and stalking out of the great hall. Everyone near them falls quiet, looking to Draco. He sighs but, relents when everyone starts raising their eyebrows at him. When he exits the great hall, he looks around for a sign as to where Harry went.
Draco snorts at the thought of a Gryffindor who could’ve easily been Slytherin and the worst of the worst Slytherins raising a Hufflepuff daughter. “Think of the headlines.”
Pansy opens and closes her mouth several time and Harry winces behind Draco. He leans in close, his breath hot on Draco’s ear, and whispers, “She’s kind of crashing and burning.”
When he arrived where Harry was standing, he made a joke, “I see the hairbrush I got you was put to good use today. You look great.”
“I know.” Draco looks down at his hands, trying desperately not to cry. “I just can’t take seeing him look at me the way he did before.”
“You left after you heard what you wanted to hear!” Harry’s voice was hard and angry and it terrified Draco.
Draco has the urge to pull Harry’s tie off and see if the blush goes all the way down his chest. He shakes his head to clear it before yawning. Harry moves off the bed, “You must be tired.”
Harry holds him close, swaying along with the music. Draco pulls his head back, just slightly to ask, “Am I better dancer than Parvarti?”
Draco lets out a soft gasp before pulling Harry in for another kiss, this one soft and quick. When he pulls away, he whispers, “I love you, too. Now would you please get me to someplace private?”
“Maybe warn someone before you do that?” Draco says, making Harry laugh softly before pulling back in close to rest their head together.
“Don’t worry about him, Mum, he’s too busy day dreaming about Malfoy.” Ron quips and Harry’s head snaps up.
Draco looks around in a panic and realizes he’s at Hogwarts. Pomfrey is staring at him with a worried expression on her face. Ron is leaning against the window sill, arms crossed and a serious look on his face. Hermione is sitting on the edge on the bed, looking at him with worried and wide eyes. He bring his gaze to Harry, who’s standing at the foot of the bed with an apprehensive look on his face. His hair is cropped short and his face clean shaven. “No. No. Take me back.
“I don’t want to talk about it. It’ll never be reality.” Draco says, pulling his hands from Harry’s. “Can I go back to my room?”
Harry carries him up the steps and makes love to him that night and Draco will never forget the look of absolute love and adoration on Harry’s eyes when he came inside of Draco.
Draco makes a surprised noise before he shoves the butter beer into Blaise’s hands and clutches onto Harry’s shirt. It’s a passionate kiss, if chaste, and Draco pulls away and swallows. “What the hell was that?”
“You forgot about it?” Harry repeats, eyebrows drawing together. “I said some pretty personal things. I mean, you heard me say I was gay.”
“If that’s your story,” Draco taunts, looking back down at his notes, “Are you staying? There’s plenty of room at my table, nobody finds it fun to sit with a Malfoy anymore.”
Harry licks his lip before opening them to say something but, he’s cut off by the sound of someone calling from the other end of the hall, “Mr. Potter? Mr. Malfoy?”
Nothing changes after that, they still study and eat lunch together and get into spats. But they smile a little easier now, no longer feeling the entire weight of what they’d done to each other. They fumble through an awkward goodbye when Harry’s leaving with Ron to the Weasley’s for the holidays. Draco rolls his eyes eventually after listening to Harry stammer for a full minute and a half, reaching a hand out and pulling Harry into a quick, tight hug. “Have a good holiday, Potter.”
Draco smirks, “You’ve been looking at me, Granger? I’m flattered though, not surprised. I’m much more dashing than Weasley.”
If Draco hadn’t just came, he’d insist Harry do it now. Instead he smiles and replies, “As you wish, darling. Give me twenty minutes and you can put your mouth wherever you like.”
New Years passes quickly and before he knows it, he’s back on the train to Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione are whispering amongst themselves, giggling as they wait for the train to pull off. Harry’s staring out the window, trying to not feel as sullen as he probably looks. He looks up when the door slides open.
“Actually, I asked Draco to go with me,” Harry says and Draco turns to him with wide eyes. “I don’t particularly want to go with one of the… obsessed fans and Luna’s going with Neville this year. I thought, why not Draco? He’s my friend and I’m sure he’d enjoy going.”
“I don’t care.” Harry retorts with a snort. “Besides, in case you haven’t noticed, they’re all quite in love with each other. I mean, when did Seamus and Lavender even start dating?”
“Whoever it is, he started learning new hairstyles to do to impress them,” Hermione explains, carefully copying notes from a large book that sat in front of her.
He couldn’t face spending Christmas alone in the manor. He had a good long cry before he pulled himself out of bed on Christmas Eve and went to the library to find some peace in the form of a book.
Neville tilts his head before asking, “Why didn’t you go with Harry? You two are joined at the hip these days.”
The healer runs through a quick exam and signs some papers and then Potter’s picking the small girl up and telling her sit on the bench outside the room. When Potter comes back, Draco’s trying to get dressed by himself. “For Merlin’s sake, Draco. You did more damage than just messing your head up. You heard the healer say you would be sore.”
“Harry James Potter!” Molly shouts, smacking him on the head with a towel. “Draco Malfoy was a young boy who’s parents forced him into things he should’ve never been introduced to. How do you think he felt, walking down to his parents, away from all his friends and into Voldemort’s arms?”
It surprises Harry more than anything. He doesn’t quite realize they’re friends until one day, Dean leans around Blaise and asks, “Where’s Malfoy?” As if Harry is the one to know. Harry can’t fault him, he’d spent more time with Draco in the past months than anyone else. Which isn’t fair to Ron but Harry knows Ron’s had his hands a bit full with.. well, Hermione and navigating how to spend alone time with her when they don’t share a room.
“Harry,” Mrs. Weasley said, “you're awfully quiet. What's on your mind?” He paused, fork halfway to his mouth.
“I know, you nutter,” he replied.  “I need to rinse my hair out.” Draco kissed him again and let go of his face. Harry slid his head under the water and quickly scrubbed the conditioner out of his hair. When he resurfaced, he pulled out the plug in the bathtub and took the towel that Draco handed him.
“Are you tired?” Draco asked. Harry nodded. “Give me a kiss first. I'll take my New Year's kiss a few minutes early.” Harry smiled and looked up at him, wrapping an arm loosely around his waist when Draco kissed him lightly.
“Nothing, it’s just funny how Draco Malfoy is talking to me about subtlety,” he teased. “You aren’t exactly… not… what’s that word…” Harry grinned. “Well, anyway, you’re very dramatic.” Draco scoffed. “I’m serious, you have always had a… certain preference for it.”
“Like this, love.” He started running his fingertips lightly against the front of Freddie’s neck, and the white fluffy cat started purring again and nuzzling against Draco’s hand. Harry rose an eyebrow.
“Language, Harry,” Remus scoffed fondly, shaking his head. “Good Lord, who taught you to swear like that?”
“I said don't make a choice because of me! Fuck, and that's what you did, I didn't want you to choose because of anything other than what you thought was right.” Harry looked to his side and avoided looking at Draco.
“One more thing. What's the thing you always say? The word that I can't understand, and you told me what it meant yesterday?”
“Yeah?” Draco smiled and nodded. Harry sighed. “Your dimples are the best things, they're so cute.” Draco's cheeks went pink.
“I mean...” Draco shrugged. “If I ever do get married, I would like it to be to you.” Harry tried to contain a grin and failed.
“Smile, everyone,” Mrs. Weasley said cheekily. Fred poked Harry in the side and Harry cried out in surprise, letting out a loud bark of laughter. The camera flashed one last time, and then Harry was tossed on the sofa ungraciously.
“Davis. Truth or Dare,” Harry called over Draco’s shoulder. His gaze returned to the Slytherin sitting over his lap. “You’re not gonna move, are you?”
“Oh, no, dear,” she hurried, vanishing the washcloth from her hand. “I've just finished up. You look troubled. What's bothering you?”
He felt his abdomen tense and pressed his lips together in a thin line to prevent from making any more embarrassing noises. Harry’s toes curled and he clenched his jaw as he came down Draco’s throat. The blond milked every drop of come from Harry’s cock and then tucked him back into his trousers and zipped him back up again. Harry parted his lips and let out a small sigh, releasing his death grip on the bench. Draco nudged his legs to one side and Harry felt him crawling out under the bench. Harry froze. But Draco was invisible when he left and apparently took the opportunity to give Harry a kiss on the cheek before leaving. He was using Harry's bloody cloak.
“Wait—” Harry sighed. “We need to talk,” he finished in a whisper, talking to the empty space in front of him. He picked up his bag that had fallen onto the ground and walked towards the Great Hall for supper, still uncomfortably hard.
“Well, it looked like that snake in the dream I had last year,” Harry recalled, “the one that was by Voldemort. It ate an old man.” Draco pulled away and looked him in the eyes.
They walked through the wild cornfields, hand in hand, until they reached a small frozen pond that Harry had never seen before. They lied down in the surrounding snow and watched the sky, making idle conversation.
“I know what I said, Draco,” Harry murmured. “Why’d you stop massaging my head?” Draco grinned and moved to sit right in front of him, cupping his cheeks and kissing him.
“I'm sure they'd understand. I’m protecting their beloved golden boy, after all.” Draco's eyes held a sort of fiery determination that made Harry realize just how lucky he was to have such an amazing boyfriend. “Je t'adore,” Draco suddenly murmured the odd phrase again, pressing their foreheads together and looking Harry in the eyes, “it means I love you.”
“No!” She drew back in shock. Harry realized that the whole Gryffindor table was now looking at them in curiosity. Harry shrunk in his seat and used the drawstrings to close his hood more. His eyes met Malfoy’s again, who was laughing at his sudden outburst. Harry glared at him.
“Okay!” Mr. Weasley called for order. “Unwrapping gifts time! But first, I want to thank Mr. Potter here for saving my life at the Ministry.” He paused and Harry gave a tight smile, observing the arm sling and various purple bruises on Mr. Weasley's face and neck. “Without him, I probably wouldn't be here today.”
“Damn, okay! I'm coming! Gimme a sec!” He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and threw the door open. “It's nine thirty in the morning! What do you guys want?” he asked the twins exasperatedly.
“My mum was the murder, then. When Voldemort killed her, he put part of his soul in me,” Harry murmured. “Is—is that why I can speak Parseltongue?” His eyes widened and he looked at Draco. “I have him inside of me, in my body, in my head, Draco—”
“Well then, I suppose I'll have to see you more often,” Draco replied warmly. “I'll see you all around.” He went to kiss Harry's forehead again. “Don't forget about me, Potter,” he warned. Harry rolled his eyes.
“Mmm… just a few trinkets you've likely never heard of, a few odd robes and trousers.” Draco shrugged. “And of course, you.”
“I’m not just going to watch you be stressed out and confused and do nothing,” Draco replied. “I can’t fix everything for you, but I want to help.” He laughed quietly. “Even if it’s just soapy massages in the bath.” Harry smiled softly.
When he woke up, he was still in Draco’s embrace, but it was ice cold. He moved backward and saw that Draco’s skin, usually his ethereal pale, had turned a shade of sickly grey. Harry sat upright immediately. “Draco?” he asked in a stage-whisper. “Draco. Draco!” He grabbed Draco’s wrists and placed his fingers on the inside of them, searching for a heartbeat. He found one, steady, but Draco’s veins were black instead of blue and his mouth was twisted into a troubled frown. Something that he never wore while sleeping. His expression would always be peaceful.
“I won't,” Draco replied quietly. “I love you.” He kissed Harry quickly and squeezed his hand before looking at Molly. “It was lovely getting to know you all, Mrs. Weasley. Harry really does have the best family he could.”
Hermione looked over from where she and Ron were talking at the windowsill and smiled, beckoning Harry over to sit with them. “How was Grimmauld Place?” she asked.
“It's fine. I would have had the same reaction.” Harry smiled at her and she sighed, blushing, and looked away.
“When we get back to Hogwarts, I want you to fuck me until I can’t walk,” Harry gasped. “Fill me up so many times that I forget how to stand right." Draco bit at his shoulder. “Your lips are so soft.”
“Astoria Greengrass is a Third Year and a girl. No part of that is appealing to me,” Draco said. Harry bit his cheek. “And I can’t help it if I’m appealing to her.”
“Malfoy?” he called. “I know you’re in there. Open the door.” No one answered. Ron rattled the handle to his door. “Open up. Talk to Harry, Malfoy. I know he sent you a letter. You didn’t answer.” Ron groaned lightly and his forehead fell onto the door. “He’s been crying since your fight. He’s dry heaving in his sleep. Please open the door. Tell him it’s not over. Just… tomorrow, make sure he knows that you’ll at least talk to him.” He paused. “He loves you. He told me what happened, and if you heard what he heard, you’d think the same. You both overreacted. He jumped to conclusions, and you didn’t hear him out. Open the door.”
Harry hummed and did it again. Draco's arms tightened around him. Harry's tongue poked out and curiously laved over the spot. Draco's hands shot up to his hair and pulled lightly, making Harry look him in the eyes. Draco's face was flushed, his grey eyes dilated, and he was breathing heavily.
“Well… kind of. I don't mean put an ad in the Prophet or anything, just not hide. I want to be able to kiss you when I see you in the halls and come up behind you for a hug. I don't want to have to hide.” He leaned closer. “I want to be able to whisper in your ear, and I want to hear you laugh at what I’m saying, and I want to see you light up when I say I love you in the middle of the Great Hall.”
He wasn’t sure what it was, maybe it was him being hyper-aware that people were watching him snog someone or just that Draco’s lips were scorching hot, or maybe it was the Veritaserum that everyone took before the game that heightened his senses, but Harry felt every single movement. Every slide of Draco’s tongue against his, every bite on his lip and every shift of fingers in his hair, every gasp of air. He was sure he was blushing, the telltale sign of burning cheeks gave it away, but Draco’s body was like a furnace against his and the blush was likely unnoticeable.
“Draco, dear, you've got a Floo call,” Mrs. Weasley said when they walked through the door. Draco went to sit in front of the fireplace and Harry sat on the stairs to wait for him.
did you like it? leave a kudos! it boosts my very low self-esteem and makes me happy that you like what i'm writing. love u guys
Harry turned around to where he saw Ron sitting with his mum on the couch. "Thank you," he whispered. Harry walked to Ron and wrapped his arms around the boy’s lanky shoulders tightly. “Thank you,” he said again. Ron returned the hug.
“This sounds like I'm being accused of something,” Draco mentioned slowly. “Am I being accused of something?”
“Well, then, I suppose you'll have to get me something meaningful instead of material. I rather do like one of a kind things.” Draco kissed Harry's shoulder. “It can be added to my collection.”
hope u liked it :) I've had such a shitty past few weeks, and I almost forgot about this. I'm really sorry it was posted a few days later than normal but I have been wallowing in self-pity and misery because my therapist's office forgot to fucking schedule my appointment so I went a month without seeing her instead of two weeks as is usual. kudos and comments are still always appreciated. I love you all and I hope you're having a better time than I am in life.
“Both of you, come downstairs!” Ron yelled. The stairs thumped and the door squeaked, and Ron appeared in the doorway. “For fuck’s sake,” he huffed after noticing that Harry was sitting on top of Draco. “Whatever. Come on, we’re having tea.”
“Fuck, you’re so small and tight around me, Harry,” he groaned. “You should see yourself like this. Gorgeous.” Harry blushed. The only thing going through his mind was
“If you had to shag anyone in the room, who would it be?” Harry asked, ignoring Draco’s hungry look.
“You actually want to take me to stay in a palace in Amsterdam for my birthday?” Harry asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Excuse me, I need Harry's help with something for a moment,” Draco said after a few minutes. He set his tea down and stood, pulling Harry gently along with him outside.
Dumbledore held up a hand to silence him. “Phineas, please wake professor McGonagall. She’ll want to hear about this. Have her inform the Weasley children.” A portrait to Dumbledore’s left nodded and disappeared from his frame. “I shall send Madam Pomfrey to the Ministry, and inform the Minister, St. Mungo’s, and the DMLE. I appreciate you telling me this, Harry, not to worry. Mr. Weasley will be taken care of. I’m going to need a description of your dream. Where were you? If you can pinpoint the exact place in the Ministry, it’d be most helpful. How did you witness the attack?”
“I dunno, Malfoy, I just might,” he replied. “I mean… have you seen Charlie Weasley?” Draco growled in the back of his throat and brought Harry's body flush against his own by the hips.
“He's trying to be better,” Harry replied softly. “The reason he was here today was that he's just been told that Lucius wants him to take the Dark Mark.”
“I can’t seem to remember either,” Harry agreed, grinning in satisfaction. Draco grabbed Harry’s free hand and kissed it lightly.
It felt like a bloody eternity before Draco was fully seated and Harry felt his hips press against his own. His hands were clenched in his pillow. The only sounds filling the air were Harry and Draco’s heavy breathing. Finally, Harry hissed, “Move.”
“Wh—no! George Weasley!” she scoffed. “Don't go mad, you're far too young. I'm not giving any underage person in this house any alcohol at all.” George sighed and shrugged to Fred on his left.
“When I was young, and I couldn't sleep, my mother would always come in and cast it,” Draco murmured. “She'd sit on my bed and point every single star and constellation out until I fell asleep.” He pointed to the star right above them. “That's the North Star. The spell causes it to be drawn to the brightest thing in the room. It's over here because of your eyes.”
"Shut up, Potter," Draco mumbled, biting his lip in a clear attempt to hide a smile and failing. "I said no such thing, and you heard nothing to suggest otherwise." Harry grinned and shook his head, pulling Draco out of the empty room and continuing down the hall.
“But the reason that you chose is still me,” Harry replied with a hoarse voice, eyes watering. “What if you decide later that you made the wrong choice because of me and you regret it?”
“It's hard to call them family because they treat me more like a rat that they can't get out of their house than their nephew. I get two-minute showers every other day. If I stay in longer they turn the water freezing cold until I got out. They won't let me eat with them; I always eat in my room. Sometimes I'm not able to eat at all. Not always because I'd been particularly bothersome that day, but because I existed.
“My father… I was just told that—” He broke off with a shaky breath. “Fuck, I told myself I wouldn't cry.” Draco recomposed himself for a moment before continuing. “I've just been informed that I'm scheduled to—take the Mark this summer.”
“We’re walking. And talking. We don’t know enough about each other. Just the bad things and the sex things.”
“Well, Slytherins are known to be ambitious,” he said pointedly as he tied the makeshift necklace around Harry's neck.
“Is that your way of saying you want me to sleep with you tonight?” Draco rose an eyebrow. Harry nodded awkwardly into his pillow. Draco walked around to the other side of Harry’s bed and climbed under the covers, his body like a furnace against Harry’s back. Draco threw an arm around Harry’s waist and pulled them impossibly close to each other. Harry could feel Draco’s breath ghost across his skin and could smell Draco’s vanilla conditioner as he drifted off to sleep.
“We’re snogging, Potter,” Draco replied. Harry shook his head and turned his face when Draco leaned in to kiss him again.
“A little,” Harry admitted. Draco moved one hand away from him and a few seconds later something soft was pressing into Harry's side. He looked over at it and saw a light grey sweatshirt, complete with a hood, a pocket, and drawstrings. “Is this yours?”
underneath the word Parseltongue. “Umm… anything else?” He gasped after a moment. “Mind! You saw Mr. Weasley get attacked! You said Nagini was there.”
“Then don’t let me be anyone.” Harry clenched his jaw and hands. “C’mon, Potter, I’m sure I can do better than whatever immature little kid tried to take care of you.”
“I'm sorry, that looks nothing like a dragon to me,” he admitted. Draco laughed and carded his fingers through Harry's wild hair.
“Draco, go home. I love you and I want you to stay, but you have to sleep. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Go to bed.” Harry kissed his cheek. “You should sit with us tomorrow. It's a step of subtlety, right?” Draco nodded. “Also, you have a little—” He poked Draco's neck where the love bite was. “Just here.” Draco's hand flew up to his neck to cover it.
Draco pulled back to stare at Harry, his eyebrows furrowed. “Are you sure?” Harry nodded. Draco’s grey eyes were blown with lust, and Harry thought his probably were as well. Draco stuck three fingers past Harry’s lips and stroked the sensitive top of his mouth until Harry began sucking on the fingers obediently.
Harry hummed contentedly. “I love you, too.” He pulled the necklace out from under his shirt and twisted it around his finger loosely. “I seem to remember a bet? And a promise?”
Later, in bed, Harry and Ron were talking to each other with the lights out, lying next to each other on the bottom bunk that Harry used during his stay at the Burrow.
“Shh, just a moment,” he interrupted. Harry frowned at his friends, who shrugged. Hermione watched Draco attentively. Draco placed a Sticking charm on the parchment against the compartment wall. “Granger, the statistics for Parseltongue… the language is practically nonexistent,” Draco murmured, tapping the quill against his lower lip. “How on Earth do we know two people who can speak it?”
“Draco?” he asked softly, voice carrying over the oddly quiet living room. Draco looked over and stood, setting his teacup down. Harry ran to his boyfriend, wrapping his arms around Draco's neck and grinning when Draco picked him up slightly off the floor with strong arms around his waist.
Harry shrugged. “I splurged on books for her,” he replied. “Arithmancy, Transfiguration, and Charms, mostly, ‘cause those are her favorite subjects, but there are also some Advanced Potions and Magical Creatures books in there as well.”
“The only way it's even possible is because Remus is a werewolf. Lycanthropy is very interesting in that way. Male pregnancies are impossible unless you or your significant other is a lycanthrope.”
“No. You shouldn't have,” Draco agreed tightly. Harry hugged his torso, knees coming up to trap his arms against his own stomach. Tears unnecessarily pooled in his eyes and he forced himself to blink them away.
“I love it, Harry,” Draco said, chastely kissing Harry's nose. He took the camera from the box and brought it up to his eye, pointing it at Harry. Harry blushed, covering his eyes with the sleeves of his—well, Draco's—sweatshirt. “Oh, come on, let me see your face.” Harry shook his head. “You give me an instant camera, and then are surprised when I want my first picture to be of my boyfriend?”
The bell rang and Harry almost didn’t register it, but Malfoy backed off and pulled Harry’s hood back up before running off.
“I thought there’d be more feeling up,” Hannah said sadly. Harry gasped as Draco's hand immediately found its way to the front of his jeans and squeezed.
trying, I know my father’s and You-Know-Who’s beliefs are wrong, that this is a pointless path that will lead in death or Azkaban for fifty years. I just can’t be a better person overnight. It’s going to take time. I don’t want... people to think I’m not trying.” Draco took a step towards Harry as they walked, and when Harry didn’t move away, Draco grabbed his hand. Harry squeezed it and let out a surprised yelp when Draco pulled them into a quiet passageway.
“Hermione!” he cried. “Can't you trust me when I say he's not like that? He's a good person! You don't have to trust him, but trust me. I’d like you to at least give him a chance, before dismissing my judgment. And I'm not just saying bullshit, I know. I know because he just told me that he would fuck up anyone who tried to mess with me.” Hermione's eyes widened and she opened her mouth to reply, but Harry walked out of the compartment and to the open end of the train, sliding the door shut behind him. His eyes stung.
“Mnh—” Draco slipped his hands under Harry’s shirt and grabbed his hips. “Again with the low hanging trousers,” he mumbled.
Draco cupped Harry’s cheeks and whimpered in the back of his throat that made Harry smile. “I really fucked things up,” Draco mumbled, “Weasley helped me realize it. Shockingly.” Harry chuckled.
Draco doesn’t mean to start… watching Potter. He will not call it stalking because that’s not what he’s doing. He’s just curious about what Potter’s up to these days. If he’s doing okay, if he’s happy. If he’s handling the breakup with Ginny alright. He’s merely worried about Potter’s wellbeing.
“What are you two doing out of bed at this hour?” McGonagall asks, eyebrows drawn together. “Has something happened?"
“Hey, look at me.” Harry says softly, making Draco bring his gaze back to Harry’s eyes. “Is that why you’ve been so apprehensive? With admitting your feelings, with telling people, with.. with sex? Because you thought I was going to leave you?”
Draco’s heart is in his throat as Harry leans in, pressing a chaste kiss to Draco’s lips. When Harry goes to pull back, Draco cups the back of his head and brings him back. Harry makes a surprised noise in the back of his throat, his hand coming up to twist into Draco’s shirt. They kiss for a long few seconds before Draco pulls away, nipping at Harry’s bottom lip as he does. Harry’s sighs fans over Draco’s face, “Was that in you dream?”
He’s not looking where he’s going and bumps into someone. He doesn’t look up as he merely mumbles an apology. The person grabs his arm and he looks up and sees Ron looking at him with curious eyes. “Malfoy. What’s wrong?”
January drags by, everyone trying to get into the groove of the new semester. Harry stays up some nights, muttering as he studies and scribbles notes furiously. Draco simply tells him to tell him if he’d like help and closes his bed curtains. Harry hates that Draco can get away with not driving himself crazy with studying and still make perfect scores.
Draco nods and moves closer to Harry. “In case it wasn’t obvious, I’m not going anywhere. I’m- Damn it, Harry, I’m falling in love with you.”
Except then Harry walks in on Luna sitting on the bathroom counter with her dress pushed up and Neville’s hand up her thigh. And then once he’d apologized he finds that Pansy’s snuck Ginny into the party, they’re tucked in a corner whispering in each other’s ears. Ron and Hermione have taken to a loveseat, leaning in close and laughing at each other. Seamus and Lavender are wearing each other’s sweaters and smiling at each other like the sun shines out of their asses. Dean and Blaise are having a hard time paying attention to Draco in favor of looking at each other. And Harry notices more and more couples as he looks around the classroom.
It’s a month a half after Draco lost his memories when he kisses Harry. They’d already put Astra down and Harry was reading a book on memory retrieval. He was telling Draco about how most cases have a full recovery. Draco had been thinking about kissing him for a couple weeks and he finally builds the courage to do it. He’s on side, elbow propped up with his palm holding his head up. He reaches over, moves the book and leans forward. Harry’s very still as Draco kisses him, as if he’s afraid Draco will change his mind. When he realizes he’s not pulling back, Harry tosses the book aside and cups Draco’s jaw in a firm hand.
Pansy had pointed out countless guys to Draco, some younger, over the past two weeks. Each other Draco turned down, making up some excuse. He didn’t like their nose. Their hair was weird. Their laugh was way too loud. He saw them pick their nose and eat it once.
They sit in silence for a long time before Draco stands in a rush of determination. “This is stupid. I’m not going too hide away just because Harry Potter doesn’t like me. It’s nothing unusual for me.”
Harry recoils back like he’s been stung and Draco pushes back from the table and snaps, “For someone who supposedly loves me, you sure are cruel.”
“It was December, Christmas time. I was packing my bag, the Weasley’s had invited Hermione and I for the holidays. You were staring out the window and you looked… so sad.” Harry starts, holding Draco’s gaze. I asked if you were joining your Mum for the holidays and you told me that your Mum of course wanted you to come home but, you Father didn’t. I was so angry. I wanted you to come with us to the Weasleys.”
“Thanks.” Harry sits, setting four different books on the table along with notes from various classes.
Ten years later at their Hogwarts reunion, everyone will let them know that everyone had been making bets on them since before Christmas holidays. That no one was surprised when Harry kissed Draco, only surprised that it took them that long to admit it to everyone.
“I didn’t know they were.” Draco answers, eyebrows drawn together. “Probably because I’ve spent the better of the semester staring at you.”
“You have nothing to apologize for,” Draco whispers, leaning froward and dropping a kiss to Harry’s nose. “We’re here now, that’s all that matters.”
Harry breathes angrily through his nose before replying, “That’s not what I asked. I asked if you were in the woods last night.”
Potter narrows his eyes but leaves Draco sitting alone at the end of the Slytherin table with his near empty cup of tea.
“I got distracted.” Draco defends himself, pushing Harry down on the bed and kissing wet kisses down his chest. Harry’s squirming by the time Draco kisses down his stomach and all over his thighs.
Harry stares down at him with an unreadable expression. His hair was cropped short on the sides, long at the top and styled carefully so it resembled that of his hair in fifth year. “It was too much work.”
Draco suddenly feels very left out, eyes glancing between Blaise and Pansy who are both giving him apologetic looks.
“Perhaps,” Draco agrees. If there was one thing Draco was unsure of, it was if Harry would ever forgive him.
Hermione reaches across the table then, capturing his hand with a squeeze. “Which is perfectly fine. When you’re meant to be with someone, it’ll happen. No need to rush it.”
And so they go home to their house on the countryside, walking up the familiar steps and tripping over Harry’s clothes strewn about. And they paint their daughter’s bedroom door purple with her name in black lettering. Harry grows his hair and beard out, making Draco squirm when he runs is chin down Draco’s thighs. They buy a television and hang pictures on the walls. Astra’s born and she fills their home with laughter and makes them feel complete. And they slip off into a little slice of heaven.
“Of course.” Harry blurts, gathering up his books, scarf and mittens and throwing them in the overhead compartment. Draco settles his things in the same place before siting beside Harry and promptly opening a book.
They stay that way, Draco reading and Harry trying hard not to stare, until Ron and Hermione fall asleep on each other. It seems as though Draco was waiting for the very moment they passed out because he marks his page and sets the book aside. “How was your Christmas?”
He’s ends up taking a nap and when he wakes, it’s dark in the room. He sits up quickly, taking quick, short breaths. He jumps when a hand smooths over the small of his back and then remembers. He sighs a breath of relief as Harry blinks sleepily. “You’re okay, I’m here.”
“Whatever, Weasley,” Draco spits out before pulling his arm from Ron’s grip and practically running towards the dungeons.
Harry goes to their room by himself, waving off Ron and Hermione. Draco’s hanging his clothes, his back to the door. Harry closes the door and tosses the book onto Draco’s bed. “You left this.”
Harry finds it hard to concentrate on anything that holiday. He’s too caught up in his own mind, wondering if Draco is having a good Christmas. If Draco’s family is treating him well. If Draco is missing him as much as Harry misses him.
“Completely understandable considering that you didn’t like me much before December of our 8th year.” Harry says carefully. “I’m not saying you didn’t care but we both can admit that we were not on even friendly terms let alone terms to allow us into a relationship.”
Harry’s out of bed and crossing the space between their beds in a second, crawling in beside Draco. He pulls Draco into his arms, “I’m here. I’m right here. I’m not dead, I’m here.”
Harry sighs with a small smile forming on his face. “You just.. you make me curious. I want to know everything about you.”
Harry wants to kiss Draco all night, wants to claim him so that people will stop asking if he likes anyone. So that the girls will stop teasing Draco about having a crush on some seventh year. (Which he doesn’t, by the way. ) But he can’t just allow himself to be happy publicly like that not when everyone is still grieving.
Ron shakes his head. “Nah, pretty sure it’s a bloke. He everyone a month ago he gay, or at least bi. He’d wanted everyone to know because he thought this one guy was cute. Never told us who.”
Hermione’s face turns red and Harry snorts. Ron looks between Draco and Hermione and decides to interfere before Hermione replies. “Hermione, he has a point. You basically gave me the answers to the potions homework yesterday. Malfoy’s just letting Harry look over his notes.”
Draco fumbles over his words as Harry sends him a pointed look. “Goodnight, Astra. Love- Love you, too.”
“You uh, you bring me poppy’s whenever I’m cross with you.” Harry explains, a blush creeping onto his face.
“Malfoy, I’m- I’m sorry.” Harry says, tone sad and eyes sympathetic. “I never thought us being friends would affect your home life.”
Draco is late to meeting Pansy, who’d asked him to meet her at the clock tower before lunch. He’s pushing past people when he runs straight in a chest.
Luna pats the space beside her and gestures for Draco to come over. When he sits, uncomfortable, she asks, “What was the fight about?”
“I only wanted to go to get answers from Slughorn for Dumbledore.” Harry stands, holding out a hand to Draco. “C’mon, lets ditch it.”
“Is that was brought on the two buns? And God, the frustration that he had trying to learn those stupid braids.” Ron lets out a groan at the thought of his best friend doing his hair.
Draco thinks on how to reply before he says, “You’re right. I hated you in early September. You saved my life and I just hated you, wanted nothing to do with you at all. Why would I possibly want to have you now?”
“Save me your excuses, Malfoy.” Draco rears back like he’s been slapped at the sound of his surname coming out of Harry’s mouth like it’s a bad taste.
“Why did you never tell me? I understand why you didn’t at first, we were hardly friends and I had threatened telling McGonagall,” Harry rambles, a confused expression on his face. “But, we’ve been friends for months and you never told me.”
Harry convinces Hermione to let him take Draco to their shared room. Draco’s body is aching and sore so he has to lean on Harry the whole way there. When they reach the bedroom, Draco collapses on the bed and immediately slips under his blankets and curls up facing the wall. Harry lingers, “Do you need anything?”
“Ron took care of it. He’s quite fond of both of you.” Harry says, a small smile forming at the look of disbelief on Draco’s face. “Lucius hasn’t been allowed around either of you since.”
“I’ll buy you another.” Harry mumbles on his way to kiss down Draco’s fucking lovely neck, sucking a purple/red spot that has Draco letting out breathy little moans. “I think something was said about you sucking me off.”
Harry rolls his eyes and says, “Please, they’ll be too scared to approach me with you scowling. You won’t have to do anything out of the ordinary.”
Ginny sighs, running her hand over the spot in her robe that she’d stuck in her letter in. “I don’t know. All I know is, they’re in 8th year.”
Draco looks at Potter as the boy - man - takes the shirt from Draco and instructs him fo lift his arms. He obeys and Potter slips the hospital gown off his shoulders. He slips a snug black turtleneck over Draco’s head and arms. Draco holds his breath as Potter leans in close to his neck, perfecting the fold of the turtleneck. “How did this happen?”
Draco wakes slowly, a bright light shining in his eyes as he groans. He blinks against the light and looks around to see he’s in a hospital. There’s a healer beside him, scribbling in his chart. “What happened?”
Draco sends her a look that has her rolling her eyes and pulling a brush out of her bag on the floor. He thanks her and turns back to Harry. “Brush your hair.”
“Love you, more.” Harry whispers back. “Next time. I want your cock so far down my throat that I can’t breath.”
Harry emerges a few minutes later, holding his own bag that’s much smaller than Draco’s. “I got you something.”
Harry rolled his eyes, tugging his clothes off right there in front of Draco. As much as Draco hated to do it, he tore his gaze away and didn’t look up again until the bathroom door had shut behind Harry. Of course he should’ve just closed his bed curtains because he nearly chokes on his spit when Harry walks out in just a low hanging towel.
her. I’ve never seen anyone able to get you to drop your defenses quicker than she can. She doesn’t want for anything.”
Harry’s laughter peters out and he swallows hard. “Are you sure you don’t want to wait until they come back?”
It’s dead silent as everyone waits for their reaction. Harry glances at him and Draco decides not to ruin the fun by refusing to go with Harry. “Great, I get to spend all day fending Potter off from his adoring fans.”
They leave for Christmas break the day after he and Harry fight. Pansy is spending Christmas with the Weasley’s, her parents being in Azkaban for supporting Voldemort. Blaise and Dean are spending Christmas Eve at Blaise’s and Christmas Day at Dean’s. Luna and Neville were spending Christmas at Hogwarts. Draco’s sure that Harry is with the Weasley’s as well.
Draco nods and let’s himself relax a little. They have a cup of tea and Hermione leaves him a couple books on memory triggering before she has to get back to Hogwarts.
“Hey, Mrs. Weasley?” Harry poked his head cautiously into the empty kitchen where Molly Weasley was washing the dining table with a washcloth.
“I mean… I suppose,” Harry replied slowly, confused. “I've been really pissed off before and I've almost cried…”
“You know,” Harry mumbled after they pulled away, noses still touching, “I think I might rather like you.” Draco grinned.
“Yes. I just want to make sure you know.” He ran his fingers through Harry’s damp hair and smiled. “You’re so cute.” Harry blushed.
The room was filled with various cheers and hollers, and Harry saw Ginny come to sit next to him on the sofa.
“It’s an item, or in your case, a person that another person has put part of their soul into to remain immortal,” Draco said. “That’s why when Weasley said that, it triggered something. I’ve read about this. And I think maybe I’ve heard You-Know-Who talk about it in passing, I just never really paid any attention to it. It’s one of the darkest practices of magic, because in order to split your soul, you have to lose some of your humanity.”
“Who said they didn’t?” a voice asked from a couple feet away. Draco leaned his shoulder against the wall, wearing nothing but loose pyjama trousers. Harry again tried to tug his wrist out of the boy’s grip. “I’d let go of him, if I were you, Nichols. I’m sure no one is a fan of being called an immature little kid, and Potter evidently isn’t fond of you manhandling him as you are. I can't imagine the world of trouble you'd be in if you keep trying to take advantage of the Chosen One.”
