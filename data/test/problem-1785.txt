“How would you know that?”
Draco didn’t answer. He just stood up and threw his cardigan back on.
"Very likely, yes."
The third outfit—a coal long sleeved turtleneck adorning his torso, and grey trousers enveloping his legs—falls loosely on his thin frame. Draco has not gained his whole weight back yet, but he looks good. Taller and respectable, but approachable. He wants to make a good impression and he’ll be damned if he thinks that wearing an old Muggle piece will do.
As the holidays drew close, Draco set up a meeting to talk about the house. First, Draco wanted to discuss redecorating, which he took so seriously, Harry began to think the colour of the wallpaper in the hallway might itself be a matter of magical importance.
"These things are much more tolerable if you bring someone with you," Ginny said. They stood at the edge of the dance floor, where Luna was whirling around a Junior Kestrels player who could have been her sister, throwing off light as the spangles on her gold dress caught the firelight.
"Being on the cover of
Words his mother used to say whenever Draco complained about hunger come crashing into his head.
“What have you done?” Hermione’s expression looks like a mix between anger and hope. Her best friend is awake again, after so long, and she must feel something other than suspicion. She seems wary, but Draco doesn't judge that. He expects it. She's the smart one, after all, and she didn't support his suicidal plan.
Charms checked and in place at the entrance, and the door was finally open for us.
The first time Draco came to a session, he was lost, irreparably broken and terrified. He had isolated himself in Muggle London, hoping the world would forget about him and he could live the rest of his life in peace.
Draco was a terrible liar, once you had your eyes on him. He was too honest, as if he forgot that Harry could read the covetous glitter in his eyes versus Draco setting his shoulders back to remind himself of why this was a terrible idea. It was all there, the push-pull of desire and prudence warring with lowered inhibitions. Draco was still standing close, breath hot on his lips, tempting. Harry stole one more kiss. The door swung open, and Theo stumbled in on them in the hallway and turned back.
Draco nods, grinning with  flushed cheeks. “Yes, I do.”
home. The fire was crackling on their stone hearth and it was
However lonely Draco’s life has always been, his monochromatic existence had been briefly splotched with colour when Harry was by his side. How can he get used to that now when once had so much more?
Draco sighs as the spell translates her health back as a silver floating line around her chest, so different from the usual strand of magic tainted with darkness. It’s bright and pristine. Her magic is pure again.
"I would remember seeing these," Draco said with a bit of wonder, a tiny accusation. "They were not in your magazine cover."
"Authorised visitors. Hermione Jean Granger-Weasley, Ron Bilius Weasley-Granger, Rose Jean Granger-Weasley, Edward Remus Lupin, Andromeda Tonks, Victoire Weasley."
“I’d never wish to make you uncomfortable,” Draco starts, and finds his voice is raspy and low, eyes cast down on the surface of his untouched coffee. His fingers are shaking wildly. He clasps them under the table firmly and prays that his voice will come out even. “I... I did despicable things in my past, you have every right to hate me. I will do anything I can to...”
“Yes. You might want to leave after hearing what I have to say.”
, Draco thinks at first, but once he’s out of the house, he’s sure he’s doing it all wrong. It’s been too long since he went out casually like this. Draco’s met his friends over the years while Harry was in a coma, but usually at their place or during lunches at St Mungo’s as Draco was usually drowning in work.
Bill said he’d rather do several things, including climb into a Sphinx’s mouth, than do that kind of work. House magic was the realm of a specialised Curse-Breaker. Bill also put Malfoy’s name forward as his former apprentice. After Harry pressed Bill, he gave the name of several general Curse-Breakers, who came to Grimmauld, waved their wands around and then shrugged.
Harry wakes him up in the middle of the night, a hand shaking his shoulder so hard for a second Draco thinks he’s being attacked. It’s just Harry, though, with a clear disregard for Draco’s early start tomorrow.
Draco snorts, shaking his head. “You’ve never had a dog, Potter.”
Some are distant and formal. He’s glad he didn’t send any of those, although the overemotional missives he might have delivered in some intoxicated state are no better. Most of them, however, display a myriad of
“Were you planning on telling us?” Pansy asks.
Harry swung by the club the next day.
Harry is also getting better, according to Pansy. He started with a new physiotherapist right after he woke up, and has been exercising regularly. It helps him control the movements of his body better, she explained unnecessarily, but also his untamed magic.
The words were so immature, Draco took a second longer to compute them. By the time he understood what Harry was saying, Harry was already striding out of the room and hiding in Draco’s study. Another thing Draco hadn’t noticed until then was that Harry never sought refuge in his old painting studio. Instead, he’d rather be anywhere with Draco’s things close to him.
Coach slammed the offending edition of the
Harry leans over his body again, kissing him ever so softly, taking the fingers away. His lips are on Draco’s cheeks, his jaw, his neck. Draco can’t take it anymore. He doesn’t think he can keep living without
"The heart of this home is the joyful remembrance of those who left us." The gold was brighter when Draco cast the same charm in the library.
Draco didn't answer, but he had flushed slightly pink and looked pleased to be asked.
“Draco, you had taught me the courage to stay. Now I need you to be brave. You have a part of my soul,” Harry chuckles weakly, gesturing to Draco’s chest. “My heart will always be yours. I know yours has space to grow, and to love again.” Harry turns and looks at his other self, still obliviously staring at the window.
"Can I help you today?" Harry asked Draco the next morning.
Draco’s not even embarrassed that he sounds like he’s on the verge of tears. He probably is.
"Right," Draco said more to himself than Harry. He launched tentatively into something dreamy and beautiful. There were a few false notes, and a few times where he slowed down or repeated a passage while furrowing his brow until he picked up the melody again, the pages flipping for him.
Ron swung her around once again until they were facing Harry at the back door.
He inhales, breathing in the forest's magic humming; the scent of life, dewy and balmy after a recent death. The familiar energy, warm and comfortable, travels through his limbs, welcoming him back.
The rest of the lunch is quieter. Hermione tells him she’s teaching Harry some magic spells he never had the chance to learn, and that, despite his wilder-than-usual magic, he’s catching up fast—not that Draco would ever doubt Harry’s powers.
"A bit of a sibling rivalry then," Harry said.
"I see," Draco said. They both knew what he meant by company, and Harry knew he should pull back and behave.
. Draco wonders if he needs to redeem himself again—or if he ever did. He will apologise to Harry a thousand times, though, if it means he can have him back.
I loved how your brightness shone in my dark sky, reminding me there was a path, there was hope and happiness. “I like who you are.”
"Oh fuck you. I wondered, that’s all. I never—"
“You’re idiotic to go out wearing those fucking torn jeans. But again, Gryffindors are—”
Smiling, I looked back from where I had been staring at myself in the mirror. “Yeah?”
. He looks around, finally stepping back. “You’ve cleaned up the place nicely, I see.”
Once again, Harry found himself wrongfooted.
He drags his eyes from the circle, fixing his gaze on Marvin’s notebook cover. “I thought this group was full.”
Their apologies still ring in Draco’s ears when they lie on his small bed, naked bodies pressed close together. He still feels Harry’s guilt, when he’s working him open, when he’s pressing inside and Harry’s knuckles turn white gripping the sheets. And when Harry asks for more,
"I know this one! Andromeda sings it sometimes." Draco sang the next words. He wasn't good, but it was charming. Harry had never dreamed of Draco singing along to Fleetwood Mac. This was the worst idea Harry had ever had, and it was going to kill him. Harry turned away to hide his face, pretending to look for another record.
She stuck out her tongue. "Spoilsport."
He knows he’ll meet Mia, his favourite waitress. She’ll know his drink by heart. He might ask again if she is planning on growing her hair until it reaches the ground as she chides him for drinking too much coffee—not that it will get him to stop—before the dreaded encounter. This is how the day is supposed to happen.
"It’s a bit tricky. The magic in the figurines is linked to the playbook." Harry flipped to a clean page. "So, if I do this." Harry sketched out a very basic arrow formation with the Chasers at the centre flanked with two Beaters on each wing, flying in broad overlapping ovals to cover each player for both teams. "It will follow the notes." Each of the figurines obediently started to play a match.
He needs to get out of here. But he also needs to stay, to never take his eyes off Harry’s now fading grin again, and to touch him, and to embrace Harry in his arms and never let him go.
When he lifts his head and finds
Draco gave his hand a squeeze when it ended. The memories were a gift Draco had given him, he realised.
Draco’s brain supplies, but he shakes the thought away. It’s too late to be hopeful, and he’s tired of trying.
"When I was a little girl, I wanted to play for the Harpies," Pansy said, looking at Ginny. Ginny, in a rare show of modesty, blushed pink. "But I'm not a good flier."
They glance back at the haphazard state of their living room once it’s empty of people again, and take in the books precariously stacked on top of each other.
"Pardon," Draco corrected crossly. "I want you to say out loud, ‘please take away this portrait’"
. But he knows he won’t.
"The house will probably throw itself at your feet," Harry said. Draco made a neutral sound. "I wasn’t going to leave in the middle of this project. I’ll go by my place and pick up a few more things."
We kissed after that, pressed against a wall, vines curling up around our bodies, holding your hands neatly against it and far from me. It was easy if I was the one touching you, not the other way around, and you didn’t seem to mind it that much.
"No, thank you," Draco said politely. Harry finished the glass in a few gulps and wiped his mouth with the hem of his shirt in a show of manners so poor, Harry was waiting for Draco to say something.
"I didn’t mean it," Harry muttered when the library door reappeared as quickly and silently as it had gone.
He caught Pansy and Percy in the hallway coming back in, Pansy with her face tilted up to Percy, hand on his bearded cheek. He was rubbing her shoulder and murmuring in her ear something too low for Harry to catch. They looked so fond of each other Harry felt more embarrassed than if he caught them kissing.
Harry isn’t finished.
Draco would have thought someone like Harry—famous and harassed constantly—wouldn’t have to come to hospital, instead having his appointments at home. He knows for a fact that Pansy treats him at home. And he’s about to inquire about this, grabbing any chance he has to keep Harry there, when the man hastily excuses himself and bolts out of the room fast as lightning. The void Harry’s magic leaves thrums around him, and Draco has to breathe deeply and pretend not to notice it as it’s rapidly replaced by Elle’s.
"I've always liked magic," Draco answered.
"So, what? Am I supposed to take my house to civil court to sue it for damages?"
“I had pie,” he answers.
“Draco?” it calls, and it’s a voice he didn’t think he’d hear again and it makes his skin crawl, before the strangeness settles softly.
Pansy’s mask falls first. “Did you two talk?” She raises a brow, concern written on her face. He’s glad it’s not pity.
But Draco never stood as close to Harry as he’d been that night again.
“Do you think...” Draco starts, voice a little rasp. “Do you think it’s because of the tree that Harry’s like he is now?”
"Sometimes I despise you," Draco said. But he didn’t say it like he meant it at all.
“Want some coffee?”
Muck-raking rubbish, but proof that Harry had managed to keep his life away from the media so far.
She opened her mouth. I waited, but it was more out of displaced guilt than from a desire to hear what she’d have to say.
After Teddy had finally fallen asleep, he sat up with Andromeda for a bit, drinking tea. She was very interested in the house even though Harry hadn’t let on he was hoping to leave it to Teddy. It was hard to tell with Andromeda if she would take offense.
Harry’s movements are almost imperceptible, just a shadow moving in the room's dimness, as he lifts his hands and tugs Draco’s wrists, urging him to let go of his face. Draco doesn’t. Harry sighs again, turning his face to the side and kissing the palm of Draco’s right hand. He whispers into it, “Because I came back wrong.”
"I want to fuck you," Draco said.
mount--as the newborn colt found its wings and learned to fly. They grew together, both becoming taller and stronger, each praised and celebrated for their good breeding and superior talent.
And he likes it.
Also, I know I’m back early, so if you wanted another chapter, thank my parents for letting me use any screens at all (this is an iPad).
levi-o-
This summer was one of the worst yet. The Dursleys were already bad enough - he has at least three scars from June alone - but then they managed to intercept one of his letters from Draco. He doesn't want to remember it, but what happened after they did is permanently ingrained in his mind. He doesn't feel the fear and torment that he had that day right now, though. Memories can surface at the weirdest times for him. He silently thanks Merlin that he isn't about to break down in the middle of the corridor.
on my side).
From where he's sitting with Ron and Hermione, he gives me a little thumbs-up.
Later that night, when the meeting had adjourned, he started writing a letter to James.
"Harry," he says, blushing redder than the maroon trim on my robes, "will-"
Ginny smiled. "Okay! Thanks," she said, beaming from ear to ear.
Harry glanced around the room. "So, we're all in agreement, then?" He checked. Looking into each one of their faces, he made sure that each one of them nodded before continuing. "I'm going to go ahead and set some ground rules. During this game, there will be nothing illegal, nothing inappropriate, you can back out of anything that is past your limits, or makes you uncomfortable, and there will not be any forms of bullying or being rude. Also, what happens here stays here." He said that last sentence with a teasing smile, and then announced, "Let's start. I'll go first." He turned to Ron and smiled. "Truth or dare?"
There were so many rumors. Not just about him and Harry, but also about him alone. He heard them being passed around in the corridors when he was walking to class: that he was secretly a girl—because wasn't Harry straight?—that Harry was just using him to get someone's attention (and vice versa), that he was in other relationships as well and that he was just playing around with Harry's heart in order to break it, that he was adopted because his parents would never have a gay child, that they had somehow had a child (which was ridiculous; they were both boys). All lies. And it was annoying him out of his mind. He needed to get out.
"Sure," Ron replied.
Harry snorted with laughter. "You might do well to remember that
Draco yelped. "Hey!"
Oh, fuq. This is not going how I want it to.
smiled
Harry tried to sit down in the nearest chair. However, he was distracted by wondering how the heck Draco would want to be friends with him to aim, so he fell on the floor instead.
This was his thought process in the seconds after that encounter:
As Draco approaches the classroom in which Harry is already waiting, he can see Harry’s sharp outline through the door. Harry’s talking to Professor McGonagall about something, and he catches a few snippets of their conversation.
Draco says quietly, “It was you all along, wasn’t it? Those notes, the flower—it was all you.”
”And I’m honestly regretting that. Because I’ve been infatuated with you for over a year now. And it’s fine if you don’t like me; that’s what I’m expecting. But I just needed to get it out of my system.” He looks so broken, so... longing, that Draco can’t help but wonder where the boy on the train went. But he doesn’t mind this version of Harry either.
Sorry that it was such a short chapter. I promise that there will be plenty of nice, long chapters that are filled with non-canon ships in the future.
“I think it might be a letter from Draco…” Harry mumbled, embarrassed. He knew what Hermione would tell him, that Draco had been his enemy since their first year, that his parents were Death Eaters, that Draco was a
The next person Rita had preyed on: Draco.
Daily Prophet
I’m sitting here with Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy, and Pansy just said something that I’m never going to stop being surprised about.
"What about the Longbottoms? Their boy needs you too. And no one would ever guess that they'd use you, unlike if you were their Secret-Keeper," said Molly, looking at him in a patronizing way.
I was surprised when I caught Harry looking over at my table as I opened the note. He was blushing from the moment he saw the colour of the owl. Was it him? No, it couldn't be. He's the one who's always complaining about me, who follows me around and tells his friends that I'm plotting something.
As he came up to the library, Draco could see Harry’s tan, lean shape against the dark stone wall. His dark, curly, messy hair was falling in gentle waves over his forehead, and his hands were stuffed lazily in the pockets of his black khakis. He looked insanely handsome, even with the glasses that didn’t quite fit right. He always did, but today it was even more emphasised than usual.
Okay. I didn't mean to tell him that Pansy knew. I didn't mean to leave it out. I didn't mean for her to almost tell Granger, who would have told Weasel, that homophobic git.
A_Gay_Mess
He quickly threw on his robes and made his way down to the Great Hall. As he made his way over to where his friends were sitting, he glanced over at the Gryffindor table and caught Harry's eye. Harry looked startled for a second, then smiled at him, a warm smile that Draco quickly returned.
”Who will?” Draco asks, concerned. “Who are you afraid of? Who are you, Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived, so afraid of?”
Sorry for not posting in a while! I haven’t really been working on this story as much, bc writers block and the pressure of daily updates, even on short chapters.
For some reason, everyone, including Luna, laughed at this. "Harry is pretty oblivious, isn't he?" said Hermione. "I had to point out to him that Draco had been acting more friendly." After she shared this, she grinned.
, for god’s sake.
After watching the school for about six months, I knew that, yes, she was doing the best she could to stay as bright as the moon. She had never stopped reflecting the rest of us, never stopped showing us our best qualities. The moon is amazing, and it can do beautiful things.
I'm trying to figure out when the Sorcerer's (or Philosopher's) Stone event happened; sadly, I don't have the book, so I'm sorry if I get the timeline wrong.
a bit vain. He doesn't like to think about it, what he is, it just makes things more complicated for him when he's trying to figure out what to do.
Take the parentheses out of the name and then take the words/letters out too.
In the morning, when he woke up, he stretched, not knowing what had happened last night. However, when he stretched, he saw a letter fall off him, and he quickly jumped out of bed and picked it up. On the back, he saw his name. It was penned in black ink, but that wasn't what made it so special. Definitely not.
That thought is the only thing running through his head as he and Draco kiss.
A_Gay_Mess
he wondered as he walked over to her.
I'm getting fed up with the predictability of our DADA teachers. Our new teacher this year-Professor Lupin-seems really awesome, which, of course, means he's going to attack someone. At least, that's what the statistics say.
Harry tore open the letter, but quietly, so as not to wake the others. He then went out of the dorm and into the Gryffindor common room, where he found Hermione reading quietly in a chair.
Draco scowled at him. "No, but you were the one who said it second. That means that the blame's on you." Harry playfully flicked him on the shoulder.
When they had gotten to the library, without knowing it, Luna reached for Ginny's hand. "Thanks for being my friend," she whispered, blushing. They walked inside the library and returned Luna's books, and then they went over to the table in the back of the library where Harry, Draco, Ron, Pansy, and Hermione were sitting. They were chatting, and occasionally they would start laughing.
3) Ask him to go with me (or let him do it), and
"I'm going to go study," Hermione told them, and then lifted the Silencing charm under her breath. "Goodbye, Harry. Goodbye, Ron." After that, she stepped elegantly through the portrait hole and into the common room. "What's up with her?" Harry asked Ron under his breath. Ron shrugged, because he didn't know that he could talk again, went through the portrait hole and up to the dorms, and promptly fell asleep.
Ron smirked, and then commented, "Start small. She might not believe you if your dreams suddenly get really, really dark."
And yet, everything in the article could be true. They had hated each other for so long—well, Harry had hated Draco for so long—that it wasn't surprising that he almost believed the article. He didn’t know
, are you?" Ron's saying to Hermione, a nasty tone to his voice.
Another observation: Every time I’ve opened a letter from my “secret admirer”, Harry has been looking at me, and he turns red and looks away when I catch him.
" I had murmured, looking down at the first line of the note. "
(See the end of the chapter for
For some reason, there was a maroon lily sitting on my desk today in Charms. A gold string was tied around the stem, attaching a note to the flower. It said,
"I'm doing well. What about you?"
He was surprised to see that the owl had come back with a letter.
As Ron runs through the hallway, he looks up and sees a bulky, green-clad figure in front of him. Like, he’s about to crash into him-in front of him. The Slytherin’s eyes widen when he sees Ron frantically trying to slow down. He skids to a stop, but it’s too late: he’s rammed into Blaise Zabini, sending them both to the floor in a heap of arms, legs, and book bags.
Draco sighs, closes his eyes. “There’s too much history. You’re… I can’t—”
“I love you, Harry,” Draco whispers.
Draco can still turn this meeting around, he can still make this work. Especially if he stops
"I’ll take you wherever you’d like, Ted," Harry said.
that, but he can’t help stating the obvious as his hands come to cover his lips, trying to stifle a sob of relief.
He did prepare for the possibility that Harry could not want
He sighs. “Let’s increase your potions this week and see how your body responds. But you have to work out,” he says, his tone firmer and more serious now. “Physical exercise. And no, lifting your wand doesn’t count.”
Harry looked at him. Draco prodded the canvas hard, and, while Walburga Black protested, they couldn’t hear a word she said.
. It’s not possible and he can’t keep holding on to such hope.
Draco huffs a laugh, rolling his eyes, and proceeds to detail the important steps of the spell he’s just cast on her. He’s still half expecting some consequence or another to present itself, but nothing happens as he tells Elle about one of the branches of the Alder tree he’s got from Hogwarts and used to bind her magic to. The twig is lying by the potion flasks, gleaming faintly with reminiscent magic still transferring back to her. Elle takes it in her fingers delicately and hugs it to her chest, and her tears finally slide down her cheeks.
When the bill came, there was a round of polite arguing about who would cover what, but Miles elbowed them all out of the way and tossed a hefty bag of Galleons on the tray which promptly disappeared with a pleasant chime.
"What's wrong?" She asked this question like an accusation.
"I’ll see you around then," Harry said, after a moment.
"If you are queer and go to Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat will always consider Slytherin and maybe Hufflepuff. It’s just a fact! The evidence is in front of you!"
"I heard you had Malfoy working on the Black place in London," Neville hedged.
It’s the first room he shows him. And Harry loves it. He doesn’t say it at first, but it’s in his posture, in his glittering eyes, in his besotted grin as he enters every door, stares at every room, every corner of the house.
Maybe they can try again, maybe it’s not a limited time only situation or just the spur of the moment. Perhaps Harry wants this as much as Draco.
“You’re wonderful,” Harry says and drops the hand between them.
"Hold on, that’s my name." He handed her his flute.
It feels so right to be near Harry again. He wants to scream, to hold him tight, to never to let him go again. His magic urges him forward, and he wants to ask if Harry feels it too. The tingling under their skin, the warmth between them. It’s
He dropped by for some post-dinner time with Teddy. When he was younger, Harry read him bedtime stories, but at ten years old Teddy was the one telling him stories of his day.
"Did you forget something?" Andromeda asked, looking around at the counters and kitchen table. Draco bent to where Harry was sitting and kissed him chastely on the mouth. It must have lasted less than a few seconds but a tingling sensation swept up Harry’s neck. He cleared his throat.
"No. Thankfully, my mother's
Elle shrugs, not pressing the issue about Harry nor confirming his suspicions about her lack of interest in her own situation.
“You mean, that elf from…?”
Draco jabbed his wand to Harry’s throat, there was still, somehow, a glow to his eyes. Something about them that he couldn’t quite figure out, it was quite mesmerising.
He’s still shaking, and he’s still afraid of having done something irreparable, but this is why he’s here, anyway; to understand his mistakes, his fears, his boundaries.
something.”
Mrs Weasley shakes her head, patting him on the shoulder. “That’s not enough. I hear you’re going back to work soon. You need to be strong.”
"I can get one working no problem. It’s accuracy that’s the problem. Home, school, and work are fairly simple, but dealing with abstract concepts is trickier," Ron said. His neck was a bit red.
However, contrary to Draco’s initial considerations about his luck, he keeps stumbling into Harry in the corridors through the rest of the week. Harry always smiles at him, nodding briefly before disappearing. Draco doesn’t know what to make of it and is blessedly exempted from thinking about the whole situation, since it doesn’t—it
"As a friend. Cloaks has excellent security and privacy spells if you were going to pick a Wizarding establishment to canoodle in a hallway. For the team, I’m glad you decided to take the rest elsewhere."
Harry only shrugs. “Yes.”
He ought to stop separating them sometime, though. It’s Harry, one Harry, memories or no memories.
Harry looks at him, one eyebrow raised and a smirk on his lips, as if he’s sensing Draco’s nervousness. He only shakes his head and shifts on his feet.
Draco stopped, and Harry made a needy noise. "But that's not how I want you to come." Draco manoeuvred them both onto the floor and Vanished Harry's gym shorts. Then he sat Harry between his legs so his legs bracketed Harry’s, and Harry felt the hardness against his backside.
"I wouldn’t know," said Harry for the sake of conversation. "How did you get into magical houses anyway?"
Draco’s not surprised by these small mementos of their old life anymore. He knows they don’t come from recovered memories, like one day he’d hoped for, but most likely from their bond acting through them. They come and go, and Harry never seems to notice.
Draco has avoided thinking about Harry and their situation. But now that he's convinced that the way to go is severing their bond, he’s trying to resume his research.
"Another save! Falcons Keeper Oliver Wood has been pulling off miracles. Seriously beautiful flying here, Jim. Anyone facing Scotland this Worlds will have their work cut out for them. I can’t believe how this team has come together—"
Draco took a deep breath, nostrils flaring. “Just because you don’t remember, it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen!”
He casts his eyes upwards, and a different kind of cold settles in them, urging him to close his eyelids. He doesn’t. Draco wants to look because the pungent fear still lives inside him; maybe if he closes his eyes, he will be dead
“That’s bad for your health.”
“Draco…” Harry’s hand lifts slowly, making its way to Draco’s face. It hovers close to the skin, never touching. “When I touch you, what does the bond make you feel?”
“That’s not true,” Draco lets out instead of taking his words back. Now that the truth is out, he finds he can’t hide it anymore. His fear, his hopelessness. He averts his gaze, staring at the slithering drawings the fractured window created on the carpet. “Don’t you think I’d want this to work? I was alone for five years, trying to get you back here.”
"Maybe," Harry conceded. He thought of Draco's mouth curving into a smile when he couldn't help but show how pleased he was at being clever. He wasn't even thinking of sex.
Draco takes the note warily. The paper shivers at his touch and enlarges to reveal Harry’s sloppy handwriting.
Marvin receives him with a hug and a bright grin. His smile has the same softness it used to have, despite the crinkles shaping the corner of his lips. His eyes are hidden behind a thick pair of glasses and his hair is covered in a layer of fine grey strands. Draco is satisfied to notice a yellow notebook under his arm as he tries not to let the guilt of disappearing and not getting in touch for so long make way inside him.
At first, the renovations had gone fine. It was pleasant to go to the hardware shop and pick out little fixtures so he could have normal door handles instead of snakes. He replaced the terrifying black potbelly iron furnace and stove with neat little magical/Muggle hybrid appliances with digital displays.
“What?” Draco asks.
Draco points at the vacant chair. “May I sit?”
rolls for Teddy. Should I stop cooking then? Give everything over to Ron, hang up my apron, and twiddle my thumbs?" Molly asked. The speech would be much more effective if it wasn’t the tenth time Harry had heard it.
crying, but there are no tears anymore.
"Looks like as long as I touch them first, you should be fine," Harry said.
"If the birthday girl wants oysters and red wine with her cheese plate, we order oysters and red wine with her cheese plate," Blaise said. He turned and whispered something to Daphne, who threw her head back and laughed.
Harry slowly placed his hand on Draco’s neck.
And then Harry’s cheeks turn a tone redder as he averts his gaze. “Do you know where I got my tattoo? Nobody seems to know, and since we... You know... I gathered you might.”
In one headline, she was a popular example of too many women in Quidditch ruining the game. Another cited her as the issue with tiered tryout ranking eligibility and pondered whether there should be an age cutoff. Still another article claimed that the focus on increasing statistics was ruining Quidditch, which Harry agreed with, but not because Atty Blake wasn’t talented. Give her a few years, and she would be top of the league.
“Keep my eyes,” I repeated, even though I felt she had heard the first time.
, not enough time for too much damage, despite Pansy’s trepidations and the cold that’s now fully left his body.
This year’s offseason project began like all the others. During the finals, Harry thought of nothing but Quidditch until the Cup was in hand. His teammates sprayed him with ice cold champagne on the pitch. Oliver Wood kissed him full on the mouth at the Falcons private afterparty. The kiss was more out of gratitude than any romantic feeling since they were exes, although Oliver’s boyfriend Winston had looked properly annoyed, regardless. Harry didn’t get back to his hotel room until six am, veins buzzing with the sweetness of victory. He could do anything.
Draco’s wand stopped glowing, did he just hear what he thought he heard? Harry sounded breathless, almost as if. Well, almost as if he meant it.
The realisation doesn’t even hurt so much anymore. It’s just a dull ache reminding him of his new, unavoidable reality.
"Knut for your thoughts?"
Draco sighs heavily, cutting in with a shake of his head. “I know. But just. Not yet.” Whatever she means. Either to search for help, or to try to get out, or
"We’re not doing this. Please unpack this in your next therapy session and not while your come is still dripping out of my—"
There is only one exception. There’s an envelope that’s not strange to him, despite being in a pile of unknown names. Draco picks up and reads Teddy’s letter on his way to his first appointment, wondering how it got mixed up with his public mail and did not go directly to his home.
Laughing, Dean scooted back over to where he had been sitting before, looked at Pansy, who had been watching them with a faint smile of amusement on her face, and asked her, "Did you really think that I wouldn't do that?"
When Blaise let’s go of him and walks away with a smile, he’s blushing. Why is he blushing? Blaise is a
I finish his sentence. "I take you to the Yule Ball?" He nods, smiling. I laugh softly, and tell him, "You don't have to ask."
he mentally whined, trying to convince himself that it wasn’t true. He had gotten a letter from his parents, saying that they were very pleased with what they had been hearing about him, but was it really true that he was gay? He would have to tell them the truth eventually, or he was never going to achieve the happy relationship he wanted. If it meant anything, they had promised a long time ago that they would support him in decisions he made unless the decisions got him into legal trouble. Then he would be on his own. And, anyways, better now than never, right?
Btw I deleted the next chapter BC the story wasn't going the way I had originally planned
Okay, I’ve been rereading my diary entries and I don’t know how in the name of fucking Merlin I didn’t notice it before, but it’s obvious now: I am in love with Harry fucking Potter. The Boy Who fucking Lived.
Truths and Dares is officially finished! Thank you guys for sticking with me through the three week long periods where I didn’t like any of the ideas running through my head (*cough cough* chapter VII part I *cough cough*). One last reminder to take care of yourself, get good sleep, eat well, and excercise before I leave this story behind.
He tentatively leans into the kiss, and Draco’s mouth opens into his, and their tongues slide together, and it just feels so
Draco was the first to look up and see Ginny and Luna standing there. "Well, that's one thing we can cross off our to-do list."
" I turned to her and shrugged. "
Draco reaches up on impulse and grabs Harry’s hands. The day is a cold one, but his hands are warm under Harry’s fingers. “Harry, I promise you that, as long as I’m alive, nothing can hurt you. Not Voldemort, not the Dursleys, not Snape. Nothing.”
Guys, there will be Deamus fluff in this chapter.
He laughed, that high tenor laugh that makes me want to smile every time I hear it. Before I knew it, his arm was tightening around my shoulders, and he was bringing his other arm up and wrapping it around my waist as he pulled me closer. "Go ahead," he said softly, laughter still in his voice. "I don't mind."
, Harry thought, and then said to her, “Wow. I was expecting a different response. Where did that come from?”
Well, then. Let's go.
"They're coming. Hermione wouldn't miss this if someone promised to deliver the entire Hogwarts Library to her house, minus the Restricted Section, of course, and we all know that she'll bring Pansy along with her. As for Ron, I'm pretty sure he'll come to this. Dean and Seamus as well," Luna replied. "Also, could one of you lock the door?"
"I know. But it’s…it’s more symbolic if you return it to me this way. Isn’t it?" Harry asked. He hadn’t quite grasped all of Draco’s nattering on about magical theory, but there was something there, he could feel it. His intuition said he picked correctly. Draco gave him a curt nod.
“You can’t keep coming, Harry.”
"Fucking grow up," Harry said, taking a page from Draco's book. But he could tell he still sounded fond of Draco. He was so fond of him.
Harry’s eyes move to Draco’s hands, and he pauses for a moment, before tentatively sliding his own across the table. Draco catches himself staring at the long, brown fingers as if they’re alien to him. As if it’s not real, or if Draco hadn’t spent years mapping out every line on that hand, every scar.
, Celtic ancestry,” Draco tells her. “The ancient magic and rituals are still practiced to this day.”
"Looking good, Captain," Atty said with a big exaggerated wink.
"Well if I wanted to go with them, could I take a Portkey?" Teddy asked.
It’d been months before I’d left the flat after the whole post-war memorial business and the auror fiasco. Then another one or two before I started meeting other people — strangers on the street, essentially. That was when Luna and I found each other again. Somehow, between those weeks and me freaking out, she moved in. More two months in, and I was equipped to go to a party, hanging by a thread.
Harry fumbled it a few times before managing it. There was nothing visual to confirm, but Draco seemed to sense he was correct.
Mrs Weasley had promptly supplied them with a complete dinner table, once she found—from Granger, most likely—that they’d be gathering to research Harry’s curse.
They were only visible when Harry let them be. The magic in the stars pulsed at Draco's touch with a gorgeous warmth. They would be twinkling now.
Draco might have loved his mother, but didn't much like her from the sounds of it.
what he wants.
Despite his silence, Harry cards his fingers through Draco’s hair, showing he’s listening to their conversation. It makes him blush.
Draco is prepared for that, he reminds himself, trying to control the panic that grips his pulseless heart.
He doesn’t listen to this voice. He can’t. He
Potter’s cheeks redden and he shoves his hands under his thighs, but his eyes never cease to find Draco’s.
His own socks rest on the floor; Harry used to prise them off Draco’s feet and heat them with his own hands.
gets to live it.
"Having a small unofficial tradition like buying the drinks or carrying the team banner is part of how you prevent more serious stuff like hazing. You want them to bond with the team," Harry said. He was bent close to Draco’s ear.
. Sometimes I just want to lie down and never wake up. I’m just tired of fighting.”
“I like your hair,” your words were filled with desire, your short waves displayed a bluish glow.
It’s not okay, though. Things don’t get better, and there’s nothing Draco can do to keep him here, to keep him safe.
Harry is silent for a long time, before he sighs, closing the book without looking at the rest of the pictures. He pulls back a bit, inserting some more distance between them. “It’s weird knowing I lived through all of this. It feels like someone else’s life.” Harry’s voice is as strained as his magic feels now. Draco fights to keep the soft smile on his lips. “Did you imagine we’d be here someday? I mean, together, even if I don’t remember it,” he adds with a smirk that’s far too self-deprecating for Draco to appreciate.
“I cannot believe Healer Parkinson allowed this to happen,” she murmurs, raking a hand through her hair.
He does not regret his radical decisions, nor his new ideas, no matter how much he misses her.
Harry did think of sex then, of the long, lazy way Draco had jerked him off this morning when he woke up; his slow, pleased smile when Harry came.
Harry smiles at him, and Draco’s sure all is right in the world.
here as much as he’s always belonged by Draco’s side.
Draco barely realises he’s been leaning forward and has to pull back slightly to keep from touching Harry. He takes a deep breath, feeling the heat coming in from the bond. Harry feels so warm.
“I don’t see why not. It’s supposed to be simple. I’m in love with you and I’m pretty sure you love me too. You said so yourself. Were you lying?”
The heat of Harry’s fingers lifting the hem of his shirt up, pressing against his waist, makes memories flood into Draco’s mind. He shoves them away. He loves them, but he doesn’t need the past at this moment. Harry’s here now, Harry is touching him, kissing every inch of his reddened neck, pushing his shirt up with quivering hands.
Her voice is soft, as she caresses his hair with the tip of her fingers. “Draco, it worked. Your plan worked. And he’s awake now, baby. He might still get his memories back, and if he doesn’t…”
But, the articles about Atty Blake were another matter. There were subtle insinuations she had slept her way onto the team, because she had been a bit shaky in her first ever professional match. She was just a kid, barely nineteen. Harry fumed over it.
No sooner did he return than he saw he had grey brocade curtains. No tag this time. Harry couldn’t even guess where they had been stolen from, although they were clean and well-pressed.
“Oh, he’s here.”
Marvin doesn’t insist and doesn’t ask him again for the rest of the session. But he approaches Draco in the end, while they put away the chairs and the group chats excitedly over a pie someone’s brought.
“I am very much opposed,” Luna interjected, but she was giggling too much to be serious.
Harry rolled over after a few minutes to face Draco. Sweaty hair curled in his eyes. Draco might look the most appealing when he was this loose-limbed, sleepy, sated creature.
"To make you feel bad," Harry said. He knew now not all damage was done with a closed fist or a harsh word.
"Teddy can do anything he wants that comes with fewer concussions than Quidditch," Harry said.
"I don’t think it’ll affect anything in the game," Harry said.
The conversation shifts to something easy after they’re convinced Draco’s for real. He’s having fun with Harry’s friends, he realises, despite them being Muggle and Draco’s own reservations about meeting them before this. They’re a big part of Harry’s life now, and Draco wants them to like him. But they’re nice to him, and fun, and clearly care for Harry as much as Harry seems to care for them.
Harry hadn't realised he had expected Draco to scar until now. But sometimes, it seemed like his whole life until adulthood had been a dream. The past was distant, unreal. It felt like there should be physical evidence of every transgression he ever made, that every good deed and bad deed should be on a ledger, plain to see.
"What if something malevolent got in?" Harry asked.
"Are we talking about exes? Is this a first date activity?"
"Again, my sincere apologies for my overreaction. I think I should go. I will find a way to work on the rest in your absence," Draco said.
"The mini-Curse-Breaker kit is educational," Harry insisted when he caught Hermione frowning at one of Rosie's ten gifts.
"You weren't there in eighth year, and also, you wouldn't have attended if you were invited," Neville said. Neville was, of course, right. The spiralling Harry had been doing on his own took precedence. And Ron and Hermione hadn’t been together then so Harry wasn’t surprised neither of them had brought it up.
"Not believed to be. She is. She definitely is."
"You all seem pretty close," Harry said. He was fishing for information, but his friends seemed like a happy part of his life. Draco kissed Harry sweetly at the top of his street instead of answering before walking off to the Apparition Point. Harry watched him go.
Draco rolled his eyes, but stood up. Somehow, he managed to make himself taller and hunched.
Harry wrote back:
Draco’s nostrils flare, his fingers dig into the couch’s cushioning. “Don’t even say that, don’t
Harry had been so frazzled by Draco Malfoy in his bed this morning, he forgot to be fazed by last night. They had
“Healer Malfoy,” Draco hears, but he doesn’t turn back to Healer Cameron, despite her warning tone. “What are you doing?”
Harry froze. Draco waited a few moments, his full weight still on top of Harry like they had been doing something other than sorting through the Black family antiques.
Depression wouldn’t explain his mind failing him, his blackouts, the way his magic is sometimes unresponsive, him forgetting simple things about his life or the shadows he sees from the corner of his eyes. That’s why Harry came back to London. Not to find a cure, despite his declarations about Granger and Weasley’s help in trying to fix him, but to fucking be near them if nothing works out.
back to Draco.
Draco tilted his head. Harry felt as if even in black stocking feet, idly munching on his toast, Draco could see right through him.
"Is that Edward Lupin?" Oliver called from the far bike. "Merlin, you’re getting tall. Hogwarts next year, right?" Teddy nodded. "I remember when you were a wee little thing. Hope you’re treating your Nan well."
Draco considers asking why Harry avoids using umbrella charms, but he wants to see Harry’s hair stick to his skin, the shirt he wears turn transparent. He nods.
"Are you implying that I do?"
And then, Harry is pulling away suddenly as a crowd of young students run past them, almost stumbling into their bodies, shouting excitedly.
Draco stays awake most of the night. It’s in those moments of quiet gloom that he surrenders and gets lost in himself, in his own grief. It’s better than the nightmares, though. When he finally sleeps, their bodies intertwined in a mass of limbs and heat and sorrow, the sun is blazing through the window and the early birds chirp softly in the street.
Draco goes back home with a strange feeling of fulfillment nestling in his chest and is happy enough to fall into Harry’s arms and stay there for the rest of the night.
"Let’s test it. Red or white?" Harry asked.
Draco’s relationship with Pansy and Hermione had suffered a toll after his lies and deceit. He understands where he’s wronged them, but he regrets nothing he’s done. He’d do it all over again. They never prevent him from meeting their daughters, but he only hopes their friendship will get better with time and that they’ll forgive him fully one day.
"Draco," Harry said.
"Could we just keep swapping Life Debts forever? Theoretically?" Harry asked.
He told her the whole disagreement, and her face went tight with sympathy.
Draco rolls his eyes and floats two plates to the table. “That’s not what I’m talking about.”
"I can take him for dinner," Harry offered. Her face softened.
“It’s been happening since I woke up from the coma. At first I thought I was just... I don’t know what I thought.” He releases a self-deprecating chuckle that Draco wants to smother. “I hear things. But it’s not... not voices or anything. I just. You know how you said you feel my magic or Luna always says she can see people’s auras?”
"Oh, he’s long gone. Said something about some special cactus blooming at midnight," Seamus said. Harry snorted. It wasn’t that serious. But speaking of Malfoy, Seamus had their house fixed by Draco, hadn’t he?
Harry will love it as much as he did the first time the realtor showed him.
He rises minutely from his chair. He can make it to the door; he’s always been fast. Except that Potter has taken the spot closest to the exit. And then Marvin’s thundering voice resounds in the space and he’s forced to sit back again, unable to think of a single excuse to leave early.
"What is this?" Draco asked, looking at the doorway of Harry’s room.
? Isn't it exhausting to always think of yourself as a symbol instead of a person?"
"Ah, so the extended blowjob scene in His Minister’s Secret between the spy and his nemesis is meant to be thrilling but not sexy," Draco teased.
Draco’s not offended by his words. There’s no bite to them, only hurt. And they’re not exactly lies. He’s always wondered why Harry chose
"You’re Harry Potter. Wear what you’re wearing now."
"This all makes sense now. You must have driven Blaise up the wall."
"Fine, be like that. How's the house coming?" Ron asked, waggling his eyebrows.
The imagination of a novelist, the substance of wet tissue.
Pansy tilted her head, tapping her finger on her bottom lip. She squinted a little.
The tears have been choked in his throat since Elle’s last words, and they now drown him in their perpetual flood. Draco tries to breathe through his swollen throat, through the tears, through his loud cries.
"I’m being harassed for my personal beliefs," Ron lamented.
Draco doesn’t ask Hermione how she knows he’s there when he opens the door, just stares at her bright, wide eyes and fatigued frown.
"It's adult talk," Draco had said, and Teddy pouted, but they didn't let him in on what they had talked about.
The conversation seems to get the attention of Blaise, who turns to them and joins in with a grave tone and a smirk playing on his lips. “Most pure-blood families have a Tree of Life in their property. It’s not just a garnish, it’s real.” He waits for his words to sink in. Granger stares at him with an eyebrow raised. “It connects the magic of all of those who lived on those grounds, it empowers them. It’s why it’s so important that pure-bloods remain living in the main house, and their offspring and so on. It’s honestly an inane rule, but it grants the descendants of the house magic many benefits.”
Does that matter?
Guys, I am so sorry for forgetting to post this before I posted February. Plz read this and, if you've already read February, re-read February to get the story straightened out in your heads.
”I—I can’t,” he mutters, engaging the bleachers in a staring contest so as to avoid Draco’s eyes. “It’s too dangerous for me. I can’t show it, or—or they’ll find out.”
"Please don't start on that," Harry groaned, putting his head in his hands. "I already have to deal with that from the first years, which is bad enough. When people from other years start doing it as well, it gets really annoying."
. Kreacher says Harry asked to stay with Hermione and Pansy, but he’d assumed that much.
Harry frowns, his mind working behind the windows of his eyes. “I was mad once. A lot. Few weeks ago. That wasn’t me.”
Harry made a neutral noise. He could still feel Draco's steady gaze on him. No surprise there, as he'd spent all of school watching him and being watched; he was well familiar with the feeling. Harry went back to diligently scooping his magic into walls.
Draco’s shoulders are tense. His magic is pouring out of his body, even after the spell has been terminated. It’s powerful magic, and there’s something about using his deep Celtic roots that leaves his body vibrating with energy. That’d happened when he cast the bond between him and Harry as well, though at the time, Draco had assumed it was the soul bond working its way inside him.
"What else do you want to know?"
, Draco thinks. He survived. It had not been exactly living, an existence devoid of light. But he’s breathing, and he’s moving, and that should be enough.
"We’re already late," Draco said. "Wear the dark grey loafers. The blue ones will make you look like a matchy twat."
Draco nods, not trusting himself with the rebuttal almost slipping out of his mouth. He Summons a towel, draping it around Harry’s head, before noticing what he’s doing. Harry eyes him with his head tipped, but says nothing when Draco backs away quickly. “To dry yourself,” he mutters, leading Harry to the living room where he had played for him a few weeks earlier. “I’ll prepare the guest room and let Hermione know you’re safe.”
You turned to the side, the corner of your lips turning up slowly, head coming to rest on my chest. “I thought a lot about it over the years. Therapy helped, you should try it.” You sounded confident, when you stated, “This is who I want to be. This is me.”
"Remember the thing about my house?" Harry asked. "I need another favour. Are you still friends with Malfoy?"
, and this day will be all but a dream. A distant memory.
Bur Draco doesn’t get to see Harry’s place until almost three months later, when Harry announces he has to start unpacking the boxes he's stored there since he came back from his trips, almost seven months before.
Harry smiled at Draco, and Draco finally found the secret Harry carried in his eyes.
"That means you’re doing a good job," Draco said smoothly, and Hermione threw her head back and laughed.
It’s on a stroll down a Muggle Park one day that they decide it’s time to fill the house with more life, when the girls squeal happily at a cat that crosses their way. Ava and Emma accompany Harry and Draco to the animal shelter, and when Harry and his nieces fall in love with a yellow furred dog with a dark snout, Draco only raises an eyebrow at him.
. He trusts Pansy’s skills as a Healer, but he can’t help letting the relief soak into him.
“What’s all that?” Harry asks, sitting by his side on the small but comfortable couch Draco had made him buy when he moved in. He shoves a cup of coffee in Draco’s hand, and Draco directs a thankful grin at him.
"It wasn't about the war. Not really. We both thought it was but it was more about..."
Draco huffs a sad laugh, and the fact that this Harry still hates the press does little to diminish his pain.
"It is not fine. You will report to St Mungo’s and have that checked out," Harry said. He was giving Draco the full experience of Falcons Captain Potter dealing with under-reported or neglected injuries from his teammates.
He sighs, wearily eying the assembly on top of the table he’s ignored while Mrs Weasley was there. He repositions it in the center of the room and pours himself another glass of the abandoned wine he finds in one of the empty cupboards. It’s just tasteless now.
"No, of course not," Harry said, acutely aware Neville had clocked him as being too interested.
"Surely there's a way to gain influence without showing everyone my—" Harry made a gesture at his body, though he was fully clothed in his favourite Nike sweatshirt. Good thing too, since her office walls were glass and facing all of Diagon.
Autumn bled into winter without a break. The Falcons were still ranked number one in the League. There was no disputing that, even though every win meant more bad press and losing changed nothing. They were no longer a team that had made an impressive come-back or the underdog adapting to a new style of play. The Falcons were the team to beat and the coverage was almost universally nasty.
echoes across the wall, and Draco tries to ignore Kreacher's flippant reply about his efforts in trying to get Draco to eat, while at the same time caring for his other master.
"Do we have to?" someone grumbled from the back.
The first time he gets a note from Harry is five months after they had moved in together. It’s a little yellow square—Harry called it
But it’ll hurt. And it’ll burn. And it’ll be suffocating. The trading of a prison made of his own thoughts for one of flames.
The grey stray that always follows them sleeps calmly between their legs and doesn’t even stir when Potter slides his notebook towards Draco.
He drags himself from the stool in the kitchen, limbs still too heavy from sleep—mornings are the hardest part of the day—and opens the window. The owl flies in and lands smoothly on his table. It doesn’t move to leave when Draco takes the envelope from its beak.
? Where is the frosting?" Draco, despite his protests, sliced himself a generous portion.
it. But even he knows this might be impossible. And Harry is here, now, interacting with him of his own volition.
Once is killing him already.
He thought everything would be okay when he found Harry trapped in Limbo and brought him back. But nothing’s okay. He should be happy he’s awake now, and he has a chance to live again. Yet, he can’t shake the feeling of loss settling in his chest and wonders if that’s how Harry felt throughout all of those years. Is that his curse? Being forever lost and alone?
"If Atty hadn’t given him one, I was going to," Stella said. "Let it go."
Harry shrugs again, and Draco fights the urge to shake some sense into him by force.
"And how long have you lived in it?"
"Do you say every single thing that pops in your head?" Harry asked, amused.
This guilt isn’t something Draco can take away from Harry, though he wishes to. He doesn’t find much resistance, though. Harry nods in silence, seeming less worried about it as the old Harry had been. Harry leans in and mouths at Draco’s scars, lips wilfully tracing each line. A shiver runs down his spine, and he whines helplessly at each of Harry’s caresses.
actually there—”
Draco’s been relying so heavily and for so long on the certainty that... Well, he isn't exactly certain. It’s hard picturing his hopes now as they seem to make even less sense than his actual life.
him. It’s Harry again. It’s Harry,
Harry doesn’t hesitate again. “Yes. Yes.” He kneels down, arms around Draco’s shoulders and head shoved against his neck.
The wrought-iron gates to Malfoy Manor hang limp and half bent like the dilapidated structure of the house. Vines make their way around to the pickets, the small leaves rounding up the pointy rail heads.
Adrian was trying to talk Daphne into hosting an afterparty of some kind.
“Yes.”
"Your average catch time has gone up," the man spat nastily, like Harry owed him something. Harry didn't respond.
The moon’s dazzling light radiates through the magnificent windows, hitting everything Draco’s left forgotten and hidden inside this place.
Draco rolls his eyes, but can’t help the grin on his lips. “Fine.”
“Don’t say it,” Draco interrupts, and he can’t recognise the sound of his own voice, so alien, guttural and charged it feels.
"You know what to do," Harry assured him. Oliver gave him a hug only for Coach to call out, "Very touching. If the wireless drama is over, how about running some drills?"
“You never asked.”
Harry's face heated with shame, hot and unfamiliar. So Draco had still been in the house when he'd called Hermione those months ago.
"I’m not interrogating you. No need to tell me your life story," Draco said. He was doggedly emptying little drawers in an armoire with a dozen of them, and more and more hidden with magic. All so far were empty.
You dropped your hand and remained just standing in front of me in silence for a few moments. I took it between my fingers, pressing them against my digits, head resting on your shoulder. Only then, your fingers came to touch me, intertwining themselves in the hair at the nape of my head, and I let you. Your presence was quiet and calming. It tasted much like recharging, instead of exhausting.
“Look at me, Draco,” Harry commands. Draco cannot not obey and Harry’s fingers are on his jaw, softly turning his head to him. “You’re terrified of this because it’s different from what you had before. This is different, but it doesn’t mean it’s bad. You can’t even bring yourself to try. Don’t you see? I want you.” Harry’s pleading makes something searing hot flutter in Draco’s stomach.
There was something still cautious about the way Draco dealt with Harry. Harry felt unsettled because it was like they had stirred up the dregs of their history, when he meant to leave it alone. He didn’t care. Or at least, he didn’t want to care enough to re-litigate something he thought he had let go. His Mind Healer said that Harry wasn’t responsible for other people or all the social ills of the world.
"Strike!" Louder this time.
—love, a family, Harry—only to lose it all. It’s not fair that he has to live  this shitty life, while Harry can so easily move on and pretend nothing happened, because, well... For him, nothing happened. Harry can go out and meet people without a broken heart to weigh his decisions.
"It reminds me of the Geriatrics ward at St Mungo’s," Ron observed.
“I know. You shouldn’t be smoking either, then.”
"From the team? No. Outside of that? I don’t think it’ll be a problem," Harry said. He had walked this line before, and in any case, they banned the media from their hotels. No one worth paying mind would print anything worth repeating without evidence, and Harry had become an expert in not leaving evidence of his personal life.
Coach flicked his wand at the wall, and they all watched a player simultaneously propel himself upward and push his broom downward in one fluid motion. They all groaned. Harry was working on something similar, and even he let out an exasperated sigh.
The anger over petty disagreements had been brewing in them since before Harry moved in. When Draco argued over the way the furniture was arranged and the pictures on the walls—
, Draco’s mind urges him to say. He doesn’t. Instead, he dries and puts the cup in the cupboard and remembers their last day with a pang in his chest. “We had a fight, you know, your last day…” Draco murmurs. “I never forgave myself for the last things I said to you.”
"That’s just the way magical houses are sometimes. I dunno. Mum and Dad said the Burrow put in an additional room before they even knew they were having Ginny."
"If I come to your match, what am I coming as? Your boyfriend or a friend?" Draco asked.
Draco to show, as if it didn’t bother him in the least. None of that seems important in front of the fact that Harry is talking to him.
"I just said—"
We did hug when we parted this time, with promises of “smaller lunches next time”, “just us”, “keep in touch” and a “we’ll wait for when you’re ready” silent vow.
Daphne talked at length about her summer vacation plans with no prompting, while everyone looked on indulgently and shouted questions at appropriate intervals. When Harry's eyes met Draco's again, he looked happy with all the bickering, accusations, and complaints about Theo's taste in wine.
“I don’t know, I don’t care.”
"Really?" Harry was surprised he would compare this to his childhood home.
He wants to make sure Harry is real, and palpable. How would he react if Draco touched him? How would their magic respond to it now that they’re bonded?
It’s become a sort of ritual for them to greet each other like this since Draco’s meltdown on the first day. He promised he would never subject himself to that kind of humiliation again, with tears wetting his cheeks and a burning heart. But after that he came back again and again, decisively less arrogant about it.
“I’ll always be with you, Draco. You’ve saved me. Again and again. And I love you. But I know you don’t love me anymore.”
They had needed that time apart. But Draco almost can’t contain the hope in him when he sees Harry standing at the door, staring at him with uncertainty in his eyes. He needs to touch him, to kiss him whole, to make sure Harry is really there. He doesn’t, not yet.
Harry nodded.
It became somewhat normal for me to meet you at the coffee shop during the weeks, and it seemed we both enjoyed our talks. I did everything I could to get a glimpse of your grin, and it was hard sometimes.
But then Harry’s smiling again and he nods and says yes, and the world spins around Draco as his mind screams and screams
“Oh, if it were me I wouldn’t let you off the hook so easily,” Harry teases, shooting him a sideways glance. “I’m actually a bit surprised you befriended Muggles.”
"Gran, I’m going to be a Ravenclaw. It’s the most fair," Teddy announced as she came through the door.
"No, it’s where you do flips and tricks on the ground," Harry tried. Coach dismissed this comparison with a hand wave.
“I do,” Blaise agrees easily, a hand on his chest. “And as far as I’m aware, you, missy, don’t live with your parents anymore either.”
Draco shakes his head and forces the thoughts to dissolve into the background of his mind. He’s exhausted, has been working long hours without rest to make sure everything would be perfect with Elle’s ritual. He’ll think clearer once he’s had a glass of wine, a meal, and a good night’s rest.
We met only once more at PRTND. Luna lent me one of her dresses and, apart from changing my face, did little in terms of hair. It felt good. Not entirely comfortable, but just being able to wear anything I wanted, not worrying about what anyone would think. It was easier with a stranger’s face instead of mine, but it was a
“Aren’t we all, Potter?”
"That sounds like an awful lot of reading, so I’ll leave you to it," Harry joked.
This is not their first quarrel about it. And Draco hopes it won’t be the last, as he grabs whatever Harry can give him right now.
It’s better than the method Harry’s using to kill him, he thinks. At least drinking coffee doesn’t hurt as much.
“Yes, I think. Kreacher cooks for me when I’m here.”
"Feel. Try to break this," Draco said.
"One charity you're fond of is SafeHome, which provides housing for LGBTQ+ youth, Muggle and Wizarding alike. Why did you choose them to sponsor with your cover story?"
and the other Alder tree branch from my office. And the rest of you, if you can’t help, get the fuck out.”
"You always look good," Harry said. He let Draco unclasp the necklace and settle it back. Draco picked up a plain ring with wave patterns on it and handed it to Harry.
The prospect of having one answer is exhilarating, Draco understands that, but still it doesn’t fix Harry’s problem.
Harry had forgotten to put his broom back on the rack, so he grabbed it and went to the empty broom closet. All Harry caught was a glimpse. Atty was on top of Luc. They were kissing naked to the waist. Harry backed up and closed the door, rubbing his hand over his face. He had not expected to see
to watch. The sounds coming from the telly act as background noise during their idle chat. At one point, Harry asks Draco to play the violin for him again. Draco does so, chest puffed with pride, and Harry applauds him when the song is finished. They cook lunch together—chicken marinara—and decide to order Chinese for dinner.
Draco turned back towards him and whispered too. "Why would I be angry with you?" He looked puzzled even as he let one leg fall between Harry's like he was trying to get closer. Harry dragged one hand across Draco's hip and circled his thumb just under his shirt, a pretty material that shimmered when it moved even in the low light. The skin underneath it was hot.
“Can I hold your hand?”
Draco should have said it wasn’t Harry’s fault, none of it was. That they could take the photo down, take new photos, ones that represented what they were at that moment. Instead, when the anger boiled inside him, he said, “It’s
"It was about the war in that they could have saved us some trouble and thrown us all in Azkaban." Her tone was light and dismissive.
"Draco?" Harry stepped forward. "I’m glad you came."
Draco pauses, remembering the multitude of books about binding magic he’s read, trying to come up with a way to translate the technical terms into something Elle will understand. He remembers feeling warm when he had cast the bond on him and Harry, but it had meant the magic was working and Elle’s bonding would function the opposite way. Draco says, “Like cold water washing over your body.”
Whenever Harry’s… just not there, eyes glassy and distant, posture stiff, frozen in space, and Draco finds there’s nothing he can do to bring him back, he whispers, “Harry Potter, twenty-three years old, married to Draco Malfoy, best friend to Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley, owner of Ruby, art student, I love you,” and repeats it endlessly, until Harry can say it by himself.
Harry nods. “Yes. He still lives at Grimmauld Place, but answers when I call.” At Draco’s pointed glance, he continues vaguely, “I don’t like it there.”
Draco walks Harry through stretching him open. His words are whispered in the dimness, the voice carried by the almost tangible tension in the room. Harry is earnest in his task, his touch so gentle he thinks Harry’s afraid Draco might break.
"Mate, he's terrible at flying," Ron said. He was wearing his usual jeans and a t-shirt. Harry had half expected him to show up in a Cannons kit to ward off the evil aura of a successful team.
But Potter doesn’t see that.
“We are!” Draco says in a rush, leaning over the table, eyes wet with tears. “We
"It was kind of nice. My kids don’t care about Quidditch, you know? They just want to know if we can go bike riding and out for ice cream every night." Min-woo was smiling a little at the memory. "How about you?"
"Harry! You came." They both hugged him, and Padma kissed him on the cheek.
"Oh dear, that’s all we have time for. Thanks so much. Written statements are available for remaining questions," Pansy said, cutting in.
It’s the first time Harry says it since Draco’s candid confession in the pub.
"I've always known I was…" Draco gestured broadly. "But I figured I would sign a nice contract with a pure-blood woman. We'd have one kid. Then I would be free to do what I wanted as long as I was discreet. And Daniel was…unexpected really."
She was so comfortable and happy these days, it was hard to begrudge her anything. She had broken his heart once, and he still felt that sometimes, when he caught a glimpse of her as he remembered her best. But she had freed them both for a different kind of contentment, and Harry could appreciate that now.
He could use a cigarette right now, but when his fingers grope his pockets, he finds none. Oh, right, Draco doesn’t smoke anymore. But is it still breaking a promise if the one he'd promised doesn't remember it?
"Gluten-free," almost everyone in earshot corrected, at once.
, Draco tells himself, but he doesn’t stop.
"Blaise, please," Harry pleaded. He felt as though he was going to go mad in that house. Blaise looked around the room and, satisfied that it was empty, leaned forward in his chair.
He had his own memories from before Barb and Pansy had decided letting him see his own name in print was not helping his post-War mental health.
it, as much as Elle does.
“Thank you.”
“Granger.”
"Evidently not," Draco said with a curl of his lip.
The first of many insinuations that Harry somehow enjoyed being called names, or that being with Oliver was an easy choice, instead of one he made before he realised the full extent of how it would change his life to be that publicly out.
"I'll take you home," Blaise said. He got her coat from the couch, and she let him put it on.
It’s not desire moving him now. It’s starvation—but not for food. He’s hungry for something he can’t have: more information about Harry, Harry himself, love. Soup is what he’s got now, though. Draco silently grabs one bowl and starts eating.
Draco cups Harry’s face, forcing Harry's eyes on him again. The vague green almost doesn't resemble the eyes Draco has worshipped for his entire life. “You’re worth everything, Harry Potter. You’re my life, and I can’t go on living knowing you’re trapped like this.”
“You alright, Harry?” Ginny asked, at some point, when she found me hidden in a dark corner, away from the noise, and Molly and her insistence on my eating habits. I couldn’t eat suffering like that. I just
Harry was loath to shift the balance of anything under these circumstances, but that Tuesday, with the July light slanting over both of them in the new parlour, Harry cleared his throat.
Now that Draco had resolved some key issues with the house, and they had a formal work plan, Harry figured the rest should be a piece of cake.
He was more aware than ever that something had shifted between them. Draco came in work robes today, black and serviceable. His hair was flat. There wasn't so much an interesting pattern on his dress shoes, plain black leather, neatly placed by his front door.
And Harry doesn’t like him that much.
Harry interrupts him again. “I can’t believe I’m the one begging for you to take me.”
On the first anniversary of Elle’s death, Draco is alone at home.
It was Friday evening before something more interesting happened. Draco was unhappy with what his scans were picking up, glowing orange, and had sent Harry to look at moth-eaten fur coats. His back was turned to Draco when the flash of light came.
"I’ve never seen your flat either," Draco pointed out.
reporter asked, "Do you have any comments for the Diagon Alley Business Improvement District on your agent's shopfront?" and he answered, "Mate, I play Quidditch."
, Draco wants to say, but he only grins instead, after swallowing a mouthful of soup.
, something
We shared a bed, a wall of cats nestle separating our bodies. Her body radiated comfortable warmth beside me, and it was enough for the sleepiness to settle inside my mind and take me far.
“Draco,” Harry calls weakly. Draco can’t bring himself to look back and Harry huffs. “You can’t even look at me in the eyes, Malfoy.”
"Of course not. Orgies. Textbooks. Cauldrons. Sex with Draco Malfoy. Ordinary school year. They should put it in the Hogwarts brochures for parents of prospective students. Why doesn't anyone invite me to orgies?"
"It’s tradition!" Stella insisted.
Harry half-hoped that Draco wasn’t still at his house, but he was.
He looked good. Very good. He had perfected the effortlessly tousled hair that many a stylist tried and failed to give Harry. He wore a pair of indecently tight brown tweed trousers, a billowing white shirt, scuffed brogues, and a hunter green cardigan. Harry had never quite got an eye for whether non-robe clothing was magic or Muggle, especially now Muggle clothes were in fashion.
Harry distantly heard the announcements and did the post-game handshake. Then, as he stepped into the locker room, the ground tilted, and he heard Oliver distantly call "Harry!", then nothing.
"No, it’s perfect," Harry said. He swallowed hard and they moved on.
The voices from Harry’s show—he ought to stop calling it that now—act as comfort against his recently found hate for light, people, noises, life, anything at all that exists and breathes. He wants to roll inside his covers and lay there until the earth swallows him whole, until it erases every trace of his existence and no one remembers him anymore.
“Me too.” It surprises Draco how rough and weak his voice sounds.
“Why didn’t I know this?”
Draco doesn’t contain the smile taking over his own expression, and nods. “You might sense some discomfort, due to how long you’ve been paralysed. Your new diet,” he motions to the new assembly of colourful potions by her bedside, “will help you regain muscle strength and make sure your magical core is settled properly back inside you.”
"Thank you," Harry said.
Another deep breath. The words tumble out of his lips. “I formed a bond between us. It’s my soul that’s keeping you here.”
Harry smiles softly. “I know. I’m here now.”
"…Leo," Draco said. "Interesting. And you intend to pass this to Teddy?"
Harry shakes his head, and amends, “I am sorry you’re hurting.”
“Can we tell the difference? What are my feelings and what are yours?”
"What the
Harry’s voice is barely a whisper as he retracts his hand. His silhouette is poorly defined by the light coming out the curtain-less window of their room. “I need to tell you something.”
"If I wanted ritual humiliation, I would sign for one of the Swiss teams," Harry murmured.
"I appreciated it. My apology wouldn't have been very good then. I hadn't fully understood what I was sorry for. In any case, you treated me neutrally, so the other players and staff took your lead."
“That’ll shut you up.”
There were little notes over time in different ink. ‘No watercress in Petunia’s sandwiches’ and ‘Make June’s apple cake for Lily and Todd’s birthdays’ and ‘Peaches for Aunt Willa’. The notes read chronologically, though there were no dates. Harry was near the end when he spotted a wobbly note that said, ‘Vernon - likes salt’, then a few pages later, ‘James - ask Lily if he wants spicy food?’
“I don’t know. Something. Someone. Me.”
"How are your parents?" Arthur asked. He meant it kindly, but Harry saw her spine stiffen.
But Harry shakes his head. He takes Draco’s hand, kisses his palm, before placing it back on Draco’s lap.
“Potter, listen to me,” Pansy’s tone is soothing as she lifts Harry’s head with her forearm. Her features, steely minutes ago, have gone soft around the edges. “This potion will stimulate your body to start responding. It’s not enough, but it will help you for now. I can’t imagine how you must be feeling, but I promise you that I’ll do everything in my power to help you recover thoroughly, if you let me.”
"First I eat. Then I stretch. Then sometimes I have company over. Sleep."
Harry went flying first. He could skip a few days here and there, but he reserved that for when he was ill or the weather was awful. He would lose the precision in his seat if he didn't get on a broom every day. It was nothing to grab his two-way Portkey to the Hyde Park regulation pitch once he'd put on his training gear.
Harry pulls away again, green eyes blinking at him. His grin is blinding. It shines in the dimness of their room. He leans over Draco, and when their lips brush, the bond thrums under their skin.
Draco’s a bit startled to come back to Harry’s laughter, as he looks at the board Draco has hanging on the only wall clear of shelves or piles of books .
A hand rests on his shoulder, and Draco turns to the side to meet Marvin’s broad smile. “I’m glad you’re back,” the man says. Draco will come back every week, though, and his therapist knows this.
"You should have brought Pansy. We could have had a nice time," Blaise said to Harry. He was transparent in baiting Draco for a reaction. But it was Daphne who chimed in.
“Not really,” Luna hums, lips twitching, and shakes her head.
Harry ignores his assessment as if it’s of no concern to him. “Is it reversible?”
They went to Harry’s first to fly, because it was a nice Sunday with the weather warming back up. The inside was nothing special; Harry had told an interior designer places he’d liked ten years ago and ended up with a curated cross between the Gryffindor Common Room and the Burrow. His trophies were all here: League pennants, plaques and winners medals. His first League broom was encased in glass. But Harry was already thinking about putting them in Grimmauld. He wouldn’t sell the Falmouth place yet, of course. But all of this didn’t feel much like him.
Harry’s eyes glint for a second. “Your mother.”
. How else were you to take over the family business? It’s common practice, all the old families do it on a child’s first birthday. It’s something to be proud of! You are
Harry
The hardest room to refurbish is their suite. Harry paints the walls repeatedly, never satisfied with a colour. In the end, they realise it’s not the colours that are wrong, but the room. They move their things to the other guest room available.
, this is a
"I spoke to the house, of course," Draco said. He talked so fast.
Draco snorts, but doesn’t avert his attention from his rapidly disappearing soup. “Well, yeah. You try waking your husband from a coma only to have him hate you.” He pulls the third bowl to him without ceremony.
"Okay," Harry said. "Will Stella be acting Captain?"
"Hello," Draco said. He looked as if he didn’t know whether he should be coming or going, as if Andromeda might toss Draco out the door in favour of Harry. But Andromeda recovered first before Draco was able to open his mouth to excuse himself.
The next day at dinner, Harry decided to drop in at Andromeda’s for something to do. Unlike Molly, she fussed over Harry in a way he enjoyed. But when she answered the door, her voice was subdued.
"Hi," Harry said back.
Draco can’t help the warmth in his chest, the soft grin on his lips. He had met Julie only once after Harry had gone into a coma. They bumped into each other in the street near their house, and when she had questioned Draco about Harry missing classes, he had tried to explain the situation to her as best as he could, without falling apart or breaking the Statute.
"Oh, I'll be fine. It's no worse than I imagined. Percy had told me George might not be happy I was here. It…it’s sometimes more strange when people pretend everything is fine."
Harry stays silent for a long while, so long Draco lifts his head and searches for his gaze. The bond screams for him again, an emotion he can’t decipher.
"This was supposed to be fun," Draco said. Draco was red in the face now, sweating properly.
Her skin seems more thin and dry than before, wrinkled. Mother’s beautiful blonde hair has lost part of the glow it used to display.
"No." If anything, Draco pressed Harry into his neck harder, his stubble catching a little.
Draco winces back at the use of his surname.
"No." Harry raised an eyebrow.
It all washes away when he sets eyes on the figure lying on the bed. Still motionless, but with green eyes that shine in the dim light of the hospital room, chest heaving so hard it’s evident he isn't asleep anymore.
Harry was the one keeping their house clean, and he knew Draco would turn everything into a mess, now that they were alone again.
“Fuck,” Elle whispers, dropping her arm back to the bed with a thud. She lifts the other one and drops it limply on the bed again. “Fuck,” Elle repeats, using her hands as support to raise her torso.
"You have money, and you look like that." Draco made a large sweeping motion with his hand. "You don’t need a style."
Harry.
“Two weeks, minimum. If you still look like this when you come back, you’re off again.”
“You’ve tried that before.” It’s clear that Healer Cameron is making a huge effort to keep her voice level. “It didn’t work. If you take her magic out completely, you do not know the consequences on Elle’s body.”
, not your other versions.
"SafeHome is close to your heart," Lee remarked.
“I know this. Do you blame me? I had you and I lost you! I’ve lost you for years. I still—” His voice breaks with a sob. Draco fights the urge to hide his face under shaky hands.
Harry had forgotten that they were related. "He’s fine?" It came out more like a question than an answer, but she seemed satisfied nonetheless.
"I’m only telling you because I think it is bound to be hilarious…but Draco Malfoy's best for this. I'll send his card by Owl."
Has it ever been so difficult to dress up for a date?
Barb closed the office, and they went off to lunch at a vegan restaurant in Shoreditch and chatted a little about nothing in particular. She sent him off with a smile to some Muggle athletic club nearby for a massage and access to their pool. He swam laps for far longer than he should and waited until evening to return. Harry had something halfway to an apology for Draco, but he didn’t see any sign of him, and he was running late for his weekly firecall with Hermione.
Draco did in the end. He met Harry in front of the stadium and they walked to the pub together, mostly quiet.
That night, after the rest of the house was asleep, he crept into the mansion’s library. Never in his life, not even in his first set of race-thestral training courses, had he ever actually picked up a book and read about them. He trusted what his father taught him, what his father’s trainers taught him. He trusted what he saw with his own two eyes, every day, in the Malfoy stables.
Harry always comes back and grins at Draco, despite the fact that Draco’s unable to fix him, to make it better. All he’s ever wanted was for Harry to be happy, but now he’s realising he might be the one causing him pain, keeping him locked up in this place, when Harry wishes to escape.
He’s not Harry.
“Ruby it is, then.” Draco’s fingers rake across Ruby’s head and she purrs happily.
Draco moves in the next day, and the stray cat comes with.
He's content enough to be a recluse in his small bubble of grief for a little longer.
Things have been amicable. They haven’t interacted with each other since the day at Serendipity, and the only thing Draco got from Harry was the reply to his missive, stating that he had no intention of taking anything away from Draco. But he'd accept the ring.
Harry winced.
"Hi Pansy," Harry said. Pansy busied herself tidying her desk although all the pens and quills looked plenty organised.
The hit gave him mild whiplash, and Harry’s shoulder had bruised to the bone. The Healers healed the inflammation as deep as they could and put Harry on a regime of twice-daily potions and rest. Although it wasn’t a direct hit to the head, Coach wouldn’t even hear of Harry coming near training until he was cleared.
"Why do you think you should be my agent, then?"
“That was wonderful,” Harry declares, shaking his head sceptically. “And that song is so…”
Draco’s eyes were still glittering. "I would have given it to you if you asked."
"No, we're not running. Your Uncle Harry is the athlete, he's the one you'll be wanting for all your acrobatics."
It took a stranger’s hand in my neck, making my skin crawl, and your lonely step in my direction to get me fetching Luna and fleeing the hell out of that place faster than my heart could beat.
Harry points at Draco’s handiwork, still resting on the stove, before he has a chance to say anything. "It smells fantastic.”
"Good at his job, though," Seamus conceded.
Harry pulls away, a smirk playing on his lips. “Healer Potter? I like how that sounds.”
“I missed you too—”
And fear of being rejected again.
It’s a promise he had made before, and hadn’t been able to fulfil. Draco can’t live with the guilt of so many broken promises weighing him down. He needs to bring Harry back.
“What are you doing here?”
means, not truly believing that Harry had a relationship with another Weasley before him.
Draco gasps, darkness filling him with every breath, spreading in his veins like venom. His entire body burns, the sting in his eyes doesn’t subside when he blinks away tears. There’s nothing he can do to thaw the coldness in his bones.
You took your hand back, hugging yourself, apparently uncertain. “Will you… Will I see you again?”
"I’m going to tell you something, and you’re not going to like it. But it’s not about him. It’s about you," Pansy said.
Today would be a good day to go to Cardiff again. Apparating and the Floo were out of the question with his shoulder, so Harry took some Muggle money and made his way to Paddington to fork over the extra for a last minute train to Cardiff. The cityscape rolled its way into countryside and back again. No one paid Harry any mind this late November morning, in his train car filled with Muggle businesspeople who weren’t looking out the window at all.
He’s alone in the void.
"I vote for Baby, because of the cheeks," Sam said, reaching up to pinch said cheeks. Atty slapped his hands away.
My heart stopped for a second and then started slamming so hard against my chest, I had to wonder if maybe it hadn’t even slowed.
It only hurts because they’ve been here before, of course. They had navigated the volatility of their relationship in the past already, the mistrust and suspicion that nothing would change. But that is all gone. Draco

Words are not enough to translate the feeling of the lump in his chest where Draco’s heart should be beating. He gapes at Harry, who stares back, unaware of Draco’s internal turmoil.
told me," Harry said. "How was I supposed to know?"
“Oh, Merlin! He really is awake, Draco. It worked!” Pansy gushes, and Draco’s attention snaps back to her. She casts her wand around, and a series of vials fly from her pockets onto the side table. “Here, Potter, focus on me.”
"I know. But I try not to live governed by the whims of cruelty. It's no life at all."
"Sorry," Atty said.
Harry’s feet drag him around one couch, eyes darting from the wall overflowing with Draco’s fiction books, to the hearth’s overmantel, where a photograph of a Harry kissing a smiling Draco’s cheek as they stare at each other rests. Harry from the picture moves back a little, but his Draco pulls him back to a kiss on the lips, before it rewinds and starts again.
Luna smiles sympathetically, but it doesn’t reach her eyes. “Draco, he has no memory of anything after he died in the battle.”
"I don’t have the connections with the old families if you want to use this to become a bigwig in the League when you retire. I’m Muggle-born," Barb said bluntly. "I am a small-time agent with a handful of athletes in smaller leagues. You would be my most high profile client by far."
He doesn’t. Instead, he and Pansy leave the room when Harry's magic turns too wild and threatening. He knows better than to disturb a patient, even if said patient is his own husband who has no desire to see him.
It’s scary, too.
More than once in the past, Draco's had fun visualising Harry cheerily arguing with those other students, or lying on the grass under the shadow of a tree, notebook in his lap, doodling whoever crossed his way. In the images his head provided, Harry
Draco doesn’t know for how long he walks. The sun disappeared behind the thick dome of darkened leaves hours ago, but he’s unsure if it’s just hidden behind the darkness emanating from that place or if it’s just set. He’s lost count of time, the same way it'd happened when he met Harry at the After place.
"Is that how you see yourself? Pushing the League forward?"
it, hoping to see Harry, and whenever Harry stays long for too many days at a time, Draco ends up smoking a new pack of cigarettes.
"A little swollen as usual, but the bone is normal density; muscle and tendons are nice and strong. No sign of the sprain. Penelope will give you a new routine, but there’s no reason to baby the ankle, it all looks good."
"I think she’s too tired to be stubborn," Harry reassured.
I shrugged, saying, “Just running away.”
He’s sure he can do that again.
, Draco repeats mentally. He’s not even alive right now.
“I like yours too.”
Julie says they’re evading her, trying to get out of paying their bet. Draco has no intention of paying, if he’s honest. It’s not his fault that he lost it. Not that he’ll let the truth out. He’s been too pleased about Harry’s sudden and rare spark of jealousy to be more concerned about their little punt. But he wouldn’t prevent Harry from having his friends over, either.
. “Why the bloody hell would I hire him?”
“Don’t call me Potter. It’s weird.”
Draco gets up, ignoring his protesting limbs, watching as Pansy starts a series of diagnostic spells upon Harry’s quiet body. His eyes follow the strings of golden light coming off from the tip of her wand, circling Harry’s body, surveying his state after a 5-year-long coma.
"Who showed you their family ring? That’s very intimate. You don’t look at other people’s." Her eyes had narrowed suspiciously. "If someone is trying to trick you into marriage, it won’t hold up in court. I’ll have it thrown out by the Wizengamot in twenty seconds."
"It does," Draco agreed. He took off a bracelet from the stack hidden under the sleeve of his jumper, a thin circle of silver. Just a small flick of Draco’s wand, and it circled the tennis ball.
“What do you mean?”
Harry pulls away, despite Draco’s insistent fingers. He looks at Draco searchingly.
“I don’t... I don’t know what we were, or if we’re ever going to...” Harry scratches his neck again. Draco finally lifts his head, but Harry avoids his stare. “I don’t really know you, Malfoy. What I mean to say is...”
"Do the Icelandic Ambassador at the Roses dinner," Adrian said. Gemma tapped her nail against her lip.
"She’s put a Permanent Sticking Charm on the back," Harry said, watching Draco prod the gilt frame with his wand.
"I’ll be sure to put bells on. What are you doing now?"
There was a new glass case in the library and all of his dad’s Snitches were in it, also labelled by date. All the trophies Harry had brought here without knowing what he would do were here. A glance upward and he saw that Draco stored every single one of his brooms along the top of the shelves on racks.
“You are unbelievable Potter.”
Mrs Weasley doesn’t mention Harry, nor does Draco, as much as all he wishes is to know more.
“Draco!” He hears, followed by a series of the same anxious knocks. “Draco, I know you’re there. Open the door!”
"You're always
He lets out a ragged breath as Harry turns around and faces him.
"Custom charmwork," Hermione answered. Then, a few small details snapped into place.
I held you tighter. “What about you?”
“I can feel it,” she whispers, lips brushing against the wood, though her eyes are on Draco’s. She places the twig back on the small table and turns to him.
," Draco said, as if outraged by his lack of frosting. "If you’re going to eat cake for breakfast, do it right." Harry thought he enjoyed watching Draco eating it more than he liked the sweetness. Draco relished his slice so much, making sure each forkful had the same ratio of cake to frosting, chasing each crumb.
"I was exercising," Harry said by way of explanation. "I went longer than I expected, but I can shower later."
After match one, Draco sat on the side of the pool while Harry swam his recovery laps. He complained about all the damp, but he sat there anyway with a leatherbound book. Draco snapped the book shut when he noticed Harry swam close enough to read it. Draco’s concession to being poolside was his second best loafers. It wasn’t productive, but every time Harry ended a few laps, he would peek up at Draco, still on the pool chair, flipping through his tome.
Draco’s eyes cast to the nearest exit, considering if there’s the slightest chance he can make it and slip away from her unheard-of worried gaze.
Harry realised that he had only seen Draco using his expertise to build or fix things. But there was something about watching as Draco stripped all the protective wards and magic from the tapestry until it was nothing more than flimsy time-worn fabric crumbled to ash and dust. All its meaning gone, just like that.
"It’s not a formalised field. It’s partly curse-breaking, but it’s also ward construction, history, magical theory, and a little arithmancy. Pure-blood families don’t tend to share secrets. So I cobbled it together from different family lore, papers people had collected, books on magic theory from different cultures…" Draco gestured expansively.
So Harry had a lot of free time for a week with nothing to do. Harry woke up at six before remembering he wasn’t allowed anything more strenuous than a brisk walk. All his friends were at work. Even Ron was busy most weekdays with his consulting work. He turned to his pillow and groaned.
, again and again.
"If you want," Draco said. But he narrated aloud so Harry would know what he was doing.
“But being with me… you…” Harry shakes his head, leans forward and rests against Draco’s shoulder.
"I like you because you’re good at your job. And smart. And fun to be around. You changed. Recognising that was easier than doing it." Although saying it aloud, Harry wondered if it hadn’t been the same process but more emotionally difficult with Draco, to come to expect better of them. To see other people were allowed to change like Harry had. They all had to live with themselves.
"I had to go see my parents' solicitor. Every few months my father accuses me of having stolen one thing or the other, then I have to come up with documentation that it either always belonged to me or that it’s somewhere in the Manor."
“How do you feel?” Luna asked, a smile tugging the corner of her lips.
"I’ve seen this chandelier before," Luna said, tapping her toe. "It’s in the Muggle Wizengamot." Not that knowing where things were from was particularly helpful for returning them. Sneaking into Westminster was probably some sort of crime.
"I owe you a Life Debt. If you had wanted to invoke it, I would be here anyway with considerably less money to show for it." His tone was bitter.
, Harry had argued. But he does, and he grows to appreciate all the notes Draco leaves him.
"Guys, leave her alone," Harry said. Luc and Milo ignored Harry and continued trying to figure out what rhymed with Blake.
"Don’t be shy," Harry teased. Another huff of laughter from Draco.
“Nothing. You know what?” Harry rises from the couch, worrying his lower lip. He takes a glance at their picture over the hearth mantel, and when he turns to Draco again, his expression is stern. “I do resent you, Malfoy. For not telling me this before. I’ve got to get out of here.”
When Draco arrives at St Mungo’s, he’s dizzy with anticipation. The sobering potion barely does anything against the nerves keeping his limbs jittery and his eyes darting from one corner to the other.
He feels his own magic as well as the bond’s trying to keep the cold out, esconcing him in warmth and comfort. It’s odd how something that feels so good can be so exhausting. He knew bonding his soul to keep Harry here would be difficult, but he had hoped Harry would be by his side in this venture. No such luck.
Perhaps there’s a chance they might even be friends. They had crossed that bridge before, after all.
Harry is finally awake, and there’s
Elle’s taut posture sags, head sinking into the pillow. “I know. I’m just tired.” Her voice is small, so small Draco has trouble hearing it.
Luna holds Ruby in her lap, and Draco stares at them both with a soft tug on his chest. He fully believes he wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for Luna and her insistence on his mental health. He probably wouldn’t have met Harry again. They wouldn’t have fallen in love like they did. He wouldn’t have these friends he calls family.
“Will you ever learn, Malfoy? Will you ever see that we’re just trying to help you?”
Draco had most of the books transported from the Manor the previous week, refusing to set foot in the place again. Harry can’t stop complaining about the amount of books piling up on their flat—and, honestly, this isn’t even half of the Manor’s collection—and Draco, for the most part, refuses to shrink them. It could mess with their magic. Most of the magic in them is faint, some are dark, but Draco can feel it whenever he touches a page. Some of the volumes are older than their lineages and too important and delicate to mess with, but that’s a concept Potter doesn’t seem able to grasp.
"I've been told that on many occasions."
He’s not sure how to do this anymore. How to
Draco’s not done trying. He can do more, he knows this. He’s sure there’s a way out. There's a cure. There has to be.
"I think it is your lunch time. Can we all say a big thank you to Mr Potter for answering questions?" Pansy said. She was gentle with them, but something about her voice seemed to captivate them. They hung off her every word like she had sweets in her pockets.
Draco paused for a long, long moment.
His fingers clench around his abdomen, the nauseating feeling of loss and helplessness growing inside of him. Draco barely registers the need to throw up, and almost doesn’t make it into the bathroom fast enough to dispel whatever he’s eaten today in the toilet. His retching echoes against the tiles, a disgusting noise filling his whirling head. He sobs and hopes he can release some of the ugliness inside him, along with the food. Draco wonders if his heart might come out now and decides quickly he doesn’t need it. He doesn’t want to carry it anymore.
“I’m bonded to Harry.”
Who could forget? Giannopoulos, the Arrow’s Keeper, would be in any advert he could sign for the next decade to pay back all the high interest loans his spouse of seventy-two hours had taken out before disappearing to Isla Mujeres.
Harry opens his mouth to answer, certainly something dirty if his smirk is something to go by. He's interrupted by someone bustling down the door.
"Her portrait won’t come back. The house has put it in storage for you. All you had to do was ask."
Harry was still absorbing that information when Andromeda cut back in. "Well, you didn’t come here to listen to my bitter griping. Come to the kitchen, I made you that squash salad you like so much. Teddy's looking forward to Junior Falcons camp."
“How long will it last?” she asks, finally.
"Who put down oysters on the orders?" Theo asked. "Who ordered a Merlot?"
Something about the plea undid Harry. The idea of Draco reduced to single words was heady. If Harry had more patience, maybe he would see if there was a point where Draco lost speech entirely. But Harry only paused to breathe through his nose before taking Draco further down his throat.
“And you’re a prat who happens to be hot and on the wrong side of the tracks, what are you gonna do about it?”
"Yes, Jean. No, Jean, that’s fine you don’t have to come. Very kind of you. Just a cold. Thanks, thanks so much. We’ll call in the morning," Ron said.
Draco touches his fingers to Harry’s heart, the thundering pulse beating under the skin. Harry is alive, warm and looking at him like Draco’s his entire world again. Draco is not sure he will survive this night without having his own heart combust inside his chest.
"Yeah. We should," she said. And this time when she smiled, it was big and bright.
“You’re here,” Draco sighs, hands fumbling over Harry’s entire body as if he doesn’t remember its shapes, just needing to be sure it’s really happening. “Harry, you stayed.”
It’s not a surprise the pub is empty on a Monday night, except for the couple in the corner and an old man nursing a solitary pint at the counter. The quietness is a blessing, though. Those people don’t really know who he is, but Draco doesn’t want anyone else witnessing his misery at the moment.
Harry’s friends laugh, but Harry’s loving gaze, now fixed at Draco, is proof enough that he truly believes the joke. Harry pulls him by the collar into a kiss, and the table erupts in whistles and drunken chuckles of, “you’re making me nauseous, we believe you,” and, “get a room!”
Harry was more startled by the use of his name than anything. He assumed Draco would be stubborn and continue to call him Mr Potter or Potter, and they would keep their distance that way. But Draco just brushed that aside like it was nothing.
"I can't believe you, of all people, would hang around with—"
. His eyes, his lips, his scent, everything is wrong and Draco can’t help the way his stomach falls at this. He’s not Harry.
stop worrying about everything, he
“Draco,” Elle repeats, closing her eyes again with an agonisingly slow motion. Her tone is soft, though it sounds pained. “It’s okay, Draco.”
And it must show on his face, for even Elle pats him on the shoulder when Draco tries to cast a diagnostic spell on her. She’s one of his long-term patients, one of the cases he was assigned right after he stopped being Harry’s Healer. Her curse, allegedly unbreakable, settled inside her bones, slowly shutting down all of her body movements. She is cold and quiet, and always says she’s learned to live with her own demons, despite his insistence on trying to break her curse. She’s too young to have to live with that.
"Hello," Harry said. His voice came out hoarse.
And it’s not that Draco didn’t hear the first time she called, he just can’t find his words anymore.
"Hello," Harry said. A normal person might have contacted someone or at least summoned an owl from his mailing service. Harry had instead walked for an hour and showed up on Pansy’s doorstep after his workout, and he was both overheated and shivering cold. Being famous had ruined him; he was a little too used to showing up somewhere and being accepted.
“Would never happen, I’m not gay.”
The setting for their not-so-accidental meetings change when people start noticing them walking together in St Mungo’s more often and start asking questions. Meeting Harry outside the hospital causes Draco to experience a whole new level of anxiety and his mind spirals between
"Why?" She scrunched up her face, and she fleetingly reminded him of Hermione at eleven.
They talk for hours in the night, reminiscing about Elle, about their life together. Harry holds Draco close when they fall asleep on the mattress on the floor, and he doesn’t leave again.
It gave Harry a funny feeling to have Draco Malfoy look at the place he slept, the nondescript second-smallest bedroom. He hadn't thought about Draco looking at his rumpled sheets this morning when he got up.
"Show me around," Harry said.
But Hermione came back and was at her limit for emotional discussions. She proceeded to tell them over dinner about her current campaign about wand legislation for sentient magical beings.
"Neither of you would have had it easy," Harry said softly.
"Like one of your romance novels," Draco said, eyes lighting up.
. I mean, that’s the weirdest part.” He chuckles softly, but his eyes can’t meet Draco’s and it makes something uncomfortable boil inside him.
"I just…I dunno. I love Quidditch. I think even if I had a completely different childhood, I would still love Quidditch. It was the only thing that felt like it wasn't just another task someone gave me. I chose it for myself," Harry said.
Harry doesn’t respond. They don’t talk again before they go to bed that night. Pleads, rage and despair assault Draco’s mind all night, but what wins in the end is hope. He can fix it, if only he has a little more time. Harry will be fine, they will both be fine.
Everything has a history. And Draco’s so fucking sick of this. Of remembering, of feeling.
Potter slowly starts opening up to the group. Every session, whenever Draco says something, Potter immediately asks to share something in return. Even though they’re surrounded by other people like them, it always feels like it’s only them when they talk.
"It’s not a constellation," Draco murmured. Harry shook his head. Draco counted them. Ten stars, Harry knew by heart. He didn’t want to explain who each star was for. He didn’t need any more allusions to wartime or want to explain who didn’t get a star either. Showing them to Draco was already overwhelming.
“How the hell would I know that, Potter?”
Harry shrugs. “Sometimes. Only sketches. I’d draw Draco, but he’s such a wuss and won’t pose for me.”
The next day, their faces are splashed over the papers. Draco doesn’t even care, because Harry is by his side in the picture and he’s smiling at Draco.
He tries not to get too caught up about how they never say “
The lie nibbles his insides. There’s
"Everyone knows about you. You just gave an interview. I thought Quidditch was improving," It was interesting to watch Draco puzzle out the bizarre calculus that dictated Harry’s life in real time.
did you do it?! I’m his Healer! You could have… God, you could have killed him, or yourself!”
. He needs to touch him everywhere, to have his lips on Harry’s body, his fingers on every patch of skin he can find.
"The call is final. Get back on your broom, or I'll penalise you too."
to push him around in bed—and put a steady arm across Harry's chest pulling them closer still, with small movements of his hips. He wrapped a hand around him then and in the end, Harry didn't know what tipped him over the edge. Only that Draco followed with a soft "oh fuck" as if he was surprised.
Harry was about to say no, but then he did. It felt like cool, calm relief like a glass of ice water on a hot day. He felt it, but he couldn’t say where the feeling came from.
The feeling of fear and anger never leaves, and Draco’s so hopeful. He’s sure they come from Harry. He doesn’t ask Harry, though, what is it that’s pulling him away from Draco. Instead, he reaches for the thin line of the bond between them, of their magic, and pulls as hard as he can, trying to keep Harry here.
“The sight--what happened, so you can see them?”
Draco eventually remembered. Much like that watch, stars ticked across the face in a steady sweep.
"Yes, Coach."
." Harry said.
before stopping in front of Harry.
Draco learns new things about Harry each day; the different grins he has hidden behind his lips, or the new ways his eyebrows wrinkle when he stares at Draco. Harry is less subtle than he used to be. He’s electric and excited about
Draco made a face. "Now?" It was in the middle of breakfast.
“You’re off, Draco” she’s saying, but her tone is soft and she loosens her grip on him. “You should take a couple of weeks off.”
"We love you, Mum. You just don’t have to do every single holiday by yourself," Bill said.
He always waited until day two after the championship media circuit to think of something he could do in the offseason that would make him feel accomplished but not piss off his coach or his trainer. He learned better three years ago with the Running of the Bulls after the Quidditch World Cup. Coach Raul Jimenez had refused to look him in the eye for two weeks during summer training camp after the
Granger’s shaking her head before he’s even finished. “No. I mean, yes, that’s true, but not only that.” She stops, glancing intently at him. “Draco, he sucked the life out of the Malfoy’s Tree of Life. He exploited its energy.”
That's when they start hearing their song. Harry looks up, as if there’s something in the sky only he can see. Draco follows his gaze and meets the nothingness of the dome surrounding them.
"You can keep the glasses," Draco said and proceeded to re-enact that scene with such extraordinary attention to detail that Harry was certain he had read that book and also the one that was on his dresser last month. Very faithfully done aside from the bit with the enchanted ropes, although Draco improvised admirably.
“Get what?”
His grin is almost impossible when he shakes Harry, but it dies slowly on his lips as the seconds tick by and Harry doesn’t open his eyes.
The man's grin broadens a bit, as if this is not a sufficient rejection, and he doesn’t glance in Blaise’s direction when he leans closer. Draco all but holds himself stiff not to lean back from him, though he pretty much wants to.
to be someone else for one night. You could use charms, polyjuice (as long as the hair in the potion was muggle) or anything you’d like, but the magic in the place would shift your appearance to how you truly felt — regardless of whether you liked it, thus overwhelming you.
Draco brought up his hand and squeezed at Harry's bicep, then pressed Harry against the wall next to the cupboard. Harry's pulse fluttered hummingbird-quick in his neck. Most people had expectations that Harry would be the one to do the pushing. He liked it, but he liked this too.
"Can I watch a little before training?"
Draco rushes to say, “No, it doesn’t. Go on.” This is a secret only Draco knows, and it would be enough for him to want to hear it. It helps that everything Harry tells him is fascinating.
"Well, I suppose no one's ever asked me to marry them, and I've never wanted to ask anyone," Harry answered. They amused him. This pretend press conference was much more fun than the real thing.
that person, somewhere inside, somewhere in his past. And part of him always will be. This Harry, who saved him a few weeks ago from Fiendfyre, who doesn’t know who Draco became, who hasn’t shared a life with him, has every right to resent him forever. He still can’t explain how his Harry fell in love with him in the first place.
“I don’t...” Draco shakes his head slowly. “Would... would you do it now?”
"Interesting," Draco said. Draco looked at him now like he looked at everything else in the house—like something solvable, knowable.
The man’s face falls a bit, but he’s still smiling when he backs away and insists on buying the drinks before he leaves Draco’s side.
First, he learned that the world of race-thestrals is saturated by violence and driven by greed. In his childhood naivete, he assumed his father and his colleagues loved thestrals the way he loved them, that they bred them and raced them because they are magnificent, clever beings whose quiet power is unmatched by any other magical creature. He only had to spend one evening tending to the wounds inflicted as punishment on a young, high spirited colt to realize the people running the industry don’t care for the animals, not at all. They only care about their profits.
Luna seemed satisfied by my resolve, a slight smile spreading on her lips, while she applied eyeliner on me. “I’ll be there too, so don’t trouble yourself more than you have to. If you're not alright, we’ll take off.”
"I’ll be out of your hair, don’t worry," Harry said.
Oh, right...
He was crawling into Harry’s lap, and even though Harry was a little embarrassed, he held Draco’s gaze steadily.
Draco blurts before he can change his mind, “I could tell you over some coffee?”
"Even if it’s not the way you wanted it to, it usually does." Ron sounded wise for someone their age. He looked at Harry knowingly, though he didn’t press.
Harry had forgotten since Stella and Darcy had done it most often on his behalf. It was months away. Next season. They might still be together then. After tonight, Harry was hopeful. Harry had asked and Draco had come.
"You talk as if the house is alive."
It’s pathetic, he knows, that he hides Harry’s amnesia just to get a bit of sympathy from her. He still does it, shrugging resolutely.
"You are a professional athlete," Draco said. "Do you seriously not know what you look like?"
Draco explains how their—his, Hermione’s and Pansy’s—research had led him here. Though they already knew Voldemort used sacrifices to seize the Tree of Life’s magic, they still hadn’t exactly grasped what had been different about Harry’s death. He explains that only when they’d realised sacrificing something dark near the Tree of Life would open a portal to the After place was that they understood what had been different. Because Harry had a part of Voldemort’s corrupted soul inside of him. This tainted part of the wizard’s soul, still living inside Harry, had been sacrificed when Harry died.
Its towering trunk rises to the sky, still as huge as in his memory. However, it’s now naked, darkened by desolation. The small circle of stones surrounding its base had been destroyed many years ago. If it was still intact, it’d be buried deep in the snow that blankets the tree in a dull white.
"I hate them. I prefer to do community stuff. But the League will never move forward if I don’t put myself out there. All they care about is looking good. So yeah, I’ll do a League event today. If looking at my face makes them do the right thing, I’ll do it."
Harry laughed. "Not the first man to make that offer," he said cheekily. "Where’s Neville?"
His world turns into an overwhelming pain.
"I can’t be home for the renovations today, and I got short notice, so I figured I’d come see if you had anything for me to sign."
Potter bites his lower lip, but whatever he’s struggling against loses out to his bravery. “I remember my friends love me, and that they’d be sad if I vanished. I couldn’t stare them in the eyes if I ever hurt them.”
Harry purses his lips, his frown deepening. “Is that what this is?”
"Not anymore. I fly a little. I think I’m too tall now to be a Seeker," Draco said. Harry measured him up by sight and gently wrapped a hand around Draco’s wrist, holding it out to his side. The wine was going to Harry’s head a little, but Draco hadn’t objected to his touch.
"Less dangerous than a fall," Coach said. "Are you going to try it, or are we going to complain all day?"
Harry repeats with the same certainty. “The tree is there. It’s where I died. I saw it. I
“He could have just left a bigger piece of paper for a note, the bugger,” Draco mutters under his breath, but there’s a smile on his face. He is often confronted with those sticky notes around the house, and he can’t help but find it endearing, the way Harry gets attached to objects like his little yellow pad or his mug.
"You’ve got the hang of it now," he said.
Ron shouted in the background, "He's probably already in deep. Can you tell him to return our bundt pan? I need it for the weekend."
"The heart of this home is the gathering place for my friends and family," Harry repeated. The gold disappeared, and they walked in silence up to the library.
She doesn’t mention his usually impeccable guise is now somewhat messy, or that he probably stinks of whisky, even after three cleaning spells.
Draco rushes to him, holding Harry by the elbows. “We’ll find it, Harry. Look at me.” Harry does. “We will find whatever it is, okay?”
“I just like them.” Your fingers poked my ribs. “You didn’t answer.”
He does it again and again until everything on the table is on the floor. Little by little, his old life is blown to smithereens, the shards digging into his feet. And then, there’s nothing else to break.
Draco was babbling, right hand gesturing extensively. For once, Draco’s words failed to derail Harry. Harry focused on Draco’s left hand, in his pocket. Harry folded his arms across his chest. He recognised an injury when he saw one.
"I think I want to go home, Blaise," Daphne interjected.
"Use your other hand to catch to make it fair," Draco said.
Harry. “Fine. I guess...with that.”
Ron blushed bright red from embarrassment and then answered. "I honestly don't know."
Dean cocked his head and looked at her. "What?" he asked her.
At least my list of potential suspects was narrowed down to under twenty.
Ginny rolled her eyes. "Well, it must have been Hermione who told you that we liked each other, because I know how oblivious you are to other people's relationships," she teased.
and tasted like hope.
Harry just
He doesn’t say that. He usually avoids sharing too much of his personal life with his patients—something his self-conscious, suspicious self from right after the war caught up with time. He doesn’t want to sound like a dramatic and abandoned man, even if he is both.
to each other whenever Harry shows up. Harry always says it was nice seeing him when he leaves, and Draco’s always left with an annoying buzzing in his chest.
Harry whispers in his ear, and Draco can only hope he’ll never forget those words.
It is like Harry all over again.
Still, the guilt was another thing holding me down.
choked on my throat. I rested my head on your shoulder, a sigh heated the air in front of me. “You always look good too.”
Somehow, Rita Skeeter found out about their game and published a story about it in the

Pansy fake-clapped sarcastically. "Dang, Luna," she said. "Career advice: consider being Minister, because they usually have your talent: making long, cringe-y speeches." Ron doubled over, laughing, and told Hermione, "Hey, she's just like you: extremely sarcastic and extremely assertive." He then got a kick under the table and a Silencing charm from Hermione. However, he didn't know what had happened to his voice, because Hermione had been practicing non-verbal spells over winter break but hadn't told them.
Was me.
I suppose you all know what song it is....
”But you can still try,” Draco tells him, and the gentleness in his voice is so surprising that Harry freezes in awe. How was Draco staying so calm when he couldn’t hold his temper through one sentence?
“You should open it, Harry.” was Hermione’s response.
"Yes, you just startled me a bit," replied Luna. "How are you?"
Pansy suddenly looked a lot more mischievous, and in a taunting voice, told him, "Kiss Seamus."
I'm writing this on the train. The lights just went out, and we're stopped for some reason. I'm considering discreetly going to check on Harry or possibly
Keep calm and Drarry on,
"Dang," Seamus commented. "Haven't your parents- oh. Sorry."
”During our time so far at Hogwarts, I haven’t exactly been the kindest to you. I’ve been rude, and a prat.
I spotted Pansy with Hermione today. They were just sitting in the library, studying, talking, and laughing together like friends do. I wonder when Hermione will notice what Pansy
Ron thought for a moment, and then replied confidently, "Truth."
"What?" asked Harry, who had not yet noticed the two girls standing awkwardly about a foot away from the table.
"I guess," Hermione sighed. "See you guys at lunch," she said, and then turned and walked out. After an exchanging of goodbyes, the rest of them went out the door in the directions of their separate common rooms, grabbed their stuff, and headed to lunch.

The second piece of Part VII. Sorry to keep you guys waiting so long for this.
"You good?" asked Ginny.
Suddenly, a blood red ribbon streams through the air and pulls Harry and Draco together. It wraps around Harry’s right leg and Draco’s left, and fastens in a tight triple knot at the back. McGonagall steps just outside of the classroom’s threshold, tells the two bewildered boys, “Have fun,” and leaves.
” she said, looking out the window, her voice soft, “
But it happened anyways.
He reread this, and then hastily added a postscript at the bottom.
Pansy suddenly looked slightly guilty as she responded, "Based on your first reaction, yeah, actually, I did. Based on your second reaction, I was wrong." The entire group laughed at this statement as Pansy sat back and crossed her arms over her chest.
Hey, guys. I'm back.
Who was that?
Anyway, that was enough of a reply for him.
I hope that Eliza is more tight-lipped than me, because my father is pretty anti-LGBTQ — and she came out as gay two months ago.
”Bloody hell,” he groans, rubbing his forehead as he attempts to untangle himself from the Slytherin.
He got up, effectively ending the painful conversation, and started to get dressed. When he was done getting ready, he left the dorms, going halfway down the stairs before remembering that he had forgotten his wand.
Luna was walking to the library to return her books when suddenly Ginny came up beside her.

I got a valentine from someone claiming to be my secret admirer:
As he quickly changed into a pair of lighter pants and a white t-shirt, he couldn't stop thinking about that awful article. The awful words that Skeeter had written about them, the horrible effects it had on the other student's view of them. "
Ever since we came back from winter break, Harry’s seemed... different. He’s less arrogant, less talkative, less

to come down a bit quieter?” she scolded him, and then she glared at him. “I was studying for- Oh! What’s that?” she inquired, noticing the letter in his hand.
After that, Ginny raised her hand. "Can I go next?" she requested, and, getting confirmation from Dean that he and Luna were finished,  she asked Seamus, "Truth or dare?"
"Harry!" A voice calls from behind him in the corridor.
Sirius leaned back in his chair. "Guys, I'll be your Secret-Keeper. You trust me, no one else does, no one else even likes me... what better choice could there be?"
"That is true," agreed Lily. She walked closer to the table and looked at them firmly. "We all know Sirius. We all know how much loyalty he has to his friends. We also know how impulsive he can be, which would actually be a good trait to have in this scenario. And we all know that Peter turns to the higher power, which, at this time, is Voldemort. We are on the losing side, and it would take a miracle to tip the balance. Can we really trust him not to turn to the Death Eaters as a precaution for if we lose?"
Which was still better than what he wanted to say, which was ‘fuck you Blaise, I liked you better when you had your dick in my mouth.’
Heart in his throat, thumping violently, Draco refuges himself in the guest room until his breathing calms down. They’ve been talking for months, touching for a few weeks. Why is it that the way Harry says his name leaves Draco like he’s about to have his universe tipped upside down?
Teddy looked so young. He
But when Draco comes to a halt at the entrance, it is not out of fear, but hope. Harry is standing by the door, waiting for him with a cigarette between his lips.
He got up to play in the back garden of the Burrow with Rose. She was just beyond the boundary of the hedge and Ron stood on the side closest to the house.
"We're going to get caught," Draco murmured. All the same, Harry leaned back on the railing running along the walls and opened his legs in invitation. As soon as the lift chimed closed, Draco was on him, right between his legs, tongue in his mouth, half hard. Draco tugged his hair, and Harry's cock twitched. He was going to have to look into that at some point. The lift stopped on another floor, and they scrambled apart to opposite sides.
and Draco had found himself jobless; how Draco’s and Narcissa’s relationship had been possible again only because of Harry’s insistence and how thankful he is for that. He tells Harry about their lazy mornings, their favourite TV show, Christmases they’d spent at the Burrow with the Weasleys. If Harry is surprised by any of it, he doesn’t show it, just listening intently as Draco narrates each aspect of their lives together.
They often come to visit Harry, and Draco likes to think now they come because of him, too. He enjoys aunt Andromeda’s company immensely and is starting to believe it’s really easy to love a kid like Teddy.
"He loves us too much," said George.
I stared at you, properly stared into your eyes, worrying my lower lip as you glanced back. I tried, but my
"But you don’t watch the whole game play out before you start changing things," Draco said, watching Harry start to move Kenmare’s Chasers to flank the Beaters instead.
This should be a sanctuary, but the papers detailing Elle’s potions treatment are still scattered across the table, staring accusingly at him.
Draco feels a hot gush of air brush his cheeks as a strong arm rests around him. He hunches his shoulder, pushing Blaise gently to the side.
Most of Harry’s things have been returned to their rightful owner now, but Harry’s presence is
It is just his jealousy and sadness trying to take control of his actions, his thoughts. If Draco succumbs to them, will there be anything of him left?
Draco follows her motions when she approaches the bed slowly, as if trying to reach for a wild animal. Harry doesn’t explode on her, but her presence does nothing to diminish the increasing pressure of his powerful magic. Draco can almost taste it, and it resembles nothing of what he’s come to know of Harry’s magic. It has nothing of the rich flavour he used to pour, but a pungent, tart tang.
Everything fell apart on a Thursday afternoon mid-May.
His cheeks redden when he finds Marvin’s stare directed at him.
Harry's eyes were burning and his cheeks wet by the time he closed the book. He tried to let the feeling wash over him. It was silly for a grown man to cry over a grandmother he had never met. And yet, it took a long time for the tears to stop coming.
Harry took himself for a long walk, a meandering path through the neighbourhood for his active rest. It would have made more sense to head to a park, but he wandered all the way to City University of London and back, enjoying just being out with people.
Harry's chest was still tight when the follow-up came: "Is it leadership if Potter can't play? Ms Abidi, it seems that a number of Falcons players have an issue with the culture of Quidditch."
“You got it in Brazil.”
He asks, voice shaken, “Did you hear it again since…?”
“How do people see me, I guess?”
"Did you?" Harry said off-kilter. He didn’t expect Draco to bring it up with him, and he wasn’t sure which of the stock answers he had in his back pocket might address whatever concerns Draco had. Frankly, after his defense of the house’s heritage, if Draco was coming forward in defense of pure-blood bullshit to "understand the historical context" or whatever, Harry might toss him out the door, the house be damned.
close.
"Gemma, for a moment I thought you were possessed by the ghost of Nana Farley. Leave Astoria alone, she loves pining," Draco called from the far corner. He managed to make it sound unspeakably fond, taking the sting from the insult.
Harry keeps staring at him in silence, slightly wide-eyed with lips pursed tightly.
“Beautiful,” Harry finishes. “I would have never guessed you could play like this. You always seemed so…” Harry motions his hands broadly, but the meaning seems to escape his grasp too and he shrugs. “That was great.”
Pansy didn’t, because she doesn’t know he’s here, but Draco’s not about to let his friend get into trouble. “She doesn’t know. I sneaked in,” Draco murmurs.
It was a home. Draco had made him a home. Harry made eye contact with Draco as they came back to the front door. "Thank you for this. I love it. I really love it." Harry kissed him thoroughly against the wall, and Draco was laughing against his mouth.
His heart skips a beat. Then it clenches, knowing full well who’s on the other side of the door, and unable to bear the hope spreading fast. Magic ripples in the air, the bond tugs at him weakly as Draco mutters, “Come in.”
Harry, in lieu of a reply, kisses him again. His lips are soft, barely there.
Harry shrugs. “After being here for so long… I guess you just start knowing things at some point.”
He shivers, but his tired state prevents him from fearing his boss as he says, “I’m a busy man, Healer Cameron. And, actually, my patients need me, if you’ll excuse me.”
“Mate, I forgot,” they both hear from the door.
Draco looks at him one last time before he leaves the cabin, the train, the numbness of the After place.
"Sorry." He knew he was being a bit of a dickhead.
"For a long time, it was fashionable for people to claim they had something of Merlin’s. My family had a gauntlet," Draco said. He spoke warmly of the objects even though he hadn’t warmed back up to Harry.
"1987 was a terrible year for Bordeaux," Draco said. But he poured them two glasses anyway and sipped his.
Draco has a mother he chooses not to speak to, while Harry doesn’t really have the option. He never will.
"No," Harry admitted. He hoped he had been decent, but he knew better than anyone he had not been coping well then.
“Answer me, Draco,” Pansy commands. Her finger pulls his eyelid, a light from the tip of her wand blinding him as she assesses his reflexes. The warmth, he realises, comes from her magic, merged with the mysterious magic of the Forest.
"Yeah, sorry, I didn’t dress up or anything," Harry said. He wore black joggers and a black t-shirt, while both of them looked smart-ish, Seamus in a black polo and beige slacks, and Padma in turquoise robes pinned up in what looked like a complicated series of knots.
Milo spat at the Arrows Chaser, and a second referee had come to push the teams back to their sides. Harry put an arm across Milo’s chest, but he was big enough that Harry knew Milo backed down out of respect for Harry, rather than because of Harry's strength.
Harry managed to rinse the worst of the grime off in the showers. He wanted to get home quickly enough to catch Draco, but found nothing but a note that said: "Anchor objects?"
"Let me heal that for you." Harry reached out and carefully held Draco's hand in his own. It was hot, and he was trembling a little. There were limits to magic when it came to delicate spellwork. Harry pulled out all the glass shards embedded in Draco's palm with a spell he'd learned from another player for removing gravel from skin. Then he healed the cuts and cleaned Draco's hand of the blood.
It should be.
Draco hasn’t thought he would enjoy anything as much as he enjoys her company. He doesn’t let the thought that once she’s gone, the house will be empty and cold again, linger in his head. Draco grins as he hears the woman babbling continuously about whatever show she’s been watching on the TV Draco and Harry had gotten for her years earlier.
"All part of the game," Harry said. If the suggestion of bitterness wove itself in, well, it was honest.
The club was not like any I had seen before. I hadn’t been to many places before secluding myself in the flat, so I wasn’t one to talk. Still, it was not as uncomfortable as the ones Hermione, Ron or Ginny had dragged me before.
Harry’s eyes are still closed, but his face is creased in a scowl, his fingers coming to rest on Draco’s forearm.
He pulls Harry close, arms around his waist. Harry resists. Then he sobs, his body sagging against Draco’s, head resting on his shoulder.
about it. We didn’t go through everything just so that you can give up now that I have you.”
—before Harry’s pulling away and pushing Draco. He’s forced to back away when a stray ball hits the trunk behind them, missing their heads by a few inches.
“I thought it was weird that I don’t call you Potter anymore.”
about the bond. Harry hadn’t had this benefit. “I’d say the grief is ours. The confusion is yours and sadness sometimes mine. The love is always mine.” Probably.
Once the clapping and stomping died down, Coach smiled.
But the next morning, when Draco pulls Harry closer to his chest, whispering apologies in his ear, Harry doesn’t wake up.
"Do you enjoy working for the Falcons?" Charlie asked, taking pity on Pansy.
Mother looks older.
“Don’t have any others, though.”
. There’s an odd sort of peace in the knowledge that he’s not special because of his trauma, but also that he’s not in it alone. This is something he’s never had before, even though it means lying about parts of his magical past to the other members. He doesn’t really know who these people are outside their problems and traumas, and they don’t know the whole Draco, but they still know him better than anyone else.
“Who’ll be there?”
The car ride was short and silent. Harry had never imagined that Draco lived anywhere but London. They pulled into a beautiful deep red brick block of flats beyond a warding spell. Harry climbed out of the car and followed Draco up the stairs and into flat five.
Blaise shrugs. “You know, protective magic, a boost in the magic, the access to some ancient rituals no one really practices anymore.”
The glass showed my body back at me, bare torso, a round scar right above my heart, staring back at me. I didn’t quite know what I was looking at. Me? What I had been? What I wanted to be? I guessed
It shouldn’t be allowed. That he got to have
No. Draco tries not to think about it. Pansy’s by his body’s side, making sure he
"Morning."
He searches Harry’s face, but he’s still staring at the picture, circling the shape of the musical instrument with his index finger. He finally lifts his head and gazes at Draco, eyes unreadable. “You play?”
Despite Harry’s warning, Draco croons against his nape as he climbs up the mattress. Harry grumbles absently, but creeps closer, pressing his back to Draco’s chest, so open and pliant Draco’s heart does a loop. Harry treats him as if he’s worthy of it all; his dinners, his trust, even his warnings.
“Everything is going to be perfect now, darling, I promise. I’ll take care of you.” His fingers rake over Harry’s fringe, shoving it away from his face—Draco has ensured that Harry had the same care for his appearance as he’s had for years.
Harry glances at him sideways, before snorting away the doubt. “Fair enough.” Then he adds, eyes boring into Draco’s, “Still, that’d be a memory I would’ve pretty much liked to keep.”
“I like your eyes,” your voice was distant and warm, your hand rising and leaning to my face.
Draco stops when he takes in Harry’s offended expression, sure he’s said something terribly wrong. Thinking he must have ruined their date—and trying to remember it is not a date, just ex-husbands, maybe friends, hanging out—he pulls back, mouth slack and an apology ready.
"You paint your nails," Draco said as he pressed his ear to the wall of the kitchen. He should have looked ridiculous, five inches from Harry’s right hand listening for something no one else could hear, no wand. Harry thought about telling him he looked like a Victorian pirate with his ruffled silk shirt today to even out the deep sense of embarrassment on his part.
As soon as they exited, they dissolved into giggles.
His only safe space, for a while, is the centre, but this too is taken from him soon after, when the press spots Draco, Harry, and the stray that always follows them home walking down the streets. And from there it’s just a matter of time until they find Draco’s place as well. They don’t run after Harry this often, but in comparison, Harry’s flat is probably better protected, and he doesn’t go out much. His friends and the Lupin offspring are always visiting, and it’s so often they don’t even flinch anymore when they meet Draco there.
Harry interrupts her, pointing at the door. “Let’s go to my room.”
Up the stairs, the hallways were brighter with the skylight. The garden in the courtyard was still fragrant and wild. Water burbled cheerfully in the bird bath and the call of some unseen bird sounded high up above the dome. There was the gym and the formal dining room with the cabinet hutch full of china. There were little silver tabs and, when Harry touched one, it was Draco’s neat handwriting that said ‘Euphemia Potter, soup tureen’.
That is, until we really got there.
They accept the suggestion easily and Draco is left alone in the kitchen, eyes narrowed and mind racing with a million questions. The most important of them, though, should he cook for more people?
Unable to keep the fretful images at bay—Harry’s eyes permanently closed, his beautiful face ashenly devoid of life—Draco gets up when the sun rises. His feet slowly drag him across the house. He opens all the curtains on the way and bathes in the weak sunlight, trying to squander some of the darkness within him. It doesn’t work.
He’s disappointed. Harry’s sad, because Draco had lied to him, hiding something so important from him for so long.
They find the perfect house two months after they start hunting.
"We're not really—"
Once, he had gone on a handful of dates with a Muggle woman named Samantha right after Ginny. Having only been dumped once before, he hadn't seen it coming when she said, "the problem is, Harry, you're fundamentally incurious," and proceeded in that vein for a long hour until Harry decided he'd had enough and left her in the middle of the Pret in Angel Central.
"You didn’t answer me earlier," Draco said, breathy.
Draco stared blankly, still uncomprehending.
—house.
“And what was that about?”
"I don’t know what to do," Harry said. "I don’t know how to fix this."
"The Fidelius from before is active. I can re-do it, and you can become the Secret Keeper," Draco said.
"Hi Harry," Teddy said, oblivious to the awkward standoff that had just happened.
It’s not like he didn’t know. He’s been living that reality since the day he sent Harry back his wedding ring.
Despite being bulkier than Draco, his joggers end up being large for Harry and he has to fold the hems so they don’t drag on the floor. He looks good, though, hovering near his furniture as if he’s always belonged there, and wearing Draco’s favourite sweatshirt. It’s the first piece of clothing Draco bought after he left home. The fading turquoise contrasts beautifully with Harry’s tanned skin.
Draco chuckles, but his laughter is too hysterical for Harry not to notice there’s something wrong. Green eyes blink open in the night. Harry asks, “What’s wrong?”
The quiet stretches between them for a while, and Draco finishes his bowl. He reaches tentatively for another.
Harry looked down automatically, although he was way too lucid for this to be one of those dreams where he didn’t realise he was naked. He wore his black training leggings, and he had kicked off the baggier shorts overtop because it had been too hot. His t-shirt was no worse than anything else he owned, if a bit short in the torso. He had spelled away the worst of the sweat, but it was an unusually hot summer, humidity lying like a thick blanket over London and cooling charms fizzling out unless reinforced on a regular basis.
Elle lets the conversation drift to their usual flow easily and neither of them brings up Harry again.
There was always one last good match in the autumn before the weather turned permanently gloomy and cold. Overcast, a little windy but clear visibility. The match against Puddlemere was going to be it.
"Harry, do you know what they’re calling this one? An Act to Protect Wizarding Heritage Against Discrimination. It’s condescending rubbish, is what it is."
“Draco,” Harry weeps in a low tone. “Please…”
Harry stood and Draco sat at the piano, but had turned to face him, elbows resting easy on the fall board and legs spread.
"Gregory, you should really try to do something more respectable with yourself," Miles said. As with most things, he said it as if it were a joke.
"Sorry," Harry said. Draco waved him off. He didn't act like it was strange at all. He just undressed, neatly folding his own clothes on a chair by the wardrobe. Harry followed suit while Draco took off all his rings and dropped them on the nightstand. He seemed to decide Harry's bed was good enough because he was out like a light in seconds. This was more intimate and trusting than anything else they could have done. He was confused but tiredness won out. Harry crawled into bed and fell fast asleep.
Healer Cameron nods sternly to him, and Draco continues, “Miss Carrey, I won’t lie to you. This is a risky procedure. It’s not only dangerous, but there’s a chance it may not work. I’ll let you know all the ways it may not, of course. But in your current stage... I’m afraid there’s no other option.”
After everything he’s been through to get Harry back—and everything they’ve been through during the last two years of their marriage—Harry just… It’s not fair that he doesn’t remember a thing. That he’s left Draco alone again.
He fingers a red mug distractedly.
"He did," Miles confirmed.
Refusing to become involved in the Ministry beyond the war trials had given most people the impression that Harry was nothing special. He was not a rallying point. He liked it better that way.
“No, we don’t,” Pansy retorts.
"Blake seems to attract a lot of negative attention for a rookie," another reporter said. Harry swallowed hard. He was implying that perhaps Atty, by being who she was, attracted it. His temper flared a little higher.
Draco doesn’t think twice, taking Harry’s hands in his own. He sighs heavily, skin prickling with the contact.
Don’t feel hope, he wills himself. Harry can’t possibly be coming to see Draco.
"They’re very cute. And very loud." The glass was probably spelled soundproof.
"Who the fuck is whistling in the weight room?" Atty asked.
"I’m beginning to lose faith in humanity. I don’t understand why the fuck would someone take this." Harry gestured at a bird bath that they moved into the garden.
"Show me," Draco said.
“Thank you.”
Harry chuckled and brought him to his lips again.
It was a solid half hour before Harry saw the glint hovering down at the grass and sped for it. He ducked the Bludger aimed at him but it grazed him as it ricocheted back with a flare of dull burning pain. It had been a risky move even before a Bludger had nicked him. He pulled out of the dive so fast that he could feel the dew from the grass blow back on him.
Draco would be insulted if Harry asked him for an afternoon flying or to come to one of his matches to settle up his debt, though Harry wanted more than anything to impress Draco with his flying. Draco was all about significance and symbolism, as the past few months had more than proved.
“I met your ex,” Elle says, apropos of nothing, while Draco casts some diagnostics later in the day.
"Put your hand to the wall and release it." The wall sucked greedily at this bit of magic. "We’ll keep giving your house your magic so it recognises you. Do that again tonight. See you tomorrow at 10."
Harry shakes his head. “Only silence.”
“But I am.” Harry bites his lower lip, and the act, small as it is, is so much like Harry it hurts to look at. “You didn’t answer me. How long?”
He shouts instructions on autopilot, before he even has time to rationalise what’s really happening. Draco’s losing Elle, and he’s not prepared for that.
It was okay, because the next morning they were both smiling.
"Right, so everyone is doing the flying drills at quarter speed, you hear?" Stella said. There was a chorus of groans.
A tired sigh escaped my lips. “I’m not sure.”
Draco looked at him, coming to the realisation for the first time, that he didn’t have a clue what he was doing.
“Do you, now?”
The server says nothing to that. She turns around and leaves Draco to his misery.
The top of his wand started to glow a faint green, ready to strike Harry at a moments notice but Draco wasn’t expecting the next words to come out of Potter’s mouth.
Harry didn't even miss the extra touching. It used to be that he loved being on the Quidditch team at Hogwarts just because he had grown up touch-starved, and he could glut himself on casual friendliness of a shoulder bump, a huddle, bodies slumped against each other in exhaustion. His friends were used to it, and they let him, although they didn’t quite understand it. Teddy and his friends’ kids were thrilled, realising early on that Harry would let them crawl all over him for far longer than most adults.
"Is that bad?" Harry asked.
And in being able to keep his eyes open as the coldness ebbs away from him.
He takes in the sight of Harry, as he coyly enters the room and closes the door. Harry’s attention is on him again. Not just some accidental grin on the way out or rushed goodbyes. Harry stares at him directly, and Draco isn’t embarrassed in the slightest about his bloodshot eyes and reddened cheeks. He’s human, and he’s hurting, and Harry probably knows that already, anyway.
“To be better. I’m trying, and I want them to see it.” Draco’s voice is small. “I’m afraid it’ll happen again.”
Draco sounded a little embarrassed as he admitted, "Greg likes to name them after Muggle action film characters."
They calmed down for long enough to get through the post-game handshake. The Snitch was fluttering in Harry’s hand, and he switched hands.
“I can’t let you do that.” Harry shakes his head, but there’s hope in his voice. Draco
He wants to scream, but then Elle’s face creases in pain. Draco’s chest warms smugly at her silence. It lasts one second, before guilt is thrumming inside him. He’s here to treat her, not inquire about her odd and (in)convenient friendship with his ex-husband.
Once Astoria blew out the candles in a cherry torte, Harry shifted over to the Slytherin girls while Luna and Draco were talking intensely in a corner. Draco caught him looking and winked. Harry was both pleased and embarrassed.
There are no wards around Malfoy Manor, not anymore. A shiver runs down his spine as Draco makes his way inside through the small crack between the two cranked pickets. Draco’s been so alert all the time—afraid that if he lets his guard down Harry will slip more and more—that when the dark magic in Malfoy Manor tries to reach out for him, to touch him, he immediately raises his shields.
