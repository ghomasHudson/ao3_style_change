"I heard that you were going to try out for seeker next year and I don't want you to think that I am stealing your spot. I don't want you to be mad at me," She pouted which made Draco's heart melt.
"Well, the people of the Wizarding World fear dark magic of any kind. So the Ministry wanted to stay on the good side of the people and they restricted the dark side rights which is made up of mostly purebloods. Anyway, the dark and powerful wizard that started the revolution name was Tom Riddle. Tom Riddle gained followers that he promised that they would get their rights back. But, sadly most of the wizarding world does not know this because before Tom Riddle could fight against the Ministry, someone from the Ministry drugged him. They drugged him with a love potion which made him insane, he killed his followers and many others. He was the one who killed your parents." Mr. Feose stopped and waited for Harry to take in everything.
"No ide-," Harriet gasped as she felt a piercing pain in her head like a flaming needle stuck through her head and saw a bright flash of light, "Adrian Puncy, Marcus Flint, Derek Warrington, Hugh Montague," She said in a deep monotone voice while the words just seemed to appear in front of her. She shook her head as the names disappeared. She turned to Merry horrified after she finally realized what happened.
"Yes, they both have keys to all of your vaults. Your parents wanted Riley to keep your keys and the Ministry doesn't really trust him so Dumbledore also keeps your keys," He explained.
"Yeah," Harriet said quietly on her bed, her stomach was turning so much. She never had a Christmas before, the Dursley's always went all out for Christmas. Dudley always got dozens of presents. Her Aunt always made her cook everything, and when neighbors stopped by to compliment her food, her Aunt would always take the credit. Her Uncle would always have this huge party at work, which she had to cook everything for. But at least the people there liked her food, she always tends to feel like everything she ever does is utter crap.
"Please sit Ms. Potter, Mr. Flint you may leave now. Thank you for directing her to my office." Flint remained motionless, he seemed to have hidden anger but refused to show it on his face. He left without a word after staring at the professor for a while with a blank expression. She sat down in a really cushiony chair that she could sink into. Dumbledore also sat down in a bright orange chair that was also cushiony, the chair made a weird noise which made him pet the arm lightly. Harriet giggled, this man is very silly. He smiled and offered her a little dish filled with candies.
"Yes," Draco seemed to choke back an insult, most likely not to get Harriet mad, "The youngest ones are 8 years old and 7 years old so they never come to any parties yet. And the last one I believe is Slughorn, which the youngest is older than Snape so his bloodline runs through other Purebloods so the name still have purity." Draco sighed at how much he talked.
The group of first year Slytherins made their way to charms. Draco was bragging on and on about his father and his accomplishments. Everyone that is was so amusing but she didn't really mind it. She was learning a lot about his family which interested her. She didn't really care about his accomplishments, to her it mattered if they were respected and if they deserved her respect. As Draco spoke, it seemed his father was respected but by the wrong people. But respected none the less. They walked into the classroom and sat down in the back quietly, except Harriet. Harriet stared at Neville and Hermione up front. Neville looked really scared, like usual, while Hermione was reading, like usual. Harriet decided that because last time she wanted to say a few kind words but couldn't so this time she was. She walked up to him quietly.
"Baxter, Merry." She walked up to the stool and sat down unfazed from anything. Merry didn't seem scared when the hat went on her head. The only thing Merry was worried about was that Harry and she would not get into the same house.
She remembers the book Merry and her read, '101 odd ways to catch the snitch'. Harriet remembered the 27th way, stand on the broom. For shit's and giggles, she did exactly that. She wobbled stood up on the broom, earning multiple gasps and swear words from the crowd. She lunged forward and off of the broom on accident to catch the snitch in her left hand, she almost caught it in her mouth on accident. She fell to the ground, she rolled over laughing while the Slytherin's screamed and chanted. The crowd clapped, not that excitedly though. Merry ran up to her laughing.
"Well yes but the guardian has to be here to give a drop of blood," He said while fixing his papers.
Throughout the day, multiple people wished to Merry for Harriet to get better. Even people neither of them have even met came up to Merry. It was very odd to her, they had no reason to come up to her. Merry just guessed Harriet had that effect on people, they just had to trust her and feel a sense of protection when near her like they needed to protect her. Merry knew Harriet wasn't using this to her advantage, she is simply being herself. She didn't really seem like a Slytherin to Merry, she seemed more like a Hufflepuff with extreme knowledge. For heaven sakes, she once brought cupcakes that she made to the Gryffindors after their lost to Ravenclaws and she stayed for the whole party. She was at the rival house! Maybe in the future, she will show more of her Slytherin side.
"Will come in handy in the future," Merry winked. The girls all giggled while the boys just looked a bit scared. "Now come on." They all rushed to the girls dorm and Merry knocked.
"That couldn't have happened!" Harry laughed. She really did like Merry, she calmed her and made her laugh. She could tell they were becoming quite close.
"Draco dear," Draco looked up at his mother, his face still a bit red. "Here," She flicked her wand at Draco's wet clothes. It dried instantly and the pile of snow on his head and shoulders disappeared. She brushed him off lightly and combed his hair gently with her fingers.
"They are with us," Harriet showed them all of the blankets and first-year students, "Sorry we were watching movies, they were trying to cheer me up with me being sick and all," She pouted in shame. The girls instantly melted and cooed to calm her.
"Will you two be quiet I'm sure the old bimbo of a headmaster can hear you?!" Millicent whispered harshly.
"I just wanted to talk," She smiled which made him blush lightly, "Have you heard about me being the new seeker?"
"Thanks Draco," She giggled and kissed his cheek lightly which made him blush deeply. "See ya later," She giggled and ran to the Quidditch pitch while Draco continued to blush and touch his cheek while smiling stupidly.
As they were playing and laughing while the bright, clean snow fell onto the field, someone smiled at the sight from the dark, isolated forest. The person watched the children play around, their eyes mostly focused on the smallest one with the scar. They whispered a curse so she would fall from the great height and hopefully die painfully. The curse didn't seem to stick on her, she was laughing with the Malfoy because snow hit him in the face. The person grumbled and tried again louder, nothing. Again, louder, again, nothing. She laughed again, happy. She was never meant to be happy, ever. Nor was she supposed to be in Slytherin, it was supposed to be Gryffindor like her parents. The person cursed softly, the plan was failing. It always has, no one knows why. The person quietly left to go inform his failure. Hopefully, the Crucio won't be as long this time.
"Come in!" Professor Flitwick shouted through the door. Riley opened the door and stuck his head in while Harriet stood confused.
"Come here wench!" Piers shouted. Harry ran through the school courtyard as they chased after her. She jumped over some seats and then ran through the forest. They started to get closer to her so she started to run until her lungs started to burn and her legs started to shake. Harriet ran through the forest and into the playground near her Aunt and Uncle's house. Dudley and his gang were right behind her and shouting at her.
"Do you want them?" Ms. Haack asked as Harry read the summary excited. Harry looked up and smiled really wide as she nodded. Ms. Haack smiled back as she checked out the series of book. The warning bell rang which meant 10 minutes until classes start. The two quickly said goodbye and Harry dashed to her English class. English was a yes and no subject for her. She loved writing, reading, and truly understanding the book by stripping it down and analyzing it. But she hated learning grammar and how to write. She huffed when she saw Piers and Dudley waiting outside of the class. They both saw her and smirked.
"Draco did not shut up the whole entire time," She huffed. Harriet giggled and packed up her things. "I was seriously about to punch him."
"Pucey go faster!" Flint yelled across the field. Pucey was last year's seeker but now he was a chaser/back up seeker. Harriet watched practice, just interested in how everything worked. Flint usually had separate lessons for her so she could train in private and not be scared. The keeper of the team was the only other girl who was a seventh year, Daisy Weeble. She was really nice to Harriet and treated her like a little sister. The two beaters were 6th years, Mark Helton and Patrick Grube. And the last chaser was Derek Warrington who was a 5th year and was a friend of Marcus.
"Only if they find out before the drop of blood hits the parchment," The goblin smirked. Harry smirked along with him.
"Felix?" He growled out, the man didn't even flinch at Marcus's harsh expression but Harriet did flinch which made Marcus swear to himself under his breath. The room seemed to quiet down quite a bit, everyone turned to him. The older ones seemed to keep quiet but look at the man judging him, the younger ones were whispering to themselves confused. Marcus and his friends seemed very pissed off at the man who hasn't moved at all.
"Continuing on have you guys seen the Weasley Twins?" Tracey smirked. The girls all giggled while Harriet looked around confused, is this how normal girls act?
"Take out the garbage, Freak!" Her Aunt screeched and held up a pan, threatening to hit her. She squeaked in fear and ran to grab the trash bag. She ran quickly out of the house and threw the garbage in the outside bin. She panted from the run and wiped her forehead. It was very hot and humid outside from the summer heat. She jumped a bit when she heard a cat meow. It was a brownish-gray cat who looked at her with a dull look. The cat was beginning to step towards her, looking focused and her shape started to get a bit fuzzy.
"Now Cedric can you bring Ms. Granger and Mr. Longbottom to their common room while Ms. Potter," Riley winked at her, " And Ms. Baxter can go back however they came here."
"I'm a head boy, I'm supposed to report any students out of bed, immediately," He stressed immediately.
"It really is, most adults barely understand and yet they are the ones making the laws and in charge."
"What would you get if you add powdered root of asphodel and infusion of wormwood?" Mr. Feose huffed. He was quizzing her for her first year of potions. He was trying to stump her but was failing.
"Yes, of course I have my wand, now move!" Harriet slid down the hole and tried not to yell at the sudden drop. Merry slid down with her and bit her lip. Once they were out, they looked around nervously, nothing. The two searched the dungeons carefully and found nothing.
"Don't cry," She sneered at her whimpering niece, "For Merlin's sake! You are such a bother!" She shoved Harriet in the direction of her cupboard, "Get in there!"
"Shh! The class is starting!" Merry hushed Draco which made Harriet giggle. The professor took attendance and when he called her name, he looked directly at her scar. Her scar burned like no other pain she has ever felt before. But she knew he was looking for a reaction from her so she just smiled and said 'Here'. He looked sort of disappointed but for only a second before he put back his stuttering fool act on again. As he talked, well more like stuttered, on and on about a boring subject, she just stared at him wondering why her scar hurt when he looked at her.
"We can do those later, they can wait," Merry yawned and got into bed. Harry nodded to herself and got under the sheets.
"No problem, now I better get going if I were you," He chuckled, "And don't worry I will clean up this mess." The two girls slipped out into the corridors, avoiding professors and other head students looking for the now gone troll or troublesome students.
"He was a seventh year when I was a first year. He did also tutor and help teach potions later on," Riley explained. Harry nodded and looked at her feet wanting to ask questions about her parents and why she had to live with the Dursley's. Riley realized her hesitation to say something but did not say anything.
"Oh, Millicent, there you are," Merry said surprised. A young girl around their age was reading a leather covered book. She was a little overweight but she was still pretty. She had dark brown long hair while hazel eyes and a round face.
"My name is Merry Baxter," Merry said after Harry wasn't replying to her question. Harry knew she was a pureblood from her last name.
"Now you Harriet will be harder to find a wand I know that," Harry stepped for eager to get her wand. After an hour of searching, Harry still didn't have her wand. All three of them were getting frustrated.
"Y-yeah it's j-just em-embarrassing and-and slightly fu-funny," Harriet stuttered while trying not to laugh at herself. Merry still looked at her worriedly so Harriet added," I will t-tell you late-later." Merry nodded in acceptance and turned back to the cat on the desk still confused. Harriet looked around to find Neville who was sitting by Hermione looking very scared and nervous. She wished she could go over there and say some calming words.
"Excellent idea Draco!" Harriet cheered. Merry snorted at Draco pushing out his chest proudly. The trio walked to class while Harriet was slightly scared. Her scar hurt whenever she looked at the professor that taught the gruesome subject. She got a very weird vibe from him. They walked into class but this time Harriet sat away from the professor as possible.
Harriet woke up screaming, sweat dripped down her face. Her throat was burning and her hands were bleeding from the indents of her nails. She gulped down air as Beetlejuice, her snake, tried to calm her.
"Oh yeah, Accio toad," Harry stood and swished her wand that she got a week ago that was shipped to her. Ollivander said it was the hardest wand he has ever made but he was very proud of himself.
"I can't wait to see what Christmas will be like with you in the house," Merry giggled which made Harriet snort.
He let out a breath that sounded like a deep chuckle, "I don't know how else to describe it, they do each other's makeup and talk about boys."
"Don't listen to Ron, we are your friends," Harriet smiled at her, pushing away her anger towards the redhead.
"It is not just a toad, it's a toad eye!" Merry looked at the opened jar of toad eyes like it was about to kill her.
"That was fun!" Beetlejuice hissed which made Harry open her eyes. She gasped at the sight, people running around pushing carts filled with trunks and pets. Owls hooted and cat meowed and purred at their owners. Kids were hugging their parents' goodbye while the parents cried and kissed them. The train was what made Harry gasp so loudly, it was amazing. It was huge and bright with adventure and mystery surrounding it which excited Harry. Mr. Feose motioned them to step forward. People were rushing out of the dozen floos and the wall across from them. Harry looked around for Merry who said she was going to be by the 4th door to get on the train.
"What?" Harry frowned but gasped also when she saw the sight in front of her. The sky was darkened and filled with stars. The sunset was still slightly visible with a giant castle ahead of them. The castle was amazing, it stood out like white on black. Harry accidentally let her hand that was still gliding in the water get the edges of her robes wet but she didn't care. She couldn't believe that this place was going to be her home for 7 years. She eyes started to water a little for the cold air or her emotions, she couldn't tell which. When they got up to shore, Harry was the last to get out of the boats because, to be honest, she wanted to stare a little longer. The group walked up to the castle doors. Every kid was whispering excitedly and looking around. The large man knocked loudly on the wooden door which Harry thought he was going to break down the door. A strict looking woman opened the doors.
"I forgot the ice, hang on," He got up and went to go grab ice. The fireplace rang, Harry got up to go open the gates.
"Thank you, Mr. Bloodworth, for everything. I will come back later this evening to finish," She hinted not wanting the other goblin to know what they were discussing which made Bloodworth smirk knowingly. She followed Griphook to the entrance which seemed to be a cave.
One time Harriet was 5 years old and she drew a picture of her family, her Uncle Vernon, her Aunt Tune, and her Cousin Duds. Her Uncle refused to be called anything else and her Aunt always hated when Harriet called her that but she had a hard time forming words. It was the same nickname that the evil little boy used to call her that was friends with Lily. Dudley quite liked his nickname actually, it was different than the stupid nicknames his parents gave him. It was different from his 'friends' at school, it made him something other than a spoiled kid who is violent. When Harriet brought it home, she was so excited to show her Aunt. To show that they were a family, maybe her good artwork would let her eat a bit more for dinner.  She was shaking with excitement, would her Aunt call them a family finally? She ran all of the way home, she wanted to let them know that she cared, she wanted them to be her family.
Merry rolled her eyes and cuddled more into Harriet's warm blanket, "I have no idea Malfoy, just shut up."
"But I can invite you, trust me the Malfoy's will love you. Draco probably has talked non-stop about to them about you."
"Honey I could be a lot ruder, trust me," Merry chuckled which earned her a light slap on the head from Harriet.
"The stomach of a goat, pregnant female goats are the best for the most powerful and most useful bezoar," She giggled because he was getting so frustrated but was also very proud of her.
Gryffindor: Neville Longbottom who she smiled at after he took the hat off which made him blush and almost fall off the stool, Seamus Finnigan, Hermione Granger who was the bushy haired girl, Lavender Brown, and Parvati Patil
"You are not in trouble, don't worry," He patted her shoulder and walked down the hallway. Due to Harriet's small size, she almost had to jog next to him. They walked around for a bit before they stopped at the Charms classroom.
"Slytherin has a party every time we win, so let's do this!" Mark whooped while Patrick was right behind him, leading the rest of Slytherin to their common room.
"That is all," He sneered at her and broke the eye contact first which made her smirk and him growl when he figured out her game. "Tomorrow I shall have out your schedules. Have a pleasant slumber," And with that, he left. Merry was giggling and shaking, Harry looked at her worriedly.
"Yeah, she did!" Millicent agreed. "No idea why though," She grumbled into her food. Merry thought of the reasons that she could be depressed. Stress? No Harriet always is on top of her school work. Quidditch? Can't be, she always wins! Maybe it's something she is not telling them. Wait...
Flint shrugged, "Malfoy usually gloats about his father, the girls do girl things and the guys eat and talk about quidditch."
"I just wanted to make sure that you know that I will step down if you really want the seeker position," She explained.
"Merry, I'm so scared!" Harriet whined, they were getting ready for the Christmas party at Malfoy's. They were arriving a day earlier to hang out with Draco and help Harriet get more acquainted with the manor.
"Do you want to go to breakfast with us?" Merry asked and didn't get a response. "We are going to go, just text me if you need anything." The girls all left saying goodbye and feel better to Harriet. Harriet just curled up even more and tried not to cry for no reason in particular.
"You will do perfectly fine in Hogwarts," He smiled. She finished the last bite of her egg roll and gave a piece chicken to Beetlejuice. He hissed at the feeling of a full stomach, he hasn't been full in a month. Harry was afraid to let him slip out of her cupboard to eat in case he never came back. She drank the other two vials which would make her gain weight easier in the future and not be lacking vitamins.
"Yes Harriet it is a required class," Merry rolled her eyes. They were walking to their flying lesson and Harriet hates being in the air after traumatic experiences when she was a just a kid. She had a lot of reasons to hate being in the air like once she floated in the air for 30 minutes when she was only months old, she screamed and screamed and no one came to check on her. Another time when she was 5, she was running away from Dudley because he was hurting her and she somehow ended up on the roof of the school. She still has nightmares of the beating that happened after that.
"I- I had a nightmare," Harriet whimpered, why wasn't she running to hug her? Why wasn't she kissing her cheeks like Dudley's? Why wasn't her Uncle reading her a story to calm her down?
"No he's not, he is just making conversation," Harry frowned. Merry laughed and shook her head. Harry continued to frown, why would he even want to impress her? The bell rang which made the cat snarl lightly because there obviously was some students missing. Words appeared on the chalkboard, 'Read the first chapter and take notes on the most important key points.' Everyone opened their book and started to read silently. Harriet took out her already pre-made notes on the chapter and sat quietly. She avoided looking at the Professor knowing she was looking at her questioningly. Merry was reading it quietly to herself trying to figure out what she was reading. She was frowning and looking severely lost. Harriet stole her parchment paper and wrote a few notes that would help her understand the chapter. When Merry got the parchment back, she read it and nodded. She mouthed the words thank you to Harry which she just mouthed back no problem. As the rest of the class was reading the chapter, some kids came through the door, 8 minutes late.
"Harriet!" Both Cedric and Merry yelled and followed her. Hermione was on the floor under the sinks, or what was sinks, dodging the troll's stick which was accidentally smashing things. Cedric jumped in front of Harriet and held up his wand. The troll looked at him confused.
"It is fascinating!" Harry defended herself. She pulled out her phone, 10 minutes till the bell rang. "Hey Merry, we only have 10 minutes."
"I'm Merry's mother, Cara Baxter," Cara blushed and shook his hand. Mr. Feose kissed her hand which made both of them blush even deeper.
"Seems like nothing in there should be a problem," He smiled and closed his own medicine box which was a pretty red color. "I think it's nothing to worry about," Which made the other girls still watching in the room sigh in relief, "But I do want you to rest today and maybe even tomorrow just in case. I'm sure your friends can grab your homework assignments." He smiled at the other girls who all smiled back. Harriet looked at them, not really feeling the need to smile. She sunk more into her bed which was very soft and sunk in.
"May I go take out the trash and shower? Harry asked her Aunt who was out in the garden planting flowers. Aunt Petunia just scowled at her but nodded. Harry went into her trunk which she had to unshrink to get her clothes and grabbed an outfit. She had about an hour to get to Kings Cross. She ran upstairs and ripped off her clothes. She washed and healed her hands with magic because she used chemicals in the kitchen for 4 hours. Her hands did end up bleeding and split open from the chemicals her Aunt insisted on using to clean the kitchen. She showered quickly and got dressed in her new outfit which was a white long sleeved blouse, a teal ribbon that went under her collar, a black skirt that ended at her mid thigh, black knee high socks, and black converses. Merry convinced her to wear this for her first day. They talked all of the time throughout the last month. They found a lot about each other like Merry was deadly afraid of spiders and Harry loves animals. Harry could talk to Merry a lot because she was in her locked cupboard all summer. Harry brushed her teeth and hair. Merry had promised her that she would do her makeup and hair on the train for her. Harry ran downstairs and threw all of her old clothes away, most of them were ripped and dirty anyway. She also threw away all of her broken parts of toys that she got from Dudley or rather got from the trash. She never had real toys, she only got them from Dudley's broken ones that she was never supposed to have in the first place. Harry did her bed for the last time and grabbed her trunk and put it in her pocket. She let Beetlejuice wrap around her arm and grabbed the trash. She looked out back, her Aunt had her back turned and still doing the flowers. Harry smirked and ran out the front door. She threw the trash bag in the can outside and ran to Mr. Feose. She let the wind ruin her hair and let tears fall. She never felt so alive and free. She was finally going to be free, no more beatings or starving. No more crying herself to sleep, no more abuse or neglect. She. was. free. Harry cried her whole way to the shop, she was crying because she was finally truly happy. She was going to go to Hogwarts and be the best witch ever know. She was going to have friends. She was going to learn until her head exploded. She was going to be happy. Harry threw open the doors to Mr. Feose shop.
"Have any of you seen a toad, Neville here lost his," The bushy haired girl said to reveal her bucked teeth.
"Probably 500" Draco sneered. It was very obvious that they all hated him. Why though? Maybe because of their parents. Most of theirs are known to be Dark.
"Good Morning Hogwart Students!" Professor Hooch shouted which made Harriet flinch. She really hates loud and sudden noises. "It looks like we have everyone," She skimmed the list and took roll call quickly. She then explained some rules about flying and with every word her stomach dropped.
"I don't know," Harriet whispered back. The whole class looked at her wondering what she could have done. Harriet got up and turned to the young man.
"May I use the restroom?" Harry asked her Aunt. She just glared at her and nodded while trying to talk to her husband which was not working at all. Harry walked upstairs and went into the bathroom. She locked the door and quickly opened her letter.  She read it very quickly smiling very wide with tears in her eyes. She frowned at the recommended course books, she already has read them to the point where she could reread the books back and forth. She wondered how she was going to reply but a smirk slowly appeared on her face. Harry couldn't send the letter from Mr. Feose shop because she had a good guess that the letters were tracked to see where they came from. She and Mr. Feose would get into a lot of trouble with the Ministry because no one was supposed to tell her about her magic or anything until she got her letter. She shoved the letter back in her back pocket and walked out the bathroom still smirking.
"Cause..." Harriet mumbled, she rubbed her eyes. Merry sensed that she didn't want to share but there is definitely a horrid story behind this.
"The day we celebrate the slaughter of witches," Pansy hissed in disgust. Hogwarts once didn't celebrate Halloween because back in the 80's or so, a Ravenclaw brought up that Halloween was once a day where Muggles killed and made fun of witches. But a Hufflepuff boy did not get the memo and still dressed up, which everyone once had to. And that ended the whole debate, so now Hogwarts still celebrates but people can choose to not celebrate.
"I am getting one later," Harry explained. Mr. Feose promised to get Harry a snake for her birthday. Merry was still getting licked by her kitten and giggling.
"What are you doing?!" She yelled at Harriet who was still curled up against the opposite wall. She pushed back into the wall, she didn't like when people yelled. Loud noises are really scary.
"Oh good morning, young ones," The delicate man said which scared Snape. His surprised look was quickly replaced with a sneer.
"Hello Hermione, can I call you that?" Hermione nodded. "What do you think your favorite class is going to be?" Harriet asked trying to make conversation.
"Dumbledore," She sniffed, now she knew why the others were so distant towards the older man, he doesn't seem like someone you want to trust. Harriet held out her arms, she really has a hard time hugging people but she trust Malfoy, he is really nice to her and always talks to her. He never treats her different due to her being a half-blood. He smiled and hugged her tightly.
As Draco passed out the gifts, Merry leaned over to her, "The youngest always passes out the presents. Even though you are the youngest, Draco still gets so proud to pass out the presents every year." Harriet chuckled lightly and thanked Draco for handing her one. She looked at it oddly, it was a bit large almost the size of her torso, even though that is not saying much. She didn't have enough time to look at the tag due to Draco handing her another gift, this one a lot heavier. She gained a few more presents, smaller this time. She looked at the several presents quite confused, she never expected to get this many gifts. Merry leaned up against the couch and just watched the tree glisten and the ornaments twirl around. The whole manor seemed bursting with Christmas spirit, everything was glittering and alive. Too bad darkness will fill the manor tonight. The doorbell rang and there was a distant loud pop of a house elf opening the door but Draco got up running, seeing Merry get up also, Harriet followed close behind her. Harriet turned the corner right on time to see Draco hugging Severus tightly while Riley brushed Severus off with his gloves.
"I think I can do this," Harriet puffed out her chest confidently, she never feels this feeling very often. She feels it when Mr. Feose told her that she did well on her potion. Now she feels this feeling even before she had done the task. Merry patted her back and walked her over to the others.
"My name is Malfoy, Draco Malfoy," The blond boy to her left said. He offered his hand to shake so she put her fork down and wiped her face with her napkin.
"Are you packing for a mid-day feast?" Merry joked. Harriet looked down slowly at her collection of food. She frowned, she didn't have to pack up food anymore. She could eat whenever she wanted. She never had to starve and wonder if she would ever be able to eat again. Harry swallowed to lump forming in her throat and quickly shoved the fruit in her bag.
"I'm sorry, Aunt. I will put it in the refrigerator for someone other than me to eat later," Harry apologized as she hung her head. Aunt Petunia nodded and gave Uncle Vernon a kiss on the cheek as she left. Harry put the extras away and cleaned the kitchen as her Uncle ate silently. After he finished, she cleaned his plate.
"This morning, in class and everyone laughed at her," Merry looked at her friend oddly, never wishing to see her angry.
"I think he still cares for them though," Harriet spoke up, before the others could object she continued, "Think about it, he warned everyone that the party was ending. If he didn't, wouldn't everyone have gotten in a lot of trouble?" Both Merry and Draco were quiet, they stared nowhere in thought.
"My parents will also be nice to you, they will honestly love you as their own. Their political views will not affect that. Don't worry about it, I have a plan."
"Thank you for taking time out of your schedule to help me," She smiled up at him which made him ruffle her hair. She giggled loudly at his huge hand making a huge mess out of her hair.
"I better get going," She sighed while rubbing the back of her head. Today was the day she got to go to Hogwarts, her Aunt tried to keep her from going but she would, oh yes she would go. Harry got up and pushed open the door slowly. She went to go clean until her hands bled.
"You also are the top bank owner, you have the most money in the Wizarding World with your combined bank accounts," The goblin explained.
"You really know your animals huh?" She giggled. The woman unlocked the cage. When the cage unlocked the kitten immediately jumped out of her cage and started to lick Merry everywhere on her face. Merry giggled and tried to tame the young kitten.
"Hey Harriet!" Pansy yelled, ruining the moment which made Draco sneer. "What movie do you want to watch?" She was flipping through Netflix, not even looking at them.
"Alright, we can go," Harriet got up, not looking at Merry. Betray stung throughout her body, her temples were pounding. 'Calm down, calm down, calm down, you are probably just over thinking like usual.' She told herself. They walked down to the Great Hall for breakfast, the walk was quiet even though Merry tried to make small talk but failed due to Harriet's mind still on the thought of betrayed. They sat down by their other friends, Harriet seemed very distant at breakfast, everyone tried to pull her into a conversation but failed. Harriet played with her food, not really feeling like talking anymore.
"You look nicer with a shorter skirt," Merry smirked. Harry snorted and put away her other outfit. Beetlejuice slept the whole way to Hogwarts and Willow was still attacking her dragon in her cage.
"Don't make me throw some at you too," She threatened jokingly while holding up a spoonful of potatoes. Harry held up her hands surrendering. "Good girl," She smirked.
"We have to go get our wands, a pet, and books of course," Harry said while playing with her new phone, she never has even seen one. She jumped as her phone made a noise which made Merry laugh.
"That is not even the worst part," Mr. Feose said while taking a shot of God knows what. "The Wizarding World doesn't even know about this."
"Next wardrobe," She said excitedly. She was going to have clothes that actually belonged to her and weren't hand-me downs. She went into a shop which had lots of witches and dresses in the window. There was both wizarding clothing and Muggle clothing in the store. There was an older, snobbish looking witch at the counter who was on the phone arguing with someone. She had her hair everywhere and her makeup was terrible. The women in the store wore tight clothing to show off their bodies. Harry was about to leave when the lady up front got off the phone.
"It was good, he really just wanted to see what I could do," Harriet sighed and threw herself on her fluffy bed.
The next morning, Harriet made breakfast for her family. She wanted them to know that she cared for them. She was only insulted and smacked upside the head with a frying pan because she burnt a few things. She also was pushed down multiple times that day by her cousin. Every insult became less and less harsh throughout her life, 'freak' by her family, 'bitch' from Dudley's friends, 'weirdo' from the other kids in school, and even 'loser' from a few girls who sometimes would pour their lunches onto her. The only ones who would ever talk nicely about her would be her teachers, saying how hard working she is, how kind she is. How brilliant she is, how independent she is, how she can solve problems so quickly and by herself. Harriet soon put all of her effort into her studies, since it was the only thing she was praised on, her family hated her cooking and drawing so she put all of her work into her grades. It was the only thing she could do to find at least one sentence of praise and she learned so much in the process, she also learned cooking and drawing tips so she can impress her family with it.
She heard Flint swear a lot of curse words loudly which would have made her giggle if she was not about to die. The crowd gasped loudly again, Harriet awkwardly flung her other hand onto the broom and kicked her way onto her broom again. Her head was pounding and face bright red. She gulped down air a few times and looked for the snitch again. She found it easily and took off again. The other seeker came up beside her and keep swinging his arm towards her, she kept avoiding it, not wanting a fight just the snitch. The snitch went in a 90 degree downwards so she did the same. The seeker took her lead, she kept falling while he pulled up before her being afraid of faceplanting in the grass. She pulled up, the snitch at the tip of her broom so she stuck her hand out. It was out of reach.
"Heir Malfoy, it is a pleasure to meet you. I am Harriet Potter," She shook his hand. He puffed out his chest proudly at her calling him Heir. Zabini snorted while Nott snickered.
"Blood please!" He screamed and grabbed her hand. He carefully poked her finger with a sharp quill until it bled.  He smeared her bloody finger on the parchment.
"I am Gemma Farley, Head Girl, and this is Jason Zang, Head Boy," The boy just seemed to growl at the first years. The girl seemed nice enough to Harry. "We will be showing you to your dorms and home for the next 7 years." With that the prefects and Slytherin first years left to go to the dungeons. The first year Slytherins walked out of the Great Hall first with Harry in the back. Merry and Draco were on both sides of her and both trying to get her attention. They would both say look and point to something at the same time. The paintings were moving and talking! The stairs were moving also! Why is this place so weird? But like in a good way, in the way that made Harry want to learn more about this place and all of its secrets it may hold. The more beautiful the place, the darker the secrets.
Harriet stumbled out of her little room, her feet tripping in her big pajama pants. She had a nightmare about some lady with red hair and a really loud noise which scared her awake. Dudley and her were starting daycare the next day, she was really excited to meet all the new kids. Maybe they would be nicer to her than Dudley who always tends to push her. But she likes looking at his teddy bear with different colored eyes so she doesn't mind.
"I usually drank warm milk or hot chocolate to tire me out. I had a lot of sleeping problems after I was pregnant with Draco, he was-" She sighed and shook her head lightly while smiling lovingly at the memory, "Restless for his young age."
"Well what is going to happen to the troll when they find it, they aren't violent," Harriet spoke up concerned.
"Yes, you can. You can live on your own when you reach of age which is 18," He explained with a raised eyebrow. She was shaking in her seat, she can finally get away from the Dursleys'!
"Life will go on, worse things will come along. You will think probably in 10 years this nervousness was nothing," Merry rubbed her back comfortingly.
"Professor may I have Flint for a moment?" There was a noise meaning that someone was getting up. The older, way taller, student stepped out and looked at her with a blank expression.
"Really?" Harriet laughed, she liked flying it was like for once she could be free. It was like she didn't have to be the girl who lived nor the girl who always has nightmares. She could just be herself. It was the same exact feeling she had when she left the Dursleys and she always wanted to remember that moment.
"Four to a boat!" The large man ordered. The girls all stepped into the boat trying not to tip it over. Harry almost fell into the water laughing because Merry was trying to clean off the seat of the boat.
"You scared me!" Harry pushed her aside and made their way to their compartment again. They had 5 minutes until they were at Hogwarts. Merry shortened her skirt and Harry's.
"I'm going to take a shower," Harriet mumbled and grabbed some pyjamas and Beetlejuice. The girls all watched her go until Merry realized what she was doing and went to shower herself. Merry locked the door behind them.
"It really was," Harriet agreed. She packed a few muffins wrapped in a few napkins and also grabbed some fruit.
"Here let Dobby get your blanket," Draco puffed out his chest, he seemed to like informing out orders. "Dobby!" A small creature came running out of almost nowhere, he was dressed in what looked like a dirty, used cloth. When he ran, his large ears flopped around.
"Take Harriet's blanket up to my room," He ordered out. Dobby looked at her scar a bit in confusion, Harriet gently hands it to him. She felt super bad when he held it, it was as big as him.
"I think Draco is really pretty," Harriet giggled, Draco smiled back at her. He loves when she laughs, he hopes he never has to see such a pure and kind person get hurt in their entire life. Even if others want her hurt, he will be there protecting her from everything.
"Maybe it's how I grew up," Harriet always loved to question everything. But maybe that led to her trust issues, she questions news to people. Nothing in her mind was unbiased or non-corrupt, the world was terribly corrupt just like her life at the Dursleys.
"That's the best part of it, you don't have to say anything to bond. You can get to know others by listening to them," Merry explained.
"Well I want to bond but I really haven't seen any cute boys," She frowned and pulled her knees to her chest.
"She just seemed tired Draco, she just needs rest," Pansy hissed at him for thinking she is on the verge of death.
"Woah, are you okay?" A deep voice chuckled. Harry looked up to see a handsome, tall male student. He had a chiseled face and sparkling gray eyes with perfect white teeth.
She had a bruise on her face for weeks the time she accidentally called Petunia 'Mom', because how dare a spectacled small girl call her 'Mom'. She was only a freak. Nothing else. She was 5 at that time. She was 6 when her Aunt told her how her parents died, and how she burned or got rid of their belongings. She was 6 when her Uncle put a lock on her cupboard because she tried to sleep with them like Dudley did when he had a nightmare. She was 7 when she found out her real name, she honestly thought her real name was freak since her family never called her anything other than that. She was 9 when she thought about running away, but she was too scared, she never had an courage. She was 10 when she became so bored with her everyday life, she wanted to change it but had no idea. She wanted to feel something but she couldn't explain what she wanted to feel, possibly happiness or passion. She never knew though. She didn't quite understand those feelings to begin with.
Over the years Mr. Feose taught her more and more. She never could get enough. Mr. Feose never took her to the Wizarding World because he didn't have permission from the Ministry. Harry thought that was fine though she was thankful to learn from the books. She knew that she was ready for anything the Wizarding World could throw at her.
"First years and second years are forbidden to be out after 9:00 pm, except for emergencies and classes. Trust me if you break these rules, you will regret it," His voice deepened and glared at each first year student. He seemed to glare at her the most, she just smiled at him kindly. From a young age, Harry was always told that her smile could make even the most brutal winters turn into the most beautiful, blossoming spring. His glare and frown altered at her bright, innocent smile which made Harry smirk. He snarled at her and said, "Trust me, I will know if you break any of these rules," He said to the room but did not make his glare leave her. Harry did not let her innocent act falter at his glare, she stared straight into his black eyes that could make anyone fall into fear caused by them and smiled at him. She smiled straight into someone who was trying to make her scared and submissive. She has spent so many years being scared and submissive, she refused to let herself continue that way here. This was her chance to really be someone.
"Really?" Harry was surprised at the random kindness of her housemates. They already knew where their classes were but the others couldn't find out.
"What's up?" She looked worried and sat back down by her. "Are you alright?" She placed her hand on her forehead.
Merry came in first with Draco trailing behind her like a puppy, "Sorry it took so long. Yaxley wouldn't shut up about his latest investment." Merry snorted while Draco rolled his eyes.
"What are you doing?" Aunt Petunia screeched. Harry looked at her confused, she used the supper plates, she cooked what they wanted. What did she do wrong?
"Well we aren't getting any younger," She giggled then sprinted up some stairs. Harry laughed and ran up to catch her. They laughed together as they ran through stairs and corridors. Stopping at every classroom to see what they may hold. Many held abandon books which Harry took one of each and other random school supplies. Soon they were on the 8th floor, they figured out where all of their classes would be held and even future ones. They left the library for tomorrow during the school time and the 3rd floor for a later time. It was already 6 in the morning, so they had to run back to not get caught. Luckily no one came across the two girls the whole night but at one point they thought they heard Cedric's voice.
"Good morning. Name?" He pulled out some paperwork at looked down at her again when she didn't say anything.
"First day here and he already has a girlfriend," Ron whispered to Dean who hollered with laughter. Seamus blushed even heavier with the boys' comment and stared at his new feather. Neville frowned slightly and sunk more into his chair. Harriet raised an eyebrow, not knowing what Ron said. Hermione glared the boys for making a lot of noise and then continued to watch her floating feather. Harriet ended up helping each of the boys perfect their spells by the end of the class. After the bell rang Merry ran up to her.
"We are waiting for our friends, sir," Harry said politely. He continued to sneer at her while the more kind man smiled at them. He placed his hand on Snape's lower back which made his sneer disappear.
Madam Hooch explained some rules which the teams seemed to ignore because of the glaring. Harriet decided this was going to be a bloodbath. The whistle blew, everyone immediately flew. Harriet went off to the side to watch for a bit, wanting to see how a real game worked. After a handful of several minutes, Slytherin was winning 70-50. Some were already bleeding and clashing together. Flint seemed to knock others down in seconds and passed the ball to Pucey, Pucey scored cause he was the fastest and Derek was behind him as a backup and body slammed others out of the way. Mark and Patrick were flinging bludgers every which way, the beaters on Gryffindor were never hitting towards her which was good. Daisy missed a few but she was overall good, she seemed to have the hardest job, blocking items going so fast it could break a bone if it even brushed past you. Harriet looked around for the snitch, she saw it over by the Ravenclaws. She looked over at the Gryffindor seeker, he seemed so clueless and frustrated. Once she took off after it, he would come after her.
"Scotland-y," Mr. Feose slapped his upside the head teasingly. After saying a few quick goodbyes, Slick went back into the fireplace to leave. Harry and Mr. Feose went to the living room in the back to eat. Harry ate her sweet and sour chicken and 2 egg rolls while Mr. Feose ate his pot stickers and fried rice. Mr. Feose talked about a wild story that involved the most poisonous snake known to the world, a toilet plunger, and a group of human eating chickens. Harry excused herself for a moment to grab the bag of ice he forgot on the counter. The rest of the day is filled with brewing potions and Mr. Feose telling the weirdest stories. They ate pizza for lunch and again before Harry had to leave at 4:30. She always had to be home before 5:00 or her Aunt will hit her till bones break. She quickly thanked Mr. Feose and ran home. She burst through the door and slammed it shut. Her magic sensed that no one was home so she threw her bag in her cupboard and started supper. She started to cook when her Aunt came home with some grocery bags. Her Aunt didn't even acknowledge her, she just set the bags down and went upstairs. Harry put all of the groceries away and continued cooking. Her uncle came home while she just finished cooking. She set the table while he turned on the T.V. Her Aunt came down as she served dinner for both of them because Dudley was staying at Piers.
"Oh then I will come back after I go to Gringotts," Harry said excitedly. Harry loves to read no matter what the book may be. They said goodbye then Harry left to find Gringotts. She walked for awhile in a crowded street with more adults than kids. She soon found a tall white marble building that loomed over the street. Harry walked in to see people scattered at different counters either looking bored or frustrated and the goblins looking the same. She walked up to one who didn't seem busy.
"I'm Zabini, but you delicious darling can call me Blaise," He winked at her. Merry threw a piece of chicken at him which missed him.
"We didn't want the troll to die because we are aware of what happens to the trolls that are caught," Harriet explained.
'Oh yes," The old man's eyes sparkled, he had an overall youthful aura around him despite his age. He also seemed to like brightly colored robes, "I'm Professor Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts."
"Thank you," She smiled and took one. She gently put it in her mouth and almost jumped at the sweetness. Dumbledore also popped one in his mouth, "Why did you call me up here sir?"
Also, I have a question would you guys like either a short chapter every 3-4 days (about) or a long chapter every 1 and a half - 2 weeks (about)? Or does it not matter?
"Do you want to see?" Merry asked. Harry nodded so Merry took a picture of the back of her hair. She gasped at seeing her hair so fancy because she was used to it being a rats nest. Merry showed her makeup also which made Harry blush. She looked so pretty! Harry was about to say something when a knock came from the door. It was thrown open to reveal a bushy haired girl and a chubby round faced boy.
Heir of: House of Potter, House of Gryffindor, House of Slytherin, House of Hufflepuff, House of Black, House of Ravenclaw, House of Peverall, House of Prince, House of Woods, House of Riddle
"You don't know that! What if they hate me and refuse for me to be friends with Draco? What if they kick me out of Slytherin because I'm weird to them? What if they kick me out of Hogwarts because they don't see me worthy to even be a witch? What if-?!" Harriet rambled on in fear.
Her scar burned brightly in pain, "No," Her jaw clenched in pain, "Just how my parents died and who gave me my scar." Draco and Merry both flinched. "Why do you flinch every time I mention Riddle or Voldem-"
"What is wrong with this school?" Merry whispered in her ear. Harriet bit her fist while trying to not laugh. The teacher, Mr. Binns, had a very monotone voice and seemed like he was completely uninterested by the topic. Hermione was quickly scribbling down notes which made her receive multiple glares from the other Gryffindors. Neville looked downright confused and completely lost. Merry was sleeping on her desk when the class was only 10 minutes in. Harriet followed along in the prepared notes and annotated chapter. The class seemed to fly by for Harriet, Merry almost fell off her desk when the bell blasted loudly.
"Harry!" Merry shouted and motioned them to come towards her and her mother. Harry ran to her and jumped into her open arms.
Harriet would always compliment her and smile brightly at her. Merry would always feel more confident after she complimented her. Also Merry would calm her down after her nightmares. They would talk about the nightmare while eating some sweets to calm her down. Merry sighed and walked back to the dining hall for lunch. She walked to her friends and sat down.
"He will definitely get the position, he is an amazing Quidditch player and spectacular at his studies," Harriet said confidently. Draco blushed deeply at Harriet's confidence in his abilities.
"Really now?" Harry whined. Merry just smirked and started to work on her face. She put on some blush and concealer under Harry's eyes. Merry put on mascara and eyeliner next which made Harry move around and giggle a lot. She put lip liner, lipstick, and gloss only on the middle of Harry's lips. She also filled in her eyebrows a bit.
"It's an eyeshadow palette, I can teach you how to use it. I thought I could finally test you how to do makeup since you always seem so fascinated by how I do it," Merry smiled, Harriet smiled back generously.
"Like last week for a migraine," She shuttered at the memory, migraines are terrible. It felt like your brain just exploded.
"You are a very intelligent girl despite not growing up in the Wizarding world and you are tremendously sweet and supportive. Draco could use a friend like you who always supports him yet will keep him out of trouble or doing something wrong."
"What's wrong?" Merry looked over at her with her eyes blown wide. Harriet stuttered while blushing heavily.
"Yeah, that's a better idea!" Harriet agreed, she really wanted to see the whomping willow. So for a few hours, the group of Slytherins explored until their feet ached and the temperature began to drop.
"Neither do I," Merry laughed and also swung her leg over her broom. Harriet jumped and crossed her legs around the broom trying to hold on. She stayed in the air and kicking her legs back and forth happily.
"Wingardium Leviosa," She said and flicked her wand. The feather lifted up slowly and twirled around a bit.
"He must be a prefect, they help patrol the school," Merry explained as they quickly ran back to the dungeons. Harry just wondered what Cedric would have thought about them breaking the rules on their very first night. They ran to their common room door, Merry almost missed it which made Harry laugh. Harry said the password and they quickly made their way to their dorm. They slipped in unnoticed and quickly put away their robes and wands.
"Because the chasers could have done more goals, the keeper could have blocked some more, and the beaters could have also hit more bludgers," Patrick explained more in detail.
"Only you, only you," Dean chuckled. She was still quite confused but she shook her head like she was shaking away the confusion. She took her sleeve and started to clean off Seamus's face. Seamus blushed as red as Ron's hair as she cleaned his face off.
"Harriet," Someone behind her whispered. She turned around to see Blaise looking at her with his eyes wide and sighing while shaking his head. She held back a giggle when she found out why he was acting the way he was. Draco was ranting on and on about how his father taught him everything to know about transfiguration.
"Because of the law that passed like 10 years ago." Harry finished for Merry. Merry's mother nodded as if remembering the day it happened. They all finished their ice cream and went to a shop which was filled with Muggle stuff. Merry went to the smart phones and started to show Harry which ones were the best. In the end, Harry got an iPhone 6 which was gold, two Muggle cameras, one Polaroid and the other digital, a laptop where she could draw on a little slab and it would be on the computer, and a phone case where you can use the slab to draw on to design the phone case. Both Harry and Merry bought a lot of earbuds because Merry always broke them and Harry knew she was going to lose them. Merry gave Harry her number right away. Harry was ecstatic, she had her first friend! Merry's mother left to buy the girls their main school supplies.
"Damn you're fast!" Merry shouted louder after Harriet. Harriet chuckled then dropped 50 feet and only managed to swope back up at 3 feet.
"Can you list off all of the families in the Sacred Twenty Eight?" Harriet was scared and curious about his answer.
"Oh! Then continue, continue!" Harriet jumped up and down, she wants to bond. The girls all giggled at her excitement.
"Seriously, I heard someone died in this class while listening to him talk about the Goblin Wars for hours," Merry said exaggerated.
"You can set your stuff down, just act like it's your own room," Harriet just grabbed a book from his bookshelf and looked at him. He snorted at her blunt humor, "You can read it."
Harriet cuddled more into Merry tired, this was a very long day for her. So many emotions and excitement in one day, "Draco just let them believe in what they believe," Merry sighed.
"Maybe next time, one of you can transform the other into a pocket watch. That way you won't be late, don't let it not happen again," She said firmly and turned around to walk back to her desk to sit down after the boys nodded. The boys sighed and all sat down in the back. McGonagall gave 5 more minutes to read the chapter to let the boys catch up but they decided to talk in the back. Hermione looked back in disgust at the boys which made Harry laugh silently. They started the lesson which was turning a match into a needle. Harry always have a hard time with this subject, she could never do it on purpose or when she wanted to, only ever on accident. Merry almost poked her eye out with the match and her wand somehow but in the end did get the needle. Neville couldn't even do anything to the match. Hermione got it on the 3rd try. Millicent somehow made the needle bright green. Draco made the needle but it did not look like a needle. Blaise... he didn't even try, he was just poking the match with the tip of his wand. Harriet set the match on fire which she stared at blankly until it somehow made the match a shiny gray, pointy needle.
"I guess you are and I hope you will continue to be surprising," They took off after his last words.
"I know this is a lot," Harry snorted at that, "But how about I give you some books about Hogwarts and politics in the Wizarding World to make more sense than I explained," Mr. Feose suggested. Harry gladly took the books and went back to her house after thanking Mr. Feose and saying goodbye. She read all throughout the night until morning.
"I was wondering if your friend here really did challenge Snape when he was going through the rules, is that alright kid?" He sneered the kid part. Merry puffed out her chest and pouted. Before she could say anything Harry interrupted quickly.
Narcissa chuckled to herself a bit, "No not really, I always find it difficult to fall asleep the night before Christmas. Both Lucius and Draco could always fall asleep instantly, that's why Draco and my husband are always awake at the crack of dawn on Christmas."
"I have a hard time remembering stuff like directions, plus this place holds so many secrets. I really want to know all of them," Harry explained.
"I want the students to not see me as a Professor who judges their abilities but as someone, they can always come for advice or just plain old talking to. I want to help build the student, not judge them. Plus I'm quite young, I don't want to be compared to the old fuddy-duddy Professors here," He winked and chuckled. Hermione was about to say something about disrespect but he beat her to it. "I'm just joking Granger." She nodded and lead the boys out.
"Harriet!" She heard someone scream. She looked up to see a bludger coming at her, she dropped a few feet so it glided over her. Harriet continues to go after the snitch, the bludgers coming at her started to add up. Flint was screaming at Mark and Patrick to actually do their job. She stopped to catch her breath way up in the air while the other seeker lost the snitch. Sweat was dripping down her face from all of the maneuverings she had to do in order to not get hit by the bludgers. It seemed like even the Gryffindor beaters were trying to keep them away from her. The crowd was filling with murmurs of confusion. She spotted the snitch again, she pushed the tip of her broom down to go forward.
"Damn that really does work," She chuckled. They went to shower and got dressed. Beetlejuice showered with Harry, he slithered in the water by her feet. After they were done, it was just before 7 so they grabbed their school supplies and books. Beetlejuice went along with her under her blouse. Harry grabbed the 7th year potion book that she found in an empty classroom. They sat in the common room, waiting for the rest of the girls. The fireplace was going strong, filling the room with warm heat. They sank down on a fluffy couch while Merry played on her phone and Harry read the potion book. They sat in comfortable silence until a door quietly creaked open. The girls turned around to see a very relaxed looking Snape. Behind him was a shorter man with short curly, light brown hair that was longer on top. He had deep cheekbones but yet a delicate, feminine face. He had large red eyes with very long eyelashes. But not scary red eyes, like fresh cherries, just lightly frosted over with morning frost. He looked very delicate and feminine all over but something about him looked strong. Harry couldn't figure out what though.
Merry chuckled, "He won't object to that." Draco punched her in the arm lightly which made the three of them laugh. Harriet skips closer to him and grabbed his arm to hold hands. He opened his door lightly, leading the girls into his room. His room looks even larger as their whole common room, maybe even bigger! There were light gray walls with a roaring fireplace, a gray couch, and a few matching armchairs. There was a huge bed with silky white curtains over it, sun shown through his curtains so the room looked golden and alive. There also was a desk with potions and huge bookshelves that cover almost an entire wall which really interests Harriet. There also was a large Slytherin banner, a huge closet of designer wardrobe. Harriet felt calm from the scent of the room, it smelled like his cologne and old books with broom wax.
"You're not denying it!" The boys both shouted and ran after him. The girls didn't stop laughing until Merry opened a compartment that was not empty.
"They cause destruction and can kill because they don't know what they are doing," Gemma shifted uncomfortably.
"Yeah, Quidditch seems interesting," Harriet smiled which made Pansy smile back. Harriet always seemed to have this effect on people. No matter what, she could always make them smile and feel better. Always love her, always stand by her side and want to protect her at all costs. She figured this would come handy in the future.
"Stop flirting! Come on!" Merry raced over to grab her broom, Harriet and Draco jumped up to race after her. After grabbing their brooms and equipment, they were on the field with Harriet wearing a bunch of layers since Draco and Merry didn't want her to get cold at all.
"Never thought that Potter: The Girl Who Lived, would ever be in Slytherin. Never thought you would also stand up to Snape on your first night," The first one who talked smirked.
After they got up, what seemed to be 5 sets of stairs, Draco informed Harriet about his house, "Be careful in this house, it's very easy to get lost. Sometimes every I can get turned around here."
"Of course they do but you hold such a kind nature that I have only seen in very few people," Narcissa clicked her nails on the table next to her in deep thought. Before Harriet could respond, Winky came back with a tray of two cups. Narcissa grabbed one delicately and gently sipped on it before setting it aside. Harriet thanked Winky and sipped mouth fulls of the sweet liquid. She couldn't really have sweets at the Dursleys, therefore, she never cared for the taste but Merry always offers her sweets and Hogwarts never runs out of desserts so she is starting to enjoy the sweetness.
"Thank you mother," His face growing red again. "Can we go eat now?" And that set out the rest of the day, they ate together as what seemed to be like a family. Lucius and Narcissa talked about some politics dealing with the Ministry while Draco and Merry argued about which Quidditch team was the best. Harriet focused more on the food and trying to get rid of the pressure behind her eyes, the food was amazing. She never got to eat any of the food that she cooked for the Dursleys on Christmas so it felt wonderful to finally be able to eat. Merry's mother came over after they finished eating with a few presents. Merry and Draco dragged her quickly to under the Christmas tree in the living room so they could open up presents quickly. The kids sat on the ground while the adults sat on the furniture. Narcissa joined her husband on the black love seat while Cara sat alone on a large seat by the fireplace.
"It's over 100, I know that," Harriet said softly. They hummed at her comment, not knowing how to continue this topic as they sat down. As they piled food on their plate, Harry looked around the room. Everyone seemed very lively and excited. She once again caught eyes with Flint. They continued to have what seemed to be a staring contest until Flint had to turn to his friend so their staring contest didn't get caught. She smirked because she won and started to eat. When she looked back at him, he was glaring slightly at her, knowing that he lost. She smiled kindly at him which seemed to startle him. He smiled back slightly which honestly looked like he was baring his teeth. She giggled and smiled brightly at him which made him shake his head and turn back to his plate.
"Coulter, Crabbe, and Goyle. Your parents are about to leave, I suggest you all leave soon. The party is ending soon. Merry Christmas," With that, he left with no more words. Adrian and Derek cursed but Marcus smacked them upside the head for cursing in front of the young students. The group all said their goodbyes right after, the older ones left in a hurry. Marcus patted her head and wished her a Merry Christmas. He handed her a small gift, she excitedly thanked him back but worried that she didn't have anything to give back. Marcus just chuckled it off and patted her head once more before leaving with Achilles who seemed to want more pets from Harriet. Daphne went into a hug and Harriet awkwardly hugged her back. Pansy gave her a large gift and said it was a few clothes to improve her fashion sense. But Harriet knew it was because Pansy became worried when she saw Harriet in worn out clothing.
"I'm not afraid or see them as bad, I'm just scared they will hate me because I'm stupid and weird!" Harriet leaned into Merry's calming touch, she tends to have these little mental breakdowns quite a bit. Harriet has absolutely no confidence in anything she does or anything she can do which causes her to always worry about how people think of her.
"I tipped the storage thing over so you didn't have to get yelled at for the 10th time this week," She explained and said a quick cleaning spell to clean her arm.
"Hello dear, are you here for your school supplies?" An older woman with round glasses asked. She flooed to Flourish and Blotts.
"Oh good morning, Riley and Professor Snape," One girl jumped when she saw the two professors and two first years.
"The boys need to come with us so we have a proper headcount," Gemma informed sadly, "You guys can have a movie night later." The guys all left the room with their head down and said goodbye. The girls all put the pillows and blanket back, not saying anything.
"Shut up freak!" He punched her in the stomach hard to make her collapse in pain. She barely could breathe as Piers spat on her and they left laughing 'witch'.
"Look at this precious kitten!" She cooed at a small gray kitten with one green eye and one brown eye. The kitten could fit in one hand and it meowed at the two girls. The kitten clawed at the cage and meowed sadly.
"A lot," Harriet made a wounded noise, "But usually the kids all go into a separate room and play games."
"Here is the- ah, Slick, where have you been?" Mr. Feose sets the ice down and claps him on the back.
"Are you scared of heights?" Pansy asked softly, she has grown a deep protectiveness feeling about the small girl.
"Draco!" Merry laughed at him staring at her underwear. His face flushed deep red and he fidgeted nervously while looking at the ground.
"Do you have any shampoo or body wash?" Merry took some bottles out of her trunk. Harry blushed and shook her head. She forgot to buy some in Diagon Alley. "I figured, I brought you some," She tossed a pink bottle and a clear blue bottle at her. Harry caught both easily, she had good reflexes from dodging Dudley's punches or throwing things at her.
Harriet looked up to see Narcissa rubbing her eyes tiredly and trying to quiet a yawn, "How did you sleep?"
"When did that happen?" Harriet shouted in anger, they flinched, never thinking of what she would look like anger due to her always being soft-spoken and gentle.
"Do you need something Harriet?" She asked while putting her book down to give Harriet her full attention. Harriet jumped a bit at the idea of her being concerned for her well being.
She wasn't sleeping that well though because of her and Merry's midnight adventures, they found all of the common rooms and are still trying to figure out the passwords. They haven't gone on the third floor yet because Merry admitted that she was a bit scared and Harriet didn't want to force her. She also was having nightmares and visions about the girls' bathroom which she really didn't understand. But overall she was really starting to like her Hogwarts' experience. She also was making quick friends with people in the other houses and her year. She absolutely loved Neville though, he is just so nice and quiet. She loves seeing him in Herbology when he doesn't seem scared or nervous. Her and Flint were still having their 'Staring contests' without actually saying anything to each other. Maybe in the future, they will finally get to talk.
"No 'cause I knew you would know it," She laughed. They made their way to the Great Hall and sat down at the end. Harriet ate a muffin and an apple which she packed from earlier. Merry ate some roast beef and potatoes which she threw most of the at Blaise for talking in French for too long. Harry started to take back to him in French, they talked about the weather and how they were making Merry so upset very quickly.
Harry laughed, "Yeah basically." The two of them walked around the dungeons, looking at every single corridor and painting. They both talked to everyone, most had never even talked to humans in years.
Learning was the only way she could feel happy, she felt so powerful and intelligent when she knew material years ahead of her. Learning put her ahead of all of the mean people around her, she could outsmart Dudley and his gang so she didn't get beaten up. She could confuse her Uncle so he wouldn't hit her. She could use her knowledge to get ahead of others, only to end up using her knowledge to help people. She wanted to change the world with her ideas, she didn't have the power though. Maybe one day she will. She will have the power to change how people are discriminated against for anything, their sexuality or simply how they grew up. Hatred is such an evil and sickening thing in the world, she never would hate anyone. That would defeat the purpose of what she wanted to change. She wanted to change how much hatred is in the world, she wants people to be happy and free. Something she is not. She wants others to be different, she never wants another child to face what she faced. She will make this happen, she will continue to learn until she could help others. She will continue to gain power, to gain knowledge in order to help the world around her. It takes only one person to change minds, she will be that person.
"Right," She smiled and started to eat some fruit. After they watching a few minutes of the movie, Merry asked a question.
"Harriet time to get up," Merry sang outside of her curtains on her bed. After she didn't respond, Merry said her name again and peeked through the curtains. Harriet groaned loudly and shoved her face into the pillow. "Are you alright?"
"You like that don't you? You bloody freak!" Piers shouted. Dudley turned her to face him and punched her under her right eye. She shouted again and fell to the ground. They both spit on her and went into class and shut the door as the final bell rang. Harry started to cry silently as she curled up in a ball on the ground. She stayed there for awhile until she stopped crying. She got up and went into the nearest girls bathroom. She walked in and checked to see if anyone else was there, no one was there. She went to the mirror to see a large bruise already starting to form. Harry stared at herself in the mirror. She had long, wavy raven hair with deep blue eyes that also had green near the pupil. She was very petite with no curves and barely made 4'6". She had very pale skin and plump pink lips. Also, she had the longest eyelashes she has ever seen. Harry didn't want to go back to class, during classes at the end of the year you only would watch movies or talk about the summer. Movies were boring to her because she wanted to read instead and the books were always better. She never had anything to talk about for plans in the summer but it didn't matter because no one never called on her. Plus she always envied that kids got to go on trips with their parents.
"So it's mostly families from the Sacred 28, you know what that is right?" Harriet hesitated, "So it's basically all the families who are truly pureblood, but knowing that a family is truly pureblood can be quite confusing because people can have affairs and divorces, marrying cousins, it's all very complicated. But the Sacred 28 are 28 wizarding families who are branded truly pureblood. So there are the ones you know Malfoys, obviously, Nott, Parkinson, Flint, Greengrass, and Bulstrode. Longbottom and Weasley are also purebloods and in the Sacred 28 but won't coming because they have other plans and don't get involved with dark wizards. Macmillan, Abbott, and Fawley are mostly a Hufflepuff family but they come to all pureblood events for political power. All the rest are mostly Slytherins-"
