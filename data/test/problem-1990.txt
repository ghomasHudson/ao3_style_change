“Yeah, shut up Ron.”
Not long afterwards Draco finds himself deeply ashamed of how quickly he did so, crying out, screaming uncontrollably as though being told what to do was what he had been waiting for all along. His unravelling is the final straw for Harry and he's gone, emptying his heart and hate and balls into Draco, pushing his face down by the back of the neck as he does, jerking out every last drop of desire with frantically stuttering hips.

lonely, Potter.” It's a lie of course, he's lonely most of the time, has been since he can remember, it just hasn't necessarily mattered for a very long time.
“So?”
“What?” He cannot believe he's hearing his own objection - “Draco it's not – you're not -” he wants to say that just five seconds ago he was on the verge of bursting into tears, but you can't say a thing like that – not to

Narcissa nods. She remembers the things Draco had once had to say about Hermione too. She also remembers catching sight of them talking the evening he and Harry apparated back from Malfoy Manor.
and stares at their names together like that on the paper for a long time, wondering how in the world he can actually turn back around and face him now.
“Will you fucking
“Inter-house bloody something anyway,” Ron nods.
When did he get so morbid? He's not even sad today, but it's a melancholy kind of happiness, being back, walking the path overlooking Hagrid's hut in the early morning light, pumpkins burgeoning bright orange against the fading green, footsteps crunchy in the frost and leaves and at the same time the sunlight, so bright it can only feel unnatural, so bright at the end of autumn it can only be Hogwarts. The gold and dazzle and broken dream of Hogwarts.
“Yeshermione.”
“No,” Narcissa agrees, no judgement in her voice - “You're not. Don't mind it.”
“Draco -”
“Maybe,” he nods. “Maybe,” and then to Ron who stops on his way out the shop to pick a gadget off the shelf - “And that's still ten galleons to you, mate.”

“You're not serious -”
“That -”
“You're going to then?”
They say something else, laughing, that he does not catch because he's riveted towards that stage – him, he supposes, and just about everyone else in the hall and he wishes desperately that he had not been so late down so he could have got closer to the front – although the front, as far as he can tell is mostly screaming first years who look like they might faint from excitement. The lighting widens and shifts and the colours of Draco beam out cross the room in prisms of light. The shiny black of the outfit conceals more rainbows than colour ever could and his hair shines silver, some trick of the light making it look as though there are tiny stars swirling out from him, drifting through the rainbows.
“Come in?” A sleepy voice sighs with very minimal enthusiasm. “Oh -” the boy frowns when she does, sat on the side of his bed in a dressing gown - “I thought it was mother – what do

He had meant it that he wanted to help. He knew Draco was hurt, that he'd been hurting for a long time and he had managed to fail to help him time and time again. Usually when he asked people how he could help them he got

“Come in,” she says, still frowning but standing aside to let Narcissa in, and ushering her into the long living room on the right, a pair of glass double doors at the end leading onto a stretch of bright garden pouring sunlight into the room.

sparring with Malfoy, be it duelling, fisticuffs or verbal always got him hard; he'll never forget how viciously and furiously he whacked off the night after getting thrown off the Quidditch team. He hadn't wanted to ever stop punching the git, and he hadn't wanted to stop at punching him. He's fancied the bastard since he first saw him get on a broom, the sheer exquisite elegance of him tracing a ladder to the stars. But then – then that same perfect poise made him
Harry looks at him sideways, suspecting that this is in fact Malfoy for being actually quite pleased to be invited and positively Looking Forward To It. The fact that Draco then stretches out across the sofa with his head in Harry's lap as he continues to grumble also confirms this theory.

The truth – one he does not know how it took him so long to work out– is that they're obsessed with each other and have been since first year; they have watched, stalked, orbited each other since the moment they met, always coming back to rest just as close together as they could. He thinks perhaps half the reason it was always so vicious between them was on account of them resisting that pull and now that they have given into it they crash together so hard and so often it leaves them both reeling.
It's been three days of lurking already, and he's honestly starting to wonder what the point is; he watches Draco's door like a hawk, he's seen how many times Harry just

“We're here.” The car pulls up to a white-fronted house with a red door, and she sits for a minute before getting out.
“Beautiful,” he says again, with a gentle kiss - “Come on – bed, and I'll give you those sodding reasons I love you, you arsehole.”
he'd been waiting his whole life. He rocks forward and can feel how hard Potter is under him, how fucking big he must be beneath his trousers, and he knows as he feels it that Potter must be feeling him too and one more rock will brush their cocks together and he'll probably fucking come just from that. His head falls back, eyes closed in bliss as he offers up his neck for the kissing. He doesn't even need to offer, it is taken anyway, hot lips on his throat and just the hint of teeth. He can hear his own breath coming out in gasps, echoing round the awful stone walls. He heard his own breathing here once before, just as loud but it was panicked then, like a frightened animal facing down death, and that was crazy when you thought about it, because wasn't he the one threatening death?

“Look -” he says suddenly, blurting it out stiffly and awkwardly - “I'm sorry about what happened to you – when you were at the manor. I – I would not have had that happen. Aunt Bella was a fucking nutter, and I – well like I say I'm -”
“It's a nightmare!”
not if the world was ending, take Harry Potter's hand if he offered it in friendship. Never.
Harry sounds on the verge of saying something else but in the next second Draco realises he has fallen asleep and with the moment and the memory and weight in his arms he realises the brush of the curtain in the wind is just the brush of the curtain in the wind and that there is nothing outside the door. Nothing lurks on the stairs or the landing, no ghosts by the bed or slithering in the hall and he's sleeping too, both of them cradled in the starlight spell of the song she spun.
“Played us,” Percy scratches his head ruefully.

not yet. Though I'd hang out with Krum any day.”
But then – right at the end, when he thinks he might have saved himself from tears –
He has not made it into the next corridor before it comes. He stops, he doesn't have to stop, why does he even stop? He should have just kept on going – but no. Stops. Breathes. Holds his face tight in one hand like it might fall off, like pressing that mask right on, digs his fingertips into his hair line and whips around.
even before Luna told me – so tell me now, if you did any of those things by choice, or if there's more, then tell me I don't know the worst.”
“Oh my -” Harry sighs, staring skyward as though in prayer - “It's so nice when the whole family get together for New Year. No Luna, Gin?”
“Really?” Draco stares - “Since when have you had
“I love you -” he says, kisses the words right into Draco's scar - “I love you, you're beautiful.”
“Sorry Gin,” he mutters, looking at the floor and squeezing Draco's hand like he could hold that hand in the squeeze of his heartbeat.
Harry bends down, kisses his forhead - “You save me every day.”
He never threw a punch before. It's like a lightning bolt hitting him, flooding him with shock and guilt and a fizzing kind of delight. Also – he shakes his hand, wincing -
Harry wonders when he cheered up quite so visibly. Possibly around the same time as yet another bottom had fallen out of his world. He wonders if Draco

“Maybe you could tell the court about that?”

She writes –
“Shut up Blaise. Pans, you clash with me, it just won't do.”

gesture with a half arsed right hand. He's perched on the left of the sofa. There's room for another person on the right of him; nobody would have dreamed of filling that space.
In a way, a way that is amusing when put up for closer inspection, this reminds him of all those incredibly dull Saturday afternoons as a small child being dragged around stately homes and galleries by Aunt Petunia. Alright, there was usually something worth seeing in the art galleries but the stately homes had been a travesty of a waste of an afternoon, worth anything only for getting him out of the cupboard for half a day.
“I know,” he says, because he does, he can recognise just about every one of Draco's nightmares by now, but Draco has to say it anyway, as though naming it is at least something he can do towards facing the fear -
he wanted to be The Chosen One – most of our year did, you know, and then he
“Piss off, Potter.”
Potter?”
It's cold, as cold as they have ever been. But it's an iciness that burns, it's been burning them for seven years. They head towards each other as though hauling themselves together by the rope that connects them, a rope they have always treated as a tug of war, trying to throw each ther over when they should have been pulling themselves along it towards each other.

“Happy New Year, you tossers!” Harry laughs, slinging an arm around Draco's shoulders who blushes, awkward but pleased.
“I'm clever. I think of things.”

There seems to be more of a thought half formed at the end, and for a minute George thinks he is going to go on, but he doesn't. They all do this now then, trail off from their ideas, half-baked and lost, ghosts in their own skin.

“But sometimes difficult is good.” Luna nods to herself - “

it's right there like an unforgivable curse, crying out to be cast from the back of his tongue, making his mouth dry and his throat feel thick.

“You have?”
“It's – what I do Harry,” she laughs back, kindly, the first time he's ever heard her do that - “Get used to it – go on, piss off!”
Malfoy!”
He's been thinking about this for a little while anyway, terribly afraid that a certain name could spill out of him at the same time as everything else.
“Really? Why?”
you sound like Weaselby.”
Narcissa could have told him; she sighs without the faintest sound, if only he had been able to ask her at the time, if only she had been able to tell him. She takes herself away discreetly when the children – yes she's not that little of a normal mother and they
“Anyway – sure about that are you? Here I am, merrily interfering with a couple of ladies' love life and I hear there's you – wandering the old Black house like a ghost, aren't you Georgie?”
He grins, running across the grass, windswept and elated, to Draco who simply stands there smiling at him and reaching out a hand – his version of outstretched arms.
“Why, do you think?”
before we can even think about being fixed – it's like - ” he dares to look back at George, surprise in his eyes at finding himself holding on to the older boy's arm. His eyes look silver with wetness, glittering in the dull light of the corridor, glancing around him rapidly as though afraid anyone else is listening -

“We call it rehearsal Potter, yeah. Twat.”
“Your mother's worried about you,” he says eventually. Draco notices that he does not look at him, that he looks down at his hands in his lap, that he still hasn't shaved and his hair is tangled. He hates his father looking like this. He wonders what
Because he's gotten ahead! Damn it! Harry kicks his broomstick as though it has been a truculent horse, even though he has been the one getting distracted, and he races forward to catch up.

“Since – we were adults and should probably stop with the adolescent rivalry?”
“Did I?” Draco raises a shoulder, faux idly, like he's too good even to shrug properly. Harry rolls his eyes.
“Completely,” Blaise nods, catching her.
“Oh Harry, don't be silly. You can't replace skin with billywigs, that's just silly. Come on, let's sit down, the others will be here soon.”
“Uh?”
Draco drops his eyes sullenly;
“Do let me tell you about my childhood some time.”
Draco says, and Harry can see his throat move with the effort of retching up the name - “He was right here where we're standing now. He said father was in Azkaban, and -” he stops, swallowing hard - “Can we carry on? I don't think I want to hang around here.”
His head and chest still throb to the beat of his last song, the music casting a spell on him as he makes it that lingers long after the singing is done. It always has done – ever since he took it up, ever since he felt how healing it could be. He feels like he's still flying on it. Sometimes he wonders why he did not go further with actual flying, he had always secretly wanted to in school; he wasn't terrible either, even if one particular arsehole always beat him to the Snitch. Oh
“You've met Viktor, yeah?”
“That's my girl,” says a dreamy voice behind him, and he yells and turns round.
“Went to get stuff.” Draco shrugs one shoulder, indicating the bag - “Got stuff.”
“Alright.”

“Did it work?” Harry bites his lip, the question a tender one, already guessing the answer.

suspect, but it was never something as gorgeously lacerating as the voice which taunts him now, like a higher hand dangling the Snitch forever out of his reach until the Harpies Seeker swoops in front and plucks it right out from under his nose, shaking her head like the victory was too easy to even enjoy.
He does not stay comfortably collapsed for long, Draco wriggling and fighting, muttering and elbowing -

“I was gonna say, stay alive for you, George, but okay, yeah I mean me too – you think I can enjoy my afterlife if I'm always having to worry about you? I'm supposed to be causing havoc not chatting away inside your head.”

“Rather amazing. Glorious even.”

said it before, you know,” he says gently in what it occurs to Draco is a terribly Slytherin move because in listening to what Potter's saying he does not notice the hand that cups his face like it's the most fragile of things for at least a second and somehow – like it's a spell Harry's casting, he's leaning in and their foreheads are touching and it feels earth shattering, this tenderness, like it might kill him and he can barely breathe.
“It's been a long time coming.”
Funny, how things keep happening, George thinks; first Angelina, then the shop and a few days after that a call from Ginny at the Burrow – almost as though these things are meant to happen. Ginny asks him to come home, to sort out the picture of Fred in the family portrait hung over the fireplace.
“Yeah, like Draco's ever shared a sofa in his life -” Blaise takes the only good armchair, legs crossed like a lotus flower - “Likes his minions sat at his feet, don't you Milord?”
“Just you. Trying. I've seen you Draco, I've seen you every day trying, you and your mother, changing how you think, how you behave. You've always thought you were like your father, haven't you? Well that's not who you take after at all. I see you, we've all seen you. Being better than you were. I don't need a heart of gold; who has that ? I just need you, being you, being better today than you were yesterday, that's all any of us can try for, isn't it? I fail at least as much as you, you know.”
She waits, semi patiently, while she hears a grunting and shuffling coming towards the door and finally Harry opens it a few inches and peers out yawning, hair sticking out in all directions -

drops it again as though it burns him. The thought of eating (being eaten) rises in him for the millionth time like bile and he is terrified for a moment he might actually be sick (one disclocated reptilian jaw and he could have fit right down that throat himself, he saw it work dinner down, heard the bones crunch) – he has only been able to eat since by clearing his mind of everything, alone and in hiding as though if anybody saw the roles of food and himself would be reversed. He has not been able to stop thinking about it, even able to tell anyone, though he suspects his mother knows. She was there. He wishes he could be as elegant and self contained as her, wishes he could make his face a mask like she can, make his whole self a mask, feeling and betraying nothing.
“Did he now. Why?”
she reminds herself, certain they cannot be on first name terms.
“Happy New Year, you tossers!” Harry laughs, slinging an arm around Draco's shoulders who blushes, awkward but pleased.
He's still sort of walking, sort of backing away from Harry down the corridor, unsure if he wants to be making eye contact or not.

After the last few days working on the books with her, Hermione had, at that point finally got up the courage to mention Andromeda, and
a Death eater, she sighs; she just provided them with tea and cake sometimes.
It was years ago now. It had been the first time he had told Harry about what happened to their old Muggle studies teacher. He had ended up crying messily into his chest and apologising in a flood, just
On the whole, he reflects, after the Afternoon Tea Trial – it could have gone worse. Lucius will never like him, he knows this; but he tolerates him because he has to, he knows that it's only because of Harry that the family ever escaped Azkaban and he knows that he cannot personally take any credit for that, that he is forever indebted to his wife and son and now – to his immense gall – Harry Potter – for his very life. They do not speak unless they have to, but it is only ever frosty at worst.

it just to stay alive, and when Draco makes no move to object – indeed moves almost impercptibly into him, tilting his head up just the faintest fraction, he falls into him with fierce hunger, not simply kissing him but seizing hold of him as he does like he's a life raft in a storm, swearing as his glasses fall down his face and chucking them off heedlessly. There is nothing sharp about Draco when he's here, in his arms; he is simple softness and light, melting like a pool of warm sunlight, insubstantial as a moonbeam; Harry cannot shake the notion that it's like holding starlight in his arms, that he needs to hold on tight, hands moving everywhere, fast and hard or all that glttering sweetness will just melt away like light leaving a deluminator. He wants to touch Draco everywhere, take possession of him with his hands – he never had anything like this before – he never had anything much before – he can feel how possessive he could get so violently it frightens him and he breaks off with a great gasp for breath.
“I know what you thought.”
“I think perhaps your husband might have changed his name, yes. I hear that happens now.”
“I didn't say anything,” Hermione sags a little. “Harry,” she reminds him, remembering that she needs to - “And Draco. We have to talk to them.”

“So kiss me”.
Harry – when you were supposed to be asleep. Things I never need to hear again.”
Narcissa smiles, nods, helps Jean into an arm chair and sits down beside her.
Harry has ever heard, but then considering some of the things he had to say about it Christmas day, he supposes he should be grateful.

He tears the door open and leaves, slamming it behind him.

“Oh for fuck's sake -” Harry grabs Draco's wrist – it feels agonisingly frail in his hand, and he turns it over, pulling himself in as he does so, like this one damaged arm is his life raft, stroking his thumb over the edge of the black, running it up the line of the snake before bending his head and pressing a kiss into Draco's inner arm which feels – like skin, just like skin; he shakes his head gently and looks up at Draco, at the frightened bewilderment scribbled across his forehead - “It's just skin, Draco, no more you than your other arm. We all have scars and maybe they do add to what we are but I don't think they define us. Am I really still nothing but
“Well because – because I -” he almost whispers it for fear of the truth shattering everything if it came out with too much volume. “Because I don't think I've ever felt like this about anyone? Because I think – I think just maybe, this could be it -” he nods, feeling the lump of terror in his throat that tells him this is true - “The big one. I think I really, really love him Hermione and I can't do that to someone – you know what happens -”
Harry shoves Draco off the sofa and on to the floor, laughing. Draco bounces back up and hits the

“Teddy yes, there was nobody I could leave him with, and I thought – perhaps his godfather might like to meet him too – and his cousin.”
“I agree with Luna,” Draco tries to nod, finding it trickier lying down than he had expected - “Sorry guys -” he cranes his neck over the sofa to indicate the adults. “We

Right or wrong, he does, he does, he does.
It feels to him now as though over the years he had wanted every different possibility – he had been jealous, wished it were him, wished they could be friends,w ished the bloody Chosen One had died in his crib, wondered what he was like, wanted to grow up with him, wishing they never met, unable to wait until the day they went to school together – all of that before they ever even met. He'll have to explain this, but his head aches just imagining how to start –
“Luna? When did you get here?”
“The fuck do I do?” he moans and it is not just Hermione, but the whole room that yells -
clearly, though she is far too delicate to say this out loud - “Do you think – may I presume to ask if you think we should do anything?”
“With actual lying in?” Harry adds - “No offence, Hermione, but it's eight o'clock in the morning and we didn't sleep until four.”
in a way that Draco finds offensive, or to give him a well-calculated face that is actually admiration or lust or approval, but he can make it look like disgust if that's the mood. Draco can give an airy wave of his hand that gives Harry the urge to snap his wrist, or drawl something dismissive from the couch – enough to start a fight or to have Harry push him straight down into the couch and be done with the fighting part of this game.

Then it's night time and you wake in your bed and the ghost is standing there with outstretched hands and there's the dagger held out to you and black eyes that call to drown you in their spell again and sometimes - oh sometimes it would be so easy to take up that dagger again and cut the past across yourself trying to take out your own scars.
it was second year again. He can hear raised voices from down the pitch – Flint – who's a better and fairer captain of the Wasps than Harry would have ever given him credit for when Captaining the Slytherin Quidditch team – heading back up the field towards them still rumbling his assurances that – as Taz just said there's room on this pitch for all of them – and a group of what looks like angry rainbows and sparkles trailing after him.
he sneers like it's a dirty word, but he also says it in the same voice in which he once told Harry he wasn't scared. “Certainly not from

“I'm afraid not.”
Narcissa shakes her head apologetically.
“Scared?” - Blaise.
“Hermione!”

She wonders at the sensibility of handing Teddy over to Luna but she shrugs and risks it anyway as they wander through into the kitchen.
“I know you're up to something.”
She stares at him for a beat, almost ready to do something she never does and shout -
“I think I've also found a really neat way of making the fire sound effect a part of the music, we're just going to need to find a way to magnify your voice even further, I was thinking the section when you make that weird wailing noise -”

Narcissa wonders if it's a French thing, the bluntness and manner of speech, but it's true, she has seen it herself – the boys moving so much more in time with each other upon every step than they realise. She wonders who revolves around who.
“For the record -” Hermione says, grinning a suprisingly Slytherin smile as they head towards the Quidditch pitch at speed - “You meant Ron, of course?”
Draco almost sounds as though he's pleading - “not then, not when you asked me afterwards.”
He dwells on it as he picks up the quill, scratching out the note as slowly as he can.
“It's a

He looks angry now, for some reason this makes something hiss in Draco's chest like cold water pouring into an overheated pan - “Fuck
In a way, he thinks, perhaps he was always headed for this; he cannot remember a time before Potter, maybe there never was such a time. He has heard that name since he can remember, like every thread in the fabric of existence has always been pulling him to this point.
“Harry of course,” Fleur tosses her head back like this is obvious. “And your son, Draco. They are beautiful together.”
explain to him that this might be a good thing. She has no intention of giving up, but she would not have even asked his thoughts on her sister now, let alone ask if he would meet with her as she will. She is nervous about the new world herself but she has never in her life let nerves stop her. That's why she's holding the family together, gripping it like sand beneath her fingers.
“You – wanna come see what I've been doing?”
“I miss me too,” he nods, looking at his hands. He keeps on nodding longer than he should.
“Yes – my condolences.” Narcissa speaks as though every syllable comes with difficulty.
“She's sort of with the Order – well, not with us, but linked enough. Turns out she was family enough to get in.”
“Flying? Ung. Sleeping more like.” He starts to pull the covers up over his head but finds them whisked away by a quicker and more awake hand.
“- good. I don't think it would be good for you to face that.”
I think you broke my nose, you wanker!”
“To be alone.”
“No you tosser, I meant my name.”
“Well, it was lovely to meet you, Mrs -”

so much,” he finishes, chest shuddering with the breath he has to take.
It's as though Potter reads that vow in his eyes now because he drops his hand and sort of nods.
“By getting in a row with him?”
“Doesn't matter -” he clasps the back of Draco's head in his hand, presses their foreheads together. “It doesn't matter what you wish you'd done – the second I was alive you were there – not any of the others, it was you – you who realised I was unarmed, you who fixed it. It was your wand that destroyed Voldemort, not mine, not Neville's, none of the others –

“Oh stop it, you're turning me on.”

“I've never heard you speak long to anyone here - can I ask you why me? Why now?”

“I, er -”
“For Draco,” she almost half shrugs - “Of course. For the chance to get back to the castle and find him and because I knew that if Draco was alive, it would be because Mr Potter had made it so. Am I correct?”
“Alright, alright -” she holds out her hands placatingly, standing up and brushing her palms against her jeans before she reaches a hand to Harry to help pull him up - “Just – work it out okay? And – no hurry - just come out of the closet in your own time, yes?”
“Yeah but – why me though?” he frowns at Hermione, unsure why she thinks he needs to hear about anyone elses problems just yet. He's not sure he can carry his own, let alone even
“No,” Narcissa looks at her with something like amusement - “I'm not. Though I suspect you're right. Have you seen this?” She hands Hermione the note.
So long spent hiding his obsession with Draco, it seems, so long turning it into something else without meaning to, so long pouring himself into little bottles of anger and rage and frustration, now he's smashing those bottles all over the house and they're going up in clouds of coloured sparkles. He's drowning in Draco and they can't keep their hands off each other and it's, it's so very -
Draco cries messily, somehow this is a shock to Harry every single time; he still hasn't forgiven himself for the first time he saw Draco cry; how could he forget, after all. He should have stopped at least for half a second to ask what was wrong, rather than just,
“Huh. I forget you were related.”
“It's not a proposal of marriage Harry, I think you really

“She has. I know she has.”
“Oh.” Draco moves along. George sits down. He glances sideways, unnerved to have someone sat next to him, even if he was the one to make that move, and looks away again.
“Draco I swear I – it's always been you, forgive me, I'm sorry, I've been so stupid – nobody's -” he wants to say
“Turn around.”
him or something. He almost panics again at the thought, something in his gasping coming out more like hyperventilating. He needs this too much to be happy accepting it, cannot think about what it might mean, head still stuck in those spaces where he's whimpering in pain on the floor, sick with violation, humiliation, hurt. He's close, he realises, and if he looks up he'll see the green eyes black with bliss and that same closeness and they could be there together, they could be –
“They are not here,” the girl says, getting up from the desk – Narcissa cannot immediately place her, though she manages not to let it show - “But here. I think they have left a note.” She hands it to Narcissa with careful, confident grace and poise. Narcissa cannot help thinking
let alone his usual state of overthinking anything.
“Is it – always this cloudy here? You know -” Harry grins, intentionally obnoxiously. “For the aesthetic.”
“What is it?” he frowns, bloody observant fucking bastard.
calling stupid?
“What?” Harry asks.
“What?” he asks, because he does not see Draco until after she does, staring at him with a positively murderous glare from only a few metres away, nostrils flaring, lips twisting, eyes silver bright before he squeezes them tight shut for a second and half strides, half runs away down the corridor, fists as clenched as Harry's. Heard that. Of course he heard that.

do that, he can feel himself going embarrassingly red.
“We should probably leave a note – just in case anything happens and anyone misses us. So they know where we've gone.”
“Sleeping.” She sits down next to the boy and, trying not to make it look too awkward, pours herself some tea - “He's not good at – gatherings at the moment – especially round the dinner table -” she wonders if Potter knows why - “If someone could be so kind as to leave some food -” she trails off to the room in general - “- please -” she adds, feeling degraded by the word - “- he's not been eating properly since -”

“Sometimes,” Luna shrugs. Now and then. Mostly at the moment because you know – Ginny.”
“Amazing,” Pansy sighs, flopping back down onto the sofa. “Come on Draco, rejoin the living.”
“Gonna be one of those weird magic things, isn't it?” the man smiles wryly, and Narcissa echoes it with a little smile of her own.
“So what's the rest of the problem?”
“Ugh -” Draco drags both hands down his face, as though ironing it out. “My fault. Obviously. I -” he makes an expression and heaves a sigh that says he only just realised this part - “I fucked up.” He sags - “I should -”
“Alright Malfoy.”
“Yes -” Draco frowns, Harry kisses the little line between his eyes like he's wanted to for so long - “Yes, I said.”
“I'll wait for you here,” she hears Shacklebolt say, as though from far away; she is so focussed on gearing herself up for this meeting to come. “I just want to say, I have the utmost respect for your doing this -” she can hear him sound awkward as he says it, but at the same time genuine, as if to say this is true what he says but he is surprised by her doing this –
Pansy snorts. Draco raises an eyebrow but doesn't turn around or say anything to give her away. “But yes, alright -” she admits grudgingly. “I didn't love the idea of seeing our glorious head – not after last time. But the thing is, she
“Look -” Potter holds his hands out as though taming a fretful pony - “Calm down, alright -”

“Did it again,” he mutters - “Sorry.”
Ridiculously, Draco feels nervous. He stands by the old battlements, his fingertips jittering on the stone, looking out just to feel the night air in his face, the cool of it after the heat of the hall. He watches his hands move as though he's high on something -and it's not too far a comparison, he's buzzing from the music, the attention, the noise, the adoration of the crowd; it's a good feeling – so to be nervous just about
It's not Fred. It's
“And if those people care about each other?”
“Oh you know. Getting there, getting there.”
“Probably, okay shut up, stop fraternising with the enemy – that's me by the way, and get back to your team, nitwit.”
Draco just looks like he's trying to avoid the paparazzi at every turn, eyes averted or dazzled, meeting nobody in the eye, half frantic, on the verge of tears all the time. Harry hates the way it makes him feel, hates that he finds himself wanting to see the old sneer back, that flash of wicked mischief in the eye that used to itch so (
“I was – at home -” she says slowly, memory coming back to her, slowly but without the rehearsed mechanical precision of the false memory - “We were talking – about what was happening, Hermione was trying to explain it to us but we already knew something was going on – with the bad wizards and the fights that were going on – or a war? As there a war? Are you a witch? Do you know Hermione?”

feel special, it is – not a nice feeling.”
He sees Harry and Draco tentatively joining in the clean up – Harry organising, to his surprise - and just as much to his surprise, Draco taking instruction on where to haul boxes and strip walls. He notices the moment that Lucius and Draco catch each other's eye, the one with a painting under his arm and the other peeling off ancient wallpaper with a spell that honestly looks quite fun. He sees the son meet his father's eye for the first time in years and the father for the first time in as long not look away. He sees Lucius put down the painting and enfold his son in a hug, wordless, both of them. He sees Harry and Narcissa in other corners of the room look away discreetly, just like he does.
“You can bring your boyfriend.”

“I don't -”
For as long as they can both hold the moment, they stand there on the grass in the early morning dew, getting wet trouser legs, staring up at the stars and trying not to love so hard the feeling becomes audible, though it's there in each heart beat, on each breath that clouds the summer night air. There is only one way, Harry thinks, that they can ever have got to this point, and that is by magic. He wonders if that's why they still have to insult each other about fifty times a day – to remind themselves that this is real. But then insults have been the language of their love long before either of them knew what they were doing.
“Merlin's bloody beard on a bike!” Draco announces - “It's a sea of sodding weasels – uh, no offence, Mrs Weasley,” he adds quickly, blushing profusely when he notices her noticing them.
“You – manipulative conniving little arsehole -”
“God yes, I do I want to hurt you - fuck, get down, I'm gonna fuck you -”

“Oh yeah. Yeah totally. Every word. What did you say again, 'Mione?”

Strange, almost like grieving, to know that he loves this boy beyond anything in the world. Beyond anything she could give him or prepare him for. She feels bereft; maybe all mothers do, she does not care, does not like other mothers, does not, in fact, like children. It is almost like heartbreak to know you are no longer first in your child's life – but a selfish heartbreak, one that any kind parent has to hide, and strange because there is a happiness in it too, knowing how glorious love can be and perhaps it hasn't been like this before; perhaps her son, because he is after all who he is, covered love with a lot of scorn and loathing and rejection – she can understand that – but if it was not wonderful before, she thinks perhaps it can be now. She saw the way they looked at each other, she knows how it feels, what love looks like – and what she saw makes her happy for them. There is no option in choosing between the happiness and the heartbreak, no sensible option anyway. Something inside her glows golden with it.

“Why are you here, Malfoy?”
“Oh Harry, I don't think that was the music – not as such.”
“You're just -” Draco stares at his wand as though unable to believe it - “You'd just give me it back?”
“I was just thinking about you -” Harry shakes his head, actually smiling.
he hears Ginny's voice in his head, and wonders for the hundredth time what she was talking about.
George finds he knows how the kid feels so hard he stands up, approaches the sofa, nearly sits down, realises Draco is sat on the right and he can't sit down on the left so he bites his lip and jerks his head -
“It's beautiful,” he says. Draco still looks at him suspiciously. “I mean it. You're good. You should play more often.”
“Harry -” Draco's hand, turning his face, he fights it for a half second then simply stares at him beseechingly, a lump in his throat at the sound of his name spoken like

“Easy for you to say you -”

the world he had fought for. He is not in the habit of admitting he was in the wrong and he is not one to break a habit. How to pick up the threads of a life when almost every single one of those threads has been cut? He could have been content with death or Azkaban, both of which he had expected far more than this – this curious reprieve, this undeserved leniance. Azkaban the first time round had close to sent him mad; if he had gone back as he should have done he could have taken refuge perhaps in a fuller, more embracing madness, but no, no- he has to hold on here in a terrible weak grasp at sanity alongside all the people he has wronged the most in the knowledge that he is weaker than any of them, his family held together by his wife, the best of him glittering through the cracks his mistakes have made in his son.
“Blaise, I'm sorry!”
have talked it through with someone else in the house, least of all Hermione, but suspects that her resolve could waver at the doubtless sensible objections they might all put up. The girl especially would probably be the first to try and talk her out of it, but the girl does not know what she wants and needs anywhere near as much as she thinks she does, and in this at least, Narcissa has been determined to override her.
“Will you take
She makes it very clear that she is saying
He gulps. For just a split second his brain did not hear the sarcasm, for just a moment he lets his face betray him that maybe it bloody well was, and in that moment of facial betrayal Draco's eyes go wide at the possibility that his sarcasm might actually have hit home.

Harry splutters, Draco scoffs.
“You –
Here it comes, he knew it would; a whistle of air from between the window panes, the nearby rush of the sea carried in on it, a whimper and Draco stirs in his sleep, clutching the duvet – most of the duvet actually, but like with everything Harry does not really mind – actually he keeps a spare pile of blankets next to his side of the bed for when he finds himself totally uncovered at night and utterly unable to prise even a corner out of the tight little bundle in the bedclothes. Then after the whimper a soft little moan; a choked, frightened noise and a pained swallowing sound. The noise that comes out when you're trying to scream in the dream, but you choke on it and the strangled sound hisses up from the throat. It starts. He rolls over, kisses the head that starts to turn on the pillow, hair like feathers, skin like moonlight, like trying to take care of a sliver of starlight.
“Sure.” He shrugs with one shoulder, he supposes he always did; him and Fred only ever having one whole shrug between the two of them.
“You know what?” George says as they all start to head slowly through the crowds in the direction of the nearest wizard bar - “That was
again. Because I was mad in love with you, Potter, is that what you want to hear?”
The closer the start of term creeps the less ready Draco finds himself feeling; but with everyone else apparently both ready and excited for it he does not mention this to anyone, even Harry. Harry, in fact, seems to be avoiding serious conversation as much as possible which suggests to Draco that he does not have time or want to hear about any misgivings he might have, which just serves to make him tetchy about the whole thing, annoyed at Potter's readiness to move on when he isn't and worried that he is going to be left behind. It's going to be so different for them, he thinks, the heroes returning after the war, especially
violating Malfoy. His mouth goes dry and he feels half a fever coming on.
and stirring in milk and sugar cubes until his hand steadies enough to lift the cup. He never takes his eyes off Potter, even over the rim of the teacup; glaring at him as he glares back, clearly too polite to tell him to fuck off in front of everyone else, but it's painfully obvious he wishes him a million miles away and preferably dead. Well, that's fine, the feeling's mutual. He sips his tea. It's too hot but that's alright, it's the first thing he's swallowed in public for a long time. One moment at a time. He takes toast (

it, whatever it was. She cradles him when he starts to cry messily, but quietly, shaking so fiercely she fears for him; he's so thin these days. She wishes he did not cry so silently, that he never had to learn how, but at least he's crying now, after the past few weeks perhaps it's something.

He flashes a desperate look to Narcissa that Harry reads as

He's scared of the dark and they both know it, but Harry would not actually be mean enough to say so, just like he would never actually have argued that one. The dark, he thinks, even after all this time, even when to all awareness there is nothing lurking in it, is still a thing to be feared and he cannot blame Draco wanting that hall light.
“You wish,” Blaise rolls his eyes. Pansy doesn't say anything, but she catches Draco's eye with sympathy because she suspect he probably

Draco frowns, wondering why Harry would feel the need to tell him this when he never has before. He finds he cannot say anythign, terrified at the prospect of saying no, uncertain how to even begin to voice consent. Instead he says -
“Well don't get used to it. Malfoys don't get sentimental.”

“Yeah no, you know I can't do that.”
too much too soon too fast, but he thinks perhaps it doesn't matter any more and if he can just wrap himself up in Draco's body it can be the thing that will heal him like he has needed for so much longer than he realised.

apprehension too or he might drop them all like poorly juggled items through the air.
“He'll be asleep,” Hermione raises an eyebrow warningly.
What do you want, a public apology?”
“Yes?”
“She actually said that?” Draco sounds incredulous; it raises his vocal levels of posh by at least twenty percent - “Granger. She specifically and actually said
us – like – like we were pawns in a game of wizard chess and it didn't matter who got smashed to bits as long as the right side won in the end.”
“But -” he can see the surprise on Harry's face -
“Specifically, yesterday -” he brushes the comment away. “After – you know – you were kind of a mega dick and I thought you regretted everything. But you didn't did you? Luna said.”
that had been the first moment he thought of when he was first attempting a Patronus – the moment he had fallen head over heels whilst still deciding his first love was his first hate.

“No, I already know that -”

“I don't know what you're
“It was the place. Fucking panicked, didn't I?”
“Ugh. Booby prize. Take it back!”
“No, I just wanted to -”
“Something like that -” Draco shrugs, trying to make it look as though he doesn't care. He's so bloody transparent, Harry thinks, like he's made of glass, spun sugar, twisted crystal, beautiful and completely see through. He cares. He cares very much, he always has and it's always been his problem. Too much sensitivity; they really are so very alike. Draco's still looking at him for a comment and if he doesn't say something within seconds Harry just knows he'll get stroppy, reading silence as condemnation.
She pauses a moment again just in front of the shiny red door, straightens her shoulders and lifts up her chin; looking perfect is her weapon. It occurs to her that too much perfection, too much pride could be off putting to these people, but she cannot lower these weapons, especially now, just from habit. She knocks sharply. After a moment that feels all the longer for holding her breath through it, a dark haired woman of around her own age opens the door. Her eyes are keen and clever and familiar but at the same time they look – to Narcissa – quite obviously lost, like she left the house forgetting to turn something off lost.
“Babies don't really do anything, do they?” she muses - “I mean – they smell nice until they poo and they're sort of squishy to hold – maybe that's the poo though - and I suppose that's quite nice but I still don't see why everyone goes on about them so much. I don't think I'll have any. I mean I didn't just decide that just now of course. I think I'd rather have a kitten. Maybe five kittens, do you think that would weigh the same as a baby?”
“Oh alright, maybe that was uncalled for. Nevertheless we heard
“Mrs Wilkins, I – I appreciate this is strange – a complete stranger walking into your house and asking you soemthing like this, but – are you happy in your life?”

“They need help. Shit they're coming, let's vamoosh.”
step – having been in no position to be permitted to cry or scream or even react at the time – was to blame himself, start screaming at night and develop an absloute terror of snakes (which is a whole extra level of shame for a Slytherin, Harry has long since discovered).
“I've decided that the house system fosters mistrust and enmity. Actually, I've written a letter to Professor McGonagall about it, suggesting they overhaul the entire system before the next term – if there

look – if they make eye contact for too long - he's going to fall so far he gets crushed by it. He'll never even reach for the surface again, he's drowning in Draco, he's been drowning for so long, reaching for him as he turns is like reaching for air. Touching him is like being set on fire with a flame that tingles every pore of him, reaching under his skin, dragging lust out from between his ribs in streams. He pulls the stopper out the bottle with his teeth so he does not have to let go of Draco's hips, pushing his cock up against him, barely able to slip a finger in first, though he does, then another and Draco whines -
“You know what?” George says as they all start to head slowly through the crowds in the direction of the nearest wizard bar - “That was

“It is different, yes but also the same. I understand also I do not. Everyone can feel many things that are contrary simultaneously – this is a right word yes?
“Hmm,” she nods.
he whispers, terribly afraid that tonight could break all kinds of resolves; he feels himself very much in danger of saying all those things he has managed to go so long without saying –
which – ugh sounds like an awful pedestrian thing to do, but he's not as angry as he used to be, albeit the bar was high – and he deflates quicker these days.
crap? I hate it – like I did more than anyone else – we all risked everything, we lost things, we died -”
she shrugs apologetically - “But Harry really, it's actually quite terribly obvious you know, whatever it is -”
“Yes yes my Gabrielle – she is like you, very sweet, very innocent and trusting. A foolish, beautiful child that I love.”
“I propose a toast,” Draco says, chin jerked up a little pompously, but as Harry looks around the table he sees the others looking at him with faint smiles and little to no animosity and sighs a deep and happy sigh - “To the re-opening of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, and you can bloody well let me in this time!”
won't apologise? Ha well
“Harry and Draco are – still asleep,” Hermione finds herself apologising for them, despite it's being nine in the morning, ergo at least three hours before Draco usually emerges and fairly early for Harry - “Ah, here's Ron with tea!”
“And yes. Your daughter was at school with my son. She changed your memories to protect you, and well – we're in Australia.”
“That's different -” Draco had waved it away with an airy flick of the wrist - “You have an extremely kickable face, Potter.”)
“Ughff.” Percy sits down heavily on the bottom step of the staircase, George takes the spot on his left and somehow or other that feels okay. He notices that there are bags under Percy's eyes,his sleeves are rolled up and his hands are filthy; he's not just been helping organise the re-build, he's been pitching in.
“Of Draco, of course. He's baby.”
I really thought I could be that person –
reach for each other and kiss.
So this is his first preoccupation – simple, overwhelming memory of the kiss itself. Every time his heart tries to kick him into panicking for daring it, he remembers the way Draco felt, how he did not pull away, never even slightly, how he's sure- he
“Yeah, drop it Granger,” Pansy bounces up - “Like you don't have double the shenanigan potential of the rest of us.” She gazes at Viktor a little too wistfully, who smiles pleasantly back at her before she makes a garbled sound and breaks eye contact quickly.
“What -” he frowns, clueless - “The dungeon?”
“I think it has something to do with hating ourselves?”
bad, but mostly trying to compartmentalise his feelings. He's never been good at it; he feels like he's maybe always felt too many simultaneous enormous things to deal with, and in he end he always just explodes or fights with brief and sudden surrenders before settling back down into his churning scylla of whirling thought.
“You're not seriously going to ask me again?”
Harry snorts, Ron just looks confused -
“Because Blaise is a useless bloody arse and forgot that our stage effects could be done with smoke and glamour?”
that sends Potter shooting away from him and himself sprawling back on the stone in recoil and leaping to his feet like a whirlwind, taking several skittering steps back, wiping his mouth like the taste of Potter was the worst and not the best thing in the world, and Potter's standing up slowly, wincing and staring at him in shocked confusion.
“That – as you said to me about Mr Potter – is because you don't know him. I have suspected for a long time now that your friend is the only thing – the only
“It's different for me too,” Draco scowls a little. For a moment, in the pale ray of August sunshine, a colour hovering between silver and gold haloing him, he looks very young, his eyes searching Harry's face for reassurance he's not sure he can give. “They'll hate me,” he shrugs.
“Oh shit -”
“That's up to me, don't you think? Besides, I think I'm going to get told that a lot.”
“Why did she do it?”
Draco insists, arching a little into the caress - “
“Yeah -” Pansy nods, screwing up her lips in an ugly sneer. “Yeah McGonagall right, cool, only do you know when the last time she ever spoke to me was?”
“Excuse me?”
who said - and I quote, Draco –
This is how she finds herself at the Ministry headquarters, and then, a silent, watchful but respectful Minister for Magic by her side, taking a Muggle car to a small house on the outskirts of Sydney. The journey leaves her almost obviously wide eyed; she wonders if this is how a Muggle raised child discovering magic might feel – the vehicle with the wheels that move without magic or animal power – impossible for her to fathom – how

“So – but you
“Thanks, mother.”
He starts, in the corridor, hearing an echoing thump to the thump of his door and turning to see Draco march out with what looks like a similar level of decisiveness as he has just displayed himself. They look at each other, both frozen for a moment in each others headlights -
“Yes. Shut up. Look, love isn't normal; when I was little I thought I'd just sort of find some brilliant boy who lived up to my standards and marry him, you know, just – like you assume everyone does. But I didn't, I found two brilliant boys – and I didn't have to chose between them even though I spent ages thinking I would, then I spent ages thinking it would never work, second guessing myself, writing down lists of pros and cons for every scenario -”
“Why not?” he challenges - “
“Wha-?” Ron groans as she hits him with a pillow. She yells a little
Draco smiles; it comes out more tired than usual because it's a true one and he waves her away as he goes to his room. It's funny, he thinks, they weren't really like this in school – there for each other like they are now, too busy with their own failings and crushes – Pansy's was on

“The wards on the house are still good, nobody can apparate in except family.”
been for so long, needs it beyond the telling of it - “Yes fuck, get in me.”
“Completely,” he says, then he meets her eye and his lip quivers at the concern he finds there and they're suddenly hugging fiercely.
“Ohhhhh,” Draco sighs, his concern that Harry had at least temporarily gone barmy abating with understanding - “Really? You have that? What colours am I?”
sort of relevant though -” Draco persists. “Think about it. Do we really want to go back to furtive broom cupboards and empty classrooms again? Being treated like kids after everything we've gone through? Hasn't this summer made an argument for inter-house solidarity?”
excrutiatingly in his ear before walking on.
His old jealousy of Harry's perfect little friends flares up like a match. He does not hear what Hermione says next, just Harry replying -
“Are you coming or what?”
an idiot,” Draco nods, leaning his head in so that their noses are touching, Harry thinks he will never feel anything in the world so tender as the tip of Draco's nose and he knows he's lost to this love forever. Or found.
“You're – you're -” he squeaks.
“It was in our seventh year,” Harry shrugs. “And it was blue -” Hermione tilts her head to one side with a quizzical look - “Blue and green,” he amends. “It was pretty, like the sea, the colours – they cheered me – I had a moment of feeling like they made me feel better – and it was because of how they looked – huh, I only just realised that. It

“Oh you're wearing your Christmas jumpers!” she says instead - “How nice.”
“I'm going that way to practice with Viktor.”
“Yeah thought not.” Draco sighs, eyes dropping, a barely audible sigh - “Get out of my way.”
“Who is
Ten minutes later he's lying on his back on the bench he sat on with Draco earlier, sniffing the remnants of the elderflower cordial and wondering how anyone can like this stuff.
So many lies, he wonders even now if he'll ever trust anything anyone says again – easier to pretend to be someone else, to be Draco Black, the rock star; not Draco Malfoy the frightened boy, pretend it until it becomes the new truth – he needs.
“Typical.”
“I suppose yours wasn't the friendliest visit to the home, was it?” Draco's lips twist - “It was father's thing really. You'd be surprised. Of course he started getting them because it looked good, just like with everything, but we grew attached to those peacocks, all of us, even got to like the noise they made -”
He trails a hand under his pillow for a wand -
“Ah! Cold! Why do you hate me?”
you daft tart. I'm coming, alright?”
“This is out of

“You're not going to tell me if you're not okay, are you?” she sighs.

why does it always have to be a fight between them? He supposes it has something to do with their not being friends, having never been friends and he finds himself very very confused about whether he regrets this. He does not even know what he

But as he had approached the stand Draco had flashed him a lock of such narrow eyed bitterness that he had stopped still – stopped for long enough for Draco and his father to take off out of the court room without another word while Narcissa alone of the family, inclined her head to him and gave a dignified,
“Get out!”
“Gracious -”she says mildly. “
much in common.”
Harry plants himself squarely in front of him to stop him trying to walk off. Draco's nostrils flare, his lips curl -
“Not – really. Not always. No.” Draco prods at the ground with his foot a little accusingly, hiding the look in his eyes by glancing downwards. Harry goes to him, arms around his shoulders from behind.
Brigade whole heartedly. He just looks down at his fingers on the table, still and tense, every line of him tight and as though he has been paused, just waiting, not even caring what happens to him. He has been watching them since they got into the court room. Narcissa gave him a mildest fraction of a nod when she saw him looking, Draco made eye contact like a butterfly in flight, eyes skittering away in the instant like a frightened foal. The others are stationed near the exits, ready to move in; Harry just wishes he could let the Malfoys know, the nerves coming off Lucius are enough to knock a man out and no wonder. The crowd on the way in was as ugly as he predicted, shouting for their deaths, for immediate lynching, shouts of
He groans out a sigh and pushes back the covers, glaring at his father. Just at that moment he discovers that he hates him – he would probably have hated anyone who disturbed him at that point. But this is his

say his looked both evil and gay.”
“She's so funny, don't you think?”
“You say that like they wouldn't, Mr Saviour.”
“Yes,” Harry says, patiently again - “I do. I was here, and I saw a lot of the rest of it in my dreams -”
“You're complaining? And they always talk about how essential dreaming is to the character of the rock star.”
“Well done.”
“Clean the chimney then you wretch.” He gives her a hug. “When you say
“Besides, I've decided, I'm with Granger – I'm going back. We none of us deserve either dispensation or judgement. We just need to finish our education like sensible witches and wizards.”
“They're – um – hugging now – actually, it's incredibly awkward.”
attractive.” The women stare at each other for a while, Andromeda clearly wondering if this is all of the truth or if by some miracle her sister is joking with her. She sees enough in Narcissa's face to answer her the former and she bursts out laughing.
“You can say no at any time, you know.”
“And we're back to how you keep saving me -” it is not nearly as caustic as it would normally have been - “You really do have a saviour complex the size of the moon don't you? Well congratulations, it's done, you don't owe us anything, and if you could
“Harry?”She says looking down at him, frowning, arms folded across her chest - “
“Oh -” Malfoy's lip twitches, his eyebrow jerks, although not until Harry has noticed something shutting off around his eyes – disappointment? Regret? - “Should have known. Always did bring your little weasel girlfriend along to pick your fights for you, didn't you Potter?”
“I said, thank god you're here, mate! S'all getting a bit girly round here!”
before she yanks herself back with a start, recognising the fish hook for what it is.
“Harry? Can I come in?”
“-not my girlfriend,“ he manages.
eager to drama the fuck out and prepare for the worst. Because you're a moron and an utter utter twat.”
The first thing she realises, when Harry and Draco apparate in, is that they have almost certainly had sex. The second thing is that – for reasons she cannot grasp, considering point one – they aren't speaking to each other.
“Actually Fred asked me to come. Apparently he was bugging Ginny no end from the portrait -”
“Tell me about the peacocks. I didn't know you kept -”
“Ughff, fair you know, can't blame him for that. I would too.”
“Yeah,” he says, looking down at his lap - “Me neither.”
He takes hold of Draco's hand firmly, almost painfully, leaving the bathroom, marching them both quickly to the nearest room with a sofa – some kind of tiny all purpose common room – and enchants the door locked.
Draco sneers – weirdly it's actually an improvement - “Everyone's so
“I think I've got this,” he says - “One flame serpent, absolutely zero actual fire coming up -”
The first push is verbal, the other pushes back, neither able nor wanting to avoid the bait, even when there's real anger it's usually rather enjoyable; Draco once referred to it as Harry's
he had feared she might.
He shudders.
“Nope.”
beautiful, so pale and almost shining; he wants to touch everwhere, kiss every inch of skin, but he can't, not now - he needs to be inside him far far too badly. He casts his eyes wildly around the room, not really wanting to tear them away for a second, panicking when he doesn't instantly find what he wants -
“Just because it's in your head -”
“Yeah – if I may – my client doesn't go by that name anymore -” a smooth voice cuts in and Harry's heart sinks a bit as Zabini pushes forward – though
“Lucius, sit down before you hurt yourself. Yes, I have to go to Australia and speak to some muggles. It should be for long, then I'll be bringing them back here.” She does not say
He does not sound rude exactly, just surprised, and that's fair, she decides; it's not as though they hav ever spoken two words together. But first -
“You're not going to talk about it, are you?”
“Yeah,” Pansy says - “Wow. Right? Catching up to things, are we Potter?”
Draco cries out and it shatters the room until Harry knows – if he did not before – that he does not have to stay quiet, and he can hear him self growling like a monster gone feral in the room, his hand is wet where Draco is thrusting into it, shaking and coming and crying and shuddering under him and he's breaking apart, bursting from the woods where he's gone feral and emptying himself into Draco's body half howling, half snarling for the exquisite brilliance of it.
