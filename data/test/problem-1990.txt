Potter’s Bowtruckle had just taken a swipe at his hand. As Potter sucked on his bleeding fingers, the Bowtruckle set off at full tilt towards the forest, a little, moving stick-man soon swallowed up among the tree roots.
Sounds of ripping paper told him his friends were already opening their envelopes. A gasp and a shriek made him jump up.
It made Draco laugh, but his father seemed to get angrier every second. ‘Stop your antics this minute.’
He’d never been allowed or able to dance freely, truly freely; to let music touch him physically. There was always someone expecting him to remain dignified, to be and do whatever he was meant to. His parents would never allow him to listen to music this loudly, and even at the Parkinson Property he felt judged; either by Mr. and Mrs. Parkinson, or by the ever so cool older Parkinsons, Primrose and Penstemon. Every once in a while, Pansy would try to get Draco to loosen up to music in her bedroom, but her moves were so much better than his, that he felt embarrassed to even try.
In the end, he fired a slapping charm at Zabini, then looked up at Pansy, who was simply raising her eyebrows now. He shrugged with his most innocent look on his face, even though his cheeks were burning.
When he rounded the corner, he almost yelped as a stringy figure was sitting in one of the bay windows along the castle walls.
Pansy walked forward, her face set. A bloodstained, bandaged mummy stepped out of the wardrobe; its sightless face was turned to Pansy and it began to walk towards her, very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising –
Dinner was a subdued affair the night before their first exam. Draco, Crabbe and Goyle didn't talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day. Nott on the other hand kept putting down his knife and fork and diving under the table for his bag, from which he would seize a book to check some fact or figure.
‘Step aside,’ Snape ordered, and even Professor Umbridge obeyed. ‘Goyle, hold him up, keep his head still. Warrington, get Madam Pomfrey. Tell her to bring her full potions kit.’
As if Snape would choose Moody’s side on this, Draco thought, feeling a little better as he imagined Snape’s fury.
He instructed Gregory, with his low voice, to sing a little bassline, and Vincent to just snap his fingers, because he simply sucked at everything else.
That should have worked, he reckoned, except perhaps if the person who stole it was somehow able to quickly block the spell. It must be a powerful witch or wizard.
‘What’s wrong with you?’ scoffed Vincent after Draco mindlessly shoved his food across his plate and missed yet another thing someone said to him.
Whirling around, he saw Harry Potter a few feet away from him, wand in hand. As soon as Draco saw him, Harry bolted past Weasley and Granger, howling with laughter.
Draco and his friends had to hold on to each other from laughing. Wiping away tears of mirth, Draco breathed out and asked, ‘So… going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name? There’s money involved as well, you know… You’d be able to afford a few decent robes if you won…’
As they got to work on connecting the paragraphs, Draco caught Nott doing the same odd thing he did during their Potions lesson: the boy tapped his arm with his wand, this time flashing the number 4,5 into the air. Following that, he seemed to scan the hotdog with his wand, then put his wand to his flank, flinching slightly.
The whole class was standing on their stools now, while Longbottom, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.
Frustrated, Draco broke the song off mid-bar. He searched his brains for something cheerful, but hardly anything popped up. In the end, he reckoned Abba could never be considered depressing. He started
Within the hour he got a reply. ‘Magisterial “we”?’ Pansy wrote. ‘Anyway, my proposal would be to feel like throwing a party and raising the flag. No more worries, no more distractions, no one to outshine our natural greatness! Run it up the flagpole! If you ask me, he got exactly what he deserved. Grand-standing mister hotshot with the hoity-toity scar on his fat, pompous face. Ding-dong the dork is gone!’
‘Thank you very much.’ Draco took a several seconds long break and a deep breath. ‘I apologise, dear listeners, you are catching me in a grumpy mood, today, I must have gotten up on the wrong side of the bed. This afternoon, we’ll be welcoming our local interpreter of the stars in our studio once more. Let’s see if she can shine a light on this inexplicable cold front in my state of mind.’
Instead he asked for his pendant back. Potter clutched it through his shirt. ‘I – I don’t want to ruin things.’
‘If we had a Slytherin Headmaster,’ Draco grumbled, ignoring her, ‘someone sensible, instead of that ancient, nutjob Mudblood-lover, this would never have even been a problem. My father – ’
‘Judging by that disgraceful defeat we all just witnessed, I would certainly never have guessed you were tutored for weeks. How do you think that is possible?’
Draco sighed deeply. ‘Useless Potter…’ He glanced at the gifts on his table and kept talking to distract himself from the fact that Harry Potter was still holding his hand, ‘Anyway, thanks for the snacks and the book. Might entertain me for a few minutes… Merlin, I’ve never been this bored.’
Fuck – ‘Hey, Potter, how’s your scar feeling?’ Draco shouted, jumping up. ‘Sure you don’t need a lie down? It must be, what, a whole week since you were in the hospital wing, that’s a record for you, isn’t it?’
‘This tattoo is what we call “the Dark Mark”. It is the symbol of the Dark Lord.’ His father paused to allow Draco to let that sink in.
While the house-elf went through her embarrassing disciplinary routine, Bellatrix sat back on the couch like an old lady: groaning, a hand on her back and leaning on her cane. ‘That is enough,’ she lazily told Tinsel. Raising her voice to drown out the ‘thank you’s, she told the elf to pour them all a bit of tea. Then, Bellatrix turned towards Draco as if she was about to ask him something when she whipped back once more. ‘AND KNOCK BEFORE YOU ENTER!’
Draco, Vincent and Gregory exchanged proud looks. Sitting next to Viktor Krum felt like a personal achievement.
‘Oh, an’ here comes another one!’ said their half-breed guide proudly. ‘Now... put yer hands up, who can see ‘em?’
, or with chronic pain, or his arm could go limp, or it could turn black and fall off entirely. He’d been spiralling.
‘Good,’ the latter said with grim satisfaction, as she put her hands on her hips. ‘I’m sure you had it coming, but I’m glad we could fix you. This’ll rub off on us, you see. You’ll make us look like we’re not in control. Don’t let it happen again.’
Draco shared a look with Crabbe, standing on the other side of the door, eyes wide with fear, and the both of them decided to go back to their tasks without saying another word.
Safely back inside, Draco stumbled over to the kettle in the kitchen. ‘More boiling liquids to gulp down then?’
? If I’m betrothed to Crabbe?’ Hands on his heart, Draco pretended to stare lovingly at Vincent and heaved a big sigh. ‘Why, yes – yes, it’s true, Zabini, we are
Nott stopped in his tracks to shove Draco against a wall and stare him straight in the eye. ‘You’re talking in French, you dork. Stop it.’
Frowning, Draco looked round at her, but she simply winked, mouthing, ‘Trust me,’ and fell back into step with her gang of Slytherin girls.
‘“Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache”… Dear dear, Potter, what’s ailing you now? “A boy like no other, perhaps… yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence. Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents, fourteen year-old Harry Potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggle-born Hermione Granger.’”
Shuffling over to the Wizarding Wireless in the corner, Draco waited for the herbs and drinks to kick in, listening to Zabini’s playlist. Leaning against the wall with one shoulder, Draco fired Scourgify after Scourgify at his hair, his face, his hands, his robes...
Draco missed the two eldest Parkinsons. They left a big hole in the chaotic barrel of monkeys that was the Parkinson family. There was no need to mention this though; they all missed them. The Parkinson Property felt empty without Primrose’s scandalous boyfriends and the way they tried to exploit her all the time, or the piles and piles of wood Penstemon liked to collect for you-never-knew-when.
Pansy gasped, looking sincerely hurt, and Draco would have regretted his words if he hadn’t been so furiously on the warpath.
Draco knew exactly how to convince his friends. At first, he bragged loudly about his lessons to Crabbe and Goyle, claiming them to be exclusively for Draco and making Yaxley sound like a famous wandsman. He told them Yaxley had almost played at the Wizarding Olympics, but declined the opportunity because he didn’t like long distance travels. Draco boasted about the things he’d learned and how he would probably be able to kill Mudbloods alongside his father by the end of the summer. He pretended to have the time of his life.
A group of Gryffindors and Ravenclaws was sniggering at Weasley’s choice of words. The guy had a lot more confidence since the war ended, and even more still since his BFF became Head Boy.
So they sat together in silence, and every second was agony to Draco. He kept his eyes fixed on the lights of the castle to estimate how much longer he’d have to suffer. The answer was: long.
She gave him directions and Harry pushed down his excitement. He might have found a way to casually meet the man from the wireless, but it was only for his case. It could be extremely helpful to have an all-knowing journalist on his side, that was all. Meeting his secret admirer was hardly anywhere on his mind. Harry was an auror. He only cared about men when they were criminals he needed to catch.
With Moody’s back turned, Draco saw his chance and ran in the direction of the dungeons. People jumped away from him, but before he knew it, he was pulled back again by a magical force.
‘Don’t be ridiculous,’ grumbled Harry, ‘you literally have the scars.’ He gestured impatiently at Draco’s chest.
Fidgeting with the pincushion around her wrist, she asked him, ‘Is anything the matter, Auror Potter? Can we help?’
‘Darling, please,’ his mother interrupted again, sounding exasperated, ‘I meant something in a major key.’
Harry tried to remember what he had all been spouting that night. It might have been pretty revealing... But it was all a bit of a blur. A blur of, well, Draco… He remembered him smiling, leaning over, holding Harry’s arm.
Draco's view blurred; his voice dropped to a whisper. ‘What if he still loves me?’ He rubbed his eyes. ‘No, he didn't. Doesn't. It doesn’t matter.’ He straightened his back. ‘
as we speak and the Dark Lord just officially kicked off the second wizarding war!’ She held up her arms in defeat.
Her eyes shot to his scar and then darted over the rest of him. As she picked up her little Crup and pulled it close to her bosom, she blinked uninterruptedly up at Harry, who tried to present himself as quietly and non-threateningly as he could.
Happy to be able to do something they were experts on, the boys lumbered back to the castle. As soon as they were out of sight, Draco cut to the chase: ‘Are you in love with Fleur Delacour? She’s gone in a few weeks, so it’s really not a big deal.’
Saturday morning, at the crack of dawn, Draco got shaken awake by one of the Slytherin prefects. Bolting upright, he snatched his wand, and his overwrought reflexes had him jump out of bed.
It was all easier said than done. Draco had never climbed on someone’s shoulders before. Standing on the bench, he tied the massive cloak around himself, then he put his hands on Goyle’s shoulder and pushed himself up. Throwing one foot up so high he feared he dislocated something, he managed to fling his leg over Gregory’s massive shoulders, and almost lost his balance, toppling over backwards again, but he clung onto Goyle’s ugly head and somehow pulled his other leg over Gregory’s shoulder too.
Harry felt they were digressing and cut in to put them back on track. He set a date with Tracey, and at the end of the evening, he returned home feeling so satisfied he could even resist torturing himself by listening to Draco's show.
Sadly, Potter disappeared out of sight to take care of Weasley. Things quickly became boring again after that.
After hours or seconds or months, Draco recovered some words from the eternal pit of bliss and agony he’d fallen into.
.’ The butterflies flew straight through Aunt Mabel. It made her giggle. ‘I haven’t felt so alive since 1083…’
In a single day, Harry managed to crack the case wide open. Mayor Trewlove gave him all security footage of the community centre’s courtyard, as well as permission to hire a “cleaning expert” – which was just going to be Ron in some lab robes – to “expertly” clean the “cursed paint” off.
‘Oh you’re a-… y-you’re a…’ Draco took a deep breath to plant himself securely back on planet Earth. ‘A problem. I've got to leave.’
A whimper so soft Harry might have imagined it escaped from the back of Draco's throat. ‘Oh, Harry… It is such a dark song.’
'That's racist,' said Pansy, not looking up from the cat. She pulled that card whenever Draco insulted her, just because her family was Chinese.
Finally, the time had come to execute the plan Nott and Draco had been secretly working on for the past days. Draco was so excited he kept wanting to tell everyone, loudly, but that would undermine the whole secrecy of it. Nott was a lot better at keeping secrets than Draco and kept side-eyeing him, as if he was waiting for the moment he would need to silence him.
Draco grinned at his friends. They sniggered and started shouting too. The racket they made felt liberating after sitting in classrooms for hours.
‘You know, there was a moment when it seemed I could move in with my godfather,’ Harry pondered out loud. ‘That would have been great, I think. Dumbledore said no, though, and not long after, your aunt murdered Sirius.’
Snape swept to his desk, muttering, ‘“Thank you, Professor Snape,”’ so Draco echoed him. Sitting down, Snape pointed silently at the chair opposite his desk. ‘Foolish boy. What did you intend to get from your behaviour out there?’
The rest of the show was spent with a woman who enjoyed knitting a lot. Draco talked to her about her favourite stitches, her recent projects and the biggest challenge she ever took on. Harry forgot to fast forward, as he was intrigued by the fact that someone would knit sweaters for trees and would do so for an entire forest. It sounded indeed like a big challenge to him.
‘Eurgh’ just about summed up the Blast-Ended Skrewts, as Hagrid called the nasty creatures inside. They looked like deformed, shell-less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy-looking, with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads. There were about a hundred of them in each crate, each about six inches long, crawling over one another, bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes. They were giving off a very powerful smell of rotting fish. Every now and then, sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt, and with a small phut, it would be propelled forward several inches.
Draco, Vincent and Gregory howled with laughter. ‘Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something.’
‘I can’t believe this monstrosity get approved by the board,’ he drawled. Vincent and Gregory grunted in agreement.
He was met with glazy eyes from Potter, who'd probably never gone berserk for even a second of his life. Not everyone had the pleasure to have been invited to Parkinson parties, Draco supposed.
‘Mornin’, ‘arry,’ said the nasal voice of Neil from Ruby’s Record store. He was watching too, from a few feet away, stomach forwards and hands in his pockets. The bumps at the knees in his jeans told Harry he'd been wearing the pair for weeks.
Harry grumbled under his breath, but took the mug from Draco. It felt surprisingly cold to the touch and filled his nose with a prickling scent, so Harry sipped.
a question…’ Harry tried to focus. ‘A ticket?’ He squinted to read it – and he leaped out of his chair. ‘Willo?! Willo-tickets! How?! Ron said they sold out in ten seconds!’
Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch. The Bludger whistled along behind him
. His parents had completely removed the threat from this world for Draco. He had never felt so proud of his family. They could do anything they set their hearts to.
Lupin looked confused. Then his face lit up in understanding. ‘Oh, no, I meant next Thursday,’ he said, walking towards Harry, or rather, to his bag, standing next to the door. ‘You’re a week early. I’m sorry, I was probably unclear.’
After a while, the boys started looking envious, and Draco overheard them discussing if they could ask their parents for lessons too. Concluding that the time was right, Draco invited them to come along to a lesson. He did this supposedly in secret, but made sure Pansy overheard them.
‘Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,’ said Father. ‘All those raids… I hope they’re paying you overtime?’
‘Come, it’ll be great fun,’ said Draco as he lead Vincent and Gregory onto the Gryffindor stands. They spotted the ginger and bushy heads almost at once. They were sitting with that sad figure, Longbottom.
After their last lesson ended, Draco made his way to the kitchens, not wanting to lock himself in the library to write an essay with the new kid without any snacks. Listing off his demands for the house-elf in front of him, Draco wondered what his new Potions partner would like. He hated not knowing. In the end, he vaguely recalled him eating a hotdog at one of the Death Eaters’ barbecue parties.
Draco squinted at him. ‘Look, I’m not surprised you don’t remember, but I think you’re mistaking me for
‘They told me I was going to lose the fight… and leave behind my wuthering, wuthering, wuthering heights…’
There was a grim twist to Malfoy’s fierce, proud face. Harry had to look away. ‘I worry for you,’ he said, absently tracing the buttons on the soundboard. ‘I worry for everyone in Brookley.’
Draco could think of a dozen retorts, but repressed every one of them. ‘Well, professor…’ And he trailed off, remembering the last time he shared this information. Running a hand through his hair, he almost felt nervous.
The trial to get justice for Draco’s injury went even better than expected. Father had managed to convince the hearing that Draco’s wound had been bad enough to get the hippogriff
Tracey nodded excitedly. ‘It’s true. First she turned the girl into a dragon and then she put the whole thing in a teapot.’
The past weeks Potter had become quiet and tired. Everywhere he went, people skirted around him, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison. Draco hated it; all of a sudden everyone had an opinion about Harry and they all wanted to share it. They kept arguing about him being evil, being the Heir, opening the Chamber. It was ludicrous. This was
‘Filthy blood-traitor. Probably got herself taken into the Chamber on purpose, just so Potter would save her.’
So that was what Harry did: he roamed the streets of Brookley to make his ex-Death Eater ex-nemesis feel safe – and he wasn’t even weirded out by that anymore. In fact, he looked forward to cooking for him, too.
Hidden in a corner of the common room where no one would bother him, Draco was bent over his Runes homework. To keep his mind from wandering, he was doing all the homework for rest of the year in advance.
When they entered the candlelit Great Hall on the night the Champions were chosen, the Goblet of Fire was standing in front of Dumbledore’s empty chair at the teachers’ table – and Viktor Krum was sitting with the Slytherins again. Draco and his friends proudly joined the Durmstrang students.
‘Liar.’ Umbridge shook his head again. ‘Your Firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons, as you very well know, Potter. You had your head in my fire. With whom have you been communicating?’
Draco quickly mirrored his expression, laughing on the inside. ‘Oh no, now we have to clean all this up. How terribly inconvenient…’
We start off with some fluff, but things quickly go south. Harry is busy with the Tournament and seems to forget all about Draco, who has to watch him almost drown and turn up from a maze with “the real Hogwarts champion”. At the end of this chapter, the Dark Lord has returned and Draco is angry.
Draco decidedly didn’t take a second look at Potter as he swaggered off. Then Potter started shouting.
In an impulse, Draco bowed to the invisible public. To his great joy, Harry lifted an invisible hat in response to invisible applause. Draco wanted to kiss his dorky face.
It worked like a charm: that same night, she started bugging them about it, demanding them to tell her what was going on and what Draco, Crabbe and Goyle were up to.
Gilderoy Lockhart – as it turned out to be – even made a speech about how happy Potter was going to be, because apparently this lunatic was going to teach at Hogwarts.
Suddenly, he got annoyed with himself and with all those people he imagined talking behind his back. He grabbed his broom and flew back. Let them say it to his face.
‘But we forgive our local auror,’ Draco simpered. The chair slowly spun towards Harry again, eventually. ‘We would never have been so quick to forgive, had it not been for Auror Potter’s –’
Draco pulled his sleeve over his hand to dry Pansy’s cheeks. ‘Well, I am never practicing with you again, Psycho Pansington.’
‘Oh, forgive me, Mr Potter! How terribly inconsiderate!’ Draco leaped up to offer Harry his chair with a flourish. ‘Would you like to take over News Treat Live From New Street? Oh! Do you want to own my wireless station entirely?’ At this he waved a circling hand at the ceiling. ‘Please! Just say the word! Anything for the hero of the wizarding world!’
They arranged themselves in the entrance hall to wait for Draco’s father, where Mother pinned the badge on Draco’s robes. She was smiling and singing, ‘For he’s a jolly good fellow, for he’s a jolly good fellow.’
Draco didn’t tell her what he’d heard. He didn’t tell anyone. He needed to be sure first. If there really was a dragon, he wanted to be the first to see it.
‘Well, what can we say?’ said Tracey, sipping her pumpkin juice. ‘Mary is not someone to play around with.’
‘Well,’ said Draco, when a hilarious plan started to form in his head. ‘If he’s so scared of them, we might not need the real deal…’ He watched them all one by one with a malicious smirk.
‘Diffindo,’ Draco muttered to make a cut in the fence large enough to let him sneak inside. On tiptoes he inched closer to the dragon and slowly reached out to touch its massive, black scales.
‘Professor,’ he quickly offered. ‘Professor Umbridge, I think some of the squad should come with you to look after –’
Draco made a quick calculation. Knowing the visiting hours by heart after days in isolation, he knew the hospital wing would be deserted by now. It might be safe.
you somehow! Or me! It can’t! We cannot keep ignoring it, Harry! The Dark Lord has returned for Merlin’s sake!’
Potter looked fierce when he rounded the Firebolt in Draco’s direction. ‘Aw, thanks for caring, sweetie!’ he roared sarcastically. ‘I know how much you love catching
‘And what is more,’ his father continued, ‘last year, I executed his plan to open the Chamber of Secrets unauthorized. I was supposed to only do that when he ordered me to, but the Ministry was raiding our house for dark artefacts and we had to get rid of it somehow. So we planted it on the Weasley girl. The Dark Lord trusted only me with it, and I – I allowed your friend Potter to destroy it.’ Draco’s father clenched his fists and jaws, gritting out, ‘This will make the Dark Lord very angry with us.’
Draco stomped up the grand staircase and quietly sneaked back to the parlour again to listen at the door.
‘There you are,’ Draco drawled, spotting Crabbe and Goyle in the Dungeon corridors. For some reason they were talking with the Prefect Weasley. ‘Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I’ve been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny.’ He glanced witheringly at Weasley. ‘And what’re you doing down here, Weasley?’ he sneered.
Sitting on his bed, fully dressed, Draco lost his patience. His parents were not coming to get him out of there, but he had every right to know what was going on.
That was what Draco focussed on, on that day of the Yule Ball: not the whispers and the looks, but his dress robes, and the music that would be playing – they said Dumbledore had booked the Weird Sisters! Draco knew their songs by heart and now he would see them in real life! Then again, people also claimed that Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam Rosmerta, and Draco didn’t expect that to be true. Still, it promised to be quite the party tonight.
‘I am! Ask Helena from the local Healer Department, she fixed me up. Or Heidi from the local Parks Department, she took down the fence afterwards. Why did you think Mayor Trewlove drew up article sixteen: “All fences in Brookley are to be non-spiky and over five feet six”? Everyone had a big fright. Well, everyone apart from me. I was laughing all through it. Because I had a bit too much of my medicine. Hence the stumble in the first place.’
At the same moment, Umbridge grabbed Potter’s head, dragging him backwards out of the fire by the hair. She bent his neck back as far as it would go as though she was going to slit his throat, while Potter coughed like he was choking.
Potter and Lupin were bent over Harry’s stupid essay when Draco caught Potter’s eye. Or rather, Potter was looking at something behind Draco. His eyes were huge.
‘Yes, we’ve been out last night, alright? We’ve been to the Trophy Room, there was nobody there, and then we went back. You’ve got that? Repeat what I said.’
‘I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,’ says Draco Malfoy, a fourth-year student. ‘We all hate Hagrid, but we’re just too scared to say anything.’”
‘I bet her other half is something too,’ Draco couldn’t help but jeer, even though it drained all energy from his body and hurt every inch of his chest.
When he rounded the corner to the stairs, Draco jumped and froze when a great bawl echoed through the stairwell. It sounded as if someone was in a particularly tight spot – and Draco recognized that voice without a second thought.
To distract himself from his animal urges, Draco started carefully rolling up his sleeves, while Harry took off his cloak, leaving him standing in a moss green shirt with the sleeve buttons loose, showing a peek at his forearms.
‘Ew, how should I know?’ Draco scowled. ‘As far as I can tell he does not feel a thing, and I mean: ever. Well, he gets angry a lot, I suppose, or depressed, perhaps, but nothing much else.’
‘Famous Harry Potter,’ said Draco, slouching against a bookcase. ‘Can’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page.’
Snape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots, then gave Weasley an unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black hair. ‘Change roots with Draco, Weasley.’
I changed the arm injury-storyline, to make Draco more frightened. For the observant reader: the scene with Harry now differs slightly from the same scene in Crimson & Clover. Maybe I'll change it in that one too (maybe not, idk yet).
It was very difficult not to lose his mind, with Harry’s hand feeling warm on his hip; Draco felt it all the way through his robes.
Draco fell back in his chair, feeling satisfied. ‘Pass me the bacon,’ he interrupted Gregory asking for another impression.
One morning at the end of August, Draco woke up late to a message of Harry with a sore lack of interpunction.
Weasley shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at Draco, then took up the knife again.
Draco’s father always said Harry Potter was going to be a great dark wizard, and that he would lead the Wizarding World into a new and better age. It was hard to believe, looking at the broken glasses on the boy’s gaunt face, but Draco remembered the way Potter had looked at him in the back of Madam Malkin’s shop and was certain his father was right.
‘So, Potter,’ she said. ‘You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon,’ she nodded at Weasley, and Draco laughed even louder, ‘to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes, Mr. Filch having just informed me so. Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody. Was it Albus Dumbledore? Or the half-breed, Hagrid? I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall, I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone…’
The house-elves took Bellatrix’s measures and Mother sent for samples of fabrics and patterns. When they arrived, the two of them spent an afternoon choosing a new wardrobe for Bellatrix, while Draco watched.
Stroking the tufts of hair in Nott's neck, Draco felt a hand on his chest, pushing him away, slowly.
Grumbling, Harry flattened the letter Draco had just thrown him. He recognised it from earlier. ‘Oh, am I finally allowed to read Neil's question?’ he sneered. ‘“Ask Potter to go with you to –…”’ Harry’s voice trailed off.
She didn’t even crack him a smile. ‘”Nobody dies of bruises”, said Snape, but you know my opinion on
Draco wandered into an empty classroom further down the corridor. Shutting the door, he snarled, ‘What’s your problem?’
Draco scowled at her. The minute she was gone, he kicked off his shoes, leaned into Nott’s shoulder and put his feet on Pansy’s lap. ‘I think I deserve a foot massage, girlfriend.’
The voice of his father floated through the open dining room door to the entrance hall. ‘It has never been this clear, not since –’
During the game, there’d been a moment when the Snitch had been fluttering near the Beater’s ankle, and Potter’d sat up straight, clearly spotting it at the same time as Draco, who then enjoyed himself very much watching Potter’s clenched fists and jaws. It must have been immensely frustrating to watch your team lose while knowing you could have won, if only you were allowed to play – if only you hadn’t beaten up your perfectly lovely ex-boyfriend.
Without missing a beat, Harry launched into an epic list of every single feature of the Firebolt. It seemed like he knew the entire manual by heart, and the manual of Draco’s Nimbus Two Thousand And One as well. Draco tested it, by making a few features up, and Harry just laughed.
‘About what?’ came a whisper in his ear and Draco screamed. Barney was floating behind him, sniggering. ‘So now you
The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and an arched ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them. It had great concealed places to sit, and the back wall was one big window looking straight into the lake. It was like having a massive aquarium in your parlour. The other wall, to the left and right of the mantelpiece, was covered from top to bottom with books. Draco felt straight at home.
Draco flushed. The strict rules at the manor had slipped his mind. For a second, he considered saying “’Twasn’t on purpose,’ but that would probably not fare well.
For the first time in, probably, ever, professor Snape laughed. He regained his composure almost at once, but Draco was not going to forget it any time soon.
‘That’s impossible!’ uttered Daphne Greengrass, while Bagman talked about the Swedish Short-Snout that Cedric Diggory had to get past.
‘All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward,’ said Hagrid. ‘ So me, Harry, an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go the other.’
He wrote his parents to let them know. Mother reacted disappointed and sulky, but Father thought it best too. Being pure-blood, Draco wouldn’t be at risk of Salazar’s revenge, and Father was very busy at the Ministry, he said.
'Padfoot?’ cried Professor Umbridge, looking eagerly from Harry to Snape. ‘What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What does he mean, Snape?’
Draco tried to look innocently confused. ‘Well, I didn’t have my wand, sir. It’s not as if I usually need a wand during Quidditch, you know, professor.’
Judging from the security videos, the miscreant painting the wall appeared to be just a kid, but Harry took the case as seriously as the citizens did and attacked it like he was tracking down a serial killer.
Professor Snape was shaking his head. ‘Foolish boy,’ he snarled. ‘You didn’t stop to consider your own actions? You were playing and listening to songs about heartbreak for weeks on end. Hiding in your room, not eating and closing yourself off from the outside world. What, you thought your parents wouldn’t connect the dots? Draco, your father is the Dark Lord’s second in command. How did you think he got that position? You thought he was picked out in a lottery?’
‘Here you go, buddy,’ Draco said, handing the dog to Gregory, who appeared to be on the brink of crying tears of joy. He hugged the confused dog and pressed dozens of kisses on its head, repeating over and over what a great boy it was. His happiness almost made Draco feel something.
‘No,’ said Draco firmly, if only to keep his friend from whining about his boring sister for the next twelve hours.
as powerful as the Dark Lord. They said he was immortal, and he could read minds like no other.’ Father’s eyes lit up. ‘I have seen him do it, you know. He could use Legilimency to torture people – do you remember that, my lady?’ He snorted. ‘Old Dorky Meadowes? How he so marvellously –…’
Mr. and Mrs. Goyle threw one look at the dog and were sold. They knelt down to pet it, in rather the same way Gregory had just done, and started summoning all the leftovers from the barbecue one by one. ‘Oh, such a sweet, sweet cutie!’ shrieked Mrs. Goyle, planting kisses on the dog’s head.
Potter didn’t say anything, but his eyes shot fire. When he stomped back to his cauldron to fill another flask, a look of horror appeared on his face. He glanced up at Granger, who had her hands over her mouth. Draco couldn’t hear what she said, but the way Potter dropped in his chair, with clenched fists and scorching eyes, told him enough.
In the end, all of the Slytherins managed to resist each other’s Imperius Curses in one way or another – all of them, except for Draco. Pansy made him do the chicken dance, sing an opera, dance the polka, attempt to lick his own toes, attempt to lick Crabbe’s toes, attempt to kiss Zabini, play air guitar, do twenty summersaults, and he even almost jumped through the window if his father hadn’t prevented it.
Draco tried to focus on his own task while circling the Quidditch Pitch, but kept singing along to the chorus now thundering through the stadium: ‘WEASLEY IS OUR KING, WEASLEY IS OUR KING…’
‘She told us to do it. We have to,’ said Pansy, sitting down in front of the three bags of mail, that had gotten in or out of the castle in the past twenty-four hours. ‘I don't like it either.’
A ringing silence followed, but Draco knew better this time than to hope it was over. He covered his glowing ears with his hands, wishing he could evaporate on the spot.
‘Every minute we occupy the field is a minute the other teams can’t practice,’ Montague smartly added.
Meanwhile, he was even more shielded off than usual: the Weasley twins kept marching ahead of him down the corridors, shouting things like, ‘Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through!’
‘Open it, OPEN IT!’ screamed Pansy at the top of her lungs, her voice breaking, before Draco could even process what was happening. ‘NOW!’
‘HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?!’ Bellatrix slammed her knife back on the table. ‘DO NOT SNEAK AROUND! KNOCK BEFORE YOU ENTER!’
As they left Snape’s office, Draco reached for Nott’s fingers, but caught himself in time. He stuffed his hands in his pockets.
As he’d been pounding his own head with his fist, it might be unconvincing to reply he was all fine and dandy. When he kept quiet, the other person shuffled towards him.
This wasn’t real, it wasn’t the real Potter. The real Potter was behind them, watching Draco respond to
‘We can talk to him, right? Remember when you were there? You kept complaining about how we all deserted you.’
offended.’ Grinning, Harry leaned on an elbow and covered Draco’s lips with soft, fluttery kisses. He took his time with them, as if he needed to memorize his way around for later. His fingers slowly traced Draco’s cheek. His thumb touched Draco’s chin, gingerly nudging him to open his mouth – Draco obeyed – and, smiling as if he did something cheeky, Harry licked the tip of Draco’s tongue.
‘Good morning, Auror Potter.’ She smiled sympathetically. ‘How are you holding up? Are you alright?’
Draco checked their surroundings one last time while walking towards Harry. He tried to act cool, putting his hands in his pockets and relaxing his muscles, but the fright was still in his bones.
‘Yeah, right,’ said Draco, smirking. ‘I expect you’d have Father’s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job – I’ll tell Father you’re the best teacher here, sir – ’
Grabbing his bag, Draco walked out of the classroom, into the mass of students filling the corridor outside.
Draco let out a short derisive laugh and shouted, ‘Or is your family so poor because they saved up all their money to buy you a place in the team?!’
Draco knew to forge the iron when it was hot, and seeing the glint in his father’s eyes, he knew for certain the iron was hot.
‘What’s going on?’ Pansy loudly asked, turning in her seat to watch. ‘Hey, what’s Luna doing at the Gryffindor table?’
Still, there was no sign of their “teacher”. Glancing in the direction of the forest Hagrid had disappeared in, Draco grew restless. He spotted Harry scratching his arm. Draco wondered if the wound hurt. Why didn’t he fix it up?
Draco was thrown off for a second to change tactics and decided to cut to the chase. ‘Can you help me get these ingredients?’ He’d copied the ingredient list of the potion in
Malfoy straightened up to his full length to send Harry the sort of glare he used to send everyone in Hogwarts. The intensity tingled all through to Harry’s toes. ‘You will not breathe a word about
‘At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,’ said the Mudblood sharply. ‘They got in on pure talent.’
‘In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,’ said Father shortly. ‘I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today –’
She ruffled through her hair like she was shaking out a Niffler. ‘Everybody hates me here. They say I’m hysterical.’
‘You don’t! You just move away in a few weeks and forget about it.’ Draco made to slam the door, so Harry put his foot in it, but then Draco only slammed harder and Harry wailed in pain. ‘Fuck
‘Sometimes, Draco,’ said his father, ‘you are a wide open book… Remind me later to find someone to fix that.’
‘We could move to your bed,’ Harry whispered. Where he had found the cheek to even suggest it, he didn't know.
So the Mudblood assumed that Draco had set this whole thing up to get the Gryffindors into detention? That would have been quite clever. More clever at least than Draco’s real reason for not making an appearance.
Draco shrieked in relief. ‘Oh good grief… I thought we were toast. I hate fire, you know. Henry – our local Fire Department – he knows this. He said – Oh, you don’t care… Merlin, where
Pansy and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles. Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, ‘I see no difference.’
Draco knew perfectly well that they were lying. He did not care for it, but he also knew from experience they would never tell him if they hadn’t already by now – so he climbed back in bed and pretended to be a good lad.
‘Oh Merlin!’ His friends jumped from his sudden outburst. ‘I’m not – ’ Draco stared at them in horror. ‘Do you think I might be… a
Draco bit his tongue. He just wanted to get it all over with and hurried to organize the stuff, but then Harry took his hand – no, Harry shoved his hand aside. ‘Let me try it this time, Dra.’
Anyhow, there was no way Harry J. Potter would go all in for loud and scrawny Malfoy, who was not only the wrong gender to even be considered, but also Potter’s worst enemy.
Blaise leaned forwards in his chair, pinching his fingers together. ‘For the record,’ he said, ‘we all hate the guy. All of us here in Slytherin. My mum would’ve poisoned him ages ago.’
Draco laughed derisively. ‘The Quibbler? You’re joking, I’m not gonna worry about that nutjob’s little fantasy rag.’
They put the box on the floor and took out every item one by one. Most of the stuff didn’t make any sense to either of them.
A slender silhouette, backlit by the sun shining through the open doors behind him; gleaming, silver blonde hair moving in the cool, spring breeze… Draco Malfoy was standing in Brookley’s Auror Office, live as day.
They’d lost Potter’s attention; the Mudblood and the Monkey-Weasley fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart’s books.
Your wireless show has never been secret in any way. Plenty of people have warned you about pouring your heart out on a wireless show, but did you listen? No. Have you talked to Helena recently? Has she ever diagnosed you as
‘Wise move, Granger,’ breathed Draco triumphantly. ‘New Head, new times… be good now, Potty… Weasel King…’ Laughing heartily, he strode away with Crabbe and Goyle, replaying Potter's reaction over and over in his mind. It was a glorious day.
Draco pushed away Zabini’s hand on his chest and frowned at the cup he'd just emptied. ‘What? No… You’d have to marry me first.’
‘You know, this all reminds me of the Roman Empire,’ Draco loudly remarked. ‘Bread and circuses, you see. Those were the days – I suppose that’s what Dumbledore thought.’
He scowled at her. ‘I need to wait for my friends, professor, as you just sent them off, you see. We were actually about to buy a gift for our mothers, you know, because, as you may have heard, our fathers won’t be coming home again. Professor.’ He didn’t even try to keep the resentment out of his voice.
His eyes had no trouble holding Harry’s gaze – not many people managed that. It didn't take long for Harry to cave.
‘Right, well,’ he sputtered, ‘I can’t find it anymore, madam, I guess it must have healed.’ He turned to Goyle. ‘It could have been there, easily. You see, I read all about it in
Draco beckoned him to follow and they walked up to the common room, where they found Theodore Nott sitting at the couch’s arm rest, hiding a huge yawn behind his hands. He was crisply dressed in a marine blue jumper, but his eyelids were heavy with sleep. As the boys passed, he got up to trail after them.
I will be cutting up each of the last four books into multiple chapters. This is chapter 1 of 3 of Goblet of Fire.
The case report was almost finished. The notorious gang Those-We-Do-Not-Name turned out to be, in fact, fourteen-year old Andy Brown from Bremley across the river. Their parents – darling cousin Casey Brown and her husband – had to pay a fine or little Andy had to do community service. The parents had been livid at their kid, so they chose community service.
So he changed tactics, smirking. ‘What, you don’t dream of touching me, Nottingham? I find that very hard to believe. Don’t you think I’m loveable?’
Draco’d cleansed the necklace several times before. Usually, this meant having to haul a large, mud-coloured waft of liquid-like smoke out of the pendant. It was nasty work, but mainly because of the knowledge that all those grotty feelings were pieces of himself.
They reached the hospital wing, and Draco slowed down to peek around the doorway. Madam Pomfrey was nowhere to be seen. ‘Where is that dumbass?’ He edged inside to see the beds on the other side of the room, then gasped and whirled around to leave again.
‘Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!’ Draco sighed when he crossed paths with Harry Potter at the stairs.
‘How do you do, Draco. I remember you from when you were yay-high. It feels like only yesterday to me.’
‘It's our sport,’ Draco interrupted, growing bored with the boy’s predictability. ‘Wizard sport, you see. Everyone knows about Quidditch. It’s played up in the air on broomsticks. Well, I’m not going to explain all the rules to you right now, forget it.’
They could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the banked benches of the spectators’ stands. A few people were singing, and Draco had no trouble recognizing the song. As he smirked, he caught a few of his team mates sniggering as well. They were all wearing crown-shaped badges too.
Draco woke up from sunlight hitting his eyelids. That wasn’t unusual, given that his alarm clock was made of sunshine. What was unusual was the fact that someone was wrapped around him, or that when he opened his eyes, he wasn’t staring at the top of his four-poster bed, but at a bright, blue sky.
She threw it back in the box and folded her arms. ‘I am not touching any more of this. Malfoy stuff always has the most horrible curses, daddy says.’
Draco wanted to scream. He pushed Harry back in his seat and when the guy actually grabbed his wand, Draco snapped. ‘You chose the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you, you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this!’ He jerked his head at Weasley and Granger. ‘Too late now! They’ll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord’s back! Mudbloods and Mugglelovers first… Well – second…’ He smirked. ‘Diggory was the f–’
Draco glared at him, then continued, all through breakfast, to involuntarily stare at the Boy Who Lived, who looked positively glowing on this fine Christmas morning.
As soon as they retreated into the living room, Harry spotted the tiny bubble hovering over his wizarding wireless, and his heart skipped a beat. He floated their tea cups carelessly to the coffee table to put the bubble to his ear.
‘That’s my boy.’ Pansy smiled and Draco reached up to wrap his arms around her neck and drag her into a bear hug of his own.
‘In a brief statement Friday night, Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge confirmed that He-Who-Must-Not-Be Named has returned to this country and is active once more. “It is with great regret that I must confirm that the wizard styling himself Lord — well, you know who I mean — is alive and among us again,” said Fudge, looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters. “It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the dementors of Azkaban, who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the Ministry’s employ. We believe that the dementors are currently taking direction from Lord — Thingy.”’
‘Cowering in the changing room,’ Draco jeered, before breaking into a chorus of Weasley is our king to laughs of his team mates.
“Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care of Magical Creatures.
Draco was hurting so badly he kept slipping out of consciousness, but managed to stay awake out of pure spite to furiously watch how Potter, MacMillan and Finch-Fletchley bundled forces to hoist them into a luggage rack.
When Draco saw Potter the next day, the boy looked tormented with guilt as if he had personally pushed Draco into McGonagall’s arms. Draco hated it. He much preferred Potter’s usual cool, fearless look, and wished he would realise it was not his fault, but the fault of that stupid half-giant and that knutless, blood-traitor he kept hanging out with. Draco wished Potter would realise Draco’d been right, back at the start of the year, about chosing his friends more carefully.
For a second, Draco’s stomach clenched. Then Potter seemed to grow three sizes. His hair rose up like an angry cat’s fur, and he lunged himself at Draco. He started pushing and pushing him as if Draco was the source of everything wrong in his life – and Draco had a hard time hiding a smile.
Pansy threw her head in her neck laughing, then grabbed Draco’s face to kiss his forehead. ‘Are you asking me to be your girlfriend, Draconius?’ she shrieked, lifting his chin so he was forced to look at her. ‘Because if you did, I might say yes, you know.’
The question caught Draco off guard. It had just been his birthday, he had gotten everything he wanted.
A crowd of wizards wearing awesome masks, tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward, was marching slowly across the field. High above them, floating along in midair, four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes. It was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air.
‘Prefects should have each other’s back, I think,’ Draco added, ‘and we wondered if there was anything we could do, you know. You see, we could never sleep knowing –’
Draco’d always found it hard to resist Harry Potter’s moxie; not looking at him helped, he’d discovered.
will be the death of the honest pride with which we have always considered you. We would blush to see you, to hear of you, to think of you.’
Draco opened his eyes to see Professor McGonagall coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of books.
Nott had reached up to catch Draco and pushed him back on his own feet again. Draco faltered when Nott flicked the feathery, chestnut hair out of his eyes and gave him a once-over. Nott’s face looked like a perfect little acorn to Draco.
‘Leave him alone,’ said Gregory. It was directed at Pansy – being their leader – who put her hands in the air as if she was innocent.
Warrington resumed hissing and beckoning Draco, who ignored him, until Madam Pince came up to Draco to kindly ask him to talk to "that obnoxious boy in the doorway."
Harry shrugged a few times, as if involuntarily, and seemed to be rehearsing what to say before he found his voice. ‘S-so, eh, is it clean now?’
They were miles above the ground – Harry Potter was falling to his death! A shriek got stuck in Draco’s throat as he closed his hand around Harry’s arm –
Following at his heel were Severus Snape and Professor McGonagall, and Draco allowed himself to feel comforted. Slouching back in his chair he drew another straight line in the air for Zabini.
Draco didn’t pay much attention to it. He knew many of the stories were either exaggerated, one-sided or greatly downplayed by leaving out exactly what had made it such a power move. He noticed other students were doubtful of the Prophet’s information, too. Once or twice, he was certain he overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophet’s version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of Azkaban fortress. In their confusion and fear, though, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them, the one that Potter and Dumbledore had been spreading since the previous year. Draco wondered if he should be worried about this development. He decided to write to his father about it that night.
‘It’s even worse,’ said Nott softly, sitting down next to Crabbe and leaning over to Draco with a knowing look. ‘McGonagall had to go to Dumbledore to get it done. She couldn’t make Umbridge do it herself.’
Draco was telling his friends all about Hagrid’s trial. Things were going perfectly. Father was a great public speaker and would obliterate the competition at this hearing.
Before Draco could think to defend himself, Harry fired. A messy kiss landed on Draco’s upper lip. Tingling all over, a warmth spread from Draco’s face to the entire rest of his body.
Draco frowned at the Quartz, which had taken over the blood red colour. ‘What did you do to my heirloom? I think it’s broken… Unwanted feelings are not supposed to look… pretty.’
Fleur tried a charm to put her Welsh Green-dragon in a trance. It fell asleep, but then it snored as she climbed in the nest to get the egg and a great jet of flame shot out of the dragon’s nose, making her skirt catch fire. She had to put it out with water from her wand.
Malfoy saw Harry looking and muffled the evidence of his drug use behind a large speaker. He slouched unsteadily against the desk. ‘So… What brings you here, Chosen One?’ Harry hadn’t heard that title in a long, long time. ‘Should I get a quill for your questions? Offer tea? Coffee? Biscuits? I don’t have biscuits.’
He came thundering into the parlour, making Draco’s tea spoon rattle on the saucer. ‘You would not believe the stunt that blood traitor pulled this time!’
bloody adopt me now as your charity project, Malfoy,’ he spat. ‘I do not want you to pretend I suddenly make you laugh, or, Merlin forbid, you to suddenly be
Attached to the letter, Draco found a newspaper clipping about Rubeus Hagrid. He remembered a journalist asking questions about their professor during spring break. Scanning the text, he found his name, and he eagerly started reading, smiling already.
Draco didn't notice. ‘Yes, so,’ he picked up his monologue, ‘after all that, I can never quite shake the feeling of being followed.’ He raised his palm to watch the Dark Mark. ‘I can’t run forever.’
‘Kreacher appeared at the manor yesterday,’ his mother said. ‘He is the house-elf of the old Black family, so in a way, he is my house-elf. Can you remember your aunt Walburga? You were very young when we visited her. You showed her your album of Chocolate Frog cards and then forgot to bring it back home. We had to go back for it. Do you remember that?’
Unimpressed, Draco reached behind himself for a quick, deep drag of his blunt. As he got up, he slowly breathed smoke out of his nose. ‘Haven’t you heard, Mr Potter?’ he said hoarsely. ‘I’m always lying.’
Weasley had to hold on to the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughing so hard, while Draco, Vincent and Gregory spun on the spot, staring wildly around.
The dog had been barking the entire time, so Draco conjured a sausage and bacon from the barbecue to appease him, but it didn’t work as well as he’d hoped. He tried to Obliviate the dog’s memory, grabbed its collar and made his way back through the forest in a conjured cloud of smoke. For good measure, Draco pointed his wand at the ground a few times to create a few empty explosions. The dog seemed dizzy.
‘Oh, don't let me get my hopes up, Potter. And after that, I have some regular questions, like why you moved here, what you like about the town, that sort of thing.’
Again, the two moved as one to get on with their day. ‘Chai latte, coming right up,’ said Stanley loudly to divert any suspicion.
‘This is very easy,’ he drawled, looking around. ‘I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it…’ He shared a smirk with Vincent and Gregory. ‘I bet you’re not dangerous at all, are you?’ Draco chatted. ‘Are you, you ugly great brute?’
‘I thought so,’ growled Pansy, face livid, as she stomped back to the Slytherins, who'd waited up for her.
‘Our local Auror Department would be well-advised to lay out their clothes the night before. We, at News Treat Live From New Street, would also like to emphasize the importance of throwing dirty socks in the laundry bin.’
Which he did, when, the next morning, Tracey and Daphne excitedly told him how Professor Umbridge and five Ministry Aurors had tried to arrest Hagrid. Professor McGonagall had come to his rescue, only to be hit in the chest by four stunners at once. The half-giant had then proceeded to knock two Aurors out cold and ran off into the night, never to be seen again. Professor McGonagall was transferred to St. Mungo's.
Harry was still looking like he expected an answer, though, and Draco was quite thrown off his game. ‘You’re such a big deal, Potter,’ he blurted out.
‘Oh no no no, silly boy. We abandoned them on our own accord. You see, in the newly established hierarchy it would benefit us much more to
Draco was still processing what Harry had done, while Zabini’s eyes flicked from one to the other. He was the only one eating, chewing up a salad with great crunching noises. Nott was picking at a sandwich, but seemed rather nauseous. Crabbe and Goyle only ate two or three chicken drumsticks each.
If someone had told Harry back at Hogwarts that he might get a present from Malfoy some day, he would have laughed in their face.
Draco wanted to avoid another uncomfortable chat with their Head of House for as long as he could. Goyle nodded and descended the stairs. Draco turned left to the hospital wing.
At the Hogwarts Express back to school, Draco told Vincent and Gregory all about what happened at the campsite. What was way more interesting though, was the things he’d heard the Beauxbatons students talking about, as he'd finally connected the dots with the other event his father had been talking about. Vincent said he listened in on his father, too, who had been talking about Durmstrang students coming to Hogwarts.
‘No.’ Draco filled two glasses and a jug with water and floated them over to the desk without even looking. Standing straight as a ballerino, he plucked a thick, sealed envelope from the top of the bookcase and flung it dismissively at his chair. ‘Those are the questions that all twelve citizens and their horse sent in for you, Potter. Try to make your answers more interesting than the ones you gave me.’
‘Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm, was first to return with his hostage, though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour.’ Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd. ‘We therefore award him forty-seven points.’
Harry watched him. This Draco-from-the-wireless-show, with the drawing of a tree on his shirt, the headphones around his neck and the little hole in his sock, almost matching the burn hole in his jeans. This bloke who was nervously peering up at Harry from underneath blonde lashes.
Nimbostratus jumped on the Snitch and Pansy snatched up the paper. She too squinted to read Harry’s handwriting. Then her chin dropped. She started to grin. ‘Holy
‘Harry, for Merlin’s sake!’ Draco couldn’t sit anymore and jumped up to pace the tiny space. ‘You are the
Tears of regret burnt behind Harry's eyes. He shook his head. ‘I think I’ve done something horrible.’
To lighten the mood, Mother asked Draco to play them something nice on the violin, so Draco jumped up to get it.
‘Only six weeks until your O.W.L.s,’ said his mother, not looking up from a piece of teal taffeta. ‘Are you prepared?’
His throat hoarse from screaming, Draco had never felt so proud – and so relieved. Harry had gotten through the first task. He had survived – and he had been amazing.
Draco was panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, leaning his entire weight on it. One wrong motion of Potter, and Draco would plunge to his death. It was worth it, he had achieved what he’d wanted: the Snitch had disappeared again, and as a bonus Harry was doubled up on his broom from laughing.
Pointedly ignoring him, Harry picked up the questions. ‘“What’s the best place you lived and why?”’ Harry scratched his cheek. ‘Hmm... I don’t suppose Hogwarts counts?’
‘Alright, alright… It's in my room, though, so I’ll read it to you there. Now, give me a second to finish this, alright?’
The rest of the day passed quietly. They kept their heads down and went to bed early. All in all, it was not a good day for the pureblood children.
The only reason Draco knew time had passed, was because his throat started to bug him. He tried to ignore it, but there was no denying after a while: he really needed a drink.
‘Luna’s over the moon,’ Pansy hissed at him on their way to their first lesson after morning break. ‘She says no copy of The Quibbler ever sold out faster and that her dad’s reprinting. She’s so excited, I don’t think she even noticed how angry I was. She says people seem even more interested in this than in Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. Merlin, I could have jinxed her.’
Nott just scowled and Draco laughed derisively. He got up to put their ingredients in the cauldron, and Nott jumped. ‘Do
His eyes darted to their Head Boy. The guy’d been in their Common Room for three seconds and noticed something Draco had missed in over seven full years.
There was no way he was going to tell anyone this, though. For starters, they would think Draco infinitely weak for being dependant on anything; and second, if everyone knew of its amazing properties, he could most certainly whistle for getting it back.
‘Oh yes, he is a dear friend of ours,’ said Draco’s mother. ‘He teaches Potions at Hogwarts now. Draco is very fond of him, are you not, darling?’
‘OUCH!’ howled Draco, clutching his nose. ‘You OAF!’ Then he roared with laughter, which only got worse when Harry groaned, face flushed, glasses askew and looking mortified. ‘How did you
Malfoy looked over his shoulder, heavy eyelids and a crooked smirk. ‘Now we're talking…’ He blew a cloud of smoke out of the corner of his mouth. ‘What do you propose, Auror Potter?’
A sleeve with mouldy lace cuff was dangling from a cage with a hyperactive owl in it, swaying with the motion of the train. Weasley made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Draco already seized the sleeve and pulled.
‘I’m good with anything, Nottingham,’ Draco drawled, crossing his arms behind his head and balancing his chair on two legs.
Rubbing his crown, he perched himself on top of the corner of the desk, so he could watch Draco in the kitchen.
Clasped between her fingers was something silver and emerald: a badge, with a large P superimposed on the Slytherin snake.
When they crossed the Gryffindors on their way to Charms, Blaise Zabini slammed a fist in the inside of his elbow, snarling, ‘Since when have you been one of the top students in the school, Potter?’
Pansy and Draco swaggered into the Great Hall with the air of busy prefects, pretending to discuss important student business instead of the appearance of their eyes. They settled between their respective friends to eat and, when they were chock-full, turned their ears towards their idiotic headmaster.
By the time his dinner was ready, the show was over. It appeared the station was silent for most of the day. Over the next few days, Harry discovered Malfoy had three shows every day of the week: at eight in the morning, around noon and at eight at night.
Draco glared at Alexander Orlando – seventh year-prefects should’ve known better then to aim wands at third-year celebrities – and pulled Harry out of harm’s way into the corridor outside of the common room.
Draco petted the animal with both hands now. He could feel her breathing underneath his hands, and in an impulse he dropped his entire body against it, closing his eyes.
Just as he was glowering at Granger – who dared to look at him with something resembling pity – the crowd went wild. Whirling around, Draco finally – finally – saw the little head of his homeboy popping up from the water. The boy’s entire body seemed to be reaching for air, making Draco feel suffocated himself.
‘They have no consideration for the parents,’ Mother would loudly complain to anyone willing to listen, which mostly came down to Agatha, the poor owlery ghost. ‘Are we supposed to simply rearrange our entire timetables around their horrible management? Disgraceful.’
‘Malfoy, stop. The bloke saw everything you are and he said “I don’t want this.” He doesn’t care about you; he never did. And frankly, that makes him a jackass. I hate the bloke.’
Before he could think, Draco had jumped up. ‘Oh yeah! You were staying with them this summer, weren’t you, Potter?’ he sneered. ‘So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?’
‘A report of an alarming nature reached me after your last trip to Hogsmeade,’ she told them in her breathy, little-girlish voice. Draco backed away, already thinking of several people who could prove his alibi, when she continued, ‘Your fellow student Harry Potter had met a number of friends in the Hog’s Head in Hogsmeade.’
Harry shuffled his feet and cleared his throat. ‘Er… I er… I use soap. Hair & body soap, a bar. It smells like mint, it leaves no plastic waste, and it’s very cheap. They sell it everywhere, so I can buy it wherever the Ministry relocates me next.’
a six-foot tall Quidditch Captain?’ Draco drawled. ‘Well, has anyone tried insulting Taylor? That usually works to summon him for me.’
‘God, this place is going to the dogs,’ said Draco. ‘That oaf teaching classes, my father’ll have a fit when I tell him –’
‘Maybe I should,’ Draco snarled. ‘Those paintings have more depth than you garbage Parkinsons could ever achieve.'
Holding his breath, Draco clutched his wand and waited for the right Gryffindor to pass him. He needed – Umbridge would need the leader.
‘Never – do – that – again –’ said Moody, speaking each word as Draco hit the stone floor and bounced upward again.
The flick-swoosh of a lighter. Then, a little hum followed by a sharp inhalation, a short moan and a slow release of breath.
Draco nodded. ‘To be fair,’ he said. ‘I’m not looking forward to it either. I can still cancel, then we could – ’
‘Here at News Treat Wireless Station we value your contribution, dear listeners. All of your letters will be read with care... But enough is enough. The point has been received. I am putting it beside me.’
‘Remember, men,’ Montague called, like he was captain of a ship crew instead of an amateur Quidditch team, slapping his hand at the beat of his words, ‘we’re here to analyse their tactics, their strengths and their weaknesses. Note things down if you need to; we will be discussing our findings at our first practice.’
Potter accelerated to catch up with Weasley, who appeared sullen and bleak on this glorious morning. Johnson soared around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowed down to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team.
The nurse shot him a look before scrutinizing the wound once more. ‘Tell me where you see any bone exactly, my dear.’
‘Look, Crabbe, Goyle,’ he said softly as he spread the newspaper on the table in front of them. ‘It worked,’ he hissed, unable to hide his pride. ‘My dad’s been talking about this since summer.’
can answer your questions just as well. Perhaps even better, as I am much more patient and eloquent and interesting.’
‘MALFOY! Boy oh boy, if I spot even one bruise on Jason this Saturday I’ll have Harper replacing you for the rest of the season! I will not hesitate, kid!’
Draco felt nauseous – but he felt excited too. No matter what, Harry Potter had said yes to him. Life was never going to top this. Draco just had to rise to the challenge, as Father would say.
Draco sighed. If he closed his eyes he could still feel Harry’s shoulder against his. He was so nice and warm. Draco was starting to understand that “oozing” Rotilda had mentioned in their first year. Harry Potter oozed warmth; he oozed all sorts of warmth…
His marching footsteps clattered through the deserted dungeons. The other students were still at the Quidditch Field, no doubt talking about him and – No: him
‘Yes,’ Nott finally mumbled, putting his own notes next to Draco’s and grabbing a book. When he moved his chair closer, Draco put down his legs to look over the boy’s shoulder.
,’ Draco said loudly. ‘I could’ve died, you know. If it wasn’t treated properly my arm could’ve fallen off.’
A silence followed those words. Draco looked round at Potter, who had been staring at Draco’s back, but snapped out of it now. ‘Why didn’t you mention that sooner?’
‘Just play Exploding Snap with us,’ Gregory whined, putting the box on the coffee table they were sitting around. ‘We don’t want to follow stupid Potter anymore.’
Nott squinted his calculating eyes at Draco and started stirring. Draco counted along, but each time he wanted to jump up to stir the other way around, the boy already did.
The boy snorted and started walking again. ‘Come on now, before someone spots you. You’re really not supposed to get so close.’
So he went on to search at the Eastern Tower. Along the way, he got slightly lost, because he got distracted: he could swear he saw the Grey Lady, but she never showed herself. There was a reason he usually followed his classmates around through the castle: his mind kept wandering with all those mysteries going on in this castle, and those bloody moving staircases didn’t help…
Draco lowered his hood so he could look Crabbe in the eye. ‘The moment he sees the Snitch, so that Chang can catch it while Potter faints.’
‘Lost your way already, Scarhead?!’ yelled a sixth-year Slytherin, and the crowd roared with laughter.
‘You can choose the traditions you want to follow. That is all I’m trying to say.’ Snape sat up straight to gather the leaflets in a neat pile. ‘Do you have any further questions for me?’
‘It’s our old Cousin Ferdinand’s secret stash! Oh, come now, little prude, feast your pretty eyes. I know you want to.’
‘Eat dung, Malfoy!’ said Weasley, the same colour as the dress robes, as he snatched them back out of Draco’s grip.
‘Oh, yes,’ his father agreed. ‘The last reason we are worried about the Dark Lord’s return, Draco, is the most important one. During the Golden Days we had only ourselves to care for, but receiving the miraculous gift of a fragile, new life changed us.’ Father grabbed Draco’s chin. ‘
Harry’s hand slid under Draco’s shirt entirely now, forming figures on his skin with his fingers. Draco closed his eyes and nuzzled into Harry’s shoulder.
Draco wanted to hide or laugh or – hug? Discomfort and delight were fighting for the upper hand within him.
It was easy enough to find him these days; he and his friends were practically living in the library. The only things Granger knew came from books, and apparently she had free reign in their friend group. The three of them sat huddled around a pile of books on a small desk. The golden egg sat on Harry’s lap, one of his arms protectively around it.
Draco hardly noticed the disgusted faces of the other Gryffindors. Harry kept looking away from him.
, that’s for, you know… boho’s,’ and that was putting it nicely. Harry felt nice against Draco’s shoulder. ‘I mean: my family would not approve of the lifestyle, you see.’
‘Those of you who have managed to read the instructions,’ called Snape with a nasty look at sad little Potter, ‘fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing. Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.’
Longbottom whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. ‘Take him up to the hospital wing,’ Snape spat at some poor Gryffindor. Then he rounded on Harry. ‘You – Potter – why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor.’
Harry blinked and recoiled. ‘Oh… Yeah, of course.’ He scratched his neck and turned on his heel. ‘Right, I’ll be going then. Need to find this Sandra person…’
Startled and sulking, Pansy beckoned their friends and they all left him alone. Draco glared at their backs as he cleaned the floor. ‘
With a jolt the memories of last night came back to him and a feeling of jittery warmth spread through Draco’s body. It had been wonderful – good lord, had it been wonderful – but… they were definitely not supposed to still be there.
Even while calculating their Arithmancy homework, Draco still had enough mind space left to worry about Harry. ‘Do
Harry was in a t-shirt, leaving most of his arms bare. He was sweating a little, as they all were, but instead of filthy, it made his skin look glistening. The tips of his hair stuck to his forehead.
‘You know I haven’t, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?’ snapped Draco. ‘And Father won’t tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it’ll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing – last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it’s a matter of time before one of them’s killed this time…  I hope it’s Granger,’ he added with relish. ‘She keeps beating me in Potions.’
Thankfully, Malfoy didn’t seem to pay attention to him. He was playing with the levers on the soundboard. ‘Say something else.’
Snape was still fixing him with his gaze. ‘I know as your Hogwarts Professor I might be the last person you would turn to, but I want you to know you can trust me.’
‘You know I do, old sap,’ he said. ‘I mean, I can’t exactly ask mummy and daddy why I got a kick out of being smacked around by Potter, can I? It’s the latest step in my descent into lunacy, apparently.’
Barney lowered himself so his face was inches from Draco’s. ‘Drakey, you were over the moon with this boy. Only a few months ago, you told me you wanted to marry him. Then the war broke out, all your friends and family told you they hated him and dished up all sorts of reasons why you should too, and on top of that, your parents said they would prefer you never existed if you liked this boy. Oh,
‘My mother told me all about you and your no-good family,’ she snarled at him. ‘You’re not worth my spit and you
Harry’s chair clattered to the floor when he leaped up, and a faint smirk pulled at Draco’s lips. ‘At ease, soldier.’
For probably the first time in his life, Draco did not complain. Mainly because he would die of humiliation if anyone even pictured him sitting alone in the dark, waiting for a stupid celebrity. Pansy and her girls picked up on something though. Or rather, Tracey did.
hungry. It is pathetic. He faints when he goes without food for two hours.’ Draco laughed derisively, wildly ignoring the fact that he just made up a bunch of complete falsehood.
Draco covered his face when Marcus Flint had blocked Harry, and Harry's broom spun off course, trying very hard to fling Potter away.
Jason the Mudblood was getting on Draco’s nerves. Every day Draco watched him bop his head or tap his feet, because he was listening to music with his Muggle devices, while Draco couldn’t hear a single note.
A light appeared in Potter’s eyes. ‘Oh no, you wouldn’t like it,’ he said after a second of careful consideration, his voice slow and hoarse as ever. ‘We don’t want to frighten you by looking at the scary snakes, getting you nightmares, now, do we?’ At last, Harry let go of Draco’s hand to pat his head. ‘So don’t go breaking your pretty little head over grown-up stuff, Draconius, having silly dreams of doing things that are much too difficult for you. Best to stay safely in bed, listen to mummy and daddy and let the sweet nurse take care of you.’
It was nice to have something else to focus on. Not being allowed to move was incredibly difficult and demanded most of Draco’s attention.
Leaning against the desk, sipping whiskey, Harry watched him go. ‘And whose fault is that? I never fight with anyone else, you know.’
‘I heard she invented a spell to counter Fiendfyre,’ Imogen Stratton one-upped Bulstrode’s statement.
But the scream of delight came from the Slytherins’ end: Weasley had dived wildly, his arms wide, and the Quaffle had soared between them and straight through Weasley’s central hoop.
Pansy dropped her act like a stone. ‘He is not, you blithering fool. It has nothing to do with you. You
Draco nodded, his face contorted in a proud grin. Sighing heavily, he grabbed Pansy’s face and pushed their foreheads together. ‘He wants to go with
Draco threw him a look. ‘Well, I’m not blind, if that’s what you mean,’ he snarled, ‘but apart from that… I have been completely wrong about him. He is rotten to the core and everyone saw it except for me.’
Smirking, Draco leaned across the table to Potter to seize the largest Bowtruckle. ‘Maybe,’ he said in an undertone, so that only Potter could hear him, ‘the stupid great oaf’s got himself badly injured.’
Potter did not get Draco’s drift. Draco relished in the boy’s confusion and the way his mouth tried to form words he couldn’t find. As he swaggered off, Draco couldn’t help looking over his shoulder one more time, smirking at Potter’s frown.
‘You could do a stake out,’ said Desirée excitedly. ‘I think they’ll come somewhere in the morning. After five and before twelve. Stan can make you coffee in a thermos! Do you know “thermos”-technology, Mr Potter? They’re Muggle cups that keep your drink warm without the magic wearing off!’
Draco looked up at his friends in helpless terror, but only saw his own fright and revolt mirrored on their faces.
Bloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century. The handful that remained joined the ranks of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and were responsible for a few of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of terror. If his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide, however, Fridwulfa’s son appears to have inherited her brutal nature.
There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day. They were playing Gryffindor that weekend and the entire team was dreading it.
Three people raised their hands: Warrington, Harper and the teeny-tiny first-year girl who had held Draco's sleeve on the first day of school. Snape ordered them to follow him to his office, and as soon as the wall closed behind them, the common room exploded again.
‘Allow me to properly wake up before insulting me,’ Draco wrote back, before getting dressed and descending the stairs to get a bit of breakfast.
‘Do you want to tell it?’ she asked Pansy, but Pansy shook her head, so Daphne said, ‘She’s at the hospital wing, apparently completely in shock. Dumbledore had to rescue her from the centaurs. He had to carry her back – can you imagine? The old man carrying that fat toad? How embarrassing! She had all these bits of twig and leaf in her hair and looked like she’d just seen a ghost. She hasn’t said a word since.’
‘You’ve got some nerve, Potter!’ Draco snarled, jumping out of his chair in case he needed to defend his homeboy against his house mates.
‘Her father owns the Quibbler. My dad hates him with a passion. She believes in Nargles and Snorkacks.’ Draco shared a look with Pansy, and concluded: ‘Loony.’
The posh way Draco pronounced "gosh" still made Harry melt, and he reached out to touch him – but didn’t dare to in the end. He pretended it had been his plan all along to lean his hand on the desk.
Something jabbed at Draco’s insides. ‘Tell me about it,’ he drawled to drown out his thoughts. ‘The last time he lost something, that poor Hufflepuff died and he told everyone the Dark Lord had risen from the dead to do it.’
Reading it made the time pass faster, but still, at every sound, his head shot up and his heart jolted. Yet every time, he was disappointed when it turned out to be an owl or a cat, or the wind, making the door creak, or the ancient tower just slowly falling apart. Draco wished it got on with it. The tower collapsing would at least spare him from sitting out the rest of this lonely, miserable life.
That evening, after Crabbe finished copying the entire map of the castle, Draco dragged the bundle of parchments over to the table where Nott was sitting. Plucking the quill out of the boy’s pristine hands, Draco dropped the parchments smack on top of Nott’s books.
This Harry was taller than the real one, Draco noted. He looked down on Draco with mock compassion, shaking his head. ‘That is so weird.’ He frowned, suddenly looking awkward. ‘I love Cho, you know that, right?’
And that was all the answers Draco got. He reckoned he really wasn’t in love, though. How could he be, if he never wanted to overly touch The Boy Who Lived, or go to bed and wake up with him, for the rest of his life, and the terrifying way people described being in love in books was not how Draco felt about Harry Potter at all. Thinking about him as his boyfriend frankly just made him want to crawl away.
He might have imagined it, but Harry thought he saw curtains moving on his way home; heads quickly retreating from windows or behind walls. Was he getting paranoid? News Treat couldn’t possibly have many listeners. As a news show it was completely worthless.
Draco clapped his hands. ‘Enough yammering, Nottingham, get back to the party – Oh! But can you walk?’ he simpered with a feeble voice. ‘How inconsiderate, let me call someone to carry you! Shoulder the burden of your fragile frame!’
How is mum? I am doing well, although there is a weird vibe in the school since the end of the Triwizard Task. Looking forward to seeing you in a few days.
Harry watched his own shuffling feet on the floor. The soft fingers on his arm felt hypnotizing. ‘Yeah…’
Draco felt like Christmas came early. Theodore just handed him all of his peeves on one neat golden platter. It was too good an opportunity to miss.
‘You can’t always be lying when you say you always lie,’ snarled Harry. ‘You’d be telling the truth.’
‘Well, he’s not wrong,’ Draco grumbled. Pansy shot him a warning look, and Draco loudly corrected, ‘He’s clearly deranged.’
‘It's your job, yes,’ sneered Malfoy. ‘Tell me, Potter, did you ever make a major life decision for yourself?’
popped into his brain… Father also said: “Where emotions run high, profits run high.” There was always a way to financially exploit people’s hearts. He could abuse his fellow students’ anger – and then, after this was all over, he could treat Harry to something expensive.
His father wasn’t listening; Mr. Crabbe had come in to greet him and they’d launched into a classic pureblood politeness script, filled with “I hope he behaved” and “The pleasure was all ours” and every variation of the two.
The only two students who’d witnessed the scene in Dumbledore’s office were a Ravenclaw girl and, inevitably, the Boy Who Lived – and as the Ravenclaw girl was in the hospital wing for mysterious reasons, Potter was, again, surrounded by fans wherever he went in hopes of hearing the story first-hand. It made Draco want to vomit all over the guy.
‘Bit of a weird one, I suppose, but… You know, sometimes I think it pulled me out of my depression more than the potions did. On bad days I just blasted it on repeat, just that one song over and over, back to back. Until I could breathe again and think. Think about stuff like… taking a shower or making food… It was all so heavy, back then, to do basic human tasks, but that song… It just lightens my life somehow. Those cheery backing vocals and that…’ He glanced up with a sigh and a moan. ‘That guitar solo, please, just… just fuck me up.’
He’d been staring at the pieces for minutes now while Nott smirked smugly. Draco refused to admit defeat, but the exhaustion after the match and the fight were taking a toll on him.
Draco worried his lip. He wondered if his father had anything to do with this. He glanced at the teacher’s table, where Professor Snape was sipping tea and reading the Prophet with an unreadable face.
A week later, Vincent, Gregory and Draco were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the noticeboard, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up. With an irritated face, Pansy’d turned her back to it, rolling her eyes almost out of her head at all the excited kids pushing each other to get a closer look.
,” it blasted through the speakers,’ said Draco, ‘followed by something about our local Auror Department being spotted at some gala last weekend. Hermione just smiled at my confusion and explained to me what had happened, how it could be that the wireless had turned on by itself. So, well, as it turns out, dear listeners…’ There was a silence, followed by a soft wail. ‘Ooh, it’s terribly embarrassing. Absolutely typically me. I'm mortified, I feel so incredibly stupid… But okay. I will tell you.’
Over the back of the desk chair – which was worn from wear around the edges – hung a shirt that Malfoy pulled on. The cannabis smell came from a big, brown blunt, smoking on an ashtray next to a bag of weed, a razorblade and a package of brown wraps.
As Pomfrey prepared potions, Draco healed the cuts and bruises of his friends and bandaged them up the way Pomfrey’s books described. He assisted her with the more difficult treatments and she showed him how to un-Stun someone, even allowing Draco to try it. It didn’t work, but she said it was like loosening the lid of a jar for her and that he was of great help.
He was halfway done already when Snape’s icy voice broke the silence. ‘Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is, Miss Granger, I must ask you not to discuss it in my lesson. Ten points from Gryffindor.’
The Quidditch cup would quietly pass them by this year when it had seemed so close only weeks ago when Gryffindor lost match after match.
The cup of tea shook in Draco's hands, rippling the surface like giants were walking the hallways. Harry was a boy, Draco thought, and a boy was not a suitable match for the only Malfoy heir. And Harry was a Gryffindor. And he was famous. And –
Mr Potter likes to go for his morning jog, we, at News Treat Live From New Street, might be tempted to follow his lead... Or we could at least decide to take the scenic route to Christie’s Coffee on the Corner – the best café latte for the sweetest price! Regardless, for future updates on our local Auror Department, please provide a clear description of what the auror in question was wearing, as detailed as possible, so our listeners can make a well-informed decision on their morning routine. And again, if any of you have information on the suspicious activity going on here in Brookley, please send it to us. We will be happy to pass it on to the local Auror Department. Who knows? If we all band together to help, Harry Potter might have a chance of becoming The Hero of Next Thursday.’
‘A few people never lost faith that he would come back,’ said his mother. ‘Aunty Bel certainly never did.’
‘Yeah?’ Harry’s head shot up, looking endlessly vulnerable, and Draco felt suddenly very protective.
asked, but Draco generally wore people out, so they treasured the time Draco wasn’t talking to them, and they specifically never pressed the matter after he started a rant about the renown of the Yule Ball in contrast with the Malfoy standard. Half the time, Draco himself didn’t even know what he was talking about. Scaring people off came naturally to him.
Her glimmering charm got absolutely marvellous over the years, though, he couldn’t deny that. Humming happily, Draco stretched his legs on the bed while she went over them with her wand. He wiggled his toes. ‘You sure you’re not staying? You’ll miss out on me looking
When Draco walked in with Vincent and Gregory, he spotted Harry Potter already sitting halfway down the classroom – next to that nasty Weasley. Draco didn’t understand the Weasley’s appeal. If Harry’d been sorted in Slytherin, the bloodtraitor would have dropped him like a stone.
When Draco got to a particularly difficult question, he put the book down to mull it over, but Potter seemed to see it as encouragement and wrapped his arms tightly around Draco’s waist, pressing their bodies together.
‘Ancient history, sir,’ Draco scoffed. ‘I want him to die a gruesome death.’ Snape raised his eyebrows and quickly, Draco added, ‘Sir.’
As inconspicuous as they could, they made a huge detour, checking every corner to see if the coast was clear, and eventually managed to reach the stands without being seen. Hidden beneath the stands, Marcus kept peeking out of the cloak to see what happened, while Malfoy strained to make out Lee Jordan’s commentary.
Finally, she allowed Draco to go to his lesson. He was only slightly late, which was actually better, he thought, because he’d be able to make a big entrance that way. As he swaggered into the dungeon, Pansy jumped up.
Montague snatched Draco’s wand away, eyes spitting fire. ‘I’d certainly like to see you try! Your precious Dark Lord killed my dad in round one! Now get your arse to class and if I hear anything about you threatening –’
He strode away from them into the forest and out of sight, leaving the class alone for minutes on end.
‘Shut up, Dra,’ Harry hissed, pushing down a grin. He sat down on top of the table, so his head was level with Draco’s. ‘Why are you like this?’
The bloodied ghost of Geralt Malfoy picked up on the vibe at once. Snapping to attention, he drew his sword to guard the family’s back as they made their way to the manor.
He got up. ‘I’m going to take a shower,’ he let Crabbe and Goyle know. ‘And maybe go to the library after. You go on, I’ll be back before bed.’
As the Gryffindors continued their practice, Draco spotted the Snitch, not even a second before Potter did. He clenched his fists when Potter dived, but right then, Johnson’s whistle sounded
She ducked away when Draco tried to kick her in the face. ‘As if! Who do you think you’re dealing with here, little orphan Annie?! I’m not wearing the same dress robes twice!’
Harry had tried not to listen to the wireless anymore, and most days, he succeeded. Some days, though, he didn’t, and it hurt him. It hurt to hear Draco joke and sneer and laugh and growl, and to have that final pop-krrg-silence tear it all away again. And again. And again.
Potter ripped open a letter, read it, then handed it to Weasley. They both looked thrilled, but they didn’t open the package. Instead, they hurriedly left, leaving their breakfast behind, but taking the package with them.
Draco braced himself, feeling inexplicably victorious, when Potter drew back the fist that was clutching the Snitch –
‘Anyway,’ his father lazily continued, ‘the Dark Lord’s lone task did not go as planned, as you well know from the history books. We went to bed without a worry and woke up to Aurors banging at the gate. Our trusted friends had turned on us the second the Dark Lord vanished, and us Malfoys were left to pick up the pieces.’
A sharp pain shot through Draco’s face, running from his nose straight down his spine, drawing a wince from him.
As he watched, Pansy’s mouth fell open in shock. ‘YOU are pressuring me!’ Draco heard her shrill screams all the way across the lawn. ‘You are pressuring me, mum!’
‘Draco, darling, who are you talking to?’ Draco’s mother’s loud heels clattered on the parquet of the conservatory next to the mudroom, and even if she’d worn fluffy socks, her sharp question would’ve echoed all through the manor.
The other Slytherins were livid. Draco flinched when his teammates swarmed over to him as one man, until he started making out their words:
‘And I – innocent, naïve, little me – asked Hermione: “But he never really listens to it… right?” My heart was in my throat, listeners, you have no idea. “Ooh he does,” said Hermione happily; bless her heart, “He even bought a wireless for his office too – and he records the shows he likes.” “Really?” I said, very inconspicuously if I say so myself. I asked her, “Has he always been such a wireless fan?” And she said, “Oh no, he told us it’s for the case.
Was he ever just going to stay for a chat? Did he even ever want to talk to Draco without some agenda, Draco wondered. And he wasn’t even going to start racking his brain about what he was laughing about. At least Draco made him laugh, that must count for something, right?
Grinning, Harry put his hands in Draco’s back pockets and pressed half a dozen kisses all over his lips.
The bag of weed Harry had been trying to confiscate slipped through his fingers in shock. ‘Huh, you want to do an interview?’
Settling himself safely between his mother and father, Draco felt suddenly glad for their second row seats. At least he didn’t have to feel everyone’s eyes in his neck. He was going to have a great time, he solemnly resolved.
.’ Draco held a treat in front of him and kept begging until the owl gave in, but it was clear that Draco had to come up with a better way to talk to Potter. There were not enough owls in the world to message him continuously like this. There was also no way he could go and visit him with the Muggles, and Harry probably had no transportation to the manor. Either they had to write long letters and wait forever for a reply or Draco had to figure something out.
‘Ah of course. Well, the Dark Lord’s powers did not disappoint,’ Father continued. ‘He kept every promise he had made when we joined, it was unbelievable. He showed extraordinary abilities, many of which were thought impossible, and he very quickly earned the reputation of the most powerful and dangerous dark wizard of all time, surpassing even Gellert Grindelwald. Me and my friends got front row views of all the marvels he accomplished. He found out what my father had done to the Prime Minister – which had greatly paved the way for our cause – and he asked me to be his second in command; the greatest honour a Death Eater could receive. It was the best time of our lives, was it not, my heartbeat?’
Draco spelled the grass to be dry and warm before sitting down opposite them. ‘What are we supposed to do with these little buggers?’
Draco wanted nothing more than to tousle that silky hair, but Nott grabbed his arm to haul him out of the common room. It reminded Draco of that time on the Hogwarts Express, when he’d dragged Nott off to the Head People to get his mouth fixed.
With the hood of his cloak over his head, Draco tried to pull himself together, but fifteen minutes was hardly enough time to do that. Sounds on the carriage-steps made him brace himself.
Even their own marble royalty Blaise Zabini deigned to look around at Draco. ‘What are you on about?
Harry had fucked up, thoroughly fucked it all up. They’d been so close to becoming… something – And now…
This line of Draco’s father, I have to confess, was shamelessly inspired by Jane Austen’s Lady Susan. I thought it was so horrible, I couldn’t help hurting Draco with it too.
him to bother; he wanted to be done with him. He didn’t want Harry anymore. He didn’t want to want Harry anymore.
Whenever Draco needed her, Pansy’d pretend to be deaf, but as soon as she saw him hiding away, she’d be over in a heartbeat.
Slowly, Draco picked it up, took it in for a few seconds, then held it out to Pansy, as if she was the expert on prefect badge authenticity.
‘Who knows,’ Draco drawled, turning away as casually as he could manage. ‘Even a Niffler couldn’t find a coin in there… I guess I dozed off… could you read any slower?’
‘Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straight away, I went to ask her first thing this morning. Well, it was pretty much automatic, I mean, she knows my father really well, he’s always popping in and out of the Ministry.’ He leered at Potter and Weasley. ‘It’ll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, won’t it?’
Harry snorted, rubbing his neck in embarrassment. He really had made an arse of himself in front of the whole town.
Malfoy scowled at him. ‘I’m not up to something, Potter,’ he sneered, ‘if that’s what you mean. Or is it illegal now to run a local news station?’
It disgusted Draco. Not only was he stealing Potter away when Draco had been first to spot him; not only had his filthy pet wounded Potter; but now he
As he said it, he was already writing Harry’s address on one of the cards and his own address on the other. He’d chosen the
‘Come on, Zabini,’ Draco snarled, picking out a bag of Chocolate Frogs and Pumpkin Pasties, ‘I’d never associate with Mudbloods.’
‘Get your hands off me! There’s plenty of other questions to answer. Look, I put them there! Don’t bloody touch me!’
‘You did,’ Draco snapped, jumping at his own words. ‘Excuse me, sir. I just–’ He took a breath, his voice dropping to barely above a whisper. ‘Well... actually... Professor, did you tell my parents last summer? I mean, about me and, you know… Crimson...sir?’
At once, Pansy leaned across the table to grab Draco’s face between her hands. ‘Stay strong, darling. You can do it. Remember: you’re a Malfoy, and he’s a dweeb; a well-known drag.’
The way down to the dungeon was deserted, but when he burst into the Slytherin common room, he was greeted with half a dozen Slytherins recovering from last night – and Draco was still wearing his dress robes.
‘Absolutely,’ said Harry. ‘Most of the people are very friendly. I just wish they’d help me with my case.’
Draco lifted his eyebrows. At last Harry had actually come to ask Draco, like he had hoped so long ago.
‘Rather not. Look, mister, you can’t stay here forever. I bet you feel better after you eat, you know I always do. Remember when I tried intermittent fasting and I wrecked my room? That’s you right now. You always love the welcoming feast, right? You said you gained three pounds after the one last year. Primrose eats buckets of ice cream when she’s lovesick and it always works.’
Draco peeked through his fingers and caught Snape casting him a calculating look. Eventually, his professor settled on, ‘Your son is a joy to have in class.’
Draco sneered and motioned for Vincent and Gregory to follow him. As they turned into the next passage, Draco said, ‘That Peter Weasley –’
‘Right then,’ said Hagrid, ‘now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow me over here a moment.’
‘It’s none of your business who I talk to,’ he snarled, his green eyes flickering from under the shadows of his eyebrows. His robes were hanging from one shoulder, exposing his t-shirt underneath and the muscles in his arms.
Still sulking, Draco sank down in the windowsill, putting his feet up in the air. ‘I want a Nimbus Two Thousand like Harry Potter.’
Draco, in fact, did not go to take a shower, nor did he go to the library. Instead, he sneaked out of the castle, staying close to the forest’s edge to keep out of sight of anyone who might be looking out of the window. He hurried over to the dragon’s disclosure they’d walked past that afternoon. From afar he could see the glow of fire over the treetops, illuminating clouds of smoke.
‘The general standard of this homework was abysmal,’ said Snape. ‘Most of you would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week’s essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get a D.’
‘I see,’ said Harry softly, trying to keep the triumph out of his voice. ‘Can you tell me where I can find this wireless station, please? It might be helpful to get in touch with them.’
Potter rolled on his side to gaze at Draco, stroke the hair from his face or touch his nose or his lashes. When Potter was staring at him like that, Draco couldn’t even meet his eyes; he would certainly die of euphoria if he tried. So he shifted a little, got up on an elbow and cupped Potter’s face to kiss him a bit more. It was the weirdest thing how he didn’t get bored of something so idiotic as moving his lips against this specific boy’s ones. He would only let them go to quickly bite Harry’s nose, but got back to kissing immediately after. In return, Harry pulled away to bite Draco’s lip – and Draco’s eyes rolled back with delight. Before he could prevent it, even a moan escaped him. Thinking fast, he dramatically spread an arm and fell back on the stuffy library carpet, burying a hand in his hair. ‘You are killing me, Mister Potter.’
secrets before she could spill his. Somehow, though, he managed to recall that Pansy was his most important friend.
Though the stage was empty, both their heads shot up when a new energetic song started with a bang. Before Draco could think, his body responded to the beat.
It is bad form to refer to a person as “that guy,” no matter their standing. I did, however, run into your friend, to answer your question, taking me quite by surprise, I must say. At the time, he was with that old friend of mine, so I didn’t pay him much mind. They both looked surprisingly healthy, I dare say, given their circumstances. Me and my friend had quite a pleasant chat actually. Much of our old quarrels are water under the bridge these days. It was unfortunate, however, that your friend had to leave rather abruptly, but we might bump into him again to finish our conversation.
He smirked as Harry snatched the page, unfolded and read it, with his Gryffindor buddies all looking over his shoulder.
Blood stained Draco’s hands – Potter’s blood. ‘Harry, for Merlin’s sake, what did you do?’ Falling on his knees, he dragged Harry’s head on his legs and pressed his forehead against Potter’s. ‘I love you.’
Some part of Draco felt like laughing derisively at Potter’s dumb conclusion, but that would only give him away.
When Draco fell into step, it occurred to him how good it felt. Over the course of the morning he’d started feeling as at ease as when he was wearing the pendant, and even though they were on a boring, fruitless quest, he was enjoying himself.
you! Merlin, I still bloody hate you! I asked you for one thing! One bloody interview, and you can’t even stay civil long enough to manage that! Never had to honour a single rule, did you, so why start now, right?! The mighty Harry Potter can get away with anything he pleases! Well, get away with this, scarhead! I
Fifteen minutes later, Snape arranged his essays and got up. Summoning a ladle, he fished the ring out of the potion and Draco sat up straight in anticipation. When Snape closed his fingers around the ring, a satisfied smirk crossed his face.
Draco wiped his mouth and quickly scribbled. ‘You wouldn’t have this problem if you’d let the basilisk get on with it.’
in the wine section of Al’s Grocery store last evening.’ Draco let out a long and melodious hum. ‘Well well well…’
Looking over his shoulder to see if no one was listening, Draco confessed, ‘My aunt is a boho, you know. Well, she was before– When she was younger, I mean.’
‘Yeah, your book!’ Draco was shouting through the library, at the Saviour of the Wizarding World no less – this would not earn him any brownie points. ‘Dammit,’ he muttered, falling back in his chair.
As it was, he stood alone for a while longer, feeling less cheerful than before Potter had come along.
‘Harry Potter’ – Draco's voice through the wireless broke off the song Harry'd been listening to ‘– will be joining us tomorrow evening for an exclusive interview.’
But he didn’t, Draco reminded himself. He couldn’t. It didn’t make sense. Potter could snog a different admirer every day for an entire year if he wanted to – what was he talking about,
Harry laughed with his eyes closed; it was Draco’s favourite, he only ever laughed like that when he was truly carefree. Taking advantage of that moment of weakness, Draco jumped on him like a fox, so Harry toppled on his back and got covered in kisses before he could open his eyes or catch his breath. He didn’t seem to mind. In one swift move, Draco pulled off Harry’s shirt. He’d planned to go a lot further, until he remembered they were still in a public place.
That night, Draco’s parents burst through the double doors like a hurricane, causing Madam Pomfrey, who had been spooning some pastel pink liquid into a first year’s open mouth, to shriek in alarm.
Time to start healing, he told himself. He didn’t need Madam Pomfrey for that, and he certainly didn’t need some celebrity – a
The cunning thing to do, Draco thought, would be pretending to tell his father everything, but keeping the most important information to himself... But to convince his father, he probably had to spill a lot of secrets about Harry Potter.
‘Ask them!’ Draco ran down the steps to the dungeons. He felt Pansy’s hand reaching for his arm, but pulled away. ‘Piss off, I’m not sick.’
'If they don’t lose against Hufflepuff,' roared Flint, 'it means we didn’t bully them enough! Go forth and devastate!’
Draco slouched against the bookshelves, still vividly remembering Potter's Parseltongue-demonstration. The snake had looked up to Harry as if he was its general in command.
‘As you know, my necklace has been missing for quite some time now,’ Draco started. ‘I can imagine someone has found it and has been using it. It is, after all, a very helpful Malfoy heirloom. They should know, however, that using it is not without risk. The necklace should be cleansed every few days by someone who knows what they’re doing, otherwise the wearer could slowly descend into lunacy. I’d rather have the necklace back so I can clean it properly than see a fellow student lose their mind, and that way find out they’re a thief.’
Draco steered well clear of her for the rest of the day. When Vincent, Gregory and Draco left for Hogsmeade, Filch, the caretaker, was standing inside the front doors at the entrance hall, checking off names against a long list, peering suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out who shouldn’t be going.
Hurting even more than the smack around his face, was the fact that Harry Potter hadn’t even noticed Draco ignoring him.
Hagrid’s smile faded off his face. ‘Yeh’ll do wha’ yer told,’ he growled, ‘or I’ll be takin’ a leaf out ta Professor Moody’s book… I hear yeh made a good ferret, Draco.’
And for some reason they all started blowing raspberries while turning their thumbs down, whenever they passed him. It wasn’t threatening or insulting, but it didn’t make Draco feel any better too. No matter how silly they showed it, the hate was real. Draco sucked.
Mother watched, and she called for a clean set of robes and for the hair brush she got from her mother-in-law.
‘I suppose you can move it yourself,’ mused Stanley, ‘after they empty it on Wednesday morning. You could go in the afternoon.’
Vincent, Gregory and Draco headed up from their dormitory, discussing what they would get for breakfast. Nimbostratus was jumping on the specks of sunlight reflected through the lake’s water on the common room floor, when they noticed an addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people.
‘Then why is Potter with them?’ Draco blurted out desperately before he could stop himself. Thankfully no one spited him; in fact, all his friends seemed equally curious.
‘Wouldn’t it be lovely,’ jabbered Draco, ‘to see the local Fire Department opening up their doors for one time only, to let you take a ride on one of those bright and shiny Firebolt Pros? I know we’ve all seen enough fire for our lifetimes, but who would say no to a Firebolt Pro ride with the local Fire Department? Enter now for a chance to win.’
Draco tried to read the man’s face, but only found genuine curiosity and concern there. For some reason, it made him blurt out what happened after the Malfoys’ dinner with Professor Snape. It was the first time he opened up to anyone about the talk he had with his parents.
Harry nodded. Draco thought he looked tired. For a second he even wondered why, then he remembered Harry Potter had been out all night in an attempt to fight Draco, who had been sleeping like a rose the whole time.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year, however, Hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of Care of Magical Creatures teacher, over the heads of many better-qualified candidates.
‘Oh, those kids,’ said Mrs Evergreen with a grumpy shake of her head. ‘They all want to ride the trains and none of them have a ticket.’
Draco shared a derisive smirk with Pansy, who patted Zabini’s arm in mock sympathy. ‘Of course you are.’
‘Must be a relief to you, Dory,’ he taunted, ‘knowing you don’t need any brains to become headmaster.’
‘We are an ancient family,’ Draco’s father wrote, ‘and we make more donations in a month than the Ministry can collect through taxes in a year. We are a well-established name in Ministry circles. It is going to take a little more to get the Malfoys into trouble than some unhinged child filling the local rag of a delusional fool with some crackpot story. Of course, people have asked us questions, but they merely seek affirmation that the boy is lying, which I can provide effortlessly. “The child also claims he can talk to snakes,” I tell them, and they immediately back away, apologizing.’
Harry rubbed his face. ‘I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have drank so much. I can never just have one drink.’
‘Potter left with them, we know it,’ he snapped as soon as they were out of earshot. ‘Why did they take him with them? He’s not related and they didn’t take Granger.’
‘What he fears most is probably his Muggle family,’ he babbled. ‘You see, they abused him his entire childhood. It makes him hate small spaces and he’s
Draco tried very hard, but failed, not to look at Potter on the other side of the dungeon, who was sliding his moonstone essay back into his bag in rather the same way Zabini had done. Draco’s smirk grew bigger.
‘Of course, if it was me,’ Draco said quietly, ‘I’d have done something before now. I wouldn’t be staying in school like a good boy, I’d be out there looking for him.’
Draco let her babble. He felt far too miserable to respond. He was reliving the conversation with Harry.
‘And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,’ said Umbridge, pointing at Potter and Granger with her wand. ‘Lead on…’
She wiped down the surface of the table in between them with a Scourgify. 'And that is my official diagnosis.'
As if it was meant to make him look manly! It was his support system, his safety net. It held him up in these dire times of need.
Weasley, who had pelted towards the ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on his broom, and returned to playing height with a red face.
And whenever he had to leave the common room, Pansy, Vincent and Gregory would surround him like a posse. Vincent, the largest of them all, would walk in the front to block Draco’s view, giving Pansy and Gregory time to block Draco’s sides or steer him away from ‘the threat’ if necessary. Draco considered it a little overkill, but was grateful anyway. Surely, he’d forget all about the Boy Who Lived after not seeing him for a couple of days.
Poppy and Periwinkle were born only a year apart and everyone always asked if they were twins. It made them furious. To be fair, almost everything made those two furious. The only moments they were happy were when they could practice gymnastics in the garden. Slightly two-dimensional, if you asked Draco, but they were not yet ten. There was still hope.
The wizarding wireless came to life with the usual creak and pop, disturbing the peace at Brookley’s local auror office.
Something flared up behind his father’s eyes. ‘I do not tell lies, Draco. Your precious idol befriended a
Draco and Vincent sat down near Snape’s desk at the front of the dungeon. Leaning his chin on his arms, Draco peeked at his homeboy, who appeared to be imploding with fury at his lone table.
Deliberating his options for a second, Draco reckoned it couldn’t hurt to oblige. He took a large bite of the pie as he sat down on the armrest of the chair.
‘Not if you want to live, darling,’ said Pansy. With a malicious smile she added, ‘Go try it on Potter.’ She looked like an evil genius, stroking Nimbostratus and smiling like that.
Warm blood ran from Draco’s nose down to his lips, he felt it cover his chin and dry up in his neck. As he tried to sit up, his throbbing face felt swollen and his ribs stung with every move.
‘None of us is sure anymore either,’ whispered Desirée. ‘There are just so many rumours going around.’
Harry passed Snape, walked to the back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto a table. He looked ready to kill, Draco noticed fondly. Oh, how he would die to see Potter kill…
.’ Draco tugged playfully at Nott’s hair. 'You’re my second in command.’ Nott frowned at him, a smile in his eyes, but Draco’s mind drifted. He dropped his hands. ‘Right… I should learn Occlumency.’
There was a howling noise, like an animal in pain and Snape started running. When they burst into the bathroom, the whole Inquisitorial Squad turned to look at them. Draco and Snape shouldered through the group until they reached the toilet.
Someone who didn’t lose her temper was Granger. ‘Stunningly pretty? Her?’ Pansy had shrieked the first time they had come face-to-face with the Mudblood after Rita’s article had appeared. ‘What was she judging against – a chipmunk?’
Draco himself wasn’t calm either. He resolved to write to his father, first thing after the lesson ended, about the insults thrown at him by the latest Nott spawn. Their parents would set this straight, he was sure.
‘Do mine,’ Draco ordered from his position on the floor, sticking out his hand so Pansy could paint his nails a sparkly deep purple.
The last thing I freaked about was the invasion of this here Manor in 1614, my young lad, and I have taken the details of that event to my grave.’
Draco’s father was quiet for a while, then he started softly sweettalking Draco’s mother in French. When Mother started to giggle, Draco took off to entertain himself elsewhere.
They were attracting attention again, so Draco shoved her behind a tapestry, where she pushed him. ‘What did you want me to do?’ she hissed. ‘Let them get away with it? Would you have done that?’
Harry’s fingers were positively glowing as they traced the edge of Draco’s cut, and before he realized, Draco imagined how nice they would feel on –
‘Yes, I am eternally grateful,’ Draco drawled sarcastically. ‘You should be our next Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher. You'll always do better than the last.’
Looking up from a paragraph about Patchouli’s magical scent Draco had been rereading for the umpteenth time, he snorted. ‘Why? It’s not as if I would sleep.’
To hide his smile, Draco grabbed their essay and leaned across the table to dangle their grade in Pansy’s face.
Even Quidditch wasn’t fun anymore with their team captain still sojourning in the hospital wing. Montague remained confused and disorientated, and one Tuesday morning, his parents were to be observed striding up the front drive, looking extremely angry. Madam Pomfrey was no closer to curing him as she was when they’d found him in the toilet.
‘You are not leaving me here,’ Draco demanded, stomping his foot on the stuffy carpet of Madam Malkin's shop.
‘The citizens of Brookley must really like the new auror. Anyway, our last update comes from Anita Rose from Taylor The Taylor, who likes to inform us of our arresting auror’s measurements. Well, we all know how accurate Miss Rose’s tapeless measurements are…’ Draco sniggered. ‘Anyway, here they are, for what it’s worth. Bicep size: thirteen inches, chest size: forty inches, waist size: thirty-four inches, body length: five feet nine.’
A shiver ran down Draco’s spine. He glanced at his professor’s face, but it told him nothing. ‘Did you see it happen, Professor?’
‘JORDAN!’ McGonagall cut in. ‘ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY!’
The lesson continued in the usual call-and-response way between their professor and the Mudblood. Draco rolled his eyes and zoned out, until the group suddenly surged forward around the trestle table.
Draco shook his head. ‘Enough, young lady,’ He got to his feet and with a little bow, he held out his hand. ‘May I have this dance?’
October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Sharp sunlight lit the rain-drenched windows of the castle, illuminating a weak rainbow over the castle grounds, as the Forbidden Forest turned a wide range of golds and reds.
the only people who ever truly cared for him, fought for him, right at the verge of a literal war? Did he truly suggest Draco should abandon his kin, his support system, his entire
‘Potter, did you just write your letter on the back of mine? You’re such a savage. And yes, I have a mansion and a quidditch field in the backgarden. Your point?’
They all stuck up their noses in disgust; bonding over their hatred always worked wonders to solve quarrels.
‘Well, Professor Lupin,’ said Harry with a small shrug. ‘Snape told the Slytherins about him, right?’
It was far too early to get riled up by Draco Malfoy, especially since Harry found out how much it satisfied him.
The boy looked him up and down, in the same way Mother glared at people who got into her personal space. Draco thought he seemed pretty sure of himself for someone dressed like
We start off at the aftermath of the fistfight. Harry is banned from playing and Draco is absolutely fine with that. Mr. Weasley gets attacked, Kreacher visits the Malfoys, Draco enjoys being a prefect and Harry does an interview for the Quibbler. We end with Draco catching Harry after a DA-meeting and delivering him to Umbridge.
