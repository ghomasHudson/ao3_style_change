"I mean, if it were me and I wanted a guy I really liked to sleep with me or something—" Aria struggled not to blush and had to physically restrain herself from meeting Draco's heated gaze across the table as she spoke. "—I'd er…I'd probably just push him against the wall and shove my tongue down his throat." She chuckled and lifted one of her shoulders into a lazy half-shrug.
"You meddling bint!"
"Nothing." Blaise coughed and forced out a sheepish laugh, ducking his head behind his hand. "Anyway, it looks like it's about to rain. We should head back."
"You shouldn't scowl like that, Potter. You're scaring the first years." Zach commented with a smirk as they rounded a corner and spotted a few first year students scurrying away from them.
take some notes while she was watching us that night in the common room."
not even when Narcissa would knock insistently on his door and urge him to come out.
She gave him a plucky smile and stood up, already heading towards the kitchen doors.
Draco's eyes were hard as he finally looked up from his book and glared spitefully at her.
"Astoria's in

of it was burned off. Would you care to explain to me how that's even possible?"
The unexpected news of being able to see his dream girl again definitely lifted his spirits.
"You have no idea."
For his part, Draco had been extremely antisocial that week.
"Oh but don't get me wrong, I
"It's been more than 48 hours. If there were any side effects, I would have experienced them by now." Hermione snapped back at him.
Hermione waited until Aria waved her hand again, casting a silencing charm on herself and around the fireplace, before she and Ron shared another embarrassed chuckle and continued. "Anyway, as I was saying, Ron actually proposed to me this evening while we were having dinner—"
On his way to the adjacent aisle, he happened to pass by two Ravenclaw girls sitting together near the restricted section of the library. As he glanced at them from the corner of his eye, he couldn't help but notice that the Slytherin studying behind them seemed awfully familiar.
if she consents. Any more than that and I'll feed you to the giant squid. Understand?!" He seethed.
"I didn't think of that." Hermione blinked and seemed to consider the idea. "But are you sure you're okay with letting us stay there? I mean, it's
"Seriously, Malfoy."
What are you two doing out here?" He asked.
Pansy immediately hissed back, scowling as she looked up and shot her a particularly nasty glare. "I had everything under control back there, Potter! I didn't need you to come in like the nosy little git you are to save the day!" She snapped.

kicking me!" He scowled and met Pansy's furious glare, rubbing his knee again under the table.
"Fortunately, I saved one last feather just for you, Malfoy."
Potter did you just—"
"Just…surprisingly
sure Potter isn't interested in Greg that way." He drawled.
?!" Austin gaped and stared at Zach in stunned dismay. "B—but, doesn't that amount to an automatic forfeit?!"
"That
is actually the one with the higher risk of accidentally blurting it out in front of everyone else." Pansy pointed out, looking confused.
and deliberately swerved to the side so as to give Harper and Graham a wide,
" Draco snapped angrily at her, his eyes flashing as he looked up and silenced the rest of her words with an infuriated glare. "You don't owe me any apologies, Potter!" He sneered.
"No, it's not that." The girl was quick to reassure him as she placed an imploring hand on his shoulder.
Draco hadn't noticed it at first, as he had been too far away from her to see her face properly, but he saw it now.
"Yes." She sighed when Draco leaned down and kissed her shoulder again, nibbling gently against the soft, creamy skin. "But I'd rather not. It'll draw too much attention."
"Maybe she's just afraid to trust you because she's afraid of getting hurt." She whispered, her eyelashes fluttering as she lowered her gaze and stared at her hands. "She's probably been through a lot, and it's reasonable to assume that she's been taken advantage of one too many times already."
"By the way, er…Aria…Um…" Greg winced and looked down, muttering reassuringly to himself for a couple of seconds before he took in a deep, shuddering intake of breath and continued. "…I was just wondering…If you're not going with anyone else already, of course. Maybe you'd like to…Um. But of course, if you don't want to, I'll understand too — I just thought that maybe, you'd like to — well, you probably wouldn't —but I was hoping that…Um..."
He remembered how his mother had rushed tearfully to Potter after all the other people had cleared away and thanked her, pulling the stunned girl into a tight hug and trembling gratefully against her.
Draco was
"Y—you will?" Greg's eyes went so ridiculously wide with incredulity that Aria couldn't help laughing and shaking her head at his reaction. "I—I mean, seriously? You'll actually go to the Ball with me? You, Harriah Potter?" He asked again, his voice cracking.
"Maybe he's traditional and wants to get married first?" Neville suggested.
When Aria swallowed and managed to stand back up, still shaking, one of Draco's eyebrows arched and he leveled her with another blank, guarded stare.
"My mother is a veela, Potter."
Happy New Year! Here's to hoping that 2021 won't be as much of a shit-show as 2020 was!
This time, Draco was unable to keep a smug smirk from breaking out onto his face.
Aria smiled at him and leaned up, pressing a feather-light kiss against his lips. Before she could pull away, Draco wrapped an arm around her waist and took advantage of their closeness by leaning down and pressing his mouth against hers in another kiss. As their tongues met, Draco hummed and traced seductive circles along the exposed skin of her waist below her shirt.
"I have to go to the loo." Aria interrupted Blaise's drunken protests when she stood up primly from her seat and gave him an amused smile. "Where exactly is it, may I ask?"
When Wood finally looked back up and met their anxious stares, his eyes were back to normal. He waited until he had everyone's full attention before he continued.
There, that wasn't a cliffhanger now, was it? :D
"Pansy, that didn't
"You don't have to stroke my ego too much, Parkinson." Aria quipped, causing Pansy to roll her eyes.
"Well, he dated
" Pansy ignored Blaise's antics and glared incredulously at Hannah.
When Corey just swallowed and continued to stare nervously at her, Blaise decided to break the awkward silence by drawing Aria's attention back to him.
Draco paused briefly and Aria followed his gaze to the handsome, dark-haired boy to his right. When he noticed her looking at him, Austin reddened but he greeted her with a friendly smile, causing Aria to blink and smile back hesitantly at him in return. If Draco noticed this little exchange between them, he didn't say anything - though his mouth twisted slightly into a sneer.
Luna's expression brightened at Blaise's words. "Only if you promise to give me a
Wood walked back over to stand behind the teacher's table and slowly sat down. "And yes, he was a vampire. But he was also, to put it mildly,
Unfortunately, the added stress of having to avoid so many male (and female) students hoping to ask her to the Ball, combined with the effects of the consecutive all-nighters she had to pull these last few days to catch up to her NEWT study schedule, was quickly beginning to catch up to her. And by the end of that morning, Aria's mind had shut itself off, and she began mentally fast-forwarding through the rest of that week.
thing. She and Crookshanks are already best friends."
Once they both finished placing their orders, she leaned back against her seat and smiled invitingly at him, obviously waiting for him to start the conversation. Unfortunately, all Draco managed to do was give her another strained smile, inwardly cursing himself in his head as he struggled desperately for something to talk about. After a few minutes of this, she immediately picked up on his awkward behavior and reached out across the table, placing her gloved hand on top of his and giving his fingers a light squeeze.
As soon as they were gone, Draco finally huffed and sat down into Greg's vacated seat.
That was when Draco realized that it actually didn't matter to him if they lost today's match after all.

"You really need to read the newspapers a bit more, Emma." Lewis snorted, shaking his head at her antics before turning his attention back to Draco. "Speaking of newspapers, I read from the Prophet this morning that the Wizengamot will be releasing the results of the Bar Examinations today. Have you seen your results yet?"
"Are you okay—?"
"No! Don't go!"
"N—no, I wasn't—" Her eyes widened in belated realization and she shook her head at him, trying to stop laughing long enough so that she could give him an apologetic smile. "—I wasn't making fun of you, I swear! I was just thinking about how…It's…I can't believe that this whole time—" She broke herself off and collapsed into another fit of hysterical giggles, causing Draco to sigh in exasperation and cover his face with his hands.
"You actually draw more attention to yourself by skulking around suspiciously like that."
Aria smirked and turned back to Ron and Hermione, meeting their disbelieving expressions with an amused look. "Look, if she bothers you that much, I can cast a silencing charm on the rest of our conversation, if you like?" She offered.
Draco felt the realization slam into him like a bludger to the head and all of a sudden, he couldn't breathe.
Draco set his empty glass of wine down gently onto the kitchen counter.

"Ah, that." Aria considered her words for a few minutes before she chuckled and threw the dirty rag into a nearby trash bin. "Well, I'll admit that you're not exactly my most favorite person in the world…but
"This came in the mail for you this morning just after you left."
Everyone turned to stare at her.
"If we must." Morag shrugged at her before calmly turning back to her half-eaten bowl of cereal. "For the record, I still say monogamous sex is overrated but to each his own, I guess." She quipped.
Meanwhile, Blaise and Greg shared uncomfortable glances with one another and scuffed their shoes quietly on the floor.
"Look who's talking. Just because you wear an ugly brown old-lady cloak over yourself, it doesn't mean people won't notice you. So just piss off and mind your own business." He retorted, reaching for the glass of scotch that the bartender placed in front of him.
dating!" He growled.
They broke apart instantly, looking up to find Ron and Hermione watching them with matching smirks on their faces. Hermione raised an eyebrow and glanced pointedly at their clasped hands.
Draco answered her with a roguish grin.
She had saved him that day; despite him being the worthless piece of shit he knew he was.
"It feels good." Draco smirked as he leaned in, pressing his mouth against hers before he answered. "But...does that mean you won't have to punish me anymore...
"What the hell is your problem, Weasley?!" He demanded.
"I didn't hex him because I thought you couldn't handle it, Pansy. I hexed the bloody git because I wanted to." Neville retorted, his voice rising several levels in obvious annoyance.
It wasn't hard to stare at the last passenger who exited the train — a tall, dark-haired girl who began to turn heads the instant she stepped onto the platform. She was too far away for Draco to see her face clearly, so he wasn't sure if it was her at first (especially since it's been more than four months since he last saw her) but when she finally turned around and looked up, meeting his eyes from a few meters away, his breath caught and he instantly felt his cheeks grow embarrassingly warm despite the cold.
"Exactly." Draco shrugged and smirked at her. "So because of situations like that, we're very protective with our bloodline, apparently. Can't have a child born out of wedlock due to being under the influence of amortentia or something." He added with a chuckle.
The sharp intonation of Pansy's voice finally broke Draco from his trance. He flinched in surprise and blinked up at them, staring at both Slytherins as though he had only just realized they were there.
She tried to give her two best friends a smile but it ended up as a sheepish grimace.
Aria watched him closely, scowling to herself a few seconds later when Malfoy just neatly placed the empty shot glass back down onto the table as though he had just finished drinking a shot of water.
—" Before the other boy could protest, Draco shoved him towards his broom. "—get on your broom. You and I are going to have a talk in the locker room."
"I didn't ask for one." She answered.

seemed incapable of saying anything, he finally gave up.
The longer he stared at her, the more he was certain that she was probably about his age.
"Hannah, I'm so sorry! I forgot you were there—"
would earn that person a one-way ticket to Azkaban right? But they chose to look away in my case. Because I was the girl-who-lived. Bunch of self-serving hypocrites they are." Aria said scornfully.
The scent of something absolutely wonderful and masculine and
Draco's eyes were heavy-lidded as he bent down to whisper softly into her ear. "What are the chances that you'd actually let me shag you twice right here, right now, before we go back to the common room?"
"That depends on Potter." Draco smiled grimly and ordered another drink from the bartender. "She could send me to Azkaban for the rest of my life. And to be honest, I wouldn't even blame her if she did."
"I'm not sure about that…but
veelas, whether mated or unmated." Fleur waved a perfectly manicured hand in a dismissive gesture. "But as I said, this is all very theoretical, as the only people who should know the names of veelas are their mates and their close family or friends."

"My hands get cold really easily." Aria explained hastily, giving him an awkward smile.
green eyes that Draco had ever seen.
He smiled at her irritated expression and used his grip on her wrist to pull her back into his arms. "You've kept an eye on me for years, didn't you? Did it look like I spent a lot of my time with girls?" He pointed out, arching an eyebrow at her.

"I'll let you know when I'm uncomfortable." She told him.
"Of course not! Aria would
Aria's eyes widened in belated realization.
She was giving him a very strange look.
"You said that
So don't you dare start playing the victim card now." Neville's eyes were like steel as he glared accusingly at Pansy's stunned, crestfallen face. "You were the one made those choices during the war. So stop blaming me and Aria and learn to deal with the consequences."
Granted, it took Aria a few minutes longer than usual since she had to limp her way through all the flights of stairs she encountered (she only just realized how annoying it was that there were so many of them around the school), she eventually reached the Headmistress' Tower just in time to see Hermione walking away from the Stairwell Gargoyle guarding McGonagall's office.
They reached London in a surprisingly short amount of time, and as they alighted from the train and onto the platform of King's Cross station, Aria grabbed him by the wrist, tugging him along with her towards the exit that would lead them to the Central part of the city.
a Slytherin, he or she was probably alone if nobody else noticed."
"It is important for everyone to realize that, due to the popularity of veela and because of a lot of mistakes in ancient lore, there have always been many false notions about my kind. And I would like to take this opportunity to dispel all – if not,
"Fine then." Morag whistled as she reached out and yanked the black book out of his hands. "I'll just go back to the Restricted Section and put this book back where I found it—"
" Hannah was still blushing as she pulled her trunk over to her new bed, flipped it open and began rifling through her clothes. "I still can't believe this is all happening. When I came to Hogwarts this year, the
"As my house's highest ranking Prefect, I believe
As soon as her veela name left his lips, Aria flinched, and Draco had to force himself not to stare too much when her shaking hand almost lost its grip on her towel, very nearly causing it to slip off and expose her naked frame. She lifted her chin to meet his eyes and they stared silently at each other, their bodies tense and both of their gazes so unyielding that, for a moment, Draco was vaguely reminded of their duel in second year; back when he and Aria had glared each other down with the same, electrically charged intensity as they were doing now.
"Give me a break, Malfoy. I just got out of the hospital wing this morning, remember?" Aria pointed out, glaring at him over the thick glasses that were beginning to slide off her nose. With an exasperated sigh, she shoved them back up onto her face and reluctantly trudged after him.
"You're mine, Aria! And I
"Excuse me?" She asked quietly.
"I stopped counting, honestly." Draco shook his head, his lips curling into a grin. "Veelas are just...
Aria didn't say anything for a long moment, blinking and staring at Pansy in stunned silence.
and girl—" He corrected himself hastily with a laugh, glancing apologetically at Aria. "—I'll leave you all to get to work. Good luck!"
"What's going on?" He asked, smirking as he leaned back against his seat and turned questioningly to Aria.
"What the hell are you talking about?" Morag's eyes narrowed and she moved her chair away from him.
"Only when they're this nice." He quipped back, nuzzling her breasts with a smirk. "And don't you dare judge me, Potter. Breasts like these are
girls' feelings here?!"
As soon as the distasteful joke left Aria's mouth, she regretted it almost instantly; especially when she saw the way Greg's face sombered. She cursed under her breath and immediately backtracked.
Aria scoffed at him and pointedly took another bite of the churro. "You really need to get out of your posh little pureblood world every now and then, Malfoy. Here. Why don't you try it?"
She ignored him and made to stand up, only for Hannah's eyes to widen in panic as she screeched and reached out, yanking Pansy back down into her seat.
Ron and Aria both intoned flatly, causing Hermione's shoulders to sag in disappointment.
"I see." Draco paused and turned to look at her again, studying the strange, conflicting emotions in her eyes. "Is it because I'm a Malfoy? I can assure you, I'm not the pureblood supremacist that the bloody Prophet makes us out to be. Well, at least not anymore—"
She didn't look up, but Aria could tell from the tightness of Pansy's voice that she was struggling to hold herself together.
Aria's eyes were vacant and she was staring blankly at the empty space in front of her.
"I never ignored you! I just...didn't like it when you came on too touchy and flirty sometimes; and it became even worse this year when you started hanging out with all those Slytherins. I
"Eh, I guess I'm still in Hufflepuff."
"These
He raked a hand through his blond hair a few times, styling it carefully with gel until he was satisfied that it fell perfectly over his eyes. Afterwards, he adjusted the cufflinks on the sleeves of his coat, fastening them securely over his wrists.
"Go on." She urged.
"Oh really? Then tell me, what
He rewarded them with another smile - and this time, everyone saw the unmistakable gleam of the long, sharp fangs where his canines should be.
He felt his cheeks grow warm at the overwhelming thought.

"You Gryffindors."
"There's something strange about Potter this year." He blurted out, his eyes looking a little unfocused.

"You two are
"Yeah right." Draco scoffed at her words and shook his head. "I'm not about to make a complete fool out of myself—"
" Ron stammered stupidly, unable to form a coherent sentence.
it?" She persisted, studying her closely.
"What is it about you lions anyway?" Pansy taunted, her voice dripping with a mixture of sarcasm and disdain. "Why do you all just have this insatiable need to play the valiant, noble hero? Do you all just — I don't know —
"You minx!" He growled.
"Will you both just stop it?!" Aria interrupted angrily, green eyes flashing as she stormed over toward them and placed herself directly in the middle of the two boys. "Look, this is getting completely out of hand. Draco, Bentley…Both of you just…
"Bollocks."
Fortunately, after a few minutes of Aria and Malfoy desperately trying to avoid accidentally meeting each other's gaze, Neville seemed to take pity on her. He spoke up, calling Aria's attention from where he was sitting beside Hannah near the opposite end of the table.
He didn't get to finish the rest of his sentence because just then, the girl had leaned forward and placed a quick kiss on his cheek. Before Draco even had a chance to react, however, she was already pulling away.
"I wasn't – I didn't mean it that way—"
"No, actually—" Aria hesitated, her eyes wide with uncertainty as she flicked her gaze back and forth between Draco and Firenze. "—um, we're
"Alright, alright. That's enough of that." Ron finally couldn't take it anymore and spoke up, forcing Bentley to look up at him and earning a grateful look from Aria for his timely interruption. "Look here, mate. I think Aria wants to finish up with her dinner so she can get some rest. So why don't you—"
with it." Morag interrupted Aria, offering Draco a careless shrug. "It's like monogamy, really. It's good enough, but kind of overrated.
Aria looked up and slowly met his gaze.
"A few centuries ago, it was. But nowadays, veelas have learned to be a lot more cautious about protecting their identity; and we are much smarter about choosing our mates. So it is not really as horrible as it sounds anymore." Fleur tried to cajole him with a reassuring smile. "For one thing,
"Why are you taking her side on this anyway?" Corey asked, looking irritated for a split second before his expression turned sly and he gave Draco an obnoxious smirk. "It's not like you two are still dating anyway. Or
Draco didn't bother waiting for either of them to answer before he took off towards the back of the library, eager for any excuse to get away from the annoying pair and have some time to himself. After a few minutes of him wandering aimlessly around the many aisles of thick, dusty books, he found himself stopping in the middle of the Ancient Runes research section.
"Why did your father reject your veela mother?"
Her voice broke and an involuntary shiver seemed to wrack her slender frame when Draco nuzzled her hand again, his eyes growing dark with pleasure at the way she whispered his name. He felt perversely exhilarated, all of the blood in his veins thrumming contentedly at the way she was so utterly and completely melting at his touch.
Despite herself, Aria noticed the lingering bitterness in Zach's voice and reached out, placing a gloved hand on his shoulder. "I'm not sure if anyone else has asked you this already but I'll ask anyway. And no, you don't have to answer if you don't want to."
"I would absolutely
The unexpected softness in Potter's voice drew Draco's attention back to her, and he was taken back when he saw the expression on her face. For all her legendary Gryffindor bravado and annoying snark at the beginning of their conversation, Potter now looked as though someone had punched her in the gut.
funny!" She protested sharply.
"There's some kind of commotion happening in the Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff common rooms." Zach told them as he was coming down from the boys' dorms. He paused, however, when he caught sight of Aria and his gaze automatically dropped down to her nightgown.
?" Morag complained loudly, wrinkling her nose at him in distaste.
There's a big difference."
Trying not to wince under the vicious glare Draco was still giving her, Aria sighed and flew a good distance away from Austin, returning to her previous task of observing her new teammates instead.
"You're really close to your mother, aren't you?" Aria arched an eyebrow and gave him a knowing smile.
"You know the drill, boys." Draco ignored the look of confusion on both Aria and Zach's faces as he smirked and reached a hand out, waiting until every single member of their team piled their hands together on top of his before he grinned again and winked at them. "And don't forget to have fun."
"Because my new stepdad is at home and, well, let's just say we're not exactly fond of each other." He took a quick sip from the flask and scoffed. "I didn't want to cause any trouble for him and my mom again so I decided to go back to Hogwarts before my mom tries to file for another divorce."
Seconds later, a small, blue winged creature zoomed out from under the cabinet and began flying around the top of Pansy's head.

"Do you
"Because I'd rather have you close to me like this than you casting your own cover."
Instead of answering, the petulant scowl on Aria's face darkened and she turned to glare accusingly at Blaise.

In Pansy's case, she explained to them that her parents were planning to have her meet her potential fiancé (a man who was, apparently, 15 years older than her) so she decided to make up an excuse about having to stay at school. Neville, on the other hand, didn't want to go home because his grandmother had invited some of their distant relatives over, and he really didn't get along with them. Hannah had just stayed behind because she wanted to take advantage of the empty library and get some last minute cramming done for their NEWT exams.
As Pansy flounced back inside, Theo chuckled and turned to Hannah, meeting her embarrassed smile with a lazy grin.
"Malfoy, I told you not to use the term bloodsucker."
complicated spell, and it requires a lot of magical effort to exert complete control over someone –
"Oh bugger. Was that today?" She complained.
Draco shook his head and let out a hysterical, slightly choked sound of laughter.
"Something like that." Hannah grumbled, tapping her fingernails miserably against the table. "Ernie and his parents are planning to spend their summer in Paris this year, so I probably won't be able to see him for a couple of months after the school year's over." She answered.
"Are you okay? Where else are you hurt?" He demanded as he gripped her chin and tilted her face up to his, using their proximity to inspect her features up close.
" Ron snorted derisively, sticking his tongue out at her.
"I have to go." She told them uncertainly. "Hannah's locked herself in the bathroom for some reason and she didn't look too good. I'd better go and deal with this."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Dance with me?" She asked softly.
"Are you certain this is what you want?" She asked, lowering her gaze self-consciously to her feet. "You're a war hero now. You're almost as sought after as Potter is these days. You don't have to associate yourself with someone like me when you can get any girl you want—"
"This is perhaps the misconception about us veelas that I
"How wonderful for you, Hermione." Aria drawled sarcastically, not bothering to hide her irritation at the way Hermione's voice suddenly took on a high-pitched, 'cooing' tone at the mention of her cat.

"Avada Kedav—"

about the whole thing." Neville answered, though he looked as though he was having trouble believing his own words. "He looked a little annoyed but he didn't rise to Smith's taunts or comments at all. At some point, he even looked amused."
"Happy Christmas!" Hermione added.
Morag smirked at their reactions and rolled her eyes, giving them all a pointed look.
"—I want you all to myself anyway."
Wood snorted in amusement. "That would kill

"Really, Malfoy?" Neville scoffed at him. "Like I said, she's my friend and I'm not interested in her that way. Besides, I already have a girlfriend, remember?"
" Draco croaked out, staring at his friend in stunned disbelief.
too." Neville chimed in with a grin, raising his bottle of beer at Aria in a gesture of agreement. "Back in Gryffindor, the house-elves assigned to regularly clean our dorms would sometimes burst out crying from exhaustion." He told them, wincing at the memory.
"You'll see me again, Draco."
Hermione had mentioned that Blaise was the only Prefect who was patrolling the castle on the same night the other common rooms were vandalized. Not long before that, Aria had also suspected Pansy for the first vandalism case, because Pansy herself had admitted that she was the only Slytherin who had been in the common room that night.
When Hannah's mood seemed to dampen at her own words and she looked away, Aria unwittingly found herself the recipient of the deeply admonishing glare Pansy was shooting her from across the table.
Pansy's voice sounded both resigned and weary as she reluctantly sank down into the seat beside Aria, her shoulders slumping with exhaustion.
"Are you okay? I can't help but notice that you seem a little…
Draco ignored the anxious feeling in his gut and began making his way through the darkness, weaving himself around a small cluster of tall trees. Blaise whispered a lumos spell behind him, holding his wand up into the air as he followed.
There was a twinkle in Luna's blue eyes as she turned around and stared at them with a knowing smile on her face. "You three go on ahead. I'll stay here and help Greg and Neville put out the fiendfyre before it gets worse. Besides, someone has to stay behind and tell Ron and Hermione where to find Aria when they wake up."
When she stared expectantly at him, Draco offered her a sheepish smile.
"I don't want to jump to any conclusions without any evidence." Aria admitted.
The three feathers burst into bright green flames. Fisher slumped back down onto his back, exhausted, and not ten seconds later, Draco heard the soft, ruffling of the leaves along one of the tree branches above their heads, followed by the sound of a wing flapping in the air.
"That's
"Celebrate?" Draco flicked his cautious gaze back and forth between Narcissa and Andromeda in confusion. "Celebrate
"Well,
She couldn't help but think back on how she herself had mistakenly suspected Pansy for the first vandalism incident a few weeks ago. And now, the very same circumstances –
The look on her face was unreadable at first, and for a long time, Draco wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but when she finally lifted her chin and stared at him, he flinched and looked away. He felt a sharp stab of shame at the unmistakeable sadness and rejection that was now creasing her lovely, crestfallen features.
He immediately looked away and forced out another laugh, reaching out and taking a long sip from his glass of wine. Once he managed to set the glass back down, he steeled his nerves and finally looked up, meeting her worried gaze.
Gritting his teeth, Draco gripped the handle of his Nimbus 2001 and swerved sharply to the right, another stray bludger just narrowly missing his shoulder. He squinted through his goggles and looked around the quidditch pitch, trying to assess the situation. By now, the score was 200-120, in favor of Gryffindor, but with the Gryffindor Chasers becoming much more aggressive with their shots each passing minute, Draco knew their lead was only going to grow.
Demelza frowned at her. "What do you mean?"
"Ow, fuck!"
"Blaise and Draco are my friends and they're not
"My fixation is quidditch."
"You will do as Madam Pomfrey says until your wing is fully healed. Don't make me do this." Hermione warned.
"No."
A few sparks shot up from the tip of her wand, circling around the group, and within a few seconds, the hall was filled with sharp gasps and horrified screeches as about half of the 8th year students found themselves gaping at the new house colors accenting their Hogwarts uniform.
Pansy's eyes widened in alarm and she made a pitiful attempt to swipe the box from Hannah's hands but it was too late.
away from touching you?!"
She reached over and patted Hannah awkwardly on the shoulder. "Seriously, stop crying. Do you want me to ask one of the boys here in Slytherin to hex that pathetic twat for you?" She offered with a low growl.

Hermione laughed at Aria's gleeful expression, and her face disappeared from the fireplace for a second, only to be replaced with an image of her hand – where Aria could make out a simple but beautiful diamond ring on her finger. "Now, we haven't really talked about anything specific yet but—"
After some time, Aria skillfully untangled her long legs from his shoulders and rolled them over, separating their forms so that she could pin him down onto the bed.
Blaise called their attention when he suddenly knelt down, holding his wand above an orange lump of fur on the ground. He waited until Draco and Pansy crouched down beside him before he lowered his wand, illuminating the figure of a dead, orange fox.
Still frowning, Aria was about to follow after him when Blaise suddenly caught her attention by gently grabbing her elbow.
By some stroke of luck, the three of them were able to make it back to the school grounds in one piece.
"Lie back for me."
Unsure of what to say in response to that, Draco stared sullenly at his cup of tea.
associated with Voldemort, if we're being honest. No doubt, they'll jump at any opportunity to expel Slytherin students." She explained.
, not him! She couldn't—"
"Did that wanker just say the Chamber of Secrets?" He demanded.
"Aria, listen to me—"
"U—uhm….Greg…?"
at Potter?"
Aria had barely finished her meal when Draco couldn't seem to help himself and pulled her close again, spinning them around so that he was pinning her against one of the kitchen counters. Before she could say anything, he bent down and pressed his lips against hers, tasting the sweetness of the treacle tart she had just eaten from her mouth.
Later that evening, after everyone had finished dinner and began making their way back to the dungeons, Blaise and Aria separated from their housemates and headed off towards the kitchens to get started on their chores that night.
She waited until everyone was huddled around her before swishing her wand once in the air in a quick circular movement.
We're the pair assigned to do the chores you'll be giving out this afternoon." She explained.
After a few minutes, Aria felt him pressing his knee between her thighs, teasing for a bit, before he shifted his position and she felt something else — something hot and achingly hard probing against her entrance.
had been caught completely off guard by Malfoy and Zabini a couple of days ago.
So Draco wasn't all that surprised when, the next day, while he and the rest of the 8th year Slytherins were lounging in the common room, Blaise suddenly jumped to his feet and announced that they were all going to have another drinking session in Hogsmeade to celebrate the end of their exams.
He ignored the surprised look on Corey's face and whirled around, sneering spitefully at the Gryffindor-robed student who had crashed roughly into his shoulder from behind. When he lifted his gaze and recognized who the Gryffindor was, the sneer on Draco's face immediately hardened and his eyes flashed with contempt.
Draco felt his left eye twitch with irritation at Blaise's words but instead of answering, he opted to keep his thoughts to himself and directed his gaze back to the scenery outside the train's windows.
"I don't want a mate, Draco
He scoffed and made a dismissive gesture with his hand. "You don't have to thank me for that. I'm the Captain, it was my responsibility to make sure you didn't get hurt." He told her, blushing.
Aria's voice broke as she gripped desperately onto the bedsheets, her forearms parallel with each other to keep herself from falling over. The way his hands were gripping onto her waist was painful, and she was certain that he was going to leave even more bruises on her when this was all over but she couldn't bring herself to care as his thrusts grew even harder, faster, almost frantic with need until Draco was gasping for breath from all the exertion.
"Draco!"
"I wasn't trying to attack Aria!" Bentley spat back furiously at him with an appalled expression on his face, almost as though the very idea of hurting Aria Potter was something that made him sick.
"Millicent's not that bad, you know. She's my housemate now so that obviously means she's smart. And I actually get along with her. She was there with us last Sunday when we had a study session in the library." Hermione whispered back, causing Aria to blink and stare at the other girl as though she had grown an extra pair of arms.
"The answer to the question I asked you back at the pub." Undaunted, she grinned and glanced teasingly at him from the corner of her eye. "Your favorite color? You never really answered me." She pointed out.
Bentley charged at Draco and the latter obliged by simultaneously evading him and punching him hard in the face. By then, Draco was far too gone at this point to hear Aria's angry shouts as he and Bentley finally hurled themselves at each other, fists, elbows and feet flying everywhere and smashing violently against the other's in a fit of mindless rage.
say Corey is innocent."
"Secrets? Really? You want to talk about secrets
"Yes, it did." He chuckled, leaning down again and dropping a few kisses against her neck. "We should head back to the castle before that gigantic, half-breed friend of yours comes looking for us. Imagine how awkward that would be." He pointed out, nipping playfully at her skin.
"I can't do that, Pansy." Neville growled.
her mate with her entire being – trust him not to take advantage of the power he will have over her." She tilted her head slightly to the side in thought, her sharp blue eyes lingering on all the male students in the room.
"Wh—what are you talking about? Of
"It's actually not that bad, you know." Pansy continued, an unusually sympathetic look on her face. "I've met veela before, they're not that different from normal witches. I mean, Blaise's mother is one, if that's any consolation. It's actually not as uncommon in the wizarding world as you might think."
"What about Luna?" Aria asked pointedly.
; and she actually had to push lightly at his chest to make him ease up a little until she was more comfortable and the pain receded back into pleasure.
"Right. One just happens to be a Death Eater." He retorted sarcastically, snickering.
At her words, the excitement on Corey's face immediately died down and he scowled, looking up to give Pansy an annoyed look. "Well, not just this year to be honest." He admitted begrudgingly, scuffling his shoes along the floor. "I've
She managed an uncertain laugh and stared at him again, giving him a perplexed look. "But...I doubt that I'll be able to suppress it for very long if you keep touching me like this."
the fact that people went out of their way to avoid her now instead of crowding around her, but it was a little unsettling. Just the other day, while she had been on her way to the library, she had accidentally bumped into a Hufflepuff first year, sending the younger student sprawling to the ground.
Neville brought a hand up and cupped her cheek, silencing the rest of her stammered explanations. "But don't worry so much. We'll take this slow. I
Draco's eyes were narrowed in annoyance as he glared irritably at her flushed, drunken face.
While everyone was distracted, Aria quietly slipped away from the crowd and made her way up to the very top of the quidditch stands.
"Well, I should leave you both to it then. Have fun tonight, alright? And don't worry, Hannah. Theo here is a
"Yes, he did."
Just below Aria's left shoulder, where the bludger had managed to hit her, there was a small
crush on Draco back then, you see—
"I'll say." Morag remarked, and Aria's lips twitched when she saw the way the other girl was blatantly checking her out. "A veela's true form is truly fascinating. I don't suppose you'd consider a one-time shag with me, Potter? Purely for research purposes of course, I'm quite curious how differently a veela's biology responds to pleasure stimuli."
rubbing your foot up and down my leg?"
" She asked.
"I suppose I was."
"Of course! Of course, I'm so sorry for disturbing you! I'll let you get back to your meal and go sit with my friends." Bentley suddenly rushed out, looking deeply embarrassed as he shot up from his seat and bowed apologetically at Aria. She gave him another forced smile, which quickly turned into a grimace when Bentley leaned in one last time and, ignoring Ron's warning glare at him, whispered into her ear.
"Entertainment."
"Well you
It's a little strange actually." He shrugged and began unwrapping the chocolate frog in his hand.
"Wait a minute. I'm confused." Zach interjected as he held a hand up and flicked his confused gaze back and forth between Draco and Aria. "Are we still talking about monogamous vanilla sex between you and Potter or monogamous vanilla sex in
Aria tore her eyes away from Bentley's, blinking rapidly to clear the fog from her mind. She shook her head a couple of times, furious with herself for even entertaining such thoughts.
"Loathe as I am to admit it, the feeling seems to be mutual." He told her, causing Aria to chuckle at the grimace on his face. "My mother practically worships the ground you walk on these days. Did you know she recently subscribed to Witch Weekly because she heard they were doing a special feature on you next month?" He admitted grudgingly, making a face.
Blinking, Aria slowly trailed her gaze up Blaise Zabini's tall, lean form and found herself the unwitting recipient of the handsome Slytherin's overly wide, charming smile.
Given that most of the classes of the graduating students were already wrapping up, Headmistress McGonagall then announced that she was giving the 8th years and 7th years the last week of school off before their graduation ceremony. She reminded everyone that, as much as possible, they should use the free days to attend to their applications and interviews for their chosen career paths.
began choking on their food. Morag, on the other hand, actually looked interested in Blaise's question while Zach – well frankly, Zach still looked as though he was about to throw up.
Bentley smiled and leaned in closer toward her, speaking his next words directly into her ear. "You've never had any suspicions against any of them?" He whispered softly.
the perfect, rosy little picture that all those stupid magazines make it out to be, you know. You, and a lot of other people, may think I'm living some kind of dream because I'm the 'Chosen One' and because I defeated the Dark Lord but the truth is, I had to go through absolute
After a long, dangerously tense moment of Draco and Fisher glaring menacingly at each other, their hands hovering over their wands, Corey reached up and began tugging insistently on Draco's sleeve to get his attention.
Neville gave her a sympathetic smile at that before they parted, him following Zabini and the rest of the new Slytherin 8th years boys while Aria sighed and grudgingly trailed after Parkinson and the other girls. After a short flight of stairs, Parkinson swung open a large, wooden door and gestured for the rest of them to follow her inside.
Aside from Blaise and Pansy, Draco also saw Morag MacDougal sprawled on the rug in front of the fireplace, surrounded by a dozen books all haphazardly scattered by her feet. Hannah Abbott, on the other hand, was reading by herself in a lone corner of the room, though the former Hufflepuff kept looking up every now and then, her eyes darting nervously around her.
"I…I'm not so sure that's a good idea." She answered hesitantly.
"Get away from her, Pans." Neville flicked his worried gaze briefly to the girl on the ground before he glanced back at Aria and pointed his wand at her, positioning himself into a defensive dueling stance. "I don't want to fight you, Aria. But I will if I have to. So just back away."
"Ugh." He pretended to gag and turned to Hermione. "We should go before they start making out again, I don't think I can handle seeing that
She recognized the way all the tiny hairs on the back of her neck stood up. She shivered and slowly fluttered her eyes open, staring up at the dark, wooden ceiling.
He swallowed and hastily averted his gaze.
"You have visitors, Miss Potter."
He wrapped an arm around her waist and pulled her close again, leaning down and pressing his lips against hers in a hard kiss. When she gasped at his audacity and shoved him away, one of her hands reaching up to cover her mouth, Draco stepped back, a self-satisfied smirk settling on his face when he saw the way her cheeks were flushed with lust.
After a long moment of silence, Zach spoke again in a calmer, albeit slightly defeated voice.
Draco shrugged off Pansy's insistent tugging on his arm and moved to stand near the back, behind one of the classroom doors. He crouched slightly and watched as Aria reluctantly hung back from her Gryffindor friends and turned her attention to Fleur.
Potter?" Draco snapped back at her, a little irritated by the smirk on her face "Because if it is, you
She was quiet for a long time.
At the sound of Pansy's voice, all three boys looked up to see her lean back casually against her seat and lazily resume filing her nails. When she paused and looked up to see Draco frowning at her in confusion, she smirked and held up both of her hands in mock defense.
"Will you at least tell me your name now?" He asked.
"You actually draw more attention to yourself by skulking around suspiciously like that."
in Gryffindor and now, we have the likes of Potter and Longbottom as Slytherins. Oh this is going to be one hell of an interesting year." He exclaimed, earning himself another set of irritated looks from his friends.
"And is that really what you want?" Aria smiled back teasingly at him. "For us to be together,
To give her credit, Pansy actually looked aghast at her question and she shook her head furiously.
She blinked at him and, slowly, her hesitant expression melted away until only a small, amused smile lingered on her face. Chuckling, she shook her head to herself and took a step backwards away from him.
I'll be honest; I wasn't entirely satisfied with how this chapter turned out, mainly because there were so many scenes I had to compress together to make it all fit. In any case, I decided to just post it anyway and get it all out of the way.
"Ugh. You two are still as obscene as ever."
Reluctantly, he turned towards the woman beside him, frowning when he realized that he couldn't see her face as she was facing the other side of the room. He also noticed that her head was completely covered by the hood of the tattered, brown cloak she was wearing.
After a few minutes, an idea suddenly popped into her head. She grinned, turning to give the younger Slytherin a mischievous wink.
"Why don't you say it a bit louder, 'Mione. I don't think the whole classroom was able to hear you." Aria interrupted sharply, immediately causing her friend to flush in belated realization.
"I—I wasn't hitting on her—"
"Let's get going. The rest of the team is already waiting for us." Blaise grabbed Aria lightly by her sleeve and began steering her towards the exit of the library.
His voice was smug as looked up and met her desperate, wide-eyed stare with a smirk.
"She's fine." Draco smirked and waved her concerns aside.
Aria tried to speak again, but Draco took advantage of her parted lips and
"I'm just not sure what that is yet."
Draco immediately sat up to check on her, a contrite look on his face.
"So that's a no then, huh?" Blaise made a face at her and pretended to shake his head in disapproval. "I'm disappointed in you, Abbott. Have I not taught you anything?! You're a Slytherin now, you have to know what you want and know
"It doesn't
The censorious look on Blaise's face was quickly replaced with a wicked smile.
"My gown for the Yule Ball!" Hannah glared at her and stomped her foot on the floor in angry exasperation. "Haven't you been listening? I need to make sure I look nice that night!" She blurted out.
He noted with fond amusement that Aria didn't look at all self-conscious about the fact that the first two buttons of the shirt she was wearing were undone or that the shirt ended only halfway down her legs.
Pansy stiffened at the accusation she heard in Aria's voice.
he supposedly met in Hogsmeade a few months ago. She didn't give him her name so he's been looking for her all summer." He snickered for a bit before stopping abruptly when Draco flicked his icy gaze at him, effectively shutting him up.
She had time.
"If I remember correctly, Goyle's always been considerate with the girls in his year even back then. We probably just never noticed it because we were never housemates with him." Aria continued hastily before Ron could notice that she had drifted off in her own thoughts.
"How bad is it? Is it a bruise?" She whispered, watching him closely.
"Amateurs." He shrugged.
that is?"
The warmth grew stronger and stronger; until it radiated into a bright, yellowish glow that erupted from his chest and spread out over the rest of his body. When the glow finally faded away, Draco realized what Aria had done, and his heart stopped. He looked down, staring at the veelish symbols of Aria's veela name that began magically inscribing themselves along the back of his wrist.
?" She folded her hands primly behind her and gave him a small, forced smile.
"Yes." She answered.
"Seriously?" Corey glanced back and forth between Aria and Pansy, a disappointed expression on his face. "You want me to spend my Saturday mornings studying DADA?" He turned to his sister again and gave her a pleading look. "Can't I just hang out with my friends?"
He waited until Aria lifted her gaze back up to meet his before he winked and gave her an appraising grin. "Personally, I think it was brilliant of you to do that, by the way. That bloke needed a serious boost of confidence after Astoria chose to go with Draco to the Yule Ball instead of him." He pointed out.
Aria sighed again, reaching up to massage her temples in exhaustion. "The whole idea of him finding out
one." Ron sighed and grimaced as he shifted his gaze from Aria to Draco. "So you and
The distinct green and silver house crest that was now embroidered perfectly on her school robes was absolutely unmistakeable.
Aria let out a pained hiss and released her grip on Pansy's neck.
ours?" She demanded.
"Yes, Malfoy?" Aria asked calmly.
"I could ask you the same thing." Corey retorted huffily.
4. To those asking, I don't actually have an update schedule for this story, though I do try to update at least once a week or every two weeks. The reason updates were so fast before was because chapters 1-9 were all pre-written. This last update took longer because I had to write this chapter from scratch. ;)
With a sigh, Aria plopped herself down into the vacant seat beside Draco.
Aria for what we did during the bloody war."
"Then come and sit on my lap,
At least, not if Aria considered all of the possible circumstances that could have happened.
"Just indulge me for a little longer here, Potter. I've never been bonded to a veela before."
When she opened her mouth to speak, his eyes darkened and he leaned down, pressing his lips hungrily against hers. She immediately kissed him back, her body going pliant against him as she wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him closer. His hands caressed her wings and Aria shuddered again, parting her lips and eagerly inviting his tongue to slip inside. They teased and leisurely explored each other's mouths, until Aria reluctantly pulled away, causing Draco to blink and frown at her in concern.
Parkinson." Aria pretended to scoff but eventually returned her words with a genuine, albeit slightly sarcastic smile. "Though I
She cast a curious glance over his shoulder and saw Malfoy glaring impatiently at Blaise's back from where he was standing by the exit of the classroom. "By the way, I think Malfoy is waiting for you over there, you wouldn't want to keep His Highness waiting too long." She quipped wryly.
Draco waited until the impatient scowl on Aria's face reluctantly melted away. As soon as he felt the way her body relaxed and grew pliant in his arms, Draco bent down and rewarded her with a quick, affectionate kiss.
But that thought didn't give him any comfort or satisfaction at all, because it only begged another question.
Potter." Blaise managed to wheeze out as he looked up and met Aria's smug smile with a genuinely reverent expression.
"I am pleased to be your guest lecturer for this afternoon. I hope you have not forgotten me." She spoke to them in a teasing voice, her words thick with her French accent.
Sighing, he pulled his gaze away from the former Gryffindor trio and turned back to rifle mindlessly through his notebook.
"Five minutes."
Aria winced as she stared at them, inwardly thinking to herself how either Harper or Graham could have easily picked up all of the other boys on their team in one hand and tossed them effortlessly towards the other side of the quidditch pitch like they were quaffles.
When she parted her lips even more and welcomed his bold entry into her mouth, Draco hummed in delight.
Wood noticed their ashen faces and he chuckled at them before sitting back down behind the teacher's desk.
Not surprisingly, Pansy wanted to prod at the issue further.
She could already hear the voices of some of her housemates who were already inside.
She was sitting quietly between Longbottom and Abbott and was currently scribbling something into her parchment, pausing every now and then to look up and listen to whatever their DADA professor was saying. When she felt his gaze lingering on her, she frowned and suddenly looked up, glancing at his direction. Draco flushed and hastily tore his gaze away, hiding his face behind his thick textbook.
for shutting him up?! Was I supposed to just stand back and let him talk about you like that?! That cocky asshole was asking for it!" Neville countered loudly, sounding equally furious with her reaction.
When Ron burst into snickers, Aria rolled her eyes.
"Of course you did, you prat!"
"Thanks for that." Aria retorted flatly, rolling her eyes.
"Seriously,
"Of course not, ferret-face."
Blaise rolled his eyes at her indignant huff but stood up. He automatically walked over towards her and greeted her with an affectionate kiss on the cheek.
"Speaking of lovely." Blaise spoke again, drawing both girls' attention to his flirtatious smile. "I wonder if my very
"And pray tell, exactly how is keeping my little secret in your best interest
"Because I've done it before." Aria met his shaken expression with a strained smile. "It's a
Aria managed to break herself out of her amused staring long enough to wave back dumbly at him.
Morag hummed and moved her inquisitive gaze back and forth between Aria and Draco in earnest, either oblivious to the way the two Slytherins looked horrified at her insinuation or choosing to ignore it completely. Around them, Blaise and Neville both looked as though they were desperately trying to keep from bursting out laughing while Hannah just looked curious and was watching the two former rivals with wide, doe-like eyes.
"Fleur Delacour? Seriously?" Hannah's shoulders slumped again and her scowl deepened as she picked miserably at the food on her plate. "She's not exactly an easy act to follow, being a bloody veela and all." She grumbled.
something about Potter." He pointed out.
And if that wasn't enough, she was also a veela.
"Th—thank you."
being on the Quidditch team back when you were in Hufflepuff. Why is that?" He asked innocently.
"Which one?" Ron finally looked up from the chessboard and shot both girls a curious look.
?!" Hannah snapped back at him, her face flushed as she tried to wrestle herself away from the grip he had around her arm. "I can date every damn guy I see or look however the hell I want; and you have absolutely no say on the matter!"
"The last thing I want is another war." She whispered.
"Wh—what?"
"You promised you wouldn't make fun of me."
were the one who never wanted to play with us back then! We knew nothing about you!" Pansy shot back, her eyes wide and her cheeks flushed with horrified realization.
Aria and Goyle's face as he gestured for the two students to occupy the last table at the very back of the room. "Now then, once everyone has settled in with their respective partners, let's start. As always, you'll find all the ingredients you'll be needing at the back of the room—"
"I have to be honest." She bit her lip, turning to give Draco a slightly sheepish smile. "There's actually another reason I got off work early today to see you."
Draco scowled at her words. "I'm not authorized to go into the Restricted Section."
students, usually 6th years or 7th years who witnessed her horrifying plunge during the quidditch game and wanted her to get better as soon as possible. She
They waited until they were completely out of sight before they stopped and leaned against one of the nearby bookshelves, snickering under their breaths as they listened to the two Ravenclaw girls hissing loudly at one another.
"You expect me to understand what you did based on
"It's just a muggle expression, Malfoy."
He didn't say anything else and waited patiently for her to consent, watching as she seemed to argue internally with herself while she mulled over his intentions. Finally, after a long moment, she lowered her gaze to meet his and answered his questioning look with a slow, nervous nod.
"We'll get to that."
Aria didn't answer, still chuckling as she walked past his seething form and began heading towards the cluster of brown mushrooms that littered the large patch of grass nearby.
"Give me one month." Aria cut her off with an adamant glare. "I'll find out who it is. I just need to catch this person in the act. It'll obviously happen again, because there's most likely an objective behind all of these incidents. And besides, by allowing all the expelled Slytherins to return to school, the culprit is likely to become frustrated enough to try something else." She added.
Everyone else either fell silent or '
"I'll have a gin and tonic." She answered uncertainly, folding her hands on the table.
look that Ron was giving her was more than enough of an indication for her to figure out whether her prediction about her new house was spot on.
if you will, about veelas." She explained, giving them another smile.
"Th—that is, I—"
"Abbott, I'd take it easy on the alcohol if I were you." Blaise drawled, smirking at her. "The last time you were drunk, you tried to molest me."
"Intriguing." Morag was studying both Aria and Pansy with a thoughtful expression on her face. "I've never actually had one-on-one sex with another girl before. Would you care to share some notes?" She asked, completely straight-faced.
Hannah!"
and you need to play as
"What are you,
Draco heard Zacharias Smith, who was standing a few feet to his right, mutter to Ernie Macmillan beside him. "I should have listened to my mum when she said I shouldn't go back to Hogwarts this year." He complained loudly.
, you would think that at least
"Maybe they were scared they'd be punished even more?" Blaise suggested with a shrug.
When she noticed his reaction, Aria pulled away and stared up at him with dark, heavy-lidded green eyes.
"Damn it." Aria was already digging through her pockets for another hair tie when she realized that Pansy had become strangely quiet.
Eventually, the dust cleared, but when Granger began shouting at Weasley
A little encouraged by her reaction, he set his empty glass back down onto the counter and turned around fully to face her.
She bit her lip, her lovely features creasing into a worried frown.
"I think I'm in love with her."
of these kids are guilty."
Ignoring the suspicious look he gave her, she turned away from him and closed her eyes, furiously shaking her head to clear her thoughts. When she managed to regain her composure a few minutes later, she took a deep, shaky inhale of breath and turned back around to face him, giving him a forced smile that didn't quite seem to reach her eyes.
There was a strange, magical compulsion that came with Draco's words, and it ignited that familiar, foreign presence in her head; urging her to comply. Though, unlike the Feather Curse, the compulsion she felt from her mate felt
She hadn't been lying when she told them that it had been awhile since she had the chance to play like this. In fact, the last time she remembered playing quidditch was back in their sixth year, before the war started and before everything in her life had quickly gone to shit. Of course, that didn't mean she didn't miss the familiar feeling of exhilaration she always felt whenever she was up in the air like this.
Aria suddenly paused mid-step and turned around slowly, meeting the genuinely confused look on Draco's face with a fond smile.
"None of your business." Aria answered rudely, looking away.
Aria's smile widened and she stepped closer, tilting her chin up so that they were staring directly into each other's eyes.
these things?"
She stifled a smirk, waiting anxiously until she heard the two break apart, followed by Pansy telling Neville in a hushed voice that they should go somewhere else before someone walks in on them. Just before they left, Aria peeked her head out from behind the couch again, smiling to herself as she watched the pair walk out, hand-in-hand, through the common room entrance.
"Seriously, Abbott." Zach began wheezing with laughter at her reaction. "Tell us the truth. Are you actually a promiscuous little flirt under that innocent, virginal mask of yours? Please don't tell me you're just as horny as Morag."
"I doubt that, Draco."
Aria looked up and saw the fond, exasperated smile on Hermione's face.
"Harriah Potter?"
"You're heavy." She complained, squirming underneath him.
At the sound of Draco's voice, Corey seemed to snap out of his trance. He blinked a couple of times and stared up at Draco in confusion. "What do you mean?" He asked dumbly.
After a few minutes, however, Aria noticed that Hannah was still staring at her from across the table; and it eventually came to the point where Aria couldn't stand it anymore. She gritted her teeth and looked up, meeting Hannah's doe-eyed smile at her with an exasperated glare.
Draco arched an eyebrow and shared a knowing smirk with Neville beside him.
He watched as Aria's eyes clouded over and her lower lip seemed to tremble slightly before she tucked it firmly underneath her teeth, forcing it to stop. She didn't say anything but she answered his question with a brief, barely noticeable incline of her head.
"I…kind of have a busy year ahead of me. I don't think I'll have the time to meet you with you again in awhile. My life is a mess right now, I think I need to fix that first." She whispered.
"Hey, that's a great idea." Ron chimed in, looking up and giving both girls a pleading look. "Please, 'Mione, can we all take an elective class together this year? It gets really lonely in Gryffindor without the two of you around. I only have Seamus with me for company." He said glumly, his features creasing into a pout.
A small part of him was a little relieved because he wasn't exactly sure how to approach her just yet. But still, seeing her empty seat just now irked him anyway, mostly due to the fact that ever since the resorting at the start of the year, Draco had grown used to seeing Aria everyday – whether in the common room, the Great Hall, or in one of their shared classes.
"You call playing around with plants being productive?"
but it was destroyed last year." She admitted, noting the way Corey's eyes widened in horror – as though the mere thought of a Firebolt being destroyed was the most horrible thing he had ever heard in his life. "Anyway, don't worry about it. I'll join you up in the air next time. For now, I'll stay here and keep a close watch on you." She gave him a reassuring pat on the back.
"Wh—what?!" Hannah spluttered, nearly choking on her drink as big splotches of red stained her cheeks. "Of course not! I didn't even know you were serious with all that stuff, Zabini!" She screeched at him.
"We'll be fine, Hagrid." Aria spoke up in a firm voice, cutting off Draco's yelp of pain.
"I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you—"
"Naturals are the ones who usually get these rare gifts;, as their bodies have better adapted to the infection. However, this does not mean that Rogues cannot get unique abilities too. In fact, strangely enough, though it is uncommon for Rogues to manifest unique skills, those that do are actually the ones who tend to be more powerful." Wood admitted grimly.
"Oh!"
Aria. And like it or not, you are biologically and magically driven to
"I realize that." She answered, one corner of her lips tilted upwards into a wry smile.
"Are you two…
about her presence, but he couldn't figure out what it was.
"Oh well, at least that's one down. Now, I'm just waiting to see when either you or Draco will snap and push the other into a nearby closet to shag out your problems." He added, snickering.
Aria cut off the rest of Hannah's stammering protests with a smirk and firm shake of her head.
"Potter, you don't seem to get it." Morag rolled her eyes and gave Aria a pointed look. "The reason Hannah is making such a big fuss about this is because she plans to seduce her boyfriend into bed that night.
Draco tsked and narrowed his eyes at her.
"Right…" Aria bit her lip and let the rest of her voice trail off as she stared at him, struggling for something else to talk about. "…um…well, what about after those two years then? I noticed that you're taking a track in Potions Mastery right now, is that something you plan to pursue further—"
He frowned at that, fingers gently caressing the parchment's crisp edges.
"I'm really sorry about this, but can you give me a few minutes? I'm obligated to entertain them for a bit and pose for a few pictures. I won't take long." She told him.
"Can they actually do that?" Hannah asked, turning to look at Morag in surprise.
"Just a little piece of advice, Potter. If you keep hiding this, Draco's bound to find out sooner or later. You should stop underestimating just how sharp Slytherins can be." She said in a smug tone of voice.
"About what Firenze said about you back there—"
Aria looked so positively and obscenely
"But...What are you doing?" She whispered, staring down at him with horrified green eyes.
that I'm trying to figure out about myself." She admitted quietly.
She bit her lip, scrambling to find the right words to convey exactly what she felt, but she was forced to stop when Draco suddenly spoke.
, Draco, and by choosing you as her mate, she essentially conditioned both her mind
Her head felt like it was being split into two, and there was a dull, persistent throbbing somewhere below her right shoulder. She tried to stretch her right arm; but the dull throb intensified into a sharp stab of pain that she abandoned her efforts immediately.
The confusion on Aria's face cleared and she nodded again in understanding before turning to give the other boy,
." She began, and everyone looked up, listening intently to her as she explained further. "All vampires will, at some point in their lives, acquire a fixation. Vampires are, by nature, incredibly obsessive and will eventually fixate on something. It is usually a lifelong fixation, and it becomes like a drug to them, similar to an addiction."

The anger on Ron's face instantly disappeared; only to be replaced with a grimace as he stared at her in confusion. He grunted and turned to glance at Hermione with a completely baffled look on his face.
if she knew he was interested."
"Anyway, I'll go submit these to Slughorn. When I get back, you want to get started on cleaning already?"
"I don't know." She admitted, sighing softly. "I still don't know if I believe in that whole 'mate' thing, to be honest."
" Aria looked a little pale as she stood up shakily from the ground, wrapping her arms protectively over herself.
Blaise was biting his lip, his shoulders shaking as he reached out and handed her the thick black gloves and goggles in his hand.
As they trekked their way through the rocky ground, weaving through the large expanse of tall, thick trees, Draco risked another glance at her. He noticed that she was being very careful in maintaining a good couple of feet away from him, her gloved arms wrapped firmly around her midsection to avoid any more unnecessary touching. When they stopped and gaped at the sight of a small herd of hippogriffs blocking their path, Draco blanched and, very carefully, took a step backward.
She was talking animatedly to Weasley and Granger as she walked in so she didn't see him yet, but Draco watched her anyway, noting the way she had taken to tying her long hair in a much tighter, impeccably styled braid ever since that incident in the quidditch pitch. Half of the braid was twisted into a tight coil on the top of her head, while the other half hung loosely, ending a few inches above her back.
"I know it's you."
It was glorious.
"Well Neville and the rest of the other new Slytherins will be there too." Aria offered him an apologetic smile. "I don't know about Malfoy but Zabini did tell me that Parkinson isn't going to show."
Corey jumped out of his seat and snatched the Nimbus 2001 from Aria's outstretched hand.
She sneered at him, alternating her glare back and forth between the tall boys in front of her.
Narcissa waved her concerns away and gave her a reassuring smile. "Take as much time as you need, dear. We'll just be here, after all."
Aria's eyes narrowed and she clenched her jaw but still, Pansy went on as though she didn't notice.
It made her veela blood boil like crazy.
"Save it, Weasley." Aria cut him off, rolling her eyes and using his momentary distraction to take one of his knight pieces. She ignored his protests and continued. "Besides, Luna's always been friendly with the other houses. I saw her in the library the other day with Goyle. They were doing homework together or something."
3. Yes, I know fiendfyre basically destroys everything in its path and that it can supposedly only be stopped by its caster (yada, yada) but for purposes of this story, let's just assume otherwise.
"So you
"N—no, it's okay. I—"
Aria." He gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze before he stepped back, moving to stand behind Draco just before the blond looked up.
They were both silent for awhile until he turned to glance at her again from the corner of his eye.
Blaise sounded bored as he sauntered over to the Slytherin table, yawning as he plopped down into his usual seat. He ignored the irritated look Draco gave him and scooted over the bench, helping himself to a cup of tea. When Draco just grunted at him in reply, Blaise took a long sip from his cup and glanced down at Draco's blank parchment again.
"I said I'm fine!" Draco finally lost his patience with both of them and stood up sharply, glaring at the other two Slytherins in frustration. "Look, I just wanted some time to myself! You two didn't have to go all 'Hufflepuff' and come out here just to check up on me—"
"No, I was uh…" Potter bit her lip and tugged nervously at the tail-end of her long, black braid. "I was just on my way up to get some fresh air. I like going up there. It's really nice and quiet.".
Morag rolled her eyes when most of the Slytherins didn't bother hiding their snickers at Aria's deadpan reaction.
don't want to touch it either!" Aria screamed back, gesticulating wildly at the spider with her hands.
"I think Draco is beginning to rub off on you." Blaise pretended to give her a petulant pout but Aria just rolled her eyes and ignored him.
"—besides, you don't see
off me!" She screeched angrily.
"Are you okay?"
"Is it true that veelas never age?" She asked, arching her eyebrows in slight disbelief.
A few feet behind them, Aria met Hermione's exasperated expression and tried to stifle the grin that was itching to break out on her face. She and Hermione watched helplessly as Ron continued to argue with Headmistress McGonagall about the new housing arrangements the school board had made for their eighth year at Hogwarts.
"Thank you." She mumbled.
"Don't worry so much about it, I'm sure we'll be fine. Let's just do our best to help each other out, yeah?"
"Come on, Pans. I already said I'm sorry—"
a coward. Apparently, even these centaurs think I'm not worthy enough to be with the perfect Harriah Potter—"
Unfortunately, her little comment about her gown only seemed to make Greg stiffen and blush even more.
"And I take it Malfoy and Parkinson are just jumping for joy and spewing rainbows over your little get together?" Aria couldn't help the sarcasm in her voice, smirking at the sheepish look that crossed Blaise's face.
"Not as bad as I think it is?! Salazar's sake, Hermione!" Aria's horrified, enraged screech was loud enough that Ron winced again and had to cover his ears. "Have you seen yourself?! You're a
"He was trying to get a rise out of Aria, obviously." Blaise told her, snorting at the way Draco stiffened at his words. "But since she didn't take the bait, it didn't exactly go the way you wanted it to, huh?" He smirked.
smile. At least not without some maniacal intent behind it."
"Maybe just a little."
"You were pretty good up there." She broke him out of his thoughts, her smile becoming a little playful when she saw the way his cheeks flushed pink at the compliment.
The rest of Aria's snarky retort was cut off when, surprisingly enough, the doors to the bathroom suddenly clicked open. Unfortunately, before either Pansy or Aria could react, Hannah's loud, wailing scream caused them both to back away just as the former Hufflepuff yanked the bathroom doors open.
This time, Draco had to bite his lip to stifle the amused grin that was fighting to break out onto his face.
"He responds to her mating call by touching her and speaking the following words." Fleur paused and practically beamed at him. "
Firenze." Aria looked uncomfortable at his words, scuffling her feet against the ground.
well and only seemed to make the brightness of her green eyes stand out even more.
"There, you see Malfoy?" Hagrid grinned and nodded at Aria in approval. "Don't know what you're so worried about, you've got Aria there to protect you anyway so I'm sure you'll be just fine." He chuckled.
All he really wanted this year was to graduate with as little interaction with anyone else as possible, preferably none at all. At the very least, he just wanted to get through the year without anyone noticing his existence.
You used to sweat in these!" Aria whined again, scowling as she stared incredulously at the green robes in her hand as though they were the most offensive thing she had ever seen.
Malfoy. I was
"Potter, you have a lot to learn about being a proper Slytherin if you continue to let Zabini get the upper hand on you like that." He drawled, stifling another grin when Aria flushed darker and gave him an annoyed glare.
"Don't worry about that. It'll be fine, trust me." Draco shared a quick smirk with Blaise over Aria's shoulder before he reached out and handed her the minuscule golden ball in his hand. "Now, as I said, I reckon it's about time Blaise and I introduce you to your new teammates, Potter."
"Really? I hadn't noticed." Aria retorted sarcastically, rolling her eyes before collapsing back against the pillows in exhaustion. "At least it doesn't seem to hurt as badly when my wings are fully extended like this." She admitted.
As they walked through the school's corridors, it didn't escape Aria's attention that a lot of the students from Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw had taken to shooting them angry glares now. There was also an unmistakable trail of hushed, whispers and blatant pointing that followed them everywhere they went.
starting to like that ferret-faced git, aren't you? Is it because of the veela thing?
didn't care.
"How would
She stood up from the bed, wrapping the sheets around herself as she slinked carefully over to where Draco sat, waiting for her.
They laughed quietly at each other, their actions accidentally jostling Neville a few times that he hiccuped and jerked awake in confusion.
When Draco didn't say anything and just pulled her closer against him, kissing her neck, Aria looked up again, turning her head slightly to the side to stare at something over his shoulder. She was strangely quiet for a long time after that, and eventually, Draco's curiosity got the better of him and he pulled slightly away from her so he could try to follow her gaze.
"So does
the Slytherins, you had to choose
"I said stop it!" Aria snapped.
He lifted his gaze off the ground and blinked as he found himself staring into a familiar pair of green eyes. This time, however, there was none of the usual warmth or playfulness in them that he had grown used to over the last few months. Instead, the eyes he found himself staring into were blank and lifeless, and the sight of them made Draco's blood run cold.
Pansy blinked at her again, and she looked as though she had a hard time trying to understand Aria's words.
"You'd better goddamn
Fully decked out in a pristine set of Slytherin quidditch robes, complete with all the matching protective gear, Blaise Zabini just gave her a nonplussed look and arched an eyebrow at her reluctant expression.
this year. Things haven't been this entertaining down in the dungeons ever since second year – you know, with all of that Chamber of Secrets drama and shit." He grinned teasingly at her.
actually." Blaise admitted, shrugging. "But I took the train back to Hogsmeade this morning and walked back to school."
"So after the war, I promised myself that I would splurge and invest in a beautiful home for once. One with a really nice view, and lots of space and fresh air and sunlight." She met his angry frown with a small, self-conscious smile. "That's the real reason I don't want to live in Grimmauld, actually. That house is lovely, but it's all enclosed spaces and it has too many memories of the war and Sirius. I needed to get away from all that." She whispered.
Slytherins, it wasn't Greg, Blaise, Pansy, or even Draco.
"It's not his fault! It's probably because I've always been so reserved and shy with him all these years. I can't help it, it's how I was raised! I was always so afraid of how he'd react if I became too flirty or aggressive." Hannah argued, tugging insistently on the sleeve of Pansy's robes.
"—intentionally leaving his wand in the middle of the scene? Those two 2nd years stashing the evidence in their trunks for everyone else to see? Those 1st years leaving obvious traces of their magic for us to find? It's all just too easy, isn't it? Everything just seems so blatantly…
"I'm sorry, okay?! I just didn't want to lose you!" He blurted out.
She leaned up, pressing her lips against his in a deep, intimate kiss that had their tongues teasing and lazily enjoying the familiar taste of each other. They were both flushed with arousal and slightly out of breath when they broke apart, but before Aria could pull away, Draco leaned in again, capturing her red-kissed lips in another hungry kiss.
"Aria?"
She sneered and pressed her palm down onto the tattoo; causing Fisher to scream and howl in pain as she began burning the symbols right off his skin. He thrashed wildly and tried to push her off; but Aria let out a bird-like screech and raised her other hand, swiping at his face with her claws and leaving three, painful-looking gashes across his cheek.
"The person responsible is smart then. And cunning. It certainly takes a lot of planning to be able to infiltrate all three common rooms like that without anyone noticing." Neville added darkly.
He continued as though he hadn't heard her.
Suddenly, the curiosity on Bentley's face melted away into a confused frown.
"Besides, like I said, I haven't told anyone else about your little secret. And I won't – for as long as it continues to be in my best interest to do so, at least."
"What the hell is that supposed to mean?!" Pansy demanded.
He stood up, intent on exploring the rest of her beautifully decorated flat. After some time, he realized that he didn't exactly give the place the credit it deserved when he told Aria that it was nice because the truth was, the flat was actually quite
Draco just rolled his eyes at her and made another face.
"Twenty seconds." Morag offered lightly.
His smirk grew when he saw the way Bentley's clenched fists were beginning to shake with pent-up fury.
McGonagall let her voice trail off and Aria cast a look at Corey again, noting the way his shoulders visibly slumped at the mention of his family. "…let's just say that most of the members of the school board, particularly those whose families fought the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters during the war, aren't so keen on the idea of letting him off the hook." She finished with a sigh.
"Then tell them that I personally vouch for his innocence."
were guilty of during the war!" Pansy shouted angrily at him.
"Hermione, wait up!"
"You look really good in that dress, Abbott."
So the good news is, the Yule Ball will finally be in the next chapter. ;D
"Just do it."
"It was
Skeeter gushed, giggling and clapping her hands together. "The boy who defeated the Dark Lord's snake; the heroic young leader who staged all of those rebellions against the Carrows while they were at Hogwarts. Now aren't you two just the perfect pair?"
thing."
"You can't kick me off the team, Weasley! No one else in Gryffindor is as good a Beater as I am!"
"Scotch, neat."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a minute there.
Draco immediately stiffened in surprise and turned around to find Blaise standing behind him, a small, wicked smirk tugging on the corner of his lips. When Draco just blinked and arched an eyebrow at him in confusion, Blaise grinned and spoke to him in a soft, mischievous whisper.
At the disgruntled glare Hannah gave him, Theo flinched, while all the men around the table burst into hearty snickers.
Draco's eyes automatically flicked down, staring in self-satisfaction at the mess of hickeys he had left all over her pretty neck.
Draco reflected on this for a long time before reluctantly bringing his attention back to their discussion.
Fortunately, Aria was given a temporary reprieve from all their theatrics when Blaise approached her in the common room one afternoon and handed her the new chore lists for the week. When she saw her name listed beside Blaise, both of them assigned to assist the house elves in the kitchen after dinner, Aria breathed a sigh of relief.
"That's nice to know, Bentley. Excuse me—"
"Why are you going to the Yule Ball with her then?" She asked again.
Aria was too stunned to answer so Pansy let out an exasperated sigh and hauled her up to her feet. As she stumbled her way towards the doors, Aria stole one last look at them over her shoulder. She watched in dismay as Bentley let out an impatient screech and, using his vampire strength, caught Blaise in one hand and Greg in the other. He lifted both boys up in the air as though they weighed nothing.
"What exactly is going on here?"
than publicly known every mealtime when he absolutely refused to sit at his new house table.
"Just like the first case." Aria whispered under her breath, her wings drooping.
"Weren't you going up there? Can you get lost now, Potter?" He snapped, desperate to change the subject as he glanced down and noted that she wasn't carrying any bag or letter with her.
still had nightmares about how the last time they were in there, they had to watch the Dark Lord murder that muggle studies teacher right before their eyes.
"That is false, my dear brother-in-law." Fleur smiled at him and leaned back against her seat, primly crossing one ankle over the other.
I have standards, you realize." She cast a deadpan glare at Aria beside her.
"Couldn't wait to correct him back there, could you?" He mocked loudly.
What was
Morag was smirking as she looped her arm around Ginny and leaned in to whisper something into her ear. From the heated blush on Ginny's face, it wasn't hard for Aria to guess that Morag probably said something completely inappropriate. A few meters away, Hannah was also sitting with a group of Hufflepuffs and Slytherins; and Aria's eyes widened slightly when she noticed that Theodore Nott had his arm slung casually over the back of Hannah's seat.
for fifteen minutes at a time (when he made her breakfast, stole a quick cuddle from her while she was still asleep, and kissed her sleepy, blanket-wrapped form on their bed just before he headed off to St. Mungo's).
Suddenly, it was too much; and Draco had to avert his gaze and quickly pull his hand away from hers. His throat felt tight,
, Draco clenched his fists and grew even angrier.
He immediately grimaced, however, and his eyes narrowed into tiny slits as he glared accusingly at Pansy.
"Oh please." Aria's features twisted into a scowl. "Why don't we go back to the main issue here, Draco? The way you wrote down my veela name behind my back? Tell me — exactly how am I supposed to trust you
breathing hard as he closed his eyes and rested his forehead against hers. The reprieve didn't last long, however, because as soon as he opened his eyes again, he saw the way Aria was staring hungrily at his mouth. She licked her lips, now bruised red and swollen, and lifted her burning gaze up slowly to meet his eyes.
"She's
"I think you're giving them way too much credit, 'Mione." Aria snickered under her breath.
"What about the Gryffindor Prefect who claims he was attacked that night? The one they found passed out in the common room." Aria cut her off in a sharp voice.
Unlike the last vandalism incident, there was no clear evidence this time – other than the fact that the perpetuator had
As he walked around, he noticed that all of the rooms were painted with a bright, very clean shade of white. The walls of the flat that actually faced the outside were made entirely of tall, glass windows, giving the place an impressive, panoramic view of the surrounding buildings. When he stepped out into the small balcony in the living room, Draco was greeted with a beautiful view of the streets of Central London, particularly of Whitehall.
He figured it was probably best for everyone anyway, seeing as he hasn't exactly been in the best of moods for the past few weeks.
"You didn't use a pestle to crush this, right?" She asked worriedly.
"Awww! He left you a rose! That's so sweet—"
The room was spinning.
') as well as hushed, mocking whispers (
"You do realize that you won't get pregnant purely from drinking alcohol right? Because that's not how biology works. Have you
" Aria's eyes narrowed at the particular memory and she sneered to herself, shaking her head.
"Where's Pansy?" Malfoy suddenly asked, cutting Blaise off and frowning at the other boy.
"Go to hell—"
"Be patient, and I promise I'll make it up to you later."
He gasped when she ground herself against him, instantly causing all of the blood in his body to rush down and pool somewhere below his belt. His hand slipped underneath the hem of her skirt and grabbed at the back of her thigh, hoisting the leg she had wrapped around his waist even higher.
"It's okay." He told her, caressing her flushed cheek with his thumb. "If you're not ready to talk about all of this right now, then we don't have to."
"It was a joke!" Ron protested, sniffing.
Draco stared at her for a long moment, and he made sure to keep the expression on his face completely blank. He struggled to form the most appropriate response to her question.
Unfortunately, something work related came up so the next chapter might take a little longer than usual. Not to worry though, I'll definitely post it within 2 (latest 3) weeks. As always, kudos, reviews and comments are more than welcome! :D
"Brilliant." Aria grumbled, looking resigned. "And since I'm unmated, how long will I have to stay in here?"
Each of those questions left Draco feeling more than a little hurt, but he didn't exactly know why.
Weasley grinned at Draco's reaction. "I promised that whoever manages to beat her, gets 500 galleons. But I charge them 1 galleon per try." He added smugly.
"You were a
As they began levitating the banner up to drape over the windows, Blaise suddenly walked over to them. He grinned widely and slung a heavy arm around Draco's shoulder.
"I...see."
He managed to school his expression back into a nonchalant mask when Aria finally tossed her long hair back away from her face, most of the dark locks already dry, and glanced at him, offering him a shy smile.
"—frankly, she told me to crawl up my own ass and die so I reckon she might be busy that night." He admitted, rolling his eyes when he heard Aria snicker.
"You would at least expect them to impose punishment that's more
; but I managed to convince Robards to let me take the rest of the day off. I think I earned it after two weeks of overtime anyway."
His head was swimming with so many thoughts.
"No, it's not that either—"
"Entertainment?" She echoed in confusion.
To Draco's confusion, Aria continued to look a little disoriented for a few more seconds, her eyes dazed and her slim shoulders heaving as she tried to catch her breath.
When she saw the way Aria was gaping at her, Hermione rolled her eyes and gave her an exasperated look.
" Aria snapped irritably at him, rolling her eyes. "And not that it's any of your business, but it's not like I was on vacation or something. I
"...oh."
"But I
She ignored the way Bentley's eyes flashed in outrage at her words and smirked at him, watching as he took a nervous step away from her and cradled his injured hand to his chest. "All this talk about trust and me suspecting my housemates, I'm beginning to think you know something I don't. Is there something you want to tell me, Bentley?" She mused in a light, dangerously casual tone of voice.
" She pointed out wryly.
Set aside the fact that the boy always looked as though he had a perpetual scowl on his face, Goyle was actually a
"B—but—" Ron sputtered, looking completely at a loss for words as he stared at the sheet in McGonagall's hand which displayed their new house assignments.
Aria shook her head as she followed Neville to the end of the Slytherin table.
He yanked her toward him by her legs and spun her around, pulling her up and manhandling her roughly onto her knees. His hands squeezed at her ass, giving it a brief, stinging slap that made her gasp before he thrust into her from behind and shoved her head down against the pillows.
"You wrote down her name?!" Pansy screeched and whacked him hard on the arm. "What the bloody hell were you thinking?! Did you not learn anything in class?!"
As always, reviews, comments and/or kudos are love! <3
But then again, if Draco understood correctly what had happened between them when he had touched her, then it meant that her veela blood wanted him. And that one thought was throwing Draco completely off balance because it meant something else that he never thought could be possible in his lifetime.
When he finally made it to the classroom, he caught sight of a couple of his female classmates hovering by the entrance, squealing and giggling amongst themselves as they peered through the doors. Glancing around the room, Draco walked over to his usual seat beside Neville and Pansy and gave them a curious look.
me for bringing such humiliation on our family name, but my mother will probably have me locked up in an all-girl boarding school!"
"Is '
"Did you just fall over?!"
"Thanks, Pans. Maybe later. Not really in the mood."
As soon as he was gone, she turned her attention back to Draco, the expression on her face unusually soft as she stared at him.
"What are some examples of these gifts, Instructor?" Morag asked curiously.
"Well, she's... infected."
"Oh Aria."
done this for another girl before?" She countered.
Draco couldn't resist turning his head and giving her a tender kiss on her cheek.
Aria swallowed slowly and stared up at her with an imploring look in her eyes.
I suppose."
Draco stared dumbly at her, his jaw hanging open in disbelief.
of this is our fault!" She blurted out, her voice cracking as another sob tore itself from her throat.
Blaise's grin widened and he leaned in even closer, causing Morag to stiffen when his lips brushed against her cheek.
"Is that a threat, Malfoy?" She growled.
"That's enough, both of you." Blaise suddenly spoke up in a sharp voice, cutting into the middle of Pansy's tirade. "No one's judging anyone of
"Ilyana Zabini is hardly the best example to emulate for veelas, Draco. Besides, if you think that Aria would be 'settling' by being with you, then clearly you don't quite understand the true concept of a veela's mate."
From the way she was panting and staring mindlessly up at the ceiling, Draco seriously doubted she even realized that she had transformed but he certainly wasn't complaining anymore. Instead, he continued to lap at her, sucking away all traces of her orgasm until Aria was convulsing violently. She sobbed and tried to push his head away, pleading for him to stop.
There was a large crowd of spectators already waiting for them when they arrived. Aria waited until the Aurors managed to clear a small path for her before she slowly made her way over to the elevated platform in front of the large fountain of the Ministry's atrium lobby.
She smiled at the hesitation that continued to linger on his face and went on.
"I'm not so sure Draco would want that. He has a lot of plans in the next few years." Estelle pointed out, crossing her arms and giving Emma a chastising look. "And you should probably keep your hands to yourself, Emma. You remember what happened the
Aria arched an eyebrow at the nervous smile on his face and waited patiently until he finished taking a sip from his own glass of wine. Then, chuckling to herself, she leaned back languidly against her seat and answered him with a knowing smirk.
"Alright, alright!" Aria sighed and reached up, massaging her temples in annoyance. "I er…Well, to tell you the truth, if I were in your place right now, I wouldn't even be bothering with this whole 'night of seduction' thing you're planning out. In fact, I'd probably just stop thinking about the little details so much and just go for it."
The cold, evening air around Hogsmeade had begun to strengthen into a chilly breeze, blowing constantly against his face and making him shiver every few seconds, even despite the thick coat, gloves and the scarf he was already wearing. Coupled with the tiny specks of snow that had begun to accumulate into a steadily growing pile on the ground, Draco was more than ready to go back inside
sorry! I swear, I didn't mean to hit you, I would never—"
swarming me all the time were bothering me and that she could give me a charm necklace to help ward them off. She also said something about how being around
"By the way." Draco frowned when he realized something, watching as the next train to London began pulling up onto the station's platform. "I'm really sorry but what did you say your name was again?" He asked.
"Y—you joined the Slytherin quidditch team?" He blurted out.
He remembered the strange softness in Potter's green eyes as she let Narcissa hug her back before she pulled away slowly.
"Your aim is
"Nice to see our beloved golden princess finally up and about. You certainly took your sweet time procrastinating in the hospital wing, did you?" He drawled.
green or forest green. Although in some cases, I
Aria accepted it with a grateful nod, and she moved aside to let him settle down into the seat beside her. They sat in companionable silence for awhile, quietly drinking their butterbeer as they watched the rest of their housemates dancing around the field to some music device that Blaise had set up somewhere in the middle of the tent.
Aria flinched at his words.
"About lying to the Headmistress and to the Minister?" Pansy bit her lip as she followed Aria into the classroom and closed the doors behind them. "Would you really use your influence to do something like that?" She asked.
Aria sighed, trying to remember where she had left her wand the night before. When she realized that it was under her pillow, and that she was too lazy to walk back over to her bed to get it, she waved a hand over the fireplace instead, wordlessly adjusting the wards. From the other side of the room, Pansy arched an eyebrow at her, obviously never having seen her display wandless magic before.
"Leave them out of your ridiculous little stories, Skeeter." Aria ground out, narrowing her eyes at her in warning. "If you want an interview with me, I can give you one —
you'd think a hurricane swept through the room. It was absolutely disgusting."
"Would anyone like to have a screaming match in the common room with me next week?"
"I see." Narcissa's lips twitched into a smile. "I can only assume from your reaction that you care about her a lot. So why don't you tell me the truth, darling. Are you in love with Aria Potter?"
"I think he's down there already." Blaise answered, taking a sip from his tea. "He said he had to meet his father early this morning."
Corey blinked again, biting his lip as he flicked his uncertain gaze back and forth between the books and Draco. "I—I suppose I was? I'm not really sure but...I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to go through your things—"
"Ah, so you noticed that they shagged too, did you?" Blaise smirked and rewarded Luna with a peck on the cheek.
She sat down on one of the empty tables near the back, smirking as she watched Hannah flirting with Austin Flint a few meters away. Pansy and Morag were with her, both girls looking completely worn-out as they tried to keep Hannah from molesting Austin in public. Luckily, Austin didn't seem to mind Hannah's drunken advances either way, and when Hannah giggled and clutched onto his arm, Austin just grinned and introduced her to the rest of his friends.
"B—but—" Ron continued to look desolate as he cast another pleading look at Hermione, grabbing her hand and pulling her against him. "—what if you start spending time with one of those Ravenclaw boys, realize they're smarter and better than I am? Please Hermione, don't leave me!" He wailed, this time causing
"Who are
"This one with you…The fair-haired one." He paused and waited until Aria followed his gaze to where Draco was still clutching his wand tightly in his hand behind her. "If my memory serves me correctly, I do believe I recognize his face. He was also there that night; he was one of their kind…Was he not?" He asked.
freak out, okay? There's something quite…
"Oh no no
Draco's cheeks immediately reddened at the insinuation of Hagrid's words.
The infectiousness of his handsome smile was almost ridiculous because she barely even realized that she was smiling back at him.
Wordlessly, Pansy finished the last of her drink and began fixing her things. As she did this, Aria stole another glance at her from the corner of her eye. She watched as Pansy paused and seemed to stare thoughtfully at the flower Neville had left, a strange, unreadable look on her face. Then, muttering grumpily to herself about '
"Isn't that
He continued to ghost his hand all over her body, exploring and experimenting with their new connection.
"Well, that was unexpectedly
The former Gryffindor looked just as confused about what had happened as
"Something like that." Neville answered Zabini with an embarrassed smile. "Back in the boys' dorms in Gryffindor, we had a designated person who was in charge of waking up everybody else in time for breakfast. Usually, that assigned person would be rotated from the first years."
"Blimey, is that you, Aria?! I was wonderin' when you'd be assigned to me! How are you feelin'? No more injuries? I heard you just got out of the hospital wing." Hagrid greeted, eliciting a laugh from Aria as she rushed toward the half-giant and enveloped him in a brief hug.
Frankly, the thoughts Draco had around her were downright
of what it means to be a bloody Gryffindor. Obviously, the sorting hat is mental!"
"I have no intention of participating in this ridiculous discussion." Draco retorted coldly, speaking up for the first time since their study session had started. He didn't say anything else and simply bent down to scribble something into his notes.

Skeeter's face lit up with glee when she reached Aria, her beady eyes immediately scrutinizing their group with the senses of a hawk about to attack its prey. "What a lovely group of young ladies and gentlemen we have here. So...Aria Potter."
Astoria frowned, looking a little annoyed by his behavior, but she went on. "—As I was saying, I was wondering if you'd like to go to the Yule Ball with me? You know,
From the other end of the classroom, Megan Jones raised her hand and Fleur gave her an encouraging smile.
"Do you really want me to get into that now?! Just use it and make her stop!" Pansy snapped.
"Potentia Par Vis." Aria looked confused as she shook her head, trying to ignore the stares and whispers of the other students who had begun to crowd around them. "What does it mean?"
If that wasn't libelous enough, Skeeter also went on to report about how Aria probably developed some kind of 'attention-seeking' disorder as an after effect of the war; and not only did she crave the attention, but that sleeping around with a lot of men was apparently Aria's way to 'cope' with all of the trauma she experienced in her life. Skeeter then compared Aria's hedonistic behavior to a lot of other high-profile, celebrity veelas; and she even went as far as making a poorly-masked reference to 6th-time divorcee Ilyana Zabini. She ended her article with a detailed rant about how veelas were an absolute menace and how she thought all of them should be cast out of magical society altogether.
Luckily, Draco didn't seem to notice her embarrassing behavior (and thank Merlin for that, because Aria was certain that the bloody git would never let her hear the end of it) because he was much too busy staring and being amazed at all the strange new sights. His eyes flicked from one muggle contraption to another, and every now and then, he tugged on Aria's arm, demanding that she tell him exactly what it was.
Even now, while she was preoccupied with her conversation with Granger, Weasley and Longbottom, there were students, particularly
"Hey, I just thought of something!" He exclaimed, hoisting his broom up on his shoulders and running up the bleachers to where Ron and Aria were seated. He ignored the bemused expression on Ron's face as he plopped down onto the seat beside Aria and gave her an excited, slightly pleading look.

"That, Potter, was Zabini's very own special,
"What?!" He snapped.
after all, who knows what they'll try to pull once we're drunk?!" She hissed warningly at them, completely oblivious to the way Morag rolled her eyes and the way Aria had to bite her tongue to stifle her laughter.
Where Pansy's features were sharper and more defined, Corey's was rounder and unlike Pansy, his eyes were bright with mischief and excitement. His hair was also lighter than Pansy's – a soft, auburn brown color – and it complemented the light hues of his big, blue eyes.
"That Chaser girl in Gryffindor with the insanely strong throw?" Blaise shook his head and pretended to give Zach a serious look. "You should probably keep your hands to yourself tonight. I should know, she hit
Aria grimaced at his words and closed her eyes, lowering herself back down onto the bed. After a few minutes of silence, Ron turned to her again, and there was a slightly worried frown on his face as he watched her.
As always, reviews, comments and kudos are love!
Draco looked up from his neatly written notes, watching as Fleur Delacour held a single, pristine white feather up into the air for everyone in class to see. A couple of students raised their hand and Fleur nodded at one of them, watching patiently as a Ravenclaw named Lisa Turpin straightened in her seat and answered.
