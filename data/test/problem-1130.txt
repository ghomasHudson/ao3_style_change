Pansy held Draco tighter than she ever had and began to calm.  “Well, if we are done being mushy then let’s get down to business.  Who is your mate?  How does this really affect you?  Do your parents know?  Do you have wings?  Oh Draco, please tell me you have wings.  I demand to see them.  Strip right this instant and show them to me.” She smiled lecherously at him and batted her eyelashes.
Draco looked over at Harry and saw the tears streaming down his face.  “I never knew.  How – no, why did you hide how hurt you still were before you left?  How didn’t your overdose make news?  God, Draco, why did you do that to yourself?”
“Draco, that’s a huge accomplishment.  Congratulations.  I knew you were skilled in potions, but to be honest I never realized just how skilled.”  Until Slughorn took over as Potions professor Hermione had always been beaten by Draco in that class.  She assumed it was nothing more than house discrimination by Snape, but the fact of the matter was there was no way she ever could see herself coming close to what Draco had started to attain in his 6
“You might be a knobhead, but you are our knobhead.  Besides, I’ve done worse to you over the years than whatever slight you’re imagining you’ve done to us.”  Ron hugged Harry back before asking “We’ve not missed breakfast, have we?”
“Back in my muggle school they had what they called Field Day.  Individually and as teams we would have to work together for a goal in competitive events.  Families would come and watch their loved one’s race around to see who could run the fastest and jump the highest.  Give it a month or two for friendships to form with other houses.  Announce before we leave for Yule there will be our own Hogwarts Field Day in April or May.  Teams must consist of more than one house.  We will have to change the events obviously, but it’d make people work together if they want to win.  Maybe we could charge a small fee for tickets so we could have a cash prize for first, second, and third place over all events?  I don’t know…. it’d need some more work and fleshing out but it’d be easy enough to put together.”
He also spent time working with the goblins at Gringotts on how to disperse some of the money and properties Dumbledore had left behind.  He set up vaults for Hermione, the Weasley’s, Luna, Neville, and Teddy and deposited 25,000 galleons in each of those.  The other members of Dumbledore’s Army all received 5,000 galleons each.  For the members who had lost their lives along the way a memorial was being erected depicting them and listing their accomplishments.  Harry donated 50,000 to Hogwarts for rebuilding and remodeling that was needed after all of the destruction.  St. Mungo’s received 50,000 to go towards a ward for werewolves to be named the Remus Lupin Ward.  He donated another 50,000 to start a werewolf outreach program that required collaboration between the Ministry and St. Mungo’s.  Greyback had turned many innocent witches and wizards during the last few months of the war and there was a huge struggle to help them all.  After visiting the small cottage near Hogwarts Harry discovered it wasn’t quite small at all.  It was a rather spacious 2 story home with a huge yard.  He hired a wizarding architecture firm to renovate it into a small primary day school and named it Deerfield.  With a lot of help from Professor McGonagall he had found a Headmistress and quickly was able to set up a fund for her to use as she needed to hire teachers and for scholarships for students in need.
Questions pushed aside as nothing more than the whining of a child no matter that he hadn’t actually voiced them aloud he took a deep breath and pulled the box closer to him.
He took a deep breath and asked Ragnok what exactly Dumbledore had left him.  Ragnok handed him a paper listing 5 vaults with totals in them that made his eyes bulge.  He knew Dumbledore wasn’t poor but he didn’t realize he was that well off.  “Sir, I’m too astonished to do much with the vaults today.  I would like to come back in the next few weeks and disperse the gold then, if that suits you?” Harry asked.  “For today, would it just be possible to get a listing of properties and locations that I currently own?”
Dumbledore had left him 4 properties.  One called Eagle’s Landing that appeared to be another large manor, a cliffside cabin off the coast of Wales, a small cottage near Hogwarts, and something called Phoenix Perch.  There was no description of Phoenix Perch just the coordinates.   Harry was quite eager to explore both the cottage near Hogwarts and Phoenix Perch but he had no idea what to do with all of these houses.  Between the gold, the property, and the puzzle Harry knew exactly who he needed to help sort through the mess.  It was time to reconnect with Ron and Hermione.
As he felt the last of his hangover leaving he started thinking about Smoke once again.  The elusive person had not been far from his mind since the day he read Dumbledore’s letter.  He had no clue how to go about finding out who it was or what might help track them down.  He had debated simply writing a letter for Luna to publish in The Quibbler explaining just how much the wizarding world owed Smoke and urging them to come forward.  Upon further thought he realized that even though that was the easiest route, it could prove fatal as well.  There were still a handful of rouge Death Eaters out and if any suspected who it might be they could be killed.  On top of that, Smoke might not like the notoriety.  They hadn’t come forward themselves and short of being killed in the final battle that seemed to be the case.  Harry couldn’t fault them for that.  He hated that every tidbit about him was reported as if it was the world’s right to know.  For now, he’d wait and listen.  Hopefully by Christmas he’d at least have a few more hints.
Harry shrugged.  “I have always been pretty secretive about things.  Growing up as I did it was second nature to feel one way but act another.   I’ve always struggled with not really fitting completely in with the Gryffindor mindset.  It’s been said by many that I’m the Slytherin in Gryffindor, little do they know how close to the truth it is.”
Draco looked upon the tear streaked face and felt shame so deep and heavy he thought he might fall.  “I find this acceptable I suppose.” Draco groaned.  He wrapped his arms around her tightly, kissed her temple, and whispered in her ear how much he had also missed her.
Astronomy @ midnight
They all summoned a quill and parchment and wrote down their entry.  “I’ll clear the table off and get the shots ready.  Join me, Potter?” Pansy drawled.
There was a sharp tapping at the window.  Draco looked over to see Artemis, Blaise’s owl, at the window.  He opened the window to allow her in and called a house elf for owl treats.  “Have a rest, lovely.  I’ll send off a reply soon.” Draco quietly stated.  As he broke the wax seal and skimmed the contents he was surprised at how quickly Blaise followed up with the information.  Upon reading he understood why he sent it less than 2 hours after he left the manor.
“He was a very complicated and secretive man.  I don’t think many people ever really knew who he was and I can relate to that even if it is for different reasons.  He was a complete dick both in public and private to me and many others.  However, he is one of the reasons I’m still alive today so ignoring that feels untrue. Most importantly is how absolutely furious he’s going to be about it.  I can’t wait until his portrait is finally hung in McGonagall’s office so I can tell that version of him.  I’m sure he’s watching over us all and fuming now as it is.”
Last night was still surprising to him.  He had never had a problem with other houses exactly.  It was more that he had a problem with certain people in houses.  If someone had told him when he was in his 6
As far as it making news, there’s potions to help with addiction and withdrawal.  Between those and a story about a strong case of laryngitis, it was easy to keep it hidden.  Actually, the only people besides the healers that know are Benji, myself, and now you.   The band all believes the story about sickness and vocal rest.”  Draco sighed.  “Harry, I’ve done so many things I’m not proud of in my life.  I couldn’t begin to even pick out a worst but I’ve never felt as empty or as lost as I did last night when I found out what I’d unknowingly left behind.  Please, give me a chance to show you how sincere I am in saying I want to be a part of his life.” He looked up into Harry’s eyes and didn’t know if he was imagining the flash of hurt or not but decided to lay all his cards on the table anyway.  “I would also like a chance to be a part of yours if there is a place for me.  If not, I understand, but I would like to get to know my son either way.  Can you please tell me about him?”
year?  I thought Ron was going to explode he was so upset.” Seamus chimed in.
Harry cycled through so many emotions over the next few seconds he couldn’t catalog them all if he tried.  He made his best attempt at nonchalant and said “Is that so? Well, good for him.  Where were you wanting to eat for lunch?  Should we grab anything for George while we are out?”  He knew his attempt to change the conversation wouldn’t fool Fred, but he needed more time to process the fact that Draco was back in town.  It would no doubt require multiple breakdowns and several bottles of Firewhiskey.
“Death Eater scum shouldn’t be allowed back in the school.  You’d better watch your back, Malfoy.”  Draco rolled his eyes at the passing Ravenclaw.  Expected or not you’d think they could at least come up with decent insults and threats.
“Of course, Mr. Potter, you can come back at any time and we can combine the vaults or direct the gold to wherever you would like it to go.  It’s no trouble at all.  If you’d like to owl ahead and request an appointment we could provide you with a portkey to activate 5 minutes prior to bring you directly to this room to avoid crowds if it is more convenient as well.”  Ragnok quietly summoned smaller goblin and instructed him to check and make a list of all properties under Harry’s ownership.
Draco had heard of The Dragon’s Lair but had yet to visit it.  It was a newer club that straddled Diagon and Knockturn Alley known for loud energetic crowds and heavy-handed bartenders.  He had hoped the party would be a private affair but when had fate dealt him a fair hand?  He sighed and bowed his head in defeat knowing he still had to go as he had given his word.  He knew if he did his mother would simply use it as ammunition for her campaign for his return to school.  He penned a quick reply to Blaise, sent Artemis off with it, then set off to brew for another hour or two before he had to start getting ready for the party.  He was close to a break through on improving the taste of Skele-Gro and could soon move on to ways to reduce the pain the potion brought.  Hopefully that would improve his mood enough so he’d be fit for company tonight.
year Defense class will be held in a different classroom than it is currently taught due to scheduling difficulties so I will have you meet your Professor in the Great Hall after breakfast on the first Thursday morning of your classes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~HPDM~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thankfully the crowds were light and no one had any interest in the average looking blond boy making his way to Gringotts.  It was nice to occasionally visit the wizarding world anonymously like this but it required a concentration that he’d normally fail to keep if he attempted conversation or stayed out too long.  He was much better at it in short bursts like he was currently taking advantage of to make it up the street to the bank.  If Polyjuice Potion didn’t taste so awful and contort the body in the oddest ways he might seriously consider using it more often.  Maybe he should talk to the twins to see if there was something they could come up with to suit his needs.
“Wow, thanks Pans.  Love you too.”  Pansy held a dear spot in his heart.  Contrary to the school’s rumor mill the two had never dated but were instead simply the best of friends.  He was thankful to call both Blaise and Pansy his best friends and his love for both ran very deep.
Harry nearly startled at seeing Draco’s smile aimed at him.  He couldn’t remember single time he’d seen Malfoy smile at anyone without lacing it with mockery and scorn.  Maybe that was the point?  Malfoy was an arsehole but Draco seemed as if he could be decent if given the chance. “I recommend we go upstairs and pick out rooms, change into something more comfortable, then come back down here and play a drinking game or two, Draco.” Harry smiled back at him. “It’s not like any of us have to get up early in the morning.”
“Harry.  It would depend on quite a few things, Pansy.  Would you?”
The final ride to Hogwarts for the Slytherins was peppered with random 6
Hermione knew Harry had described the way his class selection would go exactly as he said it would and refused to be too offended.  After all this time they each other as well as they knew themselves.  “Ok, fine.  I concede that you have summarized our likely conversation, but I do think you should take more classes than I know you are going to pick.  As long as that is on record we can move on.  Where are you wanting to go shopping?  Muggle or wizarding clothing?”
“I’d need loads of help but, I guess I could try.  Maybe the 8th years could work together to figure out the events and how it would work?  We don’t have enough to compete so it could be our legacy if you will.”
“Hear, hear!” The group nearly shouted.
Draco was furious with his father’s schemes and lies.  He had been harshly punished when his father found out he was eyeing up more wizards than witches.  Not with his hands, no that was too muggle for Father.  The man wasn’t one of the Dark Lord’s most trusted for no reason.  Some of the spells he’d suffered under the man’s wand were the stuff of nightmares.  A mixture of Dark Arts and lovely secret Malfoy family spells.  He doubted he’d ever forgive Pansy for that.   Her jealousy and envy led her to tell her father who used it to hold over his father’s head.  He still hadn’t figured out how that was supposed to endear him to her, but he’d never really understood the workings of her head as it was.
for so long, they both lost any semblance of who they were.  They’ve been at St. Mungo’s since then with no hope to ever regain cognitive function.  From what I understand, Neville visits often and always has, but they have no clue who he is nor do they remember his visits.
Anyway, I guess I’m getting ahead of myself.  At this point, I know the potion would need to be administered before the spell, but until I finish it, I’m not sure how long before or how many doses would be needed.”  He grabbed his notes on ingredients and past failures and the three spent the rest of the day locked in his room discussing theory and interactions.
“Without a doubt, Ron.” Harry smiled at Ron across the table.  He knew how scared Ron was of living in his shadow but he had nothing to fear.  Even if Harry had joined training with him it wouldn’t take long before Ron proved them all wrong and showed just how adept at the training he would be.  “Term starts in just a couple of weeks, why don’t the three of us spend some time relaxing at Phoenix Perch?”
Before Harry replied he realized it had been a while. He saw them after the final battle and then they attempted to go out to celebrate a week later which had ended when they were mobbed when walking into the Leaky. They exchanged owls discussing trying again but Harry felt too much pressure from Ginny to rekindle their relationship to go to the Burrow and plans just became vague and drifted away. The last owl he remembered sending off was well over 3 weeks ago. He was both shocked and ashamed. How had he not realized he had ceased communication with his two best friends? Why was it so easy to let it slip away? Shame faced he looked Sirius in the eye and admitted he couldn’t even recall when it was or what they had spoken of. He had no idea where they were or what they were doing.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~HPDM~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The day went as Harry thought it would.   Fred, Caelum, and Harry had lunch at the Leaky, Molly agreed to watch Caelum, Harry helped Fred close up the shop, and Harry picked up his son from the Burrow covered in dirt, flour, and some substance he was afraid to examine too closely.
As Minerva looked out over the hall she noticed many different emotions flickering across faces.  Disbelief, anger, pride, acceptance, and what touched her the most was the relief she saw on the faces of not only the Slytherins but several from the other houses as well.  “Now, I have trust you will take my words to heart and think before acting rashly.  Tomorrow starts your classes so it is best you get to bed for a good night of rest now.  I do ask that the 8
“Good morning!  Glad you managed to rouse the boy from bed.  Harry have a seat and chat with your friends.  If you’ll keep an eye on Ted I’ll pop out and pick up breakfast for all of us.” Sirius offered.
Pansy couldn’t hide her amusement at how frustrated the pair was.  Sure, she could have warned both that shopping wasn’t a quick trip for any of them but an all-day event, but she decided to see instead how far they were willing to indulge the whims of others.  Draco and Blaise could happily spend all day in this monstrosity of a building looking in every corner of every store and still want to do more shopping afterwards.  She had to admit, a lot of the clothing wasn’t terrible.  There were a few outfits for her she had stuffed in Draco’s mountain of clothes.   Plus, it was nice to be over looked by people walking by.  The public outcry hadn’t been as bad for her as it had been for some, but she still faced a lot of vitriol from the wizarding world.  Not one person glared, spat, or yelled at her so far.  A few even smiled at her as they walked past.
With that an elf popped in with two plates and a jug of juice.  As they served themselves and got settled in to eat, Minerva collected her thoughts.   She had a lot she wanted to change and she hoped that this young man before her would be part of the Hogwarts family for years to come so sharing her vision with him didn’t seem out of order.  “I have many things I’d like to see happen.  The most radical thing I’d like to change is the house system. I’ll be the first to admit that my pride in Gryffindor is abundant.  However, we split the students on their first night in the castle and most of the time they never cross house lines again.  It is important to have classmates and friends who understand you.  I doubt a first year Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy could have found a single thing in common enough to wish to spend even 5 minutes of time together pleasantly.  Having a safe place to return to, such as the common room, is very important.  But so is meeting others outside of your comfort zone.  I’m hoping that the rest of the school sees the people in your year having fun together both in the halls and outside of them as well.  One tiny spark sometimes is all it takes.”
On the opposite side and across from Harry’s room was Draco’s room.  Next was Blaise’s room, then Theo, then there was the girl’s room, finishing out with the boy’s room.
Back at the kitchen table in Grimmauld the box sat in front of them.  It was both benign and menacing at the same time.  Harry could open it and find Dumbledore had left him a letter explaining exactly what he meant but didn’t feel able to say with the chance of Ministry interference.  Or it could be another wild goose chase looking for unknown objects with no clue where to begin. Could he simply push the box in the back of his closet and pretend it never existed?  How important could this really be?  And most importantly, why did Dumbledore seem to think Harry was the one that needed to deal with it?
“Morning Nev, not much.  Just about to send my owl off to McGonagall with my classes. Have you got any plans for the day?”
It was a somber crowd that now gathered among the couches at The Dragon’s Lair.  Seamus was never one to dwell on depressing thoughts when it was much easier, even if not healthy, to drown them with alcohol.  “Okay you wankers, we aren’t letting those arseholes ruin the night completely.  Let’s all raise a toast to Neville Longbottom!  Beheader of man eating snakes, leader of the rebellion, defender of us all, and the man with the biggest bollocks I’ve ever seen.”

He stopped abruptly in the middle of the street and cast a
years would spark a shakeup.
“So….you have how many houses and you choose to live in this dump?” Ron wondered.  Unfortunately for him Sirius had apparated back just in time to hear his insult.  He smacked the back of Ron’s head and began handing out the takeout he’d brought in for them all.  “HEY! You know what I mean, Padfoot.”
Arithmancy
Hermione smiled happily.  She adored ‘her boys’ as she’d come to think of Harry and Ron, but there was a part of her that had always longed for someone to share this part of herself with.  Before finding out she was a witch her parents and her could be found spending hours talking and debating all kinds of historical facts and thoughts about new scientific advances.  Weekends were spent at museums and public lectures whiles summers were filled with trips all over the world to satisfy the thirst she’d always had to learn.  There was a knowledge gap now that just couldn’t be crossed between them and it sometimes broke her heart.  She had come to accept that while she could still soak up everything she could find in books she’d never really have that connection with someone again.  “I would love that, Theo.  We’ll see you back in the common room later, Harry.”  She kissed Harry’s cheek and walked away with Theo with a hope in her heart that her new acquaintance would soon become her friend.
He’d always been the kind to just rush in and damn the consequences so with the decision made to find a house he decided to head to Gringotts and see if there were any Potter properties he’d inherited that would fit his purposes.  He quickly applied a glamor to disguise his face and hair and apparated to Diagon Alley.
The floor of Harry’s bedroom was covered in wadded up parchment he had yet to vanish.  He’d tried so many different ways the past hour to express his regret that he’d let things slip so far with his best friends.  He finally decided just to put the quill to the parchment and be as honest as he knew to be.
For the potion, there needs to be both a reparative and possibly a restorative.  I am 50/50 on if the restorative part is even possible and in some cases, it might prove unnecessary, but the memories of Neville visiting through the years have to be locked away somewhere.  I think if we rejuvenate the brain and nerves and immediately repair them afterwards we’d be on the right path.
year.  I knew I had an aunt in Azkaban, but I had never met her to my knowledge.  No one ever told stories of her or spoke of why she was imprisoned.  I, obviously, knew it had to do with Snakeface, but no details.
“Not really.  Hannah is doing something today with Susan and I haven’t really made a decision what to do yet.  Figured I’d wait to see what everyone else gets up to and maybe tag along if someone decides to get into something.”
Draco’s laughter was filled with mirth and pain.  “Indeed.  So, care to tell me how it’s not that bad again?”
Harry laughed out loud at the simplicity of Pansy’s confession.  “Well, never would have pegged you as a closet Lion but sticking to the theme I’ll tell you something no one living knows.  The sorting hat wanted me in Slytherin.”  Harry smirked when Pansy choked on her drink.  “Yup, I almost joined you all in the snake pit.  I’m sure Snape would have sliced and diced me up for ingredients before the end of first year.”
Lunch
“I refuse to allow you to remain locked away in that stuffy manor any longer.  You will join Blaise or I at least once a week, in public, doing whatever we deem appropriate.  That is your present to me.  I will accept no less.” Pansy demanded as she dried her eyes.
As the wind blew through the stands Harry couldn’t help but feel everything was falling into place almost perfectly.  It had been a long time since things had lined up so well and he couldn’t help but fear that things were almost too easy.  “Draco, are you sure?  I don’t want you to give your life up only for you to regret it and be resentful years down the road.  If you want to continue with the band, it will be difficult, but not impossible.  With all the technology out there now and portkeys, we can figure something out.”
Draco looked up at the door each time the bell rang in hopes it was Harry.  He’d gotten here almost an hour early because he could no longer sit and wait at the Manor.  It was now a few minutes after 8 and he was so anxious he was about to burst.  He told himself to calm down and take a deep breath and didn’t hear the bell the next time it rang which signaled Harry’s entrance.
“Potter, I can’t be remorseful if I have no remorse to feel.  You look stunning and you know it so shut up and buy me a drink, dear.”
“I don’t think it will be that far off.  I said earlier we were tired of fighting and I think that goes for many others in the school as well.  You’ll always have the ones who will refuse to try, but the vast majority I think just want to enjoy themselves finally and learn.   I myself am only taking a few classes this year so I can relax and finish out a year without trouble.”
Harry was certain being trampled by a herd of hippogriffs would feel better than he currently did. He cracked his eyes open to the nightstand next to his bed and saw, like always, Hermione thought of everything.  He reached for and downed the hangover potion as quickly as his body allowed and then laid in bed letting it soothe away the worst of his symptoms.
The rest as they say, was history.  The crowds doubled with Draco as the lead singer the first six months and by a year they were sold out constantly.  It wasn’t long until they had a record deal and a few gold and platinum albums.  No one looked at him any more as if he was scum when they heard his name.  It was what he had always wanted….wasn’t it?
Hannah laughed and pulled a few her way.  “It’s ok love, I’ll assist you.  I don’t think there’s a rule against that and if there is I don’t care.”  She placed a kiss on his lips and smiled at him.  She was glad she listened to him and came down instead of going to bed.  While she wasn’t sure any of them would ever be lifelong friends, she could see the benefit of getting to know each other.
“I can understand wanting to live under the radar, but even if they don’t want the world to know, I need to know just to thank them for what they’ve done.  There is nothing in this world I could ever dream to repay them with and my thanks alone is almost insulting for all they’ve done but it’s something I must do.” Harry was vehement in his words and belief.  This mattered more than anything he had ever done.  The wizarding world wanted to paint him as a hero simply for doing what he literally had to do.  Smoke had the option to do nothing.  Instead they chose to fight at great risk to themselves.  That was a hero.  That person deserved the front page.  Not him. “I’m going to send an owl off to McGonagall, I want to see her letters as soon as possible.  I also need to inform her I’m returning after all.  If Dumbledore felt Smoke was a student I might as well track that lead down first and see what it produces.”
“Mate, I don’t think she’s kidding.  I’d cover your bits if I were you.” Ron chuckled from behind the door.
With a quick swish of his hand he set the floor back to rights and scooped his son out.  After brushing his teeth and a quick story, Caelum was fast asleep in bed.  Harry quietly turned out the lights and closed the door.  He then made his way into the study to write a letter that would no doubt change Draco Malfoy’s life.  He gathered the letters that he had written over the years to the blond and placed them in a box with tonight’s letter on top.  Before he could change his mind, he sent his owl off into the night and sank down into his chair with a tumbler of Firewhiskey.
Anyway, there’s so much to tell you about him and I could go on about him for days.  The letters are just the tip of the iceberg of how amazing our son is.  He’s fiercely loyal to his loved ones. He craves learning anything and everything he can.  He comes up with the most insane plots and doesn’t think twice about following through with them.  He can manipulate a situation to suit his desires so well that you don’t even realize he’s done so until the conversation is over.  I don’t think that the hat will know what to do with him.  He’s extraordinary.
“Romantic is not a word I’d ever describe those night as.  Harry, you know we understand that you needed space and time to accept and appreciate having a life to live now.  It’ll take more than a few quiet weeks to tear us apart.” Hermione said to put his mind at ease as she hugged him back fiercely hoping she could express how very much she had missed him while he sorted out his head.
Finally, Professor McGonagall entered and began to speak.  “I have quite a bit to say so why doesn’t everyone take a seat?”  She waved her hand towards the couch and conjured herself a chair by the fire.  “I think the rumor I heard the most was that you were all to be resorted and split up.  As you can see, that isn’t true.  We felt as adults you all deserved a little more leeway than most students and felt this dorm would assist in that.  You will always be a member of your house and should pride yourselves in that but you will no longer earn or lose points for them.  You are a no longer just a Slytherin or Hufflepuff.  You are an adult and I urge you all to work together in helping me break down the walls that currently are holding all the houses apart.  Mr. Nott, when you look at Mr. Cornfoot now you simply see him as a Ravenclaw that you have shared a few classes with.  It is my hope that before long you forget the house lines and simply see him as a classmate.  Maybe someone you can study potions with or play a game of chess with.  If the school can see the 18 of you walking to classes together, laughing, talking, and letting the past remain in the past it will help us all.  You each bring something to the table someone else can learn and benefit from and vice versa you all have something to learn from everyone.”  She looked around the room and saw her message appeared to be sinking in.  It wasn’t going to be quick, but she was sure that this group of young men and women would make her proud before the school year was out.  “Now, on to the rules and class information.  Most of you were here last year so some of the knowledge is already there.  The exception to this is your Defense Against the Dark Arts class returns to replace Dark Arts.  With that in mind classes for you all are going to run quite differently.  I must first ask if any of you are wishing to attend Muggle Studies?” she inquired.  Everyone shook their heads so she carried on, “Great, you are all welcome to sit the N.E.W.T. for it if you wish but that does make scheduling much easier.  I recommend you all get a parchment and quill and copy down this schedule as it might apply to you.   Keep in mind most are giving up their free time to squeeze these lessons with your year in so please be polite and respectful by showing up on time.”  With that she waved her wand and a chart appeared in on the wall next to her with the list of classes.
They decided to call it a night around 2AM and most walked away feeling like McGonagall’s goals were more attainable than they had just few hours prior.  It would be an interesting year one way or the other, that was for sure.
Ron and Hermione both tried to dissuade him but he over ruled them by pointing out they would not be the only ones and if they didn’t want it they did not have to use it.  He continued on with his other thoughts that were vaguer that he felt he needed more direction for.  “I know that you will disagree with me Padfoot, but I know he saved my life more than once, gave up his chance at happiness and eventually his life to help defeat Voldemort.  I want to somehow honor Snape.  I’m not sure exactly how yet but I am determined that his name will live on hopefully for as long as mine will.  Which serves two purposes, it will both honor him and annoy him for the rest of eternity.”
Harry sank down on the couch next to Hermione and chuckled at the parchments littered with notes and schedules on the table in front of him.  Trust Hermione to figure out the best class load and study schedule as soon as she possibly could.  If he was the Slytherin hiding in Gryffindor, she was the Ravenclaw.  “Well, I assume you are going to hand me a parchment with a list of classes you think I should take and we going to fight over that.  After a few minutes you’ll give in and tell me I don’t take my education seriously enough and should add more classes.  You’ll be a bit cross until I smile at you and then you’ll cave with the concession that if I was only taking those few classes I had better focus and do them well.  Then I thought we’d go shopping as I could use more than the two outfits I have that fit if we are to wear them under our robes.  We could see if anyone wants to join us and maybe do dinner out or maybe hit up a club or something?”
Ancient Runes
“This is amazing.  I was sure Smoke was a hero when he saved me and didn’t understand why Dumbledore asked me to keep his role secret.  I see now how delicate and unknown the name had to be.  If even a whisper got out about someone helping our side it could have proven deadly.” Sirius acknowledged.

Draco was at a loss for words.  He looked at the bottom of the box and saw the book Harry mentioned in the first letter.  As he opened it he saw glimpses into his son’s life.  So many pictures filled the pages.  Some from the day he was born, some from birthday parties and holidays.  As the pages turned and he watched his son grow up in pictures before him.  Closer to the back there were additions of artwork and anecdotes from day to day life written among the pages.  This was his son.  He had missed out on so much and he was so angry at himself for the choices that had lead him away from the child.  He started sobbing and screaming out his anger at the universe.  After he had worn himself out and ran out of tears he realized that there was nothing to say to make it better or erase the past but there was the possibility to have a future together.
Hermione watched Draco walk over to Pansy and wondered when and how she could possibly get him alone to feel him out about her suspicions.  “Shit.  Why would they give us to us?” Hermione heard Draco exclaim.  She watched as he turned and noticed the large vial of clear liquid and quickly understood the astonishment.  That was a huge portion of Veritaserum.   She let out a low whistle.
Hermione gasped.  She had been on the edge of tears at just the thought of what Draco had been through.  She’d suffered under Bellatrix’s wand as well and knew how strong she threw that curse.  She now saw why Draco had asked for the Oath.  It had nothing to do with his potion, it had to do with protecting Neville’s privacy.  Her heart began to soften towards the boy sitting across from her.  They had all been through hell, but Bellatrix was a special kind of hell.  Who knew he had such a tender heart hidden underneath all of the hatred he had spewed in the past?
Everyone except Draco laughed at the exchange.  Thankfully no one, mind Pansy, noticed this fact.  Draco couldn’t tell if Harry was flirting with Blaise or just joking.  He knew all kinds of pointless facts about him that he could learn from afar, but he didn’t know how he interacted with his friends.  “Well then in that case, Harry, what do you suggest we do?” Draco smiled widely.  He nearly shivered at how good it felt to finally call Harry by his name outside of his thoughts.
“Harry, people are going to gawk, gossip, point, and whisper be it at Hogwarts or the Ministry. Unfortunately, you will never be able to walk down Diagon Alley without someone noticing and making a production out of what kind of underwear you picked out or why you chose fish and chips this week when you had shepherd’s pie last week and what that might mean for the rest of us. However, you cannot let that keep you from going out and living life. Hell, go out and get a brainless job in muggle London, find a club and get a little rowdy, organize the library, or plant a garden. I don’t care what you do as long as you actually do something other than stare out the window watching other people walk by living their lives. When is the last time you actually spoke to Ron or Hermione?” Sirius asked.
Tonight?  That bastard.  Draco was angry at subterfuge Blaise had employed with this invitation. No, he didn’t have plans but did Blaise think he would back out if he was given too much time to think about it?  The thought was unfair but maybe not entirely untrue.   Between that and the cloying endearments his anger at the situation was close to boiling.
“Come on, ‘Mione, we might be able to coexist for the school year without killing each other but it would take a miracle for us to suddenly trust each other.”  Harry pointed out and noticed nodding of most agreeing with him.  “My guess is they expect us to get drunk and spill our secrets to each other so we all feel vulnerable and off kilter.  Hard to hate someone when you know they’ve tossed off to Snape in a bikini.”  He winked and laughed.
There was a soft knock at the door that brought him out of his rambling thoughts.  He stood and welcomed the two into his room and placed a privacy ward around them as they took a seat.  “Thank you for coming, let me tell you a little about what I’m working on and where I’m at.  I’ve made significant progress on this but 2 months ago hit a wall on it and I’m not sure where to go from there.  I’m hoping that brining the two of you in will either help me figure out where I could have gone wrong, or maybe just bouncing ideas off of you will spark a new idea or one I’ve discarded as useless.
Pansy sat and soaked in all that had and hadn’t been said with Harry’s comments while his eyes scanned the crowd sipping at his drink.  She knew he had grown up with his Muggle relatives, but assumed he had met wizards before going to Hogwarts.  How did he have no knowledge of houses, Quidditch, or his parent’s murder? There was more to the story than what he was saying but she could wait and learn. “Well, ok then.  Shit, now I’m trying to imagine your years as a Slytherin.  Although, you might be right in the potion ingredients, because Professor Snape always did have a grudge with you.  I admit, I was quite impressed with your naming your orphanage after him.”
The night continued on.  They all took turns dancing and singing along to awful songs, drank too much, laughed too loudly, and reminisced on all the stupid and silly things they had done before.  At last call the group gathered their belongings and decided they’d gather again the weekend before the train for Hogwarts left.  Draco was pleasantly looking forward to it as he stumbled to the floo to make his way home.
Without even stepping inside Harry knew this relaxing slice of paradise was exactly where he wanted to be.  He turned to tell the others and noticed they were just as entranced as he was.  He smiled and cleared his throat.  “I have no idea what the inside looks like but I don’t find I care very much.  This is my home.”
They found themselves in front of the school with only minutes to spare before the bell rang.  Harry informed Caelum’s teacher of the possible change in pick up people and wished his son a good day.  There was nothing left to do but make his way to the Leaky and begin a talk with the blond he had never managed to forget.
“I’ll work on it and try to get it to you by next Saturday.  That gives me time to talk to the others and see who is willing to help.  Will that be soon enough?”  Harry was flattered if a bit over whelmed.  He really didn’t even know he had these ideas but they just seemed to pour out of him.  At least this gave him something to do and knowing he’d left his mark on Hogwarts beyond the crazy adventures was a welcome idea.
Draco paced his room anxiously awaiting Theo and Hermione’s arrival.  The two had told him over breakfast they’d meet him at 10 and they should be there any minute.  He sighed and took a seat as his desk to glanced at his notes on the potion so far.  Opening up to Theo was no big deal but Hermione?  That was something new.  Yes, he wanted to be himself and not the puppet his father engineered, but he had planned to ease into it and do it from the shadows.  This felt like diving into shark infested waters covered in blood.
Draco had held on to his temper but his nerves were thin.  He knew it wouldn’t be long before he lost it but he just managed not to snap back a reply to Pansy.  “No.  If we were meant to know before the feast, we would have been informed.  Let’s just pop into Malkin’s and get out of here.  You can join me at the manor for lunch.”  With that Draco pushed through the crowds and made his way into Madam Malkin’s.  They were both measured without much fuss and requested the robes be delivered by owl instead of waiting on them then began walking back to the apparition point to return to Malfoy Manor.
that it is.  Until I am sure, bringing up false hope would be cruel, and I’ve already been cruel enough for many lifetimes.  I refuse to take a chance someone could overhear me and let it be known to them.”
year students popping into their compartment to insult and sneer at them but they found it easy to brush off since it wasn’t unexpected.  Draco hadn’t agreed with Pansy’s plan to “bag a Potter” but that hadn’t stopped her wild planning either.  He had no intentions of going along with her.  Harry deserved more than what Draco had to offer and as far as he was aware Harry was still with Ginny Weasely.  Pansy pushed to tell Blaise and while Draco didn’t disagree there hadn’t yet been an opportunity to do so.  Perhaps after they were settled this evening in a corner of the common room behind heavy privacy spells.
Theo was hooked.  He had no idea what or who Draco could be referring to but knowing what he had already accomplished he knew that Draco had the ability to achieve the impossible.  He would offer any assistance he could without knowing anything more simply to acquire the knowledge.   Hermione was also excited about learning more from Draco’s experiments but couldn’t fail to notice the determination in his eyes as he spoke of this potion.  She couldn’t wait to find out what he was working on and who it could benefit.
“Pretty good, actually.  I will be honest and say I had my doubts but so far there’s been no problems.  I don’t know if it has to do more with our ages or the fact that we’re all so tired of fighting others and amongst ourselves, but so far so good.  Your contributions didn’t hurt anything either.” He answered with a smile.
The incoming first years were sorted and the feast began.  She looked over the tables and her heart ached at the empty spaces that had in the past held students that were lost in battles and raids along the way. The house system was broken in her view.  She saw the need for it and didn’t want to abolish it by any means, but there needed to be something to break up the exclusion that each house had to the other.  She was hopeful that her plans with the 8
“Oh, just in the neighborhood and thought I’d swing by and see what you were up to. It’s been so long since I’ve seen you so I figured I’d check in.” Blaise smirked and winked at Draco.
“Keep in mind that Smoke may not want to be found and may make themselves that much harder to find.” Hermione pointed out.  She had a suspicion who Smoke could be but wasn’t going to say anything to the others.  Harry was too obsessive and would approach him without thinking it through.  Ron would blow up and refuse to help because he didn’t do it to help anyone but himself as he is a worthless prat.  She wasn’t sure what Sirius’s reaction would be.  The man owed his life to Smoke but there was a lot of history there too.  She thought it best to simply quietly investigate herself and let the others know when she had enough proof to rule him out or prove his identity.
He heard the disbelief and scoffing from the crowd that had grown since he began.  He pushed down the nerves he had begun to feel and pressed on.  “You don’t believe me?  Voldemort started out his war to protect pureblood ways and stop the muggleborns from switching our traditions into theirs.  Before even the first war with him was over that agenda degraded into killing all muggles and muggleborn.  With the second it was anyone who disagreed with him or that he saw standing in his way.  Pureblood, half-blood, it didn’t matter.
“Poppy never questioned or pressed, then or now.  Even when Caelum got sick before and she wasn’t sure if it was a hereditary issue or not, she just said she had ‘checked all relevant medical information available and it did not appear to be an issue from either parent’.  It’s kind of became one of those things that those close to me know, but no one really talks about or asks any questions.”
Draco nodded his acceptance as he stood and replaced his coat.  They exited the tavern ignoring the whispers and stares directed at them and quickly found themselves standing in Diagon Alley’s apparition area.  The walk took no more than a minute but the tension for the upcoming conversation was so heavy on them both that it seemed to take much longer.
Harry decided to go for a walk after breakfast.  There was so much to decide that he felt he was drowning in all these choices.  He knew living with Sirius and Teddy was working for now, but long term it wouldn’t.  He loved Teddy with all his heart but he had just turned 18 years old himself.  He wanted to be the fun uncle that you visit, not the other parent you live with.  Besides that, he felt Sirius deserved the chance to raise at least one of his godsons.  He took the loss of Remus hard and it nearly killed him when Andromeda said she could raise him alone.  Thankfully they worked it out where everyone was happy.  Andromeda agreed to remain in her role as grandmother and got Teddy on the weekends and occasionally took him for several days at a time through the week to give Sirius a break.  If he was going to get serious about living his life wouldn’t he need someone to share it with?  Did he really want to attempt to start a relationship with someone only to bring them home to a crying child and the questions that would entail?  What if things got heated?   Would definitely kill the mood if mid snog your godfather walked in or worse a big black dog jumped on your lap to halt progression.
Pansy was floored.  She didn’t know what she expected to hear but this wasn’t even on the peripheral of her thoughts.  “I don’t even know where to begin, Draco.  Merlin, you went through all that alone?!  Why didn’t you tell us?  You know we would have helped you any way we could.” Pansy cried.  Her heart was breaking for her best friend.
years stay behind as I need to escort you to your new dorms and explain a few things to you.  The rest of you are dismissed.”
Harry could see Hermione’s eye twitching so he politely greeted then dismissed the elves.  It would be much easier to sort out who did what without Hermione around to make him feel as if he was taking advantage of them.  “Well, I vote we explore at least the ground floor at least and then head back to Grimmauld before we dig into this box.”  He walked further into the entry way and was blown away all over again.  There was a double staircase leading up to the next floor.  The floors continued the marble throughout the ground floor at least but he felt confident it would be a feature that was carried on all over the house. He walked back towards the pool area and noticed the entire back wall of the house was made of sliding glass doors that disappeared as he slid them back to open the house into the deck.  The décor could use replacing.  It might have been Dumbledore’s Gryffindor pride or it might be the inspired by the name but the gold and scarlet that covered nearly every surface was just a bit much for Harry’s taste.
“So, today’s Prophet says Draco Malfoy is back in town this week.  His band apparently is extremely popular, and they are on a world tour.  Doing a few shows in London.”
Pansy liked this side of Harry.  She’d always seen him as too straight laced and uptight.  Maybe there was more hope to the hopeless situation than she knew.  She glanced over and made eye contact with Draco.  He was not a fan of this conversation in the least.  Most of the others wouldn’t notice his tightly clenched jaw or angry glare. “Potter, good to know I’m not alone in my wicked ways.”  She took a shot and decided a change of topic would be the best route to go before Draco gave himself away.  Hopefully the next selection would be harmless.  “Millie, why don’t you pick next?”
Draco was slightly uncomfortable.  He wasn’t ashamed of his work in any sense, but he knew it would remain as nothing more than experiments for him.  He’d never be known as anything more than a Deatheater and Lucius Malfoy’s son.  “I’ve been tinkering with many potions over the years but this one since 6
“Well, I’m not saying it’d be easy, but I refuse to let you not even try.  There has to be a reason the two of you were always circling each other and why he spoke up for you at your trial.  Rumor has it he’s returning next week too so we’ve at least got until June to see what we’re working with and give it a shot.  What’s the worst that could happen?”
“As you also no doubt noticed there is a kitchen to the rear of the room.  You are all welcome to make use of this at any time but please be courteous to others with its use.  I understand that a few of you are superb cooks and I personally know one of you is a most accomplished baker.” She winked at Harry.  He spent much of his time at Grimmauld baking to keep his mind off things.  Her personal favorite was his lemon bars and she hoped he made a batch soon.  “You are welcome to eat here as much as you would like and can request food from the house elves as well.  I do ask that at least a few of you attend dinner with us in the Great Hall through the week as that is when any announcements will be made and report them back to your classmates if so.  The fireplace behind me is set up with a partial connection to the floo network.  You can floo out but not in and it cannot accept or make fire calls.  Your curfew is 11PM.  You are all adults and therefore can come and go from the grounds as you please.  If you will return late and risk missing your curfew I urge you to seek a room in Hogsmeade as breaking rules with as much freedom as you’ve all been given will require strict punishments.  Alcohol is allowed to be consumed within this dormitory only.  You are not to be found wondering the halls hungover or participating in drunken activities.  Stock up on hangover potions and practice your sobering charms, ladies and gentlemen.”
“I’m an acquired taste I’ll admit, but I know what I’m talking about.  So, what do you say we get to know each other?  Tell me something no one else knows about you and I’ll do the same.  Anything at all, large or small.  Fuck it, I’ll even go first.  My favorite color happens to be Gryffindor red.  I’ve got everyone convinced it’s actually cornflower blue.”
“Don’t think I didn’t notice your avoidance.  It can’t be that bad Draco.  Being in pain daily for pure stubbornness is madness.  Tell me who it is so we can plan how to make this happen.”  When Pansy paused Draco stood and walked to the large window that over looked the gardens.  She couldn’t remember when she had last seen him look so pensive.  She couldn’t understand why he was avoiding the question.  She had never spoken a word of gossip about him and had actually stopped it more often than not.  He was acting as if it was some major secret he had to protect.  There was no one that could be that big of a deal.  Whoever it was between her, Blaise, and a well behaved Draco they could repair any reputation or relationship.  Well, maybe except Potter.  That would be tragic and damn near impossible to fix.  Her eyes widened “Sytherin’s hairy nutsack, it’s Potter.”
Hermione threw back another of her shots and laughed.  “Oh, if you only knew how many times I’ve found Harry wrapped around someone on Prefect rounds.  We’ve all caught him at some point or heard him complain about me giving him a detention after catching him after curfew on his lustful expeditions.”
Ron sat in front of Harry with his mouth gaping open.   He appeared to be more shocked than Harry had been the previous day.   Hermione just had the intense look of concentration on her face she got when she was studying for exams.  Harry just hoped after laying it all on the line for the both of them maybe they could help him figure out what to do.
It was around the middle of August when I passed out the first time.  I didn’t think anything of it but told myself I’d eat more.  A few weeks later and I passed out again, but Kreacher couldn’t wake me.  He went to get Hermione and Ron, but by the time they had returned I was coming to.  After a huge lecture from her about healthy eating habits and how I needed to get out and focus on the future and not the past we sat down and had a huge heart to heart.  I told them about you.  I told them about the guilt and the nightmares.  I finally told them about the Dursley’s.   I pretty much told them everything…..”  Here Harry let the conversation drift off for a few seconds as he got lost in the past.
He had started thinking about this potion after meeting his insane Aunt Bellatrix and hearing her brag about her past deeds while threating him within an inch of his life for imagined misdeeds and slights against her precious Dark Lord.  He knew that Neville had been raised by his Grandmother, but did not know or care why at the time.  It was a startling discovery.  By the time he had learned about her actions he had already began to doubt in the ideology he had shoved down his throat since he learned to walk.  His father had tarnished the Malfoy name with the first war, but he had ruined it with the second.  He never imagined his family on both sides would be so vile and repugnant.
“Thank you.  Um…well,” He cleared his throat and continued after gathering his thoughts, “a lot of my research so far is pure conjecture since I do not have access to any medical records or previous tests so, please, feel free to disagree with me and offer you opinions.  From my research into what continual use of the curse would do to the neurological pathways I’ve determined that the framework is still there, just extremely damaged and dismissed as impossible to fix by all.  It could be, but I think it’s highly probable to repair with a combined effort of spell work and potion.
“Indeed, I do, but how could I pass up the opportunity to attempt to knock some sense into you?” Sirius winked and took a seat at the table with them.  “So, did I miss anything?  Hermione figured out his puzzle yet?”
Harry caught the snitch that had been hovering nearby during their conversation like it was annoyed it was being ignored then made his way to his room.  He grabbed a change of clothes and took a quick shower then made his way towards the Headmistress’s office with a minute to spare before realizing he hadn’t gotten the password.  He stood there for a minute before telling the guardian he was here for an appointment with the professor.  Thankfully, the sculpture began to move to allow him to make his way up the stairs.
The edges of Harry’s lips began a small curve upwards.  He threw up a powerful Notice-Me-Not charm and several privacy wards to prevent anyone who happened to venture out during classes from seeing or hearing them.  “Hogwarts likes me.”  He shrugged and took a seat.  After noticing Draco’s glare from his avoidance, he continued, “Caelum got really sick when he was 2 and no one answered the floo in the infirmary or Minerva’s office.  I have never taken him to St. Mungo’s because I don’t trust someone not to leak information to the Prophet for a pocket full of galleons.  I knew Poppy was my only option, so I grabbed him and intended to apparate to the gates and head in but was surprised to find myself standing in the middle of the infirmary instead.  After making sure Caelum was alright Minerva checked the wards and found an exception for me weaved in by Hogwarts.  It can’t be overridden or removed by the Headmistress or anyone else who has tried.  It’s all a bunch of conjecture but the best we can figure is that Hogwarts felt I protected it and allows me privileges and freedoms because of that.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~HPDM~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It was agreed they’d all meet back at Grimmauld tomorrow morning after packing a few things.  They could relax and explore all Phoenix Perch had to offer and most importantly rest and just enjoy being together as they never really had been able to before.  Harry hugged his friends tightly and walked them to the floo before heading upstairs to write the letter requesting the last of Smoke’s missives.
Minerva had hoped more from this year would return but was happy that all the houses were represented.  “Good evening.  I have several things to discuss with you all but we will do it from your new common room instead of here in the Great Hall.  If you will follow me I will lead you there.”  Minerva began leading them and explaining how in the remodel they had built a new dorm that overlooked the courtyard for prefects and remodeled two of the rooms set aside for visiting professors and family members for the purpose of housing the Head Boy and Head Girl.  They decided to use the prefect’s area this year as housing for the 8
Draco wasn’t fairing as well across the hallway.  Unlike Harry, he didn’t have a Hermione to anticipate his agony this morning and had forgotten to grab a potion on his way up last night.  Nevertheless, he was feeling pretty good all things considered.  He gingerly rolled out of bed and dug in his trunk for one of his own pain relief potions.  As he swallowed it he reflected on everything that had been revealed at the feast and after last night.  To say he felt relief was an understatement.  He had no doubt someone would attempt to curse him sooner rather than later, but after hearing about the ward and the sincerity in McGonagall’s voice as she spoke he was confident it wouldn’t be tolerated.
Harry shook his head as he finished his 3
“Good morning. Hope bacon and eggs are fine with you again. Neither of us has been to the store in a few days.” Harry remarked as Sirius entered the kitchen.
Please make good use of your free periods to study and complete homework.  If you are caught up on both, might I recommend asking your professors if there is a younger year that could use a tutor or other assistance.  Today is Wednesday and while the rest of the students will start classes tomorrow morning you all will not start classes until Monday.  This is to give you each time to get to know each other and settle in.  You will be spending the majority of your time with each other so use this time to iron out the rough spots.”
No matter, he took to the skies, let his worries slide off his mind, and lost himself in the wind.  He never felt as free as he did in the air.  He spent the next couple of hours catching and releasing the snitch without noticing anything about his surroundings other than the little golden ball.  As he pulled up from a close Wronski Feint applause shocked him out of his obliviousness and he noticed the stands had filled with about 40 people watching him.  He had no clue how long they had been there or what even how long he’d been outside himself.  He noticed his former head of house in the stands as well and made his way over to her.
Draco sat nodding in agreement.  “I can understand your reasoning and while I had hoped we could try now, I respect your choice.  I’m not going anywhere, and I can wait as long as you need for you to feel comfortable with it all.
He made his way into Caelum’s room to wake him and got him set up at the table with a bowl of cereal and some juice.  He then pulled out this mobile and sent off a text asking Hermione if she or Ron could be on call to pick up Caelum.  He didn’t know how long the talk with Draco would take or how it would go so a backup plan was the safe choice.  Then he checked in with Fred to make sure George was feeling better today and let them know he wouldn’t be in today.
“Morning Hermione, what are you up to?” Hermione looked up and smiled at Neville as he sat across from her on the couch.
“What’s in the box, Pans?” Blaise asked.
As the first term went on they both realized how broken the other one was and took comfort in each other.  First it was simply helping each other through the nightmares and being on hand to talk about them if either wanted to.  Before long they noticed they both slept better if they slept in the same bed.  That inevitably led to cuddling, which lead to what Draco liked to call “Harry Potter’s Great Sexual Awakening”.  They agreed to keep it casual and secret.  There was no need for whatever they were doing to be known by anyone.  The papers would have had a field day crucifying Draco and doubting Harry’s sanity all over again.
“Bollocks. I hadn’t thought of that.”  Harry blushed and muttered an apology at a stern look from the Headmistress.  “I don’t think I want to do an entire day of teaching to be honest with you.  What other options do we have?”  After wiggling a few classes around and lining up his schedule with the first year’s available free periods, they came to an agreement that would work for all of them.  Soon the dishes were cleared, the paperwork was signed, and Professor Potter made his way back to his dorm with a smile on his face and another decision made.
As she walked around the store pondering all of this she spotted what she had been told was called a mannequin sporting a pair of leather pants she knew would look amazing on Potter and smiled mischievously.  “Potter, I’ll make you a deal.  I pick out one more outfit for you and you wear it tonight and I’ll get you out of this place as soon as the sale is final.”  She had spotted a shirt earlier that would look marvelous with the skin-tight pants.  Draco would kill her she was sure, but it’d be worth it to see his face and Potter’s reaction when he saw just want she had picked out.
years only.  No one except yourself and staff may enter these rooms as it will be keyed to your magical signature.  I am going to open the door and as you pass through I will cast a spell towards you and the doorway to allow you entry.  After the spell is cast please continue on into the common room where the rest of us will meet you shortly.”
“Thank you, Nippy. Please tell her I will be there shortly.” Draco wondered how long it would take for his mother to bring up her desire for him to return to Hogwarts this time. She had been after him at least once a day since McGonagall announced the castle would reopen as normal in September and welcome back all students just as they always had. Draco walked towards the conservatory stopping off along the way in his potions lab to check on a particularly troublesome potion he was working on.
As he watched his son splash and play in the bath his thoughts landed on Draco.  His thoughts often wondered to the man so that was nothing new, but the fear and worry were.  He had no clue what Draco’s reaction would be or if he’d even want a relationship with the boy who was currently covering the floor with bubbles and water.
*End Flashback*
“No, but I do have a few suggestions.  He said to search the ashes, correct?  Well, he could mean a few things by that.  However, with what you were given and the wording I think our best bet is to search Phoenix Perch and hope it’s not a scavenger hunt from there.” Hermione replied.
“I don’t know that we were ready for it before.  I have always noticed how separate we are and the lack of any available options to overcome that.  The Room of Requirement could only host one group at a time.  The library is large enough, but you can’t let loose and get loud.  The weather isn’t always good enough to make the lakeside a viable option.  The great hall is big enough, but doesn’t offer privacy or places to lounge and stretch out.”  Here he shrugged.  “The way it has been isn’t bad.  It’s just that now there is the option of another way that could work just as well or better. It can’t hurt to try. I also have one other idea if you are up to hearing it?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~HPDM~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco let out a sigh of relief.  He was terrified Harry would have changed his mind after hearing all that he’d revealed today.  “Perfect.  Should I bring anything for dinner?”
“Darling, don’t be that way. Blaise just stopped by to talk to you as I called Nippy to summon you so he decided to wait here for you instead of tracking you down in the manor.” Narcissa beamed back at him. Draco highly doubted this as all Blaise had to do was call for an elf and ask where Draco was but he decided he’d not explicitly call his mother out over it.
Sirius was thrilled Harry had finally started to make choices.  “Sounds great, Harry.  I’m proud of you.” He stood and hugged Harry tight.  “I’m going to pop over and pick up Teddy from Andromeda’s.  She mentioned dinner earlier so I might not be back for a while.”  He said his goodbyes to Hermione and Ron and went to the floo.  He was so proud of the man Harry was becoming and so grateful that he had the chance to see it.  Prongs, Lilyflower, and Moony would be too he knew.  He still felt the loss of his closest friends deep in his soul and knew he always would.  He’d do the best he could to honor them by helping their cubs and guiding their way.
“Oh Merlin, remember when you caught him with that Slytherin bloke in 5
“Wow.  Um…It’s a great offer.  I’m not really worried about the money but I guess it’d be harder to complain about grading homework and dealing with troublesome students if I was getting paid for it.”
“Just Harry, please.  Thank you for holding on to this for me.  No, right now I think we are just going to roam a bit.  We won’t be staying long today but I will be moving in soon.  May I ask your name, please?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~HPDM~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I’ll have to finish up this last leg of the tour, but that’s only another 5 or 6 shows.  Our contract with the record company is fulfilled at the end of it.  They tried to get us to sign a new one right before we left, but thankfully the guys had my back and we decided to wait until afterwards to decide what to do.”
“Phoenix Perch currently has 35 house elves, sir.” Dolly replied.
With that the image flickered out.  Harry sat so still he appeared to be in a full body bind.  His mind though, was racing.  Another mission?  Ashes?  Smoke?  What the hell was the old man talking about?  Obviously, Dumbledore knew the Ministry would meddle but did he have to continue to speak in riddles?  How much did Dumbledore leave him?  He had no need of money as his parents had already made him one of the richest wizards alive.  Harry wanted to laugh and cry at the same time.  Well, he was looking for something to give him a drive and meaning just a few short hours ago.  The saying about being careful what you wish for was never truer.
“Well, I guess the easiest place to start would be the beginning.  I went into eighth year with no plans on what to do after graduation, as you know.  After you left I really was just more confused as to who I was and what I wanted.  I sat around Grimmauld for longer than I care to admit without leaving and only seeing Hermione or Ron when they’d pop in.  I hadn’t been feeling well for a couple of months but didn’t think much of it.  I hadn’t been sleeping or eating well and between that and the depression I had still yet to overcome, I wrote it off as nothing when I could even be bothered to worry about myself.

Millicent was happy blending in to the background.  She didn’t dislike being around others, but she didn’t like being noticed or having attention brought to her.  She was able to learn many things this way as most disregarded her presence.  She felt all the eyes in the room turn to her waiting for her to pick the next slip of parchment and it made her skin crawl.  She took a deep breath to calm herself and pushed through the unease.  She had decided this year was going to be different.  She wanted the close and easy friendships she had seen so many of her classmates make.  She no longer wanted to be the girl everyone forgot was around.  She pasted a smile on her face and reached to the pile.  “Most likely to blow up the potions lab.”  There.  She did it.  Salazar’s balls, she did it.  Such a small victory filled her with so much pride as she told herself that she’d continue with the small victories until she was sure she’d overcome the larger ones.
“I’ll look into it the next time I head into Diagon Alley. Onto real issues, have you thought any more about what you want to do now? You know you are welcome here as long as you want but you’re young and I think you need to finally take advantage of the fact that you can leave the house without being afraid someone is around the corner waiting to kill you. It doesn’t have to be Hogwarts and it doesn’t have to be the Ministry but you need some kind of plan.”
The next chapter will have us finally on the way to Hogwarts!  Thank you all for the kind comments and the kudos.  I hope you all continue to enjoy.
year.  Severus helped me with the early stages of it and the first several batches of failure.  I succeeded in this one on Monday.”
With that thought in mind he wiped his face off and summoned parchment and a quill to pen his reply.  He told Harry he’d meet him at the Leaky at 8:30 and they could decide where to go to talk from there.  He called for an elf to take the letter to the owlery and spent the rest of the night rereading the letters and going through the scrapbook countless times.
Harry pulled the parchment from his pocket and the two of them took a seat at the kitchen table.  There were several properties listed along with apparition coordinates and brief descriptions about them.  The first portion of the list was what he had inherited from his mother and father, Potter Manor and the house in Godric’s Hollow.  Neither were unexpected.  The two of them discussed these options but quickly disqualified them.  Potter Manor was too big for one teenager to live in full time.  Sirius mentioned a quidditch pitch it boasted and Harry was sure to make use of it, but had no need for a manor at this point in his life.  They did decide to check in on it in over the weekend while Teddy was with Andromeda.  If the house elves hadn’t abandoned the property after so long without a Master present Harry decided to see if one or two would like to come serve Sirius at Grimmauld.

“Draco. Did you know he was the first wizard my age I’d ever met?” At Pansy’s shake of her head he continued, “I walked into Madam Malkin’s for my school robes and was instructed to stand next to him for measuring.  Godric, but he was a little shit even then.  I didn’t say much to him beyond a few words as he looked down his nose at my lack of knowledge of anything.  I didn’t even know what houses or Quidditch were.  Eh, looking back it seems pretty inconsequential and I can see how he was simply imitating what he had grown up seeing, but as a kid who had always been bullied and treated poorly, it wasn’t a good first impression.  Add in to that Hagrid telling me about Voldemort and he had murdered my parents and then Draco’s dismissal of Ron as unimportant and beneath him on the train and I refused to be in a house with him.”
After Seamus made his toast to the group and drifted off to dance, Harry had made his way to the bar.  He had just ordered a drink when Pansy sat down on the stool next to where he was leaning.  He began to glare at her before laughing out loud at her ridiculous attempt at a pout.  “Merlin’s tits Pansy, you might at least try to look remorseful.  These damn things are so tight I can’t even sit down properly! If I get a hard-on the front page of the paper tomorrow isn’t going to be about Neville’s speech, but give intimate details of my cock!”
Just a few minutes later found the odd mishmash of students making their way down Diagon Alley towards The Dragon’s Lair.  It was late enough that most of the families no longer crowded the streets, but there were enough people out to turn some heads at the group.  Neville heard the not so quiet whispers and saw the hateful glances directed towards the Slytherins and began to become incensed.  He had been seen as the useless outcast by almost everyone he had met his entire life until he beheaded the snake.  Never good enough.  Not worth the magic that ran through his body.  Just an idiot with a useless stick in his hands. Even his own family didn’t believe in him.  It wasn’t until his friends, though few, stood up for him and gave him faith in himself that he began to shine.  He refused to stand by and allow hate and bigotry to fester after everything they had all be through.
“Just in time, Mr. Potter.  Please have a seat, while we wait on our lunch, I thought we could catch up.  How are things going with your peers?”
“Maybe, I’m not sure.  If not, we can always head over this weekend.” With breakfast finished he sent his son upstairs to get dressed.  While Caelum brushed his teeth, Harry hopped in the shower quickly to wash off the stench of a night of too much alcohol and regret.
With that, I will leave you. As with classes you are not required to join us for meals in the Great Hall until Monday, although you are welcome to do so if you wish.  I bid you good night and point your attention to the box on the kitchen counter.  I think you’ll find the contents interesting.”  With that she turned and left the room.  It had been a long day and she was ready for a glass or two of scotch before turning in for the night.
“Would you be likely to run through the Great Hall starkers, Potter?” Pansy smiled in question while they moved the glasses and Firewhiskey to the table in the middle of the couch.
By the time they graduated they had discussed the possibility of coming out and trying to make it work, but the public still hated Draco and felt he should be in prison with his father.  After many fights and sleepless nights, Draco made the decision to leave the wizarding world all together.  He never told Harry how he felt about him or asked Harry how he felt.  It would hurt too much to acknowledge it and walk away.
Harry raised his arm and looked upon the face of the man who had at one time been all he had ever wanted.  He closed his eyes when Draco placed his hand on his forearm and collected himself before they were whisked away in apparition.
“No, not really.  My initial goal was to change how it works to remove the compulsion, but it proved impossible to do so.  Instead I worked out a completely new potion that, like
He was torn, while he had just told himself he needed someone else’s thoughts on his other project, he hardly knew Hermione.  Plus, his reasons for even coming up with the idea for the potion weren’t something he wanted examined too deeply.  On the other hand, letting that hold him back if Hermione or Theo could help spark an idea was selfish and unthinkable.  It was a risk for sure, but one he had to take if he wanted to help others like he had sought out to do.  “Theo knows I’ve worked on fixing flaws and side effects of other potions but there is one potion I’ve been working on that I’ve hit a wall on.  I would love to talk to both of you about it and see if you can offer any ideas up.  I’ve been working on the idea for it since 5
He paused hoping what he was saying was sinking in to at least a few people.  “In just this group standing with me, we have lost mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, godparents, and friends to death or madness.  That’s on both sides of a war none of us asked for.  We weren’t even born when it started, yet we were all forced to choose a side and fight for our lives.  Some of us had no choice to run and hide away until it was over like most of the wizarding world chose to do.  I think I can speak for us all here when I say I refuse to fight any longer.  No more battles.  No more hate.  Move forward and live the life you are beyond blessed to have because there are so many worthy people that no longer have the opportunity to do so.”  Neville then cancelled the
“I don’t really know.  Yes, the voice was distinctly male and could have been charmed that way, I don’t think it was.  It just sounded muffled and garbled more so than complete fabrication.  Plus, their behavior and mannerisms just seemed more male to me.” Sirius shrugged “I could be completely off base like Dumbledore suspects, but I really don’t think I am.”
Harry chuckled but had to agree.  Surely it wasn’t that surprising after as many items as the purebloods had snagged.  “And while we can happily point you in that direction, it is not on the agenda for the day.”  He was exhausted.  He only had plans to grab a few casual outfits to wear under his school robes and maybe one or two dressier shirts he could pair with a nice pair of trousers.  However, once the Slytherins started shopping, they were impossible to stop it seemed.  Harry now had 4 bags of clothes for school, 2 bags of button up shirts and expensive trousers he was sure he’d never really need to wear, and another 3 bags he wasn’t even sure what they contained.  He was done and said as much to the group.
I found a spell in an old family grimoire that layered on top of the potion could help as well.  It is supposed to remove ill effects of misdeeds but is rather open to interpretation.  It was widely used from minor effects to major effects.  The problem is that it requires multiple casters to fill roles.  One caster must have a personal connection to the victim, one to the original caster who did the harm, and then two grounding casters.  It appears to be an easy spell to learn and cast, but requires a lot of power and the intent must be pure.  It has failed in the past according to the notes due to unequal cooperation and the links not being close enough.  We’d have to have Lady Longbottom or Neville himself help.  Neville would be closer, but if it failed, it would be unusually cruel.  Myself or my mother would work for the connection to Bellatrix, or if she was uncomfortable with either of us, she could ask my Aunt Andromeda.  I’ve never met her, but I can’t imagine her refusing.
Theo blushed as he rose to offer his hand to Hermione.  “He’s a liar.  I am a superb dancer.  I can’t help it if no one else can understand my moves.” He joked with her as they walked away and shot Draco a grateful glance.  “Don’t get too tipsy, Malfoy.  I’m too intrigued by whatever your brain has cooked up to let you sleep in too late tomorrow.”
“10 points from Ravenclaw, Miss Fawcett.  I will not let hatred and anger fester in my school.”  Headmistress McGonagall said as she passed on her way to the head table.  Albus might have ignored the way the Slytherins were treated in the past but she refused to do so.  There were many reasons so many had joined the ranks of the Death Eaters over the years but his refusal to stop the blatant favoring of other houses didn’t help.  She turned and acknowledged the surprised faces of the Slytherins.  “Glad to see you all made it back.  Settle in, sorting should start soon.”  With that she made her way to the head table and took her seat.  She had a long road ahead of her to change the deep seated views but she was determined to try.
With a sigh and a thought of how quickly time was passing, Harry started walking towards Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.  Most mornings found him there since Caelum had started school.  Occasionally he could be seen ringing up customers but most of the time he was either restocking shelves or in the back with the twins digging through journals the Marauder's had left behind.  They had developed a whole new line that was flying off the shelves from the ideas that were on those pages.  Marauder’s Madness was on pace to outsell the Wonder Witch line by the end of the year.
The Headmistress just quirked her lips and shook her head at messy haired boy.  “How kind of you, Mr. Potter.  I came not to critique your flying style but to invite you to join me for a quick tea.  Are you finished with your solo seeker’s match?”
“Makes sense, would you like to meet in one of our rooms tomorrow or would you prefer to do it somewhere else?”
“A gentleman never tells.”  Seamus said solemnly.  Then he smiled and began, “And since we all know I’m the furthest thing from a gentleman there is-” here he was cut off by a sharp elbow to the ribs from Dean.  “Fine, be that way.  At least no one is sitting around weeping into their whiskey anymore.  Now let’s go dance, lover.”  He stood and pulled Dean from the couch and they made their way towards the dancefloor and were soon joined by several others.
Here Harry paused.  He had a few thoughts last night but didn’t want to offend either of his friends but he gathered his courage and began to inform them of some of his half-formed ideas.  “Well, please don’t take this the wrong way but I have no need of the money.  What Mum and Dad left me is more than I could ever spend in my lifetime by itself.  Dumbledore told me I could do whatever I wanted with it.  I’d like to set up a few vaults for the both of you and a few others.  Sirius, I know you have as much need for the gold as I do or I’d include you as well.  We all fought and gave up so much and while I know that gold isn’t a replacement for lost loved ones I want to at least remove some worry from those I love.  I feel confident that he would approve and bet he even knew this is one thing I’d choose to do with it.”
“I am Dolly, sir.  I am Head Elf.  This is Suzy, Elle, Hetty, and Sammy.”  Dolly informed him pointing at the other four elves.  “We are Master’s personal elves.  If Master Harry wishes Dolly can call in the kitchen, grounds, and household elves for Master to meet as well.”
Draco opened his eyes after landing and huffed out a laugh.   They stood in the stands of the Quidditch pitch at Hogwarts.  “While it’s obvious I’ve missed a lot of news and gossip over the years, I’m pretty sure McGonagall is still Headmistress so how in the world did you get through the wards with apparition?”  It wasn’t the first question Draco thought he’d ask Harry nor was it the most important, but it was at least a way to start a conversation.
“When did you plan on doing that?  I don’t want to rush you or him, but I am dying to meet him.”  Draco, who had always been one to veer towards the dramatic, wasn’t even kidding.  His thoughts since last night centered solely on that beautiful little boy and his incredible father.
“How many elves does this property have?” Sirius asked.
He wasn’t exactly ignoring the jeers and hateful glances, but he wasn’t acknowledging them either.   If the past few years had given him anything it gave him a thick skin and an unwillingness to back down when faced with unpleasantness.  He watched the people passing while sipping his tea.  Most were content to ignore him just as he was to ignore them.
floor. I have few new professors to introduce to you before I dismiss you.  Please join me in welcoming Professor Charlie Weasely as our new Head of Gryffindor and Care of Magical Creatures professor.”  She paused to join the applause.  Hagrid would remain as keeper of grounds and keys but she could no longer allow him to teach students.  His class sizes continued to shrink and while a few students sat for their N.E.W.T. none continued past his O.W.L. classes.  Charlie had been looking for something to keep him closer to home and she couldn’t think of a better Head of House to replace her.  He was young enough to relate to them and hopefully help them heal.  “Also joining us this year to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts is Professor Allison Smith.” She again paused for the applause.  Allison was a former Auror from the States. She would be fair to all houses as a fresh pair of eyes.  “And finally, filling our Transfiguration opening, Professor Gemma Farley.”  Gemma was a Slytherin and former prefect who excelled in her teaching.  “While Professor Slughorn will remain as our potions professor he is stepping down as Slytherin Head of House and Professor Farley will be taking over for him.”  The applause and shouts of cheer from the Slytherin table was nearly deafening.  Most of the students remembered Gemma and how fair and caring she had been as a prefect.  When she approached Horace with the idea of him stepping down he grabbed on to the idea like it was a tin of his cherished crystallized pineapple.  He wanted to retire completely but she somehow managed to convince him to stay another year or two while she looked for a replacement.
birthday when his world changed.  It was a sobering realization that he’d have to ponder on later.  He sat and let the conversation with Theo flow.  The two had once been extremely close and had experimented together a time or two before Theo began to develop feelings that Draco did not return.  To keep it from getting messy and ruining a great friendship the two ceased their actions.  The two of them didn’t meet until Hogwarts but quickly became close.  Both shared a love of learning and could spend hours discussing magical theory and history.  Sliding back into that comforting friendship was like a balm to Draco’s soul he didn’t realize he needed.  No matter how badly the night went he wouldn’t regret coming out simply for this alone.
shot, “Bisexual.  No, he was angry because I ‘let a snake defile me’ or some such bullshit.  I don’t think he’ll ever see past house lines.”  He sighed and continued “Little did he know I brought that snake up to the dorm a time or two under my cloak right under his nose.”
“Yes, Draco, we discussed this less than an hour ago.  Clothes here don’t have to be custom made unless you want to spend the extra money for a personal tailor.  Mass production keeps costs low.  Remember?”  Hermione grumbled.  She muttered under her breath something about how she was beginning to doubt the house of the snakes held any intelligence.  She wasn’t sure how a quick shopping trip to grab Harry a few outfits had turned into such a huge excursion.  She thought she’d be the one dragging him into more than one store, so he at least had a variety of styles and options.  Instead, the Slytherins had fallen in love with simple muggle clothing stores.  So far, they had been to 4 different stores and were currently in a huge shopping mall in London.
“Tell me what happened, Draco.”  She figured the direct approach would work the best for what was sure to be a heavy conversation.  She debated calling a house elf in to request some Firewhiskey but decided to let Draco determine if this conversation called for it or not.
The game continued for the next hour and a half with all kinds of stories being told and secrets being revealed.  It was discovered that if you wanted a secret kept, you could tell Hermione.  If you wanted it to get out and hear it as gossip the next day, you’d want to tell Blaise.  Draco and Hermione split the votes for most likely to go into politics.  Harry had every finger pointed his way for most likely to break a rule and found himself pleasantly tipsy rather quickly.
Draco sighed. It was a very tempting offer. He was feeling a bit stifled after nearly 3 months without leaving the grounds. He did miss a few of his friends and it would be interesting to see how his reentry into the group would go. Plus, if it did all go tits up he had his mother’s word she’d stop the incessant pleading. “Very well. I’ll go to Pansy’s party. I will hold you to your promise though, Mother.”
Draco had no idea what the letters contained or why Harry was so confident he’d want to meet to ask questions, but he opened the box without another thought and began reading a stack of letters that would change his life forever.
“You had a lot thrown at you yesterday, Harry.  I’ve no doubt you would have thought of it yourself as soon as you calmed down from the surprise on your own.”  Hermione stated believingly.  “What are your ideas to do with what he left you?”
“Actually, Hermione was just telling me about the bookstore on the lower level and I’d like to check it out.  I’ll meet you all back there later.”  Theo turned to go but paused before walking away.  He had spent morning annoyed at the fashion hounds he called his friends until Hermione noticed him withdrawing and engaged him in an in-depth conversation about muggle vs wizarding shopping districts.  At first, he thought she was trying to look down her nose at his ignorance of muggle ways but soon realized she, like him, simply loved gaining any knowledge about anything.  Mundane or not.  Here they were nearly 4 hours later and were debating the intricacies of how to adapt a Gringotts account to connect to the cards the muggles were using in place of a physical money exchange.  “Unless you wouldn’t mind joining me, Hermione?  I’d love to get your suggestions and opinions if you don’t have anything else going on.”
Hermione and Ron were in with me when I had him.  It was evident as soon as Poppy handed him to me whose he was.  Your hair is quite distinctive.”  Harry looked up and shared a smile with Draco.
With the feast ending she stood and walked to the podium to begin her announcements.  “Good evening and welcome to another year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  I hope you’ve all enjoyed the feast and I know you are eager to get to your dorms and unpacked so I’ll keep this as short as possible.  The list of banned items has now grown to number 743 and includes most of the Weasley products I’m positive none of you have hidden in your trunks.” She smiled knowing that even without the Weasley twins in residence they would always plague her sanity.  She refused to admit she had favorites but those two Lions were among hers.  “It is updated by Mr. Filch as needed.  You can find this list outside his door on the 1
“Yes, I guess you know a little about what I’m about to go into.”  Draco continued at her nod, ignoring Theo’s look of confusion.  He’d soon understand himself.  “Frank and Alice Longbottom were aurors during the first war and have a son who was born the day before Harry Potter. A prophecy had been given that could have referred to either Harry or Neville but neither would escape it.  One lost his parents to murder, the other lost his parents to madness.  Bella’s job was to attack the Longbottoms.  It would have been kinder to simply murder them but that’s something she’s never been accused of.  She placed them under her
He let his mind wonder as he cleaned himself.  He had a much better time last night than he had ever thought he would.  Not that he would willingly admit it to Mother or even Blaise but they were right.  He could not shut himself inside the walls of the manor to avoid the reactions his face and name pulled forth.  Life must go on and while he planned to continue experimenting and adjust potions it would no longer be something he hid behind.  Seeing his friends last night had been the death knell in his refusal to return and repeat his final year.  He knew it would not be easy but he had faced much worse before.  He had a noseless bastard living in his home.  He had fallen asleep hearing the gut wrenching screams of agony and pain.  He could handle Hogwarts and use it as a preview of how the wider world would treat him after graduation next June.
Draco knew this was coming.  He had seen her fidget and begin to start this conversation at least 3 times in the last few times they had seen each other.  He was impressed with her self-restraint but annoyed she knew him too well for him to pass it off.  It’d just waste time and she’d convince him to tell her eventually. But what to tell?  A half-truth would suffice but he was also so tired of keeping these secrets.  If he was going to tell anyone he couldn’t chose a better confidant.  Pansy was a notorious gossip but she saw Draco and Blaise’s secrets as off limits.  He took a few more seconds to compose his thoughts and began his story.  “Did you know that Malfoy’s have Veela blood several generations back?” Pansy’s eyes widened and she shook her head.  “Neither did I until I woke up just after midnight on my 16
As far as plans go, I’ve been feeling disheartened for several months with the life I’m leading now.  I’m no longer the angst-ridden teenager trying to run from his problems.  I talked to the band and it’s one of the main reasons we decided to add on a small tour here.  I wanted to see what it felt like coming back home and if I felt ready for that.  It’s safe to say, there’s nothing that could keep me away from getting to know Caelum and being here for him.
“Are you ever going to call me Harry?”  He sat down next to her and motioned everyone to gather round.
They had finally reached the castle and began walking towards the Great Hall.  “I suppose we sit with the rest of the Slytherins?” Pansy asked them.   The room looked the same as it always had.  Large table at the front with professors slowly making their way to their seats and the four long house tables pointed the opposite way.  No one had come up with a satisfactory reason for why they weren’t to purchase new Slytherin robes so her confusion was understood.  The three agreed and made their way to the end of the table.
Draco raised his glass in agreement as the two walked away.  He was nervous but felt at peace with his choice to open up.  He couldn’t wait until tomorrow to see where it would lead the three of them.
Harry wiped the sleep from his eyes and grumbled as he rolled out of bed.  He had spent most of the night sitting up staring at the flames in the fireplace and drinking too much Firewhiskey.  When Draco’s owl came in he nearly threw up with nerves.  It was well past 4 in the morning when he pulled himself into bed to attempt to get at least a couple of hours of sleep.  He managed to drift off for an hour or two before his alarm began to wail bringing him back to a reality he wasn’t sure he was ready to face.
Lunch
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think you just found yourself a project, Mr. Potter.  I’d be delighted if you would put together a proposal so I could bring it in front of the board.  It doesn’t have to be a final draft, just an idea and what you’ve told me in the last few minutes.”
While Hermione agreed Ron and Sirius were much harder to convince.  “Snape was a hateful git, Harry.  He terrorized students and fancied himself above everyone else even with his greasy hair and his hook nose.  I appreciate what he did for us as much as you do but, really?!” Ron bellowed.
Harry really hoped he wasn’t going to hear the lecture from McGonagall that he had avoided getting from Hermione. “Hum…. well, I guess the obvious first thing to do would be to give them a place to get together.  We have the added benefit of a common room for all of us to use while the other years don’t.  While a Gryffindor could probably invite a Hufflepuff into the common room for a chess game, the same could not be said for a Slytherin at this time.  So, you need to provide a place where all houses can combine.
All thought left his mind when he saw Harry begin to descend the stairs.  There was not a word that could describe the way he looked with any degree of fairness.   Perfection seemed too bland.  Draco wanted nothing more than to rip the clothes from him and bury himself deep in his mate’s body.  He heard the inhaled breaths and whispers around him and remembered he wasn’t the only one seeing Harry right now.  For the first time since coming into his inheritance he felt himself start to lose control.   He began to snarl deep in his throat and started to crouch down to pounce and protect his mate from the view of others.  Someone touched his arm and he turned to growl and his eyes locked with Hermione.  That was enough to pull him out of the haze he had fallen into.  He took a deep breath to calm himself before turning away.  He made his way over to where he noticed Pansy smirking in the corner.
“What exactly are you envisioning that seems so far out of reach if you don’t mind me asking, ma’am?”
Umbridge.  Fuck no.  The ministry was changing and had good people in place now but there was no way he’d take the chance of another ministry flunky in his school if he could prevent it.  “How can I help, Professor?”
You are angry at these Slytherins standing among us for things their family or close friends have done.   How long will it take for that anger to fester into hatred of all Slytherins?  Slytherins are mainly made up of purebloods so if we just get rid of the purebloods we won’t have a problem with those nasty snakes, anymore will we?  Let’s just round them up for the slaughter.  How long?  10 years?  20 years?”
“So, you’re saying you’ve changed how
Relationship.  Ha, bloody, ha.  As if what they had could be called a relationship.  Harry had approached Draco on the train ride back to Hogwarts for what was termed their eighth year.  They both mutually agreed to bury the hatchet and simply get through the year.  After the feast they discovered that since there were so few returning students from their year, they’d all be placed in visiting professor’s quarters and only have one roommate.  Wouldn’t you know it that the two of them were roomed together?
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry thanked Sirius for the wakeup call and hugged him as he left the room. He had a lot of thinking to do.
Hermione nodded and noticed Harry making his way down from upstairs.  “Good morning, Harry.  What are your plans for the day?”
“Yes, I got your schedule request and I’d like to come back to that in a minute.  May I first ask if you have any ideas on how to integrate the students together more?”
birthday.  Compared to other’s transitions mine was relatively painless.  It started with a pounding headache that woke me and from there to what I’d compare to a muggle flu.  I lingered in that misery for just over 2 hours and then felt as if fire was racing through my veins.  Thankfully, this didn’t last as long as the flu symptoms, but did last much longer than I liked.  After the fire came full body seizing.  How I managed to stay awake during it all is something I’ve yet to figure out but thankfully after about 15 minutes it all stopped.  I then passed out and had the most vivid dreams I’ve ever had that were filled with someone’s face and body. The next thing I knew I was awake with a raging hard-on knowing I had just dreamt of my mate.  I cursed my traitorous cock and drug myself to take a cold shower before heading to the library to see what the fuck was going on.  I then discovered that, while rare, it is possible for creature blood to bring on a small inheritance to strong wizards in the bloodline no matter how far back the creature was in the family.  Wouldn’t you know it that I’m lucky enough to qualify as a strong wizard so here we are.”
The so called 8
It wasn’t that he was lazy.  He just didn’t see the point in taking every class offered when he was still unsure of exactly what he wanted to do.  The only reason he came back was to figure out Dumbledore’s riddle and he’d already decided to sit back and observe where that was concerned.  With that and abundant free time coming up in mind he sat down to write Sirius a quick letter.
Harry was flummoxed.  Dumbledore made Harry his heir?  But why?  Surely there was someone else.  What about Aberforth?  They were never close to hear Aberforth talk but they were at least family.  Harry began to feel extremely uneasy and guilty.  “I’m sorry, I had no idea. Scrimgeour came to see Ron, Hermione, and myself and gave us each one small thing saying that was what he’d left us.  I was unaware he left me anything more.  I’m not sure what to say.”
Harry understood what McGonagall was saying, but didn’t see how it applied or mattered to him.  “Okay, what kind of favor are you needing me to do?”
“I appreciate the thought, but it’s us.  Together or not at all.” Harry replied.  He placed his hand on the box and felt a tingle of magic ripple across his hands to verify he was the one to open it.  Removing the lid, he saw a bundle of folded parchments tied together as well as an envelope with his name on it.  He pulled both from the box and opened the envelope bearing his name.
“I’m positive.  Before your owl came last night, I was walking through the manor and realized I hadn’t been happy with the life I was leading for quite a while.  I was complacent and bored.  I don’t know exactly what I set out to prove to myself when I left, but I can’t help but feel that it either doesn’t matter or I’ve done it now.  There’s no longer a drive to stay away from Britain and all things magical.  Knowing of Caelum and the possibility to have a relationship again with you one day?  No way could I walk away from that.”  Draco smiled looking at Harry’s gorgeous face.  “Besides, the boy needs his Dragon Daddy full time as much as his Dragon Daddy needs him.”
“HARRY JAMES POTTER! You better have clothes on because I’m opening this door in 10 seconds.”
The week passed in a whirlwind.  Draco met with Pansy and Blaise both together and alone, perfected the taste aspect of the Skele-Gro and was working closer on how to remove the pain the potion caused, and today was currently waiting on Pansy outside the new café on Diagon Alley so they could get the supplies they needed for Hogwarts.  Why he showed up on time was the question he was asking himself.  The day the woman was on time was the day he streaked naked in Muggle London.
This isn’t really the ideal location to talk about it though.  It’s a highly sensitive subject for a member of our year and while I
As they ate their lunch Pansy decided to bring up what had been plaguing her for a while.  After Draco’s 16
year that he’d spend an enjoyable night drinking and socializing with the group that he had last night willingly he’d transport them to St. Mungo’s himself.  He’d even enjoyed himself and looked forward to doing it again.  Ron would no doubt call him barmy when he heard about it.
He was greeted with a small group of house elves.  “Master Potter, Master Albus ordered us to give you this upon your arrival.” The elf handed Harry a medium sized box with his name scrawled on the top. “Would you like me to show you around, sir?”
“I’m not setting out to change his legacy.  I know who he was but I feel this is the right thing to do.  Now I just need to figure out the how.  There’s no rush though and if it makes you uncomfortable to help me figure it out then I understand completely.”
Harry felt his brain and his heart both might explode with all this information.  He knew today was going to be full of possible heartache and revelations, but he never would have pictured Draco’s life going as it had.  And while he assumed he’d want a place in Caelum’s life, he didn’t allow himself to think that Draco would also want a place in his.  There was so much to process and work through and Harry still hadn’t really told Draco anything about Caelum.  He settled in and began to speak.
“Harry, it’s fine. They will understand. You don’t have to have all of the answers now for what you want to do in the future, you just have to realize you now have a future and it’s fine to live it.” Sirius stated. “Now, I’ll deal with the clean-up. You should spend the day thinking about what you want to do, long term or short term, and I want some kind of idea tonight.”
It had been years since Draco Malfoy had set foot on British soil.  He left after completing his N.E.W.T.s as was required by his probation and never looked back.  When Father had been sentenced to Azkaban his Mother lost all sanity and had to be placed in St. Mungo’s.  One he had no desire to ever see or speak to again, the other had no clue who he was.  The friends he had before the war were either dead, in Azkaban with his Father, or had made it clear they wanted nothing to do with the Malfoy heir.  Of course, there was Harry, but it had been over 5 years ago that he walked away from that relationship.
“You’re running this show, Harry.  So, what do you suggest we play?”  Seamus questioned as Dean brought over the Firewhiskey and shot glasses.
Harry did not even care if she picked out a purple tutu at this point.  He had tried to convince the group to leave for the past hour and his pleas were falling on deaf ears.  “Done.  Grab it and I’ll meet you at the register.”   He wasn’t giving her time to realize he wasn’t trying it on in the store since a resizing charm would take care of any issues on that front.  He saw the shoulders slump of Draco and Blaise and pushed down the guilt he felt for bringing the shopping to an end.  They could always come back another time.  He made his way towards the front of the store where Hermione was talking to Theo.  “Hey, we’re about to head back towards the castle I believe.  Did you guys get everything you need?”
Herbology
They all agreed visiting Phoenix Perch today was for the best.  As Ron, Hermione, and Harry cleaned up the mess from breakfast Sirius fire-called Andromeda and asked her if she could take Teddy for a few hours while they investigated what might be hidden at Phoenix Perch.  She agreed and came flooed over and less than an hour later the four of them were off.
Hermione faced five fingers, Theo faced four, and Susan faced one.  “Shocking, Hermione can be found in the library!” Neville exclaimed.  “I’ll pick next, most likely to be found snogging in the castle.”  Fingers quickly started flying.  Pansy had the fingers of Draco, Blaise, Theo, Millicent, Susan, and Morag pointed her way.  Harry was targeted by Hermione, Neville, Dean, Seamus, and Hannah.
“Very well.  I’ll have the elves send up lunch.  I shall see you shortly.”
Staring out the window lost in his thoughts Harry didn’t even hear the door open and close when Hermione entered.  She was thankful to get the chance to complete her last year and couldn’t wait to see the castle again.  This year promised to bring forth all kinds of surprises and hopefully mend bridges that had seemed impassable this time a year ago.  She knew Ron not being a part of their life every day like he had in the past would alter the relationships of the three but was confident it would hold strong even if it wobbled a bit for the first few months.  They’d been through too much together and were so woven into the fabric of each other’s lives that they’d always be connected in one way or the other.  She felt the train begin to stir and pulled the shades while settling in.  As she turned take a seat across from Harry he smiled at her and dropped his glamour.  She returned the smile and settled in for their last ride on the Hogwarts Express.
“We’ll see, Potter.  We’ll see.”  Pansy grabbed a slip out of the pile in the middle when everyone got comfortable and read “Most likely to be found in the library. Oh, that’s completely boring.” She sighed.
Draco woke the next morning feeling as if a Bombarda had been aimed at his head.  He made his way to the bathroom and quickly downed a hangover and pain relief potion before making his way into the shower.  The steam and heat from the pulsing water helped wash away some of the aches and pains.  He was used to the low dull ache that always persisted but considering the traits his creature blood could have brought him he’d accept the pain.  It simply would not do to sprout feathers from his head nor for a beak to replace his mouth.  His research seemed to lead him to believe if he was closer to his mate the pain would lessen.  It could completely disappear with frequent contact but he knew that would never happen.  He had made it this long with no one the wiser and he would continue to do so.
They all seemed to agree and began discussing who wanted to room together.  Neville and Hannah asked for a room alone as did Dean and Seamus.  Justin and Ernie invited Stephen to join them in a room and Pansy offered for Susan and Morag to join her and Millicent in a room.  Padma and Pavati requested a room alone together leaving 5 rooms empty with Harry, Hermione, Draco, Theo, and Blaise remaining.  They each decided to take advantage of having a room to themselves and walked upstairs to change and pick out the rooms.  Harry took the first door he came to and Hermione took the one next to him.  Neville and Hannah had climbed the stairs behind them and followed suit by taking the next room they came to.  Dean and Seamus took the one after that and Padma and Pavati finished out that side of rooms.
Draco wasn’t all that shocked truth be told.   Harry had always seemed to have the weirdest shit happen to him, so this was just par for the course.  “I won't pretend I don't have all kinds of questions about that but I won't push as I think we have enough to discuss today as it is.
At a quarter past 10 the guest of honor finally arrived.  “This party seems extremely boring.  I’m here to elevate it from snooze worthy to spectacular.” Pansy haughtily joked “Obviously, you morons can do nothing without me.”  She finally lowered her upturned nose and noticed Draco among the crowd of her friends.  Tears immediately fell from her eyes.  All the unanswered owls and refused invitations were forgotten.  By some miracle Draco was here.  She refused to question why she had been given such a wonderful gift and instead threw her arms around his neck hugging him tightly.  “Draco,” she sobbed “I’ve missed you so much, you idiotic prat.”
Wednesday
Godric’s Hollow was also easily ruled out.  Harry had no desire even if it was renovated to live where his parents were brutally murdered and it seemed too obvious of a choice.  When the papers got wind that he moved out of Grimmauld and renovations were occurring in the tiny town most would be able to put two and two together.  With that, Harry returned his eyes and thoughts to the list in front of him.
Tuesday
“Last I time I checked, yes.  How have you been Theo?” Draco inquired.  He had just begun to realize how out of touch he had gotten with his friends not only since the end of the war, but since his 16
“I can’t help but agree whoever this chap is needs to be thanked at the least and I’d say deserves more honoring than Snape does myself.” Ron added.
“Precisely.  It could be a long way off but that is my goal.”
Harry spent the morning finalizing his class schedule and while he knew Hermione would be upset with him only taking 4 classes, he knew it was the right choice.  There was nothing saying he couldn’t sit the N.E.W.T.s for classes he did not attend and he planned on pointing that out to her when brought it up.  Not that he intended to do so, but he knew it’d at least get her to drop it.
Lunch
“Harry.  Sure, we can start with about 40 I guess.  I don’t know that we’ll make it through everyone’s tonight as late as it is and with as many of us playing.  A few of us could end up passed out quickly depending on what everyone has chosen.”
“I’m still doing the same thing today that I was doing last night when you came by. Working on streamlining and simplifying potions. But if you are that interested in my work that if I recall correctly you called boring and needless last night, I would be happy to send you updates every hour by house elf or owl.”
“That is completely up to you.  As our incoming first years were almost double the normal size due to parents either not sending them last year or them being muggleborn, we think it would be easier to have 4 classes instead of the regular two.  You’re looking at 2 classes of 40 students or 4 classes of 20.  You won’t have an assistant like you did in the D.A.”
Narcissa paled. While she agreed she would not have phrased it quite like that. “Draco dear, please consider if not Hogwarts, just leaving the house. Blaise was telling me Pansy’s birthday is approaching and they are having a party for her. Go. See your friends and test the waters. If it goes bad I promise to not mention Hogwarts again. I just want you happy.”
Harry was finishing up his class list as he looked up and smiled at her wishing her a good morning.  “I need clothes.  Hermione got me a few outfits last year before we took off, but they got a real rough treatment being repeatedly worn and hit with cleaning charms so much.  I think one more might tear them apart.  Did you guys want to join?  I know I need at least one or two decent robes, but I prefer muggle clothes, so I’ll spend more time focusing on that.”
Harry had missed the beginning of Draco’s reaction as he was too mortified to look up at anyone.  He focused all his concentration on walking down the stairs and tried to pretend he didn’t notice how the conversations had stopped with his entry.  He did see the look of disdain on his face as he spoke to Pansy and for a second felt hurt.  There was no doubt that Draco had been a first-class cunt through the first 6 years of their schooling, but he seemed to have grown up.  Had Harry been wrong?  He’d always found Draco attractive even if he’d never said so out loud to anyone.  Ron would have had an apocalyptic meltdown at the mere mention.  With Hermione there was no need, as she would just smile and say she’d already figured out Harry’s attraction ages ago.  Attractive or not, his caustic personality and shitty choices had wiped away any chance to explore said attraction.  He sighed quietly and faced the crowd.    “Well, what are we waiting for?  Let’s go!”
“After all the romantic nights in the woods the three of us shared I thought we had left the modesty behind.” Harry smirked and pulled his pajama pants on as he rose to open his bedroom door.  He hadn’t slept much at all last night because he was so worried about the reaction his letter would bring.  He opened the door with a huge grin and threw his arms around the brother and sister of his heart.
“Pans, the love I have for you goes so deep into my soul that I couldn’t find the beginning of it if I tried.  You are one of the most important people in my life and I would mourn the loss of you until my dying day.  With that said, a very large part of me wants to rip out your throat for your part in this fuckery.”  He rubbed his face with both hands and used every ounce of self-control he possessed to push down the urges he was having to hide and claim his mate.  Hermione had noticed his behavior and was eyeing him across the room now.  He knew there’d be questions to answer from her soon if she didn’t put it together on her own.  He wouldn’t put it past her.  If anyone had a chance in hell at exposing his secret it’d be her.  “Let’s get the fuck out of this room before I make more of a scene than I already have.”  With that he made his way to the floo and disappeared in the green flames.
With a sigh he climbed out of bed and gathered his things for a shower.  He figured he could take advantage of the freedoms they had been given and finally get a few decent sets of clothes.  Hermione would probably join him, but he’d also invite the others along if they wanted to go.  Maybe they could make a day of it and have dinner out at a nice restaurant to relax as well.  Couldn’t hurt to ask at least.  He made his way to the shower with a smile on his face and a spring in his step.
Pansy knew this was going to be good.  She had placed herself with her back towards Potter’s room with a view of everyone’s faces but mainly Draco’s.  She couldn’t wait to see just how he held himself together.  He’d always been a bit obsessed with Potter through the years so this whole mate business just made things more interesting.  As the room went silent she knew Potter had come into view.  “I’m positive you look stunning so get your ass down here, so we can get going.”
Standing on the platform of 9 ¾ was a bit over whelming for Harry.  The past two weeks at Phoenix Perch with Ron and Hermione was just what they needed but going from the quiet and calm villa to the absolute chaos that was happening in front of him was astonishing.  He loaded his trunk and boarded the train.  He was making use of a glamour again to avoid the masses as well as to hopefully find an abandoned compartment to relax a bit before the train left the station.  He soon found one near the back and entered.  He couldn’t lower the blinds until Hermione joined him but he wouldn’t remove the glamour until those were pulled either.  Hermione knew him well enough that she’d recognize him from his body language alone.
I guess I’m saying, we will still be here in the long run.  If the feelings and desire is there, then we’ll see where it leads.”
He glanced at his watch and replied “I can be.  If you give me 30 minutes to clean up and put my things away, I can meet you in your office after?”
The four of them stood in front of a house unlike they’d ever seen.  The exterior was a light cream stone that gleamed in the sunlight.  Upon closer inspection it appeared to be marble.  There were palm trees decorated thought the grounds as well as more tropical looking plants that Harry had no idea what to call.  It looked to have at least 3 levels but it wasn’t as overwhelming as a manor would be.  Harry spotted a beautiful pool to the side of the house that he walked towards.  The beginning of it that was on the side of the house was shaped more like a river, winding and shallow.  It would be perfect for Teddy to wade around in.  The pool continued to snake its way towards the back of the house where it went wide into a freeform but rounded shape that was much deeper.  There was seating for at least 50 scattered around with several structures built in to offer shade.
*Flashback*
Harry kind of cut her off here and said “Professor, I really debated even coming back this year.  I am very glad I did now, but I really don’t want to spend the year rushing around worried about every single class.  I don’t even know for sure what my future holds so I decided to just enjoy myself and relax.  If in the future I decide I want to do something that requires a N.E.W.T. I’ve not taken, then I’ll study and take it then.  I don’t see that as a likely scenario, but it’s easy enough to fix.”
Ron nodded and said “I doubt I’ll ever see the method to your madness on this, but I know you and you won’t give up on it.  I’ll help if you need me.”  Sirius agreed and the conversation moved on.
“Anyway, it was decided that they’d move in to both keep an eye on me and kick me in the arse when needed.  For a month things seemed to be going better, I was eating a bit better and we’d venture out somewhere at least once a week and life seemed to be getting back on track.  But I couldn’t shake the tiredness and had begun to put on weight unexpectedly.  I’d randomly be so exhausted I’d fall asleep at the table almost in the middle of dinner.  Hermione, being Hermione, was determined to figure out what was wrong as I had refused to go to Mungo’s.  She researched curses, depression, muggle illnesses, magical illnesses, you name it and I can almost guarantee you that she looked into it.
“History of Magic is not being offered as a class but as you can see you have plenty of free periods to study independently and I dare say you will learn more on your own than if you took the class.  I will be your Transfiguration professor and we are bringing in a Professor to instruct you in Defense but otherwise your professors will remain the same as the other students.  The 8
“One of our rooms is fine.  I’m pretty sure all we have to do is tell the others we are talking potion theory and they will all zone out and forget we exist.”  Draco chuckled.  He was excited and scared at the possibility in front of him.  His version of the truth potion was grand for sure, but it didn’t have the ability to change people’s lives like this one.  If he could make this one work, he could help countless witches and wizards as well as right some of the wrongs his family had done over the years.  “For now, let’s just relax and have fun.  Theo, take this beautiful lady over there and show her how terrible you are at dancing.”  You’d have to be blind not to notice the looks the two had been sending each other all day.  He figured they’d be together by Yule.
After the breakout she was instructed by my father to ‘teach’ me occlumency and how to be a good little Death Eater.  Her training left much to be desired and for every time I failed to block her intrusions into my mind I received a
“I’m glad to hear it.  I have a lot of faith in all of my students but fear the changes I’d like to see happen during my time as Headmistress will be out of reach without your year showing the others there can be a different way.”
There was a small pop and a house elf was standing before him. “Master Draco, Mistress Narcissa requests you join her in the conservatory.”
“I appreciate the offer, but I think I’m just going to sit here a while and think.  I can’t wait to see you and Caelum in a couple of hours.”  Draco felt his heart was going to burst with all the joy he was feeling.  Harry nodded his acceptance and smiled before disappearing in front of Draco’s eyes.  As Draco sat in the stands processing everything he had learned in less than 24 hours he couldn’t help but wonder what his son would think of him.  With a grin he stood and made his way to the gates.  He was meeting his son in less than 3 hours.  He couldn’t show up empty handed so he was off to Harrods.  He had to find the perfect gift for his dragon loving little boy.
While the two of them were talking the others had made their way downstairs.  “Shopping?  What kind of shopping are we talking?”  Pansy asked.
“By all means, Mr. Potter.  I’m delighted to hear any suggestions.”
“Thank you, Theo.” Draco then turned to gauge Hermione’s reaction to his news and saw the tears streaking down her face.  Before he knew what had happened he had a head of hair in his face and arms wrapped tightly around him.
After a good soak and thorough scrubbing Harry decided the best thing he could do would be to go to bed.  He knew waiting up for a reply tonight would be pointless as The Burrow was a long flight and it was already as late as it was.  He climbed in his bed and pulled the covers over his head willing his mind to stop swirling in so many directions.  Finally, after what felt like hours, he drifted off to sleep.
Sorry for the delay.  I hit a snag on where I wanted the story to go and where the story was taking me.  By the time I worked out that snafu I discovered my charger cord was missing and my laptop was dead.  Amazon Prime to the rescue!  Hope you like this chapter and I'll have at least one or two more uploaded in the next few days.  Thank you for the kind comments and kudos!  It helps to know I'm not completely screwing up on this first attempt at fanfiction.
Lunch
Hermione gasped in awe.  Creating potions wasn’t unheard of as advanced potions masters did it all the time.  That was where the shock came in.  Draco hadn’t even sat his N.E.W.T.s and he had invented a potion of this caliber?  If it worked as he said it did then he’d easily make history.  “I’d love to see your work and theory.  How long have you been working on potions like this?”
Hermione, I’m sure you know at least a little of what I’m going to share but Theo I do not think you are aware.  I know it doesn’t seem quite right to ask without saying why, but I’m going to ask for a Wizard’s Oath before going too far into explanations. I don’t care about my research getting out and normally wouldn’t be so presumptuous to require one, but this involves a very personal and tragic story for someone else so therefore, I think it’d be the right thing to do.”  He knew it was a risk as he really needed their help, but he was inflexible on this point.
‘Ok,’ Harry thought ‘one thing decided.  I need a house of my own.  That wasn’t so bad.’  Maybe with this choice made the rest would fall into place.  At worst they’d still sit there waiting for action.  It didn’t really matter because at least he was making progress and would have something to tell Sirius at dinner tonight.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Potter.  I understand you have some questions about your inheritances.  How may I assist you?”  Ragnok inquired.
“Of course, I did.  You have two and one would assume you were made aware of them.” Ragnok retorted.
Harry sat looking out the window of 12 Grimmauld Place at the passing muggles while trying to decide where to go from here. The battles were finished, the war won, the madman was dead. Now what? Since joining the magical world he’d faced one trial after the other with seemingly no end and never thought he’d survive to have to worry about a future. Hermione thought he should go back to Hogwarts and sit his N.E.W.T.s with her and the rest of the returning students. Ron was starting auror training in the fall instead much to her dismay. Harry didn’t feel right with either suggestion and didn’t want to make a choice while feeling so frozen in confusion to regret it later.
