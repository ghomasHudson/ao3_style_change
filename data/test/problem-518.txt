"You two are disgusting." She says smiling fondly and Harry grins when Draco blushes, probably just realising that they aren't alone. He sighs and sits up properly, rolling his eyes when Harry throws his legs across his lap the second he's upright, and smiling nervously at Hermione and Ron.
"Harry, listen, we're hoping to close the tattoo pools today, so would you be willing to show your tattoo at dinner?" He asks and Harry bites his lip, he was only opposed to people knowing about it because he didn't want Draco to know how he feels, but now he knows Harry has nothing to hide. And it would be a cool way to show everyone that knows about his tattoos his new one. Hermione will know why he got a wolf straight away, as will Draco.
"Thank you, Professor."
"Come on darlin." Harry says, grabbing Draco's hand and pulling him up off the bed before pulling on his shoes and grabbing his bag before the two of them walk to transfiguration.
"I want to go to the library and start my potions essay, but I gotta pick up my stuff first." Harry says and she smiles at him, clearly glad he's showing an interest in his school work for once. In reality he doesn't really want to be a third wheel with Ron and Hermione and when he's in the library people usually leave him alone.
"So what you said the other day-" He cuts himself off.
Draco hasn't been with a guy before, and he's only been with a few girls too. Harry on the other hand has fooled around with pretty much every Gryffindor his age and some Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs his age too. He didn't sleep with all of them, but he's done enough to know exactly what he's doing, and the innocence of Draco is so fucking adorable that Harry just wants to pull him into a hug. Draco decides to try and channel some of Harry's bravery and ask for what he's been wanting since he was first saw Harry in diagon alley. He leans close to Harry, which makes Harry wrap his arms around Draco and pull him flush against him.
"So you weren't that drunk then." He says and Harry laughs.
"Wanna stay in our dorm tonight? It's only me and Draco in our room cause not that many people came back this year." Blaise asks and Harry bites his cheek. He would rather stay in a Slytherin dorm than go and face his 'friends' again, but he looks awful and doesn't really want Draco to see him, also if he sleeps in the same room as him he might wake up from a nightmare and he doesn't want that.
"I'm going to assume you've used the pensive before?" McGonagall says and Harry nods. The box is divided into quarters, 50 vials from each person, their first name initial is on the lid of each vial, and there's 50 attached to the lid, all with gold lids.
"What happened?"
"No offence, professor, but not really." He says before going over to the Gryffindor table.
Also How is everyone? I complain about my life all the time but I haven't checked in on you in a while so what's going on?? How is everyone? Shit family life? Feel sick? School/work sucks? Friends are arseholes? I been through it all my dudes so I got you <3
An hour and a half, and 5 (and a half) friendly games of quidditch later, both teams land on the grass out of breath and laughing their asses off as Will and Glenn, the 5th year slytherin chaser, argue about who fell of their brooms in the coolest way when they collided midair, both of them crying with laughter as they reenact it. Harry is laughing too, and although he's feeling joy he still has his usual depressing thoughts. Ginny doesn't know where this side of Harry came from but he's more himself than he has been in months and she really hopes it's not because of Blaise.
"What is it?" He asks, his voice breaking. Sirius left him something? What could there be? Everything he left to Harry was in his will.
"So pretty." He says, bringing a hand up to run through Dracos hair.
"Yeah, I went to get him last night and I thanked him, cause he's looking after Harry, and, well, he didn't technically say it, but I told him I know he loves Harry and it's obvious and he just said he wanted to make sure he was okay first but like, it's so obvious."
"I don't like you, Draco." Harry mumbles as he walks towards the door, and Draco watches him with a small smile.
Two hours later and Harry has eaten just under half of his dinner and is now playing exploding snap with Billy, who is sat on the end of his bed. Billy is only in the hospital wing until tomorrow morning because he was only in here until the slight affects of the potion he accidentally ingested during class are healed. They have to be careful as to not interrupt madam Pomfrey, so they're talking quietly.
"Something quidditch related?" Harry says as they enter the first shop.
"I am in love with you too, Harry Potter." Draco says before kissing Harry again.
"I've got to show you something too. Do you trust me?" Harry asks and Draco nods without hesitation. Harry jumps down from the wall and pulls out the map, checking that no one is near the whomping willow and laughing quietly at Draco's shocked and impressed look.
"Everything. Well, not everything. Me and Draco, how you and Hermione know. He isn't happy about it." George frowns and places his hand on Harrys knee.
"Oh don't look at me like that. What happened?"
Also for when you want to wish me a happy birthday because I'm great and you all love me my insta is @achievement.unlocked I expect a message from each of you.
"Potter. I need to see you in my office later. Come by after your last period." She says before handing him his timetable and walking away. Harry sighs as he walks out of the hall, not bothering to wait for anyone. His timetable says his first lesson is at 10am, so he has an hour and a half until class. He rushed up to his dorm, has a quick shower and pulls on his uniform, instead of wearing trousers he pulls on some skinny jeans, before grabbing his bag, which his sketchbook and reading book is in, and making his way to the lake. He sits with his back against a tree trunk and looks across the lake at the mountains in the distance. He takes out his sketchbook and a pencil, muggle objects obviously he's not going to faff with a quill and ink, and starts sketching his view, going into so much detail, detail you wouldn't even notice in real life unless you sat there studying the view for hours on end, and an hour and a half later Harry has the perfect sketch.
"I'm gonna assume you don't mean when we're fighting?" Draco jokes quietly and Harry smiles slightly.
"You don't have to do this alone, mate."
"What?" He whispers, and Blaise's smile widens.
"Not sure. Sometimes I'm okay. Sometimes I'm not." He says and McGonagall nods.
Harry hears a knock at the door and shouts for the person to come in as Teddy flies past him to get the snitch again. The door opens and Draco walks in, smiling when Teddy flies past him.
"Why do you know how to do that? Only the most powerful wizards can use legilimency." Draco asks just as the doors open.
"I should have realised that the war affected you so much more than it did us, I mean, you were the one that had to stop it. That was a lot of pressure on you, and I should have helped you through that." Ron says and Harry takes a shaky breath in.
"Are you sure? We don't have to rush." Harry says and Draco nods.
"They were talking about their bullshit pure blood values and how I'm lucky I have a pure blood cousin. I told them there is nothing wrong with half blood or muggle born and they told me I'm marrying a pure blood whether I like it or not because they will not have me disgrace the Black name. I told them to go to hell. That wasn’t the best idea I’ve ever had. Mother started screaming at me. Father was hitting me over and over again. I managed to get to my room and lock the door but they wouldn’t stop shouting and trying to get in so I grabbed a bag and then I left." Sirius says and James sighs.
I'm sick again! Who's surprised though, really? :') I went to Cornwall (It's beautiful and if I wasn't so in love with London I would deffo live there at some point in my life) and it pissed down and I got sick so there's that.
So this fic is now done! I hope you enjoyed it and all that. If you did go leave a comment or kudos or both if you're feeling super great and if you really enjoyed it maybe share it with people you know, like your best friend, your mum, your nan, or your dog. I reckon your dog would love it. Okay I'm rambling because I'm literally at work sat at my desk right now and I really don't want to do actual work things and typing this makes it look like I'm working so hey, its a win win situation. Although I am definitely gonna post this with this rambling all over it and you're still reading it so maybe its a win win lose situation cause I feel so sorry for you reading this okay I'll stop anyway thanks for reading love you <3
"You don't like him?"
"Harry?" He asks and Harry shakes his head.
"I'm guessing he's gonna be in here a lot then, huh?" Draco looks back at Harry and watches him breath peacefully.
"You been outside since Potions?" Harry nods again and Draco rolls his eyes.
"He sticks up for everyone." Draco mutters, looking back at Hermione, and Hermione shakes her head.
"No worries, Harry. Work on my technique and try again next year, right?" She says what Harry told her to do earlier, and he nods.
"Okay, Hermione, Ginny and I will check the quidditch pitch. You three go check the forbidden forest. Send up sparks when we find him." Ron says and Seamus raises an eyebrow.
"I told Ron."
"I'm glad ye finally getting along with him."
"Would you like me to give you some dreamless sleep?" Madam Pomfrey asks and Harry shakes his head, getting off the bed.
"You must invite him over for tea one day, Draco. I've been meaning to check on him, and this is the perfect excuse." Draco nods as he finishes his dinner.
"About what?" He asks quietly and Draco stares into his eyes.
"Love you." He whispers and when Draco says it back he kisses him again.
"You went to see him?"
"I don't have much money, but boy if I did, I'd buy a big house where we both could live..." Harry looks up at Draco as he sings, and it takes Draco until the chorus to figure out this is a love song, and he blushes at the words Harry is singing because he's looking into his eyes and singing them to him and Draco is so bloody in love with him and he really hopes Harry feels the same way and didn't just pick this song because he likes it.
"Nonsense Draco, sit down." She says and Draco awkwardly walks over to sit on the other side of the sofa. Harry notices he's wearing his shirt with the sleeves rolled up and his tattoo proudly on display and smiles slightly as he looks at his handiwork.
It's empty, as usual, so he strips down and gets in the shower, turning the water on so it's nearly unbearably hot. The room quickly fills with steam and Harry likes the fact that he can barely see the other side of the bathroom through it. Harry thinks when he showers. His mind drifts, and sometimes it goes to nice places, happy memories, and good times. Other times he's 6 years old and he's locked in the cupboard because Vernon has work friends over and they mustn't know Harry exists, or he's 12 and he's locked in the cupboard because Dudley said he tried to curse him, even though Harry didn't have his wand and he didn't yet know how to use magic without it. Right now he isn't any of these things. He's 18 and he's walking along the lake with Malfoy and their little fingers are linked and they're not saying anything but they're both just existing. Harry sighs and rests his head against his forearm against the side of the shower, letting the hot water run down his back.
"How come Filch didn't tell Dumbledore about it?" Draco asks.
"Worried about me, Draco?" Harry asks and he means it as a joke but he sounds curious and sincere as he says it. Draco is quiet for a minute.
"And there's the added bonus that you're flustered and hard. Which is always hot." Harry says, stepping onto the same stair as Draco and pressing him against the column that goes up the center of the spiral staircase.
"Alright, you stay here and I'll get the ingredients." Blaise stands up and Harry still isn't sure what they're actually meant to be making. Are they making a pepperup potion? Or did they just have to write about it? He doesn't remember this essay being set. Slughorn walks over and Harry looks up at him.
"He's talking to the Slytherins?!" Ginny nods.
"Well firstly obviously how it happened! But like, when did it happen, what did you say?" Blaise asks and Harry is glad he's happy for them and he's excited but he also feels like what they said is private, and honestly it's mostly things Blaise has heard Harry say before.
"He escaped Azkaban and was wanted by the ministry because they thought he was trying to help Voldemort. He said we'd live together when everything was better. But he was killed fifth year." Harry says sadly.
"Really?"
"They'll think you're even stronger. Harry admitting you need help is the bravest thing you've ever done." A tear falls down Harry's cheek and Draco wipes it away. The rain is falling so hard now that the pair can barely see the mountains and the lake through it.
"I really wish that was true." Draco moves his hand onto Harry's neck and runs his thumb over Harry's jaw.
"Does he know?"
"Fuck off, Billy." Harry calls back lightly while Draco blushes and Blaise laughs.
"That's believable." He says, deadpan. Draco stays quiet, staring at the door opposite them as if he's debating running through it.
"Have you seen Potter?" He asks slowly and she shakes her head and bites her lip. "Not since lunch. I was hoping he'd gone to your dorm. But I haven't seen him anywhere." She says and Draco smiles reassuringly.
"Oh dear. Well, that does seem like the lesser of two evils." Harry presses a kiss to Draco's neck before lying next to him again, pulling him into a cuddle.
On Thursday morning, when Harry and Draco are lying together in bed before classes start, they decide to 'enter phase 2' as Harry puts it.
"You look so much like him." Draco says and Harry smiles slightly, remembering when Sirius told him that. The 19 year olds sat on the sofa are laughing and joking about something Sirius said when a red headed young woman walks in. She's beautiful, and Harry gets why everyone tells him he has his mothers eyes.
"Okay I'm taking you to the hospital wing." Harry shakes his head.
"This one may interest you." She says and Harry looks down.
"I don't know." Harry whimpers, leaning forward and resting his forehead on Seamus' shoulder.
"It's a mystery." She says knowingly, before changing the subject. "I have had many people sign up for the team. I trust they have left you alone?" She enquires. Harry nods.
"Everything Hermione said is true." He says. Especially the stuff she said to Harry about being in love with Draco.
"Me and Draco are together now." Harry says and Ron lets a small smile spread across his face.
"Bit clingy." Harry mutters, but he's joking and he wraps his arms tight around Dracos waist anyway. Draco smiles and buries his face in Harry's neck and Harry wonders where all of this affection came from.
"I'm not even convinced he feels the same way I do."
"We'll see you soon then." He says, glaring at Seamus for a moment before leaving the greenhouse.
"Harry, My boy, how are you?"
“Alright fine but I’m taking Harry.” She says and Draco immediately reaches out and grabs Harry’s shirt.
"So tell me everything!" He says excitedly and Harry shrugs, pressing a kiss against Draco's knuckles before going back to playing with Draco's fingers.
"Make yourself at home." Harry mutters jokingly and Blaise chuckles.
"Thought you'd like it." He mutters, blushing, and Harry smiles at how adorable Draco is.
"So?"
Draco eventually finds the will to wake Harry up, softly calling his name and patting his arm until he stirs, and Harry whimpers against his back but eventually forces himself to get up. The two make their way to Herbology, arriving a few minutes late but when Professor Sprout sees Harry and the post nap sleepiness radiating off of him she just smiles slightly and tells them to take a seat. They both walk to their seats in the back of the class, and no one mentions the fact that their little fingers are linked again, or that Draco squeezes Harry's hand before they let go and sit down in their seats.
"Did he say why?"
"Is he doing okay? You said earlier that he's got a lot on his mind." Draco asks, figuring now is a good a time as any.
"Tonight." He says and a grin spreads across her face.
"Prick." Draco mutters, but he presses his knee against Harry's to show him he's not actually mad, well, he is but not that much.
"No rude remarks. In fact we actually help each other if we notice the other one is stuck." Harry says and she raises an eyebrow.
"We're making pepperup?" He asks Blaise to make sure, and Blaise looks at him over the cauldron.
"Are you sure?"
but he also knows how hard it is, so he just winds his arms around Harry and presses their foreheads together.
"Sooooo..." Blaise says as he sits back down at his table, smirking. Draco looks up and raises an eyebrow.
"No." He admits.
"I'm not tired, Draco." He says dismissively and before Draco can say anything else Harry is grabbing his wand off of the bedside table and leaving the room.
"Yeah at dinner."
"The one you gave him?" Draco nods slightly.
"Harry?"
"Redirecting that curse."
"That is my question exactly." McGonagall says and Harry sighs when she walks over.
"Okay." Draco says to tell him he's got one.
"Sleep?" Draco asks and Harry nods, lying down. Draco quickly changes into some comfier clothing before lying down next to Harry. They're both lying facing each other, and Draco is sure there's still a blush on his cheeks.
"I don't know how I would even begin to talk to him."
"Of course not. Their great golden boy is with an ex death-eater. I think the only person they would disapprove of more would be if you were to date Voldemort himself." Harry chuckles.
"I thought you were okay with Weasel now?" Harry shrugs.
George looks at Draco and smiles slightly at the look on his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You'll always be Potter." He says and Harry smiles.
"Stag?" He asks and Harry smiles, yet again casting the Patronus and Teddy giggles as it gallops round the room and stops in front of him, bending down so Teddy can see its face.
Draco shrugs, he doesn't want to do anything. He want's to lie down with Harry and have a nap.
"Harry dear how are you?" A woman asks, and Draco tenses next to Harry. Harry just smiles at the woman.
As he gets to the corridor of his room he hears footsteps and a call.
"But you're not gonna."
"You too, Zabini."
"I think it's more he doesn't trust Draco. But what's important is that you do, and that he trusts you. Being in a relationship with no trust is like being on a rowboat with no oars. You can paddle with your hands but in the end you'll not go anywhere and you'll be exhausted." George says and Harry smiles slightly.
"Knowing he- Right now, I don't know he loves me, in fact I highly doubt it, so if something was to happen, I feel like it wouldn't hurt as much, cause I wouldn't be losing as much. But- if I was to tell him, and by some miracle he loved me too, then I would have so much more to lose. And I've..." Harry meets McGonagalls gaze again, tears forming in his eyes. "I've lost everything. And it hurts so much, it hurts just being alive, without my parents or Siri-" Harry's words get stuck in his throat and he takes a shaky breath. "I'm so tired of losing everything. So if I have nothing, I have nothing to lose. I can't get hurt again." McGonagall stands up and does something Harry never thought would happen. She walks round the desk and pulls Harry up into a hug.
"I just want to everything to stop." Harry whispers, his voice broken and quiet since he hardly uses it, and Seamus' eyes turn sympathetic as he looks at Harry. He turns his body towards Harry and places his hands on his shoulders.
"What happened?" Madam Pomfrey asks as she helps Blaise sit Harry on a bed.
"I have something for you. I was instructed to wait until your 21st birthday, however we both feel it would benefit you now." She says and Harry raises an eyebrow.
"Harry is Draco's date. Blaise said he was invited. I hope it's not going to be a problem." She's talking sternly, because Harry is with her son so he is family, and she protects her family.
"As do you, Narcissa." Harry returns the hug. "I, er, I don't know if this is, like, okay? Kreacher said this is what Sirius used to wear and now I kind of think it's probably not a good idea." Harry says, and Narcissa smiles.
“I’m having a boy! I’m having a son! Oh my god I’m gonna have a little boy!” James says excitedly before grabbing Lily in a hug.
Ron walks into Harry's dorm and sees him sitting on his bed. Harry looks up, expecting Draco, and widens his eyes when he sees Ron.
Narcissa knows there's something going on that Draco hasn't told her, and it's not that he doesn't want to, it's just that it's awkward and he's worried about how she'll react. They're sat eating dinner, and Draco has barely looked up at her.
"Are you sure?" Draco nods.
"Alright fine." Harry sighs, "5."
"But I almost killed you, and I'm technically the reason her husband is in Azkaban. And I'm the reason-"
"Yeah." They both stand up, legs aching slightly from being sat down on the hard ground for so long, and make their way up to the castle. When they enter the great hall there's only a few first and second years there so Harry follows Draco over to the Slytherin table and sits next to him. No one casts a second glance and Harry feels slight relief wash over him.
"Promised George I'd come visit him." Harry says and Draco raises an eyebrow.
"Okay, for one, I think she's glad she saved you, she doesn't regret it. She wanted your side to win as much as you did. For two, I think her finding out you almost killed me would be less of a shock than her finding out we're together. For three, and I don't want you to worry or anything, but she already knows where and how I got these scars." Draco says, Harry chuckling at the second point and his eyes widening at the third.
"Is the whole point of me bringing Harry here so you can constantly tell him how hot he is?" He mutters, and Harry laughs quietly.
"Are you feeling okay?" Harry nods.
"Why are you talking to him more than you're talking to us?" Ron asks and Harry sighs, putting his book down on the bed in front of him.
"What d'you want?" He asks, not sounding as annoyed as he'd like, but sounding extremely tired.
"Harry where were you? I was worried!" Hermione asks and Harry shrugs, not in the mood for her mothering. "Around." Harry says simply before walking up to his dorm without looking back.
"Interesting... Well they'll find out tomorrow." Harry says.
"Come on. You wanna nap, so lets nap." Harry says as if reading Draco's thoughts.
"I really do. So you'll come?"
"Ron and the Slytherin beater are having a fight in the quad. Kinda need help diffusing the situation." She says and Harry rolls his eyes before standing up and following Hermione out of the dorm, Draco following them both out too.
"What would I say?"
"Shut up, Harry."
"Hey." Ron says, kind of sheepishly, and Harry sits up straight.
"Okay, listen. You need to be okay with this cause I've already had drama with Ron about it and I can't be bothered to go through it again." Harry says and Seamus nods.
"I can manage not being a prat for a few minuets." Draco mutters trying to lighten the mood and Harry tries to breath out a laugh but his heart's not in it and he just sounds tired so Draco just pulls him closer.
Harry wakes up on Friday morning to madam Pomfrey giving him a bowl of porridge. Harry grumbles as he eats some of it, about half, before getting up and dressed. McGonagall brought him some clothes and his bag earlier this morning, according to Pomfrey, and she's agreed Harry can go to his classes as long as he doesn't try and do anything that will make him dizzy or overwhelmed. He walks out of the hospital wing with his bag slung over his shoulder. He reads as he walks, having decided to re-read sense and sensibility, and he almost walks into Blaise outside their potions classroom.
"Nice tattoo Malfoy." Ron says and Harry can tell he's trying to stop Draco feeling awkward.
They stay and chat on the bridge for a while and Harry realises that he hasn't spoken to Ron properly in a while and it's actually nice to sit and talk to his best friend. Ron leaves after an hour or so and Harry gets off the railing and stands leaning against it instead, enjoying the view. After being alone for a few minutes he feels someone lean next to him and grins, not even looking over to see who it is; he already knows.
"Yeah I have." Draco says, blushing slightly, and Blaise raises an eyebrow.
When Harry grabs Draco's dick with one hand and kisses the tip Draco lets out a loud moan and Harry has to stop himself from groaning at how amazing that sound was. He licks along the underside of Dracos dick and when he gets to the end he sucks on the tip, making Draco tremble.
"How about 1?" Harry shrugs.
Harry wasn't sure what he was expecting, but the wall of bookshelves full of both muggle and wizard books was not it. He knows Draco likes reading, but he didn't think he'd have a floor to ceiling bookshelf in his room that covers the width of the entire wall. Draco squeezes his hand again, leads him over to the bed, and they lie down together, Draco burying himself in Harry's side.
"Harry he's a good kid. He cares about you. That's all that matters to us." Remus says and Harry smiles slightly, never realising how much he would appreciate their approval until now.
"Alright, I'll go talk to him." Ron says and Draco smiles slightly.
"Potter, are you okay?" Madam Hooch asks and Harry sits up, the snitch still in his right hand.
"Why can't we come in?" Draco asks nervously when Madam Pomfrey refuses him and Blaise access to the hospital wing, assuming something bad had happened.
"'M okay." He says. He's still shirtless as his fever hasn't quite gone yet and he would be quite embarrassed if it wasn't for the fact that he's so tired.
"I know you still can't talk to me because of Fred. But it's okay, Harry. We miss him, but we're okay. None of us blame you. You don't need to feel guilty, Harry." Ron says and Harry feels a tear roll down his cheeks.
"Ron he's been in love with him for years, maybe now they're finally conversing without fighting he can actually do something about it."
"I'm not sure that's a good idea." Harry says quietly and Blaise looks at him.
"Okay, now I will ask Poppy to arrange a time and day you are free, and we will let you know. And Potter if there is anything you need let me know." McGonagall says with a smile and Harry nods.
"I won't make you eat anything." Draco promises, and Harry looks at him for a second longer before moving his hands, shoving his right hand in his hoodie pocket and holding Draco's hand tight with his other one. Draco seems to take this as a yes because he smiles slightly and walks towards the hall.
"Yeah I'm good. Hear your fuck buddy paid you a visit?" He smirks and Harry rolls his eyes.
"That's hot." He groans before deciding to actually stop teasing Draco now. He grabs Dracos right hand in his left and moves it so its next to Dracos head so he can still lean on the bed and his other hand travels down Dracos body. He casts a silent, wandless charm, which totally turns Draco on, to cover his hand in lube before pressing a finger against Dracos hole and rubbing circles around it slowly. Draco gasps at the contact and leans into the touch which makes Harry smile. He kisses Draco as he pushes his index finger slowly inside Draco. Draco gasps into the kiss and Harry looks into Dracos eyes to make sure he's not in pain.
"Yeah, sounds about right." Harry admits and madam Pomfrey looks at him empathetically.
"Oh there you are Ron. Wait, what?" She asks, looking between Ron and Draco.
Okay this is just a short chapter but it's an update nonetheless! I am so sorry it's been like nearly 3 months, but I've just been having a real shitty time. I hope you're all staying safe and well, and I also hope you wont have to wait another 3 months for the next chapter, which will be all about the party!
Harry says the password, knowing Draco won't use it so he doesn't bother whispering, before leading a very apprehensive Draco through the hole in the wall. There's only first and second years in the common room when they enter as everyone is still in Hogsmeade. Most of them turn to see who has entered and when they see Draco a few look shocked.
"Good job Gryffindor, Slytherin, there's always next time." Harry teases as Gryffindor won 3 out of the 5 games they played.
"So you were both getting all worried and stressy over nothing?" Blaise points out and Harry laughs.
"Sirius, how are you, sweetheart?" The woman says, wrapping a towel around his shoulders before pulling him into a hug.
"What have you said to her?" He asks suspiciously and Harry smirks.
"Alright." He says, sitting on the bed opposite Draco. "First we're gonna start rumours of the people it could be, get the school more invested than they already are. Then we're gonna add fuel to the fire by making sure some first year or something sees us doing something not so friendly, but then another student could see us arguing or something so they start some sort of debate. Then we show everyone the truth by, i dunno, fucking in the great hall." Harry says and Draco raises an eyebrow and Harry rolls his eyes.
They enter the living room to see Harry curled into a ball, tears streaming down his face as he stares blankly at the wall. Draco's eyes soften and he immediately walks over to him.
They sit in silence for a while, Draco looking at Harry and Harry looking out of the window, neither of them saying anything but just basking in each other's company.
"How about a dragon?" Harry suggests and Draco thinks for a second before nodding.
"My mum was pregnant George." Harry says. He tells George everything, and keeping something like this from him is not going to happen.
"Nothing really, just, when are you finally going to get together? How will it happen?" Harry's silent for a second, and Blaise thinks maybe he's finally got through to him, but then Harry looks at him and his eyes are full of sadness.
"Missed having you around, you know." He whispers, and Harry throws him an apologetic smile. He knows Blaise worries about him.
"You're devious. You're evil. You're sarcastic. How were you not a slytherin?" Draco asks and Harry chuckles slightly.
"Well you didn't look great either." He mutters.
"Including mum and dad?" He asks and Harry's eyes widen.
His hands are shaking, and Blaise has noticed.
"Who else knows?" He asks and Harry bites his lip.
"Why Canis?"
"You're the worst person alive." He growls and Harry chuckles before pecking Draco and unbuttoning his shirt slowly, kissing down his chest as he reveals it and lets the shirt drop to the floor. He smirks at Draco, which makes him bite his lip, before dropping to his knees and slowly rubbing Draco through his trousers.
"I'll see you in the common room, Yeah?" Hermione asks and Harry nods before walking over to McGonagalls desk.
"Why was he there?" He asks and Harry looks at him with such an intense sorrow in his eyes that it breaks Draco's heart.
"This doesn't concern you, Zabini."
"Who did Mr. Weasley throw the curse at?"
"See you at lunch." He says and with a final squeeze of Harry's shoulder he walks back down the hallway to the classroom. As he enters the class turn to look at him, Ron looking pissed off, but Hermione looks gratefully at him. It doesn't seem like Binns even noticed that two of his students had left the room, and when Blaise sits back down Draco turns to him.
"What is it?" Ron asks concerned and Harry bites his lip.
"I like ice-cream." He jokes and Rhys chuckles.
"I'm not doing this in the hopes you give me something in return, Harry." Draco whispers, and it's mostly true. A part of him is still hoping that Harry will fall in love with him though.
"You're hot in general." Draco mumbles and Harry grins.
"Do you wanna talk?" Seamus asks as they walk and Harry shakes his head. He appreciates Seamus sitting with him in near silence for the last hour but he can't bring himself to talk about how he died or how he’s felt ever since.
"Lets just go to bed." Draco says quietly and Blaise nods. They both crawl into bed when an idea idea strikes Draco. He waits until Blaise is fast asleep before climbing out of bed quietly and grabbing Harry's book and a bit of parchment, before he writes a small note.
"I never meant to do that to you." Harry whispers, his voice cracking, and Draco's heart aches.
"She worries more when she doesn't hear from you." Harry says softly and Draco looks him in the eye. Harry slowly leans forward and kisses Draco softly and when he pulls back Draco's blushing like mad and has a really fucking adorable smile on his face.
"For a walk." Harry says as he shoves on his converse and grabs his hoodie, not bothering with a top.
"Anyway, what tattoo did you give him?" She changes the subject.
"Hermione and Ernie, Pansy and Anthony, Draco and Trevor, Ron and Theodore, Blaise and Harry..." Harry zones out after that. He's not exactly thrilled that he's paired with Blaise Zabini, but at least he won't talk to him and it's better than having to deal with his friends constant worried glances. When Professor Slughorn finishes listing the pairs everyone moves to sit with their partner. Blaise moves over to Harry's table once Seamus has moved, and he sets his bag down silently. Slughorn starts talking about the potion they need to make in this lesson and when he says they can start Blaise turns to Harry.
"Ah, brilliant! I must say, Harry, I am very impressed with your work this year. Your last essay was impeccable. I couldn't fault it. I hear your other professors agree with me." He says, sifting through some parchment on his desk before handing harry his last piece of homework which has
"Meet me on the quidditch pitch at midnight." Blaise says quietly and Harry nods just as he's called again.
"So you wanna drag it out?" Draco asks and Harry smirks.
As they walk down to their common room Blaise looks over at Draco and smiles slightly.
"Well usually I like a guy to buy me dinner first." Draco teases back and Harry smiles.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Not a close one." Harry says, and Draco laughs, moving up so he's hovering over Harry.
"I told Seamus." Harry says and Draco nods before noticing the way Seamus is looking between him and Harry and frowning slightly.
"Are you okay?" He asks quietly and Harry turns his head to look at Draco again.
"It's my pleasure, Harry. I'm glad I could help." He whispers back, not wanting to burst this peaceful bubble they're in. Harry pulls away slightly, Seamus' leg is still in between his but they can see each others face, and he glances at Seamus' neck before biting his lip.
"You not happy about it? Thought you hated being in the hospital wing?" Harry shrugs.
"Absolutely." Blaise says before they dismiss their teams and carry the chest back to the store cupboard.
"You need to be trained in it." She says.
"Sorry, Professor. I can come back later?" Harry says and McGonagall shakes her head.
"It's fine mother." Draco lets go of Harry's hand so he can kiss his mothers cheek. Harry thinks it's nice that they both seem a lot happier and less stressed without Lucius here.
”Believe me Harry, I know.” Draco says with a small smile, “But I still love you.” Harry finally lets himself believe it.
It's only 9pm, and as it's the first day everyone spends the night in the common room, so he isn't interrupted. Harry doesn't pay attention to how long he has been running for, as he always just keeps running until his legs start to feel numb and he knows he needs to stop. Harry stops running and checks his watch to see it's 10:30pm. Not his longest run but he's had a long day. He takes his t-shirt off and wipes his face with it as he makes his way back up to the Gryffindor common room, he's still covered in sweat and when he enters the common room and makes his way over to the stairs leading to his dorm he can feel people watching him. His body is littered with scars, as well as the big scar over his heart from the killing curse, but he's in good shape, and he doesn't know which one is the reason for the staring, so he just keeps his head down and continues walking until he's in his dorm. He grabs some new joggers and makes his way to the showers, and when he's clean he goes back to his dorm again. It's 11pm by this point so Harry sits in his bed and picks up the book McGonagall gave him and reads until his eyelids are so heavy he physically can't keep them open.
The same thing happens at lunch, only this time Draco notices. They all had a great time in Harrys room and Ron and Hermione get on well with Draco now. They're at lunch sat on their respective tables and Harry sees a slytherin boy around a year younger start talking with a hateful look on his face to Draco. Draco looks kind of taken aback and hurt so Harry feels anger at the seventh year bubbling inside him. Suddenly Dracos tattoo growls and starts to breath ink fire across Dracos forearm and the kid walks away quickly. Draco looks confused before looking up and his eyes meet Harrys. Draco must notice the angry but guilty look on Harrys face because he motions to the door and walks into the entrance hall. Harry follows shortly after, leaving Teddy with Hermione and Ron. When Draco sees Harry he grabs his hand and pulls him down the closest corridor and into an empty classroom.
"Hey, Ron?" Harry asks and he looks up from the quidditch book he was looking at.
At the end of the lesson Harry waits until the rest of the class have left before leaving the classroom. Blaise is waiting for him outside and he smiles when Harry leaves the room.
"She said you never blamed me. She said you don't think I deserve the curses people throw at me." Draco says and he smiles slightly when Harry mutters "I do now".
"Sure you don't wanna stay and watch?" He asks and Draco glares at him before blushing and walking back up to the castle.
"But, the attention-"
"He was hexed by some 6th year." He says and Harry frowns, he didn't know people were bullying Malfoy, but now that he does know he's going to make a point to shout at or hex anyone he sees hexing Malfoy.
After a few minutes or sitting and watching Draco sleep Harry accio's his Transfiguration textbook to him and he decides to do some of the reading they were set to do over the weekend, reading with one hand, balancing the book on the arm of the sofa, and continuing to stroke Dracos hair with the other hand.
"And that's why you need to eat." Draco mutters and Harry rolls his eyes as they reach the bottom of the staircase. The common room is empty except for a few students who pay Harry and Draco no attention as the two leave through the portrait hole. Harry doesn't want to face anyone at the moment so he just makes his way to the kitchen after saying goodbye to Draco. He's not hungry, so he sits in the kitchen for a while before leaving, the food Winky put on his plate untouched, and he makes his way to herbology.
He shut himself off during the summer after the war, living at Grimmauld place alone and not talking to anyone. He told no one that he died during the war. He doesn't want to talk about it, or think about it. Only two people kind of know he died and that's Hagrid and Narcissa, because they were both there. He also really doesn't want to see anyone, which is why he refused the offer to stay at the burrow over the summer before 8th year. He feels so damn guilty all the time, and seeing Ron and George and Mrs. Weasley makes him feel worse. He's spent two months alone in agonising guilt and sorrow. He spent the first few weeks working on the house, making it feel homely and he's proud of the outcome, but he's done nothing but read, draw, play Sirius' guitar and exercise since then. The only things he could do that kept his mind occupied, because when he isn't doing things the guilt starts to creep in and quickly becomes overwhelming. This all ends today though. It's September 1st and Harry is going back to Hogwarts for the last time. His trunk is packed with everything he needs, including his broom and Sirius' guitar, and is by his front door ready for him. Kingsley is his chauffeur for today, and when he gets to Grimmauld place Harry sighs before leaving the house with him, locking the door behind him.
Hufflepuff beat Ravenclaw 240 - 90 and then Harry, Ron, Hermione, Seamus and Dean go to lunch before their DADA class. Harry knows he's the best at DADA and as they're learning about what a patronus is for he kind of zones out, allowing the guilt to consume him for the first time in a while. His mind goes to Sirius and the time he saved him from having the dementors kiss and he sighs, staring out the window at the students on a free period sitting in the sun, some reading, some laughing, some sun bathing, some chatting. Harry remembers the memory he watched the other day of his dad, Sirius and Remus sitting under a tree chatting and laughing and being so happy and so care-free.
"They loved you, you know. Still do." Draco says and he's not sure if it was the right thing or not but then Harry is wrapping his arm around him and pressing a kiss to Draco's hair.
admitting it.
"So what are you gonna do when I get out of here?" Billy asks and Harry chuckles.
"Technically ran away in third year. Thought I was gonna be expelled from here cause I used magic at home, blew up my uncles sister, so I packed up my stuff and left."
"Are you okay?" Draco asks and Harry shakes his head.
"I know you didn't, love." Harry whispers and Draco shuts his eyes and leans his forehead against Harrys.
"Well your mum saved me."
"Are you okay?" Draco nods.
"He thought it was just a bit of parchment. You need a specific spell to activate the map, and there's a different spell that deactivates it, otherwise anyone could read it."
"But- It's like I'm not a person. I was only alive for the purpose of ending the war. Of ending Voldemort. Dumbledore said himself, I was raised so I could die. I was never expected to survive. I was never meant to survive. I was raised like a pig for slaughter. As long as I did what I was meant to no one cared that I was meant to die as I did it. No one cared that I was only 17, or if it hurt, or if I was alone, or if I was scared, or if I didn't want to die. I was merely a weapon to end the war, or die trying. My only purpose was to defeat Voldemort. And I did that, and I died but then I survived even though I shouldn't have. I don't have a purpose anymore, and I'm living on stolen time, time that shouldn't be mine, time that no one thought I'd have. And I'm just so tired. And maybe what's dead should stay dead." There are tears falling rapidly now, and Draco almost can't believe what he's hearing. He's grabbing Harry in a hug before he can even comprehend what he's doing, and Harry is shaking against his chest. Draco places a hand on the back on Harry's head, playing with the hair at the nape of his neck, trying to calm him down.
"What exactly is the map of?" He asks.
"Oh, er, quidditch." Harry says, shooting Hermione a look that tells her not to tell Ron about Draco.
"Yeah." He lies, and Draco knows he's lying, and he wishes Harry would just
Hello you lovely people, quick question for ya, how many chapters/how long should I make this? Like I can make it slow burn af or I can end it in 5 chapters but idk what you would want to read??
"Who did it?" Draco asks and Harry looks at him for a second. Everyone else would ask what or where it is, not who did it.
"I need to ask Professor Flitwick a question. I'll see you at dinner Harry. Bye Malfoy." She says, looking at Malfoy and nodding towards Harry, making sure he get's what she means, before grabbing her stuff and leaving.
“Granger fuck off I’m asleep.” He mumbles and Hermione rolls her eyes.
"Draco, is everything okay?" Draco looks up from his plate with a frown.
"Second? Who the fuck is first?" He asks and Harry chuckles.
"So will you be, one day." He says and Dracos eyes widen.
"Oh so I'm Potter again? I see how it is." He jokes and Draco rolls his eyes.
"Draco there is no need to be jealous. I haven't slept with him in a long time." Harry says, but Draco is looking at the bed post.
Harry walks over and sits in his usual seat next to Seamus and Draco goes and sits next to Pansy just as the bell rings.
"Not really." Harry breaths and the hand stops moving, as if Draco's noticed he's still doing it. Harry whimpers and moves his head, trying to tell Draco not to stop. It seems to work because he starts moving the hand again.
"And you, Mister Standing, will need to drink all of this potion, not just some of it, if you want to get better." Madam Pomfrey says and Billy stop laughing immediately. Harry chuckles slightly and Billy glares at him.
"How do you- why?"
“Harry, they still abused you.” He says and Harry shakes his head.
"You wanna nap?" Draco asks as they leave the hall, and Harry shakes his head. He's got work to do. He tells Draco as much, so they grab their things and make their way to the library, where they settle in the back corner and start their potions essays.
"I need more ink and maybe a new quill." Hermione says, taking a sip of her drink, meanwhile Draco is staring to feel awkward. He can see people look over at him every so often and he really just wants to go back to Hogwarts because this is the exact reason he doesn't come to Hogsmeade anymore; he hates the staring and the glares and the mutters.
He's looking at a perfect drawing of him. Every single detail is perfect and if Draco wasn't physically holding it he would think it was a black and white picture. Draco turns the page with bated breath, and almost chokes when he sees another picture of himself. The more he flips through the book the more his feeling of love for the boy on his lap grows. Not every picture is of him, but most of them are, and every one is beautiful. Draco closes the book and puts it back before looking down at Harry again, wondering how long he's been drawing him. The first picture must have been from before summer because there were a couple of drawings of the castle after the war. Draco just looks back down at Harry and starts threading his fingers through his hair again. He would do anything to make Harry okay again, but for now he's hoping this is at least keeping nightmares at bay.
"Mister Potter sir." Winky says in shock as Harry enters and he smiles slightly at her as he walks over to the sink.
"Luckily I'm not dating Voldemort. And they're just gonna have to accept the fact that I love you." Draco's eyes light up as a blush spreads across his cheeks.
"He was accused of telling Voldemort where my parents were hiding. People thought he was their secret keeper but it wasn't him." Harry says before sighing. "I never thanked you Malfoy. For saving me that night at Malfoy Manor."
"Yo!" Dean shouts, after a nod from Harry, and the Gryffindors automatically stop talking and look at Harry. Harry tries to ignore the stands, which are full of around 50 students, and clears his throat. He hasn't spoken to this many people in a while. He catches Ginny's eye, of course she's trying out, and she smiles encouragingly at him.
"Bit boring. Weasleys still not keen on us apparently." Blaise says and Harry sighs.
saved
"It's like, everyone expects me to be an auror because of the whole Voldemort thing but I don't wanna deal with that anymore. I'd get to do what I love for a living. You know, you should become the potions teacher then we could be like that teacher couple that all the students ship." Harry smirks and Draco frowns.
Draco and Harry lie together quietly until dinner, just Draco occasionally whispering reassurance and Harry pulling Draco's arms impossibly further round him. When it's time for dinner Harry reluctantly let's go of Draco's hands and slowly sits up. Draco looks up at him and feels his heart flutter. Harry's hair is even messier than usual and he looks adorable despite his red puffy eyes. Harry's hair looks so soft and Draco wishes he could run his fingers through it, but he just shakes that thought away and gets up, smoothing down his hair and going down to the great hall.
"Different passageway." He says before biting his lip and starting to turn around, but Draco squeezes his hand and stops him.
"Do you know who's winning the poll?" Harry asks and Dean and Seamus turn around from the bench in front of him.
"I love how you can go from being a confident, arrogant prick to being a blushing, adorable mess." Harry says softly and Draco looks down at the ground below the bridge, willing his blush to go away.
"You're not gonna watch?" Blaise asks.
"Oh, young one, you have so much to learn." Harry says before whispering
"Wolves hunt Stags Harry." She says and Harrys eyes widen.
"Welcome back everyone, and welcome to the first years. We will shortly be handing out your timetables, but before we do, I want to say a very big well done for the people in this hall who returned after the events that occurred here, we are very proud of you all. Secondly, to the first years, I hope your time here is only full of learning and happiness. Head boy and Head Girl will be decided by the end of the week, and last, but most important. Quidditch. Those of you that want to try out for your teams, speak to your head of house by the end of the week. Okay, I won't bore you any longer, we will now pass out your timetables." She finishes before walking straight over to Harry.
"Cause it's the first one?" Harry shrugs, sitting up.
"It would be funny. I thought you were adamant about not going?"
"Okay then. If you are sure." She says and when Harry nods she sighs but nods.
"Couldn't be bothered to get up and come get you." He mutters and Blaise rolls his eyes, jumping onto Harrys bed to lie next to him. Harry shifts over to make room and Blaise looks at him.
"For Ravenclaw, Jamie Dorling, Hufflepuff captain is Tara Freeman. Slytherin captain is Blaise Zabini, and Gryffindor captain is Harry Potter. I ask you go to your head of houses to sign up, and not the captains. I repeat, if you try to sign up by going straight to the captain you will not be allowed to tryout or be accepted onto the team." The second McGonagall stops talking people start talking excitedly again. Harry's friends look at him, a mixture of surprise and concern on their faces. Harry forgot that he didn't tell them about being captain. He just shrugs one shoulder and the second they are dismissed he makes his way to the library.
"Stay as long as you want, son." He says and Sirius thanks him before James grabs his bag again and leads Sirius up to his room.
He follows her up to the headmasters office in silence and sits down when she gestures to the chair opposite hers.
"Professor." He knows she's mad at him so he doesn't try and call her anything else.
When the three of them get to the quad Harry's eyes widen when he sees three Slytherins and Ron, Seamus and Dean in a fight. Harry quickly casts a spell that wraps invisible ropes around each of their stomachs and pulls them apart from each other and they're all so surprised by the sudden interruption that they don't even struggle.
"Yeah, I just got distracted. Sorry love." Harry says, starting to walk down to the kitchen, and Draco frowns slightly but walks with him, squeezing his hand.
"He'd never do that." Harry is stood outside his dorm room, listening. He heard voices coming from inside and decided to listen to what his 'friends' are saying.
"You're welcome."
"I knew something would happen when I left your room and you were lying on his lap. Tell me what happened?" She asks and Harry chuckles, explaining how their kiss happened and their conversation after it, gushing about how cute Draco is.
"No. No it's okay." Harry says automatically.
"You know, the dragon was for you too." Harry says as they rest their foreheads against each other.
First update of the new year and IT'S HERE!!! THE MOMENT IS FINALLY HERE! IT HAPPENED, THIS IS NOT A DRILL, I REPEAT THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!
"Beginning of second year?" He mumbles, sitting on the edge of the bed that Madam Pomfrey gestures to. She gives him a stern look and he shrinks under her gaze.
"Sorry Finnegan, but I'm no longer available." Harry smirks before sitting back in his seat. Nothing would have happened between them anyway, I mean they flirt shamelessly all the time but only on the very rare occasion does anything actually happen and most of the time the flirting's harmless.
"Can you go tell him I need to talk to him?"
"Okay so I was unorganised-" He is cut off by Hermione saying "shocker" sarcastically and he rolls his eyes.
"Yeah you are." Pansy says, looking concerned, and Draco sighs. He knows he can tell them the truth, and he knows he needs to tell Blaise anyway because Harry is in their dorm room, but for some reason he feels like he shouldn't, or doesn't want to.
"He hasn't slept in almost a week, so I don't think so."
"Finally!" He smiles, pulling Harry into a hug before turning to Draco. "Guess you're one of us now." He says, offering him a hand. Draco looks at him in shock for a minute before smiling and shaking Rons hand.
"What ya doin?" Harry asks and Hermione rolls her eyes at him.
"I think so." He says before sighing.
"Harry, you really think Malfoy would behave like that unless he had some sort of feelings besides hate for you?" She says and Harry frowns.
"This another one of your hidden passageways?" He asks and Harry smiles slightly but doesn't answer, instead gripping Draco's hand and leading him down the tunnel and into the living room of the shrieking shack.
"You know my handwriting?"
“Harry please don’t be upset. And I’m sorry, but you were.” He says sadly and Harry sits up, tears rolling down his cheeks.
"So you got a new tattoo?" Ron asks and Harry nods, sitting Teddy back on his lap.
"What do you mean?"
"No, Hermione. I'm mad because you told him things I told you not to tell anyone. Why did you tell him I live in constant guilt? You told him I wish Voldemort had succeeded? You're the only one that knows that for a reason, Mione." Harry says and Hermione frowns.
(But not that great cause believe it or not I'm not good at writing smut)
"So how are you and lover boy doing?" Pansy asks as Draco sits down and he blushes involuntarily, watching as Harry walks up to the teachers table. His arse looks great in those jeans and his arm muscles are prominent.
"You go on runs a lot?" She asks, looking at him in concern. Harry just shrugs again.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Thanks Georgie. You think he'll come round?"
"You will continue to be 'stuck here', Mister Potter, until you learn that eating and sleeping are basic requirements for those whom want to stay alive." She says as she walks over to the Ravenclaw, who laughs. Harry rolls his eyes.
"You sleep okay?" Draco whispers and Harry nods, squeezing Draco's side softly.
"I know, love. I'm terrible." Harry says and Draco nods.
"I had breakfast." He says and she smiles.
"Harry?" Hermione asks as she opens the door, before she looks at Harry lying on Dracos lap and Ron at the end of his bed.
"You're really okay with everyone seeing them?" Ron whispers as the class starts and Harry nods.
"Harry, you're clueless." She says and Harry frowns in confusion.
"I do." Harry says, walking back over to the sofa, wondering why Draco cares
"I know, but I'm not hungry. Please Winky." Harry pleads and when Winky reluctantly nods Harry smiles slightly.
"Yeah, he's okay now." Harry says and George smirks again.
"Is he asleep?" He asks, almost as if he doesn't quite believe it. Draco looks between Blaise and Pansy before looking back at Seamus, his hands still moving softly across Harry. He's expecting him to flip out at the fact that they are with Harry, but Seamus isn't holding a wand and he probably wouldn't try anything in the library.
"I'm sorry."
"You sure you wanna go to class?" Draco asks and Harry nods against his shoulder.
"OH MY GOD." Pansy gasps and Draco turns to her.
"I also almost killed you."
"Can't do what, sweetheart?"
"And then he was all 'well I think we should break up then' and I was like 'fucking finally' cause you know I've wanted him to break up with me for like 5 weeks." Pansy says and Draco rolls his eyes.
Harry disappears just after Herbology. Draco and Blaise look for him, but when they can't find him they decide to go to their next class and hope he turns up soon. Harry walks around, finding himself outside of a classroom full of students currently being taught by Professor McGonagall. She catches his eye before frowning in concern before addressing the class of first years.
"Yeah." Harry raises an eyebrow and Draco sighs. "Just don't like Davies." He mutters and Harry nods.
"You okay?" Harry asks. He finished his essay around 10 minutes ago and has been reading the next chapter of his textbook again.
"She felt sorry for you cause you had a shit life no offence and you were forced to fight from a young age against an evil wizard and you had no choice and you were pretty much forced to sacrifice yourself. When you spoke for us at our trial she saw how much the war affected you, cause lets be honest Harry you looked like shit after the war." Draco says and Harry smiles slightly.
Hermione walks into the library when the guys are finished practicing and sits in the back corner that she knows Harry sits in. She lets Teddy sit on the table to her left and play with his bear whilst she starts her potions essay. Hermione looks up when someone clears their throat and sees Malfoy stood in front of her on the other side of the table.
"You're hot too, love." Harry squeezes Draco's hip, and Draco grins.
"Er, I'm not sure. It was left with my stuff in the library." Harry says and McGonagall raises an eyebrow. It looks familiar, she just doesn't know where from. She glances round the hall before she notices Draco looking at Harry and she immediately remembers seeing Draco reading the book during a transfiguration class last year.
"No." Draco denies, but the bright red flush spreading across his face tells Harry he's right. Harry just grins knowingly and Draco sighs. "Okay yes. Shut up about it." He mutters, turning his face away, and Harry smiles brightly, pulling Draco closer to him with a tug at his hand. He reaches up, dropping his broom on the floor to free his hand, and brushes Draco's cheek.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Great." He says, smiling slightly.
”Oh come on! I’ll do Blaise’s hair, Harry can do Draco.” She says and both boys blush at the innuendo. Pansy chuckles as she sits on the sofa, Blaise laughing as he sits on the floor in front of her. Draco hesitates before sitting on the floor in front of Harry. Dracos hair isn’t exactly short, but it’s considerably shorter than Harry’s, so he’s not too sure what to do. Draco tries his best to keep his breathing even, but having Harry's fingers threading through his hair is both relaxing him and turning him on, especially when he tugs slightly. Harry pulls the hair back, hands soft and comforting, before deciding Dracos hair is just slightly too short to be put in a bun or ponytail, so he runs his hands through the hair to erase the parting before making a thin french braid on either side, bringing them both back until they meet in the middle, where he ties them off.
"And Poppy told you about PTSD?" Harry nods.
"Do you want to?" He asks and Harry shakes his head slowly.
As long as he has Draco he doesn't mind if they are disgustingly cringey or hopeless, he waited long enough to get Draco and he isn't going to give up showing how much he loves him now.
"Go and get some rest, Potter. I'll give you a week to think it over, but I'll try and think of someone else just in case you really don't want to."
"Okay Potter. We'll talk about it more later. Finish your dinner."
“James, I’m pregnant.” Lily says, holding up a pregnancy test. James’ face holds a look of shocked joy but Remus jumps up to pull her into a hug and Sirius grins, wrapping his arm around James. Harry frowns at James’ reaction, but only for a second because then James is wiping a tear from his eyes and rushing to wrap his arms around Lily.
"Did Ron wake you up?"
"Are you okay?" Harry sighs, squeezing his eyes shut tight.
During the rest of breakfast things go surprisingly normal, all things considered, and as they leave to go out and sit by the lake during their free period, Harry holding Teddy on his hip and Hermione playing with him with a teddy bear McGonagall gave him, Harry finds himself actually quite excited. He never really gets to spend time with his godson and even though he's only 18 he loves Teddy like he's his own, just like how Sirius loved Harry like he was his own. Besides, Harry owes it to Remus. He did so much for him and the fact that he actually entrusted him with helping raise his own son means so much.
"Out of curiosity, what memory did you pick?" Harry asks and Draco realises he doesn't really want to tell him what he actually picked so he makes one up.
"I was just wondering if I could ask you about what we did in DADA today." He says, uncharacteristically nice, and Granger looks taken aback for a second before she composes herself.
"It's harder. I've met my parents a couple of times and I miss them a lot. But I spent a year and a half talking to Sirius and I lived with him over Christmas. I actually knew him, and I had no one to talk about him to because my aunt and uncle didn't care, and it sucks that I don't know my parents but that makes them not being here easier. I was there when Sirius died. He died because of me. And I couldn't do anything to stop it." Harry says, staring at the wall.
"He knows we're dorm mates. He also knows we've slept in the same bed every night for 2 weeks." Harry says and Draco's eyes widen.
"I don't think Harry's here." She says and Ron wonders how many people know Harry sleeps here and if they think there's more to it than that.
"It was okay."
"Thank you, Harry sir."
"Well you're not wrong, you definitely did. It's a shame you'll never know." Harry chuckles before looking over at Draco and catching his eye before motioning for Draco to come over. When Draco reaches the two boys Harry places his hand on the small of Dracos back as there's no one around.
"Going back to my dorm. Going out with the team tomorrow. Ron and Hermione and Seamus and Dean..." Harry pauses, blushing slightly. "Malfoy." He admits and Blaise smiles slightly.
"Well you're gonna have to make the first move because there's no way Malfoy is brave enough to do so." She says.
"W-what about me?" He stutters and he's so adorable that Harry's heart skips.
"I do not think it's a good idea for you to see Mister Potter at this moment in time." She says and Harry frowns, sitting up slightly. He hears Rons voice and silently, wandlessly pulls the curtain so they can't see him. Harry can tell that McGonagall is having a hard time telling them to leave so he uses legilimency to tell her that he won't cope if he sees them. It was a mistake, he knows, using silent, wandless magic and legilimency, because his head is spinning and Blaise reaches out to steady him.
"Of course, Potter. You're a menace." He says and Harry chuckles.
"He obviously doesn't mind it, Harry." Harry sighs, his eyes moving to the ground below the bridge.
"There are 7, actually. But third year. Fred and George had a map that my dad and his friends made and it shows the secret passageways." Harry says, proud of his dad and Sirius and Remus for being more mischievous than the Weasley twins.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Mother this is my boyfriend, Harry Potter." Draco says, blushing as he says it, and Harry can't help but smile at him.
Dracos gaze follows Potter as he walks into the hall and sits down, and he can't help but glare when Finnegan leans close to him. He’s been doing that a lot lately and Draco does not like it.
"Alright losers lets play." He grins and Harry rolls his eyes, mounting his broom and kicking off.
"You know, it's not smart to argue with someone that could kill you in your sleep." Harry chuckles, rolling them so he's on top, and pressing a kiss to Draco's lips.
"I never hated you. Well, not really." Draco says and Harry raises an eyebrow.
"So where does this one lead?" Draco asks, sensing Harry doesn't want to talk about his parents in a dark and dirty tunnel.
"Sorry guys. We can all go get ice-cream next weekend." Harry says and both of the boys smile.
"I'm joking babe." He says, leaning close so his lips are almost touching Dracos. "There's no way I'm sharing you." Harry murmurs against his lips and Draco wraps his arms around Harry's waist as he presses their lips together.
"I almost killed you." Harry mutters, leaning back up to look Draco in the eye, hovering above his face.
“Yeah?” He asks.
"I don't know what I'm doing." He sighs and she grips his shoulder and squeezes it tight.
"You don't like my hair up?" Harry teases and Draco rolls his eyes.
"I would love that! When can we start?" He asks, not even trying to mask his excitement.
"I- It's- I." He stutters and Harry grins cheekily.
"Ah you're back!" Narcissa puts her book down on the table and stands up, walking over to them. "I was going to meet you in the entrance hall." Draco smiles.
"After you're finished we can save the rest for tomorrow. It was delicious, Kreacher."
"We have got to stop this!" Dean mutters and Hermione sighs.
"I don't know what you mean..." Ron says slowly, not really wanting to tell Seamus about Malfoy.
"I don't have many happy memories, Potter." He says truthfully.
"I did, I just- still don't know how I feel about Dean. Neville's harmless and Ron is okay and I guess Seamus is too but I still don't wanna be in a room with them. Not after-" Harry cuts himself off, putting his fork down.
"'Arry! Come in!" Harry smiles when Hagrid pulls him into a bone-crushing hug before he sits at the table.
"Not really." He says and Blaise is shocked for a second, having been expecting a lie, before recovering.
"Yeah?" He sounds like he doesn't believe him at all and it breaks Blaise's heart.
...or am I??
"Morning." He whispers and Harry blinks before his eyes focus on Draco and he smiles sleepily.
"Harry we were worried about you! What have you been doing?" She asks and Harry, who is warming up nicely, gestures to himself, briefly waving his hand at his body.
"Someone call the daily prophet! It will make the front page." She joins in and Harry rolls his eyes.
"Yesterday morning." Draco says and Harry continues.
"The first time I rode a broom." He says and Harry smiles.
"Yeah."
"Maybe a little bit?"
"Come on, pick a different memory." Harry says, pulling Draco off the sofa and he sighs.
"And?" Narcissa is all but grinning, and Draco can already see she's excited for him.
"I'm going to collect your homework, and then you are free to go." Professor Slughorn says and Harry sighs when he starts walking round each table, collecting rolls of parchment from the students. When he gets to Harry he frowns, noticing there is nothing on Harry's desk.
"Pomfrey wouldn't tell us who visited you yesterday." Blaise says softly and Harry nods.
"Me?" The kid asks and Harry nods, walking towards the girl.
Harry shifts his head slightly, burying his face deeper into his elbow as a small, quiet whimper escapes his lips. Draco bites his lip before an idea hits him. He only hesitates until Harry whimpers quietly again, before placing his right hand on Harry's back, drawing patters lightly over the soft t-shirt, his left hand not stopping it's movement through his hair. Harry stops whimpering and relaxes slightly, and Draco releases a breath he didn't realise he was holding as he continues running his fingers lightly across Harry's spine.
"I don't understand what we're doing. Every night we fall asleep together and we're closer than two people who supposedly hate each other should be and I love it but he also frustrates me to no end and we piss each other off daily. I don't understand how we can go from one extreme to the other." Harry sighs whilst Hermione smiles slightly.
"Potter?" He asks quietly, almost hoping he doesn't hear him. Harry looks up from his parchment and his eyes meet Draco's and Draco feels those fluttery things in his stomach again.
"Fine." He says, exasperated, before getting down and standing next to Draco.
"What, I need a reason to hug my boyfriend?" He mutters against Harrys neck and Harry can feel Dracos face burning red as if he's blushing. It takes Harry a few seconds of wondering why Draco is suddenly affectionate and embarrassed before he clocks.
"Whats up?" Harry asks, looking at McGonagall.
"Er, nothing. Forget I said anything." He says quickly and Blaise raises an eyebrow at him.
"Thank you Harry. Where did that one come from? It looks like an original copy." She says and Harry raises an eyebrow.
"Who-"
"It's nothing, love." He's hoping Draco drops it, but he also knows how bloody stubborn he is.
"So who did you think of?" He asks and Draco gives his trademark smirk.
Granger could not be more obvious in her intentions as she motioned at Potter before leaving him and Draco. Draco sighs; he knows Granger isn't the type of person who would lie, especially about something serious, so he believed her when she said Potter forgave him. This doesn't, however, make talking to him any easier. And now he knows Harry has a tattoo he really wishes he knew what it was. After a few minutes of silently writing he bites his lip and looks up at Potter, deciding if he doesn't do it now, and fast, he'll chicken out.
"Cause it wasn't just cause he was asleep, was it?"
"So when's first practice?" Ginny asks as soon as Harry sits down opposite her and he shrugs.
"You're pretty." He says and Draco glares at him.
"You okay?" Harry asks quietly and Draco almost laughs because he should be the one asking Harry that.
"You can't just say shit like that and walk off." He growls in Harrys ear and Harry fights to suppress a smirk, instead turning round to face Draco and feigning innocence.
"Where you been?" Harry shrugs.
"So Slughorn said."
"I love you," Harry starts, and it still baffles them how they can say that now, "But loving people hurts, and I'm scared you're gonna leave, or something's gonna happen to you," Harry takes a shaky breath in, "I don't think I'd survive that."
"I need to tell you something." He says and Draco stops leaning and stands up straight.
Sorry for making you wait so long and thank you for the lovely comments <3
"I know. Now the question is are they gonna admit it to each other..." Ron sighs.
"Why?" He asks, turning his body towards Harry but keeping their little fingers connected.
"You." He admits and a blush paints itself across Draco's cheeks and his eyes widen a fraction and his hand pauses for a second before continuing it's movements.
”Draco are you seriously still talking about Potter?”
"Trust you to know about a secret passageway." Draco says, secretly loving it, and Harry pulls him into the passageway.
"And when I'm with you." He says after a few seconds, sounding a lot more confident than he expected he would. Dracos hand pauses in his hair for a split second before Harry feels him relax slightly against the headboard and his fingers continue threading through Harry's hair.
"Oh so you get quidditch and we get who knows what that is in that forest?" He asks and Dean sighs, grabbing his hand and pulling him towards the forest, Luna following behind them.
"I thought you trusted me?" Harry says, smirking slightly, and Draco raises an eyebrow.
"You can, you know." He says softly, and Harry frowns, looking down at him, having previously been staring out the window.
"Stop thinking of others Harry."
"It's because you're hot, Harry." Blaise says and Harry laughs quietly when Draco glares at him.
"C'mon. We're gonna be late for dinner." Draco knows Harry probably wont eat, but the fact that he's the one to suggest going to a meal makes Draco turn immediately to start walking to the hall, hand linked with Harry's.
"What's up?" She asks as they start walking along side the lake.
"Just say it!" He says and Draco blushes and Harry glances over at him before rolling his eyes, a sappy smile on his face, and turning back to Blaise.
"I'm okay." Harry says and Blaise frowns.
"I did wonder how you always seemed to know where I was." He says and Harry shrugs.
"I'm sorry, Harry. He asked me about our DADA work because he was distracted and didn't take notes and I said you're the best at that class but you've been distracted too, when I finished explaining the work he asked if I was okay and then he asked what's wrong with you and I didn't mean to tell him everything but I'm so worried about you and you're roommates and I figured if he knew he could keep an eye on you for me but I just kept talking and I told him more than I intended to." She rambles and Harry bites his lip. He knows it's not Hermione's fault.
"Shut up, Billy." He says to the kid, not really meaning it in a harsh way.
"Why would Malfoy curse a Slytherin?" He asks, letting go of Harrys arm.
"It really is extraordinary magic." Draco tells Harry and he blushes slightly before smiling.
"You love Quidditch."
Harry reluctantly walks into the great hall after 40 minutes of running. He doesn't know what to expect when he enters, so he pauses in the doorway. He sees Ron looking at him expectantly and then Rhys waves him over and he glances at the Slytherin table to see Blaise watching him carefully. Harry takes a deep breath before deciding he can't deal with this. He doesn't enter the hall, instead walking to the kitchen. He knows McGonagall will be mad if he doesn't eat and he figures eating in the kitchen again will be okay. He knows she saw him and he hopes she realises he's going to the kitchen and not skipping the meal.
Harry spends most of his time over the next 2 weeks either in the library or on the quidditch pitch, when he's not zoned out in a lesson. He only goes to the hall for meals a couple of times a week and he goes on 2 or 3 runs a day. He walks into potions on Friday afternoon and sits in the back corner, next to Seamus, and sighs. He hasn't eaten in two days and he is so tired because he hasn't slept in ages either.
"Potter, I believe this is yours." She says, handing him Teddy and he sits him on him lap before looking up at the headteacher confused.
"You're all free to go." Slughorn says when he gets back to the front of the classroom. Harry sighs and picks his bag up, making sure to take his time. When the class is pretty much empty Harry stands up and takes his essay out of his bag. He walks over to Slughorn and holds it out to him.
"The sorting hat was going to put me in slytherin. I asked it not to." He says.
"I-" He trails off and Harry nods, leaning back against the headboard.
"But you talk outside of potions." Ron says and Harry really doesn't know what he's getting at.
"No wonder he hates us." Ron mutters and Hermione leans her head on his shoulder.
Harry spends an hour and a half, at most, at the party before starting to feel guilty again, so he slips out of the room of requirement, goes down a fairly unused corridor, and sits at the bottom of the spiral staircase. Within a few minutes he feels someone sit next to him and can tell who it is without even having to look up.
Around 15 minutes after Seamus sat down Harry sees something being pushed across the table towards him, and he glances up to see a box of mini chocolate wands. He looks up at Seamus who nods to the box, leaving it half way between the two of them. He takes one before going back to his textbook, and Harry hesitates for a second before taking one too and going back to his essay.
"But it makes you blush and that's cute." Harry says, reaching down to his hips and grabbing Dracos hands.
"How have you been today?"
“I never thought about it. But, I guess you’re right.” He says softly, staring into Draco’s beautiful gray eyes.
"Well, yeah."
"No. You're cute." Draco blushes and envies how Harry can just say shit like that without so much as blushing.
"So are you, thats the problem." Draco pouts and Harry chuckles.
"How'd you know?" Ron raises an eyebrow.
"Can't help it, Harry. My mind does what it wants." He smirks and Draco looks at Harry.
"Why?" He asks and Harry rolls his eyes.
"What?"
"Harry is something wrong?" She asks and Harry's gaze automatically snaps to the blond haired Slytherin across the hall.
"YO!" Dean calls out and the hall goes quiet as everyone turns their attention to Seamus and Dean.
"No thank you, sorry Kreacher, just a bit nervous." Harry presses his lips together, his mouth suddenly feeling very dry so he walks into the kitchen to get a glass of water. He's met Narcissa before, and Draco said she was happy for them, so why is he so bloody nervous? He hears Kreacher greeting Draco and takes a shaky breath before turning around and making his way back to the living room. He can't help but smile when he sees Draco, and when Draco turns to look at Harry a smile spreads across his face too.
"Alright, I'll go check with Lizzie and the others and I'll let you know at some point what time it will be." Harry says.
"Went for a run. I ate in the kitchen, ask Winky." Harry mutters and Hermione looks at him for a second before deciding against arguing.
"You need to attend meals tomorrow, but yes, you may go." Harry smiles slightly with relief.
"I said we should make our way to the kitchen." Draco says, eyes concerned, and Harry smiles slightly.
"Bring this one and we can have some fun." George winks at Draco before turning around and leaving, shutting the door behind him.
"I'm not too sure. Feel dizzy." He mumbles and she frowns.
"Really?"
"What do you wanna do?" Harry asks Draco, knowing the trip to hogsmeade probably didn't have the best affect on Draco and he probably doesn't want to do much.
"We'd still get weird looks." Draco mutters.
"Did you get any sleep last night?" Draco asks, voice quiet like he doesn't think he should be asking the question, and Harry shifts his gaze from the window to Draco.
"Such as?"
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you."
"Yeah. Yeah okay. Thanks, Kreacher." Harry reluctantly walks down the stairs and apparates to the Manor. He appears just outside the front door, and knocks quietly.
"I feel so betrayed!" He says and Billy laughs at his over-exaggeration again. "This is an appetite boosting potion! Madam Pomfrey I am shocked!" He gasps dramatically meanwhile Blaise and Draco are shocked an impressed that Harry can identify a potion by smelling it.
"It's okay to be jealous babe, you're cute when you're like this. If you're gonna be like this whenever you're jealous I'll make it happen more often." Harry smirks and Draco lifts his head and looks him in the eye with a warning look.
”I wanna paint your nails now.” Pansy says with a mischievous grin a while later, and Harry raises an eyebrow. He’s been involved in Hermione and Ginny’s makeover sessions one too many times to know that, according to both of them, he looks hot as fuck when he has his nails painted, and the one time he gave in and let them do his makeup they said he was the hottest guy they’ve seen, so this could end one of two ways.
"You okay?" Blaise asks and Harry nods. Blaise hesitates for a second before nodding, and him, Draco and Pansy leave the hospital wing. Harry knows they're waiting just outside the door, which makes him feel a bit better.
"Hi Harry. Malfoy." Ron says and Harry smiles back.
"I had people asking me too, cause 'you dorm with him you must know who it is.' apparently people don't care if I have a dark mark as long as I let them know who you're fucking." Draco says and Harry pushes himself up so he's lying on his front resting on his forearms.
"No thank you, I'm fine." He says quietly and Madam Pomfrey frowns before she turns around and quickly walks over to Malfoy when she sees him, helping him sit on a bed, and Harry decides he should probably leave them to it. He about to walk out when Madam Pomfrey calls him.
"Because you're Harry Potter. The chosen one. The saviour of the wizarding world. Plus they all want to fuck you and if you're no longer available they've lost their chance." Draco explains and Harry rolls his eyes.
"If he's with Zabini again-" He cuts himself off and everyone jumps up and runs to the window.
"Anyways, I was gonna come up with this cool or epic way to tell you all, not that it's really any of your business, although I have enjoyed seeing who you think I'm dating." Harry says, patting Seamus on the back which makes him roll his eyes.
"You wanna go to a pure-blood-centric posh as fuck Christmas party?"
Harry is still awake. It's nearly 6am now and Harry is still awake. He's still holding Draco's hand and side, and Draco is fast asleep. He's been asleep for half an hour, but Harry can't seem to sleep. He's not scared about nightmares, he's just still thinking about what Draco said. Harry is part of his life. A permanent part or just until school ends? And even if he's going to see him often he wont be able to see him every night, so Harry will still have to miss sleep. There's no possible way Harry can sleep with Draco every night. Nothing he can do to ensure Draco stays with him. Harry studies Draco's features, the sharp jawline, his cheekbones, the way his blonde eyelashes brush his cheeks, the way his lips look so soft. Harry almost can't believe he's lying next to him. For the first 7 years of them knowing each other Draco and Harry were never anything other than enemies, and here they are, at 6am in the shrieking shack, Draco fast asleep and angelic and
"Harry sir, it is time to go." Kreacher says, and Harry grimaces. This was such a bad idea.
"13 year old me jerked off to everything." He says.
"Professor McGonagall and I have agreed you are now allowed to go back to your dorm room tomorrow so this will be your last night here." She says and Harry bites his lip.
"Potter, you're early." McGonagall says as Harry enters the empty class. He's only a few minutes early.
"I will not hesitate to kick you off the team, Davies." Harry says and Rhys raises an eyebrow.
"The thing for Potter?" Draco nods, a blush spreading across his cheeks as he looks down at his plate again. "Yes I know about the thing."
"Mr. Potter." McGonagall says and Harry nods in acknowledgement, sitting opposite her.
(See the end of the chapter for
"This is my boyfriend, Draco." He says, and the woman smiles at Draco. Draco doesn't think he'll ever get over the fact that Harry is his boyfriend, or that he says it so casually, like he's been saying it all his life.
"I'm not gonna lie professor it sucks." He mutters and McGonagall smiles slightly.
"Okay. It's Draco." Harry says, deciding to rip the bandage off.
Just try and tell me this isn't the cutest thing ever. I dare you.
"Productive? I think I'm being very productive, considering my goal was to turn you on so much you're begging for it." Harry says and Draco whimpers slightly.
"How was potions?" She asks instead, and Harry shrugs.
The train arrives and Harry takes his time getting off, making sure to shove his book in the back pocket of his black skinny jeans, wanting to avoid the crowd of students. He feels the eyes of the people around him burning into him and shoves his hands in the front pocket of his hoodie that belonged to Sirius. He catches Hermione's eye as he walks towards the carriages, his heart breaking when he sees a lot more students can see the thesterals pulling them. Hermione smiles slightly at him and he takes a deep breath before walking over to her, Ron, Ginny and Luna.
"'Mione he could talk to us."
"After the trial she told me to keep in touch, and she likes to know how I am, and how Teddy is. She knows the war kind of fucked me up, so she likes to make sure I'm coping. Which is probably why she's concerned that you're not writing to her." Harry explains and Draco sighs.
They both meet Hermione in the common room before walking to the quidditch pitch together, separating when they need to go and sit with their respective houses.
"Because he's beautiful and terrifying." Harry mutters, knowing he can be open with her.
"So, like, when are you gonna start a DA type class but for quidditch?" Ron asks and Harry bites his lip.
"Anything for you, Professor." Harry grins, bowing dramatically before McGonagall chuckles.
"Speaking of..." Pansy smirks as she glances past Draco's shoulder. It seems Brandon has just noticed Draco's arrival and is staring at the back of his head. Pansy isn't sure he can see who Draco is with, but he must know, because everyone in the party has heard by now. Draco glances over his shoulder, leaning further into Harry's side as he does, and immediately turns back when he catches Brandon's eye.
Draco almost falls asleep too, what with Harry's even breathing being the only thing Draco can hear. Draco isn't running his hand through Harry's hair anymore, instead his arm is resting on Harry's side and he's running his fingers across the parts of Harry's side and back that he can reach whilst still lying comfortably. Harry has been asleep for 4 hours, and Draco may have dozed off for a few minutes but he's spent most of it watching Harry sleep. It's around 5pm now, and even though they both missed lunch Draco isn't that hungry and he knows Harry wont eat anyway so he doesn't bother waking him up. He needs to sleep more than he needs to eat at the moment, and they can deal with the not eating thing later. If he's going to help Harry he's going to have to do it one thing at a time, and right now Draco needs to sort out his lack of sleep. Harry shifts slightly, and his face is suddenly a lot closer to Draco's than he ever thought it would be and their foreheads are practically touching and Draco doesn't know if his heart beats faster or if it stops all together. Draco carefully moves forward so his forehead is pressed against Harry's and closes his eyes, enjoying the feeling of being this close to him.
"When I was younger I kind of didn't eat. Not a lot. Wasn't allowed to most of the time. My Aunt and Uncle didn't give me much, and if I messed up cooking or I didn't do chores or I got in the way or my cousin complained, then I didn't eat at all. They'd just lock me in the cupboard and I wouldn't eat, so I'm just used to not eating." Harry admits, and he's never mentioned this to anyone apart from McGonagall and Sirius, and Draco's eyes widen.
Harry squeezes Dracos hand as tears fill his eyes. They were so happy. He misses Sirius’ hugs, and he wishes he was able to feel his mum and dads hugs. Draco squeezes Harry’s hand and smiles at him.
"I'm hurting you?" He asks, lessening his grip on Harry's arm. Harry shakes his head, as if desperately trying to make Draco understand without saying it out loud, but Draco isn't getting it and Harry needs to tell him. He needs to say the words, and he needs to pretend he isn't terrified of the reaction he'll get.
Narcissa was planning on checking on the boys, seeing if they were okay, but stops when she hears soft voices coming from Draco's room. She knows snooping is bad, and is about to turn around and leave them alone when she hears Draco's question about Harry's parents liking him. She hears the doubt in her sons voice, and listens carefully to Harry's response. She smiles to herself, eyes watering, because Harry sounds so in love with him, so determined for Draco to understand him and believe what he's saying, and she wipes her eye as she walks away, her heart full, and she figures she can just ask how they're doing at dinner.
"I dunno, he's all about pride ain't he? Probably cause he cursed me when my back was turned." Harry says shrugging and moving to sit on the rail of the bridge, his legs hanging over the edge. Ron sighs and sits next to him, one of the rails attached to the roof of the bridge in between them and Harry leans against it.
"Stop it. You're great and I love you." Harry says, squeezing him close to his side.
"Well we never agree. I'd quite like to take this moment in." Draco breathes in deeply, his eyes closing, and Harry just watches him with a small smile on his face before gently pinching Draco's side.
"No, but he didn't look too good." She says and Blaise nods.
"I do. But my team includes Ginny. And I still haven't spoken to her about, well, everything."
"It was the least I could do." Draco says and Harry smiles. They realise it's time for dinner so they both pack away their things and walk to the great hall together, Harry holding Teddy. When they reach the hall they split off and go to their respective tables.
"Nice to meet you, Mister Potter." Mr Burns says and Harry nods.
"You're lucky you don't have to worry about my parents hating you." Harry mutters jokingly and Draco rolls his eyes.
He didn't sleep much, and the sleep he did get was useless. He's considering skipping breakfast, not feeling hungry, but he has transfiguration this morning and he knows if he skips breakfast McGonagall will probably bring food to class for him. He wouldn't put it past her, so Harry shoves on jeans and a hoodie before making his way down to the kitchen, refusing to go to the hall. Winky gives him a plate of food and Harry frowns at it, not at all hungry. He forces himself to eat a few bites of the croissant before leaving for class.
Draco goes over to pay and Harry notices the way a woman who just walked into the shop is looking at him. Harry frowns and Hermione smiles slightly at him when Harry walks over to Draco because she knows he is so in love and she's proud of her best friend.
"And then I sort of said I love you too." Draco says and he's blushing but smiling so bright and Harry's heart stutters.
"Mione for fucks sake!" Harry shouts, not sounding that angry though, and Hermione grins, noticing the fact that they're both shirtless and, although the duvet is covering them both from the waist down, she knows what they've been up to.
"Yeah, actually. We're gonna tell everyone tomorrow at dinner." Harry says and Hermione nods.
"I mean sure my parents were good to me and they loved me and stuff but I spent my childhood hearing my death eater father talking about the dark lord and how it was despicable that a baby defeated him and trying to think of ways to make him return. My mother was constantly living in fear of doing anything wrong that would upset or anger my father. I was raised to be a proper pure blood son. I was raised to be a death eater. My house was constantly full of my fathers death eater friends." Draco explains, sighing in defeat, before adding, "I've never told anyone that." Harry shuffles closer to him and watches Teddy who is lying on the floor, holding his bear above his head and giggling sleepily.
"You okay?" Draco asks and Harry nods because he's really not but how on God's green earth is he going to even begin to explain to anyone why he both needs Draco more than anything but also can't be near him anymore because he just keeps falling further and further in love with him and it's not fair. Nothing is fair.
"Hey, mate." Ron says and Harry looks up as he finishes tying his lace. He nods in recognition before pulling off his jersey and pulling on a t-shirt.
"Oh my god you fucked." He says slightly too loud and Draco is glad he had the sense to cast a suppression charm so those around can't hear.
"Why don't you eat?" Harry's hand pauses against the parchment, a drop of ink landing right next to the word he'd just written, before he sighs.
"Tired. Missed you a bit."
"Told you they'd take it well." Harry mutters, smirking, and Draco rolls his eyes.
"Try again." He whispers and he's standing so close to Dracos side that he almost can't focus. Draco says the spell again, his mind full of Harry Potter, and this time a few sparks spit out of the end of his wand before a huge beautiful gray wolf erupts from the end of his wand and stands in front of the two of them.
"Thank fuck Harry we were worried sick!" Seamus calls and Harry sighs, sitting up. He's not really in the mood to talk to people.
"I'm sorry." Harry says, because he can tell that Draco was actually concerned for him, and Draco smiles slightly.
Harry mutters a cleaning spell, because he may be in the shower but he knows not to leave that sort of mess, before turning off the water and stepping out of the shower, wrapping a towel around his waist. He walks over to the window, remembering what Malfoy said, and pushes it open. It's still raining hard and Harry would love to go and stand in it but he knows McGonagall would kill him. Harry stands at the window for a while watching the rain, and when he turns around to get dressed the steam in the room is gone and he can see clearly. Harry checks the time to see it's 7:15 and he knows he needs to try and avoid everyone on his way back to the dorm because they're definitely going to be mad at him for missing every meal. Harry gets dressed into joggers and a t-shirt and pulls on his converse before sending his stuff back to his dorm so he doesn't have to carry it. His hair is still damp and he could use a spell to dry it but it's always softer and curlier and fluffier when he lets it air dry so he doesn't bother. He exits the bathroom and walks down the hallway, managing to get half way to the floor above when before he runs into someone.
At some point Harry stops rubbing his temples and instead wraps his arms around Draco's waist, his eyes drifting shut as he rests his head against Draco's back, the two of them just sitting together. Draco smiles slightly, his head still resting on his arms, and when he hears Harry's breath even out as he falls asleep behind him Draco moves one arm to rest his hand on top of Harry's. Draco doesn't let himself fall asleep because they have Herbology in half an hour, so instead he just relishes in the feeling of being hugged close to Harry's chest. He listens to Harry breathing, rubbing the back of Harry's hand softly, and he can feel the even movement of Harry's chest against him, and he needs to wake Harry up soon but he doesn't want to because he wants Harry to sleep but he also does not want to move.
"Yeah?"
"Potter?"
"Headache. Dizzy."
"What was that about?" Ron asks once Harry's sat back down, looking at him curiously.
"He can stay with Madam Pomfrey whilst you are in lessons." She says before adding "you will stay in the room of requirement, security charms have been cast on it for you, as there isn't enough space for him in your dormitory. All of your things as well as Teddy's are already there." She says before walking out of the hall. Harry turns to Hermione and Ron, who are looking just as baffled as Harry feels, and then down at Teddy.
"You don't have to call me captain, you know."
"Ron what the fuck?" Harry asks and Ron stops walking and turns to him once they're halfway across the bridge, no other students near by.
"Of course, Mister Potter. Mr Potter helped Winky and now Winky helps Mister Potter." She says and Harry smiles at her before heading back out of the kitchen and towards the stairs.
"Potter, another new book, I see." McGonagall says and Harry nods.
"Harry." He mutters against the others lips and Harry pulls away slightly. He looks into Draco's eyes, looking for any sign of regret or doubt but all he sees is love and lust.
"Cause you're stating a fact. Can't be embarrassed about a fact." Harry says and George rolls his eyes.
"Thank you Harry." He smiles, not even realising he used his first name, and a grin spreads across Harrys face as he turns to look at the blond.
Just then Draco and Pansy walk into the common room talking.
After a few minutes the door handle rattles before there's a knock on the door.
"Okay." Draco is looking at him in that way that makes him feel gooey again, so he leans forward and presses a quick kiss against Draco's lips before squeezing his hand again.
“I don’t wanna think about it.” He chokes and Draco pulls him into a hug, resting his chin on Harry’s head.
"I didn't mean to interrupt..." Draco says and Harry shrugs. No one has heard him play before, apart from Kreacher and Sirius, who taught him, and he's not sure how he feels about it.
"Hey Will. First practice is gonna be this Wednesday, either of you have any classes in the afternoon?" He asks.
"Have a seat, Mr. Malfoy." McGonagall says, sitting at her desk. Draco sits in the chair on the other side of the desk and bites his lip nervously.
"Well the thought crossed my mind, many times, but no. I told you why I brought you here." Harry says, moving so his hands are on Draco's chest and he pushes him against the closest wall. He grins when Draco lets out a quiet groan and leans close to his ear.
"Your place or mine?" Harry asks with a small smirk, and Draco blushes slightly but rolls his eyes.
So I've added this chapter last minute but I kind of really like it so I hope you do to :)
"The last interaction I had with a baby was when I was one." Draco says and Harry chuckles.
"You're welcome."
"I love you more."
"Why not? I'm basically a god, right? Everyone loves me, right? I can do no wrong?" Harry shouts.
"You're evil." Draco says, still blushing over the fact that Harry called him babe. Harry just grins and winks at Draco before pecking him softly. Draco still can't get his head around the fact that he can now kiss Harry whenever he wants. When Harry pulls away from Draco completely and sits on his bed, grabbing a book and opening it, Draco looks confused for a second before the door opens and he realises why Harry moved away.
Harry looks over at Draco when he hears the door shut and sighs before looking back out the window.
“You are so much like your father.” He whispers and Harry nods.
"Whats with the sudden need for affection?" He asks softly, wrapping his arms as tight round Dracos waist as he can.
"Yeah." Harry sighs and Blaise frowns, looking at him.
"Well your plan worked out great so everyone is convinced you're dating 50 different people." Hermione jokes.
"Okay." He says, but everyone can hear how nervous he is about it. McGonagall looks at him for a second before walking back towards the doors. As she opens them she runs into Ron and Hermione.
"Alright," He says, finishing his drink, "Let's go." Hermione and Draco finish their drinks before standing up and the three of them walk out of the pub, Harry walking next to Draco in case anyone tries anything.
"I read about potions a lot during summer and I guess I learnt something." Harry shrugs and Blaise looks at him for a second.
"But you didn't." Draco jokes and Harry shakes his head.
"For being a decent human, and for looking after Draco in general." He says and Harry smiles.
"You can stay if you want." He says and Draco looks at him for a second before looking at Harry, who just shrugs and holds a hand out to him.
"Okay, sounds like a plan." Draco says and Harry nods, smiling.
"I know, if 13 year old me could see me now he wouldn't believe it."
"Besides mate, you've got a dragon on your ribs and the actual constellation he was named after on your back so it's kind of obvious you love him, you've basically turned your body into a shrine for him." He says and Harry chuckles.
"Mornin sleeping beauty." Harry jokes, speaking softly, and Draco glares at him.
"It's alright, Sirius. My parents have already decided you're going to live here." He says and Sirius chuckles.
"No you bellend." Harry chuckles. "Sirius was great. He told me that the world isn't split into good people and death eaters. We all have both light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are. He knew you had good in you, even if you didn't think so. He was awesome." Harry says, his tone bittersweet.
"Harry they were so excited about you, and they were so happy. Harry you are so much like your father. And Sirius was there for every milestone." Draco says and Harry bites his lip. He can't help but imagine how close he would have been with Sirius had he not gone to Azkaban or died. From the memory he saw he was really close with Sirius. And his dad was so excited about him being born.
"Yeah, I finally had inspiration for a new one." Draco blushes slightly as there's a tapping on the window. Harry looks up and sees an owl, so he opens the window, takes the letter and strokes the owl before returning to the floor next to Draco. He recognises the writing as Andromeda's and frowns slightly as he opens the letter.
"Of what?" Harry studies his eyes again, and Draco tries to show him that it's okay; he can tell him.
"5-3-2! You're slacking, Blaise." Harry chuckles and Blaise laughs,
Draco is freaking out a little. Potter looked really attractive in joggers and a hoodie but Draco hasn't seen him since he left the hall at lunch without eating anything and after hearing Granger say he wishes the curse had killed him Draco has been desperate to hold Potter and tell him he's glad he's alive. He didn't show up to dinner and it's 11pm so he should definitely be in their dorm by now, but he's completely disappeared. Draco leaves his and Harry's dorm room and goes to the common room to find Granger sitting by the fireplace alone and reading.
"-floating in a most peculiar way. And the stars look very different today... For here am I sitting in a tin can... far above the world... planet Earth is blue, and there's nothing I can do... Though I'm past one hundred thous-" Harry freezes when he hears footsteps and looks up to see Draco.
"But can it be all black, with green eyes? And add a few narcissus flowers?" Draco asks and Harry nods, smiling slightly.
"Sorry you didn't make the team, Jane." He says and she shrugs.
"Blaise?" A third year walks over to him and Draco, looking slightly nervous and worried. Pansy went to bed a few minutes ago, and Blaise and Draco have been sat chatting by the fire.
"What happened, Mr. Malfoy?" Madam Pomfrey asks and Harry listens carefully so he can hear their conversation.
"We just wanted to come and see if it was true." One of the people with Brandon says.
Stay safe ♥
(See the end of the chapter for
"What's up?" Harry asks, concerned and confused. They were joking around not 2 minutes ago and suddenly Draco looks terrified.
(was this too south London? do any of you know what the first sentence means? sorry :'D )
"Anyway, I should get going."
"You're gonna kill me, love?" Harry's eyes are sparkling with amusement, and Draco huffs under him, stealing a kiss.
"Zabini." He says, waiting for Blaise to catch up to him.
Harry falls asleep, and Draco continues carding his fingers through his hair. He still doesn't know what's wrong with him; Harry was lying on his lap for an hour before he fell asleep and he didn't say a word. He just sighed and frowned and Draco tried to ease the frown away but Harry was clearly thinking about something important because until the point he fell asleep he looked conflicted and stressed. Draco wishes Harry would talk to him about whatever it is that's going on, but he knows he shouldn't pry. Draco watches Harry sleep, his eye scanning every part of Harry's face, and when he's sure Harry is deeply asleep he lifts his hand, the one that isn't carding through Harry's curls, and softly traces Harry's face with his index finger, running it along his cheekbones, down the bridge of his nose, across his jaw, and ghosting it over his lips before finally resting it on Harry's chest and gently rubbing small circles there. Harry looks so calm when he's like this, and Draco loves it. He loves the way Harry's lashes brush his cheeks, and the way his frown settles as soon as Dracos fingers touch his skin, and how Harry's lips twitch into a small smile when Draco brushes his fingers over them. Draco wonders, if he ever kisses Harry, will his lips twitch into a smile then too? Draco hesitates, his index finger pausing against Harry's jaw. He doubts that will ever happen.
"I'm fine. Professor I don't think I wrote this essay."
"So long as your father never finds out." Narcissa says, lightheartedly. Draco huffs a laugh.
"Hey, c-can I get sumfin t-to warm m-me up?" Harry asks and a mug of hot chocolate is handed to him immediately from Winky as a different house-elf wraps a blanket round his shoulders.
"I mean, until Dumbledore made them give me Dudley's second bedroom when I was 12 the cupboard was my room." Dracos jaw drops.
"Thank you." He whispers, and Harry stands up just in time for Ron to pull him into a bone crushing hug.
"Harry Potter is protecting a death eater?" The boy asks and Harry shoots a death glare that makes the one speaking falter.
"Shrieking shack." He says through the sobs and Ron nods, getting off the railing and helping Harry down before leading him to the shrieking shack.
"Harry?" The two boys hear George's voice through the door and Draco glares at it.
"Oh, er, okay. Thank you." He says and Pomfrey smiles. He's still not okay with Dean, and he's not been looking forward to going back.
”Your turn then.” Pansy grins and slides onto the floor in front of the chair, Harry taking her place on the seat. Pansy’s hair is a similar length to Harry’s and straight as a ruler, and he’s only ever done Hermiones before which is long and bushy, so it’s different, but he starts a single french braid in the centre of her hair that he brings back before tying it into a bun. It takes 5 minutes and his fingers move with practised ease and Blaise and Draco aren’t talking anymore; they’re both wondering when the hell Harry learnt to do hair. When Harry finishes Pansy stands up and poses dramatically.
"Tell me, Harry. Talk to me." He puts his hands on Harrys cheeks and looks him in the eyes and Harry can't help but let his heartbreak show.
"You have got to stop using that." Blaise mutters, his hands on Harry's shoulders, and Harry nods. He's gripping Blaise's arms tight and he hopes he isn't hurting him
"What you doing here?" Harry asks.
"I..." Harry whispers before realising he doesn't know what to say, or how to express his fear to Draco. Draco strokes Harry's cheek with his thumb and Harry sinks into the pillow.
"So you witnessed it first hand and still want me to come even though I will definitely embarrass you?" Draco nods and Harry grins. "You really do love me." He says quietly, as if he didn't really believe it. Draco chuckles.
"You're not human I swear." Rhys says, leaning on Harry's shoulder, and Harry can feel that he's putting a lot of his weight on Harry because he's so tired.
"You ate at breakfast and lunch?" Harry nods.
"But- How are you not sick of me?" Harry asks and it's so full of self doubt and self hatred that it breaks Draco's heart.
"What?"
"Yeah, she said everyone in the order knew." Harry explains and Ron frowns.
"I do too. Now go and eat some breakfast before class." She says and Harry nods.
"Harry, this is Mr Burns." Harry shakes the hand of the man in front of him. He looks nice and friendly, with glasses and a short beard.
"You were distracted." Hermione says fondly, looking over at Draco, whose hair is yet again perfect, to see him looking at Harry and smiling subtly, probably because he's eating.
"I think it's only fair we wait until tomorrow. We can announce it at dinner. Then we can go Hogsmeade together Saturday and not get weird looks."
"You came to get your book?" Blaise asks, noticing the book on Harry's bedside, and Harry shakes his head.
"Were you sat like that for 3 hours?" Draco nods and Harry sits up.
"Can you please do me a favour?" Harry asks and she nods.
"I'll tell you after class." Harry whispers and the pout leaves Seamus' face immediately.
"You alright?"
"Arsehole." Harry murmurs as he buries his face in Dracos neck. Draco laughs and Harry grins against his skin because Draco is just so cute and Harry is so bloody in love and yeah, this is worth it. This is definitely worth it.
"I know."
"Potter, you are the strongest person I know. You have been dealt the worst possible hand, but you're still here, and I know it's scary, and it will probably hurt. But living hurts, Harry. Being alive hurts, but it's also amazing. You're still here, and you've put everyone else first for your whole life. Now it is your turn to be happy. It's your turn to live, Harry." Harry hugs her back tightly, because she's right, as usual, and she's like a mother to him.
"I will, professor. He er, he spoke about his godfather earlier." Draco says, because he kind of wants help with how to help Harry; He's never lost someone he cared for so he doesn't know how to comfort him.
"Sure." He says and he slows to let Rhys catch up with him before continuing round the grounds.
"Doesn't deserve to know." He says and Narcissa nods. Lucius, along with every other death eater that got caught, is in Azkaban, and Draco and Narcissa haven't seen or spoken to him since the war.
"Yeah I'm fine." He says, throwing some mandrake root into the cauldron.
"I'm not sure, Rhys..." Harry trails off, stopping just in front of Draco and meeting his gaze, and Rhys nods.
"He's adorable." Draco says, still staring at Harry in the picture, and Harry smiles proudly.
"About?" Harry asks and Draco unconsciously bites his lip. Harry raises an eyebrow, trying to get Draco to answer.
"Well that's probably Harry then." Ron mutters.
"Well I can solve one of those things." Blaise smirks and Harry glances at him nervously. Blaise must know about the book.
Harry waits until the last minute to get off the train. Draco waits with him, knowing exactly why. He takes Harry's hand and squeezes it slightly.
"Thanks." Ron throws her a grateful smile before making his way up the stairs. He opens the door slowly, trying to stay quiet as he glances round the room. He sees Draco immediately, and walks over to his bed. Ron touches Draco's shoulder slightly and Draco's eyes snap open immediately. He looks at the bed in front of him, as if expecting, or hoping, to see someone there, before his gaze lands on Ron.
"Oh well that narrows it down." Harry mutters sarcastically and Draco rolls his eyes as there's a knock on their door. Harry debates whether or not he should get off of Dracos lap when the door opens to reveal Hermione.
"No." Harry says and Draco frowns.
"So he's alone? Why didn't you invite him here?" Draco rolls his eyes.
"I love you too."
During breakfast Harry lets Seamus and Dean know that he'll tell everyone at dinner, which of course they needed to spread to the whole school. Which is why Seamus and Dean are now standing on the bench.
"You're welcome."
"How's my favorite gays?" Blaise asks as he sits at the table opposite Pansy and Draco, he looks at the two of them before grinning. "Draacooo? Why are you bluuushingg?" He practically sings and Draco blushes harder.
"You okay?"
"No. The consequences would be unimaginable. I mean, I'd probably get kicked out of school." Harry laughs, genuine and loud, burying his face in Draco's neck as he laughs with him.
"So why don't you just talk to Draco?"
"Yeah. But I guess I'm glad she didn't have to go through what I did with the Dursleys." Harry says just as the door opens and Draco walks in. He smiles at Harry before noticing Ron.
"Best get a move on then, McGonagall wont like it if you skip a meal." Hagrid says with a smile and Harry nods.
"Hey buddy, I missed you." He says softly and he hears a chorus of "aww" from some of the girls around him. He bites his lip nervously looking back to Hermione and Ron.
"Malfoy I have known you since we were 11 and never have you been like this. You woke up and asked how he was, you came with me without question. I mean I could be leading you to your death but you came with me cause I told you Harry needed you." Draco looks conflicted. Yes he loves Harry, but this is Harry's best friend and he feels awkward admitting it to him.
"Yeah, she's great, she's going home tomorrow." Harry says and Draco frowns, confused for a second, before realisation crosses his annoyingly perfect features.
"You missed dinner again." She says quietly, and Harry shrugs a shoulder.
"Is this what you were talking to Blaise about?"
Oh also Happy April and I hope you're all staying safe and social distancing.
"Thanks." He mumbles as he walks past Harry and out of the store cupboard, his arm brushing Harry's on the way out and both boys feel a wave of butterfly's in their stomach. Harry grabs the scurvy grass and the rest of the ingredients before returning to his table.
"You two are distracted by each other, Harry. You heard him. He knows everything about you. He knows you don't eat and he knows you've been different with us too. I didn't tell him that stuff." She says before smirking.
"You okay?" Harry blinks slowly before nodding.
"Malfoy I'm sorry, I am. When I was doing your tattoo I tried to distance myself from you emotionally but it didn't work and I linked myself to your tattoo." Harry says and Draco frowns.
"Potter?"
"I'm sorry Harry." George says before pulling away. "Come to the shop after class tomorrow yeah? We can have a good ol' chinwag." He jokes and Harry smiles.
"Did you read the essay?"
"Whats wrong?" Draco asks.
"But I
"Harry!" Blaise grins as he enters the hospital wing. There's a sixth year Ravenclaw in a bed near the door that jumps at the loud greeting, and Blaise smiles when Harry sits up straighter and closes his sketchbook.
"My boy's growing up. Tell me everything." He says, pushing Pansy down the bench so he can sit next to Draco. Pansy glares at Blaise and sits on Dracos lap.
"I don't really feel like talking to anyone." He mutters before sighing. "But then if I don't talk to anyone I feel bad cause people will think I'm ignoring them or something." Harry rests his chin on his hand.
"When are you more okay?" Draco asks and Harry knows the answer immediately. Trying to convince himself to admit it out loud, however, takes a bit longer.
"They won't hate you. If anything they'll finally realise that you aren't your father. You're forgetting how much people listen to what I say. As much as I hate being the chosen one, it may actually be useful in this situation." Harry says and Draco bites his lip.
"Yeah, something like that." Harry jokes and Ron nods.
"I forgive you. I'm sorry I threatened to curse you."
"Well, that thing... Over the past few months that thing kind of turned into a... bigger thing." Narcissa smiles properly, putting her fork down to give him her full attention.
"Drink this, Potter."
"I'm proud of you." He says, knowing how hard it is for Harry, And Harry smiles slightly, connecting their hands. He never received praise as a kid, and he didn't really get any praise during school. It's nice to know someone is proud of him. "You heard from the Gryffindors?" Draco changes the subject, knowing if they spend too long talking about food Harry will start to feel guilty.
"No. He was getting too close." Draco mutters and Harry grins.
"See you later Harry. Malfoy." She says before leaving the room, shutting the door behind her, and Draco frowns after her.
"They're not all bad, you understand?" Harry asks the group and they all nod.
"You saved me first." He says with a small smile and Draco tries so hard to suppress his smile but Harry still sees the corners of his lips twitch upwards.
"You're just saying that cause I made you chaser again." He says and she shakes her head.
"You alright, Harry?" Seamus asks and Harry nods, smiling.
"Dunno." He says, not tired at all and only slightly sweating. Rhys reaches out and grabs Harry's arm to stop him.
"I didn't have a choice." Draco says, his voice cracking. Harry kisses Dracos hands softly before holding them against his chest again. They're lying so close their foreheads are almost touching and their legs are linked and all he can see is Draco and all he can smell is Draco and it's wonderful.
"When- last week when you wouldn't let me go in our dorm to get a book... Why'd you stop me?" Ron looks up and frowns.
"Come on, at least come and sit in the common room rather than on this cold step." Blaise says, standing up, and Harry hesitates before standing up and following Blaise down to the common room. Blaise says the password and enters before waiting for Harry to enter after him. The common room is pretty empty save for a few students still working or chatting, and when Harry see's Draco his heart flutters slightly. He's sat by the fire and it's casting a warm glow across his face, which looks so soft and calm and serene that Harry almost doesn't want anyone to interrupt him.
"Hey, we've kind of got quidditch practice cause the match is tomorrow so I was wondering-" Harry starts but Hermione interrupts.
"You're right. Draco is also a better person than you will ever be." Blaise uses his words against him, but Dracos hands are shaking. Harry immediately grabs his hand tight, tries to figure out how to calm him down in a room full of people.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You okay?" Harry whispers, and Draco nods, swallows audibly.
“Have you found out yet?” He asks nervously and James shakes his head.
"Draco- you-I need to leave. I need to go." Draco starts to panic now, because how did he fuck this up? Did he do something wrong?
"Which one you gonna watch first?" Draco asks quietly as Harry opens the case and bites his lip, running his finger across the rows of 'specific' memories in the lid.
"Really?"
"What are- what- we- you- I don't know." Draco struggles before giving up, ending with a sigh, and Harry figures what he meant to say.
"I love you too." Draco murmurs and Harry grins just as the door opens.
"So she knew I had almost killed her only child and she still saved me?" Harry asks and Draco grabs Harrys shoulders, forcing him to look at him.
"How you feeling?" Dean asks softly and Harry shrugs, pulling Deans arm further around him and burying his face in Seamus' neck.
Sorry it was so late, I’m on holiday atm x
"Yeah. Just like this." Draco manages to say, his voice barely above a whisper.
"I know who you are." He accepts the handshake, but Harry just grips his hand tight in a bone crushing hold.
"I'm so sorry, Harry." Seamus says softly as a few tears fall down Harry's cheek. Harry looks desperately at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry isn't sure how long he's been lying on the floor. He knows there's a few little stones digging into his back and lying on solid ground isn't comfortable in the slightest but it somehow makes him feel close to Sirius. In this clearing in the middle of the forest everything is peaceful all of a sudden; Harrys brain has finally stopped to breath and all he can hear is the rustling of the leaves from the wind and a few creatures that are walking around the forest. He can't hear or see any person or reminder of the war or his past apart from the clearing he's in that no longer saddens him, but instead makes him feel close to his godfather. The stars are shining bright against the black sky and the light from them filters through the trees and Harry thinks it's one of the most beautiful things he's ever seen
Harry flies straight towards the snitch at the same time as Draco and Blaise, and just as his fingers close around the snitch they all collide and fall off their brooms, luckily they're only a few feet off the ground, and when they land they land in a heap, all of them laughing.
"You're an arse." He mutters and Blaise grins.
"Well it's a lot less than everyone assumes. Yeah I've fooled around with a lot but I didn't fuck everyone I've kissed." Harry says and Draco stays quiet, willing Harry to go on.
"He wont, Draco, cause you're right there." Blaise smiles at him and Draco takes a deep breath before pressing his forehead back against Harry's.
"Not really, Edgar Gaunt is here with a rather dreadful looking woman." Pansy starts, "Stephanie Burke has had a child with a half-blood and has been pretty much shunned by everyone. Oh," She smirks, "Brandon Avery is here." Draco tenses, and Harry frowns.
"It's okay. We have transfiguration in a minute." Harry says but he's slurring and his eyelids feel heavy and he doesn't want to sleep because he's scared of the nightmares.
"Harry, I am glad you came back here. I know it can't have been easy." She starts and Harry shrugs, looking at her desk rather than looking her in the eye.
“Nope.” He says, eyes still shut. Hermione rolls her eyes and pulls Harry’s arm so he’s forced to get up. When Harry is standing he walks to Draco's side of the bed and leans over him so he can see his face.
"Draco. I love you." Harry says, more nervous than Draco has ever seen him, and Draco can feel a glow spread from his heart throughout his body and it's blinding because hearing Harry say he loves him is the best feeling in the world.
The three of them split up when they reach the forest so they can cover more ground, and they're about to lose hope when Luna sees a clearing in the trees.
"What do you want, Malfoy?" He asks and Draco raises an eyebrow. So he's only Draco at night?
"Potter what are we going to do with you?" Madam Pomfrey asks as she walks over to a cupboard and a sink. "Mister Zabini, Mister Malfoy, could one of you please fetch Professor McGonagall?"
"So you would've had a little sister?" Ron asks and Harry nods.
"You've never hated him, Draco." Draco rolls his eyes again but smiles down at his empty plate because he knows she's right.
"I'll see you later, mate." Ron says with a grin and Harry finally sees him as Ron and not Fred's younger brother for the first time in months.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm not blaming you for what happened to mister Potter. I merely want to know what happened." She says and Blaise nods.
"Because he is my best friend and I don't want to lose him."
"Gross!" Blaise calls from the top of the stairs, but he's smiling and doesn't mean it at all. Harry and Draco laugh as they follow Blaise and Pansy up the stairs, away from the loud voices below them.
Harry sighs again and lets his eyes scan the Slytherin table. He immediately find who he's looking for. Malfoy is sat with Pansy and Blaise, listening to something Pansy is talking about but not really looking interested. He looks good as usual today; He's wearing a white shirt and some slim fit grey trousers, both of which hug his body in all the right places. He let his hair grow long after the war, not too much, just above his shoulders, but it's long enough to be pulled into a gorgeous messy bun but also looks sexy as hell when it's down. Harry realises he's staring and quickly looks away, directing his gaze to the table. He knows he has some sort of feelings for him, he's had a crush on him since 3rd year. Hermione is the only one that knows about his feelings for him. Harry told her just after he spoke on Draco's and his mothers behalf at their trial that he felt something for him that wasn't the usual annoyance. Everyone assumes Harry is straight because of the Cho and Ginny thing, but hardly anyone knows he's actually bi.
"It's very Slytherin of you, Potter." Draco comments and Harry just shrugs.
"I know. I never asked-" McGonagall lowers her voice as students start arriving "How did it go with Mr. Burns? You think it'll help?"
"People already think this place is haunted. You can be as loud as you want." He whispers in Draco's ear and he shivers.
"I should be askin' you that Harry. Come in and have a rest, would yer." Hagrid puts his hand on Harry's back and leads him into his hut. He knows Harry isn't okay, and he just want's Harry to know he can talk to him. Harry walks over and sits at the table and Hagrid passes him a glass of water before sitting down.
"Harry how haven't you noticed? You make him so nervous and he makes you stronger. You make each other happier." She says softly and Harry bites his lip.
"Mr Potter. What are you doing gallivanting about the corridors at this time?" McGonagall asks, looking between the two boys a few times before her gaze settles on Harry. There's a smugish look on her face that you wouldn't notice unless you've seen it as many times as Harry has, like when she was arguing with Umbridge.
"I think you should make me." Draco mutters and Harry raises an eyebrow.
"You know, you've done a lot of stuff for the benefit of everyone else. This is the first time you're doing something purely to help you."
"So where did you go?" He asks, his breath blowing across Harry's neck.
"Slight understatement." He says and McGonagall tries to stop a smile.
"Did he say he died?" Pansy whispers and Blaise nods. Draco is looking at the floor intently, wanting to hug Harry and make him feel better but knowing that he can't.
"Harry, just go and talk to him." Hermione says and Harry shrugs.
"Please don't- dorm." Harry mutters, and Draco really doesn't want to go to the Gryffindor common room but he knows Harry wont let him take him to Pomfrey so he sighs, half carrying Harry down the corridor. They get to the painting and stop.
"It's a shame it's Tuesday and we have classes. I kinda wanna stay here all day." Harry whispers and Draco hums in agreement.
"I got cold." He explains and Draco rolls his eyes but smiles slightly, Harry looks adorable all the time, but when he's wearing Draco's hoodie he looks amazing. Draco walks over and sits opposite Harry, cross legged. He's looking at the guitar, remembering how amazing Harry sounded when he played it, and wishing he could hear it again.
"You're welcome. Now, off to bed."
"How come?" Harry asks sitting next to him and Draco sighs.
Harry is pacing his living room nervously, waiting for Draco to arrive via floo. He tried to look presentable, Kreacher helping him find something to wear considering he's served a pure blood family all his life and being used to things like this, so he's wearing black jeans and a black shirt. It's not exactly a suit and tie but he looks alright, save for the bags under his eyes.
"I'm actually looking for Draco."
"Of course. I saw your teaching skills when you created Dumbledore's army, and with the way you train your team. I would even go so far as to offer you both roles, if you would take them both." She says and Harry nods.
"Well, I tried anyway. He didn't want help." Draco mutters, before explaining the bathroom situation.
"Run." He says briefly before leaving the room. He knows they're going to start talking about him again once he's gone but he can't bring himself to care. He takes off down the stairs and through the castle until he's outside, and then he starts running around Hogwarts grounds. On his third lap of the castle it starts to rain slightly and Harry regrets not putting on a jacket on. He's been running for an hour but he doesn't want to stop, so he continues running in the rain. His white t-shirt is now completely see through but there's no one here to see him anyway.
"What's got you so happy?" Ron asks when Harry sits down on the coffee table in front of them all, his legs crossed.
"Are you feeling dizzy or lightheaded?" Harry shakes his head.
"She said you hate the fame and the fact people still call you the chosen one. She said you have nightmares, but I knew that anyway. She said you think all the deaths are your fault and you feel guilty." Malfoy says, grabbing Harry's hand and intertwining their fingers as he takes a deep breath.
"Mister Potter does not need a wand to perform magic, I'm sure he only raised his wand to let the other Gryffindors know he would stick up for you. He is a powerful wizard. He can perform wandless and silent magic with ease. Which is why he is able to use Legilimency." McGonagall says and Blaise frowns.
"Okay." Blaise says, not wanting to force Harry to talk, and Harry is shocked slightly but continues with the work, thankful that Blaise isn't prying.
You lot are so cute by the way, thank you for all the get well soon comments, I'm still not 100% but I'm getting better <3
"That went well." He smiles, and Harry leans over and kisses Draco's cheek before resting his head on Draco's shoulder.
"I did." He says and, noticing Draco's raised eyebrow he explains.
"Missed you more."
"What do you mean?" He asks and she smiles.
"Okay, Potter. Well, I have informed your professors that you will not be in class today so stay here and rest." She says and Harry sighs but nods. He would really rather do something to distract him from his thoughts but he knows Madam Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall are going to make him stay here.
"How may I help you, Potter?" McGonagall asks, gesturing to the chair opposite her, which Harry sits down in.
Draco tells Blaise what he told Pansy and Blaise has pretty much the same reaction, only with a lot more arm flairs and squealing.
"So Blaise says you're going back to the Lions den?" Draco says quietly. They're almost done with dinner and they've been having quiet conversations about nothing in particular. Harry nods, pushing his food around his plate. The hall is slowly filling up now, not with many people from his year or seventh year, but there's enough people to make Harry feel awkward.
"I trust you too, Draco."
"Wait, is that how you knew where I was in fifth and sixth year?" He asks and Harry chuckles.
"I know." They look at each other for a few seconds before Harry continues walking, Blaise not following him. Harry walks around for a little bit longer before stopping at a tree by the lake, settling on the grass and resting back against the trunk, one leg out in front of him, the other bent at the knee. He looks out across the river and sighs. He really needs to tell Draco what he meant this morning, he just has no idea how to and he's terrified.
"I'll try not to take that personally." Draco mutters but he's joking and Harry chuckles at his response.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You saved me Malfoy, and so did your mum. You didn't want to do what you did. And I wasn't going to allow another innocent person go to Azkaban." Harry says and Draco smiles slightly, Harry's given him an opportunity to find out more about his godfather.
"I'll see you later." He says quietly to Blaise before walking up the stairs and heading to McGonagalls office.
"The usual." Harry mumbles, deciding not to mention Malfoy. At the thought of the blonde his eyes drift over to the slytherin table and immediately find the pale face he was seeking. Harry notices that Draco is looking straight at him and looks kind of annoyed and, is that Jealousy?
"Downgraded?" She chuckles, "Honey, do your eyes not work?"
"Do you like it?" Harry asks nervously.
They make their way to the hall, Harry and Draco's little fingers linked together, and Harry can feel Ron looking over at him. Harry meets his gaze and smiles slightly as a greeting, and Ron smiles back. Draco spots McGonagall looking at Harry out of the corner of his eye and turns to look at him, frowning when he sees there's still no food on the plate in front of him. He's sorted out Harry's sleeping problem, now he needs to try and help him with the not eating thing. Only problem is, he has no idea how to do that. He briefly considers asking Madam Pomfrey but decides against it; last time she tried to help him eat it was with an appetite booster potion and Harry noticed immediately. Maybe he should just try asking him? Or he could take him to hogsmeade at the weekend and see if he'll eat there? But then Harry has therapy on Saturday and training and Draco isn't sure Harry would even want to go to Hogsmeade with him. Could he- no. That's a definite no. He couldn't possibly talk to Granger or Weasley. He would, of course, if it meant helping Harry, but Draco knows for a fact that Granger and the whole Gryffindor gang hate him. Weasley asked him to help Harry, so maybe Weasley is his only option. Although would Weasley actually be able to help?
"That must be one special person." Harry mumbles, wondering who Draco thought of that has that affect on him, feeling kind of jealous of whoever it is, and Draco keeps his eyes on the wolf.
"I'm not going anywhere." Draco whispers reassuringly and Harry takes a deep breath before relaxing his grip slightly. Draco let's go of Harry's right hand and grabs his left so he's wrapped further around Harry, forming a human shield around him, and Harry's right hand grips Draco's forearm.
"I am in love with Draco Malfoy." Harry says, not taking his eyes away from Draco, and Draco smiles the cutest smile and blushes like mad and lowers his head to hide behind his hair because every single person in the hall is looking between the two of them, waiting to see what happens.
"Thank you." He whispers, and she smiles slightly.
"He is pretty." Harry says as Draco blushes deeper and looks at Harry, and George chuckles slightly.
"I will allow you to go for a run as long as you are in the great hall for dinner." She says and Harry smiles.
"That and he has a thing for you." Draco says and Harry takes a deep breath, reaching out to hold Draco's hand.
"Honestly?" Draco nods. "It's a lot. And it probably won't make sense."
"But everyone expects me to be okay." More tears fall and Draco can't catch them all.
"Nothing." He says and Blaise speaks over him.
Harry goes over to the door and opens it, figuring there's only one person it can be.
"Yes."
"Maybe Wednesday. I know sixth years have astronomy tonight, which means all of their classes tomorrow will be in the afternoon. I think fourth years have defence Thursday night. I don't want to wait until Friday or the weekend." Harry says and she nods.
"You alright, Mate?" Ron asks and Harry looks up at them, nods, and goes back to his textbook.
Harry wakes up slowly, keeping his eyes shut, not wanting to interrupt the flow of conversation around him. Blaise is talking about a band he wants to see and he's so enthusiastic about it. Harry feels hands in his hair and on his back and forces himself not to smile. It's comforting, and he doesn't want it to stop. It's then that he realises what day it is, and that he has no idea what time it is. He blinks a few times and the hands retract from his body as he sits up slowly. Draco, Blaise and Pansy fall quiet as they look at Harry. His hair is a mess from where Draco had been running his hand through it, and his eyes are slightly puffy with exhaustion. He's adorable.
"This is my spot, Draco." Harry says, knowing Draco will get what he means, and by the look on his face he does.
Okay so story time, I am so scared that you're going to hate how this happened so please let me know what you think? I had SO MANY different ideas for how I could have written this moment but I figured blurting it out mid rant in the middle of a breakdown in the Slytherin dorm room kind of perfectly fit Harry in this story and I am so hoping you all agree with me! I was literally so nervous to post this chapter so if you hate it let me know but in a nice way so I don't have a full on breakdown.
"And you love it." He says before kissing the spot where Draco's neck and shoulder meet.
Harry knows Draco was forced into what he did but he doesn't believe that he's glad he survived the war. He doesn't have it in him to argue so he just stays quiet, glad that the tears have finally stopped falling. He doesn't want to confirm what Hermione said, because he doesn't want Draco to know it's true. After a few minutes of silence it becomes apparent to Draco that Harry isn't going to say anything about it so he decides to change the subject for now.
"Or what? No escape, Malfoy." Harry says daringly, his face inches away from Dracos. Dracos breath catches and he realises he literally has no escape. Harry is blocking him from all directions; and he kind of loves it.
"Well, my godfather went to Azkaban. He was there for 12 years." He says, and Draco knows this. Sirius Black was in Azkaban and he escaped. All Draco knows is people kept saying he was on the Dark Lords side.
"Lovely to see you too, Blaise. And you look wonderful Pansy."
"HARRY JAMES FUCKING POTTER!" He calls before running up the stairs to catch up to him. When he reaches him, which takes 10 seconds because Harry was walking slowly, he grabs Harrys hips to stop him walking and leans close to his back, having to tilt his head up slightly because Harry is a step above him.
A few minutes later there's a quick knock on the door before Hermione walks into the dorm room.
"Did you really mean what you said last night?" Draco asks and Harry opens his eyes to look at Draco.
Harry wakes up and opens his eyes to see Draco watching him carefully. Harry can feel Draco's soft top under his hand and Draco's arm is round his waist, tracing patterns lightly on his back.
"I don't want emotions anymore, Seamus." Harry mumbles and Seamus pulls back slightly to look at Harry.
"I've temporarily adopted a Gryffindor. Be nice." Blaise says to Draco as he sits on the sofa next to him, and Draco looks up, apparently just noticing Harry was in the common room. The second Draco looks at Harry's face his heart breaks. He looks so vulnerable with his red puffy eyes with dark circles under them and the fact that his hoodie sleeves are pulled down over his hands and he looks so small despite the fact that he's hench as fuck and Draco wants to hug him until he's better. But he can't, for obvious reasons.
