“Careful, Teddy, we don’t want you to fall,” Harry says. His steps are secure and robust on the stairs. Draco takes another breath and wipes the tears from his eyes. He can’t have them find him like this in the bathroom, Teddy would just get upset, and that is the last thing Draco wants. He steps into the bedroom just when Teddy opens the door.
“I get why you want to hide away,” Remus continues. “And I won’t force you to go to any of your classes today. But hiding away won’t stop others from talking about you. You will have to face the music. And better sooner than later. You don’t want to give the haters the idea that you’re ashamed of who you are. Because it’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
“Or expelled,” Ron whispers. Hermione gives him a dark look and then shakes her head. She picks up her coffee and snatches the Daily Prophet out of Neville’s hands. “Let’s see what other news there is today,” she says as she opens the paper and starts to scan the headlines.
The fire in the hearth crackles. Harry stares at the flames. It started to snow again this morning when they were at breakfast. The window next to the hearth is covered in white dust. Harry had wanted to go fly some today. Ron was keen to join him, but when the snow started, he backed out. And Harry didn’t want to go alone. He wanted a distraction from his thoughts. And he won’t get that when he goes out all alone. So now he sits in the common room with his friends. Ron and Neville are in front of a chessboard. Hermione sits next to Harry on the sofa with a book on her lap. It’s a normal relaxed Sunday. If only Harry could relax too.
“Yeah, I don’t think so either. And don’t tell daddy, but I’ve been looking into names and I think we should call her Gwyneth. What do you think?” Harry says.
Harry nods. Yes, Draco should go. Not that Harry wants him to go. But it’s time that Harry said out loud what he’s been thinking for months. And he can’t do that when Draco is here to distract him.
After that, he moved on to the second curse, the Cruciatus Curse, which Neville had mentioned. Moody enlarged the next spider and then muttered Crucio. The spider’s legs bent in upon its body, it rolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side. And over time the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently. It was then that Hermione shouted at Moody to stop it. I looked at her and saw she wasn’t looking at the spider but at Neville, who’s hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white. Later Ron told us that Neville’s eyes had been wide and horrified. Moody shook his head and stopped the curse and put that spider away. Moody said that this curse was once very popular too, that Mr Malfoy’s aunt liked performing it and that he hoped that he could teach young Mr Malfoy one day how it feels. I hated the way Moody was picking on Draco, but I didn’t know what to do against it.
Professor Snape had told Nott to use a spell called Serpensortia. The end of his wand exploded and a long black snake shot out of it. The snake landed in front of me, ready to attack. Professor Snape was just about to get rid of it, seeing I was frozen in place when Professor Lockhart stepped in and managed to only make it fly through the air. The snake was now hissing furiously at Justin Finch-Fletchley. And I don’t know why I did it, I can’t even remember deciding to do it, but I walked towards the snake and told him to leave him alone. And the snake slumped to the floor, and I knew it wouldn’t hurt anyone now. I looked up at Justin expecting him to be grateful, but he was angry and scared. He screamed: ‘What do you think you’re playing at?’ and stormed out of the hall. Everyone was muttering around me and Professor Snape looked at me with a shrewd and calculating look.
“None of your business, brother. Just like it’s none of Angela’s business if it’s true or not,” George answers.
“Are you okay, dear?” Andromeda asks. Draco shakes his head and Andromeda puts down the decoration she was just about to put on Teddy’s cake. Her arm slides around Draco’s waist, and she pulls him close. “I know, you don’t have to explain,” she says. Draco lets her touch and soft words comfort him. “I used to look at Ted and Nymphadora like that, hoping against hope that our family would grow sooner than later. I hope your story will have a happier end then mine,” Andromeda finishes. Draco puts his arm around his aunt's shoulders and whispers a thank you in her ear.
After this, we took a coach, that gets pulled by invisible horses, to the castle. I saw two more Dementors standing guard on either side of the wrought iron gates. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf me again, so I leaned into Draco’s side, who tightened his hold on me, and whispered in my ear that it was okay, that he was there and it would all be okay.
I slept alone that night.  The next morning I skipped breakfast but received a letter from my father.
“I know.”  I tucked one hand under my head and brought the other one cup his neck.  “And you’re the only one in my life.”  He smiled brilliantly.
"You're the first person from Harry's past he's introduced us to," Cole laughed, nudging Harry in the ribs. Harry swatted him away with a goofy smile. Draco smiled, his heart fluttering slightly. I'm the first? Before Hermione, or Ron, or Ginny? Draco was so caught up analysing those few words he didn't realise Harry's blush getting darker.
“Let’s not talk about that though.”  Harry pressed another kiss to my lips with a smile.  All thoughts of the dog disappeared from my mind as my focus turned to his very soft lips.  “I’m just so happy to see you.  Especially after the day I had,” He chuckled.  I raised a brow.
“Before we begin today’s lesson,” said Snape, sweeping over to his desk and staring around at all of us.  “I think it appropriate to remind you that next June you will be sitting an important examination, during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions.”  Half the class groaned quietly, knowing it would not be the last time they would hear this same speech.  “Moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are, I expect you to scrape an ‘Acceptable’ in your O.W.L., or suffer my . . . displeasure.”  His gaze lingered this time upon Neville, who gulped.
“Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?”  The air in the room stood still.  Pansy and I shared a short glance before watching the mess in front of us unfold.
"Well, she's not entirely wrong, you know," Draco muttered before taking a long sip of his drink while Harry slapped his arm. "Hey!"
your footsteps in case you step out of line.”  He flinched slightly, seeming to restrain himself from either punching me or kissing me.  I hoped it was the latter but knew it likely wasn’t.
“Wanna head up to the library after dinner and get started on that moonstone essay?” Pansy asked through a mouthful of mashed potatoes.
“So, you never told me how that meeting went,” Pansy asked quietly over the table.  I sighed and picked at the food on my plate.
When they got to Draco's room, Harry gently sat him on his bed and noticed — Draco was still completely dressed.  He cursed silently, realising he'd have to help the drunk man out of his clothes.
Draco knew that this time, Harry had definitely seen him. He saw the slight shock cover his face and his grip on the mic falter for a split second. Harry knew, but he didn't let on. There was nothing in his performance to suggest what he was thinking other than the brief moment of shock. He whipped around to sing the bridge, although sing might be generous for the way he roared into the microphone.
“Listen.”  I raised my hands as Blaise raised his eyebrows.  “I’m not sure how much longer we’re going to play this game, but it won’t be long.  When it is over for good, tell her.”  His brow furrowed.
“Tell me, Potter,” said Snape softly, “can you read?”  I couldn’t help it anymore and I let out a small laugh.  Harry shot a glare my way.  I tried to give him an apologetic smile, but I ended up laughing again.
“For how long?” I whispered.  I almost didn’t want to speak out of fear of ruining the perfect moment — Harry’s head resting on my chest, our bodies pressed together, legs tangled and my chin resting on his mop of hair.  The sun was beginning to set later now and we were able to enjoy the sunsets together.  The distant scent of flowers beginning to bloom danced through the air.
“Here.”  I held my hand out.  Harry stared at it for a moment before tentatively taking it.  “Now stay very close.”  He nodded and smiled.  I led us through the forest, following the vines until we reached the slight tunnel.
“Very well.  Thank you, Lucius, for your work today.”  My father nodded curtly as Voldemort left the room.  We continued standing in unsettled silence until my mother returned to her spot on the sofa.  I tried to keep my mind off of my new knowledge of the Dementor attack, knowing Voldemort would likely be interested in my thoughts at this time.  I felt vicious pangs of guilt every time I agreed to Voldemort’s questions.
“Yeah, yeah, I know.”  I looked up and watched Harry for a moment again.  My heart sank, knowing that might be one of the last smiles I’d see on his face in a while.  Despite the chatter and laughter filling the Great Hall, Dumbledore’s words from last night still hung in the air, a dark reminder of a new era we were too young for.  I heard whispers in the manor — plans of attack, plans against Hogwarts, against
“Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully,” said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness.
A few weeks later, I packed my school robes into my trunk when I received a letter from Hogwarts no doubt with a book list my mother would have to go out to purchase. I quickly opened the letter and read over the book list — nothing interesting or new. There was, however, a second page.
“Not at all,” She said sharply before marching back to our compartment.  The three remained exactly how we left them, Blaise awkwardly staring out the window as Crabbe and Goyle leaned towards each other in rapid conversation.  I sat next to Blaise and Pansy across from us.
"In that heat, I thought we would burn,"  Draco's heart quickened at the sound of Harry's low voice.  "All the lesson we were supposed to learn, quickly faded 'way in that war, I wish I knew who you were."  Harry clenched his jaw in between lines, letting the power of the music take hold of him.
“Seven oaks…”  I muttered, walking along the treeline.  “That does me a whole lot of good. What does an oak tree even look— oh.”  I stopped in front of an unusually large tree and looked into the forest.  Sure enough, six equally large trees followed it.  I looked back towards the castle.  The largest tree at the edge was just past the lake, just far enough to not attract attention.
"Jeez Jasp, how many rounds have you already had?" As they reached the bar, Harry dropped Draco's wrist.
“Ready?” Harry asked, lining himself up.  Draco tensed slightly and nodded.  Harry noticed and shifted over Draco, placing a soft kiss on the corner of his mouth.  “I’ve got you,” He whispered.  Draco nodded and Harry shifted his hips forwards.  He lightly trailed kisses along Draco’s neck as he gently pushed in and waited until Draco relaxed.  “I’ve got you,” He whispered again, close to Draco’s ear, causing him to shiver.  “Just tell me when.”
“He looks tense,”  Pansy mumbled through a bite of toast.  Granger started pestering him and he just glared at her.
"Right. This is an old classmate, Ma— Draco." Draco's stomach did a small flip when Harry said his name. He had always been Malfoy. He wracked his brain for any other time Harry had called him that but —
“Dray, I’ve told you, I’ve done the best that I can in preparation.  I don’t know what the task is.  I’ve done the best I can, so has Hermione and Ron.”  He squeezed my hand gently and smiled.
“Good morning students.  As you all know by now, we sadly lost one of our own yesterday at the conclusion of the Triwizard Tournament, Cedric Diggory.  We understand that this is a difficult time for us all, but we ask that you do not pester our other champion, Harry Potter, about the events that transpired in the maze.  Support will be provided to anyone who reaches out.  Thank you.”  He spoke slowly and clearly.  The hall remained in silence after he finished before a few students shuffled out.  I went through the rest of the day in a haze.  Pansy stayed with me throughout the day as I wandered around the castle and grounds.  Rumours flew about the school about what really happened to Diggory — acromantula attack, poison darts, even that one of the other champions did it.
"Really Malfoy?"  Harry tries not to smile but ultimately fails when seeing the joy on Draco's face.  Draco watched him in his drunken stupor, his eyes cloudy.
“Good luck Draco.  We’re proud of you, always.”  My father smiled down at me.  I nodded.  The platform was crowded now, bustling with parents wishing their children well and siblings begging to accompany their brothers and sisters to Hogwarts.  Crabbe and Goyle had already found each other, bumbling along with their fathers.  They held a newly found arrogance about them and I mentally cursed having to spend another year alongside them.  Blaise was being fussed at by his mother and looked distastefully around the Platform.  Soon, a swarm of red-heads bustled in, along with Hermione and Harry, and a large, bearlike black dog.  My father sneered at the sight of it.  “That
When we arrived at the Common Room, I kissed Pansy's head, much to Blaise's dislike, and headed up to my room.  After I changed, Blaise barged in and slammed the door.
"Malfoy, there's a chippys like a block away.  You can walk."  Draco huffed, putting on his own jacket and following Harry.  They walked in silence for a few minutes until they reached a kebab shop.  Draco scrunched his nose.
“I know.”  Harry stepped forward and pulled me into a gentle hug.  “I know.  I’ll be here for you.”  I buried my head into Harry’s shoulder.  “I love you Draco.  This doesn’t change anything.”  I nodded feebly into his shoulder.  We silently held each other until the sunset.  “We need to go back.”  Harry gently pulled away.  ”We both need to sleep.  We both need to eat.  Come on.”  He gently placed his hand on my cheek.  I leant into his touch, knowing it may well be the last time I see him for a few months.  He smiled softly, pressing a chaste kiss to my lips.  “Come on,” He whispered.
"Draco," He whispered.  Harry gently placed his hand on Draco's shoulder, taken aback by the tenseness Draco held.  "Hey."  He cautiously pulled Draco to face him.  Draco's cheeks were still flushed slightly and a few drops of water resided along his hairline.  His brows were pulled together and mouth tight.  Harry stared into his eyes, trying to figure out what made Draco suddenly uneasy.  "What's wrong?"  Draco stared back indelicately, his eyes steely and searching.  Grey met green and, in that split second, Draco made a decision.
“Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school, and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation and decay.”  The crowd began to grow restless.  Pansy let out a few long, heavy sighs and Crabbe and Goyle began chatting quietly.  “There again, progress for progress’s sake must be discouraged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. A balance, then, between old and new, between permanence and change, between tradition and innovation, because some changes will be for the better, while others will come, in the fullness of time, to be recognized as errors of judgment. Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned. Let us move forward, then, into a new era of openness, effectiveness, and accountability, intent on preserving what ought to be preserved, perfecting what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited.”  As she sat again, Dumbledore began clapping, followed by the rest of the staff table and a few random students.  I followed suit if only to maintain a precedent set by Prefect status.
“Come on, you.”  We walked the rest of the way down in relative silence.  The crowd quickly filled the stadium.  The Quidditch Pitch was overtaken by dark green growth forming a maze.  Despite the excited crowd, I felt nearly sick to my stomach.
“Merlin, Draco,” Harry mumbled, looking over Draco again.  He couldn’t take his eyes off Draco’s porcelain form, looking positively delicious in the soft golden light.  Harry gently spread Draco’s legs, gently massaging his thighs to calm the now tensing Draco.  “It’ll be okay, I promise.”  Harry smiled.  Draco nodded and watched Harry’s careful movements.  Harry took out a bottle of lube from his bedside table and Draco snorted.
“Hermione!”  Ron rushed forward to help her, dragging her hand away from her face to show her growing teeth.  This couldn’t have gone worse.
“Fine!”  She yelled.  “Fine Draco. You know what?”  She poked my chest.  “You should go now.”  She winked as I stood up.
“I promise.”  He pulled me back to where we were sitting.  “Now come sit back down, and tell me about you.”  He smiled and sat back down, not letting go of my hand.  I joined him on the ground.
“Thank you, father.” For once, we looked like a normal, happy family — two parents beaming at their son who has just been given a great honour. As if the Dark Lord wasn’t inhabiting our West Wing.
Harry paused a moment as his eyes graze Draco’s abdomen, gut sinking at the sight of the long, jagged scars.  He slowly raised his hand to trace a long one, starting at Draco’s left hip and reaching his right collarbone.  Draco’s breathing slowed at the gentle touch.
"Don't worry about it. I understand." Draco finished off his drink and eyes the next round of shots, wary of the consequences. He had already drank quite a bit with Pansy before seeing Harry's band, and the shots and VK Harry had passed him were already taken effect. Why do I have to be a lightweight? "All I was trying to say is that I've spent a lot of time growing up in the past year. A lot of self-discovery." Harry nodded and turned back to the bar, ordering more drinks. Draco paused, assessing if he could handle it, assessing if Harry should even be ordering more, before remember, ah yes Harry was performing and likely hadn't already been drinking, unlike Draco who was tipsy when the night started, a few hours before Harry's set. Might as well, he eventually decided. I'm bound to fuck up tonight, at least with alcohol I'll have an excuse, or maybe I won't even have to remember.
"This song is for an old classmate,"  Harry laughed, thinking about the context.  Every time he announced the song, he felt a pang of guilt in his stomach.  He never talked to Draco after his trial, not even to check if he was okay.  He just walked away from the Ministry that night, and a few weeks later, from the whole of the wizarding world.  But he also didn't regret leaving.  Patronus was one of the best things to happen to him.
“An animagus.  I only have my suspicions, but it is odd that it appeared as a stray in Hogsmeade shortly after Sirius Black escaped, and now it accompanies Potter and party, especially that Lupin.  Odd indeed.”
The past months collapsed around me.  We stood there for what felt like an eternity, staring into each other’s eyes.  A few stray tears ran down Harry’s reddened cheeks.  I wanted to reach out and wipe them and kiss him and told him everything was okay.  That nothing would change.  That we could stay exactly where we were and would never have to leave.  That I loved him.  I wanted to take him in my arms and never let go.  Most of all, I wanted to punch my bastard father in the face.
"Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove," Harry sang softly, turning his head just enough to meet Draco's eyes.  "And feeling like someone in love."  Draco flushed even darker, even the tips of his ears turning pink at Harry's dreamy smile.  The record slowed to a stop, light static buzzing from the speakers, but neither man moved for a moment.
About a week and a half before the last task, I received a letter from my father, shorter and curter than the last one.  He noted that if all were to go to plan, then great times were coming.  Despite reading the message over multiple times, I still could not understand what he was talking about.  I decided not to tell Harry or Pansy about it, worried that it had something to do with my father’s love of the Dark Arts.  The last thing I needed right now was my father’s interests to get in between Harry and I and the new future I was carving out.
I screamed at the professor to turn him back, but the professor just asked me if Draco got me. I didn’t understand and stated again that he should turn Draco back to himself. Draco, as a ferret, ran towards me and I knelt down to pick him up, but the professor pointed his wand at Draco again and he flew ten feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor and then bounced upward once more. I screamed for the professor to stop, to leave Draco alone, that he didn’t do anything, that it was just a silly fight, that I love him and that Draco didn’t try to attack me. Only the professor didn’t seem to hear me and just made Draco bounce higher and higher. He was squealing in pain and I didn’t know what to do to stop the professor from hurting Draco.
Harry and Neville bend over the table too. Their heads are close together when Neville says: “It’s been fine all year. Everyone loves Professor Lupin.”
Draco shakes his head. If this is the end, he wants it to be over. He can’t walk around with his dead baby inside him for weeks. He just can’t.
Viktor promised to look after him while I got the headmaster. I ran back to the castle and up the stairs towards the headmaster's office. And just when I reached the stone gargoyle it opened and professor Snape stepped out. He wanted to know what I was doing there and I told him all about how Viktor and I found Mr Crouch in the forest and that he looked mad and wanted to talk to the headmaster. Professor Snape told me to calm down and explain myself clearly. So I took a deep breath and told Snape all about Mr Crouch. And just when Professor Snape said we should get headmaster Dumbledore the gargoyle moved again. The headmaster stepped out and as soon as Professor Snape told him I found Mr Crouch we all set off towards the forest.
Only Draco doesn’t look up. His shoulders shudder. And Harry can’t have that. He steps off his bed and walks to the other side of the room. He stops in front of Draco’s bed. Draco cries and Harry wants to hug him. Harry lifts his arm and reaches out. Softly he ticks on Draco’s shoulder.
And then Harry says Draco’s name. Draco has to swallow away a lump in his throat and then nods. He sits down in the chair next to Hermione’s bed and takes little Rose from her arms. Her eyes are brown, the same colour as Hermione. Some small tufts of red hair sit on her head, and she looks so peaceful. All sounds around Draco seem to disappear while he watches the tiny baby in his hands. Draco’s vision starts to blur, and he thinks his arms begin to shake. It isn’t until a large tear falls onto Rose and she gives a single cry that Draco notices he’s crying.
“Yeah, this is good,” Draco mumbled, pulling Harry’s head up to look him in the eye.  Harry’s cheeks were dark and lips swollen, glasses crooked and hair sticking to his forehead and neck.  Draco chewed on his bottom lip at the sight of the absolutely messily gorgeous man, whose hands were now tickling the soft skin just above Draco’s waistband.  Draco smiled and placed a soft kiss on the corner of Harry’s mouth, just as Harry’s fingers slipped into his waistband.  Harry pulls Draco closer, though he wasn’t sure they could get much closer.  Their chests heaved in unison, pressed together, a strong heat rising between them.  Their soft kisses grew messy, teeth clashing and hands running wild against hot skin.  Between deep breaths, their hips found a rhythm, until the room filled with their messy sounds.
“A fantastic way to draw attention to himself. It’s as if he’s looking to get caught.” He snorted. “I doubt he’ll be allowed back in Hogwarts this year.”
“I’m proud to represent Slytherin House as a Prefect this year. Besides that, I’m not excited to be returning to that joke of a school.” Voldemort smiled slowly.
“Right,” I laughed, shaking my head.  “Look, Harry’s been in detention for a while now, I assume he’ll be out soon.”
Draco ran his delicate hands up Harry’s warm, broad chest, sighing again at the peace settling in his stomach.  They’d only been together for just over a month, finally getting together after months of meeting for drinks after work and oblivious flirting.  The first ‘date’ went as well as anyone could have predicted — both men were incredibly awkward through the dinner until Harry kissed Draco on his doorstep.  From then on, they were almost never apart.  They spent nearly every night together as Harry introduced Draco to muggle movies.  Tonight, Harry had chosen Stars Wars but got distracted halfway through by how absolutely stunning Draco looked in that new turtleneck of his.  He could hardly keep his hands off him throughout the film and wasted no time when the end credits finally rolled.
“Check it out,”  Blaise beamed.  I picked up the pin reading “SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY — THE REAL HOGWARTS CHAMPION”.
"What are you doing?"  Harry asked, staring at him.  Draco looked up from his book and raise an eyebrow.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” He began, his voice lacking it’s usual exciting lilt.  The crowd softened to a slight murmur.  “Would all students please quickly and quietly return to their respective dorms?  Hogwarts Head Boys and Girls please make sure everyone is accounted for.  Staff is asked to report to the Great Hall.  Thank you.”  The crowd silently began moving in sync back towards the castle.  Pansy intertwined our fingers, hanging her head as we walked back.  My breathing hadn’t quite recovered yet.  My head swam.
She was wrong. It didn’t get easier. Eating next to the Dark Lord would never get easier. Dinners never got less tense; every so often, Voldemort attempted conversation, asking sneakily personal questions. The snake, constantly at our feet, acted as though it could sense fear. My parents functioned in stiff formalities, likely under the same assertion that Voldemort had ears throughout the house. I locked myself in my room most days, opting to stare out the window, stare at the ceiling or stare at the pages of a book I couldn’t focus on. I wished I could contact Harry or even Hermione. He was back with that terrible muggle family for the summer. They probably didn’t even know who Voldemort was, or that Harry was nearly killed multiple times this year, or that he watched one of his friends die. He couldn’t owl Weasel or Hermione. He was alone.
No part of the house was safe in fact. The Dark Lord’s presence seeped into every nook and crevasse of the house; every chair felt like stone and every bed like a cot; despite the many fireplaces throughout the house, every room remained freezing and dimly lit. The heart that once filled the great manor was slowly dying with each day. It took its toll on my mother. Despite keeping her head high and back straight, I could see the strain on her body. Her eyes were dark, covered skillfully with makeup, and tired, lacking the loving shine I grew up with. My father was stiffer, more agitated than I’d ever seen him. My mother and I were often dismissed from the dinner table, leaving him alone with the Dark Lord. The time spent alone with him seemed to be draining my father.
“I’m not!  I swear!”  She said loudly.  I snickered as I looked over my shoulder to see Hermione looking back at us.
“Yeah, the sun’s practically set.  Come on, let’s walk back.”  We walked back to a side entrance in comfortable silence.  Just before we reached the door, Pot—
But my parents.  My mother still lived in the same house as the bastard.  If I spoke one word out of line, she’d be tortured or killed.  My father would lose everything — his son, his wife, his power, even his life.  I can’t be responsible for them.
"Yeah, yeah, thank you, Harry."  This time, Draco was more conscious of using his first name,  letting it roll off his tongue slowly.  Harry paused.  It was odd to hear his name in Draco's mouth.  It sounded softer than when Hermione would snap it or Ron call it.  Draco made it sound almost like a song in a way Harry was unfamiliar with.
“Like them, Potter?”  I shouted as Harry approached.  “And this isn’t all they do — look!”  I pressed the pin to change the message.  The other Slytherins around me also pressed their pins, howling with laughter.  Harry turned bright red.
“Thank you.  I know that you believe me and you’re on my side.  I just wish everyone else would believe me too.  They’re all in danger if they stay ignorant.”
“Make sure to cast a silencing charm,” He grumbled.  Pansy flashed him a devious smile before sitting next to me on the bed.
“An old rhyme my mum used to tell me.  Trees and vines.”  I laughed, watching Harry stare at the enclosure in awe.
“It is my belief — and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken — that we are all facing dark and difficult times.  Some of you in this Hall have already suffered directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort.  Many of your families have been torn asunder.  A week ago, a student was taken from our midst.
We walked back separately, but I wanted nothing more than to stay exactly as we were, holding each other in silent warmth, the last bit we might feel of each other for a long time.  The Common Room was empty when I returned, allowing me to slip into my room.
“Don’t stay up too late.  You need to sleep.”  I pressed a gentle kiss to his head.  He sighed heavily and pulled away enough to look at me.
Draco sighed softly as Harry stroked his hair and let his eyes close.  Harry admired his features while soothing him — his nose was straight and sharp, turning up ever so slightly at the end; his eyes almond-shaped and framed by ashy brown lashes that nearly kissed his sharp cheekbones; Harry had never noticed the light freckles that formed constellations across his cheeks; his lips were soft pink and parted slightly, letting out soft breaths as Harry moved his hands through his soft hair.  Draco opened his eyes after a few minutes, gazing at Harry with soft grey eyes and his lips curling at the corners ever so slightly.
“Wow, Potter.  I didn’t think you could get any worse at potions.”  I turned my sneer to Harry and placed my hand on the table.  He lazily glared back, looking dead inside.  I held myself back from grabbing his collar and pulling him into a kiss right then and there.  Instead, my sneer softened slightly, enough for him to quirk a brow.  “You never cease to amaze me.”  I winked as I left the note on the table.  A small smile flickered on Harry’s lips as he slipped his hand over the note and into his pocket.  I stole another glance at his potion as I passed, instantly regretting it.  I continued making my own potion, helping Pansy along so she wouldn’t completely flunk the first day until Snape began drawling again.
"This place?"  He scoffed.  "It's entirely red inside!  Surely their food can't be that good."  The man behind the counter heard Draco and shot him a quick glare.
A tall, thin, pale man slipped quietly into the room. His black robes billowed around him like a dementor. A long, thick dark green snake slithered at his feet. I brought myself slowly to meet his stare. Piercing scarlet eyes stared back into mine — death. It took all my will to continue standing and staring back. I pushed the fear down and held up my chin. To survive, I had to play the game. My father was proud to serve the Dark Lord, and he expected me to be as well. Voldemort glided across the room to me, an evil but curious grin growing as he approached me.
“You're oblivious, aren't you! He can't take his eyes off of you most of the time! I catch him sometimes.”  I scrunched my brow.
“Ah, sir. Respectful. Step aside, Narcissa. Let me get a proper look at him.” My mother dropped my hand and stepped backwards, leaving me standing alone in front of Voldemort. He began slowly circling me, the snake following his bare feet. “Do you befriend Mudbloods?”
"But fuck the years gone by, I got nothing left to say. Believe me, I never cried." Harry tried to resist the urge but ended up staring right at Draco as he sang the last line. "But I wish there was a way." Draco felt shivers down his spine. Did he mean that... to me? Harry tore his gaze away from Draco again to finish out the last chorus. Draco remained though, stupefied by Harry's stage presence and fire behind his eyes when he sang to Draco. His breath was lodged permanently in his throat, sweat causing his shirt to stick to his back — he couldn't tell if it was the closeness of the crowd or the fire Harry stared at him with. He couldn't pay attention to the rest of the song, eyes transfixed on Harry's near erratic dancing. As the song finished, Harry tossed his fist into the air, earning a roar from the crowd.
Harry turns and walks out of the Great Hall. If nobody is going to help him, he’ll do it alone. Not that Harry has any clue on how he’s going to help Malfoy. But that won’t stop him.
And it isn’t just Draco’s father that was upset by the picture and the story that went with it. No, you won’t believe the amount of hate mail we’ve both received. Most of it was for Draco, saying how he dragged their precious ‘Boy who lived’ down into the mud, and stuff like that. In the end, we made it into a game with all our friends to find the worst insults. Greg was good at reading them out loud and making it sound like serious letters. And Luna made them all sound like love letters instead of hate mail. We had a fun afternoon going through them all. But the best were the few letters of people supporting us and telling us that we should hold on to our love and not let the world get us down.
“Yeah,” Harry says with a tearful voice. He scrapes his throat. “I can’t seem to stop it. He’s always on my mind.”
“They're taunting each other,” he signs. Neville’s buying them time so Harry can come up with something to get Draco to safety. Harry flickers a quick look at Pettigrew’s face. He drops his hands as he sees that the man stares at him.
The silver light and strange liquid or gas (I’m still not sure what it was, it looked like light made liquid and like wind made solid at the same time) was fascinating. I couldn’t keep my eyes from it, and neither could Draco. We bent over the basin and looked into the liquid. I expected to see the bottom of the basin, but instead, we saw a room. And then my nose toughed the liquid and I was pulled into the room. Draco followed me and we both ended up on a bench next to headmaster Dumbledore. I tried to talk to him, but Draco told me he couldn’t hear me, that we were pulled into a memory and could only observe.
It had been beautiful. Harry wishes he had recorded it so he could listen to it one last time, the song Draco wrote just for him. Instead, the piano disappears and Harry falls on his knees on the empty spot.
“Why not?” Draco spits out. “Just because I said I love you, doesn’t mean I agree with your worldview.”
But back to the prediction. We had to go and drink tea and then read each other's tea dregs. I first took a look at Draco’s, which told us he was going to suffer but be very happy about it. He joked that it was always a hardship to be with me, that I made him suffer every minute I wasn’t around, but that he never been this happy in his entire life, so it was all good. Hermione told us to stop being gross, that not everyone wants to know about our sappy love life.
I walked back to the Great Hall together with Professor Snape, who told me that he will not tolerate beds not being used and that he doesn’t want to get any complaints from Nott and Crabbe this year. So Draco takes my cloak with him to bed at night and once Nott and Crabbe are dozing off he sneaks into my bed and hugs me close.
“And I want you to live,” Harry says. “I need you to live, so I can keep breathing. Please Draco, try to live again.”
The Knight Bus doesn’t have normal seats, instead, it’s filled with half a dozen brass bedsteads. Once I set down on mine the bus took off with another loud bang. It threw me back flat on my bed because of the speed of the bus. I felt really nervous on the bus. The driver, Ernie wasn’t a very good one. We kept mounting the pavement, only the bus didn’t hit anything. Everything jumped out of the way of the bus as it approached and back into position once it had passed.
Draco is silent. Not like his usual silence because he doesn’t talk. And that is another thing that keeps Harry’s mind occupied. He still doesn’t know if Draco can talk, or even make sounds. He read in a book that sometimes children get born deaf and mute, but the lack of sounds can also be because they can’t hear and they just never learn to make sounds in the way others do. It doesn’t matter, of course. He and Draco have been communicating just fine without using spoken words. They sign more and more, as Draco is improving quickly. And when signs don’t work, they write stuff down. It’s how Harry learnt that Draco has good humour, and also takes his studies more seriously than anyone else Harry knows. Even more seriously than Hermione, and Harry never thought that was possible. The lack of sounds is not an issue.
I had been so excited to go here. I don’t know why I thought everything would be better when I would be around other wizards, that I would be able to make some friends. Well, I think I made one friend at least, even though I haven’t seen him since the sorting ceremony. I met him after Uncle Vernon had left me at the train station. I didn’t know how to get onto platform nine and three-quarters and I was afraid to be stranded there. And then I saw some people that looked like they were also going to Hogwarts, with trunks and an owl. They helped me get onto the platform. I had to run at the barrier and I really thought I was going to crash into it. But the crash never came and when I opened my eyes I was at a platform next to a scarlet steam engine. Two of the boys from that family, Fred and George helped me get my trunk on the train. And when the train was on his way, Ron, their younger brother came to sit with me in my compartment. He has a lot of brothers and he’s afraid he won’t do as good as his brothers. I’m sure he will. One of his brothers works with dragons in Romania and his other brother is in Africa. Oh, and he has a rat, named Scabbers. That reminds me, I’ve named my owl Hedwig. I hope you like the name. I think it suits her.
We walked on in silence again after that. The path became almost impossible to follow and the blood seemed to be getting thicker. And when we reached a clearing I could see something bright white gleaming on the ground. We inched closer and saw that it was the unicorn. It was already dead, but it was still beautiful. I took a step toward it and then we heard the slithering sound again. We both froze on the spot and looked to the spot where the sound had come from. A hooded figure came crawling across the ground and started to drink the unicorn’s blood. Draco screamed, it was a terrible sound and I turned quickly to look at him. He was as white as a ghost and he reached out his arm to grab my hand and started pulling me away from the clearing. Before we started running I looked back and saw that the hooded figure had raised its head and was looking right at me. A horrible pain pierced my head then like my scar was on fire. I staggered a little until Draco pulled on my hand, making me turn back to him and we ran.
DADA is different. Malfoy tries to sit in the back and just read the textbook, only Professor Lupin (who Harry by accident calls Uncle Remus in their first lesson) has a more hands-on approach than his predecessor Lockhart. Remus asks everyone to take out their wands and practice the Riddikulus incantation with him before he takes them to a cupboard holding a Boggart. It is clear that Malfoy doesn’t understand what is going on. He squishes his eyebrows together and he glances around the classroom.
Harry shakes his head. “You’re going to forget half the time, aren’t you,” he says. “To act like our teacher and not our uncle.”
“Well, I’ve never seen a blue cow. And I’m sure that if they exist, that no Muggle has ever seen them. You should ask Luna the next time she’s over if there are blue cows. I’m sure that she will know.”
“I think it’s wonderful,” Luna answers. She takes the feather and tickles Ginny with it. Harry just shakes his head and continues his breakfast. Luna gives him back the feather and then takes off with her hand linked with Ginny’s.
Again the word guilty rolls of Harry’s tongue. She deserved it. Draco trusted her. Was happy when she reached out to him. But she betrayed him.
The other champions first thought I was sent in to deliver a message. And then Mr Bagman entered the room. He took me by my arm and said it was extraordinary and introduced me as the fourth champion. I was vaguely aware that Fleur and Bagman had a discussion, but I didn’t really hear what they were saying. I was still in shock. Mrs Davis says that this was very normal, to be in shock like that after what happened. I’ve been to see her again, even though we agreed at the end of last year that maybe I could do without our regular visits. Draco said I should go see her, talk about what happened.
Riddle his smile just broadened. He said I wouldn’t need my wand. And that he’d waited a long time for this, for the chance to see me and to speak to me. I told him we could speak later, that we now first had to get Draco to the hospital wing. But Riddle didn’t care. He said we were going to talk now. Something was wrong and I looked again at Draco, wondering out loud how he had gotten like this.
It was worst between Marcus and Wood, the captain of the Gryffindor team. They throw hexes at each other every time they saw each other. At one moment Wood treated to hurt me or Draco and ever since then Marcus made sure there were always people protection us. It made it hard to show up to classes on time.
“I’m jealous, too, silly,” Harry says. “Fuck, you know how badly I want a family of our own. You have any idea how hard it was to wait patiently until you were ready to try again? And how fucking hard it is to be patient until it’s our time now when my best friends stop birth control and fall pregnant within a month. I wanted to destroy their kitchen and hug them at the same time.”
He turns on the coffee machine in the staff room and waits. He looks at the schedules on the wall. He’s on-call this coming weekend. So maybe, he shouldn’t. But fuck no. He won’t find an excuse to not do it. He will do it today. He made a promise to himself. Before the end of this month. So that means today. He’s twenty-eight. He can do this. It’s no big deal.
“Because you love her,” Harry says. It’s unfair. James and Lily got to be together and in love. Sirius has Remus. And Ron and Hermione are getting closer by the day. Why can’t Harry have that? Why doesn’t the person that he loves, love him back? He should stop his thoughts from drifting to Draco all the time. Maybe then he will be able to enjoy his family a little before he has to go back to school. “I’m getting my broom and going for a short fly before dinner,” he says. He stands and turns towards the shed, leaving his father alone on the bench, hoping he won’t worry too much about Harry’s broken heart.
With dread, Harry pulls a piece of parchment out of his bag and starts to write. ‘You want me to read this?’ he asks.
The door at the end of the carriage opens and something slides inside. A creature with a hood moves closer as the air around Harry seems to freeze. What is a Dementor doing on the train to Hogwarts? Do they think Pettigrew is on it? Will he be on his way to Hogwarts to try to avenge his master by finishing the job that killed Voldemort? Is Neville in danger? Neville is in one of the carriages from where the Dementor came. Maybe something might have already happened to him. And what about Uncle Remus? Neville was on his way to get him. Are they still alive? They are probably dead. And little Iris, still defenceless with her limited control over her magic. What if Pettigrew found her first? Will Harry be the only child returning to their parents tonight? It will destroy mum if something were to      happen to Iris. She was scared to let her go to Hogwarts with Pettigrew on the loose. James said there was nothing to worry about. Not with Dumbledore at Hogwarts and Uncle Remus as one of her teachers. But it wasn’t enough to keep them safe. Nobody is safe. Pettigrew will kill them all. Harry will be alone in this world.
When we stepped over the threshold into the next room a purple fire sprang up behind us and black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. We were trapped. In the middle of the room was a table with seven differently shaped bottles. There was a riddle on a piece of parchment next to the bottles. Hermione figured it out. She said it wasn’t magical, but logical, like a puzzle. She figured out which bottle held the potion to get us through the black fire and which one would be able to take us back. The one for the black fire only had enough potion left for one person, so I made Hermione go back. That way she could take Ron on one of the broomsticks out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy. I told her to go to the owlery and send Hedwig to headmaster Dumbledore. Hermione dashed at me and threw her arms around me and then she took the potion and walked straight through the purple fire.
“I’ve got you,” Harry kept repeating until a soft moan rose from Draco’s parted lips.  Harry lifted himself up to look Draco in the eye.  He paced himself slowly, taking in every breathy moan Draco made.  Draco’s claves slid around Harry’s back, pulling him close.  Harry groaned and couldn’t help but move faster until Draco gasped suddenly, eyes flying open and chest heaving.  Harry stopped and smirked at the incredibly flustered blond.
“Potter?  Please, he’s oblivious.”  I laughed.  “Also, have we made up from our fight earlier?”  Pansy giggled and wrapped her arms around my neck.
This time Harry crashed into Draco, nearly knocking Draco back before he wrapped his free arm around Draco's waist, drawing them closer.  Draco tentatively placed his hands on Harry's waist as Harry deepened the kiss slightly.  Draco's breath wavered at the unexpected reciprocation before he mustered the courage to run his hands up Harry's chest.  This time when Harry pulled away, he kept Draco's face close.  Their breaths mingled as they slowly opened their eyes, meeting each other's gaze.
“Now can you take this seriously for a moment, or are you going to laugh at the first part of that statement too?”  I crossed my arms as Potter huffed and rolled his eyes.
Five minutes later, I walked down to the Quidditch Pitch with Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle.  The air was light as everyone chatted freely, glad exams were over and thankful for the nice weather.  The sun was warm and most students had changed out of their school robes for more casual clothes.  I looked at Pansy.  She wore her white uniform shirt and—
“I don’t think I can do that, but I can tell you some of the uses of moonstone.”  He laughed lightly into my chest.  I rubbed his back gently as he melted into me.  “Hey, you should get going soon.  It’s late and you’re exhausted.”
"Hey, hey, it's okay.  I promise."  Harry reassured him.  Draco nodded and sniffled.  Harry made them chocolate chip pancakes and hot cocoa topped with whipped cream and cinnamon — like Molly would make that morning.  He was relieved when Draco smiled over the warm mug.
Of course, he didn't show Draco the picture but gently woke him up with a mug of hangover cure.  Draco wouldn't let Harry go to the shelter that day.  Instead, he forced Harry to take him to the pet shop to pick out a bright green collar, plush white bed and more toys than he'd ever seen Dudley open on his birthday.  Draco nearly pranced to the tag machine to get a silver heart-shaped tag with 'Mittens' written in cursive.
“Potter,” I said softly.  He looked up.  His normally bright eyes were dull and red-rimmed as he looked at me.  He simply shook his head and walked past me.  I swallowed thickly.
“We can stand to be a few minutes late, right?”  I unwrapped her arms from my neck.  She paused, listening to the hall before nodding.
There was a spot near the edge of the woods that, if walked through properly, would lead to a pond deep in the forest.  I would, of course, ask her for the exact details, but she would be suspicious of something, and my actions would be watched much more carefully.  Wasn’t there a rhyme she would say?  I walked down to the edge and stared at the tree line.
“I’m… sorry.  I’m sorry for what they did to you and how normal it is for you.  I’m sorry that you grew up without love.  And… and I’m sorry that I was horrible to you these past few years.  I’m… I’m just sorry,” I blurted out.  I could feel Harry’s eyes on me.
I’m not sure how long I stared at the ceiling before I fell asleep, or even if I did fall asleep.  I kept running through our conversation over and over again — the way he said he liked me, the sunset casting its orange glow over us, his smile, his laugh.  I couldn’t wait to see him again.  See him again alone.
“Ah, Draco Malfoy,” he hissed. “A fine boy you have raised Lucius. No doubt he will grow into a great man.” My father nodded, but I could see the flicker of fear in his eyes. “Draco, do you believe in blood purity?” I glanced quickly to my father who nodded sharply.
“HARRY POTTER!”  Dumbledore yelled, glaring at Harry.  He slowly got up and walked to Dumbledore, who simply walked into the small room behind Harry.
But I can't be responsible for an attack against Hogwarts.  For the potential slaughter of children.  For
"Alright.  Let's get you to bed."  Harry gently pulled Draco up, wrapping his arm over his shoulders.  "Come on you,"  Harry laughed as Draco groaned, heaving his body weight onto Harry.  Granted he was quite thin and Harry could've easily just picked him up, but Draco just curled his arm around Harry's neck and leaned against him.  They slowly made their way up the stairs, Draco laughing as he laid his head against Harry's shoulder, causing heat to rise to Harry's face.  Just at the top of the stairs, Draco nuzzled his head against Harry's neck.
"I just, I said that to a girl once. I was reading the Prophet before sixth year, and she asked who 'Harry Potter' was. Said he was a bit of a tosser." Draco shook his head, smiling at Harry.
"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, hearing guitars, like someone in love," He murmured along.  Draco felt his breath hitch listening to Harry.  His voice was softer than when he would dramatically sing to ballads; it was rough, deep and gravelly, contrasting sweetly with Sinatra's smooth as honey vibrato.  Draco couldn't help but be entirely mesmerised by Harry's lips as he sang, the way they shaped around each vowel.  Draco let his head loll to the side as he lazily petted Mittens and watched Harry.  "Sometimes the things I do astound me, mostly whenever you're around me."  Draco smiled lazily as Mittens purred in his lap.
I thanked Merlin that it would be my last dinner in the presence of the Dark Lord. He, however, had no intention in letting it be a quiet meal.
“Like that?” Harry chuckled, moving back up to Draco’s face.  His deep green eyes were hooded slightly and his glasses crooked.  Draco smiled, running his hands to twist in Harry’s long hair.
"Never say never, P— Evans." Harry shot him a thankful glance before grabbing their drinks from the bar. "Remember, we haven't spoken in well over a year." He handed off one of the drinks and Draco downed nearly half of it in one go. Harry raised his eyebrows but raised his own bottle in a silent "cheers" and followed suit.
"Alright, guys! Who's having a good Pride?"  Harry asked the crowd, almost panting from the energy he emitted during the first song.  He could see the crowd a bit better now that his eyes had adjusted to the bright lights.  He smiled as the crowd cheered in response.  He was able to make out some people in the front of the crowd — a lot of glitter, dyed hair, and rainbows.  "Yeah?  Well, I know we're having a great time, isn't that right Jasper?"
“He’s dead!  He’s dead!”  The spectator crowd was silent as the crowd in the front of the maze continued yelling.  “Cedric Diggory is dead!”  A scream in the stand next to us wailed out — Cho Chang had tears streaming down her face.  I let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding as the crowd in front of the maze began shuffling around.  Diggory’s father ran into the crowd as another group moved away.  Chang’s wails were broken with a few more helpless screams of Diggory’s classmates and friends.  Dumbledore, McGonagall, Moody and Snape rushed away with someone in between them all.  The minister stepped up next to Bagman and spoke quickly to him.
“Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn’t it?  The constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your O.W.L. year.  You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory centred, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year.  Copy down the following, please.”
"Pansy," Draco laughed when she came home with all of it.  "I can't wear all of this!  I'll look ridiculous! I do have some dignity left!"
“Hey!”  Harry stood up next to me, and I turned away.  “Hey, look at me!”  He grabbed my arm and turned me around.  “What the Dursleys did to me is not your fault.  Sure, you were a bit of an ass, but we were young and under our parents' influence.  Yeah, I blame you a bit, but you didn’t know any different, and from what I’ve seen in the past few days, you’ve changed.  So it’s okay.”  Harry smiled sweetly.  I took a deep breath.
“Yes, father.” I stood quickly and left the drawing-room. As I returned to my room, I tried to expel every thought of Harry that passed through my mind. That Dementor attack was no accident. Surely the Ministry knew that. Or it was a setup. Harry was smart enough to not cast a Patronus in front of a Muggle. He knows better than to break wizarding law, even if he is the Golden Boy. He wouldn’t cast it if there weren’t a good reason.
"Yeah," He said over his shoulder.  "I'm good."  Draco placed his hands on the edge of the counter and took a deep breath.  Harry quietly walked up behind Draco.
that was the last class!”  Pansy muttered once we were far enough from the classroom.  “She’s a nightmare!”  I chuckled lightly.
"I'm studying Potter."  He looked back down to his book coolly.  Harry watched him before stammering out:
I looked back up at the Goblet of Fire.  Slowly, the cup spat out one more slip of parchment to add with the other three champions.  Dumbledore stood there, staring at the parchment in his hands before calling out the name written on it.
"Pres,"  Harry smirked, passing him a glass of golden liquid.  Draco threw his head back, downing the drink in one gulp, before placing his book on the end table.  Harry refilled the glasses after drinking his own.  Both men hissed at the burn of the Firewhiskey.
“Cedric Diggory,” Everyone said.  I glanced to the Gryffindor table to see Harry proudly lifting his glass, his jaw trembling slightly.  Everyone sat back down as Dumbledore lowered his hands.
That night was long and quiet.  The castle was silent before the year came to an end the next day.  I spent the night staring at the ceiling as I had for weeks now.
“What do you think?” I chuckled half-heartedly.  She sighed softly, watching my face.  I just continued staring at the ceiling.
So there he was, in a questionable venue with a beer in his hand, his hair dyed a faded rainbow, wearing a loose muscle tank and black skinny jeans, staring at the stage with his jaw hanging open.  There was Harry Fucking Potter, standing on a stage with a pansexual flag tied around his neck, singing Panic! at the Disco's iconic bisexual anthem.  And boy, did he look phenomenal.
"First time for everything,"  Draco breathed.  Only, it wasn't the first time he noticed Harry like that — his tan shoulders as he slipped back into his room after a shower, when he'd stretch on his couch and his shirt would ride up enough to show the strip of skin below his navel, the way he'd bite his lip just before asking Draco for help, how his haired had grown to his shoulders now and was usually tied in a messy bun except for at home.  Draco would curse silently each time he'd notice something new about Harry, hating the way he could ignite a pack of butterflies in his stomach.  He'd sip whatever drink was in his hand and turn his attention to anywhere but Harry.
“Maybe you should make me,” I whispered.  I snickered as Harry flushed deeply, unable to come up with a retort.  I sauntered away with a bowtruckle in hand.  Harry joined Hermione and Weasel on the ground a few feet away and I joined Pansy.
“GET OUT!” Draco yells. How dare she turn this around. Pansy never needed Draco. She just liked to use him whenever she’d screwed up. And Draco is sick of it. Of all of it. He’s been nothing but a friend to Pansy in all the years they’ve known each other. And now she’s done the worst thing possible, getting pregnant just to show that she can have what Draco isn’t capable of.
When the crowd comes in for lunch, they all pack away their books and decide to move over to the Gryffindor table, just to make sure nobody makes a fuss off them all sitting together. Draco comes along. Percy gets up to say something about it, but Ron stops him before he even gets a chance. “He’s our friend and he’s not eating alone,” Ron says. Percy backs off, as Fred and George whoop from across the table.
And then last Sunday happened. Everyone was off to breakfast and Malfoy and I were alone in our dormitory. He was sitting on his bed, working on our Potions homework when he suddenly started speaking. He said he hadn’t read through my notebook, he just took it to keep it safe. And that he had seen the invisibility cloak when he was searching for the notebook, and knowing that Nott would destroy that too if he would find it, he hid it as well. I thanked him for keeping them safe. And I also thanked him for finding Snape when I went missing. He looked away then, saying it was nothing. That he should have stopped them in the first place. That he was the one that had started it all in September, and that if he hadn’t this would have never happened. He didn’t say sorry, but I don’t think Malfoy has ever said sorry for anything in his life, but only admitting that he was partly at fold was already a big deal for him.
And this afternoon Marcus walked up to us while we were working on our potions essay to tell me that Professor Snape almost expelled him when he came to ask about my Firebolt. Just because he had said that he didn’t care if I would get thrown off my broom, as long as I caught the Snitch first. He suggested that it maybe was time to order another Nimbus Two Thousand and One if I had the money. But I don’t think I will, I still hope I’ll get my Firebolt back before the next match. I plan to ask Professor Snape about it after every Potions lesson. I’m sure he’ll get sick of me soon enough and give it back.
The next two days I hid away, thanking Myrtle for letting me hang out with her so much. She said it was nice, to have company so often. So I survived the weekend. But then Monday came and somehow they had managed to put Sleeping Draught in some of the snacks I had saved for later. One moment I was eating and the next I was fast asleep. They took me outside in my pyjama and strapped me against a tree. When I woke up I was freezing cold and I had no way of getting loose. I screamed for help only to hear laughter from behind some of the bushes nearby. Nott even screamed: ‘so where is your big bad monster now when you need saving, Scarhead?’
The next day, Hermione pulled me to the library to talk about what happened. She believes I didn’t put my own name in and is worried just like Draco about the fact that somebody might want to kill me. Ron and Neville were with her, and they also agreed I would never have entered. Ron said I would have put Draco’s name in if I’d had the change since I went on and on about how good a candidate Draco would be. This made Draco blush and he kissed me on the cheek, saying Ron was right. Neville tipped in that he thinks I will win, but that he also believes I didn’t put my own name in.
He can hear Harry laugh and Draco knows that he’s muttering now that they always have white wine in the fridge because they aren’t barbarians, as Draco likes to put it himself. Draco fishes out his phone from the pocket of his discarded trousers. He’s got a couple of messages from Pansy, asking him if he’s okay and if he needs to go drinking with her. That she heard from Bill that Hermione and Ron are expecting, and that she will go hex Ron if Draco wants her too. Draco texts back that he’s okay and that she can leave Ron in one piece.
“It was no honour,” Draco says. He stares into the Dark Lord’s red eyes. They darken for a second. But the evil glint in them returns quickly. A creepy grin unfolds on the Dark Lord’s face. It won’t be quick. Draco is going to hurt before it’s all over. But that is okay. He will suffer through it. The reward at the end is worth it.
“It was the only way I would be brave enough to do what was needed. You’re better off without me,” Draco says. Then he grabs his cart and starts to walk away. Harry looks after him. The anger boiling to the surface.
Harry shakes his head. “He’s Draco, not Malfoy,” he says. “And he’s nothing like his dad. He’s smart and funny. And he always knows how to get me to do my homework. And he’s beautiful. When he smiles it’s as if the room lights up. He gets these dimples in his cheeks and I just want to kiss him every time they appear. And I can’t. He will never smile at me again.” Harry sobs and tries to turn away from James.
Nobody answers. Nobody will ever answer him again. Not in the way Draco would do when Harry would lose it. When the pain and wounds of the war would open him up at random moments. When Harry would think life would never get any better.
She lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy. It was like she was carved out of stone. Professor Snape said she was found near the library and I think he wanted to say more, but I couldn’t stay there. She’s petrified. I’m all alone now. So I ran, down the stairs, out the oak doors and over the grass, until I tripped. I didn’t want to get up. Not now I had lost my best and only friend.
Granger doesn’t seem to agree and Draco kind of agrees with her. If Potter hasn’t figured out what he has to do tomorrow, then he’s going to need the help of his smart-ass Mudblood.
“Still annoying,” Harry says. He pulls the Prophet towards him and studies the picture of Pettigrew.
Harry looks at Draco. It’s strange how they can communicate without the need for words. Harry just nods and then turns to Teddy, asks him if he would like to have an extra-long bath tonight.
When I reached the staircase up to the third floor, Hermione was waiting there with Ron, looking around the corner at Peeves, who was bobbing halfway up the stairs, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. I couldn’t believe she brought Ron. How where we supposed to use the cloak with him here?
The door to the dorm opens. Harry doesn’t open his eyes to see who comes in. He has no idea what time it is by now. It must be close to lunch. It’s been a while since Ron and Neville left, rushing off to the first class of the day. They pleaded with Harry to join them. For him to get out of bed. But Harry ignored them. And he will ignore them now. He doesn’t want to talk to anyone. He just wants to be left alone.
“Yes, I did,” Harry says. The soft cries for Hermione were kind of hilarious. Ron says he doesn’t want her in any other way than just friends. But Harry isn’t stupid. The way Ron acted today says it all. He would never volunteer to go to Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop instead of Zonko’s Joke Shop. He doesn’t care about quills at all. It was just that Hermione wanted to go there so badly. Harry didn’t mind. He was fine going wherever, as long as Draco was tagging along. Draco loved Scrivenshaft’s. He got himself some new quills and fresh parchment. He even found parchment that you can reuse. Everything you write on it disappears after a couple of minutes. It’s perfect for when Draco has to explain something. Not that he has to write down everything anymore. He’s made great progress with his BSL. He can follow more and more of what Harry says to him. It’s nice that he doesn’t always have to write down everything. It’s better to be able to look at each other when they speak.
Harry drops his bag and shakes his head. “You didn’t. The miscarriage wasn’t your fault. I never blamed you for it, nobody did.”
Harry stares at the Hufflepuffs. Do they truly believe this is funny? And why haven’t they checked on Neville? The only thing they do is just stand there and laugh. Hufflepuffs are the worst.
“It’s for school. We drew a farm today, and I had blue cows. But Olivia said that cows can’t be blue,” Teddy explains.
In the end, he only made a small cut on my arm and took a little blood. For a short moment, I felt relieved that I wasn’t going to die. But then Wormtail dropped my blood in the potion. It turned white and started to send sparks in all directions. Then there was a white fog that raised from the potion. And then he was there, Voldemort stepped out of the cauldron. He told Wormtail to robe him and then he was standing in front of me. His face was whiter than a skull and he had wide livid scarlet eyes. And his nose was flat as a snake, with slits for nostrils.
“Our position in the ministry strengthens by the day,” Rookwood tells the Dark Lord. “It won’t be long before we can take it over without a fight.”
And it isn’t only the students and teachers that make school suck. I had to go to this crazy wand weighing ceremony for the tournament. And that would have been fine if just Rita Skeeter hadn’t been there. She’s a journalist and she wanted to interview me. Mr Bagman said it was fine, so I kind of had no choice than go along with it. She took me into a broom closet so the others wouldn’t disturb us. And then she took out her Quick-Quotes Quill and started asking me questions. Only the quill didn’t write down anything I said. It just made up things, like that my eyes were filling up with tears when we talked about my parents. We didn’t even really talk about you, so why would I get teary-eyed. And she kept asking me why I entered. I said I hadn’t but she didn’t believe me.
Voldemort wanted to prove to his followers that I was no match for him, so he ordered Wormtail to set me free and give me my wand. It hurt like hell when I had to stand on my broken leg again. I don’t know how I managed it, but I did. Not that it mattered. I knew I was no match for someone like Voldemort. He hit me again and again with the Cruciatus curse. The pain was unbearable. And the feelings I felt through my connection with Draco made it even worse. He was hurting too because of this. He could feel my pain and be unable to stop it.
Harry summons the other broom and goes to fly next to Draco. Very slowly, Draco makes the broom move forwards. His arms shake a little. Harry stays close to him in the hope it gives Draco a feeling of safety.
Ginny shrugs half-heartedly and then bumps her arm against Harry’s. “Luna says Iris is fitting in great, by the way,” she says.
Harry places his arm around Hermione. “It won’t. He likes you too, you know. It’s why he was so upset you went to the bale with Krum.”
At the welcome feast, Hermione and Luna had to part with us to go sit at their own house tables for the rest of the evening. Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean greeted us when they came into the Great Hall, soaked because Peeves had been throwing water balloons in the entrance hall. But their state was better than the first years who looked like they had swum across the lake instead of sailed. The hat sang a song about the founders and then the first years were sorted. I seemed to go on forever and Greg was complaining that he was hungry and that the hat should hurry up.
James lightly shakes his head and smiles. “No, I didn’t,” he says. “She was the woman I wanted to marry. The fact that she didn’t know that yet, didn’t stop me. I wanted her, more than I ever wanted anything in my entire life.”
I couldn’t believe my ears. Draco had been the one to do all that. And he had let the entire school believe that it was me. Why hadn’t he ever said anything?
“Nothing, Ron. We need to go,” Hermione says. She stands up and drags Harry with her. They are out of the portrait hole before Ron can object. Hermione leads them out of the castle before she asks Harry what happened.
It’s then that Theo Nott walked up to me and Ginny, saying nasty things about me like I must enjoy the attention because I’m bent. And then Ginny spoke for the first time in my presence. She told Nott to shut up. Nott laughed at her, saying she’s wasting her time trying to become my girlfriend, that it was not girls I was into. Ron and Hermione had made their way up to us by then, so they heard his statement. Ron told Nott to check his facts, while Hermione pulled on his arm trying to make him stop. I just wanted to slip out the shop unnoticed. This was so embarrassing. Why hadn’t I told Ron about my sexuality, then he wouldn’t have made a fool of himself today. He’s upset about it all and I’ve moved to Fred and George’s room for the night. Mrs Weasley said I shouldn’t worry about it, that Ron will figure out it doesn’t matter and that I’m still the same friend as yesterday when we were having fun in the paddock, just like his brother Charlie had still been the same after he told them all that he was bent. I hope she is right. I would hate to lose a good friend over this.
"Hey little guy,"  Harry mumbled as he picked up the kitten.  "Draco!  Look what I found!"  Harry called as he walked back in.
"Sure."  He sat on the edge of the bed as Harry laid down, giggling, retreating to his own room once Harry was asleep.  He made sure to wake up early to make Harry a hangover cure and silently pray to Merlin Harry didn't remember too much from the night before.
"Come on,"  He muttered, picking Harry up bridal style.  The sleeping man mumbled incoherently and Draco couldn't help but smile.  Just as the reached the top of the stairs, Harry opened his eyes.
“Yes, but they don’t believe him when he says the Dark Lord is back,” She said calmly. It was true — the Prophet refused to print anything about his return. “Last I heard the Minister fervently denied it.”
"Merlin's beard Potter!"  Harry jumped out and rubbed the back of his neck.  "What the — fuck!"  Draco groaned, holding his head.  Foggy memories of the night before popped into his mind.  He remembered the firewhiskey they shared before they went out, having a couple rounds at the first bar, a few rounds of shots at the second and something fruity at the club.  He vaguely remembered stumbling home and Harry bring him up to his room and —
“Nope, come on.”  I pulled him down the corridor and he stifled a laugh.  We shared small glances as we made our way to the Gryffindor tower.  A few times I considered pulling us into an alcove to get a few more minutes alone together.  Yet, we kept going until Harry stopped just before turning down the corridor with the tower.
“And what is all this noise about?”  Said a soft, deadly voice.  Snape pointed a long yellow finger at me and said,  “Explain.”
Close to six, I glance at the Gryffindor table.  Harry was just standing and turning to leave.  A light wave of relief washed over me.  I excused myself a few minutes later and walked the familiar path out to the forest.  A sense of peace filled me as I walked through the trees.  A gentle breeze danced through the air as I pushed back the vines.  Harry was standing by the water, watching the gentle waves.  I took a deep breath, savouring the moment of peace.
After I finished eating, I looked up just in time to see Harry leaving the Great Hall.  I quickly excused myself, saying I left some books in my room before chasing Harry down the hall.
“Now press it.”  I glanced up at Blaise.  He was smiling like a child waiting for me to press it.  “Come on.”  I reach out and press it.  The current message disappeared in a swirl and was replaced with “POTTER STINKS”.  My stomach dropped.
.  I could just tell him everything, and he could tell Dumbledore or whoever he heard it from an anonymous source.  Yet, I’m the only person who could know that information who could tell Harry.  Voldemort would know the moment someone countered.  I can’t say anything without risking everyone I love.
“Maybe you will if you don’t shut up,” He said out of the side of his mouth.  I smirked as I reached around him, bringing my mouth close to his ear.
"Malfoy? What in Merlin's name are you doing here?" Harry laughed despite the pit in his stomach. Maybe Malfoy didn't notice or care about the song earlier. Maybe he forgot by now.
“And what good’s theory going to be in the real world?” said Harry loudly, his fist in the air again.
“Okay, fine.  Be that way,” She snapped.  I rolled my eyes.  “How’s Harry?”  I shrugged.  I wish I knew.  I wish we could be normal and I could just greet him on the train or in the hall.
“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.  Umbridge turned around with a wicked smile.  Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too.  She stared at Harry for a moment before she addressed Hermione.  “Yes, Miss Granger?  You wanted to ask something else?”
"You broke up with—" Draco started, brows furrowed in surprise. Harry turned to the bar and grabbed two shots. Of course, he broke up with Ginny. Well, she broke up with him technically. She realised that, after having gone through the war without Harry, she didn't want to be with Harry, she wanted to be like Harry. He didn't quite understand what she meant by it but was happy when he saw her holding hands with Luna.
"Malfoy!  Malfoy wake up!"  Draco's eyes opened wide and he sat straight up, breathing heavily.  Harry didn't move his hands from Draco's shoulders but sat in front of him.
“Everything will be alright!  I promise you.”  Her fingers gently brushed through the gel in my hair, calming me.
As we were roaming the halls after dinner, Harry turned the corner, head down and shoulders slouched.  Pansy squeezed my hand and nodded.
"Well, regardless of what we call Harry, I'm looking to get fucked. Who's with me?" Jasper raised his arms triumphantly, and the other boys let out whoops of laughter. Draco laughed along, already feeling at home with these boys. They accepted him immediately, no questions asked.
“Of course love.  I just wanted…”  Draco’s eyes travelled down Harry’s chest to his dark briefs.  “Just wanted to try something.”  He reached up, tugging the briefs down to Harry’s knees.  He stared for a moment — the dark hair from Harry’s navel trailed into a dark bush around his long hard-on.  Draco cautiously wrapped his hand around the base of Harry’s cock.
“Draco, for god’s sake, would you just look?”  I groaned and looked up.  Looking across the pretty empty Ravenclaw table (I bet they had the library full) to see Potter grimacing at his nearly empty plate.  Another Gryffindor boy said something to him and Potter just snapped his head up at him.
“Snape’s being a hardass,” Pansy muttered.  A silent ‘thank Merlin, not to me’ followed.  I smiled slightly.  I’d take Snape over the Dark Lord any day.  We made our way to lunch — shepherd's pie — and chatted with Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle about classes thus far.  I glanced towards the Gryffindor table.  Harry looked miserable, all signs of happiness from this morning gone.  He caught my eye a moment later.  I gave him a small smile and he returned a slight nod.  A bit of relief washed over me at the thought of seeing him tonight.  For an hour or two, I’d be able to pretend that everything was as it was last year, that the only threat of death or injury was ridiculous and protected by officials, that all we had to worry about was sneaking around like normal teenagers.  For a couple of hours each night, we could pretend to be normal.
“Harry,” I finally called out.  I smiled as he turned around.  He finally got that haircut he needed and he’d grown a bit over summer.  His jaw was sharper and brow seemed set in a permanent furrow.  Yet, even despite the distance, I could see the dullness in his normally bright eyes.
defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated with a little laugh. “Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger.  You surely aren’t expecting to be attacked during class?”
“Don’t be.  I know you’re stressed.”  I pulled his head up and smiled at him.  I brushed my thumb along his cheek and pulled him into a soft kiss.  Harry practically melted into me.  I broke the kiss and planted another one on his forehead.  “Come on.  I can walk you, and if a teacher catches us, then I can just be reprimanding you for being out of bed after hours.”  I smirked as Harry laughed lightly.
“Come on,” Harry smiled, holding out his hand.  Draco cautiously sat up and took it.  “Let’s go upstairs?”  Draco’s eyes widened before he stood up next to Harry.  Harry smiled even wider and kissed Draco’s cheek before tugging him towards the stairs.  Halfway up, Draco trips and they laugh lightly.  Harry lightly laid his hand on Draco’s cheek.  Draco instinctively leaned into the touch, letting Harry push him backwards until he bumped against the wall.  Harry ran his hand up Draco’s arm as their lips met.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Hermione sharply.  I turned to look at Hermione, obviously as pissed as Harry was.
Pansy and I gathered our supplies and got to work.  Of course, it was an incredibly complicated potion and Pansy spent most of the first hour groaning and pouring over the instructions.
"Right.  I'll turn it."  He fumbled his way through flipping the record over and starting the music again.  "I'm getting some water."  He quickly left the lounge, practically running to the kitchen.  He grabbed a glass but opted to splash water on his face first, hoping to cool himself down.  Draco filled the glass and quickly downed it.
"I did mean to talk to you after the trial," Harry started, vaguely hearing Jasper order more shots, eliciting more groans. "But you left so quickly and then I ended up running away regardless—"
"I could do that for you,"  Harry eventually mumbled.  Draco looked at him with his brow furrowed.  "Rub your head, I mean."  Harry stood there, looking like a fifteen-year-old asking his crush about their day, hands in his pockets and shoulders tense.  Draco nodded, feeling his cheeks flush lightly.
"Yes.  I figured it out fourth year when I realised the reason I was annoyed about Cho and Cedric going to the Yule Ball together was that I was attracted to Cedric, not Cho."  Harry was smiling and laughing at words coming out of his mouth.
“No sir. I had heard rumours but had not believed them. He is not at the top of his class, sir,” I replied stiffly. He paused a moment, analysing my face before cocking his head with a slight smile.
“I know.  It’s just appearances, I promise,”  I assured him.  He nodded curtly.  “Just read that when you get the chance.”  I smiled at him, trying to lighten the mood a bit.  “Now go.”  He nodded, trying to suppress a smile.  I sauntered away, biting the corners of my mouth to not smile too much.
“Are you sure?”  My voice shook slightly.  Harry’s hand dropped from my arm to my hand, giving me a gentle squeeze.
“Everyone else,”  He said calmly.  “The Daily Prophet would have a frenzy with it.  Your father would probably go on a murdering spree.  I get it.  It’s easier this way.”  He gently played with the hair at the nape of my neck.
“Good,” said Professor Umbridge. “I should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ There will be no need to talk.”  Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the teacher’s desk, observing them all with those pouchy toad’s eyes.  I silently opened the book and stared at the page mindlessly, not bothering to actually read the page.  After a few minutes, I glanced up and looked around the room.  Hermione sat with her book unopened and hand raised in the air, staring directly at Umbridge.
“I’m sorry!  The song said one hour and when Fleur didn’t come down I thought her sister would drown!”  He explained, exasperated.  He’d explained the same thing plenty of times by now and didn’t want to keep repeating it, but I doubted I’d be the last person to comment on it.
“It was fine,” He mumbled.  I opened my arms and he eagerly wrapped his arms around my waist and laid his head against my chest.  I wrapped my arms around him and held him close.  “What time is it?”
"Me too." The men shared a long smile, the band in the background being drowned out. Warmth flooded Draco's stomach, and as much as he wanted to blame the alcohol, he knew it was much more.
!”  He finally looked up at me with a glare.  “How’s your head?”  Concern in an insult?  My speciality, apparently.  “You feeling all right? Sure you’re not going to go berserk on us?”  Harry simply broke his glare as Weasel handed him the Prophet.  Crabbe and Goyle started snickering next to me and I quickly joined in.  Harry threw the paper down and glanced back towards us.  I couldn’t read his gaze — somewhere between exhaustion, confusion and
“Draco!” Pansy called out.  She sped down the platform and enveloped me in a big hug.  My mother laughed as I returned the embrace.
They spent a couple of hours at a few pubs getting properly pissed before going to a club.  Draco didn't mind clubs if Harry stayed close to him.  The club was packed when they got there, pressing them close together.  Harry ordered them multiple rounds of shots when they arrived, making sure if they weren't already drunk off their arses, they were now.  Draco felt almost all sense of elegance leave him as Harry pulled them to the dance floor.  They danced, joining other groups throughout the night, even stumbling outside with a couple of attractive guys for a smoke, until the music faded and they were forced to leave.  Stumbling home together, laughing and holding each other up, forgetting they could just apparate home, Harry sobered slightly in the cold London air.  Draco, the lightweight he was, stayed as drunk as he was when they left.
"Why?" Harry turned his head away from Draco to hide his blush. He was special. He was the only one of his old friends, if you could call them that, that he had written a song about. He was also the first boy to make Harry realise he might not be straight.
“OUCH!”  The bowtruckle in Harry’s hand swiped at him, causing two jagged cuts along his hand.  I raised my brows and walked away.  I hoped Harry would get the point I was trying to get across — that Voldemort had manipulated his way into the Ministry and was calling the shots.  I couldn’t be straight up about it, so hopefully, Harry wouldn’t be a complete idiot for once.
“No.  No way,” I finally said.  Harry clenched his jaw and furrowed his brow, trying not to let more tears spill.  I shook my head furiously, tears pricking the backs of my eyes.  I pursued my lips.  “No, you’re wrong.  It was somebody else.  Anybody else.”
We spent the morning in the common room with our friends, close to the fire. I was sitting in Draco’s lap and Adrian shouted we should go cool down in the snow outside. He and his friends had just come back from a massive snow fight. And after lunch we took his advise and went for a stroll in the cold. Close to the castle, the snow was a mess, but the farther away we walked around the lake, the more untouched snow was around us. It was a nice afternoon, until Draco insisted we go back because he had to get ready (like three hours before the ball even started). He made me put a very elaborate braid in his hair, which took me like four tries to get right. But it made him look so beautiful, it was worth all the effort.
“Yes, Draco, yes. If you promise to try to get better, I’ll stay. For the rest of our lives. It’s all I want.”
A newspaper follows, and then a fake Auror badge, a book about healing charms (the first thing that is actually useful) and finally a feather of a snowy owl. Harry looks at the feather with tears in his eyes. He misses Hedwig. His first friend and trusted pet ripped away too soon like so many others.
“No, it’s not,” Remus says in a soft tone. “But your dad will be proud. He never was brave enough to kiss Lily out of the blue, but he did serenade her in the Great Hall to show her that he loves her.”
I don’t know what happened next with the fight because Hermione had taken my arm and had pulled me out of the shop. She took me for some ice-cream and tried to cheer me up. When I was not close to tears anymore we went back to Flourish and Blotts where we found the Weasleys, Hagrid and Hermione’s parents standing outside. Mr Weasley and Mrs Weasley were having an argument and Hermione’s parents looked scared and were happy when they could take Hermione back home. She screamed she would write as soon as she was home. Ron wouldn’t look at me and Ginny was still crying. George was trying to calm her down. Fred gave me a fist bud on the shoulder and said it was okay, that their older brother Charlie was also bent and that it was nothing to be ashamed about. I just nodded and was glad that we were going back to the Borrow after all that.
Pictures are shown of the murdered victims. Parkinson bled to death after the Sectumsempra hit her. Harry didn’t stay and watch. He had rushed down to the basement where he had found him. Draco his eyes had been open, but they didn’t see anything anymore. His clothes were torn and his bones broken. Harry had been too late. Compared to him, Goyle and Nott got off easy. They didn’t have to suffer to days of torture until their bodies gave out. They only had to endure a short time under the Cruciatus curse before Harry couldn’t stand the sound of their screams any longer.
But this all happened after the ball and I hadn’t even reached that yet. Because the dance also brought on some other drama. First, there was Hermione who was upset that Ron just didn’t ask her as a date to the ball. Really. I think he’s blind. How can’t he see how much Hermione likes him? But no, the idiot tried to ask Fleur to the ball. You remember, the girl from Beauxbatons who has some Veela blood. If we have to believe Neville, it turned out into a little of a disaster. And only after that, the idiot asked Hermione, since she was a girl. But by then Hermione already had another date and she’s been pissed off about it up until the ball.
I didn’t really know what to do, should I wait or get out of there? But Filch would remember he was going to request for a detention for me when he would see the half-completed form, so I decided to stay and wait. I looked over the desk and found a letter from Kwikspell, a correspondence course in beginners’ magic. And I know I shouldn’t have, but I was curious, so I pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside and read some of it. When Filch returned I quickly place all the parchment back into the envelope and place it back on the desk. But it wasn’t back where I found it and Filch was afraid I had read it. I said I hadn’t. Yes, I know, I shouldn’t lie, but I didn’t want the change even more detentions, not if professor Lockhart would volunteer again to give them to me. Only Filch was so upset about it that he told me to leave and I didn’t get any detention at all.
“What do you think happened. I tried to talk to him, as I had promised. And it. I said everything wrong. And he got upset and now he hates me even more. What was I thinking, Hermione? Why did I agree to talk to him? It only made everything worse.”
Ron claps his hands together. “I’m so going to win,” he says. The topic forgotten and replaced by the thrill of the chess game.
Professor Quirrell said Voldemort was with him wherever he goes. He gave me a story of how he had met him while he was travelling the world. And that Voldemort had shown him that there was no good or evil, but only power and those too weak to seek it.
Back in the common room, I spend half the night speculating with Draco, Blaise, Greg, Daphne and Millicent about what happened to Mr Crouch and what was wrong with him. Draco said it looked like he was under the imperious curse and was fighting it to warn us about Voldemort. All I know is that we hardly had any sleep that night and that I fell asleep on Draco’s shoulder during History of Magic the next day.
Hermione laughs and leans against Harry for a moment. “You won’t,” she says. Harry feels she’s holding something back, but that’s fine. It’s not like Hermione is going to tell Ron she likes him. She’s chickened out a million times already, and she will do the same now.
“Yes, he possessed Ginny and made her open the Chamber of Secrets. He almost killed her to come back to life,” Harry says.
“I’m sorry. I know you’re going to hate me for this.” Pansy’s eyes are moist when she looks up at Draco. “I don’t want to lose you as my friend.”
Harry thinks about it. Harry would love to tell her himself, but he won’t see her until Christmas break. And he isn’t sure if he can keep it a secret for that long. Neville already knows, and it won’t be long before Hermione figures it out. Harry wants to be able to talk to his friends without pretending anymore.
Draco was sure he could do it. He made his way to his father's dungeon and studied his notes all summer long. He would brew one of the fast killing potions to end Dumbledore’s life. The only thing to do was to find out how to make Dumbledore drink it.
“Just dizzy,” Harry answers as he opens his eyes again. He looks at Draco, sitting next to his bed. Draco is pale. Well, he’s always pale, but now he’s even paler. He has his hands clasped together on his lap and Harry wants to reach out and hold them. He wants to assure Draco that he’s all right.
“He isn’t crazy,” Harry says. He nudges his shoulder and Ginny gets the massage. She lifts her head, looks at Harry and raises her eyebrows.
Harry waves his hand, and some tape magically appears over George’s mouth. Rose and Victoire giggle as George looks at Harry, horrified.
On the third day of her visit, she crossed a line. She told Uncle Vernon that it was not his fault that I turned out o be an unsatisfactory person. That if there was something rotten on the inside, there was nothing anyone can do. I had to fight tears when she said that, it reminded me of all the bullying that I had received in my first and the start of second year at Hogwarts. She continued by comparing me to her breeding dogs. She said that if there was something wrong with the bitch, there’ll be something wrong with the pup. I got so upset when she said that. I could feel my magic flare through me and Aunt Marge her wineglass exploded in her hands. It didn’t seem to bother her at all, she thought she had just squeezed it too hard. I fled the room after that, afraid I would get another warning from the Ministry about using magic outside of school.
Draco stayed at Hogwarts this Easter holiday. He said I would need him more than his mother would need him. It’s nice to have him around. We are not allowed to go outside the Slytherin common room because of the attacks so we spent most of our time just hanging around in our dormitory, talking and playing with magic. It’s nice. I’ve missed this, just the easy simple time with Draco.
But like I was saying, Hermione disturbed the History of Magic class last Wednesday. Professor Binns was droning on about the International Warlock Convention of 1289 when she put up her hand and just asked point blank if the professor could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets. Well, that woke up everyone in the class. Professor Binns told us about the founders of the school and how Salazar Slytherin wanted to be more selective about the students who they would admit to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. It turned into this big argument between Slytherin and Gryffindor and Slytherin left the school. And the legend goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing, that could only be opened by his own true heir to unleash the horror within, to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.
Harry pulls him against his chest again. “You don’t. You saved me. You didn’t destroy me. You make my life complete, and the only way you can destroy it is by leaving me.”
“You want to talk about it, or should I give you something else to polish?” James asks. “Because if you keep this up, your broom will dissolve before you get a chance to fly it this summer.”
“Just a friend?” James asks. “That’s why he was still here, alone. All your other friends already gone.”
Draco can’t stand the idea that they fly towards the pitch where Harry’s broken body will lay on the ground. The sparkle in his eyes gone forever. Draco’s doesn’t think he could keep up appearances if he’d have to see that. And he will have to keep up appearances now.
It was hard to find the snitch. Every time I saw it and tried to go for it, either a Bludger or Chang would block my way. Marcus yelled at me to stop being a gentleman and just knock Chang of her broom. His crush completely forgotten. I followed his advice and did a nice dive, Chang followed me and struggled to get out of the dive when I did. Then I saw the snitch and accelerated towards it. Chang was falling far behind and I knew I was going to get it. Then Chang screamed and I looked around quickly. There were a couple of Dementors looking at me and without thinking I pulled out my wand to perform the Patronus charm, only Draco beat me and his beautiful Tigress charged at the Dementors. I turned back to the snitch, didn’t even wait to watch what would happen to the Dementors. I just wanted to win this match, so I reached out and grabbed the snitch. Madam Hooch blew her whistle and in seconds Draco’s mouth was on mine. He kissed me midair to loud chairs of all the Slytherins. I knew they chaired because we had won, but still, it was amazing. The rest of the team joined us in the air and they all hugged me. Marcus kept yelling that he knew the gay duo was the best.
Harry puffs out some are. “Yes, okay. I love him,” he says. “But I can’t have him. So what am I supposed to do? I can’t keep doing this. Feeling empty and alone. It’s too hard, Neville.”
Harry shakes his head. “You don’t understand,” he says. “I need to get to the rat before Neville does.”
Draco swallows and braces himself. The punishment will be severe. There is no doubt in his mind that he’ll hurt for his failure to appreciate the new mark on his arm, or the lack of pleasure he finds in the fact that he killed Harry. Both unacceptable to the Dark Lord. And everyone who does something unacceptable shares the same faith. Torture you won’t forget easily, to remind you who’s in control, who’s stronger, and who you should obey.
“Oh, Malfoy better watch out,” Hannah says. “I don’t think his friendship with Potter is going to last now he’s attacked his brother.”
Ron and Hermione confronted Draco a couple of days ago. I think they are worried about me. It turned ugly very quickly. When I walked up to them fighting I heard Draco say: No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood’. He looked so angry, it frightened me. And why would he say that to Hermione? Wasn’t she his friend? Wasn’t he all our friends. Well, you can understand that Ron also didn’t take it lightly to hear someone call his girlfriend a Mudblood. He pulled out his wand and yelled that Draco would pay for that. He pointed his wand furiously at Draco’s face and then a loud bang echoed around them. A jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron’s wand and hit him in the stomach, sending him reeling backwards onto the grass. Hermione turned to him and was all concerned about him.
“Even if that means never having children of our own?” Draco asks. He doesn’t want to ask it. He already knows the answer. This will make Harry leave. He will see that he’s better off without Draco, that he doesn’t need Draco to breathe.
After that, we were escorted back to our dormitories. We had lost a hundred and twenty points for Slytherin that night. And Gryffindor was already leading because they had been winning with Quidditch. Because of me, Slytherin was now in the last place. Nott went to his bed without saying a word, but I was sure he would also blame it all on me. And Draco was hiding in his bed. I didn’t sleep all night. I could hear Draco sobbing into his pillow for hours. I didn’t know what to say to comfort him, how sorry I was that he had gotten into trouble because of me.
Things are a little better than they were the last time I wrote to you. After I had been locked up for three days I woke up from a horrible dream to find Ron Weasley outside my window. I was so happy to see his freckled-face, his red hair and long nose. I hurried to the window and opened it so we could talk. My mouth fell open when I saw that he was hanging out of the back window of an old turquoise car, which was parked in mid-air. Ron’s twin brothers Fred and George were grinning at me from the front seats.
“He’s excited to spend more time with his uncles. I told him yesterday about our new arrangement,” Andromeda says. Draco turns to look at her and is surprised to see the smile on Andromeda’s face.
Draco opens his eyes again. Harry has turned around on the bed, so he’s facing Draco. He looks excited as if he found the answer to all their questions.
So, when Harry returns from the first Quidditch practice of the year that weekend, he sits down next to his friends during lunch and right away breaches the issue called Malfoy.
But, like I was saying, I was just flying around, spinning upside down and enjoying myself when Malfoy started staring at me. And he didn’t stop. He just kept staring at me all day. And when he was lying in bed he didn’t close his curtains all the way, so he could still stare at me. I closed mine as soon as I was ready for bed. Ever since then, he stares at me a lot, but only when the others aren’t around or aren’t looking at us. I don’t know what to think of it. It isn’t like anything else changed. He still makes fun of my inabilities whenever he gets a change and still insists on sitting next to me in most of our classes so he can bump his arm against mine when we’re taking notes.
Harry rolls up his parchment and picks up all his belongings. He gets up and walks back to his dorm. He dumps his books on his chest and lays down in his bed. It doesn’t take long before Neville comes in and lays down beside him.
I slipped back to my friends and soon Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean joined us and we had a lot of fun. Until Rita Skeeter came into the pub. She was fishing for a story, even asked me for an interview about the Hagrid I knew. And then the most amazing thing happened. I had expected Draco to lose his temper, but it was Hermione who stood up and called her a horrible woman and told her to keep her quill inside her bag and leave us all alone.
“I won’t,” Draco answers. “You can arrange all you want, I won’t do it.” Draco has made up his mind. He can’t live a life filled with lies. No matter how hard it is to stand up against father and hold his ground, Draco won’t give in. Not this time.
“Don’t,” Harry tells him. His hand wipes away a tear from Draco’s cheek. Draco wants to protest, wants to scream that Harry should let him apologise. Draco is ruining everything these days. He’s the reason they don’t have their own baby. He’s the reason why Harry will never have a big family. He’s at fault. But Draco doesn’t scream. He just nods and lets Harry guide him back inside the house. They sit down on the sofa together and watch as Teddy shows off all his new toys. They eat cake and drink wine. And Draco knows he should enjoy this moment, that he should live in the here and now. But all he can think off is how he wants to go home and crawl in his bed.
Neville doesn’t say anything else. He turns around in his bed and falls asleep again. Harry lays down in his bed, but sleep doesn’t find him. His mind keeps drifting back to his nightmare and his heart aches.
As soon as Madam Hooch was out of sight Malfoy and Nott started laughing and making fun of Neville. One of the Gryffindor girls told them to shut up, and that made Parkinson snap at her. I was afraid they were going to fight, but then Malfoy picked up a glass ball from the ground and said it was the stupid thing Longbottom’s gran had sent him. Ron told him to give it to him, but Malfoy refused and said he would leave it in a tree. Ron yelled at him to give it back. And then Malfoy got on his broom and took off. He hovered level with the topmost branches of an oak and called for Ron to come and get it. Ron took his broom and was planning to take off when Hermione pulled on his arm and told him he couldn’t, that he would get them all in trouble. But Ron pushed her to the side and flew into the air after Malfoy. But Malfoy was a better flyer than Ron, so he moved away from him quickly, manoeuvring like a practice flyer. He smiled while moving around, lighting up his whole face. And Ron just became redder and redder while he tried to catch up with Malfoy. After a while, Malfoy threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. He landed with grace and stepped off his broom like it was nothing. Ron stumbled to the ground next to him, but I wasn’t really looking at him, and Malfoy noticed that my eyes were on him and shouted at me to stop staring with my stupid face. When Madam Hooch came back she cancelled the rest of the lesson and told us we will continue next week. That saddened me because I wanted to try to fly like Malfoy had done. It looks like it’s a lot of fun.
I made it to Draco and took his hand in mine. If we were going to die I wanted to hold him, know that he was here with me. I tried to ignore Riddle’s laughter and mocking. I just wanted to tell Draco one more time that I love him. Fawkes came flying by then and he dropped the diary into my lap. And without thinking I wrenched the Basilisks fang out of my arm and plunged it straight into the heart of the book. I wanted to hurt the awful book that had used my Draco, manipulated him and was now killing him. There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream and ink came spurting out of the diary. Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then he was gone. My wand fell to the floor with a clatter and then everything was still. I lay down on the floor and closed my eyes, not expecting to open them again.
Firstly, I hate being in the Divination classroom. It’s always hot and the fire gives off this awful smell. There are no proper desks, which Hermione keeps complaining about, and we have to sit on poofs. And the professor is crazy. She is very thin, wears large glasses that magnify her eyes and she has all this noise making jewellery on. She scared Neville half to death by implying his grandmother isn’t well. Hermione got all upset about it, said that Neville only had his grandmother. I felt sorry for Neville and asked him if he was okay later that week. He got all red when I talked to him, said he was fine and almost ran away as soon as he got the opportunity. Draco thinks it’s cute how Neville is crushing on me, which is absurd, he’s just a shy boy, always has been.
None of us spoke when we changed into our robes. I was glad when Draco sat down next to me on one of the benches and grabbed my hand. He looked paler than usual. And when Marcus told us it was time, Draco gave me a soft kiss before we left the locker rooms.
I stumbled to the floor when they told me. I couldn’t believe it, I had only just got him back and now I was going to lose him all over again. And this time for real. He would die and I won’t be able to save him.
During the night I had a very strange dream. I was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban. And the turban kept talking to me, telling me that I should be happy that I’m in Slytherin, that it was my destiny. I told the turban I didn’t want to be in Slytherin, that I wanted to transfer to Gryffindor. I tried to pull the turban off my head because it was becoming heavier and heavier, but it tightened painfully. And then Malfoy was there, laughing and pointing at me. After a while, Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher. He laughed also, with a high and cold laugh. Next, there was a burst of green light and I woke up sweating and shaking. I hope none of the other boys knows that I had a nightmare and won’t make fun of me for trashing in my bed.
“It’s okay, George,” Harry says. He looks up and tries to plaster a smile on his face. He’s sure it doesn’t work and he must look awful, but it will have to do. “And yes, Angela, the rumours are true.”
“Love you too, Hermione,” Harry says. He sits down and starts to dish up his breakfast. It isn’t long before Ron and Neville join them.
Harry groans and then drops his head on the table in front of him. Neville laughs and Iris pouts her lips. “What’s so funny?” she asks.
"We won't, that's the whole point. It's destroying us, trying so hard. I want to have sex with you because we both want to, because we love each other. Not because we have to." Harry sounds so sure, so confident. Draco wants to say yes, he wants to find his way back to the time where they couldn’t keep their hands off each other. But that time is gone, and he knows it will never come back. Not until Draco can give Harry what he wants, what he needs. A child of his own.
“And what if it still doesn’t happen? Are there any other options?” Harry asks. He still sounds so hopeful, so determent to make this happen. Draco doesn’t have that hope now that it’s clear that this is all his fault, just like he thought. He doesn’t believe there is anything left to say. He wants to go home and crawl back into his bed and forget this conversation ever happened. At least then he could still pretend that this wasn’t his fault. Now he knows for sure. Not that he will ever tell Harry. He can’t stand the thought of losing him too.
I was glad when the door opened and the Headmaster told us it was time for the ceremony. Mr Ollivander was there to inspect our wands, making sure they are in good condition before the tournament. He first inspected Fleur’s wand, that contains a Veela hair that used to belong to her grandmother. So we were right in thinking she is part Veela.
And even though I first didn’t want to go, it was beautiful above the clouds. It was like being in a different world, with the sky a bright, endless blue under a blinding white sun. But after a couple of hours, it became less fun. It was warm and we had nothing to drink, and my glasses kept sliding down my sweaty nose.
Professor Snape rushed towards me, making sure I was alright. But all I wanted to know is what the bastard had done to Draco and if he was fine. Professor Snape understood and he smelled the tea and then checked Draco. He promised me it was just a sleeping potion, that Draco was fine, and that he would wake up once the potion had set its course.
And I still have to work with him during potions. Well, he still does all the work and I just make notes. And somehow that’s better than the other classes because during potions he’s not making my life miserable. I wish Nott and Crabbe would also get the memo that says I should be left alone during potions. But they still manage to point out I’m a horrible wizard, not capable of doing my own potion because I would make poison instead of potions.
‘I would,’ Malfoy answers. Harry wants to jump from his seat and dance around. He doesn’t. Malfoy might change his mind when he sees how stupid Harry can act from time to time. He does spot the clock at the end of the room and curses. He quickly writes down that he needs to hurry off to dinner because he has an extra Quidditch practise this evening.
And he keeps talking about how good he is in Quidditch and flying, ever since the notice for our flying lessons was posted on the notice board. He complains all the time that it’s unfair that he’s not allowed his own broom and that he’s not allowed to try out for the Quidditch house team. And don’t get me started about all the stories of how he narrowly escapes helicopters. And after every story he has to remind everyone that I don’t have my own broom and how I’m going to make a fool of myself in front of the Gryffindor’s, shaming the Slytherin house even more.
“Don’t you start too,” Hermione complains. She places the Daily Prophet on the table. “I don’t want you all to get killed,” she says. She finishes her juice and then gets up. “I need to get to class early. Don’t do anything stupid while I’m gone.” She turns and walks away.
The rush of wind around him stops. A strong arm grabs him around the waist and he’s hoisted onto Adrian’s broom.
Rookwood gives Draco a dark look. He’s still upset that Draco took his place around the table. Draco is sure that Rookwood would kill him if he knew he would get away with it.
They'd arrived at the party about an hour ago. Draco had sat down in one of the chairs and hasn't moved since. Harry looks at him from his place on the sofa. Ginny sit next to him, telling him all about the house hunt and how happy she's with this place. Harry nods in agreement. Not that he's paying attention to her words. He’s sure he won’t be able to recall anything Ginny says today.
Harry takes Draco’s hand in his. “I love you, and I think it’s what we both need this year. Just some time together,” he says, skipping over Teddy’s intrusion like it never happened.
It would have all been so perfect, a child of their own. Teddy, the proud big brother. And then over a couple of years another one. It’s all Harry has ever dreamed off, a loving family of his own. And to do it with the man he loves more than anything is a blessing. Until it all went wrong. Draco thinks he hides it, that Harry doesn’t see how he blames himself. Harry keeps telling him it’s not his fault, that he still loves him. And maybe soon Draco will start believing it too. Harry hopes he will. He knows how destructive it can be when Draco loses hope.
We had to undergo all kind of silly test the weekend after the task. Some people of the Ministry came to oversee them. And Sirius and Draco’s mom were there. I think that was the first time they’ve seen each other in years. They first didn’t know how to interact with each other. Draco’s mom was extremely polite, just like Draco was in the beginning with Sirius. I made Draco laugh. I love it when he laughs. He’s so beautiful, mom. I want to look at him for the rest of my life. And now that we know about our soul bond, I think I will. I know I will never love anyone the way I love him. And yes, I know we’re only fourteen. But there is no denying it anymore, we’re made for each other.
Harry points his wand at his temple. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. He thinks of Draco one last time before he says ‘Obliviate’.
I tried to shut him up by saying hadn’t done that and I think Sirius was relieved to hear that. He went on that Draco and I are still very young and that I shouldn’t do anything I don’t want to. I promised I wouldn’t and then fled the room. Draco has looked into the book and says it’s interesting, says I should read it for when we want to take that step, so I also know what to expect. I don’t know if I want that, but on the other hand, the idea of being that close and intimate with Draco makes me feel all fussy inside.
It was hard to focus on my happy memory when Professor Lupin opened the crate that held the Boggart that would turn into a Dementor. When I was waiting I kept thinking that I could hear mom again in a second. The Dementor came out of the box and I tried to focus and shouted Expecto Patronum, but it didn’t work. The classroom and Dementor dissolved and I fell through a thick white fog. Mom’s voice was louder than before, screaming ‘not Harry, please I’ll do anything’.
“I’ll come with you.” Harry puts his arm around Draco’s waist and helps him stand up. Together they walk to the dressing room. Harry hands Draco his pants. On autopilot, Draco puts one leg into it and then the other. His trousers are next. Draco holds them in his hands and stares at it. He’d been afraid that he wouldn’t be able to find any nice trousers when his stomach became too large.
“Yes, I already yelled at Dumbledore about this,” James says. “And where is Madam Pomfrey. I need a full report on your health.” James walks past Harry and Draco towards Madam Pomfrey’s office.
“Hermione, how long does it take to get a bottle of champagne?” Draco shouts while he walks into the kitchen. “Fuck, I didn’t need to see that,” he continues when he spots Hermione, who sits on the counter, her legs wrapped around Ron’s hips. Ron’s trousers pushed down to his knees, his face panting in Hermione’s neck.
So, it the end of January now, and I have finally figured out the secret of the egg. And all thanks to some help of Cedric and Myrtle. Who wasn’t pleased that I never come to visit her anymore, which I kind of feel bad about, because she had been a good friend to me in my second year. Draco says a good friend doesn’t help you try to commit suicide, but I don’t think he fully understands how lonely I was back then and that if Myrtle hadn’t been there I might have tried even sooner. Which now makes Draco say that would have been better because me almost dying made him realise his love for me was more important than his father's approval. But you know, maybe he should have figured that out without me almost dying, so he has no grounds to complain about my friendship with Myrtle.
Once the tents were done, Draco and I went out to get some water from the tap. It was amazing to see the many wizards and witches around us. I never really thought about how many there were in Britain, let alone in the entire world. And there were little kids with magic, playing with their parents' wands and flying small broomsticks. Draco saw me gaping at them and he told me he still has his somewhere at the manor if I wanted to go give it a try. I pushed him a little away from me and we both laughed before our hands linked again. I felt really good that day, just hanging with Draco at a campsite filled with people from all over the world that were just as magical as me.
“I could go sit next to him so he can read my notes during class,” Hermione says when it’s clear that they all have agreed that it’s Hermione that will supply the notes. “That way he might even come back to DADA, as he doesn’t have to guess anymore what’s expected of him,” she says.
“I was just wondering,” Harry says. “He studies hard but he still gets low grades. It’s just, he doesn’t talk and he…” Harry isn’t sure how to put it. No matter how he says it, it will sound bad. He looks back to the aquarium where the Grindylow moves around.
After breakfast I took Hermione apart and told her about the voice I heard during detention. She doesn’t know what it is and that I shouldn’t worry about it. That maybe it was just me being tired. That he hadn’t been sleeping well, and that it was probably nothing. And maybe she is right, but I don’t know. It sounded real. And I don’t want to go crazy. Life is already hard enough without voices in my head.
“You know that once we get on that field, all bets are off,” Harry says with a smile on his face. He’s already in his Quidditch robes and Draco can’t keep his eyes off him. It’s strange how things between them have changed this year. In a way, Draco hadn’t expected.
“I love you too, Teddy,” Draco tells him. “I’ll take Teddy-bear tonight. And then I’ll feel better tomorrow, I promise. Now let us get you back into bed.”
“Another way is to have it surgically removed. We don’t recommend this, as it increases the risk of permanently damaging the uterus, making another successful pregnancy less likely, which leaves us with the third option. We can prescribe a potion that will induce the miscarriage. Draco would still have a natural miscarriage, but we would know when it will happen.”
On our walk, Sirius and Remus told us all about how good you were at Quidditch, dad. They talked about the boring training they would watch, while Remus and Peter would do homework and Sirius would just try to distract Moony. Tonks piped in on how she loved flying against Charlie when she was on the team during her time at Hogwarts. And then I told them how good Draco is as a chaser and that he was voted our new team captain. Everyone congratulated him, even Sirius, who said it was a great responsibility and that he should remember not to favour any players above others (meaning me). Draco promised he would try to and that he was really excited about it.
“You go and have a good evening with Harry,” Hermione says on the other side of the line. “And then we’ll see you guys tomorrow for lunch, and you can all drink a beer on my pregnancy while I sip some fruit juice.”
Their lips meet and Harry forgets all about London. That night he dreams of Draco’s hand on his, of the promise to spend the next night together on the astronomy tower. The night will be special. Draco promised. Something about the new moon and how much brighter the stars will be. What Harry didn’t expect is to find a blanket surrounded by flying candles. Pillows soft and comfortable to sit upon, a picnic basket filled with fruits and snacks. Draco holds his hand and caresses his neck.
Harry covered the shopping, but Draco enjoyed tagging along and picking up random things off the shelves to throw in the carriage when Harry wasn't paying attention.  Draco also began joining Harry on his weekend walks through the park, admiring how the man was so content just walking and humming to himself.  Harry tried every weekend to get Draco to go out to the pubs with him, and every time Draco would complain about there being too many people but would agree after Harry promised not to leave him.  They'd go to a few local bars and sometimes a club, before stumbling for a late-night chippys and eventually collapsing in a fit of giggles on their couches.  They'd wake up with headaches and Draco would groan theatrically as Harry would make his famous hangover cure.
"Coming?  I plan on getting fucked up tonight."  Harry smirked, knowing Draco almost never refused a proper night out now.  Draco rolled his eyes, letting Harry apparate them to Harry's favourite pub.
“Potter!”  I spat, adding a wink at the end.  His eyes widened and he looked down. Mudblood Granger came up to him and took his arm, leading him away from me, mumbling in my direction.  I sighed and kissed Pansy's head.
of the door closing, I was left alone in my bed, staring at the ceiling and finally able to let my thoughts wander after two unbearable and arduous months.  I silently thanked Merlin.
With a low moan, Harry deftly flipped Draco onto the bed on his back.  Draco gasped, the air knocked out of his while Harry looked down at him with hooded eyes.
“Mmm, no,” Draco hummed.  Harry placed a callused hand on his cheek and pulled him in.  “Not — one — bit,” Draco mumbled between the soft kisses.  Harry’s lips were salty from the popcorn he’d been eating throughout the movie, a hint of sweetness from the Coke.  Draco sighed softly as Harry swept his tongue across his bottom lip, the scruff on Harry’s chin rough on Draco’s skin.  Harry couldn’t help but smile at the hint of chocolate still on Draco’s lips.
“Hey,” I whispered once he was within earshot.  I grabbed his hand and tugged him to a nearby cupboard.  He winced slightly as I took his hand.
"It's late.  You should go to bed,"  Harry murmured, smiling at the sleepy man.  Draco slowly sat up, rubbing his head.  "Let me know if you need anything, okay?"  Harry grabbed Draco's wrist as he stood.  Draco looked at Harry's hand on his wrist then to his face and smiles softly.
, Mr Potter!”  Harry thrust his fist in the air.  Umbridge turned away again, but now several other people had their hands up too.  “And your name is?”
I woke up the next morning less rested than the day before.  I spent a few hours staring at the ceiling, trying to make sense of the argument but ended up passing out before I could.  I dragged myself out of bed and got ready before meeting Pansy.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, pulling him so that they were chest to chest.  Draco placed his hands on Harry’s heated cheeks as their lips met in a fiery kiss.  Harry hoisted Draco onto his lap, his legs straddling Harry’s hips.  Harry’s cologne intoxicated Draco — he could barely remember his own name as Harry’s hands raked down his back.  Draco tangled his finger’s in Harry’s grown out curls, tugging lightly.  He bucked his hips forward when Harry gently bit down on his lip.  Harry groaned from the sudden friction, dragging his hands to Draco’s hips and pulled him down again.  Draco gasped, throwing his head back slightly.  Harry took the chance to gently bite down on Draco’s exposed neck, running his teeth and tongue down, sucking the slightly flushed pale skin.
Eventually, they stopped shifting so far from each other, opting to stay next to each other.  They were careful not to touch each other if they could help it, but on the rare occasion, Draco's hand would pass over Harry's when pointing something out or Harry's elbow would bump Draco's or when they accidentally sat too close and their knees would touch, both men would feel a hot flush rise to their cheeks and would turn away before the other could notice.  Draco would cover the sudden dryness of his mouth with a light cough and Harry would scrunch his nose and fiddle with his glasses in an attempt to refocus on the book in his lap.  Neither man would speak of this but rather had a silent agreement that less touching was better.
"Thanks."  Draco left but Harry couldn't lay back down.  His heart was still beating in his throat.  Draco also remained awake for the rest of that night, unable to get the look of fear on Harry's face out of his mind.
Dumbledore’s words echoed in my mind — a decision between is easy and what is right. Loving Harry is easy, being with him is easy, but it isn’t right. Not in these times. Siding with Harry is right. But I risk my life and the lives of my family. I can’t allow them to die for my love. They can’t find out.
