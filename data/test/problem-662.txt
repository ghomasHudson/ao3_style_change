"There you are. Let's go, or we won't get anything to eat before we have to go to Defence," he said.
"You really like it? It was the first thing that came to mind," Draco said sheepishly. Harry nodded and kissed Draco briefly.
"Harry, I told you my parents were not what you might think."
"Erm ... yes, come let's do some chores before Severus comes back tonight," Draco said quickly and reached for his book and the parchments again.
"Harry James Potter, I've fallen in love with you," the Slytherin murmured against the other's lips. Harry reconnected their lips and said as they released the kiss, "Well thank goodness I found my way back into my body, this would have been very strange otherwise. So Draco Lucius Malfoy, I've fallen in love with you too."
"Miss Granger, Mr Weasley, you can visit Mr Potter. He is in the hospital wing, but just the two of you and please keep it to yourselves," he said.
"Yes, but Dray, I can't teach you that here now," Blaise said, confused.
"What do you mean?"
"Cissa, they are only sixteen. I don't know if they realise what that means," Severus pointed out.
"No, not all of it, but the most important part and ... well, it wasn't the prefect’s bathroom, but..."
"Dray ..."
"You know, in the world of magic there are many black spells that are so hideous, so terrible, that they are hardly mentioned, let alone taught. Horcruxes are objects in which a black magician stores part of his soul outside his body. One who commits murder splits his soul and can keep part of it and enclose the other in an object through a black magic spell. In this way, not his whole soul lives in his own body, but only a part of it. The other part of the soul is safely stored in a Horcrux. When a person is killed who has made a Horcrux of himself, his soul remains earthbound because part of it is preserved in an intact Horcrux body. The remaining torso soul from the now dead own body can implant itself in other people's bodies or create its own capable body again with other people's help...", Harry stared at the teacher and Remus in horror.
"Ginny? Why?"
"We're going now. Enjoy your time together and ...", that was all he could say. Narcissa stepped up to the boys again and gave them each a kiss on the forehead.
"Why do you let them do that to you?" the Slytherin wanted to know abruptly.
"So moral today?" sneered Severus.
"What?", Draco looked at the other in complete shock.
"And do you feel anything?" he wanted to know, but Harry shook his head.
"W-what?"
"I never had a real family like that. The closest thing was the Weasleys, and Sirius and Remus, but with you it's something else and .... And I hate that I'll never enjoy it because I can't. I hate that we'll never sit in your garden and drink tea, we'll never have children romping around the house with their grandparents, we'll never be able to stand on the beach together and let the water run over our feet, we won't be able to grow old together," Harry concluded, wiping away his tears. Draco leaned over him and stroked his cheek with a smile.
"I would like to know that from you, Harry. Mr Malfoy and Mr Zabini found you and Professor Snape in the potions classroom. They were unconscious, apparently a potion exploded,"
"Th-thank you, we ... we'll go to bed then," Draco said, gently pulling Harry with him.
"A-And you don't think about it any more either .... so ...", Hermione stuttered.
"Good, and as for this bond, we'll find a solution. But you seem to be getting on quite well now, don't you?", Harry and Draco nodded. It was a kind of silent agreement between them not to tell Dumbledore for the time being that they were getting on more than well by now.
"Sirius," Severus said, and it was less a question than a statement. He had known for a very long time about their relationship, which was far more than mere friendship. Remus nodded and emptied his glass.
"All right, I'll tell them. But I won't let them do it here," he said energetically and walked past the woman into Draco and Harry's hospital room. The two were not wearing shirts. Harry leaned back against Draco's bare chest and read from a book. When the Potions Master entered, they startled.
"Yes, let's go then," Harry said, swallowing hard.
"Are you still there?" he wanted to know, only now aware that he had been in thought the entire time.
"Ron!" hissed Hermione. The latter shrugged his shoulders.
"You have nothing to be sorry for," the man said and briefly put a hand on his cheek. Harry nodded with a smile and then sat down with Draco on the large bed.
"No, it would be better if the two of them returned to their ... well, one of the houses," said Dumbledore.
"Don't stare," Draco hissed at the surrounding students, grabbing Harry's upper arm rudely and dragging him towards the dungeons. Wordlessly, he pushed him into the Slytherin common room. Those present stared at them, but no one said anything.
"Okay, I don't think he's thinking of any more suicide attempts at the moment," Severus said.
"I don't know," Draco said, but couldn't stop himself from blushing.
"Oh no, you go!" said Molly Weasley, pushing her daughter towards the students striving to get out.
"Don't know, but we hoped. So you are?"
"All right, but ... but s-so have you ever, I mean ..."
"I-I just need to use the bathroom," he said quickly, avoiding Draco's gaze.
"I promise," he said and then looked at Draco, who now had tears running down his cheeks. Severus hugged him and now even the usually cool Potions Master was crying.
"Hellebore wasn't in the recipe, what made you think of that?", Harry wanted to know. Draco jumped up and moved away, but immediately recollected himself when he heard Harry's gasp.
"But you want to help him, I can see that," Snape said.
"I ... I have an idea how we might calm her down."
"Remus!" shouted Harry, snatching it out of the werewolf's hand.
"That's not the point, neither of us has any experience."
"I don't know."
"Draco, we don't even like each other!"
"Dray I'm not jealous, at most a little envious," Harry said, grinning now. Draco shook his head in amusement and kissed his friend gently.
"So are we going through this because we both want a good grade or what?"
"Yes, sir," Harry replied, but the teacher had already disappeared.
"You go Longbottom and you too Hagrid too," Snape said coolly.
"Remus?"
"Um ... OK, you're really scaring us a bit," Harry said and reached for Draco's hand.
"Severus!" he heard Remus' voice beside him sternly.
"Y-Yes me too, Mrs Malfoy," Harry stammered.
"Well you-know-who is one thing above all, arrogant and obsessed with power. He didn't lock his soul parts into something arbitrary. Each item was special in its own way, something unique," Harry looked up in surprise.
"Are you okay?"
"You can cook?" asked Severus incredulously, looking into the pots.
"Then who will take what name?" he asked to lighten the mood a little.
"Are we in trouble? Okay, it was wrong to shock Pansy, but at least we both knew the spell and I repeat myself, she started it!" began Draco, but Severus raised his arms placatingly.
"Dray!" shouted Blaise, holding his friend by the arm. The latter turned around and saw Harry lying on the floor, immediately he ran back.
"Yes, maybe but I don't blame you and now let's do the chores or we'll never finish by tonight," he then said and reached for a book. Draco looked at him for a long time. Something had changed since yesterday. The burning in his chest was no longer strong, but it was there, small and quiet and yet strange, as soon as he looked at Harry.
"Yes. My uncle worse than my aunt, but yes and they still do to this day."
"So what?", Draco wanted to know with narrowed eyes.
"Yes, yes all good," he said quickly and patted his trousers.
"No, it's a precautionary measure and now go before I change my mind," Snape said and hurried away.
"It was the truth," he said simply.
"Well, sometimes it pays to look behind the façade," Harry said simply and smiled. Draco remained silent and looked back at Hagrid, who had obviously finished feeding him.
"Yes, he would also die, and according to your stories, it is completely irrelevant whether they are bound or not."
"What are those scars on your back?" the Slytherin wanted to know in horror and stepped a little closer.
Severus ran through the corridors of the school, dodging astonished students who had never seen their teacher run like that before. The latter was glad that there was no one to be seen on the seventh floor as he closed his eyes and then tore open the door to the Room of Requirement.
"Yes, maybe not, but you have saved many more lives with it than you might think, and so be proud."
"And if?" asked Harry provocatively.
"Okay, so I'm listening," he said, his voice trembling a little.
"I don't intend to," he said then, kissed Remus' temple and turned around. Dumbledore was now standing in the doorway, looking at the four of them with a smile.
"Yes, don't worry. Everything's okay."
"You liked him a lot, didn't you?" asked Draco abruptly, and the other looked at him in complete surprise.
"I think it's more than two metres," Harry said, blushing.
"A couple? Yes, we are. So ready," Remus said and stepped away from Harry.
"What do we do now?", Draco wanted to know and took Harry's hand.
"Really mean Uncle Sev. We're going to the south of France, we have a holiday home by the sea," Draco said.
"Are they actually your in-laws now?" he asked quietly and Hermione, who had heard, rolled her eyes.
"Yes, I thought so too, but I'm afraid I have to get up and pick up the boys," Severus said, reaching for fresh clothes.
"I hate to admit it, but I didn't know what to say," Severus said.
"If anything makes you uncomfortable, you need to say so, all right?" he murmured, reaching blindly beside him and suddenly having a jar in his hand. Harry gulped, but nodded as Draco wet a finger with oil and carefully ran it between his buttocks. Automatically, Harry spread his legs wider to give Draco more room. He gently circled Harry's entrance and at the same time distracted him with a passionate kiss.
"And what does that mean now?", Slughorn wanted to know.
"Cissa, if Draco sees how much you're suffering, it will make it all that much worse," Severus explained.
"Right, so I'm assuming you've never heard of Horcruxes, have you?"
"Sure, Ron," Harry said with a grin, reaching for a loaf of bread.
"Well ... nothing. I can't talk about it yet, but ... let's not. We'll do everything as I said. Protecting them is the most important thing now. I would defiantly ask you to work with Horace to find a way to separate them, that would be very important to me and I'm sure to Draco's parents as well," Severus nodded, but wasn't really satisfied with the answer.
"Yes, that's what I thought. You two can't attend class like that. It would be too dangerous."
"So that's where the rings came from," Lucius said.
"Take care of yourself," he said, kissing his boyfriend gently.
"No Ron, it's no one's fault. If I had reacted faster, I would have run after the idiots too," Harry said quickly and Draco turned back to repotting and Blaise.
"It's just too cramped in Draco’s and Blaise's room and so I don't have to sleep on the floor."
"Do you want it then?", Harry looked at his friend for a long time, then nodded.
"Hey, don't do that. I already said I don't mind sleeping on the floor," Harry now interfered.
"Then they must seal the bond or they will both die," Narcissa finished, Severus' sentence. The latter only nodded mutely.
"Yes I do," he said, pulling Draco back up and kissing him.
"Hello James, hello Lily and Siri, I think you are with them. I don't even know why I came here, but I think you should know. Harry doesn't have anyone left except well, me, if that counts. Although actually he has someone now, someone who really loves him, but they're going to lose each other and there's nothing I can do about it...", tears ran down the werewolf's cheeks. Energetically he wiped them away.
"Hey, don’t worry. Do you ... do you want to tell me what you're always dreaming about?" Draco asked hesitantly, but Harry just shook his head.
"Of course, we wouldn't miss it," said his mother, gently stroking the boy's cheeks.
"Harry! Wake up, you're dreaming!" he said, shaking the other's shoulder. Draco tried more and more desperately to wake Harry, until he startled up and pressed his hand on the scar on his forehead.
"I'm sorry, I ... for Merlin’s sake Potter, I don't know either, I must have slipped or something," he said and sat down again.
"No, but ..."
"I see it similarly," Severus said with a mild smile.
"No ... um ... Professor Snape sent me, I get to visit Draco and Harry," he explained.
"Did I do something wrong?" he asked.
"Does that mean, so ... so we're bonding?" asked Draco, looking at Harry.
"Maybe the timing is just right. We both need someone now to keep us from despairing, don't we?" asked Remus. Severus looked up at the castle and then back at the man beside him. He kissed his temple briefly and nodded.
"What?", Draco wanted to know.
"You wish, Zabini," Draco hissed. At the same moment Remus and Severus entered the hospital wing and Hermione reached for Ron's hand.
"Mr Malfoy, stop that at once!" shouted Snape and Draco raised his arms defensively. Severus rolled his eyes and turned back to the class while Harry and Draco grinned at each other.
"I'm so sorry," he said and now he was crying too. Remus was with him immediately and pulled him into his arms.
In the corridor, they could no longer hold hands. They walked side by side in silence while Severus led the way. The stares of the other students followed them and Harry wished for nothing more than to simply have his cloak of invisibility with him. Besides, there was something else, because even though he was walking next to Draco and they weren't separated by 30 centimetres, his chest was burning and Draco seemed to be having trouble as well. He kept rubbing his stomach and chest.
"And protect you from everything else," Draco said, squeezing the other's hands tighter.
"Um ... no, well, yes, sort of, but I can manage, don't worry about it," Severus said evasively.
"Thank you," Blaise said and walked towards the door. He had a strange feeling, not knowing what to expect made him nervous, but immediately it subsided as he stepped into the room and closed the door behind him. Harry and Draco were sitting on the bed, reading. Their fingers intertwined tightly.
Narcissa and Lucius had reached the Defence classroom by now. It was supposed to be an official parent-teacher meeting and the teachers did that in their classrooms. They knocked and Severus immediately opened the door.
"Yes ..."
"You don't look like you've had much sleep," Ron said worriedly.
"Excuse me?" the indignation in Snape's voice was almost palpable. Harry looked up with tears in his eyes and Severus froze, he never thought it would hit him like this to see himself crying.
"They beat you..."
"All right. Draco, you apparate with me!" said Lucius, gripping his son's shoulder.
"Thank you for everything you have done for me. I was the first real family I had and ... and I couldn't have asked for a better one," he said haltingly and stepped back up to Draco.
"Doesn't it bother you at all?"
"Dear ones, please remain calm. It is true what you have heard. Lord Voldemort is on his way here...", gasps and murmurs went through the rows of students.
"Don't be offended right away, I meant compared to the one the house elves, sell as such," Severus said and smiled.
"From where?"
"Hey," he said.
"You're welcome to come," said the young Malfoy, emptying his glass of pumpkin juice and looking at his godfather.
"About the wedding ..."
"W-what...what happened?" he asked, briefly touching one of the deep scars on Harry/Severus' torso. Immediately it sent shivers down Severus' spine and he put some distance between himself and the others. He quickly buttoned up the shirt again.
"I don't mind if you stay .... say, do you want to come with me tonight when I take the boys to Hogsmeade? We could have a drink in the 'Three Broomsticks' while we wait for them," the teacher asked, unusually nervous. Remus looked at him in surprise, but nodded.
"I-It's not what you think. My father he is not a Death Eater..."
"Harry must die for the war to end. He has made so many sacrifices, fought his whole life and yet lost. He is only sixteen and we are dying next to his boyfriend. I just don't know what to do. I miss you so much. Sirius ... Sirius you know how much I loved you, so much that now I feel guilty because Severus asked me out for a drink. Can you believe that? Severus Snape and I, but ... with Merlin I really like him and he suffers similarly to me. Without him... I don't know if I can go on living if Harry ...," Remus sobbed out and went to his knees. Crying, he buried his face in his hands when suddenly a light breeze came up and gently stroked his hair. He looked up and right before his eyes a single white feather landed on the grave. Remus hadn't seen or heard a bird. With trembling fingers he reached out and gently stroked the feather, then he took a deep breath, stood up and nodded.
"Sex," Draco advised and Snape nodded. Harry blushed and shook his head almost imperceptibly.
"Okay, let's go," Draco said and began to undress, always making sure to stay as close to Harry as he could. By now he was wearing only his pants and looked questioningly at Harry.
"Here's a note," Draco said, reaching for the piece of paper lying next to the boys' breakfast.
"Not so fast, but don't worry. The castle is big and we have safe hiding places here. I'm going to see Dumbledore now and you stay here and don't move, understand?", Harry and Draco looked at each other and then nodded hesitantly at the man. He turned and hurried towards the exit, but then reconsidered and came back once more. Without giving it much thought, he kissed first Draco and then Harry on the forehead, then hurried outside.
"Yes, I think so too, but it could be us now, couldn't it?", Severus came closer and nodded barely noticeably.
"There was an accident at school. Harry and Draco ... a potion exploded ..." he began.
"I don't know, and where are Harry and Dray?" Blaise murmured. But that was as far as they got, for the room left them speechless. It was almost as if they were standing in a sun-drenched forest. The ground was covered with grass and flowers. Small birch trees stood at the edges of the room and in the middle was an arch decorated with forget-me-nots and other flowers. White wooden chairs stood in front of it and butterflies flew through the air, while the ceiling was adorned with drifting clouds.
"Yesterday, that was nice, thank you," Remus said and sat up.
"Just don't hurt him, okay?", Ron looked questioningly at Draco, who immediately shook his head.
"Are you all right?" asked Draco, visibly concerned. Harry nodded, but was pale and completely drenched in sweat.
"Alright, I'm looking forward to it!"
"No, and not just because it affects Draco too, I have many reasons to live, he made that clear to me."
"Well, there's often a fine line between hatred and, well, interesting. You know he has to pretend, and it's often hard for him."
"I just wanted to say thank you," Remus then said after a while of silence.
"O-okay...", Harry replied rather hesitantly.
"Yes...um yes I did, but I thought if I turned around now I'd never leave," Draco nodded and fell silent. A time passed when all that could be heard was the sound of the rushing water and the calls of the seagulls. At some point, as if out of nowhere, Draco knelt down and slid closer to Harry.
"It's all right, darling, I promised we would be all right and so will you. We'll see each other again, I believe that," she said in a trembling voice. Draco broke away from his mother and nodded. He wiped his eyes and tried a weak smile.
"Well? I'm listening!"
"But that looks bad. Did that happen in combat?"
"You? Don't you still feel sick about it?", Severus wanted to know with amusement.
"Um ... yes," Draco said sheepishly and Blaise whistled through his teeth.
"I'm sorry."
"Yeah, it's all right. That doesn't mean I like you," he said, grinning.
"HE IS DEAD!", now the Death Eaters began to move. Most of them disappeared immediately. Others didn't seem to know what to do. Bellatrix approached Draco, who immediately threw himself protectively over Harry.
"It's hard to say ... It's so unreal," he said.
"So, what do you say?", Severus Snape sat opposite the headmaster and looked at him questioningly.
"Yes, that is why we are still here. For one thing, because of you and for another, our estate is besieged by reporters, because your wedding has also become known in the meantime, of course, and now everyone is waiting for an exclusive photo," Narcissa said with a sigh.
"Thank you, I thought ... well, you could use the company," the man said and sat down.
"Because you're right. It should be my job, because I sentence them to death," Albus said. Severus nodded weakly.
"I didn't say anything because that was between her and me! She just wanted me to go and have a good cry somewhere and I didn't want to give her that triumph and now if you'll excuse me sir, I've got homework," Harry said, reaching for his school bag, which Severus had carelessly thrown on the floor.
"Pretty sure. I don't think we'll find a way to separate them again..."
"R-really?" Harry now wanted to know perplexedly.
"Sex, so what?"
"Sure and since Hogsmeade is on the schedule today, do you want me to bring you something?", Blaise wanted to know and stood up.
"Take care of yourself," he said in a brittle voice and then squeezed her in Lee's arm, pulling the crying girl with him.
"I don't know, but certainly not weeks."
"Come," he said, visibly tense, and the boys followed him. They walked silently through the silent corridors of the school and with every step Harry became more nervous. He felt the pressure of Draco's hand and yet he fought against the fear and nervousness. He didn't even notice how they stopped in front of the stone wall that hid the Room of Requirement.
"And do you know what I don't want above all? This constant attention. I don't want fame and I don't want pity, none of that! I don't want to keep dragging Ron and Hermione into everything. Sirius, was my hope for a better life, for a life away from all this..." he reached his left hand forward and Draco realised something that made his heartbeat stop short. "I must not tell lies," the scars were clearly visible despite the dim light.
"Really, you don't look it. Is everything alright between you and Draco?"
"Erm ... yes, then ... then Severus won't have to wait alone in the 'Three Broomsticks'," the werewolf said, visibly embarrassed. Draco and Harry grinned knowingly at each other, hidden under the cloak.
"Um...you can let go," Draco said, smiling.
"Bribed? With what?" Ron wanted to know. The other one grinned.
"Super! It's great fun," he said wryly.
"Oh ..."
"It ... it didn't look good. You must have had internal bleeding and..."
"Are his parents and it's just not important at the moment," said Harry quickly, who had kept Draco's secret as to the role his parents played.
"I bet you'll think of something," Remus grinned. Severus shook his head with a smile, reached for his shoes and leaned towards Remus once more.
"Yes, I guess that's right. Well, then, you two should get some more sleep and I guess you'll be besieged here in the morning. So good night," said the witch.
Draco put an arm around Harry's waist.
"Congratulations, that was so beautiful!" said Hermione with red eyes.
"It was wrong, I ... you trusted me."
"Bind you ... so d-through..."
"Are you all right again?", Hermione wanted to know, visibly concerned.
"Be that as it may. Dumbledore has agreed to the wedding tomorrow evening," Severus said, looking at the young men.
"And only when all the Horcruxes are destroyed, only then can he be killed?" asked Draco and Remus nodded.
"You heard that?", Draco looked at Harry in surprise.
"Don't worry Harry, we'll fix it. Tell me, do you know where the mistake in your potion might have been?" Harry swallowed hard.
"Well, you can see," he said, before becoming serious again.
"Yes ... you know we can't put it off forever," Dumbledore said dejectedly.
"Thanks, I borrowed it from Sev."
"You'll sleep in bed tonight, the couch is too small for you. I'll take care of the potion, don't go to sleep too late," was all Severus said.
"What about you?" asked Harry.
"It's the least I could do," Albus said, looking over at the two young men laughing boisterously with their friends.
"Eat!", Blaise put a filled plate in front of Harry.
"Move away a few steps," Madame Pomfrey now instructed the young man. He did as he was told, while the medi-witch kept an eye on Harry. After Draco had walked a little more than two metres, Harry's pain began again. Immediately and without prompting, Draco ran back to the bed.
They walked back to the dungeons together. When they entered the flat, Severus was sitting at the kitchen table and seemed to be correcting papers. When the boys entered, he put the quill aside.
"But what are the others? I mean, it could be anything!" said Draco.
"No, we've gone through all the possibilities, if we flee we'll plunge the Wizarding World into war and we don't want that," Harry said now.
"I suppose so," Harry said, then became serious.
Draco had held Harry close to him. So they lay in bed together and were silent. Unconsciously, Draco kept stroking Harry's hand, which he held and pressed against his chest. He could feel his friend's fast heartbeat and even though he felt the same, he only wanted one thing - to calm Harry down.
"Why did you do that?" he wanted to know.
-------------------------------------------------------------
"Do you have to, professor? I could also do it here...", Harry pleaded.
"Well, we'll be going then. I don't think you'll be able to attend class until ... well you know," Hermione said, playing nervously with a strand of her hair. Draco shook his head.
"Mhm ... I don't know if you should be so proud of having killed someone," Draco said thoughtfully. Dumbledore looked at him, understanding.
"Have you done this before?", Harry wanted to know, enjoying the closeness to the other.
"You all look very upset, are you sure everyone is okay?"
"Don't look like that, I'm sure it won't be so bad and then we could .... well, maybe we could go to the Room of Requirement," Draco said, grinned and knocked on the door. Severus Snape opened it.
"So I could stay here?" asked Harry then, looking again at the two children who were by now sitting in the sand, apparently building a sandcastle.
"H-how many are there?" asked Harry and again the teacher sighed, looked at Remus and stood up to walk a few paces up and down the room.
"Well then, maybe we should try to get them together, that ... that might help them both when we're gone," Draco said sadly and Harry nodded.
"Yeah, me neither, so that's good for now. Let's try something heavier," Draco said, standing up, reaching for his boxers and putting them on. Then he moved away from the bed and smiled.
"Remus, I know how I feel about you and yes, maybe it's an anchor right now too, but I don't plan on letting that 'anchor' go ever again," he said with a smile and breathed a kiss on the werewolf's lips.
"Dragon crap!" cursed Harry as he tried to tie the bow tie of his ceremonial cloak. His fingers were trembling. While he was getting ready in Severus' guest room. The latter was changing at Severus's. It was tacky, but they didn't want to see the other until just before. There was a knock and Remus came into the room.
"We can't get him stabilised, take his hand, now," the teacher said energetically. Draco didn't understand, but saw that Harry was barely breathing. As if paralysed, he sat down on the bed and reached for Harry's ice-cold hand. Immediately he seemed to relax, his breathing resumed. Severus nodded and Madame Pomfrey touched the Gryffindor with the tip of her wand.
"Me, Dracos!" said Harry immediately, earning a surprised look from his fiancé.
"Wait, I think. But when it gets serious, then ..."
"See you around," said the Weasley.
"Yes, Harry James Malfoy," Harry said, smiling.
"What do we do now?", Harry wanted to know.
"Are you all right, boys?", Remus wanted to know when they had almost reached the village.
"Maybe, but still and that's not a request," the teacher said and was gone in a moment. Harry sighed and reached for his bag.
"It's alright Remus, it's not that important. That list, it was more..."
"It was him, I'm sure of it," Blaise said, rubbing his aching bottom.
"Mhm ... you were barely breathing," Harry nodded weakly, rubbing his aching torso.
"Really? Well, I wouldn't have expected anything else from Malfoy," Ron said extra loudly, but the Malfoy ignored him.
"I don't know what to wish you either, or not, but ... well you'll be fine and if anything happens, call for help and the room will alert someone," Severus said now, looking at Harry and Draco worriedly.
"Mhm ... so now the hellebore and then ..." said Draco, bringing Harry back to the here and now. He glanced at the recipe and then at Draco. Hellebore? It didn't say that at all ... That was as far as he could get with his thoughts. There was an explosion and he and Draco were thrown against the wall. Harry only saw Slughorn hurrying towards them in a blur, then everything went black.
"I will, dragon. You've grown up so fast. Sometimes I still see you sitting on a horse for the first time when you were three, or when you got your first exercise broom at five and nearly gave your mother a heart attack because you flew straight into the crown of the chestnut tree. I am grateful that I was able to see your wedding and .... and I know you will be fine," he concluded haltingly and kissed Draco's forehead. The latter felt Harry's hand on his and reached for it.
"We thought we'd wait a little longer," Harry explained.
"Choose what?"
"Oh, oh he won't soften you up after all," Remus said with a grin. Snape gave him a barely intelligible look.
"It's okay. Are you all right?"
"I see," Severus said now, visibly glum.
"I don't know. But I do know one thing, I never want to hear you scream in pain like that again."
"Can I ask you something else?", Harry wanted to know.
"Um ... better, thank you professor", the man nodded, took a chair and pulled it to the bed.
"There you are again," Remus Lupin stood up from the kitchen table and looked inquiringly at the boys.
"Shut up Parkinson!" hissed Draco.
"What do you mean?"
"They never wanted me, they did it out of fear of Dumbledore. But they also wanted to show me where my place was. They wanted to keep me away from the wizarding world. They ... ...they wanted to break me. I had to run the household from an early age and if I made mistakes, I was punished. I didn't get much to eat and I slept... slept on the floor in a cupboard."
"Hello Draco. I'm very happy for you," he said, looking at Severus, whose gaze was pleading.
"Because you're an adult and he's a boy who's already had to fight his whole life for the same thing."
"You tell me? This is what you did."
"Are you coming?" Draco's voice snapped him out of his thoughts. The Slytherin table was emptying and Draco and Blaise seemed to have finished eating as well. Harry nodded and walked out of the hall behind them. It was close and for a brief moment they were separated, not far but enough for Harry to slump in pain.
"Yes, that's right. Thanks Blaise," the Slytherin nodded, took another deep breath and then followed Ron and Hermione.
"You will both look beautiful, it doesn't matter what you look like," Narcissa said softly.
"No, never! Severus, you must believe me."
"In the Room of Requirement at 8pm. Can you sneak out without getting caught?" Harry wanted to know and a smile was now on his lips.
"Tell me, isn't it dangerous for you to be seen together?" asked Harry.
"Minerva, can you do it?" he wanted to know. The woman stood up and nodded energetically.
---------------------------------------------------
They had just walked a few metres towards the castle when several seventh year Ravenclaw overtook them.
"I'm sorry ..." he whispered and closed his eyes.
"Let's get this over with!" he said, stepping onto one of the markers. Harry nodded in disappointment and stood on the other side of the Slytherin.
"What do you know?"
"Just promise me that we won't separate again, okay?" said Harry softly. His friend kissed him on the hair and said, "Never again!"
"Oh ... mhm ... OK, I'll try. So when you're on top, you have to be careful above all and pay close attention to your partner's signals. It's not painless for this one, but if you're gentle, then the pain is soon forgotten. The important thing is preparation and lube."
"Maybe," Remus said, emptying his glass. Severus took it from him and brought them both into the kitchen, then leaned against the wall and looked at the other thoughtfully.
"Of course," Severus said immediately.
"Well, then ... let's go," Draco said and reached for Harry's hand. Hermione sobbed and immediately Harry pulled her into his arms.
"Will he be okay?" he then wanted to know hesitantly.
"Yeah, sure," Harry said and changed things with a wave of his wand. Draco did the same and then sat down on the bed. They were only a tiny moment a little over two metres apart, but Harry immediately gasped. Draco, who now felt the burning very clearly, reacted immediately and quickly pulled him towards him by the arm. So quickly that Harry lost his balance and landed on top of the other. With a red head, he straightened up and sat down next to Draco.
"What's so funny?"
"It's all right Harry, I'm not angry. You'll know what you do or don't do," Draco said, now smiling slightly.
"Luc, please. Firstly, I don't know yet and secondly, none of your business. I should go," Severus then said and rose. Lucius nodded and stood up too.
"Okay, show what you can, but not to Neville," Harry said seriously.
"What are you afraid of?", Remus wanted to know. Harry looked at him for a few moments, then turned away and went to the window. He knew exactly what he was afraid of. This fear had haunted him ever since he had become aware of how he felt about Draco.
"Hey, stop that. It's not your fault, you hear," he said, wiping the tears from Harry's cheek.
"What? I'm on holiday!"
"W-what does that mean?", Remus wanted to know.
"Why not? It will surprise you, but I really don't want you to die," he said.
"W-what is he going to do?" wanted Draco to know.
"A-And then?" asked Draco hesitantly, trying to suppress the tears that were welling up.
"Uncle Sev, quickly," Draco called, kneeling on the blanket next to a groaning Harry. Immediately he was with them and saw that the young man must be in pain. He called up a potion and put it to Harry's lips, who drank gratefully.
Lucius Malfoy knocked the dust off his shoes, took a deep breath and entered the Manor. He was exhausted as he was every time he came from a Death Eaters meeting. How he hated it, but they did it for Draco. He had joined the Death Eaters because it was expected of a Malfoy and so he did, offering his services to the Ministry as a spy. After the first Wizarding War, Lucius had hoped that he and his family could live peacefully, but he had been wrong. Since Voldemort's return, he has always lived in fear of discovery, for by now no one could be trusted in the Ministry either, and so Lucius works in the dark, trying to protect Muggle-borns and half-bloods through detours. The affair between Draco and Potter made everything much more complicated.
"Well, the movement looks great," Remus said, arms folded. Draco and Harry felt very silly standing there and spinning in circles.
"Are you all right?" the latter wanted to know.
Draco awoke with a jolt. For a moment he didn't know where he was, then it came back to him. It was dark in the hospital wing. Draco rubbed his eyes. Harry was lying next to him and moaning. He tossed and turned, muttering unintelligible words. The Slytherin quickly turned on the bedside lamp.
"What do we do now?", Harry then wanted to know and squeezed the hand that still rested on his chest.
"Thank you Blaise," Draco said, his voice now trembling too.
"Yes," he heard Draco's voice softly, then he opened the door and entered the flat. He waited a moment, then closed it again and at the same moment the boys pulled their cloaks off their heads.
"Crabbe's an idiot!" said Draco, smiling wanly. Severus didn't know how to react, so he just nodded.
"At that time I thought I would never see you again and it tore me apart. At that moment there at the edge of the forest, I just couldn't bear never to see you again," he said and came closer. Draco was now so close that the tips of their noses were almost touching.
"Draco and Potter's bond was forced, you can't compare that. Real soul mates don't suffer pain when they separate from the other, because the bond has to be sealed first and after ... so after the bond is sealed, they would die if the other dies, but suffer no pain if they are separated. They would be unhappy, but nothing more."
"H-He's coming," Harry said haltingly.
"No, but I didn't want it to end here and now," he said breathlessly, turning off the water and pulling Harry out of the shower. Quickly he dried them with a spell and kissed Harry again. Backwards, he pushed him back into the bedroom. At some point Harry felt the bed against the back of his knees and let himself fall. Draco lay over him and for the first time their naked bodies touched in full. They both groaned and had to break the passionate kiss briefly. Gently, Draco stroked Harry's cheek.
"You're serious?", Draco wanted to know. Severus rubbed his eyes.
"Seems we're exempt from classes," Harry said bitterly.
"Why? Why do you always want to manage everything alone?"
"Yes."
"Why fight? He wants Potter, why don't we give him to him?", the call came from Pansy Parkinson, who was standing with the Slytherins.
"Yes, I thought you would want to, and it would only be fair. I'll get them here in the morning and you can tell them then."
"And they've grown fond of you."
"Ron, we can't dress up and someone else will notice," Hermione murmured back.
"But darling ..." said Narcissa in a brittle voice.
"What?"
"Sev?", Narcissa looked up in surprise and Lucius also put his book down on the page.
"But do you think I could be happy if you were dead and it had been my fault?"
"W-What does that mean for us now?", Draco wanted to know after Severus had finished his narration. Harry sat rigidly next to the Slytherin and stared into space.
They sat on the bed again and ate breakfast. Draco now seemed to be paying close attention to Harry's eating. Harry felt strangely relieved after the conversation, even if he was afraid that Draco would tell someone, but for this moment, it was the right thing to do.
"It's getting serious," Severus said, looking at the man knowingly. The man nodded with a sigh.
After the lesson, Draco automatically grabbed the Gryffindor's arm and pulled him towards Herbology.
"We say that it is simply too crowded at the Slytherin table and that you both prefer to eat alone, that Mr. Potter does not feel comfortable at the Slytherin table. Also, you don't engage in any conversation regarding your condition. If anyone asks, say that I and Professor Slughorn are confident that the bond is only temporary."
"You look good," Harry said as Remus tied his bow tie.
"Peace children, everyone is right. Daddy is a hero and so is Pa," Draco Malfoy came into the living room and gave his husband a kiss on the cheek.
"Yeah, me too, in a way, you impossible child," Severus said, smiling.
"What if he turns you in to you-know-who?" asked Ron anxiously.
"What's worrying you?", Remus Lupin wanted to know and accepted the glass of wine from the waitress.
"Madame Pomfrey, quick!" shouted Ron and the medi-witch came running at once.
"Harry, who says I want this? I know we've only been together for a few days, but I already know that I can't or won't live without you. I love you and I'd rather die next to you than without you," Draco said, leaning forward and kissing Harry demanding. Tears ran down Harry's cheek again, tasting salty on both their lips.
"Yes ... isn't there any other solution?" Ron wanted to know, his voice strangely scratchy.
"Yes, thank you," Harry said.
"Uncle Sev, sex is not really something you plan."
"No Sev, I want ... I want to hold my son at least one last time before ...", Narcissa sobbed.
"I swore and I promised. We promised ... Sirius and I ..."
"It's good, you hear me."
"I need to tell you a little bit about you-know-who and I want you to just listen to me for now, all right?" asked Snape and Harry and Draco nodded.
"I'm really glad you feel that way."
"Excuse me, but we had to dodge Filch," he said as they caught up with the others.
"Nice, but if you want, you're welcome to sleep here. The boys, they'll ... well they'll probably go back to their houses if everything worked out and if not, they go to the hospital wing, so I have a room available," Severus said, looking almost a little embarrassed. Remus looked at him irritated.
"You don't look happy," Hermione said, putting a hand on Harry's shoulder.
"I know the memories. Your father also beat you and humiliated you, why didn't you ever tell anyone? I just didn't want to appear weak and I was just afraid of where I would end up," Harry said almost defiantly. Snape sighed deeply. The brat would mean his grave once more.
After class, they walked together to Potions. It was the first time they sat here after her accident and Harry wasn't the only one who had a queasy feeling. Slughorn watched them warily the whole time. The task today was not really difficult and with the book of the Half-Blood Prince's, Harry managed to finish his potion very quickly.
"I think it's much better this way," Harry said energetically.
"Nothing, but if James saw us he would probably faint," the werewolf said and laughed.
"Yes, I...", Draco buried his face in his hands and sobbed. Severus stroked his leg soothingly.
"We'll be right there," Severus said.
"What on Merlin are you doing?" he wanted to know and stepped up to him. Harry was about to defend himself when the mixture began to bubble violently and then everything went black.
"Morning, so it wasn't a dream," Harry said and sat up.
"Yes, better now than tomorrow," Severus said energetically and pointed to the door. The boys looked at each other worriedly, but followed the teacher.
"You always make it exciting," Blaise said with a smile.
"Please," said the teacher. The werewolf looked at the other inquiringly for a while, then he began to tell.
" Tell ... tell me about the blow job, can you?" he asked, suppressing a groan as Draco sucked hard on the sensitive skin above his ribs. Draco looked up and grinned.
"Yes, we would like to do this, but ... but we thought we'd be allowed to use yours. Mum used to recite it to me a lot and it suits us so well, only if you want to of course," the Slytherin said. Narcissa looked in surprise at her husband, whose lips were curling into a smile.
"No, and in the meantime we are of the opinion that there will be no separation. The two have confessed their love to each other in the meantime, which surely does not surprise you headmaster. We have come to the conclusion that the potion did not create a soul bond at all, but somehow activated it. It has always been there and that means, by implication, that the two of them, as it stands now, must bond. The pain is increasing and according to Poppy, a prolonged separation could be fatal, for both of them," Severus concluded. Albus shook his head and stood up. He paced restlessly and was silent for quite some time. The silence was oppressive, but Severus waited.
"Yes ... so we ... I wanted to marry him so much before ...", Harry tried to find words.
"Okay stop, we haven't got that far yet. I know it wouldn't be in your best interest if your son had to commit himself to Potter..."
"Good, thank you headmaster."
"What are you doing?" asked Remus, getting dressed as well.
"Maybe," he said with a smile and gave the other a shy kiss.
"No, no, no we certainly won't ... kill you or let you die," Draco almost shouted.
"Have you ... have you this more often?" asked Severus now, his voice unusually soft. Harry shook his head.
Severus' mind raced. He tried to breathe calmly.
"Nothing more," he said tonelessly.
"You've messed up again. What else could I have expected. It was a mistake to put you on the advanced course..."
"No, it's the last thing they want to do and even though they're both very young, we both know they won't grow old together," Severus said bitterly.
"I messed up again and the potion exploded and thank you, I slept very well," Severus said tonelessly and stood up.
"You're scared," Harry nodded and lowered his gaze. Draco put a hand under his chin, forcing him to look up.
"You Miss Parkinson keep working and the next time you verbally attack fellow students you will meet the same fate," Snape hissed and turned back to his lessons.
"Eight. I have to go to class in a minute," Severus said and sat down in the armchair facing the couch.
"Sure! Have you never been to the sea?" Draco looked questioningly at the other. He shook his head sadly. His father put an arm around his shoulder.
"What?"
"Yes, in a way. You only know him as the strict teacher, but I grew up with him. He's like a second father to me," Draco said dejectedly. Harry slid closer again and rested his head on the other's chest. They intertwined their hands after Draco had turned out the light again.
"Please Draco, just don't ask any more questions, okay?"
"Of course I do! I promised Lily I'd look after him and even though it's been hard for me to treat him normally all these years, I care about him and always have and since I know how he must have suffered with his relatives, even more and you're telling me now that it was all for nothing, that we just raised him like a pig for slaughter?"
"What is it then that gives you cause for concern?", Albus wanted to know and made two cups of tea appear.
"Time's up soon," Severus said with a sigh.
"Tonight already?", Ron wanted to know in surprise.
"Just the burning, but more intense than before."
"I don't hate you and I never have. I know you didn't mean for any of that to happen, but it just hurt, you know? Trusting someone is pretty hard for me and somehow it was different with you, that's why I was so hurt," Harry explained and hadn't even noticed how he was holding Draco's hand again.
"Good, so what would we have to do?" he asked and immediately Harry looked at him.
"What do you think happens now?" asked Harry at one point and Draco looked at him perplexed.
"What do you mean you saw it?"
"I don't have to," Voldemort said and laughed. Some of the Death Eaters laughed too, including Draco's Aunt Bellatrix. Draco himself couldn't see much behind Harry. He only felt the other's hand squeezing his and preventing him from coming forward again.
"It was me, professor. I alone botched the potion," he said quickly. Snape looked at him inquiringly, but said nothing more.
"Yes, it's hardly been a few months ...", Narcissa said, brushing a blonde strand out of her son's forehead.
"Apparently, in certain situations, I can access Potter's memories and he...he can access mine," Severus explained.
"Well, I guess it's doubtful we'll ever try it, but thank you," Harry said with a smile.
"Mhm ...", Harry made. As they ran down the stairs, Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy came towards them. Briefly, their eyes lingered on Harry. He swallowed hard, but for a brief moment, the Malfoys dropped their arrogant and cool masks and smiled at him. It was only a moment, but it meant a lot to Harry.
"Severus, I beg you, accusations will not help us," Dumbledore suddenly stood in the room. Madame Pomfrey still looked irritatedly back and forth between the two, while the Headmaster looked directly at the Harry/Severus. Then he turned to the real Harry, in Severus' body.
"She started it!", Draco tried to defend himself.
"Will you do that for me?", Harry nodded with a grin. Sirius stroked his hair briefly and then stood up.
"Mhm ... we have to wish for a room first. You or me?" asked Draco.
"Mal...I mean Draco, what can I do for you?" he asked, trying the arrogant tone Snape always gave him.
"Morning and yes, but today I hardly slept anyway," he said.
"Good morning, I ... are you all right?" the potions master wanted to know as he looked at his best friend.
"How are they?", Narcissa wanted to know, visibly pale, when the teacher had finished.
"He's pretty relaxed, isn't he?" asked Blaise then and Draco took his eyes off Harry and looked to him.
"Tell me, Snape is really your uncle?", Harry wanted to know after they had extinguished the light and both had been silent for a while.
It was getting late. Severus wanted to go to his romms, but then changed his mind. He turned and walked to the hospital wing. All was quiet. He entered the ward, which was empty except for the bed he had enlarged himself. Quietly he stepped closer. Potter was lying on his back, breathing calmly and evenly. Draco had lain down on his side and, to Severus' surprise, was clutching Harry's hand tightly. Severus looked back at Harry and sighed softly.
"I can't, because you won't believe this, but I'm in a lot of pain now too," Draco said and Harry turned to him. The other was pale and holding his stomach.
"The noble Potter, does like to make things up with himself," he said cynically.
"Harry, I'm not alone - not anymore. I couldn't be prouder of you and I know James, Lily and Sirius are too and I know you'll see them and that comforts me," he said, hugging Harry tightly. He didn't want to cry, wanted to stay strong even though it was tearing him up inside. He had lost Lily and James, and later Sirius. Harry was all he had left, and now he too would go. Then he felt Severus' hand on his back and broke away from Harry. He looked at Draco and stroked his shoulder briefly.
"There must be something. For years Dumbledore has allowed these Muggles to torment him and now he sends him and Draco to their deaths?"
"I didn't say anything, but Uncle Sev was worried about your nightmares. He could tell I knew more, so I ... I showed him your back," Draco said quietly. Harry shook his head, tears streaming down his cheeks, and he turned back to the parapet.
"Are you watching me?", Severus was pulled out of his thoughts and looked into Remus' green eyes.
"All right," said Draco and Harry now nodded too. Madame Pomfrey nodded too and enlarged the bed.
"So what do we?" asked Draco the next morning as they stood together in the bathroom.
"You need to pay more attention," Blaise said simply.
"Yes, I do. You know Dray, we're going to die together either way, no matter what we decide, but with the bond we might have another hundred wonderful years, but without ..." said Harry. Draco nodded with a smile, leaned forward and kissed him. Severus rose.
"So you're a double spy?"
"Yes, Remy I'm fine," Harry said and immediately found himself pulled into a hug.
"Thanks Severus, we'll be fine," Draco said, squeezing Harry's hand tighter.
"Well Potter, can't you hurt your lover," sneered Pansy Parkinson.
"Sirius?" gasped Harry, running towards the other. Sirius Black looked as young as Harry had ever seen him. He smiled and shook his head at the same time.
"Yes, anyway," said Ron, clearly blushing.
"Thank you Headmaster," Lucius Malfoy said, standing at the other end of the room with his wife, the Headmaster, Severus and Remus.
"Yes, why not," he then said and made an inviting hand gesture.
"After the holidays. Then Lily will have a place in the kindergarten at the ministry and I can go back to work. The year with her at home went by pretty quickly," he said and squeezed Harry's hand tighter. Severus watched the two of them closely.
"Yes, I just forgot for a moment why we were here," he said.
"B-But that means..." stuttered Harry, looking at Draco, who by now had tears running down his cheeks.
"It's okay, I wasn't always ... er ... easy," Harry said.
"Wow ... Well, nobody believes that anyway," said Ron and the others laughed.
"No Harry, you can't. The students would want to know why the potions professor is in the hospital wing. It's better if no student knows about your accident, not even your friends," Dumbledore said and Harry nodded, albeit hesitantly.
"Ah Severus, my boy. Do come in. I've already heard that Harry and Draco are back in the hospital wing," Albus said as Severus entered the room.
"Draco is fine. Potter will recover, but it was very close," he explained.
"Fine, but anyway, let's go to Lucius' study," Severus said and left the drawing room. Confused, Narcissa and Lucius followed him. The Malfoy's study was covered with powerful protective spells, for as a spy for the Ministry, the man trusted no one since Voldemort's return.
"It's fine as long as Draco stays around. Hard to believe I'm even saying this," Harry said, smiling bitterly as Draco rolled his eyes.
"Excuse me?", Remus wanted to know irritated.
"What do you say when someone sees you like this, that is, in the fancy clothes?" the disembodied voice wanted to know from Harry.
"Harry," he said and embraced the young man. Harry cried and pressed himself tightly against his godfather. The latter stroked his head and held him tightly.
"Yes, but ... alright. I won't say anything, but I'll show you," Draco hesitantly reached for Harry's sleeping shirt and carefully pulled it up a little. Now Severus could see the Gryffindor's back. Even in the rather dim light, he could make out the battered skin. Scars of all kinds covered the narrow back.
"He's coming," Severus said and jumped out of bed. He reached for his trousers and shirt and pulled them on.
"I came right after you. When I got to the top, I thought I'd let you sort it out on your own. I wanted to intervene as soon as he was on the wall, but Minerva joined in and said it was too dangerous. It was only when he was about to climb down and then hesitated that we intervened."
"Don't look like it at all," Draco said.
"Sure, but the counter-potion takes a week," he said with a groan.
Inwardly. Wait, had Draco just said "uncle"? It didn't help. He straightened his shoulders and opened.
"See you then," Ron said to Harry and you could tell that, like Blaise, he was reluctant to leave the station. Slughorn and Madame Pomfrey also left and so Harry and Draco were now alone. Indecisively, Draco stood beside the bed.
"Yeah, I guess, but it wouldn't have been uncomplicated before either. How ... so how long have you been?" asked Draco uncertainly.
"That means that if I'm not really dead, then Draco isn't either and .... but what are you doing here, are you also just a fantasy?", Sirius smiled again and looked briefly at the children who were still playing tag.
"Mhm ... I'll tell you ... someday," Harry said with a smile.
"Sure professor! All your fault Potter!" hissed Draco and disappeared from the room. Harry looked after him, aghast. He knew it was just an act, but it still stung him.
"Nonsense, he wouldn't listen to me at all."
"This from your mouth," Harry said with a smile and then Remus and Severus were standing by the bed.
"It's okay," he said and swallowed hard. His throat was parched. Draco seemed to understand, reached for a glass of water on the bedside table and handed it to Harry.
"Why should it?" the teacher wanted to know.
"No, I don't think so. I'm here to ... to ask your permission, so to speak," Severus said sheepishly.
"What about Draco and Harry?"
"Yes, sometimes I do."
They walked in silence up to the castle and into Severus' flat. Remus was getting more and more worried, because he really had never seen Severus like this before. It was true, many years had passed since the time of the marauders and although Remus had never really taken part in Sirius' and James' pranks, he was part of it and he couldn't blame Severus for resenting him too. Over the years they had only ever seen each other sporadically and mostly at the Order meetings, the fact that the Potions Master now even took him with him only worried Remus immeasurably more.
"The green light and then there was Sirius and the sea and our children."
"Hey, yeah I'm going to die too because we have a soul bond, but we'll be together and that's all that matters," Draco said, squeezing Harry's hand tighter.
"Yes, I know what you mean," the teacher said, pouring himself a coffee.
"Um yeah sure, I don't want to miss the wedding and .... well, I should stay near the school," he said quickly. Before anyone else could say anything, the portrait of Salazar Slytherin hanging above the fireplace cleared its throat.
"Er...guessed!" said Harry quickly and before Snape could say anything else back he blacked out and fell to the floor.
"Yes in the Room of Requirement. We ... well, we shouldn't lose any time."
"Whether I stay or return, to you," Harry said with a smile.
"Where is he?", Ron wanted to know quietly, but at the same moment Blaise appeared out of breath at the top of the stairs.
"I was hoping for a separation of the two, then it would have only affected Harry."
"Have a nice day, but stay in the flat. Like Severus, I won't be back until late afternoon. Love Remus," Draco read and grinned.
"What is it?" he wanted to know and the other seemed to feel caught.
"Yes, it seems so. I like them very much, although I hardly know them."
"If that's what you want ..."
"I know they were the first friends you ever had and they were like your family, even more so after your parents died," completely surprised, Remus looked at the other.
"Are you sure you want to take in a sixteen year old? Not the easiest age," Severus said, amused.
"A soul bond? B-But that's extremely rare and only ... so it doesn't need a potion," Horace stammered.
"Thank you, Professor!" he said and was gone before the latter could react.
"Very good, most of them are destroyed. I think only two are missing. The snake and ... and something else we could identify," Dumbledore said, visibly hesitant. Severus knew he was getting nowhere here. So he stood up and straightened his shoulders.
"I'm so sorry. I wasn't thinking and it was only when the burning started that ... I went straight back to you, but you were already unconscious. Hagrid brought you here and Madame Pomfrey and Professor Snape saved you. I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to," Draco explained, visibly contrite. Harry shook his head.
Severus and Remus walked silently towards the large lake. It was still quite early and cool and hardly any students were to be seen.
"Sex in the prefects‘ bathroom," he deciphered.
"Hey morning, good to see you without .... well, him," he said and lowered himself down next to Harry.
"Your soul mate? Lucius...", Voldemort looked questioningly at the Malfoy.
"When?" he asked.
"Come on, we're really going to be late," Draco said and together they walked towards the greenhouses. Harry was silent and stared at the ground in front of him. Draco watched him out of the corner of his eye.
"The chair is too far away and I'm sure my wand is still in the classroom," he said.
"So Sev, what's going on. Did they bond? Are they all right? We just met Harry alone, so it seems to have worked," Narcissa began. Appeasingly, Severus raised his arms.
"Yes, and I'll get the house elves to pack everything. We'll be back here this afternoon. Get some rest."
"I thought it was a good idea to get them to stop bashing each other's heads in, and it worked. They are now one heart and soul," the teacher defended himself.
"What are you doing here?" he wanted to know.
"What do you think? Of course he told me and also Sirius and reproached us for treating you like that. He was angry and disappointed. He's not James, Severus!" said Remus resignedly. Severus wanted to say something back, but then the door opened and the rest of the students entered.
"Three students are at the door," the Founder said and Severus nodded.
"Harry ... he's... he's the last Horcrux?"
"Mhm ... Yes, godfather. I've known him all my life. You know, he's... he's really okay. Here at school, it's different and towards you ... I don't know, he's really weird."
"So Madame Pomfrey first or dinner first?" asked Draco as they stood outside the classroom. Harry groaned, he had suppressed the enquiry until just now.
"Yeah, come on let's get something to eat and well ... enjoy the time, sort of," Draco said, standing up and holding out his hand to Harry. Harry nodded and let his friend pull him out of the room.
"Ready?" he asked.
"Mr. Malfoy do you feel pain when you move away from Mr. Potter?" the medi-witch now wanted to know.
"Snape saved me?" he asked a counter question instead. Draco nodded.
"Well, then ... I'll go and see him in a moment. You'll have dinner with Remus, please. I'll do my evening rounds and at nine we'll go to the village!" everyone present nodded. Severus grabbed his cloak again and disappeared from the flat.
"Word of honour," Sirius said, breaking away from Harry. He walked down the beach and took the two children by the hand, who now looked at Harry and waved.
"So it worked?" she whispered and Harry nodded weakly.
"If you say so," the Weasley said, but gave Draco, who had his back turned, a disparaging look.
"I will," he said and then turned to Harry.
"Yes, no one must know. We'll be careful," Blaise said immediately.
"Thanks," Draco said with a grin and pulled the other into a deep kiss.
"What do you know," Severus hissed.
"Sure," Harry said. The man nodded, leaned forward and whispered something in his godson's ear.
"Here, this is a dreamless potion. It should help for tonight at least," he said and handed Harry the vial, inside of which a purple potion could be seen. Hesitantly, the Gryffindor reached for it.
"Are you sure, I mean his parents ...", Ron interjected.
"Mhm ... I don't know, they were kind of weird, but can you imagine? They weren't exactly friends in their school days," Harry said.
"We'll talk tomorrow Severus. I'll let Albus know and they'll be excused from class for the time being," McGonagall said.
"He ... he's coming here?" Ron wanted to know, visibly pale.
"I'm going to go out on a limb here, but let's test it," Draco said, letting go of Harry's hand, which he had been holding tightly until just now, quite automatically.
"Umbridge? Why her of all people?"
"The boy is as good as blind, despite his glasses. No wonder he can't see anything at the blackboard. Possibly...", Severus thought aloud.
"Why don't you find a seat, I'll go somewhere quickly," the teacher said a little louder and Remus nodded. The parlour was well filled that evening. Severus quickly crossed the room and turned right to the toilets. Draco and Harry had to be careful not to bump into anyone by accident and just managed to avoid the waitress. Severus ran past the toilets and to the stairs leading upstairs.
"Yeah ... well I didn't think much of it, but James and Sirius ... they were ..."
"This is between you and me Tom, so you do what you have to do, but you don't touch Draco!" he shouted in the face of the wand.
"Hello Grandpa Sev!" the child squeaked, hanging onto his hip. Rolling his eyes, Severus lifted the boy into his arms.
"Wow, you look good," Blaise said, giving them both a quick hug.
Harry rolled back and forth next to Draco. The Slytherin woke up and knelt down next to his husband, who was obviously in pain.
"And the Death Eaters?", Hermione wanted to know.
"Th-thank you ... how long have you been standing there?" he then wanted to know. Remus came closer and hugged him.
"Um ... could you make the bed bigger, Professor?" he asked. Severus raised an eyebrow sceptically, but took his wand and immediately the bed was twice as wide. Draco kicked off his shoes and sat down completely on the bed without letting go of Harry's hand for a second.
"Well, I don't think you'll get rid of me that quickly."
"Harry's right. You are a great teacher Professor," Draco said and smiled. Hagrid nodded gratefully and let them go.
Two days passed and Harry and Draco's condition worsened. In the meantime, they had to maintain skin contact, for the pain could hardly be endured any other way. Severus and also Madame Pomfrey saw this with deep concern. Severus had asked the Malfoys for a talk the next day, even though he still had no idea how to make them understand that their son had to die next to Harry. For the last few days he had been looking for a way out, but had found none. He had even considered taking the boys away, but that would not stop Voldemort. So the Potions Master allowed himself to be seen very little in the hospital wing, for it was becoming increasingly difficult for him to look Harry and Draco in the eye. Nevertheless, he came here that evening, because Poppy had sent for him.
"Thank you," said the latter and emptied the glass.
"Well, let's go. Draco's parents will be waiting," the teacher said. Harry took out the cloak and threw it over himself and Draco.
"Yes, but one Harry destroyed ..." he said and the Gryffindor looked up in confusion, but then he understood.
"Harry dear, well ... well, that was a surprise. Congratulations! To you, too, of course, Draco," Molly said. Harry looked at his husband, who nodded invitingly.
"Dad, come on. I know becoming an Auror has always been a thorn in your side, but it's really not as dangerous as you think. In the meantime, I sit more in the office anyway and at least I have a healer at home," he said and reached for Draco's hand.
"Yes, thank you, I'll pass," said the Weasley, raising his arms defensively.
"Oh, he's not that poor, because he lets me do the homework. But tell me, is Snape really your uncle?"
"May I?"
"Good morning to you too!" said Remus, closing the door.
"I love you too, but why now, why so soon?"
"Thank you!"
"Um ... well, we don't really know that either. At the moment Draco shows hardly any symptoms when he is separated, so it could be that he wouldn't die, but ..."
"Yes, I know. He's calling his followers together, it can't be much longer."
"If we help them."
"Wow, that's ... I mean he would have really jumped?"
"Come on now, I want it to be over," Draco said, looking promptly at Harry.
"Harry? Are you sure you're OK?" asked Ron.
"I know, but it would be dangerous for both of you otherwise. But yes I understand you, after all you are soul mates," Blaise whispered and stopped when he felt Slughorn's scrutinising gaze on him.
"Hey," Draco said, looking around as well, then kissing Harry quickly.
"Severus, where is Harry?" she wanted to know, quivering.
"I love you and always will, but here and now we both have to let go," he said and pulled his sobbing son close to him, not without including Harry in the embrace as well. He too was crying and Narcissa, equally distraught, stroked both boys' hair steadily.
"Let's try anyway."
"Sure, but ... but the boys, they told us their last wish," Narcissa said, trying to bring her trembling voice back under control.
"What's it like with the Slytherins?", Hermione wanted to know quietly.
Harry walked alone through the corridors towards the Great Hall. He and Draco had gathered their things and changed. It was hard for them to part, but they also knew how important it was that no one knew of their love, no one except their closest friends. So Draco had given him a few minutes head start. Now, as Harry entered the hall, he saw Hermione already sitting at the table. There were still few students there, but everyone present, seemed to be watching him. He quickly went to Hermione and sat down. She smiled mildly.
"But why?", Ron wanted to know.
"Oh yeah? Dad send you?"
"What is it?" he asked anxiously.
"How do we get to Hogsmeade?" the Slytherin wanted to know.
"Yes, we don't know how much time we have," Harry said quietly.
"Really?"
"Sure, but we don't need anything. Just be there tonight, okay?"
"Well, that you would ever be so worried about the boy."
"Yeah, it's all well," Harry said, closing his eyes.
"Harry, look at us," Narcissa asked and the young man raised his eyes.
"Harry, Draco!" cried Hermione, and she just couldn't help hugging the two surprised boys.
"...then we'll get you some sensible clothes, unbelievable what rags you're running around in and you certainly won't be going back to your relatives' house. You'll come with me during the holidays, a little tutoring can't hurt anyway," Snape said and stood up.
"Yes, but it doesn't help, or is it the we you're concerned with?"
"That's okay, scars are just memories," Harry said, stroking them.
"They're your family, aren't they?", Draco wanted to know and Harry averted his eyes from the door.
"You won't tell them anything, I beg you Severus."
"Being brave doesn't mean you're not afraid, it means you do it anyway. Don't forget that!" said the headmaster, turning away and running back to the school, while Harry and Draco stayed behind near the edge of the forest.
"Y-yeah, it's fine," he said erratic and looked at Severus, who was looking at him sternly.
"Let's not do this now," Hermione said, pointing her wand at Draco and casting the counterspell. The Malfoy looked up from his book and folded it shut.
"What are these nightmares?"
"Yeah, sure...um, although Dad still hasn't said where we're going."
"C-Can we stay here tonight?", Draco wanted to know.
"You can do it," Dumbledore said, patting him on the back. Snape was seething, Harry could see that clearly. He knew his face and it certainly didn't look like it was going to be a pleasant week.
"Did he just say he was happy?", Harry wanted to know in a whisper.
"When ... when were you planning to tell me or the boys?"
"Do you think it worked?", Harry now wanted to know anxiously.
"Potter, on time after all, which was not necessarily to be expected. Now sit down," Snape said snidely and pointed to the seat in front of which Harry was already standing. He put down his things and did as he was told.
"Understandable," Remus said.
"Harry, why are you thinking about this?" asked Draco gently.
"Harry? Harry, open your eyes," Ron's voice trembled. With difficulty Harry opened his eyes. Ron, Hermione and Slughorn were kneeling in front of him. The Gryffindor looked beside him. Draco was conscious and sitting pale against the wall.
"DRACO!!!" screamed Neville as the others knelt beside Harry. Immediately Draco ran back and sank down on the floor beside Harry, panting. The latter was by now unconscious. Blood was running from his mouth and his breathing was shallow and rapid.
"You too ... I love you," Severus said and was gone in a moment.
"And yet you want him to die?"
He startled awake again only a few hours later. Harry beside him was screaming and rolling from side to side. Draco was immediately wide awake, turned on the light and held the struggling Harry by the shoulders.
"Yes, I see..." said Remus, swallowing hard. Severus looked at him worriedly and put a hand on the werewolf's cheek.
"Single room, not bad," Blaise said and casually sat down on the chair that was next to the bed. The two young men looked at him, startled for a moment, then put the books aside. Harry immediately wanted to pull his hand out of Draco's, but Draco held him tightly.
"You promised!" the Gryffindor said angrily and stood up.
"You remembered that?"
"What?"
"Yeah sorry, I'm happy for you dude, but Malfoy?"
"Good, you're done. Potter, do you think you can leave the hospital wing?"
"You know sometimes I think I'm still lying on the forest floor and I'm imagining it all," Harry said abruptly. Draco looked at his husband, whose gaze went into the distance. Gently he stroked the slight laugh lines on his eyes that had come in the last few years. Then he kissed him desiringly.
"That's where I have my free period," he groaned.
"Uncle Sev, means his family too," Draco said with a grin and Harry couldn't say anything now.
"All right, but you don't have to rush into anything. Until then, you'll stay here in Poppy's care. We'll find you a ... a suitable room for you, but not today and not tomorrow, all right?"
"Because she tortured you, and believe me, if she were here, I'd shock her!" said Draco angrily, and Harry smiled.
"I'll get them if it's all right?"
"Not really, but stay," Severus said, now looking inquiringly at the other.
"Come on, talk to me," he asked. Harry looked up. He didn't know why, but suddenly he began to talk.
"Sorry."
A Hufflepuff girl screamed and covered her ears, more and more joined in and Harry too went to his knees. Voldemort was no longer just in his head, he was in everyone's heads and he spoke, "Give me Harry Potter and I will spare your lives, no harm will come to you, but refuse and I will reduce the school to rubble and none of your pathetic protection spells will be of any use to you. Dumbledore is an old fool and cannot protect you. Give me Potter, you have one hour! I'll be waiting in the Forbidden Forest, Potter. Come and none of your friends will be hurt!" As quickly as the voice had come, it had disappeared again. Now panic broke out, students shouted in confusion, ran around until Dumbledore silenced them all with a simple: "QUIET! "
"It's all good, okay?"
"Yes, I suppose so."
"I couldn't!"
"Believe me boys, we would do it. We'd leave with you, but it wouldn't help. If the Lord knew Harry was a Horcrux, he would hunt him down and if he didn't, he would plunge the Wizarding World deeper and deeper into this war," Severus explained and you could tell how much he was fighting his own tears.
"Well, you almost killed him in your recklessness. He had internal bleeding that could hardly be stopped. Through your connection you were able to transfer some of your magic to him and so he was able to begin to heal and now tell me why you did that, even though I can understand it not being easy around him, you knew what was at stake," Severus said seriously. Draco was his godchild and he had known him since birth, all the more reason for him to care for his welfare and if Potter died, there was still the possibility that Draco would not survive this either.
"Yes that's true, but maybe ... maybe he just can't forget or forgive. I understand that."
"Are you really going to make him sleep on the floor?", Blaise wanted to know when they had all finished.
"Okay," was all Harry could get out. The headmaster nodded and then walked towards Severus.
"Does Snape have a guest room that big, like, for two beds?" asked Ron. Immediately Harry blushed and sheepishly reached for another plant.
"Yeah, really, dude. When Lucius Malfoy brought you here, you wouldn't believe how it felt to see you hanging lifeless in his arms," Ron said, visibly upset.
"Alright then, since this year, I see him differently. It's hard and so far only Blaise knows about it and...", Harry's mind raced. What was Draco trying to tell him? Was it what he thought it was? His heart suddenly leapt back into place.
"No, don't do that," Severus said and Harry stopped in his tracks.
"Are you ready?" the latter now wanted to know and stepped into the room of the now seventeen-year-old.
"But you have a clue," it was not a question from the teacher, but a statement.
"Why not? The bed is big enough," Blaise fired back.
"We?"
"Come on!" he shouted and Hermione and Ron rushed to him.
"I don't know, but if you hadn't been there then ... then maybe yes."
"Ron!" hissed Hermione angrily.
"What shall we do?" Narcissa wanted to know in a quivering voice. Lucius stood up, sat down next to his wife and pulled her into his arms.
"Because her sister Bellatrix let herself be seduced by Tom Riddle and fell for him, and Mum wanted to save her. But since last year, since ... you know what happened to your godfather, she's very sorry about that and she realised that she couldn't save Bellatrix anymore or even wanted to because one thing the Malfoys and Blacks hold very dear is family and you don't kill or hurt members of that family and Sirius was family," Draco concluded. Harry didn't say anything for some time. The memory of Sirius pained him and he could hardly put into words his hatred for Bellatrix Lestrange, even though she was Draco's aunt.
"Well Severus, can you say something about it?" the Headmaster wanted to know, addressing the Potions Master.
"Good idea, except that it will be quite short, as we certainly don't have that much time left."
Harry didn't know why he had told about it. In reality, he was flooded with Snape's memories all day. Whenever he relaxed a little and tried not to think about anything. The more he tried to block out the memories, the more violently they came. Snape had not had a pleasant childhood and youth. His father was violent and drank. His mother loved Snape, but she was depressed and certainly seemed to withdraw more and more. They both died shortly after each other and Snape was alone. In addition, there was the harassment by the maruders and the loss of Lily as a friend. Harry also kept seeing Remus in front of him. It seemed Snape had a special relationship with the werewolf. Sighing, Harry skimmed Snape's notes from class and found that the teacher had been very thorough and so he had no problems completing the homework. He was tired and hoped Snape's offer was serious. He went into the bathroom and undressed. It was no use. He desperately needed a shower and resolved to get it over with quickly. After all, he had to admit that Snape was more well-trained than he had assumed. However, he didn't really know how to deal with the shoulder-length hair. Apparently Snape was always putting something in his hair, but Harry didn't know what, so he just let it dry without anything and thought it looked better anyway.
"Don't go anywhere, okay?" whispered Harry, pressing himself even closer to Draco. The latter kissed his husband's temple and shook his head.
"I liked you when we were at school too, but there were the marauders and well, Black. When he came to Azkaban, I knew you were too desperate to think about anything else and when he came back ... he came back and you were a couple. I didn't know officially, but of course I wasn't blind all those years and when he died it just felt wrong," Severus concluded.
"Thank you," he said, looking around the empty corridor and kissing Draco softly.
"Why me? You were in class," Harry said indignantly.
"Mhm ... yes, but the whole situation is still not that easy."
"What shall we do?" wanted Lucius to know.
"I have to and ... and Draco ... he," Harry stammered, fighting back tears.
"What are we going to do now?"
"Have you had that burning again?", Madame Pomfrey wanted to know and the Slytherin nodded silently.
"Okay," he said and walked next to Draco in the direction of Hagrid's hut. He is teaching Care of Magical Creatures in years six and seven this year. Ron and Hermione had decided against this N.E.W.T. course. Ron felt that the course would be of no use to him and Hermione already had her hands full. Harry wasn't too keen on caring for magical creatures either, but did it for Hagrid's sake. So he trudged along beside Draco and noticed that the other was watching him.
"Don't need to," Harry said softly.
"You can say Dray," Draco interjected and Harry heard the latter smile.
"Morning..." said Draco, smiling.
"Are you all right?" Blaise wanted to know and pulled Harry back to his feet. He could only nod weakly.
"Potter! Wake up! Now!" he said emphatically. With difficulty, Harry opened his eyes and did not understand what he was seeing. He saw himself, but it was certainly not a mirror. He startled and almost fell out of bed.
"A few liquorice snappers. Gellert always liked those, too. Well then, see you!" he then said and disappeared before the boys could say anything else in reply.
"Where do you sleep?" asked Ron casually, and Harry immediately saw that Draco was taking notice.
"We'll be back later," he said and kissed Harry on the head before leaving the ward with Severus.
"My parents, or rather my father, he ... he spies for the Ministry. There is the Order and there is the Ministry. They all want the same thing, albeit by different means. My father does it for me and my mother, to keep us safe. He hates it, but he can't just back out," the Slytherin said and Harry saw that he was fighting tears. Without thinking about it, Harry reached for the other's hand.
"T-There must be a solution, surely?" said Lucius, pushing his sobbing wife back onto one of the chairs.
"Remy, will you promise me something?" Harry then wanted to know and sat down on the bed. The werewolf nodded wanly.
"Do you remember the last time Draco slept by us?" asked Lucius in a whisper, turning out the light.
"Kingsley, Arthur, are you coming?" he called and the two men broke free of their stiffness and followed the werewolf.
"How?"
"Alright then, shall we go to sleep?" asked Draco.
"I've given Harry a weekend in a hotel in Paris and it would be this weekend already. We'd understand if you don't want to, Mum would like to take them otherwise and..."
"It's alright, the Force was too strong," Severus said reassuringly.
"Yes, I trust you ... I really do," he said and Draco smiled with relief.
"They can't be serious. How is this supposed to work?"
"Yes, but there's a reason for that," Draco said and then looked at Harry, who swallowed hard and then nodded.
"Yes, I understand you and well I think we're even, aren't we? After all, I almost took you with me to your death," he said, and it was meant to sound funny, but there was more truth in it than Harry had wanted. Draco glared at him. He saw how much Harry was suffering and he sensed that the latter had only ever done so in silence. Slowly, he raised his hand and placed it on Harry's cheek.
"Um ... no, well, we share a bed, but it's very big," he said, distractedly. Hermione and Ron looked at each other in surprise, but said nothing more.
"Good, you can get dressed. I'll give you some ointments to help with the scars and some potions so we can get your weight under control," the medicine witch said, also looking uncomfortable in her skin. She looked helpfully at Severus, who nodded briefly and then sat down on the bed opposite the two boys while Madame Pomfrey left the room.
"How are you?", Snape wanted to know and looked at Harry, who seemed surprised.
"Sex," he said simply and the usually cool aristocrat blushed a little.
"Com on."
"Oh, the Aurors have been able to arrest some, but without Tom they are ..."
"Sure Harry, we are ... by the way, I never thought Snape lived like this, I thought it was .... er ... more gothic," Ron said, causing laughter among the others.
"Let me do it," Blaise said, raising his wand and pointing it at Harry.
"Yeah, what do you think that means?"
"She tortured me, over and over again and I couldn't fight back - again. I couldn't tell anyone because that would have meant she would have won. Sirius, Sirius was everything, my hope and I killed him," Harry's sobs grew louder. Draco came even closer, but Harry backed away until he felt the wall of the parapet at his back again.
"Poppy, how bad is it?" wanted Dumbledore to know.
"Of course and I know what it is. Sirius and I loved each other, very much. He was my anchor and I was his in a way."
"Harry, don't worry. Of course you won't have to go back and you will always find a home here. I'm very sorry I didn't know about this sooner. We would have found a solution. There's still a while to go, but of course you can stay here next summer until you turn seventeen and then.... well you own a house, don't you?"
"W-When he fell through the veil, he took a part of me with him, a part I thought I had lost forever until recently," the potions master nodded and a shy smile flitted across the otherwise expressionless face.
"Mmm...that's true, but Minerva threatened him that he'd switch bodies with Filch next time he experimented on the students," Remus said with a laugh. Harry sat down next to his father on the couch and pulled Sirius onto his lap.
"No Severus, I care about him, a lot ..."
"That was my business alone," he said.
A sharp pain jolted Severus out of his sleep in the late morning. He sat up with a gasp.
"Well it's just too cramped in Mr Zabini and Draco's room and as for the food, we'll come up with something plausible."
"You know you're not alone, don't you?" he wanted to know. Harry now looked into his eyes and enjoyed the warmth of the other's hand. Hesitantly, he nodded.
"Firstly, yes you could do the spell, secondly, I don't care who started it, you're not eleven anymore and you don't just attack anyone, but that's not why you two are here today," he said seriously.
"Yes."
"Pain?"
"Severus, you must help me. He'll die otherwise," Madame Pomfrey said and the teacher nodded curtly. Draco lost all sense of time. At some point, Snape's muffled voice reached his ear.
"N-No Harry, this is my life and I don't want it, you hear me!", Severus looked to the two young men and it hit him harder than he had believed to see Harry like this. The Gryffindor would sacrifice himself for Draco and he hadn't even really thought about it.
"Come on darling, we're counting on you Severus!" he said. Severus nodded and stroked Narcissa's arm briefly.
"W-Why? Why shouldn't I just let it end here? I'll always be just the golden boy, always just the boy who survived and yet it would be better for everyone if I wasn't here anymore because then maybe Voldemort would stop killing everyone I've ever loved," Harry said and his despair, his pain was almost tangible with his bare hands. Draco shook his head and moved a little closer again and even though they were so close, the burning in his chest was ever-present.
"Can't you guess?" he asked.
"Take it easy. Yes, they have bonded. They are doing well and can now separate from each other, even if they don't like to."
"What? No, Potter is not the problem. But I don't want my son to have to commit himself to someone at sixteen, and under duress. If he does, I want him to be able to decide for himself," Narcissa said seriously.
"ONLY? What is he to you, some kind of chess piece?"
"Good, let's continue with unsaid spells today. You can disarm the other in the meantime, we will practise shocking today. You will work in teams and only in the designated areas, otherwise there will be injuries. We'll keep the teams from last week, that means Malfoy and Potter will form one too and don't look like that, I'm not negotiating that!" said Snape, looking at Harry disparagingly. But the latter thought he detected a tiny smile. With a tingling stomach, he walked over to Draco, who was doing a good job of looking at him in disgust.
When Blaise entered the hospital wing, he could see neither Harry nor Draco. But he had no time to think about it any longer, because Madame Pomfrey was coming towards him.
"I'll wait outside. Lucius is standing by the stairs, he seems to want to talk to you," Remus murmured and threw on his cloak.
"Yes, I know ... It's just really not that easy. For Merlin’s sake, yesterday I slept with him and today I have to pretend to hate him," Draco now whispered barely audibly.
"I don't know, but Ron you'll be the first to know."
"Yes, I wish it was more."
"Take care of her and ... Well, you'll manage," he whispered in his ear before detaching himself from him.
"Hagrid, huh?"
"And me!", Ginny struggled forward and stood by Blaise, who winked at her.
"No ... no, if my son has to die, then ... then I want to be with him when it happens," Narcissa said.
"No, but it's a good start."
"Well, I'm happy for you," she said a little sheepishly.
"So Weasley and Zabini please and lastly Malfoy and Potter," Harry startled when he heard his name called and then with Malfoy too. With Draco, of all people. The boy he was supposed to hate but had long since stopped caring about as much as he should.
"I know it sounds crazy, but it is. The potion, Potter must have done something wrong," he said, trying to remember what the potion had looked like.
"Yes, that too," Remus said, following his husband.
"Good ... really," he said and the teacher nodded.
"Dray, please let me do this. My name has never brought me much luck and I love you, so please let me do this," Harry said. The other kissed him briefly and then nodded.
"Soon, but let them bind first, their love may give them strength. It won't be long now. Two days ago the snake was killed and now Tom has nothing to lose."
"All right ... um, may ... may we tell our friends about it. So me Blaise and Harry, Weasley and Hermione?", Harry looked at Draco in surprise. He too wished no more than to be allowed to let his friends in on it, and apparently the other felt the same way. Severus looked at his godson sceptically for a few moments, then nodded.
"All right. So does that mean even your friends don't know?", Harry shook his head.
"B-But Professor ...", Hermione stammered.
"Are you alone?", Severus wanted to know.
"If you touch each other, it's gone?"
"I-I wouldn't say ... t-that I have experience, but so ..."
"Without me ..." he sobbed.
"I don't know, but we should go to Poppy and get you checked out."
"Are you there?" he murmured and a tap against his shoulder was the answer. Quickly he climbed the stairs and turned left on the first floor. He stopped in front of a door and knocked three times. It only took a moment, then it was opened for him.
"Marry Draco," he said, completely dumbfounded. Harry swallowed hard and nodded.
"It's all right ... but it would be great if you could stop running away," Harry said, holding his stomach. Draco nodded and at the same moment Dumbledore and Madame Pomfrey entered the room, followed by Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape.
"WHAT? WHAT' DID YOU? I TRUSTED YOU!", Harry now shouted and ran off, ignoring the stabbing pain. Draco was on his feet in an instant and followed him. His chest was burning, every step hurt, but he had to keep up with Harry. The latter ran up the stairs, slumping again and again, but repeatedly managed to get to his feet. He rushed through a door onto the astronomy tower and bent over the parapet, breathing heavily. Cool wind blew through his hair but the pain was almost unbearable, but suddenly it subsided and Harry sighed. He knew that Draco was behind him.
"Harry," he said, and almost had to grin when he saw how the latter reacted to the mention of his first name.
"Severus?" the person addressed spun around.
"If this war is ever to end, he must, and Voldemort himself must do it. It's not easy for me, even though you may think it is, but one life against hundreds of others, yes I'll take that!"
"But how will it go on then? I have no new information, but I think the lord will come here. He no longer trusts me completely, but I have heard rumours," Lucius said.
"You braver? I thought courage was your motto in life," Draco said with a grin.
"Are you coming?" he then asked, looking at Lupin, who nodded irritably and followed him.
"But Mum, I may never see ... I may never see you again..." the young man sobbed.
"Yes, I thought so. Well, I'll be going, but do me one more favour."
"Mhm...could be. I don't know what's wrong with him. I thought he was happy for us to go on holiday together with Lucius, Narcissa and Draco, but now he'd suddenly rather go with me alone."
"Yes, it is little consolation, but at least you have briefly experienced what true love means. It's been far too long for me," Dumbledore said, his eyes saddened.
"I don't know, for a long time. I liked you back when we met in Angular Alley. You know, being your friend, I would have wanted that a lot, but Ron ... Ron was the first real friend I had, and you put him down, so... well, I decided that maybe you weren't worth it after all. But over the years... I think the bond was really always there, because I never stopped being attracted to you," Harry said guiltily.
"You mean the bond?" Narcissa wanted to know and the person addressed nodded.
"W-what?", Severus wanted to know.
"Are the reigns there?" he asked, the creature with the bat ears.
"Don't you remember? The Ravenclaws I ... I went after them ...", Harry looked at Draco and it came back to him. The others had insulted them and then there was only pain.
"Not much. I haven't come across anything like that yet. Horace just collected the remains of the potion and then we'll analyse it, but for the time being I suggest that Messrs Malfoy and Potter did not stay away from each other, we don't want anything to happen to our golden boy," he said smugly. Draco swallowed, he knew that his godfather more or less hated Potter, but this was really unnecessary. But Harry remained silent and stared at his fingernails.
"Yes, but we will do all this in another, better life, I firmly believe that," he said, pulling Harry back into his arms.
"I...well I can't swim..." said Harry, looking apologetically at the other.
"I will share with you my truest feelings ..."
"If I die, then Draco dies too?", Harry then wanted to know and for a brief moment Severus didn't know what to say.
"That also means we ... we have to go back to our houses, don't we?" Draco now wanted to know quietly.
"We get it Sev, so yes Draco has permission to bond and Harry will always be welcome here...once the war ends," Narcissa said sadly.
"Peeves only fears the Bloody Baron and I have offered to put in a good word if he will help me."
"Whichever way you take it, it won't be easy, for any of the four of them," he said. Remus nodded.
"Sure, Dumbledore has briefed all the teachers. Why don't you come in, Severus?" he said, letting him go first.
"Uh ... Yeah, sure," he says quickly, before the other one changes his mind.
"And when you rise, I will help you reach your greatest heights."
"No, maybe not, but at least it's better than death," she said.
"Does he know about Draco and Harry?"
"M-me too?" asked Harry in complete surprise.
"No, there is not enough room in the dormitory anyway. In Slytherin, only two students share a room at a time, so we will be able to accommodate Potter there, even if it may not be befitting his status," said Snape.
"That's the problem. Word has spread, of course; after all, Potter has collapsed several times in front of several witnesses. How serious it is and what exactly it is, only the teachers know, but it will be enough for the Lord to cause Potter pain if he gets the chance," Severus explained.
"Of course, fill them in. I'll talk to the colleagues, everyone has to make sure that there are never situations in which Harry and Draco could be separated. I just want the students to know that they will both suffer pain if separated, but that this bond will not last. The less they know, the better," Dumbledore said.
"Sir, we really didn't duel and ...," Blaise began when Snape had closed the door, but he raised his arm.
"More than that!" the Gryffindor said with a smile.
"P-promise?"
"Thank you, that means a lot," Harry said and then looked back at Draco, who now looked very sad and reached for his fiancé's hand.
"I'm not arguing Miss Granger!" he said and hurried out of the castle.
"I understand. Just tell me, how long have your relatives been abusing you?"
Draco woke up suddenly, as if he had overslept. He was breathing heavily and then he felt Harry in his arms and everything came back to him. He smiled and looked at the other in his arms. They had bonded and it was the most beautiful thing Draco had ever experienced. Slowly Harry stirred and looked up, straight into Draco's eyes.
"Yes, the diary was a Horcrux, which is why you were able to render it harmless with the basilisk fang."
Harry awoke to someone shaking him by the shoulder. Difficulty he opened his eyes and looked into Draco's stormy grey ones. For a moment he was paralysed before he realised that the other was talking to him.
"Oliver? Really? But yes, I can understand that," Harry said.
"Fine, so what about swimming tomorrow after breakfast?" asked Draco.
"Whatever you say. It's about the boys, they would like to stay with us tonight."
"Believe me, the movement is the be-all and end-all. Well, and the destination, determination, deliberation! These are the words they teach you ... so you have to learn that and then it works," Remus said.
"Good morning, I would need to speak to Messrs Potter and Malfoy in confidence if that is possible."
"How long have you known this?"
"NO!" cried Molly desperately and Arthur held her tight. The scream went through Harry's spine, he was so full of despair and loss that he could not put it into words.
When Harry and Remus came into the living room together, the Gryffindor was momentarily speechless. Of course he had seen Draco in a dress robe before, but now it was something completely different. Draco's muscles, which Harry knew and loved, were clearly visible under the other's pristine white shirt. He had combed his hair loosely to one side and used very little gel. At the precinct he wore a small posy of forget-me-nots. Now he approached Harry with a smile and pinned a small bouquet on him as well.
"Like chickens without heads? That's what Severus said."
"I know what you mean and I also promised Lily to look after him and to ... I am Draco's godfather, I held him in my arms when he was only a few hours old. Letting him die... you just feel so helpless, so weak and it kills me," he said and Remus looked up.
"Who did you have in mind?", Harry wanted to know.
"Y-you heard everything?" he wanted to know. Severus nodded and sat down at the foot of the bed.
"Okay, now then?", Draco wanted to know.
"You could be apart no matter how far or how long, but you would never be truly happy without each other," he said. Draco nodded and looked at Harry, who didn't dare look up.
"Mhm ... yes, probably."
"I'm sorry, but a couple of overzealous Hufflepuff, have hurt themselves in Herbology. So, how can I help?" she asked, smiling mildly at the boys holding hands.
"Great, that was totally inconspicuous," Harry thought as he followed Draco up to the beach house.
"That about leaving? That we could escape with them."
"It's not from Quidditch," Remus said wanly.
"You can do it darling, do it for Harry," she murmured and then she saw a barely perceptible nod from Draco and it was the best thing she could imagine. Lucius came running to support his wife. The moment the latter pulled Narcissa up, Draco closed his fist around his wand, jumped up and yelled, "STUPOR!" the spell hit Voldemort squarely in the chest. The dark lord was flung through the air and crashed into a tree. Immediately he went down and did not move. Draco stood there breathing heavily, tears streaming down his face. The Death Eaters stared at him, none of them moved, only Bellatrix Lestrange ran to Voldemort and cried out loud immediately afterwards.
"I don't know..."
"I don't know, but did you see how pale Snape was?"
"Sure go ahead and remember our deal!"
"All right, that might be the best solution. You could stay here in the hospital wing," McGonagall suggested.
"Sev ... he's... he's our only child and Harry ... please," Narcissa shivered and Severus knelt down in front of the woman.
"Hermione, I'm not your teacher, so please say Remus, as always."
"Really by the sea?", Harry wanted to know and looked at Severus, who smiled.
"What am I doing Fawkes? We can't just let two lives end like this, would it be worth it?", the bird tilted its head and let out a sad melody.
"The blood protection in my relatives' house protects me from you-know-who. It wouldn't change anything, I have to go back there every year, because it's still better than death," Harry said and stood up.
"Yes, they'll be happy to take you into the family too, if ... if it all ends eventually," Severus said. Harry swallowed hard. He couldn't find the words. The Malfoy, who didn't know him at all, would take him in just like that, as their son, no, as their son's partner.
"I think that only Mr. Potter would die if Mr. Malfoy died. Not the other way around, though. Judging from the symptoms, Potter got the worst of it," Snape said coolly.
"Sirius ... Sirius, he's always been there for me since we were eleven. He never really had it easy either. He hated his family's constraints and their views. When he and James found out what was wrong with me, they didn't show any fear or loathing, they wanted to do everything to help me, to stand by me. We discovered our feelings for each other when we were about fifteen. I think they were always there, but ... but we were both too shy. In the end, it was Sirius who just kissed me, just like that, in the library. From then on we were a couple, but we kept it a secret, only James and Lily knew. After school we stayed together, we even lived together more or less. But Sirius kept putting himself in danger and we fought a lot. Harry's birth somehow reconciled us. We wanted to be there for him, for James and Lily, but then ... I knew Sirius had never betrayed the three of them in his life, he would have died first. When he escaped from Azkaban, I suspected that he only wanted one thing, to protect Harry, but unfortunately I realised too late why he was in danger. When I saw him again, it all came crashing down on me. I thought I had lost him forever and then there he was. It took us a while, but then it was like it used to be," Remus faltered and absently turned his glass in his hand. Severus said nothing. He guessed that the other wasn't finished yet.
"Poppy, what's wrong?", Severus wanted to know, clearly seeing the concerned look on the medi-witch's face.
"Yes and we should travel home," Lucius said and immediately Draco jumped up.
"Oops, sorry about Lavender," Hermione said. Ron leaned forward and kissed Hermione fleetingly.
"Not Remy!" hissed Severus.
"No, I don't think so and you know that between the two of us, no one can know that."
"What is it?" came softly from the latter.
"Sure," he said.
"Yes, I am aware of that."
"O-Okay and what is it?" asked Draco, feeling his stomach tighten painfully and Harry's hand in his was also ice cold by now. Severus now sat down on the small coffee table so he could look at Harry, even if it took all his strength.
For the next few hours they did their homework. Despite everything that had happened, Harry was happier than he had been in a long time. With Draco by his side, he suddenly felt stronger and more confident. They talked a lot, laughed and got to know each other in a completely different way. Only shortly before Severus was to arrive did Harry become serious again.
"It doesn't have to, because you know what? I know he'll be there, waiting for you and maybe that's the best comfort for me," Remus said, smiling sadly. Harry nodded and hugged the man as the door opened and Severus stepped into the room, cloak in hand.
"Draco, I ..."
"Potter out with you," Snape said indignantly and pushed the young man out of the classroom.
"Ready?" he asked and Draco looked to his husband.
"I can't really say. You fell over and I suddenly had the feeling I couldn't breathe, then everything went black. For a moment I felt like I was floating and I ... I smelled salt water and then I was lying on the forest floor. I thought, if I'm alive, maybe you are too. So I kept quiet. Mum was going to see if we were still alive. She managed to slip me my wand, I jumped up and then ... well, you know the rest."
"You wish!" said Harry, raising his wand in turn. Nothing happened. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't - couldn't hurt Draco.
"I know this is cruel and believe me, I told Albus the same thing, but I have read and studied everything I could find about the soul bond and Horcruxes, there is no way out," Severus said.
"Your feet, try to stoop a little," Remus said.
"Hey, you alright?", Neville joined him and threw a piece of meat into the crate as well.
"Oh nonsense. You always have a choice. They are only sixteen, still half children. Even the wedding won't change that. Hasn't the boy suffered enough already?"
"Mhm...don't know. Holding hands, going for a walk, whatever couples do."
"Don't worry, the couch looks comfortable," the latter said with a smile.
"I'm really worried about him," Hermione said when Harry had disappeared. Ron nodded.
"He practically asked us to have sex, it's funny," Draco said and now sat down at the table. Harry shook his head in amusement and followed suit.
"Why should I?"
"So?"
"Nothing, just that for the first time since I've known you, you see him differently. Not as James Potter's son, but as Harry," Remus said. Severus didn't say anything, just nodded.
"Hey Malfoy, I'm sure your children will be quite pretty. Blonde and bespectacled," another now called out and the Slytherin saw red. He ran towards the students but they hurried away and Draco gave chase, realising too late what he was doing. Only the burning and a scream from Neville made him stop. He must have been a good fifty metres from Harry. The Gryffindor was lying on the floor, writhing.
"Dray, please ... this is ..."
"Remus? Are you all right?" asked Harry, who couldn't help noticing the worried look on the man's face.
Herbology went off without any major incidents. Finally, Harry was able to exchange a few words with Ron and Hermione.
"W-What do we do now?" he wanted to know.
"How is the search for Horcruxes going?" he then wanted to know.
"Okay, so I'll see you ... Well, at dinner," Harry said sheepishly after the lesson, while Draco stood by, visibly annoyed.
"Maybe, but still. A little privacy does none of us any harm," he said.
TW: Suicide as a topic
"Far too long," Severus said simply. Remus looked at him from the side and, without thinking about it, reached for his hand. The teacher looked down in irritation for a moment, but then he enjoyed the warmth and familiarity of the gesture.
"What? It is, but we should have breakfast first," Draco said, reaching for a piece of toast.
"He didn't seem to have had any problems with it," Ron interjected.
"Yes, that too, but not without risk, but I can't deny them that," Severus said. They were silent again for a while, only their footsteps on the sandy path could be heard. It was completely dark by now and they shone their wands. At some point Severus stopped and Remus turned around irritated and went back.
"Don't be so uptight," Hermione said, poking the Weasley in the ribs.
"You must know that such abuse of one's soul, which even in the case of a murderer never remains unscathed by his evil deed, is considered such a terrible black magic spell that it has been completely taboo at Hogwarts since Dumbledore became headmaster here. The soul of the person who makes a Horcrux of himself is severely shaken and unstable. A Horcrux works in exactly the opposite way to a living human being: if the human being is killed, his body dies but the soul remains intact, whereas if a Horcrux is destroyed, the piece of soul it contains is killed and the body can remain intact. A Horcrux can only be destroyed by the few means that destroy something irretrievably, so that it cannot be repaired even by the most powerful magic. These include basilisk poison or the goblin-made weapons treated with it, as well as black magic-generated demon fire," Silence. The crackling of the fire was all that echoed in the room.
"Into the forest? Is he crazy?" Draco wanted to know and Harry rolled his eyes.
"Always for that," he said. In the meantime, they were standing in front of the defence classroom.
"Nobody's talking about a ruin our lives."
"With Salazar, how do you do that?" murmured Draco.
" ... hurt him, he haunts you, and not in the nice way," he finished with a grin. The teacher rolled his eyes theatrically.
"Do your timetables actually fit together?" wanted to know Pansy Parkinson, who was sitting opposite them. Neither Harry nor Draco had thought of that before. They almost attended the same N.E.W.T. classes, but only almost.
They worked side by side in silence for a while and yet seemed to complement each other quite well. The recipe was complicated and even Hermione didn't seem sure if what she was doing was the right thing, Harry noted with a sideways glance. Blaise and Ron were arguing and their potion smelled like rotten eggs from a distance, which it absolutely shouldn't.
"So formal? Actually, I just wanted to say goodbye to you," Remus said.
"No, what's the point. I have already told Dumbledore that they both know and will not be attending classes. The other teachers will only know that they are both back in the hospital wing with complications. It ... it's not going to be easy to keep this a secret."
"I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. There were these guys and they were..."
"What did you see?"
"He was abused by those Muggles," Severus said, visibly struggling for composure.
"Are you sure?", Lucius wanted to know, slightly amused.
Gently, he slipped off his T-shirt while Harry stripped himself of his sweatpants. Draco took off his clothes too and, still kissing, they got into the shower. The warm water fell down on them and neither of them seemed to want to break the kiss. Gently Draco ran his hands down Harry's sides to his hips and then stroked his friend's back. Harry also began to explore the Slytherin's body with his hands and stroked from his chest to his stomach, he didn't dare go any further, although he would have liked to touch Draco somewhere else. But Draco seemed to know what his friend wanted and reached for his hand.
"Come on, we should go, otherwise Severus will get us in trouble," he said and led the way. Harry walked beside him and thought about how he should ask Draco something specific. He seemed to suspect that something was bothering his friend.
"What?"
"The love I have for you ...", Harry began in a quivering voice.
"Yes, everything has changed since then," Snape said, thinking of the evening when he had first seen Harry with different eyes.
"Why haven't you spoken to anyone?"
"What?" he murmured.
"Now, in the meantime, they can hardly be apart from each other without being in severe pain. Only through skin contact are they free of pain at all."
"Yes, good evening Headmaster, what is this about?" asked Severus uncertainly.
"Blaise, a blow job is not sex!"
"What about the boys?"
"Was?" the latter asked quietly and Harry nodded with a smile.
"What is it?" he wanted to know without looking up.
"I-I have to go to the bathroom and I'd like to change," he said hesitantly. Draco put his things aside and looked at the Gryffindor in irritation.
"Because it is. I'm sorry, but that's the only way this will end. The war will end and..."
"It's okay, I think if I was braver I would have done it the same way. They were really idiots."
"Have you ever tried it?", Draco didn't really want to ask that, but he sensed that Harry needed to talk in order to heal, and he also sensed that he was the only one Harry would trust with something like that at the moment. The Gryffindor was silent for a while, then he said quietly, "Yes, it wasn't long ago ..."
"No, Blaise has no preferences. Boy or girl, it doesn't matter to him. Listen, that was nothing, we just wanted to teach each other. I don't want anything from him. He's my best friend, that's all."
"No, Lupin! That's stupid and irresponsible, what if those Muggles had beaten him to death?"
He didn't have to look long for Blaise Zabini. The young man was already standing outside his office and seemed to have been waiting for the teacher.
"Potter? Poppy it's me, what happened?" asked Snape, sitting up in bed. His vision was still blurred and he rubbed his eyes.
"That I woke you up ... again," Harry said wanly and laid his fork on his side.
"And if you speak, I will listen."
"Are you alright?" the Slytherin wanted to know.
"Um...I've never seen anything more beautiful. It's great!" he said and looked down at the beach again.
"Harry? Harry, come on wake up, you're dreaming," Draco shook the other's arm. It took a while, but eventually Harry opened his eyes and looked around, breathing heavily. His body ached, as if he had a full-blown muscle ache. They were in the hospital wing, but what had happened?
"Ready?" he wanted to know.
"Please Draco, don't tell anyone. I'll be seventeen in a year and then I'll put all this behind me. Promise me!", Draco looked at the Gryffindor for a long time and he struggled with himself. It shocked him deeply that Potter had not grown up with a golden spoon in his mouth, but eventually he nodded.
"Please say Narcissa you're part of the family now!" she said and stroked Harry's dark hair. The latter just couldn't help it, he put his arms around the woman and was now sobbing too. It took a while before he could calm down and then also greet Draco's father.
"Sure, if anything should be, I'll be in my office," Madame Pomfrey said and left.
"Yeah, me too," the latter said, leaning his head against Severus' shoulder.
"B-But I will never do it again, I promise ... I'm not alone anymore, haven't been for a while. Draco made it clear to me," he added. Severus looked to his godson and then smiled slightly. A simple gesture that took Harry completely by surprise.
"Shall we go to dinner? There are really too many grinning Gryffindors here," he asked and Hermione nodded. Ron pulled her up by the hand and together they left the common room.
"I once learned that you always have a choice. Apparently that doesn't apply to Harry Potter ... he never had a choice," Severus said resignedly. A smile flitted across Remus' face.
"Yeah yeah, but it's not a habit. I am not a hotel. So boys, no more pain?" the teacher wanted to know.
"Very well, so I'm sorry, but the animals are very shy and they don't come to everyone," Hagrid now explained.
"Good, please let yourself go," she said and the boys followed. Again the wand wandered and the woman's gaze became more concerned.
"I know Severus, but they wish and .... by Salazar, my son is getting married and it may be the last time I see him," a single tear ran down Malfoy's cheek.
"The graveyard..." it was barely a whisper, but Severus understood and nodded.
"We'd love to, and we'll work through your other points too. We'll have to talk to Hagrid about the unicorn, though."
"Oh yes and then until you ..."
"No matter what Draco, you must control yourself more!" said Snape sternly. Draco just nodded and involuntarily stroked the back of Harry's hand with his thumb.
"Yes, come in," said the latter and stepped to the side.
"Something from honey dukes would be nice," Harry said a little uncertainly, but Draco nodded quickly.
"Honey, what is it?", Draco wanted to know.
"Yes, many times you don't?"
"Thank you ... er ... can I have a shower now too?" asked Harry.
"W-what at Salazar's, what happened?" he asked haltingly.
"You see absolutely no possibility of loosening the bond?" the man wanted to know at some point.
"I have to take care of the potion, the quicker we can escape this arrangement and you can do the assignments without having attended class," the teacher said, taking a bite of Harry's food.
"So, what do you want?", Harry wanted to know.
"Thank you!"
"Sure, sure ... so we're finally separated and it's really ... relieving," Harry said unconvincingly. Neville looked at him inquiringly.
"Yes, I saw it," he said calmly and sat down.
"Yes, possibly, but you should leave now. They'll be here in a few minutes and it would be better if you were gone by then!" said Severus.
"But how are you going to explain that?"
"Harry!" cried Hermione, hugging her best friend with sobs.
"Sure, but there's little privacy here," Madame Pomfrey pointed out.
"Are you okay?" someone pulled him to his feet. Draco looked at him worriedly. Severus' godson had changed a lot since summer. He was quiet, withdrawn and rarely spoke. He hadn't even been to see him. Hard to believe he was obviously worried about Harry Potter.
"I knew you were stubborn, but this stubborn," Severus said now, smiling and pulling Harry into a short hug as well.
"P-Potter?" he asked haltingly.
"I know what you mean. It's similar with Remus, I don't know, but I think he and well Sirius..."
"We really could have been friends," he said abruptly. Remus seemed surprised at first, then he laughed bitterly.
"Yes, Uncle," Draco said quickly and Harry nodded.
"Yes, there's no time for something new," Draco interjected.
"Um...I couldn't read the last instruction very well, so well I added the flubber worms whole, that might have been the mistake," Severus groaned. Dumbledore gave him a stern look.
"But what? I'd have to put you down because we're in 'enemy' houses?"
"But what are the alternatives?" the Slytherin wanted to know.
"It's funny."
"Is a love that knows no bounds ...", Draco continued.
"We've known each other for so long. I had Draco in my arms when he was barely a few hours old, so this conversation is the hardest thing I've ever had to do," he began and the Malfoys looked at each other worriedly. Severus sighed, took a deep breath and began to narrate.
"I'm sorry, did I interrupt?" asked Lucius, who could clearly see that his best friend seemed somehow taken aback.
"We still don't know exactly how the soul band works. Maybe he'll live a while longer...", Lucius said.
"I thought we had lost you ... lost you both. When you were lying there..."
Hermione and Ron stood outside the Great Hall waiting. Since Harry had gone to detention the day before yesterday, they had seen neither him nor Draco. McGonagall had told them that the two were back in the hospital wing, but she hadn't said why. They were not allowed to visit Harry either. Now they stood here waiting for Blaise Zabini, hoping that he knew more.
"Before dinner at my place," Severus said, standing up and reaching for his bag.
"I don't know. I always kind of liked you, even when we were at school, but it's only since Sirius died that I see you with these eyes. Before that, I had forbidden myself ... somehow and what about you?", Severus sighed and Gin moved on again. Remus stopped for a moment in surprise, then hurried after him until he was beside him.
"Don't pretend, you already know," Remus said.
"In you go," he said curtly and stepped to the side.
"So, you promised me something! What were you going to tell me then, or rather Snape?" he asked. Draco turned his gaze to him and smiled.
"I'm sorry, I'm crying here, and you're feeling the same way," he said, but his partner shook his head.
"Yeah, sure," Harry said, trying a weak smile. He looked over at Hermione and Ron, who waved encouragingly at him. Harry nodded and tried not to look quite so downcast.
"I still have to 'catch' them too, but I don't know how yet," said the teacher.
"I'll get you out," Lucius said, leading Severus to the door.
"Hey, I see what you're thinking, and don't. Bellatrix means nothing to me. She'd kill me without batting an eyelid, and I'd kill her if she even got too close to you," the Slytherin said, kissing Harry one more time. Harry nodded and then smiled, shaking his head.
"The Diary ..."
"No, go ahead. I like it ... very much, but..."
"Quite well, but I am to report regularly to Madame Pomfrey or to the headmaster," said Harry, panting briefly.
"Did you get detention on purpose?", Ron wanted to know in a whisper.
"But you love him, don't you?" the young woman then asked. Harry looked quickly at Draco and then nodded with a smile.
"What now?" she wanted to know.
"Put him there at once," said the medi-witch and Hagrid did as he was told. Neville pushed Draco next to the bed.
"I don't know, like ... something like fifty metres," he stammered.
"I'd say we can cross off one more point," Harry said quietly.
"Go on then," he said.
"Well, who would have thought that. Don't get me wrong, you've had a crush on him for a while, I know that, but I didn't think it would happen so quickly," Blaise said.
"Wait a minute Harry can't swim!" said Severus sternly, looking at his son.
"Yeah, I guess if it hadn't affected me too," Blaise's gaze moved to Harry, who was still engrossed in his book, and then back to Draco.
"BUT I COULD! IF I HAD BEEN BETTER, IF I HAD MASTERED OCCLUMENCY, THEN HE COULD STILL BE ALIVE!", Harry shouted out all his pain of the last months. Then, without thinking about it, he turned and climbed the narrow wall that separated him and the deep.
"Morning," he said sleepily and took the cup from the teacher.
"I'm sure that‘s them, don't let on, I beg you," Severus murmured quickly and moved away from Remus. Remus looked up and wiped his eyes. The Potions Master straightened his shoulders and opened the door.
"You bring them both to us!" the Malfoy said energetically. Severus rubbed the bridge of his nose.
"Oh ... Well, it was an empathic potion. With this one can feel another's emotions for a short time. But Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter added hellebore and what this potion does now, I can't say exactly," the teacher explained.
"Nothing is happening and now come on, you're not going to be scared are you?" he said annoyed and waited for Draco to start moving. They didn't walk far into the forest, staying rather on the edge. The other students obviously knew this already, Draco could tell, and so he soon quietened down too. They stopped at a particularly old and ossified tree some distance away. Hagrid stepped up to the tree and said something quiet and hard to understand. It took only a few moments, then Draco recognised several creatures that looked like small walking branches. Hagrid was explaining something, but Draco was barely listening. The creatures fascinated him.
"Yes ... All right. Then come to school just before eight. Maybe you'll put an illusion on yourselves. There should be hardly any students in the corridors at that time, but better safe than sorry. The ceremony will take place in the Room of Requirement, I assume you know where that is," Severus said with a smile.
"I bribed Peeves. He's distracting Filch, we should have a clear path," Blaise said and led the way.
"It was the Muggles, wasn't it?" asked Remus, sinking into a chair, not without offering Severus a seat as well.
"Are you all right?" Draco wanted to know anxiously. Harry seemed to think, then nodded hesitantly.
"Yes, I'd love to," he said and grinned.
"Leave me, I can stand on my own," he growled and straightened up again. His gaze fell on the two young men lying on the ground.
"Good morning," he said and kissed his friend gently.
"It's not stupid, it just means you care about others and you always have. Something that sets you apart from your relatives. I'm glad they saved you, that you're here now and ... and that you trust me. You do, don't you?" he wanted to know and reached for Harry's hands. Harry smiled wanly, nodded and bent down to kiss his friend's lips gently.
"Remus, I love you and you belong to me and they are my best friends, so yes - we," the werewolf smiled and leaned over his friend. Gently he kissed him, first his lips and then down his neck. Severus clawed at Remus' hair and moaned.
"Of course we will grant you this wish," he said and pulled his son and also Harry into his arms. Only a moment later, there was a knock at the door.
"Move ...", Harry moaned at some point and moved his hips. Flashes coursed through his body and he knew he wouldn't need much longer. Slowly Draco began to move back and forth and he too sensed his approaching orgasm. With each thrust he grazed Harry's pleasure spot and he cried out, clinging to the other. Every fibre of his body was taut and the tugging in his groin grew stronger. Again Draco grabbed between them and rubbed Harry's erection, he pressed himself even tighter against the Slytherin.
Sixteen years had passed and they loved each other just as much as they did then and knew that they owed it all to one simple thing, and so above the fireplace in their house in London hung a picture frame and in it a dried bouquet of hellebore.
"Well I guess I can't deny them that wish," he said.
"I don't think he would have done it," Draco said.
"No, I ... oh I can't get it right. It's always crooked," Harry moaned.
"You could, the question is, do you want to?" said Sirius gently. Harry turned his gaze back to his godfather.
"When Lily threw herself before Harry and gave her life for his, she created the ultimate protection ..."
"You should eat something," Blaise whispered softly to him. But the Gryffindor shook his head.
"HARRY POTTER IS DEAD," he shouted and cheers broke out among the Death Eaters. Only Lucius and Narcissa stood there, hand in hand, staring at the boys' lifeless bodies.
"Mum, Dad," he said, touched, and hugged her before Harry did the same.
"Yeah, I get it and you know ..."
"Well, sex with Malfoy, then," Ron now whispered.
"I would never lie about that," Draco said somewhat breathlessly.
"You would have done that?"
"Are you all right?" wanted to know Hermione, who had been waiting outside the door with Ron.
"It's all right," Draco said wanly.
"We just thought that if they took after us, they'd be putting their lives in danger plenty more times," Draco said, laughing.
"I'm not a father, but you look just like all the fathers I know. No one ever said being a father was easy."
"He looks really pale, not much better than the last few days."
"Do you want to say ... well, vows?" Lucius asked hesitantly. The Malfoys had a tradition of having their own vows, but he realised that the two of them would have a hard time finding the right words. Draco looked at Harry, who nodded barely perceptibly.
"Yes I know..." said Severus, lowering his voice.
"Sure and well who knows, maybe there's no other way," Draco said, looking around and reaching for Harry's hand. They both looked at each other almost simultaneously, completely dumbfounded.
"Did you know?", Draco wanted to know.
"Oh, and Severus, I would ask you to attend class. I would hate to explain both your absences," Dumbledore said blithely. Now Severus turned pale in Harry's form.
"And why?" wanted to know Andrea Aberdeen, a girl from Hufflepuff.
"I ... I shocked him and that was enough," Draco said, almost embarrassed.
"Thank you and I'm really sorry for the way I treated you .... you both," Draco said and now also looked at Ron, who nodded slightly.
"Good morning Remus, you're still here?", Harry wanted to know, he hadn't missed the slight red glow on the werewolf's cheeks.
"Harry?" Hermione's voice was strangely muffled by the stabbing headache that surrounded the sixteen-year-old. Harry Potter had hardly slept, eaten or drunk in the last few weeks. It wasn't just the treatment of his relatives, even if the beatings and humiliation had increased again. The death of Sirius, made everything seem somehow pointless and hopeless. Now he had been back at Hogwarts for a fortnight and rarely took part in the conversations of the other Gryffindors.
"Are you crazy? No way ... Uncle Sev you're not going to let him do that!", Draco's voice trembled with desperation.
"Yes, I told them everything. They wanted to be there too, but I didn't think it was a good idea. They're coming to Hogsmeade tomorrow and they want to see you both," Severus explained.
"Hey, it'll be all right," Blaise tried to cheer him up. Harry had hardly exchanged a word with the other in all those years. All he knew was that he was Malfoy's best friend and they shared a room. Now it seemed to be the Slytherin, of all people, who was trying to comfort him.
"As soon as possible. Maybe tomorrow evening. It's the weekend and ... and they'll at least want their friends there."
"Hey, it's all good ... I love you Harry and I would marry you right now, right here," he said, gently brushing away the other's tears.
"So these are the last days you can spend a few hours before the stress starts again," he said and Harry looked at him in amazement. Severus was pretty good at reading between the lines.
"When?", Severus wanted to know.
"So?" he asked as they stood on the grand staircase.
"I suspected it. I too had done research, but it was only just now that I really realised it had to be true."
"So Malfoy was to blame?" wanted to know Ron. The Slytherin turned and glared angrily at the Weasley.
"Cissa, you can't do that today, it would completely confuse him. All right, come to Hogsmeade tomorrow evening and get a room at the 'Three Broomsticks'. I'll bring him to you ..."
"My dears, you will be working in teams of two today, which I will assign," Horace Slughorn voice switched through the Potions classroom. Everyone present groaned. The advanced course demanded everything of everyone, and Harry was at the top of the class thanks to the Potions book of the Half-Blood Prince that had fallen into his hands by chance, but he couldn't really concentrate here either. All too often, his thoughts drifted to Sirius and the fight in the Ministry.
"See you later," Hermione said with a smile and disappeared with Ron towards the castle.
"Yes, go on, but you eat something in a minute too," Harry said admonishingly. Sirius nodded with a grin and shoved the biscuit into his mouth.
"How do you know what this one tastes like?"
"No dad, please stay ... you..."
"Mh...I like them too, that's not it," Harry said. He felt strangely backed into a corner. Yes he liked the Malfoys, last summer he had spent a lot of time at Malfoy Manor. He had made up with Draco, especially after he had practically saved his life. He enjoyed his time with the Slytherin. They had a surprising amount in common and yet a holiday together with him made his stomach ache.
"Remus, there's nothing we can do," Severus now said unusually gently.
"No, it isn't. You fell in love with him and nothing more. It's perfectly normal. When did it happen?" he wanted to know, smiling. Harry turned his head to Remus and shook his head.
"Sev? You here? Everything right with Draco?" Lucius wanted to know in alarm and put his book on the page.
"Get up, take a shower and eat something. Let's just live moment to moment, okay?", Draco held out his hand to Harry and he reached for it.
"What?"
"Are you all right?" he wanted to know anxiously.
"Jerk, you're not supposed to, but what does it matter?"
"W-what happened?", Draco wanted to know confusedly, without letting go of Harry's hand.
"Had you in my arms, you were hardly bigger than a mandrake," said the half giant, wiping the tears from his cheek.
"Yeah, like a list of things you want to do before you die, right?"
"Okay, but you're Harry's best friend, so I can live with that. Which doesn't mean I like you," Draco said with a smile.
"Yes, I had hoped so," he said quietly.
"Er ... yes, thank you," Draco said, visibly embarrassed. Hagrid called them to an end and the Slytherin was glad of it.
"Don't do that!" she grumbled.
"We'll wait a moment for Messrs Blaise and Weasley and Miss Granger," Severus explained.
"Oh, and Potter, Madame Pomfrey would like to examine you again today. After class," Snape said, looking inquiringly at the young man. Draco swallowed hard and didn't dare look at Harry.
"See you soon," he said a little louder and then left the dining room, ignoring Lucius at the stairs. He waited a moment, then walked towards the teacher's table.
"So, what's it like?", Ron wanted to know. Severus didn't know what to answer, so he shrugged his shoulders.
"But Uncle ... er ... Professor, how are we going to explain this?" asked Draco, looking anxiously at Harry, who was visibly pale by now.
"So now you again," Draco said, handing his friend the quill. Harry thought about it and felt his heart beating against his ribs. There was one thing he wanted that seemed unattainable. Trembling, he set the quill down and wrote. Draco leaned forward and faltered as he read what it said.
"Drink, it's not poison," Snape said dismissively and Harry did as he was told. The potion tasted sweet and he suddenly felt light, before he could say anything else he slumped down and rolled onto his side. Breathing calmly, he fell asleep.
"Can you separate them?", Lucius wanted to know thoughtfully.
"Th-thank you," he stammered softly. Draco turned away from him.
"The bathroom is there and otherwise, you know where to find me. I'll have something to eat brought to you and I'll check on you later. Severus, a word please," she said and left the room. The teacher nodded and then looked at Harry and Draco.
"Yes, what can it be?", Harry wanted to know.
"Are Snape and Slughorn come further?" Ron wanted to know. Harry sensed that Draco was listening carefully and so he nodded.
"Well, I'd rather have a proper shower," Harry said, blushing.
"It will find its way. It will weaken him so much anyway that he won't put up much of a fight," Remus said.
"Harry, are you listening?", Hermione now wanted to know again insistently.
"Sleep well," he then said and went to his room. Sighing, Remus grabbed his things and moved onto the couch. But he knew he would hardly sleep.
"All right. He's just worried," Lupin said and sat down on the bed. Sighing, Harry followed suit.
"Not really," Draco said, reaching for Harry's hand.
"Be careful, okay?" he said, then walked past Kingsley and Arthur, who looked confusedly at Severus.
"Well, since you prefer to sleep in my class instead of paying attention, you will brew today's potion again and you will not leave until it has succeeded, understand?"
"Well then, okay I'll settle for him," Ron said patronisingly and Hermione rolled her eyes.
"By Salazar ... he c-could use Draco to kill Harry," the Potions Master nodded.
"Like, what ...?" stuttered Ron and Draco put an arm around his shoulder.
"You knew, didn't you?" wanted Draco to know.
"It's us, Sev," said the young girl.
"Harry, don't worry. It's Blaise, he won't tell!" he said gently, looking at his best friend.
"So, I would like you both to stay here tonight. I would like to observe," said the medi-witch.
"I'm very happy to share the cover," Harry said, grinning.
"We will meet again," he said and turned to leave, but Harry held him back.
"And what?"
"Do you think it could get any worse?" asked Severus worriedly, looking towards the closed door.
"Yes so far, it's just a precaution, so go on and Mr. Zabini, I'll ask for your silence," Snape said and the Slytherin nodded.
"Not tasty," he gasped.
"I understand, but you should still keep your strength up," Lucius said urgently.
"You got it mum! Come on Harry, let's go..." said Draco, reaching for his bag of swimwear. Harry stood up and accepted sandwiches and apples from Narcissa.
"Yes, they were and more," he said wanly.
"Are you OK?" the werewolf wanted to know in an occupied voice.
"Don't cry Hagrid. Without you ... I think you're a great teacher, don't give up on this and please look after Hedwig, okay?" asked Harry, hugging Hagrid, hugging the latter's thigh rather than anything else, of course. The half-giant patted him on the back as gently as he could.
"Didn't you sleep again? What happened yesterday anyway?" asked Hermione, visibly worried.
"We've been married since yesterday and if anyone here wants to turn my husband in, they'll have to get past me first," Draco now said, pulling Harry close to him.
"Oh, yeah sorry," he said, running his hand through his hair.
"Remus kind of softens him up," Harry said, still looking after the man, stunned.
"I know you blame yourself for all of this, but it's not your fault! You never had a choice and Draco probably didn't either, because the bond was always there, we're sure," she said and for a few moments the room remained silent.
"Come on, we'll write to your parents, Ginny and the others that Harry is awake again. Blaise, are you coming?"
"The two of them don't know anything about it yet and I want to talk to Narcissa and Lucius first, but when the time comes ... then, well then I would like to have you with me. Draco is my godchild and I am his family as well as his parents, but Harry has no one, only his friends and you. It might help him," he said. Remus now looked up and wiped away his tears.
"Everything is all right. You just need to get your strength back and the scar will remain, of course, but you know that," the woman said and lowered her wand.
"O-Okay I swear," Harry said quickly. Draco sat up and took a deep breath.
"Yes, perhaps that would be good. Severus is very close to you, isn't he?"
"Are they all right?", Remus immediately wanted to know in alarm.
"Because I always had to and the only one I could rely on was me!" said Harry, looking back at Draco.
"Or the bond, yes we are aware of that," Draco said, looking to Harry whose hand was clenching around his.
"Well, I must say, how do you talk to your teacher. That means detention, Potter!"
"Now what?" Remus wanted to know.
"Yes, I thought something like that. That should be fine, I'll pick them up again tomorrow morning. It's the weekend."
"Are you sure this detention wasn't planned?", Blaise sneered.
"Severus our youth was not without conflict," Remus said.
"Well, that won't be necessary. You will share your rooms. I will find an explanation," Dumbledore said in a tone that brooked no argument.
"I'm alright. So it could be worse."
"Never again," he said and soon they were asleep again.
"Oh Merlin, that means we could have had all this for a while?" asked Harry.
"On time, there you go. Follow me!" he said. Irritated, Harry and Draco looked at each other but ran after the man. Severus was still trying to collect himself and had decided he didn't want to have this conversation in the anonymous classroom. By now the corridors were also empty and only a few of the trust students were still on the move when they reached the dungeons.
"It's like he's burning up inside, what is it?" she looked perplexed at the suffering young man.
"You would have just sacrificed yourself like that?" was the first thing Draco said again after they had both watched the teacher for a while. Harry shrugged and stared at his fingernails.
Severus looked at his watch. It was not too late to speak to Dumbledore. He hurried through the empty and silent corridors of the castle until he was soon standing in front of the two stone gargoyles, said the password and entered. Albus Dumbledore stood in front of his desk and looked at the teacher in surprise.
When he landed in front of Malfoy Manor, he fervently hoped that no one but the house elf was present today either. The house elf led him into the drawing room, as he had done a few days ago.
"Okay...um so what do we uh do?", Harry wanted to know.
"Um ... what do you want to know? They're normal, I'd say. I know my father seems very distant, but that's part of his role," Draco explained.
"Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that we can live without pain again, but ... but Dray, what are we going to do now? We'll probably have to go back to our houses and then what? Surely no one can know about us, how ... how am I supposed to stand it?", Harry's voice broke. Only now did Draco also realise what the bond meant. He swallowed hard and kissed Harry gently.
"We'll begin, everyone please sit down and Harry and Draco stay here under the arch," he instructed and so Severus, Remus, Narcissa, Lucius and the friends spread out on the chairs while Harry and Draco remained standing under the flower arch by Dumbledore. The Headmaster stepped in front of them and smiled, but his eyes looked strangely sad. Draco reached for Harry's hand again and nodded at him.
"By Merlin, you're going fast," he said.
"What?", Harry wanted to know.
"All right now," Lucius said, stroking Harry's tangled hair briefly.
"W-what were you going to say then when you called for me?"
"Are you all right, Draco?" the latter wanted to know when they were level with the Malfoys.
"Yes, unfortunately!"
He couldn't get Lucius' words out of his head. He did care about Potter, this was no lie. He had made a promise a long time ago and so far he had not broken it. He didn't hate the boy, but he was so much like his father in many ways, at least that was what he had believed until now. But something had changed since that year. Potter was quiet, reserved, didn't talk back, didn't seem to participate at all in what was going on around him and all of that worried Severus in an uncomfortable way. Without thinking about it, he covered the two boys once more, then turned away and left the hospital wing.
"Why not?"
"P-Potter is dead," she said in a raspy voice and now turned to Draco, who was lying behind Harry, still holding his hand. She bent towards her son and here too she felt the pulse, stronger than Harry's and she also saw a fluttering of the eyelids. Draco was alive! She knew that it had to be quick now.
"I think so."
"I hope it's all right if I sleep on the couch, I can otherwise go to the village ..."
"I'm sorry," Harry whispered as he sat next to Draco at the table.
Harry still had the feeling of being under water. He tried to surface, but something kept pulling him into the depths. Desperately he fought against it, having only one thought - Draco. Above him he saw the sun breaking golden in the water and yet he couldn't manage to break the surface. Was all lost in the end? Then he heard a voice, Draco's voice, calling him. Over and over again, and it was like a rope he was holding on to in order to surface. He opened his eyes with difficulty. His vision was blurred and it was dark in the room where he lay. Only a small lamp provided some light. He lay in a bed and felt a hand holding his and a head resting on his chest. It was Draco's head, he recognised that even without his glasses. Carefully he pulled his hand out of his husband's and placed it on his head. Immediately Draco startled and stared at Harry, stunned.
