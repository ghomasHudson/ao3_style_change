"Don't talk to me for a moment," said Draco when Salem sat down next to him, "I need to concen —" He caught sight of Salem's face.
" Oh, yeah?" said Weasley, trying to sneer, but looking worried.  Salem leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot towards Weasley like a javelin. Weasley only just got out of the way in time; Salem made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady.  A few people clapped below.
" I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What's your surname, anyway? "
"What have you been telling him?" growled Bane. "Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?"
"I've got the Snitch!" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.
"Snape wants the stone for Grindelwald. . . and Grindelwald's waiting in the forest. . . and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to betray my Father. . . "
Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Grindelwald could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.
He leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. He had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Salem and Blaise, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
It was very difficult (for most). They all swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Finnigan got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.
Salem jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Salem off — the pain in Salem's head was building — he couldn't see — he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Grindelwald's yells of, "KILL HIM! KILL HIM!" and other voices, maybe in Salem's own head, crying, "Salem!Salem!"
"Be warned, Riddle — any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you."
" Yes," said Violet, she was looking at Crabbe, who was standing beside Salem, and Goyle who was standing beside Draco.
"You see, your Father was right, that mirror could drive you mad," said Blasie, when Salem told him about these dreams.
They laugh. Just then, the mail arrived. Salem had gotten use to the sound by now, but it had given him quite a headache on the first morning, when a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall, making he noise even louder.
The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Salem lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Salem could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.
Salem had never believed he would meet someone he would utterly hate,  but that was before he met Violet Potter. Still, first-year Slytherins only had Potions with Gryffindors, so they wouldn't have to put up with Potter much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Slytherin common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.
Draco jumped to his feet. He hadn't looked so excited ever since his Father had told him where he was going for the break.
As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Rubeus Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.
And into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Salem and Draco's jaws dropped.
Salem read the paper several times. Then he walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to himself and pointing at them. At last, he clapped his hands.
They marched off across the dark grounds.  Salem wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.
"Oh, right!" said Draco, and he whipped out his wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of bluebell flames. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.
Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Salem.
" Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts," she said. " Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned. "
" 20 points to Slytherin for preparing before coming to class. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?"
The table from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Salem could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Riddle Manor had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered (although he already had, with his Father's private teachings when he was young) the basics.
The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. Roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their broom without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.
The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Salem  tried an Alohomora charm.
The Great Hall was bursting with activity as all the students of Hogwarts filed in, sitting at their respective table. One student, in particular, sat at the Slytherin table, eating his bacon peacefully. Although that peace will not last long. This student's name was Salem Riddle, son of Lord Voldemort and Lady Elvira.
"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help," snarled Blaise, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. "Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!" said Draco.
Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Draco only just noticed in time that Salem and Blaise were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.
But leaving Pansy lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.
"What are you doing?" said a voice from the corner of the room. Pansy appeared from behind an armchair.
No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Slytherin common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.
The following morning, notes were delivered to Draco, Blasie, and Salem at the breakfast table. They were all the same:
Salem saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Gryffindor Seeker Delta Pugs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -- all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.
"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch," Flint had said. "We don't want you attacked before you have to be. "
"Very nice," said Flint, his eyes glinting. "I see what Snape meant. . . you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week. "
"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?"
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Draco had already jumped. He landed on Salem's other side.
"Not Gryffindor or Hufflepuff, eh?" said the small voice. "Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Gryffindor will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure -- better be SLYTHERIN!"
Salem sat down, a house-elf appeared and laid his plate of food in front of him. A couple of minutes later he finishes.
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.
It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.
Quirrell and Filch were inside, alone.  Quirrell was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Quirrell bandages.
"But who'd be that desperate?" he wondered aloud. "If you're going to be cursed forever, death's better, isn't it?"
"You'll understand later, Pansy," said Draco as they stepped over him, Salem preforming the spell perfectly.
He stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.
Aelinor was shocked and started crying, Tom came over to her and wrapped all three in a hug, soothing her.
Salem would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Salem had ever seen. It was chalk white with mismatched glaring eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.
"Light ?" said Blasie, but Draco told him to be quiet until he'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to himself.
Draco had fought his way across to the stand where Quirrell stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; he didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Flitwick headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Quirrell, he crouched down, pulled out his wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from his wand onto the hem of Quirrell's robes.
The healer sighed, " Your baby has gone through a stillbirth, Saint. Mungos sends our condolences. "
"Look there," said Hagrid, "see that stuff shinin' on the ground? Silvery stuff? That's unicorn blood. There's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery. "
"Professor Snape's refereeing?" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. "When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match? "
He turned back to Violet. " You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. "
Salem sat bored in his room, still pouting that he couldn't go to the raid with his father and mother. Draco Malfoy was also there, but there was nothing for the two adolescent boys to do.
" But we don't feel like leaving, do we boys? We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some. "
There was a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you ask politely, or tickled them in the exactly right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Salem wasn't surprised that the coats of armor could walk.
The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Salem, his eyes lingering on Salem's forehead.
" Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. " I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?
"Of course," said Quirrell coolly. "Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again. Funny, really... he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular... and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight."
." He casually passes him the letter. Tom inspects the letter seeing the Hogwarts crest and sneering.
"That one!" he called to the others. "That big one — there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side."
"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your nose out if you know whats good for you." said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Draco noticed, too.
It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them — for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire — then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.
"I'll be back at dawn," said Filch, "for what's left of them," he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.
"I wish I knew what this means!" he burst out angrily. "My head keeps hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this."
" Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff, they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto the rocks and pebbles.
An owl hooted loudly, and Salem nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Severus say, " — your little bit of hocus-pocus. I'm waiting. "
The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Salem's broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.
"Firenze!" Bane thundered. "What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?"
Salem ignored him. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted his broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, his robes whipped out behind him. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and he heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Draco.
"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir," he said greasily. "My mistake, my mistake — I didn't see you — of course I didn't, you're invisible — forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir."
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. The group made for the counter.
"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well."
"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts," said Hagrid fiercely. "Yeh've done wrong an' now yeh've got ter pay fer it. "
"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death."
Not for nothing, though, was Salem the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.
"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.
"I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid," said Filch coldly, they're here to be punished, after all. "
He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Draco hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — Salem screamed but stayed on his square — the white queen dragged Draco to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.
"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one," Salem whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. "Come on, I can't breathe."
Snape had soon let the first years go to their dorms after a " few words, " that became a speech to them.
"Had to let that happen," said Draco, looking shaken. "Leaves you free to take that bishop, Blaise, go on."
The Lord goes into the room where his elven wife, Aelinor, sat on the bed holding a baby boy. She smiles weakly at him.
Salem growled, " Enough! Malfoy, you and I need a serious talk. " With a flick of his left wrist, Scabbers hit the window. Salem stormed out, followed by an even paler Draco, Crabbe and Goyle.
" That's Hagrid, "  Said the girl, pleased to know something that the boy didn't. " He works at Hogwarts. "
" Ooh, sticking up for Bulstrode? " Said Seamus Finnigan. " Never thought you'd like fat little babies, Zabini."
"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were makin'. Right, we're changin' groups —Blaise, you stay with me an' Draco, Salem, you go with Fang an' Ron,"
" Lily, take Harry and Violet and go! It's him! I'll hold him off!" (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.)
" Yess, yes, yes. I tried to kill you. Your friend Mr. Malfoy accidentally knocked Filtwick over as he rushed to set fire to my robes at that Quidditch match. He broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you."
"A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is," said Salem, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Weasley's face. "And it's really thanks to Weasley here that I've got it," he added.
"Well, what are you all waiting for?" She barked. "Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up."
When Marcus had scored, Salem had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fletcher Grace came chasing after it.
Salem and Draco followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.
Ronald ignored him, " How are you still here? You should've been expelled by now! None the least your Slytherin seeker! What a bunch of rubbish! I've never even heard of the Riddle's! Must be a mudblood. "
The door swung open at once. A tall, black haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Salem instantly knew that he had to get on her good side, as this witch was not someone to cross.
Draco dived, Blaise rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Salem streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Salem leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Draco and Blaise's cheers echoed around the high chamber.
The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.
"That's your problem, isn't it?" said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. "Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?"
Draco started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Salem's knees were trembling. What if they lost?
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Salem looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?
The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Salem would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Slytherin won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.
" I'd be careful if I were you, Potter, " He said slowly. " Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you."
"We won! You won! We won!" shouted Draco, thumping Salem on the back. "And I gave Weasley a black eye, and Pansy tried to take on Finnigan and Dean single-handed! She's still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says she'll be all right -- talk about showing Gryffindor! I've waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Howell and Fletcher stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens. "
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Wood and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Slytherin. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lack. Perched atop a mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.
A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming! Salem snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Salem slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears.
The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Salem's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others?
The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering, at this point it was mostly red.
"We've heard," said Hagrid grumpily. "Well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then. "
"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private," said Severus, his voice icy. "Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after all. "
More silence followed this little speech. Salem mouthed to his group; " They broke Sevy. They officially broke Sevy. "
Quirrell's voice trailed away. Salem was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley — maybe he had seen Quirrell there..?
Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.
A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.
The ghost didn't help, either. It was alway a nasty shock when one of them glided through a door you were trying to open. The Bloody Baron made sure Peeves stayed away from the First Years, he even pointed them in the right direction of a class when asked. But the Slytherins happened to see what Peeves were doing to the other First years in other Houses; drop wastepaper baskets on their heads, pull rugs from under their feet, pelt them with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind them, invisible, grab their nose, and screech, " GOT YOUR CONK!"
Salem knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Draco and Blaise were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Salem hardly heard a word of Flint's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.
"You are the Lord's so," he said. "You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.
"Of course not," said Salem. "Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple."
"Brilliant," said Salem. "This isn't magic — it's logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever."
There weren't many people left now. "Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" then a pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and then, at last -- "Potter, Violet"
And Quirrell, though pinning Salem to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms —Salem could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
Lord Voldemort soon finished the meeting with his death eaters, he walked to the Living room where Salem, Draco Malfoy, Lucius Malfoy, Narcissa Malfoy, and Bellatrix Lestrange were quietly talking, waiting for him.
Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed,  "SLYTHERIN!"
" Hmm," said a small voice in his ear said. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting.... So where shall I put you?"
Salem, Draco and Blaise headed downstairs, smothering their laughter at Weasley's obvious rage and confusion.
"You want to go first? Are you sure?" said Blaise. "I don't know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Draco so he can keep him asleep."
Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.
Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Salem, charging at the figure.
" I say, look at that man! " said the boy suddenly, nodding towards the front window, a giant man was standing there, grinning at the girl and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.
He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.
" Let us go, I have much to do when we get back. " Tom spoke, he held his forearm out to Salem, hinting him to grab on, he complies.
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Salem and Draco were still discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one.
The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Salem could see the lighted windows of Rebus Hagrid's hut. Then they heard a distant shout.
He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.
Salem felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.
"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn," said Firenze. "Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips. "
"That Quidditch Cup'll have our name on it this year," said Flint happily as they trudged back up to the castle. "I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons. "
" Potter!" said Snape suddenly. " What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
The man, who is identified by James Potter, picked up the crying baby, he looks behind him and seeing a livid Tom Riddle, he apparates away before Tom could do anything.
Salem saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rises up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down — next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind screamed in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — he stretched out his hand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.
"Dunno what Salem thinks he's doing," Draco mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. "If I didn't know better, I'd say he'd lost control of his broom. . . but he can't have. . . "
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).
It was as Salem dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He'd never felt anything like that.
Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dusty colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'll whisk you off to Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghost. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.
"Right then," said Hagrid, "now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow me over here a moment. "
" Is it true?" Draco said. " They're saying all down the train that Violet Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, isn't it?"
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.
" Trevor!" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up onto a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.
Draco and Salem always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Blaise said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. Daphne and Pansy were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. "No more studying," Blaise sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. "You could look more cheerful,Salem, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet."
"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground hard." Said Madam Hooch. "Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet and then come straight back down leaning forward slightly. On my whistle — three — two —"
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Salem's partner was Blaise (which was a relief, because Millicent had been trying to catch his eye). Draco, however, was to be working with Daphne. It was hard to tell whether Draco or Daphne was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Salem's broomstick had arrived.
"But this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do. I thought we'd be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he'd—"
"This needs thinking about... " he said. "I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces..."
Wormtail had told them where the Potter has been hiding, as they put him a Secret Keeper while they were under the Fidelius Charm, to keep "hidden" from Voldemort, but little did they know that their chosen Secret Keeper was a rat.
Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.
Draco half expected Salem to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but he didn't say a word. Like Draco, he felt they deserved what they'd got.
" My Father's next door buying my books and Mother's up the street looking for wands. " said the boy, he had a bored, drawling voice. " Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don't see why First years cant have their own. I think I'll bully Father into buying me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow."
Salem's smirk widened. He paid the fourteen Galleons for his and Draco's wand. The group leaves to shop.
" Before you can go to your dorms, a few things need to be said. Never burn your bridges, keep your friends close and your enemies closer, always get back up again, sometimes being near power is better than being in power, protect your dreams at all costs, only let your guard down when you have a good reason, know when to follow a rule and when to break it, mind your audience before you speak, forget what they think — unless it can be used to your advantage, and remember: you are worthy. "
Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Salem knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.
"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis," Draco muttered as Blaise slipped his wand up his sleeve.
5 year later, Salem Riddle was found, sitting on his bed reading "Quidditch Through the Ages" for the 10th time.
Aelinor turned around when she felt a presence, that wasn't Tom's, his scent smelt like chocolate this one smelt like roasted nuts , behind her.
Most Slytherins were already there. Draco and Salem pick the best broom that was on the floor. They both have heard the older students complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you fly too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
"Come back here, girl!" she shouted, but Millicent was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet. Salem saw her scared white face look down at the ground falling, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and  — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Millicent lay face down on the grass in a heap. Her broom was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.
Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Salem to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Salem's question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Salem thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.
"If you want to go back, I won't blame you," he said. " I'll keep the spell going for a while longer. "
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Salem's snake was found lurking in a corner of the bedroom; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays; Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station.
Salem took the wand and waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hands almost at once.
" You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making," He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. " As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly shimmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creeps through human veins, bewitching the mind, enduring the senses. . . I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren't as big as a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach. "
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Quirrell, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.
" Give that here, Weasley." said Salem quietly, his voice louder than a whisper. Everyone stopped talking to watch.
"Don't you call me an idiot!" said Pansy. " I don't think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!"
By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.
Salem was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours — coughed — and something gold fell into his hand.
Most finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.
"Aha, Salem. The manor has been quite lonely without you here. So I must ask if you plan to come home for Yule?"
"That's chess!" snapped Draco. "You've got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she'll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Salem!"
There was a tap at the window that Salem decided to ignore. The tapping had grown intense causing Salem to finally look at the window. It was a barn owl holding a letter within their beak. Salem heads to the window and opens it, he took the letter and inspects it.
If anyone is confused with the ending let me explain it. Salem's mom, Aelinor, was hit with an elvish spell named Hilfaquna, it's a sleeping spell that induces comas.
Today was rather busy as other Hogwarts students and their parents were shopping for Hogwarts essentials.
" Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. " The start of the year banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.
"That was far easier than I thought it would be," said Draco as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. "I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager."
The girl was obviously talking about the celling. Professor McGonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Narcissa wouldn't have let it in the house.
Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Salem, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face —
Salem and Blaise stayed quiet, watching Draco think. Finally he said, "Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess--"
They landed quickly, and Salem ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned - it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.
"Get out of the way," he said. As Salem moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer's Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?
The group had just recently left Gringotts, the males in the group were now on their way to Flourish and Blotts to buy their needed school books, while the two females went to go look at wands for the two boys. Salem and Draco nodded as a reply and went the other way to Madam Malkin's.
"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section. "
"Well, Salem, you take the place of that bishop, and Blaise, you next to him instead of that castle."
"Ready?" Salem asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.
"SO WHAT"  Salem shouted. "Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Grindelwald's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! I can't— won't let him take my father's spot as dark lord."
"The whole school's out there!" said Howell Owler, peering out of the door. "Even — blimey —  Dumblefuck's come to watch!"
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Salem could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.
"Dumbledore?" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Howell was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.
"Good luck, Salem Riddle," said Firenze. "The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times. "
The ringing in his ears and his blurred vision had stopped at once, although the throbbing in his head remained.
His mom... But his mom isn't alive... He felt something wet on his face, his hand went to touch it...
Goyle reached out toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell as Scabbers the rat was about to jump onto his hand to bite it.
"Mars is bright tonight," Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. "Unusually bright. "
She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of an ordinary Muggle's house in it. The stone wall was lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the celling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them leaf to the upper floors. They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Salem could hear he drone of hundreds of voices , his elf-like ears already picking up what some conversations were about, from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor Mcgonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together then they should usually have done, peering about nervously.
The Slytherin first years followed Marcus Flint through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and to a bare stretch of stone wall in the dungeons.
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing furniture into animals for a long time . After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Draco and Salem had made a difference to their match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone a sliver and pointy and gave each boys a rare smile.
Salem felt like he was floating in water, his eyes hard to open. When he finally did, he saw pitch black.
" She cast on the other baby. The spell rebounded and came after Aelinor, who blocked said curse with powerful Elfish magic, leaving the baby unconscious and nothing but a lightning bolt scar on her forehead.
They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.
Draco had gone first and, after going through a couple of different wands, gotten a 10" precisely, Hawthorn wood and with a  dragon heartstrings core. Now it was Salem's turn.
"Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet -- passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose -- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no. . . "
"The forest?" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual. "We can't go in there at night — there's all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I heard. "
"Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a moment — was that the Snitch?"
Salem had spotted Lucius waiting in a dark corner of the Station and wished all his Slytherin friends a great summer prior to heading over to Lucius with Draco. While the passed, Salem happened to hear other Slytherin students, even a few Ravenclaws gossiping to their parents about the Son of their Lord in Hogwarts, or even in their year.
" Goblins.." Bella scoffed quietly as they walked up the white stone steps towards him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Salem. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Salem noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time with words engraved upon them:
"You — Potter — why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor."
He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Salem leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.
"Oh, a fair few. . . Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're good enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word. They're deep, mind, centaurs. . . they know things. . . jus' don' let on much. "
A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.
Salem and Draco now stood in the boy's bathroom, Draco was cowering against the wall as Salem glared and sneered at him.
They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Salem was still sure he'd read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Salem had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.
Griphook was yet another goblin,(section deleted) the group followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.
"Stop saying the name!" said Blaise in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Grindelwald could hear them.
As the match drew nearer, however, Salem became more and more nervous, whatever he told  Blaise and Draco. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. The idea of keeping the house championship was wonderful. Hopefully Severus would help them cheat into it.
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Blaise and said, "If anything happens to me, don't follow. Go straight to our room and get my mirror to call my Father, right?"
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.
They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the downstairs barred by Finnigan, and Thomas. Weasley had grabbed the parcel from Salem and felt it.
As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them.
"Blasted thing," Quirrell was saying. "How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?"
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest.Salem's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure's prowling walk. Severus, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?
Salem was appointed to be Slytherin's new seeker, although the first year are not permitted to play Quidditch. When his little gang of friends had reached the Great Hall, groups had accumulated around them. Salem pushes by them, ignoring them. He claimed his seat at the Slytherin Table, breakfast appearing in front of him. The peace was ruined when a particular red-headed male stomped over to him.
"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Draco," said Salem as he joined him by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.
And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smoothed as glass. Most was silent, staring up at the great castle ahead. It toward over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.
Salem Riddle and his friends sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling out names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they held none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold, empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.
They walked past a mossy tree stump. Salem could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.
" I do feel so sorry," said  Draco , one Potions class, "for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home. "
And now there were only three people left to be sorted. "Thomas, Dean," a Black boy even taller than the Weasley, joined Violet at the Gryffindor table. "Turpin, Lisa," became a Ravenclaw and then it was the Weasel's turn. He was pale green by now. A second later the hat had shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!"
"That's why yer late, is it?" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. "Bin lecturin' them, eh? 'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh've done yer bit, I'll take over from here. "
Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all in pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy and Riddle, who he seemed to like. He was telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy and Riddle had stewed their horned slugs when clouds or acid green smoke and loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus Finnigan's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes . Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.
The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wand since 382  ʙ.ᴄ. A single wand lay on the faded purple cushion in the dusty window.
The boys nod. She tells them to stand on the stool, and to put a long black robe on, which they complied.
A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.
They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.
The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.
" Oy, you there! Is this your toad?" Said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.
It looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.
"They're not birds!" Salem said suddenly. "They're keys! Winged keys — look carefully. So that must mean... " he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. "... yes — look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!"
"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang," said Hagrid. "An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least. "
"  You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you. " said Salem coldly. There was nothing little about Finnigan and Thomas but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.
" Yes, Father.." Salem responded and headed upstairs, back to his room. Tears were ready to fall out of his eyes at any given moment.
And Firenze whisked around; with Salem clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.
"You drink that," said Salem. "No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past the Cerberus — go straight to our dorm room and call my Father through the mirror, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really."
do — Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know what House you'll be in yet?"
Salem was let out of the Hospital Wing days after Tom had come to visit. Draco and Blaise by his side the whole time. Not too long after the end of the year feast had rolled around, Slytherin claiming victory over the House Cup, and as well as the Quidditch Cup, with Rowan Copper as the stand-in Seeker.
" That will do, " He said, and the tape measure crumbled into a heap on the floor. Right then, Mr. Riddle.  Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave. "
They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Salem couldn't understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Salem's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.
"Very well," Severus cut in. "We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie. "
" Where on earth have you all been?" Daphne asked, looking at their robes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
"See?" said Draco, when Blaise had finished. "The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!"
" The password is Salazar. " said Marcus, the portrait swung open to reveal a passageway in the wall. They went through it — and they found themselves in the Slytherin common room. It was a large room sporting a several shades of green and adorned with portraits of serpents.
"Not fast enough," said Hagrid. "It's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before. "
" Very well," He said. ( section deleted) " I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!"
"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone," Salem went on feverishly, "then Grindelwald will be able to come and finish me off. . . Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy. "
Draco grabbed the binoculars. Quirrell was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Salem and was muttering nonstop under his breath.
Salem's elf ears had perked up but he decides to leave it alone, heading to the library before going back to the Slytherin common room.
"None of you are to move while I take this girl to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."
Something happened that made Violet jump about a foot in the air — serval people behind her screamed.
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on the Weasley's smudged nose. The girl, who Salem and Draco had met at Madam Malkin's and who Hagrid had called Violet, nervously tried to fix her hair.
Unfortunately, my laptop has completely died from a shot battery. Although this has happen I will try my best to get the last chapter out to you guys, this could delay when I planned to post it. So please, I ask you to remain patience and not to give up on this book. Until then.
"Do you realize who this is?" said Firenze. "This is the Lord's son. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better. "
Salem never dropped his Pure-Blood etiquette while they walked into the Great Hall. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets.At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candle-light. Dotted here and there among there students, the ghost shone misty sliver. But even with hundreds of faces staring at him, Salem did not drop his etiquette. Although he heard a girl whisper, with his ears it was impossible for people to have their own privacy while he was around, seeing as his mother was never around to teach him to block it out, " It's bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in
A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar.
" Good morning, Father. " Salem greeted, his father was reading the Daily Prophet, sipping his coffee.
Owls fly in from open windows, swooping down to their respective owner to deliver mail.  Salem's snow owl dropped the
They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.
It was only then that Salem realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.
Severus was sitting on his couch writing in a leather-bound journal that Salem had gotten him when he was nine. He was alarmed through magic when Salem and Draco had entered and tensed, on high alert, but as soon as he recognized their magical signature he relaxed, having them join him on the couch.
Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers.
Draco couldn't believe his eyes when he saw Weasley and Finnigan were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning, Salem and Draco thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been a horrid adventure, and they weren't quite keen on having another one. But knowing Salem's luck, and his Father's quest for him, they were likely to have another little adventure at another time. Salem had filled Draco in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
"Do we — er — have to join you to get across?" The black knight nodded. Draco turned to the other two.
Salem was soon done and let go, she pulled her bra and her shirt up. Aelinor put him inside of his crib, not before kissing him on the forehead.
"Of course not," said Draco briskly. "How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there might be something useful..."
Salem had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Blasie stood up, as  Salem streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
" No," said the girl. If Salem had to guess he would say that they were talking to either a Muggle-born or a Half-blood who grew up around muggles, knowing nothing about the Magical World until now.
Pansy's arms snapped to her sides. Her legs sprang together. Her whole body rigid, she swayed where she stood and then fell flat on her face, stiff as a board.
Salem jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe it. He'd done it — the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Slytherins came spilling onto the field, he saw Severus land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped.
" Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose. " said the drawling boy, otherwise know as Draco Malfoy.
Hermione nodded, “Yes, so much better. I’ve started keeping a diary, to order my thoughts and everything that’s happening every ohso hectic day. I’ve spent so much of my life reading, you would think the idea of writing might have come to me sooner.”
“Why? A memorial is, as the name suggests, a way to keep the memory of them alive. If that memory, as well as a place so full of trauma, called for a way to cope, surely that’s alright?”
Draco watched the bird from his balcony, leaned on the cold wrought iron railing, for as far as he could, which was until it disappeared behind some tall building or other. He’d send her owls often, maybe twice a week, and usually he would receive a negative response, one letting him know that Astoria just wasn’t up to see him. She didn’t seem to understand that she was not the point of his visits to the house.
“Well, when we were in the Great Hall, just over there, I think we were sat, and I asked you if you’d actually fainted when a dementor got close. To my regret, my friend noticed me asking and started sniggering, and I’m sorry that I didn’t tell him off. But I was being serious, I really was concerned about you.”
Harry smacked his forehead, “Of course, Andromeda is from the Black family.” Suddenly remembering that he’d heard very little mention of, let alone seen, Malfoy since Hogwarts, Harry ventured a question, even though he was fairly certain of the answer, “Have you met Teddy yet?”
“Being their true selves, happy, warm and safe. Let’s remember them when they were strong, fighting for what they believed in, shoulder to shoulder with us. That’s what they deserve.”
Ginny agrees and rouses James, leaving Albus to sleep while she gently hands him over to Harry, who takes both boys home after saying his goodbyes.
When food appeared along the tables, the remainder of the standing guests took their places, the four tables now all filled almost a quarter-way, with the Ravenclaw table being the most crowded.
“It’s refreshing to be able to talk to you without everyone listening in, picking apart our sentences for us. You’ve also dropped the need to feel offended by everything I say.”
McGonagall’s voice cracked at that, and even from this distance, Harry could see the glisten of tears, she no doubt watching images of students and colleagues in her mind’s eye. One of the teachers stepped up and clasped her hand, and after exchanging glances, McGonagall continued,
“Alright! Let’s calm the hell down.” Harry managed to bring the room back to relative peace, and had the attention once again. “Remember that we have Victoire’s birthday today, we should start getting ready to get to the burrow on time.”
James put a finger to his mouth, thinking about this suggestion for a few moments, then nodded and hugged him.
“The school I attended to re-sit my seventh year was in a mountain in Uganda. It’s called Uagadou (Wagadoo, for the ladies and gents and everyone beyond who might be wondering), and I managed to finish my education with a high proficiency in Alchemy. At Uagadou, magic is almost exclusively done without wands. Since I learned to do magic without a wand, I’ve never managed to complete a spell with one again. As if I betrayed it, somehow.”
"Oh, for sure. I just... Now don't get me wrong, you could be a real prick, but whenever you were calm, y'know, chilled out… I had this stupid crush on you. Fuelled my hatred for you and all."
Stumped, Hermione blinked, “Wow. What do you need my help for? Tell me, how did you get that far, without realising he was into you?”
Harry cautiously looked back up at Malfoy, dreading the mockery to come. He shouldn’t have drank all that beer, he was much too free with his speech while under the slightest amount of alcohol. Harry braced for impact, but was surprised when met only with Malfoy’s dumbfounded gaze, his mouth ever so slightly open, undignified but seemingly uncaring about it.
Draco looked at the owl, sat sleeping on its perch in a large cage next to the house. “Ah, well. Good point, son.”
They both chuckle, and start walking into the Great Hall in comfortable silence, Harry entranced by the house elves’ decorating again. “Professor, why-”
He didn’t realize he was shivering until the unfocused shape of an owl was moving towards him. With numb, uncharacteristically fumbly hands, Draco opened the letter after coaxing the owl to let him have it. In the middle of the parchment was a single, small, gorgeously swirled word;
Hermione and Luna disappeared upstairs, Harry handed Ron, Neville, Dean and Seamus the packages that had just been dropped off by owls; suits to each of their preference and size. The Weasley’s parties were all but small and required a certain level of dressing up. The fireplace lit up and out stepped Andromeda and Ted, who looked very smart in his blue suit with a grey tie, holding a present with sparkly wrapping and a large bow that spurted fireworks, “D’you think she’ll like it?” Ted asked, holding the present up for Harry to inspect.
“Someone offered me their sofa.” Harry wondered how vague he could keep being before someone caught on to his secrecy, and the answer was probably ‘very’, when he considered the beverages that had been downed last night by his friends. In any case, he attempted to redirect Neville, Dean and Seamus’, both of whom had just woken up and had followed the last bit of conversation, attention onto another subject. “So. Hangover cures, coming right up.”
He’d barely put the kettle on, after drying off and changing clothes, when his apartment door was knocked on. Wary, he peered through the peep-hole before opening up for his next-door-neighbour, an elderly woman by the name of Jean Cambell, a wealthy muggle who had known Narcissa well, though how such a situation had come to be was a mystery to Draco. Accompanying Jean was, as always, her soapy lavender scent, but today that was overwhelmed by the warm, comforting smell of hot lemon cake, evidently with raspberries beautifully decorating the top.
Draco nodded in understanding. People taking you in because they have to, either in fear or, in Harry’s case, because they think they owe it to him, isn’t a pleasant reason to stay with anyone. He stood in the huge doorway with Harry for a few moments longer, shifting his weight, until he had gathered enough courage to ask.
Harry doesn’t move for a few moments, but after a meaningful glance at Ginny, crosses the lawn, and finds Draco in the kitchen, standing over a cauldron.
He laughed and took the present from Ted, then pulled him into a hug, “I’m sure she’ll love it, buddy.”
“That’s very generous of you, Draco. For now though, what I’d like is for you to whip us up some tea.”
“George and Fred,” Draco offered, coutiously, still unsure of how triggering the name was to Harry. To his relief, Harry just sighed.
Cutting him off with a loud cough and an apologetic glance at the other guests stood near, Harry clenched his teeth to contain his stirring frustration, even if there was something strangely amusing, “Seamus, please, this is a kid’s party. Now shove off, would you?”
They work out that they’ll meet up on the following Tuesday, after which Draco excuses himself to thank Molly and congratulate Bill and Fleur, then leaves. Harry watches him until he walks into the fireplace, then wanders about until he finds Ginny, holding a sleeping Albus and James who are cuddled up against her in a lawn chair.
Harry leant back in his chair, looking at Malfoy, who was distracted by the extravagant garlands and decorations hung about the room. To Harry, in this light, Malfoy seemed less stark than he usually would come across. The yellow glow from the candles softened the sharp edges in his face, and brought a gentle shine to his white-blond hair, as if it was lacing every strand with golden lining. Harry abruptly stopped his train of thought, and with a quizzical look on his face, contemplated the familiar yet unnerving feeling of nostalgia; he’s been on this track of mind before. He decided to cut the silence.
Harry felt the blood running back through his fingers. The blonde had released him. He withdrew his hand, massaging his palm, watching the man get up and replace his sunglasses.
Harry felt his face flush. And saw the vampire's eyes flicker in a quick change of color. As fast as it came, he walked away. He looked slightly distressed.
And before he knew it, the brunette had already been pushed off the counter, with the notepad in hand. He looked over his shoulder, just in time to see Neville smile and give a thumbs up. He couldn't take his friends anymore trying to find someone for him. But it was better this way. Neville didn’t know what kind of danger he was dealing with. It was necessary to approach carefully.
His breathing had become heavier and heavier. The air seemed more and more insufficient with each breath, while the blonde swallowed his cock. With both hands he squeezed the pillow tightly, spreading yet another cloud of small white plumes across the bed.
Without warning, the door to the room opened and a brunette girl with short hair entered, accompanied by a tall black man. They both stopped in place, watching the scene. Draco turned his head, growling at them. Harry saw their muscles tense and their eyes glowed red for a second before the girl shook her head and smiled.
On the horizon, even though the sun was invisible, its first rays already gave signs of the day to come.
Harry was unmoved, hitting him in the chest with a broom, making him stagger down the two steps he had climbed, more surprised than injured.
"Was it veritaserum? " Asked his ex-girlfriend, beating the hand of her brother who was trying to steal fries from her plate. Things between him and Ginny had gotten a little weird after the war, but they had broken up on good terms.
"He's not dumb. He just wants to help everyone all the time and is super worried that his friends are fine and even takes care of that demonic cat just to be nice, even though I'm sure the cat is just waiting for the right moment to eat his eyelids while he sleeps and..."
I think the idea that vampires would have anesthetic saliva like some of the blood-sucking animals is cool. Sorry, not sorry.
Harry had gone back to work, of course, and Draco had not risked going out in broad daylight -Harry hadn't asked, but due to the only nightly appearances and the number of clothes he wore when he showed up at the coffee shop the week before, he was assuming that the sun really did some kind of damage, lethal or not, for vampires - having no urgent business to deal with.
Harry had no idea that, at that speed, the car would be strong enough to hurt someone. He should take her to Hermione, or to a hospital, on second thought, the hospital made more sense. But, he didn't feel able to drive now, his legs were shaking a lot.
The Slytherin didn't answer. Harry felt his arm embrace him from behind. The brunette smiled, capturing the blond man's hand to mark it with a kiss. He heard him murmur something incomprehensible.
The brunette opened the fridge, being disappointed to discover the lack of milk. He really wanted hot cocoa. He decided to go to the market. That way, he could even buy some marshmallows and make a cup just like the one he made for his customers at work. That was it.
>The latter case is the most common and it is from it that the idea of life debt comes from. Although it is not normally straightforward, as in a form of bondage, a strong relationship of loyalty and gratitude is implicitly developed
Neville snorted. “You are so dramatic. Go sit with him! Come on! It's almost empty. I will watch your back”
The blond man's eyebrows came together and his mouth opened in an offended circle. For a few seconds, they stared at each other in indignant silence, listening to the muffled phone ring, until someone on the other end answered.
Draco stared him in the eyes again. "Hm ... No. Before, well, you know ... Snape prepared it for me and also taught me how to do it when we weren't at school."
3-During the transformations, Harry started painting Draco's nails to avoid direct contact with the skin (scratches from werewolves are also very dangerous). It is one of the only "decorations" that did not make Draco angry, in fact, he thought it looked great and started painting himself in human form (preferably black).
"OK. Everyone can apologize and go back to their places that have not yet caught fire and continue to study."
“What kind of name is Ronald? Are you a clown of some fast-food chain or something?” Then he shrugged, smiling. “My mother's family has a tradition with strange old names.”
Harry Potter watched the party from above, sitting on a flat part of the roof, over the Gryffindor tower, listening to the rustle of the flag stuck at the top, which made it a few inches taller than the Ravenclaw tower. The sounds of the party were muffled in his ears, but they seemed happy and it made him smile.
Draco smiled at him, running his tongue along the line of his jaw. Harry placed a peck on the tip of his nose. Feeling a tug on the opposite side, the brunette let the chain run loose between his fingers, allowing the blonde to walk away. Harry took a deep breath as he felt the extra weight leave his body and a damp breath in front of his lower parts.
"In the beginning, Professor Lupin was also very afraid. He was afraid of being judged, of being abandoned by the friends he had made at Hogwarts, of being persecuted ... And you know what happened? Two third-year students, actually three, but one doesn't count ... My godfather and my father, studied alone and became illegal animagi. Even though they knew they could have been expelled. Just to make the life of their best friend more bearable, keeping company. Because werewolves won't attack animals, at least, not for no reason ..."
Before his eyes, the blond man in front of him turned into a bat and took off in a flight and swift through the door. The cat meowed victoriously, kicking the imaginary dust behind and got back into the house.
Without turning to look, the blonde could still hear him as he walks away towards the dungeons and the Slytherin common room.
With the quietest of steps, Harry came down the stairs. Looking around suspiciously. The front door was open, the sun's rays slowly licking the living room floor. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit…
"Fine. " He agreed, lowering his head on the table and extending his hand, where Harry deposited the bottle.
"I'm just going to take care of this here, okay? I'll find you later." Said Blaise, and dragged the unconscious man into the alley.
"I know it was weird, okay? It's your fault. You are the one who keeps treating me like I'm some kind of exhibition animal."
Luckily, Narcissa didn't have the same taste for decoration as her family and soon started to redecorate the place, which was great, as Harry had none. The shrunken elf heads and trolley-umbrella quickly went to waste. The worn carpets and wallpaper were changed, even the curtains covering Walburga's portrait were changed (and happily bewitched so that she could no longer open them on her own). Harry made a point of covering the tapestry and received no objection.
Harry shrugged. "I didn't feel like going."  With the tip of his forefinger, he tapped his cigarette, expelling the ashes by the force of habit, just to make everything disappear in a wave of his wand. "And if it were, who would I dance with, without my boyfriend?"
In addition, other problems had been purposely caused by Monster, just to irritate Sirius, making much of the house impossible to clean. However, with the new blonde presence in the house, he had become almost obsessed with making it perfect again, after all, Mrs. Malfoy could not think he was an incompetent house elf. No sir! What if she wanted to find another elf? It would be a shame for Monster and his ancestors who have served the Black family for generations!
"Yes. " Draco would blush if he could. "And I don't know with what face I'm going to go back there."
Draco shivered, feeling his face heat up. He still wasn't exactly comfortable when the brunette referred to him that way. He didn't feel that ... he deserved to be treated that way?
"Trust me or trust me not, it's your problem Malfoy. It doesn't matter. I will help, whether you want it or not!"
“That's it, Harry! Life is short, don't waste any time!” Dean agreed, raising the bottle in a toast, Seamus raised his thumb in approval. Even the Crookshanks purred.
The girl rolled her eyes.  "Okay, okay… Life debts and “what's right” and blah blah blah… I know that. And what has changed?"
It took a while for Hermione and Ron to get used to the new blonde presence in their lives. The presence itself did not like the idea of being present in Harry's group of friends. But, the brunette seemed genuinely happier with him around and Draco Malfoy seemed to have become a kinder person after the war. Hermione thought everyone deserved a second chance, and if the second chance would make her best friend happy, even better.
At the end of the day, he improvised a splint on the bat's wing with ice cream sticks and placed it in a new box with a small blanket at the bottom, placing it out of the cat's reach. Before closing it, he smiled when he received a series of licks of thanks - or maybe it was because of the ice cream - in his hand.
"Any wizard with half a brain knows that it is to CRUSH the LEAVES of the acanthus Potter, not the roots. Give me that knife before you cut your fingers or Weasley's... Merlin's beard!" Draco would say, taking the knife from the brunette's hands and producing the past requested by the potions teacher while Harry made sure to keep the blue petals on his table only inside the potion itself, and away from the blond, as he knew that aconite was lethal to werewolves (yes, he had done his research).
Draco looked down to find the boyfriend on all fours on the bed, his butt raised in his direction. He didn't need the slight pull on the chain in incentive.
Harry seemed to remember how to breathe again, taking his body off the wall and looking toward the door where a cheerful Luna Lovegood with the cat on her arms and a confused Neville Longbotton stared at him.
He looks at his desk, the part that hasn't fanned out with the wind. Pens with lids bitten in anxiety or lost forever were scattered among notebooks, books, and loose sheets. A lonely, now cold, cup of coffee looks at him disappointingly. Once again, he had slept in the middle of his studies.
Harry froze at the mention of the word "France". The possibility of the blonde moving to another country, even though he knew that he could ask for a portkey there at any time or even travel by broom if he wanted to, because it was not such a long distance, it bothered him deeply.
Luckily, Ron, Hermione, Neville, and, of course, the subject, arrived to interrupt the silent fight.
The approach came like a tsunami. First, all of Hogwarts watched, confused, as the sea parted, with the quarreling lessening and the sudden friendship. Then, the first wave took everyone by surprise. At first, it was hard to believe the gossip that the hero of the wizarding world and the ex-death eater would be together. Mainly because the Slytherin himself seemed to be afraid of the change in the attitude of the brunette towards him. Meanwhile, the blonde was looked at with suspicion, because, it was not possible! There must be something strange, probably dark arts, that explained Harry Potter's new flirtatious behavior.
"As long as you stop following me and putting dubious things in my drink without me knowing ..." Draco shrugged.
They would sit in awkward silence and watch something on Netflix, each on one end of the couch, very different from Draco's provocative attitude two days ago, as he practically placed him on his lap. Harry did not understand exactly why. He supposed it was an attempt to escape the temptation to tear his throat out, but the sudden detachment bothered him. Harry Potter didn't know why it bothered him.
Another female hand tapped his arm hard in greeting, her bag slung over her shoulder and her wet hair indicated that she had just left training.
"Mr. Harry" He corrected, but kept the pronoun of treatment, because he refused to feed the stereotype that immigrants were badly educated or rude "Can you confirm the address? I don't remember the house number ..."
"No. I was angry that you ran. Do you know how hard it is to have anxiety and not know something, and it keeps going round and round in your head? It's very boring. And it's awful to sleep. And you still have another day without talking to me! Don't you have a cell phone?"
In addition, he seemed to have an opinion contrary to his own about anything they watched. He hated all the characters Harry liked and vice versa and he tended to think that all the villains were correct and to find justifications for their attitudes - many of them very reasonable, but Harry Potter's pride did not allow him to give in, besides think that some attitudes had no justification. He had also had a bad childhood and did not go around killing people - and defending them in long and heated arguments.
“Oh!” Harry felt the vibrations of the blonde's voice run through his body when he came to his defense “So ... I was minding my own business when I saw this coffee shop and, I love with coffee, I decided to come in and order a cup. I look to the side and the clerk is staring at me. And he continued to stare. Super creepy. But then I thought, ‘oh, he is cute, what could go wrong?’ So I stared back and winked at him.” Luna chuckled and Draco smiled. “But he kept looking at me and doing nothing. Then these two disappeared for about 10 minutes and I stood to wait for someone to come and get my order”
The brunette inked the last period, sighing contentedly. Perhaps the letters were larger than in the rest of the paper and the words on the last three lines were more widely spaced than those in the rest of the text, but Professor Flitwick wouldn't mind. He rolled up the parchment, putting it inside his backpack as he threw his other hand over his shoulder, looking for his white furball. His fingers found bare skin, which moved under the touch, making the bed creak.
Happy with himself, he put away the papers in a folder, before Crookshanks climbed on top of the table and he lost a point for cat paw prints and saved it in his backpack. Harry Potter smiled. Everything was going well. Which was kind of weird. Things didn't use to work out in his life. In a week, Hermione would come back from the trip and pick up the cat, classes would start again and the time spent between study and work would make him tired enough not to deal with his paranoia (which shouldn't be very healthy, but it helped). And everything would be back to normal.
Harry Potter woke up in a series of three small scares. First, the roar of thunder shook the windows, making him jump on the bed. Then he realized that he couldn't breathe and, finally, that he was blind.
"No. Yes. I don't know. I mean, it's not like I helped him by wanting something in return. To tell you the truth I hoped he would just get out of my life. But, now I don't know."
Outside, Harry heard a trunk get closed, and quickly, other people appeared at his door, talking non-stop, preventing him from interrupting. Ron and Dean came in carrying a crate of beer, which they placed on the table, followed by Seamus who carried a cardboard box, probably with snacks inside. Neville came in last and was the only one to stop politely to greet him. Until his best friend turned, walking towards the room and placed a hand on his shoulder.
Harry adjusted his glasses. The blonde's weight pressed his body to the bed, with both hands resting on the mattress, surrounding him. Eyes with dilated pupils and irises too large for a human pattern, at the same time bright and dark, looked at him predatory. Harry passed his index finger through the metal ring on the collar pendant. If there was one thing he was not, it was afraid.
"Well, considering it worked that way, if you did something that I think is important and I owe you a debt, I suppose that for you to feel that it was paid off, it would have to be important to you. Why do you ask?"
Draco opened his mouth to complain, but no sound came out. The brunette's eyes had strayed from his. He followed the look. Harry was staring at his lower body. Then he looked up with a mischievous smile.
"Imagine, with forty years on the back the weasel father finds out that people need to work to have money!"
"See? It is much better than getting into the woods at dawn ... After  Aragog died, his children are even less likely to peaceful dialogue ... Actually, I think that acromantulas don't attack werewolves, right? Or attack?"
Draco looked at him seriously. Okay. Maybe it wasn't exactly a sensible question to ask. He knew why.
Harry didn't remember much about vampires. About vampire legends, actually. There was no way of predicting which ones were real or not now. They turned into bats. Right. They didn't like garlic. Right. They were beautiful. Right. Hm. Maybe that shouldn't be the focus now ... They didn't have a reflection, they didn't like running water and they could be killed with a wooden stake in the chest. Perhaps? Harry had no way of proving the last three.
It wasn't grass. His head was lying on Harry Potter's lap and the boy-who-lived'  hand rested carefree at his hair. With relief and horror, he saw his chest rise and fall indicating that he was still breathing.
"Actually, I met him the week before, I kind of helped him with something." For God's sake, don't ask what. "But, we only really talked when he showed up at the cafe and Neville forced me."
But, the brunette girl had already lost interest in the prey, poking his cap away with her foot. What kind of person wore a cap at three in the morning? It wasn't even a pretty cap!
With Mr. Filch's immense disapproval, then director Minerva McGonagall was that person. Like a vivid memory of the Winter Ball, however, without the hassle of ending at midnight and, reluctantly, entitled to Whiskey of Fire and cocktails that gave off multicolored smoke that Professor Slughorn, curiously demonstrating to have formidable bartender skills, prepared.
Some people might say that he was wrong for having that kind of thinking, that he was being rude for judging someone else's clothes and that Draco probably only wore clothes that made it look like his butt had been vacuum-packed because he liked it, right? Wrong! You see, that statement could be true if the man wasn't a vampire, but, as that was the case, OBVIOUSLY, this was just a distraction strategy.
His steps turned into a race. He knew he could keep up for miles like they were nothing. The wind ruffled his hair and his mind was filled with the sounds of the forest, the wild smell of green and wet earth, and ...
The brunette's hand rested on his head, caressing him with light, short movements. Draco closed his eyes. It was as if, for the first time in a long time, everything, including himself, was fine. At that moment, he felt truly happy.
Harry knew that he hid his insecurity with humor and teasing and that he was very nervous when someone didn't laugh at his jokes. He knew, especially since the incidents of his sixth year, how he would stop eating when he was under a lot of stress and how dark circles under his eyes formed when he didn't sleep properly.
His body shuddered when the blonde's tongue surrounded his entrance. Small low moans left his lips as the Slytherin intensified his movements. The Room of Requirement was too hot. Sweat was running down his chest. Everything was starting to be too much to bear.
The curtains were drawn and his room was dark. When he opened them, it was the same. He supposed it was daytime because of the faint light, but the clouds were so dark that it was not possible to know what time it was. Thunder rumbled and occasional lightning tore through the sound, the wind buzzing in his ears and blowing on the cat's fur, which fled under the bed. It still didn't rain.
Harry closed the kitchen door and sat down on one of the chairs. He raised the bat in the line of his eyes. It had pointed ears and big, expressive eyes, out of proportion to its body size, making him look like a tiny chihuahua puppy.
When the alarm went off and the first rays of sunlight appeared through the crack in the curtains, Harry knew he was safe, for now.
His body was turned on the floor violently, Draco's weight on him, his eyes crystallized in red. Harry felt something wet and hot on his face, but he found no words to say.
"I KNOW he thinks he owes me something. But then he keeps doing these things that ... Oh, I don't know."
“You said to me I should not kill your friends and I'm not killing them. What difference does it make?”
"You are not yourself." Harry couldn't protest when he was thrown over the blonde's shoulder as if he weighed nothing.  "I'll take you home."
"Sorry for kissing you yesterday. I shouldn't have done that. " Harry felt his heart sink a little "I know you feel uncomfortable with me and I don't want it to look like I want to force my presence to take advantage of you or attack you or your friends. That was never my intention. I really want to protect you, because I think you are a person worth protecting."
"No. Marks. " He repeated, tightening the collar with a firm tug on the chain, making Draco yelp and loosen his skin, hurt. Then Harry added. "Only lick."
Romilda interrupted, pointing a finger at her face. The rest of the red and gold table stopped to observe, in amazement, how close the girl came to having her forefinger pulled out. "Did he say that to you?"
A tug on his collar forced him to lower his head, looking him in the eye. This time, his gaze was serious and his tone was firm when he ordered:
Thus, Harry dragged the Slytherin into his cycle of lions (and a Ravenclaw). To his surprise, Draco would eventually develop a strange affinity for Luna Lovegood, Neville seemed to have overcome his fear of him since the first year and, amazingly, Ginny had acquired an extremely close friendship with Pansy Parkinson, who at some point had decided she was supposed to investigate who his baby was walking with (dragging a sheepish Blaise Zabini along).
Draco made no move to change his position, raising an eyebrow and, when he didn't get any more comments, realized that it was a real statement and laughed. "Yours is very hot."
Pansy Parkinson frowned but returned to sit next to Ginny, who returned the parchment on which the brunette was making her notes so that the two could return to study.
"You are very lucky, you know?" Continued the man, who had a strong Indian accent. "My son also has a dog, not like you own, the one with a crushed face you know? That looks like a lil bread loaf? And he couldn't even teach Thor ... Thor is the dog's name. He couldn't even teach Thor to pee in the right place, imagine winning a dog contest ..."
"I don't know how you know ... I don't know how you're still alive, but if you tell anyone, I'll make sure that changes very soon ..." Draco threatened, narrowing his eyes.
"I don't know ..." Harry felt his hair stand on end as the vampire's icy fingers ran over his neck. "Do you want to find out?"
Harry slammed the door in a panic. His back was glued to the cold wood as if making a barricade with his body. He felt that he was beginning to hyperventilate.
Harry nodded, without looking in the direction of the redhead when released from the suffocating embrace.
The next few weeks of Harry Potter's life would be, shall we say, strange. As expected, the first –many- days were spent cleaning the house to make it at least habitable. However, the process would be much faster than he expected. Surprisingly, Draco's help, which he didn’t expect to have any knowledge of cleaning, would be quite useful, especially magically, because apparently a lot of the dirt in the house was caused or intensified by little magical beings, especially biting fairy nests an infestation of bundimun that threatened to take over one of the upper floors.
Uncle Harry came home VERY late. Okay, he brought ice cream and cookies. Teddy's favourite cookies. But, that did not pay the wait. They should have spent the whole day together! And when they finally arrived at the park, it was almost dark and the gates were closed.
“The Weird Sisters”, as well as during the Triwizard Tournament, were present, having performed even an unprecedented song, created specifically for the occasion, in honor of the war heroes and martyrs. Ronald wore robes without puffed sleeves and accompanied Hermione in the same blue dress she had worn in the fourth year. Someone spread that they saw Pamona Sprout and Professor Flitwick exchange a peck behind the bushes. And Hagrid blew his nose audibly in a pink scarf several times, touched.
Harry snorted when the other's mouth released him. He looked up to observe the Slytherin's actions. Through his parted lips, he could see his teeth strangely sharp. The brunette threw his head back again. It was understandable that the blonde was having a hard time doing that without hurting him. Harry wondered why he hadn't at least slightly worried about it in the first place. However, that line of thought was quickly swept from his mind when the boyfriend's hand closed on his cock, masturbating him while licking his balls.
Harry quickly grabbed the Defense Against the Dark Arts one, his favorite subject, and one about advanced potion studies, settling on his boyfriend's lap in a green pouf. Harry had acquired a serious habit of stroking his hair and behind the blonde's ears all the time. Ronald thought this was a little strange, but he decided to ignore it, taking out an edition about spells, even though he would prefer one about quidditch... Obviously, Neville chose herbology. Hermione handed Seamas an edition whose cover was made of dragon leather, as things used to spontaneously ignite in his presence. For herself, she chose a transfiguration edition, leaving the rest of the stack for the rest to choose. Then they would exchange their notes.
Draco glared at him but ignored him. Without the restraint, he stood up, yanking the backpack Potter used as a pillow from under his head and picking up his clothes. While Potter grumbled against the daylight, he dressed.
He stood up quickly, adjusting his round glasses. "Erm…?" With a new surprise, he realized that he was still sitting on the blonde's lap, and instead of standing up, among the millions of thoughts that crossed his head at that moment, he chose the most stupid. "That's weird. Your mouth is very cold."
Out of the corner of her eye, Hermione saw Draco Malfoy sit down immediately. His irises looked strangely larger and their pupils more dilated than normal. In the next instant, he blinked, looking confused. No one seemed to notice, laughing at Ronald's grumbles. But, Harry covered his mouth with his hands, looking excited.
He placed a knee between his thighs spreading his legs, intensifying the kiss. Harry felt the blonde's pair of fangs lengthen and he circled them both with his amazed tongue. His fingers traced the blond strands, clinging between them. Draco took off his lips. His red eyes flashed darker if that is possible.
Harry blinked in confusion. It was a strange feeling that he couldn't describe with words. The possibility that the vampire had dragged his wasted friends into some dimly lit alley didn't even - ok, maybe just a little - cross his mind. He couldn't understand what was going on, why the vampire was doing it. He had no obligation to do that, did he? The situation of the life debt had to involve a bigger gesture, didn't it?
"So, Mione ... " Hermione was kneeling on the kitchen floor, snapping her fingers and making "pstpstpst" for the cat and being brutally ignored.  "I wanted to talk to you about something ..."
He ended up discovering some vampire tastes and tics as well. He liked to watch the brunette eat for example. He had discovered this the day before when he had finally managed to make his hot cocoa and put some cookies in the oven. Probably remnants of his life before the transformation. It must have been pretty boring to have to live on blood alone. Although, in his bat form, Draco had eaten fruit ...
"Potter." He said, lifting an open can out of the bag. "I really don't want to know, but, I'll ask anyway ... Have you been giving me dog biscuits?"
Harry's eyes widened. Any mark left by a werewolf, in human or animal form, bite or scratch, even sealed with a mixture of silver powder and dictum, leaves scars. On the blonde's forearm, at the same point as Harry Potter for two years, he could practically visualize Lord Voldemort's mark under his robes, teeth marks ripped the pale skin into a reddish scar.
"Hey, babe!" Pansy Parkinson sat in front of him during breakfast "I didn't see you leaving the common room today ... Was the date good?" She provoked, with a grin.
