To say that Narcissa felt awkward was an understatement. After all, how can she describe to this man that her son never had a real toy before? He did have storybooks and quills he colored with. That is why Narcissa wanted to give him something else for a change. Something special. Also something that wouldn’t annoy Lucius.
“I heard that toys stimulate a child’s brain though. I agree with you, Lucius, but this toy may help him get his grades up. We could try it,” Narcissa suggested.
Marty smiled gratefully at Narcissa and then apparated with a loud pop.
“Same as you, Harry,” Draco mumbles defensively.
‘It is though! Fuck, Potter. I’m just getting what I deserve. I’ve been a real asshole for years. I’ve done bad things. I used to be the bully. I deserve everything I get. Even if it means being so fucking alone all the times. I’m just paying for the things I’ve done. Accept it. Some people are beyond saving. They’ve sunk to deep already,’ Harry doesn’t fail to notice the slight waver in the blonde’s voice.
Lucius walked to the living room and accioed the dragon toy from the shelves. He then threw it in the fire with a cold glare. The flames burned the toy completely and soon only ashes were left.
Harry smiled. “Okay, Draco. If you call me Harry then.”
Draco trembled as his eyes moved towards every deatheater in the room. He was scared and about to be humiliated in this room full of powerful people.
Harry first thought it was rather weird to have Malfoy in his arms, but at this point he couldn’t care less. The Slytherin was in pain and Harry wanted to take him to the infirmary as soon as possible.
Draco blushed even further. “You don’t sound angry about it.”
When Draco woke first, the stuffed dragon would be hidden. And Harry would still pretend he doesn’t know. He doesn’t know why he never confronts Draco about it. Of course he was curious about the tiny dragon. But he couldn’t find it in himself to confront his boyfriend. Something about the dragon seemed so personal, so private. Draco would have to talk about it to Harry first.
So when Lucius asked her to the fifth year ball, who was she to say no? With a formal shake of the hand, she accepted.
Narcissa fell in love with the garden. It stretched so far. She could just imagine planting flowers here on sunny afternoons. Breakfast on sunday morning at the wooden bench. A wine between the roses.
She did not notice when Marty put a blanket over her and she did not notice when she finally fell asleep.
When Malfoy returned, Harry noticed he swayed a bit of his feet. He looked so damn exhausted. Seriously, when was the last time that the Slytherin got any sleep?
The last time she checked, he was sitting at his desk; drawing a dragon. ‘Look mommy! It is a dragon! Just like me!’ He said. Narcissa had smiled at him and left so he could go on to draw in peace.
“No idea. I didn’t really look at them. But it has happened more times. A lot of people attack him,” Harry said sadly.
“Dear Narcissa,
‘Guess it makes you an exception then,’ Harry smirks.
Draco squirmed uncomfortably. “Yes, I am.”
This goes on for a while but eventually they finish and get a beautiful, well-baked cake as result. It tastes delicious and Draco looks at Harry proudly. Harry smiles and puts Draco in a hug. Eventually they grow tired and head back to the common room, both falling in a peaceful sleep.
Before Narcissa could say something, Lucius strode over and went to stand in front of them.
I have a question for aunt Andromeda. She is an expert in muggle cooking and baking right? I wish to ask her for a chocolate recipe. It is for a school assignment.
”Why are you out of bed?” The cold voice of Lucius spoke.
Draco sighed. ‘I mean, is it really that big of a deal? I-I mean, it is just his sexuality..’
A silence followed, only interrupted by some soft sniffles and whimpers when the thunder hit again.
“Hey, how ya feeling?” Harry asked in concern.
He joined Voldemort as one of the first ones.
“Ron, don’t be that way,” Hermione exclaimed annoyed at her boyfriend. “And really Harry? That is great.”
Draco spoke up again. ‘I’m scared of the thunder.’ Draco’s cheeks flushed even redder than they had already been and curled in on himself even more.
There is mention of child abuse in this chapter. You don’t have to read the prologue to understand the one-shot. Feel free to skip if it makes you uncomfortable!!!
This was my first attempt on drarry! I hope you liked it! Please leave a comment :) excuse me for spelling mistakes btw! English isn’t my first language.
Draco playfully shoved him back. “But I wasn’t the one that spit out his icecream as a maniac!”
The rest of the deatheaters laughed along with her as more went to share their crazy stories with them. All of them were really gruesome and explicit. The more cruel, the harder they laughed.
“What do you all think you are doing?, I didn’t kill Voldemort just for you all to start using unneccesary violence again!” Harry exclaimed.
Faggot, that is what they called Malfoy. He watches Malfoy’s ex-friends stand up, shoving him and then leaving. Malfoy is all left alone now.
Narcissa smiles a little. Maybe Draco’s presence will bring back the old Lucius. She hopes it will.
”Draco! You aren’t supposed to say where you are!”
Before the horrible chocolates, he had never baked before. Thereby, he was a disaster in the kitchen. Soon, flower was everywhere, milk spilled on the ground and egg shells were laying in the wrong bowl. Groaning slightly, he cleaned the mess up with his wand. The muggle way of baking was just so hard.
The sound came from her personal bathroom. A little confused she knocked on the door. “Darling, are you here?”
Draco never let go of the stuffed dragon. It was his hope. He took it to Hogwarts and managed to hide it from his fellow students. They never noticed. He was old enough now to know that the lion in mothers stories is Harry Potter. And Draco, childish as it may sound, hoped that one day Harry Potter would save him.
He looked so peaceful in his sleep. All curled in on himself, breathing softly. Harry moved some blond hair from Malfoy’s eyes.
‘Oh fuck off, Potter.’
“Father is right.. I am weak,” Draco sniffled.
Narcissa couldn’t help but smile. Child crushes were just the cutest. She just hoped that Lucius wouldn’t find out...
Draco smiled. “Why did you want to meet up?” His curiousity got the best of him.
The dinner went better than the icecream. This time they didn’t get kicked out. They talked and talked for hours on end. After it, they both payed their parts and made their way out.
Narcissa’s chest heaved with anxiety, but she wouldn’t step aside.
Draco shyly smiled back. ‘I did, thank you. Even better than normal. What about you?’
Draco smiled. “You are always my mommy.”
The silence was deafening. Draco was trembling but too afraid to say a word.
“Am not! The recipe says that..,”
‘I- I always thought your scar is pretty cool.’
‘I wanna be more than that.’
Narcissa laid her hands on his shoulders and helped him sway along to the music. “Every color, definitely.”
The curse stopped, but Lucius his anger didn’t.
“Yes, father.”
He hit her when she told him to not get involved. She didn’t say anything after, afraid he would hurt the baby inside her.
They sit like that for a few minutes. That is until Harry’s hears something being murmered against his chest. ‘What did you say?’
Narcissa didn’t care about the family status. She was in love with this man and that was all that mattered for her.
‘Well, that is nice to know. Say, I really enjoyed spending time with you. We should do that more often!’ Harry smiles.
‘Oh Malfoy,’ Harry wraps his arms around the slightly shaking boy, letting him cry in his chest.
Malfoy sits there, with his friends. Theo Nott is waving around the Daily Prophet, Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini and Gregory Goyle all taking turns to read it. They snicker and seem to be making rude remarks. Meanwhile Malfoy just looks confused.
“Well, when you go to Hogwarts, you are going to start having balls. Like the yule ball for example. You might take a special someone there and then you might need to be able to dance!” Narcissa chuckled.
I hope this is atleast something.
Lucius stopped the curse and stalked towards Draco. He then raised his cane and brought it down on Draco multiple times. Draco curled up even tighter as he bit his lips trying to keep himself from screaming.
‘Ofcourse we are friends, you silly ass,’ Harry says chuckling.
Someone was talking to her. Actually, screaming, crying and pleading to her. A broken voice, scared and lost.
“Yes?”
”You need to eat healthier. You know you look fat.”
“Yeah! It looks good on you. You should have her style it more often,” Draco blushed.
Lucius grabbed his cane and hit Draco over and over again. Draco screamed and cried. “Mommy!!!” He cried out. Lucius knelt down and hit Draco at the head. Within a second, the child passed out.
Have a lovely day :)
All he wants right now is to dissapear.
”I would fuck her so hard after the ball.”
It is then that Harry notice the pale freckles on the boy’s face. Once he notices them, he spots them everywhere. They are on the bridge of his nose, on his cheeks and a few on his forehead and chin as well.
Lucius flamed red. “You... you insolent little freak! How dare you?” He screamed.
“You what?..,” Suddenly she realized. “I’m going in, little dragon.”
Narcissa stopped to think. There had to be a way to convince Lucius. She would get Draco a toy, no matter what. She just had to think smart.
Draco did as he was told and soon the dragon was flying above his hand and breathing fire. Draco looked in amazement and happiness. “It flies! Look at that!”
He was friends with her fellow classmate, Severus Snape. Severus was the outcast of the school, always teased, always bullied. It had been a great shock that Lucius would befriend him of all people. Narcissa thought it was sweet. Never judge a book by its cover, she knew.
Harry was shocked. Did Malfoy just call him by his first name? He wanted to answer but one look at the pale boy in the bed told him he had fallen asleep. He watched as Malfoy’s breath evened.
But staying with Draco this night would be worth the hurt. Her little boy needed someone at his side. What if he got sick again? Or if he gets a nightmare! No, he would not be alone tonight.
‘Yes?’
‘Your friends are over there,’ Malfoy sounds confused.
The silence got Draco thinking. He had such a lovely time with his mother. He wished moments like this would never end.
Draco’s face fell at the mention of Lucius but soon he was smiling again. “Can I use the floral soap? The one that smells like the garden? Please, mommy? Father says I have to use this one that doesn’t even smell special.”
“Mommy..,”
Harry woke up when his alarm ringed. Strangely, he felt more well-rested than ever. And he was hugging something very comfortable and warm. Wait.. what?
Narcissa felt her son stiffening. She grabbed his hand and glared at Lucius. “I’m taking Draco to his room. We are going to study.”
No answer.
Malfoy chuckled, still blushing. ‘I know what eye color I have. But thank you.. Harry. You look handsome too.’ Malfoy’s eyes widened a bit again.
Narcissa fell to the ground as pain hit every nerve of her body. But she wouldn’t scream. She had to stay strong for her little dragon, for Draco.
He had almost fallen asleep when the beep of the oven shook him awake. He quickly opened to oven, hoping they didn’t burn. Satisfied when they weren’t burn, he took them out. They looked fine, he thought. He had seen better but this looked pretty tasty too.
Hopefully you have a great day,
She put the pregnancy stick in the potion. If it colored white, she was pregnant.
‘Dragon, what is wrong?’
She looked at Draco and saw he was fighting a smile of his own. He carefully ate his pasta, not wanting to attract the attention of his father.
”You heard me. Start working out.”
Of course that was not expected of Lucius Malfoy.
‘But why me?’
Harry smiled. “They left me a note as well,” Harry said. He started reading the note to himself.
Lucius was such a gentleman when Narcissa met him. She was a popular girl at Hogwarts. Everyone knew the Black sisters. Andromeda, the daring one, who should have been in Gryffindor. Bellatrix, the crazy one. Always said what she thought, never questioning if maybe she was being rude. Lastly, Narcissa. Narcissa was the pretty one.
Draco nodded, relieved that his mother wasn’t angry. He thought that perhaps she was joking in her past letter and that she might not accept it. Luckily, he was wrong.
For some reason, it was the most beautiful sound to Narcissa.
‘It isn’t silly to be scared of thunderstorms! Totally not. And you are not a loser. You really aren’t. Don’t you ever think of yourself like that!’ Harry said, not liking Draco basically calling himself a loser when he was clearly not!
“You... you freak! Aren’t you even going to apologize?” Lucius screamed.
Narcissa pressed a kiss to his forehead. “I love you, little dragon. Sleep well my boy.”
He moved over to the tear-streaken boy and smiled softly. “I am gonna carry you, if that is alright with you.”
“I would love that, Harry,” Draco smiles as he walks over to the cake.
Lucius grinned. “I’m not going to let him off the hook that easily. He must pay,” Lucius said as he raised his wand. “Crucio!”
Draco didn’t say anything back as he was busy with the dragon.
There is a photograph of Narcissa and Draco on his nightstand. His desk contained a photograph of Blaise, Pansy and Draco.
Draco shook his head desperately. “No, that is not it! I swear, father. It was my own careless mistake. I’ll do better. It is not the dragon! I haven’t played with it all morning!”
“So, Malfoy, feeling better? I didn’t hear you come in last night. Must have been asleep already,” Harry said as he kept watching the blonde.
Draco smiled happily and went to sit down next to Narcissa. He then eyed the present. Surprise and excitement started to show in his eyes as he looked up at his mother.
The blonde startled awake and looked up at Harry who was sitting on the bed with a guilty smile. Harry saw the eyes of the Slytherin widen in horror as he suddenly realised that Harry caught him. With the dragon. He made a quick attempt to hide the dragon under the sheets but it didn’t work. Harry crawled over to where Draco was and grabbed the dragon. He saw Draco’s cheeks redden and his eyes still open in horror.
Lucius was sitting on her left. His long blond hair was falling gracefully over his shoulders. His cane rested carefully against his high chair.
Narcissa chuckled. “Mommy will be proud,” she answered softly.
‘No, not yet anyways,’ Harry smiles. ‘The guy I’m crushing on doesn’t seem to notice it though I’m standing right in front of him.’
Lucius didn’t control their lives for a week and things never felt more free. They could finally let go.
“Alright, dear. Get some rest and then you may leave,” she smiled softly before walking away.
‘Cool.’
‘I know, the lion saved us,’ Draco sounded dead serious.
“What about it?” Lucius replied coldly.
“No problem, Draco.”
Draco grinned. “Are you sure? You are always so easy to find! I am going to win from you!”
‘Voldemort is death now,’ Harry whispered. ‘And the deatheaters are in Azkaban.’
Malfoy, who still looked a bit flustered, moved over to Harry and sat down next to Harry. Harry felt a bit awkward first about sitting so close to Malfoy. But he relaxed soon as Malfoy grabbed the assigment and scanned it over.
Draco wants to read it too, curious as he is, but Blaise and Gregory sat in front of him so he couldn’t look over their shoulders. ‘What is so funny?’ he asked.
“Father wouldn’t approve. I get it,” Draco bit his lips.
Harry walked down the stairs and was about to sit down on his favorite couch when he noticed a blond haired boy sitting in the armchair over at the window. Malfoy. He seemed to be reading a book while dressed in his green silk Slytherin pajamas. Malfoy looked up when Harry entered the common room. Malfoy sent Harry an awkward nod and a small smile. Harry returned the nod and smile and went down to sit on the couch.
Eventually, the dragon got tired of pretending to be a butterfly. With a heavy sigh, he nestles in his mother’s lap. Narcissa strokes his hair lovingly.
Lucius walked closer. “We never had problems with this before. I know it is the toy. We are getting rid of it,” he said determined.
“You can always come to me, you know. And with some names I will be able to report the people doing this to you.”
Harry’s cheeks flushed and before he could have second thoughts he scooped the blonde into his arms and hugged him tightly. The blonde responded to the hug immediately. They melted into eachothers touch for what seemed like forever, none of them saying a word. Something about this felt so right. As if they were eachothers missing puzzle piece.
There is birthgiving in this chapter. Not all too graphic.
Andromeda gave me a recipe for brownies. They are supposed to be small chocolate cakes. I hope that works for you. I wish you succes with your ‘school assignment.’ Tell me what Harry thinks of them.
Malfoy doesn’t answer, still looking distrusting.
She entered his bedroom. The walls were a combination between black and green. His bed sheets were that of cartoon alike dragons. The only reason that Lucius approved of childish sheets is because dragons are powerful animals.
“It is a pretty color though. Only people like your father gatekeep colors!”
How are you doing? Are Teddy and aunt Andromeda doing well? Give them my well wishes.
Harry smiled when he saw his boyfriend blushing. The adorable sight of that made Harry smile and take the blonde into his arms. Draco gratefully moved closer to Harry. Harry put his arms around his shoulders. He felt him Draco relax in his grip.
“But I can’t take a crucio like a real man!” Draco said exasperated.
“I am pretty, mommy. Right? Do you think so too? I am so pretty.”
They arrived at the icecream place shortly after. They placed their order, Harry a caramel icecream and Draco a green apple icecream, and went to sit down with their icecream.
“Is mistress Narcissa doing okay? Does mistress need help from Marty?” He asked while handing her a bottle of wine.
Have a lovely day or night!
Harry smiled as he finished the letter. This person was so kind, he wish he knew who it was. He sighed and put the note away. Maybe he will find out, one day or another.
‘Guess this is finally happening, then,’ Draco said between breaths.
After Malfoy apologized, he and Harry never spoke again. They only greeted eachother as they were on civil terms now. A soft sigh from across the room broke Harry from his thoughts. He looked over to Malfoy, who was still reading, curled in on himself.
Malfoy sighs. ‘Still I don’t understand. Don’t you hate me?’ Malfoy’s eyes seem to pierce right through Harry. So intense, they are.
“Draco, I love your make up very much but I’m afraid that father is gonna be very jealous if he sees that you are way prettier than him,” she said softly. Of course, she wasn’t going to tell him that Lucius would get extremely angry if he saw Draco wearing make up.
Harry debated the question in his head. Had Malfoy actually offered to help him with his homework? That was bloody weird. But he really needed some help. And Malfoy was way nicer this year. Speaking of Malfoy, he was turning more red by the second. Embarassed at himself for asking the question and more afraid of Harry’s answer. Harry decided to help Malfoy out of his embarrassment.
Once in the kitchens, Draco took out the recipe. After the little incident with Harry he felt more determined to make these brownies perfect. He grabbed the needed ingedrients and put them on the counter.
Draco smiled at her. “What do you want to do?”
‘Yeah, sure. I could actually need some help,’ Harry smiled at Malfoy.
“I’ll get him something then. I’ll meet you again here,” she said dryly. With that she made her way to the toy store.
Greyback grinned, his bloody teeth showing. “Well then... Cheers, little boy,” he said as he held out his glass of champagne.
Draco looked up with a debating look. “I don’t know mommy. But maybe we can marry!” He says enthousiastic.
“Definitely.”
‘Having troubles with your homework?’ A quiet voice spoke.
“Hey Potter, why don’t you try them already?” A quiet voice spoke.
Draco smiled in delight. Narcissa walked towards him and started to wash his hair with the floral shampoo.
The only thing missing from his room was Draco himself.
Narcissa smiled at him. “Of course, little dragon,” she said as she helped him up again and helped him walk towards the bathroom. She helped him stay upright as he brushed his teeth.
Dinner got served and Greyback turned his eyes on Draco. Draco was still looking at his lap, his hands trembling just slightly from anxiety.
‘Why not?’
“Oh merlin.., Draco...”
“Draco, what are you doing in mommy’s bathroom?”
Draco met his mother’s eyes. “You think so?”
Suddenly Draco hungs to Harry, pressing his lips against Harry’s, kissing him roughly.
‘We are supposed to be ememies, remember?’
‘Yeah, I liked the little spice you added to it.’
Pomfrew looked at him suspicious but let him leave anyways.
‘Hm, just this stupid thing for potions. The thing we have to turn in tomorrow.’
Lucius disagreed with Narcissa.
Draco smiled happily and bounced up and down like a happy little child. Narcissa chuckled and tried to hold him still so she could undo the rest of his clothes.
“Stop there, you will only injure yourself more. Let me help taking you to madame Pomfrey,” Harry said, as he watched the blonde with sympathy.
Draco smiled the cutest smile Harry ever saw. ‘You feel safe, Harry. Sweet Merlin, I never thought I would say that. But you are very comforting.’
Narcissa closed her eyes. That last comment will go through her husbands head forever. She rapidly thought of something that she could do but to her own horror she came up with nothing.
“I want to be a Slytherin.”
Draco’s birthday passed smoothly. Lucius had retreated in his office. Draco had played with the dragon all day and Narcissa had played along with him. They played fantasy games where they were dragon hunters or dragons themselves. They both had a great time. Draco fell asleep with a smile on his face that day and Narcissa went to bed feeling like a good mom for once.
“Gay?” His mother smiled. “Darling, I’ve known forever. Just like I know about your crush on Harry.”
The ballroom was almost abandoned now. Sometimes Narcissa would go here to listen to music while looking at the ceiling with angel drawings.
“I’m sorry, mommy. I just want to make you feel better,” he said in a small voice.
I am doing good, thank you for asking honey. Teddy and Andromeda are doing well too. Teddy learned to change his hair blue, which is very amusing.
They stayed silent for a couple of minutes, in which Harry gently rubbed the Slytherin’s back. Eventually Malfoy speaks up, clearly upset.
Harry waits for Malfoy to reply, but nothing comes. Instead, he hears a sob.
Harry dried his hands and made a return to the couch when an adorable sight made him stop. Malfoy had fallen asleep. He lay curled up on the couch, resting a bit against the side of the couch. His eyes were closed and his breath was soft and even. He looked so damn peaceful, it made Harry melt a bit inside.
She sat up and looked around. No Lucius, he had left.
“What are you doing here?” Draco snaps, standing in front of a bowl, trying to hide it.
‘Shit, I shouldn’t have., I’m so sorry Harry, f-fuck! I’m so stupid, I-,’ Harry interrupted Draco’s panicked rant. He saw the tears flooding the grey eyes and Harry felt so bad.
With the deatheaters, Narcissa knew.
Theo sighed. ‘Kinda sad actually, He was my favorite player. Waste of talent, really.’
Draco bowed his head down. “I’m sorry, father.”
“Then why are you failing to answer my questions correctly?” Lucius asked with a hint of anger creeping into his voice.
“Mommy?”
Draco looked at a sleeping Lucius fearfully. “My tummy hurts...”
Harry broke from his trance and quickly moved forward. He pushed the students aside so they stopped kicking Malfoy.
Yours, Narcissa”
Malfoy nodded, opening his eyes just a little.
“I genuinly don’t, actually,” Draco said, as his mother stroked his hair.
The others looked at him strangely. They went on about how it was wrong and disgusted. ‘All gays belong in Azkaban!’ Gregory had yelled. Insult after insult spread over the table and Draco grew more quiet.
“I understand, miss. I’ll help you then! So, what are his interests?” He asked.
“We are?”
”My family will offer you so many gold that...”
“One second, mommy! I’m almost done!”
Narcissa was taken aback. “Lucius...”
Lucius stood up and ordered some frightened house elves to clean his plates. “I’m leaving tonight.”
“Idiot”
Harry sent Draco a look. They stared at eachother for a few seconds before bursting out in laughter yet again. The man who came to sent them away looked so angry, his eyes killing.
Harry felt himself relax. ‘The lion? Who is that?’
After the war, Malfoy grew very quiet. He was barely noticeable. Though he had apologized to everyone, many still hated him. Harry had even spotted some people yelling at him or even punching and kicking him. Knowing that it is wrong, he had succesfully stopped the bullies sometimes. But Malfoy still came back to the dorms with bruises, cuts and limps countless of times.
And then it hits Harry. Chocolate cake. Chocolate... Bad bakings... Sarcastic notes. Draco is his secret admirer. And Harry caught him right in the act.
The flowers, especially the roses are doing well. The Narcisses you planted are doing wonderful too.
“Don’t be dead, please don’t be dead!”
“Is that true? Guess we will have to find out soon!”
Malfoy spoke again, ‘Look, see this potion? It is beetroot based. Which means that..,’ Malfoy explained. ‘...so that is why it shouldn’t be used on people with bood-type A.’
Malfoy let out a soft sigh and pulled his arms against his chest tight. He shivered a bit. Harry knew he was cold. It was a cold november night, after all. One look at the shivering Slytherin and Harry made his decision. Before he could change his mind he darted forward to the sleeping blonde.
Narcissa and Lucius were naked. His hands touched her boobs and her thighs. She touched his chest.
‘It is- stupid. You will l-laugh at me. Forget abou..’ Another bang cut off his sentence and Draco let out a sob.
Narcissa quickly took Draco upstairs and pulled him on her lap. She then took his little tear streaken head in her hands and made him look at her. “I’m going to get you a new toy, dragon. In secret. Father won’t know about it. We just got to hide it carefully, okay? Can you do that?” She asked him softly.
The deatheaters continued their dinner as if nothing happened. Narcissa kept throwing her son concerned glances as he wasn’t waking up. She was glad when dinner finally ended an hour later and Lucius and the deatheaters left to do some business.
Narcissa quickly knelt down at Draco’s side. “Dragon? Draco can you wake up?”
Draco nodded. “Okay, father.”
‘I promise’
The war is over. People died, people lived, but in the end Voldemort was finally defeated. The summer after the war students received a letter from Hogwarts telling them that 7th year students would be welcome to return for an eight year, to make up for their lost year. Most students gracefully accepted, Harry and Draco being one of them.
Narcissa fought a glare of her own. She was very relieved though. Spending a week without her husband sounded like a week of the Maldives to her.
Black spots appeared in front of her. Draco is crying. Her nerves are on fire.
‘Harry.. I-, it.. it is not mine!’
“Crucio!”
When Draco thought his mom was asleep, he slipped out of bed. He looked through his window to the nightsky. Then he wished upon a star that one day he and mom could always be free like this.
Yours, A certain student. ‘)
It was then that Harry realised that Draco wasn’t lying in his arms anymore. Draco was sitting against the headboard of the bed with his knees pulled to his chest, arms hugging his knees and his head buried in them. Harry heard a little sob coming from his vulnerable looking boyfriend. And then another, and another. A bang was heard again and he heard the whimper again. His whole body shook and trembled. Harry couldn’t stand to watch the blonde looking so upset.
Sirius raised his hand in dismissal. “
thought Harry, letting his face rest in one hand.
-" he pointed at Harry's hand "
The git scoffed and went back into the building. Happy for a small victory at the end, Harry walked down the remaining slippery steps.
Draco halted on his steps. “That is an excellent idea, Scarhead."
“Don’t think too much, Scarhead,” said Draco, bringing Harry’s attention back to him. They were alone again, and Harry suspected that Ron had been successfully snatched away by Crabbe and Goyle. Draco was looking at him with concern. “You will hurt your head."
“Yeah-
Hermione was shaking her head. “Very mature."
Draco squeezed his eyes shut as if the answer had caused him pain. His hands came up, not in fists but extended and clutching on the front of Harry's jacket. "I didn't ask you to not do it, Harry."
“I was!” interrupted Sirius almost triumphantly. He glared at Lupin. “I told you, didn’t I, Remus? I warned all of you that he was a slimy bastard. And you didn’t listen and look at what he did! Played Harry like a fiddle.”
“What? Nothing. Why are you asking?”
." He was wearing the gloves Harry had bought him for Christmas. He had seen them while looking for a compass for Ron's broom and thought they could be a good gift for the blonde.
“That she has me under surveillance,” muttered Harry, still angry about Hedwig. “But Hermione says no one was jinxed, so whoever told her about our meeting wasn’t a student."
“I don’t think so?"
As the week had passed, it seemed like everyone in the castle had read the article against Umbridge’s wishes. A great number of people kept pestering Harry, Ron or Hermione with questions about the Groundyard, which became annoying really fast. The D.A members had congratulated him, some like Cho giving tearful demonstrations of support or other like Dean doing so with excited pats in the back.
And Harry definitely hadn’t thought that he would be listening happily, mind half on the conversation and half on the feeling of Draco’s knees bumping into his under the table. But even if he hadn’t expected it then, it felt
of, Buckbeak is rather nice. Here, let me call him-"
"You don't think I did?" asked Harry before he could stop himself.
“Talking about whims,” started Hermione casually. “How did the meeting go?"
Harry felt as if punched by a giant. "You didn't?" he let out, noticing he was desperately hoping the answer was no.
“Actually, you kind of screamed at her, it was sort of frightening,” pointed out Ginny.
type,” said Ron, waving his fork as carelessly as his words. Then, when Hermione scowled at him, he tried to explain himself, “I mean, you aren’t that kind of girl, you know? Like the one that has dates- I mean, you are not like
“That doesn’t change anything-” Draco paused, and gulped, a gesture that didn’t go with his impassive face and steady tone. “Look, it’s just better this way.”
“Thank you, love,” said Draco, placing a hand on his shoulder. “That
There was a loud sound as Draco's chair fell backwards when he abruptly stood up. He was looking at Harry in disbelief. "You
Hermione looked at him with concern. “Harry?”
Luna cooed “Oh, oh”, while Parkinson just smirked.
“Lately you have been doing quite well at Potions,” commented Hermione, lips pursed.
Draco smirked. “I was actually planning to make the first years do it.” And with that parting comment, he started walking away.
“You are going to do fine, Ron,” tried Harry again. “Just relax."
“I am.” Harry grinned back.
Harry forced himself to look down, finding a tiny piece of night sky laid on his palm, a string of white stars blinking at him. “This is yours,” he managed to whisper. It was getting harder to speak, and he didn’t know if it was the confusion or the lump on his throat.
“I don’t know,” said Hermione. She let out a sigh and started rolling up her parchment. “Listen, what are you planning for the next meeting?"
“Probably the badge you made,” joked Harry, as he started drying his hair with the towel.
It was Kreacher’s fault that the Malfoys tried to use Sirius to make Harry walk into the Ministry, and also his fault that Draco had to stop him by making a harsh decision.
Draco scoffed, “Merlin, you are hopeless.” He studied the board carefully. “Pick the tower. No, not that one- Oh, just let me.” He moved the piece and grinned. “Your turn, Weasley.”
But someone else was. Nott ducked his head when Harry caught him looking at him, and quickened his steps out of the Hall- No. Harry felt his heart spike when he realised Nott was trying to catch up to Draco. He ground his teeth. What the fuck was Nott doing?
He could feel Draco's hands on his hair, firmly pulling his face closer, and his waist under his hands as he did the same. The kiss was gentle, slow and sweet, and Harry smiled into it, feeling over the moon when Draco did too.
“Do not interrupt me, Potter,” hissed Snape. “We believe it’s only recently that he has noticed the connection, which means that no, he hasn’t been sharing your thoughts. But if he knows now, he could try to do so, which brings us to Occlumency." Snape stood up from his desk and took out his wand. “I’m going to attempt breaking into your mind, Potter, you can use your wand and try to defend yourself in any way."
The walls of the Potions classroom were lined with shelves, stocked to the fullest with bottles, boxes and jars of ingredients. It spoke of Snape’s mean nature that very fragile bottles were placed at the very top, riskily close to the edge, and cruelly far from Harry and Hermione’s reach.
“Don’t make a big deal out of it, Weasley,” said Draco dismissively, but then gave Harry a pointed look. “You can do it."
Draco blinked. “Now?" he repeated.
“Don’t call me that," snarled Dudley.
Hey hey hey!
“Then why didn’t you?"
“Harry!” said Hermione brightly, Ron coming after her. “How are you? Did you get everything already?”
They passed by them, Harry looking briefly at the group. They were passing a paper around, Parkinson grabbed it and her eyes went big, her mouth curving in surprised amusement. Goyle looked lost, looking a the rest for an explanation.
"What?" gaped Ron.
“Anything to make you stop.”
He passed by the door to Pomfrey’s room and then next to the occupied beds very quietly. He glanced at the sleeping occupants, noticing one Crabbe with flippers for ears, a Goyle with painful looking blisters and a Parkinson with another pair of antlers. By all their pillows laid beets that Harry recognized as the ones Luna wore to keep nargles away. She had probably visited them.
“Oh, aren’t you?” Draco shoved at him, making him step back. “Everything is going great for you now, isn’t it? Fudge lost his power, Dumbledore is back, everyone knows the Dark Lord has returned. Merlin, I think even Black might be cleared out soon!” Draco let out a mirthless laugh, his silver eyes starting to well up in frustration. “Everything always goes well for you! Always! But now I can’t even blame Dumbledore, no-” His voice cracked as he clenched his own shirt. “I did this.
Draco shook his head. “You have a
It was a shame that the Marauder’s map didn’t work on the train, but it would also be a waste of effort, since there was a single hall. To his left, he could see the trolley witch, so that only left his right. He walked that way, ignoring how other students peered at him through the windows of their compartments as he passed by.
?” chimed in his twin.
"Didn't he
"...flashes of it,” said Snape neutrally. He raised his wand again. “Remain focused, clear your mind and let go of all emotion."
He already knew the answer to all those, he just didn’t know what it meant.
Luna shook her head, making the Eagle on top of her hat wobble along. "Not today, but if you want my Slytherin hat I could bring it for you."
“Neither did you."
Lupin nodded. “I’ll go get him, he is upstairs looking for Kreacher. We think he might be hiding in the attic again.” The man hurried out of the living room, leaving Harry alone before the chimney. He shuffled in place, his knees already beginning to feel numb against the floor.
“Shit,” said Harry, and Sirius sent Remus a victorious look that went ignored. “So he is just as bad as Fudge?”
“There are many reasons,” says Malfoy, eyes flickering to Harry’s. “If the board of governors heard, they wouldn’t let me stay. I would be out of your hair. Merlin knows I wouldn’t miss a chance like that.”
Harry glanced at the bench the blond was sitting on, noticing the now empty bottle of ink. He then looked down at the almost finished Transfiguration essay he had been working on and scrunched his nose.
, as the loony man said. Very important people to the champions, why would-"
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Tell me he is not coming with us."
Harry felt his face go warm. “No, I don’t.”
What his godfather had been laughing at, and what made Harry snort as well, was on the wall next to the door. A huge poster that didn’t have a Wanted person, but big bold words that presented a product called
Harry looked down at the Prophet, finding the big bold letters in the front page announcing what he had known since last year;
The blond hummed. “I could try to meet you afterwards, so we do our homework together."
"But you are serious about this."
“Ron Weasley, sir.”
"Poor you," said Pansy without a sliver of sympathy. "He just needs time, Blaise."
Draco let out a hum as he returned, his steps echoing in the bathroom. He passed him the towel with a frown. “Sounds to me like you’ll have to retrieve some kind of treasured object. Any ideas of what it might be?”
Harry frowned. “He wouldn’t, but-"
the right shade of white-blond.
“What list?” asked Harry.
"Draco did," said Crabbe, so busy in the process of signing his name that he didn't take in the surprised expression of Ron and Hermione. "Said we didn't have to sign if we didn't want to," he added.
Harry hummed, then clapping to attract the attention of the group once again. "Alright, while we sort this out I want everyone to pair up. We are going to start with the basics, the Disarming Charm, so-"
angry? Or just busy? I mean, he and his mom must be swarmed by Ministry officials right now, looking for dark artefacts and all that.”
Harry blinked at him, awed at the lingering warmth on his face that made his head feel light.
." He raised his hands in defeat. “Whatever, I’m out then. See ya- Ah!"  His retreat was stopped by the arrival of another group of people, one of them throwing an arm around Ron’s shoulders in a rough way that Harry had learned wasn’t always malicious, but playful.
Parkinson grinned in amusement. "What gave her away?"
Harry let his hand fall. “Draco...” It was embarrassing how close to a beg his voice was, but he would gladly kneel on the floor if it meant Draco wouldn’t leave. “Just- Just wait a second,” he said, both to keep Draco there and to give himself time to grasp the correct words.
There was a beat of silence when Draco didn't reply, and both Harry and the twins turned to look at him in surprise.
“Oh, fine!” She raised a finger towards Draco, “Don’t ever barge in like that again, Mr Malfoy,” she warned, before disappearing behind the screen.
“Sirius!” he called. “Are you there?” He could hear steps approaching, the hope quickly dying when Kreacher came into view. His ugly face looked terribly pleased and that didn’t sit well with Harry. “Where is Sirius?”
“I’m not going,” he promised into his ear and Draco hugged him back tightly. Harry didn’t speak for a moment, blinking at the space behind Draco as he was overwhelmed by emotions. He felt like crying, like laughing, screaming or dancing, but mostly he felt like never letting go of him. “Thank you, Draco,” he murmured. “I thought Sirius was- I thought that I would lose him, and you-” He stopped and brushed his lips against his blond head. “
“Harry, we thought we heard your lovely voice,” said Fred.
“For what?"
"Harry-"
thought Harry, as he let the hands under his retreat when Draco, startled by the voice, took a step back.
Harry blinked in confusion, wondering it the blond was actually angry. But then he caught his eyes again and saw them sparkling. “You are kidding," said Harry with a smile, and then just to be sure, "Right?"
He shrugged.
Flourish and Blotts was next and, despite having more customers, none of them looked particularly happy to be there and left as quickly as they could. Harry spotted some familiar faces, like Cho’s snitch of a friend Marietta, who ducked her head when she saw him, and Seamus, who waved at him before his mother dragged him away.
"I don't," said Harry, grinning at him. "Sorry."
As it advanced, they watched Sirius run along on the platform, to the amusement of the remaining parents on it. Once they turned a corner, and the station disappeared, Fred and George excused themselves, and so did Ron and Hermione.
The Requirement Room had not been decorated with pink flowers, red hearts or anything of the sort, but that didn't stop some of the D.A members from celebrating Valentine's.
“Ah, I see,” said Draco simply, turning his gaze towards the carriage, where everyone else was already seated. Something made him pause briefly, and then he extended a hand to Harry without taking his eyes off the carriage. “Help me up, will you?"
“There’s no such thing as too sweet,” said Draco, like any person with a sweet tooth would.
“I would have wanted to have his brother as well, Sirius,” continued Slughorn. “You probably have heard of him, he was cleared of all charges just a few days ago. I
bad thing to Harry, while Uncle Vernon hadn’t even waited until they got in the car before muttering about Harry’s criminal godfather.
“Oh? So you
The woman looked more saddened now, bringing a hand to her chest. “Oh, poor thing. I can’t imagine how hard it must be for him. When I saw the Prophet-”
’ thought Harry, and then realised he hadn’t said anything yet. “Er, yes, sir."
Draco kissed him again, relaxing against him when Harry rounded his waist with an arm. After what could be either several minutes or an hour, he pulled back and smiled at him, so fondly that it made Harry’s heart skip. “You have made your point, Harry,” he whispered. “Now do leave before Pomfrey comes back to check on Montague.”
The door closed by itself, perhaps a bit too harshly. “Snivellus teaching Defense, I can’t believe this, that old man is going senile. Has been going senile for the past ten years but no one heard me, no, sir,” said Sirius under his breath. Harry only nodded along, walking with him until they reached the bottom of the stairs.
“I hope so, Angelina told me to not cause much trouble because she was going to ask her-” Harry frowned. “Wait, she already gave it to Slytherin?"
“But you fancy them,” pointed Hermione.
“I think I can manage” replied Harry with a grin. “Thanks.”
He had been so stupid. All the signs had been there; the dark circles under his eyes, the sicking paleness of his skin, the disappearances during consecutive nights every month, the fucking
“That we are,” mused Harry. He smiled when the blond grimaced at the beetles. “Some things change, I guess.”
“Well, good afternoon,” said Umbridge, once everyone had sat down. She made the class greet her, wrote the course aims on the board and then told them to put their wands away and read the first chapter of
“Accidentally, Ron!” whispered Hermione. “And he cleaned it up and went on with his business. Not even sneering at me.”
dashing git."
“I can speak for myself, sir,” cut in Hermione sternly, startling the man. “He hasn’t apologized, not yet. But I’m sure he will, at the proper time."
“Harry Potter!” Lupin’s protest was drowned by the laughs of the younger Weasleys and Sirius, who had almost spat out his wine. Lupin turned to his friend with an accusing look and only received a grin in return.
The git’s features were sharp, yes, but in a normal human way that didn’t look bad. One could say they looked alright when he was not sporting his usual sneer, that twisted his features and pissed Harry off. Like at that moment over breakfast, where the git kept his face relaxed as he listened to something one of his friends said, curling his lips into an amused smirk that was not unpleasant to look at.
“Yes, but-”
Kudos? Please
“Then?"
Harry laughed. “No, lions are usually kept behind bars,” he explained patiently. “Snakes and smaller animals are kept behind glass, but it’s a very strong kind.”
He halted his words when he saw Snape approaching the table. The professor studied the cauldrons, eyes narrowing in irritation as he saw Harry’s seemingly perfect potion. His examination was promptly finished when Neville’s cauldron fell to the floor, the potion still stuck to the bottom of it. “Fill a flagon with your potion, label it and bring it to the desk,” said Snape to the class, then moving to torment Neville.
As expected, Draco was grinning mischievously, something Harry had come to like very much. But just next to his head, behind him and pinned to the wooden wall of one shop, was the black and white face of his aunt. Bellatrix also looked triumphant in the Wanted sign, half-lidded dark eyes and an arrogant smile stretching her lips. It felt like looking at Draco next to Sirius again, but instead of pleased surprise at the resemblance, Harry felt as if he had been slapped and physically reeled back.
Harry bit back a bitter laugh. “No, they are not.” He frowned at his lap. “It’s something I hadn’t expected, or really considered, and doesn’t fit the idea I had of them. I thought I knew them, but now I don’t know what to think.”
“I KNOW!” exclaimed Harry. He was back on the floor but barely registered it.
“Yeah!” snapped George, surprising the three of them, that looked at him expectantly. George actually looked a bit annoyed. “And?" Ron gaped at him. “I think you have forgotten, Ronniekins, that this isn’t a two-person match,” continued George tersely. “This is a
Hermione grinned. “Let’s just say it will make Eloise Midgen’s acne look like a couple of cute freckles."
“-but still. The bigger snakes are, and yesterday a bunch of maniacs in our house were swooning over them!”
“Salazar, Potter! Are you actually insane?” hissed Malfoy harshly.
She let out a sigh and went back to her chart. "I already told you you should leave it," she said sternly. "If he isn't telling you it must be for a reason." Harry scrunched his nose, and Hermione must have a sixth sense because she immediately looked up again and gave him a chiding look. "You have to respect that, Harry."
“It would have been fun to be prefects together,” said Draco. “But maybe this way I can make sure you don’t do anything stupid. You better behave, Harry, I can deduct points, you know."
read the bold letters over a photo of Draco standing side by side with his mother. Both wore identical expressions of schooled indifference as numerous flashes went off, but Harry caught it, the downwards tug on the corner of Draco’s lower lip, barely there but now impossible to look away from as the photo looped again and again, and-
“I think so,” said Neville.
Harry gave him a thin smile. “Yeah, thanks." He stumbled out of the room, his head feeling heavy, and passed by a mirror, stopping as he caught a glance of himself.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows, “What?”
His back was hitting the wall before he could finish the sentence. “Shut up,” said Draco in a low voice, threatening like the tip of his wand against Smith’s throat.
Fay Dunbar didn’t seem put off by Ron's shock or the quietness of the room, only giving them all a shrug. “I said Draco Malfoy is quite handsome,” she answered nonchalantly.
“Are you alright?” asked Draco after studying Harry’s tired face.
“Fleur is smart too. She was selected for the Tournament, remember?” pointed out Harry. Both girls sent him a nasty glare but he didn’t waver. What was their problem? Fleur wasn’t a bad person and from what Harry had seen, she and Bill seemed to love each other a lot.
He didn’t turn back when Harry called for him, and, despite the urge to run after him, Harry kept seated on the bench, arms crossed and head leaning back on the wall. He let out an exasperated sigh, as he listened to the sound of Draco walking away.
Ron seemed like he wanted to say something, but finally just shook his head. “Way too late for this. Night, Harry."
His burning eyes began to blur at the sight of the stars, so he shoved the pin inside his jacket and threw it inside his trunk with a grunt of frustration. Hedwig chirped at him, making him stop from where he had been about to kick his bed.
.” Harry had to grin and was pleased when Draco only rolled his eyes fondly. Then the blond grimaced. “That reminds me, I have to go back. Do you think it’s gone?”
“A drawing room is meant for guests, Harry," said Draco, as if that weren't ridiculous.
be less of a fanatic than he is; neither would dear Narcissa."
“With the egg, you troll.” Draco sighed. “Do you have any clue of where to start?”
“But you were unsuccessful?"
Harry had to bite his tongue to not snap. “He is not going to say anything, Hermione,” he said angrily, feeling offended on Draco's behalf. He was sure of it, but Hermione didn’t seem convinced at all and Harry had already opened his mouth to repeat himself in a harsher tone when he understood.
“You two are ridiculous,” said Ron when Harry snatched the letter away from him.
"Don't worry, I'll find a way," promised Harry. When the blond looked at him, he gave him a smile. "I can't embarrass the whole school, now, can I?"
thought Harry, gaze moving to where Hermione was doing her homework, a complicated looking chart that reminded him of something. "Nott."
. “I don’t know,” said Harry. “He just said we will talk later.”
Draco fixed his shirt, “And I expect you to return it safely,” he said sternly. “It’s quite valuable for me.”
His voice startled Harry, because it sounded completely pissed, as if he was outraged at having to say anything in the first place, as if he expected the elf to already be there. He called Kreacher like Lucius had once called Dobby and Harry could only stare.
Not much longer after that, the students were pretty much kicked out of the room by the teachers, for the Halloween Feast to be set in place. Harry and the rest of the Gryffindors walked back to their tower. The anticipation had everyone positively trembling with excitement. Harry was pulled into a discussion on possible Champions. It was a unanimous agreement that Krum would be selected for Durmstrang, and Ron was vouching for a Beauxbatons' student called Fleur.
"You are weird," mumbled Dudley, scratching the back of his head. "Whatever, thanks for not leaving me to die and that, er, four eyes, then."
“What? No more stunning?” asked Draco with a wide grin. “What will I do without it?"
Hope you liked the chapter! As usual, comments and kudos are very appreciated. I like hearing your thoughts! Have a nice week!
,” he insisted when the men turned towards him in disbelief. “It’s not what it seems, I swear, I’ll explain later but I don’t have much time now.” He breathed in and looked at them seriously. “I wanted to talk about my father.”
Draco chewed slowly, his delighted expression turning a bit embarrassed when Harry kept looking at him. “Sorry,” he said after he finished, offering the other half to Harry. “Here."
Instead, he took a deep breath and continued.
“I hate you,” said Ron, studying the board. “Alright, so he is here because you will miss him for some unknown reason. I get that. But why are
“That’s not even how the saying goes, Ron,” said Hermione. “And you can’t just ask Harry to forget everything like that. You are so insensitive!”
Ginny’s eyes went comically wide, while her parents, Sirius and Lupin only stared at Harry, without saying anything.
’ “This is a bit hard to explain, but listen-”
The air seemed fresher, the grass was soft and one could almost hear the breeze shaking the trees, but the most redeemable feature was the one over them. "Every class, Firenze has us lay on the floor and look at the stars," explained Harry. "Says that's where the story of mankind is written."
,” he said, turning to smile at Draco in excitement. “You did it!"
As usual, Harry made his way to the library after dinner, it having become his go-to spot when they didn’t have D.A meetings. However, today Hermione insisted on coming along. Harry hadn’t asked her for a reason, but judging from the frown she had had since they left Hagrid’s class, he had a sense of what it was about.
“Now you sound like me,” Sirius placed a hand on his shoulder. “Harry, believe me, I’d rather kiss a troll’s unwashed ass that put any trust in that greasy twat, but so far he hasn’t tricked us and, this is Moony’s argument, Dumbledore vouches for him. That has to mean something, right?”
George leaned in to whisper theatrically. “They are still a prototype, but we might lend you a pair, for being our investor and all." He threw them at Harry. “So, why don’t we give them a try now?"
“Have you heard anything?”
“No,” said Draco, grinning when Harry frowned. “At least not now, there’s somewhere else I have to be."
“The best,” grinned Harry, then turning towards the table and noticing two awful things. First, Hagrid wasn’t there either, and second- “That’s that Umbridge woman. From my hearing."
“Yeah,” said Harry, looking down at it for a second. It was warm. Then he looked up and returned the smile. “Yeah, thank you,” he said, reaching to hold Draco’s hand in his. It was warm too and Harry couldn’t resist the impulse to bring it to his lips and kiss it.
“So, what is he like?” asked Sirius after a moment, sounding a bit strained. “Little Draco."
Okay I'm late, but it's still Thursday here! Work and uni are catching up with me haha (damn). Anyways, I hope you liked the new chapter! Please leave a comment, I love hearing your thoughts! I'll see you on Monday!
Hermione smiled and with that Harry kissed her cheek and bounded up the stairs towards his dormitory. Hermione watched him go, It wasn’t an unusual feeling for her to know something that somebody else didn’t, however it was unusual that she knew something about Harry that he himself did not  and probably would not know for a long time. She smiled to herself as she walked towards her dormitory remembering the light that had filled Harry’s eyes as he had told her about his exploits and the pink tinge that had crept to the tip of his ears as he had told her that Draco had winked at him. She shook her head with a soft chuckle and just said, ‘boys.’
‘I’m always right,’ he replied matter of factly. At this Harry gave a loud guffaw of laughter.  Draco snapped his head around and fixed Harry with a hard stare. Harry was not to be intimidated and poked his tounge out at the blonde Slytherin.
‘It’s a shame that the troll did not flatten her at Halloween.’
‘Erm, ok, so, what’s your favourite subject?’
.....................
Every insecurity that Draco had felt in his short life came crashing over him like a tidal wave, Harry had stood him up, that much was obvious, Harry didn’t want him anymore, he didn’t want their friendship.
‘For you,’
‘I’m so glad you’re ok but you do realize that you are banned from playing Quidditch for the rest of your life, just so you know’ Draco was only half joking.
Ron threw him an evil glare and pushed himself up from the floor, 'Is there a reason you think I need reminding of that you prat? My sister and best friend are in there, and Pansy too'.
‘A Hufflepuff,’ Draco grumbled and threw himself dramatically on to the sofa behind him. Pansy chuckled, ‘Yep, it’s adorable,’ she said swiftly ducking out of the way of the thrown cushion that had hurtled in her direction,
‘Harry, you do like boys don’t you?’ Ron asked quietly.
‘You like Snape!’ spluttered Ron, ‘But he’s a man, but that means ...’ The rest of the sentence was left unsaid as Ron stared, open-mouthed at Blaise.
Harry spun on his heels at the sound of the drawling tone. It was a voice he hadn’t heard all year, and admittedly, begrudgingly to himself, missed the sound of. He stopped in the corridor waiting for Malfoy to catch up with him, he was aware of hundreds of eyes on them, watching, waiting for something to happen between the pair, a fight or an argument perhaps, but things had been different since the beginning of term, there was too much water under the bridge between them, they had been through too much, seen too much suffering; gone was the old animosity. They had saved each other from certain destruction and Harry had kept Malfoy out of Azkaban. Even so,  before now any interaction they had had was a nod of acknowledgement perhaps even the flicker of a smile as they passed one another in the hallways. Harry was unsure of Malfoy’s intentions and tensed, hand flickering towards his wand, but he held steady as the Slytherin closed the distance between them.
‘Words have always had the power to change the world.’
Green eyes met silver.
‘He’s awake,’ he yelled over his shoulder at the people behind him earning him a glare from Madam Pomfrey.
The Gryffindor table began to fill around him as did the rest of the Great Hall, Ron always liked to get their a little earlier to get the best food and make the most of breakfast time, something he was unable to do at home being one of seven children, he didn’t even look up from his plate as he reached over to pick up his goblet of Pumpkin Juice. Ron was distracted and did not immediately register the slight tickling sensation on his hand, he lifted the goblet to his lips and his eyes landed on the cause of the tickles, a small spider was carefully making its way across Ron’s hand, slowly choosing its path from finger to finger. Ron spluttered, his eyes opened wide with fear, as round as two Galeons on his red face, he began whimpering and started shaking his hand from side to side to dislodge the unwelcome guest, Gryffindor’s on all sides of him were suddenly showered in Ron’s untouched Pumpkin Juice whilst the spider stoically remained seemingly enjoying the ride. With a final shake of his hand Ron’s goblet flew out of his hand and smacked Lavender Brown firmly on the side of the face, the girls hand flew up as she glared at Ron tears filling her eyes from the pain, she got up from the table and fled the hall closely followed by her girl friends. The majority of the table were, shouting, swearing and glaring at Ron who didn’t notice, his eight legged tormentor was clinging on as though it’s life depended on it, which it probably did. Fred had watched this take place and was yet again embarrassed by the behaviour of his little brother. He made his way over to Ron and clasped his brother on the shoulder and hissed in his ear and the boys whimpering was attracting attention from every house table,
Ron risked a glance across the Great Hall towards the Slytherin table where Draco was seemingly in heated conversation with Blaise  and Pansy, he looked back towards Harry and Hermione finding them both watching him intently, he shrugged, ‘I guess he’s  not that bad.’
Harry felt the heat rising from his neck  and turned quickly towards the fire hoping Hermione wouldn’t notice, ‘Blimey Hermione that’s a lot of questions, we’re great thanks.’
‘They will always find each other, mine does the same,’ Harry smiled.
Harry sighed, ‘ Not now Colin.’ The small blonde boy looked up at Harry with an adoring smile and said dreamily, ‘Okay Harry, anything for you Harry.’
Draco huffed as Pansy pulled the deep hood down over his head to cover his bright and distinctive head of hair.
Hermione looked at the blonde boy who recently had become one of her closest friends, with shock, as she looked in to his eyes and could see them burning deeply with hurt and anger, ‘What did he do Draco, what do you mean caught out?’
During her speech Harry had arrived in the common room and was stood silently in the corner hoping not to interrupt, it had broken his heart to hear Hermione so sad, but deep down he knew she was right.
‘Hogwarts, dear? She said, when Harry started to speak ‘Got the lot here – another young man being  fitted up just now in fact.’
‘Shit, sorry drake, I didn’t mean that, I know he’s your father I’m sorry,’ Harry stuttered.
‘You’re joking, Seeker, but first –years never- you must be the youngest house player in about – ‘
Neville’s grin spread across his face as he realised that Malfoy knew about this friendship and that it still existed, he had never felt happier, he was still beaming as he scratched out his reply;
Harry watched as Ron’s eyebrows almost disappeared in to his hair line.
‘Behave Drake what’s a little drool between friends.’
Draco sounded tired but resigned to his fate, as though he knew his question was pointless. A second or two passed and then Ron heard Pansy reply softly, ‘You know why Draco, I needed to see him.’
‘Very well,’ the elf scurried away and Harry turned to Malfoy, ‘Shall we sit?’
Draco begrudgingly agreed and after saying goodbye to Snape he left the dungeons, at least he knew Harry was going to be ok.
Draco felt himself tense at the admission, looking away quickly to cover his shock, had he heard correctly? He felt the flutter of hope from earlier steadily making its way back up, ‘Gay?’ he repeated almost as a question, Harry nodded, ‘Gay as the day is long, Draco wished he had a drink of something as suddenly his mouth had gone very dry. The silence hung for a minute between the two of them creating a thick tension in the air, Draco needed to break it, he turned once more to Harry ‘So, do you still want to see it?’
Harry woke first and for a moment forgot why they were all there, he felt content and happy as he felt Draco’s strong arm wrapped around him, his back pressed snugly against the boys firm chest. He glanced to his left and saw the, now familiar sight of Blaise curled protectively around his smaller boyfriend,  but Harry got a shock when he turned to his right and saw his best friend tightly pressed against Pansy’s back with one long arm wrapped around her middle, pulling her in close to him, something about the picture they painted niggled at Harry but before he could think anymore about it his friends began to wake around him.
......
Harry heard the voice again... he turned wide-eyed to Ron, ‘Can you not hear that?’ Ron shook his head, Hermione, however, clapped a hand to her forehead.
‘Sleepover,’ he confirmed with a nod.
Ron whirled around to find himself face to face with five Slytherins, Draco at their head, flanked by Blaise and Pansy, who in turn were flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
Draco looked at his boyfriend and swallowed the lump forming in his throat, he began to talk, telling Harry his version of what had happened in the corridor and how he had interpreted it. Harry listened with wide eyes, when Draco finished Harry shook his head widely from side to side;
They landed with a thud on the damp floor of a dark, stone tunnel.
‘Right,’ he said, sitting on Harry, ‘here is your singing valentine.’
Draco had indeed known and that knowledge had created similar stirrings in himself seemingly moments after he had calmed himself down. The joy of hormones, luckily the class had been too tense waiting for them to fight to notice anything else amiss.
......
‘Harry stop apologising, believe it or not I’m glad that you want to tell people. I will admit it is a little difficult for me at the moment but it won’t always be that way, if you and Blaise trust Longbottom then so do I, and if Ron decides to say something we will deal with that as it happens. Wait is that why he hit you? Because we are friends?’
......
Draco stopped abruptly and turned, wide eyed, to Harry, ‘No... he wouldn’t...’
‘Who is it?’ said Madam Hooch , who had sunk, weak-kneed into a chair. ‘Which student?’
Draco wasn’t the only one who had changed over the summer, as Draco took in his friend’s dishevelled and soot covered appearance he noticed that Harry’s features  had altered, they had become more defined with the beginnings of a strong jaw line, Draco’s eyes lingered over Harry’s jaw for a second or two longer than necessary, Harry hadn’t grown in height or not that Draco could notice. Draco’s breath caught in his throat as he heard Harry’s now deeper voice for the first time,
A week later, Harry and Hermione were walking across the Entrance Hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up.
Draco screwed his eyes up tightly and rubbed them hard with the tips of his fingers, he waited a second, not knowing whether he wanted it to be true or not, then opened his eyes, blinking as they readjusted to the dull light. He could not believe it, he blinked one more time, just to be sure, but no, there he was, as sure as Draco’s chest was rising and falling with each breath he took, Harry Potter was there, trying and failing to hide in a dusty corner of Borgin and Burkes. A million and one things crossed Draco’s mind at that moment, he really did not want his father to see his Gryffindor friend, he however wanted to speak to him so much if only to admonish him for wandering around Knockturn Alley and alone for that matter, did the boy simply not know how dangerous it was, especially for him.
‘I know Ron but I trust Draco, you’re dad is only repeating what he’s heard but why would l Lucius lie?’
‘Guys I don’t mean to be rude,’ Neville interrupted quietly, heat rising a little in his cheeks as though he was embarrassed at his own outburst  ‘but can we fill her in later, we kind of have some important business to discuss.’ Blaise stood at his side with a hand on the small of his back in a silent show of support and nodded his agreement.
......
‘Sorry no’ he whispered.
Draco started at being spoken to, he felt Harry give his knee a reassuring squeeze so cleared his throat to speak,
As if by magic Neville sat up, rubbing his eyes sleepily, and nodded. ‘Traitor,’ Blaise grumbled good naturedly, wrapping a long arm around Neville’s waist and pulling him back down on to the bed. ‘Sleep now, presents later yeah,’ Blaise sleepily mumbled. Draco had had enough, he got out of bed and stomped over towards the sleepy pair, he grabbed hold of their blankets and in one swift tug had pulled them off the bed and on to the floor. Before Draco had time to take a step backwards Blaise jumped up and threw himself at Draco narrowly missing the blonde, who squeaked indignantly and ran to hide behind his boyfriend who had just climbed from the bed and was currently laughing loudly at the two Slytherins, ‘Malfoy, I swear to god.’ Blaise seethed under his breath. Harry valiantly stood his ground between the two boys causing Draco to smirk at his friend over the Gryffindor’s shoulder. Blaise growled and made another lunge at Draco when Neville spoke from behind him, ‘We are up now Blaise we should just do presents.’ At hearing Neville’s voice Blaise stopped trying to get at Draco and with a final growl in his direction he turned and followed the small boy over to the Christmas tree. Draco chuckled, ‘Big Blaisey tamed by an ickle Gryffindor who would have guessed.’ Harry gave Draco a warning glare as they walked over to the tree, Draco promptly stopped speaking but the irony was not lost on anyone.
Whatever reaction Harry was expecting was not the blank stare that he received from his boyfriend. ‘Are you sure?’ Draco asked incredulously.  Harry nodded once, looking confusedly at the blond, wondering about his strange reaction, ‘I’m as sure as I can be, I heard Mr and Mrs Weasley arguing about telling me, Mr Weasley wanted me to know. To be aware of the danger I’m in. Apparently Black was even talking about me in Azkaban, he knows I’m here, he’s going to come here and kill me if he has his way.’ Draco shook his head, ‘No he can’t be,’ Harry was sure that Draco said this more to himself than anything,
‘Pans,’ another, deeper voice joined the first two, this voice full of sympathy but with the edge of warning.
Before Harry could bring himself to respond a small red-headed girl stepped in front of him and glared up at Draco, ‘Leave him alone’ she demanded with as much force as she could muster.
‘We can’t get to him...... I couldn’t ..... the fire ....... I’m sorry.’
Draco smiled at Harry’s nickname for him for him, bloody hell this boy never ceased to amaze him. He hugged Harry, burying his head in his shoulder, Harry smiled, ‘idiot,’ he chuckled.
‘Hey!’ exclaimed Goyle, but was immediately silenced at the look on Drcao’s face. Draco unwrapped the frog catching it just before it escaped his grasp. He bit the head off as he looked down at the famous wizard card,
Harry looked back at Draco, ‘Friends?’ he asked.
‘A Nimbus Two Thousand sir,’ said Harry and he looked up into Draco’s silver eyes, ‘And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,’ he added with a smile.
He was lost in thought and didn’t notice the hush that fell across The Great Hall until Hermione nudged him sharply in the ribs, his head snapped up ready to snap as his bushy haired friend;  ‘What the?’ he was cut short as he saw the reason for the silence (and his sore ribs), his mouth went dry as he took in the sight before him. Draco Malfoy was stood at the bottom of the Gryffindor table staring right at him, and not only that but he looked drop dead gorgeous, his blond hair was pointed in to one sharp Mohawk across his head, he was wearing jeans so tight they looked painted on and a tight black vest full of rips, offering occasional glimpses of milky white skin beneath, and, od dear Merlin, was he wearing eyeliner? Harry swallowed hard and watched as Draco twitched nervously, the blond began to speak; ‘Pot … I mean Harry, you do deserve it you know,  to be loved, of course you do, I am …  I’m an idiot, how could you ever forgive me? I mean I thought it was me that didn’t deserve it, I thought it was a punishment for you to end up with me, who the hell would want me?  But well after a good talking to,’ here he risked a glance at the staff table where two professors watched with more of a  vested interest than the others, one was grinning ear to ear and the other, well the other was Snape! Draco turned back to Harry, ‘ So I realised that I do deserve happiness and so do you so ….
‘Give it a rest Pans, he’s got enough trouble coming his way when Malfoy senior finds out, he needs us to be his friends,’ looking at Draco he continued, ‘Like I said mate we’ve got your back,’ Draco smiled, ‘ Good because I need your help, I really want to see him before we leave,’
‘GET A BLOODY MOVE ON!’
He had eventually made his way back to the common room, seeking the solace of his two best friends.  Luckily they had both been there, ensconced together in a dark corner. It was clear to them immediately that there was something wrong with him, Pansy had leapt up and wrapped her arms around him, he couldn’t help it, there in her embrace he let his icy exterior slip for the second time that day and he cried, he cried for himself and he cried for Harry. Because of him Harry thought he couldn’t be loved, that he didn’t have a chance at happiness. What could he even do about it? He had sat down heavily and told them the whole sorry tale, this is what had prompted Pansy’s outburst.
‘EXPELLIARMUS!’
‘and me’ interrupted Blaise Zabini who was sitting across from them and apparently had heard every word. ‘Okay,’  he said after a moment, ‘but not here though.’
‘Well,’ Neville started and then began to blush, ‘Go on Nev.’ Prompted Blaise, placing an arm around the boy’s shoulders.
‘Harry look, ‘ he whispered as he pointed towards the shimmering pool before them.  Harry frowned and took a step towards it keeping Draco close to his side. As they neared they noticed there was a trail of blood leading away from the puddle. It was eerie to see the silver shimmering on the dark forest floor. Harry felt his grip on Draco tighten.
McGonagol strode over towards the discarded clothing silencing the laughing students around her with her stern glare. With the flick of a wrist she levitated Ron’s school trousers and shook them lightly, nothing happened expect a few pieces of crumpled white paper falling to the floor.
.......
‘Where the hell are we?’ Pansy was stood, just beyond the threshold of the room and her question had been barely louder than a whisper.
Draco watched as Harry pulled the cloak from off himself, smiling as the boy’s head appeared from beneath its folds,  ‘Hey,’ he said as he walked over to greet the smaller boy, ‘Hey yourself,’ Harry replied with a cheeky grin reaching up to give Draco a quick peck on the cheek. He dropped his cloak to the floor and stepped in to Draco’s embrace, he wrapped his arms tightly around the blond’s waist and pulled him close, he buried his head in Draco’s chest and inhaled deeply, the comforting smell of cinnamon and vanilla filled his senses as he relaxed in to the embrace. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders and rested his chin on the messy crop of hair beneath him, ‘I missed you,’ he whispered. Harry  lifted his head slowly and pressed a soft kiss to Draco’s lips, Draco pressed forward, moving his hand around to cup Harry’s cheek, he tilted his head slightly and deepened the kiss, a moan escaped Harry’s lips momentarily parting them and Draco pushed his tongue in to the gap created, Harry answered in kind and the kiss became more heated. Draco’s hand slid from Harry’s cheek and in to the nest of hair and gripped tightly. Harry moaned again at this treatment and gripped Draco even tighter, he felt as though electricity was coursing through his veins, every nerve ending was alive and tingling, a heat pooled in his belly as he tried to pull Draco even closer still. Suddenly Harry was aware of a growing hardness between his legs and pulled abruptly away from his boyfriend, trying but failing to hide his flaming red cheeks, he looked at Draco, standing there, shirt untucked, buttons open, hair ruffled, eyes glossed over and puffy, freshly kissed lips and groaned out loud. Draco looked on in askance; Harry spun round, turning his back on the blond, ‘Harry?’ Draco asked, voice laced with confusion and hurt. Harry groaned and dug the heels of his hands in to his eyes, ‘ ‘What is it?’ Draco asked, cautiously taking a step closer. Harry didn’t want to turn round; he was mortified, had Draco felt that? Why couldn’t he control himself? ‘ Harry you’re scaring me, please, what did I do?’ The pain in Draco’s voice was enough to make Harry swallow his pride and face his boyfriend, he caught the grey eyes and gazed, purposefully at his crotch, hoping to convey his meaning without having to actually use words, he wasn’t really sure if he could at that point. Draco tipped his head to one side as he watched Harry, he followed the boys gaze and his breath caught in his throat. He felt the heat rising in his cheeks as had caught on to the state Harry was in. Draco swallowed hard, he looked in to those green eyes he loved so much and made a decision, he stepped forward and took Harry’s hand, ‘Don’t be ashamed Harry.’
Harry either could not or would not lift his head up off the table.
Draco’s head snapped up  as he glared at the pouting girl next to him.
‘Drake you said you would behave,’
.......
Seamus whirled around, ‘Jeez Harry checking up on me much, I was in the library, happy?’
Ginny turned her head in the direction Harry was looking, she knew exactly what, or who she was going to see before her eyes fell on the tall blond Slytherin dancing by himself in the corner. Even to her he looked beautiful, his eyes were closed as he danced in time with the music seemingly lost to it, his head tipped back pulling the tendons taught in his strong neck, his school shirt was now almost transparent with sweat, tight across his chest as he threw his arms out to the sides. A bright light shone directly on to him, only for a moment, but it was enough for Ginny to see the dark shape adorning his ribcage. She turned and looked at her besotted best friend as his eyes roved over Draco as he danced, she would laugh if her heart didn’t break for him; ‘Did you see his tattoo Harry?’

..........
Draco’s heart was in his mouth as he fell and was extremely grateful when he landed in something soft and squishy. Draco lay still for a moment collecting his thoughts, he had no idea why he had just done what he had done, well he did, yet again he had acted without thinking because of Harry. Harry!! Draco jumped up and began to scrambled across the soft floor that he had landed on. Almost immediately he felt his arms and legs wrapped with strong vines and suddenly he could hardly move a muscle. Draco began to thrash widely in an attempt to loosen himself, unfortunately  this caused the vines to tighten further around him, Draco began to panic and a small whimper escaped from his lips then he heard a sickening snap as his wrist was broken, he fought the darkness that was threatening to take hold of him. Suddenly a jet of bright blue flames burst across his vision and he was dropped, unceremoniously on to the stone floor beneath him.
Terry Pratchett – Soul Music
Ron snorted and Harry realised with a start that he had practically just admitted to fancying Lockheart. He was very glad it was dark as he felt the heat rising in his cheeks.
Harry’s eyes widened as he pulled the silver ribbon from the wrapping, What did that mean? Harry smiled in recognition as he removed the paper that covered his very own Wizard chest set. Harry took a closer look at the set. It was beautiful, each player was an intricately carved  quidditch player mounted on a broom, he could not believe that this was now his, he had never owned anything like it, he would be scared to touch it. He had grumbled to Draco on more than one occasion about Ron’s skills at chess and how he would never beat him, well obviously Draco believed that he could so he would have to use his set to practice and show him that he could. It was then that Harry remembered the last present.
‘Nev can you get in touch with Malfoy please? I really need to talk to him’
Ron stood solidly as the girl he loved beat savagely at his chest. He took it; he knew he deserved it, for leaving them, for leaving her. He watched as Harry walked away, giving them a moment alone. His heart ached as he looked at the pain etched on her beautiful face, it was soul destroying to know he had been the cause of it. She looked up, tears staining her deep hazel eyes, clearly desperate to say something and then it happened, the air filled with the glorious sound of Hermione’s voice ‘You're breaking my heart if you leave me now, don't want to wait forever’ Ron watched the hazel eyes widen  in shock as she realised what had just happened, but, without missing a beat, the song, that had been raging around in Ron’s head for well over a year, came pouring out in response; ‘Baby it's all or nothing now, don't want to run and I can't walk out’.
The Slytherin sighed and looked down at the plate of untouched food  in front of him, biting back the tears that threatened to fall as he remembered, remembered the evils, remembered who he was, what he had done and how he did not deserve the heroes around him to treat him as an equal. He placed his fork down on the table and prepared to excuse himself, before he could make a move to speak Draco felt the weight of a hand on his knee, he looked right in to those big, beautiful green eyes that were shining with concern for him. Since that awful night that Harry had found him attempting to fill the dark void in his life with anything, even pain, he had never left his side and Draco knew that he didn’t deserve Harry’s attention, he had said it before and would probably repeat it may times in the future but the boy at his side just would not listen, Draco was broken, broken beyond help, he knew it, but Harry would not accept it, Harry felt the need to save everybody and Draco knew he could not be saved. He gave Harry a small smile, not wanting to bring attention to them and commenced picking at his food, a small smile appearing on his face as he realised Harry’s hand had remained on his knee.  Draco realised he was not leaving the table anytime soon and began to pay attention to the rest of his companions and was amused to hear Blaise flirting with an extremely flustered Finnegan.
‘Scared?’ muttered Draco, so that Lockheart couldn’t hear him.
“Draco do you think you could flirt with me?”
Harry felt the relief instantly, a cool tingling sensation enveloped the searing heat, curling itself around every part of it until it was extinguished.
‘Come on, bed time,’ Draco stood up, brushing the dust from the seat of his trousers and holding a hand out to Harry, Harry took it and stood.
Draco looked at him with a raised eyebrow, ‘Any why wouldn’t I? Would you lie to me?’
Draco slowly turned to look at the boy who was sitting next to him, ‘Are you serious? I mean I know we suspected it, but to hear it confirmed like that and I heard about that Creevey boy too I’m sorry.’ Draco lifted his arm to place around Harry’s shoulders and the smaller boy leaned in to his touch.
‘I dare you to mess up your hair and leave it that way for the rest of the game.’
‘So erm ... who wants to play a game?’
The morning of the practice,  as his owl dropped another package in front of him he noticed a fuss at the Gryffindor table. He sooo wanted to know what was going on, it had to be better than the drivel he could hear around him at his own table. He decided to go and look, what harm could it do? As he got up and made a beeline for the red and gold table he noticed a few of his friends watching him. Shit, he thought as his Father’s words rang in his ears, ‘Malfoy’s don’t show weakness, weakness will be punished.’ I’m here now thought Draco, I’m being watched, what the hell do I do?
Draco had overheard two Gryffindor  girls talking about Hermione and knew that Harry would be worried.
......
‘What, drop my wand?’ Harry muttered causing Draco to fight back a snort and a small smile to grace Harry’s lips.
By the end of the summer Hogwarts castle began to resemble its former glory. It would be ready to open again in the September bringing new and old faces back together to try and move forward, to place the past behind them and move on.
......
‘Oh Draco,’ the girl simpered, ‘ Harry bloody Potter, the boy who lived, is about to get flattened by a mountain troll, he’s only gone off to bloody fight it to save the mudblood Granger,’ she scoffed.  It had taken Draco a matter of seconds to run from the Slytherin dungeon and he had found himself hurtling along the corridors, racing to get to the second floor girls bathrooms. He had no idea what he was going to do when he got there he just needed to get to Harry, to know that he was okay and he needed to know now. Draco threw himself around a corner and stopped himself just before he crashed straight into the back of Professor McGonagall. Luckily they didn’t notice him due to the commotion in the bathroom that they were running towards. Draco crept back around the corner, took a deep breath and waited. As Draco listened he saw Harry and his two friends being escorted past, presumably back to their dormitories. Draco breathed a sigh of relief and slumped back against the wall, maybe the rumours weren’t true , he’s have to ask Harry when he saw him later.
......
Ginny saw the moment he decided, he steeled himself and squared his shoulders; ‘you’re right,’ he said standing up as he exhaled through pursed lips and wiped his hands across the tight denim on his thighs, ‘I can do this ‘ Ginny was sure that was said more to himself than anything. He leaned down to press a kiss to her cheek ‘wish me luck?’
......
Harry smirked at Draco’s elegant script as Neville replied.
Draco’s eyes grew wide as he processed what Harry had just asked, he watched as Harry grew uncomfortable under his gaze and lift his  eyes  in a questioning glance, he could see that they were filled with fear and knew exactly what it had taken for Harry to ask that question.  He swallowed the lump that had formed in his throat and nodded slighty, ‘Ok.’ He said.
Draco witnessed the interchange and he too felt a warm sensation, this boy, Harry, had been upset about a remark made against him. Wow! He thought.  Goyle shifted bu his side and Draco came to his senses, the red head had laughed at him , his friends stood anxiously waiting. He had a show to put on.
‘Fine ... whatever.’
Harry stared as the words formed on his parchment, wonderful he thought  just what he needed, he sighed and penned his reply leaning back against the wall in the quiet corner of the Trophy room.
..... from that moment Hermione Granger became both of their friends. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.
‘So, is it true if you have an Irishman of your very own it makes you extremely lucky?’ Blaise asked with a raised eyebrow carefully placing a fork in to his mouth and removing it in an extremely seductive manner. Seamus’s eyes were wide as he watched this obvious display and choked his reply,
Seamus chuckled and stood up ‘Yes sir, I won’t be long.’ Seamus stopped for a minute to let his eyes rove over Harry’s body, ‘You could always join me you know.’
......
……………………………………………………………………………………………………….
Draco turned slightly and hooked a finger under Harry’s chin pulling the boy round to face him, ‘Harry, listen, what I am trying to say is that I don’t actually think a physical manifestation of the Grim exists, and , in my humble opinion it is probably much more likely that you are being followed around by a big, black dog.’
Draco really really did not want to say what he said next but as always his uncontrollable desire to put Harry first won over his other emotions;  ‘ Is there no one else to help, you know, kiss the scar, you know, when I am not there?’
After dinner Harry naturally made a beeline to the trophy room, on the way he stopped to collect his chess set and his cloak. He hoped Draco was going to be waiting for him, he was not disappointed.
Draco smiled, ‘I know what you mean, I’m with you on that one.’
‘I knew it,’ she said with a smile. Just then they heard footsteps approaching . Draco grabbed the top book from Hermione’s book pile and went to the table to his right, he quickly dropped his bag and opened the book at a random page and started to read. Draco and Hermione could still see one another  but he was hidden from the person who had just arrived by a large book shelf, he  relaxed and continued to read.
‘Ronald Weasley don’t you dare say it again. I am sick of hearing it, why are you talking about them when we should be talking about us? I have had enough.’ With that she stomped off leaving an opened mouthed Ron Weasley in her wake.
.....
‘C’mon Harry.’
Harry smiled as he pushed open the portrait hole, perhaps he had been wrong about her.
‘Harry, Harry what’s happening? Is it a fight Harry? Are you ok Harry? Can I do anything for you Harry? Can I take your picture Harry?’ he asked turning his big blue eyes on the older boy.
Draco’s eyes widened as Harry spoke, telling him the story of Norbet and what they were planning on doing the following night... ‘but,’ Harry continued,’ Ron’s hurt and Hermione and I can’t carry him just the two of us so....’
‘Mmmm?’ Draco mumbled, too happy and content to form actual words.
......
Draco suddenly became very interested in his feet as hot tears sprang uncalled in to his eyes,
‘Thank goodness,’ she said. Noticing the smile on Harry’s face  she asked, ‘Good night?’
Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone and feeling nervous. Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.
There were hushed whispers all around The Great Hall as Percy and the other prefects plunged it in to darkness. ‘Do you think Black is still here?’ Hermione whispered from next to Harry’s head, Harry was in two minds about this, on one hand he wanted Sirius Black to still be in the castle, there was increased chance of seeing him, of letting him know that he knows he’s not the bad guy, of finding out what happened really, also there was a relief of knowing where Sirius was, that he was safe inside somewhere, however Sirius wasn’t really safe here, no one but him and his friends knew that he wasn’t the mass murderer they thought him to be.
‘Oh Hermione wait till I tell you.’ With that he ran to sit beside her on the comfy sofa in front of the fire that she had kept going. He proceeded to tell her what had happened, he had left out the secrets that they had shared but did let her know that Draco was aware that she knew. Hermione was shocked at this, nut with a small, knowing smile let the boy continue. Harry was just telling Hermione about the dog when he realised something,
'They were,' Harry sighed again, it was swiftly becoming his new habit, 'but there was an incident involving a cat and a rat today and now they aren't speaking, so on top of not being able to go to Hogsmeade I'm now stuck between my two best friends yet again.'
Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leant forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot towards Draco like a javelin. Draco just got out of the way in time but his eyes widened as the ball slipped from his grasp. He turned a frightened face towards Harry, who, after a second, dove after the ball. Draco gasped as Harry quickly gathered speed as he hurtled towards the ground. He held his breath, this was his fault but he couldn’t even move, he was glued to the spot watching the confusing boy speeding towards the ground. His eyes widen in fear as Harry almost reached the ground, just then he saw Harry catch the ball and roll safely on to the grass...
Draco arrived at the Trophy Room a little earlier than usual. His Potions exam was over but he had brought his Potions book with him to pass the time whilst he waited for Harry to arrive. Draco slid down in to his usual spot against the wall and started to leaf through his book, eventually and inevitably his thoughts drifted back to Harry and what had happened that morning.  He hadn’t been able to see Harry since their conversation behind the tapestry. Draco was lost in thought, he unconsciously brought his fingers up to his mouth and brushed them across his lips. Something was beginning to stir inside him, something strong, uncontrollable and very confusing, very, very confusing, but he liked it, Draco wanted it to continue. Almost a whole year later he was beginning to come to terms with always needing to be around Harry, recently, since the forest, Harry had been his last thought at night and his first thought in the morning. Draco knew he was young, he was only a couple of months from his thirteenth birthday, but Harry was younger, he wasn’t even twelve yet and at their age, well, that gap made a lot of difference. He wanted to be in Harry’s life, he just knew that he would have to settle for the innocent friendship that they have now. Draco had begun to realise , even at his young age, that Harry was special to him and that he wanted to keep him. As Harry grew up and came to his own realisations Draco would do everything in his power to make Harry turn to him.
‘Anyway,’ said Draco, turning his head to break the intense eye contact. ‘We should maybe try and figure out why my house elf was trying to stop you.....’
Harry thought for a moment , ‘You I think ‘Mione. Truth or Dare?’
‘I don’t I just know,’ Harry shouted back
‘Thanks Drake, that was bloody awful, it’s the worst it has been since the forest.’
‘Erm mate?’
‘Can you do Tuesdays?’
‘You know his name?’ Neville asked, confused.
Pansy awoke to the sound of Phoenix song, her eyes were blurry and her head was pounding, she had been flung to the side by the huge tail of the Basilisk and her head had smacked against a large rock causing her to momentarily lose consciousness. She'd worked hard, distracting the Basilisk for Harry, her assistance had allowed him enough space and time to drive the sword deeply into the creatures mouth, but, the last thing she had seen as her vision had gone blank, was the fang of the Basilisk sinking in to the boys arm.
Ron swallowed at the glint in Draco’s eye and felt truth was the safest way to go, he would not put it past Draco to dare him to throw himself out of a window and he was not sure how far Hermione’s rules extended regarding personal safety.
‘Ron will you shut up,’ snapped an extremely exasperated Hermione.
Harry blinked, ‘Erm does someone want to tell me what on earth is going on?’ Hermione sat up and wiped her eyes with the back of one of her hands . ‘Oh Harry, it’s amazing, you’ve found your song, I thought you’d missed it, but you’ve not, you’ve found it,’ Harry’s eyebrows rose at Hermione’s unusual ramblings, ‘Mione I love you but you need to explain to me what exactly it is you are going on about?’ In the blink of an eye, as though a switch had been flicked, Hermione was back to her usual studious mode. ‘Oh, I’m so sorry Harry , I totally forgot you’d have no idea, it’s not something people ever talk about really, it can be a touchy subject, it’s not considered polite really in case someone was missed, obviously being brought up by Muggles didn’t help the matter.’ Whilst Hermione had been talking she had been rummaging around in her ever present school bag, ‘ Here,’ she said removing one of the oldest and dustiest books Harry had ever seen and, being best friends with Hermione meant that he had seen more than his fair share of old, dusty books. Hermione flicked through the pages until she found what she was looking for, ‘Here,’ she repeated, passing him the tome, ‘read this.’ She tapped her finger on the page, pointing out the relevant passage. Harry looked at Ron who simply nodded, so Harry read:
years had been back at school for two months now and things had changed drastically for Draco. Over the summer he had connected with his Aunt Andromeda who had willingly invited him in to her home and he had stayed with her refusing to return to the Manor he had once called home. His Mother and Father struggled with the decision and once his Father had been hauled off to Azkaban his Mother had retired to the South of France and he had not seen her since. Draco’s life now revolved around the small child that was his cousin Teddy and he was fine with that, it worked, well it had until Teddy’s Godfather had come to visit and over weeks of stilted conversation and caring for Teddy Draco had fallen in love. Draco felt like he had been hit by the Knight Bus when he realised what the strange feeling building within him was. He had no idea he even liked boys and here he was watching Harry bloody Potter’s every move with wide eyes, he knew it was love because he couldn’t describe how he felt. Harry’s smile was the brightest thing that he had ever seen seemingly lighting up their surroundings at a moment’s notice, on more than one occasion Draco had had to stop himself reaching out and touching Harry, nothing sexual, just touching his arm or shoulder, any contact would have done. Draco had found himself doing anything to make Harry smile even if it required making a fool of himself, blowing raspberries on Teddy’s stomach or making animal noises for the infants entertainment, anything to see those brilliant green eyes light up, he really cared what Harry thought of him.
‘Did you?’
......
Neville huffed and rolled his eyes at Draco’s question and turned back to look at Harry, ‘What should I tell him?’
Draco took a moment to contemplate his Godfather, he knew the man well and was inclined to believe him, which left him with the worrying thought that there was some unknown entity trying to harm Harry; ‘be that as it may somebody tried to harm him and I intend to find out who and repay the favour in true Malfoy style, however that must wait until I know he is well. And as for my friendship with Harry, that will remain as it is.’ He stated staring coolly in to the eyes of his Godfather.
Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the changing rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they would ever see him alive again. This was not what you would call comforting.
‘Hmmm,’ repeated Hermione. Ron looked blankly from one to the other having no idea what was going on, shrugged and continued  on with his meal, Hermione rolled her eyes at him and continued with her own food.
Neville looked at Harry who simply nodded for him to continue,
Ron was in a bad temper. It had been two months since the morning he had walked in to the Great Hall to find Harry and Hermione schmoozing over breakfast. She annoyed him so much, what the hell did Harry see in her, he had watched the pair grow closer talking about the dog and all the exciting things she had found out. Ron also suspected they had a secret that he did not know about besides the dog. It was so infuriating, Harry was his friend and she was taking him away, stupid know- it – all.
All the students turned as one to look at their blond professor; he looked slightly uncomfortable, Harry answered the question, ‘He’s the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor who knows what is down ther, we might need him,’ at this, Draco scoffed and muttered under his breath’ As if.’  The words echoed around the otherwise silent bathroom;
It was Draco’s turn to cast his eyes down as he let go of Harry’s face.
Hermione looked up as the portrait swung open and Ron came scrambling through. She had known for a while that she was losing him, she’s wasn’t a hundred percent sure but thought that things changed in the Chamber, a life and death situation will certainly do that. She had watched both Ron and Pansy sneaking secret glances in class when they each thought that the other wasn’t looking and she could feel a sort of tension when they were both in the same room together. It was obvious they were falling hard for each other and attempting to supress it to spare her feelings. She’d been ignoring it, hoping she was imaging it, that it would go away if she didn’t look at it but yesterday, yesterday had put an end to that, she recalled with perfect clarity the look of sheer terror on Ron’s face as the hippogriff had begun to rear up at Pansy, she watched his split second decision to intervene, the steely look of determination sealing on his face and knew she had lost him. The worst of it was that she couldn’t hate either of them, they had tried so hard and were both lovely people, how could she?
‘I can take you if you don’t mind riding, It will be a lot faster.’
Harry sat back on his knees, still keeping a tight hold of Draco’s hand. He watched Draco intently as he replied, ‘Not a lot if I’m honest, I’d never even heard of him until this summer, but what I do know is that he is after me, he’s trying to kill me.’
“Father says I have to study,” he made a face.
Draco snorted. “Would you really call the aurors on Harry Potter?”
The sky was grey with dark angry clouds. The thunder made a loud noise, shaking the birds awake. On this loud evening Narcissa sat at the long table in Malfoy’s Manor dining room.
Draco looks away, self-conscious.
“I’m gonna be in Moscow for the next week,” Lucius announced at dinner.
The professor then ended class and Harry and Draco parted ways, both going to different classes. Walking to the hallways, Harry felt that strange stomach feeling again. He shrugged it off as he entered his classroom.
The students who were attacking Malfoy quickly left, leaving Harry alone with the blonde Slytherin on the floor.
“Stop it, Draco,” Narcissa interrupted him stricly.
‘You are too bloody noble for your own good, Harry.’
Little fists were pounding on her chest. Her face was wet by tears that weren’t her own. A kiss was pressed to her lips.
Completely missing potions, first hour. And all the classes after that.
Narcissa quickly grabbed the bottle, afraid he would poke himself in the eye with it.
Narcissa’s parents approved, so did Lucius’s.
I would have loved to see you again in real life but unfortunately I’m unable to at the moment.
“No, you were right on time,” Draco checked out Harry’s hair. “Did you do something with it?”
Narcissa had showed him the gift she got Draco. Fortunately Lucius hadn’t really cared about the dragon toy. He merely shrugged and moved on to rant about his business deals.
Lucius sighed and Narcissa took it as a yes.
“Hey ‘Mione, where is Ron?” he asked.
Another bang rumbled through the room. Draco pulled his knees closer to his chest, whimpering.
On his right, people are tanning. A few people attempted to make a sandcastle. Right before him, people are swimming. Everyone is having well-deserved fun. Harry grabs in his bag, looking for his waterbottle, when something caught his eye on the left. A blonde haired boy.
“Probably just a fangirl,” Neville chuckled.
She grabbed the dragon toy that came with the letter and held it close to her chest. Was she ever going to find true love? Or was she trapped forever?
Draco had make up everywhere. The eyeshadow was used all around his eyes. The lipstick was almost everywhere but his lips. The blush was overused, giving him a clown alike look. He was currently opening a bottle of mascara.
Harry’s heart stang at the sight before him. His boyfriend was curled up in the bed, a transfiguration book laying long forgotten somewhere at the side of the bed. He seemed to be asleep. But what really made Harry smile was the dragon held against the chest of the blonde.
Draco moved and lay his head on Narcissa’s shoulder. “I love you, mom.”
“Draco? Where are you honey?”
Draco felt his heart sting a little. ‘You are all homophobic?’
Lucius grabbed the cane and walked over to Draco. Narcissa was pushed aside. She knew what it meant. Interfering would only make it worser for Draco and for herself. She willed herself not to cry. She couldn’t. She had to stay strong for Draco.
‘Sweet merlin, he actually is gay!’
Harry grins, leaning back and enjoying the sun on his face. They keep silent for a minutes till he hears Draco calling his name.
“You got your ears pierced.”
Harry laughed. “Got me there.”
That gave her a glare from Lucius. “Of course not. It would simply be an embarrassment to take you two with me.”
‘If you want it to happen. Because I damn well want this to happen,’ Harry said, looking over at the flustered Slytherin.
“Dear Alexander,
Narcissa’s face darkened at the mention of the cruel man. “He doesn’t, nor will he ever know. He is in Azkaban forever sweetie. He won’t be able to hurt you about it,” she stroked her son’s soft hair lovingly.
“Euhh yeah, Hermione styled it. Do you ehmm.. like it?” Harry asked awkwardly.
“Yes, little dragon?”
Lucius stood up and glared at Draco. “Perhaps I know why. I asked you to study book eight, not seven!” Lucius balled his fists.
‘I don’t know! You probably just cast a wandless speed-running spell,’ Draco crosses his arms stubbornly.
Draco felt his eyes water, his breath increasing.
Draco started making his way towards the entrance of Hogwarts. Mother sent him a letter, asking him to meet him there today. He sighed, he had no idea what this would be about.
Bellatrix giggled. “Draco, are you looking forward to our crucio lessons?”
Harry looked concerned at his scared looking boyfriend. ‘Draco, clearly something is wrong, why don’t you tell me?’
Narcissa found him asleep at his desk. His head lay on a transfigurations book. Next to him lay an empty plate from the dinner the elves brought him.
Draco looked down ashamed. “Could you help me to the bathroom first?” He asked softly. He felt ashamed for not being able to go to the bathroom himself.
Unfortunately my son had a little accident with his toy. He is really sad about it. I was wondering if I can order him a new one? I’ll pay you double if you package it in a box meant for beauty products. It is a strange request but it is for good purposes.
Narcissa made her way upstairs to check on Draco. Since Lucius wasn’t home, Draco was allowed to play around like a normal child. He would go out to play in the garden or he would go drawing in his sketchbook. He also loved to play games with Narcissa whenever she could.
Narcissa sat in the dining room along with Lucius who just got home. He was supposed to be away all day but apparently he came back way earlier than expected.
Once back in his dorms he noticed Malfoy wasn’t back yet. ‘Must still be sleeping’ he thought. Shrugging, he went to sleep after doing some homework.
‘He is actually gonna cry.’
Narcissa hugged Draco close to her body. He was right in a way. Narcissa was always scared that one day Lucius would kill her. It would leave Draco alone in the hands of his father.
That made Harry receive a spat of cold water in his face. ‘Hey! What is that for?’ Harry says fake offended.
