"Ah Severus, my boy. Do come in. I've already heard that Harry and Draco are back in the hospital wing," Albus said as Severus entered the room.
"Stop Draco! Of course we'll look after them. They're my grandchildren, what a question," Severus indignantly hugged Lily to him.
"Do you like it?", Draco wanted to know. Harry looked out at the sea, on whose horizon the sun was slowly disappearing. He couldn't remember ever having seen anything more beautiful. He looked at Draco, who was standing next to him, his gaze also fixed on the distance. Harry smiled and, as if he sensed it, Draco turned his gaze to him. Immediately Harry blushed and hoped that it was not noticeable in the evening sun.
"They never wanted me, they did it out of fear of Dumbledore. But they also wanted to show me where my place was. They wanted to keep me away from the wizarding world. They ... ...they wanted to break me. I had to run the household from an early age and if I made mistakes, I was punished. I didn't get much to eat and I slept... slept on the floor in a cupboard."
"Something from honey dukes would be nice," Harry said a little uncertainly, but Draco nodded quickly.
"Really? Well, I wouldn't have expected anything else from Malfoy," Ron said extra loudly, but the Malfoy ignored him.
"Okay, then, sleep well," Hermione said, looking worriedly at Ron, who also looked sympathetically at Harry. He just nodded and disappeared into the sixth year boys' dormitory.
"It's not that, but my body ... well, you've seen the scars and my legs don't look much better," Harry said sadly. Draco stroked his cheek gently, then grabbed the hem of his friend's T-shirt, pulled it over his head and dropped it carelessly on the floor.
"Hey, at the end of the day, sex is something spontaneous and intuitive. You'll know what to do when the time comes."
"Potter, on time after all, which was not necessarily to be expected. Now sit down," Snape said snidely and pointed to the seat in front of which Harry was already standing. He put down his things and did as he was told.
"Dear ones, please remain calm. It is true what you have heard. Lord Voldemort is on his way here...", gasps and murmurs went through the rows of students.
"Nothing out of the ordinary, but he's getting weaker. The Horcruxes are nearly all destroyed and he's seething with rage."
"Really mean Uncle Sev. We're going to the south of France, we have a holiday home by the sea," Draco said.
"If you want, I can be part of it," he whispered. Harry lifted his hand and placed it on Draco's cheek.
"Oh, that. No I won't say anything, but I'm very happy for you. It was almost obvious that this potion didn't just create a bond, but only activated it, wasn't it?" asked Blaise and the other two stared at him in surprise.
Draco woke up to a noise that he couldn't quite place. He rubbed his eyes and looked at the floor. Harry was shaking all over, he could see that even in a few lights. The Gryffindor's teeth were chattering. Draco took a deep breath. He couldn't go on like this, after all, he didn't want to be to blame if Harry froze to death.
"Dray!" shouted Blaise, holding his friend by the arm. The latter turned around and saw Harry lying on the floor, immediately he ran back.
"You'll sleep in bed tonight, the couch is too small for you. I'll take care of the potion, don't go to sleep too late," was all Severus said.
"Hey, I see what you're thinking, and don't. Bellatrix means nothing to me. She'd kill me without batting an eyelid, and I'd kill her if she even got too close to you," the Slytherin said, kissing Harry one more time. Harry nodded and then smiled, shaking his head.
"W-what ... no ... Harry," the Gryffindor felt his friend's hand on his back and he turned to look into the other's moist eyes.
"No, I ... I would like to take him to me, but I don't think my 'little' problem will allow it," Remus said bitterly.
"I think there's only one option if we don't want them to get more damaged," Severus said, and you could sense he was uncomfortable.
"Very well, so I'm sorry, but the animals are very shy and they don't come to everyone," Hagrid now explained.
"No ... it's a soul bond, you know what that's like, you can't just undo it," Severus said, visibly irritated.
"It will find its way. It will weaken him so much anyway that he won't put up much of a fight," Remus said.
"Don't do that," Ron said gently and pulled Hermione's hand towards him. The young woman always bit her lips when she was nervous and it didn't do them much good.
"Nothing, just that for the first time since I've known you, you see him differently. Not as James Potter's son, but as Harry," Remus said. Severus didn't say anything, just nodded.
"Um ... quite okay, I think," Harry said and sat up. The pain had almost disappeared, he only felt weak. Draco was sitting in bed next to him, looking at him with the same concern as the healer.
"Well, nobody's saying you shouldn't learn something too," he murmured and kissed his way down Harry's chest. Already he could hardly lie still and arched his back towards Draco. Draco smiled and licked the length of his friend once before he lowered his lips completely over Harry's erection. Harry could no longer think straight and clawed at the sheets.
"Drink, it's not poison," Snape said dismissively and Harry did as he was told. The potion tasted sweet and he suddenly felt light, before he could say anything else he slumped down and rolled onto his side. Breathing calmly, he fell asleep.
"I thought it was a good idea to get them to stop bashing each other's heads in, and it worked. They are now one heart and soul," the teacher defended himself.
"Because you're an adult and he's a boy who's already had to fight his whole life for the same thing."
"Wait a minute. Remus? Remus Lupin? Why him of all people?", Lucius wanted to know. Embarrassed, Severus scratched his head.
"Mr Malfoy, stop that at once!" shouted Snape and Draco raised his arms defensively. Severus rolled his eyes and turned back to the class while Harry and Draco grinned at each other.
"But don't worry about it. It's all right," it was true, he had actually slept quite well next to Draco and without nightmares for the first time in a long time.
"Good, and as for this bond, we'll find a solution. But you seem to be getting on quite well now, don't you?", Harry and Draco nodded. It was a kind of silent agreement between them not to tell Dumbledore for the time being that they were getting on more than well by now.
"Do you really think Sev will find a solution?" she asked now. They had hardly slept, fear for Draco and also for young Potter, had kept them awake. They both suspected that Draco found the other more than interesting and they certainly didn't want their son to be unhappy, but how were they going to help him now?
"Cissa, I know and it tears me up too. I would give my life for Draco and also for Harry, but it wouldn't do any good. I don't know where we go from here, but ... but we must at least give them the last few days... weeks whatever as nice and pleasant as possible. It sounds cruel now, and it is, but it's all we can do," Severus concluded, lowering his eyes. He felt Narcissa's trembling hand on his cheek and looked up again.
“We all have a gay side, don’t you worry. Do you know Oliver Queen?” he said as he pulled away. He put an arm around Draco’s shoulder and guided him back into the room, making Draco burst out laughing at the mention of the Green Arrow as Barry’s secret man crush.
Draco woke up the next day, feeling just as tense as when he tried to fall asleep two hours ago. If it wouldn’t have been for the alarm he set for every day of the week, he would still be lying in his bed, tossing and turning around in his restless sleep. He had to get up for work though. He didn’t want to miss work after he managed to never come too late, or not show up at all, in almost ten years.
“It was repulsive, really. I know I walked around with pride about my family. Showing everyone how goddamn proud I was to be a Malfoy and a Slytherin. But- That was Hogwarts. Back home after the school year and I was a wreck and couldn’t wait to hop onto Hogwarts Express to go to school. I refused to cross paths with my father when walking around my own home after he found out I was gay. “Maintain the bloodline” and “disgrace for the whole family” were the only words he had left for me.” He paused, taking a deep breath and closing his eyes for a moment. Harry was sure that Malfoy was close to tears.
However, that left Draco to himself and he had some free time to think about the feelings Potter once again awoke inside of him. He wasn’t unaffected with the way Potter treated him like he never did anything bad and Draco couldn’t forget how attentive he’s been the night before. He listened, not faking his interest and will to help. He could still hear the echoes of their laughs mixed together when they shook hands after eighteen years in his head. He wished he could get used to that sound one day. He wanted to see the man smile and wrinkle his eyes for the rest of his life.
Despite always wishing Harry would be gay and reciprocate his feelings one day, in that moment he prayed that it wasn’t the case. He knew how much a coming out meant to LGBT people, and he was now a person who possibly outed someone else.
In moments like these, where the team felt like the family he never had but always wanted, he felt even more horrible. He shook the thoughts away for once, focusing on the then and there. That place, the room of S.T.A.R Labs he was standing in, surrounded by the best people he had ever met, made him feel like he finally found his home.
“Never thought I would see the day you’re here early,” he made himself noticeable and smirked as Barry turned around to face him.
He could understand their worries, they trusted the wrong people before and didn’t want history to repeat itself. But he also tried to keep a secret that could change everything for him.
He got back up, pushed everything on the table off and proceeded to destroy his belongings. Belongings that represented a person he would never be. A normal, less confused and hurt person that never went through the things that he had to go through as a kid.
“If you’re here to tell me that I should leave the city and hide from them, then you’re delusional, Potter.”
“Alright,” he answered when the taxi stopped in front of Oliver’s place. Draco made a quick process of paying him and they waited for the others who arrived ten minutes later.
Cisco still hadn’t found the courage to comment, just giving him something that seemed like a supportive smile and nod. But Draco couldn’t care less in the state he was in. He could be himself. He felt genuinely happy for the first time in a long, long time. He found himself a home.
“I mean he does have a point,” H.R. defended Draco while he played with his drumsticks in the meantime and sipped on a drink from Jitters.
By the time his alarm ringed, he was already sitting on his bed fully dressed and ready to go. He walked down the hall, following the noise that came from outside his room and shortly afterwards he saw Potter in front of the stove, cooking something that smelled like bacon.
I don’t feel too sure about this chapter, so please, feel free to give me honest feedback in the comments!
Everyone from Team Flash burst out laughing at the way he said it, Oliver just formed an “Oh” with his mouth and smiled.
“I’m not even going to try and ask how you found out, Julian. Follow me,” he said and covered his face with his hand for a second, obviously knowing that this was all Barry’s fault and Barry’s fault only.
He showered and brushed his teeth absentmindedly, too tired and not fully working after only two hours of sleep. He got rid of the clothes he could smell some of the whiskey on and got dressed in clothes that he got out of the washing machine.
“Well, hello to you too,” Draco sassed and rolled his eyes dramatically. All Harry focused on was that exact moment. The comment, the eye roll. It looked familiar. It made him look so much younger, like he was back at being a fourteen year old.
“If you think I’m here to tell you everything about my school life and the people in my life in the past, then you’re definitely wrong.”
They stepped back into the room where the rest of the team waited for them. Draco stayed calm and spoke quietly:
By the time he arrived at the department, Barry was already there. He sat on his desk and looked through paperwork.
“No, he can’t,” Harry said, taking Draco’s side for what was probably the first time ever, while Draco was still desperately trying to find a good excuse. He had to admit that he wouldn’t believe a word coming out of his mouth either. But then, suddenly, he felt like he had an idea that was smart enough to work.
He knew he said that to himself, but he was angry at himself for thinking something like that. And he was angry at his father for forcing him to become the person he was. An emotional, bitter wreck that wasn’t able to control itself.
“I don’t know, Cisco. I haven’t seen him in- in ten years, maybe?” he snapped unintentionally and acted clueless. He knew exactly that he hadn’t seen him in ten years and a bit over two months. But showing his friends that he knew the exact amount of years and months would give too much away.
He put his bookmark between the pages and put it on the coffee table in front of the couch. Looking up, Malfoy came to a halt a few feet away. He was rubbing his neck and gestured for Harry to move a bit to make room for him on the couch.
He didn’t know when it happened, when he fell in love with the raven haired boy with the scar in the shape of a lighting on his forehead. But it did and he couldn’t stop himself from liking the feeling of being in love. Of course Draco’s father had to ruin it, working with Voldemort and being the reason he threatened his family so Draco was willing to help him. When the war was finally over, he couldn’t look anyone, but mostly Potter, in the eye anymore and left as soon as he could.
And from this day, he kind of just belonged to the team. They would always come to him to seek for help when in need, and after a month passed, he was an important member of Team Flash. He got along better with Barry so they wouldn’t create any more awkwardness and uncomfortableness.
He hadn’t started yet, when a beeping alarm drew away his attention from his paperwork. He instantly recognized it as the meta alarm app sound. With the blink of an eye, Barry was gone, leaving the papers flying around for Draco to pick up and take care of. Just the usual Tuesday, Draco thought and got back to work.
“I became an Auror after school and training. The head auror sent me to look for you because I need to warn you. There are some loyal death eaters out there trying to find you. We’re not sure what they want, but people reported that they asked around in diagon alley.”
After all the confessions he made last night, he still didn’t know Harry’s sexuality. They talked about Draco and everything else, but Harry never mentioned anything like that.
But the war changed him to the better. It felt like he saw the world through entirely different eyes once he realized the consequences of his actions. And he also realized what person he never wanted to become: Lucius Malfoy.
It didn’t hurt him to leave. The only thing that made him feel like he was dying from the inside was leaving the boy he was in love with behind. Potter.
Sure, he still didn’t make any new friends, but he was convinced he wouldn’t need them anyway. Until he found out about Barry Allen being The Flash. Central City’s superhero. Seriously, was there anything that wouldn’t make him hate that man more?
No surprise they get tricked all the time, Draco thought, almost rolling his eyes but knowing better than that.
“We went to school together but lost contact over the years. He left England after school and moved to the USA. Simple as that,” Potter answered and behaved unaffected by the whole situation by shrugging his shoulders.
“I didn’t see that. His hair was in the way. He asked if I know where “Draco Malfoy” is, though. Took me twenty minutes to tell him that I don’t know Draco after he said he works with me. We’re still trying to find out his name, but no success so far.” Barry remained calm, not getting the reason why Draco shifted anxiously from one foot to the other. “Do you know him?” he continued, eyeing him warily.
Draco suppressed a sigh of relief when he looked at him, the same shining green eyes, the same raven hair, the same glasses that always made him look good in his own, unique way. He didn’t change all too much, but he looked more mature, grown up. All the weight Draco carried on his shoulder over the past ten years seemed to lift and he tried not to show the happiness he felt tingling in every part of his body. A wave of excitement rushed through him, the worries about missing Potter and everything else long forgotten.
Next thing he remembered, they were at Draco’s place and he showed Potter around. His guest room wasn’t anything too special, just a simple king sized bed with nightstands on each side and a closet on the opposite wall. The walls were painted in a light blue tone that fit the pillows and blankets and made the room a little brighter compared to the dark blue curtains. Draco never expected to have someone over anyway so he held it as simple as possible.
His mouth dropped open in horror. Barry and the rest of the Scooby gang were the last people he expected to turn up on his doormat. They smiled at him, but the concern was written all over their faces. Draco backed away, making them room to step in. As soon as they didn’t see him, he wiped the tears on his face away.
“Hello?” he called out, well aware that shouting Hello? never ended with a good scenario but what was there to be scared of? He was a wizard, one snap of his fingers and he was back in his apartment without them noticing.
“Right, because I’m not as eloquent as my teenage self and cut walking with a stick up my ass, I’m pretending to be someone I’m not? I don’t think you’re aware of the person I really am. But how could you? We made each other’s lives hell, I never gave away my true self, like here,” he said and pointed at his chest, the spot where his heart was. “If you want to enlighten yourself on my personality, you might as well go visit Pansy. Her psychological expertise is going to give you a whole encyclopedia of Draco Malfoy, the broken boy!” he yelled and stomped away, needing space to take some deep breaths.
“Harry, you want to join us?” Cisco asked. Draco smiled, he knew this was Cisco’s way of saying sorry and making up for his actions.
“Potter, what are you doing here?” he whispered although the other ones were out of reach to hear anything.
“By the way, Oliver told me that we should come over for dinner later,” were Barry’s words and Draco couldn’t stop himself but wink at Barry, making him remember what he said earlier. A blush crept onto his cheeks and they turned a light shape of red. Only Draco noticed though, the rest being completely oblivious to the teasing from Draco that was going on.
“I’m- I’m not unhappy.” Draco shrugged his shoulders, signaling Harry that it wasn’t a big deal for him.
A wide smile crossed Draco’s face and he rolled his eyes playfully. He offered his hand for a handshake.
“I don’t know. How could I make them understand why I did what I did without telling them why I did it?” he reasoned, hoping his words made any sense.
“What?” Draco asked. Although, deep down, he would never trust Potter to do something like that, horror reflected in his eyes for a few seconds.
“Wait, so you really are working with the Muggle police? My, my, Malfoy, never knew you secretly liked the Muggles.”
“Can I ask you something?” Harry blurted out and regretted it the next second. He didn’t want to destroy the playful banter. The last two days were going better than the last eighteen years.
Draco was about to burst out laughing but controlled himself and grabbed his jacket, not asking any questions like Cisco insisted.
“Actually, I don’t know all too much about your childhood and the relationship with your parents ante-war,” was all he replied, not wanting to say too much so soon.
“Cisco, what the hell?” Barry yelled, not a tiny bit amused by the bullshit going on right in front of him.
“Is it too gay if I hug you?” Draco breathed out a laugh and pulled Barry into a tight hug when he laughed and shook his head.
“Next time you use super speed, do it while wearing a suit. Oh, another good advice for you: Don’t let your co-worker see it.”
“I went to school with him.” That was not the full truth, but it wasn’t a lie either. He did go to school with Potter. “Back in England,” he added.
“I know it’s not hard for you to understand the misery I felt back when I used to live with my parents. I know you went through quite the shit yourself in your own home. To be completely honest, I’m still jealous. I mean, you made it out there without doing all the things I’ve done,” he said timidly, looking down at his feet covered in green Slytherin socks. Harry had to restrain a smile noticing them.
“Your friends seem nice,” was the only response from the dark haired man walking beside him, his voice dripping with more sarcasm than he ever heard coming out of Potter’s mouth.
“I don’t know if it’s that hard to understand, really. I obviously didn’t want anyone to find me. Not some death eaters, not Pansy, and especially not you,” he said and fell into his old habit of going into offense mode when it came to Potter.
“What? No, they’re smart but not smart enough for this kind of thing. They know everything about science, computers and metas. I’m pretty sure believing in meta humans is their limit, tell them what you are and they’ll put you in a straitjacket and throw you into a padded cell without thinking twice about it.”
“Julian, don’t worry. You don’t need to talk about it. We’re actually here because of something entirely different,” Barry stated.
He sat down, leg wiggling up and down, a kind of lunatic look in the grey eyes he pinned to the wall on the other side of the room. Harry didn't know if he should stop the ordeal that the white blond man in front of him obviously went through by speaking up or if staying quiet and waiting patiently was the better way to deal with him. He decided on the latter, giving him the time he needs to find his words.
He had one big realization that day: Yes, he had to go through some things on his own, but being gay was not a part of them. Not when he had the best friends. And most importantly not when he had Potter by his side.
“Malfoy, it’s just breakfast. Relax a bit, it’s not like I want your soul in exchange or something.” A soft giggle escaped his mouth at the frown on Draco’s face. “Come on, just eat and shut that big mouth of yours,” he said emphatically this time.
“Someone like me? Excuse me, but I just warned your sorry ass,” Harry bit back through gritted teeth.
Barry was the one patting a shoulder this time, smiling the famous Barry Allen smile with his perfect teeth.
The next day, Draco found himself walking to S.T.A.R Labs to meet up with the team. It was his only work free day in the week, but he still spent it working with the others. He brushed past all kinds of people on their way somewhere as he was deep in thought, furrowing his eyebrows. Harry had to go back to the ministry that day to give them a detailed report about everything that happened the past days and if there was anything suspicious going on in Central City that might indicate death eaters were present.
Six months passed fast and they couldn’t believe they were already friends for that long without killing each other, but they managed it somehow. They caught metas and other criminals together and Draco started to feel more bad each day that passed by. He was lying to them. Well, not directly lying. But he also didn’t tell them the truth. He wasn’t Julian Albert. He was Draco Malfoy, a wizard from England who visited Hogwarts, a school just for wizards and witches.
Draco visibly tended at the question, but he trusted Potter enough to know that he won’t tell his secret. That he would come up with a good excuse, something Draco totally forgot to come up with when he told Harry what he was supposed to say.
Harry was surprised at the honest answer. He couldn’t remember a single conversation between the two of them where they talked like they didn’t hate each other. He enjoyed being around Malfoy like this. Still, he told himself not to get used to it all too quick.
So instead of sitting back down, he stopped in the doorframe. He cleared his throat to get everyone’s attention. He contemplated the words best to use, secretly wishing Harry would be there for it, reassuring him by a tight squeeze of his shoulder like before. Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined to need the quirky Potter.
A relieved chuckle escaped him as he nodded his head. And then he realized he finally had someone to talk about his inner conflict with falling for Harry Potter.
“Thank you. For telling me, I mean. But I’d appreciate it if you could leave me alone now. I don’t want to come across as rude right now, but please. I’ll see you tomorrow, eh?” he said and forced a smile.
Draco watched him with narrowed eyes but didn’t say anything and devoted his attention back to the food on the table in front of him. He sat down on one of the wooden chairs.
“How the hell did you get in here?” a rather small guy with long, dark hair asked. Draco recognized him as Cisco, the guy who helped the police to catch metas by constructing high technology weapons. He looked sincerely surprised and confused at the sight of Draco standing in the middle of the big entrance hall.
“There are a lot of things about me that you don’t know and that you’d never believe me,” Draco copied his words from earlier, his lips curling up into a smug grin.
He cleared his throat, indicating that he was about to say something. He wanted to get this over with, so he opened his mouth and started to explain himself with a monotone voice:
“There are a lot of things about me that you don’t know and that you’d never believe me,” Harry said and smiled cheekily. Draco just rolled his eyes at the guy walking next to him. He was next to him. It felt surreal to Draco who still couldn’t quite make out how Potter tracked him down and just Apparated himself a few feet away from him. Ten years later, like nothing happened and nothing changed over the years. Like he was still the ten year old boy breaking every single rule that Hogwarts had ever made to find out the truth about all the mysteries surrounding the big castle and save the students from the big, dark monsters out there.
“I’m gay!” Draco yelled into his face, smiling brighter than a little child opening presents on Christmas.
Was this the moment everything would go downwards? How was he supposed to save this? The facts were obvious. He could lie, but Cisco would find something somewhere that didn't match the other lies. He would find a hole and catch Draco repeatedly lying to his friends. They would never trust him after that.
“So, how are we going to do this? You got a good plan once in your life or are you just going to, I don’t know, stick to my ass and follow me the whole time?” Draco changed the topic and continued skewing his food with the silverware fork in his hand.
“And for your information, I stopped disliking you the day you saved me from Voldemort, ignoring how dangerous it could’ve been for you and your parents,” he admitted, not daring to look at the man in front of him as he felt a light blush creeping onto his cheeks.
Draco had no idea what to do, if he would be honest to them and tell them every single detail, they might understand why he did what he had to do. On the other side, he wasn’t allowed to. Muggles aren’t supposed to know about magic.
“And you couldn’t try to be doing fine back in England?” he asked and Draco swore that he heard something like sadness in his voice.
Harry laughed softly, sounding convincing enough to everyone else. Draco was the only one in the room who knew that it wasn’t what his laugh sounded like. His real laugh was warm, contagious and made Draco’s stomach erupt in butterflies. Often enough he has heard it echoing in the stone old walls of the hallways at Hogwarts. And more than just a couple of things had he wished that, one day, he would be the reason for his beautiful laugh.
But then again, only Barry Allen was stupid enough to expose himself in a police station without checking if other people were in the room.
His look landed on Caitlin, who looked somewhat disappointed but mouthed the words “I’m proud of you” with the typical small Caitlin smile. Draco didn’t think about the obvious disappointment for too long, as he was pulled into an embrace from behind, his back pressed against a chest, by H.R. whom he hadn’t even noticed standing behind him the whole time.
Draco understood. Harry was acting like it’s an embarrassing school story no one was supposed to know about or something similar like that.
It wasn’t like Draco felt uncomfortable in the company of Harry, it was the complete opposite, really, but he didn’t know how to act around him either. What do you say to a person you kind of bullied from day one to the day you parted ways? He treated him badly until the very end, the only good thing he ever did to him was acting like he doesn’t know whether it’s Harry Potter or not in front of Voldemort. He was also a horrible person towards his best friends Weasley and Granger, making snarky comments about him being poor and her being a mud- a Muggle born.
He came to a halt and walked into the building, knowing the way blindfolded by now. His friends greeted him like any other day before Harry showed up out of nowhere, except for Cisco, who slouched deeper into his chair, refusing to look up at him.
Draco could hear Potter gulp next to him and his tense body signaled him that he was more than uncomfortable. Only then he realized that he told Barry and Cisco that he met Potter at a re-education camp for gay boys. Draco didn’t know whether Harry was gay or not, but if he was, then he just made the biggest mistake of his life. He might’ve outed him. He always kind of sensed gay vibes radiating off Harry but he never actually had the conviction that it was true.
He lay his hand on his shoulder and gave it a tight squeeze, showing his supportive and caring nature to encourage Draco. But he was also swallowed up by guilt at the same time. Draco never deserved all the insults the golden trio called him behind his back. He was just a another teenager with problems he bottled up deep inside of him.
“I’m proud of you, you know?” He continued when he saw Draco’s unconvinced look. “Malfoy, I’m serious. Look where you are today. You can be yourself! And you opened up to someone.”
Draco’s stress levels were over the roof, he had abruptly decided to take the offer Harry made earlier. But sitting there, his eyes on him as he tried to find a conversation starter, he felt his throat going dry and getting uncomfortably tight.
Seconds passed in which Draco held his breath, tensely waiting for a person to arrive, until it happened.
“When I turned eighteen, I felt ecstatic. I knew the moment I’d have to step over the threshold of my own house that everything was going to change. My father would’ve given me commands of how I would have to live my life from that day forward. So I-“
“Damn, is this a bad moment? Feels like I could cut the tension with a knife. Oop, don’t worry, I don’t carry knives around with me,” H.R. said and smiled like the oblivious person he was. He tried to ease the tension. Sadly, he didn’t have any success.
But he didn’t care, his father was in the past. And what’s in the past stays in the past. Except for one special person who has always been close to Draco’s heart: Harry Potter.
“He just called on your home phone. Didn’t know you have one of them- Never mind, he wants us to come over because “don’t ask any questions, it’s important”,” he said, quoting Cisco with the pointer finger only.
Any other time Draco would’ve found him hot like that, all heated and trying to stay calm instead of fighting with him. But this was a serious matter. The truth was, Draco didn’t intend to offend Potter, but he got it the wrong way. What he meant was: If a wizard found him with his normal magic, how short will it take the death eaters to find him with all kinds of dark magic?
The mean boy developed into a matured grown up man during the time he lived in Central City. He had a lot of time by himself to think about all the mistakes he ever made in his early life. And in his opinion, considering he was only a child back then, there were way too many mistakes. He was convinced most of the things he did would never be forgiven.
Also, the rich text option of ao3 isn’t working, which is why I wasn’t able to put some of their thoughts into italian font!
“The bad side of you wasn’t what defined you! Who are you, Malfoy? The Draco I know wasn’t like this. In fact, he talked completely different, with words I’d need a thesaurus for. He walked elegantly. Proud and chin up, remember?”
“Okay, stop. I will tell you.” He hesitated, was he going to make Harry hate him again with the words he planned to say? He hated this. He hated the lies and the drama. He blinded people with his lies, and for what? So that he could start over? So that he could build himself a new, good life that consists of messing up the lives of the people around him with his chaos?
“That’s the Potter I know. We wouldn’t want it any different, huh?” he tried to reassure him, telling him it’s no big deal, they could still come up with something, after all.
By the time he arrived at S.T.A.R Labs and made his way through the big building, they were already waiting for him. H.R. and Joe were also there, an expecting look written in their facial expression as they saw him coming in.
“Honestly, I never hated, or as you say, disliked you. I was just moping about you not shaking my hand. But don’t let anyone know, I have a reputation to lose,” Malfoy said and caused a laugh to bubble out of the man next to him.
“Well, thanks, I guess.” He still hesitated. “How do I know I won’t drop dead the second I swallow this?”
He stopped dead in his tracks when he heard a knock on the door that led into his apartment. He snapped out of his anger and his thoughts and  approached the door, opening it without looking through the peephole.
“No, you don’t!” Draco said and raised his voice, pointing a finger at them. “This is my private life and if anyone here has a right to do something, then that’s me being allowed to have stuff that I don’t tell. Which means you don’t go and try to find everything you possibly can, which I, for a fact, know you did. What would you do if I just research about every details of your life and discuss them with the whole team?”
Damnit, he thought, having unreciprocated feelings again. And of all things it’s the same man. He was an utter fool for throwing himself into that hell twice in his life. He wasn’t interested in anyone since he lived in Central City even though there have been some guys who tried getting in his pants.
Draco quirked his eyebrow. “I do. Though, how are you going to protect me from the big bad boys out there from your hotel room?”
Draco’s head turned into his direction, and only then Harry was able to take in his presence for the first time. He looked rough, hair disheveled and dark shadow-like bags under his grey eyes.
Consent with being around the other, they had conversations about all kinds of things that happened in the last ten years, catching up with each other up until the ungodly hours.
“Morning?” Draco said, but it came out as a question. He smiled and watched Harry flinch through not fully open eyes. Harry, who stared at him with wide eyes didn’t hear him entering the kitchen, but soon calmed down and put eggs and bacon on Draco’s plate.
Draco left the room, giving Potter some space to settle in and walked into the kitchen. After a few minutes he got two tea cups out of his cupboard, put teabags in each one and poured hot water into them. He waited for the raven haired man to join him and gave him one of the cups. None of them said a word until they were done drinking, not knowing what to do then.
If he ignored the fact that he just couldn’t stand the nerdy guy at work, he actually found himself to quite like the job and his new life. If you compared his old life with his new one, there weren’t too many differences. Central City, something that would sound like a normal city somewhere in America to everyone from England, was full of meta-humans.
Harry was about to finish the chapter of the book when the sound of a door handle being pushed down and soft steps making their way in his direction startled him out of his concentration.
“I’m probably not the first one saying this, but I’m proud of you, Malfoy,” he whispered only for Draco to hear. “And I’m glad you’re smiling a sincere smile. These people are good for you.”
“Uh-huh,” was Draco’s only response as he slowly brought the fork up to his mouth. He chewed for a while and finally swallowed the delicious meal.
Next thing he knew was that he ended up in a much smaller room with computers and more Muggle technology and scientific tools. Then, right there in a little niche of the wall, was the shining red suit of Central City’s most loved meta.
And then, they simultaneously burst out laughing, easing up the mood in the room like the handshake was the greatest thing to grace the earth.
All of a sudden, he was at the verge of tears. He hadn’t thought about Pansy in a long time, everything about her hurting too much. She was the one he could trust and tell everything to and he just dumped their friendship to escape everything. He felt the urge to just disappear from Central City and go back, but disappearing again meant disappointing the people he got to know here. He wouldn’t make that mistake twice.
“As far as I’m concerned, you guys are the most accepting and supportive people,” he started, giving Barry a quick smile who reciprocated it and gave him two thumbs up. The rest eyeing the two suspiciously. Cisco shifted in his chair uncomfortably, fearing the words Draco was about to say. “And Barry told me it would be okay to tell you as soon as I’m ready, which I am. I’m-“ He took a deep breath. “I’m gay.”
But somehow, Draco made up his mind. Barry was right and their little talk gave him a boost of confidence and courage he hadn’t felt since first to sixth school year.
“Did you see if he had a scar on his forehead? Right over his right eye?” Draco asked in a hurry and almost choked on his own spit.
“What the actual fuck,” Draco said more to himself than to Potter. “If someone like you managed to find me, then they will be able to do the same.”
“Okay, so. I started to dig a little further and-“ he paused when Draco scoffed loud enough to drown out his own voice. He gave him a questioning look, making the blond man in front of him angrier by the second.
It felt ridiculous and unbelievable that he was never able to get over his love sickness around the raven haired man with the glasses that still made him look absolutely adorable like back in school.
He could try as much as he wanted, his thoughts always drifted back into that direction, making him lose control of everything he always did to stop the memories and the pain that came with them.
“You know, you should start letting people in. Think about it, there are things you don’t have to go through alone. And, uh- I mean, if you decide to do it, just know that I won’t be far.” That being said, he went into his own room, grabbing one of his books out of his suitcase to go back into the living room and read.
“You two better start talking. The truth this time, may I add,” was the first thing Cisco said when they walked in.
"Where were you that you had to run so fast to get here? Bloody hell Harry get your snake under control before I hex it into next week! We were worried sick, you can't just up and get sorted out of our house and then disappear for FOUR HOURS you git!" Even Ron looked a bit frightened of Hermione at this point, it was one thing to yell at Harry but a highly venomous snake that could kill you in ten seconds flat? That was a new level of brave and it startled everyone in the common room.
Soon conversation began to shift to Hermione and Ron. Harry knew that they had decided that they didn't want to date after the war but he had no idea just how much they had moved on from each other. Lavender had matured a surprising amount and she was no longer disgustingly clingy, she had decided to work as a robe designer and she was going to apprentice at Madam Malkin's during her last year at Hogwarts. Ron had asked her out on a whim when he saw her over summer break and grew to love the new person she was. Harry was not surprised by Hermione's new found fondness of Fred. She had never been very in love with Ron because he was a bit dull for her but Fred had always been clever and unpredictable and exciting. They had started dating a couple of weeks ago but Hermione was blown away by his spontaneousness.
"Eloquent as always Potter, although my reasons for my appearance are none of your business." His words had an edge to them but something in his eyes made Harry think that he wasn't trying to be rude, just not quite used to sharing personal details with other people yet. Not that Harry had done anything to deserve that, they had been rivals for seven years after all.
"Hey Malfoy, I'm so sorry I forgot to give this back to you before but uh, here's your wand." Malfoy looked at him and for a second Harry thought he looked like he was going to cry but instead he just grabbed the wand from Harry's hand and gave him a grateful nod and that's all that was said the whole way to Transfiguration.
Harry had missed it but he was so distracted in that moment to notice the look Malfoy had on his face when he heard Harry was in his house. No one could be sure but it looked like hope, which was a very good look on him. Harry was not however too distracted to notice the hexes that flew at him when Sidereum had reared up and he was very grateful for the protective charms he had cast beforehand. He strutted over to the Slytherin table with the biggest grin on his face and feeling like he was finally where he was supposed to be the whole time. He sat down next to Malfoy, not really knowing of anyone else who wouldn't hex him on sight and shot an apologetic look at Ron and Hermione. They seemed a bit dissappointed they wouldn't be in the same house anymore but they also looked happy for Harry.
"Oh that's wonderful Harry! I didn't think that you had a plan but I think that will make you happy, I really hope Mcgonagall lets you apply. I mean you definately have more than the necessary qualifications for it-" Lavender had gone a bit too far with that, she still viewed Harry as the savior and fawned over him but bringing up the war even vaguely make gave Harry a breakdown.
"All the eighth years are automatically invited! Invite whoever you bloody well like as long as none of them kill my buzz." Everyone had heard of how amazing Blaise's parties were but no one outside of Slytherin had been invited until now, inter-house unity or something like that I guess.
"I see you have a new friend there Harry, and I'm rather glad that this rare opportunity has presented itself to me. I'm going to put you where I always thought you belonged. Slytherin!"
"O- Okay I guess." Just like that Malfoy was gone and Harry was left processing what could have led Malfoy to actually be nice to him.
" Harry heard Draco mumble under his breath and nearly got up and snogged the living daylights out of him right then. He settled for a plan that would at least thoroughly embarrass the ferret instead though. He decided to exact his revenge during Professor Binns' class. After Transfiguration he decided to ask around about Malfoy's mumbling and see if anyone else had picked up on it. Turns out, all of them had known and had been teasing Draco for it for months.
"To you, it's Potter. As well as anyone else who judges another person based on past actions they were not only forced into under duress and obviously regret." Both Malfoy and Jared were dumbstruck by Harry's defensiveness. "I probably would have done the same thing for my family if they weren't all dead." That earned a gasp and look of shock from Jared and Harry grabbed his newly whittled wand and let Sidereum climb up on his shoulders and then he stormed out of the room calling after Malfoy to follow him.
"Fine, tell the house elves to just make my usual, they don't like making coffee for the whole Great Hall but they like me for some reason so they make it for me. You'll probably have to swing by the kitchens for it though." Malfoy was about to leave the room when Harry called his name again.
Harry slowly guided his broom down to the ground while looking at the cheering crowd around him. It was always the highlight of any year when he heard the yelling and screaming that were there because of he had caught the snitch. There also seemed to be something else they were cheering for though. Harry looked up to the stands and there was a giant magically projected jumbo-tron displaying the words 'Kiss Cam' on it. It was showing a live stream of Luna and Ginny who had sat next to each other in the Ravenclaw section. Ginny went pale as a ghost but Luna didn't hesitate to lean over and plant a kiss on her. They broke apart after a couple of seconds and Ginny was smiling so wide Harry could have sworn her face would split in half. Harry touched down a few seconds later and was immediately greeted by a very enthusiastic Hermione and Draco.
"Of course I can, I'm not doing this just for a place to sit in a classroom genius, I'm doing this because I can and I'd like it if we were friends, well maybe not friends if that's too soon but at least civil people who occasionally keep one another company." Harry hoped that just maybe, Draco would like to be friends with Harry too, he hadn't even known that he'd wanted to be friends until he said it out loud but now he realized that even if Draco wouldn't be friends with him, maybe they could at least not keep trying to ruin each other's lives every other day.
He rolled his eyes but complied with the demands anyway and he broke into a run. If he wanted to make it back to the dorms he was going to have to run pretty quickly, he thought about summoning his broom but was a bit afraid he might accidentally summon his entire trunk with it. He burst through the portrait hole gasping in air and barely having made Hermione's deadline only to be greeted by his two best friends yelling at him.
Jared had joined the Ravenclaw team in his third year but he hadn't been promoted to seeker until this year when Cho quit. Harry had previously been excited to play against a new seeker, they had pretty much stayed the same all throughout his Hogwarts career but after this morning's fiasco, he was more anxious to just utterly embarass him in his first game.
His face was beet red and Harry started preparing for the beating of his life when suddenly he was snapped out of his state by his uncle's face turned from rage to shock and he watched him stumble out of the room with a look of pure terror on his face. Harry albeit very confused, was extremely grateful that he had managed to escape a beating.
"That's quite enough Harry I don't need to know about your fantasies I just need you to come to class with me."
"Merlin Potter how do you remember all of this? There's so many steps to everything and you just have to remember it all." The two wizards had been studying in the library for two hours and Harry hadn't realized just how difficult transfiguration was for Draco until now.
Headmaster Mcgonagall apparated directly into the Dursley home which startled Vernon out of his original ranting. However it did not take long for him to start yelling at the strange new wizard. Minerva walked right past him up to Harry's bedroom anyway, worried for Harry's life because there had been a magical explosion that originated from his house. Mcgonagall had feared the worst, that a new dark wizard had replaced Voldemort's power vacuum or that he had come back from the dead again to finish him off. She did not however expect to discover the only First Degree familiar bond in the last 800 years.
"Whatever Harry, have fun with your revenge, but I don't want to be involve this time I'm just going to take notes or something." Ron, take notes?! Probably not, he'll probably just fall asleep three minutes in.
He decided to actually shower and get changed into his school robes but Malfoy still wasn't back so he figured it would be a good time to start carving himself a paperweight for a wand. He conjured a knife and started widdling, it didn't look quite the same as his real wand but that was probably just because he was used to looking at it more often than anything else. The only other people who would be able to tell it wasn't his wand were Ron and Hermione and they already knew he wouldn't be permitted to use his wand in glasses. He was just about done when who he assumed was the Ravenclaw he would be rooming with walked in.
He cast a notice me not and barreled through the platform once again. He immediately pulled Sidereum out of his trunk to stop his complaining and let the snake get situated while he scanned the crowd for his friends. It didn't take to long to stop Ron's fiery red hair and he started walking over to them. There seemed to be a lot more stares than usual which was saying something so Harry suggested they should get a compartment. They all hurried onto the train and got a compartment at the back so they didn't have to deal with staring people walking past them. They just sat for a while enjoying having company but not really wanting to talk, it wasn't until the train started up that someone said something.
"I'm pretty set on working on new products with the twins, I really enjoy them as company and they're quite clever with their ideas." Hermione's face always lit up when she got to talk about her future especially one with Fred.
They all went on like that for a while, meaningless quips and tidbits of information Hermione had dug up on Harry's bond and possible new abilities and side effects.
"Nothing to fret about Golden Boy you don't owe me anything." With that, Draco turned back to Pansy and Blaise.
"Draco you do know that there are recollection spells you can use right?" There was concern on his face as well as a bit of awe that Draco had managed to remember every incantation and wand movement up until now without any help from memory spells.
"Harry, you know that I obviously can't stop you but you really should be paying attention in class instead of plotting your revenge for something Malfoy probably doesn't even realise he's doing" Hermione was trying to convince him but had already resigned to defeat, knowing just how stubborn Harry could be.
He had been deep in thought and hadn't seen the sun rising and didn't realize he was late until Malfoy shrieked.
Draco shivered, shaking the thoughts out of his head. The past is in the past, he needed to remind himself again. He had no intention to go down that path. All the memories and feelings, he didn’t want them. Remembering and reliving his feelings for Harry Potter wouldn’t do him any good. It was hard, but he had to accept it. There was nothing he could do but to just suck it up and live with it.
His friends weren’t convinced, but they decided to leave him on his own anyway. If he wanted to be alone, there’s nothing they can do to help him. And Cisco was still convinced that there was more to the story than “Julian” told them. They closed the door and left Draco with all his questions and doubts behind.
“And how exactly do you know Julian?” Joe unashamedly continued cross-examining. Being a detective, it was what he’s best at. Finding out the truth and all that.
“You don’t realize it, do you? You’re developing into someone you’re not and you don’t even notice, or maybe you don’t care enough to notice, but this person in front of me is not Draco Malfoy!” Harry yelled.
“I know who the dark haired man was, yeah. But honestly, I’ve never heard the name Draco Malfoy in my whole life,” he lied and tried his best not to look as guilty as he felt because he once again fed them a lie.
Draco didn’t say anything to that, he only squeezed him tighter until he pulled away because he feared he might break Harry’s glasses.
It turned out that Muggles weren’t what his father made them out to be. They weren’t as strong as wizards with magical powers, yes, but they were also interesting. Coming from a completely different world and never seeing something else than only that world, he was fascinated by the way life works on the other side of the two kinds of humans. Most of them didn’t believe in magic, and they weren’t able to use it, but they still found ways to go through their daily lives. They had their problems, too.
Draco pondered for a bit. He considered them his friends, but could he really call them true friends when they didn’t even know who he truly was? Would they still call him friend if they were to ever find out? And even telling them his real name would mean he’s still keeping up a façade. He wasn’t Julian Albert. And he most certainly wasn’t a Muggle. He could pretend all he wanted, nothing was able to change who he really was.
“After all this time, you still don’t trust me. And then you’re asking me why I’m not telling you anything about my life.”
He hurried out of his apartment so he wouldn’t be too late and began thinking about everything they talked about the last ten minutes. He tried his best to shake the thoughts out of his head, but no success whatsoever.
They told them, Draco thought and scoffed. Was there anything they could keep to themselves or did that rule only matter when it came to their private business?
Draco got up without saying a word, having a clue what this will be about. He knew their ways by now. If there was a problem that needed to be solved, they ran after you in the hallway or drag you into it. Which, unsurprisingly, was exactly what Allen did.
“Just wait until you meet Oliver Queen,” Draco said, smiling at the lack of knowledge coming from someone who grew up in the Muggle world.
Draco looked up from the little sofa in the corner of the room and Harry gave him a reassuring smile.
“You and fun pretty much equals Seamus Finnigan and his wand. You don’t mix them together,” Draco teased. “Now, let’s go back to the others. If they ask: You’re able to breach because you’ve been in Central City when the particle accelerator explosion happened. Dark Matter hit you. And you know me because we went to the same school in England. Got that?”
“I was at the laboratory earlier and all of a sudden this guy showed up out of nowhere. I think he’s able to breach. He looked kinda out of it. Dark hair, glasses and a cloak- What a weird suit for a meta,” he explained and strayed from the topic mid sentence.
“Look, guys,” he said, still searching for a good enough explanation for the situation he was in. He didn’t want them to know that he was indeed vulnerable like any other human being, after all, the nonchalant attitude that Draco always had defined him. He wasn’t one to talk about stuff going on in his head. He wanted to get rid of the nervousness and the people that showed up at his place without sending a text. He felt like a big and the most important part of his privacy has been invaded by them seeing this. It was like they looked into his soul by only seeing his living room in this condition: Thrown around, stained and broken into many, many pieces.
"It means that at the moment we don't know how to separate you and until we do, you two have to stay together. A soul bond is something very rare and we don't yet understand how it happened. But the most important thing right now is one thing, that none of the students realise how serious it really is," Severus said urgently.
"What's wrong?", Draco looked over his cereal at Harry, who was absently poking at his scrambled eggs.
"Thank you Salazar, I'll be right there. These are your friends," he said, addressing Draco and Harry. The two young men nodded gloomily.
"I-I don't know exactly, it seems I have some of her memories too. It came over me suddenly when the plate fell to the floor earlier," Harry explained calmly, sat down at the table and started his homework.
"Dray ... I-I can't ... I can't take it anymore," he moaned and immediately he came between their sweaty bodies, only seconds later Draco followed him screaming loudly and immediately it was as if hot water was flowing through both of their bodies. They were bathed in a bright white light, which immediately disappeared. Breathing heavily, they lay on top of each other, unable to speak or move. At some point Draco managed to clean them up with a spell, after lying down next to Harry and pulling him into his arms. Only moments later, they had both fallen into a deep sleep.
"I'm fine," it was true, the pain was not pleasant, but Harry was used to much worse. Suddenly he felt Draco take his hand. At first he wanted to protest and pull it away, but immediately the pain subsided, becoming only slight and barely noticeable. Draco smiled wanly when he saw Harry's completely stunned face.
"Yeah, come on let's get something to eat and well ... enjoy the time, sort of," Draco said, standing up and holding out his hand to Harry. Harry nodded and let his friend pull him out of the room.
"If I ... if we're dead, don't cry for us, all right? I know we haven't had a long life and I know how unfair it is to leave you alone, but don't cry. You must go on and you must help Severus and Remus, not to despair, you must help the many orphans, will you do that for us?" he wanted to know and his voice broke too. Harry came to him, knelt beside him at the feet of the woman he barely knew and nodded. Narcissa looked at the two young men, who were still almost children, and her tears ran without stopping, but at some point she put a hand on each of their cheeks and nodded.
"What on Merlin are you doing?" he wanted to know and stepped up to him. Harry was about to defend himself when the mixture began to bubble violently and then everything went black.
"Harry must die for the war to end. He has made so many sacrifices, fought his whole life and yet lost. He is only sixteen and we are dying next to his boyfriend. I just don't know what to do. I miss you so much. Sirius ... Sirius you know how much I loved you, so much that now I feel guilty because Severus asked me out for a drink. Can you believe that? Severus Snape and I, but ... with Merlin I really like him and he suffers similarly to me. Without him... I don't know if I can go on living if Harry ...," Remus sobbed out and went to his knees. Crying, he buried his face in his hands when suddenly a light breeze came up and gently stroked his hair. He looked up and right before his eyes a single white feather landed on the grave. Remus hadn't seen or heard a bird. With trembling fingers he reached out and gently stroked the feather, then he took a deep breath, stood up and nodded.
"Well, who would have thought that. Don't get me wrong, you've had a crush on him for a while, I know that, but I didn't think it would happen so quickly," Blaise said.
"Well I too have done a lot of research and what Draco told you is the truth. We still don't know what exactly the potion did. Perhaps your soul bond was always there and the potion merely 'activated' it," Severus explained.
The Order seemed to have done a good job, because there were no more students in the corridors. As McGonagall and Severus hurried down the stairs, groups of students led by Order members kept coming out of the corridors. They all seemed scared and confused, but there was no panic. Severus and Minerva ran outside the great gate and from a distance they could see the dark mark rising in the distance. The other teachers were already standing outside the castle. Minerva looked at Severus and nodded determinedly.
"Yes, they are ... well, a couple, if you can call it that. After Mr. Potter's suicide attempt, they confessed their feelings to each other," Severus explained.
"Now listen carefully Potter. Firstly, we don't know if it will really do any good if you sacrifice yourself, because I might be dead too. Yesterday the burning lasted longer and was more painful than the day before. Secondly, we're not going to screw up our lives. Otherwise we'll just do this bonding thing and then..."
It was not yet curfew and so Harry and Draco could not hold hands, too many stares followed them. They tried to walk as close to each other as possible, but the pain was still present. When they reached the hospital wing, three Hufflepuffs were sitting on the beds, seemingly cooling burns. Madame Pomfrey looked at Severus and then at the boys and pointed with her head in the direction of a separate room. Snape nodded and pushed Harry and Draco through a door.
Remus Lupin had his hands buried in his coat pockets. Summer was slowly saying goodbye and already autumn could be felt approaching. The streets he walked through were empty despite the morning. The place lay quiet and seemed peaceful, even if the times were anything but peaceful. The old iron gate squeaked as he stepped through and now stood in the small cemetery. He looked around, but again he was apparently the only one. Remus walked along the narrow path with graves lined up on either side. Almost at the end he found the grave with the light-coloured headstone. Sighing, he made a lily appear and laid it down.
"Well I'd still like to join you," he said, making a small packet appear in his hand, which he placed with the others.
"I realised something right there..." he said and without warning Harry felt Draco's soft lips on his. They tasted slightly salty and were the best thing he had ever tasted. All too quickly, Draco broke the kiss again.
"Shh ... It's all right. I'm sorry," Draco said, kissing Harry's chest. He curled his fingers and the Gryffindor groaned.
"Mhm ... I don't know, they were kind of weird, but can you imagine? They weren't exactly friends in their school days," Harry said.
"Shh ... relax," he murmured. Harry took a deep breath and the pain disappeared, he only felt Draco, his hands everywhere, his smell - only Draco. The latter sensed that Harry was relaxing and penetrated him completely. The feeling was hard to describe, he had never felt more aroused and so loved at the same time. He paused and gave Harry time to get used to the feeling, and it took all his control not to thrust immediately.
"HE IS DEAD!", now the Death Eaters began to move. Most of them disappeared immediately. Others didn't seem to know what to do. Bellatrix approached Draco, who immediately threw himself protectively over Harry.
"You'll manage," he said and turned back to the potion. The hour passed quickly and Harry had to hurry to get to 'Care of Magical Creatures'. He grabbed his things, walked to the exit and as if by chance Draco's hand brushed him as he also reached for his things. Harry thought he saw the other smile briefly, but when he looked again, there was only the Slytherin's expressionless face again. Harry straightened his shoulders and ran outside. In the fresh air, he took a deep breath and tried to sort out his feelings. How could he already miss the other's closeness so much? How could everything have changed so much in just a few days? Harry vigorously wiped a tear from the corner of his eye and ran down to Hagrid's hut. The half giant seemed genuinely glad to see the Gryffindor back in class. They ran to the edge of the forest and then fed the Bowtruckle before getting busy with kneazles that day. At the end, they took care of the skrewts again. Lost in thought, Harry cut the meat and threw it to the animals.
"I'm bunking with you apparently, and by the way Malfoy, you shriek louder than anyone I have ever heard." He didn't turn to Malfoy to respond and he'd kept his voice in a deadpan but there was a hint of a smile at the thought of having the normalcy of their rivalry back. "Anyway, I've just realized it's morning and we're probably late for breakfast so I think I'm going to head down to the Great Hall and grab some coffee or something."
"Finally Ronald, now that were all here and it's lunchtime how about some food while we interrogate our best friend about his odd new... wait what is it's name?"
"You're going downstairs like that? I always knew you were a slob Potter but this is a new level of sloppiness even for you."
"Oh gods! I am so so late for practice and then we have the game I have to leave for Quidditch like now. I am so sorry Malfoy I do promise to teach you that spell though, uh I will be here tomorrow after dinner to help, show up if you can! I'll see you in the common room later tonight." With that, Harry bolted out of the library and down to the Quidditch field for the warm up drills he was supposed to be leading.
He laughed when Draco popped into his head, 'Draco' he thinks ' a bloody snake shows up in my room and my brain compares it to my childhood rival'. He slightly relaxed at this but didn't have much time to process what the snake had said before he curled in on himself at the sound of Vernon Dursley's footsteps marching up to his room to investigate what all the racket was about. Harry hadn't remembered to warn his uncle about his odd new friend before his uncle could make it through the door.
"Harry, the few times you have gotten that drunk, you started bawling like a baby and having panic attacks every three seconds because 'how are you supposed to protect teddy from the tigers he thought were under his bed, tigers are scary' the next time, you started singing karaoke and Ron had to drag you off the stage so we could all go home, after that you woke up in our house and you thought you had broken in and while still very drunk because you were only asleep for like five minutes you tried to APPARATE HOME and you and your dumb arse splinched yourself, after that-"
