“Yes actually.”
“Draco!” Justin nudges Draco with his arm and Draco pulls his gaze from Harry. Potter. He needs to call him Potter in public.
“Who uses a spell without knowing what it does?” Draco looks up again.
Draco looks into the new floor-length mirror he has placed in Pansy’s guest bedroom. He pulls on the cuffs of his new muggle suit. It’s dark blue and suits his complexion perfectly, and the white shirt he wears under it is unbuttoned at the top. Showing of his neck. He’s also wearing new dragon hide shoes, they were probably way too expensive. He paid double his salary for them. Thank Merlin, he has an enormous family vault. He checks on his hair one more time, before heading down to the kitchen.
And even though Dan’s in Draco’s space and trying very hard to keep his attention, Draco’s eyes keep trailing back to Potter. Who’s having a normal conversation with Michael. His hands around a cold glass and it makes Draco want to know that body like it’s his own. He certainly has filled out since Hogwarts. Gone is the scrawny little boy from Draco’s childhood, it’s been replaced with a broad shouldered, muscular man. His eyes are still the same sparkling green as from young Draco’s dreams and fantasies. But his old thick rimmed glasses have been replaced with a thinner model, though it’s still a round shape. It suits him. He still got that boyish look that Draco likes in a man.
“Fine whatever! I’m just grabbing my coat.”
Their lunch arrives they start talking more about their jobs and the expectation. When Harry leaves a couple of hours later he feels strangely satisfied and he can't put his finger on it.
Harry leans in close and whispers in Draco’s ear, his breath ghosting his neck and ear. “We could dare Neville to snog Hannah. He’s had a crush on her since forever, you know?” Oh, Draco knows what that’s like.
“That’s mostly just been Ron though.” Harry says,  “That’s why he’s so tan all of a sudden. Though in the beginning he could only turn lobster red.” Ron is tan now, but still not quite close to Harry’s natural dark skin.
Ronald flushes bright red, much to Blaise’s delight.
“So who’s doing your job in Romania now?” Malfoy asks curiously.
Theo slides on the bench at the Slytherin table next to Blaise. “Still pining I see.”
“Yes, it is.” The waitress is back at their table and hands Draco the wine list with a smirk. “Tonight’s chef’s special is a roasted duck breast with a blackberry and wine sauce and a salad and roasted potatoes on the side.”
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Blaise says sweetly, “Check mate.”
Draco throws him a dark look but leans down. He can’t believe he’s doing this. In front of his entire year. That Harry lets him do it.
Ronald sticks his tongue in Blaise’s direction, “So what do you really want for a bet?”
“Salazar Potter!” Draco looks up startled, “Why did you have to scare me like that?”
“What are you talking about? You two were here all the time.”
"It's written all over your puppy dog face."
“Harry, why in Circe’s name would we go to America?”
“Okay not the worst.” Harry says and Draco looks triumphant, “But one of the worst without Voldemort's involvement.” Harry can't help but chuckle when Draco frowns.
Harry tips Draco’s chin up, “Is that so?” Harry leans in close, “Lover.”
They’ve been talking for a long time and the restaurant is almost empty when they get up to leave. Harry pays, but Draco makes sure to leave a big tip for the sweet waitress. Who smiles and waves at them when they leave?
The weasel glances at Theo and Theo looks back uncomfortable at the couch.
As he walks away, he wonders if it’s normal to say that you have to attend to best man duties. And he mostly wonders why this conversation with Maurice rattled him so much. It’s not like it should matter to him if Maurice and Draco have had a relationship. That does not mean they’re in a relationship right now. And even if they are, why would that matter to Harry? it’s not like he and – It’s not like he is jealous. Jealous of Draco. Draco being able to have a relationship next to his busy work schedule? Or just Draco having a relationship? No that can’t be it. Harry shakes his head as if that will clear it. He needs to have a drink. And maybe take Ron up on his offer to introduce him to the bloke that works in diagon near George’s shop. Maybe that will make him less jealous of other people’s relationships.
"Every time I have a chance with Ronald, Potter shows up and demands all his attention. whining about some blond git."
“What kind of game?”
Draco laughs, “And what is it that my spectacular sexual performance grants such a delivery for.”
Ron smacks Harry’s arm as  the girls laugh.
Once in their dorm, Potter spins around, “Why do you want to play quidditch with me? You’ve been glaring at me all year.”
Draco hears Harry coming down the stairs, back from the bathroom. As soon as he steps into the kitchen, Draco throws the paper at him. “What is this?” He sneers.
“Good, you were so hard to ignore anyway.” Harry says trailing a hand over his chest. And leans in for another kiss. After a short snogging session, Draco pulls away and steps from Harry’s lap.
“Why Romania?” Malfoy asks before Harry gets a change to speak.
Draco turns around to put on the cattle, his hands are shaking, and his breathing is ragged. They haven’t fought like this since Hogwarts. And Draco didn’t mean to let it escalate to this extend. The article just rattled him more than he expected it would.
Potter finally looks at Draco.
“Well actually,” Hermione steps closer, “I guess I can tell you guys now, since you are back and maybe you can even give me some advice Ron.”
As soon as they’re outside Harry warps his arms around Draco’s waist and apperates, taking them home. They land in the middle of their bedroom.
Michael looks from Draco to Harry and back again. “We hated each other at school,” Draco explains. “We haven’t seen each other since school. So 7 years?” Harry nods. “I honestly don’t know if we don’t hate each other still.”
Blaise looks confused, “I heard he was dating the Weasley girl again.”
“Draco?”
“Shut it, Nott.” Blaise grits out.
“I need to talk to him.”
“Maybe you should let Draco Malfoy pick out your clothes too, babe.” Avery says glancing at Ron.
“What are you on about woman.”
“Yes.”
“How daft are you Potter? What do you think is in all these bags?”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draco groans against Harry’s neck.
“I need you to look through all of them and send me the ones who bought ingredients from Greece.”
“So, winning from you in chess is all that tipped you off?”
“That’s not even true and you know it.” Harry interrupts him, he’s clearly angry now. Draco knows that it isn’t true, but he’s not going to admit that.
“Don’t worry about it,” Harry sits down next to him. “Just go to sleep.”
“Let’s go then.”
“What?!  No! Then I won’t have anything to wear.”
“I don't have an account at Dominique's.”
“A what now?”
While Blaise hasn’t been able to keep his mind of off Weasley since Halloween, Draco in his turn hasn’t been able to keep his mind of off Potter. Well, maybe since ever. But it took a turn for the worse after Halloween. Potter had been dressed in tight pants and a fitted shirt with buttons undone at the top. Draco really hadn’t known what he was dressed at, but he couldn’t stop staring. And unlike Blaise, Draco knows that Potter has been single since before Halloween. Which did even worse things for his thoughts, both during the day or at night.
you care Harry? You broke up with him.” Dan sneers.
“I feel ridiculous.” Harry looks down at his green shirt and tight black trousers.
Harry follows Malfoy out of Robards office down the auror office to the lifts. “Want to grab lunch?” Malfoy asks casually not looking at Harry.
“Don’t even start you’ve been infatuated with Potter since you were 4.”
Seeing Draco with Dan stirred feelings in Harry he’s been trying to push down ever since he walked away from Draco. Love. He’s in love with Draco. He wants to be with
“Make me.”
When he came back down, what he hoped would be a quiet night in turned into their biggest fight.
“Harry?” Draco whispers as he pulls him along through dim lighted hallways.
“Yes, you are. We were writing letter all summer and then when we came to Hogwarts you stopped.”
“It’s just a kiss.”’
“Well, I was thinking I could help you with that particular problem.”
“You like that P- Harry?” Draco fumbles with Harry trousers, he pushes his pants to the side and wraps his fingers around Harry’s cock. Harry gasps in Draco’s ear, and moans something that sounds like Draco’s name.
“Now you know how we feel.” Greg says.
“Then why did Master forget that Kreacher was here?  Was Master distracted by the young mister Malfoy.”
“Cause I’m so going to beat you.”
“Really? You’re not playing with me, are you?”
“Where are you going?” Granger asks, and at this particular time Draco is glad for her inquisitiveness, because he’d like to know too. Though he’d probably go anywhere with Harry right now. “To our dorm.” Harry shrugs. He opens the door and pulls Draco along out onto the hallway.
“Come on Ron!” Harry yells up the stairs, “We’re going to miss our portkey if we don’t floo to Hermione now.”
constantly. Isn’t he Theo?”
Blaise nudges Theo out of the couch.
“They were, but he saved one especially for you.” A man Harry doesn't know says, as he steps next to Draco and places one of his hands on the small of Draco’s back. Harry glances from the hand to Draco's flushed face, back to the hand, to the intruder. “Maurice Blau,” He introduces himself and extends his hand to Harry. Harry takes his hand and shakes it, maybe a bit rougher than he should have, but he can't seem to care. “Harry Potter.” He introduces himself.
“Right, you want to go out with Weasley.”
“Yeah?”
“Mind!? Not at all. I would love to?” harry says. A brilliant smile breaks on Luna’s face.
“That’s only because you-”
Draco tangles his fingers in Potter’s hair. And Potter grabs Draco’s hips pushing them against himself. One of Potter’s hands sneak around Draco’s hips and cups Draco’s bum.  Draco gasps and Potter pulls him even closer. They’re both hard now and their erections rub against each other’s thighs.
“Hey!” Greg pokes pansy in her feet, “You’re always the one who falls asleep first.”
“We were about 8 or 9,” Greg continues, while wrapping an arm around his girlfriend’s waist as she laughs hysterically on his shoulder. “Draco dressed up in one of his mother’s dresses because Vince and I refused to. He had drawn a lightning scar on Vince’s face and the I proceeded to marry Draco Lucius Black Potter to his true love of his life, Harry Potter.”
. Harry is not going to start seeing the ferret.” Ron says
“I told you I would be.”
That morning Harry woke up with a sleeping Draco pressed against his side. When Harry stirred, Draco woke up and started pressing kisses all over Harry’s chest. They had spent at least an hour in bed before getting out and ready for work. There was no time for breakfast, they were already late. Harry had thought about saying it then; “I love you.” He should have, but he didn’t. He pushed Draco against the kitchen counter and kissed him deeply, before rushing off to the Ministry. And
Harry’s face breaks into a bright smile and wraps his arms around Draco’s neck pulling him close. He kisses him deeply, slowly and Draco savours the moment. “Now about the rest.” Harry starts.
Pansy and the Patil twins find places in the circle as Lavender slowly glances around the room, looking for a victim. “Hermione!”
When the common room door opens the happy couple at least stops kissing. Pansy turns around in Greg’s lap, her back pressed flush against his chest.
Saturday morning Theo sets up in the library. He and Blaise have decided to both flirt with their part of the ‘Golden couple’ as Blaise calls them. Though Theo isn’t sure they’re a golden couple, shouldn’t a golden couple fit together perfectly? Nevertheless, Theo’s here now, waiting for Hermione to show up so he can try and flirt with her. Theo’s never been a good flirter, but he’s confident he can try it with Hermione, the way he feels can’t just be one sided.
Theo falls in step next to him as he makes his way to the great hall. "How's it going with the ginger?"
14th of June
“I need to get out.”
“I can’t,” Draco leans over the table, his face close to Michael’s, “it’s a secret.”
“Yes!” Draco says a bit too fast as he jumps out of the chair.
Draco’s heart pounds in his chest.
“How long have you been here?”
“I think there is more for me here than back in Germany.” Maurice glances over his shoulder and Harry’s grip tightens around the stem of his glass. “Does your family live here or something?” Harry asks.
“Draco. It’s 10 PM. Have you seriously been here for 8 hours?”
“Yeah, well. I’m not.” Harry grabs Draco’s arm and pulls him close before apparating away.
“Are you done?” Hermione asks smiling.
“And why the fuck did you fuck me before you decided to pack up and leave me sleeping, naked might I add, in our bed. Knowing.
Within no time Harry has Draco a moaning mess beneath him. He’s slick with Harry’s saliva and open from his fingers. Maybe Harry should go away for a week more often if this are the consequences, Draco thinks to himself.
Draco lingers in the middle of the room, suddenly awkward. “Well, I must get going.”
“When I have time off I’m coming over and throwing them away.”
Draco snorts, “He’s at the party he and his girlfriend are throwing.”
“When?” Ronald looks up grinning, “Cocky much.”
Blaise and Theo start hollering and Greg snickers too.
Potter uses Draco’s new interest in the topic as an excuse to push him back on the bench and slide in after him. His arm leans casual on the railing behind Draco.
Harry looks up at his friend and Ron smirks at him, pointing at the double doors.
Theo holds on to Draco’s arm when he tries to get away, “Oh, no. you’re not going anywhere.”
Blaise can’t help but grin as he stands up. Ronald takes the hand Blaise lends him. He pulls him up and their chests bump into each other. Blaise curls his hand around Ronald’s neck, the top of his finger tangle in the red strands of hair. He wets his lips with his tongue and sees Ronald’s eyes follow the movement.
“I did, I asked you for your floo address.”
Draco looks up wondering where Dan has gone, but glad non the less that he stopped forcing himself on Draco.
“But it’s raining.” Pansy continues.
Malfoy stands up, “Thank you for your time sir.”
When they parted, on the pavement outside of the lunchroom, she kissed his cheek and said that he should really think about what she had said. That Ron and her parents would love it if he agreed. Ron and her parents that what she said. Not herself. The entire lunch she didn’t mention once that she loved him or wanted to be with him. Not even that she liked him as anything more than a friend. No, she only said that she was ready for a serious relationship.
“Yes I-”
He pushes himself out of bed and moves to his wardrobe, he grabs a pair of pants, trousers and a shirt. He forgoes socks and shoes when he hears something clattering in the kitchen. Draco takes two steps at a time as he runs down the stairs. He halts in the doorway, when he spots Harry in a pair of Draco’s boxers cooking something in his new kitchen. A kitchen Draco has never used before, but now Harry Potter is making breakfast for two there. “You’re still here?” Draco blurts.
Draco can’t stop the smile that spreads on his face.
“Yes, you do. I made it when we went there to buy you clothes for Theo and Millie´s wedding.”
Harry laughs “Of course she did. But thid time it was true. You really didn't know?”
Shouldn’t you get changed then?” Blaise says smirking.
“Merlin that’s hot.”
“Strip. Take off your clothes. Don’t worry you can keep on your pants.” Blaise glances at Draco, “for now.”
“The golden Dragon.” Harry says with a little flinch, and Draco opens his mouth to find out how in Salazar´s name Harry managed to get a table at
“That’s not true.” Pansy says, “Draco is still desperately single. But I guess he’s a hopeless case, I don’t think he’s ever had a relationship that lasted longer than a night. Well except for the pretend one with me back at Hogwarts, back before he was prepared to let everyone know he’s as bent as they get.”
Blaise brushes his lips against Ronald’s, over his cheek to his ear. “I won our little bet.” He presses a soft kiss behind his ear before pulling away completely.
“I’m, I’m still not sure.”
“Maybe you should talk to Harry. trying to work something out. Like closure or something?”
“It’s barely been used.” Blaise summons his chess set and places on the small table on the opposite of the room near the fire.
stupid. She didn’t even pass any N.EW.T.S.”
“You know that it doesn’t work like that, right Draco.” Pansy says seriously.
As if on que Hermione steps into the library, with Weasley moping behind her. Hermione smiles broadly when she spots Theo. He smiles back, his heart stuttering fast and hard against his ribs. He clears some of his parchments of his table, hoping she might sit down with him. Even though Weasley´s with her. But Weasley glares at him and asks Hermione to go somewhere a bit more private. He says it loud enough so that Theo and the 5
“So you became an auror?”
Draco finished his sandwich when he heard footsteps behind him. If Macabity was checking up on him again, Draco would throw his empty tea mug at her face. He knows the aurors don’t truly trust him, but surely it isn´t necessary to make her check up on him every hour. He had told her so not half an hour ago. The footsteps sounded heavier, not at all like Macabity´s kitten heels. Maybe they had sent someone else. Draco had maybe been a bit too rude to her after all.
“No yesterday we played quidditch with all the eight years.” Draco says.
“What?”
Malfoy snorts, “Of course not Potter. Unless you want the prophet and all your fans to fall all over you.”
Harry stops in front of a red door. “Ah, here we are.” He holds out his hand and automatically Draco takes it and follows Harry into a small hallway. He closes the door behind him before Harry pulls open another one and leads Draco into a small but cosy restaurant. It’s quite full and Draco wonders if there’s even a table for them.
“Nice to meet you.” Harry holds out his hand, “My name is Harry.”
Draco bites his bottom lip and nods. When Harry doesn’t say anything but just stares at the parchment in his hands Draco breaks the silence, “Do you like it? I also got you this,” Draco grabs the picture frame from the kitchen counter, “I wanted to frame it for you before I saw you, but you got here earlier than I expected. So, I didn’t get the change. I, err I thought you’d be out with Weasley and Longbottom tonight. Not that I’m not glad to see you I just, I thought I’d have time to-”
“Oh, come off it Malfoy. I’ve forgiven you.” Harry says with a bright smile. Draco stares at Potter, trying to come up with a response, but all the reasonable thoughts leave his mind. He just gapes at Potter, unable to close his mouth.
Weasley laughs, “Well then I think I should get a chance to see if seeing your boyfriend in quidditch gear really is the best thing about quidditch.”
“Yes, like that.” Draco gasps and tilts his head back against the door. And Harry nips on the sensitive skin on his neck, while rubbing their hips together and his fingers work hastily on the buttons of Draco’s shirt. Once he finished the buttons of his shirt Harry pulls Draco from the door and shoves it off.
“Distracted? No! No, I wasn't distracted. I was just-?”
Draco jumps up and the chair he´d been sitting on promptly falls to the ground. He closes the little distance between them and presses his lips onto Harry´s. Harry chuckles against his lips before wrapping his arms around Draco and deepening their kiss.
“What was that?”
Hermione´s pressed against Theo’s side, they’re going over their history of magic notes, listening to the rain clattering on the windows.  The common room is empty, most of the eight years are playing a friendly quidditch game or looking on.
“You only say that because you like sucking cock.” Pansy says.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Being the best delivery service money can buy.” He smirks at Draco. “Well maybe not money, but sex. Spectacular sex.”
“Speaking of?” Draco hears Theo says softly to himself.
Inside the box is a birthday cake. “Happy birthday Draco” spell the letters on the cake and the candles circling the cake light up.
“Seamus?” Man, this is painfully awkward.
“You can say that.” Harry rolls his eyes, “I hope she’ll leave me alone now.”
“Then what do you want? Why do you keep bringing up Ronald?”
“Then why were you laughing?” Avery asks suspiciously.
“Greg. Don’t. you. Dare.” Draco grits out.
Blaise shrugs, “There’s a reason I’m at all your games.”
“Well I was going to take a good look soak in my bathtub to try and erase all the knots in my muscles.” Draco says glancing at Harry from under his lashes.
Harry stiffens. He finishes pouring the tea and walks up to Draco. Placing a cup in front of him.
“You have fascinated me ever since the first time I laid eyes on you. I knew that I would, one day, make you mine.”
She gave a soft laugh. “It’s not too bad. I can handle it. It’ll feel better once you start moving.”
Harry already wanted to know more, but he was willing to wait. He hoped he would get to learn more through practical application with her. “So, how am I supposed to know where to touch you?” Harry felt her shuffling around before her voice sounded a little further away. He realized that she had turned her back him.
Harry tried to ignore the tingling sensation that he felt right where Draco’s lips had been. He hesitantly wrapped an arm around Draco who sighed happily and snuggled closer. Maybe it didn’t really matter whether Draco was a man or a woman. He did have a way of making Harry feel happy.
Draco headed over to Harry whose eyes sparkled when he saw him. Draco leaned down to kiss Harry gently. “You ready? I have to get up early to meet a potential client.”
“It’s not for lack of trying,” Harry griped. “I’ve been on plenty of dates. Either I don’t hear from them after they learn that I’m not as wealthy as I used to be, or they send an owl with a lame excuse for why they can’t see me, anymore. Is there something wrong with me, you think?”
“I think whoever is sending you the vouchers is sending you a message, Harry,” Hermione said.
Harry’s uneasiness increased at the thought of getting more scraps of parchment. What did this person want? He put it out of his mind to focus on his education and training. He began to think Hermione was right, though. Each month, he received a new voucher, and he was given a new scrap of parchment when he used it. Each word only increased his anxiety. While his job went fine and he excelled in school, he slowly grew more paranoid with each passing month. He began looking at every person he passed, wondering if they were the one who sent him the vouchers. It was increasingly obvious that the person was obsessive. Even Hermione had growing doubts.
Harry bit his lip. “You said earlier that you wanted to keep your heart intact but…you said when I first got here that you were just looking for fun. I’m not sure I understand.”
“That…certainly is a bit odd,” Hermione said, at a loss for words.
“Okay, fine. I won’t try to set you up.”
She made a thoughtful noise. “Time with you, mostly.”
The house was dark and silent. He slowly walked through the house, wondering if Malfoy was even home. What if he had gone to a club to pick someone up? Harry knew he wouldn’t walk in on Malfoy with someone. He remembered that Malfoy said that no one was allowed in his house. He quietly made his way to the door that he knew led to Malfoy’s bedroom. It was the only place he could be. He wasn’t surprised that the magic protecting the door from his entry was gone. Malfoy never expected to see him again. He opened the door slowly, glad that it didn’t make any noise. He let out an almost inaudible sound of relief when he saw that Malfoy was sleeping. He crept slowly over to the bed. He slowly reached out and gave Malfoy a slight shake.
“This can’t be,” Harry mumbled. “Not you. Not a man. I’m not gay. I like women. I always have. Oh, Merlin. I need to leave. I need to go home.”
“Oh? That is interesting. I can find out, if you want.”
“Yes. You don’t want to get in any deeper. Besides, you have enough saved to cover the rest of your education. You don’t really need any more.”
“I did make your life awesome, didn’t I?” Draco said, preening.
“What?” Harry asked incredulously. “I am not getting in bed with you! You’re naked! Why are you always naked?”
“Funny, I would have said the same thing about any of the purebloods,” Harry muttered in disgust.
Harry played with her fingers. They were slim and long. He felt her fingernails, not surprised at how nice they felt. He had already guessed that she was the type of person who pampered herself. “So, are you still set on sending me home tomorrow?”
“I love you, too,” Harry said, playing with Draco’s fingers.
“Perfect,” she said breathlessly. “Just keep changing your angle every time you thrust in until I tell you it’s good.”
“Aren’t you a curious boy?” she murmured. “I’m just making sure that this goes as seamlessly as possible. You really should thank me. I’ve made sure that it’s clean and stretched for you and got some lube for you to use.”
“Oh, yes. That delightful and so original nickname your friends gave Draco,” she drawled.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said slowly. “Did it really matter that much to you?”
Harry laughed as she pushed against his chest until he was laying back on the bed. He lifted his hips to let her slide his pajamas off his body.
“No, Hermione. I changed my mind. I can’t do this,” Harry said, shaking his head.
“I mean that they are identical. I told you that I have made it my business to know everything about you. I know exactly what clothes you own and your preferred brands of…well, everything.”
Harry chuckled. “It’s just…Ginny never did. She always took her mouth off and wanked me until I came.”
“Great,” Harry muttered. “Nice to know that there are people who hate me because of a stupid rumor.”
“I keep tabs on you, remember?” Malfoy said, cracking an eye open.
Malfoy smiled, his eyes closed. “I always sleep naked. I’m tired, though. I worked on some of the most draining wards today. I am physically and mentally exhausted. You don’t have to get naked. You can leave your boxers on. Just get in. Let’s sleep and talk tomorrow. I promise I won’t molest you in your sleep.”
“It has to be. Half-bloods and muggleborns who have that much money are few and far between. I can count them on one hand. None of them would willingly hand over that much money to anyone.”
“Honestly? I would have, too. However, I know it couldn’t be anyone else. The wealthy half-bloods and muggleborns all hate you with a passion.”
“So, what? You had a crush on me in school or something? Did I live up to your expectations?” Harry asked sarcastically.
“Yes. Watching your enjoyment turned me on so much. I couldn’t help but touch myself. I came right after you did.”
“And you have the best mouth I have ever felt.”
“I refuse to stand in the way of your future. I will not be the reason that you don’t get your work done. I don’t want to drag you down, Harry. I want to help you excel.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “No, you didn’t.”
Harry shivered at the moist heat from her breath. “Are you sure about everything? You seem so certain that I’ll leave as soon as I know your identity. Wouldn’t you rather have more time? I haven’t even been here a week.”
“Let’s just try something,” she murmured.
“Yeah, but do you really believe that I did that out of the kindness of my heart? I mean, I made you come here under duress as repayment.”
“Because I belong to you?” Harry asked doubtfully.
“You seem sad. What’s wrong? Is it so terrible to be here?” she asked softly.
He grabbed her hips and pulled her arse hard against him as he rubbed his cock into her in a tight circle. He thrust up hard and fast as he pulled her down into him. He heard her cry out, high pitched and gasping, just before he groaned loudly and came. They sat there gasping and panting as they relaxed in the afterglow. Harry wrapped his arms around her waist to hold her close. Harry turned his head to kiss her cheek.
“I’m not sure where it is,” Harry said.
“A few. Here and there. I needed to prepare for your arrival.”
“’Creepy stalking’, huh?” she murmured.
He heard the door shut before he could see again. He went to go wash up before putting his pajama pants back on and crawling into bed. He fell asleep reliving the fantastic blowjob that he had gotten.
“Will you tell me who your friends were?” Harry asked.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat at the sound of her voice. It was so soft, melodic, and feminine that he felt his blood rushing through his veins. He had never heard anything so beautiful. “Well, you have me here. Are you going to tell me your name, now?”
“I don’t think so. You are my favorite sight in the morning.”
made when he touched himself. Malfoy stared back blankly as Harry tried to avoid looking down his naked body.
“I find it exciting. When done right, it’s nowhere near as painful as people believe. Instead, it feels heady and even pleasurable when the right spot is hit.” She licked the tip of his cock.
“I’m afraid I don’t know. I just do as I’m told. Do you need to visit your vault?”
“I knew I could only spend time with you anonymously. You hate me. Once you find out who I am, I fully expect you to go through that floo and never hear from you again.”
“Aren’t scotch and vodka muggle drinks?” Harry asked, eyebrows furrowing.
“How can you tell?” Harry asked.
“Don’t be. It’s not your fault.” Harry paused. “Your home is lovely. I really like it.”
“You wouldn’t have been open to spending time with me if you knew it was me.”
She shivered behind him. “Have you ever told anyone that?”
“Mostly?”
“How do you know about that? No one knows the real reason I have nothing.”
Harry slid onto the bed, keeping to the furthest side he could. “Still no less creepy, just so you know,” he muttered.
“Not long after you proposed. A week or two. Apparently, she thought that she deserved your money since she grew up with nothing while you had everything.”
“You don’t seem that surprised,” Ron said suspiciously.
She laughed. “Probably not, but I’ll definitely see you.”
“Well, no more of that. I rescued you from catching some hideous muggle disease from living there.”
They sat at the table, and Harry was secretly glad that she already knew certain things about him. It seemed to make her conscientious in a way that made him kind of happy. Ginny had certainly never taken that kind of care to put his thoughts, feelings, and wants first like that. After they ate, she walked him to his room.
Maybe we shouldn’t meet up anymore, at least not for a while.
gorgeous. For a while back in fourth year, seeing Blaise in the communal showers had been Draco’s favourite wanking material. As much as he hadn’t thought about his friend like that in a couple of years, he could still agree the man looked unfairly beautiful.
“You’re being very loud—”
a part of you, despite its malfunction, and it is simply in need of repair. You must identify which items on your list are focused upon magical repair and go from there.”
“I— well remember I was going on about Malfoy being up to something? Well, it turns out he’s been looking after a flock of ducklings down by the lake.”
seems to believe that you’re seeing someone. Not that I care.
“The duck puns.”
"Thor would have killed him. No problem," insisted Pansy, gesturing wildly.
“For us,” interrupted Harry in annoyance. “What does it mean
“Now really, Draco. There’s no need—”
"My friend really likes you, love. He asked me to give you his number." She slipped the young woman his mobile number on a piece of paper and smiled. "He's filthy rich and works as a chemist. You should definitely ring him."
The report had been crystal clear— pregnant, eight weeks from conception, (which would make Draco about 17 weeks pregnant now), and the baby had appeared to be in good health. Now though, Narcissa wasn’t sure what state Draco or the baby’s health would be in since he’d been binge drinking and sleeping around since the night he threw the Healer out of the Manor. It was mind-boggling, to say the least, and Harry knew that the only way he’d be able to face the situation would be to take things one step at a time. And step one was finding Draco before he did anything too stupid.
The bell signalling the end of the lesson resounded throughout the room, but still, no one moved. Everyone was well aware that in Potions, the bell didn’t dismiss you, Severus did. Everyone sat, eyes transfixed upon the large portrait of Severus Snape behind the teacher’s desk at the front of the class.
Draco narrowed his eyes as Harry stepped closer, only stopping when there was no more than an arm’s breadth between them. The urge to lean away was almost overpowering as he waited to see what Harry could possibly want with him.
As he sat at the breakfast table, he couldn’t stop his stomach rolling around inside him, practically squirming at the thought of food being placed in it. Salazar, he needed to eat. He hadn’t managed anything at dinner last night, and if he was going to make any progress with Severus later on, he would need as much energy as he could get. He’d already taken Pepper-Up that morning and wouldn't be able to take another dose until bedtime.
Draco feels frozen to the spot.
“New rule!” Granger called, sitting up on her knees. “We don’t know how long we’re going to be in here, so it wouldn’t hurt to create a more friendly atmosphere. Everyone is to use each other’s first names. No more of this last name nonsense, or whatever else you’ve all been using.”
“Please, let me help you.”
Every couple of minutes he found his eyes being drawn to Potter. Even in the heat, the git was animated, his eyes shining with amusement at whatever inane thing he and Weasley were talking about. Draco was surprised to see how tactile he was, always gesturing and bestowing small touches on the shoulders or knees of his friends. Potter looked at them as if there was nothing more important in the world and Draco found himself wondering what it would be like to be the sole focus of that intensity.
"I nicked it from Pansy, actually," confessed Hermione with a sultry pout. "Promise not to tell on me?"
He knew they were being sent by one of the students in the school, possibly someone in his year, and it was utterly driving him to distraction not knowing who.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “What’s wrong with that?”
Finally, his legs and lungs burning with exertion, he reached the room, the door of which was still open. Malfoy was standing just inside, his left arm reached behind himself to hold the door open.
Alarmed at the glistening in Hermione’s eyes, Harry assured her that he did indeed love her as Ron helped to prise her off his person and lead her away to the nearest Floo. It was difficult to hold Hermione responsible for his headache when she was such a squishy drunk like that.
"That bastard!" Pansy screeched, causing the Ministry owl to fly off without its treat. "Just you wait, Draco Lucius Malfoy, 'cause I'm going to wring your neck!"
They looked around the room at the Auror desks, mostly empty as people were in the field or already off to lunch themselves. She shrugged and tried the handle. Locked.
you come over here?”
"Two words for you — Hulk smash!"
Draco knew he was staring, but he couldn’t help it. Potter’s body was utter perfection. The muscles in his chest flexed as he breathed, and Draco wanted to touch them and feel them ripple beneath his fingers. His eyes zoned in on Potter’s pecs and saw there were rounded beads of sweat gathering there, some dripping their way down towards his waistband. Draco wanted nothing more than to press his tongue to them.
Speaking of love, it turns out Cho is hot for Ernie MacMillan! Do you remember him from Hogwarts? Hufflepuff and quite annoying. He’s working at the Ministry, and Ron and I walked in on them shagging in one of the equipment cupboards when we were getting suited up for recon training. Everyone knows Ron can’t keep a secret to save his life, so everyone knew by the end of the day. He was over the moon to have gossip, but I feel traumatised. Do you have any idea how many shots of firewhisky it took to get the image of Ernie’s pasty arse out of my mind? I feel like it’s burned into my bloody retinas.
“What the fuck, it won’t budge.”
"There is?" asked Harry with a tinge of hope filtering into his voice. He seemed to be finally calming down enough to see reason.
Fine. I won’t say anything about your pervy Potion’s master, but you shouldn’t have to put up with that! Maybe you could get your own back another way? Like hex his eyebrows purple. Or swap his sugar supply for salt, so he gets a nasty shock when he makes tea. I definitely wouldn’t take Pansy’s advice on dealing with it. Sex isn’t the answer to everything! I haven’t got round to it yet either, and you don’t see me running about trying to shag my way out of my problems. Although, I don’t think sex would help the Cho situation or the tea bag situation, so the whole thing might be moot.
He settled himself into his chair and tried to force himself to relax as Narcissa called for the house-elf, who appeared and began to busy themselves with the tea immediately. Once they had both been served, the elf popped away, leaving Harry to fidget with his cup as Narcissa watched him curiously.
Just as he reached to pour himself some coffee, there was a sharp rapping at the kitchen window. Seconds later, Kreacher had let the owl in and placed it on the table in front of Harry along with a bowl of owl treats.
“My core-mate, my
Her eyes flew over the messy scrawl, her mouth forming a comical circle as she read. It was Harry's handwriting; Harry's name scrawled at the bottom of the missive. It was
Theo scowled, nudging the flowers with his foot. “A clue? Some poxy flowers? They’re not even that nice, a step up from weeds really.”
“Oh, for Salazar’s sanity, what the hell are you three doing here?” Malfoy demanded.
Malfoy’s didn’t cry.
"You, Harry Potter, are an absolute Godsend."
I love you, Harry.
I must have said it a million times too, as you undressed me on our way upstairs, your mouth on my neck, then down my chest, my fingers in your hair as you pulled my trousers down and trailed kisses down my stomach and then took me in your mouth. Fuck, Harry, it was absolutely mind-blowing. Your lips around my cock, so delicious and divine. The way you moaned as you swallowed me whole and then destroyed what was left of my sanity with your tongue.
"No way!" argued Draco and Pansy at once, their eyes wide with exaggerated horror.
Harry took him at his word and began to push up ever so gently into Draco each time he ground down, as if scared to do something wrong. However, once Draco had hissed, “I’m not made of fucking glass, Harry!” he had upped the ante, thrusting up as Draco pushed down, their mouths sliding against each other in a battle for dominance.
"Actually, Ron doesn't," contradicted Harry apologetically, cutting off Neville's triumph. "We really don't want him to find out yet, guys. I need to come out to him first and stuff."
His voice was flat, almost monotonic, and his eyes were distant, but Harry felt that he’d made decent progress by getting him to eat. He watched as Draco pulled the tray towards him and lifted the spoon, his eyes still fixed expectantly upon Harry.
? Wondered Harry. Draco had never bothered to come into his study before. The footsteps came closer, slow and light, until, finally, Draco was standing in front of Harry, the light of the fire making his fine blonde hair look like a halo.
“Wait a minute, if that was a thing then there would be loads of people with that bond. The number of people saving each other during the war was insane. Everyone would have one. You and Ron would have one, wouldn’t you?”
“Rennervate!” Draco sat on his heels on top of the bedspread and watched as Harry began to stir. Luckily, Severus had one Amortentia antidote left, at least something had gone right for once. Slowly, Harry opened his eyes and smiled blearily up at Draco.
“Look at me,” breathed Harry. Draco felt his eyes fly open and, as they locked eyes, he pressed down, letting the head of Harry’s cock stretch him impossibly as he lifted up and sunk down lower and lower, taking Harry inch by inch, until finally Draco’s arse was flush against Harry’s pelvis.
“When?” Harry asked, swallowing hard, not sure he really wanted to know.
“Yeah, I’m a real anomaly,” Harry muttered. “So, you know I have nothing to offer. Why would you want me?”
“Right…Draco,” Harry said tentatively.
“That’s another thing. She was talking about chakas-“
Harry eagerly awaited the next bite. The food was delicious. Upon listening closely, he realized that she was taking her own bites in between his. He wondered if they were sharing a fork and found himself blushing at the thought of being so intimate.
“All right,” Harry said.
Harry grunted. “Not sure how that’s possible. You’re almost impossibly tight.”
“Maybe it’s just someone who wants to help. There are philanthropists who help those in need. I would say that you are in need, Harry. Ginny wiped out your entire vault. You’re struggling to stay afloat, and I honestly don’t see how you can continue now that you don’t have a job.”
“First will be disbelief. Then, disgust. Then, anger and betrayal before you go through the floo back to your life. I just want you to know that, when it happens, I’ll still take care of you. You’re mine, and I take care of what’s mine. Just…try not to hate me too much.”
“You don’t have to do that,” Harry protested. He was hoping for a repeat of yesterday.
“I don’t know. Never got the chance to get that far. However, I like this.”
“What do you mean the same ones?” Harry asked slowly and suspiciously.
“Yeah.”
“Night, Harry,” Draco murmured.
“Yes, but someone spread a rumor that Seamus only did that under your orders. I tried to stop it, but they believe the fact that you did nothing to stop him is proof that it’s true,” Hermione said apologetically.
She laughed. “No, Harry. That felt really good. Stay just like that. You can move a bit faster now.”
“This is no time for jokes,” Hermione chastised him.
Harry wanted to say more, but he decided it was better to drop it. She obviously didn’t want to talk too much about it. The two of them had breakfast through their usual ritual, and wasn’t that weird to think about? The day he had arrived, Harry had panicked and made himself sick over how insane this woman was. Now, he was thinking of the way she ate bites between feeding him as their ritual. She talked him into going outside and laying in the grass under the sun. When Harry stepped outside, he realized that her wards must cover the entire property. He still couldn’t see. He could, however, smell the fresh air and grass, feel the warm sun on his face, and hear the sounds of birds chirping. She had him lay down on a soft blanket that she had spread out. They lay side by side, Harry reaching over to hold her hand.
Harry firecalled all of Ginny’s friends to find out where she was and to make sure she was okay. He hadn’t known exactly who she was having lunch with. She had never mentioned a name. No one had heard from her, not even her family. She never came home that day or the next. Harry had been frantic. It was when he was went to pay the bills that he realized that his vault was empty. It took several hours, a lot of frustration, and random bouts of yelling for Harry to find out that all of his money had been transferred to another vault, not a knut left. The goblins had not been able to tell him whose account it was transferred to due to privacy laws, but they had told him that his wife was the one who authorized the transfer. Harry immediately went to Ron and Hermione’s house. Hermione admitted that she had been having concerns about Ginny since before the wedding and that she had worried that something like this might happen. Harry had been furious that Hermione hadn’t mentioned it before. Two days later, Harry had received divorce parchments by owl.
“Ah, yes. A wonderful client. I assume you want to complete the transfer?”
“The fact that you could afford to send so much money every month,” Harry said softly as he thought back. “There are very few wealthy half-bloods or muggleborns. Hermione figured it out, actually. It was made easier by the fact that those half-bloods and muggleborns hate me with a passion, I think is how Hermione put it.”
“I don’t know,” Harry muttered. “I just feel so betrayed. He purposely did everything he could to make me think he was a woman. I was falling for who I thought he was. To find out it was a lie…it makes me feel sick.”
“They were all a part of the social outcast group at school. You remember how Seamus taunted them and humiliated them?”
“Get ready for what?” Ron asked.
“Creepy Malfoy?” Harry blurted out.
She cleared her throat. “Yes. Can I brush your hair?”
Harry was clueless. She gave no other directions, and he didn’t know which direction to try. He knew it felt good to him, but he wanted her to feel good, too. He started carefully changing his angle with every slow thrust. On his fifth try, she cried out.
Harry was a bit dubious. She was squeezing the tip of his finger far too tightly for him to be able to fit his cock in there. However, she said she could take it, so he would trust her. He carefully placed the tip of his cock against her before slowly pushing inside. He groaned, loud and deep, as incredible pressure surrounded him. If her reactions were anything to go by, she was enjoying it, too. When he was in all the way, Harry stopped for a moment to just enjoy the pure bliss at being inside someone again. It had been five long, lonely years since he had a warm, willing body instead of his hand. He struggled to avoid finishing too soon. He wanted to make the most of this encounter just in case she refused to see him again.
“So, we know each other, then?”
Harry went to go shower and get dressed. He stopped at the floo, afraid to go through. Hermione rolled her eyes and shoved him through before quickly following him. Hermione literally had to drag Harry through the streets to Gringotts, ignoring the strange looks they got. Harry held his ground outside the bank.
“Yes. I told you that I don’t allow anyone here. Cooking my own food is the only option unless I go out. Open.”
“I’m close,” she groaned. “Are you?”
“Good night, Harry,” she murmured.
“Technically, so have you,” Draco said.
“The first one said ‘get’, and the second one said ‘ready’,” Hermione said. “Put it together and it says, ‘get ready’.”
“Okay, how about this? You list everyone in your group, including yourself. That way, I have an idea without gaining too much of an advantage.”
“It’s also true that you’re creepy. You stalked me...for years. You entered my home without my permission and bought exact replicas of almost everything I owned.”
“I would have mentioned it by now, Hermione. I have no idea who sent it, why they’re giving me all this money, or what they want in return.”
“I’m glad you think so since you practically sucked my skin off to make it,” Harry said, his chuckle turning into a moan when she ground down hard on his cock.
“It doesn’t matter,” Harry said.
“Not directly. We hung out with different people.”
“It can’t be too bad,” Ron said. “It’s definitely a girl.”
“No. I didn’t want to admit it. Even to myself.”
“Yes,” came the slightly breathless reply.
He keeps an eye on Draco during lessons too, noticing how he tries to keep himself invisible. Never offering answers to questions or volunteering help. He’s smart, though, and finishes his work fast, second only to Hermione, his marks perfect each time.
“Say what now?” asked Draco, his voice high with disbelief. “You actually think I’m going to agree to just stay here? Whatever for, exactly?”
“No, I refuse to accept that.” Granger shook her frizzy hair from her eyes and glared around the circle. “The room obviously wants something from us before we can leave, so we just need to figure it out. It can’t be that hard, for Merlin’s sake!”
“You mean it?” Draco’s voice was small and chock-full of hope, causing Harry to smile indulgently.
"Oh come on now, it's not that bad. Take a breath and relax," Draco soothed, obviously trying, but failing, to calm Harry's completely legitimate freak-out.
“It’s okay.” Malfoy raised a sceptical eyebrow at that, and Harry couldn’t help but smile. “No, seriously. It’s okay. It sucked, but it’s over now. I mean, just look at them.”
“It’s just a new version of Healing Potion.” Draco found the not-quite-lie came easily to him and relaxed when Harry seemed to take him at his word.
"You, my sweet deluded one, are on!"
“Do yourself a favour, Malfoy, and put your cock away.”
“It’s the lunar quality of the Moonstone, Draco. Part of its nature is to change with the passage of time, growing and shrinking. You will need to find an alternative.”
He’d managed to make it across the hall, a few yards away from the doors, before the room suddenly tilted on its axis, bringing Draco painfully to his knees. There was no air in the room, and he found himself clawing at his tie and collar, frantically trying to ease his breathing. Heat was pressing down upon him from every angle, causing his hair to cling damply to his cheeks and forehead. He needed air, and he found himself ripping his shirt open, buttons scattering every which way, as he tried to claw at his lungs and somehow force them to work. The pain from his core was shuddering, scalding, like thousands of tiny Cruciatus Curses surging through his blood and gathering into one agonising mass where his heart should have been.
“Ah, but Draco, those symptoms are merely a product of your condition and not the root cause of what actually ails you.”
Harry let his fork fall onto his nearly full plate with a dull thunk, and he sighed.
“As fascinating as your desert fetish is, that’s no excuse for naming your pet such a thing,” demanded Malfoy, folding his arms across his chest.
“Thanks, Uncle Sev.”
Draco rolled his eyes. "Not what I was going to say. I was going to say, well, it's Harry. Mr Gryffindor who saved the world. And I'm me, ex-Death Eater."
“Charming,” drawled Draco, his eyebrows raised once again.
Draco squeezed his eyes as tight as they could go for a moment and then pushed himself away from the wall he was suddenly leaning against. He forced himself to walk, carefully lifting his feet and placing them one in front of the other. As he passed the bar, he reached out his left arm and grabbed an unopened bottle of Firewhisky, barely registering the hostile glare from the bartender. All he knew was that he needed to be alone, needed to breathe, and needed a drink. In that order.
As soon as they landed in the main hall, Harry propped Draco against the wall, where he teetered drunkenly, and pulled his wand and began slashing it around, strengthening the wards and making it impossible for anyone to apparate in and out of the building. Then, he summoned the jar of Floo powder and shrunk it down until it was able to fit snugly in his jacket pocket. Once he was satisfied Draco would be secure, he summoned Draco’s wand and placed it in his pocket along with his own.
Draco had been in the library all evening pouring over ancient tomes until Madam Pince finally had enough and thrown him out for the night, hissing about missed curfews and ungodly hours. He was too weary to muster a retort as he gathered his things and allowed her to herd him through the heavy doors and out into the corridor. He was so exhausted that he barely noticed the journey back to their rooms, operating automatically, and jolting in surprise when he found himself standing outside their door. As if waiting on his return, it opened to reveal a very worried, very irate, Harry Potter.
Suddenly, he felt Hermione's hand touch his back, and he spun round to find Hermione standing entirely too close for his comfort.
The sudden need to feel Harry’s skin on his own descended upon him, like thousands of fire ants devouring him. He reluctantly released his grip on Harry’s hair and yanked the white top over Harry’s head, throwing it to the floor. Harry, seemingly on the same page, lifted off of Draco, allowing him to take his own t-shirt off as well before lowering himself back onto him, both of them gasping as the heated flesh of their chests and stomachs touched properly, intimately, for the first time.
that we know that they know."
Draco was never late. Not once in their entire friendship had he left her waiting like this. She could feel her ire rising and was just starting to plan what to include in his Howler when the man himself blustered through the cafe door, murmuring a string of apologies about unicorn hair, potion spillage, and incompetent coworkers.
“Pansy, of course. I fucking told her to stay out of it. What did she give you? Amortentia? Did she cast a Confundus at you?”
“Who’re you calling a bint, you loose bitch?” Ginny’s answering yell caused the room to erupt in chaos, as both women lunged once again towards one another.
So, the thing is, I’ve decided to forgive you. I’m not going to forget it, believe me, and you’ll need to spend some time convincing me that you won’t just fuck off whenever things get too hard, but yeah. I still love you and I can’t imagine being with anyone else but you. You’re it for me, Merlin, help me.
“Maybe…”
“I’m saying that I know you put it there and you can bloody well get rid of it! You think you’re bloody hysterical, don’t you? All you arseholes throwing your weight around! And fine, I get it. I deserve it! The names, the hexes, whatever. But I draw the line at this shit!”
“I can’t…We need…Hold on a sec,” Harry gasped and waved his hand over their hips, nodding in satisfaction as their bottoms vanished, effectively removing the barrier between their cocks.
As Draco watched Potter lead her away, the girl Weasley looked back at him with a sly grin, carefully mouthing the words “Death Eater scum” at him. As they disappeared around the corner, Draco could feel his whole body vibrate with fury. He could feel his hand twitch towards his wand as his brain scrambled through all the curses he could cast after her.
“Don’t you?” Draco couldn’t resist. The idea that Harry might not hate him was both ludicrous and comforting.
And to answer your other question, I am definitely not seeing anyone. You wrote that plenty of people would be interested in a Death Eater. Ha bloody ha! I actually receive quite a few owls every single week (including Howlers) with various propositions from people who want to tie me to their bed and punish me since, I quote, “you are such a bad boy and someone needs to teach you a lesson”. I think I’d much rather be alone for eternity, thank you very much.
“Considering our pasts, Potter, one could hardly blame you for that.” The smile Draco gave Potter was grim and wan and seemed to add to whatever guilty conscience Potter was already wrestling with.
“Just please talk to me.”
Hermione’s brow furrowed. “Is that really the best idea? We need to stay in control of our faculties if we’re going to ever get out of here.”
“Because it was my past and I wanted to make it my future.” Draco saw Harry’s eyebrows wrinkle in confusion and attempted to clarify his rather cryptic explanation. “The mark was everything I had been taught to be and is everything I’ve grown to hate. The birds are my freedom from that life. Ravens for those who were lost because of it.”
"Would you like that, big boy?" she purred as melodic crooning began to fill the living room. She pouted dramatically at him before stepping back and beginning to wiggle in time with the light beat.
“Really? Good! Well, in that case you should move into my room. Let’s face it—my room’s better than yours: the view for a start is far superior.”
“We’re not chatting, Luna. You’re all sticking your nose in where it’s not wanted.” Harry knew he sounded like a petulant kid but was finding it hard to care.
Draco nodded, dizzy from the heat and magic swirling within the sliver of air between them. As Harry’s fingertips made contact with his chest, Draco’s magic thrummed in approval. Harry traced his fingers around the outside of the compass Draco had on his right pectoral. First along the circle of the casing, and then inside to run over the runes which were in the place of north, south, east, and west.
“I most certainly will not.”
“Shut it, Potter. It’s just a mild pain potion for the headache you’re giving me! Give it a rest already.”
The surprise at seeing Hermione try and dance seductively was quickly replaced by the overwhelming desire to laugh. He'd always wondered why Hermione never danced, and now he knew why. She was so stiff and uncoordinated, like a marionette on a string. What was worse, she kept pausing in her movements to strike what she must have thought were sexy poses. After a minute or two of this, he couldn't take it anymore — it was either interrupt or burst out laughing and give the game away.
Harry was quiet for a moment, his forehead scrunched up, as if Draco’s question was giving him a headache. “Dumbledore once told me that death was just the next great adventure. But on the other hand, you need to remember this is the same guy who thought ‘Nitwit! Oddment! Blubber! Tweak!’ was an appropriate start-of-term speech, so I’ll leave it for you to decide if he was right or not.”
“Yeah, I mean, other than the eyesight thing, you haven’t really done anything that’s bothered me.”
“I always said there was something off about him,” Ron said.
A few moments later, she gasped and cried out as she clenched around him. Harry bit his lip to try to hold out for a few more moments, but it was no use. He gave a stifled groan as he unloaded himself inside her. Harry barely managed to fall to the side instead of on top of her. He felt incredible, but he was exhausted. He yawned as he felt her hand slide into his.
Hermione leaned away from Harry. “How much have you been drinking?”
“Yes, I know. That’s why you got fired from the Ministry,” she said, laughing. “You couldn’t just suck it up for another day.”
“Idiots. So, any idea which pureblood this could be?” Harry asked, waving the parchment in the air.
“You’re right. That’s enough. Just…if he can make you happy…I’ll support you. I don’t care if you love a man or if that man is Creepy Malfoy. I’ll even suffer through dinner with him if it will make you happy.”
“Not because I’m sending you home. You just won’t want to stay.”
“Yes. You don’t have to worry about that. It can be erotic foreplay, but I’m in a bit of a hurry,” she said softly. “All you need to do is shove your cock in.”
“That’s a strange ability.”
“I don’t like the sound of this, Harry,” Hermione said.
“Hey, I enjoyed sneaking out,” Harry said, chuckling.
“It must be done carefully, and the owl must trust you, but yes.”
“Good night.”
Harry cocked his head a bit. “Do you not like Hermione?”
“My life wouldn’t have turned out half as crappy as it did,” Harry muttered. “Do you have any idea the kind of money he makes? He wanted me to work with him. He was going to teach me everything he knows.”
“You know how many partners I’ve had?”
Harry kissed him just to shut him up. “There. No more talking. Let’s get some sleep. We have to finish planning the wedding after your meeting in the morning.”
“Oh, it’s on,” Harry said seriously. “I’m not marrying you in those girly robes that she picked out.”
“I needed the top grades in order to gain admittance to the school that my father attended. They only take the best of the best. I suppose that I don’t mind entirely now that I’m looking back, but it was difficult to swallow back then. My father was so disappointed in me. He never said it, but it was there in his eyes every time he looked at me.”
“There’s no way we can figure this out, anyway. There’s no clue to their identity. The only clue is a vault number, and the goblins won’t identify the owner of a vault without the owner’s permission. I learned that when Ginny stole my money, remember? So, unless you have a plan of hiding in the bank near the vault to see who enters, there is nothing we can do.”
“You look better than dinner,” she murmured.
“You said that you used spells to stretch yourself?” Harry asked.
“That being said…he’s still creepy. I don’t think I’ll ever like him. Like ever. In a million years.”
Harry was surprised. “I guess.”
Harry turned his back on her voice. He started breathing harder as he started to panic. She really was obsessive. He had basically walked into being kidnapped.
“I know I’m three years too late, but I’m sorry.”
“Yeah. It looked no different than the rest of the letter,” Harry said.
“What are you thinking that is bringing that lovely flush to your cheeks, Harry?”
“There’s a spell for almost everything, Harry. You should know that by now. Sadly, your magical sexual education is lacking. You wouldn’t believe what magic can do for your sex life. However, we are sticking to the basics today. You can owl me in the future if you’d like to know more. I have plenty of books on the subject.”
“If you’re over it, then why haven’t you had a relationship since?” Ron asked.
“For what?” Harry asked.
“Just what everyone wants to hear,” she murmured, amusement evident in her voice.
“Why is it that you just know that I’ll leave?”
“Oh, yes. You wanted me to list everyone in my group, including myself. All right. Fair enough. Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, Theo Nott, Daphne Greengrass, Gregory Goyle, Astoria Greengrass, and Draco Malfoy.”
“You almost there?” he asked breathlessly.
Harry sat up on the bed, feeling upset. “That’s it? I don’t even get a kiss good night?”
“For what?” Draco said, bored.
Hermione stared at him in shock for a few moments before smacking him with the parchment, again. “It hadn’t occurred to you, a wizard, to use a summoning spell? If you didn’t summon it, what did you try?”
After school, life was going good for Harry. He was able to take his time deciding on his future path with the large inheritance that his parents left him. He proposed to his girlfriend, Ginny. They spent months planning their wedding or rather, Ginny had spent months planning the wedding. Harry had attempted to help in the beginning, but she never liked any of his choices. He had finally left her to it. When the bills came due, he was astonished at how much she had spent. In retrospect, that should have been his first clue. At the time, he had simply paid the bills, attributing her expensive decisions to never having anything as a child. He hadn’t minded spoiling her all that much. It wasn’t as if he couldn’t afford it. His second clue should have been her spending habits after they were married. He rarely checked his balance since he rarely spent much money. He hadn’t realized until two months into their marriage that Ginny was spending more in a month than he spent in a year. They had a huge fight over that. Ginny told Harry that he was being selfish by not wanting to share his money with her, his wife. He rebutted with the argument that she didn’t need even half of the items she bought. He had enough money for them to live a good life without either of them ever working, but she was blowing through the money as if it were nothing. He wanted something to leave to whatever children they had. Ginny had agreed to slow down on her spending even if she hadn’t been happy about it. A month later, Harry had found out she was pregnant. He had been overjoyed. He had been ready to start a family from the moment they said, ‘I do’. He had been heartbroken when Ginny ended up in the hospital a month and a half later after having a miscarriage. Then came the day that Ginny didn’t come home after having lunch with her friends.
“I really don’t see how that’s possible.”
“Yes. While I grew up in a wealthy family, I didn’t get to take that money with me when I left home. I built my fortune. I did so by being the top ward expert. Don’t think that information can help you with the mystery of my identity. I use an alias and Polyjuice in my career. I digress, though. I know wards inside and out. I can get in any type of ward without setting off an alarm, and I can create impenetrable wards. You wouldn’t believe what kind of money people are willing to spend on security. Of course, my wards are far superior to those that I create for clients. No one has better wards than I do. I can create wards that only affect a specific person or people, I can layer in surveillance spells to see any room in a house, and I can create wards that can withstand any kind of attack, even using muggle means. I placed new wards on the house last night in anticipation of your visit. They take away your sight at any time and in any room. The only exceptions are when I am not in the house and when you are in your quarters with the door shut. I have made arrangements for your everyday life while you are here. Your job will be waiting for you whenever you go back. Your school assignments will be sent here for you to complete along with pensieve memories from each of your classes. Your due dates for assignments will be a day or two later than the rest of the students to make up for the delay in the reception of your assignments. You are able to attend school when there is a need for it. I will be informed ahead of time by your professors when your attendance is necessary. You will be allowed to talk to your friends as often as you like. However, they will not be allowed to come here. I am very particular about my privacy. You should feel honored. You are the only person I have ever allowed here. My home is my sanctuary, and I don’t allow people to enter my sanctuary.”
“You’re a naughty boy, Harry,” she said with amusement. “What am I going to do with you?”
“I admit there is a part of me that is willing to take what I can get.”
“I did have a crush on you in school. I never said anything, because I knew you would never be interested in me. I admit that you did not live up to my expectations. After Ginevra, I expected you to fight to make your life good. To fight just as much for yourself as you had for your friends in school. Instead, you seemed to give up and accept whatever shite life handed you.”
“How did you know when to send that first voucher? It was delivered the same day.”
“So close,” she mumbled.
Hermione smacked him with the parchment. “How do you not know what it is? You obviously opened it.”
“What else?”
“What? How do you know that?”
“I hope so. It’s a lot harder than I thought.”
“A little,” Harry admitted. “I don’t know you. I don’t know your name or what you look like. I have no idea what you’re doing. I mean, are you trying to get to know me? Or trying to seduce me?”
“Did we ever talk?”
“Harry? What happened? You’ve been gone for days!” Hermione exclaimed. “We thought you would be back the next day, but you weren’t. We placed a charm on your floo to tell us when you came home. We’ve been worried sick.”
“No. I really don’t care anymore.”
Harry sighed. “It’s exactly what I pictured when I was younger. For my own place. Nice but comfortable. Back when I had the money to do it.”
Then came the day that he had finally had enough of his crappy job. It was five years after his divorce. He was sick of being a slave to those in powerful positions at the Ministry when he couldn’t even afford to eat on a regular basis. He had gone off on his boss for being ‘asked’ to clean the man’s clothing. That didn’t fall anywhere under his duties, and it was the final straw. He was immediately fired. It didn’t sink in right away what kind of position he was in. He went to Ron and Hermione’s, but only Hermione was there. She listened to him rant and rave until he began to panic as he realized that he had nothing anymore.  She offered to loan him money until he could find a new job, but his pride wouldn’t allow him to accept. Instead, he accepted the Firewhiskey that she offered him and got blind drunk. After Ron got home, he sighed and helped Harry through the floo. He got Harry settled on the couch since he was too drunk to make it up the stairs. Harry was dozing off when an owl flew through the open window.
“I have no idea. Maybe this person is insane. Giving me scraps of parchment with only one word written on them,” Harry said.
“There you go being blunt again. Though, you’re probably right,” she said, laughing.
“You there?” he asked.
“I’m going to go,” Harry said.
“We just got home, Draco. We’re completely alone. We can take our time since you still won’t let anyone in here,” Harry said.
“Chakras,” Hermione interrupted.
Harry sucked in a breath. “I’m not that good. When it first happened, I probably would have took you up on that offer.”
“Oh, the rumors were constantly circulating every time you went out about how you could barely get your hand up your skirt before she shut you down,” she said, chuckling. “She was quite the prude in school.”
“Oh, shut up, Ron,” Hermione said dismissively.
“Ron,” Hermione scolded him.
“I tried telekinesis. Apparently, I don’t have that power.”
Harry laughed. “Okay, you win. Now, we really need to get to sleep. You need to be up in…five hours. Good night, love.”
“Yeah, well, what can I say? I enjoy the classics,” Draco said with a grin.
She gave a hum of agreement. “Still, it has been quite helpful. It keeps me from wasting my time.”
“My, my. You have yet to disappoint me when you wake up,” she said appreciatively. “Always so gorgeous when you’re sleepy.”
“If you don’t use it, who knows what will happen to you? I think you should use it. You won’t accept any help from me or Ron. Accept this. Whatever the person wants, I will help you do whatever it is.”
“Merlin, yes,” Harry gasped.
“Fuck, that’s so hot,” Harry murmured, leaning up for another kiss. “I was a bit surprised that you swallowed.”
“You’ll love it. It’s so much tighter than pussy.”
“No,” Harry moaned as she gave a single hard suck on his tip.
Harry awoke to the sound of knocking. He stumbled to the door to answer it.
“How am I supposed to eat?” Harry asked.
“N-Nothing,” Harry stuttered.
“I’ve been studying wards since I was twelve. They caught my interest when I realized that they told my father every time I tried to sneak out at night. By the time I was fourteen, I could have changed the wards without his knowledge, but I was more worried about studying than sneaking out.”
“Then, what? Tell me. Maybe I can help.”
“Can’t argue with that,” Ron said.
“Thank you.”
Draco had worked hard to get what he wanted, but he finally had it. None of the details mattered to him. He may have apologized for how he tricked Harry, but he really didn’t regret it. All that mattered was that he finally had Harry after all these years.
“You okay?”
“Why argue about something that’s true?” Draco said flippantly.
“Yeah, but I didn’t get to choose anything. It was all Ginny. It was her dream wedding, not mine.”
“And how’s that?”
“So, what do you say, Harry?”
“I told you I did.”
“Oh, but you are. I admit that you are much different than you used to be. That whole incident with Ginevra dimmed your spirit. You used to be much more open, trusting, and vivacious. I miss seeing you like that. Sit.”
“So, I’ve been thinking over the message you gave me with each voucher,” Harry said slowly.
Hermione kissed Harry on the cheek, wrinkling her nose at the strong smell of whiskey that emanated from him. Ron waited for her to leave before putting his hand on Harry’s shoulder and leaning down to look into his eyes.
Harry mumbled something before closing the door and leaning back on it. His sight was instantly back. He peered around the large sitting room. He barely took in any of the details of the room. He saw a door ahead of him and walked to it. When he opened the door, he saw a huge bedroom that was easily three times the size of his own bedroom. However, the bedroom was set up the same way as his bedroom at home. The pillows and blankets all matched identically to his own. The only difference was that these were brand new. He found the closet and saw his clothes in there. Upon closer inspection, he realized they weren’t actually his clothes. They were just brand new copies of all of his clothes. Opening up the drawers in the closet showed that even brand new underwear and socks that matched his were available. He swallowed hard as he stumbled backwards out of the closet. He ran to the bathroom where he threw up in the toilet until nothing was left to come up. He sat on the floor of the bathroom for hours as his mind whirled with everything he learned. He was trying to reconcile how beautiful her voice and laugh was with how obviously crazy she was. When his body grew too stiff to sit there, he got up and headed to the bed. He groaned at how big and soft the bed was. He fell into a fitful sleep as he tried to figure out whether she was Pansy, Daphne, or Astoria.
Harry detected a tiny note of disappointment even though her tone was light. “You’re the one who said I would be going home tomorrow.”
“Then, why? Why go to all this trouble if you know it will end badly?”
“How do you know that?” Harry demanded, feeling sufficiently creeped out.
“I just woke up. I have to get ready first,” Harry said, yawning.
“Well, no,” Harry admitted. “But, it’s not like I came up with that name. Ron was the one who came up with it. Everyone just kind of started using it after that. I tried to get them to stop. I admit that I didn’t try very hard, but I did try. It just wasn’t worth the argument every time I brought it up.”
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked.
“You know how I feel about Creepy Malfoy, mate,” Ron said.
“Oh, that. It came last night. I have no idea what it is,” Harry said dismissively before laying back down.
“Will you go with me?”
Malfoy blushed slightly but didn’t bother to cover up. “I wanted to catch you before you left.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “It’s not like I’m going to leave you for him. I love you.”
“Thank you,” the goblin said distractedly as he scratched his palm and placed his hand flat on the parchment. “It’s done. Here you are.”
“How do you know about that?” Hermione asked.
Harry fell silent. He wanted more than anything to assure her that he didn’t care which girl she was. He would accept her no matter what. Instead of telling her what he was thinking, he allowed himself to be lulled to sleep by the heat of the sun. He awoke to soft lips on his own. He moaned slightly as he shook the sleepiness off. He reached for her, but she chuckled as she pulled away.
“Ah, that is so you don’t know who I am just yet. I don’t think you’re ready.”
He closed the door and welcomed his eyesight back. He went to the loo to relieve himself and brush his teeth before changing his clothes. He really wanted a shower, but he would wait until later. He opened the door and stood there uncertainly.
“So, then, does it really matter if he’s a man?”
Harry shook his head. “There’s no way it was just an act of kindness. Whoever it is wants something. If I don’t use it, I don’t have that debt hanging over my head.”
“Yes,” Hermione said firmly, placing a calming hand on Harry’s arm to try to ease his tension.
“Falling in love?” “Him?” Hermione and Ron said at the same time.
“Why? You taste good,” she said, licking a strip up his neck.
Harry cleared his throat. “Good night, Malfoy.”
“It’s our wedding,” Harry said, scowling. “Why shouldn’t we be allowed to make the choices? She already had her wedding.”
“Ah, yes. The client informed me that you might stop by. In the case that you did, I was to give you that.”
“That would be crazy,” Harry said unconvincingly. “Who knows what this person wants in return?”
Harry tipped Draco’s head up to kiss him. “We could always run away and get married. No planning. No girly robes. No mother planning every last detail that should be ours.”
“I don’t think so. The last time you set me up, it went horrible.”
“I know, but I wanted to,” Harry said softly.
“Wish I could say the same,” Harry said.
“Try me.”
“So, you have been making wards all this time? How were you able to start working so quickly?” Harry felt her sit down right next to him.
“You have no idea what that confession means to me. To know that you willingly shared one of your darkest secrets with me when you’ve never told anyone else…it’s a gift.” Her hand slowly went around to rub around his chest.
Harry’s life gradually got better. He found a job as an assistant to a wandmaker. It wasn’t very exciting, but it paid more than the job at the Ministry. It barely covered his living expenses, but he had a bit of cushion from the voucher that had been sent to him. He had started school to become a Healer. It was tough, at times, trying to make sure that he had time for school and work, but he managed to make it work. He was a bit worried about how he would continue to pay for school, but he worried for nothing. The next month, another voucher appeared for another 10,000 galleons. With his life on the right track, he felt even more uneasy about using it. However, Hermione talked him into it. She explained that he could use it for school. Once he became a Healer, he could pay back whoever sent him the money. Even if he didn’t know who it was, the goblins did. They could transfer the repayments back into the original vault. Harry reluctantly agreed, but he couldn’t help feeling like he was making a deal with the devil. The second time, he received another scrap of parchment with another word written on it.
“Which is?”
“That’s because she would kill you,” Draco said smugly. “Harry doesn’t care.”
“Can’t it be both?” she asked, placing her hand on his thigh.
“Shut up, Ron,” Hermione said with a glare. “If you can’t be supportive, you’ll wait for me at home.”
Harry stood there in indecision for a moment. He finally started to slowly undress. He did keep his boxers on. “How do you even know that I don’t have anything to do tomorrow?” Harry asked, tugging his clothes off.
“Yeah. I guess I might as well unless I want to lose my home. Maybe I can use some of it for school. You know, work on my future.”
There was silence for several beats. “I’m sorry.”
“I take it that you like it,” she said, a soft chuckle escaping her.
Harry followed her cues as she led him to the bed. He stopped when she did, and he felt her climbing up onto the mattress. She tugged him closer and he knelt on the mattress when he felt himself bump into it.
On the twelfth month, Harry took his voucher in and took the scrap of parchment with trepidation. He didn’t even look at it until he got home. He paled when he saw it. He immediately flooed to Ron and Hermione’s. He was babbling, and they had to give him a glass of Firewhiskey to calm him down. They both were concerned when he handed over the latest scrap. By now, the message was quite clear. ‘Get ready. You will obey. You are mine. You belong to me.’ The last word, ‘me’, was underlined with a full message under it. ‘I’m coming for you.’
“You cannot call that hovel a home,” Draco said, scowling. “It wasn’t fit for rats.”
“For what?” she asked incredulously. “For giving me the best shag of my life? I always knew you would be amazing in bed.”
“I don’t remember a letter like that,” Harry said.
“Ah, but that is the beauty of my wards.”
Harry whirled around to face him. “You’re right!” he yelled, face getting red. “I’m not gay, Malfoy! I wouldn’t have slept with you if I knew you were a man! Merlin! Why are you still naked?!”
“You can move, you know,” she murmured, her voice slightly strained.
“What? Give it here,” Harry said.
Harry laughed. “Modest, aren’t you?”
“Exactly,” Draco said, smirking. “There’s no one here. No one is coming. We can do it wherever we want,” he added, kissing Harry’s neck.
“Here you are.”
“All this? For what? Why not just owl me and tell me? Or fake an accidental meeting? This is all quite elaborate for a just a bit of fun.”
“Should I really just send the vouchers back?” Harry asked.
Hermione sighed and sat on the couch by Harry’s feet. “Was there a note?”
“You never answered my question. Does it really matter if he’s a man?”
She laughed. “Yes, I can be melodramatic, I know.”
Harry looked confused as he reached for a small scrap of parchment that the goblin handed him. “What’s this?”
Harry closed his eyes in relief when his vault was opened. It was nowhere near as full as it had been before Ginny, but at least it didn’t look as sad as it had for the past five years. He looked around in amazement at all the gold. He completely ignored Hermione as she gathered up enough galleons for him to buy the things he needed and hadn’t been able to afford since Ginny left. They stopped at a grocer’s on the way home where Hermione filled a cart with enough food to last Harry for awhile. She cooked dinner for him after sending a note to Ron to tell him that dinner would be at Harry’s that night. They filled him in on everything, and Ron kept insisting that Harry shouldn’t have cashed the voucher. He swore it would come back to bite Harry on the arse. At that point, Harry no longer cared. He had food in his house again, Hermione had assured that his overdue bills were paid, and he was going to enroll in school. While life wasn’t exactly good, Harry’s outlook was more positive. He was going to make the most of this money.
“I still don’t understand. Why me? I have nothing to offer anyone anymore.”
Harry laughed a little. “That’s very sweet, Ron.”
“Malfoy? Wake up,” Harry whispered.
“I-I don’t know,” Harry muttered.
“That eager to get away?”
“I just said I don’t know what it is,” Harry grumbled.
“So…are you ready to give in to temptation?” she whispered seductively.
“You ever want something? Really badly? But you can’t have it? You can have anything else but what you want? You’re that for me. I have managed to get every man I have ever even kind of wanted, but I could never have you. I knew I couldn’t even try.”
“You wouldn’t,” Harry said, narrowing his eyes.
Harry and Draco said their goodbyes before heading home. Draco wasted no time in stripping Harry. Harry was laughing as he tried to swat Draco’s hands away.
The tinkling laugh came again. “Lofty words, I know. It’s how I’ve always felt, though. You are mine.”
She laughed softly. “Just pretend it’s dark. I assume you’ve done this in the dark before. It’s no different. You feel instead of see.”
“Okay,” Harry said.
Ron just laughed and went through the floo. Harry got up and drank some water like Hermione had wanted him to do. He went to his room and crashed on the bed, asleep in seconds.
Harry nodded numbly as he stumbled through the door.
“What?” Harry muttered, squinting at her.
“Hopefully, give me back my eyesight,” Harry said. “It would be nice to know who I got off on.”
“Now, what all happened?” Hermione asked softly.
Harry sat down, and they followed the same little ritual that they had breakfast. She fed him while eating in between his bites.
“Thank you,” she said, sounding genuinely pleased. “Come along. I made your favorite tonight.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “It’s called calligraphy, Ron. That doesn’t prove anything.”
“Good morning, Harry. I must say, you look absolutely gorgeous when you first wake up. Are you ready for breakfast? It’s all waiting under a warming charm.”
Harry was even more paranoid and jumpier than usual. He half-expected someone to jump out of the shadows and kidnap him. Which was why he was so lost when he simply received an owl on the anniversary of the day that he received the first voucher. Ron and Hermione were there, and they gathered around to read the letter together.
“I don’t even know who you are,” Harry said, getting irritated. “You won’t give me any hint other than we went to school together.”
“To get to know each other. You see, Harry, you have no idea how long I have waited to have you at my mercy.”
Hermione sighed. “I honestly didn’t think he was serious. I thought it was a trick. I mean, our friends were horrible to him in school. I thought he just wanted to gloat about how far you had fallen. I didn’t want him to kick you while you were down. I realize now that I was wrong. I should have given you the letter and let you make up your own mind.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said with an uncharacteristic squeal. “I always hoped this day would come.”
“Of course. I’ll wait here. Do try to hurry. I’m famished.”
“Yes, I did. I remember hearing you talk about it in school. I wasn’t trying to eavesdrop. I was in the library working on a report. You and your friends took a table on the other side of the bookshelf, and you were all quite loud. It was a bit annoying, actually. It made it difficult for me to concentrate on my work. I was about to yell at you guys to keep it down. I stopped when I heard you talking about your dream house. It sounded perfect. So, when I was about to build my house, I remembered what you said. I kept it in mind as I designed and decorated it. I quite like it. I wish things had been different for you. I would love to know how different and similar our houses would be.”
“What’s a tuxedo?” Draco asked, wrinkling his nose.
Harry laughed, slightly hysterical. “You are a man, and I’m not gay. I don’t know how I can make that clearer.”
“You’ve had your cock inside me. I think you can call me Draco.”
“Soulless Ginger,” Draco muttered back.
“I’m sorry,” Harry muttered.
“Fine,” Harry muttered.
“Taking advantage of your shitty circumstances. Although, I must admit that I would do it all over again if it meant being here with you now.”
“Whatever. Just because the word isn’t actually what I thought it was doesn’t mean I understand it any more than I did before. It was weird. Everyone wanted to say that Luna was weird, but she’s perfectly normal compared to Gina.”
“It’s practically already planned,” Draco said. “You need to accept that my mother has been making all of the decisions because she doesn’t like our choices.”
She scoffed. “The only thing you don’t have to offer is money. That’s why many of your dates didn’t work out. Those women were leeches. They’re looking for a man who will take care of them while they go on shopping sprees and out to tea. As you can see,” a chuckle, “I don’t need a man with money. I have more than enough of my own. I am looking for something different. Not even a relationship, not really. Just some fun. Are you willing to have fun with me, Harry?” she asked softly.
“I have made it my business to know everything about you, Harry. I even know when exactly she decided to do it.”
Draco was just mostly glad about how right he had been about him and Harry. They complemented each other perfectly. They had disagreements from time to time which ended with slammed doors and silence. However, it was never more than an hour or two before one would seek out the other to make up. Their relationship had been particularly frustrating in the beginning. Harry had never been with a man before, so Draco had gone slowly with him. He had put up with weeks that turned into months of no sex because Harry was a bit squeamish about knowingly having sex with a man. Draco had been particularly irritable during that time. He wasn’t used to going more than a week without sex. The wait had been completely worth it to come home from work one day to find Harry in his bed, naked and blushing. It wasn’t too long after that, that Draco managed to convince Harry to move in with him.
“You don’t need to see with your eyes. That’s superficial.”
“I know, Ron,” Harry said, starting to get irritated.
“Sit on the bed.”
Ron nodded. “While those galleons have helped you out of the hole you got sunk in, I don’t know if it’s worth it. I could kill Ginny for putting you in this position.”
She pulled off, swirling her tongue around the spongy head as she did. “That’s what I wanted to hear. I said before that you were a naughty boy, but you can be a good boy, too. I can’t wait until the day. I’ve been working on preparing myself as much as possible just in case you agreed.” She wanked his cock as she talked, periodically dipping her head to lick and suck at his balls. “It’s so tight and hot around my fingers. Just the feeling of it almost brings me off every time. You know what I think about every time I finger my arse?”
“I never said I was nice.”
“Merlin, yes,” she moaned.
“What choice do I have? I have a lot of money saved up from those payments, but I don’t have the whole thing. I don’t want to know what that potion will do to me,” Harry muttered, glaring at the wall.
“Just a bottle,” Harry slurred.
“Harry, we’re already here. We’re not turning back. Get your butt inside before I drag you by your ear,” Hermione ground out, hands on her hips as she glared.
“So, how are we meant to get to know each other when I can’t see you?”
“If I tell you that, you could figure it out by process of elimination. That takes all of the fun out of listening to you try to figure it out,” the voice said, clearly amused.
Draco quickly dragged Harry to their room and shoved him on the bed, crawling up to hover over him. “There, now. Happy?”
“Okay,” Harry said loudly. “I love you, but go home, Ron.”
“So, it’s a pureblood?” Harry asked, looking at Hermione for confirmation.
Harry shivered slightly. He no longer cared who she was. He liked this woman. He nodded slowly, swallowing hard. She gently pushed him into the room and over to the bed. Harry had never been so nervous in his life.
There was a low chuckle. “You figured that out? What gave me away?”
“Maybe she’ll be hot,” Ron added unhelpfully.
Harry sat and waited until a glass was pressed into his hand. He took a drink of orange juice before hearing her speak again.
“Are you going to use the voucher?”
Harry yawned before letting her pull him up. He was surprised at the strength she showed. He let her lead him to his room where he made sure he was caught up on his schoolwork. It wouldn’t do to fall behind when he was almost done with school and due to start training in a few weeks. He got his assignments done and even started reading ahead when the knock came. He shut his book and opened the door.
“You can do that?” Harry asked as she sat down the fork and led him back to the luxurious sofa that they had sat at that morning.
I just don’t know how to get past that.
"Another date offer? Is your dick beer-flavoured or something?" Blaise asked, sipping his wine with a grin.
That morning, things had progressed even further. The culprit had charmed his shoes to leave duck footprints wherever he walked, and he unfortunately didn’t notice until he reached Charms and Professor Flitwick demanded to know why Draco was making such a mess on the floor. He’d gone back up to his room to change his shoes, but the arse responsible had actually cast the charm on all of his shoes! He actually found himself hoping to all the Gods known to wizards and muggles that he never found out who it was, because he would likely be facing a lengthy stretch in Azkaban for what he would end up doing to them!
“No,” replied Harry calmly. Seeing Draco begin to open his mouth, Harry ploughed on quickly, determined to head off any further ranting until Draco had at least had a bath. “And before you get your knickers in a twist, it’s really for your own good. I need you to stay here for a bit so we can talk and get you seen by a Healer, and then you can have your wand back, okay?”
“Why not?” asked Draco, his expression guarded.
There was a ringing silence as Susan glared at each and every one of them.
“You know, I do think you may be onto something. Could you perhaps read me the article in question?”
“Is that even possible?”
baby that seemed to have him slipping into mild catatonia. A sudden pain in his lungs had Harry realising his breath was coming in short quick bursts, and he forced himself to breathe deeply through his nose. There was no way he was going to descend into an all-out panic in Narcissa Malfoy’s tea parlour.
“Your determination to look on the bright side of everything is even more nauseating than my core sickness.” Draco had meant his words to be scathing, but they came out almost gentle, coaxing a sheepish grin from Harry. Draco placed his mug on the floor, the fluffy blanket slipping slightly from his shoulders, as he turned to face Harry more directly.
"Finally!" screeched Neville, looking positively delirious at the revelation. "Not that I'm not happy for you guys," he added to Harry and Draco, "but you guys have no idea how glad I am that everyone knows!" He began to laugh somewhat hysterically.
With one last furious look at her friends, Hermione stepped back into Harry's flat, closing the door behind her.
“Are you okay, Hermione?”
“Well, you’ve done something, mate,” Ron informed him rather unnecessarily. “Watch out, here he comes.”
“How can you say that?” Ginny was no longer crying and looked downright furious at Harry. “If he had just fucked off and died quietly, everyone would have been much happier for it!”
“What about you? What would you wish for?”
Longbottom’s organic tea is excellent, much better than the one I bought from the local Muggle shop, so thank you very much for convincing him to send me some. I will spread the word and convince all the Slytherins to buy it from him. Maybe Blaise will finally find the courage to make a move on Longbottom.
Draco kept his eyes peeled as he launched himself into the deep blue, determined to not miss a thing. The deeper he got, the colder it was, and he found himself shivering slightly as he pushed forwards, mesmerised by the sheer number of fish and crabs and coral all around him. At one point, he came across the biggest starfish he had ever seen, which wasn't difficult since he had never seen one before, but still! It was huge! And bright orange! He caught Harry's attention and got him to take a picture of him posing with the starfish.
"The Compact Oxford English Dictionary, of course. It's huge. One blow and the unsuspecting rule flouter would be toast."
“Out,” he responded flatly, grabbing a handful of green powder.
“Here you are, Mr Potter, your pass result for your class. Mr Malfoy, here is your pass result — on the condition that if you ever need to learn to drive properly, you hire one of my colleagues rather than myself. I haven’t reported either of you for the sheer abject terror of this lesson, but only because I will either be accused of prejudice towards a Death Eater’s child or trying to sabotage the great Harry Potter. Now, if you don’t mind, I find myself in need of a medicinal whisky. I bid you both a good day.”
“Why does it say ‘ready’?” Ron asked, frowning at the scrap of parchment.
“Good night, Harry. I will knock on your door when it’s time for breakfast.”
She laughed without mirth. “Oh, Harry. You say that now. I was going to wait until morning, but I would rather not put off the inevitable. I’m giving you your sight back now.”
Harry snorted. “I doubt that. I’m not anything special.”
When they were done, Draco snuggled into Harry’s side. “I love you,” he said softly.
“Not one. They were never fans of yours, either. They didn’t hate you so much as they just didn’t care at all.”
“Why be modest when I know it’s true? You haven’t had many sexual partners, but I know I’m better than the ones you’ve had.”
“Hello, Harry,” the voice purred.
“Creepy Malfoy,” Ron said in greeting as he sidled up next to Draco.
Harry told them the whole story. Beginning to end. He stumbled over some parts, partially from embarrassment and partially from having trouble forming the correct words. When he got to the part where he came home and downed his whisky bottle, he stopped and looked at his hands.
“When? And how many times?”
The next month and a half flew by. Harry threw himself into school and work, excelling in both. He earned a raise at work which helped enormously. Despite keeping himself busy, he couldn’t get his mind off of Malfoy entirely. Thoughts of their time together would creep into his head at the most inopportune times. He woke up a few times, hard and aching, from dreaming about Malfoy’s mouth on him. Finally, he couldn’t take it anymore. He waited until a Saturday night, so he wouldn’t have school or work the next day. At the last moment, his nerves overcame him. He kept going back and forth between wanting to do it and not wanting to do it. It was late by the time he decided to do it. He went through the floo into Malfoy’s house, never forgetting his floo address. He was slightly surprised that he was still allowed through.
“You’re right…but so was I. You may have enjoyed spending time with me, enjoyed my body…but you don’t want to stay now that you know who I am.”
“Yeah, I know,” Harry said tiredly.
Harry chuckled. “Funny.”
Harry tried to send it back. The owl refused to take it. He wrote a quick note that thanked the person for their help but explained that he felt uncomfortable with the arrangement. He asked that the vouchers stop, and he would pay back all of the money after he became a Healer. He sent it with his own owl, Hedwig, but the voucher was sent back with a scrap of parchment. It simply said ‘No’. He stuffed the voucher in a drawer but more arrived by the dozens until he finally gave in and took one to Gringotts. The flood of vouchers stopped immediately. He added the new scrap to his collection, dreading the coming messages.
“He did what?” Harry breathed.
“How are we supposed to do this when I can’t see?” Harry muttered.
Harry snorted. “Yeah, if the latest in fashion is looking like a girl. I may be marrying a man, but I will be damned if I dress like a girl. I want robes that resemble a muggle tuxedo.”
“Maybe we should ask Ron what he thinks,” Harry said, rolling his head to look at Hermione.
“Yeah on the breakfast, but I’m sure we’ve both grown up since school. I really like you,” Harry said as his hand was placed on her arm. “I’m sure I can see past school grudges to give this a chance. Unless…you don’t want to give it a chance.”
“Your wards?”
Harry quickly memorized the floo address at the bottom before the parchment burst into flames. He quickly dropped it before he realized that the fire didn’t actually burn anything other than the parchment.
“You have to admit it’s creepy,” Harry said almost apologetically.
Harry crossed his arms petulantly but rushed toward the door when Hermione reached for his ear. “Fine. Let’s get this over with.”
Harry felt her take his wrist and place his hand on her bare thigh. He bit his lip to hold back his moan. He hadn’t touched a woman so intimately since Ginny. He was mesmerized by how soft and smooth her thigh was. She wasn’t too big, but her thigh wasn’t a stick, either. Just enough to grab. Just how he liked his women. He wondered how he was able to feel her thigh. Was she wearing a dress? A skirt? Nothing? He could feel his body react.
“It was terrible.”
“Okay,” Ron said, still looking confused.
Harry blushed as he cleared his throat. “Honestly? Hadn’t occurred to me.”
“I don’t understand why.”
“That’s good. You have no idea how glad I am to hear it,” she murmured seductively as she scooted a bit closer.
“Yes. What gives you the impression that I would only have wizarding drinks?”
“You’ll never accept me. I’ve come to terms with it. Breakfast?”
“You no longer get to call me creepy since it didn’t stop you from asking me to marry you,” Draco huffed. “You willingly entered my home, climbed in my bed, dated me, and proposed to me.”
“I don’t think I could hate you,” Harry said. “I really like spending time with you. Not just this but talking to you. I’m really starting to like you.”
“You’re a pureblood,” Harry pointed out.
Harry slowly and hesitantly opened his mouth, feeling ridiculous. All thoughts of feeling silly faded, however, when a fork slid into his mouth and he tasted the best omelet he had ever tasted. He moaned as he chewed. He heard a throat clear.
She sighed. “Yes, I know. I just know that more time will make it worse when you leave. I would rather you leave with my heart still intact.”
“I know I don’t,” she said, amused. “I want to. It’s time you learned, Harry, about reciprocation. You willingly gave me a gift that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Therefore, I want to give you a gift. Just lay back, relax, and enjoy. I promise that you’ll enjoy it. I’m quite skilled.”
“Fine. I’ll let it go for now. How about we go to the sitting room where we can talk?”
“You seem nice to me. I mean, you didn’t have to help me.”
“You really do know me, don’t you?”
Harry whimpered as she licked the spot behind his balls. She sucked his cock in her mouth and set a fast pace, bobbing her head up and down, sucking hard as her tongue swirled and hit all of the right spots. Harry’s hands were reaching for something to grab, but he couldn’t find anything until she reached up and intertwined their fingers. Harry was so close. She kept slowing down every time he was about to tip over the edge. When his orgasm would retreat, she would pick up the pace again. She suddenly took a hand away, and Harry just knew she was touching herself again. The knowledge tipped him over finally. He moaned loudly as he came in spurts down her throat. He felt her moan around his cock as she swallowed every bit. He gave one last feeble spurt before she licked his cock clean and let it fall out of her mouth. Harry was panting heavily as she crawled up to hover over him and kiss him deeply. He could taste his cum in her mouth as his tongue explored.
“I know,” she sighed. “It must be horrible not being able to see. I have my reasons. I know you will likely be furious when you do figure out who I am. I won’t blame you.”
Harry sat in silence for several minutes. “It was…nice. I was almost…spoiled. I felt like I was the center of attention but in a good way. Like nothing mattered to him but me and how I felt.”
“Yes. While you haven’t been with anyone since Ginevra left, I know you did get drunk on four separate occasions during which you slept with four different women while you were with her.”
“I tried reaching for it,” Harry said as if it were obvious. He backtracked a bit when he noticed Hermione’s hand twitching as if she would smack him again. “Well, I mean, it’s not all I tried.”
“What do you mean by ‘finally’?”
Another laugh. “Always so blunt, Harry. I can assure you that I am neither ugly nor deformed. There are many ways we can get to know each other. I don’t plan on letting you leave until we do.”
“Don’t worry. It won’t be too much longer before you know and leave.”
“True. However, I offered to help.”
“For being so tired,” Harry said with a chuckle. “How did you know I would be amazing?”
He struggled to get the envelope off the owl’s leg before taking a good look at it. The envelope was cream-colored and obviously expensive. It only had his name written on the front of it, and he was curious to see who it was from. He attempted to open it carefully, but his fingers wouldn’t cooperate. The envelope ripped open, a single sheet of parchment flying into the air and fluttering down to land on the floor. He gazed dolefully at it before reaching out to get it. Had he a clear mind, he would have just used his wand. However, he couldn’t reach it or make it come to him with the power of his mind, so he gave up. He decided to find out what it was in the morning. He fell into a fitful sleep, dreaming of living on the streets while a million Ginny’s laughed as they walked by.
She laughed. “Oh, I can, and I do. I have no trouble getting men. However, none of them compare to you.”
“I don’t know how long I could bite my tongue even needing the money,” Harry said, chuckling.
Harry and his mystery woman had breakfast together the next morning, exchanging several casual touches between them. She took him back to his rooms after. She handed him a bag that had his homework assignments and the memories of his professors from classes the day before. There was a pensieve in a cabinet that he was to use. She told him she had taken the day off yesterday to spend time with him, but she had to go to work today. She encouraged him to watch the memories as soon as possible so he would have time to explore the house while she was gone and he had his eyesight. He would have time to work on assignments after dinner. She did warn him that her quarters were off-limits. They were warded just as heavily as the house, so he wouldn’t be able to get in them if he even tried. He didn’t know it, but any and all personal items that could be used for identification had already been removed from the areas of the house that he had access to.
“Then, why don’t any of them go on more than three or four dates with me?” Harry asked.
“There’s an orgy?” piped up Theo, looking truly interested for the first time since he’d arrived. “I thought we were just keeping an eye on Potter. I’d definitely be up for an orgy!”
Draco took so long to answer, that by the time he whispered the word, “freedom”, Harry was already fast asleep.
“Harry, wait.” Draco shivered, the whole thing suddenly seeming so wrong.
“Can’t you guys control your Gryffindor?” she appealed to Ron and Hermione.
The Leaky Cauldron quiz night had rolled around, and the place was heaving with optimistic patrons, all desperate to have their name written on the winner's plaque displayed proudly upon the bar. In the corner, at a large round table, Blaise and Hermione were putting the finishing touches to their plan.
Which was how Draco found himself squatting alongside Hagrid next to the shielded nest. Upon sight of him, the ducklings began standing on wobbling legs and making their way towards him, crying needily for him all the while. Cries that became the most cutting of screeches once they reached the shield barrier and found they couldn’t actually reach him.
He placed the phone back onto the table and surveyed the array of stunned expressions on several of his friend's faces.
After what felt like an age, Harry lined his right forearm arm up with Draco’s and any air left inside Draco’s lungs wooshed out, his mouth hanging open.
Draco responds to Harry's letter...
Harry groaned. "Sorry, mate. Truly." Neville cocked an eye open to look at Harry's guilty smile. "But yeah, it was completely worth it. I had some of the best sex of my life. I didn't even know someone could suck a—"
“Maybe I don’t need to invent a new potion, but simply modify an already existing one. Like an altered version of Amortentia to mimic the bond between the magical cores?”
Draco considered. It really felt like a bad idea to put it off any longer now that everyone else knew. "He's been less stressed lately, and it's not like we're not friends. I think he can handle it, Harry."
He’d refused point-blank, voicing his many reservations and protesting any argument thrown his way, but he knew it was only a matter of time before he gave in. Pansy was a force to be reckoned with, and she always got her way. Especially with Blaise in her corner, they were a whirlwind of emotional blackmail and underhanded threats.
"You know, I've never actually given a massage before," Harry confided, a flicker of hope fleeting across his face. "What if I end up hurting you?"
"Leave him alone, ‘Mione,” Ron said, coming to his defence as usual.
You need to get a grip, Draco. If you bothered to subscribe to the papers or poke your head out of your hidey-hole, you would know that the public is very much on your side, with the odd exception of one or two people. It turns out you weren’t the only person Orion screwed over, and they’ve all been coming forward in droves to testify against him. You’re really 100% in the clear.
Draco was sure that whoever decided Muggle Studies should be mandatory was secretly a sadist. By all means, encourage inter-house unity until every student was sick to death of it, but Muggle Studies was completely useless and the teacher, a very young and idealistic  Professor Bumble, was stark raving mad. So far, they’d learned about Muggle cooking (resulting in Draco nearly slicing off one of his fingers with something called a blender), laundry (which resulted in many students being branded with multiple iron burns), and now they were learning about transportation. Last week it had been trains and buses — who, in their right minds, would travel on a Muggle train? Without magic to guide and protect it, it was basically a death trap on rails! This week, however, they were learning about cars, and if he thought Muggle trains were unsafe, it was nothing to how ridiculously reckless driving a car was. He really didn’t think there was anything that could make this class any more unbearable.
