"It's no use shouting. This place is soundproof. No one can hear you, even if that stupid dog patrols by outside later, it can't hear you. So you might as well save your breath, bitch." Pansy Parkinson sneered at her as she stood at her feet. Crabbe and Goyle grunted their laughter behind her.
Snape took the parchment from her and read through it. His face was even paler than before when he finished with the parchment. He passed it to Professor McGonagall who winced at the parchment when reading through it.
"How come we can feel each other's emotions now?" Harry panted, because the kiss they had just shared made him want to kiss Draco again.
"You mean me." Draco smirked. Everyone in the class chuckled. "Anyone want to hear sob stories? Here goes nothing. Very little Muggle-borns were sorted into Slytherin. It could be because they were thankful of their newly gained magic that they aren't that ambitious. Most of us there are pure blood witches and wizards. From the time that we were able to understand our surroundings till we were ten, it was drilled into our heads that we were superior and we were taught the basic hexes, for self protection. I guess it can be a brainwashing procedure. Then we come here, where everyone accuses us to be arrogant, sneaky and evil, we will have the tendency to be just that, for the sake of reputation. Our family cares about that. Above everything. The pureblood families are just like the aristocratic families back in the Victorian times. We do things for show." Draco explained.
It was a while before Harry finally rolled off Draco. Looking at Draco smiling at him, he couldn't help returning the smile. "Morning." He muttered, as he bent in to give Draco a peck on his forehead, and muttered a cleaning spell over the wet area on the groin area of both of them.
Anyone looking into the kitchen of this house would think that this was a normal house, with a normal household consisting of parents with two children. Except that this was not the case. Three of them were normal, and they were a family. However, the seventeen-year-old boy who was currently serving the other severely overweight boy was not normal or part of the family. He never deemed himself to be anyway. He was the cousin of the other boy, and nothing about him was normal, due to that lightning bolt scar that marked his forehead above his right eyebrow. He was not just leaving for school, but he was leaving for a wizard school, where the curriculum was pertaining to teaching the students how to use magic. And this year was his last year in the school, and after that, it meant that he would be able to use magic whenever he felt like it. Harry was now hurrying through breakfast so that he could get out of this house for the rest of his life as fast as possible, as he knew that after he graduated, he no longer had to live with his uncle, aunt and his dreadful cousin, whose whole family treated him as a maid.
"People would only think that your detention ended late. No one would know that you are missing till a few hours later. Or they may think that you are out playing a prank. By the time they find you, you won't be alive anymore." Pansy continued sneering at her.
Draco smirked. "Maybe they did. They didn't expect the great Draco Malfoy to lower himself to play against them."
Harry collected his wand from his bed and went into the Study area. Stopping at the panel, he stared at the movement chart that Hermione had put up on the wall beside the panel the first night they had moved in. Her reasoning was that it would be known to all where everyone was if they ever needed to know where to find someone. She also taped a copy of everyone's class schedules on the panel. All everyone needed to do before exiting was to run their thumb over a box at the top of the movement chart, thinking about what they were going to be doing, and the chart was enchanted to recognize their thumbprint, recording the activity and the time. Harry ran his thumb lightly over the chart, seeing the word 'run' magically appearing in the column labeled under his name, with the time stating 6.28am. Seeing the time, Harry realized that he had two minutes to reach downstairs. He pressed a button indicating that he wanted to open the panel, waved at Marcus who was barely awake, and raced down to the Gryffindor common room. He then opened the portrait and saw Sirius sitting outside, wagging his tail in greeting. He motioned Sirius to follow him and man and dog made their way to the Quidditch pitch.
"Nope. No problems. But I do have some questions to ask you. So why don't you and Snuffles follow us up later?" Harry answered. Remus nodded and turned his eyes towards Sirius, who was now licking his paws, with the empty plate and a pile of bones in front of him. Harry saw his loving look and turned to look at Draco who was also staring at the professor. He lifted his eyebrow, to which Draco shrugged his shoulders. It seemed that there may be something between Sirius and Remus that they all did not know about.
Draco looked at his raven-haired boyfriend in front of him and used the sleeve of his robe to wipe the tears off Harry's cheeks. What he said did tally with the feelings that he experienced… except for one emotion. "Harry, I need to tell you something." Harry looked up at Draco, frowning. "Just now, when you were crying, I… I felt your emotions. And what you told me tallied with the emotions I felt, except… for this." Draco tried to imitate the love that he felt coming from Harry previously. Harry gasped. "Did I get it right?" Draco looked at Harry, hopefully.
"But… isn't Malfoy blacklisted, so Pansy won't even go near him? Unless Pansy wants to be blacklisted too." Hermione frowned, thinking about the issue.
"Dumbledore says that they don't want to involve students in the Order yet. I don't think it's a good idea. Students get information from their parents. Students share that information. News spreads. If we can determine who is trustworthy in the different houses and get them into the Order, it would be more efficient."
Draco shook his head, staring at Harry's lips. "I think it was you. I felt a sudden pain in my head just now when the window broke. I think the power you unleashed broke through the emotional barrier between our minds."
"Seam? What's going to happen tomorrow?" Dean asked, tilting his head so that it rested on Seamus' head.
"Um… of course, a relationship between the two of you would really strengthen the bond." Dumbledore mumbled. "Well, Sirius, do you have anything else planned for today?" Sirius shook his head. "Early dismissal. Go talk about this, but try not to let the whole world knows." Dumbledore said, seeing Sirius change back before unlocking the door and sweeping out of the door with Sirius. "Come on, Snuffles." He said as the door closed behind them.
"Okay, request is approved by the other two too. You can attach a thread to the sphere just like Albus did. We'll snip off the thread after sending a warning to you mentally should there be any attacks. Okay?" Godric answered. The two boys nodded and both started to imagine the thread similar to Dumbledore's, till a thin silvery blue thread attaching itself to Dumbledore's thread. Draco did a illusion charm to it so that it would not be discovered.
Harry looked down at Draco. The two of them had decided on the night of finding out that they were soul mates to not tell Ron and Hermione or anyone from their dorm about them being soul mates. This was to protect them as the less they know the better. As good friends of Harry and Draco, they were already among those who were most likely to be targeted for kidnaping by the enemies for hostage or information. All they knew were that the two of them were in a relationship.
Looking fondly at the good-looking blond beside him, he noticed a light reddish bruise on his neck, which was not completely covered by the collar of the shirt under the robe. He blushed, remembering how Draco got that bruise. The two of them was kissing each other in the washroom before dinner. Slipping his mouth from Draco's mouth, he had trailed his mouth down Draco's pale neck to his collarbone. Concentrating on nibbling the patch of skin had made Draco moan with pleasure as Draco clenched his fingers in Harry's hair, arching his neck for Harry's mouth. In the times when they were fooling around, Harry found out that Draco was very sensitive around the neck area, and they would often emerge from their free periods with patches of pale bruises on Draco's neck. Shaking his head now, he glanced back at the parchment before him and hurriedly scanned his Potions textbook to quickly complete the assignment.
Harry flicked a glance up at Draco's grey eyes, grinned and nodded. "Just now I was showering, it was really noisy, Seam… remember… silencing charm next time." Seamus and Dean just walked into the Study area and heard Harry's comment. Both of them blushed as everyone laughed at their expense.
On the whole, the lesson went very well. Each pair was given a small hamster, which each partner took turns to change it into a mouse, a rabbit, a turtle and back to a hamster. The cycle went on as the requirement was that you need to change the color of the animal at each transfiguration. It amounted to quite a bit of laughter as Neville was seen chasing after a blue rabbit which hopped off after the change. Finally when the animals were changed back into the original hamsters and placed back into their cage, the class was dismissed.
"You mean Dumbledore get warning before Voldemort actually reach the Great Hall? Wow, that's useful." Harry gushed.
With these words, her tears fell as she twisted her aching body till she was lying on her side facing them and curled her body up. Harry's eyes filled with tears as he looked at her. Even Draco's eyes seemed a little wet. Both were silently blaming themselves for causing her pain.
Harry laughed. "Why should I mind? I'm happy for you both. So Professor, does that make you my godmother?" Harry grinned, and Remus blushed at his comment. Everyone laughed.
Harry laughed. "But we need to discuss stuff. It's very tiring to discuss in a whisper." He said in his normal voice. "You know, I think we need to be kept informed of things that happen. Do you know about the Order?" He asked. The Order that he was referring to was the Order of the Phoenix, a group of people who were fighting against Vorldemort. He had been told about their existence since fifth year but wasn't asked to join yet, as he was still a student of the school.
"How do you know? I didn't… oh…. What if he doesn't like me? What if it's just lust? We have a perfect friendship going on! What if it doesn't work out and… Harry, stop laughing!" Dean looked so frantic that Harry finally realized that Dean was really feeling wretched for liking his best friend.
Looking at Ron, he could tell that his best friend also came to the same conclusion as him, when Ron turned from staring at the door of their room to him and gave a small smile. Harry returned the smile. At that moment, Harry felt very content, as he looked around at all his good friends beaming at him.
Ron looked at Draco, seeing the honesty in Draco's eyes, and nodded, getting up, to keep his chess pieces. "Another game on Thursday? I need to train myself. Who else can I practice against but you?" Draco nodded in agreement, as they made their way to their room.
"You are kidding me! I really love that dog, but letting it eat at the table is too much huh?" Ron exclaimed, as he sat down. Sirius' eyes narrowed and a growl escaped him.
"Gin, Wednesday eight pm, prefect room. Pass the message." Ginny nodded and went to find the other prefects of the house. Hermione then turned to Draco. "You do know that I'm going to miss you arguing against me in the prefect meetings right?" Hermione smiled at Draco.
Professor Dumbledore looked up at the students who had seated themselves at their house tables, frowning when the food did not appear on time. It was times like this when he wished that he was not the headmaster of Hogwarts. He loved being around children, but there were some problems that no one was willing to handle, like the announcement that he had to make.
"Dray… Don't tease her. Dinner's the only time she's not reading." Harry joked. Hermione blushed and looked at Ron.
Draco shook his head. "You know, it's amazing how Hermione got a boyfriend. I'm amazed that she even noticed Ron."
What they did not notice was that while they were making love, the two of them started glowing. All the two of them were conscious of were the pleasure each gave to the other and when Draco could open his eyes to focus on Harry during the rocking and stroking of their bodies, all he noticed was how sexy Harry looked with that love shinning from his eyes and his black hair was being messy from the rocking, with his enchanted starlit canopy as the backdrop for the love-making. Suddenly Harry changes the angle slightly in his thrusting and the pleasure was even more intense than before. Draco could not control himself anymore and at that same moment, Harry also reached his peak. Both of them threw themselves over the cliff of ecstasy so intense that they both blacked out from the sensation.
Scorpius took the first verse and sang very well, doing his best to follow the recommendations of the song and not sound nasally. His voice was rather good for a kitten. James took the second verse, still playing the piano as he did so. Draco sat happily in his chair, eyes closed, nodding his head to the beat as they sang. Scorpius attempted to pick the song back up once more but James had gone off of the script and started to play a random song on the piano, to show off. Speaking of showing off…soon James had climbed on the piano and was using all four paws to play it! And dancing on top of the keys!
“Not now, darling. Darlings, you just stay here. And I’ll go and look for Albus. Albus? Albus, where are you?” Draco called as he walked away from two of his sons to try and find the third.
“George, we were born with flat feet.” Fred reminded his twin before they both dissolved into a fight of laughter.
“The police said it was a professional, masterful job.” Lucius continued gloating about his crime, puffing himself up with pride. He hadn’t realized that Hermione was looking at him the way she would look at a soiled stall.  He was too full of himself to pay attention. “The work of a genius. Not bad, eh, Hermione old girl?” Lucius declared happily and he brought the now rolled up newspaper down onto Hermione’s rump.
Back at the manor, Lucius was on the phone, holding the bag of cats as he talked. Harry had gotten to the house quickly and watched as the evil human finished his call, grinning maliciously as he hung up the phone. Harry ran from his spot on the windowsill to follow the man. He had to save his family! Lucius ran out of the door to the stable, holding the bag close to him as he did so. He slammed the door behind him before Harry could follow, so the black cat jumped into the window to await the right moment.
“Well, it’s your turn love, come and join me. The slide is epic and the water feels great!” Harry smiled up at the blond.
The cat family was sitting on a nice, comfortable loveseat where they were supposed to be posing for pictures. James and Albus, of course, had other ideas and were currently busy chasing each other around the arms and back of the sofa. At Madame’s words though, the two little rascals settled in close to their dads and their brother Scorpius. James and Albus swatted each other playfully a few more times before sitting up straight and looking at Madame.
“No, no, no baby. You just hide over there, and you leave the rest to J. Harry Potter.” The black cat said with a bow before turning to climb up the tree nearest him.
“Now let’s leave Albus to his painting.” Draco said to his other two kittens once James had recovered from his laughing fit. “Now dear you go to the piano, run along.” Draco said as he booped Scorpius lovingly.
Pansy’s jazz band was playing loudly in the piano room, color changing lights and all. Draco and Harry were already dancing together, and the kittens were all getting into the groove too. The cats all sang together, “Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat.” Ron was dancing atop the piano, acting as if he was conducting the band, but not singing along, just smiling at them all.
Albus, also entranced by the alley cat, was currently paying rapt attention to the way this Potter guy walked. He was trying to imitate the cat’s stance with his legs as he watched from the basket, still hidden from view with his siblings.
“Oh and I’m so very glad we did.” Draco answered, smiling down at the black cat and fluttering his eyelashes.
Draco chuckled and sat down next to Harry on the towel. Harry pulled Draco on top of him and mashed their lips together. Draco returned the kiss passionately, deepening it immediately as his hands roamed over Harry’s chest. Harry’s hands explored Draco’s chest in return moaning into their kiss. Draco rolled them over, wanting Harry to take him hard and fast. They kissed for a little while longer, but Draco did his best to whisper what he wanted in between their kisses.
“Shh. Listen,” Sirius chided, lifting one of his ears up to listen closer. “Sounds like a one-wheel…”
“Well as you know, apart from Lucius, I have no living relatives. And with our divorce on the horizon it’s safe to say I have no living relatives at all. Naturally I want my beloved cats to always be well cared for.”
“Of course, Madame, right away,” Lucius said as he smiled knowingly. The cats were indeed tuckered out, as she put it, but not because of Luna’s visit. Lucius grabbed a travel bassinet and put the kittens inside in order to carry them all up the stairs at the same time. He put them in their bed next to their father, and discreetly tucked the small bassinet in behind their large bed. He bid them a sickeningly sweet good night, and bowed to Narcissa on his way out the door. Lucius busied himself with cleaning the mansion for a few hours before he felt enough time had gone by. Stopping his charade abruptly, Lucius ran to his room, put on his travel hat and cloak and set his least favorite shoes by the front door. He thought better of wearing them upstairs since they squeaked loudly with every step. Quietly, Lucius climbed the grand staircase and waited, barely breathing, to see if Madame was indeed asleep. He stood outside her door for over ten minutes, waiting to hear a sound, but none came.
Harry stood by the door to their home with his hand resting on the handle of his suitcase. He chuckled to himself and looked at his watch, shaking his head. Draco was debating adding a few more “outfits” to his suitcase that was still in their room. This was the main reason why Harry had just rented them an entire private island for their getaway. With the island being part of the Wizard BnB network, they could arrive whenever they wanted so long as they were there during their reservation. Just when Harry was about to call for Draco, he heard the sound of a suitcase being carried down the stairs. Draco blushed as he saw the loving yet exasperated smile on Harry’s face.
Harry returned with two steaming mugs of tea and placed one on the nightstand by Draco before setting his own down and climbing into bed himself. The covers were incredibly soft without being too warm and Harry was certain he would sleep very well in this bed. Not having brought a book of his own, Harry turned to look at what Draco was reading. He chuckled when he recognized their favorite collection of short stories and smiled over at the blond.
Draco moaned louder at the speed and cried out Harry’s name, burying his hands in the sand as he craved something to scratch at. Harry slowed down for a minute, giving them time to readjust so that Draco was facing him again. Draco’s whimper turned into a moan as their lips pressed against each other in a passionate kiss. Harry bit Draco’s bottom lip and swallowed the moan greedily and deepened the kiss as he started to pound faster into Draco once more. Draco scratched at Harry’s chest and swallowed Harry’s grunted response. Draco nipped at Harry’s bottom lip as their kiss broke and Harry whispered into the blond’s ear.
A goose was screaming loudly and a man shouted “Sacre bleu!”  The exclamation was followed by the sounds of pans being thrown.  The commotion escalated into,  “Oh, he bit my finger! Get out! Go! Go, get out. Scram!”, yelled by the frustrated cook who then tossed a very disheveled looking goose outside the back door.
“Now Luna, do be serious. I have asked you to come here on a very important legal matter.” Narcissa tries to scold the other woman but her voice is far too kind for it to be effective.
“Oh, never mind. Just run, move, go get him!” Draco called as Ron managed to open the vent in the door.
“For your eyes only… I will wear this. And you have to wear the matching one at all times,” Harry said, green eyes serious but still full of love and laughter.
Harry groaned as he typed. “I think you are cock sick love. No, that doesn’t count, stop texting me and I will be home sooner.”
Hermione watched the fall with tremendous glee, part of her wishing Lucius had been hurt. Her look turned into one of concern and terror though, when she saw that Lucius had picked up a pitchfork and was stabbing at the hay, trying to skewer Potter! Harry managed to dig himself out of the hay unharmed, but Lucius spotted him immediately. The blond man chased Harry into a corner, trapping him in front of the side door and Harry turned to face him, terrified. Lucius ran, swinging the pitchfork and missing Harry by a breath. But Harry wasn’t sure the man's next attack would, so he closed his eyes as Lucius wound up and threw the pitchfork at the black cat. Hermione whinnied loudly in terror, certain that the poor hero cat was lost. Turns out, Lucius had a terrible aim and Harry was merely trapped against the wall by the pitchfork, his slim build keeping him firmly between two of the prongs.
“Yes, yes. It was the night of your grand premiere that we met again. Remember?” Luna recalled fondly.
“Let go of my Spectrespecs!” Luna shouted possessively as his arms had accidentally knocked them askew.
“Scorpius darling, Scorpius, you must stop that. This, this is really not gentlemanly. Same goes for you James, such behavior is most unbecoming to such a lovely kitten.” Draco chided his children when he found them wrestling.
“Sirius, I’m plumb goose-pimply scared.” Remus whimpered as he walked in a circle, turning his back towards Sirius hoping to keep himself safe from a random attack.
“Oh, and thank you so much for offering us your home. Oh. I mean, your pad,” Draco corrected himself. Annoyed at his lack of visual, Scorpius climbed out of bed and into the newly vacated window. “It’s very nice,” Draco complimented from his spot atop the chimney.
I changed up O'Malley's (Harry's) name song to make it more Harry Potter-y so I hope you enjoy! Also a big shout out to moondraconis for being kind enough to beta this chapter fur me!
“Come on, cats, we gotta split.” Pansy called to her gang as they ran out of the alley and onto the sidewalk.
“Careful Madame, please! Dreadfully sorry Madame.” He rushed out the words in a hurry as he realized he had basically started to hug this woman.
A very disheveled and out of breath Lucius opened up the door and spoke between breaths. “Announcing Madame Luna Lovegood.”
“Well, they’re kinda rough, you know, around the edges, but if you’re ever in a jam, wham, they’re right there.”
“Sorry handsome, you know me. Always feeling like I am forgetting to pack something… or finally remembering where I put a surprise new outfit, which means I have to add something before I can leave. I don’t want to leave something cute or sexy behind, especially not for a beach vacation!”
“All right. I’m not.” Harry said while he licked his front paw nonchalantly before turning to look at the twins.
“Will, eh? Will will…” Luna repeats to herself as she swaps out her Spectrespecs for a pair of still odd looking, but far more sensible reading glasses. Luna pulls out a quill and a piece of parchment so that she is ready to take notes.
“What’s going on Remus, what in tarnation you trying to do?” Sirius practically yelled at his partner.
“Oh, no. Not at all,” Draco reassured the black cat, thinking that his heart might explode from such sweet words. “Any man would like it. I…I mean. Even little Scorpius,” Draco said, trying to remain calm.
The goose mumbled drunkenly to himself, his chubby belly drooped enough to cover his feet, and his dark feathers helped him blend into the darkness. He was a rather large goose, bigger than most. He was sure that the cook had been eager to serve him up, but he wasn’t about to be someone else’s dinner. Hagrid righted himself and then wrapped one wing around the lamp post, to hold himself up when he bent to pick up his poor hat. The top had come off slightly and was only attached by a few threads. The base of the top hat was crumpled too. He blew off the dust to the best of his ability, and gently put his hat back on his head. Finally, seeing the cause of the commotion, and the goose standing outside of the restaurant, George commented.
“Harry… I need you to take me. Now.” Draco whimpered, between shallow breaths, every syllable dripping with need.
Draco started to work on his own erection because he wanted to finish at the same time as Harry. Draco’s pleasure was already pushing him to the verge of coming but he had a feeling that Harry would finish inside him soon. A tell tale sign of that came as Harry started to slow down just a little bit and kiss and nip his way down Draco’s back. Harry loved to add more sensations as he got closer to finishing, wanting them to both finish at the same time, or as close together as possible. Draco moaned at the kisses and gasped in pleasure at the nips, still working his own cock, trying to match speed with Harry. That proved impossible however as the man started to pummel him hard and fast once more, so Draco did his best to stroke himself while thrusting back against Harry. It was such a wonderful sensation to be so in sync and in love with another person, that Draco didn’t think it would ever get old. Harry thrust a few more times before roaring out Draco’s name and filling the blond up with his white hot seed. Draco yelled out Harry’s name as he felt his lover fill him to the brim and as he was filled, he felt his own cum leave him forcefully, ripping through his entire body as he orgasmed. Harry stayed inside Draco for a few minutes, catching his breath before gently pulling out of his lover.
Draco packed up his things slowly, as he handed his parchment to Harry to help him place it on Snape's desk. Looking around when he picked up his bag, he noticed that all the Slytherins had exited the class in a very fast manner as well. Harry was making his way back to him as Draco was holding on to his bag.
"Don't think I didn't notice you checking him out in the Great Hall. For your information, I saw him check you out too. And I do think that it's time YOU settle down. And don't give me that crap about not wanting to endanger anyone. And if Draco Malfoy is anymore endangered, he'll be dead. But the main thing is… what do you feel about him?" Ron asked, crossing his legs and placing his hands in front of him. He had been in this position of a 'psychiatrist' for Harry before, waiting patiently while Harry sort out his thoughts and bounce ideas off him.
Draco wondered to himself. He did notice that Dean's eyes kept wandering to Seamus, who was opposite him, during the dinner. Were those two together? No, it didn't seem like they were a couple. Seamus had often flaunted himself as a gay man while he remembered Dean having a girlfriend before. Unless things happened during the summer. And he didn't know any of the two well enough to ask any of such questions. He would just have to file it up at the back of his mind and observe the two for a while.
"What are you looking at?" Draco asked. He came back to the table with the books he needed, but when he saw the seat without Harry, he thought that Harry had left. Then he realized that Harry's bag was still on the table and when he looked around, he saw Harry standing at the window, looking out.
Everyone was staring intently at the dog as it started to become bigger and bigger, finally a human being was seated on the couch the dog previously was on. "This is so much easier to communicate, isn't it? Hi Harry. Merlin! You have grown so tall," Sirius Black commented at he gave Harry a hug, "Hi Ron. Hi Herm. Hi um… I didn't catch the names of the rest."
While he was eating his only slice of toast and looking at his cousin breathe down his share of bacon, toast and eggs, he kept hoping that his uncle would finish his breakfast and they would be on their way. Two days ago his uncle had allowed him to make a trip to Diagon Alley to get his books and stuff for school, and as he was not able to inform his best friends beforehand, he had to make the trip alone. After buying his books and things for potion class, he went to buy some new robes for school as well as bring his old robes for lengthening. He used to be the shortest Sixth Year the previous year. After waiting for so long, he had finally gotten his growth spurt this summer and the running and push-ups that he had been doing every morning had made him quite muscled. This, however, made him outgrow all his clothes. Well, all but his cousin's hand-me-downs as they were so big that no one could outgrow their size. This growth spurt made him to the height of six feet (so he was still shorter than his best friend Ron Weasley, whom Harry last saw before the beginning of summer at taller than six feet and he seemed to be still growing). Harry then exchanged some money to do some shopping out in muggle London, where he could finally get some decent looking clothes and footwear to wear in the future. He walked past some guys who were wearing boots to complement their clothing and managed to get some boots for himself. His last stop was an optician who promised spectacles within half an hour and got a new pair of glasses. He walked out of the shop with his old pair of glasses on his nose and his new pair in a plastic bag. He did not want his uncle and aunt questioning his seemingly abundance in cash so the two days after getting his new things he continued to wear his old things. His uncle did not know that his parents actually left a vault in Gringotts Bank full of gold and he wanted to keep it that way.
The two of them listened against the walls of the compartment as Pansy went on planning torture on Malfoy, with the two bodyguards who currently belonged to her grunting their agreement every now and then, till Pansy announced that she was going to change into her robes as the train was reaching Hogwarts soon. Both boys then relaxed and sat down beside each other.
When everyone finished dinner, they all made their way up to their rooms, with Remus and Sirius following. Or rather, the whole group followed Sirius who was in front with another group of Gryffindors who was trying to pet it. Finally, reaching what they call Study area, Sirius pounced on one of the couches and changed back to human form. Those who did not get the couches just sat on the carpet around the couches, lazy to pull chairs towards the centre. All that is lacking is a fireplace for the cozy atmosphere to be complete. The night before, when everyone was unpacking, Hermione suggested that they each pick a table in the Study area as their own and the shelves above their table will be their own personal book space. This was a good idea as the sleeping areas only had closets for the clothes and no space to keep the books at all. In comparison, Hermione's, Ginny's and Draco's shelves had the most number of books, while Ron's, Seamus's and Harry's space had many Quidditch stuff. After the first day of school, Hermione's area already looked very well-used as she had woke up early in the morning to attempt some studying before breakfast. Neville's desk had a small cactus on it and was next to the window looking out to the Quidditch pitch, which was always left open for air ventilation and for the owls to reach the people in the dorm. Sirius looked around the place.
Day was lying on the floor, as pain surrounded her. How could anyone do this to her? Why? All she could feel was the knife slicing into her flesh till she could no longer differentiate where the pain was coming from. She had stopped screaming, just lying there, hoping the pain would either stop or kill her. Her eyes started to blank out, as the only constant thing was the pain. Suddenly she felt some one spreading her legs, and someone lifting her hips up. The next moment, she felt someone enter her, with a sudden burst of pain from her lower body.
Harry felt Draco's body stiffen even more if possible as he hissed out what he found. "Parkinson. Crabbe. Goyle. Found a dagger belonging to them that was still in that room."
Past experience told the Gryffindor students that the rooms are labeled along the passageway as the first and second years nearest to the common room, their doors facing each other, and the seventh years all the way at the end. Counting the doors, the seventh year dorm room should be after the third pair of oppositely facing doors they come to. However, as they came to the third pair of doors, they realized that there is no other door beyond it. Professor Lupin was waiting in front of a portrait of a boy seated on a lion and playing a charm to a snake using his flute. All the Gryffindors looked at the painting with surprise as the portrait wasn't there the previous year.
"If I can't have sex, you two can't have sex. Harry, stop displaying yourself and go get yourself dressed. Shoo…" Seamus' frustrated voice brought Draco out of his thoughts as Harry winked at him, while being pushed out of the bathroom by Seamus. Seamus then came back into the sinks and started washing himself up.
"Albus came here one month ago telling us that our heirs are actually soul mates so we were kind of waiting for you two to show up. You really took your time progressing in your relationship huh?" Salazar smirked, as the two boys blushed.
At the end of the two hours, the two boys were starting to be exhausted, as doing wandless spell was actually tapping into the raw magical power between them and the strain was starting to show on their faces. Finally they stopped and the two boys collapsed at a corner of the room on the floor, leaning against the wall, resting as they felt the drain of power.
"I need to tell you something." He waited for Harry to turn his eyes to him before continuing. "Just now, when I saw Day's broken wand on the floor of that room, I picked it up. We both were angry and I sort of directed my anger at the wand. All a sudden there was a flash of light and this was in my hand." Draco held out Day's repaired wand for Harry to see.
Draco breathed in shallowly and licked his lips. His mouth had suddenly gone dry as he felt Harry's warm presence lean in close to him, nearly embracing him. He shot a glance at Harry and realized that he merely wanted to copy his notes. He then tried to pull his attention back to the professor who despite having gone on for an hour, seemed to still have relentless energy in the way he talked. Draco hurriedly scribbled the new point that was being brought up by the professor so as to not let Harry know how his presence had affected him. When Harry finished, he leant back into his own seat, catching Draco's grey eyes staring at him. He gave Draco a quick grin and turned to face the professor. Draco, upon seeing his grin, realized that Harry merely leant close to him to copy notes and had no ulterior motives, breathed in deeply before turning his eyes back to Flitwick.
Along the way, Harry snatched the map back from Hermione and being more used to running, he ran ahead, with Ron at his heels. Reaching the almost unlit passageway, he glanced at the map before turning around frantically trying to find Day. "Day! Where are you? The damned map said she's here." By then Draco, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, Seamus and Dean had reached there too, followed by Sirius, who saw them running along the passageway and joined the group, wondering what had happened. Sirius changed back to human form and snatched the map from Harry's hands. Looking at the passageway, then at the map, he motioned Harry to step aside as he moved to stand next to the wall. He stretched his right hand in front of him and pushed his hand firmly against the wall. To the surprise of everyone, his hand went through the wall. The next moment, Harry rushed at the wall, with Draco behind him, but both froze at the sight of Day lying on the floor.
"Um, no. At least, I don't think so. The questions haven't really been set yet. What we are doing this year in Intermediate DADA is to train you to think critically so that you are able to differentiate between right and wrong after you graduate, instead of just blind following."
The party in the Gryffindor Tower was harmful to the ears. It was not only a victory party for the Quidditch match but an engagement party for Seamus and Dean as well. Dean was stunned that Seamus pulled such a trick after the match ended and everyone was stunned by the fact that the person who was notorious for playing the field had just proposed to settle down. Draco and Harry were stunned by the spontaneity exhibited by Seamus. Seamus was about to propose on his broomstick when Harry impulsively helped by casting the levitating spell on him so as to allow him to kneel in mid-air. Even Seamus was stunned by how he himself had acted, although he really wanted to spend the rest of his life with Dean.  The whole wager of who Seamus would settle down with was settled and Neville came back with 5 pouches of gallons, as most people betted that Seamus would not propose to Dean before graduation. He happily handed the money out to Draco, Harry, Ron, Ginny, and kept the last pouch for himself. All Seamus did was roll his eyes at the smirks that everyone threw him and Dean and pulled Dean up to their dorm room, with a few bottles of butterbeer, with whistles following their exit of the common room.
"Harry, what do you think is Draco's sexual preference? We need to get YOU a boyfriend." Seamus grinned impishly at Harry, as Harry blushed.
"Remember the bell? Got the house elves to dig a carpet out for us. They'll give Ron anything." Hermione grinned.
Seamus: Advanced DADA, Advanced Charms, Intermediate Transfiguration, Intermediate History of Magic, Intermediate Herbology
Madam Promfrey answered. "Well, the potion should allow her to sleep till noon tomorrow. But I got to warn you. Some rape victims are very sensitive to the people around her. So she may… "
As he came to the area between Platform Nine and Ten, he casually looked around to see if he could sport any friends. Seeing none, and noting that he still have fifteen minutes to nine o'clock, he leaned on the wall between the two platforms and let himself fall back against it. He passed through the barrier, leaving behind the past and things that he did not want to remember, reaching Platform 9¾, to begin his seventh year in Hogwarts.
Hermione smiled. "Normal people only take them at the end of fifth year. But remember that last year was the first year in which they implemented Mock O.W.L.s for the fourth years. Fourth Years who would like to try the fifth year exams together with the fifth years in order to gauge their own standards are allowed to take the exams. Day took it for fun. They were so surprised that Day could do so well that they asked Day whether she wanted to leave the results of the Mock as that of the real thing."
Draco sighed. "We really can't do anything else worse than that? I want to dig their black hearts out with a spoon." Draco pouted.
"Don't be silly. We thought that… you may not want us near as… we are guys and… Merlin, I'm so sorry. It's our entire fault that they went after you…" Harry leant his forehead against her forehead and let the tears fall.
"Really?" Day looked up, smiling at Draco. He seemed stunned with her sudden change in mood and all a sudden the noise level of the hall went all the way up. Everyone was buzzing with the news that Draco Malfoy was also gay. Everyone around Harry and Draco settled down to have their breakfast, attempting to hide their smiles. Even Hermione had to hide behind the book that she was trying to read. Draco looked around and finally realized what happened.
"Morning, all." He greeted everyone as he looked at his schedule to pack his bag. "Double DADA… free period… lunch… advanced charms…" he muttered as he placed the books he needed into his bag.
"Okay. Advanced Transfiguration for you two is under me for this year. Professor Dumbledore is just here so that people don't think that you are being taught by a dog. You two should be ready for Animagus transfiguration. I think it will help you when you need to escape from Voldemort. So, you guys okay with it?" Both Draco and Harry nodded. "Okay. First and foremost, because we are not informing the Ministry, not a word about this to anyone. Not Ron, not Hermione, not anyone in your dorm. The less people know, the better. And we are going to let you drink a potion that would allow you to see your animagus form for half a minute. Professor?" Sirius turned to face Dumbledore who was now holding two goblets. Sirius passed them to the boys, who looked into the goblet they were each holding, into a potion which is transparent. They stood facing each other, looked at each other, clinked their goblets and drank it together. Sirius was grinning, being excited about seeing the forms, while Dumbledore merely looked curious.
Ron finally slammed his textbook shut and stretched his hands above him. Draco frowned at Ron, who had disturbed him from reading his textbook in peace. Glancing at the clock, he frowned at the time.
"Hey, we haven't even seen that git and you are all talking about nothing else. This is not a good topic. Change topic!" Ron exclaimed.
Her eyes fluttered open, staring at the white ceiling above her. The last thing she remembered was… pain. She turned her head when she felt someone staring at her, and found two pairs of eyes intently looking at her.
"Some of them wanted to learn some chess moves. Most of them are going to analyze tonight's games to find out what a player did to win or lose the game." Day whispered back. Harry's eyebrows rose, wondering not for the first time why this game was so important.
Suddenly he heard a whimper come from the seat next to him, and turned to come face to face with black fur and black liquid eyes. "Hi, Snuffles. Woke up?" Sirius nodded, looking with interest at the food that just appeared on the table. He then looked at Draco and panted.
"All this shows that Hermione has you whipped at seventeen. Imagine how your life is going to be if you married her." A voice drawled from the bed beside Harry's.
"Every Weasley is good at something. Ron is good in chess." Day answered, joining in the scratching of the dog, who was whimpering with pleasure by then.
Harry was starting to find controlling his temper a difficulty. Draco was also getting angry with the professors. He wanted to know what they did to the three animals that did this to Day.
"Um… I…" Dean shot a pleading look at Harry and Harry decided to step in before Dean blurt out anything he might regret.
"Morning." Draco huskily smiled down at Harry. Harry stuck out his tongue and lazily traced patterns on his neck, making him breathe in deeply at the sensation. Harry then single-handedly unbuttoned the shirt of Draco's black silk pajamas, teasingly brushing his hand on Draco's skin at times, as he continued to lick Draco's neck. Finally when the shirt was open, he pulled back and looked at Draco, while still leaning his lower body on Draco. No matter how often he saw Draco's shirt off, he was always struck by the fact that Draco looked beautiful. Especially early in the morning when Draco's hair was messy and he was smiling sleepily up at him. Draco often felt that his body had been damaged, due to the fact that the beatings he had gotten from his father left scars on his back. Harry could remember the first time he saw those scars, after finally persuading Draco to take off his shirt, and how he had nearly wept from seeing them. They were ugly, as line scars showed that his father not only beat him, he whipped him. However, in Harry's mind, those scars were beautiful, because he had survived them. After he saw them that first time, he had kissed the scars and used his tongue to lick them, cherishing them as a part of Draco. Draco had broken down in tears from Harry's actions. Now, as he looked at Draco, he was amazed that both of them had survived till they were so old.
"Let's put it this way. Their fathers tagged behind my father when they were at school. Their fathers were just as horrible as them. My father told their fathers on the way to Hogwarts in their first year to keep thinking in their head how they love to be in Slytherin. It obviously worked. Their sons told me that their father told them to do the exact same thing. They did it, so… there they are. Seems that the sorting hat decided that they were so pathetic, it is pitiful to send them elsewhere. Told that two fools that as well, and they actually used it to boast to me, thinking that it was praise."
"Why is Harry so important that Voldemort would kill so many people to get to him?" Draco translated for Ron.
Harry sat down beside Draco and grinned. "Only you would try to teach Snuffles manners. How was Potions?"
"Oh, it's nothing. I'm keeping you." Day replied. At that moment the owl post came in. Hedwig flew down and landed beside Harry's plate. Harry fed him some bacon and realized that Hedwig just wanted to check on him as she had no letter tied to her claws.
"It's the lodestone in which many of the warding spells of Hogwarts were based on. That's why we have to guard it. It can also warn you when that fake heir attacks Hogwarts. See that golden thread connected to the globe? That thread is connected to Albus, so that when there is an attack, we will send out a warning through that thread and snip it off to prevent people from using that to destroy the stone." Godric answered. The two boys then noticed a thin golden line around the sphere, which was not visible to the eye a moment ago. Both suspected that some one cast an illusion spell to hide the thread and only people who knew about its presence can see it.
"You will realize that Snape is actually a very good judge of character. All the prefects who were chosen are people who don't want to be Death eaters. His reasoning is that in times of the war, we must have at least the prefects to keep the house safe and going, and not apparating to Voldie whenever their Dark Marks burns. Hey, I said Voldie! That name is so much easier to say." Draco grinned. Harry grinned as well. "I mean, no matter when the war starts, there will be younger students in the house. Those who had not been involved by their parents yet. These kids need the prefects around to keep them calm and safe."
"Good, Professor Lupin came back. Finally. Some teacher who does know what he is teaching. The only year that I actually had a good full year of education in that class was the year he taught." Hermione beamed at Ron, who nodded in delight.
Harry nodded, relieved. "I think I better tell you this first. I don't have… much experience. Um… actually… none at all." Harry blushed.
Seamus pushed himself up to look into Dean's eyes. "When I finally got you after two years? Always. I'll always come back to you." He kissed Dean on the lips lightly before leaning back into his previous position, closing his eyes with a sigh.
"Why? First and foremost, your face disgusts me. Secondly, orders from our Great Lord. He said that the three of us will be initiated when we get rid of a good friend of Harry Potter. Seeing that the whole gang seemed to travel around in packs, you were the only one whom we had access to. And lastly, my two good friends here are hot for your body. There is the additional incentive in that when we kill you, the Slytherin will be able to win the Quidditch match. Lots of advantages, so why shouldn't we kill you? Enough talking. Time for some action." Pansy sneered at Day and suddenly punched Day. Day could feel the blood flowing down her nose as she reeled back from the punch. Crabbe and Goyle gripped her robes and started ripping them off, while slapping her face. As her limbs were still unable to move, it was very difficult to fight the two boys who were trying to strip her naked. The two of them were mauling the flesh that they uncovered, making Day want to vomit. Day was screaming for them to stop what they were doing when she saw Pansy pull out a dagger. When Crabbe and Goyle finally got her naked, they stepped back for Pansy who was holding the dagger with a manic look in her eyes. By then, Day was cowering with fear on the floor and screaming for help, while trying to move backwards using her body, but was unsuccessful as Pansy's henchmen pulled her hands and legs to prevent her from moving.
"Well, umm… sorry for calling you out here like this. Just wondering, what happens if I keep… um… dreaming about… someone? What does that mean?" Dean finally asked.
"Did you know that Pansy asked Goyle and Crabbe to beat you up tonight? I was going to find you to warn you. Thank Merlin that you are joining our dorm tonight." Harry commented lightly, in a soft tone so that people from outside this group would not overhear the conversation.
"Tomorrow." Day tucked her schedule into her bag. Everyone sighed with envy, with the exception of Draco, of course, seeing that Draco had been Snape's favorite student for years.
"They are being locked up in different rooms at the moment and had been given potions to sleep till tomorrow morning. We would arrange for a Ministry worker to be here in the morning. However, because they are under-aged, it is unlikely that they will end up in Azkaban. The recently implemented punishment was that they serve in the muggle prison after they had their magical powers stripped from them. They don't know about that yet. They were told by Voldemort that we could not do anything to them because they are too young. We'll have to make other sleeping arrangements for her. Remus, can you go up to their dorm and add one more bed? I think it's better for her to be protected now, better late than never." Dumbledore sighed.
Harry looked at him, smiling. "Read huh?" He said, as he turned to go back to get his bag. Draco checked both books out and the two of them left the library after telling Hermione that they are going back to the dorm. Once they were in their own room, Draco brought the two books to Harry's bed and sat himself on the bed.
"Time doesn't mean anything to a relationship right? It's the emotions behind it all." Harry answered, brushing a few strands of hair behind Draco's ear. In the past two months, Draco had stopped using gel on his hair, once Harry commented that he liked his silvery blond hair soft and free from the stiff constraint of the gel. Day even said after the change that in the unofficial survey did in the school, most of the students found that Draco without his impeccable neat hair was even sexier than before. That and the fact that Harry seemed to exhibit a love for ruffling his unusually blond hair made him throw away his bottle of gel.
Looking up at the Gryffindor players in the skies, he caught sight of Day, going through the strategies. Draco had come to realize that he was quite protective of this 'little sister', after getting to know her better when he was spending time with her in the common room as well as other times when she joined the group for meals. True to her word, she didn't tell anyone about the relationship between Harry and he, and the school only knew about the relationship a month ago, when the two of them strolled into dinner hand-in-hand. Harry even gave Draco a chaste kiss in front of the whole school so as to make sure that everyone knew. He however realized that in the recent one week, she didn't seem as cheerful as before. She had also been quieter in the mornings and when doing her homework in the common room, Draco had caught her staring into space. He didn't want to invade her personal space, so he left it alone.
"Argh… where the hell is it? I hope I didn't leave that at home. Knowing my luck, the first lesson will be double potions with the Slytherins. Now that stupid work assignment is… here! Yes!"
"Dean, move a seat will you?" Harry asked Dean who was seated beside him and Dean immediately moved to make a space between Harry and himself. Harry stood up, feeling the stare of everyone in the Great Hall. He hated attention like this, and he did not like Malfoy very much, but he knew that he had to make a move publicly to accept him, otherwise he may not survive the night in the Gryffindor dorms, much less a year. He hated himself for being the boy-who-lived, but he does know what was expected of him. Somehow the wizarding community viewed him as a 'savior' and he had learnt very early in this school that what he said does carry some weight, and if he accepted Malfoy as a friend in front of the whole school, at least the Gryffindors, Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs would leave him alone for the rest of the year. And strangely enough, he was becoming tired of the rivalry between the two of them, and he knows that having Malfoy on the same side as him would be good for the cause.
Harry saw that he was back in control, so he let go of his wrist and leant back in his couch. "You really need to teach me that."
He felt Draco's hand coming up to caress his cheek, as he looked at him. Looking into his grey eyes, he lowered his mouth to Draco's left nipple, till he was hovering one inch above it. He softly blew over it, seeing the muscle under it tighten. He then heard Draco whimper, before sucking his nipple into his mouth, his teeth tugging lightly on it. Draco arched his chest up in pleasure.
He subconsciously pitied the players, especially Harry. Due to the fact that the two of them deciding that learning how to transform into their animagus form was very important as a means of escape from danger, they had specially requested for Sirius to increase their lessons by adding a session on Monday evening. Between the Quidditch practices, extra Transfiguration lessons and their piling amounts of homework from the professors, all Harry had time to do almost every evening was fall into bed exhausted. The only chance the two actually got to practice new spells and interact was during their limited free periods and on Sunday. His bond with Harry had deepened due to their relationship, even though they had not yet gone all the way yet. They had not really discovered too many new powers, just that the emotional link between the two of them was stronger than before and that the two could actually dream at night together. Very often, they would comfort each other in their dreamscape when the other had nightmares. They also discovered that they could now handle charms and spells better than before and learn them faster too. Harry also discovered himself to be improving in his potion-making skills, such that Professor Snape could not really find many problems during his classes to deduct points for.
“Professor Moody!” came a Scottish, shrill scream. Thank Merlin, McGonagall had arrived. From the looks of things, she was in the middle of giving him a good telling off. “We do
Sirius paused a little before he could formulate an answer. “Yeah, I’m fine, kid. Go hang out with Harry, for a bit.”
“You’re incredible.” Draco took his eyes off the world for a moment to lock eyes with Harry, who was looking sheepish. “I’m sorry, that came out of nowhere. You just look really pretty - handsome - whatever.” He blushed deeper and Draco’s breath caught in his throat.
Remus didn’t know what his son was thinking about, but it was clear he was focusing on it very hard, his lips were pursed and eyebrows furrowed. “
Sirius nodded and turned to Harry. “When we thought that your parents were in danger, the Order decided to enlist a ‘Secret Keeper’, who would know where you three were staying. It was going to be me, but, without telling anyone I… passed the job on to Pete.” He wiped his face with his free hand in a massaging movement, as if he had some kind of headache. “I thought I was being smart, I didn’t even tell my bloody
“A riddle! Amazing, I love riddles!” He dissected it as Harry watched calculatingly. Honestly, the security for the whole place was pretty lax. If a group of first years could crack it, no wonder an adult with a full magical education could. The riddle in and of itself was pretty basic, the answer was clear to him in minutes. He passed a small vial to Harry.
Flint shook hands with the captain of the Gryffindor team, Oliver Wood, and they held their gaze for perhaps a little longer than was necessary. He privately thought that the pair clearly harboured some unaddressed feelings for one another, but held is tongue as he realised that he wasn’t one to talk.
“Well - in that case, Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own? Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this. I am very disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all, you’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.” Hermione left and McGonagall turned to Professor Snape as if to say,
“I love you too.” It felt too much like goodbye, but they didn’t have the time for much more. Draco lifted their intertwined hands to his face and kissed the back of Harry’s before he let go and ran, arms out in front of him, feeling around. Suddenly, they hit a wall and he backed himself into a corner, heart beating so loud it could break out of his chest. He held up his hand like a visor and peeked at the scene ahead. Thankfully, the creature was facing the other way and all he could see was it’s gargantuan body. Thick and green like a tree trunk, and scaly too.
“Alright.” Draco gave Harry a quick smile and ran through the wall, grinning with poorly contained excitement.
“Bye, Ron!” Draco didn’t bother watching him leave, instead in deep thought over an important matter.
’ first, then we can look up ice.” He tried it, nothing came up but a list of fire protective spells.
Draco kneeled next to his friend and put his hand on his shoulder. “Harry, I don’t want you to freak out, and I’m sorry we have to cut our visit short, but we think we might have seen Lucius nearby. Moony has gone to check but he reckons we should go home, you can have another minute though, okay?” He took a breath to calm his pounding heart. Honestly, it was all getting a bit much for him. In the previous years, most of the important stuff seemed to be happening to Harry, rather than to him. For some reason, Merlin decided that third year was the time when his murderer ex-Death Eater father should escape from Azkaban and he should be forced to face his worst fear and apparently greatest desire once more. Not only whatever the hell was going on with the method of murder he used in the mirror and boggart.
“Oh! I LOVE it!” He jumped up and down on the balls of his feet in possibly the cutest way ever, in Harry’s opinion, and hugged Harry from behind. “I just love love.”
The excitement of the day had made Harry all but forget his previous worries about getting Draco in trouble and Gilderoy Lockhart. He fell blissfully into a deep sleep, welcoming the feeling of home that Hogwarts gave him.
“Well. I suppose I’ll go first. Then Harry and Ron, then Draco you can go, okay?” Everyone nodded and Hermione took a deep breath before plunging down. The boys heard a faint
There was one particular incident which happened in the Great Hall, when a Gryffindor first year approached him at the Slytherin table, and asked for a photograph. It made him feel awkward and uncomfortable, especially when Draco sarcastically whispered something to the rest of the table about how blessed he was to be sitting next to the famous ‘Boy Who Lived’. Their interaction was interrupted, though, by the arrival of Gilderoy, in all his finery. He was an ass. He primped and preened and pulled Harry flush against his side, grinning for the camera, and had the audacity to leave the insinuation that Harry was getting too big for his boots.
“Why don’t you sit down, Dobby?” said Harry, Draco didn’t have time to tell him that the elf wouldn’t take well to that, because he had already started banging his head repeatedly against the leg of Draco’s desk.
“Sneaking out to go to the library, he’s got some Moony in him after all.” Said Sirius through a mouthful of cereal.
The final game of the Quidditch Season was here and Harry was stressed. Draco could see the way that his best friend ran his fingers through his birds nest hair, getting them stuck along the way, and his nail biting habit had reached new lengths, but for the most part, Harry just seemed scared. The boy had a lot on his mind and Flint wasn’t helping in the slightest. With the Quidditch Cup on the line, the team had practise every other night and Harry was being worked harder than he had ever been worked. But the day of the game finally arrived and Draco’s parents came to see.
Harry was happy for him, and felt significantly lighter by the time that the first Quidditch match rolled around. Flint was pacing up and down the Slytherin table, ensuring that everyone ate a good breakfast, before they head out to the field, where he proceeded to regurgitate a speech that he had clearly written the night before. Once Adrien Pucey had finally cut him off, they strutted out onto the field. Harry had his eyes glued on the stands, where he could see Draco surrounded by their group, decked out in Slytherin green. He was breathtaking. The sight of him actually calmed Harry’s pounding heart, which felt like it was going to rip itself out of his chest.
Draco’s face was livid all the same, and Harry was sure that he would run off and tell his parents, which wasn’t a bad thing. He trusted Remus and Sirius as though they were his flesh and blood, but he wanted to tell them himself, which was what he told Draco, and the boy seemed to listen.
A deadly silence fell over the table until McGonagall slammed her fist on it. “Absolutely not!” she yelled. “Hogwarts is not Azkaban! Imagine if one of the students thinks it's funny to go and mess around with them, what if they end up scarred for life by it? Or kissed, even? We have no way of controlling the creatures!”
“Draco, keep your voice down.” Pansy said, glancing at Moody, who had now turned completely around and was staring at the group head on.
The boy seemed to take this a passable excuse and returned to his staring into nothingness. As did Remus.
” he whispered, Draco squeaked, and he himself was startled when what came out his mouth wasn’t English, instead a strange hissing sound.
“Well, I told Harry about it.” He gestured to Harry. “When Sirius, James and Peter found out about… you know.” He chuckled quietly.
The man ducked out from behind the tree and faced him head on. “I think you know full well there’s a reason.”
“Astute.” quipped Draco, before realising what he had just done, but the memory didn’t seem to have heard him, or didn’t seem to care, as he was gazing down at the heap of clothes in bemusement.
“Harry, you do have a link to Voldemort. I very much doubt that he only left a scar on your head that night in Godric’s Hollow.” Draco sighed and sat down next to his friend. “Look, I have to deal with scared idiots all the time. And, trust me, it gets better. It only proves who your real friends are.”
“Why don’t you carry on flipping through that book, I need to go check on Draco and Moony.” Sirius stood up and moved towards the door, but just before he left he added. “When I come back I’ll tell you about our work with Peeves.”
“I suppose so.” They both knelt down to Dobby’s level and tried to catch his eye as the conversation continued around them. “Are you okay, Dobby?” asked Harry.
“He would. But what would we do with Harry?” Remus was agitated, the full moon was coming up and he didn’t need the extra pressure. Draco had apologised at the end of his letter, actually, for stressing him out.
That night, Harry searched for the Chamber of Secrets with his special book, but nothing showed up, only a warning that he shouldn’t be asking. That was an annoying thing it tended to do when he looked for something too dangerous or stupid, it would give him a sassy comment or two, probably for his own good. But from that week on, it was now common knowledge that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were working together to rid the school of Muggleborns, through the use of Slytherin’s Monster.
Tell me what you want from this fic (couples, stupid tropes I could fit in the background) It's going to have a happy ending because I don't have the stomach for a sad one, but it is going to be pretty angsty along the way so tell me some fluff you'd like to see to soften the blow :)
After a little while of Harry explaining to Draco the mechanics of a camera, they took a photo. There was no way of seeing it, however, because they needed to develop it, something that Draco very much looked forward to learning about.
Draco knew what Blaise was referring to but he decided not to give a direct answer. He needed to know the reason why Blaise was asking before giving the answer. "Who was what?"
The rest of the DADA lesson was more discussion on the Dark Arts, and they even evaluated the different reasons that might push Gryffindors, Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs towards using Dark Arts. No homework was given when Professor Lupin dismissed the class.
"No fair. No wonder you like his lessons so much. Is the Advanced Potions that bad? Heard that you are the only one taking that. I may be considering that specialization next year too." Day nonchalantly reached out her hand to snatch a chicken drumstick from the food bowls that just appeared. By then the rest of the seventh year Gryffindors had drifted in and Ron sat down opposite Day, hearing her last comment.
By then all the guys were in the room. Ron just sat down on his bed as it was not the first time Seamus rambled off such questions. But Seamus was the only guy who did not notice that every other guy in the room shot a glare at Dean, whose face seemed to pale when Seamus asked the question. He bit his lip when he saw the frown on both Harry's and Draco's face. Even Neville was frowning at him.
"Wow, you did this?" Draco had the habit of enchanting the canopy of his bed at the beginning of every school year to show the outside at different times of the day. In the morning, it would show an outside scene of sunrise. In the evening, it would show the sunset. At the current moment, as Harry looked up with an entranced expression, the canopy was showing the night sky with all the stars and the moon. It was like lying outdoors.
The twins helped them load their trunks onto the train, and got off the train. Harry then looked at Ron and Hermione who were sitting opposite him, cuddling and sighed. "Ron, Herm, we are barely out of the station and you two are cuddling already. Herm, you just spent two weeks in his house, you are behaving like you haven't seen him for two months! What have you two been doing?" Hermione and Ron both blushed as they glared at the boy sitting opposite them.
"Lovely breakfast, wasn't it?" He commented, patting his stomach. Everyone smiled, while Hermione frowned. "Hmm… Seventh year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws. I took you lot a few years back right? As I start out for every year, I need to warn you that as a professor here, I'm not here to dictate. I know things that you don't know, due to my experiences, but you may know things I don't know, because no professors know everything. Facing a seventh year class means that I have this year as a last chance to educate you in terms of certain things that you may face when step out of Hogwarts. And looking at the curriculum that you had handled in the past six years, especially due to the constant changing of professors, you are not THAT prepared for the outside world. Some of you may make use of DADA in your future careers, as Aurors, or even part of the Ministry. For people who don't intend to use this aspect of magic, it will be useful to at least know how to handle the magical dark creatures out there, for your safety. However, in view of the fact that Voldemort had returned, I think that the only thing anyone needs to do is to think of one thing. The choice. Don't think just because you are still a student, you can push the choice of joining what we call the Dark or the Light till your graduation. As young Mr Malfoy had shown us over the summer that the Dark had started to recruit. Likely from people around you. People who is of the same age as you. People who could even be sleeping in the same dorm room as you. So one thing you need to decide is that would you want to follow the Dark or the Light? And if you want to follow the Light, what can you do to ensure your own safety above all else? Throughout the year, you will realize that DADA is no longer just learning about magical creatures or the unforgivable curses. The professors will be trying to link all seven years of your education in all classes. We may have what we call as joint classes, where you may incorporate your Charms or even Transfiguration education into your DADA classes or assignments. We will be having many discussions to train you to be able to think for yourself. Understand?" He looked around and caught some of the students nodding.
The only people that left in the room were Harry, Ron and Hermione. The first one who spoke first was Hermione. "Umm… maybe Neville is not as… clueless as we thought. I'm… going to go unpack. Night, Ron." She gave Ron a peck on his cheek and headed towards her room.
"Why do we have to go to the library? Second day of school." Harry said, with Hermione pulling his hand and Draco pushing him from the back.
Both of them turned to Harry and grinned, before turning to each other. "Good game, Malfoy." Ron smirked.
He smiled to himself, just as Professor Flitwick dismissed the class and reminded them to hand in their summer assignments.
Suddenly the door opened and a blond man and a black haired man walked in hand-in-hand. They paused at the door, staring at the two boys as the two boys stared back at them. Then the blond man spoke.
When the majority of them had finished the dessert, Harry noticed Professor Lupin heading towards their group with Snuffles in front of him. Snuffles stopped to allow some fourth and Fifth year girls to pet and scratch him, with Remus waiting for him patiently. Finally they reached Harry.
Harry read what Draco wrote and turned to stare at him. He then noticed that Draco's face had gone emotionless. He had always thought that he himself had a childhood that was not very good compared to many people, but at least his uncle never really beat him up. All he did was to ignore and insult him. That was why when Draco insulted him, he didn't really mind, as he was used to it. But to be beaten till there were scars or even worse, and to be given that kind of treatment by your own father… Harry licked his suddenly dry lips. Draco saw his reaction and snatched the parchment back to write something.
When Harry reached the infirmary with Day in his arms, he found the nurse Madam Promfrey worriedly waiting at the door for them. She hurried him to place Day on a bed and asked Harry to leave the room, so that she could do a documentation of the injuries. From the descriptions that Ron gave, seeing that Day was found naked and injured, it was likely that there was rape and assault involved, so it was now a criminal case. She brought an automatic-writing quill out on a parchment, as she started to give descriptions of the injuries Day had, while she healed her cuts on the body. The quill wrote down every single word she dictated. She then collected bodily fluid as evidence of the rape, as well as for analysis.
"Parkinson, what do you want? Let go of me! Someone will know when I'm missing." Day tried to not betray her fear, as she stared at Pansy who was holding her wand.
The trip was rather short, September the first happening to be a Sunday, causing the traffic to be smooth. Harry actually reached King's Cross Station at eight fifteen, giving him an additional forty-five minutes till his train. His uncle did not even bother to get out of the car to say good-bye and as soon as the door of the car slammed behind Harry, he drove off. Harry couldn't be happier. Looking at the station, he grinned to himself as he went off in search of the restrooms. First he took off the atrociously big t-shirt and jeans and put on a tight-fitting shirt that he bought two days ago, as well as jeans that fit him better. Then he took off his old glasses and put on his new ones. He exited the cubicle to throw away the old t-shirt and jeans, as well as all the clothes that once belonged to his cousin. Then he put his old glasses into his trunk to keep it (he just could not bring himself to throw away the pair as one of his best friends once commented that it seemed to be a Harry Potter trademark). Looking at himself in the mirror, he was quite satisfied with what he saw. The thinner metal wire frame of his new glasses brought more emphasis to his emerald eyes and make him look less childish, his messy hair was styled such that the scar was being covered and his clothes seemed to emphasize the muscles he had gained from his workout as well as the tanned complexion he had gained from his aunt forcing him to work in the garden all summer. The final touch to the whole outfit was a change of footwear from sneakers to boots. He stashed his sneakers in his truck and zipped it up. One last look at the mirror and his watch, he picked up his things and left the restroom.
Harry: Advanced DADA, Advanced Charms, Advanced Transfiguration, Intermediate Potions, Intermediate History of Magic
Harry nodded. "We started out planning our so called next step regarding Voldie. Then… I blurted out that I like him. Both of us agreed to take things slowly. We don't want to rush. And… well… we kissed. And it was perfect." Harry was relieved that Sirius didn't seem to disapprove of the relationship.
"Yeah. We didn't even need to teach you." Godric answered. The two boys blushed and Harry wondered how they were going to leave. As if Godric could read his mind, he answered. "If you want to leave, you just have to imagine yourself back in your body. Feel free to visit us by imagining yourself down here. It won't happen when you make love again." He grinned. The two boys smiled and waved goodbye to the two guardians and imagined themselves back in their bodies in their room.
Ron laughed, "Scold her, my foot. Snog her to death is more like it. But at least Nev is a really nice guy, unlike that disgusting Malfoy type…"
He thought to himself. Fred and George graduated from Hogwarts two years before and were what you term as 'people who never grow up' as they were big pranksters when they were in school. They were now operating a joke shop in Diagon Alley which was quite profitable. Harry was even their first investor. It seemed that in times when there was an evil overload threatening the lives of people they felt that they should be able to take a few jokes, hence the success of the shop. Last that Harry heard, they were planning to open a branch of the shop in another wizarding village. However, as Harry stayed with his relatives for the summer and they absolutely hated magic and owl post, Harry did not get the chance to get much news about the wizarding world.
"I don't know. Depends on what you want? You want me to stop flirting with people?" Seamus smiled into Dean's neck.
Seeing the sunshine grin plastered on Day's face, Draco was suddenly grasped by a wave of protectiveness for her. Somehow, in the two months that he was here, he had gained the family that he never had.
"Hermione. It's the first day. No homework yet. How can you be reading a book now?" Hermione lowered her book slightly and glanced at Draco for a second, before continuing her reading.
"I wanted to talk to you yesterday, remember? When it was eleven o'clock and you were not back from your detention, we got worried. Then there was this special map that showed the whole of Hogwarts and the position of the people in the castle as well. We checked it and… found that you seemed to be injured. We rushed out of the dorms like a herd of bulls after us, as all eight of us came out to search for you. And then, when we found you…" Draco broke off, as the sight of Day lying there all bloody flashed in front of his eyes.
"Armadillo bile, frog's eyes, powdered Billywig stingers, dewinged Lacewing flies and sliced leeches." Professor Snape nodded and started droning on and on about how the combination of the ingredients and the process of boiling the potion at which particular temperature and the duration made the portion the way it was. Harry could tell that Professor Snape really loved potions. He managed to spend the next one and a half hour telling them about the potion, and everyone was scribbling like mad on their parchments to catch as many things as they could of what the professor had recited. The class was strangely quiet, as every time a question was asked, Hermione never looked up from her parchment. All the Gryffindor students were frowning away at Hermione, wondering if she was feeling ill. Finally Professor Snape dismissed the class and all the students rushed to hand in their summer homework and to exit the class. No one in their right presence of mind would want to stay back after Snape's class.
"His parents passed away. ALL his relatives passed away. Word's out that his parents said something wrong to You-Know-Who and he was so angry that he killed them all. He's the ONLY Malfoy left." Seamus collapsed beside Harry and cuddled up to him. Harry just let him be as always while all the people in the compartment frowned at Seamus' behavior. He had the tendency to think that just because both Harry and he were gay so they could cuddle when both were unattached. Harry did notice that Dean was trying to avoid looking at the two of them. Seamus continued, not caring about the others, but staring at Harry, "Oh Harry, you have grown so much! Hmm… promise me you will lend me this shirt one of these days? I think I'm drooling…"
"I'll get Dumbledore." Sirius said as he threw the map at Draco and changed back to his dog form and left.
"Don't bother. She's Hermione. If she isn't nagging all of us about homework and study, then there is something wrong." Draco answered.
Passing through the barrier, the first thing he saw was the Hogwarts Express. People were boarding it, trying to find compartments for themselves. Harry looked around, trying to sport familiar faces. Then he saw a group of four redheads. Smiling, he walked towards the group. It seemed that Ron and his sister Ginny Weasley made the trip to the station with their twin older brothers Fred and George Weasley this year.
"I don't mind. I knew what she was like before I liked her. That way she can't complain when the matches start." Ron let his head fall on Hermione's shoulders and grinned. Everyone laughed at that, knowing that when the matches arrive, Ron would be thinking of Quidditch every single moment of the day.
Forty-five minutes later, Ron was perspiring, while Draco looked calm and collected. By the fifteen-minute mark, when the whole common room had not heard Ron say 'Checkmate', they had realized that there was a very interesting chess game going on. By the half-hour mark, Harry came to sit down beside Draco and Hermione sat down beside Ron. Sirius was looking at the two players with big eyes. Ron was actually frowning. The atmosphere of the whole common room seemed to be so tense, as everyone wanted to know the victor of the game. Ron was staring intently at the chess board, while Draco was staring at Ron's face. The clock on the wall chimed ten, as Sirius got up, to go for his rounds around the castle. Harry silently got up and let Sirius out, whispering "six-thirty tomorrow" to remind Sirius for the run. Everyone continued waiting for another five minutes, until, Draco cleared his throat, making many in the common room jump. Ron looked at Draco.
"Most likely because Draco had to be taken out of his house, and they had to do a re-voting. You can't have a Head Boy who is not of any house, can you?" Hermione answered.
"And also that it shouldn't be just because they are Gryffindors, they are okay or just because they are Slytherins, they are not okay. Get what I mean? House prejudice should not be taken into account here."
"The lure of power. The use of dark spells keep giving the power to the caster. It gets addictive." Neville said. Professor Lupin nodded.
"Yeah, it helps me relax. At night when I can't sleep, I'll just stare up at it and look at the stars. It's quite peaceful." Draco whispered.
His uncle went to the door and frowned at the empty owl cage as he opened the door. "Where's that damned thing that is supposed to be in the cage?"
"Give me a while and I repay the favor." Dean lazily whispered, dropping a kiss on Seamus' shoulder. He didn't want to move at that moment as Seamus felt so right in his arms. Seamus shook his head. "Why ever not?"
Harry made sure the bed curtains were closed properly before waving his hand, casting a locking, repelling and silencing spell. He then turned to his right, staring at the blond boy who was lying curled up beside him. He shifted slightly so that he was facing Draco and closed his eyes to rest. He could tell that Draco was going to wake up soon. Maybe it was due to the terror of being hunted by an evil overlord, that the two of them never needed much sleep at night. Ron used to wonder how they could wake up that early in the morning as Ron normally needed Hermione to literally drag him out of bed. Feeling Draco's affection over their link was Draco's way of greeting him every morning and he now felt a familiar wave of affection wash over him as his arms tightened slightly around Draco. Draco's head was conveniently tucked under Harry's chin as Harry felt Draco plant a soft kiss on his collarbone exposed by the neckline of his pajamas.
"It's not important. What's more important is that you are here with me NOW and I'm never going to let you go. I'm going to parade you in front of the whole school tomorrow to tell them that Seamus Finnegan is not going to fool around anymore. And they can settle that stupid wager I heard going around regarding my love life that they think I don't know about. I love you Dean." Seamus started to drift off to sleep.
As the water in the shower cubicle started, Seamus looked at the mirror at his own image, as he continued to brush his teeth. His appearance did not change much in the past few months. However, he felt that he seemed to have matured greatly mentally in the past few months. In the previous years, his life in the Gryffindor tower was limited to having fun, studying, bitching about potions lessons, and at the end of the year, maybe there would be an influx of house points earned by some terrifying adventure undergone by some of his housemates, which was happening right under his nose. It was until last year when he realized that his dormmate was not a really normal one, like Dean, but someone who did not go searching for trouble, and attracted trouble like a crazed bludger. He was never so involved with security meetings that Hermione stressed they should have, till a few months ago. The general consensus was that since the adults were not willing to share the information with them, treating them like children, they would come up with additional security measures to ensure their escape should the castle be attacked, and keep the secrets to themselves. Although none of them agreed with the notion of running away, except Draco, they agreed on the importance that their key concern was to stay alive so as to plan and fight a battle on their own terms. The cooperation in the whole group was good as every one knew what they were supposed to do. When Day was brought into the plans, she built up on the cunning component that was more lacking in the planning, even when Draco and Ron were good strategists.
Harry spoke up. "There is nothing we can do till we really know what THEY are doing. And we don't really have many spies with Voldie because it's not safe for them. And everything did seem quiet. Voldie and the Death Eaters didn't even seem that stupid that they attack Hogwarts. What can we really do now?"
Neville nodded, as Ron went back to his DADA essay that was due three days ago, and both Harry and Draco closed their eyes and rested their heads against the back of the couch. Their hands drifted towards each other and clasped together as they relaxed in the cozy common room, in the midst of their friends.
Day wasn't that hungry. She was chastising herself for all the mistakes she made that morning. Looking down at the group at the stands, and how everyone seemed to be with their beloved ones, she suddenly felt really lonely up in the sky. As an only child, she would have thought that she would be used to the loneliness. It didn't seem that bad when she reached Hogwarts, when she was surrounded by people, mainly the fact that she had friends here. And she did recently gain a 'brother'. She then recalled what happened on the first day of school, when she teased Draco, wanting to know what Draco's sexual preference was. She was so elated when Draco and Harry paired up in a relationship. However, casting another look at the group at the stands, she noticed that almost everyone was paired up. Ron was chatting with Hermione while Harry was resting by leaning on Draco and Draco was wiping Harry's perspiration off his forehead. Seamus had his head on Dean's shoulders and even the other players had friends chatting with them.
The three remaining people stared at the closed door. "You know what the really amazing part is? The two of them did the spells and transformations in perfect coordination, without any talking. I know that they have a mind link, but it's only emotions. How did they do that?" Remus said, turning to Dumbledore, as Sirius changed back to his dog form.
"Why do you want to know?" A voice came from the side. Both of them turned to face Day who was hovering near the two on her broomstick. "I ask again, why do you want to know?" Day asked, staring at Blaise, as she landed on the stands and got off her broomstick, sitting down beside Draco. Draco passed her a towel and a water tumbler. He then stared at her, noticing from the corner of his eye that Blaise was staring at her too. She just drank from the tumbler in cool composure as she waited for his answer. She finally turned back to stare at Blaise.
Day suddenly felt her heart tightened, as the tears that she had been trying to hold back in the past week overwhelmed her and flowed down her cheeks. She burrowed her head on Draco's chest and started sobbing silently. All Draco and Harry could do was to be there, comforting her with their presence. She finally stopped crying, pulling back from the three-person embrace and smiled up at the two guys. She suddenly felt lighter than she woke up that morning, knowing that no matter what the future holds, she would still have the two of them to count on. She then pushed the two away and headed to the sink to wash her face. Lifting her face to look into the mirror, she grinned at the two boys using the mirror and said, "I'm thirsty and hungry. Shall we go out to join them? And hope that Ron left me some food."
"Day, you kept us, remember? No matter what happens in the future, please remember that you said that and we are holding you to the promise. That means that we will be there when you need us. Not every moment, yes, but whenever you need company, all you need to do is to tell us. Okay?" Harry continued softly.
"Two months. Obviously, Draco isn't a frisky dog like you." Remus teased his boyfriend. This time it was Sirius who blushed as the two boys grinned at his embarrassment. "But seeing that the emotional link have developed into the ability to do some wandless magic, it shows that your magic is melding more completely. Take your time with the relationship thing. But let us just see what other spells you can do without the wand."
The four of them entered the classroom just as the professor of the class, a ghost called Professor Binns appeared. Harry motioned Draco to the corner furthest from the professor as he had some questions to ask him and now was as good a time as any. Once Professor Binns started lecturing, Ron laid his head down and closed his eyes, ready to take his nap before lunch. Ron was not actually supposed to be in this class, as he dropped it after his OWLS. He was just here to keep his girlfriend company while it is his free period, seeing as it is no different from him going all the way back to the dorms to take a short nap. Hermione started taking notes for the class. Dean took out his sketchbook and pencil and started sketching, and Seamus started following Ron into the dream world. Harry took out a piece of parchment and wrote something on it before passing it to Draco, who wrote a reply before passing it back, starting a 'written' conversation.
By then the group had reached the two of them and Harry sat down on the other side of Draco. The whole group was treated to the sight of Draco Malfoy opening and closing his mouth like a goldfish and a pair of doe-like eyes staring unblinking up at him. The whole group, in fact the whole table, heard the question and were all waiting with anticipation for his answer. After another five seconds of silence from Draco, Day decided to shift to Plan B. She started to blink a few times and the sides of her mouth turned downwards. She whimpered softly like an injured puppy and looked at Draco with eyes that looked like that of a kicked puppy. She then looked down at her lap and said softly in a hurt tone, "You don't want to tell me huh?" and sighed. She then shifted to face the table and looked at her plate, like she was going to cry. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a panicked look appear on Draco's face.
"Um… Due to the fact that we didn't have access to the ingredients, when we tried it back then, we didn't use the potion. We just took things as we transformed. It's harder, but the only resources we had then were ourselves. But, even if we took the potion, together, the animagus forms that the potion allows us to see would NOT have interacted with each other." Sirius said.
"Harry, good idea. I'll join you." Dean hurriedly added and ushered Harry out of the door. Once out of the door, he pulled Harry till he came to an empty compartment and they went in.
"Did I hear Neville say that there is a wager on my love life?" Harry finally said, after they finished laughing.
The three made their way to the Quidditch Pitch and Harry did some warm-up. He then did some push-ups and sit-ups before starting for his run. All through his warm-ups, both Seamus and Draco were silent, staring at him exercise. Only when he left them at the stands for his run did they relax in their seats.
Ron looked at Draco and lifted his eyebrow. Draco shrugged his shoulders. Ron turned back to the two boys and nodded. "Okay, when?"
"Sirius, any idea what I'm going to do with my wand? I don't have any place to tuck it in." Harry said to the dog. The dog seemed to look around and then transformed back to his human form in mid-stride.
All these were observed by Dean who was seated behind Harry. He even caught the worried look that appeared on Draco's face when Draco turned to face the front.
"Harry! Didn't get to talk to you last night. You should have heard the speech that Prof. gave to the whole house. And great show last night. All the lower years were awed by the performance that you and Malfoy gave in the Great Hall. Hey Malfoy!" she cheerfully exclaimed, while pulling Harry out of the common room by his hand.
Harry’s green eyes sparkled in the sunlight as he jumped from the ground onto the bridge above where Draco stood transfixed, watching this gorgeous cat in awe. Harry pranced about a narrow beam on the side of the bridge as he continued his song.
Rosmerta turned away to restart her truck, turning the crank angrily. Draco watched from the tall grass, a look of concern on his face. He couldn’t believe what Harry had just done! But the human seemed to have calmed down a little bit, and all three of his children had also stepped out from their hiding spot. Harry Potter strutted behind the other side of the truck, talking to Draco and his kittens, like everything was perfectly normal, and he hadn’t just come close to dying.
“Hey, wait for me! You don’t know the way!” Ron yelled at the stampede of cats as he jumped from the crate and gave chase. It wouldn’t help anyone if they went to the wrong house.
“You’re not gonna believe this. But it’s a one-wheeled haystack. Hey, there it goes. Come on! After it!” Sirius ordered as they charged down the road, following the haystack intensely.
James and Albus were back on the piano, side stepping fancily over the keys. Crossing one paw in front of the other to take their steps, still wanting to mimic the Pans and Harry duo.
Soon all of the animals nearby were singing along, and the chorus got so loud that Sirius could hear it out on his farm. His ear stood up to listen closer for a minute before he said anything to his partner. They joined in the song as well, but with howls rather than singing about being a cat, because they enjoyed being dogs. As the final note died away, Remus scratched his chin and spoke to Sirius.
“Harry! Harry over here!” Draco called anxiously. Harry saw where Draco was and lifted little Scorpius up higher to get ready to toss the kitten up to him. Draco caught Scorpius.  He pulled Scorpius up quickly, onto the branch with him. But Scorpius was dripping wet and slipped for a second. Draco caught him easily and snuggled the kitten close to his body. Draco scruffed Scorpius and carried him to dry land, where Albus and James were just now arriving on their shorter legs. Draco sat Scorpius safely up against a boulder and ran to check on Harry, worried that the cat who had saved her kitten might well drown for his efforts.
Harry gasped as his backside touched the sand, but that gasp soon became a moan as Draco’s hand found Harry’s cock and started to work it with quick, short strokes. Harry broke their kiss, gasping for air as his hand started to work Draco in return. Draco moaned loudly at the contact and both men started to thrust in time with each other, as if they were made to make love together. Harry moaned Draco’s name longingly and Draco kissed and nipped at Harry’s neck in response. Before long, Draco had summoned a tube to him and managed to lube up Harry, and was waiting, rather impatiently, for Harry to take him. Harry was enjoying Draco’s kisses though and loved teasing the blond, so he planned to take his time. Harry’s hand slowed its pace, wanting to prolong his teasing of Draco, and get his lover primed and ready to go. Draco’s breaths came in short bursts as Harry worked him and eventually he could no longer think well enough to kiss Harry’s neck, Draco could only feel his intense pleasure and worry about coming too early.
Scorpius’s eyes got wide at Harry’s words and he sat up at the end of the bed, trying to hear more as the adults moved out of the window, still talking.
“But someday we might meet a tough alley cat.” Albus supplied from his spot atop the table. Then he jumped down gracefully and started to meow, shake and spit all at the same time. His best impersonation of an alley cat.
They were so busy looking ahead of them, that neither dog looked down to see Lucius’s abandoned shoes directly in their path. Sirius’s long legs stepped over the shoes but Remus didn’t lift his paws high enough, and his back feet got stuck inside the squeaky shoes. He kept walking as if nothing had happened, though, and as the squeaky sound reached his ears again he whispered to his partner, “Hey, Sirius, it’s them shoes again.”
“With a muggle in the act, you can set music back, to the olden days,” Pans and Harry sang together. They mimicked a wand being used and broken as they did so. Scorpius chimed in, dancing along with them, pretending he himself had a wand.
Meanwhile, as Draco was defending his honor, Lucius was putting his deviant scheme into action. “Rock-a-bye kitties, bye-bye you go. La la la la, and I’m in the dough!” Lucius sang to himself as he added an entire bottle of sleeping tablets into the cats’ milk. “Oh Lucius, you sly old fox!” He continued humming to himself as he put in the final ingredients. Though his plan was nearly ruined when he tried to taste test the mixture.
“Oh thank goodness. Oh, are you all right?” Draco asked his third son as he returned to their basket. He started to groom the ginger kitten as he awaited a response.
“Yes, Monsieur Potter?” Draco responded calmly, not wanting to get his hopes up. For all he knew, they were simply heading the wrong way and the alley cat wanted to correct them. But Draco desperately hoped that Harry would join them. He was very intrigued by this black cat, and for some reason Harry made him feel safe.
After a nice long rest upon a comfortable bed, all of the kittens were ready for the trip back home. Draco was less worried, and woke up feeling refreshed even as his heart was breaking at the thought of never seeing Harry again. Harry greeted everyone happily, masking his pain as best he could, trying to focus only on the joy Draco and his kids would get from being back home. Their happiness meant everything to him so he would ensure that they arrived safe and sound. After a quick breakfast, the small clowder set off for the fancy district of Paris, where Madame lived in her mansion. The walk from Harry’s pad to their mansion was not near as long as their walk from the day before and as they rounded a corner, the kittens ran ahead, knowing home was close by. Harry paused to take it all in, amazed at the houses and just the general cleanliness of the area around him.
There was an empty seat beside Dean. Harry motioned Dean to pass the empty plate in that seat to him. He then piled some more chicken wings, some potatoes and pastries onto the plate and lowered it for Sirius to eat. Sirius wagged his tail furiously, barked once in gratitude and started gobbling the food on the plate.
"No, Harry," Dumbledore cut him off, "I now have to do another spell. Allow me." Dumbledore then muttered a spell while pointing his wand at Harry, and all a sudden, a golden thread sprang out and twirled a few rounds around Harry. It then went flying towards Draco and twirled a few rounds as well, before heading back to Dumbledore's wand and the thread disappeared. Dumbledore then sighed.
"No Hegwig, no letter today. Fly to Hogwarts' owlery and wait for me there huh? No point you suffer the journey with me to the station." Hegwig hopped to the window sill, hooted in agreement and flew out towards the direction of Hogwarts. Harry hurriedly grabbed his trunk and the empty cage, what Uncle Vernon referred to as 'trash', and opened the door to the room. He glanced back into the room to make sure that he had everything that belonged to him before rushing downstairs to place his stuff by the front door and started cooking breakfast.
As they entered the room, they saw Dumbledore, Sirius and Remus, before the door of the room flew shut, with a wave of Dumbledore's hand. For fun, Harry waved his hand at the door, mentally saying 'alohomora', and the door flew open. Cheekily, Draco followed him by waving his hand and the door flew shut again. They turned back to the three adults currently standing in the room with grins on their faces.
"Harry, what fertilizer did you eat this summer? It's been only less than three months since I last saw you! Oh you got a tan! And muscles! And new glasses! And… And new clothes!" Hermione stared at the new Harry in front of her in wonder.
"The reason why the bond had taken so long to surface was probably due to the fact that you two started off on the wrong foot back when you were first years. You were always quarrelling. That kind of outbursts from the two of you must have been very passionate, seeing that you two are supposed to be soul mates. You two had been practically inseparable for the past three days, allowing the bond to strengthen a little bit. As time goes by, you will realize that some other powers might surface." Sirius explained.
Sirius stopped grinning and blinked at the two boys, stunned. "But… you guys had been together for…" He stopped, trying to mentally count the time the two boys were together.
"There is one thing we can do. Train ourselves up. In DADA, transfiguration and everything we can. We need to know as many hexes as possible. Learn to defend ourselves." Draco answered, turning his head to his left to look at Harry. Then he suddenly laughed, remembering something that Harry said a moment ago. Harry turned to face Draco, in confusion. "Voldie and the Death Eaters. Sounds like a band." Harry too joined in his laughter, still staring at Draco's face.
Harry ran out of the room, carrying Day, heading towards the infirmary, hoping that they were not too late to save Day. As the rest of the group left the room behind Harry, Draco looked around for clues as to who was involved in this attack. He saw something gleaming at the corner and walked over to the table there. Recognizing the bloody dagger that was left on the table, he remembered seeing it when Pansy had showed him back in her fifth year. Pansy had said that it was a family heirloom. His face hardened as he realized that the culprit for the disgusting deed was Pansy, and her two henchmen who never left her side were likely to be involved as well. He then turned to leave the room without touching the dagger. On his way out, he saw Day's broken wand on the floor. He picked it up and held it in his hand, directing his anger towards it. He could feel anger and worry from his mind link and the anger directed to the wand became a burst of magical energy. A bright light flashed in the room and the next moment when he looked at the wand, it was a wand that was no longer broken. His eyebrows shot up as he looked at the repaired wand in his hand, and then placed it in his pocket. Looking at the room he numbly wondered if Day was still alive, due to the sheer amount of blood on the floor of the room. Using his own wand he sealed the room against entry on the way out, reminding himself to tell Harry about the wand incident afterwards when things had settled down. As he walked slowly to the infirmary, his mind was filled with murderous tortures for the three disgusting culprits who dared to do this to Harry and his family. He would see to Day, before seeing to the tortures.
He looked to his right, at his colleague next to him, who was rigidly looking at the Slytherin House tables, especially the seventh-year students. Severus Snape was the house master of Slytherin house and Remus understood that after what happened during the summer, he was especially worried about how the graduating students will turn out as they are the next targets for Voldemort to recruit as his newest death eaters. Knowing what Professor Dumbledore, the Headmaster had planned for tonight meant that the dinner would be a longer affair than usual.
"Someone's leaking magic." Hermione said, noticing that Draco and Harry seemed to be trying to control their temper. Guessing that the ones who were leaking magic, she was afraid to approach them, as everyone around them became aware of the intensifying magic currents in the room. Ron's eyes went wide as he wanted to approach the two but was pulled back by Hermione.
When the door closed behind them, Ron collapsed into one of the chairs. "Does anyone feel like puking?" Ginny nodded to his question, leaning against Neville, who seemed to be quivering. Hermione moved behind Ron's chair and gently massaged the back of his neck.
Harry's eyes went wide as he realized the implications of what Draco just said. "Dray… I… It's going to hurt a bit…" Draco nodded and pulled Harry down to kiss him again, as his hands went to Harry's boxers to get rid of it. His hands then moved to clasp Harry's hard-on as Harry arched his neck, whimpering at his lover's caress. He quickly pulled Draco's hands away and Draco pouted up at him.
She stared at her own reflection in the mirror again. Seeing her short black hair, and her face, she knew from experience that she was not pretty among Chinese, and not many people go for her type. She never had a boyfriend, as she once heard boys commented that they prefer pretty girls who were not as smart as them. Somehow the fact that she seemed to ace all her classes scared guys away. Not that she really wanted guys who were so shallow, but it would be good for her morale if someone would just send a small card to her during Valentine's Day. She sighed again.
Harry deftly buttoned Draco's shirt till he looked decent, before answering, "But I don't want to be predictable." He then left the bed, hearing Draco chuckle.
"You two had really spent too much time together. You don't even need to talk. And I swear you know what each other are thinking all the time." Ron said softly, adjusting his position so that Hermione was more comfortable.
"Good afternoon. Had a good lunch? Draco, I heard that there was wagers on who was going to win the chess game tonight. I had my money on you and young Mr. Weasley." Professor Dumbledore's eyes twinkled as he got up from his seat. A wave of his wand and the chair went flying to the corner of the classroom, stacking nicely on other chairs.
Dumbledore smiled. "Miss Granger, calm yourself. It's not that hard to understand, given who they were. And all wizards can perform some wandless magic. It's not impossible."
Thirty minutes had passed. Ron looked rather calm to Harry. Draco just looked bored as he waited for his opponent Joseph to make his move. Harry then realized that the two of them were people who actually look forward to attention. Draco grew up thinking that he was superior and deserved attention from people. Ron grew up as the youngest son in a family with seven children and was determined to seek attention. Both of them were actually quite similar.
"Everything's happening so fast. We were enemies. We became friends. I… I think I like you." Harry blurted out.
"Up so early?" Draco asked casually, as he picked up his towel, walking towards one of the shower cubicles.
Draco finally realized that Harry was staring at him. He then stared back at Harry, returning his stare.
By lunchtime the next day, almost everyone had heard about the chess game that went on the previous night in the Gryffindor common room. Harry and Draco sat down to lunch with the rest after their free lesson. The two of them went up to their room to practice some spells from the library books they borrowed, but spent the last half an hour kissing each other senseless. Harry still looked a little flushed from the experience. Suddenly, two Ravenclaw sixth years appeared in front of them.
Harry liked the fact that someone seemed to think that he looked good, but as he was used to Seamus flirting with everyone, even Hermione, he didn't agree to anything, as he did happen to like that shirt. Something told him that if Seamus ever borrowed that shirt he would never get it back. He did grin down at Seamus who seemed to be stuck to his left arm, "Thanks Seam, but… then why is Malfoy still alive?"
Remus and Sirius looked at each other and sighed. They had been expecting this question. They knew that this question had been bothering Harry since a few years ago, but Dumbledore kept avoiding the issue. However, over the summer, he had finally given his consent to tell Harry why he was so important to the cause. They were just waiting for Harry to ask the question again.
Ron and Hermione were waiting at the door, with Hermione wearing an impatient look. She hurried the three boys towards the History of Magic classroom grumbling that they were going to be late. Draco commented that he didn't understand why anyone would worry about being late for the lesson in which everyone would take a nap in. Ron then commented that Hermione actually took notes in that class for the past six years. All Draco gave as a reply was an astonished look and Hermione responded by glaring at her boyfriend.
Draco, who was always so cool and calm with everything that happened, seemed to be about to hyperventilate.
"And seeing that you two were seekers on your teams, the past years had trained you with good reflexes. The wall was constructed without muttering the spell mentally but by imagining. Maybe the next session will be on which spells you can do just by imagining it." Dumbledore smiled. "Now, show our dear Professor Lupin what you two have accomplished in your Advanced Transfiguration lessons. Sirius, did you tell Remus their forms?" Sirius shook his head, shooting a grin in the directions of the two black panthers in front of them, while staring at Remus' astonished face.
"Wake up, Boy, and cook breakfast for us! Dudley is hungry! Bring your TRASH down so that we can get rid of you sooner!" Harry Potter was awakened by his uncle's shouting and banging on his door and Dudley's heavy footsteps down to the kitchen. He hurriedly got up from his bed, tidied it up real quick (he knew he would have to rush in the morning and ended up packing all his things last night and sleeping on top of his covers to prevent messing up the bed) and unlatched Hegwig's cage. Hegwig hopped out of her cage and lifted one of her talons, looking at Harry, questioning.
Draco never knew that Day Lee was so smart. After all, she was two years below his that he didn't even pay much attention to her. And she just 'adopted' him? "You Gryffindors really trust a person very easily huh?"
"Wow, Draco! This is like outside, if you bring a lover to make love in this bed, it would look like you are making love outdoors! Can I borrow your bed some time?" Seamus then sat down at the end of the bed, looking up at the canopy. "By the way, I'm thinking of starting a fling. Who should I target this time? Which house? The only good looking one left in Slytherin is Zabini, seeing that Draco is here. Hmm…"
Draco nearly couldn't stop himself from crashing into Day when she started towards him. Day caught hold of both his hands and pulled him into the Great Hall. She could see Harry frowning.
"It depends. Day always have the ability to see beyond a person's mask. When she said that she was 'keeping' me two years ago, all I thought was that by being near her, I was endangering her. So I pulled away. I shut her out for a week, avoided her and just plain ignored her when I saw her. Then after that week, in the common room, she came up to me and gave me a tight slap across the face. She wanted me to stop doing whatever I was doing. Her exact words were that 'she just wanted someone to listen to her ramble'. I caved in. And subconsciously she became something like a little sister to me." Harry said, getting up from his seat upon noticing that all of them had finished their breakfast. They then made their way to the dungeons for the dreaded Potions lessons.
The whole group made their way out, all of them stopping to run their thumbs on the movement chart. The panel then closed behind them, with the movement chart showing 'breakfast and class' under everyone's columns.
As the students all settled down, the door opened again, with Deputy Headmistress Professor Minerva McGonagall leading the first year students into the Great Hall. The whole group of eleven-year-olds all looked around the place in wonder as they followed her into this enchanting hall. They were followed by Hagrid, who being a half giant, seemed so tall that quite a few of the first years barely came up to his knees. Harry wondered if he was ever that short. Thinking back to when he was eleven and first saw Hagrid, he must have been that short as well. He exchanged a smile with Hagrid as he passed Harry's table. When Hagrid seated at the teacher's table, Professor McGonagall brought out the sorting hat and it started reciting a poem about the founders of the school and the different houses.
Harry and Pansy have a discussion about sexuality and homophobia in the pureblooded wizard community in this chapter just so you know :)
“Ooh, dad! Open yours from me!” Moony reached into his pile until he found one that had his name penned in Draco’s handwriting. It was a thick blanket with a sea of stitched stars and moons on the side. The moment Draco saw it, he knew that his father would love it. He always said that he and Sirius were the stars to his moon.
“Alright, bye Draco, DON’T SCARE US LIKE THAT AGAIN!”  With that final sentiment, the paper exploded in a small
“But Harry isn’t finished!” protested Sirius, gesturing towards the boy, who was now sitting, cross-legged in front of the stone, and seemed to be talking to it.
Draco sneered and continued to walk away but Harry pursued him, and now Draco could feel someone watching them. “Moody.” he sighed and turned to find the Professor behind a nearby tree. “Is there a reason you’ve been watching me?” Draco called out to him.
“Ron, do you by any chance happen to have the Dumbledore Chocolate Frog card on you?” Draco has always had a flair for the dramatics.
“Oh, you’re right!” While Ron was mouthing the word ‘harm-on-ee-car’, trying to figure it out, Draco started playing a calming melody, the one that he always used in the middle of the night, when the moon was too bright and he needed a lullaby. Soon enough, the scrambles of a dog awoken were replaced by it’s snores and the four crept into the room as Draco continued the tune. He was beginning to run out of breath and released for a moment to inhale again, but this pause caused Fluffy to stir in his sleep and move his paw directly onto the trapdoor.
“Are you going into first year like me?” Harry scratched the back of his neck and he was glowing crimson at being addressed by Draco. Sirius smirked at him and winked. Clearly his son had the Black family genes that made them irresistible.
I've just finished the Philosopher's Stone and I've started on the Chamber of Secrets! BIG HUGS ♡ I'm very excited about all of this!!
“Let’s take you to the hospital wing, Potter.” said Flint, who hoisted him up with the help of Oliver Wood. It was quite nice, Harry thought through the haze of knowing that your arm could be eaten with a spoon, that the two teams had put aside their differences in favour of a joint hatred for Professor Lockhart. The bumbling man had fled the scene, for which Harry was grateful. He didn’t think that there were many people he disliked more than Gilderoy Lockhart.
“Yes, you’re right, Harry. I do like Chocolate Frogs better.” He and Hermione shared a small inside laugh before venturing off to the peppermint toads. It made Harry vaguely frustrated to know that Draco had ‘inside laughs’ with anyone but him.
“Harry!” A familiar voice pushed through the crowd and knelt at his side. “Harry! Are you okay? Are you hurt?” Draco gasped, noticing his bleeding arm.
“Kingsley has just informed me that he is coming, they were just giving you two time to get information out of him, he reckoned Peter would be more likely to answer to you.” She clasped her hands together in front of her and ran the tip of her index fingers along her cuticles, a nervous gesture she picked up around the time when You-Know-Who originally rose to power. “What has he told you?”
“What do you need, Dumby?” Dumbledore took a deep breath before he was interrupted by Minerva, clearly irritated at her colleague’s lack of tact.
“And now, by the tutelage of Dumbledore, the power of Merlin, magic, and love beyond comprehension, I now pronounce you husband and husband. You may now kiss one another.”
So the dark-haired boy resigned himself to waiting for his bones to regrow, which turned out to be just as painful as it sounded, if not more so. Draco was infuriated. Any fancy that he once had for Lockhart had disapparated, and all his attention was focused on Harry. He spent every possible moment he could at the boy’s bedside, doing his best to make the pain go away. But he couldn’t. That had been a problem for him as long as he could remember. He vaguely remembered the face of his mother, but it was always distressed and upset and all he wanted to do was wipe her frown away, but couldn’t. Or whenever Moony came back from what he now knew was a transformation, and no amount of hugs could make him look less tired or get the sad glint out of his eyes.
"My bed today huh?" Harry asked, amused as he also sat down on his bed. The next moment, Draco pushed him down onto his back, rearranging him and then placed the book on Harry's chest and balanced himself on his elbows beside him. He then flipped the book open and started reading, ignoring the astonished look that Harry had on his face with the prospect of finding himself being the table. Harry sighed and settled down, letting Draco read on him, while he enjoyed the view of staring at Draco's face.
"Okay Ron, I don't care about the wagers or anything. Main thing is to try to keep calm and treat it like normal common room chess game. I played you last night and you are really good. Okay?" Draco said softly, as they made their way to the chess set. Ron grinned and nodded at him. Draco got a wave of love from Harry through the mind link and sent happiness back to Harry. He looked up just in time to catch Harry smiling at him.
"Of course. Who else will argue against you? Harry, potatoes." Draco said, handing Harry his spoon. Harry took the potatoes for him and went on eating. Just then a black furry head pushed itself in between of Harry's and Draco's bodies. "Snuffles, didn't anyone feed you? You are so rude." Draco mock scolded Sirius whose eyes were eyeing the chicken wings on the table. Harry stretched out his hand, grabbed a chicken wing and extended it to Sirius who immediately bit into the chicken wing and sat down between the two chairs eating it. Draco just shook his head and frowned up to the teachers' table where Professor Lupin was seated eating his dinner. "The way this mongrel is eating, you would think that Lupin is starving him. He won't do that, will he?" He glared back at Sirius who had finished the chicken wing and was panting hopefully up to him. Draco took two chicken wings and threw it onto the floor again, before going back to his dinner.
Their animagus transformation lessons were very painful. They had to first train themselves to clear their minds to learn to concentrate. Then they attempted to change their limbs into paws. The shifting of the bones within their body during the change was really painful, but as they practiced, they got used to the pain. The trick was to expect the pain. Then when the whole process was practiced to shorten the time needed and lessened the pain, Sirius had them attempt to transform their body as well, into forming the panther's body, and tail. The final change incorporated was their head, which was even more painful then before, because every single bone in the head had to move, and even their teeth had to be changed. Within the last two months, they had only been able to change into the full panther twice, and that was during the previous week's lessons. Both Sirius and Professor Dumbledore were impressed by the speed in which they had used to learn the skill, and all they had to do was to perfect the skill such that it was as natural as what Sirius could do.
"Sorry Dean, you look so cute just now. Well take it slowly then. You don't have to tell him now. Just wait a while. You know what Seamus is like. Ask yourself if you can actually accept all his good points as well as all his flaws. If you can accept him as he is, and that he does like you, then… I don't see how come this is not going to work. It is just the next step after so many years of you guys being such good friends. Everyone, even Seamus and I know that we don't belong together. That's why he feel safe being near me as both of us won't mistake him as interested in me or vice versa. Look at Ron and Herm. They look stable. If any wagers are placed on which couple are the likeliest to settle down I would bet on them. And Ron liked Herm after at least three years of knowing her so well. And I think that Seam is interested in you, just that you always seem to promote yourself as a straight guy so he didn't try anything. I did see him check you out before." Harry grinned to put his friend's mind at ease.
As the time neared for the team to go down to the pitch to assemble, the Quidditch players got up from their seat at the house table. Harry had purposely brought two of his Gryffindor scarves, his daily and Quidditch scarves. He stood up and in full view of everyone in the hall, took his daily scarf and placed it around Draco's neck, publicly announcing his claim on the blond. Draco gave him a grin and pulled him down for a fast peck on his lips and a whispered 'good luck, although you don't need it' into his ear.
Suddenly the bubble disappeared and Draco's voice floated up to her. "All it meant was that we are likely to be good Aurors that's all. Sorry we almost lost control." Harry stood up and pulled Draco up. Both of them looked like they were back to normal.
Halfway through the dinner, Professor Dumbledore stood up to make an announcement. "As you have noticed, we have yet to announce the identity of the Head Girl and Head Boy. I'm pleased to announce that Mr Terry Boot from Ravenclaw and Miss Hermione Granger from Gryffindor are the Head Boy and Girl respectively. Please give the two of them all the cooperation you can in this year." Both Terry Boot and Hermione stood up and bowed to the school. When she sat down, Ron gave Hermione a big hug.
All the seventh years of each house sat all the way at the end of the hall, thus Malfoy would have to walk almost the whole stretch of the long table to get to where Harry was standing, waiting. As Malfoy was walking towards him, Harry took the chance to take a really good look at him. Malfoy's hands were both in the side pockets of his school robe, as he arrogantly strolled towards Harry. Even after what happened, he did not cower under the stare of everyone and walked as if he owned the world and it was his right to make Harry wait for him to reach there. His face was devoid of any expression but his grey eyes burned defiantly as he neared Harry, staring straight at Harry's emerald orbs. It was at that sudden moment that Harry realized that Draco Malfoy was really stunning in the looks compartment. Being the Slytherin seeker made him fit like an athlete and his silvery blond hair is so neat that Harry was tempted to run his fingers through the silky strands just to mess them up. His features were such that it was obvious he had aristocratic blood and all his beautiful features along with that body were enough to drive anyone crazy. However, what made Harry suck in a quick breath were Malfoy's eyes. That defiant look was making his blood flow faster and it was obvious that Malfoy himself knew how good he looked.
At that particular moment, Pansy strolled into the Great Hall with Crabbe and Goyle. She purposely chose to walk past the Gryffindor group.
"I can look after it for you. I'll be sitting in the stands. Just leave it there and I'll guard it." Sirius said before changing back to the black dog.
Draco looked at Ron, who was still frowning at the chess board. His chess pieces shrank back from him. "Hey Ron, it really was a good game. I wasn't kidding."
"Gin, you mustn't tease Harry this way, just because you have a boyfriend doesn't mean that Harry should have one. You should be on the lookout for a nice boy for Harry, not say this kind of words. Hi there, Harry! Sorry about what Gin said. Ron, I'm bringing her to another compartment to scold her. Come on Ginny." Ginny obediently followed Neville out of the compartment, after giving Harry a small wink and blushing. It seemed to Harry that Neville can't wait to say hi to Ginny either.
When Draco finally came back to himself, he looked down at Harry who was laying his head on Draco's stomach waiting for him to recover from his pleasure. Harry smiled and leant up to give Draco a deep kiss. Draco could feel a faint taste of himself in Harry's mouth, as he felt himself stirring again. They broke the kiss and Draco looked up at Harry.
“Severus, I am sure that they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.” said Dumbledore, as he gave Snape a pointed look. The other wizard entertained it for a few moments before turning to Harry and Draco.
’”Again, the page only showed warming charms. They tried countless combinations, all to no avail. “Maybe I should write to my dads?”
Draco scampered up to it and slammed on the knocker. Within seconds, the welcoming faces of his dad’s were smiling down at them, welcoming the pair in.
Thank you for all the love! I'm actually really overwhelmed, this is my first longer fic and my first Drarry so I'm really happy that everyone is liking it 💖
Sirius looked at Remus with such unwavering devotion that it made Minerva feel like crying like some childish schoolgirl. She really hoped the oncoming storm wouldn’t tear them apart.
“It’s just… he looked so scrawny…” His sentences were thick with emotion and Remus could see how hard he was trying not to cry. “I thought that Dumbledore would have sent him to live with some family member we didn’t know about! And I thought that family wouldn’t be Petunia fucking Dursley!”
Thankfully, he didn’t have to, as James began with a confident voice. “Ladies and gentlemen. We are gathered here today, under the sight of Merlin himself-” There came a low chuckle from the crowd. “-to unite these two persons in matrimony. Unfortunately, due to marriage laws in the muggle world, this ceremony could now be muggle, like the grooms wanted. However, my creativity and wit has devised a speech which similarly resembles that one, but has made a few important changes. But first, I would like to say a few words about my two best friends.” He cleared his throat for dramatic effect. “Remus John Lupin and Sirius Orion Black, are the two of the kindest, bravest, and most wonderful men I know, and I take it as the greatest honour that they chose me to officiate this ceremony. Now more than ever, we must take joy where we can find it. In the arms of our loved ones, in the comfort of our hopes and dreams, and in the happiness of others. Which is why this union is a most special one. Not only are Remus and Sirius made for each other, they are symbols of hope for all of us. There is a light at the end of this long tunnel, and we will get there if we keep holding on to each other.”
on SIrius’s wand, that he did not cast the spell… I am ashamed to say that, even as his husband, I had my doubts on the subject.”
WARNING! Slight discussion of something that could perhaps be an eating disorder so please avoid if you feel like you could be triggered by that! This is something that I will probably discuss more of later, maybe not in this specific work, but I'm only mentioning it a little in this one.
“No, not really. We probably would have known it was a snake without this sheet of paper, but this gives us a heads up.”
Draco rushed over and tugged him away from the dying snake until they both collapsed onto the stony, cold floor of the Chamber. While the sword was still in the Basilisk, the bow and it’s arrows lay forgotten a few metres away from them.
Harry grasped his shoulder momentarily and they surged forward, trying not to think about whatever the hell they were walking into.
The plan took place during Transfiguration, when one of the dwarves entered the classroom and cleared his throat.
Draco finished his chocolate and tried to get back to sleep, but it would not come, so they stayed up until the morning, drinking hot chocolate, and playing Exploding Snap and Wizard’s Chess. Everything seemed far behind them until the Daily Prophet was chucked through their window by Perseus, along with an urgent letter.
Just wanted to say, the next two chapters (after this one) are going to be over the Christmas holidays, I wanted to spend some time developing the relationships between Sirius, Remus, Harry and Draco.
“No. Stay. You’re warm.” Harry blushed and nodded, maneuvering their bodies until they were both horizontal and under the covers. They weren’t pressed up as close as they were before, but Harry could still feel the heat of Draco’s body. And it helped that their fingers were still lightly tangled. As sleep drowned them, Harry heard Draco mumble a ‘Goodnight, Harry’. To which he replied,
Draco slammed his fist against the barrier, causing a shock wave to ripple through it. He retracted his arm and stared in horror at what he had done. Lucius Malfoy had a genuine smile on his face, although it was tainted by the manic gleam in his eyes.
He gave Harry a light elbow under the table. The Slytherins had never been too fond of Harry and Draco’s relationship before, and they hadn’t exactly been subtle in the way they had shown their affection, but now they were officially,
Dumbledore paused and sat down on their sofa, gesturing for the two men to do the same. They did, more out of habit of doing what their headmaster said than anything else. But, eventually, the wrinkled man spoke in a hushed, calm voice.
“Draco, you said earlier that Gryffindor is the house of the good guys. I want to be a good guy! What if… I don’t know. What if I’m not a good guy?” Draco paused and tried to think of an answer. The Boy Who Lived wanting to be a good guy was, at the very least, comforting.
“How did you die?” It didn’t sound as abrupt as it could have. Draco had an incredible ability to persuade people to do what he wanted them to do, without seeming to try at all. But it seemed to work, as Myrtle’s interest seemed to suddenly pique. She let out a piercing wail and sailed down to meet them.
? Is this why people were afraid of him? And why were people calling Moony a werewolf?  He vaguely felt Harry’s hand on his shoulder, and his voice soothing in his ear, before Snape’s firm grip hoisted him up from his seat and forced him out of the room.
Remus and Sirius soon made their way into the room and asked Harry what they talked about. He relayed the entire conversation and gauged their reactions which varied from thunderous to terrified. Probably of Dumbledore’s lack of security in this school. The Lupin-Blacks reassured him that he would be spending the last three weeks of the Summer holiday with them as they still needed to work out the legalities, which Harry didn’t understand, and they left him to drift back to sleep.
This tree was one of the things he was going to miss when he went back to school, although he was endlessly pleased that his father wasn’t going to be one of them this year.
“Thank you.” he choked out in between sobs. That statement didn’t quite cover it. Nothing could ever cover the intense amount of genuine emotion he was feeling.
“OH, CLEARLY!” Both of their throats were getting sore, but Draco continued, fuelled only by rage. “LET’S REVIEW: YOU PICKED UP A RANDOM BOOK OFF OF THE FLOOR OF THE GIRLS TOILETS AND NOW YOU TRUST IT’S OPINION?”
Short one today, sorry! (Also I feel like Draco is super perceptive, especially in comparison to Harry Oblivious Potter haha)
“Oh my goodness, no. Stop! You are so annoying! I get it, you have a hero complex, I remember, but you also promised me that you would be safe! Fighting a monster is not safe, Harry!” His voice was rising to inappropriate levels.
While the entire population of Hogwarts, at least the population that hadn’t been living under a rock, was aware of their Professor’s furry little problem, it didn’t usually cause much trouble. Which was surprising, all things considered. But he had successfully raised a child, so that was something. The only people who had a problem with it were a few pureblood families, but they couldn’t do much except refuse to allow their child to attend the class. So Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy and Blaise weren’t present for the incident.
I may have to take a little while off because I have mocks next week but I'll be back... oh boy will I be back. I have big plans for this thing.
At the Welcome Feast, Dumbledore announced the Triwizard Tournament and Harry and Draco pretended to be surprised.
Remus stepped forward. “Boys, you should have waited for us, we could have apparated you there or taken you on the bike, you were both very silly and you could have gotten yourselves killed.” He was speaking in a calm voice, most likely for Harry’s benefit, but was trembling slightly with irritation. “I don’t know quite how to express this to you two, but you seem to have the survival instincts of a suicidal chipmunk. And that isn’t good at all, considering only last year Harry had to take on a fully grown Defense teacher with a homicidal maniac acting as a succubus on the back of his head with no supervision or help from ANY teachers. Please, I am begging you, try to stay safe this year. Don’t do dumb things, don’t go looking for trouble, and don’t try to save the school again. The future is unclear, especially for you two, and I don’t want anything happening to you. Have I made myself clear?”
“If Mr Malfoy Jr. is to attend school at Hogwarts this year, there must be some changes regarding security.” he cleared his throat and started unpacking his briefcase, which seemed to be filled with loose papers and legal documents. “We could have Aurors here at all times, but they are extremely valuable to us, you must understand, and I think Hogwarts would need an army.”
Harry breathed. He always felt just a little bit calmer whenever Draco was near him. “Yeah, I’m fine. I was just looking at your pictures.” All of a sudden, Harry knew what he was getting Draco for Christmas.
As the words Draco spoke manipulating the air around him in soft, lilting tones, Harry allowed the story to encompass his thoughts and take him on a journey.
, he’s an Auror! And a Professor! He should have known he’d be teaching Harry Potter, and he shouldn’t be getting starstruck.”
Draco allowed his eyes to adjust before squinting at the tiny letters. “Huh.” he murmured. “That’s weird. Do you think the map’s made a mistake?”
Pads and Moony just held them tighter, whispering words of comfort when necessary, but mostly just revelling in the feeling of having their boys back in their arms.
James sighed and moved to stand near Sirius, still keeping the cloak hanging loosely around his waist for a quick getaway if they needed it. “Well…” he stammered, looking guilty. “We were really worried about you. You disappear once a month and when you come back you seem really tired and sometimes you seem hurt so we did some investigating.” Remus was tense.
Harry came into consciousness in the Hospital Wing, feeling as though his mouth were filled with cotton. Slowly, memories began to resurface, the Mirror, the man under the turban, the searing pain of his scar, the crumbling man under his fingertips, the hot flush he had experienced just as he was saying goodbye to Draco. It all felt like a long, but detailed, fever dream.
“I can only imagine what you go through every month, Moony.” Sirius kept his voice hushed and soothing. “But you’re strong. And so is our son.”
As per his regular tradition, Draco woke up his dads by leaping on their bed and screaming in their ears before scampering off with Harry to retrieve the stockings. They sat around the fireplace, which was burning hot on the embers all day long, and danced to Muggle Christmas songs that Harry introduced them to, and that Sirius was deeply enjoying.
They screamed. Draco accelerated with all of his might and managed to raise the bike high enough to escape the train.
It wasn’t that he was nervous to marry Moony - he wasn’t. He loved him with all his heart and it had taken YEARS of convincing to get the werewolf to finally realise that was true and that he wanted to marry him.
However, he has one particular memory - the one he uses for his Patronus, actually - of his face on their wedding day. It was stoic and calm to anyone who didn’t know where to look, but his lower lip trembled slightly and his cheeks were a painted with a faint blush, a butterfly blush, Sirius called it. But his eyes. They were wet and shiny with tears of utter joy and love and the colour was indescribable. It was as though whatever God was out there, every magical and non-magical creature, all of the characters from the stories he had read, all came together, put aside their differences, and infused this wonderful man’s eyes with the nectar of the Earth. It sounded dramatic, but there it was.
He’d always preferred the Hogs Head to the Three Broomsticks. Something about the personality of it made him feel warm, like he was a part of another imperfectly perfect family. At this rate, he would have more families than most, which was something he graciously welcomed.
, he thought. He didn’t know quite how to convey to Sirius that it wasn’t the case, and he didn’t have to, James came to his rescue.
Now, Draco was sprawled, face first on the covers of his Slytherin bed, listening to Harry get ready for bed. He probably should too, but he was too knackered. The room was empty apart from himself, Harry, and a boy by the name of Blaise Zabini who was passed out in the bed farthest from them. Harry had chosen the bed nearest the wall and Draco had chosen the one right next to him, desperate for any resemblance of a friend he could get. Harry had been good to him so far. He wasn’t big headed or arrogant, just shy. He seemed to be just as desperate for a friend as Draco was, which helped. Especially seeing as he was certain that he would lose Harry as a friend earlier that day in the Entrance Hall.
“So what house do you want to be in?”  The boy asked -  ‘Draco’. Harry recalled his name being strange.
You guys!! We're nearing the end, I have so many ideas for PoA! When that comes out, I might start doing uploads every other day, idk we'll see!
“Okay.” Remus counted down, the way he used to do when he was getting Draco to eat his vegetables as a baby. On one, they barrelled into the wall, laughing when they made it to the other side. Remus could never forget how magnificent the Hogwarts Express was, and felt, for some reason, hopeful, knowing that it was always here and the start and end of every term, waiting to take children back and forth from the greatest place on Earth. Harry seemed overtaken with a similar emotion as he traced the glossy contours of the train. “It’s amazing isn’t it?”
Draco hadn’t been too bothered though, honestly. As a matter of fact, he admired the dramatic flair of it all and probably would have done the same thing. He also knew vaguely what he was to expect from this new professor, courtesy of his dads warning him of Moody’s strange temper.
“I can.” Sirius was gritting his teeth and Moony was rubbing his shoulder in calming motions. “It’s like he’s asking you two to go out and get into trouble.” Harry looked suddenly guilty. “Oh no, it’s okay Harry, your father and I used to use that cape all the time at Hogwarts, just make sure you don’t go too far. Dumbledore can’t keep an eye on you if he can’t see you.”
Minerva could see the glistening of tears in his eyes as she nodded slightly. “I think we would be naive to think otherwise.”
“But you like Chocolate Frogs better, don’t you, Draco?” Harry butted in after a small flare of jealousy growled like a beast in his stomach.
He quickly darted down the hall, running away from the pack of Aurors, all firing stunning charms at him and missing. It would have been comical if it weren’t for the circumstances.
The man sneered. “Damn pickpocket.” He snatched it away and tossed it to Dobby. “Check that he hasn’t stolen anything, elf.”
“I’m fine it’s just… I’m going to feel jealous with a bunch of people getting them when I’m not.” He chuckled drily and turned his attention back to Lockhart. However, Harry was busy formulating a plan.
Harry’s first year at Hogwarts was as eventful as they come, but he didn’t know half of what was in store for him.
He continued the journey to McGonagall’s office and rummaged in his bag for the diary, which was now suspiciously gone. His brow furrowed in concentration and did one final sweep of his beg before deciding that it was a lost cause, there wasn’t much he could do anyway.
One day, while eating dinner in the Hospital Wing, Harry told Draco about his second visit from the strange house elf, Dobby (who was apparently the one who charmed the bludger for some stupidly heroic reason. Draco inwardly groaned when Harry told him this, he would never be able to get used to the universe being against his Harry.)
At his command, the gates opened with an ominous creek. Guards lined the walls, still and unmoving, like corpses. The pair forced their feet onwards, following their assigned Auror, to the cell of Lucius Malfoy.
Through the door, was a troll. A dead on this time, Thank Merlin. So they crossed over to the opposite door. Through this one was a small room with a Potions table in the centre. But, as soon as they passed over the threshold, a purple fire appeared in the doorway, blocking their exit. On the table, were a series of potions in different shapes and sizes of bottle, and a piece of paper, written on with long, languid script. Draco skimmed over it.
he was sure of, but he wasn’t going to ask Remus and Sirius. They had avoided the question the last time he had tried, and he honestly didn’t care about the facts. He could deal with it on his own. So he did.
Every morning of the rest of the holidays began with Harry, Remus, Draco and Sirius sifting through a flurry of newspapers, each continuing to report on the Quidditch match. They couldn’t leave the house without disillusionment charms or Harry and Draco huddling under the invisibility cloak for fear that they would be bombarded by reporters.
“Legal things, it’s complicated.” Draco could tell that they were lying, but he felt that he would prefer that explanation than the one that they were hiding. ‘Legal things’ was good enough for him.
Snape was taken aback for a moment before scowling. “Ten points from Slytherin.” he said. “For impertinence.”
They shared a grin and continued laughing silently. James and Lily may have been gone from their lives, but the memories would live on. It wasn’t enough, but it would get them through.
Still, it wasn’t nice to know that your father was ever anything less than a kind person, but it wasn’t like his father was an ex-Death Eater who escaped from Azkaban. He turned to Draco at this thought, who was entranced in the heavens.
“No way are you going anywhere near that death trap.” Remus felt a warm glow spreading from his chest to every area of his body, what a wonderful family he had. If seven years ago, you would have told him that he would someday be reunited with his husband, with a beautiful child about to go to Hogwarts, he would have checked them for a
That night, they huddled up by the fire and talked about their day. Their feelings, their plans. Life was changing for everyone in the family, and they needed to combat that as best as they could. So Sirius suggested that they all move to Hogsmeade.
He looked directly at Harry, who seemed to be a little emotional, so he took the lead himself. “I am confused about a lot of things.” he said, in a quiet voice. “I’m assuming it was Dumbledore who sent the hat and the Phoenix, but why were we able to pull weapons out of it? I pulled out a bow and some arrows, and Harry pulled out a sword.”
Harry didn’t fear Voldemort so much as he feared dementors. Although the memory itself was fuzzy, it had a certain aura to it that made his stomach feel like lead, he didn’t feel that way when he remembered the battle in the Chamber, or the fight with Quirrel. This one felt darker, more sinister somehow. Somewhere, he remembered hearing a woman’s scream, and a familiar voice whispering a dreaded incantation. Visually, there was nothing but black, though. Black rot and decay. It felt empty and hollow and like the light of Draco’s eyes would never shine bright again, or the pleasant feeling of laughter whenever Padfoot jumped into him would never be felt once more.
“Thank you, Mr Lupin. I am afraid I am here to ask a favour.” The two young men shared a look. It was very much like Dumbledore to randomly ask you to do something ridiculous, and from the looks of the boy sleeping contentedly in Remus’s arms, this favour wasn’t going to be as trivial as marking some Hogwarts exam papers.
“Sorry! It’s just that the slippery bastard keeps running away!” Sirius groaned, running his hand through his thick hair.
By the next week, Ron, Harry, Draco and Hermione were all friends. Of course, Harry and Draco still kept themselves to themselves more than anything, and made sure that their group of Slytherin lackeys was still as loyal as ever, but Hermione and Ron proved to themselves to be very good study partners, and Ron was glad to help Harry figure out what was underneath the trapdoor when Draco couldn’t really care less. However, on Halloween, Ron showed up to dinner alone, so Harry sent one of their gang, Millicent Bulstrode, to find out what had happened. After about ten minutes, she returned with the news that Ron and Hermione had had an argument and that Hermione was crying in one of the girls toilets. Pansy Parkinson cackled at that.
The rest of the day held nothing special, but Draco mentioned at one point that Valentine's Day was coming up.
The only notable things to really happen in the weeks following Christmas were the extra defensive classes Harry and Draco were taking with Remus and the unfortunate death of Ron’s rat, which Ron himself blamed solely on Hermione and her ugly cat.
So, on his birthday, Harry awoke to Remus, Sirius and Draco waking him up by singing ‘Happy Birthday’ at the top of their lungs, as poorly as they could. Sirius even got these magical party poppers that made mini fireworks when activated, most likely from Zonko’s. It was amazing. He had spent his birthday at their house before, but they hadn’t made quite so much of a spectacle. It was almost like he had been initiated into the family. Or maybe it was more guilt that they let him stay in such a horrible place for eleven years and three weeks.
Sirius sighed and tilted his back to look at the trees. Draco copied his action. “I just want you to protect your heart.”
“Woah.” he murmured softly as he traced his hand over the glowing dots, blocking their light momentarily and revealing it again by removing his fingers. “It’s beautiful. Thank you.”
“Firs’ years, firs’ years! Over ‘ere!” Harry spotted a large, familiar face looming above the children and ran to it, pulling Draco along.
, I thought we could trust Peter... “ He trailed off for a moment before returning with renewed vigour. “When we found out about James and Lily, we rushed straight to Godric’s Hollow and… I was so angry, I didn’t even listen to Rem when he told me to stop, I just apparated to Peter and… I reckon I would’ve killed him. But I heard Moony in my head, and I thought about you, Harry, and I just couldn’t leave you two like that, so I stopped but… Pete didn’t.”
“Pads, move out the way.” came Remus’s calming tones. Oddly enough, Harry could just about see his Professor’s face lurking in the flames of the fire. “What can I do for you, Severus?” he asked, wearily.
“Yes?” The boy turned around and eyed the trio warily, stilling slightly on Draco and blushing. “Who are you?”
Draco didn’t remember his father, only his mother, and even then it was only snippets. But he owned a silver rattle that he kept in his bedside drawer, with the Malfoy crest emblazoned on it’s side, a gift from him, the only thing he still had. But no amount of heirlooms could have prepared him for the sight of what looked like an older version of himself, wasting away like a hollow shell, slumped in the corner of a dark, damp prison cell. His eyes prickled with tears but he held them back, this was something that he needed to do.
The Professor came in and surveyed the scene before her. The still alive body of her ex-student, bound and gagged in the corner, and his old best friends glaring daggers down at him. It made her sad, even more so than she had been after the whole affair. She could barely see the cocky children she had watched growing up anymore. She felt old.
He sighed and plopped his head back on the pillow, racking his brain for another question. But, before he could think of one, the old man
The corners of Lucius’s mouth curled not quite upwards to create a grimace that displayed his yellow teeth. “What are you doing here, boy?”
“Draco, we don’t know how he got out, but you didn’t have anything to do with it. This was all just some big coincidence, all you need to be worried about now is keeping yourself safe.” His voice was like hot chocolate on a cold day. It warmed Draco up on the inside so much that he needed to get closer. He leaned forward and connected their lips in a sweet, unhurried kiss. It wasn’t like the last one they shared, hurried and messy and full of adrenaline, but it wasn’t any less passionate. He reached his hand up and tangled it in Harry’s messy hair, tugging him even closer. The boy obliged and responded by cupping Draco’s face with a warm hand. It only lasted about twenty seconds, and Draco wished it could have gone on for longer, but the presence of his dad put an end to it.
When the blonde finished reading, he placed a bookmark between the pages with care and tucked it into his bedside drawer. Then, he cuddled down under the sheets, tugging Harry close and kissing his forehead.
“Does that mean that there are people down there seeing two twelve-year-olds on a flying motorcycle?”
“I think it's wonderful, Draco.” Ron’s eyes darted between the two other boys with scrutiny before clearing his throat and standing up.
Draco surged forward for a hug, catching the grown man mid-sentence. Remus hugged back with ferocity. Over Remus' shoulder, Draco could see the terrified glances of his fellow students and the words of disdain and fear forming on their lips as their turned to their friends and gestured to him. It was as though he was an exhibit in a museum, they didn't even care if he saw.
Said meeting went on for a while. It was mostly filled with arguing, a chair or two was broken, but there came a dip in the conversation when they started talking about what exactly happened.
It all started when Snape woke up in the morning and decided that he could stir the cauldron a little and jump ahead on the syllabus to werewolves. Most students could only guess what his intention was: to make them scared enough of Professor Lupin-Black to get him fired so that Snape could fill in. But they weren’t that stupid. To start with, nobody liked Snape, but also, Lupin-Black was the most competent teacher they had ever had for defense, and not even changing into a hideous and potentially dangerous beast once a month would take away from that. Every girl in the school did that, and nobody stayed away from them.
Cedric barely missed a crash and was thrown off completely, missing when Harry really saw the Snitch, which was hovering by the tallest goalpost. He set off for it and captured it with ease as the whole of Slytherin screamed in celebration.
Once Harry had arrived and was set up on a spare mattress in Draco’s room, which Remus knew would probably be little used, the little boy avoided the snow like the plague. It had fallen quite a bit this year, to Draco extreme delight, he loved the snow, so did Sirius, who had a childlike glee for the stuff. They were playing in the garden for what seemed like hours before Sirius thundered in, eyes gaunt and stormy.
“No matter how much we want you to.” His voice was low and dangerous, it was clear that he wasn’t okay with Harry being out of his sight.
“Okay, so are you guys going to spend hours in the library now? Looking for information on this man?” Harry gave Draco a pleading look.
"Alright, are you sure you have everything?" Remus asked, ever the mother hen. "If you've forgotten something, just owl and I'll drop it up to the school."
“Well, I suppose I wanted to thank you for the articles you’ve been writing about me in your magazine.”
They had it all planned out, they would wait until after dinner on Thursday and would sneak off to the bathroom, where they could interrogate the girl, but it was all interrupted when the magically magnified voice of Minerva McGonagall stopped them in the corridors on the charms.
He sat silently beside his friend’s hospital bed, with Hermione, Ron, and the entire Slytherin team. It was quite unifying, actually, and not even that awkward. Sure, they had lost the match to Ravenclaw, but Draco had gotten enough points through scoring that it wasn’t that big of a loss. They would pull through. And there was talk of a rematch because of the clear foul the dementors had played.
No. Draco thought the thing was adorable and fluffy. It was ridiculous. It looked like it had taken a wrong turn and walked into a wall, not ‘adorable and fluffy’ at all.
Remus, Sirius and Draco were all in the stands, watching intently as Harry soared high in the sky, emerald eyes darting this way and that, desperately seeking some glint of gold. The boy had tension between his eyebrows, more concentrated than Draco had ever seen him.
Sirius and Draco went for a midday walk before all the singing shenanigans began through Hogsmeade town and then venturing into the outskirts of the forest.
“I’m sorry for asking, it’s just that, Sirius over there, he’s your godfather, and we haven’t heard anything about you in years. Only that you were alive.”
I think to me it would smell like melting chocolate, the mango body scrub from the body shop and something floral like rose or something.
“Why, thank you, kind sir.” giggled Draco as he prepared for his descent. “Wish me luck!” With that, he was gone, leaving Harry with a Lockhart who seemed to be calculating his next move.
While she worked, Remus’s mind drifted into a strange half-asleep montage of happy moments. The day he met Sirius, James and Peter on the train, the day they figured out how to get into the kitchens and spent the night gorging on everything they could find, Christmas that year when James gave everyone the new Sleakeazy’s hair potion and Sirius spent the next month and a half advertising it to everyone who would show even the slightest interest, even Lily Evans, to James’s humiliation. It was these thoughts that calmly transitioned him from the dark veil of night to the harsh judgement of day.
"Draco! Harry!" it said. He looked up to see Ron, Hermione, Fred and George, Ginny, Luna and Neville shoving their way past luggage and people to get to their group.
Harry exhaled heavily. “I’m fine.” They walked in silence for the rest of the way, as Draco knew better than to push, until Harry gestured to a shiny, red door. “We’re here.”
Draco first realised that there was something special about him and his situation when he was eleven, and a cold breeze had consumed him just as he was about to leave his love to risk his life, or when he watched an older version of himself using only his hands to strike ice into the hearts of his family.
“Screw that, I am going to be there with you, at your side.” Draco breathed heavily, teeth clenched. “You can’t stop me.”
He genuinely felt that Beauxbatons would be a good idea for Draco, or maybe Ivermorny, he would like America, but Moony was set against it, although Sirius didn’t know how he’d feel after this meeting.
“Of course it's okay! You’re my best friend!” The pair embrace and Harry let out a wet sob before pulling himself together and laughing.
“I know you’re not used to people caring about your life, but don’t die on me, Harry. I couldn’t handle it.”
“Just know that we’ll never leave you, Star.” he whispered into Draco’s hair. “We love you so, so much. Okay?”
Harry drifted calmly to sleep, with Draco’s warm breath on his nose and upper lip, and felt truly content.
“Oh yes, that was a good day. The slimy git had just banned stink bombs, and we were not happy.” Harry reverently closed the book and looked up at Sirius with open eyes. Lily’s eyes, he noted. He still felt that lurch in his stomach whenever Harry reminded him of his late best friends but, now it had a bittersweet tone. As though they were living on through their child. It made Sirius feel more hopeful about the future, which seemed so set in stone. “Harry, can we talk for a second?”
Draco had realized that Day was no longer in the air, and yet had not joined them for lunch. He softly told Harry about it and they decided to check the locker room to see if she was there. On the way, he mentioned to Harry that Day seemed to be a little depressed and Harry said that he noticed a little of that too. He once saw Day sitting at the steps to the castle, with Snuffles sitting beside her, staring out into the sunset, with a forlorn expression on her face.
"Now, this I got to hear. Last night. You left us to go to your room with Draco. I assumed something happened?" Sirius commented, laughing when Harry blushed.
Malfoy stopped in front of him and the two of them stared at each other for about five seconds. Then Harry lifted his right hand.
Everyone went back to their rooms and with a depressed air got ready for bed. Harry laid down in his bed for a moment, before getting up with his wand. He went to Draco's bed and crawled in, as Draco shifted nearer to the wall. Harry then set the alarm for the next morning and laid on his back, staring up at the starlit canopy. Draco sighed beside him, cast a silencing spell and turned to stare at Harry's face.
George then went on, whipping out a notebook and a quill, looking very serious, "Yes, and pray tell us the brand of the fertilizers your stupid and disgusting muggle relatives bought so that we can sell it in our shop as 'the fertilizer which made Harry Potter grow tall'! Bet that can bring in lots of galleons!"
Harry pushed himself back from Draco to look at Draco's eyes, filled with tenderness for him. He sniffed and nodded. "Well… I… everything hit me at one go. I knew about the Heir thing beforehand. But when I realized that you are also an Heir… At first I told myself that no one knew that you are Slytherin's Heir, so even if you don't get involved with the war, it's okay. I got pretty protective of you I guess. Then I find out that you are bonded to me. This kind of soul mate bond means that one cannot live without the other. And I don't want to lose you, Dray."
Draco grinned. "He's not sitting next to you. Sit, Snuffles." Draco said, as Sirius sat, happy that he was going to be allowed to eat at the table. Draco then filled the plate in front of Sirius with food from the different food bowls and Sirius started munching his food. "Snuffles, manners." Draco commented disapprovingly, and Sirius whimpered and slowed down his eating speed.
The food was cleared from the tables, but the students wanted to watch the game as well. The only professors who did not leave the hall were Professor Lupin and Professor Dumbledore. Jon and Joseph came to Ron and Draco, offering the use of their sets, to which Ron agreed. Thus the sets were laid out on the Gryffindor table. Seeing that so many people wanted to watch the game, Professor Lupin cast a spell in which the spectators looked at the front of the hall which served as a screen. This way, everyone would be watching the screen, and not at the four players, creating unnecessary pressure on them. The students were to be quiet as well.
Draco looked down at the offered hand, understanding what Harry was trying to show the whole school, and remembered Harry's rejection of friendship in his first year. Harry Potter was the first person whom he ever wanted to have as a friend and not acquaintances like Goyle and Crabbe. That night after the rejection Draco had lied awake on his bed swearing to himself that he was never going to let Harry Potter hurt him like that again. However, every time Harry defended that Weasley and insulted Draco, he was hurt again and again.
"That mutt had been pestering me to bring him to the infirmary. I brought him here and found the others outside. Hope you don't mind me here." Professor Lupin said hesitantly. Day gave him a small smile and greeted the rest. Hermione and Ginny rushed up to hug her, and both burst into tears. The others who were males sighed helplessly as Day patted the two crying girls on the back trying to soothe them, while the two girls were muttering about how good it was that Day was okay and how sorry they were for her and all. When they finally calmed down, they were peeled off Day by their boyfriends who were sending apologetic looks to Day. Day's reply was a smile at the two of them. For the rest of the hour, everyone was chatting with Day regarding unimportant things, till Madam Promfrey came to chase all the visitors out, saying that she needed the rest to recover from the blood loss. All of them left the room, promising to visit her when they were free. They went back to their dorm, silently promising themselves that they would give all the help Day required for the next few weeks.
