Hermione’s eyes turn sad, just for a second, before her previous concern takes over again.  “I wasn’t just talking about Draco hurting you. You could— you could
For once, Harry didn’t feel like rising to Malfoy’s ribbing. He turned around slowly, taking their surroundings in. He felt the tiny hairs along his arms stand on end. The back of his neck pricked.
“You gotta calm down, mate,” Ron mutters and rolls his eyes whenever he catches Harry in the act, but there’s a worried undertone to his words. Harry knows what bothers Ron: he thinks Harry will become all ‘
Malfoy must see a frown on Harry’s face, because he rolls his eyes with a sigh. “Don’t look at me like that, Potter. Cigarettes after sex are my only sin nowadays.”
It was past eleven when Draco walked into the Eighth Year Common Room, the books he had picked from the Library tucked under his arm. At this hour, he thought the Common Room would be deserted. Students usually didn’t stay up this late on weeknights.
Harry’s chest hurts. His eyes are burning. He feels the wetness in his eyes start to spill over his cheeks.
“Being a Magizoologist is a calling. I’m very aware of how lucky I am. People assume that I live in my own little world, and maybe I do. But I also know that not everybody knows what they want to do with their lives. Neville and I devote our lives to magical species conservation. In a way, we turned down a lot of other paths we could have taken instead. But...it’s our passion. We just don’t see the other life paths anymore. Our work is what truly matters.”
This morning, before breakfast, Draco tiptoed down the stairs to the Common Room. He had a task to complete. It would have been so much easier to ask Harry, but Draco still had too much to prove. To Harry, and to himself.
“I know,” Harry said with a rueful look at Draco. “Trust me, it would be so much easier to keep calling you ‘Malfoy’.”
“We’ll find something. For the both of us. Okay?” Harry ran his hand through his hair before pointing at the books in Draco's lap. “Anything interesting in there?”
Harry had held himself over him, sliding his erection between Draco’s arsecheeks until Draco was trembling, grasping at his neck and asking —
His eyes widened when he felt the oily slide of his finger against Harry’s hole. Harry jerked forward a bit, startled, nearly choking Draco. Draco pulled away and looked up at Harry in the semi-darkness. There was drool dripping from his chin but he couldn’t be arsed to wipe it.
“Okay,” Harry raises his eyebrows. “I thought you wanted to… talk. So you really want to go now, or—?”
Luna stared at him. Her eyes were unsettling. “Do they? Well. You asked how I felt about people looking up to me for being a war hero. I don’t...
“I’ll take care of the order. I can make the Muggle payment—my parents opened an account at Lloyds for me when I was sixteen.” She folded the paper and placed it in an envelope, her stern gaze traveling from Harry to Draco. “I’d like you to pay me back as soon as possible. Wizarding money is fine. Not that I worry that you won’t, but... it’s for the principle.”
“Are you plotting my murder now?” Malfoy’s mocking drawl snapped him out of his—whatever what had just happened was.
These first days breeze by, busy with learning to think of Draco as a real person rather than an abstract concept. Malfoy has been a distant memory for so long. As much as his presence used to drive Harry off the wall back at Hogwarts, Draco’s nastiness had quickly faded away in the face of Voldemort’s pure evil. Then… he’d covered for Harry at the Manor, a pivotal moment of truth — grey eyes, defeated and scared, boring into Harry's — and Harry had altogether stopped thinking of Draco as a thorn in his side.
Draco almost slid off his stool. The day already felt like a cart ride down into the Gringotts vaults, and he hadn’t even started asking her questions yet.
“Let’s have it out, once and for all,” Draco drawls. He sounds more confident than he feels. A matter of survival, when it comes to being in the presence of Harry Potter. “Since there’s a chance we’re going to be working in the same building for the rest of our lives.” He blows his fringe out of his eyes. “I want to hear you say it. Does it bother you that I am gay?”
Retracing his steps up until the — again, metaphorical — fall is a bit easier to approach. Harry focuses on rational, reasonable questions.
Draco had taken Harry’s wrist and guided his hand between his legs, all the while watching Harry with eyes dark with lust, and Harry had let him. He’d known, instinctively, to let Draco take charge of it. Draco had spread his legs further, fingers on Harry’s pulse point, until the tip of Harry’s middle finger had grazed the slicked skin of his rim. He’d taken a hissing inhale, and Harry had pressed inside, feeling Draco flutter and open around him.
Oh, come on. You’re just as interesting as the other people you’ve interviewed. Retellings of war can be so...black and white. I should know; I’ve been painted all-white or all-black for as long as I can remember. You, on the other hand...you’re the opposite of that. You don't fit into any of  the boxes. You’ve made some tough choices in a context that didn’t make it easy for you to do so.
He knew he was falling for Harry. He just hadn’t realised it had already happened. He holds onto the man in his arms, and knows that no matter what, he’s already lost.
Harry catches Draco’s eye. He feels like he can breathe again, Draco’s presence matching the brightness of the morning sunshine. They smile at each other for a long, cautiously sweet moment.
When they were fully dressed, albeit in clothes that wouldn’t pass the high standards of Auror uniforms for cleanliness if they were to be inspected, they approached the trapdoor again. Harry moved to pull the handle.
They come out on the third floor landing and Harry leans over the banister to look down at the stairwell and the other floors, all the way down to the foyer.
With an enthusiastic groan, Malfoy kissed him back, his hands rising to cup Harry’s face, sliding into his hair, pulling possessively. Harry moaned into his mouth, chasing the warmth of it with his tongue, finding Malfoy’s tongue and touching it tentatively first, then in a slow, languid caress that made Malfoy melt against him. Hands roaming Malfoy’s back, Harry pulled him close, diving into the kiss, blood pounding in his ears. They  slid to the floor without realising it. When Malfoy groaned into his mouth and pressed his body closer—fuck, Harry could feel the hard edge of his erection through their Auror robes—they toppled to the ground, Malfoy on top of him, pressed between his legs.
Split up with my girlfriend from school (are we going to pretend you don’t know who we’re talking about? I just—
Lots of people in the house last night (but I like them). Gran Narcissa is here. (Visiting. Sleeps in her rooms. They smell like
Draco’s mouth went dry. His hands dropped to Harry’s arse cheeks, tentatively pulling them apart. Harry let out a soft whine at the touch, and Draco was powerless to resist. He dropped to his knees, his hands on Harry’s hips, his face level with his arse. Harry glanced at him over his shoulder, an almost nervous glint in his eye.
Hermione," Harry says. “Very funny.” She snickers at his disgruntled expression but he hugs her anyway. “The birthday boy is already entertaining his other guests in his study. I was merely fetching you.”
“Let’s see if your arse is as amazing as it was ten years ago,” growled Harry, advancing towards Malfoy.
Draco shakes his head, stepping out of the phone box at the entrance of the Ministry and into the London night. It’s past ten o’clock on a cool, rainy Wednesday night in July, but the streets of Charing Cross are still bustling with life. Draco shoves his hands in his trouser pockets and sets off at a brisk pace, his head lowered against the drizzle. A group of young Muggles walk by, laughing raucously and taking much of the space on the pavement. One of the boys pulls one of the girls by the shoulder and in for a kiss on the cheek. The girl squeals, giggles, cuts herself short when she catches Draco’s eyes. “Sorry, mate,” the young bloke says, making room for Draco to pass.
Harry took a breath. “That night we spent together...the next morning, I was there. When Pansy asked you about me...I heard what you told her.”
“Here,” Draco says, backing a step. “Against the desk.” Harry's expression falters, a split second of hesitation, and Draco bares his teeth. “Stop being so goddamn mushy, Potter. For fuck’s sake, just… just take me like a fucking man—”
“Merlin!” Harry threw his hands up and stepped back and away from Draco. “Fuck, you’re just as selfish and heartless as you’ve ever been, aren’t you?”
“You don’t have to apologise,” he told Draco, voice low. “I... I know what you’ve been through. I’m not saying you were never awful to me and my friends, but... the war had us all do some pretty fucked-up shite.” He nodded sharply at the look Draco gave him. “Yeah, even me. Mental, huh?” He gave a rueful, crooked little smile. “What I’m saying is... I think you’ve changed. You’ve changed your mind. About me, and about a lot of other things. Am I wrong?”
“I’m really glad. Thank you, Ernestina,” Harry says. He makes an effort to stand tall and upright as he is hit by contradicting waves of sadness and relief. And underneath, dread — that Draco’s made his decision about Harry, that he’s meeting him one final time before sending him away, discarding him along with the memories of their disastrous shared past.
The door opens to reveal a sliver of corridor and Malfoy standing in the threshold, in a t-shirt and a pair of joggers he borrowed from Harry. His hair hangs in his eyes, still damp from his shower. Harry waits, blood thrumming under his skin.
He slides his hand in his pocket, touching the warm, round, metallic shape nestled at the bottom. The golden Snitch is still safely tucked there. Harry’s never told anyone that he carries the Snitch around. He can picture his friends’ faces if they’d ever found out: Ron’s quietly worried frown, Hermione’s intense expression as she’d launch into a lecture about the dangers of clinging to the past. Harry’s old Snitch is inoffensive, anyway. The Stone that had been hidden inside is long gone. The Snitch is an empty shell, nothing but a harmless token from Harry’s teenage years now. But it’s still something that grounds Harry in reality, helps him remember what he’s been through, where he’s come from. And that, in the vapid succession of charity galas and theatre premieres and expensive dinners Harry is constantly invited to, is priceless enough to hold on to.
“Potter,” he says, his natural drawl loaded with a showy nonchalance. “I was just about to go for a run. If you’d like to join me…?”
Draco put his hands on Harry’s waist as Harry wrapped his arms around his shoulders, bringing them closer.
“One thing I think all our readers are interested to know, Luna, is how you moved on after the war. Do you want to tell me more about that?”
“Feels so good, Harry. You feel amazing. This—” Draco starts. Has to stop when Harry twists his fist to squeeze them tighter. “This is even better than what I imagined it would be.”
“You will be in charge,” Malfoy’s slow drawl resounds in the warmth of his office, and the quiet formality of his tone is all the answer Harry needs, “of planning my trips and escorting me to and from the Caduceus offices in the City, where I go to on a daily basis, but also to any place and event where I need to be. You will do the same for my son, Scorpius, who goes to school three mornings a week and has appointments with his therapist two afternoons a week. In addition, you will also check any incoming post or parcels for curses and poison.” He keeps pacing, his lithe, graceful silhouette stark against the flames in the fireplace. It makes his hair glow gold. “You are expected to work closely with the other personnel under me: Ernestina, who is Scorpius’s nanny, and who’s also in charge of the house’s logistics; Jemima, my assistant; Lux, my driver. You will be holding a position formerly occupied by Gregory Goyle, who — as you very well know — is a close friend of mine. He was also deeply appreciated by the rest of my team. The success of your trial period will greatly depend on how well you get on and coordinate with these people. I need a team who’s united; I have no time or patience for dealing with quarrels and tempers. Disruptive elements tend to get sacked pretty quickly.” He stops pacing and finally looks up at Harry. “Is everything clear?”
He’d caught Harry’s wistful eyes across the table. Everybody knew about Fred Weasley’s death in the Battle of Hogwarts. Draco had heard his parents discuss it during the days leading to the trials. He didn’t really know Fred Weasley, yet the thought of another classmate’s life being lost to the war had left him feeling strangely bereft for weeks. Retrospectively, it must have been a symptom of his numbered demon days.
“Harry,” Draco tells him. Harry’s head snaps up to meet Draco’s gaze. His expression is back to carefully neutral. The moment they were having is gone, and Draco feels a pang in his gut. He let out a controlled exhale. “Does this—” he tilts his head towards his arm, “—bother you?”
Every Saturday now, Harry has breakfast with him, Scorpius and Ernestina. The four of them share comforting, hearty food and cups of hot tea while planning the day ahead. Ernestina throws appraising glances between him and Harry, and Draco guiltily hopes the house-elf has no Legilimency powers, or he’s in for the dressing-down of his life. Harry patiently listens to Scorpius tell him about the new Chopin piece he’s practicing — this month’s new favourite — and nods in all the right places even though he obviously doesn’t know the first thing about classical music.
Call it instinct. Call it surviving being the epicentre of the last two wizarding wars. Call it living under the Dursleys’ roof for eleven years. He knows there’s someone else hiding among the coat racks the way you know your heart is beating. On and on, automatic. The hair on his nape stands on end. He’s got half a mind to find that person, see for himself…
“But that’s too much responsibility!” Hermione jumps in her seat, clearly wanting to throw her hands up or thump on the table. Hugo squeals happily, and she makes an effort to calm down. “You can’t carry the future of Malfoy, his family, his entire company on your shoulders alone, Harry. What’s in it for you?”
“I always forget about the bloody smog,” he said, wiping his eyes with the back of his gloved hand. “We could have Flooed.”
“I want you,” Harry whispered. “I want you now. I want you when we’re done. I want you tomorrow.” He leaned in. “I want
“Right on my prostate,” Harry confirmed through gritted teeth, having only avoided an early climax by squeezing the base of his cock almost painfully tight.
“Hey, Malfoy. Mind if we join you here?” Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Luna stood at the entrance of the dining room, looking at him expectantly. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“Yes!” Relieved for the prompt, the boy stood straighter. “Yes, the Headmistress sent me to let Draco Malfoy know that he is expected in her office!”
McGonagall had allowed the constitution of four Quidditch teams with players selected on their abilities and talent. Each team was made up of seven players, one of each year. Eighth Years, who were a post-war anomaly in the otherwise pristine new curriculum, had been deemed adults and thus excluded from the team.
I was on the right side. At first, I believed in the ideals my parents had been feeding me for years. It was only after seeing those ideals in practice that I realised how horrifically wrong I had been. By that point, it was too late for me to back out.
“The company is based abroad,” Hermione'd insisted, “British rules may not apply. That could be a way to win the case.” She’d called a certain Ella DiCara — a Ravenclaw four years above them, now a civil rights solicitor — to confirm her intuitions, but Ella hadn’t had time to get back to her yet. Harry had tried not to worry. He’d tried to trust his instincts, Draco and Hermione’s intelligence, and the fact that what he knew of Kingsley painted him as fundamentally just.
“I thought London would be more fun.” Gabrielle Delacour lets out a listless sigh and pouts. “Fleur assured me ze English men were ‘ot and adventurous.” She shrugs. “So far, ze most adventurous thing zat ‘appened to me was when zat guy tripped in ze pub and spilled his beer in my lap.”
“If the Chosen One says so,” he muttered, and shaking Harry’s hand off him, he stalked to a corner of the room where Harry could make out a simple, carved wooden bench. He plopped himself on it with a sigh and put his head in his hands.
Draco flinched at the noise. Lifting his head from his pillow, he checked that his roommates were all still fast asleep: Longbottom was sprawled on his stomach, head almost buried under his pillow; Blaise was snoring on his back with his arms crossed over his chest
“He’s right, Harry,” Hermione had said, her hands on Ron’s shoulders, a happily tipsy Luna following her, “Hogwarts reunions only happen once in a decade. Loosen up a little!”
Harry was watching him, worried and amused, his lifted eyebrows taunting Draco. He had his elbows on the fence of the skating rink. The rest of the Eighth Year group zoomed past him on the rink, bursts of laughter and the occasional helpless yelp reaching Draco before they moved further down the ice.
To the readers who waited for this fic to be done before reading: I sincerely hope the story makes sense as a whole, and not just chapter by chapter :) I wrote this in about a month, and it's hard to have any perspective on it for the moment :) It might be imperfect on many levels, but it's still been an incredibly fun ride for me. I hope it shows, and I hope you had a good time reading, too!
Draco sidesteps their group and walks faster. He wishes, idly, that he could have brought his running clothes. Lets out a rueful laugh at the thought. Running would help him think, for sure — but the streets are full of Muggles, and he can’t be arsed to hide and transfigure all his clothes for the half hour it would take to run home.
And now that Draco’s here, bathed in the soft afternoon glow, turning the dreary hospital room brighter, Harry can’t bring himself to regret it.
She flashes Harry one last look, somewhere between sternness and amusement, and glides out of the room.
Harry’s still bewildered. “Draco,” he says, holding his hands out. “Nesting is a company that sells children’s things… it’s so bloody
for Draco... then not even Harry’s Saviour goodwill would save him from public scorn. That was what Draco’s love could do to the reputation of even the best, most loved figure of the wizarding world.
Malfoy let out a little laugh and knelt between Harry’s spread legs. “Such a bossy Gryffindor,” he murmured with a wicked smile. He slid his fingers into Harry’s crease. His smile broadened when he heard Harry’s breath catch. “Don’t worry, Potter. I’m not one to leave last wishes
“It seems neither your house-elf nor your son have the potential to be Bond villains, either,” Harry tells him.
Harry startles so hard he practically falls from his seat. He knows that voice. His breath catches in his throat.
“Never,” Draco gave Mephistopheles his most angelic smile. It was quite something, given that he was the literal opposite of an angel.
“This is a fucking nightmare,” he whispers, half-hoping Draco won’t hear him. He clutches Draco’s back tighter, and Draco holds him, one hand cupping the back of his head. “Draco… it's fucking impossible.”
“But now... you can,” Luna mused. “We all have a future now. Even you.” She scratched Jeff behind the ears. The Niffler let out a satisfied purr. He opened a sliver of eye and winked at Draco.
“What I mean to say,” Malfoy interrupts him, voice harsh, “is that if you ever imply that I wanted my child to be some kind of a piano prodigy, and I
Malfoy’s face remains set, irritatingly unreadable. “No, Potter. I assume it was a last-minute invitation, and they scrambled to find a free seat for you, because you’re here alone.”
“When Harry started working here…" Hermione hesitates, then says, "I read more on Caduceus’ activities. Until then, I mainly knew Draco’s company for its biggest hit, shall we say...”
you.” His mouth is a harsh, defeated line. He shifts his eyes away, towards the door. “But I need to think.”
He’d hoped he might be able to take his time with Malfoy too. Savour it. And with Malfoy gone, he wonders if it’s all been a strange fever dream, a passing fantasy, a fad. Harry second-guesses himself some nights. Maybe he doesn’t like blokes after all. Maybe he was just gay for Malfoy, which doesn’t seem completely implausible — who in their right minds wouldn’t?
have. Years of therapy. Dealing with plaguing nightmares, with agoraphobia, with chronic insomnia. We’re all broken, in one way or another. We all try to repair ourselves. I’m no different than the other survivors, and neither are you. Why would I be more special, more unique than my friends? Like Luna said, I’m just...
“Hi, Draco,” Harry says, meeting Malfoy’s eyes. After a week of calling him by his given name, it still has a strange flavour on his tongue. It’s still a small, furtive intimacy that somehow feels important, significant, and forbidden at the same time. It’s unsettling, when Harry’s used to calling almost everyone he knows by their given names without a second thought.
“Your father,” Jeff said, “is rotting in Azkaban because quite frankly, he does evil so effortlessly, he puts professional demon like you to shame. And since when do you care about human parents? You’ll be off to your next assignment in less than half a year and will never hear the name ‘Malfoy’ again.”
“You may be right about everything you told me yesterday, but you’re wrong about — about Draco.” Harry rubs his jaw, turning the words that come next over in his head before saying them. “He’s still the same in so many ways — all sharp edges and dry wit — but he’s changed. He’s genuinely made amends. He’s trying to be the best person he can. If you saw him with his little boy… With his employees… you wouldn’t believe your eyes at first. Still… when we talk, Hermione, it’s so easy. It’s like the walls drop between us. And the mix of the old Draco Malfoy, who used to drive me round the bend just by existing, and the new one, who’s clever and good and who’s my friend… it’s making me crazy for him. I want to be with him. I want him. I know it might jeopardise this case. Possibly my whole future. I feel so… laughable.” He lifts his eyes to his friend, almost in apology. “Do you think I am?”
He doesn’t want to offend Ernestina though, especially since it’s the first time that he’s alone with her. The house-elf could have a wealth of information on her master — and besides, there’s something intriguing about her confident demeanour, so different from most of the house-elves Harry’s met in his life. It brings back bittersweet memories of Dobby, and Harry wants to find out more about her.
Draco wanted to scream. He pressed his lips together. “Still... you should tell him, some day,” she murmured. “He might be waiting for you to.”
When he slid the piece of parchment in front of Draco, Draco squinted to decipher Harry's messy scrawl. He was answering Draco's question.
“Yeah, yeah,” Ron says, lifting his hands. “No Auror mode tonight. Which means I’ve a desperate need to get sloshed and eat a tray of canapés. I reckon it’s time we go celebrate your crush’s thirty first, yeah?”
Like—” Harry nips at his earlobe and Draco is interrupted by his own embarrassing squeak. “Like what?”
Draco sighs. “You know how well he deals with change. Thanks ever so much for that.” He smiles at the thought. “I still can’t believe you’re leaving.”
He had hated Dumbledore more than ever in that moment. The Headmaster’s statement was a reminder that Draco’s association with Voldemort had him shooting too high for his level of evilness. A reminder that he’d never be good enough, that he’d always fail, as a human and as a demon and he really
He opens his palm under Harry’s nose. Inside are the eight Galleons and five Sickles previously in Harry’s pockets, and the golden Snitch that Harry’s carried around for years without anybody knowing about it.
They sat in silence for a moment, Harry slowly closing his eyes to enjoy the music, Draco watching him, trying to make sense of what he was listening to.
“I’m not betraying you,” Harry murmurs. His fingers slide between Draco’s, back and forth, a reminder of their first touch.
“What now?” Harry asks, knowing full well there’s no escaping the questioning that’s going to follow. He rolls his eyes in preemptive defense.
For a second, Harry looked like he’d been slapped. Then he scowled, a dark glint in his eyes. “You’re absolutely correct. I do
Malfoy’s eyes twinkle in the dimness. “A part of me you’re already well acquainted with. Now, let’s get you to meet the rest of me. Don’t worry, I’m delightful throughout.”
He straightens sharply, hip jutting to the side, arse pushed back. Blowing on his fringe, he takes his enraptured audience in and smirks. “Now
“I think he wants to be alone,” Harry tells everyone when he steps out on the grass. Blaise and Pansy look like they sobered up in the last five minutes. Hermione and Ron look like they’d rather be anywhere but here.
Your attention. Your touch. Like an infatuated teenager.” His eyes go back to Harry. “It has to stop.”
He heaved a sigh of relief. And then a certain white-blond git standing in front of the buffet turned in his direction, and Harry felt the Great Hall tilt.
“Aw, darling.” Hermione plants a kiss on her husband’s cheek. “All right, the kids are with Molly and Arthur until tomorrow afternoon. I intend to drink my weight in champagne.” She pushes the study door open and disappears inside. The sound of polite greetings reach the corridor as Harry regards Ron with a raised eyebrow, the question lingering in the air.
The door to the boys’ locker room was on the side of the pitch. It was almost too dark to see it, but Harry—and Malfoy—had walked to Quidditch practice so often, he was certain they could have found it in their sleep.
The realisation hits Draco like a spell. Harry has somehow managed to truly and decisively feel like a friend, despite him being the last person Draco should trust. Surely, the feelings he’s harboured for Harry for years are muddling his judgment… Against all odds, Draco's started to think of Harry as someone he cares about. And if that’s how he feels for him, then there’s a painful irony in reminding him of how much they used to
Harry clutches at the coats, groping for purchase as Malfoy starts working him relentlessly. He finds the cold metal rail and grabs it, arms over his head, pants around his knees, Malfoy’s mouth on his cock. He chokes back a moan when Malfoy pulls off with teasing slowness.
Refusing to let his guilt take over, Harry leans back in his chair. He’s had ample time to examine his feelings about the fight he’d had with Malfoy in that dark, abandoned bathroom, and the blood-curdling realisation that Malfoy could have been the first person — the
“Potter, you uncouth heathen. It’s your last hour on earth and you choose to fill it with an unhealthy amount of fat and sugar. How unexpected.”
“Turn around,” he orders, and Draco complies, pulling his trousers and pants down his thighs as he does. Harry crowds behind him, his hard cock already out, sliding against Draco’s bare arse. He grips Draco’s hips with possessive hands and shoves them back against him. “I wanted to fuck you long and slow,” he groans into Draco’s ear, leaning over his back, “but I’m going to take you like an animal. ‘Cause that’s what you want, right?”
and Daddy will dance with Harry. I will play, and Harry will take Daddy for a spin. (Like they do when they think I'm not looking.) Daddy will take Harry's face in his hands and kiss him like he does when he thinks I'm not looking. (On the lips. Eyes closed. Smiling.) (I'm looking a lot more often than they think.) They will dance together. (That slow, swaying hug they call dancing.) Balzac will bounce around them, will bark like he does when he's laughing. My magic will wrap around me like a sunny cloud. Like a blanket. I will play, and play, and play.
the wizarding world had to rely on independent apothecaries and potion Masters. There were barely any standards in brewing potions, and quality and strength would vary widely from one potioneer to the next. It’s as if the entire Potions industry was freelance. And that wasn’t the only limitation!” Hermione points a finger up, and everybody around the table listens. “If everyone works in their own corners, there’s no confronting ideas. There’s no discussing about what works, what could work better, what others are doing that could inspire us. There’s no innovation!” She pushes her chair back and gets up, setting her glass on the table and gesturing to the other guests, tipsy and passionate. “Innovation! It’s the crux of the matter! The Muggle world has progressed in tremendous leaps over the last century, and where has the wizarding world stood in the meantime? Teaching children potions and spells that have not budged an inch since the Middle Ages, and never once looking beyond its meticulously groomed fences to take inspiration from the way other humans lived!”
Darkness or not, Harry could recognise Malfoy’s long-suffering sigh anywhere. “I can’t believe you ever received a letter from Hogwarts, Potter, let alone graduated from the same school as me.” A pause so thick Harry could have cut it with a
“Draco?” Matilda calls from near the door. “Could you show me again, please? I bend just fine, I think, but I’m not sure the ‘snap’ part looks very sexy yet.”
“It’s true! You told me all about your plans and your big project. You both want to improve magical and Muggle cures and it’s… it’s good work, you know? What you’re working on… it shows heart, and passion. It’s not just all Hermione’s doing, also. Even though you’re absolutely brilliant,” Ron adds for Hermione’s benefit, and she beams. “It’s like Malfoy really wants to help create some kind of better future. I’ve been on the job for years, Harry. I can sniff out when someone isn’t genuine about something.”
“Not with everyone around—” The words seem to have escaped Potter’s mouth before he could stop them. He stands back, wide-eyed and blushing. Draco stares. All the air seems to have left his lungs.
“To your second point,” Ron adds almost apologetically, “we have a way to get you started with Malfoy that we hope looks natural and unsuspicious.”
“Old habits die hard.” It was the closest to an apology Draco wanted to give him. It was mean-spirited, he knew. It wasn’t Harry’s fault he felt that way about him; in fact, Harry had never done anything worthy of a crush.
After his three-year post-war house arrest, Malfoy had moved to France with his mother. Lucius Malfoy had died in Azkaban six months prior to their leaving the country. His funeral had been the only outing Draco and Narcissa had been allowed during their confinement. With no money, no property, and no Lucius, there was virtually nothing keeping the remaining Malfoys in England. The family owned a small flat in Paris, one that the British Ministry had not been able to confiscate for lack of a legal agreement with the other country, and that’s where Draco and his mother had stayed.
“I’ll make it up to you in a couple of hours,” Hermione says, waggling her eyebrows. Harry lifts a hand to stop her.
“...absurdly lucky, you’ve managed to slip through our net for so long, and now you’re resisting arrest?... Ah, Malfoy, Malfoy…” Smith shakes his head theatrically. “Malfoy… Such bad decisions. Such a way of making your case worse. Wouldn’t it have been
“It’s Harry to you, Malfoy,” he grinned, at odds with the moment Draco was having. “And I never thought you were stupid.”
His gaze falls on Harry’s lips. Just like that, they’re close. So close, Harry can feel Malfoy’s breath on his face, can feel his chest brush Malfoy’s with every inhale. He leans in first — or maybe it’s Malfoy, it’s hard to tell, everything is starting to blur — and their lips hover over each other’s, not touching, not yet.
“Leave it. It doesn’t matter. I don’t give a fuck why you never sought me out again after that night. I just—I just wish you’d respect my work enough to stay out of it, if you choose to refuse to take part in it. Like Luna’s work, it’s my fucking
Harry had a good feeling about Malfoy’s house when he came in for his interview. And ten minutes after moving in that Monday are enough to confirm that he actually likes the place quite a lot.
Harry shook his head. There was no annoyance in the gesture, just affection. “Draco...I was being honest when I said this hadn’t anything to do with you. You know I don’t do interviews. Not with you. Not with anyone. And I never will.”
“Fuck, Harry, I knew it, I knew you’d be such a good little bottom,” Malfoy was groaning against his shoulder, his fat cock pushing in and out of him, bringing him closer to his climax with each thrust. “Fuck,” he was saying, “your wet little hole is so tight I could come in seconds, are you close, Harry, I can tell that you’re close—”
“I’ll keep returning their memos. I’ll keep sending them information. I’ve been gathering proof of your innocence and I’ll keep building your case… if you actually
“Gentlemen,” Kingsley sits at his desk. He folds one large hand on top of the other. “Thank you for meeting me at such short notice, but as Ron already knows, this required some urgency. A case just opened that the Ministry has hoped to take on for a few years.”
Harry sighed. His exasperation wasn’t directed at Draco, however. “I want you to know once and for all,” he said, “that I will
“What I was saying, gentlemen,” Smith was droning on, “is that the families are grateful for your work on this case. There will be a ceremony to celebrate the safe return of magic and Muggle fugitives alike. Of course, the ones who wish to remain in the caves of Ben MacDui will be able to do so, as long as they reside there in safer conditions than they previously did. Authorities will know to check in on them regularly and make sure they have provisions and water, at the very least. And all concealing magic that exists around the various entrances to the mountain, such as the one you’ve discovered in the refuge, will be cleared by our best team of Curse-Breakers.”
“Yeah… I’d rather we don’t tell anyone about… this.” Malfoy hadn’t called what they were, what they’d done,
Draco slid a look over at Harry. He caught his green gaze a second before Harry turned to McGonagall again.
Have you ever sucked cock? I bet you would be amazing at it. Merlin, with that mouth and those lips— I’m going to teach you so good, Harry, you’re going to be the best at it, the best cocksucker wizarding Britain’s ever seen—” Draco’s babbling now, but he can’t stop, because Harry’s moaning at each of Draco’s thrusts and filthy promises, and he’s matching the rhythm of Harry’s hips, frantic and breathless. “And I’ll get on my knees for you too, trust me, I’m dying to, and you’ll fuck me so good I’ll forget my own name, say it, say what you’ll do to me—”
Harry and Ernestina turn around at the same time to find Malfoy standing at the bottom of the stairs leading down to the kitchen.
“You liked it?” Harry asks. It’s a stupid question. He’d been there. He’d… felt how much Malfoy enjoyed it. He can’t help feeling insecure. It was his first time, after all.
“Merlin, Seamus, please tell me you and I aren’t that gross,” Thomas laughed. His boyfriend closed his arms around him in a tight bear hug.
“Harry, regardless… if you were to act on it, you’d be starting a relationship with your prime suspect. Who knows you’re working on the case. And would have to either be stupid not to mind, or have ulterior motives. Ethically speaking… it’s a nightmare.”
“Maybe,” Luna said, leaning forward, elbows on her knees. “But you of all people should know: just because the public says so, doesn’t
Harry fights the slow smile that threatens to spread on his face. Oh, this is going to be easy. So easy. Verbal sparring with Malfoy is like riding a broom — you never forget how to fly, no matter how long you’ve gone without it.
“What brings you here? For real,” he speared the Niffler with a hard look. “You never check in on me, even less so visit me inside the castle.”
The last time I helped, it earned me a mild scolding from your friend Granger. She’s incredibly hung-up when it comes to rules.
“I’m bloody fantastic,” Draco told him. His voice came out rough and gravelly. It brought the image of Jeff the Niffler to mind, and Draco shook his head and suppressed a smile. He looked up at Harry. “Want me to continue?”
to you in the throes of an orgasm doesn’t count. To quote a certain celebrity wizard, you can’t ‘ask me for things when I’m weak and pliant’.
“Me too,” Draco tells him mindlessly, arching his neck into Harry’s touch. “Me too,” he says again, just because he can.
“Yes, well, he didn’t want Minerva finding out. And seeing as I don’t live at the castle, it made more sense for—”
One: Harry would have to explain why he didn’t try to stop a thief — a delinquent! — that he’d caught red-handed.
The ghost of little fingers running on piano keys lingers in the air, and Harry follows Malfoy out of the room.
And not just because of the sex, though that part had been unforgettable. Harry only has to close his eyes to picture Malfoy arching under him, pushing back against Harry’s cock with greedy little moans. The way he’d come in Harry’s arms, the way he’d contentedly curled up against Harry afterwards, like he belonged in the space of Harry’s body. Like they were lovers, and not passing strangers getting a leg over for one night. That’s what Harry misses: that intense, crackling connection he’s never felt with anyone else.
“Maybe you should consider changing your logo,” Harry suggests. As soon as the words are out, five pairs of eyes turn towards him. The only person who seems to have no idea what they’re talking about is Ron, who shrugs from the other side of the table. Harry squirms in his chair. “I mean… it’s rather ominous, isn’t it? The snake, the wand shooting sparks?...”
In the middle of the room stands a small, olive-skinned house-elf with long floppy ears and huge, inquisitive brown eyes. She’s dressed in actual clothes, not the tea towel or pillowcase house-elves usually wear. Her short-sleeved blouse and pale pink trousers are clean and meticulously pressed. Harry locks eyes with her and she stares at him for a second, an inscrutable expression on her face, her gaze flicking up and down the dark grey Muggle coat he’s wearing over a black suit and burgundy turtleneck jumper.
Hermione rummages in her jeans’ pocket and takes out a couple of gold coins. She hands them to Ron. “Here you go. I’ll give you the rest when I get my hands on my purse.”
Jeff cast him a beseeching look, made even more convincing by his powerless position, dangling from Luna Lovegood’s hands.
In a normal situation, he would have expected Malfoy to point his finger in his face and say something along the lines of
Draco's head snaps around to look at him over his shoulder. His eyes are cool, gleaming in the pale light of a Lumos floating above them. He raises an eyebrow in response to the closed door.
Later, Draco had taken the cushions from the sofa and laid them on the carpet in front of the fire, explaining that he was getting cold. He’d laid Harry on his back and straddled him, his hair a wild, golden halo around his face, his eyes indecently dark. He’d taken Harry’s cock and frotted against him until Harry was hard again. Then he’d guided Harry inside him, still loose from their previous fucking. Harry’d watched Draco as he’d ridden Harry, sinking down on his cock again and again. It had been late, and the fire had been dying, and Harry had felt so in love he could have died there, too.
“You rejected me, Malfoy.” Harry despises the hurt he hears in his own voice. “Explain to me why you did it, or leave me alone.”
Harry takes a few steps around the waiting room. From the window, the garden looks still and silent in the cold winter air; a couple of blue tits fly from one branch of a black cherry tree to another. He walks to one of the sofas, unbuttons his jacket and sits down. The cushion is comfortable but firm, the leather soft and buttery; everything about it speaks of tasteful wealth. Not that Harry doesn’t have more money than he can hope to spend in a lifetime, himself. But he’s aware that when it comes to interior design and decoration, Grimmauld Place will forever remain the motley combination of old, antique furniture inherited from his godfather’s Black family, Harry’s Ikea acquisitions from his post-Hogwarts years, and the odd Chudley Cannons banner.
“I’m talking about your skipping classes, not about your having sex!” Hermione had said. Her face had softened at the thought. She’d looked from Draco to Harry with a smile. “Congratulations, by the way!”
Those sharp cheekbones. That tiny, pert arse Harry could imagine pressed against the palms of his hands…
Just when Harry was opening his mouth to retort, fists clenched and eyes flashing, Longbottom cleared his throat.
“In a hurry, Potter?” he asked. Harry didn’t need to see his face to picture the gloating expression of it. It was all in his tone.
“I lied,” Malfoy admits, so low Harry has to strain to hear. “You can experiment with me.” He meets Harry’s eyes straight on, and there’s something both resolved and supplicant in them. “You can experiment with me all you like.”
“Is that it, Headmistress?” Harry asked next to Draco. He sounded calm, the opposite of how Draco felt. McGonagall leaned forward slightly. She looked at them from over her spectacles.
“Goodbye, Potter,” he says, low enough that the barking journos don’t hear him, but Harry reads his lips.
Harry rolled his eyes but dropped his hand. “Merlin, Draco. I thought I asked you to call me Harry.”
Merlin, do they look pitiful. Monday morning faces that last all week. Draco can’t go on like this, or their cheerlessness will end up rubbing off on him.
He finally reached it. It was a massive oak tree, standing eerily still in the middle of an open clearing. Its trunk and leaves were bright red as if on fire, glowing unnaturally in the darkness surrounding it. Draco had always thought the look of the ancient red oak tree was fitting.
It’s only been a week since Potter started working as Draco’s bodyguard, and Draco is already feeling comfortable around him.
“I’m not sure…" Boyle hesitates, then adds, "It will depend on how well they cooperate.” She nods towards Draco and his house-elf.
As McGonagall walked down the stairs briskly a few paces ahead of them, Draco pulled Harry by the sleeve and brought him to a halt.
“But there are no illegal activities conducted through my companies,” Draco counters, and it’s so fast and spontaneous any remaining doubts Harry could have on Draco’s innocence vanish into thin air.
He no longer smells like an ad for expensive cologne and Italian holidays. He smells like sex, like spunk, like heated skin.
Draco does. It’s a scramble, hands fisting in hair, eyes scrunched closed, tongues and teeth and the small thrusts of hips against hips, innocuous at first, unnoticed, and it’s almost too late when Draco realises he’s not going to be able to stop this, to stop what comes next. Harry's thigh has slid between his open legs and he's rutting against him.
“God, Draco.” Harry exhales, his breath stuck in his throat. “As she should be. It was… quite frightening, actually. I’m sorry, maybe you don’t want to hear it—” But Draco shakes his head, wide-eyed, and waves at him to continue. “It was like... like too much magic contained in too small a place… ready to explode. I’ve seen accidental magic before. Hell, I’ve done accidental underage magic before… but that was something else.”
“That’s not… what I was going to say.” Harry hesitated, fiddling with his fork. He’d totally forgotten how to eat food.
“It was a coincidence, Malfoy,” Harry said between kisses, his hands working the fastenings of Draco’s trousers.
“Wait.” Harry had grabbed his wrist, his lips a breath away from Draco’s. He’d gazed at him through half-closed eyes and grinned. “I got you a birthday gift.”
But he never smiled as much as he did when Harry moved in with us. I asked Nestine about it. Her forehead crinkled, like she knew something I didn’t. (I doubt it.) She told me,
“We’re just going through the hypotheses, Draco,” Hannah Abbott says, lifting her eyebrows. “If you weren’t snogging, then judging by the abused state of our poor office door it was either a rather vigorous fistfight, or—”
“No,” Potter growls. He doesn’t move from the spot he’s been standing in since the beginning of their little exchange.
“Don't remind me!” He hears Hermione’s irritated voice before he sees her. She holds a stuffed unicorn and a miniature Knight Bus that rumbles and smokes like the real thing in one hand, and pushes her bushy curls out of her face with the other.
This time, Harry laughs. He throws his head back, barely feeling the cold rain. “Fine. Don’t say it. I don’t need you to tell me, I just needed you to know.”
Daddy and Harry both took me to the same jewelry store. (Five days apart.) They both want it to be a surprise for the other. Picked rings that match in shape and design. (One silver, one gold.)
“As discussed at the beginning of the month, I do not expect you to have a definite career plan laid out. However, I would like to see evidence that you to have given your professional future some thought. It is fine to not know precisely what you want to do when you graduate Hogwarts; though this shouldn’t discourage students from starting to research their options.”
be ashamed of this.” His fingers squeezed Draco’s. “No matter what people might say. No matter what you hear. Alright?”
“Yes, Headmistress?” he said. With her, he always had a respectful, deferential tone that Draco wouldn’t have thought possible of Harry Potter.
Draco's face dropped. “This bodes extremely badly. Last time you introduced me to something unexpected I had a rash on my genitals for weeks.”
Harry can feel his voice rising from a whisper, feels like he’s shouting in the quiet bedroom. “It might have not been the case months ago, but it is now. I’m… whatever you want me to be. Your lover. Your partner. Your goddamned
“Oh, I think we’re both winners in this game.” Malfoy’s teeth glinted as he smiled. “Especially if you properly fuck me.”
Draco’s fists clench against his sides, like he wants to reach out and grab the parchment, but forces himself to stand still. He still looks beautifully dishevelled, loose locks of pale gold hair falling in his eyes, and Harry’s heart skips a painful beat.
Speaking of, he finds her in the ‘Eldridge Family’s Wands Through the Ages’ room. She’s standing near the buffet, deep in conversation with an older couple over a tray of canapés. Next to her, Ron looks green around the gills, his eyes darting up fearfully at the giant paper maché spider hanging over the table. Hermione is in public relations mode already, too busy to notice the sheen of cold sweat on her boyfriend’s brow. Harry recognizes the people she’s talking to from seeing their pictures in the papers. Mr and Mrs Peterson, American expatriates whose children are currently studying at Hogwarts, and honorary members of the school’s Board of Directors.
“The club is made up of war heroes, young adults still in school, and former ferrets, Malfoy,” Weasley explained, mock-punching him in the shoulder.
Draco caught up with Ginny, the others on his heels. When he saw him, Jeff ran to him and fell on his knees, gripping Draco’s bootlaces pleadingly.
Luna’s face lit up. She clapped her hands together. “Oooh, how adorable! People are the funniest. It’s understandable, though. Neville and I met in the most romantic way.”
it. Demons’ flair for the dramatic got tedious after a while. Yet the tree was a part of him, almost comforting. He approached it carefully. He laid his hand on the gnarled trunk. The rough bark was warm. Draco had often wondered if it was blood, not sap, that was coursing underneath it. He waited another quiet moment, the sound of his breathing his only company. He wished he could be back in the Library, pretending to study for his Potions homework like the rest of his Eighth year classmates on a normal Tuesday night of December. He liked sitting next to his friends, listening to the comforting scratching of quill on parchment. He liked the chance to feel Harry’s gaze on him—Harry, who kept meeting Draco’s gaze across rooms and smiling at him. Since they’d returned for their Eighth Year, he didn’t even bother being surreptitious about it.
“School supplies won’t be necessary,” Draco tells him, wrapping his arms around Harry's neck and bringing him flush against him. Harry’s tongue darts to lick his lip ring, and Draco laughs. “My teaching style focuses on practical work.”
When they reach the door, Draco turns to gaze at his friend. Greg holds himself still, waiting for Draco’s orders. Just like he’s always done since they first met at the age of five, two little pureblood wizards from neighbouring families in Wiltshire.
“That’s because the last good men in England have all landed in Draco’s bed,” adds Lavender with a wistful sigh.
Malfoy doesn’t move out of Harry’s space, but he rubs his palm on his trousers, an affronted look on his face. The irony of it makes Harry swallow a burst of giggles.
“All right, all right!” Draco pushes his hair out of his eyes, pops the top two buttons of his shirt, and stretches his shoulders and neck. “The ‘Bend and Snap’, now. Easy. Watch and learn, babes.” He leans over the closest desk and grabs a quill. “Let’s assume the target of your…
Words he’d never felt the need to explore in his past lives. Words that were now seemingly part of his new human life.
“Call me Harry,” he gasps, Malfoy’s hand still working his leaking cock. “And tell me what you want.”
If Harry closes his eyes, he can still feel the metal bite of the coat rail against his palm, the white-knuckled grip on it, the tangle of gasps and moans caught in his throat as Malfoy sucked him ruthlessly.
“Oh—fuck, Draco, fuck that’s good—” Harry whimpered through gritted teeth, and Draco moved his finger, in and out, in and out, carefully, aware of Harry’s every breath. He had the sudden vision of Harry on the bed; on his back, opening up not for Draco’s forefinger but for his cock, tight and so impossibly hot around him. Draco moving over him, hard and slow, and he wanted that, too, he wanted that and everything else, and he couldn’t wait to ask Harry if he wanted it too.
Draco opened his mouth—this might not be the best place to discuss this, damn Gryffindors to the ends of Heaven—but Harry placed a reassuring hand on his leg. Draco looked down at Harry’s hand, calmly but possessively clamped around his knee, and prayed his blush wasn’t too visible.
Ernestina hands a steaming mug to Malfoy, and then another one to Harry. Malfoy walks around the table and takes a seat across from Harry.
“You were among the personalities suggested by our readers when we asked who best embodied the Second Wizarding War generation. Did you know that people look up to you like that? How do you feel about it?”
Harry pulls back as much as he can, head in the pillows. He only left the small bedside lamp on. In the warm, dim light, Malfoy’s eyes glow silver. He’s got something of his old smirk on his face, tempered by the flush of his pale cheeks, his pupils blown wide. Harry reaches up to touch his swollen lips.
“I have no obligation to show anything to anyone,” Harry told him, eyes blazing, a mulish tilt to his jaw. “I never have, and I never will. Especially if it means I have to let my words be distorted by someone like you!”
“You waits here, Mistor Potter,” she says, in a tone that makes it clear the favour she’s doing him isn’t for her benefit. “Ernestina is letting Mistor Draco know.”
“Oh, you should see Arthur whenever I bring it to their house,” she says. “It’s the height of technology, honestly.”
After his initial meeting with Ron and Kingsley, the DMLE gave Harry all the documentation they had in relation to Malfoy’s case. Four boxes full of folders; thousands of pages of information on Harry’s former nemesis.
“Well, maybe the Chosen One can afford to bumble about as though his decisions have no consequences,” Draco commented curtly. “I, on the contrary, am almost all out of options. I am a Marked ex-Death Eater, after all. I don’t expect recruiters to fall over themselves to hire me. When I send my application for a job, there shall be no Harry Potter pleading for me to convince my prospective employers.”
“Excellent. That brings me to my point.” Potter’s eyes had a mischievous glimmer in them. Draco’s mouth twitched in a smile. “A friendly game of Seekers? In the Quidditch pitch? To settle which one of us is the best, once and for all?”
Harry doesn’t think it should surprise him, the fact that Malfoy broke one of his promises, and kept the other. He doesn’t think it should
you.” He seemed to reconsider his words, and cast a wary glance at Harry. “Forget I said anything. It’s just a stupid theory, anyway.”
“Actually, no.” It’s Hermione’s turn to look slightly guilty, and Harry’s intrigued. “It does concern Draco Malfoy, but not exactly in the way that you think.”
Harry does. His heart is overflowing, full to bursting, and he pours everything he feels into the kiss. Draco whimpers softly, pulls Harry closer, pulls him on top of him.
The marble corridors outside echo with the laughter and conversations of the night. Tonight is just one fundraising event in an endless string of fundraising events, galas, and charity balls that the Wizarding World insists on throwing at Harry, and that he never has the heart to refuse. What else can the Savior of the Wizarding World, an Auror academy drop-out sitting on a pile of money he couldn’t spend in a lifetime if he tried, do with his free time?
“—and you weren’t even out yet,” Blaise had said. “Now, as a proud bisexual, your choices are endless!”
“Hermione, it’s going to be fine,” Harry told her around a mouthful of scrambled eggs. He gave Draco a small smile from across the table. “I think that together, Draco and I are clever enough to fill out an order form from Waterstones
Hermione considers him with lifted eyebrows that tell him the conversation isn’t over. “Then you’re clearly not doing your bit, Harry. I’m starting to think you don’t want to meet anyone.”
“Ella DiCara,” he says, for the solicitor part. He thinks about the one firecall he’s allowed to make. Thinks of Harry, alone with Scorpius and Balzac in the big townhouse. Thinks of the fireplace in his study, the way Smith put it out with a careless Aguamenti when he barged into the room.
“We’re not the same size, Draco,” Harry says. Something in his tone rankles. It’s soft, placating, like he’s talking to an unreasonable, unstable child. Draco wants to wipe that sanctimonious expression from Harry’s face.
Nerves spiked Draco’s belly, but he set his face to ‘casual indifference’ and held out his hands, only trembling slightly. Harry transferred Tamara to him, the little creature squirming mid air until she was safely in his grip. He was surprised how warm she was to the touch.
“Draco…” Harry breathes, pressing his forehead against Draco’s, and Draco pulls him in and kisses him more.
He smirks, and the girls burst into another round of delighted giggles. He gestures for them to come closer. “Gather ‘round and watch, my charm-challenged, flirt-incompetent friends. Welcome to Draco Malfoy’s Stupendous Seduction Seminar. This is something you can practice safely at home, in the office, at the pub. It can look absolutely innocuous or ragingly seductive depending on how interested the targeted party is. That way, if the trick fails, the object of your lust is none the wiser and you haven’t made fools of yourself. But if it works…” He realises his colleagues have actually all stood and gathered around him, and he waggles his eyebrows to stress his point.
Peering through the open door, they took in the quiet Library; the rows and rows of books, and a free table that seemed to be waiting for Harry and Draco. Harry pointed at it. With a playful little smile, he winked at Draco.
“I’m fine. I’m fine. Just tired. You know what these events are like.” Ron had looked like he didn’t, but hadn’t challenged Harry on that. “A nice walk and some fresh air and I’ll be ready for bed.”
“Well?” Harry asked him. He looked almost shy. “Besides learning a newsworthy piece of information—and I’m not talking about my sexual preferences—” he smiled, and Draco squirmed on the sofa, “what did you think of the song?”
He wants to push him, yell at him — and he also wants to throw himself at Harry and kiss him. Kiss his face, his lips, until Harry’s hidden motives melt in the background. Instead, he gives in to the childish urge to shove him, and they end up teasing, laughing together — hands on each other — like they never did when they were teenagers.
“And you needn’t worry,” Harry said as he scooped her up in his arms and she began to claw at his red jumper. “Tamara is a miniature dragon, a new breed. She won’t grow any bigger than a kneazle.”
“You could take this off,” Harry suggests, but doesn’t push. Draco shivers and nods, never taking his eyes off Harry’s. And then in all his glorious nakedness, Harry kneels between Draco’s legs.
is he thinking about sex right now, anyway? Not sex, exactly. Girls. Girls and the fact that he hasn’t had one in over a year, and he doesn’t even miss it. He doesn’t miss not having a girlfriend. He doesn’t even miss not snogging girls. But… but it’s weird. He misses sex, he thinks. Yes, he does. He misses being close to someone that way. The before, and the after, and not just what’s in between. He misses having someone who cares about him enough to make him feel good, and take pleasure in Harry in turn. Not that… not that it’s really been his experience of sex, so far. There had been little give-and-take, little generosity in it. His nightly romps with past girlfriends felt utilitarian and cold, somehow. They’d felt good, very briefly, but afterwards Harry was left feeling empty, dirty, used. Harry can’t wrap his head around that particular paradox of his: that he wants to be with someone, and yet isn’t actively seeking companionship, isn’t drawn to any of the girls he’s met. Not since Ginny. Maybe, if he’s entirely honest, not even since before her.
Harry’s smile was dazzling, the sun was setting over Hogwarts, the crisp night air smelled of fir trees, firewood and freshly fallen snow. In this moment, it was so easy to forget everything about his true nature. Harry called out for him, his friends playfully shoved him, and Draco walked across the pitch to join him.
“Going for a run,” Draco tells her, not stopping on his way upstairs. Harry’s on his heels, probably giving Balzac and Ernestina one of his charming, apologetic smiles. Seducing his way into Draco’s entire household. Worming his way into everyone’s hearts.
“Doesn't tell me which class you're studying this for—oh.” Harry's expression turned teasing at once. “Have you been researching for our career choice assignment?”
“Ernestina Apparated home before I left the Ministry,” Draco says. Harry lifts his eyebrows. “She was… not in a good state. She must have gone straight to her rooms… she must have thought going to see Scorpius would only upset him more.”
Instead of replying right away, Harry took the cup of hot chocolate Slughorn had left for each of his students and took a sip, the warm liquid fogging his glasses. When he set it on the table again, he licked the milk foam lingering on his upper lip. Draco watched him, entranced, frozen, waiting.
“Don’t be an arse. Have you only come here to remind me of my lack of worth—both professional and personal?”
“Yeah… I’m sorry it has to be this way. I wish—” Harry sits with his back against the sofa and sighs. He reaches for Draco’s hand, and Draco twines their fingers together. They let them slide slowly, back and forth. The study is warm and dark and intimate, and Draco wishes… wishes this could be the whole truth. Nothing between them but this feeling of kinship and overflowing want. Nothing preventing Draco from letting himself fall in love with Harry, fully and irrevocably.
Before Harry can speak, Ernestina bows again, then turns on her heel and disappears through the door on his right. Dumbstruck, he shakes his head at the dog sitting at his feet. “Later, mate,” he says with a shrug, then follows the house-elf along a corridor lined with windows overlooking the street on his right hand. Her head pops around the corner of the first door on the left. “Over here, Mistor,” she says.
“No!” their friends laughed, raining snowballs on them. Finnigan and Thomas kept snogging, Thomas only letting go of Finnigan’s face to flip the others two fingers.
Harry’s not prepared for how adorable he finds the sight of a disheveled, wary, and oddly vulnerable Draco Malfoy eating curry in his kitchen.
Harry staggers back, and all the words leave him. All the fight. He stares at Draco, and Draco stares back, chest rising and falling, the glimmering lights of the London night highlighting the dramatic planes of his face. Harry wants to hurt him — the way Draco can’t seem to stop hurting him, by holding back, by keeping his feelings so close to his chest, when Harry’s love for him only wants to spill and spill.
“You know how recently,” Harry says. He takes a step forward. The kitchen’s not that big; Malfoy’s not that far. Harry moves into Malfoy’s personal space, heart speeding up in his chest. Malfoy drops his gaze to the rim of Harry’s collar. Harry inches closer. “I’m starting to think I like… blokes.”
Around the long family table, plates and platters of food passed from hand to hand, followed by gravy boats that floated precariously a few inches above the guests. Draco couldn’t help but notice the vacant seat between George Weasley and Penelope Clearwater, Percy Weasley’s fiancée. Out of the corner of his eye, he could feel Mrs Weasley’s absent gaze constantly drawn to the empty space where her son should have been. He could see Mr Weasley covering her hand with his and squeezing.
Ernestina has been thrown to the ground as well, whether by the force of the explosion or by her own presence of mind, Harry can’t tell. Scorpius doesn’t seem physically hurt. He’s completely quiet now, though, his eyes wide and unresponsive, and Harry’s scared, scared and helpless—
“Yeah,” Lavender Brown says from behind the mounting pile of forms, “makes you the only human in Britain.”
Not looking at either Ron or Kingsley, he carefully turns the page. The next few ones are newspaper clippings—from
Well. Just speaking from experience, here. I hate to generalise, but I haven’t met many straight men who spend the amount of time and care you obviously put into your grooming (I am not complaining, mind you)
Penelope took in all those kids, and then she made them find magical objects that had been lost — one-eyed teddy bears, handkerchiefs still holding their late grandmother’s perfume like a memory locked in a Pensieve, cracked Remembralls, taxidermied Egyptian cacti — and trained them to find the owners of those little treasures all over again.
Harry’d thought bitterly. He’d knelt near Scorpius, Balzac whining quietly on Scorpius’ other side, and checked his vitals as a precaution. He might not have to go to the hospital this time…
“Ha, ha, Potter. I never noticed how hilarious you are.” Draco drops his arm and turns to face Harry. The cupboard feels like a padded alcove, and Harry can hear the puffs of breath every time Draco exhales. “I can’t recall the bloody things’ proper name, all right? So now I’m opening every box in this storage room until I find them.”
“Well, you ran away from me every time. You wanted to leave as soon as we were alone when I found you outside tonight. That’s what I call mixed signals, at the very least.”
“Harry,” Kingsley interrupts with his deep, steady voice, “if Malfoy is involved in laundering Death Eater money or drug dealing on a massive scale, then
If he had a choice what to be in his next life, he’d ask for an assignment in Antarctica, scaring off penguins.
Malfoy moved with each of Harry’s thrusts, until he stood nearly bent over, hands pushing against the wall, arse pushing against Harry’s cock, shirt scrunched up to reveal the pale skin of his lower back. His head hung between his outstretched arms, and Harry had the sudden vision of what Malfoy was seeing. His heavy cock bouncing as Harry rammed into him, Harry’s balls as his flesh slapped against Malfoy’s arse… The image made his legs tremble.
He leans over the desk and grabs the legal documents he was about to sign. The permit for the building of Caduceus’ Romanian factory. He notices the rolls of parchment strewn around his desk. Odd. He doesn’t remember them falling down before going to find the quill. With a perplexed frown, he Summons the parchments into a tidy pile again.
“Definitely. So many magical species were on the brink of extinction—the ones Voldemort and his followers didn’t deem useful or important enough, at least. The public didn’t know about that. Or maybe they didn’t think it was a priority.” She looked down at her hands, clasped in her lap. She smiled ruefully. “It’s funny, isn’t it? How people like to prioritise good causes by order of...
Sorry I haven't replied to all of them yet, it's been a hectic week real life-wise and  I haven't found the time to properly answer them. Things should slow down this weekend and I'm looking forward to replying to you all <333
Draco gaped. “Luna...we might have gone through the same things at the same time, but...we were quite literally on opposing sides of the war. The public views our experiences as vastly different; I hope you can understand that. And they certainly do not want to hear my version of those events.”
Also, I seem to remember you spent an awful lot of time in very tight leggings on stage. I have a suspicion the costume designers who came up with Frederic’s outfit knew exactly what they were doing, because it’s quite unfair. You… you look like you were born to wear those things. The way they highlight your body, the way you move in them, so seamlessly, like water on a window pane.
Luna took a moment to consider him. “We are the same age, Draco,” she said thoughtfully after a while. “We’re the same generation. We went through the same events, at the same time. It’s funny that they would think that about me, but not about you, don’t you think?”
There’s a bit of a shuffle as Malfoy rolls away and onto his stomach, grabbing his wand from the floor where it fell with his clothes. Harry’s eyes travel from the mussed blond hair to the strong, naked back, the jut of those shoulder blades, the swell of that delicious arse, the long, muscled legs. God, it’s like every single fantasy he’s had for the past ten years is coming to life, and Draco Malfoy, somehow, wants to fulfil them all.
“Yes. This is going to be a written interview. While I’ll do my best to stick as closely as possible to your words, there can still be room for interpretation. I can still misunderstand things that you’re going to tell me. Or I can write them in a way that you feel doesn’t reflect your original meaning. By signing this, you basically consent, as part of the journalistic process, to having your words written down or interpreted in a way that you might find inaccurate.” Merlin, that part of the disclaimer always made him sound like a bloody solicitor. He rubbed the side of his jaw, embarrassed. “The author of the articles, or the newspaper company itself, cannot be held liable if you disagree with parts of the article when it comes out. Should you find yourself unhappy with the outcome of the interview, you can of course contact the newspaper about it. An erratum can be added to the next issue.”
“I haven’t seen him come out since lunch…” Jemima’s golden earrings clink when she turns to check the security camera screens behind her desk. “... but it doesn’t look like he’s in there, either.”
There are rumours at the Ministry. Lucius Malfoy chased his own son out of their home, people say. Found in a compromising position. Mother visits him in secret when father is traveling.
“I can do it,” Harry said, spearing him with his resolute green eyes. Then, with an almost playful inflection: “Can you?”
he was? Images of the skating rink flashed through Draco’s mind: Harry laughing happily, surrounded by his friends, Draco watching them with helpless envy as he sat alone.
Sometimes I wish she had. It would clarify the definition of what constitutes ‘hurting you’. Get the words out there. Now, I live in constant fear of upsetting you and finding myself in the trajectory of her mean right hook.
His colleagues start practicing. There’s a lot of giggling and cursing going on as Draco walks past the bent forms of Lavender, Parvati, Matilda, Hannah, and Gabrielle. He catches Penelope’s eyes across the office and smiles at her half-annoyed, half-affectionate expression.
Draco rushed up the path leading to the Hogwarts gates, his breath coming out in small white clouds. It was 4 o’clock; the sun would be setting soon. It had already started its descend towards the horizon, the cold white light of the winter day slowly fading to yellow, then orange, pink, night. Looking up, he could see the half-collapsed silhouette of the Astronomy Tower cutting a dark shape against the golden sky.
PS: you know what the others are going to do tonight, if we’re not at the pub? They’ll probably start a betting pool on whether or not we’re somewhere shagging.
“We… we just talk a lot, you know? And spend so much time together… It makes it harder not to see all the good things about someone. Until he found out the truth about me, of course.”
“Oi!” Ginny Weasley closed the distance with the struggling animal and started throwing hexes at the birds. One of them hit Scylla: in a burst of sparkles and stars, she turned into a white dove.
in the next room was as bright as Harry had left it, but it barely reached the showers. Even in the near-darkness, though, Harry could make out the half-smile on Malfoy’s face, so unlike the smirk that had been a staple of Harry’s Hogwarts years.
More silence, and Hermione’s hand comes to pat Harry on the knee. “Harry… Between this and what you told us before… Does it affect your ability to carry out your mission? Because if it does, you should probably let Kingsl—”
“Hello, Mistor Potter, sir,” she says with a light foreign accent that vaguely rings a bell, her r’s rolling and her vowels flowing. “Thank you for coming. Ernestina is bringing Mistor Potter to the waiting room, sir.”
Balzac jumps down the bed, looks at me and wags his tail. Waiting. I jump down too. Piled rug under my feet, shaggy. I put my slippers on, then my green dressing gown (thick, warm, like the blankets in my bed). Garlands of tiny light bulbs hanging from the ceiling. Fairy lights, though there aren’t really fairies. Turned off. I think about the lights, their flickering colours. I reach out to them — my magic does. And the lights go on. Too bright. Dimmer, please. They dim. (They listen to me.) Nestine and I put them up ten days ago.
Luna tore her gaze away from the hypnotic spin of the Prothimioscope and blinked. “Oh. I thought the newspaper contacted me because of my work. And Neville’s job. They’re much more interesting than the war, really.”
It’s important that Daddy sleeps in and that Harry does as well. (So I send my magic to tell the motion-sensing charms to stay quiet.) (They listen.)
“Yes,” Harry smiles at Malfoy’s bewildered air. “Hermione had bought me a couple of extra clocks. She thought that would solve my problem.”
Malfoy swallows, his Adam’s apple rising and falling along his long, pale neck. “How recently?” he asks. His voice comes out soft and strained.
McGonagall lifted her hand. “Mister Malfoy, thank you for explaining your reasoning to me. I meant no criticism when I spoke about your research process. In fact, I appreciate your impressive maturity, not only in the way you took this task on, but in the way you calmly defended your ideas. Where some of your classmates might have spontaneously chosen to pick a career book, you chose to start with the main subject matter: yourselves.” She steepled her fingers over the desk and smiled. “I have no doubt that whatever you decide to do after Hogwarts will be meticulously considered.”
“You know my only goal in life is to ruin your plans,” Draco shrugged with feigned nonchalance. “Although I agree it’s a shame that you came here today of all days, what with the nice wide-open schedule you must have.”
Narcissa stands and waves gracefully goodbye after taking a miniscule bite of cake and drinking verbena tea from a dainty golden teacup.
Hermione Granger’s impossibly sharp dark eyes lifted up to meet his, half-obscured by a mane of bushy brown hair.
Why he’d fallen so easily into Malfoy’s open arms — metaphorically speaking — is too big a question.
“I…” Draco blinked, then gave himself a shake. “Yes, that was all. I thought it was a rather full day—”
“Sure,” Malfoy chuckles. “Let’s call it… exploration, then. Would you like me to suck you off again? Would you like to suck
Draco had been less talkative with Hermione. He’d given her the big picture — arrested by the Aurors, Hermione’s lawyer friend sitting with him during the interrogation, the slight change of plans in the face of unexpected events — but hadn’t got into details. He couldn’t say it. He couldn’t talk about Ernestina’s bruised face, about Balzac lying in an unconscious heap on the floor, about Scorpius’ screams, about Harry’s desperate eyes and his last second Protego that had shielded Draco’s son from further harm once again. Not with the DMLE as his witnesses.
Their little group had gathered in the living room after dinner with cups of spiced mulled wine. His mother and Andromeda had taken the loveseat in front of the fire. Teddy had climbed on Draco’s lap and had promptly fallen asleep, much to Draco’s helpless astonishment.
When Harry turns, Ernestina is staring at him with large, unblinking eyes. She shakes her head ever so slightly.
“What is?” Harry’s not sure why he’s keeping his voice down. A heavy hush falls over the room. The ticking of the grandfather clock is the only sound to disturb it.
The actual sight of it does nothing to alleviate the feeling. Almost shy, he steps into the sunlit room, eyeing the beautiful four-poster bed that wouldn’t look out of place in their Hogwarts dormitories, if only for the size of it. With what he guesses are king-sized dimensions, Malfoy’s bed is a far cry from the single beds all of them had in school.
Harry pulled back and gazed into Draco’s eyes, joyful and intimate. “You know...it could be just as unforgettable the other way around.” He laughed at Draco’s perplexed frown. “Listen...I have an idea.”
Draco had always loved Quidditch. It was the perfect combination of challenge, strategy and aggression—all things Draco used to excel at, to thrive on. It was also the closest he could come to flying in public without raising suspicion as to his real nature.
“It’s not a bad start, is it? But here’s why, really.” Harry folds his hands in his lap and leans forward, looking into Malfoy’s eyes. “I might be the only person you can trust with your personal security. All the other applicants — you don’t know them, do you? I know the majority of the wizarding community is still distrustful of you, which I deplore, believe me. But the fact of the matter is, you can’t know for sure that someone you hire won’t have bad intentions. Except for the man who could have been your downfall when he had the opportunity, and wasn’t.” He points a finger to his face and adds: “I’m talking about me, by the way.”
A ball of light, blue and blindingly bright, burst from the tip and fell in the dark. It reverberated on worn, humid stone stairs before disappearing long seconds later.
Malfoy’s face is inscrutable. “I must say, of all the applications I expected to receive when I asked Jemima to publish this job listing, Harry Potter’s was possibly the last one I would have thought of.” He lifts his cool grey eyes to Harry’s. “I shall ask this only once, because I need to make sure, for my own peace of mind.” He drops the parchment on the desk. “What the actual
When Harry didn’t respond, Draco walked around the couch, looking at him curiously. When Draco came across his line of vision, Harry jumped. He wore strange white contraptions in his ears, linked by a cord to a flat round machine, and he pulled them out hurriedly, flushing a little. The little contraptions fell to his lap.
Someone yells, and Harry isn’t sure if it was him or Draco, but he shoves Scorpius to the ground and rolls down alongside him, blindly casting a
Granger’s face lit up. “Of course! Harry told me you had started working on it.” She looked at him appraisingly. “Looking into Muggle careers as well as Wizarding ones is very clever.”
I’m sorry we left you out of the betting game, babes. You see, you weren’t at the pub the night it was launched (your dear lab mate, Zacharias Smith, was, though. Perhaps you should blame him, he who hasn’t even the common decency to let his colleagues know he’s leaving for the pub).
Went into law enforcement right after school (like my best friend. Like the people I'd admired when I was a teenager. Like what I thought was the right thing to do)
“I'm sorry,” Harry’s voice came from nearer than Draco expected. He had scooted across the sofa, closer to him. “I was just trying to make a joke. It was insensitive of me. I apologise.”
Christmas always falls on the same day. December 25th. Every year. I'm not sure I like it. Like birthdays. The kind of day that makes other people happy. A break in the routine, though. Loud. Sounds, smells, songs. Unusual. If I run my piano practice in my head I can tune most of it out.
Because Scorpius is crying out — a long, loud, uninterrupted sound, like an animal in pain — and the shelves are starting to shake. Everyone in the room has frozen in mute dread — and the little boy keeps crying, crying, crying, as the books and records on the shelves rattle ominously, as the lid of the grand piano bangs open, as the keys start to play all together, a discordant cacophony that barely covers Scorpius’s scream. Then the keys lift off the piano like a wave—
“Let me— let me show you,” he mumbles in Draco's hair. Draco arches into him with a whimper. Harry's hands are soft on his sides, his lips tender against the shell of his ear. Draco can feel his reverence. He understands the way Harry wishes they'd do it this time: slow, looking into Draco's eyes and stroking his hair as he comes. Like they've got all the time in the world.
; and a few photographers from less reputable publications — some of which would delight in catching Harry disgrace himself tonight, one way or another. They’ve never bothered with respecting his private life in the past, have they?
He put his hands on Harry’s shoulders and pushed him back lightly. Harry blinked at him in the semi-darkness of the room, as if brought back from a dream. His lips were wet and swollen. Draco wanted to scream with how much he wanted him.
“But you’re going to have to help me out a bit.” At that, Draco takes a step back, a deep frown on his face. His hand is still on Harry, fingers clenched around the handful of fabric. Harry exhales a steadying breath and continues. “You’re going to have to tell me what you’re hiding from the Ministry.”
Draco moaned around his cock and lifted his free hand to cup Harry’s balls. He experimentally rolled them around his palm, slowly, one after the other. He listened intently to the sounds Harry made, waiting for a sign that he should stop. When such a sign never came, he closed his fingers around the sac and felt it tighten against his palm. He remembered what Harry had done the last time they’d had sex at Hogwarts—his slicked forefinger rubbing circles around Draco’s rim, pushing into Draco’s hole. How heavenly it had felt. He decided to take a risk. Not even realising the bobbing rhythm of his mouth over Harry’s cock had slowed, he let his fingers trail up past Harry’s balls, along his lightly haired arse cheeks, slipping lightly into his crease. Harry’s breath stuttered and hitched. The head of Harry’s cock still pressed against the inside of his cheek, Draco concentrated. If he tried hard enough—if he could cast a wordless lubrication spell—
“Okay… You do know Ron is the Auror in charge of the Caduceus investigation, do you? You’re taking advantage of this.”
“Please,” Harry breathes. “I’m not ready to come out. I don’t even know what I’m going to come out as. It doesn’t… it doesn’t mean I don’t want you.” Malfoy swallows, and Harry reaches up, brushing the side of his neck with tender fingers. Malfoy closes his eyes as if he’s in pain. “Please. God, Malfoy. It’s ridiculous, how much I want you. You’ve got to know— this is the beginning for me. Not the end.”
“Okay,” Harry nods. He remembers Zacharias Smith’s reports in the boxes of evidence the Auror team gave him to read. Smith was a pompous prick when they were all in Hogwarts. If he’s still half as annoying as he was at sixteen, Harry won’t have any problem playing the part of the unimpressed bodyguard.
It’s been three weeks, and Harry still gets distracted by hot flashes of memories. Malfoy sinking to his knees. Malfoy’s lips stretched around the girth of Harry’s cock. His vibrating moans as Harry fucked his mouth. The mounting, overwhelming, mind-blowing pleasure that had blotted out the world around Harry.
“Yes.” Draco adjusts his jacket lapels with deliberate meticulousness. His mind is reeling, rifling through images of supply cupboards filled with half-open boxes, fallen rolls of parchment, Harry’s eyes soft on him, then wide and shocked as they take in the Mark on his arm. The hurt, the shame, and the comfort of Harry’s proffered friendship. Harry’s terrible, earth-shattering confession in a dim hospital room, just when Draco was starting to let himself
“We spent years living in a castle where every other step was trapped and every other door lead to secret passageways. Can you blame me?”
“I was just—” Harry had gestured to the rows of coats, had finished lamely“—leaving.” His voice had come out scratchy, his breath too hard and fast.
Malfoy lifts an eyebrow at Harry's barb. “Touché. Clearly all I do around the rich and famous these days is steal from them.” Malfoy’s eyes drop to Harry’s crotch. Harry swallows hard. “And suck their dicks on occasion.”
“You should know… this isn’t just an opportunistic fuck,” Malfoy said quietly, as if there was a chance Harry wouldn’t hear him. “Not for me, at least.”
Draco clenched his fists in frustration. “Why did you?” He rose to his full height. “Don’t you see? This isn’t about
“That’s not what it is.” Malfoy’s eyes are fixed on him, equally predator and prey. “Why are you so cross? I didn’t steal anything from you.”
Although Draco looks exactly like he would bite Harry’s head off if he went too far with the personal questions, Harry feels like he’s been issued a challenge.
people skills ratings. I don’t want to make assumptions about me, but Harry’s is quite high according to this test.” He pointed at
Harry throws himself in his path. “No! Draco, no. Please — just listen. You have to trust me. I made a promise. I’ll never deliberately hurt you again. Tell me you’ve heard this. Tell me you understand.”
He folded his wings around him so briskly he scared Jeff the Niffler. With a squawk, the creature jumped out of his pocket and ran to hide in the dark undergrowth at the foot of the red oak tree. After a visible attempt to calm himself, Mephistopheles lifted his hands. “Fine.
Harry’s here, still kneeling, patient and waiting, and he’s just… Harry. His body is warm between Draco’s legs, his skin inviting in the dim light of the study. His face is bathed in the glow of the lamp on Draco’s desk and he looks younger, artless, and somehow that’s what crumbles Draco’s last walls. They’re the same, he and Harry. Despite everything — despite life taking them in opposite directions then bringing them back together in the most improbable way — they match, inevitable. Draco holds Harry’s gaze, focusses on the feel of Harry’s hands sliding up and down his sides, soothing him, grounding him. Harry touches him, an awed expression on his face, as if he can’t quite believe it’s happening. A mirror to Draco’s feelings. He touches him like every one of his scars is beautiful, sensitive, erotic. He should know — he’s the one who put them on Draco’s body. Marked him as his. With a soft whine, Draco reaches for Harry’s face, pulls him close, kisses him. Harry melts into the kiss, melts against him with a soft, encouraging moan. And just like that, with the slide of Harry’s hands on the fabric of his shirt, on the flies of his trousers, with their hands desperately grabbing at one another, with their tongues sliding hot and hungry together…
She let go of Luna’s hand and ran forward. In the distance, Draco saw them: starkly black against the white backdrop of the snow-covered Hogwarts grounds, there were two ravens chasing and pecking cruelly at a tiny creature that looked suspiciously like—
“I never implied they weren’t,” Harry tells him steadily. “But I’m still glad I asked. I think it’s relevant information for the job.”
“That’s what I thought,” Draco smirked. “Come on, Potter, don’t stand there gaping like a Flobberworm. It’s really not very attractive, and I might reconsider. We wouldn’t want that, would we?”
That day, Malfoy was dressed all in black. Nothing new, that. But not traditional wizarding robes like he used to wear at Hogwarts. Fuck, no. The opposite of that. He was wearing the tightest shirt, right sleeve rolled up to his elbow; the skinniest jeans, hugging his… his
“Oh, yeah, definitely prime personality test quality, Draco.” Harry looked at him skeptically. “Remind me again, what are we supposed to be doing? Making an important decision for our futures, or filling out a
yes sir, it was a trap, that’s what it was. Even when he’d told Malfoy about that little fantasy of his, he hadn’t expected Malfoy to, er,
Draco falls into step with Harry when Scorpius breaks into a run to go see the ducks, followed by Balzac limping by his side. They walk to the pond in companionable silence.
“Don’t!” Jeff lifted his paws in supplication. “You’re right, he doesn’t know I’m here. I just... wanted to take a look at this 13th century marvel of a ring, that’s all. What Mephisto doesn’t know can’t hurt me, I mean
“My apologies. I was joking. I shouldn’t even be here. I assure you, this floor is yours. No one shall disturb you when you’re here.” Malfoy meets Harry’s eyes again. “I just wanted to check that you’re… settling in okay.”
“Oh, this and that. Served my sentence after the war, got myself an entry-level clerk job at Gringotts, got married, climbed the corporate ladder, got promoted to director of the Asset Management branch, got divorced. I think that’s my last ten years in a nutshell.” Draco waved at a passing waiter, grabbed a fresh glass of champagne from his tray, and took a long sip before he noticed Potter staring at him insistently. “Yes?”
He heard the flapping of wings and the rustle of leaves over his head, and a familiar voice called overhead, “Hello, Draco.”
Draco froze when he looked down at what Harry was pointing at. Jeff was wearing something indeed. A large emerald-and-Goblin-silver ring, its former engraved ‘M’ polished away, was dangling from his neck by a red ribbon—one of the ribbons that the Eighth Years had tied and used to hang baubles on the Christmas tree. Caught, the Niffler grimaced apologetically at Draco.
They lie like this for a while, their sweat and the mess between them cooling in the darkened study. Harry lifts his head slightly, nudges Draco’s nose with his. It’s soft and intimate, and Draco’s heart swells in his chest, painful. He just had sex with Harry Potter. He just had sex with Harry. They just had sex and it was slow and heated and nearly delirious and already more perfect than Draco remembers sex to ever have been.
“Hello, love. How’s the interview going? Is Malfoy being nice?” Longbottom took the proffered cup of tea from Luna’s hands and kissed the top of her head. Draco felt an odd pang of fondness and sadness at the casual display. Standing in the kitchen’s threshold, Harry wore a similarly wistful expression.
“I’ve never told anyone outside the people who started it…” Draco shakes his head minutely. “I can’t drag Ernestina down with my own problems. It’s not her fault the Ministry decided my fortune was suspicious…”
Turning his back on the castle, he took a step, then another. Draco wasn’t worried about leaving a trace: his footsteps in the fresh snow melted away as he took the next step. Behind him, he was leaving nothing but untouched whiteness.
Malfoy’s back tenses. Then slowly, he turns to look at Harry over his shoulder. His face is half in shadows, but the sight of his sharp face highlighted in the glow of the streetlamps outside hits Harry like a fist to the heart.
Harry's brought back weeks ago when he’d been faced with another one of Draco’s scars, when he had dismissed Draco’s explanation — Draco’s apology — about the Dark Mark with a benevolent wave of his hand… God, he’d really been an arse. Draco deserved better. Draco deserves better. He deserves someone who’ll listen. Who will know when Draco needs to lay out his guilt, when he needs to let himself hurt for it, without being told his guilt and hurt are not important enough to dwell on. And he deserves someone who, in turn, will take Draco’s scars face on, and not run away as if burned… as if Draco was the freak, and not Harry, for putting those scars on Draco’s body in the first place.
Draco lets out a frustrated growl. “Will you stop — being so bloody Gryffindor about everything?” he asks through gritted teeth.
of snow unlike anything Harry had ever experienced, even in the coldest months of his Hogwarts years. He felt a hand close around his shoulder and Malfoy pushed him inside, slamming the door shut behind them.
“Hold on,” Hermione lifts a finger at him. “Harry, before I give any of my hard-earned money to my dear husband, can you please confirm what's going on between you and Malfoy?”
Draco looked up, his curiosity piqued in spite of himself. The bosses had let him live his lives without too much supervision lately, save for his annual meetings with his tutor. Mephistopheles saw the change in him and grinned. Ugly, yellow, crooked teeth flashed in the dark.
contacted me for the interview. I thought it was because of my work as a Magizoologist. It’s a line of work I would have fallen into no matter what, but the war just consolidated my aspirations. Voldemort’s despicable speciest ideology left so many creatures on the brink of extinction. So many natural habitats were destroyed in Britain. This is how I dealt with the aftermath of the war, Draco. I saw an opportunity to be useful before it was too late. I wanted to avoid ever having to say in the future, ‘Gather ‘round, little ones, and let me tell you how I grew up at a time when centaurs and dinosaurs were still populating the forests of the world.’”
Christmas day at the Weasley’s house was exactly as Draco expected: utter chaos. The dining room was a sea of red-haired, freckled people and multicoloured homemade Christmas jumpers, the living room was a cacophonous mess of small children playing Exploding Snap, and the kitchen was filled with teetering piles of dishes and gently floating plates overflowing with roast potatoes, mash, peas and carrots.
“Goodbye, Draco,” Greg says, and leaning forward with surprising agility for someone his size, he envelops Draco into a rib-cracking hug. Draco smiles against Greg’s shirt and pats his back. Then Greg lets him go, slightly awkward after this rare display of affection, and Draco laughs. He snaps his fingers and his house-elf, Ernestina, appears with a pop.
Harry gives a fond, long-suffering sigh, and sits down in front of the hearth. “No one can reproach you for not getting to the point,” he says. Hermione has a talent for jumping right in, all business. “So, the Society for the Protection of Acromantula and Magical Tarantulas. SPAT, right? Tell me again why I should care about giant spiders who tried to murder me when I was a kid?”
Draco stopped and looked over his shoulder. No one was following him. Night was setting over the Hogwarts castle. From where he was standing, on the threshold of the Forbidden Forest, it shone like a lodestar, nestled among the snow-capped fir trees.
“Yep. Hagrid said the MacFusty clan in the Hebrides are breeding them. A hybrid of a Welsh Green and Swedish Short-snout. I don’t know how they did the miniaturising, though I imagine it took more than a
his lashes were, how much darker than the rest of his hair. How his eyes burned like embers despite their paleness, their unique shade of silver and ice. How smooth his skin looked, how Harry itched to run his knuckles along the sharp line of his jaw—
enough — more than most people in my profession do. I spent the best part of sixth year following your every move, after all.”
Harry nods, too, moved by the tale of the elf’s loyalty and Malfoy’s perceptiveness. He clears his throat, a thousand pressing questions in his mind.
And warmer, it was. Almost suffocatingly so, after the prickling cold of the outside. The air was heavy with the smell of sunlight, a misty kind of humidity, as well as something earthy that Draco couldn’t place. It was a scent that he associated more with his mother’s rose garden than with the inside of a house. Flecks of dust danced in the rays of sunshine pouring from the skylights of the foyer and the massive floor-to-ceiling bow windows at the back of the living room. Draco stopped in his tracks, his hands pausing on the knot of his scarf. The perfect curve of the windows, almost sixteen feet high, was too much of a feat of engineering to be entirely Muggle.
Harry folded himself over Malfoy’s back and closed his fist around Malfoy’s cock, hot and impossibly hard. It wouldn’t take long to make him spill, and maybe it was a good thing because Harry wasn’t sure he could hold on much longer, the squeeze of Malfoy’s arse like a vice around his cock. He started wanking Malfoy in time with his thrusts. God, how well did Malfoy’s cock fit into his palm. How perfect did Malfoy’s body feel, nested against his own. If he could do this all his life, he’d die a happy man. And on this thought, Harry’s orgasm hit him. He came in Malfoy’s arse, his hips giving a few erratic jerks before pushing inside one last, exquisite time. Malfoy took over, moving, thrusting in Harry’s clenched fist, and seconds later his cock throbbed and he came with a guttural groan that made Harry’s prick give a hopeful twitch.
“Eh,” Draco shrugged. “I’ve been turned into a ferret before. Being a toad would definitely be an improvement, if you ask me.”
ask him about it, even if he tosses me out in a couple of days.” Perhaps something useful will come out of his bloody assignment on Draco’s case after all.
What had Malfoy been doing in the cloakroom that night? Yes, clearly, he’d picked pockets. But what for? Was it how rich kids got their kicks nowadays? (Not that Malfoy could be called a kid. He was the same age as Harry, after all. And he’d grown quite convincingly into his adult looks. He’d been all lean limbs and broad shoulders and strong jaw that night, miles away from the pointy roundness of his teenage years or the emaciated gauntness of his features at eighteen.)
“Bye, Draco! Bye, Harry!” Luna ran after Neville, who was already in the foyer, fastening his cloak. “Do wait for us, if you don’t mind! We can have supper together when we get back!”
And so it goes, for three endless weeks, during which Harry loses sleep and fears losing his mind. He wanks several times a day to memories of Malfoy’s lifted eyes, to memories of a hot, wet mouth, and it’s still not enough to calm Harry down.
Everything Pansy had just said was true. Draco could not believe he had been so obvious, all this time. She took his arm and squeezed.
Draco looked up at Harry and smiled shyly when he saw the look of love in his eyes. Harry did that sappy heart shape with his hands that always made Draco roll his eyes, but inwardly melt.
Harry lifts his hands to cup his face, brings their lips together, halfway between a kiss and a devouring hunger. He rocks his hips forward and his cock aligns with Draco’s, so desperately hard they both moan into each other’s mouth.
“Nothing. Everything. I don’t know anymore. Two days ago, I thought —” He exhales a frustrated laugh. “I thought it was going somewhere. Draco and I. I was… forgetting myself, clearly. Forgetting what my job was.” He meets Hermione’s gaze again and forces himself to hold it. “But it was all lies. And I was tired of it, Hermione. I could tell he knew something was off about me, so when he confronted me about it…”
“You like that.” He lets out a disbelieving laugh. “You like it when I tell you how good you're doing.”
“Oh, of course, Narcissa,” Andromeda concurred. Neither she nor his mother were fools. “For young men in the prime of life like these two...
“You don’t—you don’t know Muggles put a man on the moon?” Harry was fighting to regain his composure.
it to happen, so badly, so viscerally, that his mind had gone blank with need. He wonders what it means that Draco Malfoy was both the kindling and the match.
Draco wants to say, but he thinks of Potter’s eyes on his body a minute ago, the shocked look on his face, as if he’d been struck by some sort of invisible lightning — and the retort dies in his throat. He goes back to his notes for real this time. Rattled, confused, heart hammering in his temples, he’s fairly certain this won’t be the last he’s seen of Potter.
“Well. It’s an honest question. Some people are… uncomfortable. Knowing that.” He glances at Harry. “If you need support or help working with him — just ask. It can often be difficult to judge if you're engaging with him the right way when you’re… new to it.”
But now is not the time for this kind of reminiscence. Now is the time to focus on the present, or more accurately, on the future.
Draco doesn’t look at him — flinches, his features tense like he’s in pain — then swiftly gets on his feet.
Draco bent down and set the golden top on the floor. It started to spin faster with a faint buzzing sound. Amongst the luxurious vegetation, it could have easily been mistaken for a bumblebee foraging from flower to flower.
Thinks of Harry again, the way he’d looked at Draco from across the room, like his entire world was collapsing.
There was a variety of reactions when our relationship became public. I assume you expected that. However...did anything surprise you in the midst of the media turmoil? Anything you didn’t expect?
Draco’s heart sank. “Headmistress, this is not a thoughtless idea. I assumed it was just as valid to start the process by researching
The difficult part of the task was to last for a total time of four minutes, and she filibustered for SIX WHOLE MINUTES (Ron was more pissed about the time he lost on his lunch break than about losing the bet. Ask him. He whinged about it all evening yesterday).
As they step inside the foyer of Draco’s house, Harry notices it immediately: the faint burnt smell, the eerily unusual quiet. He stills, his senses on high alert. He waits for Balzac’s tell-tale limp, coming from the corridor to meet them. But the dog never comes, and Scorpius’ hand closes around Harry’s sleeve.
“So, Mr Potter,” continues Mr Peterson, unaware of Ron’s distress, “which breed of Acromantula do you have a soft spot for? You probably have a favourite, we all do!”
Ginny wrapped her arm around her girlfriend’s shoulders and kissed her cheek. “Do we really need another pet, Luna? Especially one that will go through our drawers for shiny new things every once in a while?”
Ron’s eyebrows disappear under his fringe, and even Hermione carefully drops the toys she's holding into the toy box before straightening up, gazing at Harry with that pointed, knowing look.
For a moment, Jeff looked as though pride was battling with greed inside his tiny head. Then, wringing his paws, he grimaced. “Yes! Yes, I do!”
“Wait here, please, Mistor Potter. Ernestina is letting Mistor Draco know Mistor Potter is arrived, sir.” And with a crack, she Disapparates.
“It's okay, honestly,” he shrugged, still smiling that crooked little smile as though he knew a secret Draco didn't. “It was mutual. We weren't really each other's type.”
Then his cock nestles against Malfoy’s arse, his cheeks parting around Harry as he rocks forward, and they both gasp in shock and pleasure.
As if she hadn’t just had Harry’s wand pointed at her a second ago, Narcissa holds herself straighter and nods with impressively polite dignity.
Draco didn’t know what to say. It wasn’t as if his opinion really mattered. Harry knew his friends better than Draco did, anyway.
Harry watches the scene for a moment, unsure if he should interrupt. Ask Malfoy if he needs him, or go back to his rooms. He feels the house-elf’s wary eyes on him, and he clears his throat.
“Mate, you just did it again,” Ron grins, shaking his head. “Since when do you call Malfoy ‘Draco’?”
Malfoy’s fingers still felt amazing inside his slightly sore hole, and Harry didn’t overthink it. Hoping to give Malfoy better access, to allow his fingers in deeper, he rolled on his stomach—and froze.
The thing about school reunions was that nobody in the history of humanity had looked forward to one, ever.
Harry shook his head, the incredulous laughter still on his lips. He strode up to Malfoy, took his face in his hands and kissed him. The same slow, purposeful kiss that he’d given him a minute before they’d fucked. This time, sated, happy—god, he was happy, wasn’t he?—Harry wanted to give their kiss a new meaning. One he hadn’t fleshed out in detail, but that he wanted to say
Sure enough, two small curls of smoke were rising from Draco’s green tartan slippers which were sitting by the fire.
“Okay, first of all, this is a case for the DMLE, not a mission for a private investigator,” he argues. His tone is rising but he can’t bring himself to care. “Second, do you even have a plan, or is it as basic as ‘go to Malfoy’s house and make friends with him and have him spill all his dirty secrets even though you haven’t seen him in a decade and last time you did, he hated you with a passion?’ Because it’s not exactly what I call airtight.”
“Think about the outcome, mate,” he says. “Think about the good it could do if Malfoy turns out to be the bastard we suspect he is. Plus, you get to stay in London for a while, and we get to work together on another case,” Ron adds more cheerfully, elbowing him lightly in the side.
for lack of a better adjective. It’s neat, lively, and house-elf-sized. There’s a small bed tucked in the corner, along the wall where a large window overlooks the garden. Red-and-white checkered curtains hang on either side of the window, matching the bed covers and the thick burgundy rug covering the floor almost entirely. On the other side of the room, there’s a bulky chest of drawers that Harry can tell is almost full to bursting, a squashy armchair, and a small coffee table stained with old condensation rings.
“Oooh,” Luna said, bending over and grabbing the Niffler by his armpits. “You are so pretty. What have you got here?” She squinted at the ring from behind her goggles. “Oh, I have seen this before...”
Harry pushed open the door to their Hogsmeade cottage and scanned around. Draco followed suit, looking around the living room suspiciously, eyes still narrow slits.
Draco and Luna went back to the sunroom. The sun was higher in the sky, casting a cold, white light that somehow turned warm and pleasant, filtered through the greenhouse-like windows of Luna’s home. Through the slightly foggy glass, Draco could make out the back garden, its grass yellow and brittle from the unforgiving winter, its frost-covered fences glimmering in the midday glare. Inside, the sunroom smelled like a luxurious summer day.
Pansy,” Draco had said through gritted teeth. Pansy had ignored him, as was her habit when Draco said ludicrous things about Potter — which he had to admit was probably the case in that moment — and had turned to call out for her husband with a shrill, “Blaise! Come over here,
Narcissa stares at him for a second, as though she can’t quite believe he dared say the words he did. Then she lets out a surprised, delighted little laugh and shakes her head.
I didn’t mean to upset or insult you. It was just. I was just trying to tell you: I know, and I’m all right with that.
Kingsley fixes him with a level look. “They’ve been on Malfoy’s case for years. Zacharias Smith leads the auditing team and swears they’ve never found any irregularities in Caduceus’ statements. In appearance at least, Malfoy is clean. Too clean. Not only does his company display impeccable financial records, but he also owns and runs several charities for which he donates substantial amounts of Caduceus’ profits. Still, there’s something about the way it all started that makes us suspect that Caduceus — and by extension, Malfoy — are not as guiltless as they seem to be.”
(Harry can’t quite believe he got Malfoy all the way here) — Harry traps the bag of takeaway under a stasis spell. He sneaks off to shower while Malfoy gets settled in the kitchen — Draco Malfoy, in Harry’s kitchen! — and returns wearing freshly laundered jeans and a jumper.
he had, the annoying swot. But Malfoy’s exceptionally early graduation had been brought on by a specific achievement. He had invented Juvence, a medical potion that subtly slowed signs of aging. Many a witch and wizard had tried to create anti-aging potions, always with limited, if not disastrous outcomes. Malfoy's potion was both a feat of inventiveness and skill. It was also a tremendous commercial hit. Juvence was the first product launched by Caduceus Corporation. According to the reports provided by Zacharias Smith’s team, Juvence remained the company’s bestseller and primary cash-cow years later.
“No,” Harry counters. “Have you got anything to hide?” Draco presses his lips into a thin line. He doesn’t answer. Harry wants to shake him. “Have you got anything to hide that I should know of, Draco? This is serious. Think about your business. Your employees. Think about Scorpius—”
“Draco –” Harry's voice comes out strangled, pleading. His black hair is sticking to his sweaty forehead, and Draco feels incredibly sexy, powerful, wanted. He pushes up into Harry’s fist and gasps.
Caduceus’ massive profits had also allowed Malfoy to start various charities: rehabilitation of inmates fresh out of Azkaban; funds for war orphans; several charities that provided information and support for autistic wizarding children and their families.
And it would have been so much worse if you hadn’t been there… Scorpius would have been in so much trouble. Thank you,” he says again.
“Yes, of course you did,” Malfoy says, something low and snarling in his tone. “And who wouldn’t have encouraged you? But I…” Malfoy turns his attention back to the sink, picking at the grout with a fingernail, “... I wasn’t even allowed to think about it. Malfoys don’t become Aurors. They become— I don’t know. Investors. Bankers. Fine magical art dealers. Wizengamot members. But nothing so…
“Not when you’re about to lose your mind over that bloody quill you can’t find, and I’m your only hope of finding it.” Harry narrows his eyes, mock-thoughtful, ignoring Draco's disgruntled expression. “Hmm. So. Tell me everything you know about the missing quills.”
Well I don’t see much of a difference between now and before. Harry is here most days (and nights). Daddy is always beaming, even when he’s making his serious business face. (Even then. Behind it, he’s beaming).
Draco swallowed. Then set his champagne glass on the table behind him. His heart was thudding in his skull, his mouth gone dry. Potter hadn’t even bothered with an innuendo.
Harry smiles back, and feels a bit soft and pathetic for it. “Oh really? But you’re so brilliant at it. What
“Oh.” Harry had been surprised that Draco hadn’t reflexively insulted his best friend. For Draco, two things were clear: one, he must have really been an excellent bully back then, if his intimidation tactics were so second-nature to him; two, he clearly sucked at his job now, if he could forget his role so easily in Harry’s presence. He could choose to pick up his own slack and call Granger that horrible slur he’d used in Second Year. Or he could choose to stay on the path that seemed more and more natural these days, the path that had led him to befriending Harry.
It was like reading a Victorian novel. Malfoy had had quite a full personal life in his early twenties, the configuration of which had changed as swiftly as it had begun.
Ernestina is already busy with her next task, which apparently involves brewing several tins of tea in litres of boiling water.
Mephistopheles—it was his full name, and Merlin knew how much he hated that Draco shortened it—flapped his bat-like wings and landed in front on him on the moss-covered ground. His skin was shining, a puffy, sunburned-looking red. He smelled like sulfur. The scent was all the rage in the Hereafter, but Draco had never really cared for it.
Harry lifts a non committal shoulder. He’s not sure he has the strength for that kind of conversation. Pansy lowers her eyes, a faint tremble of her hand.
Imperceptible details, flashes of conversations, stunted gestures file past his brain. Draco’s strained, sometimes overtly suspicious demeanour at the beginning of Harry’s employment.
“Looks like you’re not going to have much of a choice in the end, Malfoy. You don’t even have your guard dog with you. And I’m not talking about the useless three-legged fluff ball over there,” Smith adds, throwing a disdainful look at Balzac. “It looks like your darling Potter has abandoned ship as well.”
“Thank you, Ernestina,” he tells her, and she bustles past Harry to fill a mug of bergamot-scented amber liquid.
Your life, your experiences. So yes, some questions will sound silly because we both know the answers, but please, play along anyway.” He gave her a smile that he hoped projected self-assurance. “So, er. Hi.”
Then he sleeps on it fitfully, and wakes up in the morning with the same silent ache in the pit of his stomach, the same heavy longing.
“I see why you’re worried. I should have mentioned my blackmail plan has been entirely hypothetical so far. But Cavendish and all the others are linked, and they talk. If one of them said they’d been attacked or robbed by a wizard, it wouldn’t take long for anyone with more money than they can spend and less attachment to ethical practices to trace my magic back to me.”
“We’ll be nice, Harry.” Hermione pats his arm. “All I want to talk about with Draco is our project.”
“Oh, come on, mate.” Ron seems eager for the change of topic from Acromantulas to almost anything else. “It can’t be that bad for you, can it? I know we haven’t talked about your… er, personal life in a while.”
was that?!” Zacharias Smith is lifting himself off the ground on all fours. He rubs a hand on his face, stares back at Harry and Scorpius, a mixture of disbelief and dark hatred written on his face. Then he turns towards Draco. “Malfoy, is that your
Ernestina looks like she’s trying very hard not to scowl. Reluctantly, she sets towards Draco’s study.
full of forgotten things that made Draco wish he could disappear and be forgotten too; Potter’s eyes always on him, always — unrelenting, no trace of mercy in them. Draco slipped under the covers of Pansy’s bed, burrowed against her and Blaise’s warm bodies, let them touch him and kiss him and fuck him until his mind was blank — just for a few moments.
nigh. They were last spotted on Ben Macdui, a mountain which had been known since ancient times as a magical place, and since more recent, Internet forum discussion times, as a rapture-free space.
Neville threw himself between Pansy and the snowman with a look of playful disbelief. “Not fitter than me, love?”
Draco moaned around Harry’s cock, his eyes falling shut with the intensity of the moment, Harry’s pleasure emanating from him in waves, lingering against Draco’s fingers like magic, dripping salty against his tongue. Draco started bobbing his head slowly, feeling his way around Harry’s cock, exploring the contours of it with his tongue, testing his own limits. When it hit the back of his throat, he gagged a bit and pulled away. He felt Harry tense above him.
He threw his Auror partner a mutinous glare. The git was already far ahead of him. He hadn’t even noticed Harry had stopped. Rather, he
“Yes,” he tells her. Then, turning to Scorpius, “I’m going to the kitchen with Ernestina. Can you stay with Balzac and — erm,
So he lets Harry take the lead. And Harry rams against him once, twice more and stills with a cry. Draco feels the warmth and wetness through his jeans. Whispers, “Fuck, Harry, that was hot—”
Harry said he’d stay and help, and Draco wants to wait and see if Harry’s going to prove it — prove his trustworthiness, prove that he is actually on Draco’s side. Perhaps it’s even less rational… Draco wants to know if he can trust Harry again. Because he realises, in spite of their history, in spite of years of angry jabs and bullying and antagonism… Harry has always been there. He’s the best person Draco has ever known. Harry Potter, despite everything, has always been one of the good people. To picture him living this duplicitous life for a job… it makes no sense. It drives Draco mad.
it becomes a matter of national wizarding security. Which is why we can’t just have the Aurors on this case. We need someone with more... power.”
If the person sitting across from him was a girl, Harry’d have a name for the butterflies in his stomach.
Abashed, they exchanged a look. Draco had to admit neither of them had thought of this. He wasn’t joking when he said he was grateful for Granger’s help, or they would still be in the Library next June, trying to figure out what to do with their lives.
“As much as I love the reminder of how empty my life is, with or without a romantic partner in it…” Harry interrupts them before the whole room decides it’s a good time to eavesdrop, “...it, er, might be getting better.”
Hermione swishes her wand and the toys on the sofa fly into the toy box. She goes to sit next to him, looking exactly like she did when she was flipping through books at the Hogwarts library in search for an answer to her questions.
“I think we are,” Draco tells him. Worry suddenly gnaws at the back of his mind. “Do you… not want to?”
“Luna!” Neville skidded to a stop when he saw Harry and Draco there as well. “Erm. I didn’t know you weren’t done.”
good at my job. But I tend to attract a lot of unwanted attention as well, which can be off-putting for many of my clients. So I don’t work often. Actually, most of the time, I don’t work at all. I pick my clients based on the type of security they require, on the kind of people they are… and on personal compatibility.”
even as you’re floating in a sea of satiation. Listen to me. I didn’t know those feelings even existed. Thanks for introducing them to me. I feel ruined, but it’s all for a good cause.
“Then get on with it,” Harry growls, and rip Malfoy’s t-shirt off. With a few frantic, grunting motions, they undress each other, clothes getting tossed to the side of the bed. Then Harry wraps his hand around the back on Malfoy’s neck, and pulls him down next to him.
“Merlin,” Ginny murmured, rubbing her neck where the collar of her jumper met her freckled skin. When she looked at them, her eyes were shining with moisture. “Do you think all our Christmases will be like this?
“Isn’t it?” Draco gives him a wry little smile. “I do mean it as a compliment, though. I sometimes wonder if you changed, or if I did.”
They’d been walking in the snow for what felt like hours, Harry’s nose slowly turning into an icicle and his hands and feet growing numb with cold. There was still no sign of anything remotely suspicious, despite Malfoy’s methodical, fastidious combing of what seemed like every single square inch of this bloody mountain. Once an arse-licker, always an arse-licker, Harry thought pettily. Malfoy couldn’t help kissing up to to the higher-ups even when there was no one but him and Harry around. Arse-kissing was probably embedded in his genes.
he wants to snap. He keeps his mouth shut. He’s learned that antagonising the press only makes the next-morning tabloid titles worse.
For some reason, Harry is reminded of Draco, and the way he seamlessly mixes magic and Muggle influences in his daily life.
The folder contains several pages covered with columns of numbers. Financial statements, Harry guesses. Corporate information about a potions company whose name vaguely rings a bell. Everywhere the same ominous logo: a silver snake wrapped around a wand shooting sparks. Everywhere the same tagline in silver-lettered, pretentious Latin.
In size and location, Ernestina’s room is the same as the guest room above. Other than that, it has nothing of the blank, hotel-like quality of its second-floor counterpart. It can only be described as… well, a
ideas for how to spend his time with Harry. However, the prospect of having to face their Headmistress with nothing to show for the task she had assigned them had quickly quelled those particular wishes. By the looks of it, it had been the right call: Minerva McGonagall had just sent her favourite messenger.
They’d either been standing here by mistake, or someone’s tipped them off. Harry had been so careful on his way to the bathroom with Draco — there was no one around, he could have sworn it. That’s just his luck. Or the press’s uncanny ability to sniff him out and track him down anywhere, and mostly when he
Parvati Patil drops her mug on her desk. Draco can follow the timeline of her caffeine intake by the coffee tracks drying on the sides of the white porcelain. Third cup of the day.
With his eyes closed, all Draco can do is feel. He holds Harry’s face between his hands and kisses him, fiercely. He kisses him open-mouthed and hungry, the slide of Harry’s lips opening under his like a lightning bolt down his spine. He licks the inside of Harry’s bottom lip, holds his tongue there, waits.
The bet was to fart in a Ministry lift containing no less than three people. When Plinius, Kingsley and Gawain all walked into the same lift as me, I saw an opportunity and took it.
Harry moves. He slides up Draco’s body. His weight feels so good. An anchor, a truth, in a sea of shifting, faceless threats. He takes Draco’s face between warm hands.
Malfoy laughs, low and tremulous. “If you don’t get your cock in me right this minute, Potter, I might kill you. Hold it in your hand.” Harry takes his cock, then pulls Malfoy’s arse cheeks apart with his other hand, breath quickening at the sigh of Malfoy’s lube-shiny, quivering hole. “Yes,” Malfoy encourages him, “that’s it, Harry. Now, push it gently in…” Malfoy’s voice catches as Harry presses the tip of his cock in, his left thumb still holding him open. Harry wishes he could see Malfoy’s face in this moment, though he understands that Malfoy picked a position that would be easier for Harry’s first time. Malfoy pushes back an inch, and Harry’s thoughts snap to the here and now. “Fuck, Potter,” he says, panting slightly, “even the head of your cock is big. Now, keep pushing in slooowly…” Malfoy’s word fades in a long, guttural moan as Harry thrusts in carefully. He’s not sure if the instruction to go slow is for Malfoy’s benefit, or purely for his pleasure, but it doesn’t matter. There’s a moment where he doesn’t think Malfoy will take him any deeper, but then Malfoy’s body yields to him with a soft gasp, and Harry slides in all the way through. He watches, fascinated, as the length of his cock disappears inside Malfoy’s arse, the way Malfoy stretches around Harry’s girth. Taking him in. Letting him share his body. And when Harry’s sheathed to the hilt, he places both hands on Malfoy’s hips and slowly pulls back.
“Fine.” Draco had given his tie one last tug. Walking up to Harry, he’d slid a hand around Harry’s chin, lifting his head up for a possessive kiss. “Let’s go have dinner.”
Luna said, her calm voice and fuzzy blond hair making her look like she was floating two inches above the ground, “and Harry chose Draco. Look at our auras, Ron: all shimmering pink and red and gold. Like yours and Hermione’s.” She dreamily smiled at Draco from across the table. Jeff the Niffler poked his twitching nose out of her cardigan’s pocket. “I’m so happy for you, Draco.”
Harry swallows. The room is so quiet he can hear Balzac’s tail swishing against the marble floor in the foyer, Draco’s quiet exchange with Ernestina down in the kitchen. He can hear the rustle of Narcissa’s brocade robes when she moves to clutch her hands in front of her. He nods, slowly, and Narcissa’s expression softens.
Malfoy looks up at Harry, follows the movement of his hand when he brings it back to his cup of tea. His grey eyes are still, but there’s no distrust in them.
“Never knew it was a fantasy of yours.” Harry placed his hand on Malfoy’s bare chest and pushed, a gesture more gentle than commanding. In the darkness, he saw Malfoy smile and step back until his back hit the wall. He sprawled his hands on the dry, white tiles.
“Come on,” Draco says, pulling on Harry’s hand. He tries to stifle a burst of giggles and fails. “Get in the lift! I want to show you something.”
“Malfoy. You know just as well as I do that it’s not. You said it yourself when we entered this cabin: there’s something wrong with it. The anti-Apparition wards. The magic-muffling spells.” He gave him a significant look. “This isn’t a normal mountain refuge.”
“You think I wouldn’t lose anything? Are you blind?” Harry feels a deranged, crooked smile twist his lips. “I changed sides to protect you, Draco. To be with you. Or did you forget?”
“There isn’t a deadline,” he said, tapping his dirty-nailed finger to where Draco’s heart should have been if he had one. “But I expect significant progress to have been made by the end of the month.”
Draco picked an almond. His fingertips brushed Harry’s palm. It was warm and soft, and Draco’s breath caught in his throat.
She hung Draco’s things on a coat peg and sauntered off to the living room without another word of invitation. Bewildered and hesitant, Draco followed her. Luna had always been unpredictable and hard to read. Her Hogwarts nickname flashed in Draco’s mind.
“Thanks?” Draco shifted on his stool. “Anyway...would you say your relationship played a part in your post-war reconstruction as well?”
“Package for the D… LF.” Harry Potter walks through the door, holding a big cardboard box under one arm and an empty takeaway coffee cup in the other. Then the coffee cup falls to the floor, and he freezes.
“You crazy sod,” Harry steps out of the lift, rolling his eyes with a smile. “Why do I ever follow you anywhere?”
Hands on Draco’s face, he turns them around until they’re behind the door, hidden from view. He backs them up until Draco hits the wall with a soft thud and a gasp that’s half surprise, half pleasure. Draco curls a leg around the back of Harry’s thighs and oh, god, he’s hard under his elegant trousers, and Harry’s helpless in his arms again, weeks of misery forgotten in the slide of their lips.
“Anything!” Jeff squeaked eagerly before clapping his paws on his mouth. He attempted a more casual pose then. This didn’t fool Draco. “I mean—I don’t really care anymore, but I’ll listen to your pathetic propo—”
Draco handed her a quill. She signed at the bottom of the scroll in the same loopy, diligent handwriting that Draco remembered from their childhood days. The parchment folded itself into a crane and took off. It flew in a low, graceful circle above their heads, then disappeared with a faint pop. Luna looked at Draco, amused.
Since we’re being nagged left and right about it (you may have chosen to live with Weasley, but nowhere does it say I have signed up on receiving pissy memos from bloody Zacharias Smith,
darling, you’re so fucking hot—” Draco moans when Harry rolls his hips. He’ll never get tired of the initial thrill of feeling a hot, heavy cock slide against his body. It’s that first touch, breathtaking like a clap of thunder, that he’s been chasing in the clubs, in the furtive encounters with young, pretty men. The fact that it’s
Harry met his eye with a smile. “And I’d prefer you’d call me Harry.” Then, lower, “I think we’re past the use of surnames, Draco.”
“Yeah. Not like McGonagall gave us a choice.” Harry said. Seemingly regretting his remark, he hastened to add, “Not that I mind. At all. I don’t mind doing this with you, just... Why d’you reckon McGonagall wanted this done in the middle of winter? I wonder why it couldn’t wait until we’re closer to the end of the school year.” He was attempting to sound casual and, in Draco’s opinion, failing.
Ron had just patted Harry on the back in apology and left him alone. To Harry's own endless surprise, he’d thrown himself into the task, reading about Malfoy’s life with a hunger bordering on fascination.
So it must be something that had happened after that. They’d been talking, and Harry had been all relaxed and sleepy. He’d said something, hadn’t he? And then Malfoy’s tone had shifted to cold, distant, and he’d turned away from Harry…
“I couldn’t get a hold of you yesterday,” Draco breathed, not even pretending to pay attention to anything else but Harry.
Draco holds him for a long time. Around them, outside the tall windows, the city lights glimmer in the night, an incessant race for life, as if Harry’s world wasn’t teetering on the edge of crumbling down.
The grey light of dawn is filtering through the curtains now. Harry’s senses are still full of Draco — the taste of Draco’s skin, his lips, his sweat, the inside of his thighs, the long length of his cock, lingering on his tongue. He’d been careful with Draco last night like he hadn’t been with a lover since his first times with Ginny, and later, the first time he’d had sex with a man. There was something about this particular first time, about what Draco had revealed to Harry a few weeks before, that made Harry want to commit his every touch, his every move to memory. Draco had felt exquisitely vulnerable last night, open and trusting in a way Harry would have never expected from him if he didn’t know him so well already.
Draco interrupted him by licking a wet stripe with the flat of his tongue. Harry bucked forward with a moan so loud that Draco hoped to Merlin, Circe and whatever other deity was watching that Luna’s errand had taken her far, far away from the house. He licked Harry again and again, saliva dripping down Harry’s cleft, his hole clenching and unclenching until Draco could finally slip the tip of his tongue inside. He pushed in, amazed by the incredible heat and tightness.
that I’m trying to keep safe.” Draco glances at him, without lifting his head. Harry crumples the parchment in his hand as he continues.
Frankly, Draco didn’t want to think about his next life. He’d grown quite attached to his current one. Leaving it again—soon, so soon—wasn’t something he looked forward to.
It was just a very convoluted way to ask you on a date. And Merlin knows I’m not a convoluted person (so maybe that’s why it didn’t work?)
With one last pat on Harry’s arm, Narcissa left the room. Harry turned to Draco with a bright, cocky smile. Draco hid his face in his hands and peered at him from between his fingers.
“Just… maybe don’t let the news of your relationship with Draco travel to the Ministry. Ron’s not on the case anymore. It’s officially no longer his responsibility. But if Kingsley finds out about it… you’ll be out on your arse in an instant. Possibly forever.”
“Where did you find this?” he asks, slowly, like the parchment is a bomb that could explode if he raises his voice.
He extended his arm, bent at the elbow. The questioning lift of his eyebrow was all the incentive Malfoy needed; he linked his arm to his.
Harry has thought about it. But he’s also read Kingsley’s reactions to his memos, each one of them proving that Draco’s main activities are working for Caduceus, going for his daily run and spending time with his son — as well as his occasional conversations with Harry, but Harry never mentions them. It’s been more than four months now, and Kingsley keeps asking Harry for more of his time, more information, more details. Harry reads between the lines and knows that the Minister is still not convinced of Draco’s innocence. He’ll probably never be. Yet as long as Harry’s there, learning as much as he can about Draco and sharing information with the Ministry and the DMLE, he knows Draco’s safer than with any other agent of the Ministry.
After Draco’s left, the light of the sun fades entirely. Night settles; Harry forgets to cast a Lumos
“You did?” Malfoy asks his son. He sounds softer than Harry has ever heard him. “That’s brilliant, Scorpius.”
Harry leaned closer, showing his teeth as he grinned. “Can’t you be serious for longer than half a minute?”
Not for his fame, or for the bragging rights of fucking the Savior of the Wizarding World or the Quidditch World Cup champion or whatever else people saw when they looked at him. Draco Malfoy wanted him, Harry. The real him, the one who was still the same lost, angry, love-starved boy underneath the success. And Harry wanted Draco Malfoy for all the same reasons.
“You’ve met him, haven’t you?" Harry asks. "He’s audited Caduceus’ accounts for years without finding a breach. He’s certain that you’re a fraud. He’s made it his mission to expose you. The Aurors tell me he’s never recovered from what he thinks is a personal failure.”
The thought popped into Draco’s head, unbidden. He fought the instinct to roll his eyes. He wasn’t the condescending person he used to be, was he? It wouldn’t do to give Harry a reason to believe him unprofessional as well as unchanged.
coming from the corridor, like nails tapping on the marble floor, and a big, shaggy Bernese mountain dog appears. He's got beautiful black and white fur with rust-coloured patches above his eyes. He's missing a front leg, but it doesn't stop him from excitedly limping towards Harry. He looks up at him, tongue lolling, and shakes a friendly tail.
“Draco,” he says, placating. “Does it have to be a secret? It’s nothing shameful. It’s actually quite brilliant.”
Of being buried there, inside his Gringotts vault, and all those riches going to waste. He’d decided then and there that if he couldn’t — wouldn’t — have a job like everyone else, he could at least put his vault to use and become a rich, recluse benefactor.
“Draco, I have tremendous respect for your work. If I let anyone write anything about me, it would be
Nestled inside Draco’s left forearm. Faded black and gnarled. A shock of ugliness, branded on Draco’s otherwise spotless skin.
I don’t know what’s going on. I keep going through every detail of that night, trying to figure out where it went wrong. What I did wrong. Did I do anything wrong?
Draco moans into the kiss when Harry’s thumbs slide down to the side of his jaw, his palms cupping Draco’s face. Harry takes his bottom lip between his teeth and pulls — it’s more teeth than Draco’s used to, but he’s not going to complain. Harry pulls back once more, and this time his eyes lift to Draco’s — all wide and stunned behind slightly fogged spectacles.
Then he shakes his head. He’s here to grab his coat and mind his own business. He starts to make for the rack where he knows his coat to be.
Harry lifted his eyes to look at Malfoy. His expression was so open, his bright grin so sincere, it reminded Harry of everything he loved about his job. Of everything they both loved about their jobs.
Harry, good, strong, kind-hearted Harry, was sacrificing his future for Draco. He was jeopardising the faith the Ministry was putting in him, all for Draco. If anyone other than their friends found out about their involvement… If anyone found out Harry was having a love affair with Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater and current suspect in a DMLE case… that he’d
“That’s hardly a fair competition,” Draco said. “You’re a professional Seeker. All you’ve done for the past ten years is train for this every day.”
Harry nods slowly, and Draco finally lowers his hand. He takes a step back, walks around Harry’s bed to leave but pauses at the last moment, hand ghosting on the side of the bed, fingering the hospital corner loose. Not looking at Harry, he murmurs, more to himself than to anyone else, “I could never refuse you anything, could I?”
I’m talking about.” He glances up at his friends then, almost pleading. “It’s just... it’s been a long time since I’ve felt this way about someone.”
Took me years to sort it out.” He kisses down the side of Draco's neck. “I've never done this before. Fuck, Draco, kiss me again, please—”
“Every non-heterosexual boy had a fantasy set in these showers, Potter. More than one, as far as I’m concerned.”
turned up towards him, as patient and hungry as something lurking in the woods. He can’t… yet he sees the same want he feels, reflected in Malfoy’s eyes. A mirror to Harry’s desire, blending with something akin to awe. To fear.
“The secret to a successful ‘snap’,” Draco speaks up, spinning around slowly as his colleagues stop to listen once again, “is to maintain the advantage a pretty ‘bend’ will give to your bum. When you bend, you push your arse up and out — make sure it stays slightly out when you snap back up. Like this— “ Draco bends again, denim-clad arse in the air, and, just when the door bursts open, lifts back up in a sharp move, hips to the side, arse popped back, jeans tight across his rear—
Draco’s eyes light up for a second, and he comes closer to Harry. They’re so close, Harry can almost feel Draco’s body heat. Or maybe it’s getting hot in here… is it? Draco takes the feather between his fingers, the pads brushing against Harry’s palm as he does. The air swishes around the quill as Draco rolls the stem between his fingers, examining it.“Yes,” he says, thoughtful. “Thank you.”
“I don’t know,” Harry says in a strangled whisper. “I guess I don’t care. I like Tchaikovsky. His music just makes me…
and the crushing sensation slowly fades. He takes a big gulp of air, then another. It’s like resurfacing after a long dive, his lungs too tight for the intake of breath. He’s cold, shivering, but the feeling of the room closing up on him recedes. He might not break down.
If he was perfectly honest, Harry had been just a tiny bit thrilled when Head Auror Smith had announced their assignment. A chance to stealthily stare at his ex-nemesis-turned-reluctant-Auror-partner’s fit body might not present itself for another five years, so he took it.
“Fuck,” Harry curses, adrenaline flooding him, blood pumping through his skull, his entire body going hot.
This interdepartmental memo is to inform you that the bet you took last Friday night at the pub was rightfully won by Hermione Granger, Unspeakable (and colleague of the undersigned).
“Mother,” Draco whines, shoulders slumping. Despite the unsettling effect the words of Draco’s mother had on him, Harry hide a fond smile behind his hand. Draco looks so much younger, like he’s about to throw a fit and call Narcissa
“Draco! PLEASE!” He begged. “Don’t let me go back there! They’ll tear me to pieces, those ravens, they will! Even if they spare this poor ol’ Niffler, Mephisto’s going to ask questions!”
he said authoritatively. Harry felt a shiver of misplaced excitement shoot down his spine, and the door flew open.
“I’m applying for a scholarship at St Salena College at Cambridge,” Hermione explained. “They have the best combined Muggle and Wizarding undergraduate degree in History and Spells Archeology. I want to keep learning about magic,” she said, her cheeks pinking slightly, “and how it affects our magic and Muggle worlds.”
“Nah,” Weasley was waving him off good-naturedly, “Malfoy is one of the best there are. Remember how many games Slytherin used to win when he played for them?” He turned to look at Draco and shrugged apologetically. “As much as it pains me, you’re not all bad, Malfoy.”
going to die here. Who knows how long the storm will last? And then when it stops… we’re stuck, aren’t we? The door’s shut, there are several tons of snow blocking it by now, and we can’t Apparate out.” He looked at Harry from the corner of his eye. “I’m going to die next to Harry Potter. Like I should have, seven years ago, if it wasn’t for you.” He laughed mirthlessly. “After all this time, karma is finally catching up.”
“This, Mister Potter,” McGonagall said, “is why I chose to pair you with Mister Malfoy,” She gave them a thin-lipped smile. “If anyone can understand what extenuating circumstances are when it comes to choosing your future... it’s certainly the two of you. Mister Potter, you can be the one who leads both of you on the unknown road. Mister Malfoy, you can be the one who brings both of you back home when you’re ready for it.”
“The house has four stories,” Malfoy starts telling him in that drawling, posh voice of his. He seems more at ease now that he has control over the subject. “The ground floor, with access to the street on the east side and a private garden on the west side. The garden is protected by Muggle and magic anti-trespassing equipment both. We’ve never had any issue with it.”
Draco keeps his eyes on Harry, steady, as he shakes his head. He looks cornered. Frightened. Yet unwavering. He closes his eyes, and he’s still in Harry’s space, and Harry can see the way his long eyelashes fan over his cheekbones. There’s something painful in the pit of Harry’s stomach, and he has the sudden urge to reach out and run his thumb across those cheekbones, across the jut of Draco’s bottom lip. “I can’t…” Draco admits, barely a whisper in the hush of the room. “I can’t tell you.” He opens his eyes again, and his expression changes: no longer pained, but defiant, seeking Harry’s eyes. “Can you accept that?”
“Merlin, no. Annoying? Yes. Arrogant and immature? Of course. Getting on my nerves every time you opened your mouth? You’re damn right you were. But
“Not exactly. Look, he had me followed since even before I started working for him. He was getting suspicious.”
Despite the gravity of their situation, Harry burst out laughing. He grabbed Malfoy’s hand and pulled.
Harry looks between his two friends, irritated. “What the hell is this about? What did I just say? I just told you I’m getting to know Draco as part of the mission, and you act like you just heard some kind of great revelation.”
That’s how Harry ends up in Draco’s study that evening, with a glass of champagne in one hand, a canape in the other, and the most improbable assortment of people he could imagine around him: Draco, his mother, Pansy and Blaise Parkinson-Zabini, Ron and Hermione. There’s also Ernestina and Scorpius, adding their slightly perplexing presence to the mix. Next to the sofa, on the lookout for fallen crumbs of canapes, Balzac lies on the floor, tail wagging.
Harry folds his arms over his chest. He’s said no already. He wishes he could be as convinced as he sounded a minute ago. He glances down at his folded arms, his right hand resting on top. After all these years, the scar remains stark and white against his olive skin.
Draco laughs. “The people who care—?” When Harry takes a step towards him, Draco flinches. “The public’s never seen my Mark. Even during the trial… I refused to show it.”
“Maybe… we can give you gentlemen five minutes?” Penelope’s voice brings him back. She’s already standing, beckoning the girls to follow her.
It was a high-profile case, too: it had all started when a few nutters had become persuaded that the end of the world was nigh. Not only nigh, but like really,
“This is so fucking unfair, Draco. We discussed everything together. It was part of our plan. I stayed by mutual agreement.”
Tearing his eyes away from the fascinating sight of a talking animal that no one else but Draco could hear speak, Draco told the little group gathered around him: “Or, you know, maybe not. We don’t want to set him out on the grounds and have him attacked and killed, do we?”
He turns a corner and finds himself standing in the entrance hallway. The sounds of the party barely filter, so far from the ballroom. It is blissfully empty of people — and what’s even better, of members of the press. Harry heaves a sigh of relief. The air is cooler here, too; it smells like night and fresh-cut flowers, and Harry is at once filled with hope and undecipherable longing. What if… what if he picked up his coat and left? What if he went for a long, wandering stroll along the streets of London, lost himself in the sprawling anonymity of the Muggle city? The cloakroom is calling to him, and so he strides towards it, determined to let his sudden yearning for freedom take the lead.
much easier to just follow us nicely? Or did you really have to make us corner you like a hunted animal? What are the Aurors going to think now they’ve seen you fight?” Smith stops pacing, turns to Draco. Something on Smith's face makes Draco grimace. “That looked suspicious as hell, if you want my professional opinion.”
“Oh, no, babe.” She kissed him on the lips. Half their friends wolf-whistled and the other half made puking noises. “You’re the fittest bloke around here.”
he realises. As Harry stares at the picture, photograph-Malfoy winds an arm around his wife’s shoulders, pulling her closer to him with a fond smile as she laughs. They look bright, carefree. Happy. The photograph loops again and Harry snaps out of it. He puts the frame back where he picked it up and quickly walks out of Scorpius’s room.
I actually don’t know why I’m surprised. This is so you.” He rubbed the back of his head, looking as though he’d said too much. “Er, is there anything else you thought you’d be?” he asked quickly. “I mean, being Creative sounds fun,” he added, “but what then? Hermione thinks we might get better results if we just... talk to each other about our options.”
Draco had looked down at the album cover with a crooked smile. The blush on his cheekbones was all the validation Harry’d needed.  “And it’s
He thinks of being eighteen, surrounded by the sweltering inferno swallowing the hidden things, reaching out in supplication — and feeling Harry's hand closing around his, lifting him up, saving him.
“I didn't,” Draco said weakly. He rubbed his temples. Tonight was turning out to be a bit too much new information to process.
Harry had snorted and shaken his head. He was in the mood for sarcasm—that was, until Head Auror Smith had told him he would be assigned the case of the disappearances with Malfoy.
Draco looks up. It’s as if all the tiny threads of tension they’ve both been trying to ignore ever since they realised they fancied each other, ever since they touched each other, are materialising into a sudden, crushing weight. It’s this feeling of being out of control — unable to control the outcome of the case the Ministry is building against him, the case he has to trust Harry with… and also unable to control how he feels about Harry. Reckless, insatiable. Like he’s running down a hill, gathering speed, unable to stop. There’s a low buzz in his head, and Draco wants it to end — to go back to the light, lovely kisses of a minute ago.
Harry shakes his head against Draco’s shirt. He knows he won’t go. He knows nothing he can do will make any of it easier.
“Kill Harry Potter,” he nodded, mustering a businesslike tone. He examined his cuticles. “When do you need it done by?”
“I’m going to play some music now,” he murmured, too close to Draco for comfort. “It’s Muggle, and it’s brilliant. Not a word about my musical tastes. Understood, Malfoy?”
he thought, remembering the previous day’s walk by the lake with Pansy. After a beat, Harry resumed his scribble.
Harry huffed a laugh. “Yeah, walked right into that one.” He looked at Draco, his green eyes gleaming in the torchlight of the corridor. “Having everything planned and laid out in front of me scares me. I do think of the future of course. Just not into that much detail.”
