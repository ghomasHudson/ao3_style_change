'Honestly, spare me. I made my decision.'
. The truth is, I am not in love with her. Not any more. She broke my heart when she chose to leave to advance her career. I was happy for her, of course, but I hated her too. It was months until I managed to get over her. And now she’s here, beautiful as ever and I feel nothing. We slept together (I am still attracted to her) but do I really want to start over again? No, I don’t think so.
and I left.
'You should bring me a glass of wine here so I can watch you work.'
They scream at each other in French and Harry knows something awful is happening, but he can’t help himself. Hearing Malfoy speak the language turns him on. He can’t understand shit, but it doesn’t prevent him from staring at him. He drinks it in and imagines that voice whispering something right to Harry’s ear. In that accent. Bite here and there and-
'What a hypocrite you are, Potter. Coming here, lecturing me, trying to make me guilty of something I had no power over and here
‘Yeah, very cool! Just hold on to the broom, Teddy!’ I scream back at him when I see he’s trying to swerve the broom with just one hand on the handle.
A gleeful smirk appears on his face. “Were you watching me that closely?”
‘You are so annoying Potter,’ he yells but then I can hear him catching up with me. ‘I’m hungry and this wall was a big let-down.’
Work is crazy, loads of bad wizards.
, steps inside the office. Harry hasn’t even realised she was gone, that’s how much he doesn’t care about her.
‘Plenty of times, Potter. More times than you, for sure. Unlike you, I at least know not to smell all the paintings.’
'I see them a lot, you know that.'
'I mean it, Malfoy. Don't tell... please.'
Light from the window is shining directly on Malfoy. Pink and purple, making his hair glow, making it softer and warmer. His neck is long and pale, and was it always like that? He’s not wearing robes, just shirt and trousers. Harry thinks he looks handsome. Fit. Then immediately squashes the thought. There is absolutely nothing nice about Malfoy. Nothing.
'Who knows when.' He looks back at me. 'Thanks for meeting me.' He brings his hands under the table where I can't see them.
Draco regrets those memories.
‘Yeah,’ I agree and Ron looks completely lost.
As soon as possible.
Yeah, I am a fifteen-year-old girl now, writing in her diary as soon as something memorable happens. What am I becoming, for Christ’s sake??
Not that I didn’t do anything else.
'I don't think I will be able go back to sleep.'
'Because I hate thinking about it, about her. I'd rather forget.'
Malfoy then said:
'Oh yeah?'
We stop occasionally, pressing each other into walls or lampposts, very uncomfortable.
, and I do it just for a bit longer until he tries to push me away with his hands against my shoulders. I take his wrists and pin them to the bed and I fuck him, hard, just like he wants, the only way he can stand it with me now.
'Oh my god, it's so hot here.'
'Yeah, I mean it's good... new but good, you know.'
'You are ridiculous. I could've dropped right on my head.'
I laugh because this is ridiculous. 'Yeah, I came because I wanted to feel better.' He is seething, his hands in fists. 'I want you to make me feel better.'
'Yeah. I told them not to.'
Ron nods and finishes his beer. ‘I trust you mate. More wine, Mione?’ he stands up and takes my glass too and I nod.
There is food and drinks and so much alcohol.
The hailstorm has turned to drizzle, and it looks just like Harry’s mind. Scattered and sluggish.
'Okay.'
Malfoy makes a quick work of his jeans and underwear and when their cocks brush together, it sends a jolt of pleasure through his whole body.
‘You’re gross,’ I say.
Silence.
I apparate home, dig out the ring from the bottom of my sock drawer and incendio the damn thing. I feel much better.
‘Huh,’ she exhales, ‘I really did forget. Sorry Harry.’ She claps me on my shoulder. ‘It was such a long time ago.’
It’s pretty hard to keep this diary consistent. I don’t think it needs to be, however, Hermione is of different opinion. Don’t care, I’ll write what I want and whenever I want.
‘So?’ I grit my teeth.
Such a fucking headache!
I kick the door, his eyes blazing with anger when they bang into a wall. He lifts his wand to my face. 'If you don't get out right now, I will hex you right in your fucking face. And then you can say I am responsible for maiming you.'
‘Yeah fine. Just seems strange that’s all. You keep hating on him all the time and suddenly there you two are, he - almost dead on the floor and you above him, looking upon his demise.’
He apparently didn’t, because he keeps asking questions with each step, commenting on every detail.
'Almost empty. I'm saving it.'
'I don't know.'
'I don't want to talk about it! I don't want to hear anything about it. I don't want to see you right now. I need to think.'
It’s way too late in the night for this. I am going to sleep, hopefully forgetting all my bad decisions.
‘Did you make these muffins I like?’ she asks hopefully.
'Well she's not with me, is she? She's with him... I mean, Zabini is good, I sort of like him. Better than some random jerk.'
So, tonight, after the obligatory kiss and run, I sent him an owl asking if he wanted to have a lunch or dinner or if he wanted to go flying, possibly, over the weekend. He replied an hour later that we can go flying and then have dinner.
'I won't until you tell me what the fuck is going on! Tell me what's wrong!'
He laughs and turns his head towards me. 'You can dream, Potter.' He kisses me and I slowly push inside. I muffle his groan with my tongue in his mouth.
'Really? I think I'll be fine not having you stomping around every day.'
He manhandles me down on the bed, not that I put up any fight. I’m that easy for him.
'You're telling me. I threw ball with Rose for hours on end.'
'It's just work. A lot of stress lately.'
and how he pretended he was taking notes and interest.
“Sorry,” Malfoy murmurs into his neck and hauls him to himself.
'I've always loved it with you.'
‘Are you going to write to him or call to see what happened? I mean, that, for me, would be very important. What if…’ Pansy doesn’t finish her definitely atrocious thought because I cut in.
'Yes, it was delicious.'
‘I’m very well, thank you. How are you? I read some great articles about your auror work.’
“It sure looks like it. Crumbs everywhere, your nails,” he shudders, “you’re just so disgusting it’s lucky that desk didn’t just run out on its own.”
'Mhm.'
The meal is a silent affair. It’s good though, at least I don’t have to listen to him anymore, hopefully for the rest of the day.
‘Okay. I’m sorry, I fell asleep after. I wanted to cuddle with you.’ And this is the thing with Potter. He says the most outrageous things, especially after sex. Especially
'Harry.'
Draco L. Malfoy
'Yeah. I think this was great and all but I am ready for something else.'
Ministry of Magic
He never promised me anything, I never promised him anything, we never properly talked about this, I don’t even know him that well.
'God... yeah, yes...'
‘Move it, Potter, I don’t have all day,’ Malfoy shouts and I have just about enough.
I stayed for a bit, drank one beer and I couldn’t do it anymore, Ron looked pained, Neville too, Luna was her usual unperturbed self, which helped, but only a little. So I left and am now wallowing in self-pity.
‘Seven seconds is too long in your presence, Potter. How am I going to survive seven minutes with you? Merlin! At least it’s dark and I can’t see your dumb face,’ he says and jabs me in the chest. If it would be anyone else I’d think it was by accident, but since it is him – this was definitely intentional.
And now, here he is, trying to make his body stretch in unimaginable ways, sitting behind Malfoy and glaring at him when he makes it look as easy as breathing.
‘But you wanted me to tell you what happened and I am here and ready.’ She sits next to Blaise and they both stare at me.
'What?'
'Nothing, absolutely nothing, Potter! As always you proved your work is above all, above your friends and family, above me! Why would I be upset with you for that? It's not like you're the Head Auror and you could've sent literally anyone else other than youtself for this huge arrest of yours! You made a fool out of me! You didn't let me know, no note, no patronus, nothing!! I had to make an excuse for your horrid behaviour! But do not worry, I had an amazing time, lots of presents and alcohol to flush down the disappointment. I fucking made this place a home, Potter. I decorated for the party, I even baked myself a birthday cake! I cleaned your dirty laundry today from the bathroom floor also, because you keep disregarding my displeasure with your utter sloppiness! I did it all so everyone would feel nice today, cozy and at home, for our friends, for us, because you fucking suggested for it to be today, because 'why not join it, Draco, it will be lovely'! So I fucking expected the decency you would come, I wanted just this day for you to be here with me because it was all your fucking idea from the beginning when you suggested we live together!'
I stared at him and then I went with the tactics that’s called
'Yes.'
Now I probably should tell Malfoy this, we were supposed to meet on Saturday.
That is why he’s standing in a packed club, trying to get a glimpse of him.  The music is absolutely awful and the drink he’s been sipping on too. Harry can’t see him. There are, however, many people from their department. And then there is Coraline, currently trying to get to Harry through the crowd of people, all the way from the other end of the venue. He decides to flee from her sight.
I turn to him and he really looks like it personally hurt him. ‘You should read it, it’s actually very interesting.’
'But... why?'
'You know you haven't been left alone right? You still have friends, Potter.'
I asked him.
'So now you're awake?'
'Anything else?'
'Haven't we been there already?'
'Speak about yourself. I am still young.'
‘Well, yeah. But we are us, so it doesn’t count,’ she shrugs and finishes her glass.
Stupid, stupid, stupid.
And, yeah, I must I liked it. It was definitely sloppy but he didn’t complain and it was really arousing when he moaned and tangled his fingers in my hair. He came in my mouth, warned me, but since I was already doing it
‘Oh I am amazing. My dirigible plums are finally growing into their natural wildness,’ she smiles.
'Yeah, me too.'
'Yes, a good person. Someone like you. Not someone like me.' He took a deep breath. 'Now that we're clear, get out. I am tired of listening to you.' He lowers his wand and steps back.
Malfoy keeps thrusting. Three times and four, five times, until he stays deep, winds his arms tightly around Harry’s waist, pulling Harry to lie fully on top. Malfoy grinds inside of him and Harry can feel his release, hot and slick.
'Here.'
I wake up with my face against a pillow and Harry plastered to my back, thigh to thigh, arm to arm, back to chest.
I take my time with getting him ready.
‘Thanks for the lovely offer, but I think I’ll skip.‘ I gulp down my vodka and offer a glass to her.
'You like Witch Weekly? Who would have thought?'
Harry loses his glasses,  jumper and t-shirt, and Malfoy’s trousers are unzipped, and shirt untucked when they finally reach his room.
'Yeah. Excellent.'
“I was talking to you for the last five minutes and the only thing you manage to do was to stare into the distance with your mouth open like a dead fish!”
I put my other hand over hers. ‘I do, Hermione. And I meant it when I said I’m fine. I thought some feelings would arise when I’d see her again, but they didn’t.’
Draco L. Malfoy
he breaks the curses from the objects that people bring. Something was definitely off, so I asked him some more questions. He sneered and sniped his answers, nothing new there.
‘It is always interesting to watch purebloods react to all the ‘mugglenesness’ spurting out of my mouth. And don’t get me wrong, your mother is lovely, much lovelier than mine. Just observing different reactions. It’s fun for me,’ she shrugs.
'Yeah.'
'If you say so. Will you spend the night?'
'No, thanks. You ruined a surprisingly pleasant evening, I'd rather sleep literally anywhere else than here.'
‘I asked for the cherry muffin, Potter. Is that really so hard for you to follow basic instructions?’ I take the lemon bar from the paper bag and glower at him.
‘We can do it now,’ I try to shrug and at that there is cold air on my back and then he turns me on my back, positions himself and kisses me. So sweet and slow, morning breath and all and I don’t even care.
They barely kiss now, just breathe into each other’s mouth, tongues swiping in and out.
'So you took time off so you could do some gardening?'
Ministry of Magic
‘Shut up, Malfoy.’
'But I like hearing you say it. What else?'
'But he wants your food, must be better.'
'I know him too and he'll go for Appleby Arrows.'
Because there’s history that will never disappear or be forgotten. Because he might realise that this is really not what he wants, it’s not me he wants. Because it’s not enough that I’m trying - changing, apologizing, being better. Because I never will be better, not completely. Because there will always be something rotting inside of me.
'I'm sorry! It meant nothing, it was just once, didn't mean anything!'
'And I'll try to be less sloppy. I know I'm messy and that you hate it. I will clean after myself more. And I will get rid of the aftershave if you hate it so much. If I'd knew I would do it sooner, but you never said anything.'
'Whatever you want to tell yourself.'
'Oh. No, she left, might be half a year or so already.'
'Okay. For now let's just cuddle a little longer.'
Ministry of Magic
Potter goes on, ‘I want to help you so that doesn’t happen. Please, give me all of it and other means or devices of communication, if you’re hiding any.’
‘Okay. Then really, seven minutes, boys. Should I sing to you to release that none sexual tension?’ Luna asks.
‘Harry!’ he screams and frankly, there is no need for such volume since Potter is already walking towards us.
I asked Malfoy today, why he was looking at that Wheezes display. He just closed the shop, I was lingering in front of it only for few minutes because I had to stay late in work, and I walked with him before he apparated.
'In two days.'
'You are hilarious.'
I smile at him and sip my overly sweet drink. His hand moves higher up my thigh until it’s resting on my crotch, squeezing p. I smirk, looking at the dance floor, thinking of all things I want to do to him.

and he said
‘Why should I? I love being right.’
‘No Rosie, stop hitting your brother! No. That’s not nice,’ Ron takes Hugo, who is surprisingly not crying, into his arms and scolds Rose. ‘You can’t hit him, he’s just a baby.’
There are only two ways this can go, I think. Either he, for some reason, thinks he needs to tell me he found someone or he want to get back together.
I hate this. I know what they want to hear,
. He just stood there, frozen, under the streetlight, looking at me and I don’t know, we were just so close again and I saw a mole on his jaw under his ear, and that smell, it all just got to me and when I realised what I was doing I clapped him on the shoulder, said goodbye and left.
'You think I can't manage?'
“Potter!”
‘I won’t, Malfoy,’ his jaw clenches, ‘we have shifts. For example, mine starts today at six…’
'Do you want to?'
I stand next to the lifts, contemplating what I’m going to eat for dinner, when the metal gate opens and reveals Malfoy.
‘Do you like the cake?’ he asks me.
'Stop! Stop! Just...start yelling at me, hex me or punch me or anything, because this... right here is not you!'
'When are we going away?'
a little miffed.
'Okay.'
I get up and the prat trips me.
Auror Office
'Guess so.'
'Oh my god, then these will make it much more interesting.'
'Well at least one of us should be. Look, even Clo is.'
'I don't know...'
'Yeah, time flies.'
‘I thought you were supposed to make sure I wouldn’t get hurt on this trip, Potter,’ I say as soon as he is in the hearing distance.
‘Am I your first then?’ I grin.
and she bought me some pink drink called Pink Lady Cocktail – was pretty good, fruity – and invited me over to their table. Malfoy squeaked, I accepted, Malfoy’s face turned enraged, and then I excused myself to go to a loo, where I am right at this moment, writing so I won’t forget anything from the interaction and I for sure don’t want to use the DMLE’s Pensieve – those things keep records.
I came Saturday, as we agreed –
that I’m seeing someone. She asked who it was, how long we’re together, whether we’re serious and so on. So, I had to remind her as well to not tell anyone, that it’s new and blah blah all else.
‘I want to go here,’ I turn to Potter and show him a picture of an old looking building, which is apparently a national gallery.
‘You’re welcome,’ she nods. ‘I wanted to see if you’d changed, I guess. I am very curious person, you must understand.’
, as Kingsley informed me sternly.
'Like naked women, for instance. Oh well, must do with what's allowed.'
I open his mouth, breathing him in. The only chant in my mind is
‘Yes! Great, let’s go!’
'Is this your sort of bar then? Always thought you were too posh.'
I go to the other end of the garden,
I manage to speak after few moments. ‘She didn’t take the position yet, did she?’ She shakes her head. ‘I would suggest talking to her. Because I bet you just went all offensive, trying to be the biggest bitch there is.’ She punches my shoulder and sighs.
Well, still. I think it’s better this way. For now. I really don’t want to explain it to anyone.
‘I’ll have to check where the point is,’ I answer, look around and turn my back to few people who are around and cast a spell. ‘It’s few metres this way, in this park.’
'Then what's going on? Why are you like this? What's going on?'
'I didn't really, not that it excuses anything.'
‘This is taking forever! When will he come?’ He shouts, turning to me.
Lunacy.
Malfoy’s face blurs and fades, rising high above me, his mouth wide open.
'One swish of a wand, how long can it take?'
I just couldn’t let it go so,
‘Potter, it’s almost midnight, come...’ Parkinson appears in the door, Ginny behind her. ‘Salazar,’ she murmurs and comes to kneel next to Malfoy who has now his head laying on the toilet seat. ‘Darling,’ she says and flushes the toilet, ‘what happened?’ She coos at him, stroking his hair. Malfoy just mumbles something and turns his head away from her. ‘Potter? What did you do to him?’
'That's good.'
'I'd choose the tub.'
'But I am your friend and you just kissed me.'
'No problem. That's what friends are for.'
I order Eintopf and Potter orders
'Sounds nice.'
Then they talk. It’s very short and they will have to have more talks about many other things, but it’s sufficient at the beginning.
'Why not?'
'Is this you breaking up with me, Potter? Because in that case you're not getting any shepherd's pie I made.'
‘Exactly. The add writes itself,’ she shrugs. ‘But I also liked you at Hogwarts. Lookswise, of course, your behaviour on the other hand, atrocious.’
I take him in my mouth.
‘No.’
'What is what?'
‘None of your business.’ I went with Astoria the first week we started dating, complaining all the time but secretly enjoying it. She laughed and then took me to another one the next weekend. ‘We are going here. And, of course, you’re paying.’ I snatch it back and, once again, stomp away from him.
I feel his breath in my hair, next to my ear. I shiver.
‘Why not?’ Is Astoria’s answer. ‘And what do you do, Draco? Your mother mentioned potions?’
'I am not trying to.'
‘The fuck you do! You insult my work, my morals, everything I do, you disrespect me! I bet you hate I still breathe the same air as you!’ I grip his wrists harder.
Malfoy’s heavy weight is having some difficulties again, but both men wait patiently, quiet.
Harry’s being dismissed and it’s so not how he imagined things going when Malfoy kissed him back. “All right. Good night, then. And sorry, for, well, you know.”
'You're joking, right?'
‘It’s not an excuse, it’s the truth.’ He’s getting red in the face and his jaw is clenching.
I couldn’t, so I went up to the attic and pulled out an ugly copper bust of a face of some witch, possibly Black, which was, surprise, cursed.
...I jerk awake in the middle of the night, my head on his chest and our legs intertwined. I watch him sleep, breathing in and out.
'Three weeks. Alright. Where?'
‘Week or longer, Salazar knows with those idiots. But she started using the potions more, again, I just want her to have some company, even if it’s not pleasant.’
‘Sure, but not when you’re wrong, darling.’ Both of her hands are scratching my scalp now and I feel tempted to forget everything. It’s so good.
Okay, it’s just that I don’t really know him,
‘Yes, whatever you say, Golden Boy.’
'Blaise said at nine. So whenever you're ready we can go.'
'Harry!' I raise my voice and he turns his head.
I went grocery shopping today. Cashier smiled at me, which I don’t consider flirting since it is her job and she was a woman – plus it would invalidate my theory that whatever Malfoy put me under only works on men.
'Happy birthday again.'
‘Of course, Teddy. We will make it a party, how that sounds?’ she offers and I think I will have to come up with some extraordinary excuse.
I was called to Robards’s offices and he clapped me on the shoulder and asked what I had against Malfoy. I said that not much, (I was a bit surprised I was not getting a dressing-down) and Robards asked me if I needed another auror on the case. So, then I had to explain that it was not really an official investigation but rather something that I did in my free time and so, at that point, I really expected some stern words, written warnings and so on. Robards just laughed, said we can make it into an official affair and
A friend of Hermione from work was chatting me up, not subtle at all, but after few exchanged sentences it was clear he only wanted the Saviour (gross), so, not really being into it, I had to cut it short. Other than that, just few women, but since Ginny was there it might have been a deal breaker for everyone.
'I want to believe so.'
'You must admit we're not exactly the ones people would think end up together.'
'That never bothered you before, to wake me up whenever you were up for it.'
Draco wishes he was alone so he could cry in peace.
'Merlin, Harry. How soppy.'
Department of Magical Law Enforcement
‘Okay. But please make sure you come. I invited some single people so you can mingle all you want!’ Luna says this all cheerful that I miss the meaning for a second.
He keeps gawking, he knows. But he just can’t help wondering how Malfoy can bend that way.
'Yes, then.'
'I don't know.'
'At least I have few seconds reprieve to chew in peace... here you are again, yes. Give him something of yours, Potter! It is your crup so feed it!'
I am still here.
I didn’t stay for the rest, I left and finally breathed in some fresh air.
The lift comes, he steps inside, and I follow.
I told him that I didn’t think it was necessary and it was like I said nothing. He congratulated me on good work and gave me a new case.
“They have these small dragons at the island, and I wanted to take them all home, they were so cute. One almost managed to get inside my
‘Well excuse me if I want to paint as detailed picture as possible for your own benefit. But fine, I’ll speed this up. So, you started drinking, and then very loudly insulting Potter. He heard, obviously, came right in front of you and I swear, I thought he was going to punch you.’ I listen intently even though I start summoning the ingredients and try to pretend I pay minimum attention. ‘So then you dropped your want to the floor and made these cute little fists, in front of your face, hilarious! Potter threw his wand somewhere too and he was about to punch you in your pretty nose when Blaise came between you too and ended the ridiculousness, guided you to the sofa, Potter followed suit and for some reason he gave you even more alcohol.’ Here she turns to Blaise who just shrugs with ‘they were already pissed, no harm done’. Pansy continues and she enjoys this retelling way too much. ‘Eventually Blaise stood up, and there you were, just the two of you. You started talking, well, you started shouting at each other, something along the lines how you admire Potter for saving your life and how he enjoys your potions? Something like that.’
It’s not like I meant to, she was just there, smiling at me, I had maybe few too many at that point and so I kissed her cause she was pretty and she was smiling at me. Ginny saw, of-fucking- course, as did several others. She was furious and I was and still am ashamed.
“I was confused, and you were so close! I wasn’t thinking clearly.” Harry waves his hands wildly and some sparks fly out of his wand.
'You don't know?'
'You are making fun, but I would like to see you get stuck at one place. We both know you'd go crazy.'
G. Robards
‘Is this idea so brilliant it warranted such a dramatic reaction, Pans?’ asks Blaise, unimpressed. ‘Besides. Tomorrow’s Monday. We cannot get sloshed.’
“Potter?”
Ministry of Magic
'Yes. Put her on the sofa then. Good. And now go sit in the armchair. Good boy!'
'Told him what?'
'And do not get me started on that hideous sitting room of yours! It's a total mess and your socks are everywhere and you cannot even do the laundry when I tell you! And your crup, his hair is everywhere!'
The place is packed when we arrive. The music is loud, and I cringe a bit at the very heavy beat. The skin I’m wearing is sweating in the heat and it smells unpleasant. Malfoy is next to me, in his own stranger’s body and the beads of perspiration are visible on his forehead. Like this, he’s a bit shorter than me and I watch him scowling around.
'Do you think he liked the broom?'
‘Whatever you say,’ I smile at him and he goes redder.
So, I got up, put my clothes back on, he covered himself with a sheet, turned to his side and murmured
He’s all around me, holding me, holding him back.
‘Let me interrupt you,’ I say, ‘but try to be quick, I really do need to start brewing and I’m not in mood for you theatrics.’
'Why?'
When Harry comes to, it’s with his head on Malfoy’s chest and a leg thrown over his hips. His spine tingles and he’s warm under the covers. There are fingers in his hair, carding through them. Malfoy’s fingers.
‘Nope.’
I saw Malfoy during my lunch break today, walking out of the Wheezes, carrying a bag. Obviously, I had to talk to him. So, I went up to him, said hello, all very polite, more than a meter between us. He frowned with
I love it like this. Slow and lazy, making love to him. I know it's not that to him, not anymore, but I don't care. If I can't say it I will show him and let him think whatever he wants.
‘We went through this, Draco,’ Astoria sighs for the hundredth time, ‘I am no law expert, but it looks to me that when you signed it you also agreed to it. So, I don’t…’
'Okay, let's go. We are already late.What are you doing? Are you going dressed like this?'
'Are you sure? My mother sent a roast.'
It’s one thing to be angry when first learning about it but go mad when being explained everything and reassured it was safe for everyone is completely different. It’s not like we are sending him to his death, which is exactly how Malfoy behaves.
'More important than our relationship?'
I lie there, my eyes closed, her fingers moving in my hair.
'I think you do, maybe not consciously, but deep down, it's there, true, even if small but there either way.'
‘What?’ I turn once I’m in the sitting room and he almost barrels right into me.
I put the vase on the kitchen table. It’s pretty. Blue glass with red specks all around. I will need some flowers.
‘I am not doing you a favour, you are paying me for this, right?’ I ask and stop mixing.
'Why not here?'
and that was the end to our conversation.
‘What?’ I ask, incredulous.
I go downstairs to make myself a cup of coffee. Ron and Hermione said they would be here by 10pm, the latest. So that gives me three more hours.
The fresh air is harsh. I think I want to get laid. And then I think about Timothy and I want to punch something.
He frowns. Yes, I am impolite.
‘I love you.’
“There are no nails on it! Just shut up and tell me where you put the Delawyn case.”
“Nothing,” Harry hurries to explain and he feels his face warm.
'Fine.'
Teddy looks at him, his lips twitching up in a smile. ‘Yeah, I guess you can try. But leave the writing to me, I don’t want to correct your mistakes.’
'How long do you have it?'
'You like me.'
I know I will knock on his door tomorrow or a week later or in a month.
Malfoy laughs and it sounds crazy, hysterical.
'I don't want to forget. I thought, right after, I did. But it's better to remember.'
'Truly surprising.'
'Can we talk about this later? I really have to go. I'll make it up to you, okay?'
‘How generous, Potter,’ Malfoy snaps.
‘Yes thank you. We will get the check too.’ the waiter is leaving and Timothy is smirking at me. ‘Lost in your head again?’
'No, Harry, I did not cheat on you.'
Harry Potter
'Yes, I can see the roses are no more.'
I take out the brochure I think I saw the picture of it, I came prepared today. ‘The Victory Column. Sure.’
'It's red and you look hot in it. Don't worry though, you won't wear it for long.'
'Don't even finish that sentence, Potter.'
(he cringed, quite visibly)
Ron asked during today’s dinner with him and Hermione. (Malfoy was busy tonight as he informed me the evening prior – after a long necking session on my armchair – I asked him what he would be doing and he said he’s going out with Pansy which led to an odd feeling in my stomach and a question why she didn’t ask me to come too anymore and he said because he asked her not to, so I only nodded because I definitely did not want to know the reason.)
I mean, I can have a little harmless fun, right?
'How am I supposed to make you feel good if I don’t know what you like?'
‘Here,’ I try to give him the brochure I am holding, ‘read it yourself.’
‘I’m not.’ I try not to glare, but barely manage. ‘Fine, whatever you want. I’ll owe you; I don’t care.’
‘And you slept together, didn’t you?’ she sighs.
'I don't know. Might have found something else? I didn't ask.'
'Fuck off. And I wouldn't call you a friend, more like reluctant acquaintanceship.'
'Harry... '
'You're one to talk.'
“What are you grumbling about again?” Malfoy swivels on his chair to face him. “It’s your turn today.”
‘Oh okay. I call you or something,’ she says as she’s taking their glasses and handing them to Potter who is just staring between us. She goes into the crowd and stumbles into  someone. Potter wants to say something, he’s opening his mouth and I just know it’s going to be stupid. ‘Your friend has some difficulties there, Potter. Maybe you should help?’ I nod behind him and he turns and finally sees Granger wildly gesticulating at a stranger who has an arm around her waist.
Ginny fire-called at about two and I was about ready to flee. Everyone huddled around the hearth, I stayed put on the sofa, listening. No one mentioned I was there. Ginny was talking about her team and practise and Wales and how amazing it all is after she finally ditched me and blah blah blah. Okay, she didn’t say the part about ditching me, but it was given. It was amazing and wonderful and peachy because we aren’t together anymore and she’s finally living her best life.
'Why are you screaming at me? I didn't do anything wrong.'
And yesterday, there was a
He huffs. ‘Well apparently it’s not enough. I told them the same story I’ve just told you, several times and they’re not listening. Under Veritaserum, even. I refused Legilimency because I’m not stupid but it’s getting ridiculous at this point. And all your fault, by the way.’
I caught it and Potter didn’t. I won and Potter lost. What a day.
I don’t wait, I step in the flames and floo to Pansy’s. She doesn’t deserve a courtesy of letting her know in advance.
But, eventually, he slows it down, shifting to my neck and only then do I realise I really need to take a breath.
‘So do you hate this as much as I do?’ she asks as soon as there's just us and I snort, very inelegantly.
It confuses Harry. “I know. I was there.” He pushes higher on Malfoy’s chest, so his head is nestled just under his chin.
“Yes,” Harry lies and opens whichever file is the closest.
and I said I was and then she said
'Well it was no different to me. It's Ginny, I will always feel something for her. She is my friend, almost a sister.'
Are we a couple now or is it just attraction or want or –
I then went to Ron on my lunch break, and he said I’m definitely not an asshole
'You are way too excited about this.'
'We can do whatever we want. You can do anything you want to me.'
I breathe. Calm, deep and slow, just so I don’t barge through that door and do something very unseemly.
He lies between my thighs, we kiss. I roll my hips and I love his gasp. I love how he moves against me, how his hair is already plastered to his forehead with sweat, how he wrenches his glasses away, how he looks at me, how he touches me, how he makes me feel insane.
‘So?’
‘Definitely,’ I nod and grin.
Blaise Zabini
. I pushed him against it, asked again if he wanted to stay, he said
'Yes, just a bit.'
'It is a big deal. I was supposed to be here with you.'
‘What?’ he blinks several times and looks down at his watch. ‘It’s seven. Are you joking? I only slept for three hours.’ He lays back down and turns his back to me. ‘Go away.’
I swear, I’m not coming to any of Luna’s parties ever again.
? Point of no return, for me, at least. Because I am here, restraining myself like never before, just because I’m scared he will bolt if I push even a bit harder.
'He is.'
We moved to the sitting room where all the others were and it was warm and cosy, everyone was talking and laughing, and I couldn’t be happier.
‘I should go,’ I say and I hate myself.
I told Malfoy about the patrols – because it is my fault they’re happening – to be careful what he does. He gritted his teeth, cursed me all the way to hell and told me it was all my fault. I agreed of course and apologised again. I didn’t know what else to do so then I left.
'You'd like it. It was pretty posh, in my opinion. I mean for Ron and Hermione anyways. Maybe you'll think it was drab, though. Here it is, look.'
‘Pleasure doing business with you,’ I say as I go for the box, thinking it was fairly easy and almost according to plan, now just to take it, put some tracking charms in place, even if wandlessly and get out of here.
'Of course not.'
and I only wanted to make a civil conversation about what he had in the bag as one would with his childhood nemesis but Malfoy was not having it and was walking away from me before I even managed to ask anything important.
Harry glares at him, or so he hopes. His eyes still sting, maybe it’s just a weird grimace. “What’s going on?”
'You make it painfully clear almost every day, Potter.'
Hermione said I’m not an asshole but that it is not the best way to go about things when I asked her, because I was having second thoughts about the whole thing.
I managed to avoid Celia for the rest of the evening.
and didn’t have a chance to continue because he startled me by pushing me away. He stood up, said
Suddenly, he doesn’t love the pain anymore.
And it’s like nothing happened. She sits down on Harry’s desk, swings her legs, yaps about nothing and laughs way too loud.
'Fine. What are you doing?'
'I did. And thanks for that idea, by the way. I love him.'
Draco thinks of who he knows with such initials, but nothing comes to mind, must be wrong address or an old owl.
His exhale is almost silent when I’m all in. His grip on my hair is a bit tight and he scratches my back, but I don’t care.
'Yes. Okay.'
‘No, unfortunately,’ I answer, smiling at her.
'You, all miserable, slumping over a drink and me, well, awesome as ever.'
‘What a compliment,’ I smirk. ‘Because it sure seems to me that you hate it every time I solve your cases for you.’
‘Ride me, yeah?’ I say. She straightens and she does, moves up and down. I keep touching, her thighs, back, breasts, arms.
‘No it’s not and I am sorry! I told her not to tell anyone and you know her, Draco, she would never.’
‘Better safe than sorry.’
'I missed you too.'
‘No I don’t. I hate that shirt and I only wore it once, here, for her birthday party because Hermione requested I did and immediately as this was taken I spilled that Luna’s concoction she brought, do you remember? It couldn’t be speeled away?’
Fuck.
'Do you have to go home?'
'Yeah. I feel like we barely spoke to each other.'
There’s nothing I can do about it now. It just wasn’t meant to be.
'I mean it. Just a lot of work and stress, nothing more.'
‘Mhm,’ she agrees and smirks at us, ‘I hope you will join, Cissy, it is so nice having you visit us.’
‘Er, I don’t think so, Teddy. Maybe when you’re older.’
'I don't know. I didn't want to. I didn't want to talk about it to anyone, not even them.'
Suffice to say, I’m not attending any party serving alcohol for a very long time.
‘You!’ he yells and tries to shove me off. ‘You think you can get away with everything, our Saviour, don’t you?’ I push harder and his head hits the tree trunk. But it is still not enough for Malfoy who wheezes but still manages to kick me in my shin.
'I hate dancing when people are watching. No one is watching now.'
Draco L. Malfoy
‘I did.’ He doesn’t say anything else.
I absolutely can’t stop touching him.
In other news… well nothing really. Ginny’s still gone, I’m still alone and right now I think I’m about to have some serious headache.
He sees him and his step quickens, gone before Draco manages to get his head around it.
'But he sees me every day. Look, he missed you, just give him some love.'
'What is this? Where did you find a ball? Alright, catch! And bring it back!'
I stand up and push her off my desk. ‘I know this is all very amusing to both of you, but I need to work, so if you can please leave that would be appreciated.’
'But way more tired, sweetheart.'
“I get it, no worries. Break-ups are hard.”
‘You said you would come back Monday and you also said you would let me know if it would change,’ Ron says accusingly. ‘So stand up, put your Cannons jumper on and let’s go!’
Ministry of Magic
'Draco...'
‘Hello? I am here!’ I spread my arms to indicate that indeed I am sitting in the room with them.’
'All of it.'
'Yeah it is. Blaise seems to be enjoying himself.'
'Why are you doing this? I thought we were good. You said you'd try.'
asleep he said
I love when he moans like this. I don't care about the words but about how he sounds when he gasps them, how breathy and warm. For me.
'Best friend is a big stretch. Let's stick to a friend.'
I look at Blaise. ‘And you, Blaise? Were you also pretending to like him?’
Before he slams the door in my face, I push my arm against it. 'A child died because of you Malfoy! You want me to apologize? Then go to her mother and apologize to her first!' God, I want to punch him right in his sneering face.
'You told me after a month. How am I supposed to know if you were faithful the whole time? Maybe you just never felt guilty before.'
“You just made more of a mess.”
'I forgot, I'll wash it later.'
‘Yes, he did. He wanted to meet again.’
'Yes. Teddy is getting really tall. I give it a year and he might be taller than me.'
There are muggles everywhere with these little papers with photographs, speaking German and offering it to me. I take them and nod, putting them in my pockets. One such woman even tries to make me step into a weird looking contraption with six wheels. I say ‘no, thank you’ and she switches to English, explaining but I say ‘no, thank you’ again until she finally lets me go with a frown and some murmur I don’t understand. In the meantime, Potter just watches us, arms crossed, smirking like an idiot.
'Thanks.'
His cheeks are wet, for some reason.
Instead, what I saw was Hogwarts. Just that. A castle, static, in the distance. Not that I don’t love Hogwarts, but I was a little disappointed. When I told George and Ron what I saw, they both frowned and said they’d look into it and do some adjustments. They would tell me when it’s ready so we can try again.
and it took me a while to figure out what he meant. I answered
‘Fat chance of that,’ Teddy snorts and a pea falls out of his mouth right back on his plate. ‘I will have more important work than cooking. I will be a seeker for the Falcons or Arrows.’
and I don't because it's special kind of torture for both of us. But I can tell, in few moments, I will give him what he wants, what I want too as a mean to an end. Then everything becomes harder and faster and he likes it, I like it just as much and I can't remember why we don't do this every day, every night.
I interrupt her. ‘It doesn’t matter I signed the fucking thing. What matters is that it is illegal.’
‘You’re not a pain, please keep badgering me.’ She slaps my shoulder with a laugh. ‘So do you know what is the big plan with the invisibility project?’ I nod towards where George, Ron and Lee are huddled on the sofa with my cloak in their laps, waving their wands over it from time to time.
'Yes, I will. He's one of the names.'
'Jesus, Malfoy. I can't stop missing you. Why?'
He makes a nonsensical sound and licks my chin, probably aiming for my lips but missing. I almost stop moving altogether when he finally speaks. 'Merlin, I can't believe you want me to stroke your ego right now when
'Yet they still lost. Hope better for next season. So you can reuse that scarf.'
'Yes yes, you're a hoot, indeed.'
They are so cute, especially like this, asleep, no screaming or crying or fighting.
, which was a mistake because he sat up between my legs, all contact lost and said
Auror Office
‘Do I honestly have to be this person the whole time here?’ he asks, inhaling loudly. ‘This cannot be good for my health. Six fucking days. Fuck.’
'Let's live together.'
Harry strides out towards the kitchenette at the end of the hall and hears her rushing after him. He wishes he would be a certified jerk. At least then he would be able to tell her he can’t put up with her anymore. Sucks being always polite.
'Never let her hear that.'
Potter sighs and presses his fingers on his temples. ‘Fine. I just wanted to know because you didn’t say or write anything. And I know how you love to write,’ he scowls.
I don’t care we’re in the middle of a crowd or whether anyone’s watching. I want to be kissing him until he says enough. And he doesn’t, thank goodness.
‘What happened to them?’ he gestures to himself, brown hair and eyes, red in face and a bit overweight.
'So?'
'Why should I be?'
'You're right, it doesn't.' I think he'd yell if we were alone. Maybe that's why we're not.
Harry’s voice is scratchy when he asks Malfoy again why exactly he’s there. “I was nearby and just wanted to make sure you were still breathing. It’s your turn to do the paperwork.”
'Someone has to accompany you there, it's the 90th level.'
'I need to know. I need to know why.'
Kind regards,
'We have to supervise them, no cuddling.'
Blaze Potions Ltd.
Harry considers pretending he doesn’t hear. But Ron does. He turns his head and stops. “Malfoy’s calling you,” he announces helpfully so Harry has to halt as well, because if he wouldn’t, then he’d just come out as an asshole.
'I don't want to argue either. Come here?'
We made it to some pub at Old Compton, I ordered beer, he ordered whiskey, I paid because technically I invited him. It was a bit strained at the beginning again, but after few sips his tongue loosened, and he wasn’t sneering as much.
'Never.'
'We have an emerency at work. I have to go to the Ministry. I wil try to make it there, okay?'
I told him when he sat up. He nodded and started to put on his clothes. I went downstairs and was drinking tea when he came in and announced
'Do you want me to stop?'
'Potter. I don't care. We will be sitting at the same table, next to each other. I want to match with my best friend.'
He grimaces and I think it might be a smile and then his eyes widen and there is pain on my chest, dull ache.
‘You do that,’ I yawn again and turn my head to the other side and cover myself with blanket.
'Kiss me then.'
'See?'
He was spelling the vitrines clean when I came in.
'Okay.'
'You didn't but it still happened, didn't it?' Yes. Now the anger is clear in his voice and eyes, too.
'I would never. Do you want to know what I like?'
‘I have no idea! But I know what it might look like, what at Luna’s and Parkinson’s, but none of it was done of my free will! First I was made to do it and second I was drunk.’ I stand up and steal one of the muffins.
I went to Andromeda’s yesterday, she wanted to visit a friend and asked me to babysit.
'Granger? Longbottom? Finnigan?'
'She didn't? Why?'
Thursday, I was babysitting Teddy and left there at 10pm and still went to the Manor and still kissed him before he pulled away.
‘They’re in custody,’ I answer.
'Oh my god. Yes.'
'I can bring you some outside.'
'No it's not. You're still young and you can work for yourself or something. You have choices, so many of them.'
Today I went to investigate a complaint about a shop in Knockturn Alley. I was totally shocked when I saw
So happy.
'Fine! I did because I want to help you or whatever you need... where are you going?'
“So, you had to just throw it here? My desk is not a bin.” Harry finally finds what he wants and glares at him. Malfoy smirks and flips him a finger. Harry wants to punch him and then hex him for good measure.
'What is with you? You're constantly mad. About every fucking little thing, you just want to argue. What's going on?'
‘You dumb asshole, Potter,’ he moans and I just cannot stand it any more, he’s standing up so I punch him in his stomach and I like seeing him fall down again.
'Oh my, what a word, Potter.'
'Yeah didn't have time to shave, will have to umph...'
So I guess I’m just gonna do that for a while.
'What?'
‘Prude or he thinks he’s in love again,’ Blaise points at me with his glass and watches me. My face is a mask. Then he grins. ‘Yeah, definitely the love thing. Remember, Pans, with Tim, at some point he was so secretive and then when he told us he loved him it just poured out of him?’
Malfoy leans closer and then straightens right back. ‘Looks lovely. What gave it the silver shimmer?’
‘I have enough of you, Malfoy!’ I turn around as he’s standing up yet again, push him into the nearest tree and pin him with my forearm on his chest. ‘What the fuck is your problem?’
‘You know, Potter, unlike you I decided to be civil and generous with you today. I don’t want to upset Andromeda or Teddy so I’ll just stand here and pretend it’s delicious. Feel free to go now.’
‘Whose owl is it?’ he asks before he leaves.
'That growling in your stomach says otherwise.'
'I'm not, I just want to dance with you.'
Harry Potter
“Now Draco has his tea, and we can talk.” Her smile is saccharine and eyes glint with something weird. If Harry would be five years old, he would stomp his foot and push her away. “So, tell me, Harry, would you like to show me some bars around here?”
she asked and hopped down. I said I came to see Malfoy. She leered and said
Deputy Office of Being Division
‘Don’t patronize me, you fucker!’ He points his wand at me, red sparks flying from the tip.
I just laugh, a pathetic uncomfortable sound.
Harry Potter
'No?'
Yesterday, we went for dinner instead of the park. It was a muggle restaurant and he paid.
'Do you want children?'
They smile at each other. ‘It was amazing, Harry. Thank you for baby sitting,’ Hermione says.
They end up under a roof. “Fucking hell,” Harry mutters and takes off his glasses.
We finish setting up the table and Andromeda goes outside to fetch Teddy when I hear a Floo in the sitting room. There are four plates on the table.
'You did.'
‘Look! Harry! Cool right?’ Teddy screams from above on his broom. He’s quite good on it, I must say. I made sure there were safety charms set on it on top of the ones it already came with. He’s about four meters high and thank god it cannot fly any higher because Teddy would definitely try.
'This is not funny.'
And he does come in and freezes when he sees us. ‘Er, I’m sorry, I’m clearly interrupting, I’ll come some other time.’
'I can't believe this. Fuck!'
'Yes.'
‘But when I’m older this broom will be too and a newer one will come,’ he sighs and finally unsticks his hands from the glass. ‘So you’re not going to buy it for me then?’
'Me too, but unless we will obliviate ourselves, we can't.'
'Then how...why...was it her?'
I think my eyes will fall out of my sockets when I see Pansy playing with the kids in the corner. All of them, Teddy included. They play cards of some sorts.
We watch each other in silence for a while. ‘I did. I don’t care if you believe me or not. I was a child and then grew up.’
Celeste Damian
, Parkinson’s voice saying
‘We’re not friends, Harry, we’re colleagues,’ Hermione amends, ‘but Ron’s right, I mean, taking in the account the closet incident and what I heard of Pansy’s Halloween party… very curious indeed.’
‘Yeah, a bit, make sure he can move on his own,’ she glares at me like it as me what made him sick.
'What are you doing?'
‘I know what your mother thinks. She’s a pureblood still, through and through. More… traditional? Old fashioned? I don’t know,’ she shrugs. ‘But Astoria is very nice. Just wanted you to know that I approve.’ She winks at me and I smile at her, nodding.
‘You are too, mate,’ Blaise smacks me bit harder this time, ‘that’s why we are still sticking together.’
Wednesday, I saved ten crups from the hands of smugglers, I went off on Davies for barging into my office without knocking, I interrogated a witness in our obliviation case and then I waited till Malfoy came home and took me to his bed.
‘I bet this is about Malfoy again,’ Ron says when he sits down next to me. Rose notices and decides to change people so I let her crawl to him.
I keep thinking about Robards and his stupid remarks about my competency and it’s not helping at all in this situation. But I really don’t like the man, stuck up in his old ways. At least Kingsley is on my side in this. He approved my proposal so fuck what Robards thinks. I honestly have to stop thinking about him.
, he pulled away, stood up with his hair all messy and said
'I don't care anymore. I'll go back, work, be out of your hair for most of the day and won't be wasting my days away.'
‘Thanks,’ I look at her and then cringe, ‘please don’t tell anyone.’
‘Told you,’ Blaise speaks, examining his nails.
‘Hello.’ I hear him before I even see him. He traipse through the door and  stops when he sees me.
I lube myself, my fingers and push in again until he's all warm and slick.
Once we are in the house, he closes himself in his room for the rest of the day and only walks out to drink and eat. He doesn’t speak to anyone, takes his food and goes back.
'So what's up with you, Malfoy?'
'Mhm,' he hums in my mouth, backing us towards his bedroom, only stopping kissing when walking up the stairs and resuming once off them.
'Hmpf... wait, wait, I do have a real present for you. Wait.'
He laughs. 'What a comeback, Potter.' I shrug, I don't care. 'So?'
'Good. I was at Gringotts.'
'No, I do. But one can last for a month or two, maybe longer. I would be away often.'
'Don't frown. You'll get more wrinkles than you already have. Besides, we have the whole evening before us. You get to touch me while dancing.'
I agree and, delightfully, see Potter frown even more. ‘Yes, indeed. Maybe when you’ll be older you will learn to cook it, too.’
Hermione Granger
‘Fuck.’I send out Protego and see the curses bounce away.
He would love to hit something right about now. Or someone. Preferably Malfoy.
He hums, his breath tickling my shoulder. He kisses me there and I stiffen because he’s awake sooner than I’d like him to be. He strokes my arm, my waist and stops on my stomach, petting there. He pushes his thigh higher, bent over my hip.
Celeste Damian
‘Technically you were flaunting it and I doubt she heard a lot, there are good silencing charms in my bedroom.’ She smirks and then continues: ‘I swear, Draco, I wasn’t talking about this to anyone, Blaise and Luna only. I didn’t tell anything to Ginny either, that must count for something, right?’
'Are you drunk that you want to dance?'
'Great. Just great.'
I stopped by at Hermione’s office to wish her a happy birthday and, also hinting, subtly, about my predicament: ‘
All breath catches in Harry’s lungs when Malfoy just puts them on Harry’s nose and hooks them gently behind his ears. Harry sees him clearly now, wet hair and rosy cheeks, rapt expression.
'Oh please, Draco, I know you. I missed our house warming and your birthday party in one!'
I am officially 21. I had a lovely dinner with my friends, I was given a very beautiful plant which name I’ve already forgotten from Neville, a flowery silk robe from Luna, 2 books from Hermione, Quidditch season tickets from Ron and he also brought a gift from Ginny – a bottle of Firewhiskey (don’t know what to think about it, whether it’s some dig at the whole crying and pleading with her when she was breaking my heart or she just forgot and sent the first thing she saw).
Blaze Potions Ltd.
'I don't know. I don't want to think about it now.'
‘Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing!’ he speeds up and then turns, balance a little off near the end and I hold my breath. But he does great, straightens the broom and flies up and down.
His hands give out and he falls on his elbows. He smells Malfoy’s hair – sweat and apples.
He kisses her back, a peck, small smile on his face.
'Yeah.'
I will let him.
Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures
'Yeah, it's me.'
'Every time I did we had a fight. I am tired of it. You always want to talk and then I do and then you just push and push and push!'
He shrugs. ‘All right. She will be taken care of, and you can pick her up only back in England. Come down at 6pm, we have to go over tomorrow’s meeting.’
I’m kind of looking forward to it. Might be strange at the beginning, but that’s to be expected – with our history...
'And you will be happy now? All bad things will dissappear?'
'That I will come but that you hate this sort of shit and rather  stayed home.'
'Good night.'
Auror Office
“How very forward, Potter,” Malfoy smirks but does as asked. Even though it’s not far, they stop every two seconds to continue kissing and touching.
‘Okay. Ha ha. We’re done here. Thank you so very much for all the info about possibly my most embarrassing night and now please, fuck off.’ I start hustling them away.
“But it’s fine if-“
So, I said that I was just trying to make Malfoy mad, I apologised and I said I would also apologise to Malfoy.
'Draco...'
'Git.'
'I love you.'
'I don't care. Do whatever you want.'
'Please do. So how are you holding up?'
‘Whose side are you on?’ I ask her. I've been asking her since Monday when she completely betrayed me and failed to see what’s so utterly wrong with this whole situation.
. I put a plate in front of him. After few bites he said ‘I’m sorry that I fell asleep’ and I told him it was fine.
‘So, we’re going back to work. If you need anything, we’re in the door at the end of the hallway,’ he smiles politely and then they leave the room.
'This. I want to be with you. Properly, not just fucking. I know you still don't trust me but I want to try and earn it back. If it's possible.'
'Oh, what a relief.'
‘Since you are already reading it, I hope I don’t have to explain my presence any further,’ he comes closer, turns few pages and points at the last line, ‘Bloodroot Poison. And I included a very in-depth examination, in case someone would have any objections to the result.’
Malfoy crosses one leg over the other and tsks. “Potter, so nice to see you’re alive.”
'Mhm.'
and I was hurrying back inside, finding Fleur so she could give her some food. I went to the kitchen then, where Molly fed me some more and absolutely refused my help with preparing trays of finger food.
‘Do you want to come home with us? I can show you how good I am with catching the new snitch.’ Teddy bites his cone and that’s when I realise my ice cream is spilling down my hand. I don’t even think about it when I start to lick it off. But what startles me is silence when Potter doesn’t answer. So I abandon my current action and see him how he’s giving me some sort of a side eye. Merlin, his face looks very punchable right now.
'Are you sure?'
'Nice. And?'
Kind regards,
She kisses him.
Harry doesn’t notice when they start to move towards the bed. He only knows one minute he’s standing, the next he’s on his back, on the soft blue sheets. Malfoy lays on top of him, their cocks nestled between them, sliding slick together. Malfoy must have conjured lube – Harry smells coconut and some fruit and he has to smile.
'Let's go to bed.' I murmur, I want to take him slow and comfortable, on his nice smelling sheets and soft pillows.

'You can look any time you want.'
‘In fact, I’m your first cousin once removed, it is more than possible you have other cousins, for example…’
my coat. ‘
(and I just kept talking) ‘
He’s slipping.
'Good. Andromeda said Teddy walks him almost every hour. He'll be so spoiled when we come back.'
‘I don’t think you want the details, but if you’re truly interested, she is…’
'Hot date?'
‘But I do treat you as I always do, I don’t…’
‘You’re the one to talk, Potter,’ I sneer because I can’t help myself. ‘You can barely stay with me until the sunrise, in most cases. So excuse
‘This just shows how bad you handle losing, Potter.’
'I don't but he asked very nicely and I was too drunk and said yes, so. I am polite and am not going to cancel last minute.'
The woman’s hand is now in the man’s lap. ‘You’re in luck. I am Jacoby.’
‘Merlin, there are more! Look, in that corridor, there near the window.’
‘All right,’ she leans down and kisses his head, ‘I might still read a little. Good night.’
I roll my eyes. ‘Why not?’
‘Thank you, of course! I was joking, Jesus.’ I take the last page and put it inside the official file. Malfoy is already outside so I catch up with him. ‘Did you hear me?’
'All warm and slippery and hard.'
he said.
'Is it Weasley's?'
'I don't know, it's weird. You never do it unless I make you and suddenly a garden needs pampering and you come running. Should I turn into a garden?'
'It is, yes. But can it be planted this time of year?'
He stills. ‘You do realise, you imbecile, that you are holding my hand? Release it right this second.’
'You are. Look, Bono agrees.'
'Okay, yes...'
I straddle his legs and take his hand away from his cock, lean down and lick him. I kiss along the length and then suck him in. I love how he feels in my mouth, hot and heavy and hard. I hum around him and his fingers bury in my hair, gripping tight and painful. He thrusts his hips up once, twice and I taste his release on my tongue.
'Can I ask you something.'
'Draco?'
'I love how your skin caught some sun here. Pretty.'
‘Okay,’ I exhale but don’t look at him. ‘The other day I hooked up with this guy,’ I glance at him, ‘and we… had sex, as you do, and we were both pretty drunk… and he gave me some muggle pill also… and then we met for a second time, got drunk again, he took the pill again which that time I refused so he was much worse than I. We had sex that time too.’ I stop here and look at him. He’s trying really hard not to put his hands over his ears, I can tell.
“Yeah, I’m fine. Why?” Harry manages to look at Ron instead of the couple, and smile.
‘Hey, Malfoy!’ he looks at me, his hair now pale blond and his face a weird, distorted mix. ‘Good job!’
, someone else can go next time, it’s not like I want to go myself – then Ginny sent me a t-shirt she packed by mistake and then decided to send it to me when she realised it was mine, so I smelled it and it was her all over it, so I threw it into the bin, took it out and washed it.
‘You think you’re too good for me, Potter? Too perfect? Do you?’ he hisses at me. ‘I tell you, you are not,’ he leans closer, ‘you are not. Someone might be, but not you,’ he finishes and then burps right in my face. His eyes widen even more, he releases my shirt and covers his mouth. ‘Fuck, sorry,’ he blurts out, muffled. And then it’s like he suddenly realises who is standing in front of him, uncovers his mouth and sneers: ‘No, I’m not sorry. You had it coming, if I’d want to,’ another burp, ‘I’d throw…’ and he propels forward and achieves throwing up in the toilet. I don’t have time to react, to decide if I should stay and help him somehow or just leave or laugh at the whole ridiculousness of the situation, when there are some voices in the hallway.
‘Wow, you’re no fun today,’ Blaise sighs and plops himself on my work table. ‘You drank a lot as we already established, Potter drank a lot also, you almost got into a fist fight with him but someone – and by that I mean me – was sober enough to intervene. Then you drank more and by midnight you were all chummy, talking. I mean, granted, you screamed at each other, but funnily enough not all of it were insults.’
It is lovely. It fascinates me how something so muggle can be so beautiful. I never thought I would admire an unmoving painting by muggles. Art that is clearly not magical but still incredible.
'What? You said I would, now you don't believe it anymore?'
‘Don’t be stupid, Harry,’ Andromeda says a little exasperated, ‘you’re always welcome here. Sit and I’ll bring you a pie and tea.’ She leaves to the kitchen. Finally Teddy notices him, runs and starts showing off his catching skills. ‘Amazing Teddy, you’re getting better,’ Potter says and then addresses my mother. ‘Good afternoon, misses Malfoy,’ he reluctantly looks at me and only says ‘Malfoy’ like it’s a hello enough. ‘How are you?’ He asks her, clearly suffering, judging by his pinched expression.
‘Don’t know, we’ll find out.’ We start walking to the corner shop to apparate, Malfoy stomping heavily next to me.
'Come on! You already have everything. If you won't tell me you'll end up with a notebook.'
‘If you’re talking about the game…’
'No! Stop! Alright here, have it all, what do I care. Alright, Potter. I fed your animal now go buy me another sandwich!'
He didn’t say anything else, so I started speaking about the mission, and how cold Sweden is even in summer and Davies and the tent and the vase and flowers I bought and the Grimmauld and the renovation and, somehow, he was suddenly closing and we were walking and I was still talking.
'Jesus, I don't want to fight either, I was just asking.'
and I didn’t finish because he was back, murmuring
'Looking for a good position. It's only four, I'm not getting up yet. Maybe like this... Jesus, you're warm.'
'Okay.'
‘Merlin, so good...’
'How did that even come up?'
'And aren't you afraid that some of your lingering feelings will reappear?'
I pass Grouse’s desk and deliver the message. ‘Denis, Robards wants to speak with you in his office.’
‘A consultant you say? The first I am hearing of this title. Did you just decide to bestow it upon me? Will I get a raise?’
‘You are both so heartless! I am about to break up with my girlfriend and all you care about,’ she points her finger at Blaise, ‘is my negligible amount of tears I shed when you came and you,’ she points at me, ‘just want to get your dick wet!’
'Wonderful, now go to bed, we'll be back soon.'
He feels the sensation as Malfoy whispers several incantations, loosely holding his wand and then discarding it again.
‘No!’
But this – this is torture.
'No, don't. That's fine. However long you need. Whatever you need to do.'

“Is that when you didn’t want her anymore? When she said it?”
'Yeah,' he breathes and his finger dispappears and becomes two.
'And do what?'
‘Nice to meet you,’ she says with a pleasant smile.
'Oi!' Ron says affronted. 'I am a fan, not in love!'
'Okay?'
I went back to get Ron, we had lunch and then I went back to work, arrested one wizard for public indecency and at the end of the day, went straight home.
I sighed, kissed his ear and he started on my flies just as I began to push his tunic (or whatever that was what he was wearing under the robes) off and I honestly thought that we were going to wank each other off (for the second time since we started this), right then and there, my pants were already pushed low, and his hand was on me, moving so slowly, there was a door opening and
I’m waiting here everyday after work. I want to know immediately if he wakes up or dies. I need to know to figure out what to do next. Astoria says they can’t do anything. Blaise says I am being dramatic. Pansy says I look awful. There was nothing in the contract regarding something similar, but who knows what the Ministry will come up with to annihilate me.

‘I’m sorry I came without telling you first, but I was in the neighbourhood so I though I’d stop by?’
I freeze as though he just pushed my head under an ice cold water.
He grabs my thighs and turns us around, pinning me down and I grin at him, reaching up, wanting to kiss him some more. He lets me, for a bit, then he puts his cheek next to mine and I can barely hear him through the pounding of my blood when he whispers
I watch him crossing the road and disappearing behind a corner.
Harry likes exercising. Running, weights, swimming. The best about them is that he never ever does them with Malfoy. He’s blessedly alone, able to focus.
Poor Hermione doesn’t catch the sarcasm. ‘Really? How lovely you’re finally trying to be friendly with each other,’ she says distractedly while turning back to her mound of books sitting precariously on a coffee table.
A sigh, and it turned soft and warm.
'I'm sorry. I couldn't lie to you anymore, I was...'
He dries his hands and Andromeda wipes some dirt from his cheek. ‘It will be dark then, Teddy, and you still didn’t finish your homework.’  Teddy groans. ‘Now that we’re all here, let’s sit down and eat.’
They look just as sweet as when he was living them.
Kind regards,
'Yeah, gorgeous.'
‘Congrats. I hope Ron didn’t hex anyone. Sometimes he can be a sore loser,’ she smiles.
'I am trying but it's not like you can snap your fingers and everything is right again. This is hard for me, harder than I expected. To trust you again.'
'Hey! I'm home.'
'I did not. I tried to help and yeah, maybe I snapped from time to time, but not because I resent you! I hated I couldn't help you. But this is not a solution.'
He wakes up gasping but calm.
First work - the paperwork is seriously getting ridiculous -, Malfoy – another complaint, the same thing, and he keeps grating on my nerves and this time he even
'That's a wonderful present, Harry. Thank you.'
'Use mine.'
Teddy jumps up and lets his snitch fly away in the process. I see in my peripheral Andromeda and Narcissa turning to look at us. ‘Super! I can’t wait! Let’s see, next weekend my friend Alex and I have a sleepover but the next? Yay!’ he runs towards Andromeda and asks her if they can invite all of them to play a game.
'He'll be a great chaser.'
‘You cannot send or receive any correspondence, Mlafoy, it was clearly stated in the contract,’ Potter frowns and crosses his arms on his chest.
'What are you doing here?'
Draco L. Malfoy
But who cares about
'Are you serious?'
. What the fuck? Three hundred?  No responsibility? And I am not talking about all the other nonsense regarding losing a limb or any other body parts!’

'You are over thirty yet you behave like a child.'
'Really? Good for you then.'
We talked while we walked, until we reached the park again and sat on a bench right under a lamp and he was talking about a potion book that
'So what are you going to do?'
'That you know? No. Just, don't tell anyone. I really want her to be happy.'
hands?'
'Are you doing it?'
'I really don't, I just tolerate it.'
Malfoy bites on his bottom lip so harshly Harry tastes blood. He lets go of Harry’s cock and puts both of his hands on Harry’s arse. He grabs the cheeks, nails digging in the muscles and Harry likes the idea of being marked in the morning. Malfoy squeezes few times, spreads them and pushes them back. Then he fucks so hard inside Harry that he has to catch himself from falling over. But Malfoy holds him, guides him on his cock, faster and faster, ramming his prostate each time. Harry’s cock brushes against his torso and Malfoy’s mouth latches on Harry’s throat.
Now that I think about it, maybe this is not my best idea. In all likelihood, I am
'It might erase the hate.'
'I noticed you don't talk about it much nowadays.'
Am I an asshole? I don’t think so, I’m just doing what’s right and he behaves very suspiciously, with all the straight posture and that gleaming (slightly wavy) hair of his and those sneers and smirks… he’s odd and suspicious and a Death Eater and I am doing the right thing!
Draco L. Malfoy
'Alright.'
‘Aren’t I? I distinctly remember being in favour of the training snitch. But no. You had to strut over and brandish your very own. I bet you thought you’d win with it. Did you rig it?’
he said when he was locking up. I asked what he meant, and he told me
'I'm going to do the dishes so it won't bother you when you come back since I didn't do them yesterday and the day before. And we're not sleeping in one bed today. I cannot stand you right now.'
'Merlin, Potter, you're pathetic. Look at you, still pining after her.'
'Mhm. So, what would you like?'
‘They wanted to wait for you, not seeing you all day?’ Ron offers.
She looked angry and cold. When I saw that she saw I tried to explain but I think I only mumbled something incomprehensible and left.
Draco L. Malfoy
'Better than the shampoo?'
Every way possible. “How do you want me?”
I even bite my tongue but it’s not stopping me from blurting out: ‘On what?’
‘Fuck. Okay. We just leave as we came in.’
and I just stared at him for few seconds and then I thought,
'Harry, please...'
I grin and wrap my fingers around him. 'Better?' I breathe in his ear, feel him shiver, I kiss his jaw, chin and lift him up with me, to his hands and knees. I hold his hip with one hand and stroke him with the other.
‘Why?’ I ask and shake my head. ‘I told them we both fought against them.’
I lie on the beach just as Timothy is getting ready to scuba dive, the instructor is checking his equipment, if it sits correctly, if there’s enough oxygen. He waves at me. I tried it with him the first day here and I have more than enough for my whole life. I felt so… pressed, so claustrophobic, so I refused to do it again. I wave back at him, sun is shining on his wet, glistening body. He looks so good, his skin went beautiful brown from the sun, whereas mine just stays as it is. I know if I wouldn’t use lotions I would be just red.
I am alone. So alone in this.
'Where is it?'
All the best,
'Which then?' I moan, he brushes my prostate at every other stroke.
Blaise thinks and then answers: ‘No, I liked him. We weren’t best of friends, but he was tolerable.’
'Yeah... I didn't want to.'
'Yeah.'
Draco L. Malfoy
'Sure.'
'Appears so. Wow.'
'You know I hate it when you sit on me like this, you are poking me everywhere.'
‘No. I want to go outside,’ I repeat, step closer and because I’m irritated and tired as well, I rip off the blanket and throw it on the floor.
'Let's not think about it any more.'
‘I might have,’ I murmur, ‘the more the better.’
'Him. I got him about two weeks after you suggested it.'
'Yeah.'
'On every piece of furniture?'
This morning I sent him an owl, if he was busy or if he wanted to hang out. He wrote back ten minutes ago,
'Who?'
‘Don’t be patronising, Pansy!’ I yell and that’s when Weasley appears from behind her.
‘You should’ve seen him today, you wouldn’t call him that,’ Ron mumbles when he stands. They kiss hello, Hermione kisses Rose on her forehead and sits at his place, ready to feed Hugo. ‘Can you make me tea, Ron, please?’
'Harry?'
'Yes he did.'
'Yeah, but I was talking to Neville and he liked my ideas so we changed it a bit.'
He steps closer, letting his arms fall by his sides. He’s holding his wand. ‘Malfoy. You’re lucky none other than me saw the owl. You and all of this mission would be put at risk if someone was to expose the whole thing. Mainly you, however.’
‘Yes, I really did. Do you think we could talk more about it? I don’t think I can focus very much right now, I am a little tipsy,’ she giggles.
'Did he really?'
'It happened. Yes, sometimes it comes up in my mind and yours too. And that's okay because here we are now, I hope stronger than before. I trust you that you won't break my heart like it anymore.'
to the already closed door and out of spite stood there for about fifteen minutes before going home.
He goes home.
“Harry,” Malfoy murmurs his name and Harry’s breath catches for a second, “I’m close.”
‘I see none of my clothes passed. Well. Bit disappointing but I might survive.’ He walks up to me, hooks his fingers in the belt loops and yanks me forward, presses his mouth on mine. ‘You look fresh. Come, I’m making breakfast.’
He stands up and brings it to me with a deceivingly innocent smile. ‘Here you go, Malfoy. I baked this one.’ I grimace at that and I’d rather throw it away. He remains standing next to me and keeps smirking. ‘Come on, eat up, enjoy.’
'Potter, you know your style is atrocious.'
'Yeah, maybe.'
I just got back from a four-day mission with Davies. I was being punished for going to Kingsley and demanding for the Knockturn patrol to be cancelled, that’s the only explanation. Otherwise, why would Robards sent me to Swedish woods to track Mooncalf smugglers with fucking Davies? We were living in a tent, no heating, smelling like sweat and eggs, with Davies complaining constantly. We barely managed to catch them because he was just whining about how hungry he was.
'Okay. I will miss you.'
'Later, husband dear!'
Blaze Potions Ltd.
Turned out he was right. When Jonson went to investigate, they found some potions in her basement, she was keeping under-the-counter business, banned brews.
Malfoy snorts and looks around. ‘At least it’s nice here.’
Truth is, Harry wanted to give him something on his last birthday. It was few weeks after Harry got out of the hospital and started to have these uncomfortable feelings. He saw an ancient, cursed potion’s book, exactly the thing Malfoy would love. Harry bought it, wrapped it up. He went to Malfoy’s party where he saw him being very fond of a hired waiter. So, he kept the book and shoved it back in the drawer of his nightstand. They were not the sort of colleagues who would give each other presents, anyway.
I look around and hate how his room is bigger and better and sunnier than mine.
'Did she ever, after... did she still flirt?'
I tried to save it but didn’t know how.
‘I can be a test subject,’ I tell her.
This morning, Malfoy came to the DMLE offices to make a complaint about the witch that keeps complaining about him. Jonson told me when I saw Malfoy leaving her office in a strop, so I asked her and she said he suspects the witch is selling some illegal potions.
He follows me inside and when I’m taking off my outer robes he starts. ‘So how was yesterday?’
and I didn’t know what else I could do, other than nod and leave.
‘Next time we’ll beat them,’ he says as he takes his hat off.
'I know something's happening but I'm not sure what and why. Is this about moving in together? Because you said you wanted to. Did I make you do it or something?'
'We had a big arrest, quite unexpected, I wasn't even supposed to be there but there were some minor complications so I had to.'
'About two weeks ago. We should have him over. Andromeda too.'
But still. I haven’t seen him for couple years and suddenly here he is, playing with curses. So I asked this as well to which he said
‘Yeah you too.’ We stand there for a moment, he’s in the door frame, not moving. ‘Do you want to use the bathroom?’ I ask finally and he smirks. Or I guess it’s supposed to be a smirk, it’s all wobbly in his drunken state.
‘Very fun, can’t wait. Should I bring you another?’ I gesture to her almost empty glass.
Ministry of Magic
‘Wonderful. Here,’ I take out the pouch with the agreed sum of five thousand galleons. ‘We have the money, so maybe we could see the merchandise now?’
I’ve been here for an hour now. Healers came and went, no news. They don’t tell me anything, because I’m not family and when I said I’m his friend they practically laughed in my face. I only overheard the information about waking him up the other day when Weasley was here, talking to the healer as I was standing behind a corner.
‘Merlin, Potter, you’ll catch a fly. Shut your mouth.’
'It's still in the shower.'
'Like what?'
he asked as we were walking towards the Leaky.
‘Did you change? Did you really or are you just good at pretending you did?’
“You look constipated.”
I can’t see anyone from my team, I can’t see Malfoy either. I start sending hexes. I see Jacoby being escorted away, huddled between men and women. I wish I could take them down, but I must find Malfoy, no matter what.
'I can't do this anymore, Harry.'
'Yeah.'
'What? It will help us get back to sleep.'
‘Yeah, alright. I don’t want to be a pain, I’ll leave it be then.’
Harry starts a slow rock back and forth with his hands planted on Malfoy’s abdomen. “Don’t move yet.” Harry breathes deeply and Malfoy nods, sliding his hands up and down Harry’s legs.
I spent today with Teddy and Andromeda, and very innocently inquired about Malfoy. She said he visited last Saturday. Played with Teddy. (And now that I think about it, he probably mentioned it Friday when my mind was foggy.)
“No, I like it,” he whimpers, and he cannot continue because Malfoy tightens his fingers at the top and Harry’s hips drive into it.
Draco L. Malfoy
‘You'll know better next time. And if it means anything to you,’ Ron continues, ‘I don’t think you did anything wrong. You shouldn’t punish yourself for it. You ended it, after all, and now you can move on. And if you still need to talk to an adult, we still have Mione.’ He claps me on the shoulder and I laugh.
‘You understand nothing!’ he yells to my face and slaps the file I sent him in front of me, turning few pages and pointing his finger on a particular line and reads out loud. ‘
It feels like drowning.
‘If I’d rigged it I wouldn’t be here looking for it would I, you idiot?’
'How is Bono?'
Party was good, not too many people, just Weasleys and my closest friends and their friends. Towards the end, when the cake was half-eaten and gifts unwrapped, Molly, of all people, played a matchmaker as she introduced me to a woman – Celia.
'I have to...'
My friends are still Ginny’s friends.
I said I just found a cursed box and he was running a shop for cursed objects.
I floo home and curse Potter in my mind the whole time it takes to walk to my bedroom.
'Maybe. But only at the beginning. I know you much better than three years ago. You wouldn't move in with me if you were. So?'
'Jesus, you're unbearable. I'm going to cook pasta, do you want some?'
‘God. Let’s go,’ he exhales, pulling me behind him. I follow, close to his back. I kiss his nape and he laughs. He takes me into his bedroom, closes the door and watches me, leaning against it.
