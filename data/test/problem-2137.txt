Harry licked his lips in anticipation. “They are the ones you wear in the pictures,” he whispered, his gaze stuck on the intricate lace.
And it was not for lack of trying; ever since Draco came back into his life a couple of years before, Harry had done everything in his power to establish and maintain a civil relationship with him, thanks to Neville crossing over to the dark side to date Blaise Zabini. Not that Harry could blame him, he had eyes too after all, but Draco made it almost impossible for them to get along, with his snarky remarks and rolled eyes. Rather childish, all things considered, especially when Harry winking or smiling at him was enough to get him all flustered.
“So,” Malfoy said after a moment. “You never told me what made you come to the set today.”
Harry blanked. He had fantasized about it quite a lot, but he had never really explored any option other than the one Draco suggested.
“You like them?” Draco teased him. Not trusting his own voice, Harry slowly nodded without lifting his eyes.
He ran his hands over his chest, his stomach and down to his belly; Harry took in a sharp breath when they brushed against his cock, but Draco moved them on his hips, pulling him closer to the edge of the table.
“I mean – ” he swallowed. Draco's silence wasn't helping.
Draco ran his finger through his dark air, nibbling at the soft skin of his neck. He was tender and careful with Harry's body, changing his pace to indulge his needs.
Harry's grin grew wider. “That sounds promising.”
“We are in a bathroom!” Harry said, watching the other man close the door behind them and go sit inside the huge ceramic bathtub.
He turned hearing Ron clear his throat.
He raised his eyebrows, biting on his lips as he took a step back. Harry frowned, but his pout melted into a smirk as soon as Draco began unbuttoning his own shirt, letting it slide along his arms and onto the floor. His belt hissed when Draco tugged it out of its loops.
“That’d be nice,” Draco said, his tone so plain and polite like they were exchanging pleasantries all of a sudden, but the glance he shot him stirred up the fire in Harry’s belly.
He wished he could do more for them, like stand up and give a heartfelt speech to encourage donations, but the idea gave him cold sweat, so he ate his dinner silently praying nobody would come bother him.
“It’s getting late,” he said, “are you guys staying the night?”
Harry snorted at the comment, impressed by the nonchalance Draco cut through the crowd with, ignoring the protests and dirty looks he got from the people around them.
His words dragged Harry over his limit. Swallowing the saliva in his mouth, he stroked the sheets with his fingertips, riding the surge of his orgasm.
He picked up a few daisies to stop his fingers from trembling as reality daunted on him. He was falling for Draco Malfoy, hard and fast, and he was powerless to stop it, he didn't want to stop it.
“Back to last names already, aren't we?” Harry flicked his eyebrows, leaning in to stop what was surely some colorful profanity from coming out of Draco's mouth. He kissed him, eyes wide open to be able to spot any Hex coming his way.
“No, I – ” Draco licked his lips, too late to stop the words from slipping out, his nonchalant attitude fading for a moment.
Harry brushed his fingers to the pictures in his pocket, the only positive note of the evening. Consumed by curiosity, he wondered if he had the time to find the bathroom and take a quick peek of the image, but that would have meant walking through the room, in front of everybody, all alone, as he couldn't ask Ron to go with him.
Taking care of his garden always put him in the best of moods; he couldn't help but smile at the ripe strawberries, sure Molly would turn them in the most delicious jam. Harry could already taste one of her pies in his mouth.
Before Harry could make any comment, Malfoy had closed the bathroom door behind his back, leaving him leaning against the sink, arms folded on his chest, wondering which of his words had bothered him so much. Plenty images of Malfoy
Following his devilish look, Draco ran his fingertips all over his thighs, igniting sparkles wherever he touched. He jerked up to meet Harry halfway before he could bend to kiss him again.
“Use your saliva for that, too.”
“ – your work. Great improvement, it’s amazing…”
“I've never tried it, but it does sound interesting,” Harry replied warily. “Is this making you uncomfortable?”
Harry sighed, wiping the sweat on his forehead with the back of his sleeve. Three weeks before he had accepted Callum’s invitation to conclude their date at his place. He couldn’t have known back then that his nod would mean the beginning of the end. Melodramatic? Maybe, but their newborn relationship died then and there for sure.
He drank the whole champagne glass in his hand, peeking around the ballroom, full of colorfully-dressed people, chatting away and, from where he was standing, having a good time.
Harry chewed on his lip, shooting Malfoy a quick glance. The man was staring back at him, lips pressed together and knitted eyebrows. He lowered his gaze on the bottle.
Harry still hadn’t recovered from the shock of Draco Malfoy having social media profiles, but the pictures, the interviews and the videos were all over the internet for everybody to see.
“Well, I can hardly blame them, and things are getting better. My mail hasn't burst into flames in a while now.” Draco's lips curled up at his attempted humor, but there was still a bitterness in his voice to undermine it.
Soon out of breath, Harry ran his fingers through Draco's hair, leaving soft kisses on his lips and cheeks. Draco blushed, but kept coming back for more, tilting his head and turning his face to offer him new spots to kiss.
Hermione rolled her eyes, careful not to let Robards see her, before excusing herself from the table.
Harry closed his eyes once again as he let out a slow sigh, but Malfoy’s dick rubbing against his ass shook him up right when he was falling back to sleep. He bit his lips to stop himself from chuckling in frustration. Using his elbow, he tried to push Malfoy away, but that only made him hold on to Harry tighter.
“Wow,” Harry whispered. He felt the bitterness in Draco's voice, but they were in public, so he didn't dare do anything to reassure him.
“I feel asleep, didn’t I?” Malfoy looked so distraught Harry couldn’t help but chuckle.
“Congratulations?”
“I tried, you know? I went to funerals and functions and memorials. I got back with Ginny and told myself things were fine. I was fine.”
Harry held his breath for a moment feeling the fingers back in his hair, but Malfoy chose to be gentler this time, caressing his head and playing with the unruly locks.
He left a kiss on Draco's chin, and he arched his eyebrow in response. Judging by the expression on his face, Draco grabbing his ass did not surprise him at all. He rubbed himself against Harry, holding him still to create more friction. A quick sigh left Harry's lips.
His first reaction was an amused snort as his gaze fell on a beautiful, white Persian cat elegantly laying on a bed and staring right at the camera. Looking at those incredible eyes, Harry understood why Draco would give his cat such an unconventional name.
Harry did take a peek or two, he was only human after all. And he was trying to remember if he had such a nice arse at Hogwarts, so he needed to check.
“What?” he spat, his tone harsher than he intended.
The auction finally ended and dessert was served.
“I guess I did dodge a nasty Hex there,” he said instead, hoping it would bring the conversation back to a more casual tone.
He put the envelope in his pocket without even peeking at it, too nervous to open it right away.
“You look so delicious in those robes I could eat you right here.”
“We can stay longer if you want to,” Harry said. If Draco could do it, he didn't see why he couldn't, also, this being a Muggle place, the chance someone would recognise and bother him were close to none.
“He shot my first portfolio, I’ll give him that, but I worked my ass off to get where I am, and I did it on my own,” Malfoy finished his rant with a sigh, shaking his head as he took a turn down a staircase leading to the gardens.
He didn’t know how much time had passed when the feeling of Malfoy’s fingers digging under his shirt to run on his stomach woke him up.
Draco stood up, but didn't walk away. Instead, he casually leaned in. “The other night was nice, let me know when you are free for a second date.”
“Really?” he whispered, his lips tugged in a grin, “Is this really enough? Don't you want something more?”
“I guess I just wanted an excuse to spend some time with you, I didn't think – ” the smirk was back on his face, but his eyes were still dense with concern for him. Harry gave him his best smile, but he feared he came out looking more like a sour face.
Harry flinched. He hadn’t been called that in years, and now it whipped him in the face.
Malfoy brought the bottle with him as he led Harry back into the main hall. Shooting around closed-lipped smiles, he followed, doing his best to stop his gaze from slipping down on Malfoy’s arse, nicely wrapped in a pair of tight jeans.
“You did,” Draco agreed, shooting him a quick glance before checking the time on his wrist.
Harry gritted his teeth, damn Malfoy and his vague answers. “I guess you gotta play nice, with him making you famous and all – ” Harry held his breath, waiting for a reaction. Which didn’t take long.
“Mmh – I don’t think it’s the roses.”
“That’s not – you know what? Never mind, he left, we can get out of here.”
Harry took in a sharp breath. Of course Malfoy was talking about sleeping arrangements, but he felt something hidden underneath his words that made him feel weak.
He swallowed the lump in his throat, sheepishly smiling as an apology.
Harry waited for Malfoy and Pansy to nod before smiling and accepting Neville’s invitation.
Sitting on the couch with Draco, he ran his fingers through his blond hair, soft and silky despite the sweat.
“It's fine,” he then added lifting his hand to stop Harry's response. “Not like I was dying to come in the first place – ”
“You'll see,” he said standing up.
Draco tilted his head, shooting him a long, lingering look.
Harry dried the sweat on his forehead with the back of his arm, taking off his soiled gloves to plunge them into the basket with the tomatoes and a couple of zucchinis.
“They do that sometimes,” Ron shrugged, “they are not
“They are not bad, just... I don't know, it's good it's over.”
Malfoy stopped a few inches away from him, lips parted in a smirk, eyes darkening by the second.
“And how is he? Once you know him, I mean,” Harry insisted only to be cut off by a head shaking Malfoy.
Harry peeked at Draco, who was dabbing his fingers against the paper glass, his gaze low and cheeks flushed. He smiled.
He slowly nodded. “I did.”
Draco laid beside, wearing what looked like an old comfy t-shirt that bared one of his shoulders and his collar bones, and, from the shooting angle, nothing else as Draco's naked thighs extended to the corner of the picture up until his knees to disappear out of the frame.
“Nothing, just... that’s an ugly Christmas tree, I was wondering how I didn’t notice before.”
Eyebrows knitted in a confused expression, Harry turned the picture.
“Draco.” Harry chuckled. Said out loud, the name rolled out even better, it fit that it forced his mouth in a pout, and that thought made him laugh even more.
Wrinkling his nose, Harry snorted, surprised Malfoy could actually be funny.
Harry raised his eyebrows, but that was all the reaction he allowed himself. After all, Draco held on tightly to his pride, and there was only so much scratching at it he would tolerate before snapping.
“Fuck,” Harry growled, arching his back, digging his fingers into the frost white wool of the carpet, sure his eyes just rolled in his head. He barely felt Draco biting down on his shoulder, as his whole body was on fire, waves of pleasure irradiating through his body, leaving him breathless and quivering.
Harry drank his Butterbeer, laughing at their stories and enjoying the quick Slytherin banter, much more bearable when it wasn’t used against him.
Would he still care had he got what he wanted? Harry sighed. Probably not.
“No, I was just…” Harry tried; he sighed, looking for a way to put the thoughts swarming in his mind into words.
True to his words, Draco hadn't bothered putting his clothes back on; the light from the fireplace danced on his porcelain skin, gentle caresses smoothing the edges in his figure, as he stood in front of the tree. The ornament in his hand caught a glimpse of light, casting a rainbow onto the wooden floor.
He lowered his head to brush his lips with Draco's.
Harry gave up resting, carefully turning to face the sleeping beauty by his side. He wondered if Malfoy knew how long his lashes were. He probably did.
He smiled feeling Draco kiss the top of his head, and brushed his chin over his chest in response.
dumped
“Wait,” he frowned, “so you think I'm - pretty?”
“And I'm telling you now because I think you need to hear it. Not all of us are attracted to
Half an hour later they were standing near the lake in deep silence, Harry staring far into the distance, admiring the beautiful view in front of them. The wind had fully stopped after Harry had been flying and the surface of the lake was now still like a mirror. It was a very peaceful sight.
He stood there for a long time, just watching, relaxing, until he finally turned his head to the side. "Such a..." He was abashed to see that instead of the lake, Malfoy's eyes were resting on... him. Harry's heart skipped a beat in his chest. Malfoy quickly looked away.
Harry spent quite a long time at breakfast table with his friends, listening to Hermione and Ron debating about their Hogsmeade plans for the evening, but not taking any part in it. No, his thoughts were on different matters. From time to time his gaze kept wandering back to the Slytherin table, always finding Malfoy and Goyle missing. He couldn't help feeling worried. Why wasn't Malfoy coming to breakfast at all? He had been pretty drunk last night… but he
was happening to him? It had to be acknowledged that Draco Malfoy had definitely always caused very strong feelings in him. Hate, disgust, rage... But never anything like
He barely even managed to finish his sentence before Draco had already rolled them around, immediately taking the reins. Harry ended up lying on his back on the bed as Draco was above, riding him senseless.
"Uh...", Harry started, not knowing how he should say it. "Actually, I'm not going with Ginny." He paused. "I'm going with Malfoy."
He was browsing through the different TV channels but didn't find anything interesting to watch so he ended up with some action movie. It wasn't his style of choice but since there wasn't anything better either, he had to settle for it.
Draco said quietly. His face became serious and his eyes followed as Harry finished buttoning up his coat.
"Working as an Auror is not for me", Harry said. "I'm done with chasing dark witches and wizards, and risking my life. Besides, I have already done my part in saving the world, don't you agree?"
Harry's blood was still boiling, nearly everyone's eyes resting on him. Not like he cared about it at all, however, he was used to it. He was the boy-who-lived, after all, so he always had eyes on him.
not pleased about it.
doing here? He could not stay here, not even for a minute longer. This wasn't right, this was wrong. The flashbacks from last night suddenly got him feeling sick in his stomach.
With another heavy sigh and tears burning in his eyes he kept walking towards their dormitories. Theodore soon followed right after.
not gay."
. Malfoy was not the kind of person to apologize for anything at all. He had always been a cunning, unrepentant boy.
"Have you talked to Ginny yet?" Hermione asked all of a sudden, a little louder than before, waking Harry from his thoughts.
"I just... Are you ok?" Harry asked.
Harry trembled and his heart skipped a beat. Malfoy had whispered his name in his sleep. Harry's lips turned to a smile. He knew where they were, he knew they might get caught lying here in each others arms, but at the moment he couldn't care less. Everything he wanted was here in his arms.
how that made me feel, Harry."
Harry shrugged his shoulders. "I don't know", he sighed, taking a more comfortable posture on the couch, leaning his head back. "But I wouldn't be even surprised if she did."
In the end they both saw the Snitch at the very same time and soon they were flying very close to each other, side by side, each trying to reach it first. It reminded Harry of one of their quidditch matches many years ago.
long he had waited for this and now he was here, kissing and holding the man he had been dreaming of…
Harry cleared his throat. "Umm, it's just that... Many students here are treating him very, very badly."
"I've heard that too", Draco said, finally letting go of him. "I've also heard that you've inherited your personality from him."
that you won't get any help from me from now on. If you hurt him, you're on your own", Theodore said.
"Better late than never, right?" Harry asked. Malfoy lifted his gaze and their eyes met again.
", Harry said quietly. "It's me. I just... I just can't do this. I really am sorry."
It was almost like another dream. The Slytherin was clutching hard onto Harry's back, his long legs wrapped around his waist, moaning somewhere in between intense pleasure and pain.
"No, Harry. You were supposed to tell them today but you didn't!" Draco snapped.
he muttered. There was a bitter tone in the way he said that.
Harry felt his eyes tearing up too because of all the emotions going through him at the moment: a massive amount of pain, anger, hate, sorrow... And most of all: emptiness. Draco hated him. In the morning he had had everything, and now he didn't have anything at all. Without Draco he was nothing.
Hermione seemed to be deep in her thoughts. "I'm thinking… Maybe we could… you know, do something together? I mean like… go somewhere together sometime? The four of us…"
Greg raised his eyebrow. "Sure", he said. "What do you have in mind?"
Malfoy sneered. "We'll see about that. Tomorrow morning."
"Would you like me to stay here for the night?" Ginny asked again, this time touching Harry's thigh.
to take the mark after his father was sent to Azkaban. Voldemort was going to kill his family if he didn't agree to kill Dumbledore. He had
Harry nodded, not looking at the other man. Instead his gaze was fixed on his feet.
"Ginny was so amazing", Hermione commented ten minutes later when they were all walking through the grass back towards the castle. "She's so good. She could
He turned to glance at the Slytherin, recognizing a slightly melancholic look on his face though he was trying his best to hide it.
But Harry still kept going, not paying any attention to his words, and it was almost driving Draco crazy. Harry had always been such a persistent person, and that still hadn't changed. He always had to do the things the way he wanted to.
They were almost at their doors when Malfoy's case suddenly flew open and all of his stuff was spreading all over the corridor floor. He hadn't closed the case properly.
Malfoy seemed to hesitate for a while before finally accepting his hand.
His drunken eyes continued their journey back up on Malfoy's body. Damn, that beautiful, pale neck... He remembered how arousing it had been to suck on it in his dream, at the same time humping against that gorgeous body on his lap.
Harry shrugged. "How should I know? He just
"She doesn't need
have a problem with it! You've been cheating on
"So... you really want to spend the rest of your life with Malfoy?" Ron asked, lowering his voice. "You seriously want to marry him?"
That night Harry slept very restlessly, turning from side to side. In his dream he was once again sitting on the sofa in their common room, stroking his girlfriends silky hair with his fingers.
Suddenly he heard two familiar voices coming from the door of the place. Slowly turning around Harry first saw Goyle and...
"You mean today", Harry answered.
Fuck. Harry startled, quickly turning around and saw Goyle standing at the other side of the corridor. He had no idea what to say.
"I can't believe that we're going back to Hogwarts tomorrow", Draco said while getting up from the bed.
"You and Theodore are friends again, then?" he heard himself ask and wanted to hit himself right after.
"I'm switching rooms with Draco", Goyle answered nonchalantly.
"Yeah", Malfoy answered shortly again.
was an interesting experience", Malfoy said, staring at his feet.
at them. It seemed like Malfoy hadn't even noticed that Harry was in the room at all. Harry had been like air to the Slytherin the whole day, and he couldn't help feeling bitter about it. Why wouldn't Malfoy even look at him?! Last night had made him fall for the blond Slytherin even more than before, and instead of feeling even something similar towards him, Malfoy obviously didn't give a rat's arse about Harry.
Harry shrugged his shoulders. "Nothing much. Just normal stuff", he said. "Cleaning, cooking, watching TV, stuff like that..."
, Harry?" Ginny asked.
because of you! So don't you fucking
His eyes followed as Draco was slowly moving his hand a little closer, about to grab another snack. He pretended not to notice the Slytherin's hand and deliberately stretched his own hand to the bowl at the same time, causing their fingers to touch.
"Ready for more?" he asked.
Harry flashed a questioning look at the Slytherin and he continued.
" Ron demanded immediately. "Is it true what they're talking about?!"
Hermione nodded. "You, me, Ron, him", she said. "You said he doesn't have many friends and…"
They swiftly furnished Malfoy's new room, next starting to organize the now Goyle and Theodore's room. They were almost done when they were interrupted by a single cough.
The thought was killing him, his heart was aching and he felt like vomiting, and that was when he decided that he would have to talk to someone about their current situation or he would lose his mind. He would go and talk to Greg tomorrow. Greg was his most trusted friend, after all.
Ginny walked through the hall and took a seat next to Harry, kissing his cheek. "Good morning", she said happily.
"Would you mind telling us already?" Harry asked, frustrated. He couldn't take it anymore. He needed to hear what had happened, though he wasn’t at all sure if that was a good idea.
"I'd love to come with you", Malfoy cut him off, much to Harry's amazement. He had a tiny smile on his beautiful lips.
A short silence fell over until he could hear Draco mumbling almost inaudibly: "I... kinda like their colour."
The Slytherin nodded. "Yeah. Like I've told you before, I tell him almost everything."
That really was the truth. Of all the people in the world, there had been
Harry sighed, shaking his head. "I know. We saw her at Diagon Alley two days ago and I can tell you that it was not a warm reunion."
Harry nodded, feeling embarrassed to be so weak. He tried his best to get used to Draco inside him, but it was very difficult because the other man's cock was so thick.
Harry didn't answer. Instead he let out a little laugh. He noticed that his voice had gotten a little raspy because there was so much noise and they'd had to talk so loudly to hear each other speak that night. There were still so many customers before him that he'd have to wait for at least few minutes more before being served. And of course now he was stuck waiting with Malfoy, the man he had fallen for…
if you're planning to stay faithful to your adorable girlfriend and keep your reputation clean."
The second thing he had obviously messed up was his new friendship with Malfoy. After all those years of hate, bitterness and fighting between them, they had finally been able to become friends of sort. Malfoy had just learned to trust Harry, at least in some way, but what about now? How could they go on as friends when they had suddenly spent a night kissing, snuggling and frotting with each other. The worst part was that he secretly didn't even want to go on as
"Draco", Harry started under the other man's intense gaze. "I want you to know that... I
Draco couldn't believe his ears. "You just... left your job?" he mumbled. "Just like that?"
They stared at each other for a while before in an unspoken agreement they both leaned closer, closing the short distance between them.
"I'm going to apparate so I won't be long", Harry said. He had already turned towards the door and was about to leave when he heard Draco's voice again.
been?" he asked, lifting his eyebrow.
Harry, feeling a little embarrassed, shook his head. He wasn't prepared for stuff like this at all.
"Would you both just shut up already?!" Harry snapped a lot louder than he’d meant to.
"What? Why?" Harry turned to look at his best friend, feeling slightly confused.
The Slytherin gave a slow nod.
Finally, at least ten minutes and few more positions later, they reached their climax together. Harry came first, coming by his own hand with a loud cry and Draco followed right after, deep inside of Harry.
"I… talked with Ginny", Hermione finally said. "She told me what happened last night."
There was a short silence before Malfoy answered: "No, I said I'm not tired. I'll try not to wake you up." He sounded fed up. He took a comfortable posture in his chair and pulled a book from his schoolcase, disappearing behind it.
at me!"
"Okay. Good", Ron said, before still adding after a while of hesitating: "So... you're really,
Three hours later Harry was finally walking towards the 8th year's dormitories, with Theodore beside him. Their detention had consisted of cleaning under Filch's watchful eye and of course they had been forced to work together the whole detention. They hadn't said a word to each other the whole time, and there was still a deep silence between them as they were walking, until finally Theodore broke it with a question.
"Ron...", Hermione tried to calm her angry boyfriend down.
“At Malfoy Manor. You knew it was us, didn’t you? You knew it was me.”
“Oh, was that our potions assignment?” Of course, Potter wouldn’t know. Draco wasn’t even sure how he was in NEWTS-level potions anyway. He had done atrociously for all their years at Hogwarts, save for 6th year when he’d miraculously become a prodigy. But that had to have been a fluke; he was still pants at potions. Although surprisingly less so now. (Draco suspected that had a little to do with Snape’s absence.)
Draco sighed and acquiesced. “Fine.” Potter positively
Draco’s heart sank into his stomach. A joke. This all had to be some kind of cruel joke. Some Gryffindor thought it would be funny if lonely, evil Draco thought someone actually wanted him. Feeling unexpected tears stinging his eyes, Draco tried to push down the hurt and betrayal filling his chest and rushed into his dorm, ignoring everyone in the common room.
Draco gaped in shock at the mess on his workbench while Potter (the menace) began to snicker from his side.
“So she decided to help me get closer to you because she thought I could help you feel better. She told me about the flowers thing and helped me with the meanings.” Harry smiled shyly. “I was hoping you would at least respect the effort.”
. Draco had enough time to grab an apple before he left for his first class. Potions. With the Gryffindors. Fantastic.
. Draco Malfoy. Former Death Eater and disgraced heir.
"You really think you're something special, Malfoy. But you are not", she had said, shaking her head. "Let me remind you that he used to call me special too, to tell me what a beautiful and invaluable person I am to him. How I mean
got me into this."
Harry felt guilt washing over him. The ceremony must had been torture for his ex-girlfriend... He had never wanted to hurt her, but he had. He had broken her heart in a terrible way, he had treated her the way that
“Draco, love, he just wants to meet his nephew.” Harry reassures.
“Mated?”
Draco must have caught a tone because his expression and posture changed from one of someone relaxed to fear again.
“Draco, darling, how old is Zeke?”
Lucius nods, “Yes my boy, it’s me.”
“Draco, come sit with us, will you?” Harry asks wanting him to be close, so he could touch him, and hopefully reassure him that he is doing well.
“Draco, I’m sorry if I’m scaring you, really I am, but I have to ask, are you aware you have Veela blood?”
“Mr. Potter, how may we be of assistance to you.”
Harry goes into the hall and to the bottom of the stairs, calling out to his once lover, “Draco, can you come here for a minute?”
Harry ran his hand over Draco’s hair and the blonde leaned into the touch, Harry’s heart broke, in what should have been a gentle caring moment, Harry could tell that Draco was trained to invite such touches, which meant his Draco was trained to be a sex slave.
Harry can’t help the smile that spreads over his face.
“It’s okay Draco, just cook some more for you and Zeke and join me, sitting at the table.”
Harry can feel the prickle of happy tears behind his eyes as he leans down and wraps his arms around his boy for the first time, fighting his tears from spilling as he feels Zeke relax in his arms.
Harry grabs the salve and moves behind Draco, thanking his lucky stars for the salves magic quality, “You’re healing up nicely, a few more days of this and your back with be back to being smooth, as it always used to be.” Harry says remembering how beautiful Draco was and still is. Glancing up he can see the light blush tinting Draco’s cheeks. “Sorry love, got lost in thought there for a minute.”
Harry could tell that Draco wanted nothing more than to kneel by the way his knees were buckling, but he must have picked up on how much Harry hates it if he’s still standing.
Draco finishes reading and looks up at Harry, “So, you and I…?”
She turns back to her son, “He is back at our house in Canada, we could floo there if it is okay with Harry.”
Draco looks back at his Master and then turns without permission, not caring if he would earn punishment, his Master was crying, his Master needed comforting.
Narcissa leaves the image in the floo for a moment and Harry starts to wonder if she will come back but after a moment she comes back, “May I come through Mr. Potter?”
Blaise makes a movement with his hand for Harry to lead the way and they make their way out to the living room where Ron is sitting with Zeke trying to teach him chess with a muggle chess board that Harry has.
Harry goes and sits down with Draco while Ron and Zeke continue to talk about his kids, talking about what they do for fun and what they do together.
Harry swallows the lump in his throat, “Yeah, sure, I mean yes of course, where is Zeke?” he asks looking around the room noticing the lack of the boy.
Even at the comforting words, Harry could see the fear in Draco and knew that this was not over by a long shot.
Harry knew they were scared of him, they were trained to be afraid of their masters, and they were lacking any kind of trust toward authority figures. Harry, in order to seem less threatening, knelt by the pair.
Harry looks into the bathroom and still doesn’t see anyone, turning he gets an urge to look under the bed, kneeling down he peers under the bed and sees Zeke, eyes rimmed red and cheeks covered in tears.
“Of course, can you come downstairs with me, there is something I want to talk to you and your Dad about.”
Walking downstairs and into the Kitchen he is greeted by the sight of Zeke sitting at the kitchen table coloring and Draco working on cooking breakfast for their little family.
Zeke nods, “Okay Papa.”
Harry nods, “I am not going to lie, it is bad, he doesn’t even remember his time with me before the end of the war, I don’t know if he will remember you or not.”
“I’ve had worse.”
“Sorry master, he is just a boy, he should not have said that. His name is whatever you wish it to be. Please sir, don’t hurt my child.”
Doesn’t take too long to get the measurements, he makes quick work of it not wanting to prolong the contact, he doesn’t want to make them more uncomfortable.
“If your memory comes back to you, I hope it does some good and doesn’t make what happened to you that much worse, we don’t want to have your memories impact your mental health.”
“Draco, this is Blaise, you were good friends in school.”
“I see, anyone look promising from the list?”
Of course, luck was not on his side, as soon as Zeke is asleep again Draco seeks him out, coming to the Master bedroom and knocking on the door.
They walk down the stairs and Draco goes into the living room while Harry moves down the hall and into his study, locking the door behind him as he makes his way over to the fireplace. Picking up a pinch of floo powder he throws it into the fire and calls out the address that is provided in the letter. It doesn’t take long for someone to appear in the flames.
“Yes, I just, I feel so comfortable in your arms, please, I just want to feel safe for a little while, please?”
Harry takes everything out of his pockets and removes the shrinking charms on them, and soon the living room is littered with boxes, of clothing, books, art supplies, toys, he may have gone a little overboard. He also got some pizza, with some of Draco’s old favorite toppings and a safe half pepperoni and half just cheese not knowing what Zeke would like, and some salve for Draco’s back.
Draco picks up the paper, “Do you not want people to know we are here? That you have a son with someone like me?”
Harry nods and spends another hour with the man as they go through memories and he analyzes the sample for himself.
Harry could tell this was getting to be a bit much for Draco to talk about, but he had more questions, “Come sit with me please I do have a couple more questions.”
Draco gets dressed and then heads to the kitchen to start on their Dinner while Harry makes his way upstairs to spend time with Zeke.
Draco nods as he answers, “Yes, is that a problem Master? I am quite good at pleasing and if you wish to use me to produce an heir, I am able to do that as well.”
“Papa, what do you plan to do with us?”
“Yeah, yeah, didn’t Dennis tell you he put you on my list of tutors.”
“Yeah, wait, Harry?”
It’s only now that Harry can see the redness to her eyes, she must have been crying since she found out, and he can see how she is fighting the tears now.
Draco gave Harry a loving hug and kiss before watching his lover walk out the door to the home they shared.
Zeke looks up at Harry lost for words for a moment before he finally finds his voice, “Oh yes so much better Master, so much better, thank you so much, thank you!”
He notices Zeke let out a breath that he was holding, “Thank you Papa.”
Harry nods, “Yes, you do, but I don’t have time for that right now, I do have to get home to my family.”
“Father? Is it really you?”
“What’s a Grandparent?”
“Narcissa, at the end of the war I vouched for you remember? I did that because I knew you were not a supporter of Voldemort, you didn’t have the mark, because I loved, I mean because I love your son, you don’t need to humble yourself to keep me happy, really, Harry is fine.”
Harry wraps his arm around Zeke, “It’s okay, we are all family, no one is going to hurt you darling, just be yourself and it’s going to be okay.”
Draco stares at him in awe, “You really do believe all that don’t you, you really are happy to have me back in your life, with the things I heard when I was being trained I doubted that anyone other than Zeke would ever care for me.”
“Okay, will you and Daddy be there with us?”
He walks out of the bathroom causing Harry and Zeke to stop in their tracks to look at him. “I knew that it would suit you,” Harry says with pride.
Walking out Harry hung his head in shame, “Draco, love?”
To say that Harry was pissed was an understatement, sitting in the living room looking up at the ceiling he could feel everything that he had learned in the last few hours come to the surface and the more he dwelled on it the more angry he became. Finally, he sighs and stands up, making his way up the stairs and to his bedroom, he stops by the guest room, no, Draco and Zeke’s room, and listens for a moment, he hears soft sobbing but can’t make out if it is Draco or Zeke. He decides that he should leave them to it, interrupting may make it worse not better.
Harry checks the list over one more time, “I’m going to go back to my study, you go and check in on Ron and Zeke, see if they want the company.”
“Draco my love, I have more money than I know what to do with, please let me spoil my family.” It is out of his mouth before he can stop it, he closes his eyes not wanting to see the look on Draco’s face, not wanting to see the shock? Rejection? He wasn’t sure what he was expecting.
“Better?”
He crawls out but doesn’t touch the floor with his left hand, sniffling.
On the final day of the war Harry grabbed his wand, and headed for the door, before turning back towards his lover “Draco, I love you, and if everything goes as planned, I’ll see you tonight.”
She leads him down a hallway and into a meeting room done up so that all the council members would be looking right at him, or who ever else was in the appointment.
“A bottle fell on his hand and it was starting to bruise, I healed him because he was in pain, because I’m a decent person.”
“What are you grinning about?” Draco asks before looking away shyly, obviously trying too hard to be normal, feeling that he has to be acting a certain way to make Harry happy, which is in fact causing the opposite reaction. Sure, he want’s Draco to be happy, more than anything, but he doesn’t want it to be forced, he wants genuine happiness.
"You need something to cheer you up, honey", she said. "We should really go, you know. On Saturday. It's the Hogsmeade day anyway."
"Would you...?" Harry asked again, his voice so damn low and sexy by now that Draco was already shaking of arousal against him.
"I'll make it up to you, I promise. Tonight, perhaps?" Harry quickly suggested.
"Mmm", he moaned in Ginny's mouth and grabbed her waist tightly, rolling them over. He was now kissing her fiercely, moving his hands downwards on her body. Ginny's legs opened as Harry's hand reached her underpants, and she gasped in exhilaration. Her own hand was already groping at Harry's groin, but there was no life to be found in there yet.
"Oh, just shut the fuck up already! I'm sick of you and your lies!" Draco gnarled from between his now gritted teeth. How dared Harry lie to him. "I know what you've been doing behind my back for weeks!"
He turned his head to take a look at the man who was standing next to him, staring up at the stars and clearly deep in his thoughts. Draco looked so beautiful that Harry could not take it anymore. He couldn't wait a minute longer, he would have to speak what was in his mind right now.
He soon slipped his own fingers under his fiance's dark teal jumper, wanting to feel the lovely warmth of Harry's skin against his as well. Harry clearly liked this move and moaned into his mouth, deepening their kiss even more, and Draco hung onto him tightly.
They arrived to the graveyard where they spent a good while just standing in silence in front of the headstone that had been engraved with his parents dates of birth and death, and the message:
"Ready to go?" he asked as he reached Draco.
"And some
After flying Harry quickly showered in their dormitories. Ron and Hermione had already left to go to the library and Harry himself planned to go get some rest before dinner time. He closed the bathroom door behind him and headed towards their bedroom, bumping into Malfoy who had just closed his own door behind himself. The blond was now staring at Harry who was wearing nothing but a red towel around his waist. His slightly muscular, shower fresh body was almost fully exposed to the man standing right in front of him. The man he had just dreamt of last night.
"Let go of me", Theo snarled.
It was already very early morning when Harry woke up. He opened his eyes very slowly, staring at the ceiling, completely stunned. Where was he? It was clear that he was not in his own bedroom so -
"A remote control. You can switch from one channel to another with this", Harry explained. It felt so weird that Draco had no clue about anything that was so very familiar to himself, but he didn't mind explaining.
Ginny was staring at him for a while, her brown eyes flaring. Harry was waiting for a snap or a slap to his face, but he definitely didn't expect what happened next.
The next day after classes Harry was heading to the library to return back some books when he ran into Ginny, who was just leaving the library with one of her friends. She gave him a sullen glare and was about to pass him, but Harry grabbed her arm, stopping her.
Harry lifted his gaze, noticing that Draco was looking at him. His lips curved to another sly smile.
is possible... I don't think it would be so horrible, you know?"
A voice in Harry's head kept trying to stop him, telling him to slow down, but he didn't want to listen. He knew he was still technically in a relationship with Ginny and he knew he had decided to take things slow with Draco this time… but he wanted the Slytherin too much to care about anything else right now. He wanted to
the other man snapped. Harry was staring at him, not knowing what to say. "Gosh! I already told my
Silence fell over, this time making Harry feel uneasy.
"But all you other guys are", Ron continued. "That's bloody weird."
here and I’m not tired at all", he said finally, glancing at Goyle. "Feel free to leave if you feel like it."
who had bullied him for years, so...
"Draco", Malfoy corrected him, suddenly sounding a little fierce.
The other man looked confused at first until a tiny, relieved smile appeared to his lips as well. "Morning", he whispered. "So it wasn't just another dream after all?"
Malfoy had changed his clothes after today’s lessons and so he was now wearing a white, expensive looking blouse and black, skintight trousers, both of which highlighted his slender body perfectly. His platinum hair was a bit longer now than it used to be and it was hanging loose against his pale skin. He had long dark eyelashes and a perky nose and his lips were slightly parted as he was brushing his long, thin fingers against books, trying to find the one he was looking for. Harry had used to think of Malfoy as an annoying pointyfaced brat, but the Slytherin had grown to be very attractive after all. No wonder many girls had a crush on him, though the number of his admirers had decreased dramatically after the war, because many students were now so afraid of him.
"No", Harry said. "I was... with someone else and -"
After
"Fine by me", Harry answered with a shrug.
been cheating on you... You have to believe me!" His voice was now full of desperation.
do that to a friend of mine", he said, his voice cold. "You know that."
"You heard what Draco said, Blaise", Theo sighed immediately. "It is as clear as a day that Potter -"
Harry nodded. "Of course I was. You looked bloody gorgeous and left on a date with another man!"
Draco raised his eyebrow. "Possessive again, are we?" he chuckled before kissing him.
After a while he finally turned to face the blond. Malfoy was still looking at him, face unreadable. Harry's green eyes immediately locked with Malfoy's grey ones. They were so beautiful.
"He attacked me!" Theodore said abruptly, holding his other hand in front of his bloody face and pointing at Harry with the other one. "He's lost his mind!"
"He ruined every tiniest possibility for me to ever have any feelings towards him. Ever. Thank god Greg was ready to switch rooms with me."
Draco's smile widened. "You're right about that. And you took it very well... You were
"Umm... No offence, Malfoy, but you're not always the most serene person either", Harry quickly interrupted him, but Malfoy didn't pay any attention to it.
"I'm here now", he whispered.
"Shit!" Malfoy hissed and angrily started to gather his stuff. Harry knelt down too, helping the Slytherin in his task.
After lunch Harry and Ron finally decided to go flying, something they hadn’t been able to do for ages, and Hermione was keeping them company, watching them from below.
He sighed again, glancing at the other man sitting next to him. Even though Malfoy was right beside him, his sight was still quite blurry so he put his glasses back on to see better. He could see a tiny smile on Malfoy's lips and got a little irritated about it. Damn Slytherin! Was he enjoying Harry's distress?
" He couldn't even finish his sentence.
"Well, they're calling him names and – "
His mind was immediately filled with Malfoy's full, soft, but still so powerful lips kissing him clumsily and those stormy grey eyes looking deep into his soul afterwards... Oh god,
Damn... The sight had driven Draco crazy ever since the very first time he had seen the other man without shirt at Hogwarts, and it still did, every single time. Harry wasn't a very self-confident person when it came to his looks, however, so he had no idea how sexy he looked in Draco's eyes. Well, Draco had told him about it many times but Harry never seemed to believe him. Harry had always been so insecure about the way he looked, and still was. But in Draco's eyes Harry was perfect. His eyes, his tanned skin, his untidy raven-black hair, his lightning bolt scar... They were all part of Harry and he wanted him just the way he was. He knew he wouldn't change a thing though he had used to mock him about his appearance when they were younger.
Malfoy's eyes opened slightly, revealing the huge mental pain he was suffering at the moment when he was staring into the distance, hollow eyed. No words were needed. Those eyes… The man was
" Draco hissed back defiantly. "You're gonna hex me? Or beat me up like you did on fifth grade?" He was pretending to be brave, but in reality he was feeling everything but. He let out a cold, humourless laugh.
Harry stopped laughing as fast as he’d started it. He didn't even want to think about it. Ron was like a brother to him so...
"Can't wait to hear what song you've chosen for us", Draco said a little nervously, glancing around them at the guests gathering around them as they reached the middle of the dance floor.
He was not able to look at Malfoy who was now watching him with his eyebrows furrowed. Instead Harry stared at the window across the room, seeing his own reflection in it. His mind was totally messed up… Once again he had been arguing with Ginny… and this time he had been acting very aggressively as well. He had actually managed to scare himself, to be honest. He buried his face in his hands. What was happening to him?
Harry kept staring at the flames of the fireplace, remembering the fiery look in Malfoy's eyes. Damn Hermione and damn Ginny… He had really wanted to kiss the man, he had wanted it
Harry sighed heavily. "I'm sorry, Ginny. I never thought that things would go this way... It's just that I've been thinking about this a lot and... God, I don't even know how to say it. I don't want to hurt you, but I also need to be honest with you, and you'll hear about it soon enough anyway." He paused to take a breath after babbling for so long. This was so hard...
They shared a long, tender and loving kiss, hands running gently on each other's bodies. Harry's whole body was filled with warmth as he held Draco close to him. He loved this man so much.
do?! I can't believe you're taking his side!" Ginny hissed.
"So, tell us Harry, how's
Ron was trying hard to remember. He finally continued, whispering: "I think he asked Malfoy if he was ok and if he was in pain... Malfoy said it's fine and that's when I quickly returned to bed. Didn't want to hear them carry on, you know."

Malfoy said sharply, a self-satisfied grin on his face. "Stop trying to boss me around, Potter. Your dick is going nowhere near my ass tonight. You
"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good", he said after a moment, pointing at the blank paper with his wand.
After all, they were going to spend the next two weeks together at his place with no one else around. He would have plenty of time to think about everything and find the right words to say and, of course, gather some more courage.
Draco's mouth felt so warm in the chilly night and his hands were wrapped tightly around Harry's waist, his own hands being locked around the Slytherin's neck. He could feel the beating of Draco's heart against his chest and hear him moan to his mouth as he deepened the kiss, pulling the other man as close as he could.
should spend some time together", Harry suddenly heard Ron say and was startled, again.
"What the hell do you mean?!" Ron snarled.
l'm gonna kill you", Malfoy told him when they were once again standing in front of their doors.
Theodore's eyes first travelled to Goyle and then to Malfoy. "Is that so", he said. There was no warmth in his eyes.
"I was at Hog's Head", Harry answered. "I had a bad day and needed some fresh air, so..."
"And I've already told you that I've forgiven you", he said quietly. He got rid of his trousers and started to pull his pyjama pants on instead. Harry's eyes shamelessly rested on the Slytherin's butt. He remembered how it had felt against his fingers last night, with no underpants on.
"Umm...", Harry said, resting his hands against the table. "Well, I..."
"Or else
the blond asked, looking astounded. "Why on earth would people want to watch something like this?"
Harry was now glaring at his girlfriend. "You really think so?" he asked. "You really think someone deserves to be treated like that?" His voice was getting colder too.
"What the
"I don't know", Harry answered with a shrug. "With Hermione I guess. I didn't come with them."
"Uh... thanks?" Harry answered in surprise, staring at his new drink.
", he started. "… but she wouldn't even listen to me, and I…" His voice died.
Hermione and Ron glanced at each other and then at Harry, questioning looks on their faces.
Malfoy turned to look over his shoulder, checking that Hermione surely wasn't talking to someone else. "You're talking to us?" he finally asked, wrinkling his eyebrows in disbelief.
"It was... great", Harry answered curtly, forking a piece of chicken to his mouth. He glanced across the table, seeing both Ron and Hermione looking uneasy, Ron's cheeks slightly red.
he gnarled from between his teeth, already making his way towards the door behind Draco. "I'll
"Me too", Harry said.
Harry? Do you still want to go on with her?"
"But some people have also said that I have my mother's benevolence," Harry said, still in the ground. "And her eyes. They were the same green as mine."
"The thing is... You have no idea how strongly you make me feel. I've
Malfoy told him about all the horrible things he had been forced to do until Voldemort had finally been killed. All that torturing still haunted him and was the main reason for his insomnia. Harry hadn't even realized how much the war had affected the Slytherin - but now he knew. They also talked about Malfoy's childhood, his family and some of his future plans. It appeared that Harry had known almost nothing about Malfoy's life before tonight. He didn't even know why Malfoy told him so much about himself now, but he didn't mind.
wanted to break up, what
If Harry had had any doubts about Malfoy's interest towards him earlier, he didn't anymore. Malfoy was clinging onto him like there was no tomorrow, almost crushing him with his lips as they were both seeking dominance just like they always had, and when their lips finally parted for longer than one or two seconds, the Slytherin was looking at him with so much longing and lust in his grey eyes, breathing heavily: "Damn I want you..."
"I will when I get the chance", Harry answered, smiling.
Harry buried his face in his hands. How had this happened? He had no clue how and when it had happened, but it was clear as a day. He had fallen for Draco Malfoy.
"Well, I don't mind", Ginny said coquettishly. "It suits you. You look
The Slytherin let out a heavy, frustrated sigh. "Damn my mum", he cursed. "Did she really have to bring it up already..?"
"Me neither", Harry replied, searching for a suitable outfit from his wardrobe. Unlike most of the students around here, he preferred wearing muggle clothes rather than robes on his free time at Hogwarts. He found a neat enough looking bottle green blouse and some jeans and sat on his bed, starting to dress up.
Harry was in heaven. His shaking hands moved to Draco's silky platinum hair as his dirtiest fantasies came true. Draco Malfoy, his old arch nemesis, was sucking his cock, and had wanted to do it for a long time already? Blimey... He lifted his upper body a little to be able to see better how Draco's lips moved up and down on his hard member, causing him so much pleasure that he had never imagined to be possible, and when Draco finally opened his eyes and glanced at him with his stormy grey eyes... Merlin.
Her eyes were starting to water up again.
"What is it?" he asked, worried.
Once they were out of the house, Harry apparated them to Godric's Hollow.
He didn't know how long he’d been lying there but when he finally opened his eyes slightly, he noticed that the room was a lot darker, Malfoy was still sitting in the corner of the room and… Malfoy wasn't reading at the moment. The book was resting against his thighs and he was staring at Harry.
"Your eyes", the Slytherin said, avoiding eye contact. "They're very rare and... nice."
"Hey, we are going to Hogsmeade later today. Would you like to join us?" she suggested out of the blue. "The two of you", she added, pointing at the two Slytherins walking next to them. She received puzzled, incredulous looks from both of them. Ron seemed to be gasping for air as well, glaring at his girlfriend as if she had lost her mind completely by totally ruining their long awaited Saturday night like this.
"Not anymore", Harry answered, pulling his coat on. "I had one earlier, Kreacher, but nowadays he's working at Hogwarts."
Ron had really drank quite a lot already indeed. Goyle had had few beers as well, but Malfoy was not drinking any alcohol at all tonight. Instead he had first ordered a soda and then some peppermint hot chocolate, both times gaining strict looks from madam Rosmerta because of his horrible history. Malfoy not having any alcohol didn't come as a surprise to Harry because he knew that the man must had been drinking quite a lot last night.
Afterwards they were lying on the bed, snuggling and looking at each other.
your best friend, Malfoy", he finally said. "He's still the same guy. Nothing has to change."
"Two weeks, I know", Harry said. "But I've known you for years and you've been a big part of my life... in both good and bad."
"I already told you, Ron. It's private", he said.
"Whoever that bitch is, I bet she doesn't kiss you
“No, I-”
It was late in the morning when Draco emerged from behind his curtains the next day. Eyes bloodshot and chest ragged, he avoided his roommates’ questioning glances as he pulled himself together. Dreading the confrontation that would inevitably happen as soon as he arrived at the Great Hall, Draco made an effort to take as much time as humanly possible to get ready. By the time he arrived at the Great Hall, most of the students had already left for their classes.
“How could you know that is true?”
“Well…” Draco began. “One is a daffodil which means new beginnings and the other is a mum which means optimism about the future.
took a step back. Draco coughed lightly and, in a daze, directed his gaze back to his potion.
“What? Why would you think that?” Potter was beginning to sound a bit desperate for some reason.
“Yes, so I’ll stay friends with him for a little longer, and then I’ll tell him.”
Because that’s who was waiting for Draco. It only made sense and Draco silently berated himself for not realizing it sooner as he rushed through the darkened hallways. If Harry was the flower sender, it explained why he wanted to befriend Draco. It explained Harry and Pansy’s rendezvous: who else would tell him about old pureblood courtship customs?
“Then, Parkinson confronted me. She saw through me so easily. Demanded to know what my intentions with you were. She was worried about you and told me she wouldn’t let me hurt you. I told her all I wanted was to fall in love with you.” Harry met Draco’s stunned gaze with renewed force behind his eyes.
Draco just sighed and twirled the flowers by their stems between two fingers. “Forget it.”
“Draco.” Harry seemed to be at a similar loss for words until it all began to spill out in a frantic wave.
) shamelessly. “Want to play Quidditch later?”
Draco blanched, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Yes, well even if that is remotely true, I think it’s been good for you. You actually seem like a living human being today.”
“Crush them.” Draco looked up to find Potter staring intently at Draco’s knife hovering over the squirming beans.
All the breath rushed out of Draco’s lungs as Harry’s eyes widened and he took a small step forward. Rooted to the spot, Draco seemed to have lost all capacity to speak and rather continued to chant in his head
“Draco’s going to find out sooner or later. I don’t want to see him get hurt.”
. It was nothing. I just wanted him off my back for a while. You know how he’s been.”
On the other side of the wall, Draco seethed as the pieces came together. Draco had been so pitiful that Pansy just had to recruit the Golden Boy to
He couldn’t understand why. Potter had no obligation to speak to him. But, he seemed to be striking up a one-sided conversation any chance he got and made a habit of inviting Draco on outings into Hogsmeade despite Draco’s baffled refusals. What perplexed him more was that Granger and the Weasel had barely even blinked at Potter’s persistence. Draco had briefly considered the notion that his chattiness was part of some convoluted revenge plot to drive Draco insane, but he admitted that Potter probably had better things to do than think about Draco’s mental state (which was honestly questionable even without additional torment). Besides, he doubted it was a very Gryffindor thing to do.
Acting without command, Draco’s feet moved him forward until he was right in front of Harry, gaze never leaving his bright green eyes. He lifted his hand and took the rose from Harry’s outstretched fingers. Suddenly washed over by a peace he hadn’t felt in forever, Draco raised his other hand to cup Harry’s cheek and rested their foreheads against each other.
“No, I just need a little more time. He’s just started warming up to me and-”
“And…?”
“Because you didn’t deserve to die.”
“I really like you too.”
Even Draco had to admit Potter had grown into his scrawny build and untamable hair, but since when did he think of Potter as anything other than annoying. It really didn’t help matters when Potter was looking at him so earnestly through long, sooty eyelashes and gorgeous emerald... When Potter’s expression began to morph into one of inquiry, Draco realized he had been quiet for too long. He opened his mouth to protest and hopefully send the confusing boy back to his usual place beside Weasley, but suddenly Slughorn signaled for the class to settle down and began the lesson.
“Don’t call me that-” Draco realized with a jolt that if this boy was a Gryffindor, whoever had given him the flowers was most likely also a Gryffindor.
Higher and higher, Draco flew, feeling the chilling wind like whips across his cheeks. It had been a long time since he’d been on a broom. Quitting the Quidditch team in 6th year had been agony and his one other time on a broom had been… less than pleasant. Draco grimaced as he remembered the feeling of raging fire at his back. He felt movement to his right and glanced to the side to see that Potter had finally caught up. Staring at his back, Draco flushed as he remembered the way he had clung so pathetically to Potter.
“Am I so pitiful that you had to go behind my back?” Pansy flinched almost imperceptibly, sorrow filling her eyes. “Well, you won’t have to deal with me anymore.” He didn’t wait to see her reaction.
He dropped the parchment onto the bed and leapt to his feet. Heart pounding in his ears, he took off running out of the dungeon, ignoring his housemates’ bewilderment. His heart pounded in his ears as he made his way to the place he vowed he would never enter again for anyone or anything.
Draco scowled but pulled out his quill and tried to follow along. Halfway through his furious scribbling of the sedative properties of Valerian root, he felt Potter’s eyes burning twin holes into the side of his head. Vaguely unnerved but ultimately resigned, Draco continued his notetaking and tried his best to ignore the feeling of being watched. But when Potter began poking his arm in an attempt of getting his attention, Draco turned his head and spat out, “What?”
Draco couldn’t Potter win yet another Snitch. This was his. Draco dropped low on his broom and fell in tandem with Potter, whose arm was reaching toward the Snitch. Draco reached his own arm out, fingers outstretched. As each grew closer to the ground, Draco knew it was now or never. He lunged forward the last few centimeters, fingers closing over the Snitch as he tumbled off of his broom and braced himself for impact with the ground. He rolled, shielding his head, and came to a stop. Sitting dazed for a few seconds, Draco had almost forgotten about the Snitch clutched in his hand. Unfurling his fingers, he gazed down at the golden ball in shock.
“Had a nice time with Potter?” The question was posed casually enough but it made Draco jerk in surprise and knock over his tea. When he turned to Pansy, he caught the beginnings of a knowing smirk making its way onto her face and eyes glinting with amusement.
Draco stiffened and replied venomously, “No. And I hope I never do.”
In his haste to open his letter, Draco didn’t notice an owl clutching a flower between its talons until it had dropped the flower in front of Draco and flown away. Draco’s heart did a little somersault as he caressed the small petals lightly.
. He’d seen them once in the part of the gardens where only the elves went to tend to the flora. He’d spent most of his time under house arrest in a sunlit corner of the vast gardens where a small number of gladioli had been planted. Forgetting the war was easier out there where the world was much smaller and his only company were the flowers and the breeze.
In that moment, Harry’s smile was more beautiful than any of the flowers he had sent. Draco was sure his own smile was a mirror image. He pulled him close and buried his face into Harry’s unruly hair, blinking back tears. In his hand, he still clutched the red rose as its petals fluttered in the wind. This, at least, needed no translation.
When Draco finally entered his dorm after a day of dodging the Two Who Must Not Be Named (too soon?), he faceplanted bonelessly onto his bed, narrowly missing the delicate hyacinth laid carefully on his sheets. He scrambled up and cradled the flower in his hands.
“What are you talking about?” But Draco could already feel the blush that was threatening to bloom across his face. Damn his pale complexion.
Draco looked at him for long seconds and muttered loud enough so that Potter might only barely hear, “Maybe someone is.”
into his cauldron, his potion promptly exploded. Fortunately, Draco’d had the foresight to put up the appropriate protective charms—back when he was still a functioning human being, that is—in the unlikely event that something like this would happen.
--------------------------------------
“Well, are you going to just stand around like a buffoon?”
Pushing down the urge to glance at Potter as he walked into the Great Hall, he made a beeline for Slytherin table and took his usual spot in between Pansy and Goyle at the end of the table. Nibbling at a piece of toast, he gave in to the urge and cast a surreptitious glance at Potter from beneath his eyelashes. At the moment, he was digging into his rashers and laughing at some joke Finnigan seemed to have made. At his side was the Weaslette who was laughing along, one hand braced on his shoulder. Draco’s jaw clenched involuntarily and scowled at his toast.
It was Saturday by the time Draco realized he had made a huge mistake. The day after his flower revelation, he had sought out Potter and agreed to a trip to Hogsmeade. Potter’s obvious shock was quickly replaced with glee as he told Draco to meet him by the entrance. So now Draco was shivering in the cold, bundled in three layers of robes and winter garments, waiting for one perpetually tardy Potter. Just as he decided to go on without him, he turned to see a harried (heh) Potter stumbling down the path, Griffindor scarf whipping in the wind and hair hidden by an obnoxiously red knit cap.
“Sorry, sorry, I’m late. I was ambushed by a group of first years.”
Potter hummed curiously. “Someone put them there?” Draco just shrugged.
Potter recoiled as if he’d been slapped. “What? Why not?”
Draco couldn’t really see why anyone would want to be associated with a former Death Eater and disgraced heir (besides Potter of course but he obviously had a few screws loose). When he had gotten back to his dorm the night before, he had put a Stasis spell on the flowers and placed them in a small vase on his nightstand. The yellow petals seemed to be the only thing lighting up the room, and he had fallen asleep watching the flowers bob in the water. The next morning he had woken up to find two more flowers joining the first. A hibiscus—beauty, which Draco blushed profusely at—and coquetry—flirtation, which had him grinning like a fool for the rest of the morning even through Pansy’s knowing smirks.

“You knew, but you lied. You saved our lives. You saved my life, Draco.”
Draco stuffed the flowers into his bag, pivoted on his heel, and hurried away. Draco could vaguely hear the boy shouting after him but his voice was quickly drowned out by the chaos reigning in Draco’s head.
Draco’s breath caught as the pieces finally came together.
He glanced at the other boy pointedly, “Well, are you going to just stand around like a buffoon, or are you going to actually accomplish something productive?”
When he arrived at the Great Hall the next morning, he stopped outside the doorway to quell the giddy feeling in his chest which seemed to have carried through the night. Pansy, even in her subdued state, was like a hawk and would immediately sense and latch onto Draco’s change in mood, and he would never hear the end of it if she found out about his evening with Potter.
. Though he probably shouldn’t have been so shocked: it was quite a Slytherin thing to do. Draco burrowed under his covers and let the sobs wrack his body. He couldn’t deny the reason he was so upset. While he hadn’t let himself dwell on it, he had hoped Potter actually wanted to be his friend… and maybe something more.
“Thank you.”
Draco was snapped out of his thoughts by the jingle of the bell signaling customers at the doorway of Scrivenshaft’s. At the register was a short, balding man who didn’t seem to give the two new arrivals a second glance. Draco mentally exhaled a sigh of relief. Maybe he would make it through this trip relatively unscathed. He tugged at Potter’s arm and pulled him toward the back of the shop where he knew his favorite quills were stocked. While Draco browsed the collections of quills, Harry wandered through the shelves poking at various stationery. Draco stifled a snort when Potter narrowly escaped the wrath of a tad bit aggressive inkpot, directing a sheepish smiled at Draco.
"Ron, stop it", Hermione laughed, but Harry felt as if someone had just stabbed him. Was Ron on the right track? And why did he even care about that at all?
The next day was not easy for Harry. He was tired, he was embarrassed, he was confused… In short, his head felt like exploding because of everything and he still had to try and concentrate on studying.
"Can I... come with you?" the Slytherin asked.
anymore. No, he wished to have more than a friendship with Malfoy, only it was not possible. It never would be.
"You're going with... Malfoy", Ron finally repeated sceptically whereas Hermione was now silent as a grave, just staring at Harry.
Yeah… Draco Malfoy was always on his mind and today had only made it much, much worse. Just thinking about the blond Slytherin, how he had finally gotten so close to the man and almost kissed him made his stomach flutter. He had wanted to hold the man, he had wanted to touch him so, so bad, and he still did… and Malfoy had wanted it too, he was pretty sure of it after their night at the pub. Malfoy had whispered that he might leave his door open for Harry. Blimey, he still couldn't believe it. Malfoy wanted him, Harry Potter, to go to his room at night and…
Damn how perfect it sounded. Today, he had gotten everything he wanted.
"A little crowded here, eh?" Malfoy commented and winked at him, wearing a tiny smile on his lips.
was the one to get to marry this gorgeous man. He was the luckiest man in the whole word...
Everyone was having a lazy day, trying to gather strength for another rough school week that would start tomorrow.
lying to me and you'll only hurt him again -"
"It's okay", Harry said quietly, feeling very quilty. He felt a big lump in his throat again. "I'm not angry."
Draco didn't know what to say. "I do agree with you, but... being an Auror has been your dream for years", he said quietly, lowering his gaze.
"You've had sex with
"How do you forget something like
Draco glared at him. "Harry, you seriously want to discuss that already?" he asked, shaking his head in irritation.
Harry pulls back and places his head in his hands, his words coming out mumbled, “I couldn’t even read it, just saw the headline and it just awoke this anger in me.”
Draco looks over, eyeing the new addition to their ever-growing list of people in the house.
“Zeke is your family; you could have just freed him.”
“Not really kiddo, my parents passed when I was a baby, my aunt and uncle were never really there for me, my cousin was a bully, the only family I have left is the one I’ve made for myself, my friends who I care about and who care about me.”
“Get dressed please Draco.” Draco does as he is told and Harry notices his trembling increase even through his tears. “Did I scare you again Draco?”
“I sent him a letter this morning asking him to track down tutors for me, but with the paper and everything I forgot that I did it.”
“Draco, love, look at me, really look at me.”
Draco smiles as he nods, slowly drifting off to sleep.
“So, where’s your son?” Ron asks.
“My father?”
“Do I have Grandparents?”
When Draco noticeably relaxes Harry’s smile becomes genuine, “Well, you need to get dressed, but do you want me to get you some clothing that I got you today?”
Blaise looks at him with a sad expression, “Yeah I did, how are they?”
Zeke looks at Ron, “It’s nice to meet one of Papa’s friends, he said you are a Daddy too.”
Standing naked in front of his Master Draco shivers.
Draco laughs a little which Harry is grateful for, he didn’t want to make him uncomfortable.
“Mr. Potter, what an honor,” says a tall, thin balding man who stands to great their guest, “what brings you here today?”
Harry closes the salve and puts it on the counter in front of Draco, “This only has to be applied once a day, so just let me know when it’s time to do it again, if I forget that is.” Harry shoots Draco a shy, nervous smile in the mirror which Draco is quick to return.
Draco can feel the blush on his face, “Thanks, do you want help?”
Zeke looks back and forth between them, confusion, and fear on his face, “Daddy, what’s going on?”
Harry nods, knowing how powerful Draco really is and with the veela blood he isn’t surprised by the wandless magic, “Alright kiddo, let’s see if we can’t get Daddy to wake up.”
Zeke stands up, “Can-can I have that hug now please Papa?”
“Draco, have you produced any other children besides Zeke?” Harry asks taking a deep breath, needing but not wanting to know the answer.
"Master, I-I made breakfast for you, I hope I didn’t step out of line, please if I did punish me and make it right please.”
“Draco, even with this, I don’t want you to feel any pressure what so ever to come to my bed, if I never have you in my life like that again, I am okay with that as long as you are happy and healthy.”
Zeke sits there for a moment before he stands up and walks over to Harry, “Is that why you healed my hand?”
“Oh, was I not supposed to leave and start tending to the house?”
Harry could see that those words were bringing him shame, but he didn’t see a reason for that to cause them shame, “You left to stay free, to stay together, I don’t see any reason why you wouldn’t be proud for fighting to be together.”
“I see.”
Harry whips his head toward the stairs, “Ron, wait here with Draco, I’m going to go see Zeke.”
Draco nods.
Narcissa and Lucius walk back into the room and Lucius walks right over to Draco and kneels in front of him, looking up at him.
Harry blushes at Ron’s words.
The group look on in shock, not sure what to say, until one of the men gasps in shock, “Oh dear god, please tell me we did not enslave Harry’s son!”
“Not until last night.”
“I just appreciate how you are giving me time to work this out and aren’t pushing, you’re the best!”
Harry pulls back, tilting Draco’s face up and searching his face looking for some reason now to let him stay the rest of the night.
“Well, I am sure Zeke will be more than happy to work hard on his studies to make you proud and I will care for the house.”
Draco moves to sit on the other side of Zeke and Harry wraps his arm around to run his finger over Draco’s arm, it was a little thing but somehow Draco began to relax again.
“He is in our room; he is making sure that the ensuite bathroom is clean.”
“Right.”
“Teach him? Teach him what?” Harry can see that Draco is nearing a panic.
Harry knew that for Zeke to be seven, there is a good chance that the boy could be his, he stands up and goes to the dresser in the entrance hallway before returning with sealed cotton swabs, “I am going to need to take some saliva samples.”
Harry stands up and takes Zeke’s hand as they walk across the hall, sure enough as soon as he is in the room he can hear the screaming, it made Harry feel protective and sad seeing him like this, he crosses the room in quick strides making it to his once lover’s bed in no time.
Reaching their room, he presses his ear to the door, hearing soft voices on the other side Harry can feel himself relax. Tentatively, he raises his hand and knocks on the door, waiting this time for someone to come and answer, a part of him expecting to be standing here for a while.
“Very good, seems like you have to go and return home to your family,” a sad look on his face, “you have given an old man something to think about, looks like we are going to have to go through our records and make sure everything is on the ‘up and up’ so to speak”
“Well, Mr. Potter, seems the aye’s have it, come with me and we will fill out the paperwork, and well, maybe get some proof for the records, yes?”
Harry steps back after giving him the go ahead, Blaise comes through the floo and brushes himself off before looking at Harry, “You got old Harry.”
All eyes suddenly turn to Harry and he fights the groan from leaving him, “Really guys, I’m not trying to control you, I am just trying to keep you safe, if you want to go to see your Father we can certainly do that.”
Harry can’t help but feel pride well up inside of him when he sees the blush spread over Draco’s cheeks as they look at one another.
Draco wakes up and jumps out of the bed, “I’m sorry Master I’ll be good, please not again, please!”
Harry and Draco share a look before Harry looks down at his son, “Well, I am not sure where Daddy’s parents are, but mine are no longer here, but Ron’s parents are like my own, you can call them Grandma and Grandpa if you want.”
Draco smiles.
“Nonsense, you learned to do that for self-preservation, I admit I am not happy that Zeke saw that, but there is a lot of things that he has been witness too that I am not happy about, if you want we can move Zeke into his own room…”
Sitting in Draco and Zeke’s room with empty pizza boxes and the now assembled shelving for books and toys, Harry was content, happy even, for the first time in what feels like forever.
“Gone to the burrow, I stayed back to reach out to see how you were, I read the paper, they went into detail, about how he was a slave and how you freed him, how he was brought in pregnant with your child and how the ministry didn’t even test the boy.”
Draco does as he is told and stands up straight, Harry looks down over the body, his back is so much worse, fresh welts from a whip, cuts, bruises and it went from the base of his neck down to his thighs, Harry sits back down and lets out another strangled sob.
Draco and Zeke are cuddling on the sofa, Draco finally getting to read to his son when Harry apparates in. “Oh good, you’re here, I have so much stuff I don’t know where to begin.”
Silence fell over. Harry couldn't see Malfoy's face but it was clear that the Slytherin was surprised by his words. He could still feel his eyes on him, but he couldn't look back at the moment. There was something in Malfoy's eyes that made him feel very uneasy.
His thoughts left Ginny and travelled back to Malfoy again. Why the hell had he suggested Malfoy to give Theodore a chance, when in fact he wanted nothing less?
Harry's eyes travelled down on the Slytherin's beautiful, pale, slender body that was now glimmering with sweat, the large scars covering his torso not worsening the view for him at all. Draco was perfect the way he was and he wouldn't change a thing about the man. He took a hold of the Slytherin's big erection again, squeezing it rhythmically as he kept enjoying the amazing ride that Draco was offering him and listening to his loud whining.
you", Harry said. He let go of Malfoy's hair, his cheeks starting to heat up. "And even if I had, it would have nothing to do with her. I do care about her."
He quickly glanced backwards when he heard Ron burst out laughing again. It was just enough for him to catch Malfoy's eyes looking straight to his direction. Harry quickly turned around again with a tingly feeling in his stomach and a confused little smile on his lips. Taking a swig of his beer again he gathered himself as well as he could, soon strolling back to their table.
your ass!"
He was already trying to get up when he heard Malfoy saying quietly: "He's gay."
Harry frowned, realizing what he had just thought. Okay, what the hell? Did he just think of Malfoy as attractive?
"What?" Harry asked again, brows furrowed. He didn't know what Draco was talking about.
down", Malfoy sighed. He was starting to sound pissed.
Malfoy may have said that Harry had a really dirty mind, but Malfoy and Theodore
Ginny was now looking at him with a blank face. "You weren't alone", she repeated.
" Harry heard Ron gasping before he closed the door after himself and instantly headed towards Draco's door. He was already about to knock when he heard Theodore speaking again and turned to glance at him.
"Mmm...", Draco let out a quiet moan as Harry's hand finally lowered to his butt covered by his tight trousers, giving it a nice, firm squeeze.
"Well, well...", the brunet said, a very forced looking smile on his lips. "Had a nice holiday?"
was..."
"Harry?" Draco asked again. "Are you alright?"
Harry, who had been drowning in his thoughts, slowly turned to look at the other man. He had no idea what Theodore was talking about. He was too busy thinking of Draco and how he could manage to make the man listen to him.
Ginny's smile widened, and before Harry had any time to react, she had already smashed her lips against his mouth and kissed him hungrily. He quickly responded to the kiss, running his hands through her long hair. Ginny always managed to blow Harry's mind with her kissing skills, but on the other hand she had dated many guys so it was no wonder why she knew how to kiss so well.
"She will, but you
Ginny. I... I don't think I can do this right now..."
"Oh, I see", Seamus said, giving him a knowing look before disappearing towards the bedrooms. "Good night!"
"I know", Malfoy said.
Ginny hissed from between her gritted teeth. "You've got to be joking!"
"You're mine", he said, their foreheads pressed together, never breaking their eye contact.
spending time with her, somehow his thoughts kept wandering to the blond Slytherin instead, wondering what the man was doing at the moment and with whom. Harry knew how wrong it was but he just couldn't help it.
"So Theodore knows about your feelings towards me?" Harry asked, and Draco nodded.
"There's just one thing that's worrying me", she mumbled. "What is the reason you are obsessed with him? With Voldemort gone, what is it
"No. You said that the Sorting Hat knew better", Malfoy said sharply. "What did you mean by that?"
Also, they had hardly managed to enter the train when he had already succeeded in pissing Draco off. He had automatically assumed that after having spent two long weeks with no one else but Harry, Draco would want to sit with his Slytherin friends on their way back to school. And of course Draco had gotten it all wrong. He would have to talk to him as soon as possible, but first they'd have a dinner to attend to.
"Bastard!"
"I want you too, Malfoy", he breathed against the beautiful pale skin, sucking on it, nearly leaving marks. "You drive me so fucking crazy."
"I don't know if I even want to say it", Ron said. He wasn't able to look at Harry in the eyes anymore. Instead he was now staring at the floor, looking disgusted. His normally reddish face looked almost as pale as Draco's.
Harry took a deep breath, turning to stare at the wall again. "Perhaps it would be wise if I spent the holiday at Grimmauld Place instead..."
Draco had lowered his gaze to the floor and Harry finally took a closer look at him. Draco's eyes were all puffy and red and it was clear that he had been crying the whole time that Harry had spent in detention with Theodore.
Harry was trying to get up. He tried to gather himself up but his head was spinning and hurting badly because of the smash. "Draco... please...", he slurred desperately, hand on the back of his head.
Harry gave his best friend a slightly vexed look, causing Ron to shut up. Harry had heard the question so many times from his friend during the last two weeks that he wasn't at all surprised anymore. However, he did feel a little bitter that Ron still dared to say something like that on his big day.
Harry had quite a good lead, but then, all of a sudden, Malfoy approached him and grabbed the Snitch right under his nose. Harry cursed out loudly when he heard Malfoy rejoicing next to him.
"Ginny, I need to talk to you about something."
, Harry was already starting to suspect Theodore having just fooled him. He couldn't help feeling a little worried that Theodore might still try to take an advantage of the situation and steal Draco from him.
seen Draco?" Theodore asked loudly. Everyone was shaking their heads. "No one? I've been looking everywhere for him." He looked worried.
To both of their surprise, Narcissa didn't seem shocked. Instead, her eyes were soon filled with tears as she wrapped her arms around her son, hugging him tightly.
"Yeah, right...", Ron said, giving him a meaningful look.
"Yeah, yeah, we heard you!" Ron shouted at his girlfriend.
Harry was quiet for a while, thinking of what to say. This weekend clearly hadn't been the best for Malfoy. First he had been crying to his ex-nemesis Harry, and now this...
worse. He remembered all too clearly how that slender body had felt pressed against his own last night. It had felt so
good looking guy. Nothing wrong with Malfoy either, you know... I personally think they would make a really hot couple!"
Harry was left alone, staring at the wall with blank face. He didn't know what to do with his relationship with Ginny. He had hurt Ginny very badly and he felt terrible about it. He had never wanted to hurt anyone...
Harry trembled. "Uh..." He couldn't manage to say anything. Malfoy had totally gotten him off guard this time.
"Well, at least you've tried", Hermione said.
"Before we get to the vows, Harry and Draco have wished to share the letters they have written for each other for their big day", Rivers continued. "Harry, whenever you are ready, you may begin."
like in one of my dreams."
The friendship between Harry and Malfoy had gone almost back to normal over the last weeks. At least they still studied and hung out together like they had used to, but they didn't spend as much time together, just the two of them, like they had done earlier. Harry knew the reason for that. Though they hadn't even mentioned their night spent together anymore, he was well aware of the fact that neither of them had forgotten it. It was clearly still bothering both of them, but they just didn't dare to bring it up.
"To my knowledge we didn't decide any specific time", Harry notified.
Harry noticed that Malfoy wasn't in a mood for chit-chat, but since they were
here", Harry whispered to Ron, hoping to hear some reason for Ginny's decision to be there. He didn't know how to feel about her presence at his and Draco's wedding.
have been having sex!"
"That one you'll have to figure out all by yourself", the Slytherin said. "I've still got one gift to buy as well anyway, so..."
"Malfoy, what are those-" He grabbed Malfoy's wrist tightly.
"Failure after failure, but finally we found him... and caught him, early on yesterday morning", Harry said. "That's the reason I couldn't come back home that night. We spent the whole night following him." Instead of sounding proud at all of his success, he only looked very sad. "I thought you knew the reason why I was so tired and stressed all the time. I felt so guilty for neglecting you because of all that stress from work. I couldn't concentrate on anything and I had to get as much sleep as I possibly could and... I didn't have the slightest idea that you didn't know the reason for my behaviour, or that you could possibly think that I'm fucking someone else behind your back."
tell me that isn't true, Harry?!" Ginny snapped. Her whole body was shaking and her eyes were starting to fill with tears. She was starting to realize the ugly truth behind everything. "Tell me he is
"Well, as long as they'll kick Ravenclaw's ass it's fine", Ron said with a grin.
Ron looked a little uneasy. "Yeah, I know...", he said back just as quietly. "I didn't expect her to come either."
No talking, no laughing, nothing at all. Not a sound. He knew that Malfoy and Theodore were there so why couldn't he hear anything?! Were they sleeping already?
you don't want to talk?" Harry asked.
Harry quietly entered the small, dim room, closing the door after him. He was surprised to see Malfoy lying on his bed on his side, eyes already closed. It seemed that the Slytherin had already fallen asleep, after all… Harry felt disappointed, he had waited too long. Letting out a sigh he turned to leave.
"I want you too", he heard Harry muttering in a low voice. "It's been too long..."
"I know. Sorry about that", Harry said. "But I needed some time alone... I got some company later though."
He kissed the shorter man's throat, hearing Harry's breath fasten, and unbuttoned his jeans at the same time, letting them drop to the floor as well. Now they were both only in their underpants and socks, their rock hard members pressed together. Harry's fingers were squeezing Draco's round buttocks avidly through his white silk boxers and Draco couldn't wait for what was waiting for him ahead.
Malfoy was glaring at him, shaking. "Fine. Then I'm going!" he snapped. "I hate you!"
Harry gulped. He hadn't told Malfoy about their first years Sorting Ceremony. Actually there were very few people who knew about it
Ginny gasped in shock, not able to believe her ears.
long essays in only two days. They were also supposed to make presentations for their next Potions class, each one of them about a different potion. There was so much to do and so little time, Harry genuinely didn't know how he could manage to get everything done. He was so tired after last night and had planned to go to sleep early tonight, but it just wasn't possible with all the homework they had received.
He turned to face the Slytherin, flashing a smile at him, and saw a very tiny smile appear on Malfoy's lips too. Once again they were staring deep into each others eyes and Harry felt a sudden urge to embrace the other man. He wanted to caress him, just hold him close, feel his warmth against him... but he also knew that Malfoy would push him away right away, so he didn't even try anything like that. He forced himself to lower his gaze.
"Imagine the headline", the Slytherin continued, grimacing. "The Saviour kissing an ex-Death Eater in the middle of London..."
The blond was yet again staring into distance. "I've known Theo for ages and he has kind of become my best friend..."
tell her the truth… "You
The door opened without a knock and he jumped.
They didn't have any time to shower so they just changed into their daytime clothes and quickly headed towards the Great Hall. When passing through their common room, Harry noticed that Malfoy wasn't there anymore. He must have gone downstairs to have some breakfast already, he thought.
The door opened slowly and Hermione walked inside, closing the door after herself. She then immediately turned her eyes towards Harry, who was now sitting on his bed.
Blaise, however, tried to comfort Draco by saying: "There is still a small chance that he hasn't been cheating on you, though."
The tingly feeling in his stomach was back again. He wanted to press his face against Malfoy's well set, silky looking platinum hair, smell it... then the pale skin on his neck, move his lips against it, caress it with them, taste it... He was nearly starting to harden at the mere thought.
