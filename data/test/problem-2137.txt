“Alright, I searched everything I could find and studied the potion that caused our bond and unfortunately everything I researched and discovered just proved that we are stuck together forever. Nothing; and I mean light and dark spells and potions, nothing will work to dissolve this bond. So this means that we have to find a way to work together and deal with all the side effects and whatever else this will cause. To start with, Potter, since you have to always be around one of us, you will be taking the same classes as Draco and eating at the Slytherin table. Basically you are now considered an honorary Slytherin. I already spoke to the rest of the Slytherins and they are aware of this and the fact that you are considered our bondmate. McGonagall spoke to the Gryffindors so they are also aware of your situation. Any questions so far?”
“Well… I suppose this has been enough time. No point in making Mr. Malfoy wait for you all night. Now, instead of every night we will do this weekly so every Monday from now on you are to be at my door by 7pm. Hopefully soon you’ll learn your lesson.”
He was just finishing up when the outside door opened and Draco came in looking half angry and half unsure. Then the other door opened and Snape came out with his nose in the air as if trying to figure out where the smell came from.
“I’m only telling you what Dumbledore has told us and there’s no reason for Dumbledore to lie to his staff. Just take this into consideration when you deal with Potter, us staff know him as a liar and an exaggerator.”
“I have it under control Poppy, thank you. If you are done with his treatment for now I’d appreciate some privacy for this.”
“Ok, class. The O.W.L.s are getting closer so let’s get to it. The next spell I would like us to try is called
Malfoy sneered out when he noticed Snape coming back in. Snape went straight to his potions books to look up every ingredient and their properties from the salve he had been making. He sat on his couch and opened his books at the right page regarding the salve.
Harry smiled widely at Draco glad that at least one of them likes his cooking. He thought it tasted quite alright himself, and hoped that Snape would at least try it.
“Correct, 5 points to Gryffindor.” Snape looked angry he had to give points but realized it was a good answer. “Now what is the main ingredient that causes the binding? Mr. Malfoy?”
How could he possibly just forget who the brats’ parents are? He loved one of them and hated the other just as strongly, it was impossible to just let those feelings go.
Once everything was settled and the potion making was on the way Ron started whispering to Harry once more about his incredible revenge idea.
He slowly got himself ready for bed, making sure that his glamours are still up and Draco couldn’t see the scars he has from his own so called family. After that he settled in bed and rolled away from Draco and tried to get himself calm enough to sleep.
Malfoy just looked at Harry and nodded trying to understand how it would feel but not really being able to. It’s the first time he tried to see things from Potter’s point of view when Snape got like that with him and he didn’t like what he was seeing. Snape didn’t even try to understand why Harry would feel like that or why it might be an issue. This just wasn’t right, was it?
Snape turned to Malfoy who had stopped laughing and just nodded his head to confirm what Harry said.
Poor Draco had no idea what Harry has just gone through. But not wanting to make him panic Harry just gave him a small smile and led the way back to their rooms. He tried to keep his hand hidden by keeping it in his pocket but he was scared his pocket would infect the wound. He just figured he’d have to wash it well once he got to their quarters.
Snape ran some tests, as a potion master he also needed to have the basics of healing, but as a dark arts specialist he knew more than most about curses and such. The results of all his tests were in the negatives. He couldn’t see any reason for this supposed pain the boy is in.
“Potter, poisoning us won’t help your situation, besides, we have house elves to feed us when we’re hungry, no need to try your luck considering how good you are at potions…” Snape sneered looking over what Potter supposedly cooked. It looked good, that just made him think Potter had no hand in it and that the elves made it under his orders.
Harry, who was not asleep but merely thinking, looked over to Snape and nodded his head meekly while standing up with his arm out, his teeth were biting his lip so that he could prepare himself for the pain, he kept his head down because he didn’t like the feeling he got when he looked over at Snape. He figured his Omega senses are starting up and he wasn’t sure how he felt about that.
“I’m sorry we forgot to leave a note for you professor, I was running late and sort of rushed Draco to get to detention on time. This detention has been going on since the first class with Umbridge. She didn’t like that I didn’t agree with her about how I’ve been lying about Voldemort being back. So she gave me detention to keep going until she decides I learned my lesson. Although she did change it to once a week now that you or Draco have to come with me.”
“Didn’t bother to wake up your roommate? Were you trying to make yourself look better than him or something?”
Walking into the kitchen he checked to see what he could make and noticed that the place was pretty much empty. He decided he wanted to make his special steak tacos so called for an elf and asked for all the ingredients he would need.
Harry turned around to see Snape in the entrance looking angry as usual. He was dressed in his usual school robes and had his nose up with his eyes looking down at Harry. Harry tried to look him in the eyes but for some reason he couldn’t keep it up and looked down to his feet instead.
Harry shrugged not wanting to talk about it, he tried to keep that numb feeling he had earlier, it was better than the pain he knew he would be feeling. Instead he decided to stop trusting people and figured Malfoy would be perfect to teach him how, the first step would be to secure his trunk.
Harry opened his eyes and looked at Draco and gave a small smile. He was surprised that Draco was being so gentle but he was also very glad that at least him and Malfoy have made peace in some way. Hopefully it was not just temporary due to the fact that Malfoy pitied him or something.
Harry finished his homework pretty fast seeing as how he did most while stuck in the infirmary. He did take the time to reread whatever he missed out on but he figured he understood things pretty well so far. He packed everything away and looked at the time and was surprised it was close to lunch, and still Draco hasn’t come back. He wondered what Snape has told him then figured he was probably helping Snape with potions since he enjoyed that. He decided to go look for him. Leaving their room he started to smell some sort of potion so he decided to follow his nose. He ended up at a room that Snape had told him never to disturb. He figured the others must be in there making a potion or something so he decided to make lunch for everyone.
No, he wasn’t in love with Lily, but he did think of her as a sister and when she turned him away it hurt more than anything else the Marauders could have done. But then she started dating his torturer and didn’t try to stop Potter from everything they did to him. That broke his heart even more since if it was him he would have done anything for her. When she died part of him died as well, because even though he couldn’t trust her anymore, part of him still loved her, she was his family. He blamed the Potters for having her killed, and seeing that face with her eyes in his classroom just broke him a little more every time.
“Any other questions at this time Mr. Potter? If not I have to go brew some more salve for you and Mr. Malfoy.”
“Draco… You have to stop believing all his lies! He’s just trying to manipulate us by telling us these stories and making up all these pitiful fabrications so that we pity him and let him get away with things since we would feel sorry for him. Dumbledore told me that McGonagall was the one to get him and that she met the family and found no problems with them. So I don’t know where he got this version from but it cannot be true.”
“In fact, before we even go into the chamber we need to figure out a way to fix the cave in that Lockhart caused. I doubt you want to go through the small hole I managed when I was twelve.”
Harry took deep breaths. Trying to calm his temper again so that he could continue to explain what Snape needed to know.
Blaise, Theo, Pansy, Daphne, Millicent, Vincent and Gregory were all grouped together, unimpressed with everything going on. They had to find a way to support the boys. Slytherins stuck together and now that Potter was a Slytherin they now had his back.
“Mr. Potter, you yelled in my classroom. I would never have accepted that no matter who did it. As for the Ravenclaws, there was no proof that they were the ones that attacked you; it could have been other Slytherins so I was not going to punish them too severely without that proof. Now you better get going, you don’t want to be late to your next class.”
“I thought you were both busy with potions so I figured I’d get lunch going for everyone. I just finished if you guys are hungry?”
Draco squeezed Harry’s hand in warning; he didn’t want to anger Snape any more than he usually is. Especially since he’s already so against everything Harry does. He did wonder if their so called Alpha will be spending any time with them other than in class.
“Potter, I told you on our first day, you don’t want to make friends with the wrong sort. Those two, they are definitely the wrong sort.”
Meanwhile, Snape was busy trying to understand the potion that Weasley created, he was analyzing it and testing it and just trying to see if there was any way to make a cure because he definitely didn’t want to be stuck being bound to two fifteen year olds. He knew he could at least be happy with Draco, even if it was a little peculiar since he knew him since he was young, but Potter…  How could he possibly have a civil relationship with a Potter?
Snape got up and left without finishing his supper and went back to his potions lab. Malfoy had just finished his last bite and looked over at Harry.
Harry shook his head and just sighed. He didn’t understand why Snape hated him but he knew that it would mean that if this bond is permanent he would always be miserable with his bondmate. He was just glad that Draco and him buried the hatchet.
“Sev, stop, look at Potter. Look at his eyes and try and feel his feelings. He is obviously scared and worried and just unsure of everything.” Snape still ignored Draco and was about to shake Harry for an answer to his accusations when Draco stood up and pulled him away from Harry.
“This is nothing new with what happens to us Slytherins’. You get used to it. It’s also why Sev is so generous with us and takes points easily from the other houses. Now c’mon, it’s time for Potions and the last thing we need is to be late for that.”
The biggest thing with this bond is that the potion itself decided on which role we will be playing in our tri-bond. I am the alpha, which means that you both defer to me in and out of the bedroom, Draco is our beta, he is in the middle, which means you defer to him, but from what we can tell it is mostly in the bedroom as I am in charge of you both outside of it. You, Mr. Potter, are the omega, which may sound like you are in the bottom of the chain but you will be in charge of carrying any children we may want and of their care as well. This will be the hardest part for you to follow, as I know you are used to doing whatever you please, but due to me being Alpha you
“My fault?! If you didn’t jump in front of Malfoy everything would be fine! You wouldn’t look like a freak and they wouldn’t be stuck with you as a bondmate. Just leave us alone Potter, we don’t want anything to do with Slytherin’s whore!”
Ron went in right after the Slytherins and found a seat diagonal to Malfoy. He made sure he was at the right place to be able to spell anything he wants into the cauldron while not being seen by anyone else. Harry sighed and just sat beside him, Hermione sitting with Neville behind them.
And so Harry entertained Malfoy by telling him about his so called school adventures. He started with first year, and when he explained about Quirrell dying Draco was so shocked he spit out some water he was drinking.
“Leaving means they win. Plus Professor Snape would not be impressed with me if I’m the cause of us missing class. Just leave it as is and once we leave I’ll change it back. Draco, it’s nothing I haven’t dealt with before. Last year was worse so don’t worry.”
“Sev… Stop. Take a look at how you feel inside. Try and feel his feelings. This is real. He is not just exaggerating.”
“Right, and you need one of us with you… Let me just grab a book to read, I don’t think the professor would be a good choice right now. Are you sure you’re ok?”
“Thanks Theo, no one took the time to explain things like this for me but it makes much more sense now. I may actually be able to pass my potions owl with you as a partner.” Harry smiled widely looking up at the tall boy. Theo on the other hand just nodded his head while looking down at him.
“Right. What about quidditch? Am I still allowed to play? And what about spending time with other Gryffindors that may still want to see me?”
With that Draco started walking away catching up with Pansy and Daphne while Harry and Theo slowly caught up with them walking quietly. Once they got to the Great Hall they were all stared at once more. Harry had almost forgotten the article that was printed in the Prophet since Potions surprisingly went with no problems from the Gryffindors. But now that they aren’t only with Snape he can tell that they want to get back at him for his so called ‘betrayal’. Luckily, when he sat down and looked at his schedule he noticed he had Charms with the Ravenclaws after lunch, so he can hopefully postpone his confrontation with the Gryffindors for a little longer since this was his last class before the weekend. He planned on staying in his rooms for most of it trying to catch up to classes, both new and old.
When it came to his third year, a confusing time of time travel and godfathers and werewolves, Harry tried to keep his story as accurate as possible. Luckily, Malfoy knew most of this thanks to Snape and didn’t require Harry to confirm any of it.
And just as he realized that he felt his face heat up and knew he was beet red. Well this was new. At least part of his bond will now be easier to deal with if he really had feelings for Malfoy. He had to admit that he wasn’t being too much of a prat at this moment and he did seem nice when he spoke of his so-called adventures.
Harry was really getting worried, what if they didn’t believe him. What if this pain was going to come and go forever and he had no way to deal with it. He started to cry out in pain again. It was almost worse than before, the pulling feeling felt like something inside him was getting stretched further and further away. The pain was getting so strong he started having trouble catching his breath.
“Malfoy, do you know if this changes anything while we’re at Hogwarts or summer vacation or anything?”
Snape stood right up and yanked the letter out of Draco’s hand to read the address. He paled right away and basically fell back on his bum on the bed in semi-shock. Then he started to get red and angry and stood right up and stared Harry in the face.
As for your hand Mr. Potter, I have healing ointment that will work much better than Murtlap Essence. Come along.”
They both walked quickly to the laboratory and saw that Severus was waiting for them with a jar of some sort of cream in his hands.
“I understand you are against me for some reason but Draco didn’t do anything and doesn’t deserve to be tortured like this. If you keep going then I might actually do something about all of this and trust me when I say you don’t want me to start getting revenge…”
If only he knew what was already told to the school regarding their status and what rumors have also been going around…
“It’s the bond. It is forcing him to be around one of his dominants. That is why the pain would leave as soon as I showed up and why it started when Mr. Malfoy left the room. Mr. Potter, can you hear me?”
Snape seemed to be in his no nonsense, no favorable attitude, in other words his teacher mode. Harry winced and went to sit down with Lavender but he was pulled away and pushed towards the Slytherin instead.
Harry just looked surprised. More books? What? He thought back to when he and Hagrid did the first year shopping and realized that Hagrid was the one that told him what books he needed. So he got up and ran to their room and started going through his trunk to find his first year supply list. Malfoy was left behind at the dinner table with a shocked look on his face wondering what he said. So he got up and followed Harry to their room only to find Harry sitting on his bed with the list in his hands and tears falling from his eyes.
Snape was feeling a new feeling regarding Potter; he had a small satisfying sentiment for the boy. It was not easy what he was dealing with, but it looks like he can handle it. Draco and Harry nodded and slowly went on their way, if they had looked back they would have noticed the Professor staring at them with a bit of a proud look in his eyes.
Snape was completely serious about this too, Harry could tell. Now he was getting really worried that this would be worse news than he originally thought.
“She has this quill that uses our blood when we write lines. She has been doing this to a few of us Gryffindors and a couple of Ravenclaws as well that we noticed so far. Umbridge has only targeted people who have no guardians in the wizarding world. When I was first stuck doing this Hermione came up with the idea of Murtlap Essence to use to help diminish the pain and the scarring. Now I suppose I’ll just get used to it, it’s not as bad as I’m used to anyways.”
“You killed the Dark Lord’s host by touching his face?! You murdered someone at the age of 11? No wonder you were so messed up after that…”
“Why are you guys here? I thought I was a ‘no good liar who couldn’t tell the truth even if it saved my best friend’s life’ oh wait, then you said I had no friends and it’s no wonder I didn’t bother with the truth…”
Draco’s eyes got big and he looked down and tried to think of the feelings he got from Harry. Right now they were still showing extreme sadness and fear and he couldn’t imagine that being completely made up.
Harry looked over at Malfoy and just gave him a small watery smile. Then he huddled in bed and fell asleep. ‘
They were so involved with spelling the trunk they never noticed Snape coming into their room. Harry whirled around and pointed his wand while Malfoy just laughed at him, Snape just stared at Harry waiting him out.
Snape had blocked the feelings again not wanting to feel the sadness that Harry was previously feeling when he explained about the book list. He ignored the feelings that changed in Harry and so missed the fear that was currently being let loose.
Madame Pomfrey asked him, keeping an eye on his face as she was used to Harry lying about the pain in order to reassure everyone else. When she asks for pain from 1 to 10, a broken arm would lead to a 5 when others would say at least 8. She knew there was more to him than it seemed but Dumbledore denied her access to his full history or to exam him after holidays. She always worried that one day he would give up on any help that she could give because he would know that she hasn’t done everything she could for him.
“They were here when we found out about the bond. We explained to them what it means knowing you’d need their support. But, Mr. Potter, Harry, they didn’t take it quite like we expected. They blamed you for being ‘stuck with Slytherins’ and called you a ‘traitor to Gryffindors’ and left. I’m sorry Harry, maybe give them time to get their heads around the facts and hopefully they’ll be back with you soon.”
“C’mon mate, you know we didn’t mean any of that. Besides, you need us to help you figure out who put your name in because I recon  they want to do you in!”
And with that Snape left once again, leaving Harry passed out on the bed and Pomfrey feeling a little lost on how to help the poor boy.
“Draco, what is our first class this morning? Maybe I can just get started on reading ahead or something while you finish eating…”
“Go, I’ll sit with her and deal with it. Theo is nice and will be good with you, if anything he’ll help you raise your grade up.”
Snape on the other hand just ignore the pain he could see in Potter’s face, he knew that the pain wasn’t that bad and that Potter had worse so he didn’t bother with going gentler. He was just finishing up Potter’s face when Draco showed up all ready to face the day.
Malfoy spent another full day in bed before he was allowed to get up and walk around. His scarring was minimal and barely noticeable unless you knew what to look for; it only looked like a silver tear by his right eye. His most severe injury was his right shoulder from when he and Harry fell from the explosion, but that was now healed completely. Harry on the other hand still had burns all over his left side of his face, arm and chest. It was slowly getting better but was still red and raw looking and still hurt when he moved in certain ways. Malfoy made sure Harry knew that he was healed and how he looked almost good as new and how he was able to finally leave.
’ Harry sighed and took a deep breath before opening his eyes and grabbing his wand to check the time. 5:30. He jumped straight out of bed and rushed to his trunk to grab what he needed then ran to the bathroom to get ready before Snape showed up. Harry showered and got dressed and made it back to the bathroom just before 6 and realized that Draco was still asleep. With wide eyes he went to go wake him up unsure how Snape would react to Draco not being ready, unfortunately he was too late.
Draco walked out and sat in the chair that appeared and just decided to give his thoughts a break and opened his potions book to study while Harry finished his detention. He had enough thinking going this day and his mind needed a break, plus he had a potions essay due next week.
Harry shook his head, no he didn’t think he needed those kinds of spells; he supposed Ron decided he didn’t deserve the Weasley sweaters anymore, he was just lucky that his map and cloak were still in there. It was just unfortunate that winter was coming and he had nothing warm to wear any longer, those sweaters were his warmest items and he depended on them during the coldest season, especially since he’ll be in the dungeons now.
“You mean Weasley stole them. I did see him burning something outside yesterday when Snape took a turn trying out his new potion on you. I thought he looked unusually happy. What were they?”
“Right. I forgot about that. And you are sure I’m the omega? Does this mean I can’t have a job or friends or anything?”
Harry was a little shocked and disappointed that this meant he couldn’t keep the classes he had with his friends. Then he remembered that he had no friends at this time so it wouldn’t matter. So he figured he’d ask about other concerns he had.
Harry kept his head down when he spoke.  He knew that both Snape and Malfoy had a passion for potions so he didn’t want anything that he said to be seen as an insult or something. Snape sneered while Malfoy just looked confused.
Draco on the other hand was just about to leave the room to use the bathroom himself and just nodded to Harry and left the boy alone. Draco was unsure what to think of Potter’s attitude and how friendly he himself was being as well. While in the washroom taking his shower he tried to figure if his new status was the reason he was pitying Potter and being so unlike his usual self. ‘He is my omega now, maybe I’m just feeling the beta attitude quicker than we expected… Oh well, it doesn’t matter, we’re stuck with each other and things are better with us getting along.’ Draco nodded to himself, finished in the washroom and walked back to their bedroom, he noticed Harry was already asleep and so quietly crawled into his own bed and passed right out.
He took a moment to calm himself and looked deep into his connection with the boys to see if he can feel where they might be at. But all he felt was Harry in pain and Draco feeling peaceful wherever they were. His Alpha feelings did not like what this could mean, but he knew that if Harry was hurting that Draco wouldn’t have anything to do with it so they must be separated in some way.
Snape was frustrated that his so called bondmates didn’t leave him any notice on where they were. He was hoping that Draco at least would leave behind a note or something but looking around their rooms he found nothing at all.
Draco turned around from where he was getting dressed himself, and just nodded walking out the room and towards the bathroom.
McGonagall jumped a little when he started speaking, she was not expecting him to still be in her classroom. She put down her notes, took a seat at her desk and looked over at her former lion cub. She did notice that other than his scars he did look very drained and weary, she felt a little bad for him, but at the same time she wasn’t sure what she could do or could have done to help at this time.
Well. We can only say that we at the Daily Prophet don’t fully agree with the duo. There is nothing wrong with bisexual relationships or A/B/O relationships and we support those relationships completely.
“Sorry sir, I had a rough night. Potter kept waking me up due to his dreams, he didn’t stop crying either. I don’t know what he was dreaming of but it was hard to sleep through his reactions.”
Blaise looked over the paper once more. Then he realized that Harry and Draco were no longer at their table.
“Oh, Harry, we didn’t mean it! We were just confused because everyone thought you put your name in the goblet and even the professors seemed so sure about it and you know how I get about rules, I thought you were just looking to break more of them after everything Sirius said your dad was like…”
So, he continued the lesson, ignoring Harry but treating Draco even better than before. Theo was very confused, wasn’t Harry his omega? Why would anyone treat their omega this way? He felt bad for Harry, he could tell that Harry was feeling very down and it seemed to be affecting his potion making as well.
“Thanks for trying Malfoy, but I’ll have to get used to it anyways since we’re in the dungeons and I know we’re under the lake, seeing it just makes it more real.”
“Potter got to you didn’t he? You pity him or something, and you believed all his lies about his so called adventures. I wanted to talk to you about that because I don’t want you played by him. Those so called adventures are all lies, Dumbledore reassured all us teachers that Potter, Granger and Weasley were never in any danger and that he was there with them the whole time. He just lets them get away with lying about what happened because he likes the stories they come up with.”
Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger seem to be of mind that Mr. Potter caused this bond to formulate since he couldn’t help himself but try to be the hero. Now the left side of his face is apparently completely covered in burn scars, including his left arm and so he stands out even more with more scars. Even Mr. Malfoy has some scarring on his face and Professor Snape on his hands. But according to the duo who wrote the letter, if Mr. Potter didn’t jump into the explosion this bond would not have happened and everything would be extremely different.
Back to the main story, the letter I got was from two very close personal friends’ of Mr. Potter’s who were very shocked and unimpressed with the results of this so called accident. In their minds Mr. Potter shouldn’t have been anywhere near Mr. Malfoy when the potion exploded and they believe that Mr. Potter may have jumped in for no reason, causing him to receive permanent scars and an unfortunate outcome involving Mr. Malfoy and Professor Snape.
“Severus, was Scarface faking again? Seriously, Potter, don’t you have better things to do than annoy everyone around you?”
And before Harry had time to reply he noticed Ron levitating a leech that was semi juiced and dropping it in Malfoy’s potion. Harry reacted without thinking and ran towards Malfoy, he jumped in front of him, startling Malfoy to try and push him out of his way, Harry just pushed right back.
Pomfrey looked disappointed, as if she wasn’t sure if she should believe him or not. Harry looked down, he didn’t understand what happened, the pain just vanished and he couldn’t explain it.
With that dismissal she looked back down to her notes expecting him to be leaving her classroom. Harry wasn’t going to let it drop but Draco, who waited for him at the doorway rushed to pull him over and just told him to drop it.
This is just one example of what this potion can do. If you want more examples please turn to page 3 where we have a page full of different cases of the potion being misused.
She got up and opened the door waiting for Harry to get himself ready to face the world once more. He slowly got out of his chair and nodded to her as he left the room.
Once the hour of class was over Harry felt very comfortable with Theo and appreciated his help so much.
“Faking it for attention Mr. Potter? How typical. You are just lucky that none of the potions I was working on, for you by the way, were in a crucial stage. Now stop your attention seeking and be good for Madame Pomfrey or I will deal with you as I see fit.”
At this time the boys are still healing and not much is known but from we can see Mr. Potter will be considered an honorary Slytherin and shall be no longer considered a Gryffindor. Unfortunately this will change some things for both houses but we shall have to make the best to get used to this new situation.”
Harry sat back down and leaned back against the pillows on the bed. He grabbed his glasses from the side table and winced when it touched the left side of his head. Then he finally investigated his left arm and left side of his chest. It seemed like he healed quite a bit thanks to Madame Pomfrey, but the skin was still raw and red and very sore looking. He touched his face and could feel that it probably looked the same as the rest of him. Then the pain started up.
“This is a healing paste of my own making. It will sting a little when you put it on but just for a few seconds, then it should numb your hand and hopefully heal it nicely after a few days of using it. Now, as for Lucius, he is a close friend of mine and he knows that I would stop him from kidnapping you for the Dark Lord. As for his status as a Death Eater, keep that to yourself as he is doing important work with this position. Draco, go ahead and start that letter for your father, I’ll make sure it gets sent tomorrow morning with my owl.
“A lot of luck? I honestly couldn’t tell you. Every year there’s something and every year I come out worse for it but luckily enough I come out alive. This year I have Umbridge now this bond of ours to deal with… Who knows how I’ll be at the end of the year considering we’re only in October...”
“You left our rooms without notifying me where you were going, you didn’t leave me a note or anything. Then when I felt Mr. Potter in pain I couldn’t find him. Draco, what were you two doing that caused you to feel at peace while Harry here was hurting?”
Harry was a little unsure if the other two would even want to try food he made but he just had this feeling that he should make sure his beta and alpha got fed. He knew the potion in him was causing that feeling but it felt like second nature to do this and he was one to follow his instincts. Now if only the other two followed theirs.
Malfoy walked towards Harry’s bed when he stepped on something. He picked it up, saw it was an envelope and put it in his pocket for later. He sat on the bed at Harry’s feet then Harry sat up and just sat beside him. Malfoy decided to hold his hand.
“What? But they’re so detailed and specific and he has scars that go with what he says. I mean, I’ve heard some people lie before and usually they can’t keep their stories straight, but these events that Harry has gone through are very well thought out if they’re not real.”
And with that both of them left, stomping their way out of the infirmary and out of Harry’s life. He was officially done with them. He wasn’t going to forgive them, not this time. He gave them a chance and they ruined it. He was done.
“Harry, I apologize for making you feel you cannot trust me. I understand why you feel this way and I will try harder to be a better Alpha to both of you. Now, as for this, how was this accomplished? She obviously didn’t use a knife or something did she?”
Draco on the other hand went straight to his desk and started his letter for his father. He knew he would get in a little trouble for being so late with an update on what was going on. But he hoped that his father would understand that things have been a little hectic on his end and this was the first chance he really had to write to him.
“That makes sense. Now, what about you? When will you spend time with us as our Alpha? I mean Harry and I will be spending most of our days together so there’s no worries there but we need to get used to you as well don’t we?”
“I have no idea why he hates me. I never even knew about Magic until about a month before the train. Plus my relatives locked away my books so I couldn’t even read some of them before classes started. Then during our first class I was writing down what he was saying, I was looking forward to the class so much because it sounded so interesting, but he thought I was just not paying attention and then asked me those hard questions and I just tried so hard but nothing I did was good enough so I just gave up. Nothing I do will be good enough for Snape and I have accepted that, and now that he’s my Alpha nothing I do will ever be up to his standards and I’ll just have to live with that.”
He felt like he couldn’t breathe. He still hadn’t seen Ron or Hermione or anyone else from Gryffindor.
She hummed then turned to her potion cabinet and brought back a few of potions for him to take. She made sure he took all of them as sometimes he denied the need for certain ones, but this time he didn’t give any resistance, knowing that he probably needed the 2 pain potions and the calming draught as he could still feel that non physical ache in his chest.
“Let’s just say that Harry being known as a Slytherin is not something the school is happy about. You know how they think of us; now imagine a powerful person being thought that way. I’ve heard the words ‘The-Boy-Who-Became-The-New-Dark-Lord’ a few times already. And the Gryffindors… They are so unsupportive. Most of them are calling him a traitor and a deserter, some of them are even angry at him just because they found out he won’t be able to play seeker for their team any longer. They’re all acting like he chose to leave Gryffindor for our house and that Harry wants all of this. It’s disgusting is what it is…”
“Harry, when it says slice they mean in thin strips from the long way down. Otherwise it’s considered chopped and changes the potion since the item dissolves differently. Didn’t you get the book that shows the different chopping and mixing ways?” Theo asked. He was very confused as Harry was listening to the professor, just not doing what his own notes says.
At that point Professor Snape made himself known. He was proud of Draco’s response to the circumstances, and considering everything tried to understand Potter’s state of mind.
“Mr. Potter! I realize that you were getting frustrated with the situation, but there is a reason I am around. Yelling in class like this is inappropriate. 10 points from Slytherin, and 5 from Ravenclaw. Now everyone put your wands away class is about to be dismissed.”
“Sorry sir, you startled me. We were just spelling my trunk so that others can’t get access, Ron already stole some stuff from it and I just don’t want to chance that happening again. Malfoy was teaching me some new spells to do this.”
Theo looked down at Harry and saw that Harry was actually partially amused about that, but that he also looked like he might be putting himself down. He wasn’t sure what to say this time. Thankfully Draco decided to show up and take over the conversation.
“What do you want Potter? We have better things to do than to spend time with Slytherin’s new playmate.”
“Do not say his name. There is a reason we call him He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. All that explains is why you have detention and how Umbridge is taking advantage of her position in giving you so much detention… Why didn’t you tell another teacher about her detentions? But you still didn’t explain why you were in pain.”
Draco sighed and decided to trust Harry and just keep his head down at this time. The other Slytherins were not completely happy about this but followed their lead. The Ravenclaws at this time just kept changing Harry’s outfit feeling unhappy that it didn’t seem to be bothering him. So instead they targeted Draco. They changed Draco’s outfit to super girly looks. Skirts, pink tops, or just a pink bra at one point. Draco decided to follow Harry’s lead and ignore it but everyone could tell he was getting super angry and annoyed. Then out of the blue Harry just blew up.
Draco was so shocked to hear Harry say that, and then Harry broke down even more and just cried so hard that Draco didn’t know what to do. He took a step back and walked into Snape. He turned around to talk to him but saw his face and realized that Snape was thinking Harry was faking it again.
“You were able to fight off the Dark Lord’s imperius curse? How many times did he crucio you? How are you still alive Potter?”
Draco on the other hand finally came to the realization that Harry is not one to lie, he may hide the truth or change the subject, but he wasn’t a liar. Which means everything he has told him so far were fact, his so called adventures and that letter!
After they sat down all of the Slytherins turned to look at them, staring at them as if expecting an explanation right there and then. Harry blushed and looked down, hating all the attention he was getting. He could never get used to all the stares. Draco on the other hand just held high and ignored everyone, getting right into his breakfast. When he noticed Harry was ignoring the food he nudged him.
Before Harry could even start to think of a reply Draco was sitting down beside Lavender and Snape was glaring at him. So he rushed to the only spot left and noticed Theo nodding at him and gently moving the stool out for him to sit on. Harry smiled at Theo and sat right down getting ready to start class.
“Detention already Potter? Are you trying to beat a record of some sort? Now, why were you in pain? Obviously you must have done something to yourself since you were under the supervision of a teacher.”
He let Harry’s hand go and went towards the floo to call Malfoy over. Pomfrey was the only one who noticed the tears in Harry’s eyes as he processed what was just said.
“Draco. Your dad was there when Vol; I mean He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, tortured me after the tournament last year. Why would he help me now? Won’t he just take this chance to bring me to the Dark Lord to gain respect or whatever from Him?”
Snape and Malfoy were at first surprised when he just showed his hand. And then they both growled when they saw the blood, both grabbing his hand and trying to see what exactly is happening for him to be bleeding.
Harry dreaded going to the chamber but he did promise Draco and he could tell that he was excited about the idea of seeing Slytherin’s chamber. Besides, Harry wasn’t sure how far in they would be able to go due to the cave in at the entrance, he figured he better remind Draco about that.
Harry spoke quietly, hoping that they believe him and that they don’t think he’s in detention for any real reasons.
As claimed by Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley: “Harry is a parseltongue and has always shown Slytherin habits. We are not surprised that he is now part of their house. What does make this a little surprising is that he hasn’t fought it at all and that is why we are no longer supporting him as a Gryffindor. Any true Gryffindors would have fought this situation tooth and nail and would rather suffer than be a Slytherin.”
Harry winced and looked down. He didn’t know what to do. He’s pretty sure that he isn’t supposed to tell anyone what Umbridge is doing to them. He slowly looked up and saw that the professor seemed pretty angry with him and it made him unsure who he feared more, Umbrigde or Snape…
“Wake up Potter. You’ve kept Draco up most of the night so I think it is only right you stay up all day so that you actually sleep tonight and hopefully keep your dreams to yourself. Now, stand up so I can put this salve on you and hopefully be finished before Draco is ready and with us.”
“Gay! You can’t be gay! You wanted to date Cho remember? And being Gay is an awful thing! I can’t believe you Harry! Don’t talk to me again until this so-called bond stops messing with your head.”
Back at Umbridge’s office, Harry has been carving into his hand for the last 45 minutes. He knew that Umbridge enjoyed his pain so he tried very hard not to show just how much it hurts. For the last 15 minutes she has been doing nothing but staring right at him, making him feel more awkward than anything.
Snape nodded agreeing with that statement. Unfortunately he also knew that without any results there was nothing they could do, especially if the pain came and went in such short bursts.
And with that the door opened and Professor Snape, with hair looking a little greasy due to potions and black eyes, was at the entrance staring them all down.
“Leech Juice, sir. It uses the leech anti-coagulant and reverses the effects, but if too much is used the potion can become uncontrollable and may even explode causing other outcomes depending on the stage of the potion.”
But before Draco could try to reassure Harry the post came and with it came the Daily Prophet. Everyone looked up and grabbed a copy as soon as they could, Draco included. Harry though was not registered to get a copy since he didn’t enjoy the way they did the news like last year.
“No ma’am, I just get in real big pain if one of the bondmates isn’t nearby and so I had to have one of them with me. If there’s any other way of doing this just let me know.”
“Seriously? Ron, this is your fault! You had to sabotage a volatile potion for revenge even though we told you it was a bad idea! And Hermione, even if I wasn’t in this bond I’d still be gay, I just realized it myself but it wouldn’t have changed that at all. And of course I wasn’t happy that I’m bonded with two people who hate me, but there is literally nothing I can do! Having them more than 2 kilometers away causes me intense pain, I have to be physically close to them, but that doesn’t mean emotionally I am attached, which just makes this bond even worse. I was counting on you two to stick by me this time and actually be my friends!”
Harry was waiting for him, watching the owls outside the Emporium but never daring to take a step towards them or offer a word.
“Hard choice that.” Harry was far too pleased with himself and Draco blamed the phone call for it. “Care to help me up?” He shifted forward, as if Draco would fall for this act.
Draco wasn’t sure how he could try to provide Potter with any reason why this magic had not ruined his life. Why hadn’t Hermione thought of the using the seeds of the Casting Trees? She must have considered them despite their main use being potion ingredients. They were fine examples of how nature was inherently more magical than humanity. Why hadn’t Ginny been the one Potter whisked away in the night for help? Or the best friend that followed him into-- Wait when did Ron return to the Aurors? Draco was out of the loop so much he’d flat-lined.
“One.” Half-price because Draco wasn’t in need of hoarding his money but two hundred galleons to gush over thestrals was an affront to common sense.
He relaxed as it seemed the next few customers were adults. And then Draco wept. Why by all that was good, was Potter and Weasley here? Maybe to warn the owner how awful this place smelled, the polish was giving Draco a right headache.
The other exhibits were just as barmy as the last and Harry seemed to have more fun watching him react than seeing the beasts.
“You wish I was that easy.” Harry choked and spluttered and Draco found for sometime after the spark, the motivation to go about his day was brighter, easier and the staring into nothingness didn’t happen quite so much.
The Manor didn’t alert him to anything during his time away and Draco grew more moody as finally, the voting day arrived.
Another shake of the head and Draco tried to follow the logic. Moran and his father might have assumed he’d taken up a Healer, when instead he’d asked Blaise for help. Had Siobhan died because of him? Because Moran assumed the Healer in his house - and she had left a few times - was for him.
Freshly baked pastry filled the air and Draco resisted the urge to stop what he was doing and look at the divine meal which branded itself into his head and made his mouth water. That was what Harry was expecting, for him to pause in his work and have no excuse.
“Okay, look,” Draco levitated his cup and used his wand to add water, till it was filled to the brim. “This is what everyone is with their magic, it’s full. The strength of that magic depends on each person.” Draco flicked his wand up and some of the water separated, “When you use your Will to complete spells, your magic isn’t lost, it’s just not available in that person at that moment.” He grabbed Potter’s cup, who had it clasped between two hands and didn’t put up any fight for it.
Harry might be very mad, or not, Draco couldn’t tell, only he seemed to be so tense, hands clenched into Draco’s robes so tight he could feel the tremble. But now, Draco rambled unable to think of how to backtrack if Harry was somehow offended or thought to find no truth in these words. So, Draco kept going.
“Really, do you ever listen?” Draco yelled, desperate for Harry to unsee the letters, the failures, the embarrassments. “Lotty.” Furious as she blinked into the room, he did not stop as she twisted her ears, “I thought I told you to take these away. It was a simple task I gave you. Why can’t you listen?”
Draco rubbed away the guilt that must have shown on his face, “Scorpius, there isn’t a force on this earth that would make me ever want to up and leave you.”
“Aren’t you going to ask why?” Scorpius mashed his ice-cream into a slop. Lotty was happy enough to refill the topping and chopped chocolate additions as Scorpius poured more and more in.
And then it happened. The whole tray flung itself against the wall, the table - hit with an invisible sledgehammer - splintered down, down, down, and the newspaper, crumpled and folded, tearing itself into pieces. And the doors all closed - and opened - and Draco could hear the strain in the Malfoy Manor’s wards and magic. It was furious. And the windows started to show cracks but not shatter entirely and Draco gulped at the sight.
Mary was a short, plump woman much older than Draco was and seemed to smile more. Draco imagined she was the type of woman who thought of every positive thing before a negative. Her eyes and mouth were wrinkled by a life of full smiles. She marched straight over to Draco’s cage.
He was calm in giving the crup a pet on the head, a few stokes over its ears and Draco wasn’t sure how he was supposed to stop and tell the brown-eyed (cute) crup to leave. Ever. Absent-mindedly he checked what Harry had handed to him in more detail.
Sadly, unlike what Draco would much prefer – to start from scratch and make the Manor look different, the laws were clear. He wasn’t allowed to simply demolish it, even if he owned the blasted thing – another Twenty-Eight interference. Refurbishment, restoring it was all Draco would be allowed to do, add on a room here or there. But to remove the dungeons? Why were the pureblooded families so paranoid on keeping a legacy; Draco couldn’t understand that one.
They were having dinner, no doubt no different from the other food they’d eaten before. The only difference was how Draco felt about it. Bloody Merlin – what was he supposed to do now? They’d eaten together last time.
Damn right. Sandra, Sandie whatever her name was rolled her eyes and blew a blonde wisp of hair from the front of her face. “Sure. I’m guessing this is the one he was talking about? Come on you,” she held her arm out and Draco was impressed at her ease at being near an unknown owl. Must have some experience then. Maybe spent days in the Owlery a Hogwarts?
It would be easier for Harry to bond with someone like Lily or James who were similar and within the same little Hogwarts House. Albus, an outlier, by his own words didn’t hold his father as highly as his siblings. All of that, and it was still none of their business.
Breakfast wasn’t burnt, as much as Lotty claimed it to be and there too sat Siobhan, back in her working uniform. She played with her food, didn’t greet him as he entered.
I’m not going to die. Maybe he was surrounded, maybe it was just Scorpius, Draco couldn’t tell – another memory of Astoria played off in front of his eyes.
“Is this another attempt to get me out of the house?” Harry liked to think he was being sauve and subtle, his shoulders hiking up said otherwise. Where did Potter want to go? A question which wasn’t unique to Draco after so many years of Hogwarts. Leaving the Manor might be the best way to start. Either Siobhan or Moran (or his father) would try their luck. “I’ll send Lotty away. The Manor should alert us - Wards and all - if anyone tries to break in.”
“Since when are you two so pally?” Ron spoke up and Hermione scowled but said nothing in his defence. He was pissed, trying to keep his cool in a way unlike a Weasley. Draco wondered if Ron had already decided not only in his involvement but on his guilt too.
“Can’t manage another bite of this,” Draco huffed, not even a complete corner had been finished off.
“We only have to see them,” Harry said again - that was all he kept saying today. All Draco had to do was pick one. All he had to do was take a photograph. Harry better not think of coming in here with his Invisibility Cloak and stealing it because even if that was tempting - quite bloody tempting, maybe that was it - Draco would be found out in days at the theft.
He buried himself into the ever sturdy Harry, grateful he didn’t ever falter when it came to people. Harry hugged him as tightly as he could. The words he said weren’t important. What Draco listened to was the lull in words as Harry breathed and Draco tried to slow his own down. If left on his own, Draco was sure he’d smell that decay again, the rust on iron and have no way to stop his legs from giving out. He hated this house.
Neville tried to explain why, Draco would stay pessimistic to the idea - no one would be able to hit him. A bee? Why would anyone think that was cool? Even Draco’s owl form was much, much cooler – and being honest – elegant than a silly bee.
“I’m fine,” Harry said again and Draco knew now what Ginny was talking about. Would Harry ever admit he had a problem? Not simply, ‘I can’t sleep’ but talk about what the nightmares which followed him so easily.
Tipsy? Not good enough. Draco tried to spell another down, but to knocked into another and like dominoes the flutes all fell, shattering and spilling everywhere. But the one Draco wanted floated down, unharmed and Draco wasn’t sure how many of these he’d had tonight.
‘How are you-’ Draco paused and he glanced to Harry, blob of hair at his shoulder and the crook of his neck and Draco stopped. This house was a prison, some parts of his life mistake after mistake and still Harry hadn’t thrown him in Azkaban and pointed his finger at him whenever anything went wrong. He settle himself against Harry’s ridiculous hair and continued.
The Auror uniform was a nightmare borne from the one simple fact: it wasn’t fast to take off by any means. Too many buttons - too many small buttons at that - and more than enough stiff material when pulling it over Harry’s head it seemed to stick and freeze and make a fool of them both. Maybe Draco was just erring into the desperate category as he swore at three buttons of the vest - some faerie wax bullshit that made Draco hiss at how ridiculous this was. He’d Vanished the fucking thing, he would, and Harry seemed no closer to helping.
“She didn’t mean us any harm, she could have killed me and blamed you. I don’t think she’s bad.” Harry snorted then, “The real Siobhan is a piece of work,” Harry faltered and paused as he dropped the tied together pages and thought out loud. “Makes you wonder why she’d pretend to be a crap Healer considering she was so keen on having her own clinic.”
I am going to be writing pretty fast, and while I know that might mean there will be some more typos - I will be going over it after it's completed. But any major errors, let me know, I don't want it to end up awful! :L
Right. Potions. Cauldron One was smoking, purple swirls that jumped over the others before dissipating. Cauldron Two and Three were quiet. What was the difference in recipe? Ah, more thorns less fang of arachnid.
“Been a bit busy,” Draco sighed into his flute glass and stared down at the crowds. The ballroom was full and spilling into the garden, the house itself enjoyed the new magical cores visiting. If they spoke a compliment or two, the Manor preened under the attention and Draco forced himself not to be too happy over it all. Lotty would be glad.
Harry pulled a face and shook his head. The idea Fornax was a person didn't seem too crazy an idea but Potter didn't entertain the idea long.
Draco returned home as an owl, sat on his roof and tried to calm. Did he hope for Blaise's innocence? Even if he did, even if Blaise was another victim, how could Draco ever think, even fathom to move past the betrayal? How could he explain his feelings to someone else when he couldn't name them? When he could barely move on from the rage and hurt into anything else. What could he say? What was he supposed to say? Should he say he was glad Blaise was under Theo's Will all along? For how long?
“It’s ridiculous. Absolutely, bloody ridiculous.” And still Potter was still able to stand and talk with ease. Adults using these were sapped of most energy, unable to walk or cast the simplest of spells. Potter hung around, waiting on a third like it was a maths problem.
Draco noticed how Harry stopped himself from rambling. Now, it was his turn and Draco wasn’t sure what facts he could hand over without some knowledge of one of the worst times of his life revealing itself. “I was alone. My mother and father left to some party, somewhere.”
Lotty was meticulous, though her skills didn’t extend to people. Every blue bow was a near replica of the others and the candles were perfectly the same height - Draco wasn’t sure how she managed to have so many candles have such a variety of blues and white flames. A buffet of elf-cooked meals sat on the longest wall. Draco nodded, he agreed. The floor was gleaming, the walls bright even against the night. Thankfully no rain had turned the garden into a swamp and it left those who found the Manor too much a chance to leave but not the party in itself. What had Draco worried was Hermione’s facade dropped.  “Are you okay? The news about Astoria and all…it wasn’t fair of the Prophet or--”
He never meant it, had any control over his magic when asleep. But Draco shook his head as Harry approached him. Held onto Draco’s arms as if he’d fall if he didn’t.
“Are you sure, Hermione?” Potter’s turnabout was a curious thing indeed. His anger, the magic and glare previous melted away and now was left looking at Hermione as if she was talking nonsense. Perhaps the idea Draco was this owl - Fornax - was too much for his brain to process.
Draco wasn’t sure how much he liked the idea Rolf knew about his animagus form and he found himself annoyed. He told Astoria everything, he tried to reason. But he had thought Luna would know not to chatter about this. It was her husband. No secrets and all that, Draco sighed again. He wasn’t sure he was allowed to feel betrayed at this. He nodded and he made their way to a charmed room, one which no one but he - well, Harry too - could enter.
“Scorpius, a minute.” Draco was going to show him the second best place in the Château. Piquing Scorpius’ curiosity was such an easy, effortless thing. “Let’s go have a listen in,” he whispered even as they left the sitting room.
Potter was annoyingly naive at times. Did he really not see why? Even he, Draco Malfoy, someone who had already had Potter stand up and say to everyone else he wasn’t actually a Death Eater still made sure not to be seen near him. Just in case any disaster was blamed on his presence near him.
Grand staircases opening to a massive floor that could hold every Pureblood in Britain. Draco was pretty sure it grew or shrank depending on who visited. This year was the largest he had ever seen it, stretching on and on. It would seem Opraceius Manor was trying to be impressive, the most grand ever, this year.
The lights flickered, hissed and went out and in the darkness Draco could make out both Ginny’s and Harry’s expressions well enough. She didn’t so much as place the box down as much as drop it.
When Hermione and Harry reappeared, it wasn’t with the great camaraderie of last. She was pliant and calm, much like she was in the morning at work (before everyone piled on and ruined her goodwill).
Harry then, no doubt thought Draco was being difficult and as Harry left, so did his appetite. No one would ever give him an apology or sympathy again because he wouldn’t read the letters sent his way. And who would ever dare to speak such admissions out loud for others to hear. He ached now to read and send letters, to return to his life before. He missed Luna’s, filled with confusing gibberish which would make him laugh and wonder.
Draco looked back to the tallest, a hulking and madly intimidating load of paperwork. Harry knew what was there, he’d looked at it. He was scared of it.
“You were dying, I saw it,” Scorpius croaked and Draco relented, hugging him with one arm – the other immobilised for it was too sore on his stomach to lift any higher.
Weekends Scorpius returned from more trials and training, chatting and keen to brag. Mondays meant meeting Neville and lamenting over cooking followed by some attempts at casting a Patronus. Attempts that made it clear Draco was less Bad and more struggling Good, white smoke dyed black in the air before the breeze stole it from his wand.
A bit. Probably for the best. As if it were read in the future, the phone dinged again before he could hand it over and scold himself for the impulsive streak.
“Of course you did.” The smarmy grin was back. Harry kissed him hard and Draco was certain of the embarrassment on his face. And then it was back to the kisses tugged with teeth, and roaming hands. And he was too giddy, too nervous to proposition Harry again in the same way he’d done before. So he said a word, one simple word where Harry could happily remove himself and Draco could cool himself down by drowning himself in a cold bath and regretting said word.
“I was covering for you!” He waved his hands around, “You were muttering about Astoria and having a shitty dream.”
Harry tried to stay as quiet as possible but every gasp, every murmur of his name made Draco eager to join, see if he could make Harry louder, lose all control. Starting at his hip, he trailed down while Harry swore again. Either the teasing was too much or Harry was just impatient but grabbed his wrist, guided him down.
“And? I’m Draco Malfoy. That says more than enough. I’m a man of my word meanwhile Luca clearly isn’t.” He was winning him back, a half-smile if anything tugging at Harry’s lips.
“You’re eating it. Part of it.” Draco was glad at the change in topic and went with it. Not like informing Harry he was correct was fun but it was better than the alternative. Harry’s smile crawled back onto his face and Draco wanted to flee then Of course Harry Potter was a smug bastard. He was never going to hear the end of this.
Nothing really could prepare Draco for this place. Upon arriving, at what Harry named a ‘Theme park’, Draco wasn’t entirely sure what the theme could ever be, perhaps some sort of scenic torture for the sadomasochistic types. He could hear the screaming, the shrieking and shouting from here and the odd metal railway which looped round – all the way over itself – it all seemed impossible without magic. How could they build such metal snakes without it?
The excuse was, he was busy. Each and every time Harry tried to ask, tried to talk that’s all Draco said. Then Draco remembered the coat and relented, “I suppose not.” He wasn’t too sure how he felt over Harry wanting to kiss him back then. He could still see Harry’s pupils widened and consumed, how eager. Draco cleared his throat and his head of that image. It was a strange thought, Harry wanted to kiss him back then.
“Be with you in a bit,” Draco called back turned to see the smile was faded now and she was watching him like she was about to read his mind, “Mother.”
Harry must have said something, several time over as he pushed himself away from the wall and stood next to Draco, looming over to have a look in the cauldron. “You didn’t hear a word I said, did you?” Draco didn’t hear much with the way Harry kept on muttering.
“You read my mind,” Draco joked, as if anyone could. Especially not Potter. Heavens he lacked a certain finesse – instead of being mist seeping into the cracks and weak points of someone’s head he’d be more like… Like a battering ram, going for the biggest most solid door.
Even after the war, or rather The War, Draco still made mistakes. It was a rare and noteworthy time whenever he made the same mistake twice and today was a lesson Draco had forgotten. He was meek in the presence of Luna, inside her home, a study with numerous hand drawn pictures of strange and unreal creatures. She hadn’t looked him in the eye for an hour. She held up a wooden box for him to take, some rune-like engravings around the lid. Hollowed out but empty Draco examined it as Luna composed a reply to the mystery sender.
Ron and Hermione didn’t know. Ron and Hermione didn’t know. What alternate dimension was he in that Draco Malfoy know more of Harry’s business than the other parts of the Golden Trio. Bloody Potter what was he thinking? Hermione stared at him and Draco paused in his task to meet her eye.
“Dad.” Draco closed his eyes. How could a word be both be the most annoying winey noise ever created and also a word he was pleased over? “Please, just check. Albus isn’t having fun. With potions. Something has to be wrong!”
The letter wasn’t cryptic. While it wasn’t a riddle to solve, the plainness of it said how much Nott was no longer having fun – no longer hedging his bets as Draco assumed earlier. No, a warning, clear as day and it was awful, truly awful news. How bad did his situation need to be to warrant Nott’s mercy?
Such fierce loyalty. Draco returned to the desk, peering out into the open plan of small cubicles and desks.
“I think it might be Draco Malfoy’s.” Harry saying his name had Draco move forward a little, curious and also cautious to see if this was just a test. An elaborate plan to see if he had sentience. Potter co-ordinated plans with several departments, it wasn’t outside his capabilities.
A million worms swirling in his gut weird. Most days they saw each other alone, no pretext and no worries over whatever they decided to do. It was secret. No judgements from other people to consider. Even the days he slipped into Harry’s office, they were always hidden away. But this was outside, people watching and Draco wasn't sure where to look or what to say.
Draco was silent. So silent he wished his presence would disappear between these tacky seats and devour his very memory of this. Whatever this was and why he was here. Thinking his questions might be answered was not wise; he had more questions especially to what Harry was carrying in a bucket. Food. In a bucket. What were Muggles?
For one, Draco left Harry to locate how many bottle of butterbeer or FireWhiskey he still had in this place while he dressed down, showered and tried to let the warmth of the water ease out some of the tension.
It was tense few seconds, Harry looking as if he’d start firing hexes and Draco was tempted to cut his losses right now. Leave and find somewhere else to hole up and hide.
A strange calmness took him then, his heartbeat no longer the thudding sound in his ears. And he felt around in his pockets, maybe he should hide the rings again. Only his fingers came across a thin parchment and Draco blinked at the now blood-stained ticket. It had been quite ridiculous, really. To think Harry liked him enough to pull him out into the world of Muggles - something Draco once said to despise and want gone - and show off their freakish animals.
“I can’t even pick it up.” It wasn’t even a ring anymore. A splatter of metal, burnt and dead, no longer carrying any curse or any promise. “I love Astoria,” he croaked and Harry tried, he did try and Draco could tell he was trying but he couldn’t - he couldn’t.
Maybe it was the FireWhiskey, maybe it was the disappointment and the trepidation mixed up with the adrenaline, maybe it was how ridiculous such a response was but Draco laughed till his face and stomach cramped.
“Circe,” he whispered. Curling up into himself might be dramatic, too telling to Potter if he saw it but… How was he supposed to cook a Muggle meal? How much trouble had his pride landed him in so far? “I’m so fucked.” There had to be a way out of this.
“In case you haven’t noticed I’ve had a lot going on. I haven’t exactly had the time to gush over thoughts of how I feel.” Not a clue, Draco considered saying. He certainly liked him now, no way to split that fact up. He certainly liked going out with Harry even if it was all Muggles and lacking magic. “So if you are waiting to hear some soppy love confession or a depraved admission of me wanking while thinking of you – be disappointed.” Draco grinned as Harry’s nervousness devolved into trying to smother him with a pillow.
“Hope it’s okay for me to stay for a while, Mr. Malfoy.” Still in the habit of looking at his shoes in his presence.
Draco went back to the Manor and immediately left it when he arrived. There wasn’t anything here for him and ever since taking Scorpius away, the Manor lay quiet. He was curious on one aspect of Harry’s life. Was his Home Away From Home not warded at all?
Harry nodded at the command as if the Manor would not heed Draco’s words alone. He rubbed at his neck, held it there until Draco thought he might throttle himself.
He slipped his other hand behind Harry’s neck, pulled him close. A kiss that was slow, more tormenting than necessary with teeth grazing at bottom lips. Specs were discarded behind him, his hand anchoring to the side of the desk. All the while Harry kept trying to pull him onto his lap – not happening in the middle of the Ministry, Potter, Merlin have some awareness, please for – the distracting buzz of his daydreams faded as Harry slipped his fingers down his neck, his collar stretched. Finally some relief.
“Where’s the other two?” Draco hadn’t seen much of them but surely it meant only good – Scorpius and Albus had taken the advice to leave, unharmed. Harry began calling on Albus and Scorpius to reappear. Wherever they were hidden before couldn’t have been too far away as they apparated back. Draco nearly died at the sight of his son popping back and honing on the sight of blood on his clothing.
They’d go round and round and round with this pleas of help and refusals. They couldn’t keep going like this.
Taking the balked silence, Draco stood. Harry didn’t shift as Draco led him, hand around trembling wrist, to the closest pensive in the Manor. If Harry had fought him on this point, had pulled his hand away and fled Draco could at least argue back and set aside this panic welling up in himself too. They walked in silence, the occasional scuff of Harry’s trainers reminding Draco this could be it.
“We dealt with some things separately. I don’t need to know about every little thing. Whatever it is that wakes you up Harry - you need to deal with it.” Harry didn’t need to voice how much he didn’t believe the words Draco was saying, so Draco didn’t leave anything up for debate. “I can’t really help, potions and all that, don’t matter, you still need to get the help you need.”
A dream of Astoria dancing in white and Harry trying to pick him up from the fields he was laying in.
Out of everything, Draco never thought he’d feel disgust over anything Harry did but right now. Nothing could halt the blame, the damnation – how could anyone ever hurt their wife and consider themselves fine? How hadn’t Harry rushed to be helped then? How could he be so wrong?
“I find you terribly inconvenient right now. Enough.” Draco said to the house, wishing commanding generations of magics and protective charms was not so much like parenting. It slammed the doors shut again and Draco decided an early night would be helpful.
“We are talking about this when we get back.” His nostrils flared but he was far from sulking, if anything Draco was sure if Potter was adamant in his protection they wouldn’t be leaving, just reinforcing and doubling wards and protections.
Folding it, awkward and unknowing what exactly he should do - did he return this? He’d leave it here. The room was darker now, only able to make out the whites and several greys of the room itself, black blots being the door and this Muggle robe-not-robe. On his table sat his dinner, no note, no indication of who it was from and it was clear it was from Harry.
Oh the pity. This was a Lockeheart of Potions. All chatter no substance. Why had Albus taken this man as his potionmaster was beyond comprehension. Harry must have interfered. No one decent at potions would ever believe this ‘writing out’ behaviour acceptable during the Optimal Time. Why-- Why even bother?
Really, he was pitiful. He wanted attention and lamenting over not receiving it, he wanted to blame it on Harry. Had he grown at all throughout the years? Didn't damned well feel like it.
And Draco couldn’t stop it, not even as the ring started to whisper warnings and cries of his ancestors.
Oh, he thought Draco was going to have an existential crisis over this. His family name mud and everything he’d ever been told a lie - that was worth a crisis at the tender age of seventeen to twenty. A freckle was nothing and Potter was watching him as if Draco was going to need all these bottles of FireWhiskey to process it. He was dramatic, yes. But not Blaise-level dramatic. Draco had standards.
“Galleon-chasers are a thing, Harry. They marry or play mistress. It’s a little sickening really. How they could live with themselves spending someone else’s money.” Siobhan scrunched up her nose and snarled -  not in Draco’s defence, he much assumed someone she knew was similar to the stereotypical galleon-chaser.
Most gave him a glance, some lost their focus in their paperwork and might not even know he was there. A few liked to coo at him and coax a few pats or prods to his feathers. One of which the young man yelling earlier, who had no more than a few years on Scorpius, sat in Auror robes not well-fitted. A bundle of blond hair washed with brown. A quick look at the name said Ollie. Another Auror, one familiar hissed under his breath.
Scorpius didn’t speak until Harry had left. “I hate him. I never want to see Albus bloody Potter again.” He rubbed at his mouth.
Unlike the proud, preening idiot he expected to see, Harry was talking to Hermione, seemingly furious. What a bloody idiot. This whole night was for Hermione, anger directed at or near her did not help. What if someone snapped a picture right now? They could paint such a grand story and nothing factual. Draco didn’t hear much, other than Hermione’s objections and the name of Ginny being brought up only to die as he sided up to the two of them. “I suggest you both smile. Else people are going to notice.”
This was awful (the towel was fluffy and warm and not so awful and soothed the sharp pains that ran up his legs and down his wings). But Potter cooing over him was not on.
Draco wondered how he hadn’t heard it before, the harsh and ripping sound of uneven and unsettled breathing. It hurt to listen to, like a vice crushing his quick extinguishing anger. He’d been wrong. This was all his fault. What was he supposed to do? How did he make this right?
“Thanks.” Scorpius pulled a face. “I think?” His once too tired feet practically skipped to the Floo. Menace. An absolute menace that boy.
Taking a second to calm, to not think about how much pain awaited him, Draco lifted his wand, shaking and jerky in the air. Just focus. This last burst of adrenaline was more likely the very last his body would manage. Draco hated gambling against odds, people had some way to even the score. Odds, odds were never in Draco’s favour.
“It’s boring in here.” Harry looked around the room and Draco caught the sigh. And that was a jump in conversation. Again.
Draco had no idea what that turn of phrase meant (why ducks, why sitting, why was a duck sitting bad?). An explanation never came and Draco wished Muggles didn’t have so many sayings involving animals. “And?” He pretended to agree minus the duck part, all he had to do was not get off his face with FireWhiskey and it wouldn’t be an issue. As if Draco would hand people he hadn’t seen in months ammunition against him.
It took some manoeuvring, Potter silent and face like a smacked arse - Draco chapped the letter box before waiting. The footsteps were fast and unlike what Draco expected, it was Lily who answered the door.
Freya shot him another foul look and Draco met this one only because Harry seemed to be losing his temper. Whatever plans Harry ever had was never completed because of his poor lack of self-control.
When Harry collapsed onto the bed Draco sat the newest potion down. Without taking in the sight of the new one, Harry drank fast and after still gasped for breath.
The Chasers which remained unharmed were better, more agile on their brooms but Draco couldn’t say he was watching them with much interest. Hurry up and get Scorpius in the air.
“What’d the Healer say? You okay?” Harry said as Albus hovered by the door, motioning Scorpius over.
Albus had appeared every now and then throughout the months, Scorpius usually close behind. The kid hadn’t taken up his offer to hide away once. A Potter through and through, despite the differing interests.
“You didn’t hear it from me: Aurors are hunting Moran and his father down as we speak.” Hadn’t Moran just been scolded and told to leave the Emporium alone? Had Harry really managed to connect Siobhan’s death to Moran and his father? Promising. Maybe Draco wouldn’t need to disclose anything else.
Draco snorted, hiding his nerves. He remembered, Harry didn’t care about reputation or how to garner favour from other families. “You’re not going to win.” He snatched his hand away, burnt nerves reminding him while he walked away he was playing a game he knew nothing about.
Wilks ran a hand through his hair in a dramatic fashion that did not ease the worry Wilks wouldn’t leave. What if he followed Draco everywhere? What if he decided to question why Harry Potter was running around Diagon Alley with Draco Malfoy.
His anger, the insult which came with the flirtation, that he was all but a payment to further someone else was enough. In Siobhan’s defence, he wouldn’t have been so angry if not to be reminded of bloody Anthony Wilks. A man half Draco’s age and still keen to have the Malfoy fortune, in some form. Draco hadn’t managed to say anything back then, Blaise and Nott had laughed their arses off.
“Is he? From Blaise I take it,” Draco trailed off, knew he still couldn’t say a thing about magic. Lie it was. “He’s got the impression there’s more Dark Wizards around. He’s quite adamant I know them.”
He chatted with the Muggle, who sat behind a desk and again she pressed some box and out spewed some parchment from the table itself. Whatever currency Muggles used it wasn’t Galleons or Sickles or Knuts and Harry handed over both paper and coin and received that spat out parchment and Draco was very confused on what was even going on. A transaction to entertainment but Muggles had no Quidditch, no Dragon Wrangling. What did Muggles even do? What was Harry paying for?
The sheer blooming excitement over the possibility of having his own was too much. No. No. Draco couldn’t expect Potter to understand. He couldn’t begin to hope for one. It was a dream, a dream that as a father unable to give his son, wasn’t allowed. He bit his lip, hard to stop him from sounding grateful. All Harry was doing was speaking. There would be no crup, no one would sell even Harry Potter one if they knew it ended up in Malfoy’s hands.
“My healing spells aren’t great, but it should help.” His healing spells were by far terrible and he cast the same spell several times before it slowed the bleeding but it failed to staunch it completely. Fuck.
“Harry.” Explaining wasn’t allowed, Blaise had shut him out as much as he could and Draco whimpered.
A few places might suit Hermione’s needs. But only one suited Draco’s. Here. Many tales of torture and pain were told about the Malfoy Manor and while he had no intention to make Hermione walk over the floor she was tortured on. Although he would bet the garden with its fancy peacocks and mazes and the ballroom which was large enough to host many hundreds of dancing wizards and witches would do more than a prim empty office somewhere else.
“Liar, such a shitty liar,” he spluttered it out, choking on the words themselves. “Go on, go. Leave.” Harry scuffed his feet. See? He was going to apparate away, go again because things were too difficult. Boo-fucking-hoo Potter. The world became less shaky, his stomach less queasy.
The Greengrasses would, along with any other allies of their family would rise to meet this. But Draco could not. It would hinder the argument Daphne would use: anyone who believed this was a fool - that it held no merit. Draco responding was exactly what the Prophet was hoping for and Draco was glad to disappoint the glorified gossip rag.
Still not close enough, the little voice said and – no - Draco pulled back, determined to have some answers. It was difficult to get the words out when he had to air in his lungs and he was far too interested in Harry’s tongue darted out to wet his lips.
“Blaise said nothing of the sort,” Draco sniffed, he needed to tell Blaise a few things. His potions were as lacking as they were in school.
“Oh, he’s probably a little annoyed to be treated like a silly owl. You know what’s going on, don’t you?” She gave him another scratch between his eyes and Draco did have to wonder. Did Luna know?  All she did was smile at him and he knew why some people were unsettled by her. He couldn't get a read on anything she was thinking.
“Do you expect me to accept that as an apology? Boohoo, you didn’t think - and I’m the one who has to deal with your bullheaded way--”
“Maybe I’ll leave this to the Ministry.” Blaise dropped his arm and looked triumphant. Draco leaned forward and whispered, “One.”
It was so easy, closing his eyes and ignoring reality. “I bet I could.” Draco was finding it very difficult to concentrate on the words Harry’s mouth was forming.
He’d been cursed, confuddled – somehow he found that endearing all on its own. Forget it. Priorities: Harry dressed and out of the bedroom before Scorpius potentially Floo’d back home. He was not mentally prepared for what madness Scorpius would ask never mind what he would say. Draco needed some tea and food before he even thought of the possibilities.
“Well, if I have to see those at the door I need someone else to sacrifice the stares to.” Siobhan didn’t appreciate the joke but relaxed once she realised it wasn’t true.
Harry was tired, his eyes back to being dull and far away. The same gauntness that seemed to remind Draco he’d never really been better. Just better at hiding it. “Harry.”
“Did you really have the Philosopher's Stone?” Harry was trying to look interested in a book, flicking through it and pulling faces as he tried to decode the Old English. Something about law again. Harry hummed. Not enough. Not enough information. Keep cool. Pretend...
Three routes of play reared its head. One: Draco could leave and in time reveal to Potter he knew or use it against him. Not the best manner to deal with this kind of lie. Once Draco revealed he knew, then Potter had no reason to speak the truth and ultimately could deny everything and Draco wouldn’t find out why. Why in Merlin’s name was Harry Potter keen to stay in the Malfoy Manor? Did he not trust Draco with so many Dark Artefacts? Or was this more Gryffindor bullshit to try and protect Draco from another attack?
How many memories played out, Draco couldn’t count, too many of them were forgotten in a haze of sounds not from them but from the world around him he could not see. More sounds of shoes on the stone stairs.
“Don’t take any nonsense if anyone insults your fur - it’s the same colour as a Malfoy, that’s obviously better than all those other mongrels.” The crup listened, and Draco stroked and gave it all the pats the other crups missed out on.
“So you’ll dismiss this as just any other old Dark Artefact you’ve seen because you think you know what they can do?”
Yelling out, Draco shoved away the weighty darkness. Blaise’s voice still whispering in his head. Sticky, insidious, the pressure only increased no matter how much Draco pulled away.
“He did good, now he’s useless. We got hammered in parchment and it’s his fault. Thinks ‘e can do whatever he likes.”
“Lotty did not want her inside the Manor. The gardens are too good for Mrs. Nott, Lotty said so. Lotty will curse Mrs. Nott if Master is harmed. Lotty will do the same to Master Harry Potter too if he disrupts the Manor again.”
She fled away, red on her face that more matched Gryffindor’s banner. Draco shuddered and returned to stir a cauldron.
“Secondary school. He followed me about with his little cloak, Longbottom.” Neville frowned, like he hadn’t a clue what he was talking about. Like he didn’t remember when Draco stamped on Harry’s face like that mad hippogriff had tried on him. Like Harry never spoke about it and made himself out to be the victim in his creepy invisibleness sneaking around looking at him.
Another month slipped by and another. Neville mentioned his somewhat distant friendship with the Golden Trio these days over a pint of novelty Butterbeer coloured red.
‘Draco Malfoy is firmly in the Mudblood’s camp. Try Zabini. Idiot could use some money. Probably could sway his vote.’
“Can’t wait. You've a week to do your absolute best.” He always did like Lotty’s enthusiasm. She left, humming loudly to herself.
“Blaise, I think I might be dying.” Whether it was the effect of having all the wards in the house which light up Draco’s head, kept him from falling back asleep, he wasn’t going to be of much use. “Blaise?” He repeated his friends name for a long time, only to realise he was no longer beside him.
Blaise was… Well, he wondered about Blaise and what way his vote would fall. Abstaining was always a possibility. “He’s acting a little off, though did claim by having the party at the Manor I’ve placed myself in harm’s way. Blaise never tells the whole truth even if he knows it. I’d imagine he was holding onto that information since the venue was announced.”
Draco sighed, rubbed at his forehead and decided if they were doing this he didn't need to do anything else foolish. “At least, let me make sure the Floo's closed.”
“Can’t really blame him, eh?” Weasley’s attention was thankfully on the old man and his valiant rescue of Draco. And Mary’s involvement in mending him for a few days. Mary was a shop assistant and she had most certainly done more than what he said. Draco remembered her keeping him warm in her robes as she rushed him here, her voice a steady stream of platitudes and promises of treats.
He was sweating as Draco started to dissect the lies he spoke, and those nearby were happy to watch him fall. The crowds appreciated an arrogant sod falling. One thing Draco understood more than not now was arrogance and bragging did nothing but dig under everyone’s skin. Another couple, who did not entertain him in the slightest were not interested in him. They were Hermione’s guests and so Draco excused himself too. Bumping into someone, he turned to apologise and make up for his lack of grace only for him to realise it wasn’t his fault.
It wouldn’t be fair, would it? To have him slip in at night, that would be raising expectations. Ones Draco couldn’t even begin to fathom right now, not in this headspace. Not with all these other emotions unravelling. Draco returned to his room keeping his footsteps as quiet as possible. He paced around, couldn’t slip back into bed, no chance he’d sleep like this. He was too hyped up on this anxious energy.
Draco was worried then. The Manor was constant in its effort and Draco knew if Harry was as tired as he claimed then it wasn’t a fatigue he could fight for long. Hermione just patted the cover over his legs and she stood up, “I’m just happy to see you’re okay. Another time. When you’re feeling more up to it.”
“Are you sure?” If he were to guess, Albus and Scorpius were going to shut off and refuse to speak with each other. Not until this James nonsense was dealt with and so Draco agreed. He'd use no hexes or jinx, for if he could – he might cause more damage than he wanted.
He ascended the stairs, picked up a champagne flute from one of the many floating trays. A drink, the perfect distraction. Let others’ think he wouldn’t answer because he’d rather drink.
“How is he doing?” Draco asked at two in the morning, aching shoulders and neck from hunching over book and tome. Siobhan didn’t answer and Draco refused to look up to acknowledge his own concern. It was a passing comment, nothing more.
“Scorpius, I’m fine.” Somewhat. “I’ll be fine.” He corrected once Scorpius pouted and didn’t believe him. “How about a drink?” A tad early, really to drink but this was a unique event.
A fluttering feeling settled in his chest and Draco took another swig of his drink. Right. Well, he could easily make this a point of conversation. Though having Potter involved might help, Draco couldn’t think of how awkward that’d be - to have Potter thank him, in front of everyone and yet not really believe it himself. Potter wasn’t dying, certainly his magic was crazed and feral but dying was an exaggeration. One Draco wasn’t keen on accepting. Because the only time he did almost meet Death was as a result of his flawed and foolish plan a desperate Harry Potter hadn’t baulked at in the beginning.
Highheels clinked against the ground and a grey-haired witch with squared specs made a beeline for him. “Harry Potter, a pleasure.” Freya shook his hand, smiled at him and only did her facade drop when she spied Draco. “I’m sure you’ve been told Mr. Malfoy why we cannot allow a crup to be purchased by you.”
“Sorry,” he told the adorable beast. Really, he wouldn’t mind even a quarter-pup because clearly no one else would adopt this one. “You’re stuck here, aren’t you?” If Draco had been brought into this room as a child, he wouldn’t have wanted this either. Because it wasn’t what a crup was in the Wizarding World, it wasn’t like the other status symbols or small and easier to hide away. Draco Malfoy wouldn’t have given this one a second glance back in the day. Time changed perspectives and Draco was certain this one was meant for him: clearly the breeder at least had taste - the bloody thing was practically the same shade his hair was.
So, Harry putting his arms around his neck was the first step in confuddling him. A distorted thought that if Harry so wanted to hurt him, he was the perfect height to headbutt his nose. Astoria was quite short in comparison to Harry, Draco always had to crane his neck down awkwardly for a kiss. But Harry didn’t do that. He kissed him again and instead of leaving it as a failure, as a cheap gimmick even Draco could muster for anyone he didn’t stop. And then Draco’s plan died a death in fire and confusion. Because he was snogging Potter.
“You don’t have to prove anything to us, or anyone for that matter,” Hermione says, her arms coming up to squeeze around his waist. “We just want you to be happy,” she repeats.
“Oh my God, can you not?” Draco moans, lifting his face to look up at the ceiling before fixing Harry with a scowl.
“Jolly good of you to finally arrive at the lab, Malfoy,” Finch-Fletchley starts, his irritation making his plummy accent sharper. He runs a hand through his hair, pushing the floppy strands back. “Not to have you fly off into a bate, but Goldstein, the total ass, ruined the Amortentia samples we were cultivating with the new compounds. Ruined, absolutely ruined! It’s bad luck and we’ll have to start from scratch—”
He doesn’t know what he’s mourning anymore in these nightmares—the war, his father, his ex, his friends, his own guilt, despondency, or meaninglessness in life. Draco closes his eyes. The pain rips through him as he struggles to draw a breath, tears pushing against the back of his eyelids. He whimpers.
Draco huffs, waving a hand dismissively before crossing his arms against his chest. He tries to keep his voice even, affecting nonchalance. “
Draco looks away from him, staring down at the table. “I can hardly look at you,” Draco hisses, low and full of pain.
, Malfoy?” Jordan mutters darkly. Draco’s brows knit together as he tries to recall if he’s said more than two words to this man in his entire life.
Harry growls as he leans his solid weight against Draco, swiveling his hips so his hardening cock cants against Draco’s.
Irritation shoots through Draco with a sting. He levels Finnegan with a bored look. “I merely said that your singing is torturous, Finnegan. Clearly, I’m not the only bystander who believes this,” Draco drawls, gesturing to the patrons who are currently pretending not to be listening.
If the Healers here were literally using human flesh and blood to somehow recreate or understand the links between DNA and inherent Dark Magic, who knows what kind of torture and body modification they’re causing their subjects.
It’s then that he makes eye contact with Malfoy; his grey eyes are bright, the defiant look from earlier slipping away for just the briefest of moments. There’s a flicker of something he’s never seen on the other boy’s face. He can’t bring himself to acknowledge what it is – but he knows. It’s soft and vulnerable. Gratitude.
Kreacher sounds as if he's about to cry. “Master Black is being the sole heir to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black! Not even Harry Potter is being this, Sir, but Kreacher is being dealing with Harry Potter’s need for Kreacher to wear clothes and take wages! This is not what loyal elves to the House of Black should being doing, Master, and Kreacher is hoping that Master Black is here to be setting to rights the order of this family!” Kreacher cries, still in his deep bow.
“Do you think you can give us some privacy?” Potter asks the officer who nods and continues walking down the corridor, leaving them alone. Draco  feels too hot, his heart beats too fast and – oh Merlin, he can’t breathe. He gasps, eyes darting around the empty corridor in panic as Potter reaches for his hand to gently tug him into the closest men’s loo. Potter places a hand on each of his shoulders when the doors shut behind them. “Look at me, Draco.” Draco cuts his eyes from the garish blue tile of the men’s floor to Potter’s gentle gaze. “I want you to take a moment and meditate with me here, yeah?” Potter asks soothingly. Draco finds himself nodding. “Close your eyes. I want you to breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.” Draco does. “That’s it, good. Excellent. Let your breath just flow right from the centre of your stomach… breathe in. Good. Out. Again. Yes. See how your breathing is centring you? Gathering and pushing out all that bad energy? You’re doing so well, Draco. When you’re ready, I want you to open your eyes, okay?” Draco nods, his body calming down as the deep breathing and Potter’s soothing voice eases the erratic thudding of his heart. Draco opens his eyes and slouches forward. Potter catches him in an embrace. He drops his head onto Potter’s broad shoulder and sighs.
feel weird, calling Malfoy his friend? But it is true, at least for him. The woman is still eyeing him, but this time there’s a dawning realisation in her brown eyes.
That last observation is actually a really valid one, he considers, as the crowd becomes even more restless and agitated. Regardless, this kind of behaviour is bloody savage. No one deserved this kind of treatment.
The room grows markedly colder as the fog trails upward, now taking on an alarming texture and rancid smell, like rotten meat. The spread and texture grossly reminds Draco of rapidly growing fungi, latching onto the bare walls of his bedroom and blossoming outward. In his attempt to escape the growth, he trips and falls onto his bum, eyes growing wide with panic.
When Draco enters the kitchen, Padma is seated at the round table, Draco’s tea steaming beside her. Potter lingers in the corner, a concerned look gracing his face.
Draco’s cut off as Smith shoves him, hard, into the room before quickly slamming the door shut. Draco trips, the wind knocked out of him and his hands scraping against the concrete floor to break his fall. The sconces flare to life, then. When he looks up, Andrews is standing before him, his arms crossed against his chest.
“I knew Arthur had a penchant for muggle items when we were just kids at Hogwarts,” Molly started, a wide smile on her face.
“Merlin, help me,” Harry mutters against Draco’s now upturned lips. Draco playfully shoves him back.
Draco can hear the other man draw in a breath, catching on the exhale as a wounded sharp sound escapes the back of his throat. It’s as if whatever words he’s preparing to say will hurt him on the way out. “I really am sorry about earlier. But...promise me you’ll keep an open mind.”
“Honestly, Ron. There’s no need to be rude,” Hermione tuts, pulling out her wand and vanishing the ruined eggs. “I’ll make the eggs, yes?” she suggests. She looks down at her wristwatch. “Ginny should be here any minute and we all know she’s worse than Ron when you muck about with her food.”
From that heinous coupling comes a Squib that he tried to hide from our world. How is that fair? The Minister can hide his mistakes, but we’re forced to live with ours openly? I don’t think so, not anymore.”
“Are you going to explain to me why you have that in your possession?” Harry asks with an icy calmness, his wand still firmly in place.
“There’s something I must tell you. A secret,” Draco says. He’s still pressed into the wall, Harry holding him up. Draco doesn’t think he’d be able to stand on his own right now, his legs feel too weak.
“Oh yes. We made a video to show you all the types of love stories and advice among the people you care for. There’s over twenty interviews from your friends and family. And to complete the gift, I would like to record your story as well before you two tie the knot today.”
He cringes as he tears his gaze away from Millie’s frown. Can he talk about this with them? They’re all such a cynical bunch, he can’t seriously see himself dredging up the details of his breakup with Saeed Shafiq: brilliant solicitor turned professor and son of the Wizengamot’s Golden Star, Ahmed Shafiq. It’s not something he feels mentally strong enough to do at the moment anyway, especially when Blaise is smirking at him in such a taunting way, the bastard. Trying to clear his mind of the breakup was one of his reasons for escaping to Italy…and look how well that turned out.
It was why he felt confident as he powered up his computer and clicked on the file that was meant to self-destruct in another 24-hours, that he knew the password.
Draco turns the small snuff bullet over in his hands. There’s a bubbling fear in the pit of his stomach that’s now making itself known. He knows what it feels like to enjoy something dangerous too much. Merlin knows that the desire to be a powerful and successful Death Eater was irresistible to him long before he took the Mark. He was scared as all hell, but he craved proving himself, craved having Lucius’s approval and protecting his Mother. This cocaine makes him feel powerful, and it’s a slippery slope towards absolute chaos and fuckery.
Potter smiles weakly. “I’ve tried. There’s a Permanent Sticking Charm on the godforsaken thing.” Potter pauses, running a fidgeting hand through his hair. “You know, for what it’s worth, I think your mum would be so proud of you. For hanging on despite everything, trying to live your life the best way you can, and for saving the lives that you do, as a Healer and an Unspeakable.”
Harry’s lips mouth along the base of Draco’s throat, his tongue flicking out. Draco shivers as Harry drags a hot, velvety patch up his neck, kisses chasing after the patch leading up to Draco’s sharp chin. “Harry.
instead of accepting the injustice. Simply put, Draco can keep letting this eat away at him, or he can fully take back control of his life.
Shocked, Harry quickly places a comforting hand on her shoulder, looking over his own towards the door to see if Mrs Granger or Mrs Weasley are about to burst into the room and scold him for upsetting the bride.
The last couple of days have wreaked havoc on Draco’s system. Since breaking his fever, he oscillates between moments of acute anger to intense longing to pitiful tearfulness. Pansy calls it lovesickness. Draco always associated the term with ridiculous romantic fairy tales, not an actual illness, especially not one related to his soulmate connection with Harry. Draco wonders if this is something he’ll have to worry about for the rest of his life if he and Harry actually fall apart. Will he walk through life, not only feeling as if he’s forgotten something important, but angry and fretful over it as well? It was a miserable notion, living a half-life. He’s felt better, at least the last day, with the help of Blaise and Pansy.
When Draco turns back to Mia, she’s busy mixing drinks. Smith is staring at Draco, hard, his lips curling with scorn, but his eyes heated with a glint that raises the hair on the back of Draco’s neck. Potter is watching Smith.
Horrible scenarios tortured his mind the entire seven days, playing like a sick, demented Muggle film in his head.
He’d been in a dissociative state for the entire week, but now Ginny has convinced him to leave his house. They had decided to head to Waterstones off Piccadilly and Harry was finding that with the cold winter air, the fog previously flooding his brain was dissipating. He was starting to come back into himself again.
Draco lifts a shoulder, his heartbeat as erratic as his thoughts as he questions whether or not his entire department is embroiled in some kind of scandal involving people overdosing on a cocked-up version of Amortentia. He rationalises that somehow his scientific studies must’ve gotten out and people are now making some street drug version from his findings. And this man, Mr Graham, must be a victim of its dangerous side effects.
Draco smirks. If only Boy Wonder knew the depth of it. “I don’t foresee that being a problem. So tell me, why’d you break up with Girl Weasley?” Draco asks, resting his elbows on the table.
Harry whimpers. “Shhh...don’t cry, my love. It’s okay. He’ll never hurt you again. I promise, he’s going away for a long time. No one will
Once the tea is served, Narcissa asks into Harry’s health (great), his Auror training (also great), and his goals for the New Year (officially joining the Auror Corps). Harry asks her about her vineyard in France (thriving), her transition to the Manor from France (smooth), and her goals for the New Year (breeding rare Golden Akhal Teke horses). It’s all rather pleasant, until Harry asks:
When they had decided to sit Thea down and discuss the feelings she was experiencing, they apologised to her for not listening to her in the beginning. They promised her that from now on they would respect her decision to go by the name Thea, and to only address her with female pronouns.
“So, let’s be un-normal together,” Harry says, pressing a quick kiss to the corner of Draco’s mouth. “Will you marry me?”
Potter approaches him then, coming around the desk to stand beside him, his vibrant green eyes glowing behind his round glasses. Draco shrinks into himself, feeling horribly exposed and afraid under such a piercing gaze.
“What are you afraid of?” Harry demands, his heartbeat racing the moment the little colour in Draco’s face drains away. Harry’s eyes narrow. He’s suddenly cold with fury. “Are you afraid of what other people will think?”
Draco knows how petulant he sounds, but can’t stop the curl of insecurity that overcomes him. He hates it.
When Draco closed up the Manor six months ago, he was sure moving in with Pansy and her mix-matched set of girlfriends would be disastrous.
When Harry gets home from work he finds Draco sprawled out on the couch, a foot dangling over the edge and resting on the floor, soft snores emitting from his slightly open mouth. He has a protective arm cradling a peacefully sleeping Thea to his chest. Today Thea’s hair is a long, wild mane of jet-black curls, a thin green ribbon tied as a headband around her head. A smile tugs at the corner of Harry’s lips and he moves to drape a throw over them, careful not to wake them.
, as he writhes in agony, thrashing and screaming. When Smith lifts his wand, Draco draws in several gulping breaths, trembling. It may not have been as strong as the curses he faced under Aunt Bella or Voldemort, but the shock, the surprise of it, takes him off guard. Draco struggles to his feet as Smith approaches him, an
“Harry,” Draco says solemnly. “They’re going to find some way to punish me. If it doesn’t involve Andrews slicing my throat open, then it’s going to be exposing you in some way, I don’t know…”
“Bloody hell,” the man named Zed says, lowering back into his seat slowly, his eyes wide as he stares up at Potter. “You’re—”
“Wow, yeah, Mr Potter, of course!” the man says, giving Harry’s hand a few good pumps before walking away. Draco stares after his date, his mouth in an ‘o’ shape before snapping back to his senses and rounding on Harry with a deadly look in his eyes.
Potter tuts, crossing his arms against his chest as he watches. “Yeah, no, go right ahead,” he deadpans.
That’s all Draco needs to come, having been on the precipice of it since sinking his fingers into Bitty. The cry that rips from him is raw, pulled from his very core as he slouches forward, fingers digging into the soft fabric of the footboard. He doesn’t have a moment to compose himself before Blaise is pulling his cock back and slamming into Draco, his hand coming up to grip Draco’s neck, turning his chin to kiss him. The position is awkward and painful but Draco moans in pleasure. Blaise’s tongue plunges into his mouth in such a filthy, greedy way, he can forgive the discomfort. The other man holds him up, eager to swallow up Draco’s cries and pants. Draco is so swept up in Blaise’s desire that he doesn’t even notice when Blaise starts coming, still pumping into Draco as if his life depends on it, grunting through his orgasm.
The subsequent leer he fixed her with making her feel uncomfortable, sad, and scared. Draco hadn’t fully grasped the complexity of the situation or Millie’s response to it. He had felt confused, uncomfortable in the sense that he lacked understanding, and angry at himself for not being able to help Millie feel better in that moment. Millie stayed at Draco’s side every second of the day that entire summer she spent at Malfoy Manor, even going as far as to creep into Draco’s bed at night. They would stay up together into the wee hours, sharing hopes and fears and secrets. Draco learned how to plait her hair.
In the shower, he bites down on his knuckles. He lowers the shutters he’s pulled into place since Potter’s arrival. He allows himself to feel it,
“Come now, Granger. Surely you can give a man a couple of weeks to get his affairs in order? Gedeon will be breathing down our necks expecting results before we have the time to develop a proper anything! Let’s do some brainstorming first before we go running to Professor, shall we?” Draco asks with a smirk. Granger rolls her eyes.
“Yeah right!” Draco shouts at her over Harry’s shoulder. “You can’t help yourself—you’ll tell everyone!”
He falls back onto his bum, fatigued, shaking, and panting heavily as he stares in amazement as the Veil contains the Fiendfyre, burning from the inside, the apparition a floating ball of fire. There is a hissing and crackling noise as pieces of the marble begins to break apart, slowly falling to the ground in a powdery white dust.
“The Curse did not take completely, if you can recall. A Diagnostic Charm has shown that it is still there but when compared to the earlier scan, it has weakened significantly. You will notice that whatever triggered the epileptic fits before will become infrequent. The weakness is your arm is likely to be postictal paresis, which will taper off in about 48-hours.”
“Er, I, uh, brought you a coffee. Cream with three sugars. I know you have a sweet tooth,” Harry says, holding out the cup.
, then I’ll be just as rich as you. More powerful. Oh, what will the Wizarding World think when they find out that you and your friends stole from us,
Harry. Warm. Solid. Standing before him. Naked as the day he was born and a full beard, his vibrant green eyes showing a newfound depth.
“Oh, Mr Big Man is here now,” she says, swinging side-to-side in Blaise’s grasp before he tugs her cackling form against his side.
There’s a cackle of laughter from somewhere down the tunnel that pulls him from his thoughts about Malfoy’s significant personality change. Or maybe Malfoy’s always been this person but lacked the environment for his personality to really flourish? Harry doesn’t know, but he’s determined to find out. He finds that he can’t
The creature is sitting huddled in an armchair, a now cold cup of tea balanced carefully on the arm of it. Its legs are pulled up its chest. A sour smell lingers on it, like vomit and sweat and fear and anger and death. Harry can’t stand it. Can no longer stand to touch it, sit next to it, sleep beside it. Can no longer stomach talking to it, this creature that’s taken over his husband.
For a moment Draco glimpses just how terrified Potter is. He isn’t reminded of the magically strong, robust Auror in front of him, but of the little boy he met at eleven, thin with knobbly knees and a wide-eyed stare. Potter looks fragile.
“Merlin, that was so much fun!” Bitty babbles, turning to peer back at him. “Wasn’t that fun, Draco? I told you it would be. Didn’t I tell you? You should listen to me more often. I always have the best suggestions. I tell Blaise this all the time, poor bastard finally gave in, though, didn’t he? I told him this’ll be a night he’ll never forget. Who knows, maybe we’ll even do this again!”
Severus taught Draco how to conjure a Patronus the summer after Third Year when he told him he struggled all year in Defence. After a month of trying, Draco was able to produce a corporeal greyhound. He remembers the joy he felt watching it leap and run so incredibly fast while playing with Severus’s doe.
Fuck you. You don’t get to say that to me!” he repeats hoarsely. Dean's hand moves to cup the back of Harry’s head before leaning in to kiss him.
his mind and heart, and now his body. He doesn’t stop pressing back until his bum is flush against Potter’s pelvis. He gives a deep, chest-rattling moan when he’s fully seated. He feels so strong.
Draco can hear the slashing rain against the windows and knows just how grey and gloomy it is outside despite the tightly shut drapes. He tries to keep his anxiety at bay, but today doesn’t feel like it’s going to be a good day. He drags the heavy purple duvet down his body, but strong hands wrap around his body to pull him back under and against a hard chest.
It’s the middle of the night and he’s midway to the toilet when he hears soft crying. Pulling out his wand, he muffles his footsteps, descending the stairs to stand just outside the lounge. He can hear the fireplace crackling, and with a quick peek, sees Ginny sitting on the back of her legs before it, face in her hands as she cries.
“Yes, just give me a minute, Potter, I’m in the shower!” he shouts back, relieved it’s the irritation and not the grief he feels coming across in his voice.
Harry snorts, swallowing his mouthful of curry. “You’re a prick,” he says before setting his food to the side. “Come here, Draco,” Harry demands, his voice thick and throaty.
“Don’t you still love me?” she asks as she lowers her hands, her voice so broken that Harry bites back a commiserating whimper.
Dark. There’s simply no other explanation as to how you would die and come back the way you have without the involvement of Dark magic. You even stink of it.”
Draco slams the little folder of horrors shut in panic and frustration. All the pieces rest in front of him, but he doesn’t necessarily have enough glue to piece the larger picture together, and it’s right there, it’s right on the cusp of making sense. He
“He will be okay. Romilda, hand me those pillows over there. Pansy, Summon the thickest blanket you have. Daphne, please...just sit the bloody hell down and stop crying.”
,” he cries, his hands coming up to wrap around Potter’s waist, fingers clenching the fabric of his shirt. Now with the truth lingering between them, it makes the assault this real and tangible thing that’s wedged in the middle of his chest. It’s alive and it thrashes, sharp nails and teeth, digging into his inner meaty walls with no intentions of letting go. Draco melts against him, his thin shoulders vibrating from the force of his tears as all the tension he’s carried for the last two months comes spilling out of him. He cries painfully, his chest rattling, and his breathing heavy, the ability to stumble out an apology for falling apart like so stuck in his throat. This kind of sorrow he feels today – this sorrow cuts him deep, scraping against the bone, as if making up for the many days he’s spent trying to bury his pain. He’s crying so hard he feels as if he’s one sob away from disintegrating into a fine dust to collect at Potter’s feet. But Potter is here to hold him and prevent him from completely breaking, and in a way, has always been there, even when he didn’t fully know why Draco was falling apart. Potter always holds him through his grief.
Intrigued by this bit of information, Draco stores it away in the back of his head to review later. At his acquiescing nod, Mia drops him another wink before moving down the bar.
“Mr Malfoy. I’ve heard some excellent things about you from my dear friend Marcel, the owner of the shop you worked at in Montmartre. I’m incredibly pleased to meet you,” Mr Winthrop says. “Why don’t you come back to my office for a quick chat before I show you the labs?”
“Alright, goodnight, Potter,” Draco slurs, throwing an arm around his shoulders and squeezing. When he pulls back, Harry suddenly grabs him with both hands, pulling him back into the hug and holding him, his hands running up Draco’s back to rest against Draco’s shoulder blades, his face tucked in the crook of his neck.
Draco takes a half step back, suddenly worried that the old woman might somehow hex him through her eyes.
Potter saunters into Draco’s small potions lab dressed in jeans and a t-shirt too-tight across his broad shoulders, a crooked smile on his tanned, sweaty face. It sends a small thrill up Draco’s spine because it’s been a while since he’s seen such a playful look on Potter’s face. With an exaggerated roll of his eyes, Draco returns the smile, also noticing Potter’s awful shaggy, snarled hair is pulled into a haphazard knot at the back of his head. Potter’s hair is a crime against humanity.
Marcus grins at Draco. “You would want to know about them, wouldn’t you? Your mum’s causing them a lot of problems, did you know that? Well, they’ve even asked us to ‘take care’ of her, haven’t they Scotty?” Marcus asks with a chuckle, jutting his chin at Andrews.
” Draco hisses warningly. Harry shrugs. They’ve had this conversation too many times. Mercifully, Draco changes the subject. “What are we supposed to do in here?”
Dean is impossibly tall, his face floating above him. Harry blinks owlishly, finding that he has to look up quite a bit. Dean’s sincere brown eyes are currently filled with concern. He makes a striking figure dressed in smart black trousers, a striped white and black shirt with a black blazer thrown over it. The hairstyle he’s been sporting for the last several months are short locs styled in an undercut. Harry likes it, a lot.
“Wait, no!” Draco says, grasping Potter’s hand again. “No...I...I was thinking, and yes. I think we should get to know each other too, properly. But…you want to...date...
Andrews broke into his townhouse. A trained Auror would know how to dismantle wards, even wards as new as the ones on the Malfoy townhouse. They were updated just a year ago and there’s no blood or ancestral magic on the townhouse like there is on Malfoy Manor. If Andrews is indeed the one that broke into his home, his request for a warrant could be a ploy to investigate Theo and somehow find probable cause to investigate Draco and pin all the burglaries on him. Or, as Draco believes is happening, Andrews might be working for Flint and desperately seeking the dossier that Draco stole.
Smith steps up to Harry, shoving him back so hard he collides against the bar stools. Draco surges forward but Smith points his wand at Draco’s face. “Easy now, you little slut,” Smith says, glaring down at him. “Don’t make me hurt you in this very fine establishment.”
Draco sets down his quill, frustrated, and stares into the fire. Fuck his Amortentia project. Even if he could heal his mental anguish, it wouldn’t bring Mother back. He wouldn’t be able to see her or talk to her again. He picks his quill back up and strikes through his earlier note. He taps the feather end of the quill against his lips as an idea slowly begins to bloom in his mind.
Harry’s stomach tightens as he gasps, panic flaring hot and wild through him. His spells must have weakened or cancelled from the bloody cannabis! Draco’s hand darts out to grip Harry’s shoulder and they both scramble to their feet. A middle-aged man is standing by the edge of the trampoline, a torch in one hand and a fucking
“Merlin,” Draco mutters, shaking his head, making his way towards the Wizengamot Courtrooms. He feels like he has whiplash.
Harry lifts his hands up. “It’s okay,” and sits down next to Draco. Harry’s gaze on Draco after so many years feels like a tender, loving caress. “I never thought you’d grow your hair out,” Harry says, his eyebrows up to his hairline.
” She spits out the last word as if it left a nasty taste in her mouth. She leans forward, staring directly into his eyes.
, because that small tendril of magic Potter used to cast wandlessly and nonverbally is so potent that Draco can once again taste it against his tongue, sweet and syrupy.
Usually, Potter visits with a smile on his face and a box of candy in hand that Draco ends up losing to the whirlwind that is Granger’s sugar cravings, but today he’s withdrawn, agitated, and rude.
Potter ignores him, still staring at the open office door. “You’ll probably have a bruise on your elbow, you caught the desk on your way down.”
talented and brilliant! I’m in awe of your awesome abilities!” Draco says in faux excitement as he picks up and examines the deposition. It looks alright. He sighs heavily. “Get out.”
“More than that. We keep the potion-doused victims in the back to poke at and dissect later, if you’re interested in having a look?”
“I do not,” he says, cheeks warming in mortification. He can’t help it if he’s picked up on the tunes played on the Muggle wireless. Draco shoves him, to which Potter responds with his own shove. They begin to tussle and soon Potter’s arms are wrapped around Draco’s body.
An embarrassing giggle escapes Blaise before he slaps a hand over his mouth. He drops his hand away and clears his throat. “
Draco purses his lips as he quickly turns over Gedeon’s response, which reeked of both casual sexism and insidious unprofessionalism.
Harry rolls over to face Draco. “One of Greyback’s cronies, Sampson, took me down during a raid on illegal Dark objects. They were selling and trading them with people in Eastern Europe. It was a right shitshow, and we lost two good men. Sampson caught me off guard, tortured me, did this to my face, and took a chunk out of me. Smith arrived after apprehending some of the suspects, just in time to kill Sampson before he killed me. We didn’t have dittany or anything to stop me from bleeding out, so Smith cauterised the wound. He saved my life.”
“Say no more,” Potter responds, wrapping his arms around him, too, inhaling his scent and kissing the side of his face. “Bed?” Draco nods. “Okay,” Potter says, pulling away but clasping their hands together. Potter lifts his hand to place a soft kiss on the inside of his wrist before turning to shut down the Floo.
Harry shoves him hard, and Draco moves out the way. “Fuck you! Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!” Harry growls as he shoves Smith.
“Trapped in the Veil? Powering it? A Horcrux?” Harry sneers. “Love freed me from death,” Harry says before flicking his wrist and Stunning Gedeon.
Draco shrugs. “I’ve unfortunately been suffused with a terrible case of ennui,” he says with a dramatic sigh.
He feels so sick he might vomit right there in Potter’s lap. He glances around the room, his friends in various stages of talk. Pansy and Blaise are now snogging and Weasley has given up the game of chess to chat quietly with his wife. Daphne is talking to Luna and Theo…Theo is staring at him, his eyes bloodshot. “What are you talking about?” he asks fearfully, focusing once more on Potter. He trembles.
Harry scowls. “Fucking Zabini doesn’t know what he saw. Smith didn’t do anything wrong, and that’s that. This was my fuck up, and I’m tired and ready for bed. The full moon is in a couple of days, and you know I feel like my fucking skin is crawling even when I don’t transform. Leave it alone, Draco.” Harry turns on his heel to leave the office. Draco goes after him down the hallway.
“Please come here,” Draco whispers, lifting his hand before resting it on the side of the bed, palm up, fingers curled towards the ceiling. A few beats pass before Harry jerks one foot forward, ambling towards Draco like a calf fresh out of the womb, stumbling until he falls into Pansy’s vacated seat, his lips pursed and his eyebrows low and furrowed. Harry stares at Draco’s open hand.
“If you believe I’d do that, then you haven’t been listening to me the last few months,” Harry hisses. He drops his wand to the floor and places one hand on each of Draco’s knees. “I told you I’m here. I told you I won’t hurt you. I fucking told you that I’ll be in the truth with you. If you think I’m going to back out now, then you don’t know me at all. Why do you think I haven’t informed the team of my missing cloak? The Ministry would have rained down hell on my behalf, and if my suspicions about you were right, I wouldn’t be able to help you right now.”
That first year in Paris had been difficult. He was in a constant state of fear, and, though the magical community in Paris was not directly touched by the war, people knew of the Malfoy family’s less than savoury history and relationship with the Dark Lord. With Blaise and Pansy beside him, he felt safe navigating the occasional harassment, and, over time, his initial anxiety began to dissipate. Montmartre soon became home to them, with its colourful village-like atmosphere situated in the middle of the vivacious city of Paris.
“If we find a way to safely expose the Ministry, Draco, it doesn’t matter how many members on the Wizengamot are a part of Flint’s crew, we will arrest every single person implicated in the dossier. If our current political climate is anything to go by, you’ll get the chance to walk out of here not only a free man, but a hero,” Simmons says, his eyes solemn as he bows his head slightly.
Draco opens his mouth and then closes it, not knowing what to say or what to think, especially considering that Potter may very well be right. Draco’s memory surely can’t be relied upon at the moment.
But what he doesn’t see is the way Draco avoids mirrors. Potter doesn’t see the way he forces food down his throat when the gnawing in his stomach makes his knees buckle and his head swim. He doesn’t see the panic flash across Draco’s face when Potter places a hand on his shoulder or tucks a lock of hair behind his ear. Potter doesn’t see he’s become deft at lying. Doesn’t see Draco’s jaw clenching, his fists balling, his eyes glistening, all while saying he’s alright. Potter doesn’t see the haunted look in Draco’s eyes.
“It’s just my luck that I not only see one but two miserable bastards today,” Shafiq spits as he glares down at Draco. “Get out of my bloody way, Malfoy.”
And after being called out by Granger for Occluding, he’s been trying not to rely heavily on it, but it’s difficult. He regrets her finding out now more than ever, tucked into the corner of the downstairs W.C., knees brought up to his chest and fingers entwined and tugging on the strands of his hair. His breathing is erratic and harsh as he tries to control the dull, anguished ache slowly crawling up his chest and into his throat, making it harder to breath, his lips dry, and his eyes watering.
Draco laughs. “I think he’s just nervous. It’s your first time, and I haven’t been in ages, and we’re
Jenkins’ grip on Draco tightens, and he drags Draco backwards towards the burning Veil, the Fiendfyre swirling within it, the heads of snakes, chimeras, eagles, and dragons coming to the surface of the Veil to hiss, howl, and roar. Draco struggles against him, desperately digging his heels of his shoes in and trying to become dead weight against Jenkins.
“Ah, I’ll get you there one day,” Potter says wryly, grinning against the side of Draco’s face. A puff of breath tickles the shell of his ear as Potter clears his throat. “I’m serious, though. I should have been there for you at least at St Mungo’s. I…I just want to be kept in the loop. I don’t know what I would have done if something worse had happened to you and I wasn’t there for you. Muggles may not have wands, but there are other weapons,
Mother began to beg, apologise even, and when that fell on senseless ears, she stepped in front of Draco.
“Oh!” Hermione says, interests clear in her voice as she tilts her head back to peer at Neville. “Sounds brilliant, Neville. What plants have you been manipulating?”
Millie sits up then, her plump lips tugging into a sympathetic smile as she pushes her thick hair back from her face. Her cheeks are rosy, no doubt from the number of cocktails she’s consumed tonight.
Theo gives a wild bark of laughter, strangely resembling a rabid dog. “Maybe if you snort up my entire stash you might, mind you, my stash is—”
There’s a long, uncomfortable silence, in which Harry can’t help but stare at Malfoy’s stricken face and rigid posture, the other man’s eyes fixated on his coffee cup. Malfoy makes a soft, indiscernible sound. “I needed a change. A life away from the moral ambiguities of my youth, the crushing responsibility of remaking the Malfoy name, and all that violence waiting for me from people hurt by myself and my family. And most importantly, you— Harry
” Draco hisses. With Potter pressed against him like this, Draco’s feeling overheated and short of breath. It’s taking every bit of his control to keep the threat of unpleasant, brutalising thoughts from dragging him to a place he now only visits in his dreams. He pushes on.
“You seem hesitant right now. We can just hold each other, is that okay?” Draco nods dumbly as he clambers off Potter.
Draco nods. “Of course. I don’t think we’ll have trouble finding people. We can contact St Mungo’s and some of the local hospitals to enquire about specific patient profiles…”
He’s a complete arse! The things he said about you in today’s article—” she whispers furiously before catching herself. She draws herself up, as if forcing all her anger and tension to bleed away. “Something about…about
, even what you consider the broken bits, because they’re a part of you! When you realise that you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible, so here I am tonight, standing before you to tell you that I love, I love,
As the room clears, Harry shoots Draco a small smile and a wink before following his teammates. Draco’s about to get up from his own seat when a hand slaps him on his shoulder, keeping him in place.
“Kingsley knows that because of Pureblood involvement during his fundraising for his campaign, his position is compromised. At the moment, he’s just a figurehead and he’s fully prepared to step down once we expose the culprits attempting to illegally seize power in the Ministry. We had to think
Draco goes quiet. He doesn’t know why he hasn’t told Pansy about Potter. Blaise hasn’t even mentioned Potter to him, either, and Draco considers that a small mercy. He carries his interactions with Potter from that night like a torrid secret.
“Where’s the Cloak of Invisibility?” he shoots back, his words slurring viciously, his eyes growing wide. “What are you animals doing with it?”
“When are you going to tell Ron and Hermione?” Harry shrugs, his knee bouncing anxiously. His best mates had extended their holiday by a fortnight and he was slowly — very slowly – counting down the days till their return.
Harry feels a nervous energy buzzing through him at the perplexed, hesitant tone, and he turns to face Draco. The other man is still staring into the fire, his pouty lips tugging into a grimace as he continues to twist the hell out of the garland. “Like what?” Harry asks imploringly.
This was it, Draco thought. He had pushed aside his fears, his hesitation, all the little big reasons he’s been holding onto these words for the last month. The fear that he wasn’t good enough, or that this relationship was moving too fast, the words too much to say, too heavy to risk saying, too upsetting to say aloud in case it ends up hurting Draco because everything about them is meant to be adored in secret. In darkness. Too terrifying to truly feel, because some part of him believed that Harry did think he was
Draco nods, his hands loosely holding onto Harry’s biceps. He takes a deep breath. “Yes, I’m ready.”
As they come up for air, Potter places small, chaste kisses across Draco’s jaw and neck. Draco closes his eyes briefly as he savours the intimacy of their position. “Tell me what you want.”
, it killed Harry to stand so close to Draco but not make any eye contact with him at all. Draco had stubbornly refused to look at him throughout the entire ceremony, but he looks dashing in his form-fitting, traditional black tuxedo and bowtie, his white blond hair artfully tousled and cascading down to his shoulders.
In the couple of weeks since Draco moved into Grimmauld, Potter sees him restless, pacing in the middle of the night, aloof and withdrawn. Sees him riddled with nightmares. Potter sees him arguing more, or curled up in bed still in pyjamas that are now becoming too large for him. He sees him avoiding his newly-built potions lab. He sees him avoiding their friends who stop by. Potter sees him quiet, conversation now difficult. He sees him moody.
Panic surges through Draco. Some nights he still has nightmares about the Fiendfyre from the Battle. Dreams of Harry not reaching him in time and falling into the violent flames torment him throughout the night. Conjuring it wandless and expecting to control it sounds impossible.
Padma stands from her stool, holding her hand out to help Pansy out of the bed. “Come along now, Pansy. We need to give them some privacy. And Harry,” Padma starts, turning to face the doorway. “We both know the situation could have been a lot worse. Draco needs to recuperate. Please make sure he rests.” Padma then pauses, visibly swallowing as she frowns. “We will miss you.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, we are arresting you under the suspicion of larceny, breaking and entering, and animal endangerment. You do not have to say anything. But, it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on in front of the Wizengamot. Anything you do say may be given in evidence,” Auror Gibbons says as Bitty begins to laugh.
“No, it didn’t.” Granger draws in a wet breath. “Draco, I think the Veil’s produced a manifestation of Layla’s grief and fear, of her lack of consent, and now she’s trapped in it.”
The whole top floor is an open space that overlooks the sitting room and consists of a low, massive king size bed. There’s a nightstand on either side of the bed, with a pile of books sat on top, fairy lights the same colour as the Leaky’s hanging over the bed. Floor-to-ceiling windows line along the back wall that overlook a garden, one window cracked, allowing in cold air. There’s a door that’s slightly ajar, the peek of a bathroom beyond it. A soft armchair and ottoman with a small side table is to the right of the bathroom door, across from it a long, wide bookshelf that lines the wall where Harry’s wardrobe and chest of drawers also are. The sheets on the bed are a deep, royal purple. Draco pictures Harry in the middle of the bed, naked, gorgeous, pressed against the sheets.
“Come on, Draco. We should make our way to Grimmauld Place. I have a gut feeling about this bloke and it’s not a positive one,” Potter says, still lingering beside Draco, a steely look on his face.
wanted marriage. Otherwise, what is all this for? All the dating, the getting to know one another, bloody
Draco draws in a deep breath as he rationalises his panic away. It’s been a traumatic day. He has a lingering Dark Curse he can’t recall being struck with—and can’t bring himself to question in depth at the moment, not wanting to wallow in the fact that people will always want to hurt him, kill him, even. Potter has always been a sore topic for him, dead or alive. Draco gathers all the facts together because he knows now that if Padma can’t see Potter, the only logical explanation he can come up with for Potter’s presence is that he’s a hallucination.
comments from the people around him. This is the monster who has haunted his dreams for months. A monster who violated not just his body, but his soul.
“I’m sorry about that,” Harry says with a frown. “You caught me off guard. I mean, you were breaking into my bedroom.” Harry sighs. “The fact that Flint brought you into the bloody
“Ravishing! Do a spin for me,” Draco says, offering her his hand. She takes it with a smirk and lets him help her up so she can twirl for him. “Fabulous,” he says.
The creature wraps its arms around its legs, tightly hugging them to its chest. It begins to rock in its seat, pale face flushed, long blond hair falling to its shoulders in a tangled mess. There are stains down its jumper, a hole in its Muggle jeans and socks. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen the creature look this disheveled, but perhaps Harry had simply stopped caring.
, he tells himself with fervour as he caresses his chest down to his lower abdomen. He nods at his reflection, biting his bottom lip when he decides the idea that’s been floating around in his head for the last couple of days doesn’t sound too bad. Dean had thought it was a great stepping stone. They’ve been working towards tackling his rape trauma, body image issues, and depression. Dean has urged one step at a time, and he’s been living by that method. Last week Draco had told Potter the entire events that transpired the night he was assaulted, and even though he had to take several breaks and had cried to the point of getting a headache, he finally unburdened himself to Potter, and Potter held him through it.
Harry doesn’t even know what to say to that outside of calling Draco a nutter. “Nutter...and you love your job,” Harry says in bewilderment.
“Yes. I do,” he says solemnly. “But mother will complain about my lifestyle. She rivals Pansy in her relentlessness.”
“Remember doing that, do ya?” Harry asks smugly. He remembers the amazing time they had together that night, the heartfelt confessions they all shared. Malfoy does too if his blush is anything to go by. He sighs and takes the spliff from Malfoy. “I’ve never smoked weed before, but I’m not a Gryffindor for nothing.” Harry takes a puff from the joint, the smoke going down smooth as he holds it in. He exhales without coughing, the tendril of smoke long and curling before him.
“When I came to Hogwarts, I learned how to appreciate the moon and the stars. It made me feel a bit safer in complete darkness, relying on the constellations and the changing moons to be a sort of night-light for me. I can’t believe I fear them all over again.”
“Ya, yer fouking roight bout at one!” he responds in his most exaggerated Cockney accent. It does the job because the other man freezes immediately, lifting large, surprised grey eyes from the bottle to Harry. Only a moment goes by before Malfoy bursts into great, heaping laughs.
without the two of you, right? I just...I just need to get over her, so please...please, don’t tell me I need to think about her instead of myself right now, or ever, really, because it’s over.”
When he’s dressed and ready to go, he stands before the mirror, once more reminding himself where Lucius Malfoy isn’t—right here before him. This isn’t what Lucius Malfoy gets to claim as his sole creation anymore.
It’s clear, it’s always been so clear, that whatever sick connection Harry has with Smith has always been more than just work related. Draco should’ve known that he would never be enough for Harry. He should have listened to his own thoughts before letting this soulmate connection lull him into believing theirs was a true love.
Doing three snorts in quick succession, his hands tremble so much that he nearly drops the damned thing. When he feels a bit more grounded, he lets himself out of Blaise and Bitty’s flat.
“Potter!” calls a deep, refined voice. Harry turns on his heel and does a double-take because there is a wide, unfeigned smile on Draco’s face.
Draco tries to calm the flutters in his stomach. There’s a nervous edge to the sensation, with Draco flirting with Harry in this way. They’re teasing, but Draco knows a lot is being said between them; promised, even. He knows that he wants Harry sexually, but it’s still a scary desire, one Draco has thought about, deciding that he does want to take that step with Harry. He was sure of it the moment Harry kissed him earlier today. Draco’s scared of the moment when he has to actually open his mouth and
Draco pulls out his pocket watch when he notices that people are starting to take their seats. When he looks up, Pansy is darting between tables to reach him, dressed in a strapless, sweetheart silk champagne-coloured mermaid gown.
“Thought you’d fancy having lunch on me?” Draco says, lifting a small brown bag of two deliciously made salt beef sandwiches and crisps he picked up from their favourite place, Gaby’s Deli.
“But...but there’s someone in there I need to talk to!” Harry says, panicking. “Please...if you can just let me in for a few minutes,” Harry says, stepping forward. The spiky-haired guard menacingly approaches him.
“Yeah, of course,” is all he says before he leans in to kiss Draco’s lips. It’s a chaste kiss that rivals the sweetness of the raspberry roll. Draco pulls away.
“The snakes,” Potter starts exuberantly, moving to stand shoulder to shoulder with Draco as he gestures towards the fireplace. “I remember using the mantel to hide things.”
Barbara freezes, her eyes narrowing. “’Memba me tell you this now, Mr Malfoy— I’m no house-elf. Get your own bloody coffee. Now off with you!” she says, twirling him right back out of his office, the sheaf of parchment clenched in his hands.
“Even if we’re not together, even if you hate my fucking guts, I still care for you, Harry. I hate the thought that you’re hurting.”
“Are you sure of that? It sounds an awful lot more like cleaning up your partner’s rubbish than you actually making some kind of headway on a case or project. But what would I know? You hardly ever talk about your work with me.”
“Speaking of dancing,” Parkinson starts, stepping back to look him up and down slowly. “How about you show us some of your moves, Potter?” Harry recoils.
“Well, I for one, still want to know what the hell is going on,” Theo says despite Pansy and Millie’s indignant cries. He crouches next to Draco, his long dark brown hair falling into his face as his gaze assesses Draco. “I’ve never seen you like this before. What’s happened, you wild bugger?”
Draco he loves him. His row with Pansy on the matter of trust rushes back to him at full force. just Potter saying this to him now is so wrong – this body is
“I made a mistake, Potter. I was scared, I didn’t know what else to do. I thought Gedeon would shut down the project because, well...you’re
He can sense that there’s something lurking beyond the surface of 'cheerful war-hero Harry Potter' that’s frightening and monstrous. Perhaps even untrustworthy, and that’s saying a lot coming from someone like him. On one hand, Draco seriously, truly, wants nothing to do with the man or whatever antics he’s involved in. On the other, he wonders what it would be like to have Potter on top of him, kissing him, fucking him...
“You’re a fucking pig, Potter,” Draco says, ducking his head and taking another swig from his glass.
Pansy giggles, her usual impassive expression giving way to a warm smile. She lifts a hand to brush his fringe back from his forehead. “You hapless, lovesick fool.”
Draco glances around the chest of drawers, his gaze falling on the handheld mirror. As he reaches for it, Theo stops him.
Draco had just laughed again and twirled Harry. That was the end of that. They had never spoken about that drunken exchange again. He had always assumed that Draco had been too drunk to remember but now, well, now he’s not quite sure.
An unbearable pain he hasn’t felt in over four years takes over his body. He’s lifted into the air before he’s flung onto his back across the cobbled pavement. The impact does little to distract him from the explosion of pain from the
“I don’t know, but Andromeda never cared about what’s considered the norm in her child-rearing. She let Teddy play with dolls and wear girls clothing all the time. She must’ve known just how...different...Teddy is and tried her best to make him happy. She wouldn’t let me speak a single word against his choices. Apparently, she even let him call himself a different name,” Harry says. Draco eyes him levelly.
Draco gives a soft dizzying little laugh, his hand coming up to tug at Harry’s belt. “You’re quite lovely yourself,” Draco whispers back, his hand deftly removing the belt from his trousers.
Smith laughs again, the sound crueler than before and ringing in Draco’s ears. “Don’t flatter yourself, Malfoy. Any common little slut can give me a bloody stiffy. Walking around the way you do, you might as well be a fucking woman. Keep moving, and I’ll punch your teeth out,” Smith whispers, pinning Draco to the wall. Draco’s heartbeat is a loud thumping in his ears. He can slowly feel his thoughts shutting down as he goes pliant, trapped between Smith and the wall, fear so visceral it bleeds into Draco’s head, filling it with what feels like tiny shards of glass. Smith laughs in his face, pleasure in his eyes. “Poor, scared little Malfoy. You’re
They had done everything. Searched with magic. Searched with Muggles. Searched with animals. Hell, the department had even hired a Seer.
Harry's eyes are hard as he stares at the computer screen. When he answers, his voice is low, tight. “Yes.”
your resignation letter,” Draco says softly, making his way towards her desk. There’s only one chair in front of it and it looks as if it’s made of plastic, a far cry from the lush armchairs from her previous office. He has to wonder if this was truly a resignation or a demotion. Or both. Draco perches on the edge of his seat, clasping his hands together in his lap. Draco can rationalise the air of gloom around her; after all, she believes Potter is lost forever in death. The dead, vacant look in her eyes, however, that’s something he can’t stomach. Draco has seen Granger cry before, miserable, frustrated, silly,
. My gut was right about you because that scroll would’ve burned a hole in your hand if I couldn’t. I have to do this...
“Look at you, letting me take care of you. So beautiful, so gorgeous. All mine,” Harry whispers, slowly stroking Draco.
Draco squeezes her hand, desperation curling his words into a plea. “You know more about his situation, don’t you?”
“I did glamour him, he’s just not ready to re-introduce himself to the public. Dennis seems terrific,” she says encouragingly, changing the subject.
“I make my intentions clear before I fuck anyone, Draco. Having sex requires a conversation, a continuous one, especially during. They know what I’m about.” Harry runs a hand through his hair. “I don’t expect you to understand, you have your own set way of navigating the dating scene and sex. You’re entitled to your opinions.” Draco takes a long sip from his drink.
Trying to regain some equilibrium, they quickly turned the conversation towards working out a chronological understanding of their missing time. Potter is missing nearly six months of his life. Draco is missing any recollection of Potter, if Potter’s single memory of them is anything to go off of. Draco is also missing significant time from yesterday, not recalling how he ended up in the Ministry Atrium from his lab.
but stare at the confusion in Potters eyes. He sidles up to his cauldron to stare down into the clear liquid, willing himself not to cry.
He chokes back a sob as his fingers numbly pick at what he believes to be a gaping hole in his abdomen. He vaguely registers the coppery taste of blood in his mouth as he struggles to breathe, cursing his own stupidity and brash behaviour. But he would do it again, he would do it again a million times if it would save Harry.
After a few beats of silence, Draco weakly asks, “How the fuck do you expect me to respond to this?” Draco crosses his arms against his chest, but he looks vulnerable rather than defensive.
“I can reintroduce you two. I’m not sure what her preferences are nowadays, but I can’t imagine anyone saying no to you, darling,” Draco says, grabbing her hand and heading towards the booth.
“I sometimes come by and knock around Martin’s Mr Slush machine if it’s acting wonky,” Harry says carefully. “He repays me by giving me free slush puppies.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says once more, an ache in his chest as he takes in Draco’s face, the undiluted rage etched like hard lines in marble. “I didn’t want you to mean anything, either. I didn’t want to look at you and feel like I had found home, Draco, but I did and I’m so sorry I’ve brought us to this point. You chose me, Draco, and I-I was too late in choosing you
He stamps down the tiny sliver of regret pooling in his stomach as they scramble out of a Muggle taxi, Bitty cackling, swimming in Blaise’s jacket draped over her shoulders. As Blaise pulls out Muggle dosh to pay the cabbie, Bitty grabs Draco’s hand and leads him to a front door, the wards recognising her. Draco’s only been to their Mayfair home a handful of occasions, and he’s not able to clearly see any of the furniture or portraits in the dim light, so he stumbles through the house behind her, his own euphoric laughter matching hers. This close, Draco watches with amusement as Bitty stumbles in her high heels, Blaise’s jacket sliding from her shoulders to land on the floor as her hips sway seductively in front of him. Draco finds the movement hypnotic, and he can’t peel his eyes away from her arse.
“Fuck if I know! Leave, you mutt, go away!” Draco cries, using his foot to gently push away the jumping puppy. “I said leave me alone or I’ll—”
He’s so shocked by the invitation that several seconds pass before Malfoy turns away from his fancy coffee machine to stare at him, a pale eyebrow quirked. “Well?”
It’s his fault, mostly. He tells Pansy everything and made the mistake of telling her about his impromptu drink…date…thing with Harry, and since then her teasing has been merciless. As lovely as that night was and their subsequent interactions have been, Draco doesn’t want to come on too strong. It’s not like he’s expecting anything from Harry.
“Well, if you think so, Potter. I still don’t need a new friend.” Malfoy glances down at his delicate wrist watch. “You’re officially boring me— and that is the greatest sin of all, so I think it’s time I take my leave.” Malfoy stands from the table, looking flustered. Harry holds up a hand to get his attention.
He catches a glimpse of the man as people pile out for the loos and drinks. Potter has on his arm Luna Lovegood, who is inappropriately dressed in a ridiculous leopard print maxi dress. Potter, on the other hand, is dressed in a traditional tux.
When Draco had learned how to let go of his father, both in real life and within, he realised what true loss felt like. What’s a boy without his Father? What’s a man without a role model?
, look at me.” Harry tucks a finger under his chin, tipping his head up. Harry’s face is a perfect picture so full of concern and tender compassion that Draco feels overwhelmed but beholden for such emotions. “Whatever it is, we’ll figure it out together, okay?”
When Draco finally comes down from his orgasm, he bursts into tears, collapsing on top of Potter. Potter scrambles under him in a panic but Draco grips Potter’s shoulders. “What’s the matter? Shit, Draco, did I hurt you?” Draco draws in a stuttering breath.
“You can do it, Draco. You’ll have to pour every ounce of concentration and power behind it, but I have faith in you. You can
of surprises,” Malfoy muses under his breath, heading towards his kitchen. “How about we crack this open? Our reservation isn’t until nine…”
...with Malfoy and decided to pop over to Ron and Hermione’s. He was happy, for entirely selfish reasons, that they had postponed their honeymoon. For them, it was to celebrate Ron’s parents anniversary; for Harry, it was so he had his best mates nearby while he suffered from his most recent breakup with Dean.
When Harry grinds against him, letting the other man feel his arousal, Dean apparently pulls out of his reverie.
He makes his way towards the lounge chair, throwing himself on it, one arm coming up to fall across his eyes as he draws in several deep, relaxing breaths. It’s quiet up here, the only sound is the flow of water coming from the small waterfall splashing into the pond.
“My God,” Malfoy mutters, aghast. “You fucking arsehole, your arrogance simply knows no bounds. I’m in a
“Y-yes,” Draco chokes out, his hand squeezing his hardness, his hips lifting off the bed. “I want it, too, Harry. Please, more.”
Harry shrugs. “I don’t care how old your boyfriend is, really. And I’ve been called worse.” At this admission, Malfoy smiles sardonically at him.
It’s been two days since the night at the Leaky, and Draco is still reeling from his humiliation. He locked himself in his bedroom the day after, the reality of his new life in Britain finally sinking in. He had answered Pansy’s panic-stricken questions through the door for the entire two days he was barricaded inside. She pulled information from Draco with such a methodical ease that Draco had found himself becoming emotional when he told her about Finnegan upending his pint over his head. At the time, it hadn’t affected him so much, but thinking back on it, talking about it, the wave of embarrassment mixed with his anguish overwhelmed him to tears.
Noticing that he’s stopped walking, Smith halts his steps, turning to face Draco. “Uh, yeah. Potter wanted us to pick him up immediately so we went to go collect the bastard.”
“There was Ginny, as you know. I had an Auror partner from MACUSA temporarily, Skyler, and they were...very special to me, but it was unrequited. They just didn’t feel the same way for me. My feelings for them opened a door that I gladly walked through,” Harry says, staring down at Draco. “There was a Muggle named Jake who I dated casually for a couple of months, then Cho Chang again, for six months before she moved permanently to Australia. After her, I dated Adrian Pucey for a month, and then a few more nameless faces, before the attack.”
He’s been sitting in the soft office armchair since coming home, patiently waiting for Harry to appear through the Floo. He glances down at his watch. It’s 2am.
He freezes in shock. But when Draco’s tongue slides against his bottom lip asking for entrance, he obeys and the kiss deepens. And
Before he can analyse this any further, the doorbell clangs and Walburga immediately starts to wail.
As the tears slowly stop, Draco’s hazy feelings of panic and fear slip away and are replaced with embarrassment and frustration. “Merlin, I feel like a right tit for crying,” he says, pulling away from Potter slightly to wipe his eyes with the sleeve of his jumper.
“Wow. You sound…really healthy,” he says, a tight, worried frown crossing his face. Malfoy glowers at him. “Did you, I mean, do you, want children?”
“She’s moved to France—St. Laurent de Belzagot. Bought a vineyard out there and some horses to indulge in her love of Equestrianism.”
“Hello, Lyra! Can you please inform Harry of this message: I’m running late. Stall Blaise’s ire by buying everyone a round of drinks. Tell him I’ll bloody pay for the ceremony myself if my lateness is such a huge impact to his question! Okay, that was mean. I feel awful enough so don’t scold me! There we go, darling. No need for a response!” Draco says, watching as she takes off down the road.
Draco tries to hide the tremble in his hands, stomach churning at the idea that Potter will be gone. Gone forever. He’s too brave, too strong, and Draco wishes for just a moment that Potter wasn’t afraid, that Draco could somehow take that fear away from him. They’ve lived such separate lives, but in the back of Draco’s mind Potter has always been there. He’s always been a reminder to Draco to do better. Be better. Potter saved him, saved his mother even. Potter doesn’t deserve to be in the position he’s currently in, and it’s partially Draco’s fault.
Draco’s face contorts painfully, a grimace twisting at his lips. His eyes burn with unshed tears as he holds Harry’s gaze. He gives an acquiescing nod.
Harry’s heart is once more slamming against his ribcage, and he swallows thickly to soothe the burning ball of pressure pressing up his throat.
Pansy’s wet smile is as sloppy as her leaky mascara, eyes bloodshot and watery as she pulls him in closer. Even so, Draco can’t help but think she looks bloody gorgeous. Out of the three of them, she’s always been the prettiest crier. He drops his chin on top of her head and closes his eyes. He’d do anything to protect her.
