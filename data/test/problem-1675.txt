“But not from us,” Weasley said, and Theo felt an actual pang of sympathy. Gryffindors had a habit of garnering pity whenever they spoke. It was probably useful, but Merlin’s
both Theo and Draco said together, goggling at Potter.
The first thing that caught Theo’s eye in the Ministry Atrium was a large, empty fountain in the middle of the room, in which a new statue was in the process of being built. From what little was there, Theo could recognize a wizard, a goblin, and two other unfinished figures all standing in a circle. The wizard and the goblin held their hands out in offering to the center, which was empty.
Pansy blinked. “What?”
Blaise sighed. “The Wizengamot.”
“I just,” Potter said after a minute. “I don’t want them to start treating me differently. Everyone else already treats me differently, I don’t want them to change too.”
He was breathless by the end of it, and Theo got the impression that he was the first person to whom Finch-Fletchley had told any of this.
Theo leaned back to let Finnigan reach above him. Finnigan grabbed a box of Fudge Flies from the top shelf. It looked like the last one in stock; he had to jump a little to reach them.
Finnigan took another step towards the chair by the fire.
“Are you just afraid of what she’ll think of you?”
he was doing this swam back into his mind. He swatted it away. It wasn’t shameful to want something good for his friend, was it? Of course, there was also the threat of the combined wrath of Blaise, Draco, and Potter if he cocked everything up, but he tried to think he was mainly doing this for Draco’s benefit.
“Huh,” Finnigan said, looking thoughtfully at his chocolates. “Dean and I were thinking of staying for Christmas, just in case something happens. You don’t think it’s likely?”
“Ah,” Theo said, “that makes sense. Guess I should have run after you a bit faster, eh?” He laughed. Draco didn’t move his hand. “I like my coffee with sugar and cream,” Theo added helpfully.
He leapt off Theo’s leg and brandished the royal-blue box in the air triumphantly. “Thanks, Nott.” He turned to the counter, rethought it, and circled back to Theo. “Hey,” he said, “by the way, what day did you put your money on?”
“No!” Pansy snorted. “No, of course not. He was asking for a friend.”
Beside them, Finch-Fletchley laughed under his breath.
“Harry,” Draco said, clear enough for them all to hear, “I’m sorry.”
“But we’re done,” Weasley said, “that was all of us.”
Finnigan shoved him, and he shuffled out of the room behind the elder Weasley. The door shut behind them, and they were left in silence once more.
“Well, I’m treating you differently, and you don’t seem to mind,” Draco said.
“Still,” Finch-Fletchley finally said, “that doesn’t change the fact that I’m the worst in our class.”
“Dead,” Weasley said. “I have seven galleons and ten sickles.” He turned back to Theo. “I’ve got more upstairs, d’you want me to fetch it?”
“Er,” Theo said. “Is— do you want to talk about—”
“Mr. Nott,” Goodwin said. “You stand before the Wizengamot today to testify as a witness in Mr. Malfoy’s trial, regarding his parole served at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for the past year. Should you wish to consume
“Absolutely not,” Theo said.
“He might,” Potter said stubbornly. “He does a lot of things that don’t make sense.”
“Being nice to you directly benefits me,” Draco said, “because I happen to like getting a leg over you.” Potter flushed, but to his credit, he didn’t back down. Draco clenched his fist and let it go slack again. “Your habit of believing the best in people is going to get you killed one day,” he muttered. “I’m surprised it hasn’t already.”
Theo, Pansy, and Blaise had waited with baited breath for two weeks before Draco and his mother finally faced the Ministry. After a long and lengthy trial, they’d eventually been granted a year of strict parole, with Draco returning to Hogwarts alongside his classmates. And aside from the offhanded mention to distract Blaise and Pansy, Draco didn’t bring up the subject of his father that much.
“It sounds horrible,” Macmillan said, wrinkling his nose. “How’re you supposed to keep a clear head like that?”
D’you think he would have told me if he knew I’d be involved?”
Something outside the door exploded.
“Mm.” Theo stuffed the forkful of sausage into his mouth and chewed it thoughtfully. “I wanted to ask you about your essay. You said you were going to the library. But when I checked, I couldn’t find you.”
Yesterday, Theo would have thought the solution was obvious: side with Granger and argue with Draco like he’d done for the past seven years of his life. But if Theo’s assumption was correct… Well, Draco had been defending
Paperwork can’t take that away from you.”
“Oh, we can add your name to the list,” Blaise assured him. “I’ll take the seven galleons as a deposit; give me the rest tomorrow.” Weasley nodded, handing over the gold.
under his breath.
Draco tutted. “The point being,” he said, looking at Theo, “unless you can slip everyone else a Draught of Living Death before bed, I doubt that’s a feasible plan.”
None of them mentioned just how small Draco had looked in that chair.
Three days after the fight, Potter yanked Theo into a bone-crushing hug in the middle of the hallway, right in broad daylight and, unfortunately, right in front of Pansy.
The room had decided to be a solarium today, with glass walls and ceilings that overlooked the forest, and plush rows of plant life lining the walls. None of it was real, obviously, but Theo had to admit it was rather pretty.
“What’s all this?” she said, looking down at Thomas’s notes. “Why are you studying? It’s Christmas.” She reached for a profiterole. Theo smacked her hand away.
Potter burst into laughter. “He and Ron might get on,” he managed, once he had control of his breath. “Merlin’s pants.” This made absolutely no sense to Theo, but it must have to Potter because he straightened up, took one last look at the wall, and let out a breath. “All right,” he said at last, “I’ll give him some time. How much, d’you reckon? A day? Two?”
“I do, actually,” Draco said. The legs folded again, and they all heard the sound of a book snapping shut. Even though he wasn’t standing, it felt like they were about to duel one another. The study group was all staring in stunned silence, and everyone else around the room had abandoned their projects to watch.
“Ron, of course not,” Granger said, as though this was obvious. To be fair, Theo thought, it was a bit. “You saw him. He wasn’t supposed to show a shred of bias, and he risked that by letting Harry act as defense Witness.”
The Wizengamot members all had their wands out, now that Goyle was disarmed, but they really needn’t have bothered. Potter had it covered.
“Well, we survived a war together,” Draco said, shrugging. “I think we should be on a first name basis by now, don’t you?”
They hit Professor Augusta square in the chest. Her robes exploded into flame and she shrieked, falling to the stage. Draco scrambled to get his balance, but it was too late. Several people screamed; the purple fire had already engulfed Professor Augusta from head to toe.
“I’ll have that sent down to you,” Goodwin said. “Feel free to peruse it while you wait. Once the trial has started, you’ll be called individually to the court to present your testimonies and answer questions from the court.” She squinted. “Except for Mr. Potter,” she said, pointing at him.
“Well,” he said, wondering how best to put it, “some people have already… guessed.”
Potter snapped his mouth shut and instead turned to Theo. He was on the balls of his feet, practically vibrating with suspense, desperately trying to tell Theo a twelve-roll essay with his eyes.
all of you, yes?”
All they could do was wait. They heard muffled voices behind the door, but no distinguishable words. After some time, the voices amplified into shouts, and Theo heard a repeated banging. He imagined it had to be Goodwin smacking her gavel, and hoped it was the result of Goyle acting out of line. The more unruly he was, the better Draco’s luck would be.
One afternoon, the D.A.D.A. study group had decided a training session in the Room of Requirement was in order— ha, Theo could remember its name after all— and Theo had known for a fact that it was currently occupied. In the end, he’d somehow found himself leading the damn thing in the eighth-year common room instead. Blaise had scribbled something down on his stupid parchment, and Potter and Draco hadn’t batted an eye when they’d returned an hour later to a room full of dueling eighth-years.
Theo raised an eyebrow. “If anything, I was doing the opposite. And there’s nothing in the contract against that.”
Molrey was once again absent when Theo got there, and he quickly assured the other elves he’d be fine with the porridge he’d brought from breakfast. This clearly wasn’t convincing enough, and within a few minutes he was given a fresh warm bowl, topped with sliced peaches and mouth-watering blueberries.
“I,” Theo said, “what do you mean?”
“So is washing your feet before you stink up the dorm,” Theo added, and Longbottom went quiet. “Go to
“Draco,” said Draco.
It had to be a trap. “Er,” Theo said, “June 5th. I didn’t know Potter’s birthday, but I thought he might do something for yours.” He didn’t mention that he’d specifically put his money on the common room. Sure, they were both dramatic, but Theo had been banking less on an intentional reveal and more on an accidental show of affection that no one could ignore. Perhaps Potter would start playing with Draco’s hair, or present Draco with a gift and receive a kiss in return. Given how disgusting they were, it seemed the most likely outcome.
“Or impressed,” Pansy added.
After finally extracting the sad-looking glove from between the textbooks, Theo left Potter to hide beneath his scarf once more. Thankfully, neither Blaise nor Pansy noticed when he rejoined their table, as they were both still bickering.
“Oh, who cares,” Theo said through a mouthful of peaches. “You’re still a
Molrey squeaked again, this time in terror, as Draco appeared from around the corner looking absolutely murderous, a sheepish Potter in tow. Molrey gave a quick bow to both Draco and Theo and then turned tail, sprinting back to work.
Potter bellowed. The spell hit Goyle straight in the chest, blasting him off his feet. He toppled to the ground with a dull
Before Theo had a chance to punch her back, Professor Flitwick clapped his hands, and the room descended into darkness. Wand tips ignited around the classroom, and class began. Flitwick drew a circle of bright purple light in the air, and they all hastened to copy him. Theo’s circle turned out nicely. Blaise’s circle was more of an oval and Pansy’s looked rather like a broad bean.
“One month hardly qualifies as a year, Ron,” Granger chided. “And I, for one, think it’s understandable why he’d keep it quiet. You know the attention he gets if he so much as changes his socks.”
For two blissful days, Theo managed to convince himself that the task he’d wound up with was feasible.
“What in Merlin’s name was that?” Macmillan asked, staring at the wall as if he could see through it if he tried hard enough.
“I—” Blaise sputtered, “but—”
They were both remarkably unconcerned about the fact that Theo was discussing their sex life. Well. Potter had saved the world and Draco was facing the possibility of Azkaban. Indignity was not likely high on their list of concerns. Theo realized abruptly that that was also probably
“What, you want me to write you a manual?”
Theo thought. Blaise, on the other hand, began launching into a series of reasons why of
“But of course you’re hurting him,” Granger insisted. “He has enough people prodding around in his personal life as it is, he doesn’t need
He waited for a few minutes and, when Blaise still hadn’t reappeared, tucked his book into his robe pocket and hurried out of the common room, head spinning.
Granger’s stress was knocked down a few pegs after she finished her Arithmancy and Ancient Runes exams, something for which they were all grateful. She actually laughed when Longbottom offered to help her study for their Herbology practical.
“Why are you so chipper about this?” Granger said shrewdly, looking between the three of them.
“Well, they won’t just kill him straight away,” Pansy said bluntly. “Augusta’s alive. And that wasn’t a centered, focused curse.” She shrugged. “Definitely not as bad as it could have been.”
“Well,” Theo said, once they’d caught their breath. “Have a good time at Scrivenshaft’s. I don’t think I’ve ever been.”
Finally Draco took the stage, adjusted his robes, and twirled his wand between his fingers. A few people sniggered, Potter included.
“Pass the gravy,” Theo said. Draco grabbed the pitcher and set it down hard in front of Theo’s plate. Gravy sloshed out the sides, dripping down onto the table. “Thanks,” Theo said, not touching it.
“Makes sense,” Ernie said, and had to bounce the ink bottle off his elbow to keep it from hitting the counter. “Well, good luck. Hope something turns up soon.”
“And then a Ministry official showed up for another random inspection just after midnight,” Draco muttered. “Something to do with the wardrobe in the basement. They thought it was a magical artifact that needed to be confiscated, because there was a cabinet in my initial report, and—” He broke off, looking away. “Anyway,” he said after a moment’s pause, “if it weren’t for Harry’s cloak, I’m not sure what would have happened.”
“You all right?” Macmillan said.
“Granger told me off for eating porridge too close to her,” Theo said, holding up his bowl. “So I retreated.”
Blaise clicked his tongue dismissively. “They’re not going to give him a fair trial. If we play by their rules, we won’t win.”
“I had to pick up some old paperwork,” Ernie said, holding up a crumpled piece of parchment. “I was applying for the
They’d taken the Floo to the Ministry that morning, but by the time they were ready to leave, too many Ministry officials had queued up to head home for the day, so they had to settle for the Knight Bus instead.
was, and they’d all leave.
Percy Weasley found his brother’s eyes and nodded slowly, that pompous face finally breaking into a smile for the first time since they’d met him. Weasley dragged him into a hug too, and after a moment of fighting, the other Weasley gave up and hugged his younger brother back.
“I’m sure you can think of something!” Potter called over his shoulder, and tugged the dormitory door shut behind him with renewed vigor.
“The terms were to ‘guess the date on which one or both of the concerned parties divulges such information as to confirm the existence of past or present intimacy between said parties,’” Theo said, carefully pouring his coffee. “That’s the contract, right?”
Bugger, he kept getting distracted. Theo glared at the back of the chair, as if either of them would feel his disapproval and stop being so pity-able in reply. Nothing happened, of course, and Theo sighed, turning back to Thomas’s notes.
“If Malfoy gets off, he’ll deserve it,” Granger said.
Ten minutes later they were all in the room that didn’t always exist— it had a name, but Theo could never remember what it was. The room had manifested as a windowless cavern, stacked high with books, trinkets, cloths, and countless tchotchkes. When they’d stepped in, Draco had frozen for a moment before continuing inside.
“Yes.” Weasley scowled. “Now, if you’ll excuse me.”
“Really,” Draco said, clearly not believing this sudden bout of charity. “You won’t tell a single person that Harry Potter, Golden Boy of Hogwarts, is getting a leg over behind the kitchens?”
“What’s up?” he hissed as he finally reached them, setting his bag under the bench. “Why’s everyone gone quiet?”
“With
Draco shrugged. “I’m curious. When did you bet on us saying something?”
Theo barked, taking a step forward. “What do you think you’re doing?”
“You know we’re not supposed to use magic in the castle unless it’s strictly necessary,” Blaise said, folding his arms. “Or else the younger students start copying us.”
“No discussing,” Percy said testily. “Next. Hurry up.”
“What are you talking about?” Theo blinked. “We’re taking N.E.W.T. exams in two months.”
“Er,” Thomas said, taking the notes back. “You can keep those for a while if you like, it’s no trouble—”
Theo,” Weasley muttered, finally coming to a stop once they’d reached the bottom of the stairs and were properly out of sight. “Look,” he said through gritted teeth. “I’m supposed to meet Harry in exactly twenty minutes, and I can’t very well show up looking like
“Damn,” Theo said, “and we haven’t had an interesting bet in ages.”
They’d spent two hours out in the courtyard, making the marble below their feet glow purple with flames. At midnight, Theo’s father had sent him to bed. Theo had watched from the window as Dolohov took his father’s hand and they disapparated into the night.
Theo let out his breath the moment Draco was out of sight. He reached for the coffee pitcher.
Potter clicked his tongue. “I could start carrying my cloak around more often.”
“Just your project, then?” Pansy pressed.
“That was definitely cursed fire,” Blaise said, once they were out of earshot from the classroom. “I’ve seen it before.
Theo’s heart tugged— which was an instant red flag. It was entirely plausible this was all a show, and Blaise was digging for information. He wasn’t going to get it, so Theo wasn’t too worried, but he still wistfully hoped this was genuine. It was rare that Blaise displayed human emotions beyond basic displeasure or vindictive smugness.
“Blaise will see through me in a second, he’ll ask why I want to change, and I’ll have to tell him
“We were betting on where McGonagall would dump us this year,” he said quickly. “And, to no one’s surprise, we ended up in the South Tower.”
“—no one’s allowed to, er, coerce you into revealing anything, see. So no one could just ask you upfront, or say something to make you admit it.”
“Theo, honestly,” Blaise hissed, “some of us are trying to
Weasley gave a laugh that sounded incredibly forced. “Malfoy,” he said derisively. “I don’t see why you care about
Until now it hadn’t really mattered what they thought, and Theo had resigned himself to the reality that their houses would always divide them, but now…

“What an old cow,” he said quickly, forcing a laugh to draw her attention. Pansy snorted, dumping the crackers onto the table.
“I’ll bring you back some Jaffa Cakes,” he said that afternoon, packing his suitcase so haphazardly that Theo felt a headache beginning to press behind his eye sockets. “They’re heavenly.”
“What,” Draco said flatly. Finch-Fletchley froze.
Everyone had to keep their things relatively tidy, or else an amalgamation of mess would form, clothes and debris so thoroughly mixed together that it was impossible to tell whose garbage was whose. Some of them snored, some tossed and turned, and some did last-minute homework by wandlight every Thursday evening.
The conductor, a gangly-looking man who couldn’t be more than a few years older than them, recognized Potter at once and ushered them all inside. Potter insisted on paying for their fare to return to Hogwarts, though he couldn’t dissuade the conductor from offering them all free hot cocoa.
Blaise arched an eyebrow. “No.”
that turned out to be a lot less horrifying than it sounded.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Muggle studies is going well, I take it?”
“‘Mione, you saved the world,” Weasley said exasperatedly one morning, upon waking up and seeing Granger hunched over the study table, exactly where he’d left her the night before. “They’re going to give you a break.”
“Ronald,” Granger hissed, as Blaise pocketed the galleons. “You are
“He likes sweets, doesn’t he?”
Sensing they weren’t going to get anywhere until this was resolved, Theo sighed. “You know how Pansy and Blaise think I’m mooning over you?” Potter nodded, as though this was perfectly normal. By now, it rather was. “Well,” Theo said, “they, er, tried to set me up.”
Theo snorted. “Sort your relationship out for yourself, Potter. In the meantime, pick up my bookbag, would you?”
“Honestly, I’d love one.”
The rest of the class gathered around the entrance to the hospital wing, waiting for news. After twenty minutes, Draco and Potter emerged, Potter looking worried and Draco bone-white, neither noticing they had an audience.
was it annoying.
“Harry, why don’t you take a shower and join us?” she asked. “I know for a fact you haven’t touched your Transfiguration textbook since you dropped it off on Monday.”
he thought,
“Oh, thank you,” Granger said, looking up from Pansy’s essay, “but you really don’t need to, I’m all right.”
Theo could almost feel himself sinking into the ground.
she demanded. “What was that about?”
Theo and Pansy winced.
The Wizengamot had already made up their minds. If Theo didn’t say anything, he’d be agreeing with what they’d decided: Draco was a Death Eater and always would be. But Goodwin’s specific words weren’t wrong, and there was nothing Theo could say to disprove her.
“My freedom,” Draco said icily, “doesn’t depend on
Ministry work held some appeal, but there were several obstacles between Theo and a steady bureaucratic job.
“Nice job,” he said, grinning at Theo. “Scrivenshaft’s never looked this good when I used to come 'round here.” He picked up a bottle of ink that was somewhere between Midnight Blue and Breathtaking Violet. “What’s the gimmick with this one?”
And thus Pansy’s pity multiplied tenfold.
Draco held his wand up.
One by one, the other eighth-years stepped forward, each giving either Draco or Potter a meaningful nod or salute. Weasley and Granger flanked Potter on either side, Finch-Fletchley stood by Macmillan, the Patil twins gave Pansy high-fives, and at last even Longbottom joined.
“Finnigan offered,” Theo said, shrugging. “They’re really thorough. Most of it’s just the textbook, but worded in a way that you can actually understand
Blaise hissed, then looked at Pansy, grinning. “Theo was right. This is perfect.”
Theo nodded. “It’s not as deadly as Fiendfyre, but it’s less difficult to cast,” he added. “So it’s better for dueling.”
“Bloody
“If you could copy some of your notes from Transfiguration, that’d be
“You’re kidding.” Draco shook his head. “Weasley, too?” Theo nodded.
“All right, we’ll ask them,” she said, and Weasley seemed to float a few inches off the ground. “But
Theo raised an eyebrow. “You’re crying.”
Theo and Pansy glanced at Blaise. “We have a bet going,” Blaise explained. “On when they’ll break the news. None of us had today—”
“No plan,” Thomas said firmly. “We tell the truth. That’s all we can do.”
Theo waited, but neither of them chipped in with a helpful
“Perfectly fine,” Theo said. He put his finished practice test between the pages of his Transfiguration textbook and pulled out the Potions one.
“Seamus and Dean nearly wet themselves,” Weasley said, grinning.
Potter and Draco barked, in tandem incredulity. Potter dropped half a profiterole on the ground, and Draco leaned so far forward that the profiterole tower brushed his sleeves with powdered sugar.
“Draco’s right,” Potter said, cutting in for the first time, and Theo instantly understood what Draco had done. That damn sneak. Potter’s words, meanwhile, had instantly cut the tension in two. “Hermione,” Potter said, “I’m gonna take a shower and have a lie-in, I’m tired. Can I borrow one of your study guides later, though?”
“Well,” she said now, “Blaise and I have been talking.”
“Oh,” Macmillan said. “Er, no, but that’s all right. There’s more to Hogwarts than dating.”
“Not just the parchment,” Weasley said, chewing his bottom lip. “This… this explains the gloves, the Firebolt— that goblin-arsed prick, he’s been lying to us all year.”
and Professor Augusta only just jumped in time to avoid the black, twisting ropes that came for her ankles. Draco took a short breath, dodging to the side of the stage. Professor Augusta circled him. His back was to the edge of the stage; she had the advantage.
“Listen, I was in a
“I am asking you nicely.” Theo put his hands together in prayer.
Pansy looked like she was trying very hard not to say something. Theo ignored her. “Yeah,” he said, “I guess. Why?”
The minute they were outside the common room, Weasley let his back fall against the marble and slid down a few inches, groaning softly.
Whatever Finch-Fletchley had expected, it wasn’t that. He opened his mouth, couldn’t think of anything to say, and shut it again.
Potter dissolved into laughter, as did Weasley and, after a sulk that lasted less than a minute, Draco. He fell into Potter’s arms and they sat together on an empty bed, clearly lost in each other’s presence.
“Well, it’s not!” Potter folded his arms. “Draco’s mother worries about him enough. She doesn’t need this tacked on, too. And the Malfoy Manor is still undergoing inspection. If anyone saw me there with him, meeting his mother—”
about this. But that appeared to be the case, as Finnigan, Thomas, and Macmillan were all staring at them owlishly.
“Don’t forget who gets the winnings if you cheat.”
Yes, he thought, all was in order.
Theo looked at Draco, who didn’t look back. His eyes were fixed on something a thousand miles away, through the walls and beyond the forest. His chest rose and fell with shallow, silent breaths.
“You can call it what it is.”
Granger snorted. “Oh, they saw him all right.”
“There’s a bet going on!” Theo said quickly, putting his hands up in defense. “About you two, and when you’ll go public.”
“Yeah,” Weasley said thoughtfully. “Man. Perce in the Wizengamot. Mum’s going to throw him a parade when we get home.”
They trudged out of their Potions N.E.W.T. a week later, thoroughly exhausted and smelling like rotten eggs.
Pansy squealed beside him, positively quivering. Theo closed his eyes, willing someone to spill their ink bottle all over the table, praying that someone would fall off their stool and pants themselves in the process, anything to take the attention off of himself and his supposed infatuation with Potter.
“Because it wasn’t
“Did you come down to meet me?” Potter asked, looking between the two of them. Weasley didn’t answer this either. After a full three seconds, he kicked Theo’s shin.
“So,” Draco said, prodding the silence apart with his usual lack of tact. “When did you pick?”
The only reason Theo knew any of this was because none of them would shut the hell up about it. One night Theo woke to the sound of Finnigan and Thomas arguing with Longbottom about the importance of a proper N.E.W.T. score versus the pass/fail option, and how important Herbology really was in the long run.
“Mr. Potter, if I need to remind you once more that you are acting as Witness to the defense, not providing a witness testimony...” she warned.
“We can handle it,” Theo said. He stacked Thomas’s notes into a messy pile and offered them out. “Thank you for your help. It’s very appreciated. We’re fine now.”
“Blaise, help me out here?”
“But—”
The eighth-year dorms had been built in the span of about a month.
It wasn’t until Saturday that something truly interesting happened.
“Unless they wanted to force results on their particular day,” Weasley cut in, but Blaise took a step forward and Theo knew he was in the clear.
of you ought to have some sense.”
“Technically, we are,” Theo pointed out, and Macmillan began to snigger. “What?”
Theo thought dully.
“Trust me,” Theo said, trying to give Potter a reassuring smile. It was hard when he didn’t feel terrifically reassured himself. “Draco tends to… dwell on things.” He wondered how best to explain it. “You might run off to fix something the moment you can, but he’s not the same,” he said, and Potter frowned. “Draco doesn’t always realize why he’s being stupid until something drastic happens, and even after that he’ll brood for a while to figure out what to do.”
There must be another antechamber connected to the courtroom, and Theo wondered why they’d shoved all of the eighth-years into this single, tiny room instead of spreading them out.
Percy froze mid-twist. He fixed Blaise with a razor-sharp glare, wordlessly warning him to tread carefully.
“Yeah?”
The D.A.D.A. exam was divided into two parts: a written test and a practical obstacle course. The latter finished with an individual duel against their examiner, who introduced herself as Professor Augusta. Theo couldn’t for the life of him remember all five early symptoms of a werewolf bite, but lasted seven minutes in his duel, so he was optimistic.
Pansy frowned. “But what about Golpalott’s fifth—”
“Thank me?” Draco’s voice answered, sounding confused. “For what?”
“Draco’s been trying to take people’s attention away from Potter for years,” Pansy said, dismissing Blaise’s completely accurate theory. “It’s never worked before. Why would it work now?”
“Merlin help us if Hogwarts ever has a dragonpox outbreak,” Theo muttered, “we’ll all be infected in minutes.” He took the opportunity to look over Draco’s shoulder at the Gryffindors.
his point had more credibility, and
“Everyone knew,” Blaise said, clearly having caught on. “I wasn’t aware
Theo wasn’t one for blind hopes. He settled on the best reassurance he could give. “Draco’s not his father,” he said simply. “He’d survive, you know.” He smiled. “Especially if he’s got you to live for.”
“Listen to him, maybe?” Potter suggested.
“Theo, it’s
“Why?” Draco asked, narrowing his eyes. “What do you stand to gain?”
“And then?”
Theo cleared his throat, and the hand reappeared guiltily, sliding behind the chair so it couldn’t be seen.
When he was certain there was no sign of Draco or Potter in the shop, Theo turned back to Finnigan.
“I don’t want a
Finch-Fletchley stared at him.
Blaise frowned. Theo felt a little stab of pity. “Draco was doing me a favor,” he supplied helpfully.
Ernie Macmillan looked around the shop at the stacks of rolled parchment, the rows of ink bottles slowly shifting color as he watched, and the wall of impeccably clean quills without a single feather out of place.
“Theo.”
He thought back to the beginning of their eighth year and began sifting through the memories, searching for anything that might stand out as a testament to Draco’s change of character. But nothing seemed to fit.

“We might have squeezed it out of Nott,” Potter said. “Sorry.” He shot a look at Weasley and Granger. “I’m a little offended that you put money on me, Ron, but I’m
Blaise and Pansy were inviting him to their house up in London for a weekend trip, and he had yet to reply. Of course he was going. He just had to put his response to words, and those words to paper. As he worked at a stationary shop, his letters had to maintain a certain standard. Perhaps he’d use the color morphing ink, he thought as he finally found his gloves and tugged them over his fingers. Pansy would get a kick out of it.
“Listen here, Malfoy,” she said through gritted teeth. “If it weren’t for me, Harry wouldn’t be here right now. So you don’t get to tell me that his life is none of my business.”
Unless Theo thought back to the conversation he’d overhead in the kitchens.
“Nothing, anymore,” Blaise said truthfully. “I was about to lament how it was rather pointless to guess the
“I can’t just sit here and do nothing,” Potter pleaded. “Percy,
“Well, Draco’s the biggest arse in our year,” Theo said. “You suit each other.”
Finnigan and Thomas scowled at Weasley from their seats beside her, but Weasley neither noticed nor cared. He spotted Theo standing in the doorway to the boy’s dorms, sighed, and jerked his head toward the door that led to the outside corridor. Theo opened his mouth, but Weasley shook his head minutely.
“And I’m assuming you haven’t told him any of this,” Theo said.
“It’s stupid,” Potter muttered.
Finch-Fletchley didn’t begin talking to him regularly like Macmillan, but every so often he’d make eye contact with Theo and hold it for a full second before looking away.
Theo abandoned his socks, following Weasley out into the common room.
“Ouch,” Theo said automatically.
“Nott,” Potter said, leaning on the table now. “You’ll get the pool when you win, won’t you?”
And look here,” he said, pointing to distract Pansy from the fact that Draco was standing two feet behind her. "Slughorn’s lectures, word-for-word. He must have a dictating quill, I swear, I don’t know how he does it.”
live through the war,” Theo said. “You did what, frankly, a lot of people couldn’t do. You survived.”
said one of their editorial writers had a row with the editor last week and got herself fired.” He shrugged. “So I’m applying.”
Theo stood as Pansy returned, and tried to pat her on the shoulder. Percy swatted his arm away. “You next,” he said, tugging Theo along.
“Of course I’m not,” Blaise said, sounding mildly offended. “Draco was tried with the Wizengamot last summer. His case has always been high-profile.”
“Now?” Potter sighed. “I don’t know. They’re probably going to offer Goyle another few years off his sentence if he gives them information against Draco.” He chewed his bottom lip, looking at the door. “It won’t matter if I’m there or not. They can’t give him
Draco Malfoy, what would happen to the all-important sway he held at the Ministry? Potter’s word had been a key factor in deciding the Malfoy family’s fate, Draco’s especially. What good would that word be if he was declared to be biased?
Theo’s heart turned over. If Potter was taking the news this badly, Draco was about to go on the warpath. There had to be some sort of a solution, but Theo couldn’t find one.
Weasley hesitated, looking at Granger. She chewed her lip.
Theo took a moment to process this. “I— what?”
“Actually,” Granger interjected, “Nott didn’t break the contract.” Pansy, Blaise, Theo, Weasley, and Potter all stared at her. “What?” she said. “Of course I got a copy of it the moment Ron put real money down. What do you take me for, Harry, Mundungus Fletcher?”
think that’s bollocks,” Blaise said firmly.
After Christmas, both Draco and Potter seemed to have learned their lesson. They were remarkably discreet about meeting up for the next several weeks, hardly said a word to one another in passing, and kept their distance so thoroughly that Theo wondered if they’d heard he’d had to sacrifice his Christmas profiteroles and were feeling guilty.
“No, she did for us,” Pansy said. Thomas and Finnigan looked at one another for a moment, then burst into laughter. “Right,” Pansy muttered, wincing.
“No!” Potter shook his head, suddenly frantic. “No, it’s nothing to do with you. Christmas was—” He broke off, smiling. Theo waited for him to stop. Once Potter’s cheeks lost their flush, he folded his arms.  “After all that, he asked me to come to his mother’s to celebrate the new year. I said I didn’t think that was a good idea.”
Draco, this is perfect.”
don’t get time off for that,” Theo said. “Won’t everyone notice you’ll be gone together?”
“Draco, he’s
“They have something to do with storing electricity,” Draco said, turning the page to a diagram consisting of little bubbles also marked with plus and minus signs. They looked rather like plum puddings. “But electricity isn’t supposed to be
“If you’re going to bring this up again, then there’s no point in talking,” Draco said calmly, though Theo watched him shove his hands in his pockets to keep them from trembling.
They all looked at his neck, around which was tied a battered-looking scarlet and gold tie.
“If he wants to skive off his work, let him.”
but couldn’t keep his face straight.
Draco paled beyond the limits of human complexion. “He told you about that?”
“Of course not. He’d call me a coward.”
He doubted either Macmillan or Finch-Fletchley wanted to talk to him. Even if they got past the house bias, what would they even talk about?
“I don’t see why we should care,” Draco said, picking a piece of dirt out from under his fingernail.
“Damn,” Finnigan muttered when he read the turquoise label. They were milk chocolate. “They’re always out once I get here,” he groaned. “The third-years clear this place out in about half an hour.” He looked at the box sadly. “The dark chocolate ones are really excellent, too.”
And with a wink, Blaise followed the Patil twins out the door.
“Because it was me, and he hated me?”
“Yeah, but still.” Theo shrugged. “It’s the editorial section, right? It’s not war correspondence. You’ll be in the same field.”
“Nott,” Potter said, snapping Theo’s attention away from Draco. “You’re good with brooms, right?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Eventually the newcomer agreed to have some eggs, and Theo watched the swarm of house-elves swell as their army returned victorious. Footsteps drew nearer, and Theo belatedly realized that he’d let his book fall to his lap—
“No,” Theo croaked.
“I reckon it’s some sort of distraction,” Blaise explained. “To take everyone’s attention off of Potter.”
“Accio,” he muttered quickly. He caught the two wands— he nearly dropped Goodwin’s, but grabbed it before it could hit the ground again and make a sound— and hid them both in his robe pocket, along with his own. Once Goyle got up, he was likely to try his summoning trick again. But out of all of them, he wouldn’t expect Theo to be the one abetting Potter.
“Hold on,” Theo said, holding a hand up, “I thought you two had
Theo knew something was wrong the moment he stepped inside. Professor Sprout was apparently running just as late as he was, because there wasn't a trace of her trademark burlap hat. But the entire classroom was whispering to one another, heads bent low. Theo scanned the room, trying to figure out what had happened, but no one appeared to have been bitten by a tentacula. No one was sporting extra limbs. Today’s lesson didn’t even look exciting, as their tables were only lined with soil pots. The only thing remotely interesting about them was that the soil sparkled, but they’d been using
So when they woke up one morning to a post on the bulletin board announcing that the Easter holidays would begin on April 2nd and classes would resume on April 16th, Theo wanted to melt into the floor, or perhaps evaporate. Whichever would give him the quickest death.
For a moment they all stared at the empty grate. And then Weasley sank into a chair, his head in his hands. “We’re fucked,” he groaned.
Theo looked. Weasley looked perfectly presentable. His robes were impeccably ironed, with barely a speck of dust on them. The lining was pressed, the hood was flat, and the Slytherin emblem on the left side glinted even in the dim dungeon light—
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Yes?” He stuffed a forkful of pancake quarters into his mouth and chewed slowly, looking between the three of them. After a long moment, he swallowed. “Mother sent me another letter last night,” he said, focusing his attention on the butter tray instead of their expectant faces. He swiped a dollop from the end and smeared it over what was left of his pancakes. “Father’s not doing well in Azkaban.”
“Good,” Granger said, promptly turning back to Pansy’s essay. “Now go and get changed.”
Pansy giggled, and Blaise cracked a smile. They were Slytherins, after all. Blaise couldn’t be too surprised or disappointed that Theo had managed to pull the rug out from under him. Pansy stole Theo’s mug of cocoa and Theo let her, while Blaise demanded to know whether he and Macmillan were really just friends after all. The bus pulled away from the curb with a lurch, before careening down the streets much faster than any Muggle bus would ever be allowed. One of the Patil twins shrieked, her sister laughed in answer, and the whole bus burst into chatter.
Theo opened his mouth to retort that actually, a better plan would probably be to meet Potter like this, have a good laugh at the misbrewed potion, and wait the hour out before shagging each other senseless. But he hesitated. Interrupting Draco now would be tantamount to suicide. Besides, if Draco wanted to make his own stupid decisions, it wasn’t Theo’s place to stop him.
“He was—” Draco stopped himself from saying something, took a breath, and continued with stiff, forced calm. “He was thinking practically. Perhaps more so than I could admit at the time.”
“Please don’t pull out your broomstick,” Theo said the moment he and Potter were alone. “Or your— anything else. I’m really not prepared for either.”
“Ron, you’re back early,” he greeted, and saw Theo. “Nott,” he added, clearly wondering what they were doing together. Theo, who was doing the same thing, nodded stiffly.
He shoved Weasley and the rest of them out, and closed the door behind them.
The next two days’ exams were electives, with the last core exams scheduled for the following week. On the second day of electives, Theo caught Draco leaving his Muggle Studies exam with Finch-Fletchley. He ducked behind a nearby column, and watched with silent amusement as Draco handed Finch-Fletchley his notebook back with uncharacteristic gusto and proceeded to accost him about their exam all the way from the classroom to the stairs. Finch-Fletchley nearly toppled off the edge when Draco brought up the essay question about ballpoint pens.
I thought it’d take at least two.”
One young-looking official actually pointed at Potter when they passed her.
can give them back to Thomas,” he explained.
to comply, understood?”
They were going to wait it out. Draco, who couldn’t be arsed to make his own coffee in the morning if someone else’s was tempting him, was going to wait until the end of the year to say or show anything about their relationship.
Theo cleared his throat. “Sorry if this is overstepping, but… are you all right?”
“It wasn’t concentrated,” he finished firmly. “If he’d cast it with the intent to harm, Professor Augusta would be in St. Mungo’s by now, if not worse.”
He waited for a few minutes in the dormitory room, pacing between the beds and wondering what in Merlin’s name he was going to tell Blaise and Pansy. They both knew perfectly well that Theo knew next to nothing about broom care, and this wasn’t the first time Theo had been caught talking to Potter alone. Blaise had been suspicious for weeks, and Theo was running out of ideas.
Theo had time to wonder if that was a rough estimate or if Pansy and Blaise had actually been keeping count, before Blaise launched into a tirade of insults. Pansy didn’t so much as flinch.
He smiled.
“There’s a
label they were going for, but neither of those would really count as noteworthy events on their own. Draco had quietly and privately talked to those he’d wronged. He’d settled into the background of the eighth-year class, eating and sleeping and working alongside the rest of them without causing a fuss. There was no single moment of change, which meant Theo couldn’t just regale the court with a tale of some grand gesture of charity.
Pansy patted his shoulder comfortingly.
“—and besides, that’s insensitive,” Pansy was saying tartly. “Draco could have been attacked, and all you can talk about is Potter. If I didn’t know better, Blaise, I’d say
“I didn’t know you were bent too,” Macmillan began bluntly, once they were alone.
Potter froze. “I— beg your pardon?”
Maybe appealing to Granger’s argument would make her more likely to listen to his own. If it was framed within the same logic, perhaps she’d consider it with the same rationale. “We didn’t fight a war last year just to come back here and fight with each other,” he said, trying to keep his voice steady.
“Well, I can believe that much.” Theo winced. He’d never known Draco to be particularly sensitive when it came to expressing his opinion. “What was his reasoning, though? I assume he tried to pitch an argument for coming clean.”
“You’ve nothing to be sorry for,” Potter said, so full of love and compassion that Theo’s knees actually felt weak. Damn Gryffindor.
It was the last memory Theo had of him.
because I’m a little cross with him, too.”
“Fair enough.”
Weasley took a deep breath. “We’re not the only witnesses.”
Theo ran a hand over his face. “Look,” he said, “could you two just— keep things down for a little while, so Blaise stops sniffing after me? Just until the end of the holidays, that’s all I’m asking.”
Blaise, however, wasn’t so timid. He grabbed the gravy for himself. “How was Muggle Studies today?” he asked, and Theo wanted to kiss him. Metaphorically.
“Did Potter
Theo tried to remember the key details surrounding Draco’s sentence. His parole was set to expire by the end of term. Once his exam results came in, he had to appear in court once more for a final re-examination that took his marks and his professors’ comments into account. And then, finally, if he passed all of that… he’d be free to go.
Honey-sweet air met his nose and he sighed happily, heading inside.
“Right,” Theo said. Trying to comprehend what Thomas was saying with the constant distraction of Potter and Draco trying to hide themselves just over Thomas’s shoulder was extremely challenging. They’d finally made it to the chair, but were now having a silent argument over who would get to sit in the damn thing, and who would sit in the other’s lap.
“Is that coffee?” Draco reached over the stack of thin, perfectly-cooked pancakes that had appeared between them, his sleeve smearing the butter. Within seconds he was draining Theo’s goblet, grunting faintly in pleasure.
Theo, Blaise, and Pansy watched in wordless amazement as Draco found the coffee pitcher and poured himself another goblet, completely nonplussed. On the other side of the room, Potter barked out a laugh. Theo stole another glance. Granger looked concerned, and Weasley looked straight at Theo, raising his eyebrows in a silent yet instantly understood question:
“Shut
Someone coughed, and Theo looked up. He had to lock his legs to keep from losing his balance; all forty-seven Wizengamot members were staring at him in expectant silence. His palms slick with sweat in his pockets, Theo fixed his gaze on Goodwin’s podium and tried to think.
It was an unspoken rule they all followed that, if he was in the room, Potter had precedent over the chair. Potter himself had never enforced this, which might have spoken to the whole virtuous thing— but he hadn’t bothered to dissuade people from avoiding it either. Most of them just gave the chair a generous berth, to avoid having to pack up and move if Potter came into the common room unexpectedly.
The sound of a chair scooting backwards over hardwood flooring yanked Theo from his thoughts. Granger had stood up, and now took a pointed step towards the chair by the fire.
“Yeah,” Theo said wistfully, remembering his breakfast. He’d overslept, and had just enough time to wolf down a bowl of porridge and snatch a coconut cream profiterole before he’d been whisked away by the arm, forced to leave it on the table, abandoned, neglected—
He untucked the plain sock from the ribbed, and heard a shuffling of sheets.
“By now, most people probably think it started at Easter,” he said. “Some of us wagered as far back as Halloween. I don't know when it really began, but I know I first saw it on a dark, stormy winter morning."
As far as Theo could tell, Finch-Fletchley fit the Hufflepuff stereotypes to a T. He had never overperformed in class, made any sort of rallying speech that Theo could remember, or solved a pressing mystery about the castle. He kept to himself, hardly talked to anyone besides his housemates, and didn’t seem to want to change any of this.
“Y...es,” Theo said slowly. Beside him, Blaise stopped writing. “Why do you ask?”
“This,” Theo said, pointing to the diagram in the corner. “I don’t remember learning about a fifth law.”
Theo stared. Potter raised an eyebrow.
Theo had time for a shrug before Draco blocked his view of the Gryffindor table again, now grabbing four pancakes for his plate and slathering them with lemon juice.
“I doubt it,” Blaise muttered. “He just wants everyone on his side.”
“Because,” Potter said, turning his frenetic energy towards Draco, “this solves everything. That stupid contract, did you hear him? No one’s allowed to
Theo huffed affronted. “Seriously, Blaise?” He pushed his chair out and stood. “I know this bet is fun and all, but if Draco’s going to pick fights with someone as important as Granger, then I’m going to intervene.” He sat back in his old chair and picked up his book, hoping he could pass off his desperate want for Blaise to leave him alone as simple irritation. “If you care that much about Galleons, go get yourself a niffler.”
“But—”
Not noticing Theo, he slammed the door behind him and made a beeline for one of the beds— Draco’s bed, specifically. Without hesitation, Weasley bent down and began rifling through Draco’s things, undoing his trunk and tossing out clothes left and right.
Blaise opened his mouth, but Pansy beat him to it. “Draco’s in the hospital wing,” she said, practically vibrating. “No one knows what’s wrong with him. Pomfrey won’t let anyone visit.”
“I will?”
By the end of the Easter holidays, Theo had all but forgotten about his ever-present task of keeping Potter and Draco’s escapades firmly under the radar. He’d actually begun to worry that they were fighting again and subsequently keeping their distance, until one morning when he spotted them brushing their hands together in passing.
Goodwin looked down at her podium for a fraction of a second, then turned her attention back to Theo. “Please describe for us what transpired during your Defense Against the Dark Arts N.E.W.T. exam yesterday.”
They ate their crumpets in silence for about a minute. Theo finished his first and looked around the shop in awkward silence while Macmillan ate. It took about ten seconds for the witch in the apron to catch his eye, and she immediately bustled over. She cooed over them for a solid two minutes before, to Theo’s immense embarrassment, fetching a gigantic red candle for their table. It smelled so powerfully of cinnamon that Theo’s head began to spin.
Maybe now Draco would take a step back and actually

First, he had to wait until February’s truly loathsome holiday had passed.
anyone. We’re all in the same category now, if you haven’t noticed.” He gestured to his robes, which bore not only the green lining of Slytherin house, but also a small badge by the right lapel that labeled them as the eighth-year class. It granted them privileges such as extra hours outside of curfew and access to the prefect bathrooms.
They watched Finch-Fletchley go, and waited with baited breath for his return. Most of them had only been gone for ten minutes or so. Weasley had been out for fifteen and Granger for twenty. Finch-Fletchley returned thirty-two minutes later, looking exhausted but triumphant.
smeared up the right margin, and Theo’s fingers tensed around his quill.
Theo hissed.
“I chose the easiest one,” Macmillan said as he, Theo, and Finnigan headed for the prefect’s bathrooms to shower off. “Figured I’d rather have a solid passing mark than risk tanking it completely.”
did Pansy think that a flying rumour was even
“And how do you know that?” demanded a skinny wizard from the very back row. He wore bright green glasses that clashed awfully with his maroon Wizengamot robes.
“No kidding.” Theo set the bottle down. “What brings you in town, anyway?”
But it all came with the price of constantly diverting Blaise and Pansy’s attentions from their increasingly riskier and riskier excursions, trysts, and— oh, for Merlin’s sake—
but it still seemed a bit too meticulous for breakfast.
“Need anything, Hermione?” he asked, looking at the mess of books and papers that were strewn over the table. “I can fetch you something from the kitchens if you want.”
Gritting his teeth, Theo walked over. A blonde head of hair looked up as he approached, and Theo caught sight of the yellow lining on the boy’s hood.
The common room door finally closed, revealing a horrified Potter and Draco. All hopes of playing off like they’d just been working or loitering separately were gone when Theo saw their faces clearly. Draco’s hair was askew, his tie gone and his collar crumpled. Meanwhile, Potter was sporting swollen lips and flushed cheeks, neither of which could be explained away by anything other than Draco’s presence beside him.
“Theo.”
The moment Draco was gone, Blaise caught Theo’s eye and nodded sharply to the chair beside him. Theo swallowed thickly, gave a casual smile, and sat down.
“By hiding like someone who knew they had to hide,” Theo corrected. “Come off it, I’m in the house that’s all about knowing when to fight and when to lay low. If anyone’s going to understand, it’s us.”
“I’ll send one home to my stepfather,” Theo promised. “I don’t think he’s ever had muggle sweets.”
“What?”
“Okay,” Theo said, “so all I have to do is find the page for Golpalott’s fifth law, follow that, and—”
but still.
Theo took a step back. “Why would I—”
“Merlin’s ballsack,” Theo breathed.
It felt a bit odd to refer to Potter in the third person while he was right there, staring at Theo with a mixture of awe and gratitude. He looked like he was about to cry. Neither Granger nor Draco noticed this, as they were both still staring at Theo. He realized they were waiting for him to say something, give some sort of conclusion. Theo cleared his throat. It was hard to feel confident with Granger’s manic energy primed at him. She looked, if it were possible, even more intimidating with her hair askew from hours of essay writing, her robes disheveled and mud-stained.
Pansy said. “Finnigan asked me last week if I knew any boys who were looking for a date, you know, with— another boy.”
“Ugh,” Macmillan said. “Tell me about it.” He paused. “Seamus says your lot isn’t so bad, you know? He
“Good plan,” Potter said, and dragged him up into the boys' dormitory.
“Theo, we wouldn’t,” Pansy simpered.
“Well,” she said slowly, “we don’t have proof, exactly, but—”
They were truly,
“Yeah, they didn’t try him like the rest of us,” Pansy added, off-handedly. This earned her three identical blank stares.
“How long’s he got?” Finnigan asked, eyes wide.
“No, please keep going,” Pansy insisted. “This is the most entertainment I’ve had in weeks.”
So I don’t understand—”
Draco, of course, wasn’t nearly as lucky. Voldemort had taken refuge in his house, even if Draco himself hadn’t had a say in the matter. His father had taken the brunt of the blame, and no one had argued against him.
Granger, however, wasn’t so complacent.
Then Blaise tapped his shoulder.
Theo’s thumb twitched, and the parchment split in two. Beside him, Blaise sucked in a breath.
Before housing them, the South Tower had been home to two classrooms in the previous years, for occasional lessons that required a little extra elbow room. For their eighth year, however, the entire tower had been refitted. The main hallway had squeezed itself into a shape more befitting a lounge— with a fireplace added in for good measure— and the two classrooms had been turned into dormitories, both girls’ and boys’.
“Morning,” he said cheerfully, sitting down beside Draco. He helped himself to a plate of sausages and toast, taking care to splash a little bit of juice from the sausage plate onto Draco’s neat stack of sugar-coated pancakes. Draco flinched, but made no comment.
Draco reached for his wand, but it was lying some feet back on the dueling stage. Granger, from across the room, cast a quick
“Or this week,” Theo said.
Theo blinked, and it clicked. Draco’s parole. Theo could have smacked himself.
“Pansy, come off it,” Blaise said, rolling his eyes. “Think about it. If Draco really did get attacked by some Gryffindor nutter seeking revenge, do you really think
“Theodore Borr Nott,” Theo said.
Draco and Potter were actually
Their exams were over, their tenure at Hogwarts was finished, in seven days they’d get their exam results at the Leaving Feast, Blaise owed Theo a sack of galleons that could buy a life’s worth of French pastries, and Draco Malfoy was free.
“Y…es,” Draco said slowly. “I was aware of that when we moved our things in two months ago.” He paused. “In September.”
“Dolohov made that curse,” Theo explained, folding his arms instinctively. “My father knew him. When I was at home for Easter, the night before he left, he…”
Theo didn’t have anything to add to that, and Macmillan didn’t offer up another topic of conversation, so they fell into an awkward silence. Without talk to distract him, it was suddenly a lot more uncomfortable in this cramped, sweet-smelling shop. The air was thick with steam from a dozen teapots scattered across the tables, each one offering a different pungent aroma. Theo caught an equal whiff of hibiscus and English Breakfast, and closed his eyes to fight off nausea.
“Shame, though,” Macmillan added after a moment, “I’d have liked to say I’d been one of those troublemakers who got caught messing around in classrooms after hours, made to scrub hospital-wing bedpans as punishment.” He sighed wistfully. “It sounds so romantic.”
“Why?” Blaise asked, looking blankly between Theo and Draco.
Blaise and Pansy each gave equally disinterested waves as Theo slung himself off the bench and hurried to the back of the greenhouse. The spare bin was sat in the corner a few feet away from where Potter sat. Theo kicked him as he passed, and then bent down to sift through the bin.
he said with some effort, “asked me to fetch him something.”
“That’s fantastic.” Theo beamed. “Best of luck. And consider that my preemptive congratulatory gift on getting the job.” He nodded at the bottle of ink in Ernie’s hand.
Potter practically melted. Theo bit his tongue, trying not to gag.
Pansy made a small noise beside him and shoved her own crumpled scrap of parchment across the table. Theo un-crumpled it.
“Remember,” Percy Weasley said, and Theo realized he must have said this a dozen times already, but he didn’t sound bored in the slightest. “No talking about your testimony to anyone in the room."
Not to mention it was
Draco folded his arms and scowled.
“All right,” he said at last, closing his eyes and accepting his doom. “Fine.”
Granger considered this for a long moment, then took a deep breath.
“Oh, good, you’re here,” she said as she saw Theo. “I tried to check the library, but Pince wouldn’t let me in with these.” She gestured with the crackers, scowling.
“Why?”
Weasley lagged behind the others and had to jog to keep up, his face faintly green. They all shuffled into the antechamber, which was a windowless room that became incredibly stuffy the moment they were all inside.
“We’re not prodding,” Weasley said, putting a hand on her shoulder. “We’re just… observing.”
“Three, I thought,” Pansy piped in, from Blaise’s right. She snatched Theo’s goblet, and Theo weighed his options. After a moment, he decided that letting her take it without a fight would give his essay the best chance of survival, so he folded his arms instead of trying to take it back. Besides, he liked his coffee with an overdose of cream and sugar, and she liked hers with neither. It would be punishment enough. Pansy took a sip and grimaced. “No one had today, did they?”
Pansy, meanwhile, was still looking at the table. “How’d you end up with Thomas’s notes?”
Theo, Macmillan, Finnigan, Thomas, Blaise, and Pansy headed into an empty lift. Blaise found the keypad first, and went to press the button for their floor. He hesitated, hand hovering over the golden-painted
His socks, which he’d left strewn over his bed in a halfhearted pile, were gone. Theo panicked for a second before he realized someone— a house-elf, probably— had set them in a neat, folded pile past the foot of his bed. One look told him that he’d need to redo the pile; the first pair was a ribbed black paired with a plain.
He thought back to what Draco had said, back when he’d caught Theo eavesdropping in the kitchens:
“I do,” Theo said, heart pounding. “Yes.”
They couldn’t have picked a less conspicuous place, truly.
Blaise appeared to believe that Theo had spoken up to stop Draco from picking a fight, and barely batted an eye when Theo asked to change his date. Potter and Draco, despite their mutual love of theatrics, kept a surprisingly low profile. For two days, neither spoke more than a few polite words to the other. Draco vacated the chair by the fire, Potter addressed him by his surname twice, and they both seemed generally disinterested in one another. The buzz of excitement that a well-timed dramatic reveal would be on the horizon began to die down as everyone’s coursework took precedent.
“And how long has your father been in Azkaban?” Theo asked.
When Granger began telling people off for eating too loudly in the common room upon the dawn of the fourth day, Theo decided he’d had enough. He might not be able to write in the kitchens, but he’d certainly have enough privacy to read while enjoying his porridge in peace.
“But—”
Macmillan puffed out his chest. “I’ll testify,” he said firmly. “I’m a witness, aren’t I?” He was met with stunned silence from both ends. “Come off it,” he called to the crowd. “If attacking our N.E.W.T. examiner is his idea of turning to the dark side, I don’t think even the Death Eaters would have him.” A few people laughed.
Professor Augusta swished her wand, firing off a body-bind curse. Draco blocked it easily, side stepping and shooting a meek
“Thank you,” Theo said. “I suppose you could say I’m just… trying to figure things out.” He looked around the room, at the awkwardly placed fireplace that couldn’t possibly connect to any sort of ceiling, at the plush chair stolen from the Gryffindor common room, and at the doors to the dormitories that had once been classrooms. “Everything’s so different,” he said quietly. “We’re living with people we’ve never shared more than a class with before. From the way McGonagall’s been running us, I wouldn’t be surprised if she starts implementing inter-house unity programs next year.”
“This isn’t over,” Blaise muttered in Theo’s ear, and stalked away with Pansy.
“Anyway,” Finnigan said, in a clear attempt to change the subject, “keep on over there, I’ll kip on the chair until you’re done.”
They all had a good laugh over Finnigan’s missing eyebrow, which he assured them would grow back within a day, and left the showers in good spirits. Those spirits were crushed almost immediately when they remembered that they had their Transfiguration exam that evening.
anything. So I thought sweets would be all right, but I don’t know what he likes. I don’t just want to waltz into Honeydukes and buy the first thing I see. That’s not very meaningful. I think he’d be offended.”
Granger fully cracked in mid-May. Theo hadn’t thought she’d make it a week past the holidays, but to his and everyone’s surprise, she managed three.
“All in the name of sport,” Theo said, smiling directly at Granger. “Like Weasley said, we’re just observing. Not interacting, not influencing. Just watching from the sidelines.”
Ernie whistled. “Sure could've used that when we were in school."
“Hey,” Theo said, kneeling down. “Got any coconut profiteroles left?”
they were shagging every possible minute. At the end of the year they’d either fly off into the sunset together on a broomstick or spend five years torn apart.
“Well,” Theo said, ignoring the way Blaise’s foot pressed over his, “it was rather a stupid bet.”
“So, wait, how far ahead is the fifth law?” Pansy asked, now grabbing Theo’s textbook. She flipped through it, frowning.
charmed dirt for weeks.
Macmillan looked over Theo’s shoulder. “No,” he said. “She’s talking with the table by the door.”
Theo didn’t expect his own stress to kick in until after the Easter holidays. Like most of them, he was taking most of the core N.E.W.T. exams; Potions, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Astronomy, and Charms. Theo was an outlier in that he wasn’t taking any elective N.E.W.T.s. He planned to take a simple pass for his Astronomy exam, along with nearly everyone else. He thought he’d use his second one on either Herbology or History of Magic, but hadn’t yet decided which would be more useful.
Theo stood up.
Potter sighed. “They tried Draco, his father, mother, and Goyle last year. Narcissa was let off for saving my life, Draco was given parole because he was underage for most of his charges and he had some evidence that his involvement after he turned seventeen wasn’t voluntary. His father pleaded guilty and didn’t offer any more information, but…” He looked away. “Goyle testified against Draco in exchange for a shorter sentence.”
Theo smiled. “Oh,” he said, snapping his fingers as he remembered. “I never asked. Did Finnigan or Thomas ever find anyone else?”
“Plants are very important,” Theo mumbled, falling back on his pillow. He heard Longbottom crow a victorious
“This way,” Potter called from the front of the pack. He led them through black-marble halls and pillars five times Theo’s height. The Ministry’s design reminded him of the dungeons at Hogwarts: cold, clean, and intimidating. Perhaps that was why so many of his Slytherin peers were considering jobs here.
“It didn’t count,” Theo said firmly, grabbing a fresh goblet that was conveniently three times as large as his old one, conveniently already filled with cream and sugar, and conveniently right next to the pitcher. He made a mental note to stop by the kitchens this week.
“Stop by sometime,” Macmillan called over his shoulder, rejoining the main road of wandering students. He gave a wave and turned to the crowd. Theo waved after him, feeling lighter than he had in months.
Draco laughed, and then Potter laughed, and then they both stopped and Theo tried very hard to imagine he wasn’t sitting five feet away from whatever was happening around the corner. But any hopes of imagining that he wasn’t in the kitchens was shattered when a plate landed in his lap, stacked tall with profiteroles.
“Thank you, Nott,” Potter said. “Not just for this, but. For all you’ve done for us this year.”
Theo remembered. Potter didn’t take his eyes off Goodwin as Percy led Theo to a small elevated platform. Theo stuck his hands in his pockets, not sure what else to do with them.
Come to think of it, he didn’t know if he’d ever talked to either of them. Not since the start of this year, at least. Finch-Fletchley hadn’t come to Hogwarts at all last year. Theo couldn’t blame him, not with his blood status. On the other hand, Theo had remembered seeing Macmillan a few times that year, particularly with that little underground gang Potter had put together.
Blaise and Pansy scrambled into the classroom behind him, panting. The door shut swiftly behind him, and Granger pocketed her wand.
Theo sat beside him and waited. And sure enough, after less than a minute—
“Yeah,” Potter agreed, to Theo’s surprise. Either he was a lot more devious than Theo had assumed, or Draco had been rubbing off on him in turn. “If they’re going to bet behind our backs, they can take the consequences.”
Theodore Nott ignored this. The Great Hall wasn’t exactly the best place to write an essay, but the damn thing was due next class and Theo refused to choose between tardy schoolwork and a skipped meal.
Theo shrugged. “I suppose he just felt charitable.”
“Mm,” was Draco’s response.
Potter’s jaw unclenched. “He was forced—”
Draco was playing a dangerous game, antagonizing Granger. She hadn’t been all that enthusiastic about giving him a second chance this year, and she wasn’t alone. Most of the eighth-year class tiptoed around him, with the Gryffindors staring daggers at him whenever he spoke up in class and the Hufflepuffs avoiding him completely.
Nearly an hour had passed before they finally heard footsteps approach from behind the gigantic iron doors. Heads shot up one by one, and Potter fell over in a heap of robes. Weasley and Granger tried to help him up, but he threw them off, scrambling to his feet.
“Only one of you,” he said. “Don’t make me tell you again.” He looked at Macmillan. “You. Come on.”
“That’s what I thought,” Ernie said, nodding. He began tossing the bottle of ink up in the air and catching it again. Theo tried not to wince. Even if Ernie smashed it, he could theoretically get it out of the carpet with a single word. “Anyway, enough about me, how’re you? Anything from the Ministry yet?”
They each dropped a handful of sickles on the table, taking care not to let them clatter against the porcelain. The witch with the apron took no notice as they hurried behind her and escaped out the door.
Well, Theo reasoned, slipping behind a tapestry to reach his favorite hidden staircase, Draco had always been dramatic, and that had led to a few memorable lapses in judgement in their previous years.
Looking over her shoulder, Theo saw Potter put his hand on the door handle. He prepared to let out a sigh of relief once the two of them had gone—
Granger took a deep breath, held it, and let it out.
“I am
“This has nothing to do with the Ministry and you know it,” Draco said. Despite what looked like his best efforts, his voice wavered.
“Give it a chance,” he said quietly.
and Professor Augusta hovered in place, her feet a few inches off the ground. The second they were gone the entire room buzzed with chatter.
“I’ll see you in the Broomstick’s in ten,” Ernie said, “moron.”
they kept shouting, but nothing was happening.
Blaise, however, just tutted, before turning back to his parchment. “You could have just said so.”
“It was your stupid idea to go along with their stupid bet in the first place. None of this would be happening if you’d just—”
“Oh, here’s your problem,” Thomas said, pointing to Theo’s diagram. “You’ve been using the third law.”
Draco considered this. “Huh,” he said. “Well, you’re not too far off.”
It was clearly a lie, and this provided Theo with an acceptable exit strategy. He extracted himself from the table, yanking his leg out by force when it got caught again. Once he was free, he made a show of shoving his parchment and books roughly into his bag, tucking it to his chest, and stalking out of the common room, ignoring Pansy’s last call of his name— and Granger’s answering shush.
“Yes, please.”
“He’ll have a better chance if you comply,” Percy said, voice tight. He looked at the wall as he said it, as if he were breaking a code of honor by saying anything at all. “I’ll be back as soon as we’re done with the witness testimonies,” he said at last.
Blaise leaned close. “What do you think you’re doing?” he asked, voice low.
Blaise was tapping the table urgently, his fingers dangerously close to Theo’s coffee. Taking care not to spill on his parchment, Theo prodded the goblet a few inches to the left.
Theo had never been in the Hufflepuff common room, but he imagined it was something like this. Homey, with a low ceiling and dim, warm light. Probably bustling with people, with a persistent smell of sweet spices and good food. It was just down the hallway from the kitchens themselves, which was probably why Theo imagined they had similar designs. That, and because he wasn’t about to ask Macmillan or Finch-Fletchley for clarification.
“Full name?” Goodwin said crisply from the podium.
Potter looked like he was about to cry. Draco, meanwhile, had lost every drop of annoyance he’d been showing Potter. "It does make sense," he said slowly.
The South Tower itself was a bit to the south of the Great Hall, and up several flights of stairs. From the windows they could see the southern end of the lake, lined with trees, and on the horizon they could just make out the faint outline of Hogsmeade buildings, too far away to identify by name.
“Mr. Potter, you are not an impartial witness to this case,” Goodwin said plainly. “As such, your testimony cannot stand as evidence.”
The kitchens were a short jog from the lower tapestry. Theo had enough time to go over his worries once more before he tickled the pear, and the painting swung open.
“I might not get it,” Ernie muttered, but he didn’t let go of the bottle. “I’ve only ever gotten into magazines before.”
“What, and have you two sniggering behind my back every time I left the room?” Theo huffed. “Absolutely not.”
“As if
It was only a little awkward to explain how they hadn’t been deemed important enough for in-person trials, but it was downright excruciating to admit that Potter had individually sent in written testimonies for each of them, defending their innocence and advocating for their right to return to school. Pansy absently tugged on her sleeves, Blaise clamped up at the first mention of Potter's name, and even Theo felt his ears starting to burn.
Theo fell into the chair beside Pansy, who gave him an exhausted yet happy look.
“All right,” he said at last, extracting himself from the study table. His leg caught between the table and his chair, and with a grunt he tugged it free, stumbling awkwardly before catching his balance.
And he slipped out the door before they could ask him anything else, leaving an ashen-faced Potter behind.
“Well,” she said brightly, addressing the Wizengamot again. “I believe we’ve heard quite enough, are you all in agreement?” There was a general chorus of
“So did we,” Blaise said, and ignored the way Weasley began to steam. “The point being,” Blaise went on, “the world’s not at stake anymore. So if Draco wants to be ridiculous about his obvious affair, so be it, but we’re going to have fun in the meantime. Worst case? He hexes my quills for a few weeks.”
Potter was waiting in the corridor. His expression sank when he saw Theo emerge instead of Draco, and he looked at the place in the wall where the doorway had been mere moments ago. Draco had evidently removed the outer door once Theo had left. Potter looked to Theo expectantly.
“So he was right?” Theo said without thinking. It was like setting off a bomb. Draco’s cheeks went scarlet and his jawbone nearly popped out of his chin.
Theo snapped, temper getting the better of him. “Because he
“Well?” he said, looking at them all. “What’s the plan?”
“And now what?” Blaise said, looking at the door.
Potter snorted. “Sure,” he said, “yeah, that’ll go well.”
about the situation for once. Weasley really had been right, Theo thought, as he crawled out of the awkwardly-shaped hole in the wall that led to the outer corridor. Draco was a proper git.
Theo felt the extra weight of Draco’s wand in his pocket, and walked over to Potter. He pulled it out and held it. “Here,” he said. “I probably shouldn’t be the one keeping guard over this.”
He gestured down at himself.
“Er—” He looked at Draco, paled, and buried his nose back in his notebook. “It’s just, batteries don’t store electricity,” he said, voice muffled. “They’ve got chemicals in them, which react. And
After a few minutes, Draco abandoned the chair by the fire and left through the common room door, muttering something about the library. Really, Theo thought, the
Blaise cleared his throat. “Potter could serve as the Witness for the defense.”
Blaise couldn’t resist being right about something, so if Theo pretended his guess had been correct, Blaise would swallow the bait without a second thought.
Even though Draco had spent the year making Theo clean up his Polyjuice Potions, come up with excuses on the fly, and keep a room full of eighth-years distracted enough to escape with Potter in tow, he hadn’t done it because he’d wanted to make Theo’s life miserable. He’d slowly but surely earned Potter’s trust well enough to produce an honest-to-Merlin relationship, and he’d tested Theo’s patience all year because for once in his life he’d found actual happiness, untainted by threats or power.
“Mr. Potter, I believe that will do,” Goodwin said. Her voice was nearly as rigid as her robes, but it sounded a bit shaken compared to the firm tone she’d used throughout the witness testimonies. She turned to the Wizengamot members behind her. “If you wouldn’t mind restraining him properly?”
Bones took Macmillan’s arm. She was looking around the room with tears in her eyes.
“That’s better,” Draco sighed, slamming the now-empty goblet back down beside Theo’s half-written essay, and Theo tore his eyes away from Weasley. “Nothing like a good
Draco didn’t even look at it. His blank, exhausted eyes stayed fixed on the floor by his feet. Potter let go of Draco’s sleeve, and Theo let go of his own.
Potter noticed this and put a hand on her shoulder. “If it’s too much, you don’t have to do this,” he told her kindly.
Theo was always surprised when he forgot.
Both Draco and Potter froze. Potter took in the crowd with awed silence, Draco with dawning horror.
“You set me up with
Theo couldn’t help but remember how they’d met in their first year, bonding over their very first feast and marveling at the multitudes of cakes, pies, and pastries. Goyle had taken a plate back to their dorm that night, and had only agreed to share with Draco and Crabbe, not giving Theo so much as a second glance. Somewhere between the feast and that night, they’d formed their little gang, and never looked back.
“No,” Theo said, “wait, that came out wrong.” He set his porridge down along with his book and stood. “I meant to ask if I could do something.”
“Yeah, about,” Theo agreed. “All the eighth-year Slytherins, anyway.”
She took the rulebook from Weasley and began to read it, taking a seat beside him. Theo took that as his cue to stop paying attention, and went to find Blaise and Pansy. They were talking to one another in a corner alongside Finnigan and Thomas, and Theo sat down beside them.
If Theo had put money on it, he would have bet on Potter being the more expressive one. But now as he watched them react to the news that there was an underground betting ring about their love life, he wondered how he’d ever assumed someone could be more dramatic than Draco. While Potter's nostrils just flared, Draco skipped pink and went straight to scarlet.
damn it, he was supposed to be good at this. “Draco does have a point,” he said. “Unless you’re using Legilimency right now, you can’t actually know what Potter’s thinking. Or what's best for him.”
“I’m not going to lose my case,” Draco muttered.
“So,” Blaise said, voice deliberately calm, “you look… tired.”
“By all means.” Theo’s head was starting to spin. “Come on. If we leave now she might not see us going.” He glanced at the witch by the front counter, who had inserted herself into the nearby table’s conversation and appeared to have forgotten about them entirely. Theo could only hope.
Theo had no idea how Draco managed to avoid trouble from Granger, Weasley, or Potter after turning into Weasley for a quarter of an hour, but by the end of their first day back from the holidays, none of the Gryffindors were acting out of the ordinary. Maybe their new N.E.W.T. prep work was enough to distract from the fact that Weasley had shown up the next morning for breakfast, received no gracious welcome, and acted sore for an entire hour.
“As we have established,” Goodwin said, with a note of irritation. “Moving on. Regardless of whether or not he cast it with intent to harm, Mr. Malfoy had sufficient knowledge and practice of this curse to cast it both instinctively and nonverbally,” she said. “Mr. Nott, do you refute this statement?”
“So what exactly don’t you understand?” Thomas asked, licking strawberry cream off his thumb.
“Fifth,” Thomas said, “I think. No, it must have been fourth, I don’t think Umbridge allowed us brooms if we weren’t on the team.”
“This is stupid,” he said, dropping his book down and gesturing at it angrily. “Even Muggles don’t understand batteries. Why do I need to?”
“Change your date,” Potter said, grinning madly.  “Tell Zabini you want to put your money on the day after exams. June 21st.” He looked at Draco. “I don’t know how you’re going to go on trial a day after sitting through a seventh-year History of Magic exam, honestly, I don’t.”
“There,” Blaise said, pointing to the mouth of the hall.
of them. I’m just proud I didn’t blow the exam room up before time was out.” He snorted. “I singed off a bit of my eyebrow, though, look.”
“Oh?” Draco said, successfully cutting out the offending splotch and poking it off his plate onto the table.
Potter watched forlornly as Finnigan shut the door to the dormitory behind him, sealing away their last chance of escape. Right. It was down to Theo. All he had to do was get Thomas to explain what in Merlin’s name
“Oh.” Draco looked back down at his book. “As opposed to…”
By the time the Easter holidays arrived, Theo was well and truly ready for a break.
This was a bad thing. This was such a bad thing. The eighth-years were all here on special terms to finish their education, none more than Draco. He’d barely been allowed to come back to Hogwarts at all. So why,
?” Potter gestured at Theo without looking at him. “I’m not going to just throw your freedom away because you want to—”
“I’ll help,” Theo said quickly. “If it’s something small, I can probably figure it out. If I can’t, though, we should probably go to—” He broke off awkwardly, already having forgotten the name of Weasley’s suggestion.
Granger’s quill stilled. She kissed Weasley’s cheek. “Thanks, Ron.”
Granger scribbled something down on Pansy’s essay, not bothering to look up as she addressed Draco. “I didn’t spend months camping out in the wilderness in the middle of winter, hiding from Snatchers and Death Eaters and Voldemort himself,” she said, striking a red line sharply over the parchment, “so I could come back here and take advice from
Blaise frowned at the keypad. “Magical Office of Law is on level five,” he explained.
“Making my coffee in the morning hardly counts as slave labor.” Theo raised an eyebrow. “I’m just asking you to keep the suspicious absences at a minimum. For two weeks. Shag in the middle of the night, like normal people. Sneak out after hours. Surely it’s not that hard.”
Theo bent down and tugged his own wand from his shoe.
Theo smirked. “Plus a few Slytherins, for good measure.”
Even Potter was quiet. He sat alone by the fireplace, balling his right hand into a fist over and over.
Draco, who had been trying to carve out the tainted spot from his stack of pancakes, either hadn’t heard the request, or chose to ignore it. Theo was prepared for this.
Theo quickly checked to make sure that neither Potter nor Draco were among the mass of students lining Honeydukes wall to wall. It was the last trip before Christmas, and everyone was buying presents for their families— or buying presents for themselves under the pretense of buying for their families. Theo had come to Honeydukes with the intention of finding something for his stepfather, but he wasn’t sure Ice Mice or exploding bonbons would travel well by owl.
“I just can’t believe no one else saw him,” he said, tutting. “I mean, Potter walking around with a Slytherin tie? I’m surprised there wasn’t a schoolwide announcement.”
“It was not a
Heart sinking, Theo put on a blank expression. Blaise wrinkled his nose. “Cut that out,” he said. “Theo, are you going to tell me what’s actually going on?”
“Nor are they yours,” Draco said, still not bothering to show his face. They heard a loud page turning.
on his neck, and I said, ‘so that’s where you were last night, curled up in a Slytherin four poster,’ and he just laughed his head off and asked if I’d drunk firewhiskey instead of pumpkin juice.” He shook his head, bewildered. “And then I looked over and saw that git in red, and—”
He made it halfway to the door before—
Theo sighed. “I take it the visit in February didn’t go well?”
“Harry, I
“He’s really not that bad,” Theo said awkwardly, following Weasley down the stone steps that led to the dungeons. “You just have to break through the, er, shell.”
Sensing the dispute was over, Percy grabbed a handful of floo powder from a dish fastened to the wall beside the fireplace and threw it at his feet. Brilliant green flames sprung up to his waist.  He met Weasley’s eyes for another fraction of a second, dug his heels into the coals, and—
Theo turned. “What.”
“Well, yeah, but—” Weasley shrugged. “We’re different. Saved the world together, all that.”
“Then just— don’t shag
Potter’s jaw clamped shut. He spun on his heel and stalked away without another word, though the dramatic exit was slightly ruined when he had to clamber out of the hole in the wall. Once he was out of sight, Draco began to rub his eyes in frustration.
“I don’t know if you were used to keeping people up in the Gryffindor dorms,” Draco had drawled, adding another voice into the mix. “But I seem to remember much less talking and much more
“Mm.” Blaise sighed. “Well, if you’re sure everything’s fine, then I’ll lay off.” Theo sagged in relief, and Blaise turned to head for the door. “Oh,” he said, turning back. “And— Theo?”
By April 16th, Theo was going to pass away, a decrepit old man driven to madness.
. Ron's immune," Potter said, and snorted. "He’s allowed to bully her back, now that they’re. You know.”
“Oh, for the bitterroot balm?” Finnigan said, tearing his eyes off the box of Fudge Flies. “Yeah, that one’s a bastard. Dean made a good enough batch, though.” He laughed. “I always sit next to him, cause he takes the best notes.” He paused for a moment, looked at the box again, and then back at Theo. “If you want,” he said, scratching the back of his neck, “I could ask to borrow ‘em for you?”
The doors shut and the lift jolted, sending them upwards. Theo caught Blaise’s eye and raised an eyebrow.
And he swept out of the common room with a swish of his robes, leaving a dumbfounded Theo in his wake.
“Ernie’s gay?” Potter said blankly, clearly three steps behind.
“This has everything to do with the Ministry, Draco. Why do you think I’m doing
Here it was. They’d nearly gone a whole month without stirring up trouble, and now—
“Macmillan?” Theo said blankly.
“Merlin’s pants,” Theo breathed.
Thomas's jaw dropped. “They’re trying him with the whole Wizengamot? Are you joking?”
“Malfoy,” she said at last. “I’m— sorry.”
huh,” Theo said. “You finally found an opening?”
“Yeah, a bit,” Theo agreed. “But a couple years ago we wouldn’t have thought that was possible.”
“Of course it mattered.” Potter smiled at the wand. “Someone knew.”
she started, thrusting her wand forward. Draco instinctively stepped back, but his foot met air. He slashed his wand through the air with a shout, and violent purple flames erupted from the tip.
If we carry on like this, with Nott around to cover us—”
has that kind of patience,” Weasley said, laughing. The odd tension broke, and Weasley leaned back against a cabinet, folding his arms and reminiscing. “So when did this even start, anyway?” he asked, after a moment's thought.
it read.
“I— suppose—” Theo spluttered. “But it wouldn’t be sporting to win a bet if you know the winning number, would it?” This was it, one last appeal, targeting Potter's morality. Unfortunately, Potter happened to be sitting next to Draco.
a vial will be provided for you.” She looked to Percy, who nodded importantly, then back at Theo. “Do you swear upon Ulick Gamp and the memory of the Wizard’s Council to speak the full truth as you know it today?”
“Mm.” Draco nodded. After dumping a veritable mountain of sugar on his plate, he grabbed a few sausages and a piece of toast. He carefully wedged the bread between the pancakes and sausages, keeping them safely separated. Theo didn’t imagine German
Granger nodded. It looked like it took her a great deal of effort not to say more.
“No!” Theo said instantly, trying not to laugh. “No, definitely not.”
Christmas morning came, and Theo found himself almost alone in the common room with Thomas’s notes laid neatly above his textbook. The study table was empty for once, and the only other people in the room were keeping to themselves, thank
So the fact that Potter was late held absolutely no interest to either Theo or Blaise.
“They were surprised he knew what a vacuum cleaner was,” he muttered as he passed by Theo.
“Well, that’s the point, isn’t it?” Finnigan pressed. “You’re not supposed to.”
“I am,” Weasley said, facing her— he was probably the only person in Hogwarts who would dare to stand up to Granger. Theo took a careful step back. “Come on, ‘Mione. I’m sore at Harry, and Zabini’s right— it’s not like we’re going behind his back and having a drink with Greyback. This is just a bit of fun. We’re not hurting anyone.”
Theo found Blaise and Pansy in the back left corner with an empty seat saved between them. Blaise had his grey scarf tied backwards to keep it out of harm’s way from the dirt, and Pansy had a thick knitted hat pulled down to her eyes. Blaise caught Theo’s eye and gestured him over. Theo’s stomach began to tie itself into a large, complicated knot as he squeezed his way to the back of the greenhouse, trying not to knock anything over with his bookbag.
Theo settled against a far wall, taking care that his legs didn’t get in the way of the house-elves running to and fro, and pulled out his book.
“All right, all right,” Professor Sprout said thickly, announcing her entrance from the doorway. “Enough chit-chatting, let’s get to work.”
“You know that for sure, do you?” Blaise asked, not missing a beat.
“And Hufflepuffs,” Theo added. “And Ravenclaws.”
“Welcome to my world,” Weasley said, yawning. “Merlin, I’m tired. It’s not that late, is it?”
“Fair point,” Blaise agreed. Pansy huffed, but took the hint and didn't argue.
Granger folded her arms. “Not in those words, exactly.”
“So Blaise is involved,” Draco muttered. “Interesting.”
Macmillan returned ten minutes later, with Percy in tow.
“What?” Macmillan blinked. “But Seamus said—”
“What? Now?” For the first time since coming down for breakfast, Theo looked up at the mass of people swarmed around the Great Hall tables. “They can’t be,” he said, squinting through the ocean of students to better see the Gryffindor table. “It’s only been a month.”
“Oh, yeah?” Finch-Fletchley rolled his eyes. “I’m sure you were. Because you’re so willing to stick your neck out for someone like me.”
Exactly a month after the Battle of Hogwarts, as it was now known, the students in their year had each received a letter from the Ministry. The ones written to the Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw class had been fairly cut-and-dry, simply outlining plans for an eighth-year class and assuring them that they would be safe behind the walls of Hogwarts.
“Yes, I can,” Theo said quickly, before she could interpret his silence as an answer.
Macmillan shrugged. “He didn’t mean to curse her.” He looked away. “And. You know. He deserves his freedom, and all that.”
Potter laughed behind the chair, and Theo saw the tuft of hair duck out of sight for a moment.
Granger gently touched Potter’s arm. “Think about it. Even even if your account wasn’t biased, their view of it would be.”
“Excuse me,” she said, taking a step forward. Bold as she was to question Goodwin’s words, she still looked uncharacteristically nervous in front of the podium. “I would think that, given the circumstances, Harry’s testimony would be more important than ever,” she said, sounding a little out of breath. “I mean, if he of all people has, er...” She hesitated. “Has seen past the defendant’s flaws enough to—” She cleared her throat. “To enter a relationship. With him,” she said at last. “Then surely he offers a unique and therefore invaluable perspective?”
“All right. You’re hopeless, you know,” Granger told Potter fondly.
“It’s complicated.” Theo sighed. Did everyone in their year think he was mooning over Potter? How long would this go on? Probably until the end of the year, when everything would come out, so to speak. In the meantime, it wasn’t the worst rumor in the world to have hanging over his head like a neon banner. Theo would survive.
“I saw him wearing a red tie.” Theo shrugged, setting the coffee pitcher down. “And I saw Potter wearing a green one. That doesn’t necessarily mean anything.” He took a long drag from his goblet and set it down beside his plate.
“It’s
“—then we don’t have to worry about anything getting out, or anyone getting proof or going to the
Finnigan frowned. “What the—?”
“Mm,” Theo said. “Coffee, please.”
“Did you see that—”
It was frankly bizarre that Draco was here, living and studying with the rest of them, when just a year ago he’d been working with the Dark Lord— Merlin’s sake,
Potter didn’t seem to notice anything was amiss. He ambled to the Gryffindor table with one hand tucked in his robe pocket, and plopped down in an empty spot between Granger and Weasley about halfway down the hall.
“Yes, I do,” Potter snapped. “He’ll call me a coward for not wanting to say anything, to his mother, to anyone else, to—”
signals.
Theo hastily scribbled back,
“Who’s first?” Percy asked, sounding very prim. “Come on, step forward.”
Theo sided with Weasley’s argument that, as he’d saved the wizarding world a few times over, it didn’t really matter what Potter’s N.E.W.T. scores were. If he wanted a position in the Ministry, or the England National Quidditch team, or hell, even Hogwarts, it would be gifted to him on a golden platter. Yet Potter could be seen every night, hunched over on the chair by the fire with a mug of coffee hovering inches away from his face and a stack of books in his lap. Perhaps he wanted to prove that he deserved whatever position he got, when it came to that.
The wizard stood upright at once. Weasley, Potter, and Granger all sucked in identical breaths. Judging by the shock of red hair on the wizard, Theo could only assume that he was a relative of Weasley’s.
Theo stared at the door for a full ten seconds, trying to figure out how he’d turned into a professional relationship counselor in the span of three months. When he came up empty, he rubbed a palm over his face, groaning.
Potter bustled in through the door, drawing nearly everyone’s attention as usual. But instead of giving the study group a wide berth, this time he made a beeline straight for it. Theo glanced nervously at Draco, but Draco hadn’t even looked up. He marked a line on his parchment with a little extra vigor, jawline snapping into focus as he clenched it.
unless he consents, which is pretty damn unlikely, so I doubt a word of what he says will be true.”
“You don’t think they’ll talk?” Theo asked, trying to sound concerned. He, of course, didn’t care one way or the either what people said about Potter, but he knew these two did. Weasley’s grin faded and Granger bit her lip, starting to pace again.
Draco, of course, was nowhere in sight. He’d been delivered to the Ministry early that morning to be prepared for his questioning, and Theo had watched him being carted out of sight, trembling hands and all.
Theo didn’t have long to ponder this, because at that exact moment something crashed boisterously against the right wall. The underlying conversation faded at once, several people yelped, and before Theo saw her move at all, Granger had her wand in her hand.
“I see,” Goodwin said. “And your father was involved with Mr. Dolohov and the rest of the Death Eaters who broke into the Ministry of Magic in 1996?”
in Merlin’s name had he chosen
“S’ not the point,” Draco drawled, uncrossing his legs lazily. “It’s his life, not yours. So it’s none of your business.”
“To be honest,” Theo said, “I haven’t seen him in hours.”
“I’m still mad you didn’t tell me you were pulling Malfoy,” Weasley muttered. “But if it’ll make you happy, I
“Uh,” Theo said, over the crest of his profiterole mountain. “In my defense,” he said, “I thought you were going to the library.”
Theo took a sorrowful bite out of one of the pies. It was strawberry rhubarb.
don’t make my life any harder than it has to be.”
were involved.
It was impossible to hear what any of them were saying, or even identify who was talking. Theo suspected the antechamber was enchanted to prevent witnesses from overhearing one another or listening in on the defendant’s plea.
“No,” Theo said, biting his lip to distract from the immense pain. “We were just— on our way down to Slughorn’s.”
“Maybe because Blaise
Granger’s face fell. “If you’re sure,” she said, and gave Weasley a hurt and puzzled look before heading back to the table.
Theo grit his teeth, hoping this would imply that perhaps bringing up the fact that Draco had been blackmailing him since November wasn’t the greatest idea.
to life, and Weasley’s kin appeared, holding a thickly bound book. He didn’t meet Weasley’s eyes. “Here,” he said, holding it out. “Wizengamot court rules, edition seven-point-oh-four, current as of last fortnight.”
“I know,” Potter said. “Come on. Levitate her so we can get her down the hall.”
Macmillan snorted. “You’ve got that right.”
Goyle was hauled out of the room, and Percy Weasley ushered the eighth-years outside after him.
“Shit,” Weasley hissed, cutting him off. “Shit,
No one was presently working on it, as there were probably many more pressing matters to attend to than a fountain centerpiece. In the meantime it served as a convenient warning to all who entered that the Ministry was rather threadbare at the moment.
“Of course, we won’t say anything to Draco,” Theo said, “you know, because it’s against the rules.” He let that hang in the air for a second before snapping his fingers. “I’ve got it,” he said, looking at Granger; in her pacing she’d ended up closer to him than Weasley was, and it would probably look suspicious if Theo directed this over her shoulder and ignored her. “We need to get your lot in on it too,” he said.
Theo had expected Draco to take at least a fortnight to sort himself out, so when they talked things out in just a matter of days, Theo took it as a welcome relief. But now, a week after they’d made up, he was starting to wish they were still fighting.
