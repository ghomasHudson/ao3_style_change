'Yes you do, if you're sleeping right where he can hex you or poison you or carry you off to You-Know-Who!'
'It's sort of my house,' Harry shrugs, when Cho seems disinclined to speak first.  'It's headquarters now.  Have you had, er, a good summer?'
“Ron,” Harry said, and his throat tightened around the word, he couldn’t say any more. He hoped Ron got the message. After swallowing several times, he said, “But it doesn’t matter, Malfoy’s the same he’s always been. You were right.”
“Sorry, mate,” he said, “even Dudley doesn’t deserve such an end. Nobody does.” He considered. “Well, maybe that git Malfoy.”
side, and this last betrayal infuriated him. He’d had enough of all of it, even this awful embarrassment that surged up every time he even heard her name. “Yeah?” he challenged, before he could stop himself. “You didn’t seem to think so the other night, did you?”
'I said come on,' Harry says impatiently.  'I bet the Apparation wards are still in place here.  We'll have to go out back.'
'Not really,' Harry said, grinning as he leaned in. 'Are you going to get your trousers down, or do I have to do it for you?'
Harry half-smiles.  'I know,' he says.  'Come on, Malfoy.  We can Apparate from the transfer point this time.  Let's go.'
“Yeah, now’s okay,” Harry agreed, glancing down the street towards Honeydukes. He stepped out into the street, heading in that direction.
Harry took the letter from Kingsley back and crammed it in his pocket. 'Then you think I should testify.'
He thrust his way through the agitated crowd, though he was stopped multiple times, once by a red-faced, tall man who seized him by the throat and repeated the first witch's desperate request. 'He killed my wife,' the man shouted, 'killed her right in front of our children! This is no kind of justice, where murderers walk free!'
Ron groaned, then, and interrupted her. “Must you talk about work even when we’re not in lessons?” he demanded.
Harry snorts and shoves at Malfoy's elbow, which is now digging into his hip.  Idiotically feeling somehow safer, having a warm body next to him in the middle of nowhere, Harry falls asleep and if he dreams at all, he doesn't remember in the morning.
If anything, McGonagall was blushing. 'Professor Clearwater stops by for my opinion from time to time, yes,' she said crisply. 'Now mind you keep your marks up, Potter.'
better,” said Ginny scornfully—and leaned into the Three Broomsticks, but the only person he knew in there was Luna, alone in the corner looking dreamy and stirring her drink. As he was leaving, Terry Boot and Michael Corner jostled past him, and Terry nudged him hello on the shoulder, but he wasn’t in the mood for talking to them, either.
'Let's be reasonable, my dear boy,' Doge pleaded. 'The war is over, and the people of Britain deserve to feel safe in their homes, to go on in peace without these reminders of what was.'
“What was that all about today, Potter?” he asked, turning away from Pansy. “There was no need to get in such a snit, you know—"
'Oh, no, you don't,' she said before Harry could even open his mouth. 'I've already been spat on by half of Hogwarts this morning, I changed robes twice, so don't you come over here and shake your high and mighty finger at me—'
“I’ve done all right, have I?” Harry challenged. “How about Cedric, then? Sirius? Seamus? Are they all right?” Before Ron could open his mouth, Harry plowed on, “Who’s next, your mum and dad? Charlie? Ginny? Maybe Hermione, what about her—"
“I had a Puffskein once,” he said, ducking out the door after Harry. “Handy little thing. Ginny liked to play with it, too. Of course, Fred and George stole it to use as a Bludger, and that was the end of that. Mum scolded them for days. I still think that’s why Percy gave me Scabbers.”
“He wasn’t punished, but instead got a new house, married and lived happily ever after. Don’t you care about those he killed? People he murdered and tortured?”
“No, no, it’s obvious! Scorp, trust me, I’ve heard it myself. You know I spend my time in the greenhouses, right? And one day, I was there, and papa and Neville came in. And papa admitted out loud that he likes Harry. Why don’t you believe me?”
“I should hope so,” Draco commented. “But no, I know what you mean. I have to talk to you about something, though. It’s serious.”
“The bed moved when you got up,” Cassie shrugged. She and Phi moved towards the table to eat their breakfast, but Scorpius put his plate on the table and curled up in a corner of the sofa. Harry shared a look with James and opened his mouth to say something to Scorpius, when an owl tapped against the window.
“But Lucius looked like he could kill you? Don’t worry, that’s his normal face. Especially around you. So they approved?”
Theresa walked into the classroom, where Draco was already preparing the cauldrons. They had decided to do the experimental brewing on Sunday today, because last Friday had been the Valentine’s Ball.
The body that crashed into his wasn’t his daughter’s. Draco’s eyes flew open and he wasn’t tired anymore. Potter had buried his head in Draco’s neck and clutched his pyjama shirt. He was shaking violently, completely tense and obviously scared of whatever he had dreamt.
There is some French in this chapter, so in case you can't guess what it says, the translation is down below.
“You will all have to testify, of course, but we will approach you at another moment. You might first all want to talk to a Mind Healer or someone that can help you. Is tomorrow a good moment to come back?”
“Potter… you do know you’re allowed to come here, even if you don’t have a nightmare, right? Even if you just want to talk. Or have a fun night.”
Potter nodded then and asked a bit more about Draco’s research. While Draco was talking, Potter broke the white chocolate in a few pieces and drizzled the molten pure chocolate over it, then handed one bowl to Draco. He took it absent-mindedly, still rambling on about the technicalities of his research, when he popped one piece in his mouth and immediately let his head fall backward.
“So, the first boy would never have had a chance with the girl, because they were too alike. The second guy,
Right outside the Great Hall, as if she had been readying herself to walk into the Hall herself, there was Astoria, looking pretty as ever. Unfortunately, she knew how she looked and didn’t hesitate to stick her nose in the air. Aquila was much lovelier.
They worked quietly, more efficient than Draco had expected. Though he shouldn’t have been surprised: Harry was a hard worker and, despite all Draco’s taunts back at school, actually a rather quick study. Harry finished his last box earlier than Draco, watching Draco work for a while.
Without saying anything, Draco turned on his side and threw an arm over Potter’s chest, watching him closely.
“I just don’t know how he is. I’m afraid he won’t make it. And what am I supposed to do when Scorpius dies?”
Draco nodded. “All right. When you were born, there were many difficulties. The Healers tried to deliver you carefully, but you got hurt and you released accidental magic. That happens more often when toddlers get hurt, but it usually isn’t as noticeable or strong as yours was. The magic created a blockade when it reacted with your mother’s. The Healers couldn’t see through the blockade, and couldn’t check up on you anymore. They decided to link your feelings to me, so that if I got hurt somewhere, they knew to be more careful. But the magical blockade made the spell they used go wonky. It felt like a clumsy Legilimens was poking through my head. My theory is that all my memories and thoughts from that moment were conveyed to you, so that you see things that happened to me, or that you think things I used to think. When you were finally delivered, they cast the counterspell, so we don’t still share a mind, but they couldn’t reverse what had already happened.”
Septimius handed Whithal a paper, which Whithal then handed to the chairman of the Wizengamot. Papers were also handed to every member of the audience. Doctor Selaminder frowned. The audience wasn't supposed to get such papers.
“I hate it that you are allowed to base your reputation on the war, and I can’t. I could protect you so well if people were still scared of me,” Draco complained.
Draco nodded. “I’ve been waiting for this day for a few weeks now. I can’t wait to walk into the Great Hall and make those students quiver in their shoes, because the Potions NEWTS won’t be cancelled.”
Theresa nodded again, smiling now. She quickly started explaining what she would do to make the potion, occasionally looking at the instruction paper Draco had written for himself. When the potion was calmly brewing and they didn’t have anything to do anymore, except for stir a couple of times, Theresa seemed to relax a bit and chattered about things different from brewing.
“And just to emphasise the point: Not under any circumstances do I tolerate students bullying or mocking others. Not even Gryffindors. I know they can be annoying and pushy, but please, try to keep your composure,” he smirked.
“Unless the Aurors decide to hit them with a domestic trial as well. That they supported me in whatever I did to my children. I wouldn’t put it past Whithal.”
In his room, there was a note pasted on his door with a Sticking Charm, only to be read and unstuck by him. Tired as he was, with his eyes falling closed, he just tore the note off, and took it with him inside, as well, placing it on his nightstand, and falling asleep as soon as his head hit his pillow.
He saw Scorpius’s fingers spasm for a moment. “Scorp?” Draco murmured. When he got no response, he clenched his jaw and accepted that he had just imagined the movement.
“You did, Malfoy. All flirty and cute. Don’t get me wrong, it was adorable to look at, but you could have toned it down a little. He’s quite straight.”
Draco was opening all kinds of bags and boxes that kept ingredients, spoons, cauldrons and so much more. He felt like drooling over all this beautiful equipment.
“What about a song?” Blaise yelled, eyes sparkling. Draco was glad he had a constant Silencing Charm around his living room, so Phi wouldn’t wake up.
“Terence, can you tell us whether it is true?” she asked nicely. Terence, and Priscus, kept their mouth shut. Draco saw they were morphing their faces into something akin to innocence. He also saw that McGonagall was about to let them go.
“The note. The trial. Shit, Cassie has been distant and odd this year. The way she has behaved isn’t like her. Pansy explained it away as puberty, but if I think of the rest of this year, I wouldn’t be surprised if her behaviour had something to do with it.”
Potter opened the door to Draco’s apartment and set about preparing tea while Draco sunk down on the sofa. “You really are an idiot, you know. Here.”
Whithal let out a huff of derogatory laughter. “You may stop the pacing, Mr. Malfoy-Potter. And how convenient that you leave out the article in that same law stating that earlier trials may re-occur if one suspects a pattern.”
Harry blinked rapidly to digest this information, but got himself together enough to sign the paper for Harky. When Harky left, James burst out laughing.
“I taught Scorpius never to blame himself as long as other people don’t blame him. Can you find out what is bothering him? Perhaps there are students nagging him about it.”
Potter nodded, impressed. “Sounds plausible. Except for the fact that I only mentioned the Map twice, and never elaborated on who made it or how it got in my possession. Besides, it’s near impossible to sneak into my room. Magical barriers, Malfoy.”
Sighing softly, Draco searched for his wand to turn on the music. When he couldn’t find it, Phi told him to sing a cappella and yawned. At Potter’s curious smile, Draco leant his head back and took Potter’s hand behind Phi’s back.
“Then, I would want you to go to sleep right now, because it is already far past your bedtime. Come on, close the book. You ought to sleep.”
From now on, you will be brewing from hand-outs, on which the instructions will be correct. In short, you won’t have to bring your Potions books to class anymore. You’ll only have to use it for assignments.”
Potter’s face falls. What did he just say? Potter offered him the handshake he always wanted. Why is he being such an idiot?
Hence, dinner was quiet at the High Table, mostly because Draco and Potter were sending off such awkward vibes that all other teachers did not dare talking to either one of them.
“They did. I don’t even want to know what they have done to Cassiopeia, and Merlin knows I don’t want to stand and watch to see them do anything to Ophiuchus. Those children are innocent, completely innocent. And to think that probably half of Slytherin House has been hurt by them, one way or another! Do you really want to let Priscus get away with a few points taken and a few days of detention?”
“And failed. He knew that Riddle used this curse, and he spent all his free hours researching possibilities of a counterpotion or counterspell. And you know how good he is at magical theory. If even he is unable to find something, I don’t see how anyone else can.”
“What, that you’ll storm in there and take her back yourself? There is nothing you can do, Albus. In fact, there is nothing
Draco just stared at the Boggart. This couldn’t be it, there had to be more to it. So he waited patiently, watching his worst fear in front of him, not casting the Riddikulus spell before he knew exactly what his Boggart would be.
A moment later, the conversation continued, with Narcissa delicately steering it back to what matters. “What else have you been hiding for us?”
“Benefits of coming from a pureblood family with a long history at Hogwarts. Thousands of family books with Hogwarts secrets are in our library. In the restricted section, of course.”
In the kitchenette, Draco pulled out his good bottle of Firewhiskey and prepared it like he now knew Potter wanted it; on the rocks. Having poured a neat one for himself, he proffered the drink to Potter, who was now solemnly looking at the newspaper on Draco’s coffee table.
They stared over the white landscape which was steadily becoming whiter with every snowflake, cuddling close together. Draco smiled faintly. This was what quality time with Scorpius always entailed; silent pondering, letting the other think about whatever was going on in their lives, and the surety of the other’s presence and support.
McGonagall looked at Priscus. “I reckon they won’t tell you themselves, so I will. As I said, they have bullied first-years, but their only victims were Slytherins. They have abused them and hexed many into Madam Pomfrey’s care. They even carved some students’ arms with sharp materials, so that it bled and scarred. As you see, it is something I can and will not allow in my school.”
“Didn’t you play Quidditch with…” Draco hesitated slightly before he decided to ignore his discomfort. “With Ginny? When you were married, I mean.”
The only thing that had really changed was the way Draco was seen by the other Houses. Most Ravenclaws had never dared –or wanted- to speak ill of Draco, since Aquila was a valued student of their House and because she could be terrifying if she wanted to. The Gryffindors had accepted Draco when they saw that the Potter and Weasley children liked him. But the Hufflepuffs had always eyed him warily. They sat far away from his desk, they tried to blend into the walls when he walked past, and they never voluntarily talked to him, before the holidays. Now, though, they greeted him with a smile or a polite nod and some even asked questions about the potions they were brewing. It was a significant change, one that pleased Draco –and Potter- immensely. Even though Draco had no idea what had inspired this change of attitude, he didn’t mention it or think too long about it, in fear it was just a bubble that could snap under the slightest pressure.
“This afternoon, he decided to ply me with Veritaserum. Luckily, it’s just Neville, so I know he knows he owes me big time.”
“You’re a sap,” Neville declared, surprised. “Inside that little wall of stone and ice and armour you’ve built around you, is the softest and most romantic person I’ve ever met!”
Draco pretended to think, but his daughters knew him too well. They saw a small crinkle in the corners of his eyes, indicating his mirth. Draco’s pointer finger went up to his earlobe and then back down to his chin. Cassie grinned.
Potter grinned. “No, it wouldn’t. But I know you want to keep him. He looks so much like you, when you were a ferret!”
“Good. So, you will be divided in two groups, one of which will be supervised by me, and the other by Malfoy. No, hold on, you are not divided in Slytherin-Gryffindor. It will be mixed. I’ll give you a number, and everyone with number one can go to Malfoy, and number two goes with me.”
Draco took the bag of groceries from Potter before sweeping his arm around. “The sea is just a couple hundred yards that way, along the treeline. The herb garden is on the other side of the house. I’ll show you when we go there to grab herbs for dinner.”
Draco shouldn’t have befriended Potter, and Merlin knows, he shouldn’t have fallen for him. His children shouldn’t have to be burdened by Draco’s mistakes, and honestly, Draco shouldn’t have become a father in the first place.
Sighing, Draco sat up a bit and turned to face Potter, now leaning into the backrest of the sofa. Potter tugged him close again, so that Draco’s head rested on his chest and they could see each other if either one wished to.
The next day, Boxing Day, Draco was woken, again against his own wishes, by a more than enthusiastic Potter.
Draco bit back a bark of laughter. Look at that, Potter admitting that this kind of clothing could actually feel comfortable. Draco would raise him well after all.
“Why are you nervous?” Potter mumbled, a quill behind his ear and smudges of ink along his fingers. There was a crinkle between his eyes, and he was biting his lower lip in concentration. His eyes flicked along the lines, his hand made easy scratches with the quill whenever he had a comment on the wording. The lightning scar was almost invisible in the half-light.
The music started and Draco waved the lights back on, throwing a smirk over his shoulder and winking at Blaise. He started moving when he also started singing, but the music stopped abruptly.
“He has about fifteen different robes for formal occasions. Meaning, fifteen black, silk robes, hand-made and tailored just for him. He also has seven white robes, for weddings. The only difference between those are the colour of the stitches, ‘because one should always adjust to the chosen colour-schemes.’ And he’s got three casual robes, but he never wears those, because they are plebeian. And then he has an infinite amount of robes in all kinds of colours, varying from soft yellow to bright pink to Bordeaux red.”
Scorpius and Albus looked around. Chairs and desks were removed from the classroom, so the two of them shrugged and went to stand in the front of the group students.
’ was written on it, in a shaky, almost unreadable handwriting. Harry curiously bent forward to pick it up and fold it out. It was a letter, more than four feet long. The first words were written in neat, cursive handwriting, which got increasingly worse, until the handwriting changed entirely.
Harry stood frozen to the spot as Draco walked away. So many emotions hit him at once he hardly knew which one to deal with first. Draco was here, he had actually come. But, he had also seen Harry naked as the day he was born. And finally, thankfully, he had turned his back just seconds before ‘little Harry’ had rejoined the party.
“I didn’t come here for a mothers meeting, Potter, I came here for answers,” Draco spat, finally locking eyes with Harry.
Draco looked thoughtful for a moment and slowly rose to his feet, pacing across the kitchen floor and peering out of the window. “I thought for sure you would have moved Weasley into this place.”
“Well, of course I am. I wish that they would have just run, somewhere far, far away where we could have lived in peace,” Harry sighed, “But he would have hunted them. Hunted
Folding his clothes neatly on top of the bedside table, Draco opened the wardrobe and found an oversized white t-shirt, marvelling at the fact that it was on a hanger and even appeared to have been ironed. Harry really did have too much time on his hands. Pulling it over his head, Draco regarded himself in the mirror mounted to the wardrobe door. He was thinner that he had been, not that there was ever much weight on him to begin with, making the t-shirt all the looser on his narrowed frame.
Slowly it dawned on Harry that Draco’s mother had been Sirius’ cousin, no doubt the family would have visited Grimmauld Place on occasion. He nodded slowly in understanding, pulling open a cupboard and taking down two mugs and a small pot of sugar before making his way to the fridge for the milk.
Harry woke late the next day, sunlight blazing through the thin curtains on his bedroom, but he made no effort to get out of bed. What would be the point? Yet another day of dusting and staring into space, coupled with the new, crushing disappointment of the night before.
Draco flinched at the memory, but still he said nothing. “All you ever cared about was your family, you loved them too much to refuse their wishes. In summary,” Harry swept on, determined to finish, “I think that you’re angry at yourself for the way you acted and you’re trying to push it back on me because it’s easy and familiar and nothing about the past six months has been anything of the sort.”
Draco regarded the stiff way in which she sat, no doubt a product of careful training as a member of the Black family, tall and proud but most likely at the cost of any kind of comfort. He tried to imagine what she might be like if she had been born to some other family. Would she slouch down in the chair, or perhaps lay on her belly on the rug? Would she have grown her hair long and let it flow about her shoulders and down her back? Would she abandon the pretence of the book, play the song she had recalled aloud and dance around the house without a care in the world?
“Mum’s a lot more settled than she was, think she’s coming to terms with it a bit more. George still isn’t quite right though, but I don’t suppose he will ever be quite the same as he was before.”
Ron chewed noisily on the toast, making Harry miss the demure way in which Draco ate and drank almost silently. His eyes briefly flicked to the empty seat at the other side of the table and felt a little sadness at the fact of it’s emptiness.
Draco hovered in the doorway of one room that had ocean blue walls and a white bedspread, topped with a royal blue blanket. Pine furniture sat about the place, the tops and handles of each painted white. Draco was drawn to it, the room somehow felt like standing on a beach and breathing the fresh air.
Harry could feel the prickle of tears in his eyes but pushed the feeling away. He was comfortable enough talking with Draco, but crying was a whole new level of vulnerability he wasn’t ready for and he knew that if they carried on, he would give way to it. He looked up at Draco, and found his gaze unfocused, staring unseeingly at the pale green stripes that adorned the end of the bed covers. “Go back to bed, you look like you’re about to go under.”
Draco shook the thought from his head. Thinking about the day his father was sentenced made his insides hurt.
Harry set down a plate of toast between them on the kitchen table and settled back into his seat. “Why?” he asked, taking a large bite out of his slice.
A creak from behind him made him smile a little. “Back again?” Turning slowly, he was greeted with the now familiar gaze of Draco, leaning in the kitchen doorway and looking a little apprehensive.
“No, I will not. Draco Malfoy, you have just told me that you didn’t have any friends: it’s time we changed that,” he held out his hand with a wide smile, “I’m Harry Potter.”
“Odd letters here and there, but she’s studying for her exams so she’s not got a lot of time. You know what she’s like, spending all her time in the new library. Hoping we will see her for Christmas though. You’re invited too of course,” Ron added, “Mum’s adamant that the show will go on for the holidays.”
Harry smiled, the company of his best friend was long overdue and always deeply grounding, helping himself to food was always expected of Ron, and Harry always picked up extra when he knew the red head would be coming by. “How’s the family?”
In the wake of Draco’s departure, Harry had to admit he was a little disappointed that their conversation, no matter how disconcerting and one-sided it had been, was over so quickly.
Harry went about pouring their usual tea, thinking over what Draco had said. “Well, perhaps she will. But you need to be honest with her, otherwise she won’t get the chance to come around. If you keep telling her you’re going to marry a pure blood girl and shunning half-bloods and muggle-borns, she won’t see the benefit of the change.”
Deciding that it might be a good idea to share a few of these thoughts, he headed down the stairs, intent on a visit to Grimmauld Place, but stopped halfway along the corridor as he heard a quiet humming from within one of the rooms ahead.
A flicker of something crossed Narcissa’s face, but it was gone before Draco could identify it. “Very well, will you be wanting a meal when you return?”
Harry shook his head. “I offered him, of course, but his mum was so cut up about Fred, I don’t think he had the heart to leave her yet.”
,” Harry took a deep breath, letting it out slowly, not really sure how to word the tangled mess inside his mind, the faces of the many he had known, and loved, and lost, all swirling in a fire of guilt, regret, and self-loathing.
He let his eyes fall closed, envisioning the exposed flesh of Draco’s clavicle, where the oversized shirt he had worn to bed had slipped down in a ridiculously sensual fashion, partially leaned over the bed, concerned eyes fixed on Harry’s own in the soft glow of the wand light.
Harry nodded silently. It was already hard enough to lose someone you loved, he couldn’t begin to imagine how much worse that feeling must be if that person was your twin, or worse still, your child. He shook away the thought, he still hadn’t quite reconciled Fred’s loss himself. “Any news from Hermione?”
Draco raised an eyebrow, staring at Harry’s outstretched hand in confusion, but opting to play along all the same, grasping it with his own. “I’m Draco Malfoy.”
“You shouted for me, you sounded like…” Draco was about to say, ‘you needed my help’, but the deep red shade Harry’s face had turned, coupled with the familiar flushing of his skin and the fact that one hand was still hidden under the duvet told Draco, in no uncertain terms, exactly what had happened; leaving behind only one question. “Why did you call out
Harry sighed and settled back down in his seat, finally taking a few sips of his tea, noting the untouched cup on the other side of the table that he had been thanked for. Although, he supposed, the thanks was never truly intended for the beverage.
Draco fell silent, picking mindlessly at the now cold toast on the table in front of him, but failing to actually eat any of it. Harry set the tea down in front of him, opting for the slightly bold move of placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Tell her how you feel. That you want something more. If it all goes sour, there’s more than enough room for you here until it blows over.”
Harry smiled, “Sleepover it is then. In that case, perhaps we’ll treat ourselves to something a bit stronger than tea,” he said, pulling a bottle of fire whisky and two glasses from the cupboard. I’ll even let you come and sit on the couch.
Swallowing the last mouthful of his drink, Harry nodded to himself with a determined energy he hadn’t been able for conjure for a long time. Tomorrow, he decided, he and Draco would speak again. It didn’t make an ounce of sense, but something about the evenings events had him fired up. But it wasn’t out of anger or suspicion as it once had been.
He found an easy rhythm, squeezing the shaft as hard as he dared, panting frantically as he felt the flush creeping up his neck, lost entirely in the sensation with his mind, shamefully, trained on memory of Draco leaned against the wall, seeing him naked, looking down at his cock…
Draco looked furious, his fists clenching tighter. “Fine,” he hissed, marching past Harry and directly to the kitchen, withdrawing his wand from the inside pocket of his blazer and whipping the kettle into action on the stove.
Harry’s orgasm hit hard and fast with Draco’s name on lips and he rode out the aftershock. Panting, his head dropped back onto the pillow, a little regret forming as he wished he at least removed the duvet to lessen the clean-up.
“No, he isn’t! For Christ sake Ron, have you ever thought, just for one second, that perhaps Draco just wasn’t as lucky in his friends as we were? That he spent eleven years having a single mindset drilled into him and when he arrived at Hogwarts being immediately aligned with people who shared that inherited nonsense? Did you ever consider, just for a second, how different he might have turned out if someone had just taught him otherwise?”
Though it would have been easy to fall back into old habits, something about the whole situation didn’t sit quite right and Harry couldn’t summon the will to argue. “Then we should sit down and talk, like proper adults,” he reasoned.
His pace unconsciously quickened and his mind started to flood with possibilities. Perhaps something was wrong, and Ron urgently needed his help. By the time he reached the end of the hall his thoughts had worked him into such a panic that throwing the door open caused it to smash against the wall. Harry jumped at the sound, and it took him a few seconds to refocus and realise who was staring back at him. “Malfoy?”
Draco froze immediately. He had gotten so used to saying whatever he wanted at the kitchen table that he had allowed that part of himself to leak out. “Sorry, mother. That was rude of me.”
“What, like a girlfriend?” Ron asked, shock evident in his tone. Harry was quickly off the table again, waving his arms around as he realised the mistake in his wording.
Draco chuckled at Harry’s discomfort, tapping his wand against the plate in front of him and watched as light tendrils of steam began to rise from the toast once again. Harry grinned. “You really must teach me how to do that some time.”
Unfortunately for Draco, just as these slithers of thought started to crack the surface, they morphed into something more. Sitting next to Harry, tucked under the lemon and green duvet, shoulder to shoulder. In his mind he could feel the heat of it against his arm, his ribs, his hip… and then the heat rose somewhere entirely different and Draco realised to his horror, that not only had they been sitting there in full silence while his strange fantasy had played out, but Harry was now watching his face with curiosity and he was entirely unable to walk out of the room without Harry noticing what had happened.
The Manor felt different with his father gone though, less oppressive somehow. Not that his father was ever overtly cruel to him, but there was a standard that needed to be met and often times it was a burden to Draco that he didn’t feel he quite lived up to expectations.
Draco’s quickly relayed the conversation and Harry sat quietly, taking it in and trying to adopt Narcissa’s way of thinking. It was no secret that the woman, though high and mighty, lived for her only son, a love like that would be hard to topple.
Rising slowly from his seat at the kitchen table, Harry began to wonder who would be calling at such an hour. It was almost half past eleven in the evening, a most unlikely hour for visitors to arrive unannounced. Of course, it wasn’t unusual for Ron to visit in the evenings, but it was always arranged beforehand and rarely so late.
Harry pointed to a small wardrobe in the corner on the room. “There’s a few shirts and things in there if you want something to sleep in, and the bathroom is just down the hall.”
Putting his glasses on, Harry got a better look at the clock next to the bedroom door. “It’s 5am, don’t you want to get more sleep?”
Harry smiled widely. “Well, it’s not exactly Malfoy Manor, but it’s a long way from living in a cardboard box. Does it really still surprise you that I find you tolerable?” Harry joked, giving Draco’s shoulder a squeeze before releasing it.
The war with Voldemort had made victims of them all, and Harry and Draco were not on opposing sides. Not anymore.
His mother, though descended from the Black family bloodline, was a little more lenient with her only son, but there was a line that was not to be crossed. She would mention on occasion that she married for love, with the very good fortune to be in love with someone from an upstanding family. Of course, what she meant, was that he should marry for love – just so long as that love was appropriate to his name. A name that he had come to treasure and despise in equal measure.
“Do we have a winner?” Harry asked gently as Draco wandered inside, long fingers dragging along the plump duvet before he sat at the foot of it and smiled, nodding.
The truth of the matter, though we wouldn’t admit it allowed, was that Draco rather liked sitting just exactly where he was; a thought deep in his subconscious that fought to make itself consciously known, was that he would have enjoyed his position a great deal more had he been sitting at the other end of the bed. Just to be warmer of course.
Harry nodded and a warmth flooded him, Draco had just perfectly articulated the exact thing he had been trying to explain to Ron for weeks. “I should be happy that it’s all over. Focus on all the positives,” he shifted in his chair, staring into his mug. “I was supposed to live here with Sirius, when it was all over. I was supposed to finally have a family.”
“I’ve had a lot of time on my hands since I moved in,” Harry said quietly, absently scratching at the back of his neck.
Harry settled back against the headboard, dropping his wand back on the bedside table and pulling up the covers, suddenly feeling a little too exposed. It felt a bit too revealing having Draco in his bedroom while he shook away his nightmares, despite the fact he could not recall having had any. He noticed Draco rubbing at one of his exposed arms, obviously cold, and briefly wondered if it would be inappropriate to offer him a share of the duvet.
The bedroom door burst open and Harry sat bolt upright in shock as Draco re-enter the room. “What happened?” Draco asked quickly, his eyes sweeping over Harry’s flushed skin, forcing himself to look away from Harry’s slightly exposed chest.
“I’m starving, I’m just going to grab some toast if that’s alright?” Ron said, though even as he said it he was dropping bread into the toaster: staring into the contraption with a deep curiosity for how the muggle object worked, though he had used it several times before.
Harry watched silently as his owl Petra took flight against the pale sky, barely touched by the rising sun. There was no going back now. He only hoped that Draco would take him up on his offer.
Draco pushed the plate back across the table to Harry. “Perhaps next time. For now, I need to get a move on, I have a dinner to attend,” he said with a smile, drinking the slightly too hot tea with a new determination. No matter what happened tonight, one thing was certain: he wouldn’t be all alone in the word. At least one person, would still care.
Draco gave a mock scowl before heading out into the hall and making his way up the stairs, remembering how once he had sat at the top of them alone, the only child in a house full of stoic adults that firmly believed children should be neither seen nor heard.
Draco nodded. “I get it, you know. So much happened, we were hardly going to all join hands and skip off into the sunset just because he was defeated.”
Draco laughed, “Well if I find you naked in the halls again then I will have to very seriously consider the true nature of this relationship, Potter,” he jested.
Draco said nothing to his, so Harry decided he may as well continue in his thesis. “And before that, in the Astronomy tower, you lowered your wand, you had no intention of killing Dumbledore.”
Slowly but surely, the parchment was unfolding in Harry’s mind: Draco was just as lonely as he was, and had been for a damn sight longer than he had ever stopped to realise.
Ron frowned, leaning back against the counter and talking through a large mouthful of buttered toast. “You think? You’re not planning to spend Christmas day on your own, are you?”
It wasn’t entirely a shock to him, it wasn’t the first time he had found another man sexually attractive, and it wasn’t the first time his mind had wandered to Draco as a source of pleasure, but the assumption had been that it was a phase, something he would get over once he had recovered a little more. Perhaps that would still be the case, but right now, all he knew, was that the faded scent of Draco’s cologne hung in the air and it was utterly intoxicating.
With a sigh Harry perched himself on the edge of the kitchen table, arms folded across his chest. “I’ve been seeing someone.”
At first Draco did not respond, his face devoid of any emotion. Harry almost missed the scowl Draco wore at school, that at least would have been a familiar sight that he could understand. “Can I help you?”
Harry was a little taken aback by the question and he thought carefully, taking in Draco fully. He looked just the same as the last time they had met, but still something about him was intrinsically different. His hands were balled tight at his side and he still refused to make eye contact. “Why don’t you come in? I’ll make some tea and we can talk.”
“That’s not exactly the point here Harry! That guy spent seven years trying to get you killed and now the two of you are being all chummy. How the hell did that happen?”
Draco relented, tucking his still folded legs under the end of the duvet. “Fine, happy now? So, come on then, what’s the deal with the screaming?” he urged. Perhaps it was none of his business, but surely the whole point of this… whatever this was – was to get some sense of peace from talking it out.
He pulled the covers up over his head, trying to guide his mind to any thought that might give him the will to live, or at least the peace to sleep. But it was no good, no matter how hard he tried his mind kept sliding to the night before last, sat at the kitchen table, studying the sharp lines of Draco’s face, the light shimmering off his blond hair, the soft voice that had bid him farewell…
A flicker of confusion passed over Draco’s features before he realised that Harry was, at last, answering his question. “That’s what I don’t get,” Draco muttered, casting his eyes down to survey the surface of the tea. Still too hot to drink, he softly blew the surface, a little unsure of how to articulate what he was thinking without appearing weak.
A couple of hours later, Harry noticed Draco’s stifling a yawn from his spot at the other end of the sofa. They had been watching a show featuring magicians, leaving Draco a little confused at how muggles could learn to fake magic. “If you’re tired, you can go to bed you know, you don’t have to stay up just because I do.”
The admission came as more of a whisper and Draco’s eyes dropped from the table to his lap, a pink hue creeping up his neck and across his cheeks as he spoke. “I was… jealous.”
“Lucius Malfoy is, and always was, a Death Eater. Not one of us here can say that we haven’t done a thing that we regret to protect someone that we love. As a pure blood wizard myself, I understand the pressures that can be put on a name, and a poor education leads directly to a bad outcome when tested. So in defence of Mr Malfoy I will say: he placed the safety of his family above all. However, the choices he made in achieving those ends should have been outweighed by simple morality, and they were not.”
As he closed his eyes and sleep tugging at his consciousness, a final thought filtered through his brain. ‘I shall endeavour to keep my pants on for you then’ Harry had said, and for the smallest of moments Draco wondered if, just perhaps, that wasn’t what he wanted, before he gave way to a deep and dreamless sleep.
Draco settled at the table again, finishing his tea and settling the cup gently down again. “Who’d have thought we would end up like this?”
He fought hard to keep the movement of his hand slow, savouring each and every second of the fantasy his mind continued to vividly conjure; Draco’s hands came to rest on the edge of the bed, his knees pressing onto the duvet each in turn as he moved to lean over Harry’s face, their lips only millimetres apart, the heat of his breath adding to the flush on Harry face as his pace began to quicken, imagining one of those long legs moving to straddle Harry’s lap.
Harry laughed, and pulled himself up off the sofa. “Right this way good sir,” he said, with an over exaggerated bow, indicating the way out to the staircase.
Before Harry could finish sorting through the pro’s and con’s of his thought, Draco had taken one of the pillows from beside him and settled himself at the opposite end of the bed with the pillow atop his crossed legs to shield them from the chill in the room. “Do you want to talk about it?”
To some degree, this was probably true, but it meant little to the people who continued to deny Voldemort’s wishes, most of whom lost a great deal of people they loved along the way. Arthur Weasley had been among the people who testified against Lucius, and Draco had been surprised to hear what he had to say in all honesty.
Harry passed him at the top, indicating the hall full of doors. “I dare say you know the place better than I do. Any particular one you’d like?”
Draco stood suddenly and Harry prepared himself for the onslaught of bitter, angry comments that were typical of Draco, but the air hung heavy in the room for a few moments before Draco spoke, his voice softer than Harry had ever heard it. “Thanks for the tea.”
Draco smirked. “Defensive magic was always your forte, Potter, my skills were far better suited to charms: a skill that you seem to woefully lack in.”
Harry had assumed Draco would laugh, but he was quiet, fidgeting with the handle on his empty cup. Harry watched him for a few more seconds before speaking again. “If you’ve got something you want to say Draco, just say it. We’re not kids anymore.”
“It wasn’t rude, Draco,” Narcissa said kindly, though her eyes analysed her son more thoroughly as she spoke. “Every mother struggles with the thought that their children no longer need them, and longs for a time when they were able to chase away their child’s fears and nurture their dreams.”
Harry stepped forward, grabbing Ron’s shoulders with both hands. “It doesn’t have to be just me you know. You could give him a chance and find out for yourself.”
“Well let’s find out,” Harry said, standing and walking around the table, indicating with his hands for Draco to get up too. “Hmm, let’s see. A sharply dressed, well educated wizard, whom it is my understanding is a dab hand at charms. Slytherin house, meaning he’s ambitious. Makes a great cup of tea,” Draco’s face twitched into a smile and he rolled his eyes, “and, just as I suspected, has a smile hidden under all those sarcastic remarks that could break hearts.”
“I lived with muggles for ten years, some habits are hard to break,” Harry responded with a shrug. “Sugar?”
Harry was briefly unnerved by the fact that anyone skilled in charms could have walked into his house at any time. Draco waved a hand in dismissal. “I added a few things, no one else is going to catch you with your pants down,” he smiled a little at his own cheeky remark and Harry blushed.
Harry smiled a little. “Well, what will she do if she is? It’s not as if she’s going to ground you.”
Harry took a deep breath, having carefully thought over his words in the time he had bought himself. “I don’t really know what you want me to say. I couldn’t very well let you die.”
Harry dropped onto the end of his bed. There was a fairly simple solution, if he was quick about it. He palmed at the front of his jeans before unzipping and sliding them down his hips a little, wrapping a hand firmly around his cock, hissing lightly at the feeling he had denied himself all morning.
Embarrassment struck Harry as he realised that the cups he had laid out the night before must have still been sitting there when Draco entered the kitchen. “Wait, how did you get in?” Harry asked, his mind finally clear enough to realise that Draco had just walked into his house without his knowledge.
Harry flushed with embarrassment. “I’m so sorry I woke you up, I didn’t even realise I was still doing that.”
Harry cringed. “That was an accident, and you know it! I had no idea what that spell was going to do when I cast it!”
At this point, Arthur had cast a glance at Draco across the court, his eyes full of sadness. Though Draco had never seen the Weasley family as anything more than blood traitors, he realised what Arthur was trying to convey with that look some days later after careful thought; Lucius had to be punished for his crimes, but Arthur was burdened heavily by the fact that it would mean tearing a family apart when so much had already been lost on all sides.
Draco sat quietly at the foot of his bed, slowly mulling over the events of the past few weeks. He had visited Harry almost every day since that first night. Odd to think that after being overwhelmed by his anger and self-hatred that it had led to something that could loosely be called a friendship.
By the time the panic had ebbed, Harry’s fingers and toes were wrinkled, the shower pressure was fast decreasing, and he could no longer feel the cold. Briefly he wondered if a prolonged cold shower could cause hypothermia. But the thought was short lived as he walked out into the hall in search of a towel.
“No! No, I didn’t mean like that. I meant that I’ve had someone coming over to see me is all. It’s been sort of therapeutic,” he finished, knowing exactly what Ron would say before he said it.
“Woah, woah, woah! It’s me!” came a voice from somewhere in the gloom of the room and Harry illuminated the tip of his wand. Draco stood at the edge of the bed; hands slightly raised in surrender. “I heard you cry out, I thought you might be in trouble, I didn’t mean to scare you,” Draco continued, slowly lowering his hands.
Harry took a large gulp of the cooled tea. “It was, um… I guess, it was just good to see you before and I… well I guess I was a little worried I’d upset you.”
Draco leaned up against the kitchen counter, staring ahead at the wall. “There must have been others that would have lived with you,” he mused. “I guess I just find it a bit strange that you live on your own when you had so many people buzzing around you at school.”
“Well,” Whithal said, addressing the Wizengamot. “Mr. Malfoy has… bullied you. Verbally abused you. Physically abused you. Stole your belongings. Taunt you with your parents’s situation. Taunt you with your living arrangements, with your grandmother. Laughed at you. Made fun of you. Made the entire Slytherin House make fun of you. And yet you call him your friend.”
While Draco was petting Potter, he curled closer to Draco and nuzzled his nose against Draco’s collarbone. Draco froze.
Swinging her arms in a hopeless gesture of trying to keep some decorum for the family, Molly stormed off. Fleur and Percy, who had been overseeing Luna’s children in the sea, called Draco in to join the water fun, but he refused. Only once he had had his fill of tea and biscuits – home made by Percy’s oldest daughter Molly – he dared coming near the sea.
“Draco, where’s Cass? Last time, our conversation was broken off, and she had such interesting things to say. Ah, there she is!”
“He is?” Potter’s voice sounded thinly. Pansy fish-mouthed as she was trying to find the right words.
Draco smirked. “Those gashes run close to your mouth. There’s tincture on it. If you eat now, you may ingest some of the tincture. We wouldn’t want to put you in danger, now would we?”
Draco scrambled up, as graceful as he could while still glaring at Potter. Cassie laughed heartily. “Oh Harry, I like your robes! Where did you get them from?” she asked sincerely.
“Possibly. But wouldn’t that create tensions, with the war and stuff?” Rose frowned. Scorpius shook his head.
Draco stood at the bar with a class of champagne in his hand. He was having quite a pleasant conversation with some of his colleagues, when a disgustingly well-known mob of black hair joined the group. He made eye contact with Draco and smiled tentatively. Draco’s gaze stayed icy and dismissing.
Right then and there, Potter decided that he would keep the promise he made to Pansy and Blaise the night before. He had chosen to be friends with Draco, and he would never make Draco doubt such a thing.
Potter nestled himself in one of the black chairs next to the desk, fiddling with his present. “So what is it?”
“Princess Potter? You can’t match a last name with ‘princess’, Malfoy. Besides, ‘Potter’ is hardly a royal name.”
“And why exactly are walks on the beach romantic? Isn’t it annoying, the sand in your shoes and the freezing wind blowing your hair out of style?”
Harry laughed, taking the box and opening it. Draco took the ring, a simple rough gold band with tiny green gems in it, and slipped it on.
With this chapter, I hit the 50,000 mark AND the 100 pages mark (that usually goes together, but I don't care). WHOOHOO. Are you proud of me? Please tell me you are proud of me. I am proud of me. I never thought this story would be so long, and we're not even halfway.
Lily grinned, pecked Draco on the cheek and left again, leaving Draco to fiddle with the bedsheets. “All right. Okay,” he started, only to be interrupted by Blaise.
He had never had to decorate his house, because they had always celebrated Christmas and New Year’s either at the Manor, or in France.
“Professor Malfoy, you are forgetting that this is a highly complicated potion, not accidentally brewed. Only skilled witches and wizards can do such a thing. Besides, why would anyone brew an Animagus potion without intending to become an Animagus, and why would that person use the mandrake’s leaf in their mouth? Coincidentally during a full moon, nonetheless!”
Which led to Draco brewing the potion on his own, but he didn’t mind. It was only a test-run potion, with easy ingredients and boring processes.
Lily nodded seriously, glancing at Draco again, who was talking to Manila, the Gryffindor girl Albus was rumoured to have a crush on. At least, the rumour was only known to James, Potter and Draco, and probably Scorpius as well.
“It used to frighten me, when I was younger. The house seemed so dead to me. When I was just five or six, I wanted to hear noises when I went to bed, but I couldn’t even hear my parents talking downstairs,” Draco mused. He chose his words carefully, not wanting to actually show any weaknesses to his school rival, but also not wanting to get back to their cold conversations of the past month. “And now, there’s always a child yelling, or crying, or laughing. So since I have them, I hunker for some peace and quiet around me.”
As he tried explaining the workings of some simple potion to a first-year class, he couldn’t help but get distracted. He coughed to gain time and gather his thoughts so he could continue.
“We do need a lot of help now to get them together. We should arrange our first meeting,” Scorpius mused, meaning the Weasley, Potter and Malfoy children and Neville, Pansy and Blaise. They would have to make a solid plan of approach for this task.
“Yeh an’ Harry are gettin’ close, aren’ yeh? ‘ve noticed. Harry came to ask me for Witherwings, so you could fly with ‘im. Good, good.”
“Ah yes. I’ve had some bad experiences with straight Firewhiskey,” Potter admitted sheepishly. “I usually chug them down without realising the amount of alcohol in it.”
“I know, Pans, I’m not an idiot,” Draco grumbled. “But I also know that she wouldn’t hire someone to attack me. I’m sure it isn’t her.”
“If Ron can forgive you, if George forgives you, the rest don’t really have the right not to. Besides, the Weasleys are a very loving family. They will accept you if they notice you are trying to make it right.”
“In that case…” Potter plopped down on the couch, with his head in Draco’s lap and his legs stretched out over Ron and Hermione.
“You told her about the Marauder’s Map, and you told her that it was made by your father and godfather, and she was curious, so you told her everything you know about those four friends. You stressed their reputation as prankers, and as immensely intelligent people, and you told her that they were already Animagi in their third year, to prove your point of how smart they were. Then, you said that the Weasley twins gave the Map to you, and that they had found out how to use it. She stored all this information for later use. She also realised that it must be with your personal belongings, as you shouldn’t let this Map lying around somewhere, and as it was your father’s creation. One day, she hides in your apartment until you’ve either gone to mine, or until you’ve gone to bed. She then finds the backpack, fishes out the Map, and starts studying it. The most important things, she makes sure she remembers, like a secret route to Hogsmeade, and some good hiding places in the dungeons. And then, she replaces it, sneaks out of your room, and starts looking for the entrance to this secret route, after which she will never forget it, and she won’t need your Map anymore.”
won’t know. Since we’re only going to someone’s home, and not somewhere public. Second, I wouldn’t have thought you wanted to go to the Burrow.”
A snicker goes through the crowd, and Draco feels himself grow cold. ‘Happy? I can only be happy when Potter is around? This is nonsense. I can be perfectly happy without that brainless prat.’
The reason for that was easily explained. The day before, Pansy had Floo-called while he was relaxing and letting time fly past with a calming white wine in his hand. She, knowing him better than most others, had suspiciously narrowed her eyes at the glass of wine.
“We have two options, and we’re not yet sure what to do. We could either set our eyes on Aquila,” Zarnel continued casually, “since she isn’t as protected as the others are. She doesn’t sleep in Slytherin dorms, so she can be easily gotten to. We can hurt her, break her, make her our victim. You know as well as I do that Scorpius won’t survive that. Or, we could change tactics and turn to Jackie.”
“I don’t think she does,” Potter answered, nodding towards Minerva, who was watching the students amusedly and did nothing to hide the small smile around her lips.
Pansy nodded. “That’s true. Every first Tuesday of the month, I receive a letter from her. Not always just as long or as interesting, but always asking about my hobbies and my friends. She is the sweetest girl.”
“I know you regret it. And your mother has really been helpful. I won’t forgive you just yet, but Harry has told me you have changed. I don’t hate you anymore, if that means anything to you.”
The next morning, Draco woke up feeling giddy. He poured himself in one of his fancier robes, which made him walk confidently and with flair. Phi commented on his happy mood, but attributed it to the fine weather out.
“That reminds me, I baked another one. It’s in my apartment at Hogwarts, so you’ll have to owl my children for it. Personally, I think the batter was the best I ever made.”
Draco hit him hard on the arm, while George to let out a delighted laugh. “That’s right, I almost forgot. How is that crush? Still under influence of my undeniable charms?”
“The trick is to make Harry state it as obvious and clear as possible. No question, no hesitant smiles, no loophole through which papa can escape,” were the instructions. “Harry needs to demand an answer, by getting either angry or sad. Rely on the Harry Potter Effect. Try to use as much of papa’s weaknesses as possible. But most of all: do not try to be subtle. They are allowed to know that we have had enough. If they realise we are driving them into a corner, where they cannot get out unless we let them, they will have to make a decision.”
After dinner, Draco sent Amber, his lovely owl, back to his mother. It only consisted of one sentence.
“I must say, I don’t know,” Draco admitted. “I haven’t really had any romantic interests in my life.”
“It is not illegal in the slightest. The project would consist of brewing potions and noting the results. No paperwork, no theoretical research. Just brewing. As for what you’d get in return…” Draco smiled absently. “Something you’ve always wanted. I would give you an apprentice-ship.”
This made Draco chuckle a bit, and he didn’t even bite back the words the Veritaserum forced him to say.
And if he would be getting closer with Potter, he would be digging his own grave. No one would think that Draco would actually be befriending Potter, because he likes Potter. Everyone would think that Draco would do it for the benefit of the Malfoy name. Or worse, they’d think he would be trying to poison Potter, or kill him in any other way. Perhaps even extract information to use against the Ministry.
Potter tore the bag fully open and grabbed Draco in a tight hold, letting the entirety of the flour fall on top of Draco’s head.
“You look like you could use some ice cream,” Potter frowned when he and Draco exited the Great Hall after dinner. Upon hearing Aquila’s snort, who had overheard, he winked at her.
“That sounds like a courtship ritual, doesn’t it?” Pansy interjected, catching on to their conversation.
“Good morn-“ he started, but was cut off by the two missing boys skipping into the classroom with linked arms. A loud ‘Good morning, Professor Malfoy,’ joined their entrance and they laughed boisterously when they noticed they were the last ones to arrive.
Accompanied by Ron’s laugh, they left for one of the spare bedrooms, leaving Draco alone with a half-asleep Potter, whose only sign of life were the occasional cat-like purrs when Draco carded through Potter’s hair.
His mother looked at him. “Draco…” she started softly. “We need to talk.” Draco dreaded the talk. He would have to throw everything away. He would be punished by his father. Perhaps he would be kicked out. He messed up.
It slowly clicked. There was only one woman who thought she had the right to waltz into Hogwarts to speak to Draco. He sighed softly.
“Yes, but he knows exactly how much he can take without getting addicted. He has a schedule with when he take a potion. There two days each week that he can’t take one, and on those days he trudges through the day on willpower alone, and he is subjected to nightmares.”
am the one making objections to your presence. For your sake, as well as theirs. They won’t be able to see you as the man you are,
“I want a guy who’s strong enough to deal with the hate against me and my family. Someone who would protect my children with his life, even if they’re not his own flesh and blood. But he also should be able to get along with my parents. I know they might not be worth anything in the public eye, but they’re still my parents. I want him to be at least civil with them, if not friendly. Oh, and I almost forgot: all is well if he can get along with my parents, but please don’t let him be a weak cloth around them. My father especially, that hypothetical guy should be able to fight my father on important matters. And he should be able to fight me on important matters.”
Scorpius looked pained. “I wasn’t supposed to. See, even before Terence and Priscus, there were students who bullied Slytherins. They were trying to bring Slytherin down, to get points docked and the like. Ever since this was known to Slytherins, we refused to give them the satisfaction. So whenever you are admitted to the Hospital Wing, you try to get away as soon as possible. Everyone helps each other get to every class and help with learning. In some cases, all the homework was done by others, because the attacked Slytherin has to sleep or rest. We don’t want to fulfil their expectations by telling a professor, so we just had to pretend like nothing happened. Upper years cast spells to hide bruises or to kill pain. It isn’t a matter of being bullied anymore. It’s a violation of our pride. It’s a challenge we don’t want to back out from.”
He sat down, smiling at Potter until Scorpius cleared his throat in an obnoxious attempt to get the attention.
As he went downstairs, he was hit by a frightening realisation that maybe his little girl was maturing. That maybe she wasn’t worried, because she now learnt to see the bigger picture. Maybe she was growing wiser than her old man.
“I already get tired if I stand up for a while, so no. I just don’t want us to make a big deal out of it as long as nothing is wrong.”
“On some work tables, I see enormous blocks of the ingredients being cut. On other tables, the pieces are tiny and barely visible for the naked eye. You must know that instructions aren’t unnecessary page-filling. They are there for a reason. If the pieces are too big, the juice can’t come out correctly and it won’t mix well with the rest of your potions. If you cut them too small, there will be far too much juice and your cauldron will explode. The juice of most ingredients is the carrier of magical codes. The way and amount this juice is released, will directly affect the working of the potion. Thus, if the instructions say ‘cut pieces of two centimetres’, do exactly that. Don’t think they’re useless.”
Draco slumped back in his chair, gesturing hopelessly. “I am not going to take Alistair in. Where did you get him?”
A slight straightening of the woman’s spine told him that he had said the right thing. “Will you really? Of course, it would be a bit counterproductive to let both of them go immediately, so I can offer you another deal. This is the last option you have, sweetheart. Consider it carefully. How about… I let the Potter-girl go, and you tell me everything.”
Later in the evening, when Aquila and Cassie had said their goodnights and Phi was fast asleep in the bedroom, Potter and Draco were lounging on the sofa, with Draco leaning his back against Potter’s chest.
“Your office is lovely,” Draco remarked kindly at Ms. Euripideia’s questioning gaze. “I am looking for ideas to reorganise my home office. I hope you don’t mind that I take inspiration from your work.”
Without pause, he swished his wand and music of Let it go filled the room. Draco danced with many dramatic movements, but at a certain point, it seemed like the lyrics hit him deeper than he showed.
“Everyone keeps saying that, but I don’t know what it means!” Draco snapped. He immediately screwed his eyes shut, apologising softly.
He was also trying to find out what a Muggle Christmas entailed, and he wasn’t succeeding. He needed a Christmas tree –but what made up a Christmas tree? He needed to bake cookies for Santa Claus –but who was Santa Claus and why would he visit them? Also, when could Draco expect him to arrive, and did that man only eat cookies, or would he want a full dinner? Draco was also supposed to fill his children’s socks –but should it be every single pair, or only their Christmas socks?
Potter seemed floored for a second. “Apparently, she really wanted to be away from your papa. I can’t blame her. He’s still wearing the Dark Mark,” he sneered then.
His son didn’t answer, only averted his eyes and clenched his fists. A light snarl rumbled in his chest, making Draco understand what was going on. He took a few measured steps backward and breathed deeply to prepare himself.
Potter had also spoken in favour of his mother, and if possible, that meant more to Draco. His father was sent to Azkaban without a further thought, but his mother got a gentler treatment. She had to see Azkaban from the inside for only a few years, before she would be free again. And Draco would stay free. He wouldn’t have to go to Azkaban. All thanks to Potter.
Harry Potter himself divorced from school-romance Ginny Weasley after having three children together, and at the same time, came out as being gay. Draco Malfoy never announced any such thing.
“In a bit. But your final exams are coming up, and you need to focus on that. Malfoy would be disappointed if you failed your exams.”
“Here you go,” he said while pulling the beanie over Phi’s eyes. “Make sure it covers your hair. You like it?”
“You’re Muggleborn, aren’t you? Do you know the basics of genetics?” James asked. When the boy nodded, he continued. “The chances are minimal that two people on Earth have the exact same genetics and genetic expression. Only identical twins have that. And magic is part of that genetic package. Some people have dormant magic, some people don’t have it at all, and others have it up and kicking. Just like any other genes.”
right now- and lifted Draco’s chin with two fingers, so that they were looking one another in the eye. Potter couldn’t suppress a grin when Draco’s eyes flicked to his for a second, with barely concealed mirth. George burst out in chuckles.
“It would have been, if you didn’t get such awful nightmares from it,” Draco complained. The grin suddenly fell from Cassie’s face and she broke out in sobs again.
“No, not really. Just a party, just people acting stupid with a reason. I rather liked the parties and feasts Hogwarts entertained.”
“Exactly. Miss Laurentia Fletwock, everybody. My faithful client, and apparently, a high-up in trying to get rid of me. Albie, show me your arm again, will you?”
“But that is just it, isn’t it? He hasn’t paid for them. He was given leeway because you spoke for him. And that is totally unfair. He should be in Azkaban, or get the Kiss or something. But he should definitely not be teaching us, here at Hogwarts.” Arthur got even closer and peered up in Potter’s eyes.
McGonagall frowned at him. “I can definitely say that some catlike characteristics were already manifested in me, even before I know that Animagi existed. I know for certain that one cannot choose their Animagus. You are an animal, you don’t become one. Why?”
“I said they were Dark so you wouldn’t tell anyone that I used them,” Draco deflected. He opened his mouth to say something else, when he saw the expression on Harry’s face.
“She would have been found within two days, and killed for her disloyalty. Probably after some of our friends or family would have been killed, right in front of her eyes. You really don’t understand how it worked, do you? You have no idea!”
“I never said that,” Albus countered. “I actually really like her. I don’t know whether she does all these things because her parents want her to, or because she believes in that anti-Death Eater nonsense as well, but I like her. She’s cool.”
“It feels like you’ve got more right to be with them, because you know you’ll never get other children. Ginny is engaged now, I hear, and chances are that she will be pregnant again. You won’t have the same experience, you should be able to enjoy them completely,” Draco filled in softly. “Is that it?”
Pansy shushed them when the music started playing and Draco appeared, it became clear to the others that Draco had shrugged off all of his awkwardness, and he was deliberately moving as slowly, languidly and undeniably flirtatious as possible. Soon, they started cheering him on as Draco focussed his hooded-eyed attention on Potter and Potter alone.
“Yes, we did. We won the trial, they can’t have anything against you anymore. You said it yourself, you weren’t supposed to win the trial. That was their endgame, but we beat them.”
“Just like you,” Potter mumbled, before covering it up with assuring Draco that she was still showing up at every meal and ate normally.
“I thought that perhaps with stronger plants, those enhancers aren’t necessary anymore. Sleeping Draught is made addictive by the enhancers in it, and if there are no enhancers, it might not be addictive anymore. You see where I’m going?”
Phi, who had been trying to read in one of the corners, put his book down and shook his head. “Scorpius. Brother. Idiot. Papa is the one who put up all those notes.”
As Draco mused to himself, he didn’t notice how Potter’s gaze kept flicking to his lips and nervously snapping back at Draco’s eyes, until Potter very lightly touched his hand and pulled him out of his own head.
Looking around and being pointed which man Scorpius meant, she shrugged. “I think it’s just another prejudiced guy. Not everyone appreciates papa being here.”
The girl continued. “He is my uncle. It’s disturbing to hear you swoon over him, honestly. Just… stop.”
“Mr. Malfoy is right, Bill, no stress or desperation or anger. It will ruin the potion. Balm. Where is the balm? Ah, great, thanks. And the peacock feather? Does that need to be crushed as well, or just added as it is?”
Molly came out of the kitchen, rubbing her hands over her apron. “What is this noise? Oh, Harry, hello love.” When she saw Draco, she took a deep breath, eyeing him judgingly, while everyone else was chatting.
“No, it’s good. You know I like those robes. Nothing wrong with it,” Phi assured him with a hug and a smile. Draco looked at him a few more seconds to try and find out what his son had meant with his question, but he gave up and smiled back.
Harry took the letter from Cassie to read it with his own eyes. “Well that’s good. That’s very very good. Very good. Right. Well. Anyone want a fresh cup of tea?” Immediately, Harky appeared with a pot of tea, pouring everyone some new. The noise and excitement brought Pansy and Blaise downstairs as well, gratefully accepting the tea Harky handed them. They sipped it in silence, until they were interrupted again by a knock on the door.
The conversation turned political, engaging Draco, Aquila and Scorpius in the passionate discussion. Potter, meanwhile, had zoned out and was completely focussed on Draco.
He opened the door for Potter, pointing him in the direction of the kitchen. They put down the groceries, said hello to Harky, who had jumped from the Lodge to the Cornwall estate to clean it quickly, and Draco immediately tugged on Potter’s arm to give him a tour.
“That is where we come in!” Phi exclaimed. “He won’t take initiative, but he will accept our help. When he is ready,” he added with more emphasis. “Right now, however, he won’t. He will think we are meddling in his business and he’ll get angry. We should wait, at least until papa is more comfortable with his own feelings. You know how he gets when other people push him into admitting what he feels. He hates that! Let him take his own time!”
“Most of them, yeah. Fred’s death is always the worst to witness. I didn’t see him die, which only serves my brain to conjure the most awful possibilities, and in every dream, his death gets worse and worse. I know he died in an explosion, and sometimes I see him being blown backwards, hitting his head against a wall and crushing his skull. Other times, he gets consumed by the fire, and I hear his cries of pain.”
And yet… if he just wanted to be friends, why was he so ultimately obsessed with him? Draco knows the meaning behind every movement of his brows, every twitch of his fingers. He almost knows more about bloody Potter than about his own father.
“Pish-posh,” Potter tsk’ed. After a beat of silence, he ran a hand through his hair and stood up. “We better get back to Hogwarts. It’s getting late and we have some hard work coming up, with the N.E.W.T.s.”
“Draco, how do you take your tea? I’ve got a thousand different flavours, and sugar and milk. Take your pick,” George announced, puttering about to make sure his desk was empty of papers.
“Right. There is a family prophecy in here. The first heir of the Malfoy estates is allowed to listen to it when they have found the purpose in their lives. I think I have that now. The prophecy should be available now, if the purpose I found is true. If not, the Divination Ball will stay blank.”
“Just one more spoonful? One spoonful can’t have that much of an influence, can it?” Draco cajoled, moving closer to subtly grab the spoon from Potter’s hands.
“Oh, I woke up because Harry was going downstairs, and he said I wasn’t allowed to go with him. And I wanted to read, but I didn’t want to wake Lills or ‘Quila.”
“Malfoy? Since I already ruined whatever weird sort of connection we have last Monday, can I ask you something that will only make it worse?"
“Oh, that. The children came up with it, and I knew the song. It seems they had been practicing for a week, hoping that I would join them when I got back.”
your children. And Cassie, making such a big mistake. Scorpius was ruined when he heard about Cassie! Can you imagine what might happen if he had to endure one more such blow?”
While everyone’s attention was on the Wizengamot, Scorpius stood up and strolled towards the stand. An Auror stopped him with a hand on his shoulder, but it only took one glare from Scorpius to make the Auror release him.
At the same time, Potter had stood up from his seat at the table, sent a reassuring smile to McGonagall, and strode towards to Gryffindor table. A few glances shared with James and Lily told him which Gryffindor students had been talking to Phi. The boy and girl responsible, Keira and Arthur, were grinning behind their hands, and didn’t see Potter coming.
The hurt on Potter’s face was written so clearly that Draco almost wanted to take it back, or soften the blow he knew he had just delivered, but he refrained.
“I don’t. Love declarations are just that much more sincere when they are in the pouring rain. Or at dawn, when the sun is barely up.”
she was home, we slept very far apart from one another. Physical contact was sparse, especially in our latest years.”
the use of this aspect is reason to think that he or she is not only magically capable, but also has a brilliant mind.”
A few heads snapped up, just as the door slammed open and P-Harry appeared in the doorway. When he noticed the tense silence, he softly closed the door behind him, sitting down with a sheepish look on his face.
So now, here he was in the Potions classroom, about fifty minutes early. He had checked whether the cauldrons were remotely clean they were, luckily. He had even set up an extensive logbook, in which he would keep track of which ingredients were stored, and in which amount. The cupboard was well-stocked, there was enough for Draco to last through the first month of classes.
But Potter had ruined it. Potter had known he had known who he was, in the Manor. Potter had known he couldn’t do it. Draco had the feeling that Potter knew about his failure with Dumbledore. So, in a perfectly Slytherin way, Potter had broken Draco.
The hairdo Cassie had chosen had a network loose braids over his crown, which came together in a tie made of hair, and then spread out in a ribcage-like pattern. He would have to be very careful with his hair, if he managed to do it.
The next gift Draco had provided was for Fleur, a romanticised biography of the most well-known Veela in history. She smiled politely, kissing Draco twice on the cheek. When she opened it to leaf through it and saw it was written in French, her smile became genuine. “Where did you get this book in French?” she asked, accent still strongly audible.
Downstairs, Draco’s Hogwarts generation, meaning the seven Weasleys with their partners, Potter, Pansy, Blaise, Greg and Draco, all sip from their wine and share bites of the New Year’s pudding Molly had made.
Her speech flows past Draco, who is not willing to leave his thoughts alone to listen to some Professor, yet again giving all the credit to a Gryffindor. To bloody Potter.
“What can I do? Repeat the Moonwalk? I’m good at that one, aren’t I? Or I could do the Traffic Control. Should I do that one?”
“It’s all right. I’ll cook for us tonight. And then we’ll go to the beach, as you wished. Although I have never understood why people think the beach is romantic.”
“For what?” Draco tries, he really tries, to snap. But with this newfound information about himself, and with all that has happened today, he can’t do it. He must have lost his first language, called sarcasm, when he killed Voldemort.
Aquila gasped loudly, pressing her hand against her mouth and staring at Harry with wide eyes. “Please, no. Don’t tell me he’s dead. No. No no no. No, please, Dad, no.”
And now, Scorpius was confronted with that same horrible image of Phi. After a while of staring at it, he was able to pull himself together and straighten his back. He pointed his wand at the Boggart and closed his eyes before he cast the spell.
Breakfast was over and Draco had only just locked the door behind him, when there was a knock on the door. Potter was standing there, with a bright smile and wearing comfy clothes.
. Cra– Vincent had turned into the emotionless robot Tom Riddle wanted all his Death Eaters to be. That’s the worst of it.
Ophiuchus pretended to think, but Draco knew he had his answer ready. “Well, I like Gryffindor, because I would sacrifice myself if it’s the right thing to do,” he recited what Draco has always told him. “Or perhaps Ravenclaw, because I’m curious and critical. Slytherin would be cool, too, with Scorp and Cass. But I also really like Hufflepuff and I appreciate honesty. So I don’t know yet.”
Malfoy, whose eyes were still sharp with fury, sniggered loudly. “Look, Pansy, I think we touched a nerve. What’s the matter, Potter, were you expecting someone else on your stoop? Lost pet, perhaps? Pity he wasn’t wearing a collar.”
The wind was whistling by Harry’s ears, and the bike was emitting a low roar, thrumming beneath him; it was so much more
“So much for your great Slytherin win,” Harry hissed, shaking Malfoy off as he leveled out his broom. “I told you that you could never beat me—"
He let her win, but only so he could pelt Ron with snowballs while he was distracted; afterwards he and Ron teamed up against Ginny until Dean came to her rescue and pummeled them both with snow. While Harry and Ron were still shaking it out of their collars, Dean swept Ginny up in his arms and swung her around, giggling.
"Well, I'm sorry we can't all live up to perfect James and Lily Potter," Draco shot back. "Besides, she's only using him for his money. It’s good to show the Ministry that she’s moving on from my father, so she won’t be associated with his arrest. But,” and his eyes were sharp with fury, “she hasn’t forgotten him. My father is still alive. If she forgets, I’ll—I’ll kill her!”
“Ginny!” Tonks said, pulling open the door. “Glad you all came. Come in. Do you mind waiting in here for a few minutes? We’re just finishing up.”
now, is it – you do fancy him!'  He has an expression on his face like someone just forced him to swallow a whole bottle of Stinksap.  'I take it back, Hermione, you can write to Krum, you can even write to that troll McLaggen, or, or Lockhart even, just don't go all sweet on Malfoy—'
'Well, we should be learning more wandless magic, and two-part defensive spells, and Patronuses for those who can't yet. I heard there's a whole section on our N.E.W.T.s about healing charms!'
Draco was lying on his stomach, carefully writing what appeared to be a very long letter, and he looked up with alarm when he heard the snick of the door. At the sight of Harry, he raised an eyebrow. “Potter,” he said.
He felt a hand squeeze his shoulder, and then Mr. Weasley said gently, “Go on, Harry, go upstairs and get your things. I’ll take care of this.”
—' and Harry backed off at once, rubbing at his mouth with the back of his hand as Malfoy's cock twitched and he came all over his belly, some of it spurting on his shirttails. He stood there for a minute, eyes shut, knees trembling, as Harry got to his feet.
Dumbledore was, indeed, in the room when they entered, talking in low tones with Moody. While Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled as he looked up at Harry, Moody glanced suspiciously towards the corner, where Draco sat. He was slumped in his chair and did not appear to be willing to look at anyone.
'Yeah, I recognize it.  But what do we do with it?'  Harry dangles the locket between his fingers.  'When Dumbledore destroyed the ring, he ended up with his one hand all blackened—you all saw it—'
'You want one for the Order?'  Fred looks thoughtful.  'I'd have to talk to George, but I suppose we could take it apart, take a look.'
“We were horrible,” Remus said fondly, “the way Sirius and James strutted about, you’d think they were kings. Once Sirius set Gryffindor Tower on fire, did you know? James saved the day with a few well-placed spells; I always told him that’s why he was made Head Boy. Sirius, though. Not repentant in the least.” He paused, smiling, in thought. “Trying to make fireworks, I think. Something about Peter’s birthday.”
Harry thought, for the briefest of instants, that maybe Remus was staying because he was the spy. Then he shook it off. How dare he accuse Remus,
Malfoy choked. 'I didn't know you were into wearing girls' clothes, Potter. I ought to alert the papers.'
'I don't understand,' Harry said. When he thought of Hogwarts, he could see only the bloodstained rubble, whole staircases cracked down the middle, walls with enormous holes blasted through them. He felt as if someone had done a Freezing Charm on his insides. 'How can it re-open? It'll take years to rebuild, even with magic.'
Harry was sure he was red-faced. Why was there so much talking? In his imagination, it had never been this awkward. “I’m sure,” he said, a little hoarsely.
Ron waved a hand and nearly knocked over a slumbering Blackthorn Bush. 'Either way, I get enough of Malfoy in classes, I don't want to be talking about him every four seconds.'
Harry grits his teeth and says nothing.  Eventually, desperately wishing he had Ron back as his roommate, Harry casts a Silencing Spell in the direction of the curtains around Malfoy's bed.  As he falls asleep, he wonders how long it will take Malfoy to realize that no one can hear him complaining and finally shut up.
Harry left school, and so did Malfoy. Harry joined Auror training, and Ron didn’t. He did meet Harry and Hermione for drinks, though, every Friday near the Ministry. Harry never asked exactly how they’d made up, but the world slowly recalibrated, as if the past year had never happened. Some days Ginny even came along, smiling at Harry like she too wanted to put Hogwarts behind them, and one day it felt as routine as breathing for Harry to go home with her to the Burrow, to stay as close as possible to her loud laughter and the firelight glimmering on her hair, instead of his cold, empty flat.
'Don't you dare use the Cruciatus Curse!' Harry yells at his back, but Malfoy has already turned the corner.  He sits back down.  The map is there on the wall, several points circled and starred, and it's still just a blur of unconnected ideas and theories going nowhere.  The blue dots, according to Hermione's system, are the locations of all the deaths reported in the last month, even those explained as car accidents or spells gone awry.  The red stars are potential locations of potential Horcruxes.  The purple circle is Zacharias Smith's house.
Harry stood and walked to the doorway, emboldened by his earlier physical contact with the blond, he placed an arm jovially around his shoulders and used it to guide Draco into the room. “You really do think a lot of yourself, don’t you? It’s going to take a lot more than a former stuck-up-Slytherin to break me and Ron apart,” he joked, letting his arm drop back down to his side. “Anyway, I thought you had a dinner to attend?”
“I said something to my mother that I shouldn’t have. She’s probably angry with me.” Draco said, selecting his own slice of toast and picking off a corner to eat.
“I’m just, uh… noticing… something,” Draco stuttered out, becoming completely flustered. Here Harry was, pouring his heart out about being and orphan and wishing he had been killed as a child and all Draco could think about was how hard he was, all the while his mind screaming at him the perfectly obvious fact that Harry Potter is MALE.
“Yes, I remember,” Draco said quietly before a much larger smile crossed his face, “In fact, the bathroom is a little unforgettable, wouldn’t you agree?”
Harry’s head dropped. “I know that me surviving meant that everyone had peace from it all for 15-odd-years, but yeah. I mean, I don’t begrudge people their happiness, but I mourn my own a bit more than a probably should.”
“I paced around outside the house a bit but couldn’t go in. I left a message with the elf that I’d be home in the morning,” Draco’s cheeks turned a little pink. “That is, if you don’t mind me taking you up on what you said earlier.”
Draco shook his head, dropping into a seat opposite the one Harry had previously been occupying and waiting quietly while Harry stirred each of their drink and set them down on the table.
Draco physically recoiled from his own comment. “I’m sorry, I don’t know what’s gotten into me. I’m going to go. I’ll see you tonight,” he said quickly, turning on his heel and heading for the door before Narcissa could say another word.
Draco’s propped up the wall of the upstairs corridor, one eyebrow raised and the twitch of a smirk on his face. “I was beginning to wonder if you’d drowned in there,” Draco nodded in the general direction of Harry’s crotch. “I imagine if you spill tea on that it would be unpleasant. I’ll wait in the kitchen.”
“The second-before-last scene is of his eldest daughter, Aquila, working hard to understand a complicated part of magical theory. Mr. Malfoy sits down next to her, and when he hears what she doesn’t understand, he begins to explain the exact workings of it in such a passionate way, that Aquila can’t help but become interested. With endless patience and boundless energy, Mr. Malfoy keeps answering every question Aquila asks him, until they are just sitting in the dark, with an almost-burnt candle, talking about everything and nothing at all.
“Because my father thought you were a dark wizard, and he wanted me to befriend you. So that was the first task I got, and the first task I failed to do.”
“Luckily Gryffindors do that too. For honour’s sake. Thank you, both. You really are good friends to him.”
Mr. Malfoy laughed. “Come on.” He pushed James in front of him and walked to the gates to offices and staff areas, moving as if he knew what he was doing and as if he did this all the time. Unsheathing his wand without anyone noticing, he mumbled a charm that James didn’t recognise, and the gates waved open.
will do it. You should know that by now,” Scorpius exclaimed angrily, after which he was overcome by a coughing fit.
“Potter?” Draco found himself asking, surprised and, frankly, intrigued by the hunted look on Potter’s face. “You look terrible. Have you been drinking?”
“I know he likes pumpkin and treacle tart, but I wouldn’t know about his chocolate preferences. I guess dark chocolate or some exotic flavour. Gryffindors.”
Biting his lip, Potter slowly unravelled the ties holding it together. When the present was uncovered, he chuckled. Inside was a pair of woollen mittens, quite clearly hand-knitted. They were Gryffindor red with green accents, the Gryffindor emblem and Potter’s Quidditch number from their time at Hogwarts.
“Quite sure. Besides, I don’t think Harry would appreciate it if I stole you away from him, right now.”
Teddy looked up. “It’s your birthday next week? We’ll have to have a party!” he said to Phi, who had moved and sat on Teddy’s lap.
“I heard from your daughters that you don’t particularly like to be called Malfoy anymore. I’m sorry. Can I call you Draco then?” he said smilingly. Draco returned the smile.
“All right, if you’re not willing to talk, I’ll start.” Draco lifted his hand to his chin and tapped it twice in thought. “Where shall I start? Ah yes. The girl is a Slytherin –“
Potter threw a look over his shoulder, seeing Albus and Scorpius laughing behind their hands. “Come on, we should join them again. Wouldn’t want to lose one of them, would we?”
“Oh how wonderful it is to have you obedient and sweet. Why don’t you drag it out, like you were too cowardly to do with Jackie?”
Some Gryffindors, who have been staring at Potter and him for what feels like an hour now, come in action. The female Weasel, no, Ginny, starts telling other Gryffindors something. It results in a group of students trying to shoo the others inside.
“Papa, it’s snowing! It’s snowing, look!” Cassie exclaimed, pointing at the ceiling and the windows.
“As long as you keep doing what you do, I’m fine,” Draco shrugged with a smile. “But I should take shower.”
“You should go inside Westminster Abbey one day. A few fantastic historical people were buried there. It’s worth the entrance money, if you’re into such things.”
Draco’s eyes widened minimally at his father’s outburst. Lucius understood completely. He rarely cussed.
“We had a talk, after Boxing Day. It turned out that Malfoy needs more time to get used to the idea. He needs to… get his head together, because there is this internal struggle…”
“As you may know, Neville Longbottom works in the greenhouses to do some kind of research. Our project would be a follow-up on that. Do you know what he is doing?”
“However, I do think every student should get the chance to cast a Riddikulus, if only for their self-esteem.”
“I would love to,” he ground out, quickly scowling over his shoulder at his oldest daughter, who only smirked back. Potter smiled brightly, which caused Draco to turn to his children again. He hated the smirks and grins of those devils, but it was better than bickering like an old married couple with Potter.
Suddenly, about four or five thestrals stood behind Draco as if they were protecting him, much like Crabbe and Goyle used to do in their early schoolyears. Another three stalked up to Harry, towering over him with spread wings. Harry thought he saw actual steam coming from their noses. The one on the left was scraping his hoof over the ground in a rather intimidating gesture.
“The pain potion is being injected now, give it some time to settle, Mr. Malfoy. Can you describe what you feel?”
“He is a bit stupid, however. I wouldn’t put it past him to conveniently overlook the similarities between those scents.”
A heavy silence hung between them, Neville wearing a disbelieving expression and Draco a blank one. His Malfoy mask had carefully taken any indication of his thoughts away from Neville.
“According to the media, it’s Scorpius. Some people fear him, because they think he is a second me, and he could kill them with a glare. Luckily, he is able to laugh it off.”
Pansy held up her hand. “Wait, Draco lost track of time?” she laughed loudly. Blaise grinned with wide eyes. “Man, I would’ve liked to see that.”
“Yes, in France,” Draco couldn’t help but answer a bit smugly. “Last year, that was. Mother had had a swimming pool installed in her holiday home. So we were swimming and playing around a bit, when those four devils of mine decided to push me in the water completely. I don’t usually do that, because the chlorite does horrible things to my hair.” Draco flashed a smile. “So then I had t fight all four of them. Phi climbed on my neck, Cassie and Scorp were pulling at my arms, while Aquila went for the strategy of making me lose my balance. My hair stayed dry, but only because I bribed Scorpius to choose my side. He lifted Cassie off and I was able to pull myself up on the side of the pool, with Phi and ‘Quila still clinging to me.”
Potter chuckled. “I don’t know. You seem to like it though, more than a regular bar. Why do you like molten chocolate better than a bar?”
“I was talking to Cassie and said … rather unfriendly things about Malfoy at lunch that day. Merlin. One of those letters must have been meddled with.”
“So that’s why you looked so tired? You didn’t sleep? Not just the Vanishing Cabinet, but also this?” Potter ventured. Draco shook his head, but Pansy answered for him, knowing that Draco wouldn’t utter a word.
Zarnel realised her mistake immediately, but recovered. She seemed genuine this time. “I thought you would want me to tell you how I get my ingredients and who help me. But I’m not going to give you any names.”
“Because they have been harassing and bullying Slytherin students for three years, and they have never been caught!” Draco heard himself sneer. He quickly ruled himself in when he saw McGonagall’s face.
“I had imagined that this would happen with a lot more romance,” Draco mumbled, shaking his head. Then, he leant sideward, wound a hand around Potter’s neck and pressed his lips to Potter’s.
“Well, we’ve got Roxane, the youngest child of George and Angelina. Their oldest is a boy called Fred, but he’s not at school anymore. And there’s Dominique, older sister of Louis. They’ve got one more sister, Victoire, but she’s also done with Hogwarts. And that’s the second generation of Weasleys.”
The stalls were lit-up with red, green and blue lights. Potter led the way over the Christmas market towards the Thames.
“Oui, Ophiuchus, tu as raison. But perhaps you shouldn’t speak in a language not everyone can follow. It is not polite.” Draco chastised softly.
Draco chuckled. “Oh, that. This is Alistair.” He stretched out his hand so the ferret could climb on it, and showed it to Potter and Pansy. Potter started laughing immediately upon seeing it, throwing his head back and letting out loud barks.
“One, two, three, four,” Scorpius counted down. Reaching four, every Slytherin jumped on the benches, threw their arms in the air and started yelling victoriously. Some Slytherins had to stop in order to catch their breaths from laughing so hard, but Scorpius, Albus and Cassie continued for a long time. At a certain point, some Slytherins started chanting some rhythmic thing that Draco vaguely recognised. Only after Cassie chanted along, he picked up enough to realise that they had put the Slytherin verse of the Sorting Hat Song in a chant.
Straightening his back and lifting his head, Draco was surprised at the close presence of Potter. He shouldn’t be surprised really, they had just hugged, after all. Perhaps it wasn’t the proximity that surprised Draco. It probably wasn’t. Chances were that he had merely been surprised by the look in Potter’s eyes.
“Aquila has had it before, on some events where we went with Mother,” Cassie explained. “It’s when her hair is done up, but it hangs down in curls. It’s like the curly manes of an Andalusian horse.”
Draco could only shake his head, immediately followed by a nod. The guard smiled at them, opening a cabin for them, where a bottle of champagne and two glasses were readied for them.
“Draco,” Astoria greeted. Draco smiled at her, not as genuine as he would with his children or Pansy and Blaise, but certainly not cold.
They sat together for the rest of the evening, not really working and not really talking. Both were in their own worlds, thinking of what the ‘endgame’ could be and how they might halt it.
And all of his children had their favourite song, a song they could relate to, a song that meant a lot to them.
want to say, or think about. Can’t we make up some rules about what or what not to ask?” Potter frowned. “I really don’t want to relive some of the worst moments.”
The four of them deliberated, seemingly communicating without words, until they chorused, “Another song first.”
“What am I charged for?” Draco protested, refusing to struggle against the cuffs, but raising his chin a tad and straightening his back until he was satisfied with the air he exuded.
The punches had been replaced by unrelenting kicks, until it took literally every ounce of focus to concentrate on his breathing.
Draco smiled. “I’ll consult my parents on their plans and get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you.”
A soft huff sounded from Malfoy, making Harry preen. “I still manage to get a reaction out of you, even though the Healer said it would be a miracle to hear something from you. Some things never change, do they?”
That morning, Draco had the fifth year students in his classroom. He saw two Weasleys, indeed: Louis and Lucy, but also James Potter. When scanning the room further, he saw Theresia Zarnel sitting in the back of the class, reading some book and copying parts of it. Today, they would be brewing a rather difficult potion, with rather difficult ingredients. Draco was curious to see whether the Zarnel girl would be as good as Scorpius told him.
'Slytherin left!' Hermione exclaimed, sounding anguished. 'Of the founders, Slytherin left one day and never returned, and ever since then, the school hasn't been the same, that's what the Sorting Hat was trying to tell us. It said we had to work together and unite against the threat outside or we'd just be helping, remember? Voldemort sowed dissent and division, just like he split his soul, and the opposite is uniting—'
Aunt Petunia was weeping in the corner, face buried in her hands, her hair disheveled and her skin splotchy where Harry could see it between her fingers. She sobbed out, “Oh, Diddy, my Diddykins,” when she looked up at Harry with wild eyes, but that was all. He felt a sudden crippling pang of pity for the relatives who had treated him with nothing but scorn and hatred all his life.
“I saw him just like you did,” Hermione said, as if she’d read his thoughts. “After Moody gave him Veritaserum. I know, Harry. I don’t think it was right, either. But that doesn’t mean he isn’t dangerous. Remember, Lucius Malfoy is loose now.”
“It has nothing to do with him!” Harry snarled, hands fisting. “What is this? First Remus and now you! Did you find me on purpose? Did he tell you to come looking for me?
Harry watches Pansy Parkinson shove past Neville, her lips forming words that can't be unifying in the least, and he says wryly, 'Not quite.'
'Why, justice,' Doge said, surprised. 'Pardon me if I wax poetic for a moment, but there is a balance of the act and the punishment, and the worse the act, or even acts, the worse the punishment. It's quite simple, you see, and with enough time to judge the balance fairly and level-headedly, I daresay it works out for the best.'
Malfoy is waiting for him when he reaches the Entrance Hall, but Hermione and Ron are nowhere to be found.  Before Harry can even ask, Malfoy glimpses the question on his face and says, 'Still in the library.  Granger's going spare over leaving books behind.  Now she wants to Floo some back.'  He sneers.
At last they reached the portrait hole and Ron uttered the password, but Hermione pulled them back before they could follow Ginny through the entrance, nearly yanking Harry's robe clean off his shoulder. 'I've been thinking,' she hissed. 'We have to do something.'
“If you’re offering,” Ron said with a grin. “You know, Harry, I’m beginning to think Jack never sleeps. I saw him in the common room at two in the morning one day, muttering about our plan of attack. Ginny heard from Andrew that he spent all summer practicing.”
They ate Christmas dinner on old mismatched dishes—Narcissa Malfoy nearly fainted when she heard what had happened to the china—though they did not eat in the kitchen but in the dining room on the ground floor, with its forbidding dresser and heavy curtains. There were two courses and three utensils more than Harry expected, and his wineglass kept leaving dark rings on the fine tablecloth that embarrassed him until Teddy flung a spoonful of mashed potatoes on the floor and another in Narcissa Malfoy's hair.
The library was no place for goings-on like the sort Malfoy and that Greengrass girl were up to. Harry cast a scandalized look at Hermione, expecting agreement; no one took the sanctity of the library more seriously than Hermione, save perhaps Madam Pince.
'Yeah!' Ron says, before Malfoy can open his mouth.  Behind Malfoy's back, Ron then mouths something that looks a bit like, 'Hermione's birthday parties?'
Ona snorts.  'Malfoy?  You don't know very much about the magical world yet, do you?  I'd say Lucius Malfoy is better protected than Rufus Scrimgeour himself.'
“Well, if it isn’t Harry Potter come a-calling,” Bellatrix Lestrange drawled, a smile like the Cheshire cat spreading on her face. She was sitting in a low armchair, legs crossed, holding her wand idly. “Stand up like a proper guest, Potter. Unless you’d prefer to grovel as you are.”
The owls had come every day.  That was the last thought in Vernon Dursley’s head when he answered the door of number four, Privet Drive, to find his son, as red-faced, sweaty, and stout as usual, lying on their front stoop with his eyes glazed. The owls had come every day, he had not stopped them, and there was no reason for this.  It was nearing evening in the middle of sweltering July, and his ample son Dudley was gazing up at him with the stare of the dead.
Hermione nodded. 'Well, that's understandable. You both have a history, and it's not easy to let something like that go. If you want to let it go, that is.'
“You can come with me and Dean,” Ginny offered, at his elbow. “Or,” cheekily, “it looks as if Lavender and Parvati are going, you could walk with them.”
“Don’t you dare say one more word about Sirius,” Harry hissed, furious with Malfoy, furious with himself for continuing. “I’ll meet you tomorrow night at seven. Right there.” He gestured fiercely behind him, towards the Room of Requirement.
Harry almost took a step backward when he entered the Room of Requirement and saw a scowling Draco Malfoy with his wand extended towards the fireplace. He looked angry enough to destroy a couple dozen house elves, pale frustration creasing his features. Harry made a move to enter, knocking halfheartedly on the door as a warning, just as he heard Malfoy snap, "
They boarded the train together, waving to Ron and Hermione, who disappeared towards the front. Ginny took Harry's hand the minute they were out of Mrs. Weasley's sight and pulled him towards the end of the train and into an empty compartment.
“YOU ATTACKED ME LAST YEAR,” Draco shouted back, shoving forward with his fists at his sides, fury screwing up his features. “NOW WE’RE EVEN, POTTER. ISN’T THAT WHAT IT’S ABOUT? ISN’T THAT WHAT IT’S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT, GETTING EVEN?”
'He was just giving an introduction, it was the first class,' Harry suggested, trying in vain to smooth over the situation. 'I'm sure he'll get to all that stuff really soon.'
"I told you," Draco replied, though his tone was far more constrained this time. "You can't lump us all together. I hate what they represent, killing out the magic, slowly but surely turning us into them. But I'm not going to wipe them out because of it." Once, he might have smirked at this; now he only peered at Harry, half-afraid, half-belligerent. "I just don't want anything to do with them."
Ron sees the expression on Harry's face and says tentatively, 'Herm, isn't an hour a—sort of a long time—'
'Always,' Narcissa said. 'God knows why. She cried when he was sorted into Gryffindor. She made me promise never to tell.'
Harry said nothing, but he went to the stairs, Uncle Vernon’s stare following him all the way. He heard his aunt weeping all the way from his bedroom, and he threw his books and other possessions together with more of a racket than was necessary, trying to drown her out. When he had finished, either she had stopped crying or someone had cast a Silencing Spell, and he descended the stairs to find no one there but Mr. Weasley.
“Yeah, tell Lupin we all wish him one,” Ron said. He grinned at him. “Hermione and I will send you an owl tomorrow.”
'Well, I'm going to talk to them about it,' Ron says, and marches off towards the kitchens before Hermione can stop him.
“When you were blathering about Quidditch, shouting at me about Granger, or demanding I let you fuck me?” Draco said, so frankly that Remus coughed loudly to cover what might have been a laugh. “Now it’s your turn to tell the truth, Potter. Tonks warned you about me, didn’t she?”
“Good,” Tonks said, in his ear. She was watching Malfoy and Pansy too. Pansy was running her hands up Malfoy’s chest and twining her arms around Malfoy’s neck, and then she leaned up and kissed him, lewd and open-mouthed, still pressing up against him. “Harry,” Tonks whispered, and he had a moment of bewilderment before they were kissing too, her lips soft, her thumbs tucked in the belt loops of his jeans and pulling him closer. It was different than kissing Cho, which was mostly her crying with her lips pressed on his. Tonks was twining her tongue in his mouth and she pulled back to bite softly at his lower lip, his fingers bruising her back, her body small and eager against him.
Griphook stared at him for a long minute. Across the grand lobby, Harry heard several people gasping his name and he was sure they were pointing, but he paid them no mind. Finally, Griphook's mouth twisted into a small, savage grin.
“Don’t talk,” Draco whispered harshly and sank down on top of him, both of their clothes half tugged off, Harry’s hands tangled in his hair. Harry’s foot curled around the back of his knee and pulled him closer, and they surged against each other for several urgent minutes; Harry could feel the slide of Draco’s cock against his abdomen and Draco was breathing heavily in his ear, faster now, as pleasure shocked through Harry’s body and he felt Draco tense, bucking against him, and watched his face as he came, mouth a silent O.
“Wotcher, Harry!” She grinned over at him and, probably noting the redness in his cheeks, winked at him. Instantly, the fifth-year boys behind him began to whisper. Ron prodded him in the side with his elbow. Harry felt his face burning inexplicably. If he was this miserable now, how could he possibly sit through Defense Against the Dark Arts every day? He’d likely go mad.
In the dream, Harry's hands were sweating. He pushed open the dark door and found himself in that bathroom, Malfoy twitching and pale on the flooded tile, his whole face screwed up in fear. 'I'm going to die,' he whimpered, 'I'm going to die! Potter, help!'
'Well, you're an uncouth savage,' Malfoy says.  'One wouldn't expect you to understand.  Oh, Potter, there you are—what, what are you looking like that for?'
“Oh, what do you expect?” Hermione said, approaching them. She had pulled her hair back, probably for the heat but also for better visibility. “You have seen them duel, Ron.”
'We already are,' Malfoy yells, but his voice comes to Harry faintly, swept away by the wind.  Harry shoots off past him, and Malfoy tries to follow; Harry can hear him shouting at his broom, which appears to have trouble turning right.
'What do you think?' Malfoy grimaced. 'Haven't you heard, Potter, we're like family now. And move aside, this is
“H-harder,” Draco muttered, tearing his mouth away from Harry’s, and he sounded irritated at having to say it at all, embarrassed even in the darkness between them. Harry thought it endearing, amusing, and incredibly hot.
'I would have sold him out in the end,' Malfoy muttered. 'If it would have done us any good. But no one ever asked, so it wasn't—and he didn't even hesitate. When he took the curse Dolohov meant for me. He should have hesitated, Potter. I would've.'
Malfoy scanned the assembled and eventually picked Evan Dobbs, a muscular fourth year from Ravenclaw, as his first Beater. Harry picked Ron, and Owen his house-mate Eleanor Branstone as Chaser. By the time they had finished, Harry had assembled a fair team, if not the best: he had Ron as Keeper, a Hufflepuff named Roger and a sixth year Gryffindor as Beaters, and three Chasers all from Ravenclaw. Demelza had snatched up Dean Thomas, and to Harry's surprise, Malfoy had taken Jimmy Peakes, the broad-chested Gryffindor who had played Beater during Harry's sixth year.
'Well, it would have explained a thing or two,' said Ginny. 'I don't know, Harry, you always seemed to be, er, interested.'
, but the words that emerged were, ‘I—sorry,’ and after a few minutes of waiting for more and not getting it, Malfoy went away.
Hermione grasped Harry's arm and stumbled away, pulling him with her behind an empty cubicle where several spell-checking quills were running simultaneously over a long scroll of parchment. She was gripping his arm so tightly he almost fell over.
Draco seemed as shocked as Harry was when Harry broke away. “Oh god,” Harry said, raggedly, “look, I can’t.”
Harry desperately cast about in his mind, but couldn’t for the life of him think what they were studying. He looked up hopefully. “Um, stir it?”
“. . . quite a surprise to see you back here,” Mrs. Black was saying, her voice surprisingly civil. “After being infested by Mudbloods and werewolves, I’d thought there was no hope for us. Bless you. How is your mother?”
Ron practically glowed as he glanced in Hermione’s direction, as if to say, see? “Thanks, Luna,” he said pointedly. Luna giggled.
The next morning, Harry's friends were not speaking to one another. Hermione was sitting at one end of Gryffindor table amongst a crowd of first years, her nose in a book; every one of them looked terrified to be in her immediate presence and they were all eating breakfast in petrified silence. Caught up in her reading—or, more likely, her fury—Hermione paid them no attention.
For Harry’s part, he concentrated wholly on his plate, unable to look up to his left and meet Tonks’s eyes. He could not forget her presence, however; down the table, he heard some fourth years discussing her eagerly. Apparently rumors had already begun circulating, and her status as a Metamorphmagus was the least of it. When he heard one boy loudly claim he’d seen her in
Harry snorted. 'This is Malfoy we're talking about,' he said. 'Not the most subtle bloke, is he? A cursed necklace? Poisoned mead?'
'I'd like to be,' Harry mumbled. Robards had seemed an amiable man, with hair almost as helpless as Harry's own. 'We need the likes of you,' he'd said.
They all eye him as he approaches, but eventually the tall girl with freckles—Harry now wonders if she might be Orla—breaks off, and the other girls follow.  Ginny gives Harry a sidelong glance, but heads off to talk Quidditch with Katie.
'I would not be rubbish,' Malfoy says indignantly.  'Also, I won't always be dead.  Eventually things will be explained.'
Harry was always famished on the days Gryffindor had early morning practice, and this morning, Jack, the captain after Angelina, had run them extra hard. They played Slytherin in two weeks, the first match of the year, and with Gryffindor’s team sorely depleted after Angelina, Alicia, and the Weasley twins had left, they were on a tight schedule to train.
Harry winced; he had no desire to pore over old Charms exams all day. 'I can't, I have to meet—' he began; he was about to say Ron, but at Hermione's look of fury, he swiftly changed his mind. 'Malfoy. We need to rearrange the Quidditch schedule.'
Harry wonders if Draco has the same thoughts. He wonders if, for Draco, being a painting is far less romantic and wonderful than Draco expected. He never asks, however. Usually he just sits and waits. The time passes faster than he thinks it will. Most of the time, Harry feels like a painting. He can't explain it, only that he has no desire to move, to live; he isn't, after all, a person. He's a replication of one.
'What's the worst burn you've ever had?' someone called out from behind Harry, just as someone else shouted, 'Have you ever ridden on one?'
'Like you've never taken ill,' Malfoy shot back. He flung a hand to his forehead and moaned dramatically, 'Oh, the Dementors, I'm so scared I could just faint!'
Could that be? Did he . . . want Malfoy? Malfoy, the bigoted little creep who complained to Snape about him and laughed about Sirius in his face and called Hermione a Mudblood just to see him fume?
Kneeling down on the hearth, Harry took a deep breath. Then he gritted his teeth and tossed a handful of Floo powder into the fireplace, where it flared an eerie, spitting green.
Harry was reminded all too clearly of the conversation he had overheard that morning. Charlie did not seem too miffed at him, but he still felt a squirm of guilt in the pit of his stomach. 'I don't,' he muttered, 'I don't know all that much about it.'
They are both silent, and Harry can hear Fred flirting with the girl who might be his cousin.  He says at last, 'Oh, there's something else.  I think Mundungus Fletcher stole something from Sirius's house that we need.  It's a gold locket.  He said you might still have it, he left his suitcase in your basement.  Could you—could you check?'
This wasn’t like kissing in the shed, lazy and tentative in the weak morning light; Harry was gasping up into his mouth, pleasure shooting up his body, and they were kissing sloppily, desperately, a mash of tongues and lips and teeth. Draco bit him too hard, once, and he groaned, “ow,” and Draco licked at it, then kept licking, tongue hot and wet against Harry’s jaw, and he groaned for an entirely different reason.
Malfoy's mouth went tight. 'And what makes you think I want to spend the next ten months at that despicable joke of an institution? I've had enough of that filthy old school to last me several centuries.'
'Happy birthday, Harry!' he exclaimed, knocking Harry's breath out of him with one clap on the back. 'Go' yeh somethin' special. Though' yeh migh' need one, headin' back ter Hogwarts an' all.'
'What else do you have to do?' Harry demanded. 'You aren't exactly swimming in job offers, and from the look and sound of it, you aren't swimming in money either. I heard you and your mum arguing about pawning off your old things—'
'Look,' Harry says, and this is the part that he was not ready for Ron and Hermione to hear, 'Malfoy, I know I promised you that if this didn't work, you could walk free.  I'm not going to pretend I'd be happy about it, and we'd have to Obliviate you and your mum, but you can go if you want.'
'I did miss it,' Malfoy snaps, far more vehement than Harry expects.  'I just had more important things to do, Potter, I didn't have time for
Moments later, a tall woman glided down the narrow stone stairs into the basement kitchen, all traces of her daughter's clumsiness gone. 'Harry,' Andromeda Tonks said warmly. 'I'm so sorry. We meant to arrive earlier but Teddy made such a mess this morning that it took near an hour to tidy up.'
Malfoy looked at him for a second, and then he said, for once without a trace of disdain or superiority, 'He's got no parents! Theodore, I mean, he hasn't got parents, who's going to buy him his first racing broom and send him sweets at Hogwarts and take him on holidays if he's got no parents?'
So many had died, senselessly, Fred still grinning, Ernie Macmillan, even Mandy Brocklehurst, and he could still not remember if he had ever said a word to her. It was horrible, he could not grasp the magnitude, would not ever. He had looked at the piles of dead in that room and cared only about his own because he could not stand to care about more, he could not bear it. Remus and Tonks, Fred, Colin, wasn't it enough, wasn't it?
Ron looked at both of them strangely. “Well, all you’ve got to do is figure out where Jugson and Rookwood are hiding,” he said. “I wonder if Dumbledore can find out all the booksellers—"
“I’m not happy if you’re miserable,” Ron muttered. “Look, I just wanted to say that, er, Hermione’s right, and you’ve got to see something in him that nobody else does, or he wouldn’t be worth your time. And that, er, I’d rather be your friend and know you’re shagging Malfoy than, er, not be your friend and know that you’re shagging Malfoy. That’s all.”
'A little warning next time,' Malfoy snapped, getting to his feet with spots of color in his cheeks and an indignant look on his face. Then he smirked. 'Also, you have cobwebs in your hair.'
'Cheers,' Malfoy said sourly, tipping his glass to his mouth and swallowing half the liquid. Harry took a much smaller sip, and he still coughed as it burned its way down.
'I'm sorry,' Cho said, and she looked like she meant it. 'You seemed to . . . well, I know you cared about her. And she really liked you, Harry. What happened? Oh, never mind, I'm prying, I always do this.'
'Now,' she says briskly, tucking away her wand and wiping her palms on the sides of her jeans, 'maybe we can talk.  Ron, I'm not entirely sure that's Harry.'
Malfoy lifts a lip in disdain.  'Likely hours,' he sneers.  'Granger found a whole new room of books, she's driving Pince mad—the old bat won't let her alone—'
clear his mind before sleep now, and it was only a matter of time before he could manage the same while facing down Snape. Things had been getting easier . . . he hadn’t had a dream about Voldemort in months . . .
This had the intended effect, for Ron and Hermione unclasped hands guiltily, and Ginny loudly returned to her conversation. At the same time, Hermione began talking about legal reform for domestic disputes involving house-elves, so enthusiastically that Harry was quite glad to leave her with Ron and dart off to Madam Puddifoot's.
'Oh, you're not nice!' Harry retorted. 'Almost getting Hagrid fired, laughing at Hermione, making fun of people for the blood they were born with, something they can't help and doesn't make a bit of difference!'
'You can look at the letter if you want,' Malfoy snarls.  'Maybe you ought to have done before waking up the whole house.'
'Schedule switch,' Harry muttered. Across the room, Astoria Greengrass had her fingers in Malfoy's hair. From Harry's distance, Malfoy looked surprised but not altogether displeased.
“I’m a Slytherin,” Draco hissed at him. Harry had the sudden impression of seeing him for the first time, standing before him as a stranger. Was that how it would be from now on? “And you’re everyone’s favorite Gryffindor. How did you
Inside, Slughorn spotted him at once, pushing through the crowds to grasp him by the hand. 'Harry, Harry, my boy!' Slughorn greeted him jovially. 'So good to see you, so pleased you could come! After all those practices that kept you away in sixth year, and of course, your string of detentions—'
, you simpleton,' Malfoy snarled. 'I happen to think of it as assessing the situation and doing what's best for me. Slytherins take care of themselves, which is probably why there isn't a single one in Hogwarts, because we all know that setting foot in that castle is suicide!'
“Starting things you can’t finish,” he said furiously. “Walking into things you know nothing about—"
But what Lucius Malfoy was doing, Harry didn’t find out. He felt the dream slipping away from him, and he tried desperately to remain, but it felt as if something were grasping after him, pushing him out . . . his whole head felt as if it were about to shatter, his scar searing . . .
“I’ll say whatever I want about him,” Harry sneered back, unaware of just how eerie he looked, blood dripping down his face. “What’ll you do about it, Malfoy? Run away? Because that’s what your dad did, you know that? Ran away like a filthy coward.”
Malfoy led Harry through the hallway lined with portraits, all of whom whispered and pointed, and down another hall whose marble floors were so polished that Harry could almost see his reflection. He expected to go to the drawing room he remembered, or the study where they had had their firechat, but Malfoy headed to a smaller room, papered in a blue and gold pattern that reminded Harry of peacocks. A small but merry fire was going in the little fireplace, and the diamond-paned windows were polished to a gleam. A large white quill hovered above the desk and its clutter of papers, as if awaiting orders; Malfoy waved his hand and it whisked itself into a drawer.
'I wouldn't eat that,' Hermione warns as she passes through the room with a pile of books under one arm and Crookshanks under the other.  'It's from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, it'll turn you into a canary.'
'Oh, of course, I usually skip meals and lie awake nights and think about death all the time,' Malfoy snapped. 'That makes perfect sense, Potter!'
Harry looks at him, and not for the first time, he sees the panicked edge beneath Malfoy's façade of spoiled righteousness.  He sighs.  'Malfoy, I don't know what's going to happen.  If you are alive when all of this is over, and if I am alive when all of this is over, and Voldemort is dead, well—'
Harry rolled his eyes; it was obvious that Malfoy considered this yet another competition between them. 'I haven't decided yet,' he lied.
But at that moment, Hermione shouts, 'Everybody be quiet!' and both Harry and Malfoy, after spending months in the same house at her, stop talking at once.  Everyone else quickly settles into a chair and looks in her direction.
But late that night, Harry wakes with a start, blinking several times in the lamplight.  Without his glasses, all he can make out is the blurry shape of Malfoy, bent over his desk, holding open a book with one hand and practicing wand movements with the other.  For an instant, Harry's mind leaps to suspicion, to Unforgivables, to the Dark Arts.  But then he hears Malfoy mutter distractedly, 'Ex-
The kitchen of the Burrow is exactly how Harry remembers it, with several pans undergoing a vigorous scrubbing in the sink, and the teakettle heating up on the stove.  Harry catches sight of a bowl full of peas, which are dutifully shelling themselves into a pot, both sitting on the countertop next to an open cookbook.  Mrs. Weasley's wand rests between the pages.
Harry looks down at the table.  'I know it's a big favor to ask,' he says.  'But, well, Malfoy is going to be.  Er, helping us.  And he needs a place to stay.  I mean, because he needs watching over—'
Malfoy laughed, a humorless noise. 'Yes, between my chess games with the Bloody Baron and helping Slughorn sort through his Potions ingredients while he prattles on about
Tonks laughed. “Oh, that. It’s okay, I’ll show you. Just follow my lead, okay? Do what everybody else is doing. I mean, watch them.” She was pressed up against him and he could see the beads of sweat on her forehead, the flush in her cheeks. “Put your hands on my hips. No, lower. There you go. Now move. Feel the music? Okay, no, like this.” Harry was crimson with embarrassment, but he let her guide him into some sort of motion, keeping his eyes on how Malfoy was bumping up against Pansy. “Yeah,” Tonks said, low in his ear, “relax a little, there you go. You can move closer . . . Harry, I’m not made of
There were two people in the Gryffindor boys' dormitory. One was Dean Thomas, but, as Harry realized with a start, the other was Ginny.
Gryffindor was still in a state of mourning when Harry and Hermione helped Ron through the portrait hole the following evening; his broken leg had mended fully, but he still looked pale and tired, and he collapsed thankfully in the nearest chair. Hermione settled nervously on one of the arms, and Harry sat down on the couch. Across the room, a few second-years began whispering, but no one else was in the common room. Harry wasn't surprised.
'You're just jealous because I have visitors and you don't,' came Malfoy's voice, and then he stepped into view. 'Potter, what do you want?'
The room it provided was nothing that Harry had ever seen, but he liked its peaceful atmosphere; it was full of armchairs, and the windows were made of stained glass, though he couldn't tell what the pictures were supposed to portray. The early morning light through the glass cast a wash of green across Malfoy's face and Harry thought of the Slytherin lake water light, and simultaneously the long shadows and secret rooms of 12 Grimmauld Place.
Hermione looked ready to burst. “She’s lying about Anthony, too,” she said sharply. “How dare she attack me like that? Still smarting from her year of silence, I expect. Well, I’ve still got the upper hand; we know she’s an unregistered Animagus and can turn her in any time. She’d better watch what she writes. And I know just where she got her information, too, I’m sure of it.”
Harry threw himself into a chair, frustrated, as the door to the Room of Requirement clicked shut. They had been practicing Shield Charms all afternoon, though it was difficult, as Draco was irritable and moody, to put it lightly, and snapped at Harry any time his
'Maybe I can get someone to read them for me,' he mutters aloud.  'Though that would make me feel even more official.  Bollocks.'
“I’m standing right here, Malfoy,” Hermione said, her voice steely. Harry noticed that she was gripping Anthony’s wrist as if holding him back from pouncing on Malfoy. “So if you’re going to insult me, say it to my face. At least I don’t have to resort to petty attacks on other people just to keep my friends.”
Now, Harry says in the careful way he’s learned to talk about her family, ‘Just. If we had someone to—to ask about this. What to do. What not to do. You know. I just always feel like I’m mucking it up, and if not my mum, then Remus, at least, or Dumbledore—’
“He’s all skin and bones,” she said to no one in particular, tsk-tsking as she pushed him towards a chair. “Sit down, Arthur’ll be home soon, and I’ll warm up some leftovers for the both of you. How have you been, Harry? You must be exhausted, and it must have been awful, leaving like that—Arthur will take care of them, you know that, in fact, I’m sure he’s just finishing up the paperwork business right now—”
, and I can't stop it, I can't do anything, and I should because if I did it right, really right, then nobody else would have to die. Just Voldemort. And maybe me."
'We should go,' he says, reaching out for Malfoy's arm and yanking him upright; it's a more difficult task than he expects, as Malfoy neither resists nor assists him, instead just lying there like dead weight.  'Come on,' Harry says eventually.  'I'll get you back.  Otherwise you'll have a fit if you wake up in the morning in the grass outside Ron's house, and we'll all have to hear about it for a week.'
Harry turned the key and climbed off himself, feeling slightly shaky. He wasn’t sure if this was to be attributed to the experience itself, or to Draco.
Harry swallowed. "Just um, Sirius," he muttered, at which a wave of guilt overwhelmed him. Here he was getting red in the face over Tonks, and what's more, using Sirius as an excuse to cover up his embarrassment, and he was forgetting why they were cleaning the room in the first place. If not for the events in June, Sirius might be there with them, telling them wicked stories about his own encounters with girls while Hermione looked scandalized.
“Yeah,” Draco said. He was suddenly a lot closer than Harry had thought, and Harry’s mouth went dry.
“He came to every Quidditch match,” Harry said. “Even though he didn’t play.” He sighed, then paused. “Good night, Ron.”
'Your room is a mess, you know,' she says conversationally.  'Have you even left since yesterday?  I swear I heard Ron
'Right,' Ron mutters, but the minute Hermione gets up to wash her plate, he adds in Harry's direction, 'At least I agree with her on one thing.  Malfoy is like Kreacher, they're both pathetic and disgusting to look at . . .'
"Here," Harry muttered sheepishly when he returned and thrust the package at Draco. The other boy looked shocked and almost dropped the bundle, confusion creasing his expression as he slid a fingernail under the Sellotape.
“Oh, Harry, she’s very nice once you get to know her,” Hermione assured him, picking up his bag and handing it to him. “Come on, you’ve got to talk to Snape, remember?”
Hermione patted him on the knee; they were all subdued about the return, even her, though she had let out a small exclamation of pleasure upon receiving her Head Girl badge. 'It'll be all right, Harry. I know it won't be the same, but no one expects it to be like before the war.'
'We just got Slytherin back,' Harry said, and his voice sounded cold and furious, but he didn't care, even when Hermione looked scared and Ron taken aback. 'We can't let this happen! Not now. Not Malfoy.'
Harry thought to himself that Ginny would probably have a royal fit if she heard herself being referred to as a child, but he said nothing, especially as Ron peered at the custard-colored little balls of fur and squinted. One stuck out its long, sticky tongue and tried to lap at Ron’s fingers, but he pulled them back.
He exits, steps into the main street of Diagon Alley, and nearly trips over his own feet.  Standing with her hands fisted before the doorway is Pansy Parkinson, looking pale and scared and determined, and very much like she's been waiting there at least half an hour for him to emerge.
After that, it had been an hour of Charms with Hermione and a frustrated attempt to decipher his scribbled Potions notes before Harry could finally climb into bed.
'Now that you've been seen at one trial, they'll expect you at every one,' Hermione said. 'If Kingsley doesn't invite you to testify, every victim and victim's family member will be bombarding you with owls, begging you to make an appearance.'
Draco was scowling. “I went to the Room of Requirement to look for him and saw his things but not him,” he explained brusquely. “I was worried so I came to tell you.”
“We got in an argument,” Harry said flatly. “He said some horrible things about you and Hermione. And I told him that he was nothing to me. And then I cast Crucio on him.”
Malfoy's eyes flared unexpectedly. "Of course I miss him," he snapped. "He's my father! Of course I miss him!" And then, as if to reassure himself, he added, "I’m sure he’s alive. They’re all alive.”
‘I don’t know,’ Harry said. He really didn’t. Had he actually thought what bloomed in a room that disappeared once they left it could withstand the cold permanence of Daily Prophet headlines, mutterings in Diagon Alley, Howlers from witches he didn’t even know? Had he really given thought to what it might be like, to meet up for drinks with people Malfoy had insulted and spat on and perhaps even tortured? Had he thought of them sharing a flat, getting takeaway on muggy summer nights, Malfoy dropping careless kisses on his shoulder in the kitchen in the morning?
'I think about you sometimes,' Ginny says, looking at her hands.  She's silent, then says in a rush, 'It's so stupid, it doesn't have to be like this, you know it doesn't!  Just because we're all in danger—I could come to Grimmauld Place, I could help you, can't we at least make the most of this time—'
!' Harry said, scandalized. He wasn't sure which part appalled him more, the fact that Malfoy was taking post from the Hufflepuffs or that he referred to the male first year as 'the boy one.'
, and Draco "hmph"-ed his disapproval at a set of dress robes from Pansy. Their eyes met once, almost furtively, in the middle of tasting sweets. Harry had Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans (New and Improved Flavors!) from Ron, as well as several suspicious tins, care of Fred and George, that he refused to touch. Draco was perusing his stash of gourmet chocolates.
“Shh.” It was awkward from this angle, and the feeling of somebody else’s cock in his hand was entirely alien to Harry, but Draco was hard and drew in a jagged breath when Harry slid his thumb over the head, Harry feeling a strange surge of power low in his belly. He could feel Draco’s pyjamas wet against the back of his hand as he tightened his grip and Draco’s hips jerked a little as he pulled.
Malfoy’s eyes flared. “Well, why don’t you run off and do that, Potter, instead of chasing me around Hogwarts as if I haven’t got anything better to—"
When Charlie strode in, however, the whole class sat up straighter. Defense had always been Harry's favorite subject, but across the aisle, it looked as if even mild-mannered Hannah Abbott had gained a new appreciation for the course. Charlie glanced up at their attentive faces, as if he had forgot they were there, and flashed them all an easy grin. In the back of the room, someone giggled.
Ron gave a spectacular snort beside him, sat up, said, “Whazit?” and promptly flopped onto his side and resumed sleep.
Ron rolled his eyes. “Gin wants to work with the twins a few days a week,” he explained. “She hasn’t shut up about it since we set foot in King’s Cross.” To Ginny, he said, “Give it a rest.”
Catching Harry watching him, his lip lifting in a bitter echo of an old sneer, Draco nodded. "Fine. Ask away."
, and he comes that way, eyes still locked with hers. ‘Please,’ she says, and he fingers her til she’s breathing fast again, making soft urgent noises he has almost forgotten, the ones that make him half-hard again, make his throat close up with surprise—even now, even now—that she’s his. After she comes, he wraps his arms around her and wraps the blankets around them.
'And where were you at Hogwarts?' Ginny yelled. 'What did you think I was doing, I was fighting my own war, and it's hard for me too, don't you think it's just as bad? With Fred and Tonks and with—with Michael, how do you think I felt, seeing him lying there in that h-heap of bodies—'
'It doesn't have to make sense,' Malfoy snapped, and Harry was about to explain, in great detail, how unutterably frustrating Malfoy could be, when he stopped. And sniffed.
“Ron helped too,” Harry felt obliged to tell him. “Er, Professor, what’s so important about Hay-On-Wye? What does he want with it?”
Harry had not forced him into anything. He had come back to Hogwarts of his own accord. He had even said that it was for his mum, not for Harry at all. And if he had to answer for the choices he had made . . .
, Harry thought about saying, and didn’t. He could hear the response without saying a thing. Malfoy would sneer at him and spit, remorselessly,
'Fine,' Jimmy shrugged. 'Can't complain. Oh, hey, Draco!' The blonde Slytherin was passing through and glanced up at Jimmy's shout. 'Hey, have we got practice tonight? What with the snow and all?'
Harry does not ask why. He wonders, maybe, faintly, but he doesn't care enough to ask. "Three," he corrects instead. "You had my portrait done. You know how I feel—felt?—about it."
'It's mutual, okay, he doesn't care either,' Harry said. 'He doesn't even like me as a person, right? I mean, it's Malfoy—'
“You don’t really hate me,” Harry said steadily, undeterred. “If you hated me, you’d curse me, and that would be the end of it.”
'It wasn't a bathtub of chocolate,' Malfoy said irritably. He did not seem so white-faced or furious any longer, at least. He wasn't smiling, but he wasn't trembling either, and he definitely wasn't a soulless body.
“Why, then?” Harry demanded. He stalked back towards his chair and picked up his mug savagely. “Why did you want to?”
“It’s that dratted woman,” Remus said. “Not for the first time do I wish we could just remove her. But her picture appears to be rather firmly stuck to the wall.”
“She’s at the bloody Burrow,” Ron shouted. They had passed among a crowd of young witches who were chattering fiercely just then, however, and he had to raise his voice even louder to repeat it to Harry. “Came from Goldstein’s yesterday, after I talked to you,” Ron continued, looking bewildered by the entire situation. “Spouting some rubbish about realizing he wasn’t the one she wanted to be with. Been whispering with Ginny ever since. Bloody girls.”
'We can still take it all away,' Harry says, a flash of anger knifing through him at the almost easy way the corner of Malfoy's mouth tips up.  'Snape, remember?'
“As if I would stalk you.” Malfoy made a disgusted sound. “Don’t be nauseating, Potter. If you must know, seeing you begging for a little Potions help was amusing. But you’re daft if you think I’m going to let you near me with your wand.”
'She turned your hair brown,' Harry says mildly.  'And she put a bit of a crook in your nose to disguise you better.  That's it.'
Harry rolled his eyes; he knew that Hermione meant well, but this was altogether more trouble than it was worth. 'Come back to Hogwarts, Malfoy.'
She looked up from her knitting, along with several third-years crowding by the window, and gave him a look of such weight that the grin immediately left his face. “What is it?”
“Of course Harry doesn’t fancy that ugly little ferret!” Ron said loudly. “Ginny, how could you even ask him that? Harry would never . . .” He trailed off, just as his face drained of color. He turned and looked at Harry.
'Fine, I'll leave you to it, then,' Hermione said, and disappeared in the shelves. Harry was both grateful and disappointed that she'd gone.
,” Malfoy hissed, and shoved the handful of quills at him. “And you can take your fucking quills. I don’t want them
“Got a feelin’ this’ll be me best batch ter date,” Hagrid beamed. He didn’t appear to notice the change of subject. “Got me special treatmen’ fer ‘em, got ‘em growin’ good.” He suddenly stopped, and then said, “An’ where’re me manners! Yeh bin listenin’ ter me talk an’ I haven’ offered yeh a cuppa. Jus’ made some biscuits, if yeh’re hungry.”
He was about to turn around and look for the Slytherin when Hermione exclaimed, 'Shh, the Sorting's about to begin!'
Harry said, without tearing his eyes away, “I want you to cast the Cruciatus Curse on me like you really mean it, or I am not going to let you walk away like this.” He pushed closer to Draco, their faces inches apart. “Come on, Malfoy. I’ve always wanted to know. Do you hate me, or are you all talk?”
It wasn't right, Harry thought angrily, for him to get so preoccupied. First Sirius, and then Dudley. Before he knew it, it would be Ron, or Ginny, or Hermione . . .
Malfoy is in the kitchen when Harry finds him, picking over a half-eaten box of chocolates he filched from Justin Finch-Fletchley—'Malfoy,' Hermione says, 'you're such a horrible little
“I made a mistake,” Tonks said, and her voice was even, though she looked shaken. “I messed up, okay? They killed Dad and it scared me. They said they wouldn’t hurt my mum, they said I wouldn’t have to do anything really, just.” She glanced once up at her mother, then away. “Even you make mistakes.”
‘That easy, are you?’ Harry says with raised eyebrows, and she almost smacks him in the shoulder but for the way he guides himself into her, slow, until she is on top of him and giggling, and she whispers in a rush, ‘We’re
“I’ll just have Butterbeer,” Harry told her quickly. He wondered what would happen if someone like Professor McGonagall walked in and saw him drinking Firewhiskey with his former Professor.
'But you were friends,' Harry persisted. 'Weren't you? Doesn't it get lonely down here? Don't you wish your friends were here?'
'Because it can't be,' Hermione said. 'This isn't a cut-and-dried war, Harry, it's politics and cleaning up and reconstructing a world that was corrupt to start out, it's never going to be easy.'
“YOU MOST CERTAINLY WILL NOT SET FOOT OUTSIDE THIS HOUSE WITHOUT YOUR MOTHER FOR THE REST OF THIS SUMMER! AND YOU EITHER, GINNY!” she added, at Ginny’s footfall on the stairs, creeping down to see what the commotion was. “IT WILL BE CLEANING EVERY DAY UNTIL SEPTEMBER, AND THIS HOUSE HAD BETTER BE SPOTLESS!”
distracted. Sees something and turns towards it, even if there’s already an enemy in front of him.” He caught himself. “Well. A hypothetical enemy—the only ones I’ve seen in battle are—"
related? He remembered Ron telling him once that if wizards hadn’t married Muggles, they would have died out.
“I told you, Potter, your threat of calling me scared is hardly incentive for me to do anything,” Draco said scornfully. After he said it, he paled, perhaps realizing that he’d alluded to a time when they were on speaking terms, and added, “Besides, I’d rather not tarnish my record with the Ministry, if you don’t mind. As the last remaining Malfoy, I feel I’ve a reputation to uphold.”
'So,' Ron said, and faltered, 'so why're you acting like there's nothing you can do? Just rolling over and letting Ginny say you're finished?'
'Firewhisky,' Ron says knowingly, struggling to sit up before resigning himself to remaining splayed out in the lawn.  'Harry, have some—it stings a bit, but you stop noticing after a while—'
'Dumbledore?' Hermione exclaims.  She looks at Harry first, as if for confirmation.  'But he's, he's dead . . . isn't he?'
'Out,' Hermione said stubbornly, and the portrait hole swung closed. 'Listen, you two. We may not like Slytherin, but this is bigger than we are, it's bigger than us and Malfoy, don't you get it? This could
Harry thinks about that moment sometimes, and what it would have meant if Ron had said something different, or if Harry himself had. It would be easy, really, to think of that moment as the choice. To think that he could pinpoint that moment as the crossroads, the wrong or right turn. But he thinks, too, of Malfoy’s clipped
,” Harry said, turning and pacing towards the bookshelves. “I’m supposed to forgive you just like that? Forget the things you said? How am I supposed to trust you if you still say things like that you want Hermione to die, what am I supposed to think?”
January hurried by that year, blustery and wet, and by the time February crept in, the talk of the entire school was on Slughorn's Valentine's party and the Hogsmeade weekend that followed. Harry had invitations from ten girls before he could even think about asking someone. He began to explain that he had decided to go alone, though this only made it worse; everyone, including Professor Slughorn himself, seemed to have an opinion on whom Harry should take instead.
!” Harry yelled, and Bellatrix’s eyes bulged as she tried to speak and couldn’t. She looked insane, eyes bloodshot and wide, her expression livid, and it was a terrifying sight as she leapt at him, hands outstretched for his throat. He shouted, hoarse, “
But Harry, looking around, found that this was not entirely true: McGonagall, Sprout, and Slughorn were involved in a furious conversation at the head table, and every couple seconds, Slughorn would look toward Slytherin, as if he had just been mistaken and it would be full of students upon a second glance.
It turns into prank warfare.  Harry and Ron have never had Malfoy alone, at their mercy, all the time, and both of them have been trapped inside the House of Black for weeks with only Hermione and several archaic biographies of wizards with the initials R.A.B. for company.  For his part, Malfoy takes to skulking in the drawing room, wand in hand, jumping the instant anything moves.  Once, he sends a swarm of bees chasing after Harry; they buzz at him for nearly three hours before Hermione can figure out the counter-jinx.  He thinks, ruefully, that Malfoy's constant whining might have been a very small improvement.
‘Hmm,’ Harry only mumbled. ‘Come back to bed, Malfoy.’ He meant it to sound joking, riffing off Malfoy’s own comment, but it came out sounding like an invitation.
“I see you’re meeting the Weasel,” Draco drawled, as if Harry had not even spoken. He leaned against the wall, still mostly cloaked in shadows.
“We’re all doing work to prepare ourselves for the exams,” Hermione said briskly. “That’s why every assignment is important. And, Ron, don’t you think this essay is most important of all? We’re starting to study what makes Dark magic what it is. Understanding something is the key to knowing how to defeat it.”
“Naturally,” Draco said, sounding reluctant and irritable. He was still hunched in the chair, deliberately avoiding Harry’s gaze.
'I am, of course,' Hermione answered at once. 'I've done a lot of thinking while on holiday, and I'd like to go into a career with the Ministry. My main interest is now in prison reform, though of course I think the treatment of anyone who isn't a wand-carrier is appalling. Regardless, I'm convinced that the best route to reform is to push for it from the inside, and to work at the Ministry, I'll need all the N.E.W.T.s I can get.'
Her voice is small.  'For me, you mean.  You have time for Hermione and Ron.  You even have time for
Doge eyed Harry's wand, holly and phoenix feather, which since its mending the May before had worked like a dream. 'Now, now, Harry, you wouldn't—we have an understanding, don't we, I was an old friend of Dumbledore's and of course, any student Dumbledore treasured is dear to me as well—'
And with that, she ascended the stairs to the girls' dormitories, leaving Harry alone with a sleeping Crookshanks and the dying fire.
“Come on,” Harry breathed, aware of the subtle tension that had sparked up immediately between them. Draco was staring at him as if transfixed. He was staring right back. He said, quiet, “I’ve got something to show you.”
"I should go," Malfoy said, after a moment, watching the half-grin still hover on the edges of Harry's mouth. "As long as you aren't going to hang yourself tragically from the ceiling, or jump out the window, or something else befitting your melodramatics."
As for Hermione, she had overheard the small groan of frustration that Harry'd let out at the news, and she patted him on the knee.
'Going to Hogsmeade tomorrow?' Malfoy said when they reached the bottom of the staircase, the point where Harry turned off towards Gryffindor.
“No, I.” He couldn’t seem to finish his sentences. He rubbed the back of his neck distractedly. “I just. Oh, I brought some notes, I didn’t know—"
Harry turned on him sharply, their previous exchange looming recent in his mind. “You haven’t, have you?” he demanded, his gaze so piercing that Draco took half a step backwards. “You would tell me?”
Harry stared at him. 'Are you—it had nothing to do with this! Malfoy, you called Hermione the M-word! I'm not hanging around with anybody who uses language like that, and I don't think Andromeda will like
‘Give it time,’ Hermione advised. Harry was draped atop the Potions book he was supposed to be reading, the instructions for Stinging Solution an ironically cool comfort against his cheek, her fingers carding gently through his hair. ‘It was just—you’ll feel better, in time.’
“That’s nice,” Ginny said, as if she hadn’t heard him, and sat down next to Hermione. “What about Malfoy? He’s been strangely quiet lately, hasn’t he? I suppose the Slytherins are all still sad about Snape.”
Malfoy opens his mouth to retort, but Harry intervenes.  'If you let us use your dad's spells,' he says, 'you can send your letter to Pansy.'
'But you said it's been months.'  Out of the gloom of the hallway, Neville's earnest face shines up at Harry.  His jaw is set, the way it is every time he casts a spell these days, ready to prove something.  'Harry,' Neville says.  'Don't you wonder why he hasn't done it yet?  Got Snape, I mean?  Why haven't you made him?  Why are you trusting him?'
'What are you talking about,' Harry says, 'you got in some good blocking, I mean it.  Where is Hermione, anyway?'
going out with anybody,” he said dismissively and prodded Harry on the shoulder. “Come on, let’s not stand around!” Harry thought Hermione might have sniffed loudly at Ron’s comment, but he couldn’t be sure.
The room was so small there was no space to Engorge the beds, and the chest of drawers was jostled up against the window to make a narrow space to walk in. Malfoy drawled, 'Remind me again why I chose to sleep in a hovel with three people I hate instead of returning to the Manor to go on holiday with my mother?'
Harry looked at Malfoy and saw him anew: a dark bruise was blooming on his cheekbone where he'd stumbled into the wall on the way back to Hogwarts after drinking, and he was still limping from the broken leg (though Harry thought he was playing it up for Pansy, since he had flown in the Quidditch match just fine). His ribs still showed under certain shirts and on the whole he looked wan and worried, almost like he had sixth year, as if something was hounding him.
Ron turned red. 'Don't remind me. I'm only saying, maybe you need to have a go at a relationship that isn't—'
It took Harry several seconds to pull his eyes from the page to slowly look up at Draco. "It's a book on the history of the magical world. It's really interesting."
“What business am I doing right now?” Mr. Weasley asked as he trudged into the kitchen and collapsed into the chair beside Harry. Rubbing his temples, he added, “If it has anything to do with your cooking, you’re probably right.”
Mrs. Black sniffs, 'Suddenly thought he could be a leader.  Just a fool, in the end.  I had fools for sons.  Blood traitors, Muggle-loving traitors.  Now, with a boy like you . . .'
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed at him as if he’d read Harry’s mind. “I’m not a Weasley,” he hissed. “I’m not poor. It’s only until my father’s name is cleared and he—"
'Oh,' Malfoy says.  His head tips back a little, a bit closer to Harry's shoulder.  Harry lets it hover there for half a minute, then shoves to his feet.
“Sirius was close with my mum,” Tonks shrugged. “I was only eight when he was sent to Azkaban, but I remember him coming around sometimes. More when I was younger. He didn’t agree with her about the Order. But I still remember him begging to take me on his motorbike when I was five or six. Mum would have none of that, even though it was all I’d talked about since his last visit.”
Malfoy was inside the bedroom on the second floor landing. Harry paused to listen and frowned, then pushed the door open.
'Oh, and you'd take me back?' Ginny demanded. 'That's even worse, Harry, that he's just—what, a substitute—'
"Tonks's mum got out, too," Ron pointed out. "Isn't she married to a Muggleborn wizard? Harry, didn't Sirius tell you that?"
“More like slaving, if you ask me,” Ron muttered darkly, but they had reached the kitchen and it, at least, had succumbed in its battle with Molly Weasley. The whole room was well-lit and warm; pots were scrubbing themselves vigorously in the sinks, while Celestina Warbeck warbled tinnily from a small radio. At Mrs. Weasley’s side was a slim girl with flaming red hair, arguing tirelessly as she dried plates. Hearing Ron’s voice, both turned and exclaimed, “Harry!”
“You started that!” Draco snarled, clearly remembering their eerily similar encounter by the Potions classroom as well as Harry did. “There you go again, one minute you’re all smiles, the next you’re shoving your wand in my face—"
,” Harry said desperately, “I don’t—not even close—" He got to his feet in a hurry. The last thing he wanted to talk about was Draco, and coming in at a close second was Sirius, which Remus seemed equally inclined to bring up. “Look, I forgot, I told Ron I’d help him with Transfiguration, I’ve got to go—"
'Knew yeh'd show up eventually,' he said, gruffly pleased. ''Come in for a cuppa? Yeh're in luck, Charlie's here havin' a spot o' tea as well—gets a bit tirin', I expec', havin' ter put up with Professor Slughorn all the time—'
“Neither do you,” Harry retorted, “nobody tells you anything, bet that really gets you angry, Malfoy, that even Voldemort’s written you off! I should have known better than to try and be your friend, I should have known—when your dad killed all those people, I should’ve—"
'Nothing's changed,' Harry says; it comes out hard.  'I don't trust him at all.  And I'll ask him about Snape.'
Either way, it goes on under her nose for less than two days, and then she happens to be passing the drawing room just as Ron shoves frogspawn down the back of Malfoy's robes and Malfoy yells.
Still, he felt a twinge of guilt again at having enjoyed himself in Snape’s absence. Because Snape wasn’t just gone on a spying mission. He was never coming back.
, Harry thought vehemently, as he lapped past Malfoy again. You can do it. Down in the Gryffindor stands, everyone seemed to be yelling the same thing, and he thought he saw Hermione’s face beaming upwards as he sped by.
Malfoy gave him a wary smile. 'See you around, Potter,' he said, and without another word, disappeared down toward the dungeons.
He bit down a whine. Why did Draco had to look so good with his lips open slightly in shock. Alright. Apparently he was totally down to fuck Draco Malfoy.
Except he didn’t feel blinded, or in love. He had had been spiked with love potions before and he had been obsessed with one person. Now he just felt… too hot.
He felt more than saw Draco’s swallowing against him, his Adam’s apple rolling against Harry’s lips.
Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t comment further, walking straight to a locker’s door, opening it with a angry woosh with his wand. Harry watched with wide eyes as he started pulling a cauldron and a potion kit out of it, setting it all on one of the tables.
Harry looked at him, his mouth upturned and his eyes throwing daggers. Surely there was a better way to start that conversation. But no. Draco had to be a dramatic prick.
The biggest issue Harry had to adapt to after Draco’s mutation. He was… too quiet. Harry had learned to hate the quiet and Draco was now deadly silencious, no heartbeat and predator’s stealth, all that. But there were good sides. Well. One good side.
Draco made a little distressed sound but he nodded frantically anyway, his hands gripping Harry’s hair to keep him close.
The last one… had gotten too close to the Thestrals. There had been… an incident that they didn’t like to talk about. Considering his overall respect towards the creatures of Hogwarts and the ones living in the forest, it was to expect. The centaurs were pissed, they demanded his departure, and they got it.
Harry was gently shaking his knee, coercing him to wake up and Draco really really didn’t want to. But the glass of water in Harry’s hand did look enticing.
“What I’m saying,” Hermione continued in a tone she wanted calming. “Is that maybe it’s possible to… research. If it’s safe.”
Draco pulled away from his neck to look at him, incredulous as Harry’s soft cock fell out of his ass. “Seriously ?”
Pulling his hands away from Draco’s chest against all instincts, he gripped Draco’s belt buckle and undid it, making quick work of the button and the fly until he could get his hand on Draco’s prick. Draco moaned at the contact, his head falling back hard against the wall with a thud.
He looked exhausted, heavy dark circles under his eyes and sagging shoulders. And his skin was even more pale and cold than usual.
If his own upbringing was any indication, he’d probably make a terrible father. He couldn’t wish that on any child, especially not his own…
Minerva raised her head when she saw them enter, but whatever she must have seen on their face wasn’t to her liking, because she closed her eyes, her head dropping back in her hands.
Draco’s entrance now spread comfortably and dripping wet, there was nothing to prevent him from being fucked senseless. So he whined for it, whimpering and clawing at Harry’s back, hoping he wouldn’t take forever to get it in.
Inebriated, Draco wasn’t holding his moans back as he did usually, and it only spurted Harry on. He undressed them both too fast for Draco to properly register and then he was back to kissing Draco stupid, settling between his legs. Their cocks slotted against each other and Draco cried out.
Now he was legally an orphan with his parents in Azkaban, his manor was seized, as was the Malfoy fortune, or whatever was left of it, he was a convicted war criminal, forced to attend and have perfect grades in the very same school where so many people were killed around him, including some of his friends, and knocked up by his teenage’s crush.
Harry was a mess. He wasn’t coping at all with the war and what he did during it and how he died and had to come back and his leftover savior complex. The first time they shagged, desperate and messy and somehow violent, Harry made him promise to keep it a secret. Draco agreed. Of course he did. He got it.
When Harry’s hand crawled between them to fist his cock and squeeze, Draco came, hard, and then… then he blacked out. Probably. He didn’t remember.
Maybe that day in sixth year, when he was at his lowest, crying in a fucking bathroom and bloody Potter had arrived there to make everything worse. Like Draco wanted him to see that. And then he cursed him and really, dying by Harry’s hand that day would have been a thousand times more merciful than whatever he went through after that.
Harry closed his eyes, trying to summon his Gryffindor courage. He had never been able to have much of it under his head of house’s disapproving gaze.
The orphan part had been checked out early, but during war he was the ‘criminal’ with nothing to his name.
They arrived in front of the statue guarding the Headmistress’ office, and Harry said between his teeth ‘Newt’.
But he just needed something that felt good, they both did. In the whole of his shite life, he just needed that one thing that had felt right. But of course he couldn’t. He didn’t deserve it, did he ?
He accio’d his wand from where it was still next to the cauldron, and whispered a spell, pointing the wand at himself.
“You know what ?” Minerva continued, “You owe me one. A DADA teacher. You owe me more than one, but I’ll settle for one. YOU are now responsible for finding the new DADA teacher for next year. And if you can’t find anyone, it’s going to be you. And don’t even try to tell me you’re not qualified, we all know what you did in fifth year !”
Draco opened his mouth to suck in a breath, and Harry didn’t even hesitate before keeping those lips parted, darting his tongue inside.
“Just sayin’, man,” Ron said, raising his pint to himself. “Would suck to have survived Voldemort to die while shagging.”
Harry’s hands went to Draco’s ass, then, parting them, massaging them. He rubbed a finger at the entrance, waiting for assent. It was only perfunctory, Draco always wanted Harry inside him during those moments.
Draco’s lip was almost breaking between his teeth, and Harry leaned to soothe the pain with his tongue.
With an angry swish of his wand, the damn potion was gone, and his ingredients and cauldron were cleaning and tidying themselves.
If anything, the war and being the Boy who Lived Twice only made the attempts at getting to him more frequent. Except now it wasn’t poison. Just love spells.
Harry pushed the shirt off of Draco’s shoulder and it was enough to spurt Draco on. Finally, exhaustion and thirst pushed away his nerves and they were kissing, violent, bruising kisses. Soon, Draco’s fang had breached Harry’s mouth and the taste of blood in both their mouths made the vampire relax fully and moan against him.
Go out and face the girls, try to get to his dormitory. Maybe convince a friend to have sex with him. Which friend ? Would he ever make it to his bed without being jumped by a fangirl ? He didn’t like those odds.
When Harry’s mouth was properly ravaged, Draco moved on to Harry’s throat, biting hard on to it. Finally, Harry thought as he let out a cry.
No one would want their dirty little death eater secret to be known to all. Especially not the Savior of the Wizarding World. Draco himself wouldn’t want it to be known if it was him.
Fury shone in Draco’s eyes, but only for a second, before he turned his head and focused on his work again.
His hands went to Draco’s waist, and then to his hips, bringing him closer. Draco already felt more alive under his fingers, warmer, more present. Harry did that. His blood did.
“I guess I should be glad you’re not dying or badly hurt, at least,” she said against their fingers.
Harry wasn’t so sure. This death would definitely feel a lot better. Although he wasn’t sure about facing his parents or even Sirius dying this way.
He watched the blond get dressed again slowly and gathered enough thought to fix his own clothes to be mostly presentable. He probably stil looked freshly fucked, but he wasn’t about to try to hide it. If it detered a few fangirls, it was all for the better.
Harry protested, of course. He had witnessed by himself the effect of that damn curse. One of them died by his hand. That was the last thing he wished upon his boyfriend.
Sex while Draco got his fangs out and bit Harry, sucking on his blood, was the best sex they ever had. He never should have told Hermione.
He moved to take the glass, wincing hard as his eyes caught sight of the feeble first rays of sunshine. This was going to be a very long day. He felt so sick…
“Not like that !” Draco shouted, indignation in his voice. “Have you ever even listened in potion class ? I can’t believe you had all those good results in sixth year !”
Harry groaned, and shut him up by kissing him hard, pushing his tongue in Draco’s mouth and licking everywhere he could reach.
Slipping his fingers under the waistband of Draco’s underwear, he yanked hard at it until it went down along with his pants.
Harry was on his elbows to look at him, but the position wasn’t sustainable, exhaustion was threatening to take him away.
Draco looked horrified, pulling away completely and walking away until his back hit the wall. His hands were pressed on his mouth, he looked terrified. He looked like he hated himself.
“Isn’t that what we do ?” he said, finally looking at Harry. “We save each other’s arse and then we never speak of it again ?”
Gulping down mouthfuls of firewhiskey, Draco let himself feel all his anger at the unfairness of it all. He never had planned to get himself knocked up. He really didn’t need that. Not now. Not ever.
He shook his head against the feeling. Surely you could fight it as you fought the Imperius curse, right ?
And Draco… Draco just wanted to survive the year. He didn’t want to attract more attention than he already got, and he kept a low profile so shagging Harry really went against that strategy.
But as soon as their lips touched, he was a goner. His whole body felt on fire and he was pretty sure he was moaning, but too gone to hear it.
But Draco was kissing him back. His hands were gripping Harry’s robe, fingers clenched around the fabric as if to pull him even closer.
Only when Draco came on both their shirts, biting hard on his bottom lip, did the spell allowed Harry to find his own release and he almost wept in relief.
The next thing he registered was pushing Draco against the stone wall next the door, pressing their bodies together hard. And then he was sucking at Draco’s throat, pulling at the skin lightly between his teeth, eliciting sweet moans from the blond. He had never felt the need to devour someone like that, he wanted to swallow him whole.
Between moans, he whispered the wandless spell they used to prepare themselves, and then pushed two fingers inside Draco without waiting, finding him wet and loose.
Harry winced. He wasn’t ready for that conversation. But again, he would never be ready for it. He nodded, firmly, and Draco smiled.
Draco couldn’t have that much complaints, because he only pulled at Harry’s hair almost painfully. Also his hands were at his crotch, working fast to free Harry’s cock from his pants.
He didn’t even know it was possible until a few hours earlier. Male pregnancies weren’t impossible, but they were rare enough not to be mentioned to students. Until their appointment, he never thought he’d get to have this with the man he loved.
There was also a bottle of Hungover Potion on Harry’s lap, but he wasn’t so sure about that one. Maybe it wasn’t a great idea to drink potions while pregnant. Yet, again, it wasn’t a great idea to get drunk pregnant either, and it didn’t stop him.
He was just so lucky that the room wasn’t empty. Nope. There was Harry bloody Potter in it. Because it might as well go the worse way possible.
Everything had gone well, which only stressed Harry even more. In return, Draco spent a good chunk of his time trying to calm down his overprotective boyfriend, hiding his own fear.
Of course it would have had a rocky start, with the history, and it was something that she would have liked to avoid if possible.
Of course he would. In case he’d like to keep the damn thing. But he really didn’t look forward to the articles if it ever came out. How the dirty Death Eater forced a surprise baby on The Almighty Savior in a desperate attempt to recover his social standing.
“So what do we do ?” Draco asked when they entered the hall. “We go right now, before we overthink ourselves too scared to go ?”
And then there was the one that got in a fight with almost every other teachers, and provoked Flitwick in a duel. He won, of course, and it had been messy. She left that night, never came back.
That wasn’t fair. Draco had the same responsibility in that pregnancy. It’s not like it hadn’t been consensual.
With a chuckle, Harry fished out his wand from the bundle of clothes on the floor and locked the door wordlessly, probably adding a Muffliato for good measure.
“It’s okay !” he said, his voice as calming as he could get it. “A dose of potion and I’ll be back on track, I promise. So we can finish what we started,” he added with a smirk.
He didn’t mean to yell. They were in a muggle pub, sure, but they could still gather unwanted attention.
“I’m not going to die,” he said again, more firmly. “We got it under control, we never go quite far enough to be really dangerous, and there are healing spells and blood-replenishing potions and… I’m safe. Alright ?”
He only got back to his feet, stumbling rather indignantly, when he was thrown into an empty potion room.
Harry made a quick check of his body. The numbing horniness was gone. Leaving only a deep, immense feeling of completion.
“Why do you work yourself to states like that ? It’s no big deal. You need blood, just… take it. And if you don’t want to bite anyone, there are other ways. Like… we use dragon blood for potions, we could buy some ! Can you drink dragon blood ?”
His thoughts went to the hallway outside. How far were those girls ? Would they come in ? So he locked the door, throwing a lot of power in it. He couldn’t risk it.
Not so long ago he had everything, a family, a social position, a certain talent in his studies, a promising future… All of that was gone, because of some snake-faced asshole.
“It happens all the time now,” Harry offered softly. “The spells, the love potions. It’s like now that I’m not longer a wanted criminal and of age, I’m the most eligible bachelor and it’s okay for anyone to try to assault and force me. It’s normal, expected even. I hate it, so bad. I almost miss the good ol’ times where I mostly had to worry about people trying to kill me.”
He felt vulnerable, and soon he wouldn’t be able to defend himself if it didn’t stop. He was starting to sweat quite a lot, and to harden under his robe.
Stars in the night, because he was very close to pass out again. But not yet. He must hold a little longer. This was glorious. He didn’t want this feeling to end, ever.
He pushed himself up to a standing position, apparently still naked. He hoped he didn’t flash anyone last night…
After shutting the door, they didn’t need it per se but it made Draco less shifty, Harry began unbuttoning Draco’s shirt. Their forehead pressed together, he bit lightly on Draco’s bottom lip as an encouragement.
Those fucking journalists were the reason their shagging was a bloody secret in the first place. Harry just couldn’t handle having the press unleash on yet another one of his secrets, on something that was part of his personal life and wasn’t anybody’s business. You’d think the guy would have deserved a break after literally dying to save everybody.
“You’ve been hit by a lust spell,” Draco said, not looking at him. “Probably by one of those assholes out there, hoping to jump you as soon as you’re too gone to even care who they were. Waiting for it to pass is a bitch, so I’m preparing you an antidote.”
So instead he acted like the reasonable adult he was and went hiding on an secluded spot on the seventh floor with a summoned bottle of firewhiskey from the manor. Even closed up and forbidden, his place in the wards meant that he could still summon things out of it. And it’s not like his father could scold him for it. Or do anything, really.
Luckily for him, Harry took the hint pretty quickly after that, kissing him deeply and filthy, his body pressing Draco into the mattress.
“Sorry,” he said immediately, scrambling to pedal back on the conversation. “I shouldn’t have asked.”
The next one had been a victim, a week before the start of OWLs, of an unfortunate accident. He had tried to cast an hesitant necromancy spell for his studies, and it backfired. He disappeared in St Mungos’ and no one knew how he was now.
Breaking off, Harry only half whispered “What the…” before Draco was dragging him up the stairs to his dormitories.
“Good afternoon, my lady,” Draco said joyfully, his mocking tone coming from the comfortable relationship he built with his boss during the school year. “We have something to tell you and you’re not going to like it.”
Letting go of Harry’s throat, Draco sat straight above him, straddling his body, impaled on his cock.
He crooked his fingers, looking for the right angle, and knew he got it when Draco moaned against him, biting harder on his neck.
