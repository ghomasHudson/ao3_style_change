At the end, Draco did let out a tired little laugh.
“Of course I did.” He frowned. “We all took the same class.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry whispered to him. He silently joined Draco in his confused mourning.
But was it really Draco’s fault if he saw more beyond the bitter promise they made when Harry always looked at him like Draco was the most precious thing in the world? When Harry touched him like he wanted to keep Draco for himself? When Harry called Draco by his name and asked Draco to do the same, merging the two of them into one? When their magical cores beat in sync as though to confirm that they were indeed one soul that needed to breathe each other?
Malfoy laughed softly. “You better try asking that to Granger. Also, please tell her and Weasley about your problem while you’re at it.” He pulled him up from his bed and stirred him to the door of their room. “Now go.”
"And what is it that people are speculating?"
, Draco.” Harry shook his head, his brows furrowing. “We might love the thrill of first love, but passion dies. And then what? We need to lead our respective lives, grow and move on.” He sighed. “We’re so young and stupid to understand that we’re too broken for each other. You don’t know what you’ll regret.”
It was just an escape, Draco told himself. The escape from the inevitable shadow of the dead Dark Lord. Potter needed to breathe and Draco was there, practically offering himself to be inhaled as he pleased. But Draco was willing, even if he had to get hurt for it. Would it be better to feel pain or not to feel anything at all?
“Malfoy, I—”
“So why are you doing all of this?” Draco arched his brow tiredly.
This also something Draco didn’t get, Harry initiating small talk with him. Sometimes he asked about Draco’s days. Other times, he would tell him about his own. They could talk about nothing and everything for hours on end, right up until the break of dawn, until their time together was up. Then they continued their conversations when they met again, as if they didn’t spend days not acknowledging each other's presence in public.
Instead, he brought his wrist up to read the writing on it.
What would a rejection do to him? He had no dignity to preserve anymore. He had nothing. Might as well indulge the part of him that yearned for something he would never have. Crush that part to nothingness while all he could feel was the blank void in his chest.
“I’m not telling you the details of that seventh year’s love letter.”
left. This would be an endgame.
Suddenly having Molly in the room raised Harry’s anxiety level up to several degrees. It meant it’s almost time to go. ”Er—thanks, Molly. You’re very gorgeous as well,” he said faintly.
Draco inspected the bludger-like ball in Gita’s hand and furrowed his brows. “The ball seems quite… unique?”
Before Harry could say anything else, Neville put his hand on his shoulder. “Maybe you still have something against him from the past, but you know McGonagall wouldn’t let an alpha work in her school. Malfoy is a beta,” he said, repeating his last statement. “Speaking of McGonagall, looks like she’s about to make an announcement. Come on, let’s take a seat.”
“Relax,” Malfoy growled, thrusting impossibly faster. “You have to let me in.”
Astoria helped Scorpius get on his feet and took his broom. “I’ll keep this for when you properly train to use it, okay? It can be dangerous to play with this inside,” she said and landed an affectionate kiss on Scorpius’s head before leaving the room.
Being himself, Harry didn’t even seem to acknowledge his extraordinary skill. He simply shifted on their bed to wrap himself around Draco, always the one to demand a post-sex cuddle. And Draco would be lying if he said he didn’t enjoy it. So he snuggled closer, savouring the warm and slightly sticky skin of his husband on his own.
. And Harry wouldn't have it any other way.
you need to do,” he said. “You’re a free man, Draco, you can go abroad, start a new life. Find a new purpose. That’s what I’d do.”
He felt Malfoy laugh breathlessly against his lips, but Harry didn’t care. He wanted Malfoy and he wanted him now. Without breaking his kiss, Harry maneuvered Malfoy to where he assumed Malfoy’s bedroom was. He was satisfied to find a huge bed from the corner of his vision after hastily opening the door. Not wanting to waste any more time, Harry was all but throwing Malfoy onto the bed.
Usually, they never talked about it, never talked about their time together, especially not how long they would be together. But tonight, Draco wanted to know. He wanted to confirm that they were just a temporary item. He wanted to know how near the end was for him, because if he had nothing to lose years ago, he now had to prepare to part with a big chunk of himself when all of this was over.
Draco just huffed a laugh.
On other occasions, the scene could have been funny. His concern came true; Malfoy was
“Wait,” Harry called as he hurriedly chased him.
“I forgot.”
Harry pursed his lips at that. He wouldn't admit it, but that was one of his illogical reasons to be sent up north for this mission. Lately, there had been increasing reports of traces of Dark Magic all over Europe. More often than not, the local authority would ask for assistance from the British Aurors considering their infamous expertise in handling Dark Magic. Just in the past couple months, Malfoy had been assigned this kind of overseas mission no less than a dozen times.
But, of course, nothing was real. They were still running on borrowed time. Here, back in England, or anywhere they might escape to, their end would always be inevitable. Draco would get married soon and Harry would do whatever he planned to do next. They ran away far enough, but they couldn’t run forever.
With a sympathetic look, Astoria reached across the table to pat the back of his hand. "Let them. People always speculate, and they talk and hate." She smiled, small but genuine. "It's an old song for us."
The question startled Draco so much that he jerked upward, making his shoulder hit Harry’s chin hard. Harry groaned, hand lifted to rub his chin from the mild pain.
A sly grin touched Gita’s lips. “I was thinking about bringing you to my afternoon class. Remember Maya?”
Was Harry supposed to
A little part of his mind told him that Malfoy shouldn’t be here. An alpha shouldn’t be around children at all. They were aggressive and dangerous, known for their lack of self-control, and letting them in a castle full of underage witches and wizards was simply irresponsible. Harry needed to take Malfoy out of here.
“Maya?” he tried.
For Draco, he was Harry at times like this.
The thought of him calmed Draco, softening his posture as he let Astoria hugged him tighter.
“You’re just weak,” Malfoy said and picked up his pace.
Malfoy looked so offended and cross that Harry had to stop walking again to guffaw at him. At times like this, he could almost understand why Teddy loved this man so much. He was really interesting and weird, and it was an odd delight being around him.
"It was you, wasn't it? Potter’s trusted acquaintance," he asked with barely any preamble, quoting Engel’s words.
“That is what?”
Malfoy hummed quietly in affirmation. “Yeah, beautiful, aren’t they?” he said as he began walking toward the suspended fog of twinkling crystals. “This is not very common, though. It’s a pity we didn’t bring a camera with us. Teddy would love to see this.”
But Draco didn’t seem to mind the sloppy appearance of the slap bracelet. His eyes were fully focusing on the words written on it.
Harry often wondered. He might need to ask Parkinson or the other Slytherin bunch if he ever met them again.
“No, he really isn’t,” he said eventually.
“Salazar, no. He is a beta, but Mother is,” Malfoy said. “Everyone thinks she’s a beta with how calm and in control she is all the time, but she’s one of the most fierce alphas I ever know. Maybe I just got it from her.”
The orgasm was so powerful even when the only friction Harry had on his cock was from the soft duvet under him. Malfoy’s body fit perfectly above him, his weight a perfect pressure, and his hips that didn’t stop twitching throughout Harry’s climax were more than enough to keep the constant pleasure he felt, making his vision blurry for a few moments.
“They’re…,” Harry breathed, “surreal.”
Malfoy grinned. “Well, say whatever, Weasley, but just wait until I succeed in making that middle finger slap bracelet and you’ll see what could come from the so-called obsession.”
“I don’t know, to me, you’re more in shape than most of Aurors your age,” Draco reassured him with a shrug.
Draco turned to him, finding the skin of Harry’s cheekbone almost shimmering under the golden light. It was mesmerizing. “Is this what?” he asked, a little breathless.
Without words, Harry’s deft fingers began unbuttoning Draco’s silk pajamas, the ones he always said were too fancy to go to sleep in but secretly liked. Draco knew exactly how much his husband loved how the soft fabric clung to the lines of his body. He knew how sexy Harry thought the sleepwear was on him, which was the reason he always wore them in the first place.
. Yet here they were, in a getaway carefully planned by the Savior before their inevitable time to part ways. Just for what? Honouring their time together in the past five years? Draco could barely understand those years, their borrowed time that stretched so long.
He didn’t expect that it would sound so beautiful.
Draco wondered fleetingly if he could dodge it one last time to win the game.
For a moment, Potter didn’t say anything, until he looked up to meet Draco’s eyes, his own glinting with a newfound determination. “Can’t we be friends?”
Draco found himself smiling too. “You can speak English now.”
left unsaid between them.
. He had run out of ideas to convince Potter that he was truly losing it. Right now, he had even begun to wonder if
Hermione frowned at her boyfriend. “It’s Malfoy again, isn’t it?”
The owner of the name lifted his head with unnatural slowness. The grey eyes caught Harry’s.
The green eyes closed shut. Harry took a deep breath as his face contorted like he was in pain. “You know we can’t be together, Draco.”
,” Harry continued to sing, purposely off key just to piss him off further.
He tightened his arms around his boyfriend. His heart hammered into his ribcage as the guilt immediately tripled. “But I’m here now, right?”
Draco thought to himself.
“It’s okay,” Harry cut him quickly. “You can talk whatever to me if you want. I will understand. It’s okay, Draco.”
It was hard to admit, but Harry’s plan actually worked. All the effort Harry took to provide the time and distance for Draco to move on was proven to not be in vain when Draco found himself making peace with the shocking information in just a few days since discovering it.
Draco sat up on the bed, taking Scorpius and placing him on his lap. For a few moments in the peaceful morning, Draco indulged himself with more lazy cuddles with the youngest Malfoy. When he just woke up, Scorpius always felt perfectly warm and the citrus-scented soap Astoria bathed him with made him smell amazing. This was what Draco believed heaven would be like.
From that moment on, Harry knew he would always stay with him, and Draco would let him.
, Potter. You can do literally anything you want. You can join Auror training just to see if you like it or not. You can travel the world, spreading the tale of Harry Potter the Savior to every place on Earth. You can buy a tiny island and live as a recluse. The possibilities are endless.”
From where he nestled, Draco could feel the pleasant vibration in Harry’s chest when the man laughed. His arms tightened around him. “I think I got your point,” he said with a grin in his voice. Softly, he landed a kiss on top of Draco’s blond head. “Thank you, love. Now that I think about it, I don’t really mind growing old as long as I’m doing it with you.”
“How was your flight?” Potter asked as soon as he reached him.
“It was an accident, Draco,” he mumbled again, dropping his head.
Harry didn’t want this to end, but he felt himself barrelling toward his climax. Malfoy’s thrusts were relentless, pounding into him and hitting the right place every time. And the fact that Malfoy was there against his back, his scent blanketing him, was enough to heighten all pleasure he received. “Close.”
When she reached them, Draco belatedly realized that the girl was actually a woman, maybe a few years older than him, but her figure was so petite that she could easily pass as a little girl from afar. Standing in front of her, Draco mentally estimated about a feet height difference between them. Her skin was a beautiful shade of dark brown, almost golden under the sunlight, and she stared at him with her equally dark brown eyes.
“Well, this was a bad idea, I guess,” Gita sighed, but her eyes were twinkling with amusement. She looked around the gazebo, watching the chaos unfold as her students were busy jumping around to get Draco and Harry—two men who couldn’t understand what they were asking from them—to play together. “I was thinking you two could help with teaching English today, but I didn’t anticipate their excitement around new people.”
As soon as he entered the Great Hall, the familiar morning buzz from each of the House’s tables greeted him. On other days, Harry enjoyed the ambiance of excited youngsters ready to tackle their days, but today, the sound just amplified the bad headache he was having.
Walking when your whole body felt like it was on fire wasn’t an easy task, but Harry tried to rush as fast as he could. Turned out, he still wasn’t fast enough. He was just two hallways away from his quarters when footsteps were heard from behind him.
“So it takes a Potions accident just to make you laugh?” Harry asked Malfoy jokingly.
And it was very much deserved.
arched quizzically.
A smile formed on his face as the strange realization hit him. He felt a lot better than before, warmth spread from his core to every inch of his body. Just like the Snow Queen, Malfoy’s kiss numbed him to the cold.
, he thought and then considered the state of his kitchen.
Malfoy was silent for a few beats, regarding him intently. “You know what, Potter?” he said eventually. “You’re right. That’s kind of stupid.”
“Do you want me to walk you there?”
In yet different times, this man could simply be Harry Potter. The Savior of All. Just a heroic, perfect figure everyone adored that Draco could feel nothing about him. He was Harry Potter when Draco saw his face on the pages of the Prophet, he was Harry Potter when he was requested to give a public speech for all weary war survivors. For Draco, Harry Potter was a different person who was somehow detached to the Potter he knew.
From the corner of his eyes, Draco saw a girl throw the ball his way and he barely avoided it from scraping his arm. With the ball out of the way, he dashed to the square and hurriedly stacked two of the pirings onto the pile before he was forced to retreat as the ball zoomed back to the center of the field.
Malfoy’s dismissive demeanor made something bubble inside Harry—whether it was anger or arousal, he couldn’t really tell at this point. Before he did something he would regret, Harry stomped out of the room, thinking about slamming the door behind him but decided against it in the end. If Malfoy wanted him to act mature, Harry would show him what mature looked like.
“Astoria?” Draco raised his brows. “She’s fine.”
Harry gulped as his mind provided him with that delicious scent, flooding his brain with memories of when he walked past Malfoy and that scent blanketed him. It almost felt like a trap and an Imperius was put on Harry as an invisible force pushed him toward Malfoy. At that moment, Harry couldn’t think of anything but how much he wanted Malfoy to take him, right there and then.
But Harry was nothing but an overachiever. He would probably offend himself if he didn’t go an extra mile for everything. He brought Draco’s hand up to his lips, softly kissing the knuckles.
Stunned, he snorted an incredulous laugh. “Really, Harry, as fascinating as a slap bracelet?”
What the fuck? Couldn’t Neville smell his scent? Harry had never smelled an alpha’s scent as strong as this before. Surely no one else would miss it, right?
Suddenly, the air around them shifted. Malfoy’s eyes hardened and Harry could feel his scent had changed, smelling like danger, as if Malfoy tried to warn him away. “What do you mean by that?” he asked quietly.
Maya’s mother furrowed her eyebrows and pushed the plate of her chicken in red sauce closer to Draco, her black hair waving as she shook her head and talked in her language. Gita snickered a bit before she translated, “she said you look so skinny and need to be fed more.”
It felt so different with how the blond acted recently. And Harry was determined to change that.
Harry frowned and walked closer. “But then people will know that you’d been away.”
“I did, didn’t I?” Draco sighed in a mocking tone of regret. He put his hand on top of Harry’s chest, feeling his rapid heartbeat gradually return normal. “But if I’m honest, it’s pretty crazy how we are here now, forty years old husbands living a normal life,” he said quietly. “There was one point in my life I was so convinced I had no chance to grow old. Growing old with
Harry was so happy to hear him genuinely laughed that he almost forgot to respond. He grinned widely. “I’m not exactly famous for being good with words, am I?”
The idea of people not being aware of the change was almost mind-blowing to Draco, because for him, it was as if his whole world was flipped. It felt obvious from how Harry casually took his hand every time they went out for a lazy stroll. It had to be noticeable from the way Draco touched Harry in the most natural way possible, no longer questioning what was allowed between them. It couldn’t be missed from the contented gaze they threw each other.
Harry only snorted in response and moved to take the suitcase from Draco’s hand. “Come on, let’s get going.”
“How mysterious, Potter.”
Draco’s jaw dropped from the explanation. A
It was shown in his way of knowing the right way Harry took his tea, his way of tolerating Harry’s tendency to keep his environment messy, his way of complaining but still indulging Harry in his movie marathon night, his way of letting Harry curl in his lap and holding him whenever he was sad or upset—no matter how tired he himself was that day. It was clear from the way Draco always knew when Harry needed him.
The question was so unexpected it took him off guard. “Wh—what?” he stammered.
Draco stared at Potter’s smile blankly for five solid seconds before slumping back against the windowsill. That’s it, he had had enough of this. “Seriously, Potter, what do you want from me? I stopped bothering you from the beginning of this year, is it too hard to reciprocate the gesture?”
“I don’t think you are in trouble, either,” said Neville. “But the matter seems kind of urgent. You might want to see her soon, Malfoy.”
to the shift in the magic. It was so powerful it’s almost scary.
“Did you already befriend everyone around here?” Draco asked, a little more intrigued than he would like to admit.
Hastily, Harry rolled onto his stomach, hands automatically gripping Malfoy’s duvet in anticipation. He sucked in a deep breath and willed himself to relax when he felt the nudge of Malfoy’s cock against his entrance. Slowly, with the gentleness that Harry never expected from an alpha, Malfoy breached him and pushed in.
But everything must come to an end eventually, and despite the reluctance, Draco was ready to let Harry go—to a place he already prepared in his heart where his lover would stay forever.
“I do, you know,” Malfoy said.
Draco glanced at his journal, still in his hands the whole time. Since he retrieved it a few days ago from Potter’s vault in Gringotts, he hadn’t been able to bring himself to even take a glimpse of the words Potter left for him.
Sighing to himself, Harry thought about his friends’ words. Okay, he
“Is it what you want? A solo adventure far from home?”
But, while Harry’s mind was determined to escape from Malfoy as quickly as possible, his body wanted the opposite. When he turned around to walk away, a torturous sensation of unbidden arousal streamed through his veins, rooting him on the spot. His cock was so hard at this point it started to feel unbearable. Harry let out a pitiful whimper.
“That’s brilliant!” Ron laughed and immediately started plotting on plans to use the soon-to-be-launched invention.
Scorpius’s room reminded him of the one he had in his childhood, partly because he intentionally built it on the same side of the Manor so the window faced the same area of his garden that he loved the most, and partly because he decorated it himself while remembering the little things he liked from his old room. Morning light streamed into the room through the wide window, illuminating the soft blue wall with various constellations painted on them. Many toys were scattered on the plush carpet, a pair of mini broomstick figures were still hovering from the ground—Astoria had forgotten to deactivate the spell again last night.
Just when the blond looked like he was about to bolt out, Harry cleared his throat. “Hey, Malfoy, what’s up?”
Little did Hermione know, her teasing became a jinx because Harry did fall over right at the start of the aisle, as soon as his eyes landed on the figure waiting for him on the other end. He tripped and fell face first from the sight of Draco, his soon-to-be-husband, looking extremely breathtaking in his fitting navy suit, his hair—now almost shoulder-length—was styled elegantly back with just the slightest waves framing his face.
“Neat,” Harry commented with a whistle.
him. He had been hyper-aware about his presence whenever he was around. It was not the presence that bothered him per se, but the way Harry never failed to notice him and all the tiny details in his movements. Harry hated the way he found Malfoy’s serious concentration when he was having an intellectual debate with Hermione so captivating. Or the way his smug smirk whenever he was winning a chess game against Ron did something funny in the bottom of his belly. Or the way those slender, pale fingers playing with his velvet slap bracelet felt absurdly alluring.
Harry Potter was gone, but for Draco, he was back. He was back from his past, returning a piece of himself he gave to Potter a long time ago. Except that piece was tattered beyond repair, unrecognizable as a part of him. Draco didn’t expect anything less.
“Well, see you guys in Transfiguration,” he said hastily, not looking back for his friends’ protests as he walked briskly away from his table.
Draco just snickered and rolled his eyes. Honestly, what had gotten into Harry this morning? He had hoped it would be him—or conversely Harry getting into him, it’s his birthday after all—but his husband woke up and suddenly began rambling about an oncoming midlife crisis. All Draco wanted was to go straight to the celebration.
Harry ran his palm on his face. “I didn’t have enough time to finish it,” he muttered meekly.
Malfoy laughed lowly, but his voice was strained. “Maybe I’m distracting myself from finishing this too fast,” he said. “Are you close?”
Draco only rolled his eyes, but he easily agreed with the plan. An afternoon spent teaching a bunch of kids sounded lovely enough.
“I might, soon.”
But still, having his full torso bare in public was a whole different thing entirely. And Harry staring at him with his suggestive look didn’t help at all.
It was, as many disasters in Harry’s life, preluded by Hermione’s wrath. This time, however, the wrath was not at all uncalled for.
“Right.”
But there was one emotion overpowering the others, fierce and unyielding from the glint of his eyes. Draco saw it before, many times in the past years, but he could never determine its meaning. Usually, it was always veiled behind the lust, as if Harry deliberately hid it from Draco. Tonight, though, that emotion shone brighter than ever.
He decided it was always safer to just humour Potter. “Alice who?”
Raising his eyebrows high, Harry stared at him. “Did you just,” he deadpanned, “quote Elsa from that Frozen movie?”
Malfoy breathed out slowly as his expression stiffened. For a second, Harry thought Malfoy was about to jump forward and punch him. But Malfoy didn’t move. “If this is just a scheme to expose me as an alpha, let me tell you McGonagall knows about it. You can’t get me kicked out with that information.”
They were hurt, so they tried to hurt and blame someone else in return. Harry could almost sympathize with them, having witnessed so many personal deaths himself. Still, it was no excuse to be reckless, endangering his own life and making people he cared about worry over him. The guilt ate him up from the inside out as he looked at his now pacing boyfriend.
“No, Potter, listen,” he interrupted. “What you got wrong was that adjusting with post-war life doesn’t mean successfully moving on. For me, it seems more like a coping mechanism than anything—Granger pursuing what she has always been passionate about and Weasley staying close to her. I don’t think they are having it easy, but I guess you failed to notice their struggles the same way they failed to see yours.” He sighed and shook his head slowly. “It would have been much easier if you Gryffindors would just talk and didn’t try to be discreet about your feelings. You folks are terrible at sensing this kind of thing.”
Malfoy looked up, his expression was a mix of awe and bemusement. “Potter,” he said distractedly. “What in Merlin’s pants in this thing?” he held up the plastic piece.
want me?”
“Hey, I didn’t mean to interrupt anything. I heard some shoutings and I…” Malfoy trailed off, regarding Hermione’s scowl with unease. “I just need to get my book, if you don’t mind? I’ll be on my way again.”
He remembered the way Malfoy's scent drove him crazy, the way every touch felt like both burning fire and soothing ice, the way his heat in the presence of Malfoy ignited a flame in Harry like it never did before.
There was only one thing in his job description that he despised: waking up early.
“Of course,” he replied firmly. “It’s… we haven’t been friends with him for long. It’s… it feels a bit awkward when he is all down and sad while we don’t know what to do about it. Just try asking him, yeah? Work something out.” He cast a sideways glance at Harry. “And maybe do something about your crush on him while you’re at it?”
“I’m glad it was.”
"My smell?" Malfoy’s eyes widened a fraction for a moment before he laughed. "Considering you're the first person who ever pointed that out to me, don't you think that maybe your sensory processing was mistaken?"
“Wait, you don’t know knock knock jokes? Is it a Muggle thing?” Potter continued, furrowing his brows a little. The frown was gone in a second, his smile back in place. “It’s okay, though. I can teach you. If I say
Hermione’s mouth gaped in awe when she tried slapping the paper on her wrist. The paper curled securely. “Oh my God, Malfoy, this is… it’s so thoughtful of you. Thank you.” She said with a sincere smile on her face.
“You could forge the document,” accused Weasley.
, Harry recalled the women's words, her usually calm voice turned indignant.
after the war makes me wonder if it could have started way before if I only could sit long enough to ponder about it.”
He glanced at Harry, humming an off-key tune as he walked. Absently, Draco thought the Potters could really use this magic in the First Wizarding War. If only Harry’s parents could Apparate baby Harry to safety, away from the Dark Lord in his plan to end him, maybe he wouldn't have ended up as The Boy Who Lived. Maybe the First War would end differently. But no, Lily Potter had to sacrifice herself to protect her son.
“I know, I’m sorry.”
After a moment, Malfoy chuckled softly against his lips and the sound suddenly brought Harry back to reality.
Malfoy tilted his head, looking almost amused. “Then you should know that you can confirm I am an alpha when I knot you.”
“Sort of. Potter hadn’t been doing much in our room,” Malfoy said, his voice neutral.
As if Draco would need a reminder for that. Their time was ticking. Soon, he would have to return everything he borrowed, inflated by the interest.
And here was Malfoy, confessing to detect his inner distress that nobody seemed to notice before. Telling him how he didn’t say anything because his careful calculation favoured him to stay observing from afar. Saying he did care about him. Silently, in his very Slytherin way.
Draco looked up. “Where to?”
Draco supposed it was his fault after all. He was naive and dumb. He used to know better. Back then, he was aware that Harry could leave anytime, leaving a gaping void in his wake. As the time passed and their borrowed time stretched, Draco forgot to keep himself from being carried away. He got greedy. He forgot that all the happiness he felt with Harry was not his to keep.
Hermione was regarding the invention with her curious eyes. “That's fine spellwork, Malfoy,” she said eventually.
“Harry, I’ve had a crush on you since the Sixth year,” Draco said, his tone disbelieving.
“The connection of magical cores we talked about earlier. You… your mother’s sacrifice gave you a magical protection against the Dar—Voldemort,” Draco forced himself to say the name. It had been almost two years, he could stop calling the mad man
“Wait,” Weasley cut in, his frown getting deeper. “You disappeared before your wedding seven years ago. Someone from the Ministry said you returned through a long-distance Portkey, but no record of you leaving with one,” he said slowly, narrowing his eyes. “It was not long after Harry left Britain. Did you meet him at that time?”
The words stunned Harry. Did Malfoy still think Harry was trying to get him to lose his job? “I don’t need to have sex with you to know you’re an alpha, Malfoy,” Harry snapped, anger rising in him. “I told you before, I know. This has nothing to do with that.”
Granger and Weasley frowned, sharing a silent conversation between them, and gave him a sceptical look. The two of them practically barged their way into the Manor first thing in the morning after they received the news of their dear friend’s death, thinking it had been Draco’s plot all along. Draco had run out of ideas to convince them that he was as clueless as they were with everything going on.
Oh, that
Draco had his arm around his wife as they watched their son running around the living room with so much glee, the newest model of the Nimbus racing broom series squeezed between his legs, dragging on the plush carpet.
“You can’t blame me for that,” Malfoy cut him off, suddenly standing up and crossing his arms defensively. “
Harry approached them, a smile of his own on his face. “Is the Potion ready?” he asked Gita.
Soon, Malfoy would laugh at his jokes. He was sure of it.
“A book?” he asked, head tilted in confusion.
life, Harry.” He paused to look down at their intertwined hands, his breathing slightly laboured. “You make me forget about all of those. About who I am and the hard path ahead of me. You and the sweet friendship you offered me.”
“A bracelet,” Malfoy breathed. His fingers played with the toy almost admiringly. “I never saw any jewelry that looked this… undignified.”
“What’s going on here?”
At this point, Draco wasn’t sure he still had a place to call a home.
With his problem out of his chest, things gradually became better for Harry. He told Hermione and Ron about it, which prompted them to open up about their own post-war struggles. Malfoy was right, they were all hiding their feelings without knowing they would be better off letting them out. It was now easier to understand each other, to offer help when needed, to compromise and empathize.
She hesitated for a moment. “It just seems… a little off. Harry Potter signed a long term contract with his solicitor before disappearing from the country and he got someone to confirm his death to that solicitor. Don't you think it seems like something well-planned?" Astoria frowned, tapping her fingers on the table.
Why couldn’t they, he asked? They just couldn’t, Draco didn’t know why. And like the rest of the mysteries behind Potter’s bizarre behaviour lately, Draco hated that he didn’t know the answer. He hated being clueless more than anything. He hated that he didn’t understand the meaning behind Potter’s intense gaze on him, his terrible jokes, his relentless attempt to talk to him. He hated that he couldn’t interpret the way he responded to all of it. Why he returned the gaze, why he stayed whenever Potter approached him, why his heart raced in his presence.
“I… I saw you in the Owlery one night—and I didn’t mean to stalk or anything, I just happened to find you there when I was wandering the castle. And you… you laughed with the owls that night. Like, a genuine laugh.” Harry paused, wondering if he even made any sense. “I want to hear that again.”
Harry’s reply came almost a  bit too early. “Not at all.”
By this time, Gita had given up from getting her students attention. She tried to call them multiple times, pulling the ones latching to either Draco or Harry free, but to no avail. There seemed to be no way of restoring order to her little class at this point.
Potter could. It was more that Draco refused to believe that was a possibility. That Potter would do that after what happened once between them.
Gently—in contrast to the almost feral expression on his face—Harry ran both his palms down Draco’s torso, making the man shudder. He caressed Draco’s chest and sternum, down to his flat belly, tracing every single scar he once left there. Draco could feel those hands tremble slightly.
It was clear that Harry didn’t want him to understand what it was between them, what they were. He wouldn’t let him understand. He gave Draco their time, and he soon would end it his way. And Draco knew he would take anything offered to him.
A small smile tugged at the corner of Draco’s thin lips, reminiscing their conversation about him and his father. “You could say that, I guess.”
He stood up from the Gryffindor table and immediately caught Hermione’s attention.
“But…,” he stopped and frowned. “What does auspiciousness mean?”
With his small hand, Scorpius held the journal up, admiring how the silver dots on the cover shimmer in contrast to the dark, royal blue of the leather bounding the book. It took him a few moments to recognize the dots as a constellation.
“I said it doesn’t matter what I want. I’m just doing what I need to do.”
Harry listened to Malfoy as he spoke, his heart reeling. He didn’t expect him to be so open and honest to him. He also didn’t expect that his roommate had been so observant to find out something had been bothering him. Even Hermione and Ron didn’t pick it up.
. Harry was too preoccupied with ruining his kitchen to notice it was already the time for Draco to come for dinner and his birthday celebration. Well, originally. No food was ready and there would only be a lot of explaining to be done if Draco saw this mess, and he would, because there was no way Harry could Vanish everything in time—
With a grateful smile, Harry nodded to Gita and took Draco’s hand, leading him to the back of the small crowd already forming in the area. Some of the villagers started moving to sit in a half circle surrounding a side of the big bonfire and Harry pulled Draco through them to a little mound just a few metres away from everyone. It was a perfect place where both of them could perfectly see the ritual and the retreating sun while still having a bit of privacy for themselves away from the crowd.
Narcissa was unhappy enough that they refused to do the pureblood wedding rituals. Surprisingly, it was Draco who was more strongly against the idea. He firmly stated he wanted to make the ceremony as simple as possible, saying the entire marriage was just an excuse to go on an elaborately planned long vacation in Europe anyway.
Harry, practically unable to move from his sitting position, recoiled slightly at the outburst. Draco didn’t throw crude words lightly. This was his way to indicate how badly Harry had fucked up this time.
“Perfect… you’re so perfect, Harry.”
With a shake, Harry pulled himself out of his stupid thought. Or maybe Malfoy just had a secret Warming Charm that made him immune to ridiculously low temperature conditions.
Harry turned to find Malfoy approaching, a worried expression on his face.
All the defensiveness in him evaporated as the words stunned him. “What?”
“I prepared myself before, okay? Now get on to it,” Harry huffed, too aroused to even feel embarrassed for admitting that he planned exactly this all along.
Returning the hug, Draco wondered how he could ever forget what a safe haven once felt like.
They were quiet for what felt like hours for Harry, then Draco started talking in a low voice. “I… I don’t feel sad, not really. It’s really complicated.” He stopped. “I don’t want to sound insensitive, I mean… you lost your own father long ago—”
and what was happening between them. To wonder and to question.
Draco remembered when Harry told him to try that with his own child one day. And Draco finally did it.
“Well…” Potter looked down uncertainly. “Friends tell each other jokes.”
“Come for me,” Harry whispered.
He made sure to catch the grey eyes before engulfing Draco’s cock in his mouth.
“I said it’s okay, Pot—”
“He even told me how you passionately reenacted the Let It Go scene, you know.”
Harry didn’t answer immediately. He hummed as though thinking about the question, and Draco could feel the vibration from his chest. Waiting for the reply, Draco shifted in Harry’s arm to watch the last streak of scarlet slowly leaving the sky.
Forming this bond to connect their magical cores wasn’t an easy task. Draco remembered the years of sleepless nights he spent researching the ancient spells to make a magical bond through blood relation. It took so long that Scorpius was almost four years old at the time Draco managed to build a powerful, invisible bridge between them.
Draco absently thought how it should have scared him how he could instantly understand Harry’s vague question, how he could almost read his mind when they snuggled close like this. “I don’t know, sixth year? Fifth? Maybe even before that, but I only fully realized it after the whole Voldemort business escalated,” he answered, his tone was surprisingly light like it never before when he spoke about the war.
together, up in the hill when the sun was starting to lean west. He sat exactly where he remembered he and Harry were back then—behind the crowd with a perfect view of the performers. It was almost eerie to be up here all alone.
Draco shivered from the way Harry called his name, how it dripped with openness and vulnerability. He didn’t understand. When Harry didn’t kick him away the first time Draco approached him, this was not what he imagined the Savior would do. Harry only wanted an escape, and he took him in, so wasn’t he supposed to take advantage of him? Of a piteous Death Eater who was willing to kneel and do anything he wanted?
Harry laughed harder, making his whole body shake in his playful mirth. “Well, blame yourself. You signed up for it.”
Harry found it in himself to laugh incredulously. Trust Malfoy to turn all polite and businesslike after giving him the most mind-blowing fuck he ever had. “What shall we do to pass time then?”
Unlike the rest of the village Draco had seen so far, the gazebo changed a lot. It was wider now, seemingly able to fit over thirty children comfortably. Maybe Gita’s class had expanded in the years, Draco mused. And they repainted it too, as the gazebo now looked almost brighter in rich maroon. On the empty ground next to it, stood two goalposts like the ones in a soccer field that Draco knew weren’t there the last time he was here.
“Where’s Scorpius?” Draco asked on the top of her head.
They didn’t talk for a minute, Harry still staring at his delicate figure and Draco letting him. The night air blanketed them as the only noises they could hear were the whispers of magical creatures from deep inside the forest.
Unfortunately for him, Harry wasn’t quite finished. “Especially after I quit the Aurors… I’m so out of shape, Draco, this is not even funny. How can I be out of shape when I'm just forty? I’m supposed to live until 150,” he whined, grabbing Draco’s arm for emphasis about how
“What kind of Warming Charm do you use?” he asked back, dodging his question.
Grinspoon’s speech went on and on and Harry considered a few ways to get away before he hexed the man’s balls off. Just as Harry thought the man was done spouting bullshit, Grinspoon started bringing his “unfortunate childhood” into his lecture and Harry was one breath away from losing his cool when someone appeared beside him.
As Harry flipped the pages further, the frown on his face grew deeper. “Why did you only write the bad things in those years? That couldn’t be the only things that happened to you,” Harry said eventually, looking up from the journal on his lap.
“Yeah. From Hermione.”
“Uh,” Harry replied eloquently, fingers raised to touch his tingling lips. “What?”
Potter had the audacity to look taken aback by Draco’s words. “I… I didn’t mean to bother you, Malfoy,” he said quietly.
Gita furrowed her brows in thought. “It’s like… a Side-Along Apparition but you don’t join the Apparition. Like sending your kids to the place they want to go and pick them up back to home.”
"Well," Draco gingerly sat down to join him. "I went undercover as a muggle when I was in the US. A girl said my hair reminds her of Jeffree Star. When I asked her who that was, she only said he's a beauty guru." Draco explained with a shrug. "She gave me an impression that I should've known him, though. Is he famous?"
Amid the overwhelming sensation, Draco felt Harry pull his hand and place it on his heaving chest, right on the tan skin above Harry’s sternum. With a dazed shock, Draco realized what Harry was trying to do.
“It doesn’t matter,” Draco said at last.
Malfoy caught his eyes and raised his eyebrows. Harry flushed and looked away.
Draco turned to Molly while keeping his hand on Harry's arm. “Thank you so much, Molly, but maybe I should take over from here?” he said politely with a small smile. “I think I can catch him if he falls again.”
Harry didn’t expect Malfoy to be the first who broke into a loud cackle, but Malfoy suddenly let out a disbelieving noise and started roaring with laughter. The whole class soon followed, but Harry could only focus on Malfoy’s unrestrained laugh. It wasn’t a sweet, soft laugh like the one he witnessed in the Owlery, but it was just as good. Malfoy’s open expression of joy was beyond stunning that Harry could almost forget the bushy beard still growing on his face.
That made sense. Potter’s only reason to ask him to take a Muggle plane was just that registering for international Portkey would raise questions from people at home. Draco knew that Potter himself took a flight to get here a couple of weeks earlier, and he was still wondering what kind of excuse he came up with that his family let him go.
“I’m pretty sure it’s more than just your hair, Draco,” Gita said conversationally. “And she did brag to her friends after that night, so there would probably be more of those little fans in my class later.”
He soon discovered that his Slytherin part was never needed in the first place. The disaster he was anticipating never came.
. Right after he told Draco he was too old for… what? To be alive? Maybe his tendency to act dramatically did rub off on his husband, after all. “Then look at me,” he continued. “I don’t, um, I don’t age like a wine like you have.”
“So it’s useless,” Malfoy stated flatly.
Harry’s answer was late by a beat. “After the war, I guess. I couldn’t think of anything else before that,” he said. “But the fact that it was
“Harry James Potter!”
“But—but you can’t—”
“Hogwarts.”
Harry’s tone was so carefully off-hand that Draco wanted to snort a laugh. It was as though Harry was so intent to remind him that everything that was happening at the moment was merely temporary. Like he didn’t want Draco to be attached. Like he needed Draco to remember that this was supposed to be their farewell.
When Draco lifted his head from the journal on his lap, he saw the sun almost completely retreat to the horizon, leaving a deep scarlet hue in the sky. He didn’t realize he was crying until a drop of his tears fell on the page and he had to wipe it with his shaking hand before it could smudge the writing Harry left for him. Harry’s feelings—poured into words so raw and sincere that Draco found it hard to breathe.
As a blush rose high on Malfoy’s cheeks, he cleared his throat. “As I was saying, Pans, I’ll head out to our class first,” he said, almost too quickly to articulate each word properly.
Malfoy showed him his left wrist. A thick, soft-looking wristband was on it. The colour was dark emerald green and the way it contrasted with his pale skin was stunning. Harry didn’t fail to notice how it snugly fitted Malfoy’s slender wrist.
It was a classic. And it was for a reason. It worked every single time.
“What?” Harry sat up.
Hermione hummed. “We are all finally grown up.”
“Well, it’s a toy,” he said. “You slap it and it becomes a bracelet.”
. his mind slowed down.
And he wrote Draco’s name in his will.
“Not only that, it also enhances its wearability. It could hardly be appropriate for anyone to walk around with a piece of plastic on their wrist, right?” he explained with an odd air of pride. “The bracelet has a thin piece of metal wrapped inside the plastic, it was not an easy task to recreate it without one. To make fabric as soft as velvet turn stiff with a simple pull and back to soft with a slap. It’s even harder to make sure it remains like that permanently.” He demonstrated slapping and pulling the velvet a couple more times.
Eventually, Malfoy seemed to realise he wouldn’t be able to escape Harry at the moment and sighed, visibly defeated. He turned his attention to Slughorn who was writing the instructions for Hair Removal Potion on the blackboard and prepared his own ingredients, pointedly pretending that Harry was not hovering a mere foot away from him.
“It hurts… Malfoy, please,” Harry didn’t waste his time to beg. “
Draco barely had time to straighten himself from the little tumble of his Apparition landing when he felt Harry’s hands cradling his face. He let out a little gasp when he felt those rough fingers gently hold him, creeping slowly to settle on the nape of his neck. He looked up to meet the burning green eyes, as fiery as they could get even in the darkness of the unlit porch of their small cottage.
“No, we don’t,” Harry answered, his tone was an odd mixture of regret and a hint of relief. “Shall we make the best of it?”
The moment Malfoy’s cold hand touched his throbbing cock, Harry was barely aware of his loud wailing. Everything felt like too much but not enough at the same time. Malfoy’s touch was amazing, the efficiency of every fast stroke helped the pleasure to mount in Harry’s belly. But it wasn’t what Harry needed.
Grinning, Harry pretended to be busy setting up his cauldron and ingredients for today’s potion, ignoring the dirty look Malfoy threw at him. This was a bit low of him, but hey, it worked, right? In his peripheral vision, Harry could see Hermione and Ron frowning from their table across the room, but he decided to ignore that as well. He had a mission to carry out.
On the center of the room was a big bed with a snitch-patterned duvet, and a tuft of platinum blond hair was poking from under it. Feeling his smile widened from the sight, Draco walked closer and climbed into the bed with his sleeping son.
“Ron,” Granger cut him with a hand on his thigh.
The way Harry moved his lips against Draco’s was like a whispered promise. Draco felt giddy, and thrilled, and just a tad scared with how intimate it was. He wanted it, he assured himself, he wanted it now. Future be damned.
Those grey eyes fluttered shut and Harry followed their lead.
The guests gasped at the humiliating accident before going silent. Harry, still a heap of limbs on the floor, was mortified beyond belief. His mind instinctively considered just Disapparating right then and there. Or maybe just Obliviating the entire room and dragging Draco to escape out of the country with him, preferably forever.
“She won’t.” Draco’s eyes widened.
Lucius Malfoy was currently rotting in his cell in Azkaban, serving his life sentence that probably wouldn’t last that long considering his condition now. Narcissa Malfoy, who fared a lot better than her husband because of her deed during the War, fled the country as soon as her house arrest was completed, not being able to bear the burden of Voldemort’s shadow all over her once happy home.
He chuckled, only a bit self deprecating, and smiled a little wider at her. “I’m sorry,” he said. “And thank you. So much.”
“It’s fine,” Draco replied, “the restoration is going well, though I need to work faster to get it done by the end of the year.” He felt Harry’s hand begin caressing his stomach. “I saw from the Prophet that you sold Grimmauld Place.”
But now, when he was under Draco, moaning his name, the man was just Harry.
Hermione elbowed him, her face disapproving. “Focus on your work, Harry,” she chided.
“Harry, my dear!” Molly exclaimed, her plump cheeks flush with excitement as she examined him thoroughly. “Look at you, such a handsome young man! Oh, Draco is so lucky to have you.” Her tone drifted to dreamy at the end.
“I survive like I always did,” Draco said solemnly. “But it’s not a rainy day now, and I rather wish to make this happiness last as long as possible.”
“Harry,” his lover said. That was the only word Harry uttered before he straddled Draco’s torso and devoured his waiting lips in hungry kisses.
While the vacation plan was partly true—he saw the ridiculously long itinerary he made that promised neither of them would ever be bored in that one month—Harry knew that Draco understood his reluctance in doing pureblood rituals and his extreme discomfort in being the center of attention. He even restrained Pansy from organizing the most extravagant wedding party ever held in the entire Wizarding World for them and persuaded her to make it modest and intimate instead.
And now, thousands miles away from the land they were born, the number of Draco’s unanswered questions only grew. He voiced none of them, though, knowing Harry wouldn’t shed light on them. He didn’t provide any explanation when he invited Draco to meet him and he seemed to want to keep it that way.
“Ajawera,” Draco repeated the foreign name slowly. “It’s a beautiful place.”
Another growl erupted from Harry, this time dripping with desire. His hand on Draco’s hip tightened.
Malfoy looked up from his seat with his usual confused frown. He nodded warily.
As the days passed, Draco’s spirit remained low. He still spent most of his time with the Golden Trio, but often his mind was noticeably absent. He helped Harry study and engaged in academic discussion with Hermione like he did before, but something was unmistakably missing. Even Ron started to be really worried once Draco was beaten in one of their chess games and just offered him a weak smile in his defeat.
from a seventh year?” Harry asked, head twisting to look over his shoulder. “You really are dangerous to be around those minors. What a big bad alpha.”
wouldn’t let me go. Did you expect me to push you away when you’re in that much pain?”
“Tell her it was just his genetics,” Harry chimed in after swallowing another mouthful of his meal. Eyeing the rapidly disappearing food on Harry’s plate, Draco wondered if Harry was just that hungry or that he really liked the local cuisines.
And, of course, he remembered how gentle Malfoy was, how calm and collected the alpha was as he helped Harry go through his unusually painful heat. But most importantly, Harry remembered Malfoy's words.
They stayed like that for a long time as Harry mapped the planes of Draco’s hand in his. Silence engulfed them both until Draco turned his palm and tugged at his hand softly. “Will you…,” he half muttered. “Will you come here, please?”
“He stopped contacting any of us a few months after he left the country,” Granger replied.
And whether he could turn that frown upside down or not.
, okay?”
Parkinson waved her toast idly at him. “Yes, taken by surprise that your terrible jokes could get even worse every day,” she said nonchalantly, her tone the epitome of boredom.
“And what do you want for now?”
The fingers stopped. “What?”
Draco looked up to find a teenage girl walking carefully toward him. She was quite short, but her skinny figure made her look taller than she actually was. Upon catching Draco’s eyes, the girl gave him a tentative smile. Something about that expression felt so familiar to Draco.
“Good morning, Scorpius.” Draco landed a peck on the crown of Scorpius’s head. “Ready for breakfast?”
Draco let out a long sigh, leaning against a windowsill in a deserted hallway. He knew perfectly well that Eighth year wouldn’t be a walk in the park—or just another happy year where he could do anything he pleased and threaten to report anyone who displeased him to his father—but at times like this he was just so tired.
“Malfoy—”
Draco didn't ask where she heard that. Maybe the entire transportation department in the ministry was alerted by the sudden and strange long-distance Portkey. Maybe everyone knew he was gone for a while and had returned at last. Maybe Draco should be worried too.
He stood up to look at the mess he made in his kitchen. The explosion was massive, almost too massive to be coming from an average-sized baking pan. The batter was splattered everywhere. It reached the farthest corner of his kitchen, some even stuck on the ceiling.
"If you cut even half of your self-deprecating thoughts, maybe you'd see why I chose to stay over and over again," she said, her tone light but Draco could sense the seriousness beneath it. "Now go and wake Scorpius up for breakfast. You're always the worst when you haven't talked to him."
Malfoy clearly didn’t expect the compliment. He flushed a little—a pretty pink shade, Harry thought absently—and curved a pleased smile. “Thank you, Granger.”
But Draco wasn’t done pushing his husband’s buttons. He gulped, trying to aim for another teasing smirk, hiding his growing arousal.
more—he quickened his pace, fucking him in fast and steady strokes. Soon, Harry found himself desperately trying to push back to meet every thrust and have it deeper.
“But… she can’t be older than seven. She doesn’t even have a wand!” Draco muttered in disbelief.
He also remembered the first time he found out it was possible in the first place. He remembered the bright, sunny place where every parent was strongly linked with their children in a way Draco had not expected before.
“I got the jinx sorted out, but I still can’t make it stay attached for long enough while keeping the jinx functioning.”
Harry knew he was being earnest when he asked Malfoy to be his friend. At the beginning, his little quest was fueled solely by his curiosity to hear that melodious laugh from Malfoy. Without him realizing, his reasons grew along the way. The more he pestered Malfoy, the more Harry saw how much he had changed—and not entirely for the better. Yes, he was no longer a snobbish git like he used to be, which was nice, but he was also too quiet to be the Malfoy he remembered. And Harry didn’t like it for some reason. He didn’t like how lonely Malfoy looked lately, how tired, how defeated he was most of the time.
Harry hummed and scooted closer, his hand didn’t cease the gentle movement. “Still,” he whispered. “But I think it was for the best.”
“Good morning,” Draco replied, matching his tone, then added after a beat, “Draco.”
He didn’t expect that.
The more time he spent with Malfoy, the more he noticed many things about the blond—things that
The thing was, most Slytherins from his year didn’t return to take their N.E.W.T.s while Malfoy had to return as a part of his probation after the War. He didn’t really have other students to hang out with, so he spent most of his time silently studying in a corner of the library or at his desk in their room. He was barely seen in the Great Hall and usually the first one storming out after every class.
Certainly not expecting that, Draco felt his cheeks heat up. He could hear Harry snicker quietly next to him. “Why does her idea of a prince look like me?” Draco questioned, incredulous.
“Nonsense. You’re the rightful owner of it.”
Hermione’s cheeks flushed with anger. “You forgot? Harry, are you even trying?”
Arching a brow, Harry reached out to take the journal and Draco let him flip over the pages. Most of them were still empty, Draco barely filled half of his journal in the seven years it had been in his possession. Draco tilted his head as Harry started from the first page, watching his breath hitched just slightly.
And Draco had inserted himself into the grand plan and ruined everything. The fact that he got hurt in the end was completely his fault, wasn’t it? So why did Harry apologize to him? If anything, Draco was the one to blame.
Those green eyes were now flashing like they did last night, various emotions battling to come up to the surface at once. Before Draco could dwell on any of them, heat dominated the glint in Harry’s eyes, gradually dilating his pupils. From the sight alone, Draco could almost hear the gears in Harry’s head replaying the images of last night, could almost see himself from Harry’s eyes, writhing with pleasure beneath him.
Malfoy gave him another skeptical look before relenting and taking the spot by Harry’s side. “Here, let me help you walk,” he said, circling his arm around Harry’s waist to support him.
But, even twenty years ago, Draco wouldn’t be able to find it in himself to deny that he wanted that, ridiculous or not. Initially, he didn’t think it would ever happen in his lifetime. But then, after singlehandedly restoring his name and reputation in the wizarding world, he wondered if perhaps nothing was so out of reach after all. So, he went where his feelings led him, and to his bewilderment, Harry met him in the middle.
He knew Draco secretly liked his pureblood traditions. He also liked having grand parties with his friends and family. But for Harry, he compromised. And Harry couldn’t be more grateful.
He had no destination to reach, just letting his feet bring him wherever they pleased at that moment, and he’d soon found himself climbing the spiraling stairs to the top of the West Tower. Before he could step into the Owlery, though, he realized that he wasn’t the only one having a sleepless night.
“You said this is our farewell,” Draco said slowly.
“I can tell you what I want now,” Harry said, willing his voice to stay even despite his racing heart. He met Malfoy’s eyes with as much confidence as he could muster. “I want you.”
A tiny girl, barely reaching Draco’s hips, pointed out to his head excitedly. Draco didn’t know where she came from. He was sitting alone on the porch of Gita’s house, waiting for Harry so they could leave and return to their cottage for the night together, and this little girl just came out of nowhere. He was sure he was completely alone before.
Harry took his hand, trying to look casual and fighting the blush that crept up his neck when their skin touched. Malfoy gingerly held it and slapped the long parchment on his wrist. As the paper curled, he let go of his hand and Harry pushed the urge to let it linger.
In the years to come, Draco would remember this as the moment he started falling in love with the best friend he ever had in life.
Harry flinched violently and Draco took his finger away.
The pleasure built up, mounting and mounting, but it never reached the peak. Harry moaned in frustration, his body aflame. “I can’t… Malfoy, I need you to fuck me.”
Despite the tasty feast, Malfoy was frowning. Scowling, really, at his breakfast. The furrow between his brows was obvious even for Harry who had been silently observing him from across the Great Hall. Beside the blonde, Parkinson was chattering, likely to herself, with some enthusiastic hand gestures that Malfoy only responded to with occasional absent-minded nods. Harry wondered what Malfoy was thinking; what gave him such a long face so early in the morning.
deserve to deal with him knowing,” she said, smirking smugly, imagining Harry getting properly punished for stupid actions. That hadn’t happened since Hogwarts, and even then it was scarce.
Harry was speechless. His finger traced the neat, cursive handwriting on the piece of parchment-turned-slap-bracelet. For a moment, he let his mind imagine the picture of little Malfoy and Narcissa, sitting together and giving each other good wishes in fancy words. Something tugged in his heart, insistent and just a tad bit painful.
But at the end, he knew this wouldn’t last. He couldn’t sneak into Harry’s place every other week forever. Dreading falling into the hell pit like one he was in after the war, Draco started building his life the only way he knew: being the cold-hearted, impassive Malfoy he was raised to be. It was his duty, after all.
Malfoy hummed. “And that’s why you’re… feeling left behind?”
Harry chuckled at Draco’s failed attempt to strip him and mercifully undressed himself for him instead. But, before Draco could let his hands roam all over that deliciously tanned skin, Harry moved to sit between Draco’s thighs, spreading them open.
“Is this it?” Harry said eventually.
Another frown was back on Potter’s face. “All is fair in love and war,” he said slowly. “Is it a Muggle saying?”
“Is it broken?”
“Do you think your marriage will restore your family name?”
Shaking his head, Draco started to walk toward the door. “No, I’m going now. Please say my apology to Meme and Gita for not saying goodbye to them in person.” Draco’s hand hovered on the door knob for a second before he made his mind. One last time, he thought. Turning to face Harry, Draco let himself stare at those green eyes, deciphering the storm of emotions in them. From this distance, Draco could fool himself and said that he still saw that one mysterious feeling reflected in those emerald orbs. Love, he once convinced himself.
A soft touch of a hand on his arm pulled Draco from his mind with a violent jerk. He turned his face to Astoria, slipping into their drawing room without him noticing. Her clear brown eyes, casting the usual kind gleam she always possessed, were staring intently at him with obvious worry.
Draco woke up to a pair of bright green eyes staring at him.
Harry didn’t seem to expect that, his eyes widened in puzzlement. “What do you mean?” He frowned. “You’ll be married in a few weeks.”
The last time he followed his heart right after the war, it led him to Harry. This time, he hoped by following what he desired he would get to keep what he had together.
Still amused, Harry reached out to pat his shoulder before walking away, leading their investigation with a pleased smile on his face. Malfoy was right, they had to finish sweeping the entire area before dark and the temperature dropped even lower.
He said it in such a solemn voice that the three of them left gawking at him. Several beats later, Ron snorted a choked laugh. “Can you imagine McGonagall holding up her middle finger? It would be a
Instead of answering, Draco circled his arms around Harry’s neck to pull him closer, deepening the kiss. Soon, Harry’s thrusts started to falter as he went deeper and faster, indicating he was getting close. He sneaked his hand between their bodies to reach for Draco’s cock, jerking him off in sync with his hips.
Taking a deep inhale, Harry let Malfoy’s scent encourage him and guide his next words. “That night, you said you wouldn’t fuck me since I couldn’t tell you want I truly wanted. I can now.”
It was clear that Weasley didn’t like her bold words. “How can you—”
Draco felt Harry clenched around him and he groaned from the pleasure, collapsing to bury his face in the crook of Harry’s shoulder. “Harry.”
Malfoy let out a low laugh and Harry hated himself for liking the sound more than he appropriately should. It was so posh that it strangely sounded almost melodious. “It is indeed a fascinating little thing.”
From the way his gaze softened, Draco could see that Harry understood.
“What?” Harry choked. “How did you know…?”
“Jumping from the third floor is dramatic, safely Portkeying across the globe is not.”
“Why would I
Harry frowned. “Are you in trouble?”
Draco threw him an irritated look. “I said,” he gritted breathlessly, “talk less.”
Harry hummed and rested his cheek on the blond head. “Did you really come all the way back from South Korea just to yell at me?”
“What the fuck, Potter?” Malfoy hissed, earning him a glare from Slughorn that effectively shut him up.
What the fuck just happened?
When Malfoy finally turned his head to Harry after a pause, he didn’t look angry anymore. His grey eyes only seemed tired. “It’s okay, really. It’s—it’s whatever, okay?  You don’t have to apologize, but I would truly appreciate it if you stop doing that from now on.”
as an old lady looking for a cat?”
Maybe it was in his blood. Did the Malfoys originate from the Arctic? This one certainly looked like he belonged in the eternal winter. The color of his hair was so light it was almost matching the pure whiteness of the snow around them. Hell, it’s not just his hair, everything about Malfoy was icily pale. His eyes were a shade of grey Harry never saw in anyone else, and his skin was so fair it almost seemed translucent under bright light. And now he was wearing all grey attire as though he was intentionally trying to blend in.
careful from now on. Constant vigilance, I promise.”
“I’ll show you what this old body can do to you,” he half-whispered and half-growled, making Draco shivered with want.
“Close your eyes.”
” every man around the bonfire shouted in unison, answering the incantation.
“Of course!” Draco blurted out. “That girl… she seemed to Disapparate at will. How does that even work?”
Draco Malfoy was a morning person.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut and took a deep inhale of breath. He looked like he was about to explode and Harry couldn’t blame him, he had been colossally stupid today.
“Okay, it might hurt a little. But it wasn’t that bad.”
It could have been funny, if only Malfoy’s scent, suddenly flooding Harry’s senses, didn’t feel like a punch to Harry’s gut. He doubled over in pain, biting his lip to muffle a cry from the violent blow. In the next seconds, he felt the temperature of his body rise quickly.
“You’d love the wizarding community here,” Potter piped up suddenly.
“By intense persuasion, you mean you terrified some poor Korean wizard in charge of the Portkeys into giving you one, thoroughly scaring them in the process?”
By the way Harry’s eyes caught his, Draco could feel the desire slowly building in his husband. He smirked.
A couple minutes later, Hermione popped up to announce the start of the ceremony and enthusiastically dragged Ron out, her pastel dress flowing in her chirpy steps.
The officiant started the ceremony by thanking all guests for attending and making a speech about the sacred bond that was a marriage, but Harry just naturally tuned him out. He had his focus fully on the stunning man in front of him, holding his gaze.
Side-Along Apparition when you didn’t even Apparate along the person you send from one location to another? He felt dizzy from just thinking about how that magic was supposed to work.
Harry gazed at the blond, his chest filled with warmth and affection. The odd way Draco Malfoy showed that he cared about his friends.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry groaned, lowering his body onto his elbows to capture Draco’s lips in a kiss without ceasing the thrusts of his hips. “How are you so perfect?”
Draco sat on the sofa in front of her. "What's in the news?" he asked his wife.
“How am I supposed to know?” Draco tried so hard to keep his exasperation at bay. “And is it a joke? Because I honestly can’t tell. But don’t you think it’s too early for a war-themed joke right now, Potter?”
He would have despised his destiny more than he always had. He would have considered the love he had for Harry as a punishment.
Turning to him, Draco asked, “for what?”
He stared back at Potter with defiance. “Considering the fact that you’re the only one contributing to the joke sharing concept of this friendship, what do you
Harry continued to fuck him throughout, helping him ride out his orgasm. Before Draco could let his body go limp, he felt Harry shudder almost violently as he reached his own climax.
“That’s different.”
“It is nice,” Malfoy grinned. “But it’s not just a wristband, you see.” His right hand reached out and pulled on the wristband. The fabric smoothly gave in from the touch and instantly strengthened into a long, rigid piece of velvet.
And Harry had left him dubiously after that.
help you? Potter, you literally saved my life. From literal death. And you’ve been nice to me this year when you really didn’t have to. I owe you too much, some tutoring wouldn’t put a dent in it.”
“Are you hurt, Potter?” Malfoy tentatively asked.
Draco seemed to appreciate the gesture and burrowed further into his side. He continued on. “Then the Dark Lord came into the picture. The Death Eaters business started to take off in full force. Everything changed in the Manor—in my family—including Father,” he said. “The changes had been gradual, but constant. I tried to ignore it for so long. Until one day, I woke up and realised I couldn’t find a trace of my hero in Lucius Malfoy.”
“Alice,” Potter said, grinning wider. He seemed to think of something and added, “now you’re supposed to say
Draco gazed at the girl—Maya—again.She was still staring at him with wonder and the corners of his lips twitched upward. This was ridiculous, but he couldn’t deny the whole thing was very endearing. And quite flattering. “Hi, Maya,” he regarded her gently, offering his hand. “I’m Draco.”
you.” Harry knew he sounded delirious, but he couldn’t care less. Inhaling Malfoy’s scent but not having those fingers touching him was torture. “It hurts. Make it stop, Malfoy. Please, touch me.
“The preparation?”
“I think I am.”
Suddenly, Gita pulled him into a hug, standing on her tiptoes to tuck her face on the crook of Draco’s neck. “Welcome back, Draco,” she whispered.
Draco frowned. “I can carry that,” he said as he tried to snatch his suitcase back.
Malfoy frowned uncertainly. Letting his hand trail down, his breath hitched in surprise. “
“Didn’t he have you and the others here as his friends?”
The first week sharing a room with Malfoy was almost painfully awkward. Malfoy seemed almost scared to be in Harry’s company and Harry didn’t know how to approach the change in his so-called arch nemesis. Both tried to ignore each other while at the same time being extremely aware of the other’s presence. It felt like both of them were not sure to coexist together, how to share the same air without breathing down each other's necks.
Still, Draco was no longer that lost boy, fresh from the war, battered and numb. In the years he tried doing the only thing he thought he had to do, restoring the Malfoy family name, his reasons to hold on had grown, slowly but surely. From the precious companionship he built together with his wife to their brilliant son, a young Malfoy who Draco was sure would grow into a man thousands of times better than his father.
“You’re rubbish at Potions, what makes you think you can bake?” Draco’s laugh had died down a bit, but his grey eyes were still glinting in disbelieving mirth.
Malfoy smiled, genuine and warm. “Still, even if you haven’t decided on what you want to do now, I would encourage you to try harder on your studying. I reckon it wouldn’t be fun having to retake your N.E.W.T.s after leaving Hogwarts.”
That afternoon, Harry ended up giving the toy to Malfoy, because how could he not when Malfoy looked
“It doesn’t make sense.” Draco shook his head. “Apparating alone is dangerous enough. It requires so much focus that a little slip can cause a life-threatening Splinching. You’re not supposed to Apparate with a toddler, and you’re telling me people here just… fling their children with Apparition-like magic?”
“I don’t think you have,” Draco stated eventually.
“Of course. I’m a big boy now.” Draco could feel Scorpius puff his chest proudly and he didn’t know if he should laugh or cry. Salazar, to have a son this amazing after all he had done.
taking me out on a date? It seems like the traditional roles don’t really apply to us.”
Harry was an enigma. A riddle without a clue. A puzzle to which pieces were all hidden.
The mention of his son was enough to bright Draco up. After kissing Astoria’s cheek, he left to make his way to Scorpius’s room, a little smile forming on his face. For the last six years of his post-war life, this morning routine had always been his favorite.
“No, I don’t,” he replied. “I feel… a little disappointed and relieved at the same time, it’s confusing. I think there is this small part in me that still… hoped that things will get better for my family. That Father would get to his senses, be redeemed, and maybe become my hero again. But now he is gone and it’s… that part of me can’t help but feel disappointed as that naive dream would never come true.” He inhaled. “And another part of me is just feeling relieved because it’s like… it’s over, you know? Father is gone, now I can mourn the man he was long ago without any empty hope that he would ever return.”
It was not that Draco thought Potter was not capable of doing that, because he
“Hey, Malfoy,” he greeted, trying to sound pleasant. Then, as though an afterthought, he added, “good morning.”
Draco didn’t try to decipher him. He hadn’t, for a long time. He couldn’t remember the last time he hoped to make sense of this man, but it had been too long. He knew if Harry had any intention to share, he would. But it had been almost five years since they started this arrangement, their secret meetings, and Harry never left a crack open for Draco to see what’s inside.
“Malfoy…”
“Why would you want us to be friends?” Draco asked carefully at the end.
The air shifted again. Harry could still sense the danger in it, but there was something else now. Something sweet and inviting. Like a seductive lure. Harry’s mouth watered as his body gradually worked its reaction down south. His breathing quickened from the expectation. Malfoy
“No. Many of them don’t even speak Indonesian, which is the official language of their country. Most talk in their local language here.”
“Draco,” she said warningly. She never liked it when Draco was belittling himself, and it usually didn’t happen a lot. He was a kind of person who would hate himself in silence, and put up a wall. But times like this tended to make his wall crumble.
“Bison,” Potter said, his voice full of excitement.
Harry’s breath hitched as the pale hand touched his but Malfoy didn’t seem to be fazed. He held up the long parchment and slapped it lightly on his wrist. The thin sheet curled gently like a peculiar kind of bracelet.
After tripling his layers of Warming Charm, Harry regarded him, “it’s barely 1 p.m.”
“Er, Malfoy?” Harry called. “What are you doing?”
“You said you wanted to stargaze,” Draco suddenly said without turning his head.
Silence fell between them. Harry stared at the ceiling, trying to think about Hermione’s words, but he felt Malfoy’s gaze on him and it made him self-conscious.
Right now, Draco and Harry were lounging on Gita’s porch with her, enjoying the last hour of the morning go by while waiting for Meme to return from the field. Gita didn’t comment when Harry shifted on his bench to sit closer to Draco. She didn’t even give them a second glance when Draco responded by putting his hand casually on Harry’s thigh. Maybe nothing was out of the ordinary, after all. Draco wasn’t sure if he should feel disappointed about it or not. It didn’t feel right that something as fundamental to him as the shift in his relationship with Harry was barely a significant change for others.
We did, Draco thought.
“Farewell, Potter.”
It took Harry another moment why Draco came to that conclusion.
Gita pursed her lips in question for a moment before giving them a knowing look. She nodded with a smile. “Sure. Be careful of the bugs!” she called and Apparated away.
“Are you even listening to me, Harry?” Hermione half shrieked.
Harry arced his eyebrow. "What?"
“You look beautiful this evening.”
Moaning louder, Harry pushed his hips to meet Malfoy’s teasing fingers. When the first digit penetrated his entrance without any resistance, Harry desperately clenched his ass. He was hungry for more and Malfoy just wasn’t fast enough.
“Harry?” Neville called again, worried.
He looked around him. It was early afternoon and the sun was blazing so hot above him that he had to stay under the shadow of a big lime tree in Gita’s garden, where she was brewing her Potion. He didn’t hate it, though. He couldn’t. There was something so special from being nearer to the sun. Maybe it was just the foreign feeling of it, the temperature and humidity that he didn’t usually have back in England, that made every simple action he did here feel very liberating. Or maybe it was the clear air, or the smiling faces of strangers, or the unfamiliar yet delicious food Meme had been feeding him.
“What’s the big deal? You’re just gonna walk down the aisle, say your vow, and then the ceremony is basically over. You’ll be ready to be off Britain with the ferret face for the rest of your life. Or at least for as long as your honeymoon lasts,” Ron grinned and wiggled his eyebrows. “A full month across Europe, Harry! That’s just so very Malfoy of him.”
“Draco, over here!”
“You know what they say, people talk more as they get older.”
The trip back to Ajawera was mostly uneventful. Draco felt like he was navigating himself from the Manor in Wiltshire all the way to this small village so far away almost full in autopilot. It didn’t feel real—his return to this place—until Draco saw the first sight of vast rice fields under the bright sunlight and people tending to them with delicate magic. After his lung inhaled a greedy gulp of clean air that was dense with ancient magic, the fact that Draco was here again finally dawned upon him. Finding that everything was still very familiar for him, he made his way through the village’s narrow paths.
They really should have shared a changing room just so Harry could mentally prepare himself.
That seemed to pique his interest. “What is it?”
Draco looked up to meet his eyes. “Forget those people! I lost my opportunity to get my hands on the rarest ginger that could be very crucial for my new Potions breakthrough!” He said with a frown. “Oh, the things I do for you!”
A wide smile, a little shift closer, and the newly fallen darkness. Draco felt Harry’s arm around his shoulders. “You’re right,” Harry whispered next to his ear, voice so quiet Draco wouldn’t hear him if they didn’t press up together. “That’s why we’re here, right? To just be us in the present.”
That night, for the first time after almost five years of hungry and deprived fucks, countless nights of not knowing where they stood with each other, after leaving the puzzle unsolved for too long, Harry made love to Draco.
Malfoy didn’t turn to him again but Harry could hear he muttered to himself “that little traitor.” Harry grinned to himself.
But this time Draco didn’t head to the Malfoys’ vault that was once full of gold. After one nauseating ride on a minecart with a goblin who couldn’t look more bored if he tried, Draco and Engel stood in front of Vault 687 of Gringotts Wizarding Bank.
Running his hand on his face, Draco moved away from Harry. “I’ll be the one dealing with that. I don’t think people would care anyway. And if somehow they do, I’ll come up with some excuses. You don’t have to worry, your secret plan will be safe.”
. Draco almost scoffed at the unnecessary politeness. As if Draco would ever deny him anything. He thrusted forward, aiming deeper this time. Harry responded by moaning his name again and again, clutching desperately at him.
Snickering to himself, Harry shook his head. Malfoy was just too easy sometimes.
Harry’s eyes fluttered open. He blinked, once, twice, adjusting to the light in the room, until he focused on Draco’s face. He let out a quiet groan and rolled to bury his face on a pillow. “Don’t remind me of that,” he rasped in a sleep-heavy voice.
“Why are you here alone, Malfoy?” he asked almost too cheerfully.
Harry was right, of course. Being physically attracted to your friend didn’t have to mean anything. As long as he could keep everything strictly platonic as it should.
Harry was not nearly finished with his restless rant when the door to his changing room was barged open, showing Molly Weasley in a beautiful emerald green dress. She scanned Harry’s slumping figure and rushed to pull him into a standing position.
He wouldn’t say it’s easy, but he imagined it would be a lot harder to swallow it back then when his feelings were still so raw and almost unwelcomed. Now, knowing he had his family waiting for him and his old friends with him in Ajawera, Draco could slowly accept the fact that Harry was gone. He knew his world would keep on turning regardless, and that somehow made it easier to see beyond all the painful things and acknowledge the good time they had together.
“Nothing,” Malfoy slapped the velvet one more time and lowered his arms. “No purpose, it’s just a fascinating toy.”
Gringotts was as he remembered from the last time he came to see his family’s vault get emptied. The brick walls were as cold and impenetrable, the goblins were as creepy with the unbearable air of businesslike unfriendliness.
“Let me bring it,” Harry said, looking inside the pot with a grin. “Will there be some kind of offerings during the ritual?”
“Did you see him today? He braided his hair and it’s
“Sometimes I wonder what it is that makes you attract danger to yourself like no one else. I thought it’d be over after you stopped being an Auror, but who am I kidding? You’re Harry fucking Potter, after all,” he let out a high pitched laugh, almost hysterical. With a shake of his head, Draco calmed down again. “You’ll no doubt be the death of me, Potter, Merlin only knows.”
“You’re not giving me that face, Potter! Look at me!” Draco moved to grab his arm, his touch surprisingly gentle, a great contrast from his hysterically angry shrieks. “Let’s pretend I don’t know you were planning to keep this from me, I’m angry enough as it is.”
It turned out that Draco didn’t need to worry at all. The answer was in front of him the moment he opened the first crate on the stack.
“Draco.”
“Nothing,” he replied one beat too fast, quickly folding the letter and shoving it in his drawer.
“Wow,” Draco breathed in wonder. He couldn’t imagine ever having a point in his life so low that he had to resort to serving Muggles. He didn’t think he would even consider it an option. But here he was, being introduced to a whole new world of hard paths where survival was the only thing that mattered. “Is that why you’re staying here?”
Reluctantly, Harry loosened his grip on Malfoy and the man swiftly moved back to properly sit on Harry’s bed; true to his words, he didn’t leave.
“Until when?” he asked instead.
“Any plans for this afternoon?” asked Gita suddenly. She was lying on her side, munching on a rice cracker as she idly levitate the last clean place to put it on a drying rack.
It was a little rusty key. Draco still remembered what that key would open.
He stared at the item in question with a frown. “It’s a slap bracelet.”
And the slap bracelet, as odd as it was, also became the foundation of his best friends’ acceptance for Malfoy. Harry didn’t know why it made him so happy.
“I, of all people, know that.,” Draco said distractedly, not really meaning to sound bitter.
A moment later, he warm mouth was instantly gone, leaving Draco’s cock throbbing on his stomach, unsatisfied. He groaned in frustration at the loss.
“Are you okay?” she asked softly.
“What?”
“Are you okay?” Scorpius asked, frowning a little. “You look tired.”
’ repeatedly. For a quick second, he felt a familiar warm buzz under his palm. Maybe it was Draco’s brain playing tricks on him, but it felt as though the residual of Harry’s magic that he left when he wrote in this journal was responding to Draco.
“Listen, I just want to apologize for what I said the other day,” Harry whispered, then added, “and these days, I guess.”
But their time was almost up. They were nearing the end of February and Draco had to be back to England soon, leaving Harry to discover more unknown magic on his own. They would have to go their separate ways, live different lives. One day in the future, they might forget that Draco was once Harry and Harry was once Draco.
Harry pulled him to stand closer to the water, enjoying the waves caressing their bare feet. The dark haired man stared silently at the crimson sun, his lips curved into a wistful smile. Draco felt Harry’s thumb stroking his palm softly.
With raised eyebrows, Neville turned to him again. “What are you talking about? Malfoy is a beta.”
“Well, yeah… I mean, no. I want to thank you, yes, but it’s not why I’m here.” Harry gulped when he saw Malfoy raise his brow in question. “I’m here to take you up on your offer.”
Draco stared at her, his heart filling with love and gratitude for his friend. "I still can't believe you stayed with me through all those songs."
“What? You got a
“How did you manage to get a Portkey with such short notice, anyway?”
To be fair, he would not be resorting to spelling his cake if not in pure desperation. He had been in his kitchen since midday, trying to bake a cake in a Muggle way. There had already been four failed cakes lying innocently on his counter, all of them in different shades of brown with the last one closer to black than anything else.
Quietly, Maya studied his expression and shifted closer to put her warm hand on Draco’s arm, her black eyes shining with concern. “You miss him, too, right?” she asked. “I also miss Harry. You’re not alone. You have everyone here.”
“I walked past him earlier in the hallway and let me tell you, he smelled so good. Like something citrusy, both sweet and very fresh.”
joke!”
“I’m sorry.”
would mean for them at the moment. They stared and stared, until one of them—Draco couldn’t be sure who—leaned into the little space left between them. It might be both at the same time, or one prompted by the other to meet in the middle, but it didn’t matter as soon as Draco felt the soft press of Harry’s lips on his.
The girl who braided his hair finished her careful work. She slung the freshly braided blond hair over Draco’s left shoulder and the other girls surrounding him audibly gasped in unison. Not a second later, the shrieking and squealing began again.
The gleam in Gita’s dark eyes was unreadable. "Did you read the journal?" she asked instead of answering.
Kneeling down to match Scorpius’ height, Draco took something from his robe pocket and handed it to his son. Scorpius took it with a little frown of puzzlement.
He thought about one life he let himself dream of, a long time ago. The dream that was cruelly crushed and dumped to the ground by someone he trusted with his everything. And now that someone was no longer here, in this world.
He resisted, though, opting to slowly walk towards Draco and sat on the edge of his bed, facing him. The grey eyes stared directly at his, the glint unreadable.
How could he not? With his glasses tucked safely on the bedside table, those emerald eyes bored intensely into Draco’s as he rocked in sync with his thrusts. His hands, large and rough, were surprisingly gentle as they caressed Draco’s side, traveling further and further until he cupped the round of Draco’s buttocks, urging him faster. He bared his neck, throwing his head back against a pillow, and moaned louder.
was dramatic.” He shook his pointy head again with a huff. “So what if you don’t know what you want to do after Hogwarts? You’re young, rich—fuck, you’re a
“I do care about you.”
He could tell Malfoy noticed him before he reached the end of the table where he was eating with Parkinson and a handful of other Eighth year Slytherins. The grey eyes caught his and they widened for a second before Malfoy turned to Parkinson next to him, speaking to her rapidly, one of his hands reaching for his bag.
Harry felt he was under a spell, dazedly following Malfoy’s silent instruction in addled steps, his eyes never leaving his smiling face. He couldn’t be sure if it was the diamond dust around him, or Malfoy cast a spell on himself, or maybe Harry’s eyes were playing tricks on him, but Malfoy's entire being was sparkling and glowing. The sight was so beautiful Harry felt dizzy.
,” she said in a whispered awe, scooting closer with apparent interest.
Instead, he smiled and brushed his hair again. “Rise and shine, Birthday Boy.”
It was too late to change plans, he had to make this work no matter what. He took a recipe book near him—half of the opened page was drenched in red batter—and Scourgified it a few times to make the words on it readable. He scrutinized all the steps of making Easy Homemade Red Velvet Cake and attempted to find where he did wrong. Or where he could sneak a few spells to make the result at least resemble his now very low expectation.
“Can we start walking again or you’re still not done regretting your stupid life choices?” Malfoy said impatiently, bringing him back to the present time. The question was evidently rhetorical as he set off without waiting for Harry’s answer.
“I’m not fucking you tonight, Potter. Not like this. Not when you can’t tell what you truly want,” Malfoy stated, his tone left no room for argument.
“Does she know you’re here?”
“Does our time have to be limited?”
as well, and exchanged some pleasantries before continuing their walk together in a bigger group. After about twenty minutes of hiking, Draco saw where the ritual would take place.
“Right.” Potter scratched his messy hair sheepishly, but he made no move to leave.
his problem was.
Harry dropped to his chair dramatically. “But!”
Suddenly, as though he didn’t just wake up a minute ago, Harry moved so fast as he practically attacked Draco, straddling his torso and keeping his husband pressed to their bed with his weight. “What’s the matter?” he said, frowning down at him. “Oh, nothing, really. I’m just getting
“Am I getting one, too?” he asked with a grin, half joking.
He looked up and offered his wife a small smile.
). When the video started, he became even more unbearably annoying, pausing every ten seconds to ask questions Harry couldn't answer.
He recalled when he met the Potions professor earlier in the teachers’ lounge this morning. Malfoy was sitting on one of the settees there, a cup of tea held between his long, slender fingers, and a stack of parchments in front of him. Harry came to the lounge before his class to grab extra ink, but as soon as he entered the room, Malfoy’s scent assaulted him in such a powerful way that it was a miracle Harry didn’t end up jumping on him. If Harry had to be honest, he barely escaped his predicament without embarrassing himself, like popping a very inappropriate boner in front of his colleague.
Harry was sure he once saw Molly using magic to bake something.
From where he was sitting, Malfoy watched her and furrowed his eyebrows. “Granger,” he called. “I have something for you.” He took his bag and rummaged in it. The slender hand came out with a long, thick sheet of paper. He tossed it to Hermione.
He glanced at the blond, his head being propped up on Harry’s lap while he silently read a bulky Aritmanchy book. He looked tired, faint shadows under his sharp eyes. Harry knew he hadn’t been eating properly since Lucius’s death—he’s the one who always dragged him to the Great Hall, after all, only to watch him listlessly moving his food around—and it started to show. Draco’s already pointy face looked even bonier with the gaunt impression he now had.
Harry had to laugh at that. "That you are right."
It was an impossible task. How could Harry relax when his whole body was aflame, wired from the tip of his toes to the last strand of his hair? But Malfoy hadn’t stopped growing as he continued to fuck into Harry. If Harry didn’t unwind the tension in his body, soon Malfoy would be too big to penetrate him. Exhaling slowly through his nose, Harry tried to loosen up.
Draco stopped to admire the beauty of Gita and Meme’s matching dresses. The pair of mother and daughter had vibrant fabrics wrapped around their bodies, the metallic red and splashes of reflective gold twinkled a bit under the afternoon sun, making beautiful knee-length dresses and leaving their shoulders bare. On top of their heads, the two women had a golden, crown-like headpiece each. For a moment, Draco could be convinced that Gita and Meme came straight from the most exotic folklore he ever heard.
“It’s nice, isn’t it, this place?” Harry said wistfully, leaning against the wide tree trunk.
“However long you want this to be.”
“But he isn’t a prat anymore, is he?” Ron arched his brow.
Amidst his outrage, Harry felt a gentle pressure on his wrists. Draco’s fingers, nimble and delicate, were caressing them, the motion light and relaxing. “It’s okay,” he murmured quietly. “We can’t do anything about it but that’s okay. I wouldn’t say it’s fair but when anything ever was? Lucius was dead, whether he deserved it or not. Mother is safe in her house arrest. And I… I can defend myself, I know I can. It’s okay, really.” Draco offered him a weak smile. “It is what it is, Harry. I didn’t mean to make you worried. Just… I had been feeling very safe and happy here with you, Hermione, and Ron, so the realisation of what would happen after this took me a little off guard. It will be okay, I’m sure.”
“It’s a slap bracelet!” Harry breathed in amazement and laughed.
With a sigh, Draco leaned into her touch. “How could I forget one of the only blessings I have left in this world, Astoria?”
“It’s…,” he mumbled, a bit speechless. “That’s not right.”
The fervent gaze Draco gave him was burning, unyielding. He looked at Harry in blatant wonder. Emotions flickered fast in his eyes and Harry failed to identify any of them as his mind was filled with how grey his eyes were, how bright they shone in the moonlight.
The day had barely started but Draco already felt tiredness down to his bones. He couldn’t get any sleep last night, tossing and turning on his bed. Weasley’s accusing look wouldn’t leave his mind. That look was sobering, to say the least. It brought up memories, and made what was supposed to be a forgotten dream resurface as hidden reality.
Harry tried to focus on his own potion but something still didn’t feel right. He pretended to follow Slughorn’s instructions on the board as a nagging thought came to his mind. It couldn’t just end like this. As he let his potion simmer, Harry said softly, “I just want you to know that I really wasn’t making fun of you.”
Draco entangled his fingers in Harry’s curls. “I don’t remember the last time I was this happy,” he replied quietly. “Long ago, maybe. Long enough for me to forget.”
was obvious from his tone. “We’re in Bali, we have to visit a beach, Draco.”
Shaking his head, Potter laughed harder. “But it didn’t, did it?”
“Who who?”
That didn’t sound like a bad idea. Ajawera had been an amazing place so far. Thinking there were more heaven-like places like this scattered on Earth, waiting to be discovered, each with its own secrets and magic, thrilled Draco. But of course, that was not his path to take.
“Actually, I rather like how you begged last time,” Malfoy stated calmly, fingers not stopping their slow thrust.
It was almost funny how Harry kept his distance while Draco put his belongings in the trunk. Harry stood by the tiny window of their cottage, watching Draco pack his things with his uncertain gaze. He seemed like he was about to offer help but wasn’t sure how to approach Draco. It could have been amusing, Draco would have laughed if he didn’t feel so tired.
For a second, Draco felt a throb deep in his sternum. His magical core. It throbbed painfully once, twice, before he felt his entire being stilled. Everything stopped, leaving nothing but numbness. He looked up to meet Harry’s eyes.
“To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?” he said, stepping closer to Harry. His tone was so perfectly neutral that Harry almost missed the sarcasm in it.
“We can’t,” Harry said, his voice pained. “This is supposed to be a temporary thing.”
“Okay. I’ll help with lunch after I’m done here,” said Draco.
At the end, Draco could do nothing but give Harry everything. Every little thing he asked, and far beyond that. Draco would give Harry everything he had, everything that he was. And he never asked for anything in return. Why would he? Draco couldn’t tell if he desired anything else at this point, anything other than this man. And Harry had offered him more than enough. Often, what Harry gave him was too much to even make sense.
“Fuck, Draco, we need to get inside,” he gritted.
Draco knew the deal he had with Weasley and Granger. He would go into Potter’s vault, claim all his personal belongings, and send them straight to the remaining two of the Golden Trio. But deep down, he knew he wouldn’t just do it like that.
A little moment to digest the information stretched into two days, but Draco still didn’t know how he should feel about Harry’s first letter. He locked himself in the little cottage, ignoring Gita’s patronus that occasionally came to check on him, too busy to untangle the mess of thoughts flooding his brain. Coming to term to the unexpected turn of reality was not an easy feat.
The witch continued to chant her spell over and over, and the men replied to her every time with the same shout, making an odd melody with even rhythms.
After a few breaths, Draco started to feel it. Deep inside his chest, right in the middle of his breastbone, a warm vibration reverberated. He inhaled deeper. A tiny pulse was felt in Scorpius’s chest, under his hand.
It still didn’t prepare him for what Draco wanted to say. “Can I kiss you?”
The bonfire exploded in green sparks, the vibrant color blended with the last hue of red in the sky. Suddenly, the air shifted again, this time the change wasn’t gradual. For Draco, it felt like he was under water and someone pulled him up to the surface right before he would suffocate. The air cleared and the magic stilled. Draco felt Harry’s sternum stop vibrating under his palm at the same time as his, leaving a warm feeling that spread to his chest.
But, like Malfoy said, it was still the Arctic and the temperature was biting cold, especially in the last days of winter like this. The last time Harry checked before setting off on the journey on foot, it was about minus eleven degrees, but it certainly felt like it had only gotten colder since then. If the temperature was this low on a clear, bright day, Harry didn’t want to imagine how cold it could be when the weather wasn’t as friendly.
Unable to help himself, Draco reached out an arm to brush a straying strand of dark hair from Harry’s face. He often gave in to the urge of touching his husband, just to make sure he was real and here with him. The sleeping man mumbled something unintelligible from the featherlike touch, shifting this and that way until he positioned himself closer to Draco, as though unconsciously demanded to be petted again.
Harry’s eyes narrowed. “Are you baiting me to change the subject?”
Harry refuses to take the blame, though, because they got along surprisingly well after recovering from the fact that both were only victims of an evil war none of them ever asked. Draco is still a snarky, sarcastic wanker, but an extremely interesting one at that. He's genuinely funny, intelligent, and always curious about things he doesn't know.
“I’m glad we can be friends, too. I know Hermione and Ron feel the same.”
“Just go get your blond prince, Harry. Bring back the old pratty-but-not-so-pratty-anymore Draco, please. I miss calling him ferret-face.”
At the end, Draco smiled. If it’s not now, then when? “Harry is it, then.”
“Harry James Potter.” His voice was clear and sure. “People say that I’m not easy to love, but luckily you’re the expert of doing the impossible.” He paused to chuckle to himself. “I also used to think that I’d never fall in love, but of course you, Potter, would be the one who eagerly proved me wrong.” His feign annoyance in his voice was so theatrical and so
“Brilliant! Let’s try again. Knock, knock.”
The vibration of Harry’s magic core matched Draco’s. It felt like two heartbeats in sync.
. Everyone will be separated into two groups, one will play and one will be the opponent,” Gita explained. She held up the flat pebble. “We call this
Draco let out a noise of disbelief. “You randomly woke up with a mid-life crisis, almost broke me during a mind-blowing morning sex, and then suddenly turned into a complete sap?” he said incredulously. “It's way too early to deal with all of this.”
When it was over, Draco didn’t rush to swim back to the surface. Who would have known drowning could be so blissful? Harry lazily cast a quick Scourgify on their sticky bodies before slumping over Draco, lying his head on Draco’s still erratic heart.
Harry shook his head. “No, I don’t blame you for that. In fact, I need to thank you for helping me that night. It was… it was very kind of you.”
fitting. He couldn’t be sure if Harry chose this place with such a name on purpose, going as far as finding a small island right on the equator line just to find an escape that had a mockingly suitable name. Either way, Draco loved this village already.
“And you are right, I do have everything I want, it seems,” Draco continued, his meaningful gaze holding Harry’s emerald eyes.
Why shouldn’t he? They could be whatever they wanted, for now. Draco wanted them to be lovers, so let that burning gaze mean love to him.
that another row of laughter erupted from the guests. “But falling for each other we did, because what are we if not a pair of rebels? We were done living for other people. We had enough of that. Now is time for us. Together. For as long as we’ll have each other.” He stared intensely into Harry’s eyes, baring his soul. “We both have the craziest, messiest lives anyone could ever imagine, and it’s likely won’t be any easier from here. It’s you and me after all.” He grinned slightly. “But we have each other now, and I vow to walk with you through our imperfect lives, today, tomorrow, and until we can’t walk any further.”
But the sound of Malfoy’s laugh wouldn’t leave his mind. It echoed in his brain for days, a contrast from the solemn and impassive tone he heard Malfoy used to address the professors in their classes. Harry was aching to hear the beautiful sound again.
“What?” He looked up at him.
With that, Hermione stomped out of the room. Ron shared a look with Harry and Malfoy and moved to run after his girlfriend.
“You better be,” Hermione snapped. “By the way, Draco is on his way here.”
“I don’t know, just out? The sky is clear, we might be able to see the stars,”
"It's goo-gle, Draco, and yes, I guess we can," Harry said and left to find his laptop because Draco would not shut up until his unending curiosity is satisfied.
Under the darkening sky, Harry’s eyes shone brighter as he stared straight into Draco’s. “I don’t think I ever saw you that happy and carefree before,” he whispered. “You’re absolutely stunning.”
No, it was definitely Potter who had lost it, Draco was sure.
“You do know I still have two years of community service after Hogwarts,” Draco said with raised eyebrows, his voice flat.
“Well, huge emphasis on trying, apparently,” Harry replied sheepishly. He raised his hand to scratch the back of his head as a habit, and found that it was also covered in red velvet batter. He grimaced and withdrew his hand behind his back. “Happy birthday?”
Draco was about to plead for help from Gita when another girl, older than the rest—maybe around 10, approached the loud crowd and stood behind Draco. Without words, she took Draco’s poor hair from the little grabbing hands, combed it with her bony fingers, and began skillfully braiding it into one big braid. The others stopped shrieking instantly, watching her work Draco’s hair carefully, enraptured. The two girls who previously fought to sit on his lap decided that there would be enough space for them to share as they settled.
“I don’t understand, so that thing transforms from a wristband to… whatever it is, and so what? What do you do with a stiff piece of fabric?” Ron interrupted.
If only Malfoy would let him. The Potions professor hadn’t been avoiding him once again, this time even more relentlessly, making sure he wouldn’t cross paths with Harry despite how much Harry tried to corner him.
Draco closed the book with a soft thud, his head reeling and chest tightening. He stared at the leather cover of his journal, absently following the golden vines on it as he slowly tried to let Potter’s—Harry’s—words sink in.
This time, Draco felt invincible. He wanted to stop borrowing time for them to be together. Right here, right now, Draco was ready to steal it all, to own it, to let them have
It was apparently a wrong thing to say. Draco became even angrier. “That’s exactly why it is a painfully obvious trap, you fucking brainless scarhead! Did they not teach you in Auror traning about people using Polyjuice Potion and pretending to be someone else to trick fools like you?!” He took more steadying breaths. “Hermione said there was a bomb about to go off in said building. Now, pray tell, why did you decide to jump out of the window instead of Apparating like a normal wizard in dire situations? They clearly said the building wasn’t even warded.”
“So you changed the material so it doesn’t hurt when you slap it?” Harry asked.
Malfoy shoved her shoulder lightly as Harry let out a breath of relief. Malfoy couldn’t be taken like
“Mother told me. An Auror on the shift in Azkaban did it, apparently for some kind of revenge. They fired the Auror, obviously, for professional misconduct, but the Ministry is hiding the details of the death, saying to the public Lucius died in an accident. They have the reputation of Auror force to keep after all,” he said in such an impassive tone so perfect that Harry knew he was faking it.
“You should try that, when you have your own child in the future.”
In his defense, it was the tiny Slytherin part in him that begged for some form of self-preservation in the face of an enemy.
But now he was ready to look past that. It was true; he loved Harry, in an unexplainable way that felt both scary and right at the same time. And Harry loved him back.
Unexpectedly, Malfoy let out a loud laugh, his head was thrown back in mirth. Harry didn’t think he had ever heard him laugh like that before—a real laugh, not a sneer. He would have appreciated it better if only he didn’t have a more pressing matter at hand.
Harry stared at Malfoy’s grey eyes, pale like everything else in him. His gaze was unyielding, almost defiant. In them, Harry found something he didn’t expect. Warmth. Assurance. Comfort. Harry longed for more.
“I’ve seen something like that a few times now but it still amazes me every time,” Harry said.
. And powerful.
Harry shook his head and took it from him. “Here, give me your hand.” As soon as the words left his mouth, Harry realised how weird it sounded and tried to backtrack. “Nevermind, let me show you.”
“And you’ll chase the bad dream away for me?”
“Alice fair in love and war.”
Breathless now, Draco gave himself a moment to look around, only to find he was the only player left in the court, all his team members were already out. One player and one
He didn’t even brace himself for the blow. He knew he would feel nothing either way.
"I never say you didn't."
Harry felt Malfoy’s long hair caressing his skin as the man leaned against his back, his breaths tickling him in short huffs of hot air. “You smell so good, Potter, do you know that?”
But somehow, another part of him wanted to drag Malfoy out of the room for an entirely different reason. As soon as that strong scent hit him, Harry felt something in him stir, something so primal and fierce that he didn’t even know was in him before. Something that yearned for that scent to engulf him, dominate him, and just be the only thing he could sense.
Harry did not appreciate it at all, and would never think about it again, much less take it into any sort of consideration. He wondered how Draco could say all those things with barely a hint of sarcasm in his tone. Maybe some people were just born a natural at lying, but Draco had lots of practice in the past.
Another unsuccessful attempt and Draco heard the lock banged the door with a loud thud. Worried that Harry would resort to forcefully break the lock with his magic, Draco pulled back and took the key from him, efficiently unlocking it with a quick twist.
“Oh yeah?” Draco raised his eyebrows. “And why is that?”
Closing his eyes, Draco put his palm flat on his journal. He remembered doing the same gesture on Harry’s chest and feeling his magical core beat with his own. Draco controlled his breaths, picturing the bonfire, the old witch and her incantations, and the men chanting ‘
“That’s not fair,” Harry said, but he was grinning like a loon.
“Well,” Harry shrugged, “as she said, it’s fitting.”
Draco obeyed without question, tugging a string in Harry’s heart from the trust. Gently, Harry let go of his left hand he had been holding and outstretched the arm. He took the gift out and paused for a few seconds, stealing glances at Draco while the blond had his eyes shut.
“Of course I can,” he said. “It’s not like I have anything else I want to do after this. If they put you in the Ministry, maybe I can find a job there myself. But I’ll stay with you. I won’t let you be out there alone.”
Harry nodded mutely and Draco pulled himself down with him.
Humming in thought, Harry leaned back against the broad chest behind him. “Do you mind if I ask you a question?”
He gripped the long, pale hand. “Let’s go,” he said breathlessly.
And right now, being in the same room as Malfoy, his arousal felt tenfold stronger than any heat he had had before. Harry inhaled deeply, trying to slow down his racing heart. It was a wrong move. Malfoy’s scent was engulfing him. He bit back a whimper.
The third-years and bellow joined the Muggle-borns. Granger seemed to think in such an intense way that Draco he almost saw the gears in her head spin. Suddenly her eyes widened.
Harry snorted before walking towards the door, running a hand through his hair one last time before opening it, revealing the git himself.
Blaise said nothing but raised an eyebrow at her, “Alright fine, I’ll apologize after dinner but if this works you can’t stop me from saying I told you so.”
Harry thought.
The drive was awkwardly silent apart from Harry drumming his fingers against his lap, while looking out the window.
If only Sirius didn’t forget to set his alarm before bed.
"Will you just get in?"
After the picnic, Malfoy took him to a new candy shop that had opened up in the neighborhood, and bought an extensive amount of sweets for the both of them to share. Malfoy then drove them to his house,
When Draco jerked his head up to look over at Potter, Pansy noticed with delight that Draco’s face turned a lovely shade of pink. She couldn’t help but burst into laughter.
"You know that’s fine with me, I’m not a baby. I hope you enjoy yourselves." Harry smiled.
He was about to open the passenger door when Malfoy stepped in front of him. "Let me." He opened the door for Harry, who raised an eyebrow at him.
After about fifteen minutes, Harry had enough of the silence.
He throws the pillow at Remus before yelling, "I said the date is with Malfoy!"
Malfoy: Bring a jacket.
—————————————————————————————————————————
Just then, there was a knock on his bedroom door. As he turned on his back to sit up, Remus opened the door and smiled at Harry.
"Is that what’s been bothering you?" Remus questioned, "This sounds wonderful! You haven’t been on a date since that Cho girl, what could possibly be so wrong?"
She’s sick and tired of Draco moping over Potter day in and day out. The two boys made amends before the start of eighth year, even made a habit of studying together in the eighth year common room every other day. She thought this would cease Draco’s constant babble of ‘Potter this, Potter that’— that she had grown accustomed to over the many years of friendship. She even thought this would cause him to finally relax and focus on his studies without being in a strop over the Gryffindor. But truth be told, Draco was like a moth to a flame when it came to Potter.
