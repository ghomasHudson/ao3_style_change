in the future. He completely idolizes the man.” Harry’s eyebrows furrowed. “Although I’m not really sure if Cousin That even has hands at all, come to think of it.” Harry smiled and leaned against a spare shelf. “We haven’t seen him in a while. It's time for another Malfoy
Harry bounded up to them, inspecting them. “Oh! Your Cannibalistic Carnations are especially fresh,” he exclaimed, eyes wide and eager. He watched lovingly as their voracious jaws unhinged and teeth bared. Various mutilated petals and shredded leaves fell to the floor of the store. “Yeah, I’ll take all of them.” Harry looked very, very excited.
Fuck you, I think I might love you. Yet Father is dead now, and most of the time, I wish I were too.
,” Harry smirked. “If you know what I mean.” He exchanged a filthy, lecherous look with Draco that probably should have stayed private.
But before Harry could really start up again, the store owl returned from her trip to Hogwarts. She swooped down and perched herself onto the Quidditch supply shelf before them. Then she screeched at them— loud and piercing, the kind of noise that easily rips your eardrums in two.
Harry summoned one of the store owls, and attached a Pygmy Puff to her, giving her the destination. “But wait a moment before you go,” he told her. She nodded and watched him.
The thing is—nifflers can’t produce milk naturally. You have to forcibly, painfully draw it out of them. Hagrid has a tendency to spout creature facts when he’s had too much to drink.
What do I say to that? I grip my wine glass tight, and I imagine it breaking under the strain. Red would seep through the cracks, onto my hand, down my wrist. I should say something, I should. I open my mouth and—
“Perhaps,” I cough. “Hand me your shirt.” My throat feels like someone’s stripped it of its skin and poked little bloody holes all over it.
“Yes, sir,” Switzly said, sorrowful. She slowly, reluctantly reached up to grab the first few plants.
Tosser’s mouth is plump and smeared with red lippy, and he looks pretty goddamn smug, smiling with his crooked teeth out. The whites of his eyes glitter when I jolt the bus past some street lights as we near the slums of the city. To be honest with you, Potter, he’s not too hard on the eyes.
Then some new guy walks right in front of me, bark-laughing all loud and hearty with some girl beside him. He’s a tall, lanky bloke with orange hair, and the girl’s got bushy, curly hair. They look like Ron and ‘Mione but they’re not. I haven’t seen them since I left to start polyjuicing it up on the streets two years back.
It’s not my fault, really. It’s just how I am now, with all the Polyjuice. Fucks me up a bit if I’m being honest. It wears my insides down, I think. My spine breaks and reforms, my face morphs and changes into someone new, my limbs loosen while the juice works slow. It takes longer the more you use it. So I’ll tell him. Yeah, I’ll tell him.
With a smile, he set the watch on the table next to him and reached for the next present. He opened present after present to reveal a new set of robes from Bill, a candlestick that broke apart when it was lit, only to repair itself when the candle was blown out from George, a tiny dragon statue that curled around his hand before flying around the room from Charlie, a framed photo of the first wand ultrasound of Ron and Hermione's currently unborn child, Ginny and Mrs. Weasley gave him a brand new velvet cloak lined with silk on the inside and Percy and Penelope got him a book about Muggle televisions.
Harry immediately halted the movement of his hips, holding me completely still against him. He leaned forward and placed a gentle kiss on my lips. He slid his hands back to my arse cheeks, and with my legs still wrapped around his waist, Harry carried me to his bed and gently laid me down and then he came down so that he was laying on me.
I edged forward cautiously. Harry glanced at me over his shoulder before turning his attention back to the open air. As I approached him, my right hand began to cramp and sting, which I knew was his actual pain from where he had struck my father. I stepped up next to him and looked out over the open water that surrounded the prison.
“I had it specially made. The rubies will change color depending on your mood and the emerald will change color depending on my mood." He took the box from me and, with a wave of his hand, he levitated the box onto my nightstand.
“Oh, now you want to talk? Where were you when I wanted to talk? Where were you when I wanted to tell you about Blaise kissing me? Where were you when I was in St. Mungo's?" He yelled at me. He crushed out his cigarette, snapped his book closed, and stood up from his chair. He tossed the book to the floor and stormed over to the windows. I could see the tension across his shoulders. The way he was standing, his Dark Mark was facing me, exposed by his t-shirt.
“Can we put all this behind us? I don't want to lose my best friend over something like this," I said timidly.
“Oh, FUCK!! Fuck Draco!! I'm gonna cum!" He moaned. I glanced up at him; his face was flushed, his body was covered in sweat and he was trembling with the orgasm he was trying to hold back. I turned my attention back to what I doing. I licked the underside of his dick and sucked him to the back of my throat. He moaned, thrusting up as he released himself down my throat. I kept swallowing, feeling him soften in my hand.
Harry reveals his relationship with Draco to Ron and Hermione. Draco gets to meet Harry's goddaughter, Rose. Ron and Hermione see Draco's healing abilities.
We stepped off the stairs. Tom motioned for us to follow him as he stepped out from behind his desk. He led us down a hallway. He pushed open the door at the end. He bowed to us, then he turned and walked away, closing the door behind him.
“Well, I told him I was bringing my boyfriend, but I didn't say who. I thought it would be fun to see the look on his face."
I opened my eyes and stared at the green curtains around the bed, that were blurry without my glasses. I blinked, trying to figure out why the curtains were green instead of red. As I tried to shift on the bed, I felt a heavy weight against my right side. Turning my head, I glanced down. Draco was curled up against my side, his head resting on my shoulder. His right hand was laying across my stomach. I smiled, remembering how he had wanted me to stay after I had tucked him in bed. The curtains were opened slightly and a small shaft of early morning sunlight shown through and gave Draco's hair a golden shine.
“Yes, actually I do. Harry taught me how to use one and even bought me one not too long ago. But he hasn't returned any of my calls," I said reaching under my pillow and pulling out the dark green phone Harry had gotten me. I slid my thumb across the screen before holding it out to her.
“I honestly have no answer for you. I would suggest that you come with me and find out for yourself." He shrugged his shoulders, then stepped into a lift. He held the door open, waiting for me to decide if I would join him. I took a breath and stepped into the lift with him. He let the door close behind me.
I sat there with the blanket across my lap, listening to the sounds from the kitchen. I turned my gaze towards the swing. Rose was fast asleep, the swing still swaying back and forth. I closed my eyes, and made my body relax. I took a few deep breaths. Finally, I was able to remove the blanket from my lap.
Draco released my fingers and dropped his hand onto my thigh. He squeezed it, letting his fingers drift closer to my zipper. From where the waitress was standing, and based on how tall she was, I knew she could tell where Draco's hand was. He leaned forward and whispered loud enough for the waitress to hear, “Oh, I'll make it up to you after she goes to bed tonight."
I sat at the desk in Harry's room, watching him sleep. The comforter was completely on the floor and he was only covered by the sheet from his waist down.
“Where is the bathroom at?" I asked suddenly. Harry pointed out the hallway where the bathroom was located. I slid out of the booth and made my way to the men's room. I moved over to a urinal and emptied my bladder.
“Oh please, it was all over the Daily Prophet. You heard Percy in there; telling me all about the things you have done like I don't already know. Anyone who's grown up in the wizarding world knows exactly who you are."
He chuckled under his breath. “Harry, yes, we were enemies back then. But your not the type of wizard to willing use Dark Magic against a fellow human being. It's not in your nature," he said. He pressed another kiss to my lips before he rolled away to lay on his back next to me. He sat up and scooted up so his back rested against his pillows. He patted the pillows next to him. I smiled as I sat up and scooted back against his pillows.
“Yeah, you too Percy," I answered. Penelope now moved towards me. “Harry, this is my sister Jolene," she said, indicating the young woman talking to Mrs. Weasley.
“Oh, yeah. In fact, I have a practice with them next week to see if I'm good enough to join them. Can you imagine, me a professional Quidditch player." Her face was beaming.
By now, I was just as confused as he seemed to be. Charlie and Ginny seemed unfazed by what was going on. In fact, Charlie was twirling his wand in his hand.
“That's because I'm on probation and my magic has been blocked by the Ministry," I heard a voice say. I turned my head to find Carlos standing next to the door. He didn't look to pleased to see me or Hermione.
“Why'd you do it Blaise? What happened to all of us getting along like we have for the last couple hours?" I asked. I was genuinely confused.
I didn't favor her with a response. Instead, I picked up my drink and took a large swallow. I coughed slightly as the alcohol burned down my throat, stronger than before. Ron and Hermione stared at me, then glanced at each other and shook their heads. Theo and Pansy stared at me for a second, then turned back to watch Draco. I glared at any one of them that glanced at me. The game continued, with me giving them all the silent treatment. Draco seemed a little hurt that I had fallen silent, but I ignored the looks of confusion he kept sending me.
“Oh, God," I said. I spun around to face Charlie. I knelt on the floor in front of him and reached out my hand to his face to force him to look at me. His face had drained of color, making his blue eyes stand out. “Do you really have an STD?" I asked.
“You should know me. We shared a dorm since we were eleven." He said. His brown eyes stared at me. He ran a hand through his short black hair.
I fought back the wave of nausea that passed through me, as I remembered everything that had occurred. I swung my legs over the side of the bed and stood up. I wobbled slightly, my legs a little weak after spending most of the previous day in bed. I made my way to my en suite bathroom, grabbing my towel along the way.
“Not all of them were nightmares. But when I did have a nightmare about you, it was because of what happened in sixth year."
Harry pressed a quick kiss to my lips before he released me. “We should get going. Kingsley will be waiting for us. Just remember, Draco, we're in this together."
As the food landed on our plates and bowls, I leaned across the table. “Ginny, have you ever heard anything from the Holyhead Harpies yet?" I asked her.
We sat there for a while, Mother letting me cry on her shoulder. She rubbed my back gently. “Well, there's no use crying all night. I understand you're hurting right now, Draco, but I also know that you are a strong young man. I'm sure you and Harry will make up soon. Now, come on, how about you get yourself cleaned up and get to bed? Maybe you'll feel better in the morning."
That made Kingsley and the Aurors all smile. Kingsley motioned us forward and we surrounded the table. “Alright, everyone. On the count of three, reach out and touch the portkey. One, two, three," Kingsley cried. As one, we surged forward and pressed our fingers to the teapot. Again I felt like a hook had caught me behind my navel and pulled.
“Blaise, what is going on with you? Ever since you found out that Harry and I are involved with each other, you've been acting funny."
I glanced over my shoulder at Draco. After the initial glance when Charlie had come out of the bedroom, Draco had turned his attention back to the kitchen. He seemed to be staring at something on the table. I noticed an evil little smile on the corner of his mouth.
George stood up. Him and I moved over to Mrs. Weasley and the three of us turned towards the kitchen. We walked in silence for a moment. “Harry, dear, where did you get those pictures of Fred?" She asked.
He glanced over my shoulder. “Oh, looks like it's my turn, my friends are waving at me. But, Draco, let me know if you want me to teach you how to play pool later." With that, he winked and walked away.
“Be patient, Draco. I'm not going to let your fascination with my body stop me from giving you a real present," he said as he slid out from the tangled sheet. He strolled over to the walk-in wardrobe and disappeared inside of it.
“I figured that if you knew your older brother was dating your best friend, it would only upset you again. And I was kinda right," Charlie said simply.
Harry and Charlie head to the Burrow for Mr. Weasley's 60th birthday party. Charlie's unsuspecting brother, Percy, and his wife bring her sister along with hopes of setting her up with Harry. Charlie gets a little bit possessive over Harry and their secret comes out.
“Why, Charlie? What happened between us? I thought we were so happy. Where did things go so wrong with us?" I cried.
I raised my head and looked over at her. She was standing near the fountain with her hands on her hips. “And what's that supposed to mean?" I asked her.
(Personal note:) Having a little fun with this chapter. I'm gonna use an actual restaurant for their date. Now I don't know if there really is a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant in London, but I work at one and think it will be funny, because then I know what type of food they'll be eating. Hope you enjoy it.
I let out a heavy sigh. “Draco, did it every occur to you that he told you that because it's what you wanted to hear?"
“You two look good together, Draco. I'm glad that you finally have a chance to be happy." Mother said.
A small smile tugged on the corner of Harry's mouth. Without another word, the two of us stood up and made our way out of the stands. When we reached the ground, we walked back to the Manor in silence; neither of us wanted to apparate back, because neither of us seemed ready to say goodbye.
I turned my attention to the bookcase and I let my eyes travel over the titles of the books before me. I reached for one. “Oh, Hermione will be glad to get this back. I borrowed it shortly after Charlie and I got together. I bet she thinks I lost it," I chuckled as I passed the book to Draco.
I laid the box flat on my palm before I lifted the lid. Inside, was a beautiful silver dragon with rubies for eyes and it held a large emerald in its claws. The dragon hung from a thick silver chain. “Harry, this is beautiful," I said.
Hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for the next chapter. It'll be ready as soon as possible. If you have a suggestion of something you'd like to see in this story, please feel free to leave a comment. Thanks.
“Honestly, Harry, I don't know if Abraxas ever used the Cruciatus Curse on Lucius when he was growing up. Lucius didn't talk about his father much when he started courting me. Look, Harry, if this is bothering you, we can stop," Narcissa said.
Suddenly, Harry started to chuckle. “I know your awake, Draco. Your body is responding to my kisses," he said. Sure enough, I felt myself starting to get hard. With a sigh, I opened my eyes. I looked down at Harry as he pressed another kiss against the scar. He moved back up my body. When he laid across my chest, he pressed his lips to mine and kissed me deeply. My arms came up and I wrapped them around his neck.
I jumped at the unexpected voice, nearly slicing my thumb in the process. I carefully set the knife down on my work bench, the herbs I was getting ready to cut for the potion I was working on momentarily forgotten as I turned to face Hermione. “Yes?" I asked, slightly irritated by the interruption.
He worked slowly, sucking on the head of my dick, but not going further down. He pulled his mouth away and ran his tongue gently over just the head. I groaned, and tried to thrust into his mouth. His hands tightened on my hips, keeping them down. He took me back into his mouth, a little deeper than I was before, but he still didn't take me very far into his mouth. He bobbed his head up and down, lightly sucking me.
“I don't want to talk about it. Here in your arms, I really don't want to think of him." His arms tightened around me.
“Leave it to me," I said. I dropped his hand and swung my legs over the side of the bed. I stood up and stretched again. “ Is your fireplace over there connected to the Ministry's Floo Network?" I asked him over my shoulder.
“I've heard that Healers can feel the pain of those around them. Is it true?" He asked. I nodded. “That's how you knew I was in pain, wasn't it? It wasn't because I kept shifting."
Neville directed me through the kitchen and out the back door. When I stepped into the backyard, I felt magic surround me and I wasn't surprised to see a row of Leaping Toadstools to my right. It became obvious that the backyard was under magic to hide it from Neville and Luna's Muggle neighbors.
“Because people that want to end a relationship, don't cause themselves harm when the relationship is over." He snapped at me. I paused and raised my head to look at him.
Harry's temper must have spiked; the was a surge of magic through the room and a large crack appeared down the middle of the two-way mirror in front of us. We all jumped, but leaned forward to continue to pay attention. Harry was on his feet, his robes billowing around him and his hair standing up on end, as though a strong wind was blowing through the room.
“These shoes are just not fashionable," he grumbled, but he finally sat down and began to untie his laces.
As I started to pull away, I felt a hand close around my wrist. I shifted my gaze and discovered that Draco had slid his hand out from the sheet. I glanced towards his face to see his grey eyes were slightly opened. “Please stay," he whispered. His eyes closed and he let out a soft sigh. His fingers released my wrist as his hand dropped to the bed. I hesitated for a moment, before I waved my hand, stripping myself down to my boxers.
Harry pulled away and stared down at me. His green eyes looked much brighter without his glasses in front of them. “Good morning," he said. His voice was a little bit husky.
Pansy and Blaise stared at me for a moment, then Blaise slid onto the booth bench I had just vacated. Pansy hesitated a moment longer, then slid in next to him.
“Now I still need time to decide if I'm gonna take you up on your offer of staying at Malfoy Manor. I'm tempted, but I need to think about it," Harry said. He leaned down and kissed me.
He snuggled deeper under his blanket. I reached out and gently took his glasses off his face. I set them on his nightstand before I pulled the blanket up to his chin. I reached out to run my hand through his hair, but stopped myself. I sat there until his breathing deepened and I knew he was deeply asleep. I watched over him for a moment longer, making sure that the potion was working.
“You don't have to hide anything from us, Harry. I think Draco and I can accept you just the way you are," Mother said, picking up her knitting. He nodded again.
I felt the familiar tightness in my my groin, before I was spilling my seed between our bodies. Draco cried out and then I felt him shudder before he released himself deep inside me. He collapsed against me, both of us breathing heavily.
As Ron stepped up to take his turn, Draco sat in Ron's vacant chair next to me. “Are you sure you're alright?" He asked me.
“It's certainly not something I expected to happen today. I can't believe how easy it's become to be his friend and nothing else," I said, watching as Draco and Pansy kept in perfect rhythm during their dance. Ron and Theo stood amongst the crowd that had gathered around the two dancers, and I knew they were taking bets on which one would win.
“Percy said you needed a new watch. And I charmed it so it tells you if your running late or early."
Shawnna and I stepped away from the bed and moved over to where Ron and Hermione had perched on the sofa. Dean moved up and sat on the bed. Harry thrashed briefly under the chains. Dean leaned forward and placed his hands on either side of Harry's head. He closed his eyes as he concentrated.
Draco pressed little kisses against my neck. I laid against him until our breathing quieted down. With a small snap of my fingers, I summoned my wand. I used a few cleaning spells to clean our bodies. I gathered Draco into my arms. I lifted him from the bed and pulled down the comforter. I laid him down and crawled into bed next to him. He came into my arms and placed his head on my chest. I caught the edge of the sheet and pulled it over us.
“Well, my, my, my. Are my eyes playing tricks on me, or is that Harry Potter I see?" One of the guys said. The group chuckled. There were two brunettes, a red head, and a blonde with honey gold colored hair.
I moved farther into the room and sat down on the sofa. I pulled out my pack of cigarettes and my lighter. I calmly lit a cigarette and took a drag from it. I slowly exhaled the smoke from my throat before I spoke again. “Draco, what do you want from me? I've apologized for what happened at your party. What more can I do?"
“Oh, about two more blocks. See that building ahead of us with the yellow and black on the walls? That's where we're going," Harry said. He pointed out the building when I looked in that direction. Even from this distance, the building looked impressive. We finished walking in silence.
I knelt on the floor in front of him and began to remove his shoes. I placed his shoes on the floor. I stood back up and began to undo the buttons on his shirt. “I'll say this; it's a good thing that we're both gay and I've already seen you naked. Otherwise, me undressing you right now would be extremely awkward," I whispered as I undid the last button and pushed the shirt from his shoulders. It fell against the back of the chair Harry was sitting on. He chuckled softly.
Harry placed his hands on the table in front of him. “Listen, Lucius. If you remember correctly, you're the one who followed Voldemort and did his dirty work. Because of you, your only son lived in your shadow, trying his best to make you proud of him. Your arrogance almost got him killed, several times. Draco and the wizarding world are better off with you and your fellow Death Eaters locked up in here to rot."
“I needed the help of a Mind Healer. I don't know what he's suffering from, but it is clear to me that this is all in his head. These wounds aren't real," Shawnna said.
I glanced over my shoulder where Draco was still sitting at the end of the bar. Sure enough, I watched him as his head dropped to his chest, only for him to jerk back up. I sighed, knowing his body wasn't used to staying up this late. I glanced down at my watch.
“Yeah, I wanted to apologize for what Blaise did," I said, waving my hand towards the sink where his shirt still rested.
Draco cupped my cheek and pulled my head down. Our lips met. At first the kiss was gentle and sweet, like rain after a drought. Suddenly, it was like an electric current passed between us. My arms tightened around him and pulled him closer to me as I deepened the kiss. Our tongues danced against each other as we ground our hips together. Suddenly remembering that Hermione was in the room, I broke the kiss and looked around at her. She was looking at the floor, her cheeks red.
He propped himself up on his elbow and looked down at me. He reached out his hand and brushed my hair away from my face. “What's on your mind?" He asked.
I stood at the sink, washing my hands, when the door opened behind me. A young man, wearing the same uniform that all the other employees were wearing, stood behind me. “Are you the guy that is on a date with Harry?"
The four of us watched as Harry rounded the table and stood in front of my father. For the first time in my life, I saw a look of genuine fear flash across Father's face, as Harry towered over him. Harry raised his hand and slapped him hard across his face. Father's head snapped to the side with the force of Harry's blow. Father looked up at Harry, a red handprint on his cheek. Even as I watched, the handprint began to darken in color.
I knew he was referring to Ron. “You didn't see the look on his face. It was like I had betrayed him by not telling him about us. I wouldn't be surprised if he never wants to talk to me again," I said. I swallowed past the lump in my throat. Reaching out, I placed my tea on the coffee table. I fought back tears.
“Have you two gone mental? That was the worst thing I've been on all day," Pansy said harshly. She looked a little green. Hermione didn't seem fairing any better. I pressed a hand to my stomach, fighting back nausea.
“Leave him alone, 'Mione. It's not his fault that he's never had chili cheese fries before. So what if he overdid it? Let's not forget how you threw up a bit after we got off that rollercoaster before we even had lunch," Harry said, continuing to rub his hand across my shoulders.
“Well, if you see him, please let me know. We haven't seen him since Draco's birthday, and I'm worried," Hermione said. She glanced at a small door near the back of the store, then flicked her eyes back to Seamus.
An evil glint appeared in his green eyes. He raised his hand and pushed his glasses up his nose. “You know, I can help you stay still," he said. Before I could question him, he snapped his fingers. Almost at once, my arms were pulled above my head and my legs were pulled towards the end of the bed.
“Yeah, I think Steve and Randy can finish up. There's not much left to do anyway." Peter said. I glanced towards Steve and Randy to see them both nodding. I turned back to Peter.
“No Dray. Listen to the lyrics of my song. Better yet," he flicked his wand and a piece of parchment appeared and on it were the words to his song. “Read them. Then you should understand how I feel."
“My husband works for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. I'm sure I could find something to pin on you. Now, talk!" She snapped.
“Oh, good. That gives us plenty of time to finish our meals and show you to your room," Mother said.
Blaise raised his glass. “How about a toast? Here's to, uhh, to making friends with a former enemy." He nodded his head in Harry's direction. Pansy rolled her eyes, but clinked her glass against his. Harry and I raised our glasses into the toast as well.
He dragged his green eyes open, looking at me with an unfocused gaze. I sat on his bed again, unstoppered the vial and handed to him. When the vial tipped in his hand, I took it back. He opened his mouth and tipped his head back. I poured the potion into his mouth slowly so he wouldn't choke on it. He swallowed, grimacing at the bitter taste.
I felt my stomach drop slightly. This had been our chance to talk to Harry and it was gone before we had even really had a chance. I let my ´Malfoy Mask' slip into place, keeping my face schooled in boredom and not betraying what I was really feeling inside. It was almost like a knife had been driven into my gut as I realized that I was not going to get the chance to see Harry.
“I'm a little more advanced than they are, but yeah like them," I said. “The vast majority of them still need to use their wands, or they need to team up with others to heal. I don't. I can do it on my own."
“I couldn't tell you the truth, because I knew it would upset you. I apparently love you too much, because it hurts me when you're upset."
“Charlie, we haven't had sex almost since your dad's birthday party. The few times I tried, you turned your back on me. How can you say that you love me when you turn your back to me?" I pointed out.
I let my eyes travel over his body and noticed the unnatural way his shirt clung to his chest. I waved my wand and vanished his shirt. There across his chest were four bleeding wounds like the scars that marked my chest. Again I ran my fingers over the wounds, but again, nothing happened. The wounds were still there, and there was no blood on my hand.
“Draco, last night was one of the best nights of my life. The only regret I have about it is that I'm in a relationship with someone, and that someone isn't you," he said. I turned back to him and watched as he stood up, and pulled up his jeans and fastened them.
“It just happened. There's no rhyme or reason as to why people start dating. Harry and I both admitted that we had feelings for each other and decided to act on them."
“Yes I do. The motorcycle belonged to Sirius. And Ron, you didn't see it outside, because I drove the Lamborghini."
Ron nodded. I climbed out of the car and shut the door. I turned around to face the house as Ron pulled away. I squared my shoulders, took a deep breath, then made my way slowly towards the door. It opened before I reached it, revealing Neville standing there.
“Glad you asked Theo. Harry and I decided that we're going to show you a fun day without magic. Muggles have fun all the time. They go to movies, amusement parks, arcades, and all kinds of things."
“Take me, Harry. Take me now," I cried out. I dropped my hand from his penis. Without a word, he removed his fingers from me. He pushed my legs further apart and I felt him position himself at my entrance. He began to push his way in slowly, giving my body time to adjust to his invasion. When he was fully inside me, he leaned forward and took my lips in a bruising kiss.
I pushed myself up on my elbows and looked down at him. His eyes were closed, but I couldn't tell if he was still sleeping. His short, red hair was mused where I had dragged my fingers through it during the night. The freckles spattered across his nose were barely visible anymore, but they were there nonetheless. There was a fresh burn on his skin, right in the spot where his neck connected with his shoulder. He was always coming home with burns and scratches from the dragons that he worked with, but it never seemed to bother him. I gently traced my fingers around the burn, then leaned down to press my lips against it.
“Thanks Hermione. I don't know why you're being nice to me, but I appreciate it," I said. I unfolded my legs and stood up, stretching out my muscles. When Hermione stood up, I wrapped her in my arms once more. “I don't know what I did to deserve your help."
“Absolutely not. I think that we should establish some ground rules though. Like, we only eat in the dining room on opposite sides of the table. We only hang out together if we're hanging out with Ron, Hermione, and any other friends of yours, or mine. No hand holding and definitely no kissing right now. And you sleep in this room and I'll sleep in mine. Does that sound agreeable to you?" I asked him.
“I'm going to pretend that you didn't just call Ron ´Weasel' again, not once but twice. I honestly can't wait for your birthday. I have something special in mind." With that, Harry picked his book back up.
“Well, Draco, it looks like I have you at my mercy," he said. With a wave of his hand, my pajama pants and my boxers were gone, leaving my completely exposed before him. His eyes traveled down my body hungrily; there was a predatory look in his emerald eyes. He leaned down and took me into his mouth. I moaned. His hands effectively kept my hips down as he worked his mouth slowly up and down my shaft. Harry sucked lightly around the head of my dick, before swallowing me down his throat. I moaned again and tugged on my bonds. They didn't budge.
“Wait a minute, we don't even like each other, and yet you want me to sit down at your table. Have you gone mental Potter?" I asked. I was confused as to why he was being nice to me.
“We can take things slow, but that doesn't mean we can't be together. Look, I'm not going to move back into the Manor just yet, but we can still go out on dates, and on the dates, we can actually get to know each other."
“I brought someone else to see you," he said as he let her go. Her eyes drifted past him to find me standing by the foot of her bed.
I pushed open the door to the Leaky Cauldron and was greeted by several heads turning in my direction. After seeing who had walked in, the patrons turned back to their drinks. I was pleased that I had rebuilt the Malfoy reputation after Father had gotten sent to prison. We had fallen from grace in the wizarding world because of our involvement with the Dark Lord. I had successfully managed to turn things around.
“Sure," he said. He followed me out of the building, where our conversation would be a little more private. I turned around to face him. “Is everything alright? You seem upset," he commented.
“Harry, how about you switch places with Bill? Let my two gay brothers sit next to each other and you sit by a nice woman," Percy said.
“I do recall clearly that I tried to talk you out of cheating on him anyway. You just couldn't resist the Malfoy charm," I said, putting a smug smile on my lips.
“You're pregnant Harry. And judging by the color when I did the spell, you're carrying a boy," Dean said calmly. Blood rushed through my head and my vision went black as I fainted.
“I can't really blame you either. I broke the rules first by kissing your cheek. I guess just being friends for now might be harder than we thought."
I slid my glass across the table. “Try it for yourself," I said. He looked at me like I had lost my mind. “I'm not trying to poison you, Potter. Just try it."
“Well, I would say it, but I don't really want to embarrass him in front of you. Now, if he won't tell you himself, then I will, because it might concern me and you as well."
She walked away and I opened my menu. Harry leaned across the table and pointed out where the drinks were listed on the menu. Suddenly, two glasses of water were placed on the table. I looked up. There was a young woman standing there, her name tag reading Joanna.
,” Draco smiled with dark, hooded eyes. “But first,”—Draco eyed Harry up and down—“All this talk of sleep reminds me of our first night in Jerusalem.” He trailed his hand along Harry’s arm. “Remember?”
“Brilliant, Switzly,” Harry said to her, and she ran off as fast as her tiny legs could go. (Which wasn’t very fast.)
“Wonderful!” Harry looked delighted, and also a tad pink in the face. (Draco’s hand had not-so-subtly crept beneath Harry’s elastic waistband). Draco’s lips twitched as he continued to squeeze and knead Harry’s arse.
Charlie shook his head vigorously, still not looking at me. I looked down at him for a moment, then I turned to face Draco. “Tell me what's going on," I said.
“Oh, Ron and Hermione just had a baby and they named me as her godfather. I just came to pay a visit," I answered.
I smiled as I stood up, my knees protesting slightly from kneeling on the floor in front of the fireplace for so long. I stood there without moving for a moment, letting the blood travel down my legs. I finally moved and made my way back to the bed. I slid in next to him and pulled the sheet over my lap. I waved my hand and the trays levitated into the air and drifted towards us. I laughed slightly when I saw the food; scrambled eggs, pancakes, bacon, toast, yogurt and fruit.
“Harry, it's honestly okay. I've dealt with his behavior since I was a child. Here, let me see your hand," I said.
With a sigh, I pulled out my wand and began to clean up. The first flick of my wand made the dishes rise from the table and scrape themselves into the trash bin. Then they drifted to the sink and stacked themselves neatly. Another flick of my wand and the sink turned on, water splashing on the dishes as the bottle of dish soap tipped over and squirted a little bit into the sink. I stepped over and picked up Charlie's chair. I pointed my wand at the wax on the table and it disappeared. The dishes were washing themselves, rattling gently as they clinked against each other.
The old forgotten scars across my chest ached with the memory of that day so long ago...I had been crying in a bathroom at Hogwarts, expressing to the female ghost by my side my fears about my father and about the task that Voldemort had given me. Harry had come in. He had been so determined that year to find out what I was up to. We had thrown curses at each other. He had hit me with one that had spilt my torso as easily as if someone had taken a knife to my skin.
on your left. You swallow audibly. “I’d treat him fucking right.” You look back at me and smile sadly. “Or we could leave; go to Sirius’ island together. Stay there.”
Harry reluctantly unhinged his jaw from Draco’s arm and looked at Switzly once more. “Right,” he said, wiping his mouth.
He was right. I think it’s because I had experienced so much roughness already. I prefer a simple, calm life. I get to have that with Draco.
“We have many more,” Draco smiled indulgently. “My personal favourite is the electrocution chair.” He turned to Harry. “It reminds me of our first date,
Switzly interrupted before they could start up again. “If sirs are finished, Switzly can take you to the registers for checkout.” She looked at them, hopeful.
I look at Tosser’s face through one of my mirrors. I can see him just barely. It’s dark out, and the lights in here are dim. That, and my eyes get foggier every day, but I can still drive alright.
Nothing at all, sir!” Switzly exclaimed, eyes darting back and forth. “Switzly will leave sirs alone to look at the mattresses now.” She rushed away, not daring to look back at them once.
Harry pressed himself back against the shelf, his limbs loose and eyes half-open and heavy as he smiled, teasing. “I…
“Yeah, that’s more my speciality,” Harry snickered. “Also, I have a special gift for you if your next Bludger lands in Smith’s breakfast cereal tomorrow morning.” He wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him in close. His hand slid down to cup Draco’s arse through his trousers.
“Please don’t,” Switzly whispered, not loud enough for them to hear. She rang them up as quickly as she could. Which was not very quick, given that she kept looking up at them every three seconds, wary and nervous—and for good reason.
” Your hand makes its way to my side and rests there, shivery in that way you get when you need another hit. “They said I could be a father, though.”
” Draco smiled. “I keep telling him that he needs to learn to play with his food before he eats it, so this will be a
They began to walk, but Draco paused before they could get too far. “Oh, one more matter, Switzly, I just remembered— do you happen to have any fresh Mandrake heads? The shrieking helps keep Harry awake at night.” Draco smiled as he ran his hand along Harry’s side. “Their dulcet tones fresh from the soil make our ears ring in the most
“Oh, so you won't be home tonight? I thought maybe we could hang out together. I can wait up for you to get back," I suggested, slightly hopeful. My eyes were glued to his tan chest and the slight patterning of dark hair across it, and I licked my lips slowly.
“The last thing they did was bring in a young boy who had a couple wand burns on his skin from the punishment his foster mother did to him. They said if I could help him, I'd have a place in the hospital."
Draco tried to pull his hand away, but I wasn't having it. I wrapped my fingers around his, holding his hand on top of the table. Ron stepped up to the table and glanced down at our joined hands. He stared for a few moments, then raised his head to meet my gaze. “You've got to be kidding me right now," he said.
“Now, Draco, it's nothing to be ashamed of. So what if you liked him? You can't help who you fall in love with." Draco's cheeks darkened.
“Draco, stop. Look, me breaking the kiss had nothing to do with my boyfriend. I wasn't even thinking of him."
“Draco, a real friend wouldn't ask him to be okay seeing the one he loves with others. A real friend wouldn't toss it in his face that he lost the best relationship I've ever seen him have," I said.
My gift was last and as he picked it up, a lump formed in my throat. I knew what was behind the wrapping paper. He glanced at me as he pulled the ribbon off. He looked back down at the package as he ripped open the wrapping paper. The black leather photo album fell into his lap. He picked it up and opened it. Without a word, he continued to flick through the pictures, occasionally letting out soft chuckles. When he reached the middle of the photo album, he stopped as tears filled his eyes. I knew what picture had made him stop. It was a picture of the family when we had gone to the Quidditch World Cup. Fred was in that picture.
Charlie groaned and buried his face in his hands. I took pity on him. “Draco, can you start taking my things to the Manor? I would like a moment to speak to Charlie," I said.
“Can I ask why you let me ride with you first?" I asked Harry about twenty minutes later when we were climbing into his car.
When my feet touched down in Kingsley's office, I actually managed to stay standing. Kingsley dismissed the Aurors. After they left, Kingsley slumped in his chair, head dropping down to his desk. “Oh this has been a long day."
“Not because of you, no. It's because of what he's done to you. I'm guessing that the wounds on his chest were something that he caused you?" Dean asked.
Draco apologizes to Harry for his self-centered behavior. A small argument takes place. Draco then comes back, two days later, after his interview at St. Mungo's, and the pair of them end up in bed. And Harry gets a surprise on his birthday.
“Remember what happened in sixth year?" She asked. Draco flinched and turned his back on the room. I swallowed hard, but didn't answer. She signed. “Harry, I'm talking about when he was in the hospital wing afterwards. I know you snuck out of the dormitory quite a bit to go see him."
He pulled it from his pocket, then swiped his thumb across it to answer the call. “Yes, dear?" He asked, after raising the phone to his ear.
I thought to myself. Suddenly, I wanted more than just oral sex with him. I wanted to make this a night to remember long after it was over. I wanted him inside me.
“You know what, if you two are so worried about Draco sitting with me, why don't you join us? I told him earlier that this table is big enough to hold four people," Harry said. I felt a little clench in my stomach when he used my name.
I thought. Without a word, he moved and sat down on the couch with me. He raised his wand and flames burst into existence in the fireplace.
“Oh please. He's a Malfoy. Malfoys don't do anything they don't want to do. That's a lesson I learned from his family a long time ago."
I reached out and grabbed his hands. I pulled him to his feet, dragging one of his arms around my shoulders as I slipped my arm around his waist. I half dragged him, half carried him over to his bed. As we approached it, Harry snapped his fingers and the blanket and sheets pulled themselves down. “Harry, don't use your magic right now. You'll exhaust yourself more," I scolded him.
We finished our breakfast in silence, with Harry occasionally rubbing my leg underneath the table. When we had eaten our fill, Mother summoned the house elves to start cleaning up and we rose from the table. I grabbed Harry's hand. Mother led us over to a massive staircase and began to climb.
“I think I actually can, if that's what you both want. Or I can at least get him to listen to you about what happened," she said.
She surprised me with her response. “If Percy wants to set you up with someone, he would have better luck with one of his older brothers."
“Actually, that's what started our fight; I accused him of cheating on me. I noticed there were a couple bruises that looked like hickeys on his neck, and I know they didn't come from me."
Draco laughed as we moved around the medi-witch and entered Narcissa's room. She was laying on a large bed, propped against the pillows. Her long blonde hair was twisted into a braid over her shoulder.
“Yes, Master Draco. Right away Master," she squeaked out. With another small pop, she was gone. I smiled as I went back into my room. Harry was still on the bed where I had left him, his glasses and his wand laying on top of my nightstand. I let him sleep and began to gather up our clothes from the night before. Harry's clothes I left in a pile at the foot of my bed. My clothes,  I carried into my bathroom and dropped them into the hamper. When I emerged from the bathroom, I ducked into my closet and found another robe for Harry to wear when he woke.
After Harry took the parchment, Mother turned around and headed to the stairs. Harry glanced down at the parchment in his hand. “It's a list of the house elves. Whenever you need something, just call one of their names," I explained.
“You don't know that for sure. I still don't think that it happened like you think. Just hear him out about this."
“I'm your mother, Draco. If I want to throw you a birthday party, I'm going to do it whether you like it or not," she answered, looking up from her party-planning book.
We had reached the row of lifts. “I guess I should let you go visit her," I said. I started to turn away.
I began to thrust slowly, pulling myself almost completely free of his body, before sliding all the way back in. I reached between our bodies and wrapped my hand around his dick. I began to pump my fist up and down his shaft, keeping perfect rhythm with my thrusts.
He nodded. I brought my hands to the snap of his jeans. I undid the snap and the zipper. Harry raised his hips from the bed and allowed me to slide down his jeans and boxers. I slid them down his legs and slid them right off. I caught his ankles in my hands and removed his socks. As I knelt on the floor in front of him, I couldn't help glancing up at him. I now had a completely naked, and fully aroused
“Now, you'll have to go to the front door because this door is for employees, but I want you to come meet those guys over there," he said, pointing to the group. I nodded and climbed out of the car. He met me in front of the hood of the car, grabbed my hand and lead me towards the guys.
I had been back at Malfoy Manor for about a week, and things weren't the same as they were before. Draco wouldn't be in the same room with me unless Narcissa was in the room, the house elves had started calling me Mister Harry again, where before Draco's birthday they had started calling me Master, and even Narcissa treated me like I didn't belong around the Manor. She had welcomed me back with open arms, and then, just like her son, she had become cold and distant.
I put my empty mug on the table and stood up. I followed him into the living room and over to the fireplace. Charlie flicked his wand and summoned our jumpers from the bedroom. They were the jumpers we had gotten from his mother at Christmas time; the Weasley tradition every year. His was black with a light grey “C" on it. Mine was a dark blue with a red “H" on it. We pulled them over our heads because we knew that Mrs. Weasley loved to see us wear them.
“No, Draco. I want to prove my love for you," Harry said. He snapped his fingers, and his bottle of lubricant flew up from the floor. I reached for it automatically, but Harry caught it first. “Not this time," he whispered.
“Yeah, but they've probably changed it since the last time you were here," Harry remarked, pulling the car to a stop. Hermione pulled into the spot next to him. Everyone climbed out of the vehicles.
Once we made it to Mother's study, it dawned on me that he really would be moving out of the Manor. Harry spoke quickly to Mother, telling her of his plan to leave. “Just know that you will always have a home here, should you need it," she said, pulling him into a big hug.
I sat there for a moment, stunned by his action. I looked down and picked up my wrap. I bit into the flour tortilla, enjoying the taste of the chicken. We sat in silence and continued to finish our meals. Harry leaned over every now and then, planting small kisses on my lips and cheek. Joanna came over and replaced our empty glasses. “Harry, I think you should know that Kyle has been staring at you. In fact, he's staring now," she whispered.
“Well, Rainforest Falls is a Muggle bar. If Harry's used magic to make himself disappear over the last week, I doubt that they would know where he disappeared to," I said, fiddling with my seatbelt. As anxious as I was about finding Harry so I could at least explain what had happened, there was also the feeling in the pit of my stomach that Harry wouldn't want to see me.
Charlie laughed as he came around the corner, carrying three mugs and a glass on a tray. Draco and I each grabbed a mug of hot chocolate. Charlie set the tray down on the coffee table and picked up the glass from it. The contents of the glass was a murky green color. Charlie quickly swallowed down the strange liquid in the glass. He shuddered slightly.
We sat there for a moment, letting my breathing return to normal. Draco suddenly raised his hand, and pressed his thumb against my bruised lips. I felt his magic again as he moved his thumb back and forth. When my lips were healed, he dropped his gaze down to where my hands rested in my lap.
I turned around and fell into step beside him. He looked at me, but didn't say anything about me walking next to him. “So, what started Narcissa's nightmares?" I asked him. He looked shocked, though whether it was because of my question, or my use of his mother's name, I didn't know.
“I have nothing to say to you, Charlie. Your a coward because you can't tell your family the real reason why we broke up."
“Well, I guess now is as good a time as any to start letting go of our relationship, at least for now," he said. He leaned back against his pillows.
Anger slid down my spine as I followed him. When we came out of the hallway and around the corner, Harry was standing next to the table and Kyle was picking himself up off the floor. But that wasn't what caught my attention; on the table behind Harry, the salt and pepper shakers and our drinks were rattling around the table. I didn't think, just walked over to him and wrapped my arm around his waist. At once, I noticed the rattling on the table stopped.
That seemed to snap Kyle out of his stare. He blinked, then turned back to Harry. “Can I get you guys something besides water to drink?" He asked.
“You want me to be honest? Fine. I didn't just go out on one date with Chase, I went on two dates with him and both of them were disastrous. I bet if I hadn't spent the whole time with him thinking about you, I might have enjoyed myself better."
“Their not mad that we hid our relationship; well most of them aren't. He wouldn't talk to me," he said, hanging his head.
I focused on the pain that I felt in my hip. I knew that when I no longer felt pain, he would be completely healed. The pain was still intense. As my magic worked its way over his hip, the pain lessened little by little. His body began to relax and the pain drifted away. I kept my hand in place as I opened my eyes and looked down at my hand. There was no trace left of his his injury.
.” Draco wrapped his hand around the side of a very enthusiastic Harry’s neck, his fingers dancing along Harry’s throat like he wanted nothing more than to choke him lovingly. The skin around Harry’s neck paled as Draco began to squeeze.
“Yeah, you’re right. I think Rotsley would enjoy one.” Harry nodded. “We can owl a Puff to Hogwarts right in time to spoil Rotsley’s appetite before dinner.”
I decide to go home early on Friday. I love working as Flying Instructor at Hogwarts, but the job takes a toll. My thighs and calves burn, my bones ache, and my upper back twinges. I wonder if I can convince Draco to share a pizza and curl up on the couch with me tonight.
“Hmm,” Harry said. “I was thinking about starting with the Fiendfyre blow torch and Draught of Living Death?”
Draco mouthed at the skin under Harry’s ear. “First,” he breathed, “I’ll get the red hot pokers ready for you and burn them until they’re scalding, just the way you like,
Fancy’s starting to bore me a little. I look down at the palms of my hands. They’re not mine really—this dead bloke’s hands. You can Polyjuice as dead people for a few weeks before you start to rot, no matter how they died. I don’t know why; that’s just how it is.
Switzly turned around to face them. They had reached the mattress section. She cleared her throat and cast an Elfin Sonorus. “The
“It might,” you reply, bloody stubborn as always. “I’d get better for him. I’d treat him right.” You glance down at the faded ciggy burns littering both your hands, some partially obscured by
Harry continued mouthing at Draco’s throat; muffled, “mmm… yeah, actually.” He reluctantly pulled himself away. Draco made a small noise of protest.
You struggle to pull on your sopping wet muddy boots that you always insist on bringing into the room. You almost fall as you put your left boot on your right foot, shaky and sweaty. Normally, I’d laugh.
“Oh,” you laugh. “One of your many flaws, mate.” The dirty sole of your foot travels up my calf and back down again, like your own sort of fucked-up show of affection.
I bring it up to my face and wipe the drool and wet vomit off my mouth and neck. Then drop it on the cold linoleum. “I’m clean,” I say, but I will never be clean. “I’m clean, and my father is dead.”
You smile grimly. “I’ve been talking to Robards and Kingsley,” you say. “They want me to join the force for good this time; they say it’ll be good for rebuilding and morale to have me with them. They’ll station me back in London.”
” He scowled, looking down at the ground. “I should have known better. Any man—if I can even call him that—who tries to cheat death is no friend of the Malfoys,” he continued, firm. He looked back up at Harry. “Death should be celebrated, not feared! We
“Oh. That makes sense,” Harry grinned. “Yeah, when I heard that the Celebration of Dark Magic Festival needed funding for their sensual
When I close my eyes, I see my father in his casket—that dried-up, shrivelled, rotten shell. His sunken, flaked off face. That wasn’t Father, but it was, and it was horrible, and it was real.
There’s a dip in my mattress from where we’ve laid there over the last several months. I could fix it easy, but I don’t want to.
“Brilliant,” Harry laughed, looking relieved. “Zacharias Smith made such a huge fuss about it the last time she escaped. It’s not my fault Smith wasn't wearing any shoes. Sheila was hungry, and his toes looked like blood sausages!” he continued. “It’s only natural, really.”
So I start jogging down the pavement. Stop at the next shop window. I look into it; try to check my reflection. Nothing.
You laugh. “I don’t want to think. It’s nice. Robards, Kingsley—they’ll tell me what I should do, and I don’t have to think.” You pause and breathe in, then let it out, hot and slow. “I’m just.. really tired of thinking. Of remembering all the things I’ve fucked over.” You smile, resigned. “It’s better this way. It’s good. I’ll help people. Make things right.”
“But the ache is the best part, darling.” Draco’s mouth twisted into something smug. “And I haven’t the slightest why Ronald would think such a wonderful thing.” He wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist and pulled him close. “You know I would never kill him unless he asked me to.”
Draco rested one of his hands on Harry’s arm. Then he faced Switzly again, clearing his throat. “Hello, Switzly,” Draco said, raking his nails back and forth over Harry’s bicep. “I’m looking for something else. Some more Bludgers and a new Beater’s bat, actually. Over there, correct?” Draco gestured in the general area to the side of them, his eyes glinting mischievously.
You drape one of your naked legs over my own. My damp robes keep my skin from touching yours. But you’ve already cut me open and slipped inside my chest and stitched me up again.
He looks good. Probably the best I’ve ever seen, and I’ve seen a lot of guys like him. Fancy. That’s what I’ll call him ‘cause that’s what he is. Dark eyeliner smeared across his eyelids like he doesn’t care, or maybe he doesn’t want people to see his real eyes. Mouth bright red from smudged lippy. Or from an ice lolly, but he doesn’t seem like the type to lick sugar ‘cause he’s really fucking skinny.
Switzly nodded, though still wary. “Please come along, sirs.” She turned and made her way down the aisle. Draco and Harry followed her.
Harry made a series of strangled noises that didn’t sound completely human. His hands grasped at Draco’s fitted shirt, then travelled lower and lower and lower down Draco’s back, till he reached his—
thousand!” Harry looked like he wanted nothing more than for Draco to demolish him into little bite-sized pieces. “It’s your turn,” he breathed.
You pause. Continue, “We could see the sea up close like we’ve always wanted; smell the ocean. We don’t have to come back; we could just stay there.” Your words come easy, but your hand clenches the bedcovers tight until your knuckles pale. “I’m serious, you know.”
“It’s all in good fun,” Harry smiled. “They prefer some flavours more than others,” he said, nodding like he had written the book on
“We should also send something to Monday,” Harry added. He walked a bit farther down the aisle, searching the shelves for something that could work.
I’m in the streets of Knockturn when I see him. I’m wearing Dudley’s old rags, and I’m polyjuiced as the homeless bloke who jumped in front of the train a couple of days back.
Your raw-bitten lips, your chipped teeth, your fucking mouth. I hate all of them, but really I don’t.
. She motioned for Harry and Draco to accompany her back to the Bedding and Sleep Section of the store.
“Alright, sirs.” Switzly took a deep breath in and closed her eyes for a moment before opening them once more. “Switzly will help sirs find the perfect mattress!” she responded, determined. “Follow along, please.”
I lean into you, my mouth moving against your neck. “My mother and father never really loved each other, you know,” I whisper into your throat. I pull back a bit so I can see you. “Not the way you’re supposed to, at least.”
“So glad you asked!” Harry exclaimed, enthusiastic. “We sleep on the plain concrete slab sometimes as well,” he continued. “We can never go wrong with hard cement.”
“What can I say?” Draco said, amused. “Zacharias Smith’s dining room window is the perfect target to practise my aim. I think I’d make an extraordinary Beater, to tell you the truth. My talents were wasted as a Seeker.”
“Monday says that Abigail—the Acromantula she got as a birthday present for Rose—escaped from her box earlier today!” Draco exclaimed, thrilled. He scanned the parchment. “Apparently she’s loose somewhere in the Hufflepuff girls’ dormitories after attacking Filch in the Great Hall.”
” Draco murmured, tracing Harry’s elastic waistband with his nails. “You know I would have only let it kiss me a little,” he pouted. “And never on my mouth.” Draco’s lips twitched as Harry looked at him incredulously.
Switzly narrowed her eyes. “Damn Malfoys,” she muttered under her breath. She clapped her gloves together, casting a strong Elfin Confundus that pulled the Malfoys a meter apart with a bang. She watched them, brows scrunching in mild irritation, her fear temporarily forgotten.
“The ceremony was certainly beautiful,” Robards says, eyes twinkling. “I still see it mentioned in Wizard Weekly on occasion.”
Your eyes are red, your pupils almost blown. Your skin is grey-tinged and sallow, and you're not the one who’s dead. “Merlin,” I say, hoarse. “How much bloody Dreamless did you shoot up this time?”
“Fucking hell, Potter,” I continue. If I knew how to be angry, I would be. “I’m not going away with you. My father’s just died.”
“Yeah, you know me so well,” Harry said to him. “I love a restless night’s sleep,” Harry grinned and leaned into Draco. Draco seemed rather satisfied with himself.
“Oh,” Harry sighed heavily, hand dropping from where it had been enthusiastically mapping out Draco’s thighs. “I fucking hate those things, you know that. Plus, didn’t we have to go last year too?” he complained.
,” Draco gave Harry’s neck another lingering, longing glance, licking his lips like he wanted to get his mouth all over him; savour him. “Oh! Also, remind me to curse all of my Bludgers with a light, time-sensitive
Then he glanced at Monday’s letter that Draco still held in his hand. “What did Monday say in her letter? All awful things, I hope.”
“I’m interested in your carnivorous plants. I’d like to buy all of them if that’s alright,” Harry said. He watched her with large, hopeful eyes.
My heart starts beating hard and fast like a machine gun against my ribs. “Do you want me to tell you to stay in Paris with me?” I laugh roughly. “Do you want me to tell you that Kingsley and Robards are wrong? We’re not good here, Potter.”
When I look to see my reflection in the glass, I’m not there. I can’t see myself. I see the street behind me and the occasional car or passerby reflected, but it’s like I’m not even here. I think the Polyjuice does that sometimes—it messes with my eyes, twisting my retinas around, curling my veins and tying them in knots.
“Ready to get the plants?” Harry asked, breathless. His neck and throat were red with Draco’s teeth indents scattered deep along his skin. (Draco eyed him, pleased).
You strip off your pants and drop them onto the carpet. You sink into my mattress, heavy, and it creaks. “Your goddamn bed,” you mumble. You stretch your arms behind your head as you lay back, and all I see are your bones and those fucking fresh track marks. “C’mere.”
“It really is a shame we had to regrow Rotsley’s fingers,” Draco said sadly. “He was terribly disappointed.”
,” Draco purred. “And when it struck you, you gasped, and I saw you all the way to your bones.” He eyed Harry all over. “I knew right then that I wanted to see you that way forever. In death and in life.” Draco fixed Harry with a deep, heated stare. He continued, voice dropping low, “I wanted to see you stripped down;
“Yes, the Quidditch aisle is that way, sir,” Switzly nodded, watching them tentatively, like she thought Draco and Harry might start slamming each other into walls, or creature food shelves, or mattresses again. Only they’d be naked this time, and it would be horrifying for everyone except them.
“What a special treat for those girls,” Harry grinned. He took a closer look at Monday’s letter. “Oh… and Monday says Abigail was also foaming at the mouth and gnashing her teeth at the fourth years! Sounds like a case of Acro-Rabies to me. Those girls must be having so much fun with her.”
My head is so hot I can barely think. My bones are so loose, I think they’ll splinter and come apart. I take another long drink. The whiskey slurs my thoughts; it makes them dull, and I like it. It keeps me sane, but not really.
So yeah, Fancy’s caught my eye, and there’s not much else I can do but watch him walk and breathe and live. I think I hate him already, which makes me like him even more.
“Father’s funeral was fucking fantastic, you know,” I gasp after I’m finished. “He insisted on an open casket in his will. Magically binding and all.”
“Let me take a look.” Harry squinted at the receipt and shook his head. Then he turned to Draco. “We should leave more Galleons, don’t you think?”
Harry laughed. “Yeah, I’m just fucking with you,” he said. “Although, we did have some fun with it back in fifth year.”
“Damn, that sounds fun for when they come to visit,” Harry said. “And I know Hermione always enjoys playing with Sheila,” he added. “If her screams are anything to go by, I mean,” he chuckled.
Switzly watched him, shocked yet relieved. She coughed. “Um… you’re supposed to wear the dragon-hide gloves. Otherwise they’ll break through your skin, sir.”
Harry happily gasped for air, causing Draco to chuckle as he slowly released him. Harry frowned in disappointment. “Don’t tease,” he complained, looking at Draco’s hand longingly. “Torture me instead.” Harry watched him, hopeful.
“Yeah, me too.” Harry pulled Draco close to him as they began following a horrified Switzly over to the Bedding and Sleep Section again. “At least for now, we know that Sirius is having fun down there.”
“Leave that bloody article in the street, Draco. We’ve got around fifty of them at the house. And put a shirt on—you look like a fucking skeleton.”
Robards smiles indulgently. “Magnificent. It’s so important to teach children valuable life skills.” He chuckles, looks at me in amusement. “Your aunt and uncle did well with you, Harry.”
Fancy’s eyes are red-rimmed and swollen. He focuses straight ahead as if I’m not standing right in front of him. He steps up to me—toe-to-toe with me—and
I retch into the toilet until there’s nothing left but my stomach acid coming up clear. I can still taste it in my mouth after, sour.
I stand there, still. Feel like my insides are jumbled up cold. In a few moments, that same crumpled article that Fancy was reading comes floating back my way. It settles on the ground. I bend over to take a look and read the title.
“You can’t make things right again, Potter.” I say. My heart continues to pound against my ribcage. I want to be angry; my brain is itching for it. You always want to make things right—you’re so bloody good, but you’re not, not really.
I take a sip from my glass, wincing at the pungency of it all. I force myself to swallow it down. Then I nod and smile and say thank you, I appreciate that.
Switzly approached them with tentative steps. Huge dragon-hide mitts enveloped her hands. “Should Switzly get your hungry plants now, sirs?”
(Draco and Harry had, after all, created quite the gruesome, horrendous wreck in the store’s Quidditch aisle. Their noises alone had sent many patrons and employees fleeing for their lives.)
, one of Monday’s favourites. She will be most displeased,” Draco said fondly, as he attached it to the store owl and put a few Sickles into her coin purse to cover all the costs. She hooted and flew away.
“Yeah. Anyway”—You open your eyes and look at me, gentle— “can’t say I’m surprised, honestly.” You nudge my thigh with your knobby knee that I hate but not really. “About your parents not loving each other and all.”
At dinner, Robards laughs heartily and sets his fork down onto the dining table. “Delicious as always, Harry. Draco, you’re a lucky, lucky man.”
Switzly’s eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets. “Um… what else do sirs like?” She looked like she was afraid to hear the answer.
Deep circles under his eyes ‘cause blokes like him never sleep. He leans against the shop window of Borgin and Burkes and lights up a ciggy with a nonverbal. He brings it to his mouth and breathes in deep, then lets the smoke out nice and slow.
,” Draco said, taking a look at their total bill. His lips curled and eyes rounded as he noticed the amount they had to pay. “Merlin,” he scoffed. “This is not nearly enough! Did you see this?” he asked Harry.
“Merlin, I want you,” Harry said, gruff. He looked like he was about to strip down and fuck him right there in the middle of the store. (It wouldn’t be the first time this had happened.)
Draco and Harry walked over to the plant section and stood at the beginning of the aisle, not entering yet.
My heart goes cold and stutters. Why would he say that? He knows about— I told him. The faded scar tissue on my hand tingles.
Once you finish with your boots, you amble over to the door and turn to face me. You’re skin and bones; half naked in those trousers and your fucking dirty boots. Your eyes droop low, red-rimmed as usual.
you’re home. You got my owl?” Draco rushes down the stairs, hair damp, towel wrapped around his waist. He looks at me expectantly.
It’s 2 AM, and some tosser is grinning and waving his arms at me like a fucking idiot; like I can’t bloody well see him standing there waiting for me to pull over and let him aboard.
“Thanks.” You smile and take a few deep swigs, then cap it and set it down on the mattress. “Fuck that’s good. Turns my brain to mush so I don’t have to think.”
As we were saying our vows, I caught a glimpse of two familiar stony faces at the back of the pews.  I was angry, but Draco said they wanted to come.
You turn away from the bed to face me, and your mouth contorts into something uncomfortable. “Yeah,” you say quietly.
