"Ah, good. It's very reassuring to have a mate around when something like this happens. We'll know more when he's seen the doctor and been to x-ray. You sit tight now and someone will be along to fetch him soon."
"I don't cook much, now..." Harry's voice petered off.
Malfoy's voice was shaking, his lips red and irresistible. Harry ran a thumb over them, his other hand sliding across the heat in Malfoy's crotch.
Harry caught him as he sagged, pulling him clear of the mess and receiving a rolling wave of confusion through the palms of his hands that hit his magical core with such strength it made him momentarily dizzy.
It was mid-morning by the time Potter returned to Grimmauld Place. He looked ill at ease and as soon as he'd dumped the carrier bags of shopping on the hall floor he started running his fingers through his hair in a distracted manner.
"I don't want to see you there," answered Harry firmly. "So why don't you just answer the question and maybe I can help. Why give me his name if you were buying from Romani?"
"What did you do, you slimy git?"
"Malfoy!" He gasped. "I...I need..."
He folded the newspaper in a deliberate manner in keeping with his current staid appearance and sat forward, directing his gaze idly at the benches spaced along the path. His upright position brought into view a figure seated a couple of benches further down, previously partially obscured by a young mother and the vast, cushioned sides of her state-of-the-art stroller. Something about the man caught his eye; perhaps it was the black leather jacket, cut in a style that had often tempted Harry to part with a fair few galleons, or perhaps it was the general air of depression somehow conveyed by the man's posture, sitting forwards as he was with his elbows resting on the knees of his long jean-clad legs, hands hanging loose and the curl of smoke from a forgotten cigarette rising up past his lowered head. More likely though, it was the colour of his hair, so blond it was almost white when the sun peeked through the leaves and danced across it, seeming to set it ablaze with a silver-gold fire.
"Feel? Oh, magic. Right...Merlin."
Malfoy swallowed, his Adam's apple bobbing.
Harry sighed. "I didn't want you to have to deal with any more of the hate, not today."
Potter actually looked taken aback and twisted his mug around in his hands until some tea slopped over the edge and onto the table.
Draco stared at him, a feeling of ice slipping into his veins.
It's been a long time since my last update and since that update the world as we knew it has changed. If you are new to this story, thanks for joining us. If you are returning to it, thank you for your patience. To all of you - I hope you are well and safe and continue to be so. Take care ü§ó
"Scrolls," Potter said abruptly, running his fingers through his hair. "Let's do the records first and see if there's anyone you recognise."
It was fortunate that Hermione's "Stupefy" hit Romani as he cast, for much of the power behind the curse was lost.
Malfoy shot him a look that suggested he was seriously considering a stinging hex or something of that nature and Harry shifted his position slightly, hand ready to throw out a

‚ÄúYeah? So you would be interested in a bit more than kissing Hermione?‚Äù
Pansy scoffed, rolling onto her stomach. Blaise watched Daphne's eyes travel appreciatively over the curve of Pansy's back before she started drawing the other wing. ‚ÄúThat's a waste of a lie, honey," Pansy said. "Of course you want to date him."
Harry smiled at the use of his first name, curled into Draco's chest and prayed he wouldn't have nightmares about the cupboard.
She blushed, not sure if it was his proximity or having to admit her quest. Lifting her chin, she said, "I will tell you after."

"And the rest of it, Potter?" Pansy asked. "No stealing, no entering anyone else's vault."
‚ÄúI read about your renovation work in the
"Indeed it is," Ginny said, delighted. "People buy several at a time."
I know it's a shorter chapter, but it was necessary. *warning* homophobic language (not a lot).
"I don't understand," Ron said, "didn't we already have this conversation when you told us you like blokes?"
Lisa smiled knowingly at the chocolates when Harry placed them on the desk. "Thank you, Mr. Potter," she said, sliding the box over and tucking them protectively inside the top drawer of her desk.
Please let me know what you think in the comments!
Harry thought. Though he didn‚Äôt believe that entirely. If anything, the truth was, he was more worried Draco would live up to the rumors; he‚Äôd be the best lay of Harry‚Äôs life and then bail on him completely.
James felt his arm pulled, releasing his hand, so Teddy could thread their fingers together. "OK," he managed, mind full of hope and fear from Teddy's strong hand in his own.
Lucius returned the handshake with a tight lipped, "Potter."
Pansy huffed a laugh, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not cute Potter.‚Äù She sniffed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure what you‚Äôre actually doing is burning your fryup.‚Äù
Harry wrapped his arms around him. "Would it help to know that at this moment I will agree to just a shag?"
"Because of my fame?" Harry asked.
Neville spotted him through the glass before Blaise entered. The broad smile on Neville's face gave Blaise pause.
Is this fic Crack? Lol, I'm really not sure. I haven't been able to figure out where the line is.
Pansy hopped down from the table and started to pace. "I want to be reasonable about this, but I just can't seem to find it in me," she said, seeming to talk to herself. She turned back to him, her robes twisting with her. "Why are you doing this to me? Just go be an auror! I know they offered it to you."
Harry said, his voice catching as Draco pulled the rope through another loop, letting the nylon brush against Harry's skin in the process.
on the bracelet.
McGonagall's voice was low and steady when she replied, "Under no circumstances will I allow you to abuse this accident in a fashion that lands one of my top students in Azkaban." She leaned forward on the desk towards the other woman, "If you attempt to force me out of Hogwarts, you'd better bring the entire Auror force with you, Delores."
Draco said, drawing out the last two words, "in our dorm room, wearing only flannel pants."
Admittedly... Fluff with plot. Lol!
Harry fought the desire to lean into him. Or drag him out of the room and finish getting off. "So what are your plans?"
"Oh, shut it, Potter," Pansy said, pointing an accusing finger, "You fucking
up to something.
‚ÄúWould you give them tips if it were?‚Äù
"I mean he's been on your mind for years. I get that it wasn't always attraction, but-."
He leaned in, "If we go any further we are going to get an eyeful of your uncle and my father." This statement was punctuated with a pleasure filled moan drifting through the hallway. He tried to figure out if he'd rather believe it to have come from Draco or Harry.
Harry searched Ron's face, trying to determine if he was taking the piss, if he was actually suspicious of Draco, or if he was really in denial. Whatever it was he didn't have time right now, he'd have to deal with that later.
Harry hooked his leg around the back of Draco's knee and they both tumbled to the ground, with Harry straddling him. He pinned Draco's willing arms over his head and smiled. Then, tugging off his glasses, he leaned down and sucked a love bite onto Draco's neck. Feeling the blonde's moans more than hearing them, Harry felt dizzy with desire. His hands, lips, and teeth roamed over Draco's body, attempting to touch every inch he could reach.
Draco rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúYes well, when I am wearing dragon leather I'm looking to get laid,‚Äù he said. He slid his wand into the slip sewn into the side of his denims. Boot had enclosed a note, saying that the muggles would all be carrying pretend wands so Draco didn‚Äôt need to worry if his was spotted. He picked up the wallet, rifling through the contents, muggle money, identification -reading Jason Smith-, and an emergency port key in the shape of a pop tab. Draco pulled out his ticket to the party.
A knock on his front door interrupted any hope of hearing more and Harry rushed to answer it. When he opened the door it was to a bewildered woman who was distracted by her mobile.
Draco glanced up, realizing that Weasley was sitting on a stool next to Potter, casting a
I also adjusted the timeline for AO3 (established in 2009) to be way earlier.
Kingsley shook his head, "It was mandated at the time. She was doing her job."
Draco cocks an eyebrow, leaning back against the freshly closed door.
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time to get undressed, Potter,‚Äù Draco says, his fingers deftly undoing Harry‚Äôs trousers.
"Still saving me, Potter." Malfoy noted wearily. "No. We're here now. I might as well call in at The Hag's Skeleton."
"Potter..."
He turned away from a mystified Weasley and dropped a wink at Potter, who flushed again in a way Draco would have found delightful if he wasn't so puzzled at his own feeling of detachment from the day.
"You could try mine," he offered.
He tried to take a deep breath to steady himself, quite forgetting the state of his ribs, and the resultant stab of pain made him gasp and grimace before he could stop himself. Immediately Potter's hand was on his elbow and although every nerve screamed at him to pull away, Draco found himself too dizzy to move. He concentrated instead on breathing; short, shallow puffs of air.
Malfoy's eyes opened. For a split second he looked confused, then his expression fell into a familiar sneer, not quite fast enough to cover the flicker of naked hurt.
Draco paced across the room, almost frantic in his desire to regain some control over the situation. He had no choice but to continue with the Ministry deal. Potter, on the other hand...the attraction couldn't be denied, but whether or not to continue to act on it in this tiny span of time they had together was his choice.
"No, Harry." Hermione pulled him around to face her. "Romani threw the curse. Malfoy put himself in front of it."
Cont...
"Fuck," said Potter, horrified, his hands taking hold of either side of Draco's face and his thumbs tracking the tears.
He followed the woman to the reception window, thankful Malfoy had told him his muggle identity was in his own name. He answered the other questions as well as he could with his limited knowledge of the facts, and confirmed he was a friend and was prepared to stay. Then finally he was free to return to the cubicle.
Really appreciate your kudos and comments :-)
"Here."
Then Malfoy knelt up between Harry's thighs, taking himself in hand and sliding his fingers up and down his own length, swirling his thumb over his slit and spreading pearly pre-cum over the gleaming head. Harry raised himself onto his elbows, watching avidly as Malfoy reached one hand behind himself and whispered a spell. His eyes went wide, startled, almost frightened, then he moved forwards with determination so that his knees were on either side of Harry's hips, a question on his face.
Harry watched him, hovering anxiously but keeping his distance, until the other man was settled back on the bed.
Unsure whether he was attempting to prove the ex-Slytherin guilty or innocent, Harry had pulled his file. The contents of most of the flimsy sheets of parchment were of no surprise to him. It was the neatly scribed notes relating to the period after the Wizengamot trial that caused Harry's eyebrows to raise. Although he'd been aware that Malfoy's wand was not returned to him, he'd had no idea that his use of magic was forbidden altogether, even to the extent that he was not allowed to have magic done on his behalf, such as side-along apparition or the use of magical potions. The terms of his probation made clear he should expect monitoring by the Auror department and that any breach of the conditions imposed would result in his immediate incarceration in Azkaban.
There was a small gap in the curtains. If Harry leaned to the right he could see that Malfoy was lying on his side, with his back to the corridor. His figure was long and lean beneath the hospital sheet and his shoulders were shaking.
"You don't think I've really changed, not deep down." His tone made it clear that it wasn't a question. "I assure you Potter, that boy from Hogwarts ceased to exist a long time ago."
"We'll apparate," said Potter hurriedly, his hand grasping Draco's upper arm.
"No, Draco. Don't go to sleep. You must get up now. Please, darling, for me."
"It was alright, I suppose. Not accurate enough for fine detail, but it worked for every day things."
"I can't do it!"
"Harry?"
Al snarled, bloodlust in his eyes.
Draco woke, knowing instantly that Potter was gone. When his hand found only the cold depression where the other man's body had lain, it did not bring any sense of surprise, only resignation. He opened his eyes without enthusiasm to a view of rumpled pillows and beyond them a note scribbled on piece of paper, its ragged edge showing its origins had been one of those muggle notebooks that were bound together with spirals of wire.
Completely taken unawares by Harry's abrupt halt, Ron bumped into him from behind, causing him to stumble into the office and the corner of Malfoy's lip to curve into the suggestion of a smirk.
"Alright there?"
Heart pounding so hard he was dizzy, he dropped to his knees, tugging down Malfoy's jeans as he descended. The man's cock jutted out between them, flushed now and leaking copiously as Harry ran a tongue slowly over the tip.
For someone who'd faced down a Dark Lord, he seemed uncharacteristically rattled, his fingers picking at a frayed thread on his hoodie and his gaze shuttling between Weasley, the warehouse and Draco.
"Are you scared of her, Potter?"
"Merlin!"
"It did to some of them. And the others, you of all people aren't responsible for what happened to them. It was a war, Potter. People get hurt in wars; they die."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, I s'pose so." Harry stroked his hair and smirked at him. "I am a Gryffindor," he said simply.
"I won't break," he panted as he took Potter in a headlock. "Don't patronise me..."
"Bad morning?"
Without waiting for a response, he slipped his fingers free and was gone. Harry swiftly applied a glamour and followed at a distance, progressing steadily down a series of increasingly unsavoury alleys and side streets. Eventually Malfoy turned into a dank courtyard that looked and smelt as though it never saw the sunlight.
In the end he persuaded himself that it was only right someone stayed with Malfoy in case there were after effects from the unknown spell. He pulled on a clean pair of worn joggers and settled gingerly onto the bed, careful not to brush against the other man and wake him. He lay there for a long time, watching Malfoy sleep, getting used to the warm ache in his chest that just looking at him caused.
"The Hogwarts team were all Slytherins; I expect that's why you've never heard of it."
"He'll have to know some time. I'm an auror, Hermione; this is part of my job."
He stopped abruptly, aware of the shake in his fingers as they passed through his hair. It occurred to him that this might be it for him anyway; he may never be able to trust anyone else enough to let them touch him in that way.
"It feels different."
"You'll be seeing Mr Malfoy home? Ah, good. And he will have company for at least the next 36 hours?"
"C'mon," urged Harry, tugging on the arm in his grasp until they were back in the well-lit corridor. Malfoy stumbled along with him, half-falling into Harry's side before righting himself with a curse.
He looked again at Malfoy, wondering at the reason for the jumper and jacket in the heat of the office, but his thoughts were interrupted when Auror Daniel popped his head around the door.
"But Harry," protested Hermione. "What on earth happened? You can't have apparated out of the Ministry."
Malfoy was not in Regent's Park. He was not at Grimmauld Place. His flat was empty.
His decision was already made and was inevitable. Anything was better than nothing. And after...Draco was used to pain and Potter need never know that his arch-nemesis had done the unforgivable and let his feelings get involved.
"Hey, Harry! Wait up mate!"
"A little warning next time, Potter!"
"Then after, I just wanted to get us back here, so I apparated."
She frowned at Draco.
They stared at each other for a moment, Draco bewildered beneath the weight of Potter's hand and Snape's gaze.
"Late for something, are we?"
"That's fine." Draco swallowed. "Thank you."
"So?" Ron waited expectantly. When Harry didn't answer, he continued impatiently. "So, what curse was it? Is he hurt?"
"Way I heard it, you took a curse for my best mate." He swallowed as though the words were sticking jn his throat. ¬†"Wanted to thank you for that, so I thought I'd let you know some high-ups in the Ministry are whinging about your deal. They say you haven't contributed enough and the deal should be called off."
Potter withdrew his hand immediately, looking unexpectedly upset and leaving Draco's shoulder inexplicably cold.
"Madam Pomfrey really came through, didn't she?" Harry deflected, embarrassed.
Potter's grip tightened on Draco's shoulder.
"No time like the present." Draco rose to his feet, brushing off the feeling of light-headedness that made the room tilt for a moment.
"Yeah, good thinking," Harry nodded. "If Robards goes for it...and I think he will."
"It was a mistake, Harry. I released him straight away. You couldn't see properly."
"He stepped in front of it," she said disapprovingly. "To stop it hitting you!"
"Gloves?" Potter gestured at some that were hanging on the wall.
There was an element of bitterness in the words as he continued.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Now, Mr Potter, if you could just move to the side, Miss Granger and I will do what we can."
"I'm sorry, about your mother."
Kudos to those who leave kudos and encouraging messages :) really appreciate it.
"Malfoy?" Harry repeated gently, making his way slowly across the room. "Are you alright?"
Potter stood, his chair scraping back over the kitchen tiles. He picked up the mugs, knuckles brushing briefly against Draco's and sending an unexpected jolt of magic and something else thrumming along his nerves. It was distracting enough that Draco didn't process the whoosh of the floo behind him until a large hand had hold of his arm and a loud, irritated voice was in his ear.
"But yes, I know potions, and I might know a few people to talk to, but you'll have to get my restrictions lifted; I'm no use if I can't even go to Wizarding London."
The taxi was old and smelly and creaked on bends, but frankly Draco didn't care. By the time it turned up he was perilously close to passing out again and he just couldn't allow that to happen. He'd hunched into himself, his fists clenched tight in his jacket pockets and his gaze fixed on Potter's familiar face, while he tried to ignore the way the ground was rolling uneasily beneath his feet.
He took a deep breath, attempting to calm himself and reminding himself that Malfoy was injured and had always pushed his buttons more easily than anyone else he knew.
"Perhaps. Although neither Miss Granger nor myself experienced such a connection, so it may simply be that you were the first magical person to touch Mr Malfoy. Of course, a previous history of trading curses and jinxes may have made the connection more sensitive."
Harry's thoughts were in turmoil so far as that particular individual was concerned; he was seriously tempted to leave him behind until he'd had a chance to separate his feelings and the facts but couldn't decide on any way of doing so without raising the other man's suspicions that he was deliberately being excluded from something.
The gut-churning ride ended in the aurors' department; Potter led the way through a heavy set of double doors and Draco found himself in the main office. A deathly hush fell over the room as Ron Weasley pushed a chair away from a green felt mission table and got slowly to his feet, his face nearly beet-coloured with suppressed rage.
She caught a glimpse of his expression and her face softened.
Harry laid the wand down on the table and took his own out of his pocket.
"I was looking for you. We need to talk. Official business."
"Really? What would you have me do precisely? Wave my bloody hand at it?" Malfoy slashed his hand through the air with a vicious motion.
"I'm cold," he insisted, then added unnecessarily, "I don't feel very well."
"You got him!"
To his relief the medicine was dispensed without too much delay and appeared to be a broad spectrum antibiotic, an ointment for bruises and some heavy-duty painkillers. He scribbled a quick signature and rushed outside to find Malfoy waiting in a patch of shade, eyes closed and feet planted firmly on a square of patchy grass. He turned towards Harry slowly, lashes lifting to reveal eyes that appeared almost silver in the light reflected from the hospital windows. He looked ethereal, Harry thought, an exhausted fallen angel, surrounded by discarded cigarette butts and sweet wrappers.
Draco POV
Draco gave a quick nod in greeting to Macmillan, hoping that neither of them had realized he‚Äôd been asleep. It wasn't his fault really, he'd been up all night reading fanfiction.
"Wait," Astrid interrupted, "pure-blood?"
, "but I'm thinking that if you get me out of your system,"

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Harry calls back, ‚ÄúCome up.‚Äù
Delores Umbridge spun around at Draco's voice, "An accident?!" she cried. Her bulbous eyes looked near to popping, "You think I don't know wandless magic when I see it? You did this on purpose!" She turned back to McGonagall, "You expel him this instant or I will have you removed from this school!"
‚ÄúDraco Malfoy?‚Äù
Harry looked over Astoria's shoulder at Draco and said, "I do owe you." Earning him a grin from the blonde.
"Do you want to tell me what tricks you'll have me performing tonight?" Draco asked, keeping his eyes on the paper he was holding.
Blaise was already wearing half his costume, dark red boots, tight blue pants, and a utility belt. He didn't fully understand this costume because he‚Äôd never read a comic but Pansy had promised him it would be worth it. Blaise had only made one request for the party. "There has to be dancing."
Heat blooms through Harry, lust pooling in his gut as memories of Charlie's deep voice and rough hands flash through his mind. In New York, everyone had left Harry to recover from his hangover, taking advantage of the trip to go sightseeing. Everyone except for Charlie.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt. Just- just don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm a slytherin. I‚Äôm not going to get emotionally invested in someone who‚Äôs getting married after school." Blaise pulled on his robes, casting a spell to keep them free of wrinkles. "Honestly, you should be careful too. This thing with Potter can be fun for you, I get that, but you need to watch yourself. Potter has a tendency to get attached fast, look at his codependent friendships.‚Äù
Walking through Diagon Alley Draco glanced sidelong at Potter. At least in the trim fit of his blood-red auror robes Potter looked normal again, Draco had seen enough aurors in his lifetime to become desensitized to that outfit.
She looked at him for a moment, searching his face, ‚ÄúYou have too many wrackspurts, Harry. You are going to need a bit of help.‚Äù Then she turned to Draco, ‚ÄúDraco will you take him before school, please? I won‚Äôt have time to do it because I‚Äôm working with Professor Loire.‚Äù
Draco lifted an eyebrow, "Are you just desperate for my company?"
"Boyfriend?" Potter says. And honestly, Draco considers killing him. Just pulling out his wand and casting an AK. End both their suffering.
On Wednesday, Harry considered having the rentboy look-alike fuck him at the real Malfoy's desk. But he quickly decided it would be too easy for Malfoy to find out and then Harry would end up at St. Mungos.
‚ÄúTechnically he‚Äôs my 1st cousin once removed,‚Äù Astrid replied. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not the only one at the house though. He‚Äôs married to a guy, Draco, and they have a son from Draco‚Äôs first marriage who is 12. So, I will be with all of them.‚Äù
"Blowjobs," he deadpanned.
"No!" Harry rushed to stand up and had to grip the high back of the chair as the patio stopped spinning. "I didn't mean anything by that. I'm just curious to know."
Harry‚Äôs mouth was hot and sweet like cherry red wine. He is just as demanding in kissing as he is with everything else, lips insistent and eager. His hands slid over Draco‚Äôs body and his fingers twisted the front of my shirt, tugging Draco close.
"I was just trying to enjoy a few bubbles," James said, hoping to save Teddy from any trouble with his cousin. Besides, it really was his fault. "I'm not sure if they got so out of hand because of Albus or because of the hot tub?"
"I know not to touch things that aren't mine, darling." That was Zabini, his honey voice impossible to mistake for anyone else.

, and Neville was at one of the two desks trimming his newest pet project, Songbell flowers.
That drew a reluctant chuckle, easing some of the tension between them. "I guess I thought it made sense," Potter said with a shrug. "Ernie is a pureblood and part of the sacred 28. And you're," he waived a hand in Draco's direction, "you."
‚ÄúThinking of hiring you, actually, for the Manor.‚Äù
"I'm not comfortable answering questions about sex," Neville said.
It was not fine.
Special thanks to @mhamilton_6 for bookmarking this story with a very sexy comment. I read through all your bookmark stories and they were a great selection!
‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù James dove in, releasing Teddy‚Äôs hand to link both arms around his neck and pull him into a hungry kiss. When Teddy‚Äôs hands gripped his waist, James pressed his body against him. Teddy‚Äôs tongue pressed against his bottom lip, rolling with a slick slide into his mouth when James gasped.

‚ÄúNo one knows about the company I keep,‚Äù Potter says. Green eyes travel with open hunger over Draco‚Äôs body. ‚ÄúAnd if they ever make me choose between my life and my job they are going to be sorely disappointed with the outcome.‚Äù
Harry stumbled through the floo into the drawing room at Number 12. He stepped away quickly, not wanting to block the entrance. Green flames lit up the hearth and then died down, leaving Draco to step out elegantly onto the carpet.
‚ÄúWe are,‚Äù Blaise said quickly. He did
Draco cut in, ‚ÄúUnless you are being supervised, and in a Wizarding home.‚Äù Astrid glanced over at him, seeming to briefly study his face, before looking back to Scorpius.
"Quit," he said easily. He could feel his cock getting hard, straining against his denims. He was still pressed against the wall in the hallway, and he was thankful to have something holding him up.
"Er‚Ä¶ I must have forgotten that," he said, and then added, "Do you mean to say my tea?"
"A great shag, or safety at work."
"Don't worry
Harry sighed, and berated himself for ever getting drunk around Hermione. She always remembered every drunken monologue he gave. "The Draco constellation is in the North, it never sets, and is made up of not just stars but also planets. The myth behind it is about a dragon named Ladon who guarded golden apples."
"Something on your mind, Potter?" Malfoy asked without looking away from the mirror spelled to his closet door.
"Alright. I've been very patient," Potter said, sitting back down. "Would you please tell me what's going on? I had no idea my house would let you waltz in without invitation."
"Bigotry. Sir."
"I don't talk about it. I couldn't remember all of it for a long time..." She shrugged and sent Harry a brave little smile. "It's in the past now."
"Do you, Potter, with me?"
"Perfect. How did you know how I like my tea?"
"Um, no." He sent a quick glance up the stairwell and then snatched up the bags. "We need to talk."
"I'll do my best," said Harry in an even tone. "You're not asking me to lay off your friends and family then?"
Harry jumped in front of him and threw a powerful calming spell at the violent column of wind and debris but the power of the magic battled with his own and the funnel screamed like a banshee as it reached out towards them.
"We had breakfast in the same room for years," he noted, not wanting to think about the fact that he must've watched Malfoy pretty intently to know how he preferred his tea.
The other man reached out and snared the pharmacy bag.
He rose in a series of graceful movements and stretched his long form like a languid cheetah. Harry forced his eyes away from the fluid movement of lean muscle beneath the pale gold of the other man's skin and wished with all his heart that he wasn't so hopelessly attracted to him.
"It's okay," said Harry hurriedly. "It's to help you breathe." He caught hold of Malfoy's fingers and placed his hand back on the sheet, speaking reassuringly. "The doctor will be here soon. They'll fix you up."
"Go and play Auror somewhere else, will you? I don't fancy a trip back to Azkaban."
Harry scowled.
"You're crying," said Malfoy unnecessarily, his other hand coming up to cup the side of Harry's face.
Cont...
"C'mon."
"C'mon."
Harry stood there for a long time when Malfoy left the kitchen, his hand missing the cool strength of the other man's fingers and his mind wondering what the hell was going on.
Harry had no compunction about turning away and leaving Malfoy to deal with that one on his own. He withdrew out of earshot and left them to it, observing, more out of habit than anything else, the physical pattern of their interactions.
Harry touched his shoulder, taking care to keep his hand on t-shirt. Malfoy's eyes opened slowly, the skin beneath them bruised in the dim light.
"I need some air," said Malfoy sharply, turning on his heel and walking unsteadily towards the main entrance doors.
Harry stepped back and took a firm grip around Malfoy's waist. He summoned his magic, the powerful energy enhanced by his frustration at the situation and his anger at his colleagues' behaviour. He formed a powerful spearhead and then, without spinning at all, disapparated them straight through the Ministry's wards, blasting a considerable hole in the defences and setting off every alarm in the building.
Their arrival at the Ministry caused a flurry and more than a few frowns. Aurors and building maintenance staff were still hard at work restructuring wards. Harry ducked out of the busy atrium as quickly as possible, glad that at least on this occasion the negative attention was more on himself than Malfoy.
"I'd rather not stay, thank you."
It was no wonder Potter liked the place, thought Draco wryly, holding the slightly greasy menu with his fingertips: bacon sandwiches; cottage pie; treacle tart. None of it would have looked out of place on Hogwarts' tables. He settled for a mug of tea and some cheesy chips and sat picking at them, while Weasley scoffed down an enormous mixed grill and Potter ate his way steadily through cottage pie and a large slice of treacle tart.
He was feeling a bit chilled but wasn't about to admit that to Granger, not after the whole hippogriff debacle. However it seemed Granger had her mind on other things.
"No!" Harry insisted. "I can feel it!"
"Perhaps if I let it be known that Malfoy is assisting in your investigation on a voluntary basis?"
Hermione's hand restrained him, the grip of her delicate fingers combining with the power of her urgent explanations to erode the rage that burned in him. It was a long time since Harry had felt so angry, so betrayed and so very disappointed.
Despite the grim set of his face, the other man did not disagree.
A tiny flutter of hope stirred in Draco's belly and he squashed it brutally; there were only so many disappointments a man could take.
Harry slammed the gates closed rather more vigorously than intended and the lift shot backwards, causing him to stagger into Malfoy. A cool hand against the small of his back steadied him, but then made no attempt to move away.
He waved a hand at Draco in a vague way.
Draco studied the weave of cloth over his knees and swallowed hard, blinking furiously and thinking his father would have been so disappointed in his lack of self-control, not that he gave a fuck about that any more. To his surprise he realised that the warmth of Potter's jean-clad thigh was right next to him and then the man's hand descended onto his shoulder and gave a gentle squeeze. Draco's skin shuddered at the quiver of magic that he could feel even through the cloth and he fought against the instinct to lean into the touch.
The tilting and sliding sensation was all getting a bit much, so Draco eased himself down until he was seated on the sun-warmed bluestone with his back against the house wall. He pulled off his socks and stretched out his legs, bending one knee up for comfort.
To his annoyance Harry found himself blushing again.
Malfoy nodded slowly. "I suppose I should thank you. I don't think I ever did, did I?"
They waited at the apparition point for Weasley for quite some time. Potter still seemed on edge, his eyes continuously glancing in Draco's direction then turning quickly away. After a while it began to grate on Draco's nerves.
That established, the man seemed to relax and wandered into the bedroom, hands stuffed in his pockets.
"Do you have muggle ID? A muggle identity?"
He broke off, the muscle flexing in his jaw.
"After serving time in Azkaban and being banished from wizarding society?"
"Great. Yeah, great," replied Harry with false cheer, wishing the ground would swallow him up.
"Yeah, I believe you. But that doesn't mean you can't help. You know potions and you know, or knew, the sort of people who might be involved."
It was the only warning he had as the blond head suddenly dipped forwards, catching him sharply on the cheekbone. Long legs buckled, tangling with his own and despite his grip on Malfoy's waist they went down in a heap, Malfoy a surprisingly heavy, limp weight in his arms.
Despite the casual tone, Harry understood the importance of the question.
It was warm and dark and pleasantly quiet. He mumbled a protest, wanting to sleep; he was so tired.
They stared at each other for a while, then Snape cleared his throat.
He was back on his feet, one hand firm on Draco's hip as he guided his cock to Draco's entrance. There was a moment's sharp pain, the burn slow and bright and deep inside Draco, fluttering red behind his closed eyelids. He forced himself backwards, impatient, his cock jerking at the startled and needy noise Potter made, at the way his grip tightened and his other hand fastened onto Draco's shoulder.
Harry's magical core flared bright, the sentiment echoed approvingly by Grimmauld Place. Malfoy must've felt it too, because he moaned and tangled his tongue with Harry's, his hips pushing forwards so they were both left in no doubt that the other man was invested in the kiss. For a few seconds it was perfect, long enough for Harry to know he wanted to keep kissing Malfoy for ever. Then other emotions began to filter through the lust swamping their sensory connection, chillingly from Malfoy, the over-riding emotion was fear.
"Let's keep it that way for now."
"Malfoy."
Sometime during the night he lost count of the number of times he had to restrain Malfoy physically, conscious always of the man's injuries and horribly aware that with each passing hour the ex-Death Eater was becoming steadily weaker.
By late afternoon they were eyesore and irritable and had gone through most of the scrolls, coming up with a frustratingly small list of names that Draco thought might have the right connections or skills to be potential suspects.
(See the end of the chapter for
They arrived in the kitchen at Grimmauld Place with a tremendous crack. Malfoy staggered a few steps away as he was released, shock on his face.
The man's shoulders moved uneasily, almost as though he felt the weight of Harry's stare. He took a final drag on his cigarette before dropping it to the floor and crushing it beneath the sole of his boot. Long fingers ran through wind tousled hair and the man stood, the gracefulness of the movement blurring as he hunched his shoulders and shoved his hands into his trouser pockets. He walked slowly past the bench, the gaze from his silver-grey eyes drifting over Harry's false facade of portly middle-age and moving on, uninterested.
"Then, Merlin, get on with it."
"They didn't respect him at all, any of them. In the end it was the same obsequious hangers-on who were baying for his blood at the trials."
He gestured at his nose and lip.
"Try again," he urged, his voice gruff in his own ears.
His Auror training insisted it would be interesting to see how Malfoy reacted on being apparated into one of the warehouses, but that thought made him feel horribly guilty; Malfoy had changed for the better, whether Ron could see it or not, and Malfoy had been the one to alert them to Romani in the first place.
"Hot," said Potter in a reverent tone. "Really fucking hot."
"Gloves are for muggles."
That was more than enough invitation for a Gryffindor and the door opened wide.
Hoping his wandless magic was precise enough, Draco threw a "Protego" over Granger to buy her time while her wand unlocked. He turned back to see Weasley was now down on one knee as he cast a swift binding spell over the white haired figure before him.
"Madam Pomfrey?"
He hesitated, reluctant to leave Malfoy, who was capable of causing a major magical incident if he came to and panicked, not realising where he was.
"May I?" Granger queried in a polite tone that seemed out of place in the circumstances.
"Not necessary I assure you."
Malfoy looked mildly exasperated.
as he waited for Malfoy's next move.
With that, Malfoy fled, walking swiftly away on his long legs and forcing Harry to jog for a few paces to catch up.
The Hag's Skeleton public house was a looming structure, its odd collection of dark roofs partly obscured by the acrid smoke belching out of several scarily leaning chimneys. Malfoy strode across the courtyard, cast a glance at the caged and mouldy skeleton suspended over the doorway and ducked inside. There was a brief blast of wild music and hard laughter and then the door shut behind him.
"Are you sure you're up to this? I mean, you're still meant to be taking it easy."
Before Harry could reply, the floo crackled into life and Ron stuck his head out of the grate.
She said the latter in a dry tone without making eye contact with either of them and Malfoy snorted softly, a rueful twist to his lips.
"Ugh, that was intense."
Robards must have read his body language because he straightened with alarm and rushed to offer the use of his private Floo.
Steady grey eyes focused on him.
Snape's mouth pinched briefly as he looked from Potter to his godson and back again.
"This is Malfoy we're talking about, you know."
"He's my best friend, I'll give him all the time he needs. But this whole thing just makes sense; we've been trying to get these smugglers for ages and it's tying up too many valuable resources."
Draco sat up slowly, analysing and accepting the ache and soreness of his body as a price willingly paid for the intimacy of the previous night. He summoned the note with a lazy flick of his fingers and deciphered the scrawl with some difficulty.
"I'm sorry," he said suddenly, surprising even himself.¬† "For, y'know, thinking..."
"If you would be so good, Draco."
Draco forego his urge to say something. sarcastic, choosing to ignore them both, shoving his hands into his pockets and fixing his gaze on an ageing, homeless man in a brown coat who was settling down in the doorway of a vacant shop opposite the cafe. Nameless and lost, invisible because he'd somehow fallen through the cracks in the society in which he'd lived. It was an uncomfortable thought and far too close to home.
"I haven't forgotten them either. I have a lot of regrets about the way I behaved in school," noted Malfoy carefully. He mulled it over for a moment. "So, that's why you thought I cursed you. You still see me as a fifth year. You don't trust me."
"I'm sorry," Potter breathed against his neck.
Then Robards pointed across the corridor.
"Has anyone even looked at your injuries?" Harry asked quietly.
"Greyback isn't here," said Potter faintly. "There's nobody here but us. You were hallucinating; you're running a really high fever, Malfoy."
The other man rubbed his forehead with quivering fingers and shrugged. Harry caught a brief glimpse of grey eyes before he lowered his face to his knees.
Malfoy's tone was sharp, his face paler than normal in the weak sunlight that filtered in through the small window.
"Nothing major," she assured him. "But it's better to have everything written down; there's less room for legal manoeuvres later, if someone decides to make things difficult."
"I bought a drink, made the usual conversational moves. It was going well; in fact I'm sure I had a positive contact with a third party, then that..."
Draco flicked ash into the wind, deliberately timing it so a gust swept it towards Weasley, who grimaced and swore. Draco smirked at him, because that's what Weasley would expect, but the hollowness in his belly was untouched by the small amusement and the sickening, nervous throb of his pulse was undiminished. He was in trouble and he didn't know why.
It was quite some time before it occurred to him that Potter had been similarly affected. It wasn't long after this revelation that the man stuck his shaggy head around the door.
This prompted a very Malfoyesque scowl, but surprisingly he then went quiet, his grey eyes roaming over the vast variety of miserable people, finally settling on a wailing toddler with her arm in a temporary plaster cast and a steady stream of snot descending from her nose. He stared at her for a while and then muttered something under his breath.
Malfoy blinked at him slowly and pushed himself upright in easy stages. He looked exhausted, Harry thought, unsteady and pale and ill. The unfairness of it brought a deep burn of anger to his gut; a few potions and spells would heal the majority of Malfoy's injuries so easily in comparison to muggle medication. He decided that as soon as Malfoy was safely settled in bed, a flue call to Hermione would be a priority; with her position in the Wizengamot there was a slim possibility of a suspension of sentence, especially with Malfoy under his care.
Breathless, wanting, Malfoy's chin dropped, grey eyes dark and intent as Harry opened his mouth, looking up from under his lashes as he let the warm weight settle on his tongue. He closed his lips, suckled slowly on the salt-sweet fluid. Malfoy groaned and Harry spurted a little at the sound, his hips moving involuntarily as he sought friction against his own zipper.
"I think I might sit on the floor."
Ron righted himself with a frown. "Yeah, mate; what's all the rush about?"
It was clear from Potter's expression that he had complete faith in the female member of the Golden Trio, not that there was any historical evidence to suggest that faith was misplaced.
Both men nodded. Draco picked up the parchment, grey eyes casting quickly over the list before handing it to Harry.
"Is it an issue for you to give me, of all people, something you brought for Malfoy?" He asked, breaking into a grin, "No," he finished, biting into the apple.
‚ÄúI work for a non-profit. The office is just outside of London proper. My wife‚Äôs sister started it in ‚Äò97. I began volunteering in January of ‚Äò99 and became an employee after the first month,‚Äù Dudley replied. His words seemed hesitant, as though he was trying to speak carefully and not stumble over them. ‚ÄúI met my wife there, actually. We had a,‚Äù he glanced quickly at his daughter and then back to Harry, ‚Äúsomewhat quick dating period, and married in the Spring of 2000.‚Äù
"No. I just didn't have it in me to listen to you work. Wouldn't want my magic to go wild and take out the wall," he said, only half joking.
Harry didn't look back at him right away just continue to watch the stars above. "Gringotts," he said and turned his head to look at Draco.
"Yeah it's this ridiculous idea that," he thought for a moment seeming to choose his words, "It's like being really racist against everyone who's not the same as you. Which Draco isn't- he doesn't believe that anymore- but he was raised that way. He saw a lot of terrible things during the war, and it changed him."
"Sorry," he said, "I'll just go, then."
"Then don't." Hermione let go of his arm to point a finger at Draco. "If you want to know if Harry fancies you then you're just going to have to ask him yourself."
Looking around the place he realized it was a bit of a mess. He went back to the boxes with focused intention. About 20 minutes later he heard voices in the hallway. The neighbors! Harry ran to the door and pressed his ear to it, he could hear a bit of the conversation.
Pansy smiled, "And no, I plan to use your Savior status as much as possible until school starts."
"Yes," he whispered.
‚ÄúHello, students.‚Äù Headmistress McGonagall stood in front of two medieval suits of armor standing with spears crossed. ‚ÄúWelcome to your common room. This room was built specifically for the returning 8th-year students. The capybara was chosen to represent you because this animal is known to be friendly with a wide variety of other species. You will each do your best to set aside the past, get to know one another, and set an example of inter-house cooperation for the younger students.‚Äù
Considering the fact that Potter has just walked into the establishment of a former Death Eater, Draco very much doubts that, but he doesn't say anything. He knows Potter wants to keep his private life private. He doesn't even blame him really, Draco knows that the general wizarding public would lose their minds if they found out the Savior was getting his fill of Malfoy cock several times a week.
He called at the counter on the way back, ordering a takeaway coffee and bacon sandwich and catching the end of Weasley's puzzled comment about it being "bloody odd" to see Harry worrying about Malfoy, rather than something the ferret was doing.
"I'd really like to kiss you now."
Malfoy ignored him, keeping his head down, his eyes partially obscured by the soft fall of pale hair. He really didn't look well.
"I wasn't buying from Romani. As far as I knew, I was buying from a small-time potion supplier."
Hermione settled in a chair opposite him, watching him intently.
"You can fix it later."
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry swore softly, feeling unreasonably upset.
"You killed a homicidal maniac; you did more than enough."
"Malfoy! Shit! Stop! You're going to fall down the stairs!"
It made Draco feel sick to his stomach. How had he let himself be so needy, so vulnerable? He'd even broken down in front of Potter, who was so decent that he probably now felt sorry for Draco because he was so weak.
"Since when did we play by the rules?"
(See the end of the chapter for
A vulnerability he would never have admitted to caught at Malfoy's voice.
"No. No! That's not it."
"Malfoy?"
The curse splintered over the shield, violently brilliant purple veins racing across its surface; it did not penetrate the shield to reach its target, but did cause it to fracture and collapse as the purple veins faded away.
His insides were churning violently at the realisation that in the heat of the moment he hadn't actually asked if Malfoy was okay. He'd been distracted by the ledger, and the man had looked alright, but he should have checked.
He burst into damp mist and chill mountain air just outside the Hogwarts' grounds and raised his eyes to the castle. It loomed above him, stirring emotions despite his current apathy. Those stone walls had borne witness to his childish, blind pride, his hopes and dreams, his betrayal, his overwhelming terror. At times it had been the safest place he knew, at others the most dangerous.
"Alive."
"Now, Mr Potter! There's no need for that! If there's ever anything at all we at Hogwarts can do to help, you only have to ask."
"Storage facility."
"So you think the Durmstrang group are trying to take over?"
"The request coming from you, that'll make a difference. I suspect the Ministry will want some sort of arrangement to sweeten the deal though."
Harry sent him a quick glance, nodded and then took a quill from an earthen pot on the mantelpiece.
"I just wanted to feel the sun..." He shivered, speaking more to himself than Harry as he turned his face towards the yellow light. "It's so cold."
"Well, Mr Malfoy? Surely you recognise this one?"
"Madam Pomfrey is here now. We need to let her treat Malfoy."
"Shit!"
"That's because he was always up to something suspicious," Harry protested.
"He's here somewhere. I can smell the little git. C'mon out to play boy...you know you want to!"
Malfoy looked at him, expression confused, then his face hardened.
Harry waved a hand in a vague gesture and Hermione made a little moue with her lips, no doubt recalling the ease with which he was distracted, even if she was unaware of the reason. In truth, Harry himself wasn't sure why he was so involved in Malfoy's well-being, although the thrum of magic that had gone through him when his arm was around the man was hard to dismiss.
Potter looked as respectful as he sounded and Minerva McGonagall's eyes twinkled.
Harry snorted, torn between amusement, duty and anxiety at the implications of the find. "Ranworth didn't go through the ledger?"
"Draco."
Malfoy grimaced but complied, his arm rigid with embarrassment.
Potter, clearly on edge, frowned at him.
Returning the handshake, Anna gave a slow nod, not trusting her voice.
"No Potter," Draco smirked back at him, "one bird is enough for you."
! Giggles, and cursing. Dirty giggling! The three of them tittered along with her as she moaned, and giggled her way to what sounded like one hell of a climax.
Draco allowed himself to be pulled back, sheathing his wand, and fixing Dudley with a disgusted sneer, "If I'd known it was you I wouldn't have bothered with the wand. I would have just hit you."
"You want to date me." Malfoy lifted an eyebrow, "And the wallbanging? Are we going to wait on that until we have some sentimental gryffindor night that can be finished off with sweet, gentle, boring sex?"
a hug. Maybe Teddy's Hufflepuff-ness was rubbing off on him.
‚ÄúPlease, please,‚Äù Harry whispers, pulling Draco down for another desperate kiss. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs enough. I‚Äôm ready.‚Äù
Malfoy watched him from across the table a slow smirk spreading on his lips as he waited, radiating false patience and superiority.
"No, no. It's ok, I can fix it," Harry ran a hand through his hair, canceling the charm and leaving himself with only the dark messy locks on top. "Better?"
Both men turned to look at him, Draco's unamused face melting into shock as antlers grew on top of Harry's head. The jellybean, from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, was charmed to give people traits from their patronus. Harry had bought them for Luna's birthday bash last February, where everything was already so bizarre it would have been weird not to have antlers growing from your head. They were a big hit among the guests, Harry only had 4 left after the party.
"Yes," said Harry bleakly. "We were. Did he say where he was going?"
"I know," Harry agreed under his breath, running a finger along the thick wallpaper. "Me too."
A weary smile tugged at the side of Malfoy's mouth.
Draco nodded, a bit breathless from the impact. He had no idea what the curse had been but its effects seemed to be minor, thanks to Granger's intervention.
"Well..." Hermione gave him a wise look. "If you're going to work together, it will be much easier if you're not fighting all the time."
"Merlin! Yes..."
Malfoy shook his head mutely.
"You're gorgeous," he blurted awkwardly and then they were on the floor, the woven rug coarse under his back and a desperate and vulnerable set to Malfoy's features that made Harry's chest constrict with the urge to protect him, even as his cock jerked against the heat of the man's thigh.
"Yes," said Harry after a pause. "So long as there are no major changes to what we discussed."
Malfoy's face was impassive. "Perfectly," he said in a langourous drawl that seemed deliberately pitched to set Harry's teeth on edge and bring a tightness to Robards' jaw.
"I heard," Malfoy ventured carefully, "that your aunt's family weren't the nicest."
Malfoy tugged away from him, his eyes wide and silver in the light.
"She's a healer first and foremost, Malfoy. Anyway, she's coming by later. I'll owl her that you're awake."
Ron's face was flushed, his face earnest.
"Oh, I don't know." Malfoy regarded him with a serious air. "I can think of worse things."
"You sound surprised. It's no secret that I have no love for The Ministry but if you hadn't noticed, Potter, I'm dead. It has a way of clearing the mind. And Draco is...family to me. I hope you will bear that in mind in your future dealings with him."
"Ron."
Reluctantly, Harry headed towards the dispensary, casting a quick glance over his shoulder as he did so. He caught a glimpse of Malfoy's blond head on the far side of the glass and decided to hope for the best.
For some reason that thought irritated Harry.
"Don't call her that. And no. Ginny and me are over." Harry sighed. "It's...I don't want you to get hurt because of this, because of me."
It was equally unfortunate that, partially dazzled, Potter saw the blue streak of light and Draco with his hand raised. He raised his own shield immediately and threw "Immobolus" at Draco, then with a look of intense betrayal on his face he yelled something to Weasley and they disapparated with a loud crack.
Malfoy's gasps became sharper; his hand reached down, casting some spell that sent a tingling, cleansing rush through them both and coated his crack in slippery fluid. The sensation was almost too much and Harry cried out, gripping the base of his cock with his eyes closed as he fought for control.
He turned on the spot immediately and vanished with a sharp crack. Draco was about to follow when Weasley caught his elbow.
Draco swallowed, hard, feeling a bit choked up at the sight of his godfather after so long.
"Because you need help."
"You know why I'm here, I suppose."
"Hermione explained what you did...I couldn't see..."
How had he allowed himself to forget that they were just using him? He was a pathetic excuse for a pureblood; the Malfoy's and the Blacks must all be spinning in their tombs. The Ministry needed his inside knowledge to solve their pathetic little case and then he would be pushed aside and forgotten so they could all get back "to normal".
"Right," said Ron. "Everything alright, Harry?"
Draco handed him the list, fighting an urge to duck as a flock of paper memos skimmed over his head, bringing the disquieting sensation that he was under attack from a barrage of disapproving paperwork. He'd been out of the Wizarding world for far too long.
"Four," he yelled at them, then looked directly at Granger. "Five!"
"Someone recognised me."
Malfoy closed his eyes briefly; when he opened them again he kept his gaze aimed at the ceiling.
"Potter."
They spent the next few hours wading through parchment, interrupted twice by the tea trolley and once by Weasley, who brought Potter a plate of sandwiches and a home-made treacle tart. Potter, being the decent human being he was, halved the food as soon as Weasley left and then watched with sad eyes as Draco picked at his share unenthusiastically.
"Did Aurors attend?"
"Potter!"
His intensity was mesmerising, thought Draco, distracted despite his better intentions. Mesmerising and oddly attractive, but there was a thought better left unexplored.
Beside him, the subject of his thoughts gave a weary sigh and leaned gingerly against the wall, looking wistfully at the lines of brown plastic seats, all currently occupied. Whatever benefit he'd felt from the ride in the taxi was clearly evaporating with every second on his feet, and they hadn't even got as far as the Triage Nurse yet.
From the minute Potter stepped out of the Floo, Draco knew something was wrong. He felt the smile stiffen on his face as his stomach gave an uneasy lurch. Potter looked desperately unhappy.
"Where do you live, Malfoy?"
It was the last thing Harry had been expecting. Was it an example of Malfoy's undoubted intelligence, that he could continue to process information under duress, or simply something that he'd concluded earlier but chosen to keep to himself until now?
Harry laughed out loud. "Yes!"
Harry shook himself mentally; Malfoys didn't wear jeans and boots and slouch on park benches in the middle of the day, not even in Royal Parks.
"O'Keefe, Yoki and Romani were all members of the Durmstrang team?" Harry guessed.
All that remained was to collect Malfoy.
"I expect he's grown up a bit. Give him a chance."
A chapter about feelings - more (ahem) smut next time I promise üòò
Draco's arm was released, the grip moving to the back of his neck as he was forced to lean forwards awkwardly over the table. Warm thighs pressed against his buttocks and he gasped, dizzy, black spots dancing in the air between him and Potter.
Harry wasn't sure how long it took for the heart-wrenching grief to ease, but gradually Malfoy's body stilled until he was a limp and exhausted weight in Harry's arms.
She was, as always, right. Shortly afterwards she took her leave, hugging Harry and running a pensive eye over Malfoy's slumped figure.
"I think I might shower; cleaning spells aren't quite the same."
Malfoy lifted his face then, the shadows masking his expression. "Might as well. It's not as though it's going to keep me awake really is it?"
"I'm sorry," he said with contrition.
"Someone decided to teach me a lesson, Death Eater and all that...I'm sure you are familiar with the situation."
(See the end of the chapter for
"...walk. C'mon Malfoy, just walk."
"Look, Harry, you've got to treat this seriously."
What a fucking mess.
"And some of the other names on the list were in the Hogwarts' team?"
She smiled her sharp little smile, including Draco in her magnanimity, rather to his surprise.
"Um, right," said Potter, looking incredibly flustered for someone who had vanquished the world's greatest evil force while he was still a teenager himself. "Destination then."
Draco grimaced, wondering why Potter believed him.
"They are poisonous, you know? Lead-based paint was very common in that era."
"What for?" asked Draco weakly.
"The place will be in uproar!"
Less easy to dismiss was an insidious fear that Malfoy would be hurt because of him; this in turn made him realise with a sense of shock that a good part of his anxiety centred around a fear of losing this unexpected, fragile and precious thing that was growing between them.
Ron was visibly reluctant but demonstrated his own loyalty by acquiescing with a grumble, leaving Harry with a headache and a dilemma he really didn't know how to tackle. He poured himself a cup of bitter coffee in the Aurors' break room, thinking morosely that all things considered it would probably have been easier if he wasn't shagging a suspect he was meant to be monitoring.
Thank you for reading! Appreciate the kudos and comments - you're awesome! Please keep them coming :)
"You bastard!"
Draco fell onto cool sheets, Potter close beside him. Immediately Potter raised himself on one elbow, turning towards Draco and draping an arm over his waist. His fingers caressed Draco's ribs, soothing and titillating at the same time.
And then he couldn't speak at all and Potter didn't try to make him, just holding him tight and stroking his hair while Draco curled into him and grieved in silent, wrenching sobs for everything he'd lost.
The 'p' was particularly sharp, reminiscent of their schooldays.
Malfoy dropped him a sharp nod. "Thank you."
Potter glanced back at him, a quick flicker of green eyes before he turned resolutely away and strode into the kitchen, casting a "Yeah," over his shoulder, followed by something that sounded suspiciously like, "Might as well get it over with."
Malfoy's weight drove them back against the ancient wallpaper, causing a portly wizard in a portrait above them to mutter angrily and slam a door as he swept out of the frame.
A quick update this time.
"Harry, are you alright?!" Hermione's voice was shrill with alarm.
"You saw what you expected to see," replied Malfoy in a bored voice. "Let's just get on with the case, shall we?"
"You realise he's been through an ordeal. It may take a while longer for him to recover in other ways."
"Hey, wait a minute! What happened in there?"
He fielded a few questions from the two aurors and then strolled over to Potter, who spared him a quick and thoughtful look before ushering them all into the lift. Minutes later they whirled into an unexpectedly fresh breeze at the apparition point not far from Tower Bridge.
"Look, its like, I dunno, two o'clock in the morning or something. I'm going to make some coffee. Do you want a mug?"
"What? No!"
Malfoy was clearly amused, pulling out a carver chair as he spoke.
"Right," he said, "I'll get that coffee then."
"Really, Potter! I don't even have a wand."
"That must've been a disappointment," said Harry, trying to make light of it.
"Malfoy?" he asked, voice raspy and uncertain.
Malfoy stood perfectly still for a moment, his face white and set, then he took a deliberate step forwards into Harry's personal space, grey eyes wide and his fingers tracing a quivering path along Harry's hip. Harry understood, with shocking clarity, that they were going to fuck, and that it was somehow essential to Malfoy's sanity that they did so right now and at his instigation. It made Harry a little breathless, stirring adrenaline in his belly, that understanding and the subsequent willing acquiescence of any control he had over the situation.
Despite his own racing heart and flooding adrenaline, Harry tried to give comfort where he could, wrapping Malfoy's shuddering body in blankets, applying wet cloths when his skin burned hot and dry, talking about anything and everything to try and ground him in the present, but Harry's own self-control eroded dangerously in the face of exhaustion and the re-emergence of buried traumas of his own.
Harry took it reluctantly. The wood was still warm with a heat greater than that of Malfoy's hand. He flicked his wrist.
"That's not unusual, not if someone has an intense connection." Hermione chipped in. "And you and Malfoy were always very aware of each other."
As soon as they arrived back at Grimmauld Place, Malfoy took himself off, expressing a desire for a long, hot shower.
"He's what happened, filthy Death Eater!". Ron spat the words into Malfoy's face, which didn't waver from its derisive sneer.
Malfoy looked up then. His grey eyes met Harry's, narrowing slightly as he took in Harry's expression.
"I wasn't thinking clearly, but yes, to a certain degree."
"You want me to go," he stated bluntly.
"So what is this to you?" he asked quietly, gesturing between them. "It's fairly obvious we want to shag each other, but you don't even trust me not to curse you...so is that all it is? A meaningless shag?"
A few minutes later, cold and terribly sick, Draco slipped quietly away into unconsciousness.
He swallowed hard, pulled himself together with an effort and stalked off in the direction of Winch's Potent Potions.
A fourth unknown figure burst into the cavernous space through a side door to the left and his "Stupefy!" was a split second later than Granger's sharp "Incarcerous!" The curses collided, writhing on the floor like a tangled mass of highly charged snakes.
"You stepped in front of that curse," she said in an accusatory tone.
Desperate to come, he reached down with his other hand, but Potter swatted his hand away.
"Exactly. And by far the most vociferous after the event too."
Cont...
"You can just fuck right off, mate, far as I'm concerned."
"Is Ron okay?"
"Now would be a good time for you to elaborate."
"I'm sorry. This must be hard for you, after..."
"Well I did. I'm sorry, Hermione. I'll apologise to everyone in the morning. Get away from him, Ron."
Malfoy's voice was strained and muffled and he made no attempt to move from a position that must have been excruciatingly uncomfortable for him.
Draco walked quietly, keeping to the shadows, their darkness matching his mood of prevailing depression. He had sensed he was being followed at the station, picking up two faint ripples of magical energy as he stepped onto the platform. It was enough of a trace to be certain they were wizards, but weak enough that they were quickly lost in the bustling hum of humanity in the concourse.
It may have been his imagination, but it seemed the long fingers warmed slightly in his grasp. He maintained the flow and found himself staring absently at their joined hands, Malfoy's pale skin contrasting with his own slightly darker tone, both hands bearing similar broomstick calluses.
"Malfoy, Draco Malfoy," he said, his tone heavy with dislike. "I never thought the day would come when you were in my office."
A lumpy looking female gnome lifted a foxglove leaf and peered out at him.
Hermione laid a gentle hand on his arm.
The eyebrow remained raised, Malfoy's gaze sharpening. "Having second thoughts?"
The briefing was blessedly brief. Potter was clearly animated by the possible breakthrough and easily communicated his enthusiasm to a specially formed team comprising himself, Weasley, Ranworth - who looked more like a mild professor than an auror - and bluff and well-built Briggs . An anonymous unspeakable was also attached for the fresh stage of the investigation, but was not actually present.
Malfoy pointed the wand at a small glass vase on the table. "
"You know him well?"
Draco decided not to ask; it wasn't as though he'd have any say in the matter anyway. Sex and unfortunate feelings aside, he was still essentially in Potter's custody until such time as the Ministry was done with him. With this in mind, he drew on a lifetime of practice and assumed a politely disinterested expression as he shrugged on his leather jacket. The weight of it settling across his shoulders grounded him and he stepped resolutely towards the Floo, the soles of his dragon-hide boots firm against the parquet floor.
Truth was, he was overwhelmingly attracted to Potter. It was time to admit that to himself. What's more, he'd been attracted to Potter for a long time, although he couldn't pin down the exact moment when rejected friendship and the subsequent blur of competitive animosity, hatred and suspicion bordering on obsession had gradually given way to a long-denied realisation that there was something incredibly hot about Potter and his ever-present power.
Then Potter gripped him hard, one hand coming up to his waist as he flipped them over, his thigh between Draco's as he thrust faster. Draco squashed the swell of panic; it was Potter and he was safe with Potter. He concentrated instead on the sensation of Potter dry-humping him, allowing it to overwhelm him until he pushed his hips up desperately in response, the kiss breaking as he threw his head back against the floor. Potter's teeth caught briefly at his throat and it was enough. Draco cried out, balls clenching as he spasmed and came in hard spurts with Potter following immediately, shuddering and grinding his release between Draco's legs.
"I know." Harry clapped him on the back, gave him a brief one-armed hug. "Let's get back to Hermione; she looks really upset."
"Look Potter, it's alright. I'm very grateful for all you've done, giving me a place to rest and everything. But I can't just lie around forever and you have things to do, Auror business and all that, so I'll just call myself a cab..."
"I don't want to be here, Potter."
"You were worried enough about him yourself yesterday, Harry. I hope you two haven't been fighting?"
It seemed to take forever, but by the time the flow of spells had slowed to the more simple cleaning type, Malfoy's pale face had turned a colour more natural to him and Madam Pomfrey and Hermione looked as exhausted as Harry felt.
"I'm fine, Potter."
Potter took hold of Draco's arm in a bruising grip, spun him around and threw both arms around him, effectively pinning him to his chest and stopping his headlong flight.
"Wordless and wandless." Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "Very impressive."
Draco raised an eyebrow.
"Explain."
Briggs and Ranworth turned up a few minutes later and they spent half an hour or so debriefing the raid on the warehouse. They were finishing off when a memo from the Research Department bounced off Harry's forehead. He swiped it from mid-air and smoothed it out.
"These are Black family heirlooms," noted Malfoy, lifting up an intricately patterned bowl for closer inspection.¬† "You're not actually planning to eat off them, are you?"
It took him a long time and everything he had in him to get back to the small but expensive flat near Regent's Park. Dawn was lightening the sky by the time he fumbled the key into the lock and shut the door behind him. He let himself pass out then, crumpling onto the waxed wooden floor. His last fleeting thought was that if he died no-one would care, but at least it would be in private.
It was no secret that Mattock had run with Fenrir's pack or that he'd been a regular visitor and on-site torturer at the Manor, facts with which Robards was well-acquainted. The Head Auror ignored Harry, keeping his sharp gaze on Malfoy.
"Okay." Draco breathed in the warm smell of Potter's skin, slid his hands around beneath the robes and let them trail down towards Potter's arse. There were too many memories in Hogwarts, heaping up on top of him in a suffocating mound. He needed to think about something else, something that would obliterate every other thing from his mind. "Kiss me first though?"
Potter responded by laughing and launching himself across the gap between them to bury his fist in Draco's stomach. Draco doubled over, taking a handful of black hair in his fist on the way past. It was on, although at first he felt sure the other man was pulling his punches.
"Shall we call it a day?" Harry asked quietly.
They changed quickly, Draco borrowing some of the spare kit kept for trainees.
Draco nodded, flinching internally at the barely concealed dislike on Brigg's face. It didn't matter, he reminded himself. He wasn't there to make friends and putting on an impenetrable front was second nature for a Malfoy, especially one who'd had the dubious pleasure of a noseless psycho as a house guest.
"Ah, yes. Weasley, sorry. Old habits..."
When they wheeled Malfoy out of the cubicle he kept his face turned away so Harry had only a brief glimpse of dishevelled, pale hair before he was whisked away down the corridor.
Harry poured out mugs of tea.
Malfoy leaned down and kissed him again, their tongues curling wantonly around each other. The brush of stubble against cheek, teeth against jaw and neck and collarbone built the tension until they were both leaking, warmth sliding between them on belly and groin.
"I knew that was you," sneered a husky voice from the shadows inside the cage. "The Malfoy whelp. I'd recognise that smell anywhere. What's this then? Working for the Ministry now are we? Wouldn't Daddy be disappointed."
"I don't really remember much about my parents. But, you know, I miss them anyway."
Snape's expression softened. "I understand things have been difficult for you. You have been unwell?"
Within seconds Madam Pomfrey had whisked Malfoy out of the room and onto a hastily configured operating table. By the time Harry had followed on rather stiff and shaky legs, the air over Malfoy was thick with diagnostic spells and Madam Pomfrey's face had turned a shade paler.
Eventually he managed to get out a hoarse sentence.
"Is not here."
"A ledger Ranworth found in premises we now know were leased out to Romani for an import business. Harry, it's just the break we've been waiting for!"
"I've got your wand, so whenever you feel up to it..."
"They're cross with you, Potter." The tiniest hint of a smile tugged at Malfoy's lips as he turned to summon the lift.
