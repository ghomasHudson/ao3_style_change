“Where’s Draco?” Harry grit out, nursing a deep gouge at his shoulder, the blood was quickly - possibly too quickly - weeping through his fingers. He refused to look at the wound, in case it was much worse than what he first brushed off,
Harry just…stood there. For a while, he didn’t think he was ready to try and look for Draco. He felt unraveled by the sheer dominance he unleashed on the Omega, and he couldn’t help the shame that brewed inside when he realised he’d liked it. He liked putting Draco in his place, of reminding him who’s authority took precedence.
There wasn’t a response for a few minutes, and Sirius had chalked it up as a failed and too personal question. He opened his mouth to ask something else when he finally got his answer.
Draco touched the front, never seeing a book like this in his life. “Where’d you get this monstrosity?”
Draco pulled him into a room just before a bend. Even if they were alone he didn’t want to risk the chance of someone walking in on their conversation, at least with a locked door he could control the ears in the room.
“Don’t let him hear you say that or he’ll let it get to his head,” Draco grumbled, and then he paused. He stared hard at something in the distance before blinking when a thought struck him. “Maybe I could hide out in the forest until it’s all over? The wards extend past the forest, I could camp out there for a few days?” Dumbledore would surely forgive him? If no harm came to anyone, it’s not like he had a real case against Draco.
“You owe me an explanation.” She said, her golden eyes burnt like embers, even when her face was cast in shadow.
The corridor filled with the smell of honey, and Harry had to swallow a couple of times to clear away the water in his mouth.
In the Headmaster’s study there was the Headmaster himself, with Slytherin’s Head of House standing cautiously in the shadows.
“It’s not so bad,” she said soothingly, running a hand up his sleeved arm. “It was the only way I could stop myself from hurting others when I lost control. It’s no one’s fault.”
He took a deep breath, steeling himself, and made his way towards her, only nodding a quick, wordless goodbye to his posse.
I think i might draw fenrir next for this chap. movie version is fugly as and i love me some bad boy wolf people
Bellatrix’s heart hammered in her chest at the excitement after another successful raid of territory. The Death Eaters under her command swarmed the three story mansion overlooking the northern coast. This was now their fourth seize of property today, and it was late into the evening now, by this point this year the Death Eaters were in possession of dozens of secret locations across the English countryside.
. It was like he was missing something he never quite noticed until it was gone, and its absence was distressingly missed - like the warmth of the sun he has paid no mind to suddenly went cold, like the white-noise in his head was switched off.
To his horror, in ten minutes, Draco had only managed to hand out five. He was forced to already reposition down a floor since most people upstairs disappeared at the site of him. Luna never explained what he was meant to do with the extra when he decided to call it a day, did she honestly believe he could hand out every last copy before midnight? He never thought to ask how long exactly it took handing out the Quibbler by herself.
Sweat built up at an alarming rate over his flushed skin and he worked hastily to lift his thigh higher, then positioning the toy lower until the head was pressed against the skin at his slit. A shiver rushed through him at the sensation of cold rubber meeting delicate wet flesh.
Harry blinked at the sudden shift in tone and mood. He bemusedly reached out and shook the hand the other boy was now offering. Looking as confused by the exchange as he felt, and wordlessly watched Zabini slide from the bench and back to the Slytherin dining table.
The same girl lifted her hand again. “But sir, will we all try to dispel it? It’s a third year level spell…I’m sure the first few of us to try may end up killing it.”
“You’ve got to be kidding,” Harry said angrily. Draco shrunk in shame, only realising himself what he had done. “Fuck…It’s 1996, Draco. I’m not gonna bloody hit you like some — Crack-pot abusive husband.”
Draco silently cursed the older man when he realised he could feel a laugh bubbling out of him, it rumbled through his back, likely in response to his terror.
It was an ultimatum. Dumbledore expressed that he felt he needed to quickly solve this problem now before it became a dangerous disaster, and the easiest way to solve it was to officially bond Potter to Draco, during his heat. If it really occurred on a tri-monthly basis, that meant it would be coming once during the early days of October, and again sometime near the end of the year.
No one said a word for a long time, not even Gryffindor’s beloved social demonstrator. There was only a tense silence until the dismissal bell rang softly. Snape used the opportunity to collect his things and leave the room in one sweeping motion.
Harry just wanted to be irresistible to the impossible blond, but it seemed like his pheromones alone weren’t good enough. It stumped him because Harry was told on a nearly regular basis that someone was head-over-heels in love with him. It’s not like he wasn’t used to the attention, since reuniting with the Wizarding World at 11 Harry was at the centre of it, drawing people in with the fascination of his scar. But now, after his 16th birthday and presentation day,
For a while, there was peace. The music was soothing, the chaos was sleepy, and Draco - not since a long time - wasn’t anxious.
joining Harry at the stairway on the first floor. Since that Saturday morning, this was the first time they’d spoken all week, Harry seemed determined to keep a respectful distance until it was Draco who approached first.
The sounds that continued on for the rest of the night would root themselves into Sirius’ mind for the rest of his life - moans that would be the inspiration for his deepest sexual fantasies, screams that would haunt his darkest nightmares, and weeps for mercy that would leave him feeling like he was the cruelest, most disturbing man on the planet.
This needed to stop right now or he was going to explode. That unstoppable sensation of magic was making its appearance and was rippling through him like an oncoming wave, like it was sending a warning. Like it was asking Draco if it could emerge.
“I said no!” Draco tried to stretch his other hand out to tap his wand to the wall again, Dumbledore be damned, but the elf’s skeletal hands clamped onto his forearm and refused to let go. “Hey! No! Get off —“
“I am - Merlin, I would’ve figured things out a little faster if I had more people just telling me what the hell is going on.” He was so close to grabbing a fistful of hay and throwing it at her, but he was frightened of what foul smelling things have touched it first.
“Can you show me?” Snape asked him, taking a step closer. His eyes were running over every centimetre of the boy.
Harry only smiled back crookedly, as if he was still a little unsure of himself, but that didn’t stop his brazenness from taking over long enough to switch tactics and to put a hand between Draco’s shoulder blades, now guiding him up the stairs towards the ten metre tall castle doors.
The door was pushed open and Draco could make out Lucia’s blonde head peak through for a second, after seeing it was only Draco inside she smiled and walked in, posture relaxed. “Hi Draco, how are you? Oh I see you brought the notes Romilda was telling me about…” She picked one up after putting down her armful of note books and quill pens. “Wow, this looks a little hard. It would be wicked if you pull it off though! Here let me show you what we’re planning - “ She swapped one of Draco’s notes for hers and thrust it into his direction. He charily plucked it from her hand and began to read as she continued to speak. “ - I don’t know if your family ever had this growing up but my family are crazy about Madeira cakes, but we’d do it with almonds and candied pumpkin. I wanted to have the elves help me make a massive one. As big as the Great Hall’s clock, with little dancing skeletons on it. It’s going to be
an Alpha. An Alpha would stop it all. Why did this Omega insist on inflicting himself with this cruel and unusual punishment?
“What…What the hell was all that about?” Said a girl in a Cleopatra costume, Harry didn’t recognise her.
The Slytherin was hoping the Gryffindor boy wouldn’t ask, but it wasn’t like he was surprised either.
He had just finished witnessing a memory - a painful memory from a long time ago. With his wand he scooped the silver strands out of the cauldron and into a glass vial, storing it away only to be seen again in another few years at least.
The pale skinned, blond haired cherub was gliding down the hallway, having just come out from Snape’s N.E.W.T level classroom.
He frantically looked down at himself, patting down any where he could think of in case his shell-shocked brain failed to realise he was missing a limb… Not a scratch on him. His hands were sweating and shaking, and his clothes were dusty from the debris, but he was unharmed.
He squeezed harder, there was a squeaker in its small chest that strained to the point of soundlessness.
“The problem is very simple.” Snape declared finally, after two hours of exploring Draco’s mind with impunity. Draco didn’t believe the man needed to stay in there for as long as he was, and mutely grumbled his displeasure as he rubbed his eyes to relieve the new headache forming.
He let his body be partially swallowed by the black leather seats, a small part of him wanted to be completely consumed and disappear forever, but the rest of Draco, the hardier, stubborn side, wanted to see this world just fucking burn.
Dumbledore couldn’t wait until a reasonable time on Monday? Niffler also seemed to unofficially be appointed as Dumbledore’s personal Draco retriever.
“—You—“ Were he a cat he would’ve had every fine blond hair on his body standing as he whirled in on the Headmaster. “You did this on purpose!” Draco screamed, feeling so angry that tears were threatening to spring out from his eyes. “You knew I would talk to her! You knew I would say something!”
“Because I want to control it. I don’t want to be afraid of my magic, that’s not what you taught me.” His eyes were glowing silver-gold in the candlelight. “That’s not what my house or this school has taught me.”
“What in Morgana’s good grace is going on? What are you boys doing?” It was McGonagall. She had shoved the door into the spare classroom open, rushing in. Somehow Draco’s magic could sense the cavalry coming to save him and slowly retreated; the colour, the sparks, and miraculous, inexplicable physical warping of magic all came back to soak into his shivering, sweaty skin.
Most of Monday was a blur for Draco, classes went and gone. He couldn’t remember anything eventful happening in 4th Elective with Snape, besides the man stopping him after class again, but this time to only send a quick message.
He continued to hop around as if he was dancing until the train moved far enough away that the platform disappeared around the bend in the rails.
Then the Omega couldn’t hear a sound, only a cold, still silence was filling his head. It felt like his heart wasn’t beating, or that he wasn’t really breathing, all because he couldn’t hear it. There was no sound to confirm the action. The unbearable silence, however, did not last, and he almost wished it had.
.” Draco couldn’t even look the man in the face, his own face was blushing so hard it was stinging in some spots. He was staring furiously up at the ceiling, the last unsullied thing left.
To Draco’s absolute horror, Snape was even crueller to Draco in front of others than he ever was in private.
‘That’s not scary,” Blaise said once he saw her, he loomed above them both wrapped in a black cloak from neck to toes, his dark skin was spelled into a blue-grey tinge, his facial features warped into a snarling snouted bat, with thin pointed teeth that protruded down to his chin.
“I can… You have to believe me, please.” Draco slammed his hands on Dumbledore’s desk and hung his head low, he was one more plea away from falling to his knees. “I
. Especially Ron in the corner. Face as red as his hair and the fake blood splattered all over his front. “Oh Merlin.” Draco quickly covered parts of his face. “
Harry was scowling, not liking the feeling of being ganged up on like this. “Maybe I should ask him to the ball?”
Those left in his group - Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, Adrian Pucey, Pike Gorgon, Graham Montague, and Marcus Flint - were surrounding Draco as they travelled out of the castle, they were all dressed in pale-coloured, lightweight summer robes. Despite being a half-bonded, pheromone dripping Omega, none of the Alphas in his house dared lay a hand on him. Save for the occasional teasing. There couldn’t be one thing alone attributed to it, as Slytherins were renowned for many things - their unbreakable centuries-long unity, their deep respect of power, and their complex understanding of traditionalism - just to name a few.
Draco didn’t say it, but he did it almost as if he was goading for the Alpha to try something, just so Draco could try to fight back again, determined this time not to lose and be punched out cold to the floor.
“We will tell him nothing.” Dumbledore whispered. He leant in close from his side of the Floo, close enough for Sirius to make out the faint details in his severe frown and furrowed brow. “Draco is still a very active problem, he is too volatile. We’ve successfully kept him happy and peaceful enough to not harm you or himself, and I hope things remain this way for as long as possible while he returns to Hogwarts, but this isn’t a matter of
“Well, think about it rationally, Draco. Pure-blooded couple. It’s traditional. Our families have history and it’ll be a hell of a lot more palatable for everyone. I doubt anyone would see us having a bloody brawl in the middle of the dining hall. Besides, you know the media will talk. They don’t know who you’ve bonded to yet but it won’t be long till someone comes around to ask.”
Greyback took a barefoot step. And then another. Still laughing until he was close enough that Draco could feel the spittle. When close enough the Alpha quietened down and took a deep snarl of a breath.
“There is no one left to trust.” He said finally, as if her action revived him from a trance, but he still looked on out the window, expression a mystery. “Spies, traitors, despicable dirty liars.”
He then looked down at his clothes, the same emerald green jumper and grey slacks, he’d never thought about changing it up before, not particularly fussed about impressing Muggles. It’s not like they really knew what tasteful fashion was. Although… He’d grown an enriched appreciation for denim jeans. It wasn’t Muggles he would be meeting either, Sirius was probably waiting for him with that damned motorbike. It could be heard whenever the man was leaving or returning to the house, sometimes it would wake Draco up in the middle of the night.
The smell of freshly watered plants of the herbology theory room was like a muffler and it quietened his buzzing thoughts as he walked in. Draco set down the stack of notes he had rewritten on finer quality paper, with emerald green ink.
“Severus and Minerva had filled me in on details I was not aware of the first time, I’m not very savvy of these things. The boys had undergone a ‘partial-bond’, the consummation wasn’t complete, despite Harry’s
He was no wild animal, he’d proven so enough times since escaping Azkaban. Granted, it was difficult to keep himself from resorting to his impulsiveness - he was aggressive, paranoid, and a downright bastard at times. He got why Draco feared him, why he rejected him. During heat, he was the boogey man in Draco’s eyes. But…
“Could you tell me what happened?” He was awfully gentle, taking a seat at the foot of the medical cot that Draco was now tucked into. Draco’s eyes cast to Snape who stood by the entrance - his presence like a dark, intimidating shadow.
“It’s alright, and no that doesn’t make me feel any better at all, but thanks.” He accepted her hand-up as she pulled the both of them to their feet.
This time they did leave, and Draco could see over his shoulder Luna attempting to pick up the smouldering black lumps out of the grass, piece by piece.
“Accepteth my humblest of apologies. Would’ith thee grant-eth this loyal servant the honour of thy hand-eth to merrily…Uh…Jig-eth, my Liege?”
He seemed to have been assigned Beta friends for his own safety. He was so small. He looked like all he wanted to do was play and learn and grow.
The Headmaster started to stroll around the perimeter of his office as if he was talking about something as simple as the weather.
“Well…Yeah? I fucked your brains out, mate, least I can do is take you out to a dance.” Draco punched him in the arm ( - Merlin, it was so
“Can I trust you, Harry? Do you understand the lengths I am asking you to take? You’ll do this, won’t you?”
Sirius’s mind immediately imagined Headmaster Dumbledore, and his ever watchful gaze on the situation, like an omnipresent celestial being. He was controlling the decisions made for Draco, they both knew it. It was their reality.
The Dark Lord was there waiting for them, along with Yaxley, who was nearby a shelf ripping its books to pieces. Bellatrix could only stare at her master’s bald head as he faced away from her, over-seeing the windowed balcony with his hands behind his back.
Tommy stared at Harry. “Well, if you put it like that… I didn’t think about the consequences… you’re right, of course. Tevin also said, I should report him, you know. But he’s always concerned for my sake, so I didn’t take him seriously.” He paused, then asked, “What do you suggest, Harry?” He looked determined and even smiled a bit.
“I’m Carter Whiteside,” the blonde said, “Christie’s brother. I wanted to apologize for the little rascal. I’ve been told that she asked you out for me a few days ago? Just so you know – that was totally her idea, I had nothing to do with it.”
“Exactly,” Hermione said eagerly, “my Patronus has always been an otter and Ron’s used to be a Jack Russel.”
“Apparently the portrait collection of former Headmasters and Headmistresses is part of Hogwarts security system. It works as a kind of warning device and as long as the Imagic of the most famous and brilliant Headmaster is missing, the protection is depleted,” Harry explained.
Harry closed the Potions textbook with a snap and stood up. However bad his dancing skills might be, he felt damn lonely. If all his friends were at the damn party, he would go there too, damn it. He sighed, changed into his favourite green sweater and went downstairs.
Snape’s Imagic would be not altogether happy to let go of the dog again, Harry mused looking at Sylvia, who blushed some more. Which reminded Harry of Draco.
“Of course, Master Harry Potter Sir,” Kreacher looked mortified, “and Kreacher is so very sorry that he did not find out anything useful! Kreacher asked all the Maiden-elves – that’s what we call them. But none of them had seen any Imagic in a place where it’s not supposed to be! Otherwise Kreacher would have told Master immediately! Kreacher begs Master to forgive him!” The House-elf budged closer to the nearest wall and motioned as if he needed to bang his head against it any moment now.
She shook her head. “We also have to keep in mind Draco never got along well with his uncle. In fact, Taurus Malfoy has been known to despise and envy his nephew for being heir to the Malfoy legacy. Just ask his daughter about it! Headmistress McGonagall must be aware of this family matter as well.”
The rest of the morning Harry spent browsing through the library of No 12 collected by the Black family over centuries. All the shelves were full so fortunately Mundungus Fletcher had stayed clear of the library and not nicked any book. As was to be expected some of the volumes dealt with dark magic, which could still be quite useful for his intended career of becoming an Auror.
Harry felt as if Ginny had dropped a bomb. His friends were staring at him. Ron looked as if hit by a truck. Hermione seemed surprised, while having a light bulb moment at the same time – in fact her expression was oddly familiar from watching her solving arithmancy problems.
Finally Harry went to the Guest House’s common room after dinner. He had rarely been there in the evenings, as the novelty of having his own private room had been more tempting than any want for company. Like most nights before, Ron and Hermione retreated to their respective rooms at exactly the same time. Harry strongly suspected, Hermione had done something to the wall between their door-to-door rooms. Most probably she had managed to create a cosy two-room-apartment for the two of them. It must be nice to have some privacy with one’s lover, Harry thought.
“What do you mean, he’s missing?” Harry was confused, “He’ll just be visiting some other painting in the castle, don’t you think?”
“In that case… how about me and Hermione stay in your room while you work out? She can give us the essentials when you come back… man, I just love your sofa, much more comfortable than ours… I mean, the one in my room,” Ron said.
“Nearly indestructible– and that is exactly why the portrait collection of former Headmasters and Headmistresses is so important to the castle’s security, Harry,” McGonagall explained, “If you remember the battle of Hogwarts, how the castle lay in ruins the next morning, broken windows, walls crumbling– why do you think, the Headmaster’s office was still in much better condition than the rest of the building?”
“Are they in danger? In real danger, I mean? Can the Imagics… can they be killed?” Harry asked. He had wondered for a while, why nobody seemed to be worried, that maybe Dumbledore’s Imagic had been destroyed already.
“Count yourself lucky but don’t pity me. Muggle school was great and I learned a lot. The school I attended is very progressive and one thing I really, really liked was the school’s gender awareness policy. We had support groups and discussions and a zero tolerance policy concerning gender related bullying, homophobia and any other kind of discrimination. Tell you what, I miss this at Hogwarts. In general our magical society is rather tolerant and our sole problem with hate crime seems to be racism against Muggle-borns. But I still feel that under the surface of tolerance there is in fact a lot of ignorance.”
Tommy squirmed. “Let’s just say Laddley is not my favourite teacher and I’m not his favourite student either.” He cleared his voice. “Fortunately I’m not interested in Muggle studies anyway as I’m Muggle-born myself.” He grinned again.
After Quidditch practice Ron headed back to Hermione and Harry took his broom to the owlery to take Otto for a flight. He had visited his pet several evenings and was always pleased to find Otto in good spirits and ready to fly with him, an experience Harry had not been able to give his pet as long as they were in London. It was wonderful to loop and swirl together in the autumn air. Down below he saw a group of students running through the grounds. Maybe that was Josh’s cross-country class? (Was that Cass’ white blond hair shining in the evening light? Or maybe her cousin’s?)
Ginny, Ron and Hermione all gasped with surprise and shouted at the same time, “That’s brilliant!” – “What?!” – “Wow!”
When they entered the great hall Harry gasped. The enchanted ceiling, the staff table at the front of the hall and even the bright banners at the walls were familiar enough, but the seating arrangements for the students were completely different. The four long house tables side by side, each of them decorated in house colours were gone. Instead there were seven smaller tables scattered around the room. The new arrivals had no idea where to sit but one of the tables close to the staff was fully occupied by smaller kids already.
Andromeda held Teddy firmly in her arms and said, “Hello Narcissa, hi Josh!” Seeing Harry’s astonishment she explained, “Josh and Nymphadora used to work as partners for some time.”
“I’ve got two time-slots of ‘Physical Education’ – whatever that is,” said Ron stuffing a forkful of bacon and eggs in his mouth “– om Momda’ amd Th’sday aft’noon.”
Harry exhaled deeply and finally allowed himself to act, to do what he had wanted to do since his first glimpse inside – he approached Draco to free him from his bonds.
“Fine, really glad to be back at school,” Harry said slightly out of breath as they were climbing a staircase at the end of the corridor, “apart from disappearing Imagics, I’d be totally happy… but that just sucks.”
Checking his appearance in the mirror he was quite satisfied. He tried in vain to do something with his hair. Well, if Draco had liked him for two years already, his messy hairstyle probably didn’t matter.
Not long after the Malfoys’ proud winged messenger had taken off with Harry’s acceptance, Ginny left for the Burrow – and Harry relaxed. He liked to spend time with Ginny, of course he did. But frankly – it was also a bit awkward, especially if they were alone. Harry could not help wondering, whether Ginny was really content with being just friends? Maybe she was disappointed, that he had made no move to hook up again? But Harry had no desire to do that, it did not feel right anymore.
Flitwick raised his voice, “I repeat: Mr Potter is in charge. He will report any disobedience to me and I will not hesitate to take points off your house, understood?”
Harry looked at his watch. Six minutes. He had already wasted six precious minutes – but he couldn’t bring himself to ring the bell. Half past seven – wasn’t that way too early to disturb someone on a Saturday morning? Draco would probably be awake but what about his host?
Harry’s stomach clenched and he gulped. “No, no… of course not. Just asking… Ginny is… she is like a sister to me. I don’t want her to get hurt, that’s all.”
Harry stepped inside and immediately knew something had gone wrong. The present Headmistress looked stern and some of the former headmasters’ and headmistresses’ Imagics seemed to be even terrified and shocked, as many of them talked or shouted at the same time.
As if the sudden sight of his least favourite fellow student was not enough to startle Harry, something even more surprising happened: another boy came darting out of the house and flung himself around Draco, who – to Harry’s uttermost shock – returned the hug. Draco Malfoy embracing any other human being with feeling, let alone another teenage boy, was a sight Harry most certainly had never expected to lay eyes on.
Harry suddenly remembered Andromeda’s comment about her sister’s marriage and he was horrified. Narcissa Black had been forced by her family to marry a man, who did not love her, but even despised women in general? Just because he was immensely rich and needed a wife to give birth to an heir? The Black family must have been quite as dysfunctional as the Malfoys.
Harry suddenly remembered McGonagall’s behaviour in the evening, certain glances she had exchanged with Hermione… maybe McGonagall had known exactly what she was doing, distracting the Aurors like that? If the Headmistress was on their side – he hardly dared to hope so, but that would make such a difference!
Josh volunteered to support Harry, as some of the newcomers were hardly able to swim at all and Harry gladly accepted his offer. Josh got into the pool to assist, while Harry gave his advice from the pool-side. Together they had made a really good team, Harry thought. He was quite glad to work with the beginners, they certainly needed his full attention but at least they were too busy keeping their heads above the water to give him adoring looks.
“Most certainly, Healer! Let’s go to my office, as soon as these gentlemen have left us, shall we?” The matron nodded at Harry, Josh and Laddley.
“Harry,” she had said, “you are a good person, I would trust you with my life – come to think of it, I already did – and you’re really handsome in your ruffled sort of way, but… I think I rather prefer dating someone, who does not feel like yet another brother to me. I’m just glad you feel the same.”
Harry turned to look at Ron and Hermione with raised eyebrows. What about the eighth-years, what about them?
“Hey, Harry!” Ron shouted, “Brilliant choice you’ve made – but you know what? That colour you’ve picked reminds me of your –“
This time his eyes met Draco’s, who seemed to hesitate for a second before he walked towards Harry and asked, “What in Merlin’s name has really happened between you, Hillborogh and Laddley? The rumour mill is doing overtime. Did Laddley insult you? Did you hex him?”
McGonagall sighed again. “I didn’t even have to ask her, Harry. She and Cassy were with me, here at Hogwarts, on that very day. They came to see me, mainly to talk about Cassy attending Hogwarts and her upcoming Transfiguration exam. Not that she needed coaching, as she was doing very well already. Draco stayed back at Mella’s house alone, at least that’s what he was supposed to do. No one can testify for his whereabouts on that day.”
The boar dissolved into thin air and Harry stared at the only Patronus left, a beautiful silvery swan. He had assumed Draco’s Patronus to be very elegant – and was therefore startled when the bird spoke with Blaise Zabini’s booming voice.
“… in the end we all had tea together and strangely enough it was quite nice. Mind you, Narcissa Malfoy is still not my favourite person in the world but she really tried to be sociable… seemed to be much more relaxed,” Harry said. “Listening to her and Andromeda refreshing childhood memories makes you wonder… put my years living with the Dursleys rather into perspective. It’s a miracle that Andromeda turned out to be such a nice woman and managed to escape that horrible family.”
Sitting in Andromeda’s cosy kitchen for their usual Friday lunch Harry suddenly felt a well-known lump in his throat. He admired Andromeda’s strength in coping with the fact that her very own sister had been the killer of her only daughter.
Harry laughed. “No worries, Carter, it’s alright! Christie’s brother, huh? Well you must be used to her recklessness, I guess? Quite a handful, your sister… don’t get me wrong, I think she’s brilliant, a true Gryffindor.”
“Take our lot upstairs to the eighth-years’ common room, will you, Nev? The rest of our cohort can either join you or stay in their private rooms. I’ll let you know as soon as the coast is clear at Gryffindor Tower.”
Hermione was there as well and in the afternoon Ron and Hermione teamed against Ginny and Harry for a game of double Quidditch, just like many holidays before. When George dropped by and took Hermione’s position, the pace of the game increased. Soon enough Harry was out of breath, heart pounding and blood ranging in his ears. He was alive, having fun with his friends, whom he loved. And that was all that mattered.
“Three years ago, a friend of ours decided to celebrate his birthday at a club. Frankie and I rarely go to gay bars but for that occasion we went. It was fun, actually… until late at night the owner of the club asked for my help. He said that there was a boy with a false ID at the bar who seemed far too young for this place and he wanted to make sure the kid was alright, before he sent him away. Someone had told him that I work with young people and that’s why he addressed me.
“Greg’s mum was a close friend of Abe’s, that’s what he told me,” Hagrid said, “and Abe’s doing well enough, I should think, the inn’s got lots of customers lately. Many of the regulars are better off now, after Voldemort’s gone… people like meself, with a bit of an awkward parentage… didn’t dare to be seen in public before and now they can go to the pub again whenever they like!”
Cass blushed, “That’s very sweet of you to say, Harry. Well… you know, sometimes I think, being shipped off to Aunt Mella was the best thing, that could have happened to me… especially compared to Draco’s fate… anyway, where was I? Taurus hated his gay brother, his delicate nephew and his tom-boy daughter. He was convinced, he himself was supposed to be the true Malfoy heir and frankly, I think he would have rejoiced, if both Lucius and Draco had dropped dead.”
Harry looked at Otto. His pet had been at this unknown place – if only he could ask the owl what it was like? Otto was fast asleep now, sitting on the back of a chair. This was exactly how Harry’s pet spent every day lately. Apparently he did not want to sleep at the owlery during day-time between his nightly flights and Harry was way too grateful for Otto’s efforts to ban him from his room. Without Otto, he would not be able to keep in touch with Draco – which would make the whole situation unbearable.
“I don’t know the exact number, but the Ministry of Magic does, as any painter who is capable has to register at the Ministry – quite the same as for other special abilities of witchards, like Animagics or Metamorphmagics. The Ministry likes to know who’s capable of what, in case something goes horribly wrong.”
As soon as they were within earshot Tommy shouted grinning widely, “Congrats! Well, well – I’m never going to hear the end of it, because this one –” he nodded towards his lover, “– has insisted for years that you two are an item in the making.”
“What?” Harry shouted. Draco had only danced with girls the previous evening, he was sure about that. Was he making fun of Harry’s sexual orientation? Cass must have told him by now.
“Yes… he is actually quite polite to me, which is a bit strange,” Hermione said, “not only has he stopped calling me Mudblood – “
“Well my family is pure-blood and none of us writes letters like that! I just don’t like her… and you have done more than enough for their lot. Why can’t she leave you alone?”
“I’m so sorry, Minerva,” he said, “there’s no signature on this painting and I’m not familiar with the artist’s style… I still have no idea who has painted it.”
“My thoughts precisely.” Josh nodded. “When Kingsley told me yesterday evening about my suspension, I knew my time at Hogwarts was up and I decided to take my chance and asked for Professor Slughorn’s opinion. What happens, if someone is polyjuiced, while being tracked?” Josh grinned. “Slughorn was intrigued. He just said, ‘
“Harry, good to see you,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep voice, “although I would have preferred to meet again for a less disturbing reason.”
With a final nod from Ms Malfoy and a broad grin from Cass they disappeared into the Manor. Harry hurried to the aviary eager to get out of the place before Josh arrived. He certainly did not want to meet his crush so soon after that dreadful letter.
“Is that so?” The blonde man chuckled while tucking the cloak away. “Well, well… maybe I’m not the most rightful of owners but luckily I don’t have much of a conscience either, so this makes no difference to me. As you can see I have two Deathly Hollows in my possession right now. I assume even a simpleton like you can guess what I want next?”
The following evening Harry presented his new pet named Otto to his two best friends and gave them a detailed report of the visit to the Manor and his strange but all in all quite polite encounter with Ms Malfoy. They were sitting at the kitchen table of No 12 after a dinner of home-made pizza – recently Harry had taken up cooking, mostly Italian dishes.
Instead of shooting back Harry went for the Zabini-approach once more. “Sorry you’ve missed me so much,” he smirked and was rewarded with Draco’s usual blush.
Before Harry even had a chance to ask, what she was talking about, there was a noise at the end of the train car and the man himself appeared, walking slowly towards them.
Harry took his tea to the sofa in front of the other bay window and looked out into the still dark grounds. The eastern sky showed a first hint of twilight. His tea was strong and tasted perfect. Nothing but the occasional soft sound of Draco Malfoy turning a page of his book was to be heard. Harry felt suddenly very calm and content as if the world was in total balance and everything exactly as it should be…
“By eliminating suspects we might be able to clear the incident board from irrelevant facts,” the Headmistress added pointing at the board.
McGonagall turned to Flitwick. “Filius, can you please do something to calm her down? Before my eardrums split?”
“I’m quite surprised to see you, Potter,” said Draco with raised eye-brows, ”didn’t expect you to spend your spare-time with students only. Don’t you miss Professor Jordan terribly?”
They both stopped eating and just stared at each other. Josh looked mostly surprised and maybe, Harry hoped, a little bit pleased – but kept quiet.
“What?! You mean… just like the Malfoy painting? So Taurus Malfoy didn’t invent this spell? Anybody who got a hold of this book can do it?” Harry exclaimed.
“Hello - good to see the musician who has entertained me all morning,” the Healer replied, “name’s Joe O’Malley and I’m living downstairs, just below this room – so I’ve heard you play!”
“No, shush Harry! You need to keep quiet as your vocal chords were injured, same as a good part of your skin. You’ve got burns all over your arms and legs. The fumes nearly killed you, Hogsmeade’s firewitchards pulled you out at the very last moment – but you’ll be alright soon enough. Madame Pomfrey has done a really great job, even the Healers from St. Mungo’s say so. You’ll be shipshape in no time!”
Next morning Harry woke up even earlier than usually. He decided to take a shower and get dressed before having early morning tea. Although he would never be as stylish as Draco Malfoy, he could at least make an effort. Wearing his best pair of jeans and the dark green sweater Andromeda had given him for a farewell present, Harry opened the door to the common room – it was vacant.
Blaise’s mouth fell open for a second, before he grinned widely and said, ”Hey, Malfoy, whatever happened to your sense of humour? Or is this you protecting Potter? Interesting indeed…”
Harry sat down, sipped his tea and tried to digest the news – so Draco went by the name of David and stayed with Odie and Frank, a middle aged gay couple? How had that happened? And who was Martin McBride?
“Hook up with him! That’ll restore your reputation in no time! Even the Ministry might reconsider their strict observation of superhero Potter’s lover! Not to mention the public opinion! The Prophet will love it, I can see the headline already – ‘
“Mr Potter,” Gregory Laddley said, “may I help you? I assume you’re moving back to your room at the guest house?” And he reached for Harry’s bag.
“Would you come with me?” Harry asked. “I think that would make the visit even enjoyable. And maybe the scones are nice?”
Harry exhaled deeply. “Excellent, Ariana, I’m sure your brother – both of your brothers! – will be very proud of you. So whenever you’re ready, tell me or tell Daisy, ok?” He gave her, what he hoped to be an encouraging smile.
“Oh, I sure appreciate the effort,” Harry said staring at his best mate. “But unfortunately seeing you two snogging might just have the opposite effect.”
Josh nodded. “I’ll see what I can do. Of course I’ll have to ask for permission at the Ministry but I guess you might be able to return early, maybe tomorrow if not today. And I have to check in with Mrs Malfoy before we can leave.”
It drove Harry nuts that nobody had a clue about Taurus Malfoy’s present place of hiding. He found it hard to believe that the Auror Department did everything they could to find Draco’s uncle and wished he could go searching himself. But he was obliged to stay at school of course.
But Tommy had missed Laddley’s swimming class last week, Harry suddenly remembered. He watched Tommy doing two more laps. The guy was really good, maybe even better than Harry and Blaise, who were supposed to be the top swimmers. Why had he stopped attending swimming lessons? And why had he not been picked by Laddley for special training like Harry and Blaise in the first place?
He had ignored the ugly feeling inside his chest, and proceeded to lead his army into the Palace of Voldemort with a sole motivation of achieving victory, defeat the Death Eaters and overthrown the King's throne.
He never bothered himself with the underworld, as he didn't think it was important for him to know. He was only a subordinate of the Heavens' Realm after all; he received his assignment and he executed them. He viewed demons as other creatures of another realm, best to ignore.
Draco snorted at the ridiculous scene and turned to Potter to see him watching him closely. He blinked at him, “What?”
“That's- a really big development, Harry.” Hermione smiled, and Harry gratefully smiled back at her when he realised it. He straightened up as he looked at his friends with bewilderment.
“Thank God for that then,” Weasley nodded approvingly at him. “Because you see, Harry’s been- ugh!” He suddenly coughed, holding onto his stomach, as Potter faked a loud laugh, patting on Weasley’s back rather harshly in Draco’s eyes. “You shouldn't speak while eating, Ron!”
"Shut up," said Draco, and gave Harry a light slap, but curled his body closer, getting comfortable in Harry's arms. "Now tell me what about Albus and Scorpius when they were three."
Harry growls playfully as he pulls Draco off his seat and push him softly down the table, and his boyfriend automatically wraps his legs around his waist. Harry bends down to kiss the pale expose neck before he growls again in his ear.
He had taken his twins to have their breakfast near the Black Lake, and somehow Pansy and Blaise came and joined them with a handful of food in their hands. Not even ten minutes after that, they were joined by the four Gryffindors; Granger and She Weasley’s hands were full with stacks of books while Potter and Weasley brought the food.
"Malfoy came to me this morning and accused me of telling the truth!" exclaimed Seamus. "How did you know?"
He swallowed. “Are you, are you saying that I managed to convert you?” He asked dumbly, unnoticed on how his voice suddenly turned croaky.
Memories of soft lips against his vanished in an instant as Harry snapped out of his thoughts. He blinked rapidly until his eyes refocused on Malfoy who was watching him with a slight frown on his face.
Harry sobbed, turning to face his lover's beautiful face for the last time and dropped a chaste kiss to the parted pair of lips lovingly, before he turned towards the sparkles and lights. "Please let him be where he meant to be. Please take care of him for me."
“Ronald!” Hermione hissed, giving the red haired boy a warning look that got him to immediately shut up, and send Malfoy his heated glares instead.
Harry thought it was adorable and grinned. "I had my ways." he winked, heart weirdly calmed now that the adrenaline has settled down but he felt as if he could fly. "Now that I finally got you here, we can-"
Malfoy seemed to be nailed to the ground, standing like a statue. Harry watched as Malfoy swallowed when Henry halted in front of him.
“Brilliant! Now that everyone settles down.” said Malfoy all of a sudden, clasping his hands together and taking his seat next to Albus. The boy instantly latched himself to his father, mumbling apologies with his face buried in his robes. Malfoy replied his forgiveness in a hushed words, kissing the top of the boy's head lovingly.
“It's your fault that he's angry.” His brother scoffed, curling his small arms around Harry's bicep. Harry stiffened but unnoticed by the boy.
Draco gasped, eyes widened as the blushed on his face deepened, immediately took a look at his surroundings as if he had just realised that he was still at the Great Hall. "Merlin." he said, giving him an astonishing look. "You are mad."
“Of course, papa!” They chorused, and Draco softly shushed them down when Madam Pince shot them a look.
Harry had to agree. The two boys were practically skipping through their steps, as they followed McGonagall proceeding towards the High Table. The boys took their seats when McGonagall conjured a high chair for the both of them and Harry had to admit that the sight was pretty adorable.
A man who will give him two wonderful children, who were risking their life by travelling back in time to save his life.
He felt overwhelmed suddenly. It was definitely tough for him to go through the eighth year even having Blaise and Pansy by his side. He barely sleeps with all the nightmares, he doesn't have the appetite, he felt down all the time, he was not happy and he always felt like there was a bloody hippogriff resting on his chest.
, was a definite description of a menace. He was loud, obnoxious, and the perfect example of a person whose job was to make Harry's life difficult. He has been, for the past seventh year of knowing each other.
That tone also indicated that the person who will be on the receiving end would experience a great deal of justice. It didn't sit well with Albus to know that the person would be their older dad, even though he was pretty sure that their older dad was very much capable of defending himself.
"Blimey, Scorp!" huffed Albus, scrambling for his dad's Marauder's Map from Scorpius under the Cloak, "You had one job!"
As if those words were magical, Draco took a deep breath as he nodded again before he slowly peeled his clothes off one by one. He rested his eyes to the wall, occasionally locked them with Henry who simply gave him a reassuring smile, picking up Draco’s scattered clothes and folding them nicely before he put them aside.
He couldn't help but smile as he recalled that they had made love for the first time to each other that night; whispering forgiveness into each other's lips, confessing their desires, and secrets between wandering hands, eyes never leave one another.
"Never mind, I can't remember clearly anyway... it's just... " Harry shrugged. He was well aware that the real reason for his lack of enthusiasm about the ball was his falling out with Draco. Since last Sunday all dancing related past-times had lost any appeal for him.
“Now you might try to reproduce it, Harry, to check whether you’ve got everything right,” suggested Kingsley.
“No, I’m afraid not,” Harry answered, “I just need to talk to Daisy…” and he stepped to the painting of the Wizard’s Wood well aware, that all the students were listening in.
“Hi Harry, didn’t know you come here on Sunday evenings as well,” said Tommy, “have been all on my own before. I’m Tommy by the way, Tommy Hillborogh.” He didn’t seem to be out of breath although he had taken the last two laps really fast.
“You might even find the obstacle in question not as insurmountable as you think.” Cass smiled, “well… let’s have dinner, shall we?”
To Harry’s utter amazement, McGonagall turned to Snape’s portrait and said, ”Severus, as you’ve been the one most insistent to consult with Harry, you might as well start the roundup about what has happened.”
“Merlin’s beard! What has Taurus Malfoy to do with our case?” Kingsley said with a frown. “He’s one of the most wanted Death Eaters still on the run! The man was abroad for many years but came back for the final months of the war. We believe him to be responsible for some severe attacks on Muggle villages. As far as we know, he has escaped to the continent after the Battle of Hogwarts. We have some of our best Foreign Affairs Aurors on his trail but with no luck, so far.”
They climbed through the portrait hole and stepped down the staircase, away from the Fat Lady who looked far too curious for Harry’s taste.
“Care for a little outing after dinner? Wiltshire maybe?” Harry asked Ron and Hermione when he sat down at his usual place in the Great Hall half an hour later. He beamed at them before he added, “You are invited as well, Cass.”
Tommy beamed at Harry, “Wow, that is so cool! Tevin will go crazy! For two years he’s had this fixed idea about you being… – I mean, is it ok if I tell him?”
“Well, thanks, you were perfectly right.”  Harry smiled, realizing with great satisfaction that Draco had been so attentive about Harry’s concerns that he knew Hedwig’s name.
Andromeda continued, “But after I got married we had no contact at all for years. I do not know what to make of her, how far I can trust her… and I think meeting her for real could give me a clue of who she is today. But I certainly do not want to intrude, so please, Harry, be honest with me. I don’t want to be there if this feels even the slightest bit awkward for you?”
“Don’t you like to instruct? I always assumed you do, seeing you are such a gifted teacher. Dumbledore’s Army, swimming lessons – we had the impression you thoroughly enjoyed that?” McGonagall asked.
“As the pavilion is no longer used as a playhouse, I have made it my habit to take my afternoon tea here. I do not want it to be completely vacant. Shall we?” Narcissa Malfoy opened the door and all three of them had to bow their heads a little under the lintel.
“This is ridiculous,” Harry said barely keeping his temper, “why should Draco do something like that? Why risk his probation? He has nothing to gain by abducting Imagics!”
“But that is… outrageous!” exclaimed Flitwick. “That would be a serious violation of present law! I simply do not believe this, you must be mistaken, Mr Potter!”
Early Saturday morning Draco didn’t show up at the common room for the second time and Harry wasn’t even surprised. Draco had been far from relaxed during the last few morning encounters, his mood swings had increased significantly since… well, since Harry’s official outing, in fact.
Harry could feel her fingers digging into his forearm while talking. He was deeply disturbed by Cass’ story. And although he was repelled by Narcissa Malfoy’s part in it, he had to give her credit for her honesty and the obvious remorse she was showing.
Professor Flitwick tried to control the situation. “Quiet!” he squeaked, “Stop!” – without much effect.
“Seriously?” Cass crossed her arms in front of her chest and gave both Draco and Harry a stern look. “You think two adult witches are unfit for adventure without a wizard for company?”
Hermione nodded and said, “First I concentrate on a mental image of the colour I aim for and then –,“ she pointed her wand, shouted, “
Draco picked up his cup and, to Harry’s surprise, sat down on a comfortable arm-chair next to Harry’s sofa, not at his usual place across the room. And Draco was without a book this morning – he seemed to be in a talkative mood instead.
“Remember what Hermione just said – when the painting was discovered, she sat at a card table with three abducted Imagics!
“Well you should be, because it’s disgusting. And that’s what I did, that’s what I am familiar with. I know how to fuck but I have no idea how to… how to be close to a guy. Truth be told, it scares the shit out of me, the way I feel about you. That’s why I kept fighting for distance two years ago. But this year, with Cass at my side, Cass who became friends with you so easily – I thought, maybe we also could be friends… just friends, you know? And it worked for a while, didn’t it? Until Blaise, that bleeding git, had to expose me.”
“Sorry, I can’t,” said Harry, “McGonagall has asked to see me at four p.m. in her office and I have no idea how long that’ll take… what about after dinner?” He was actually quite pleased she had requested to see him.
“And such a great loss that would have been to the wizarding world.” Hermione said with a disapproving look on her face. “Anyway, Josh Jordan going along with the whole thing proves nothing at all. Everyone knows Aurors are not exactly the most law abiding employees of the Ministry.”
“Ah, I see,” she gave Harry a curious look, “well, besides tedious bureaucracy there are at least some advantages in being the Headmistress. One of them – nobody will scold me for being late to dinner.” She gave Harry a quick smile before she turned to Laddley again.
“Thank you, Mr Potter, for coming. Please sit down,” her tension seemed to fade a bit – and so did Harry’s.
Hagrid was delighted to see his favourite student and crossed the room with a few giant steps, “Harry! Good to see you – and you too, Neville and Seamus! But… where’s Ron and Hermione?” he looked around and seemed quite confused, as if he could not believe, that Harry was without his best friends.
“Her Ladyship knows a great deal about everything,” McGonagall said with a smile, “this is an excellent idea, Ms Granger! Yes, please do so… but”, she looked at her watch, “maybe tomorrow … it is already very late.”
“Quiet please!” Josh shouted, before he addressed Ron with a smile, “Your mother is quite right of course. For the time it will take any Patronus to change, it won’t deliver messages. I take it you had no trouble with it before? Well, then you should be fine again as soon as the change is completed.”
“Finally someone other than myself quoting from that book – what a nice surprise,” Hermione said carefully.
Carter seemed relieved. “She sure is! The rest of our family is all Ravenclaw, everybody acts with careful consideration – but that will not do for Christie. She’s just –“
, which got Neville interested, but seemed rather dull to most of Harry’s friends –  quite the contrary to Professor Tharros’ fierce description of an ancient martial arts technique she was practicing. Harry thought, her course sounded terrifying, but both Ginny and Cass were thrilled about it.
Just like he had assumed the other envelope was imprinted with the Malfoys’ coat of arms. What did Ms Malfoy want from him this time, he wondered? Well, her letter would have to wait.
“What?” Frank looked affronted at his jumper which was equally red as Odie’s but with a reindeer pattern. “You think this isn’t smart enough for a wedding?”
Cass beamed at Harry, “Oh Harry, Draco will be del–…,” she caught herself before adding, “It’s none of my business, but I guess you are in for a surprise.” She grinned mysteriously.
The witch with the squirrel-topped head sobbed, “The silly girls wanted to investigate! They thought sticking together they would be safe! I told them to stay put but they would not listen to me!”
Ron grinned rising his fork, “Not a chance, mate. As my very active sex-life happens to increase my appetite – can I finish your breakfast?”
“Nope,” said Ron hands crossed behind his head. “I’ve learned my lesson. Never interfere with a brilliant mind, if you can help it. You read along, 'Mione, and make sense of all that, I’ll listen to your summery later.”
Of course everybody wanted to know, why Harry and Tommy had missed dinner, but they managed to side-step all questions without giving anything away. They had promised McGonagall to keep the whole matter secret. If Laddley left, everybody would know soon enough what had happened. Both of them didn’t think it very likely, that he might stay, but if he was indeed willing to change, he would need a fair chance.
?!” Draco stared at Harry wide-eyed, “Merlin, you’re really slow off the mark and apparently have no gaydar as well. I most certainly don’t fancy Ginny or any other girl.”
Harry had hoped to talk to Aberforth, but the pub’s owner was nowhere to be seen. Harry had last seen Albus Dumbledore’s brother during the Battle of Hogwarts. As far as he knew, the pub had been violated and raided by Death Eaters that night and he wanted to ask Aberforth about it. How was he doing anyway? Harry decided to ask for him.
His friends sat down and Harry approached the bar, which was occupied by some rather dubious customers. He looked around again. The only familiar face in the room belonged to Gregory Laddley, Hogwarts’ new Muggle Studies teacher and Harry’s future swimming instructor, who sat all by himself at a small table brooding over his drink.
McGonagall sighed, “Headmaster Black, please calm down. We need to focus and we need to keep our minds clear. Hysterics are never helpful. I promise, we will get to the bottom of this unpleasant affair. I am not even sure, Amanda and Serena are missing, they might just be a little late and return with important evidence.”
“What?” Harry gawped at her. “I mean, I’ve heard that several times now, but from you… I thought you were so happy when Ginny and I were together?”
“Oh, don’t you underestimate Harry’s ability of getting himself in trouble, you should know better by now, ‘Mione,” Ron teased, then turned to Harry, “Maybe she’s just mad at you, for not signing up with her football class. Which is totally your loss, by the way… football’s brilliant…”
The moment Harry heard Ron mentioning Cass’ name – the penny dropped! He gasped. What an idiot he had been! Of course Ginny hadn’t snogged Draco – but Cassy! Suddenly everything made sense. How could he have been so ignorant? It was obvious – the girls were ever so close, they cuddled all the time and barely were able to keep their hands off each other – they were in love.
“Which leaves you, Madame, being presently our only possible source of information,” McGonagall said with a stern look at the naked beauty.
“I tried to intervene, even suggested Tim and I should return home as there clearly was no party. But Tim didn’t want to leave and Lucius insisted as well. ‘
The trap was to be set right before Harry’s and Blaise’s next special training lesson, which was scheduled for late Wednesday afternoon. Therefore Harry was a bit distracted at the beginning of Wednesday’s last lesson which happened to be Charms. He took his usual seat at the back of the class next to Neville.
“Hagrid says you know our new Muggle Studies teacher?” Harry asked Aberforth. “We were curious about him, ‘cause Arthur Weasley never mentioned his name and Arthur’s supposed to know everybody involved in Muggle Studies.”
After a short consultation with his fellow instructors, Harry clapped his hands. The crowd fell silent immediately.
What an extraordinary sight of beauty! Harry exhaled deeply. The whole scene had taken a good ten minutes – never before had Harry’s Patronus lasted for such a long time! He looked at Draco and was not surprised to see, that his eyes were shining suspiciously.
“Alright, alright. But I’ll send Otto back with the cloak as soon as I’m ready to disapparate, you might need it for the investigation,” Draco said before he added with a wicked grin, “by the by – if you want to threaten me in earnest, you should not suggest shoving anything up my ass… sounds more like a promise to me.”
Harry was stunned by this unexpected praise. Narcissa Malfoy calling him wise! And he very much doubted to actually be a good listener – he knew well enough how impatient he could be, how often he had interrupted Dumbledore or simply anybody who gave him advice. Although… maybe he was getting better at listening lately.
Otto sailed to Harry’s shoulder hooting softly and Harry felt somewhat comforted by his pet. He sighed.
“Of course not,” cried Flitwick and Harry and his friends just nodded. It was quite embarrassing to hear about stuff like that in the presence of a teacher.
“I’m afraid it is. The Headmistress promised to keep us updated as soon as she learns more about the matter. At the moment the Healers try to figure what has happened to him – the diagnosis is yet unclear. They are fighting to keep his vital functions intact. That is all we know for the time being.”
“I know!” Draco shouted back, “I’m going to the gym! You, Professor Jordan, gave us the option to choose between swimming and working out at the gym. Well, I’ve changed my mind, okay?”
“No, Ms Malfoy believes, the Blacks probably banned him for falling out with his family. It’s the same thing for Andromeda, no chance either. So Ms Malfoy offered to give it a try and I think I’ll let her – if the Ministry permits her coming to my house, that is.”
The Invisibility Cloak would only cover one adult on a broom anyway. Hermione and Ron had already retreated to their own rooms and Harry most certainly did not want to get them in trouble.
“She had no objection that I tell you, by the way. She knows, we work best as a team. And Hagrid… well, no one in his right mind would think Hagrid is involved. But she does not want to rule out any one of the other teachers yet. Snape’s Imagic totally agrees with her, probably because he used to be a double agent himself.”
Draco hummed conversationally, but he couldn’t disagree with her more if he tried. The smell of hot, partially-consumed animal parts and owl shit was making him dizzy. “Are you not interested in eating in the hall with everyone else?”
How? No one had been around. How long was he followed? Draco looked up in time to see someone squat down in front of him. It was the Hufflepuff boy.
The last two students up in the Slytherin dorms happened to be the two people Draco was hoping to see most.
There was always Luna. How exactly did she manage being 16 years old in a private boarding school swarming with horny, unmated Alphas and still remain unbonded? She never mentioned any particular difficulties with her magic, in fact at first scent you wouldn’t have been able to tell if she was an Omega at all with her stink pouch and heavy hand on pheromone suppressants. He recalled her also mentioning on the train she was fortunate enough to present early like an Omega was supposed to, but Lucia did too and she couldn’t escape their dreaded fate.
“Going to Hogsmeade because I want to talk to Aberforth again…” Harry paused. They did not know about his last meeting with Draco or about him assisting Draco’s flight and that was the main reason, why he had avoided talking to them all week.
“Always the tone of surprise,” Ron replied with a smile at his girlfriend, who grinned and snuggled up to him.
“Oh, Harry… we are not talking about Magical Arts anymore, you’re aware of that?” She smiled at him for a brief moment in a most fragile way, “but it’s probably all for the best that you know… Taurus was always immensely jealous of his elder brother, he did not hold Lucius worthy of being the heir and owner of the manor.” She sighed deeply. “You know what Taurus’ homophobia did to me– well, at the root of it was his aversion against his brother’s homosexuality.”
“You’re welcome! Instructing was actually great fun. Blaise and Tommy thought so as well,” Harry said and Tavin beamed at Harry for bringing up his lover’s name.
“Yeah, insane, boring, stupid – you keep telling us every evening. Makes one wonder, why you still keep watching?” Seamus teased.
“That’s Cass Malfoy, she’s a cousin of… him,” Harry made a vague gesture at Draco, avoiding to use his first name. On the other hand he could hardly continue calling him ‘
Harry and Tommy indeed had a plan. They had decided on provoking Laddley to gay-bash again in front of the most reliable witness– in front of Harry Potter. Nobody in his right mind would challenge Harry’s testimony.
The formerly naked lady was again dressed in her elegant morning gown, the one she had worn when the painting had been discovered. Now she was sitting on the chaise longue with Headmistress Nightingale’s Imagic next to her, holding her hand. Headmistress Da Ponte’s Imagic stood right behind them.
“Mr Potter! That is most generous of you, thank you! The Malfoys have been collecting Filial Items for centuries and this one is of course very special to me,” Narcissa blushed again.
Should he still go to the common room this morning to have tea as usual? And would Draco be there? Only one way to find out, Harry thought and grabbed for his sweatpants.
Which made Harry feel even more stupid. “Oh, I see… well, thank you and – listen, I apologise for what I said before,” he said, “the painting is lovely, I’m sorry you have to abstain from it for a while.”
The meeting started with a bang – at least for Flitwick, Ron and Hermione. Headauror and Headmistress informed the others of Josh Jordan’s dismissal from Hogwarts as he had confessed to the removal of Draco’s tracking spell. They explained, that Josh was temporarely suspended from Auror duties, while at the same time they considered his involvement in the abduction of Imagics most unlikely. Josh Jordan had been thoroughly interrogated and his answers gave no reason to doubt his innocence in that matter.
“Hey, guys,” Josh called, “back from the village? Zabini said you would not be gone for long.” He turned to Harry, “You have a minute to spare, Harry?”
As the four humans took a seat, the Imagic sat down in the painted wing chair, fully dressed again to Harry’s relief – Snape’s bare feet had disturbed him nearly as much as McGonagall’s accusations.
He paused for a second. “What you can’t know is that yesterday in the late afternoon Auror Jordan came to the Headmistress’ office to share some observations. Your assumption, Ms Granger, about the use of Polyjuice is about the essence of it.” Flitwick beamed at her and seemed quite rapt away. “Very clever of you to come to this conclusion without know­ledge of Auror Jordan’s findings!”
"Next Saturday at dinner time we will draw the topic. Professor Tharros and myself will help you thereafter with creating your costumes. Just one more thing: To give everybody a good chance to find their balance on the dance floor, from now on we will have dance parties every Saturday evening right after dinner until ten p.m. – starting today! So if you want to shake your limbs, come to the gym tonight – singles, couples and threesomes – everybody is welcome!” With a bow and a final clap of hands Flitwick sat down again.
Both Ron and Harry knew exactly what Hermione meant. They had practiced defence spells once again and Josh always made them change partners. When it was Hermione’s turn to defend herself against Draco, he had been very careful and obviously not fighting full force.
Just two days before, Harry would have rejoiced in being addressed like that by Draco. But now he just murmured, “Good morning…” and barely mastered to fake a grin. He turned to the painting partly to avoid Draco’s eyes.
Yes, Harry had guessed correctly, the elegant witch with the classical profile was Nektaria Tharros, new head of his house and Transfiguration teacher. While clapping their welcome, every Gryffindor around Harry agreed, she looked both beautiful and terrifying. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Josh Jordan were greeted with cheers, some girls even screeched when McGonagall addressed Josh.
“As you insist, Ginevra, I’ll accompany you,” Draco sighed, “I’m not allowed to leave the school area anyway. Probation beats eighth-year status, apparently.”
Ms Silver’s Imagic lowered her eyes and whispered, “Delighted to make your acquaintance…” while Harry and his friends said their hellos.
“Sorry about that!” Ron apologised and Kreacher gawped at him wide-eyed. He was clearly not used to receive apologies from a wizard.
“Oh, I am quite sure you have reasons for your present opinion, but I don’t think they are good reasons! Let me be clear: If you want to stay, there are two things I need you to agree with. First – change your behaviour immediately. Second – be willing to change your mind as well. I know this is not something to be done in an instant. It will take time and effort. If you are willing to change, I will take care of appropriate arrangements to support your healing – because in my eyes you suffer from homophobia, which is a serious disease, Professor Laddley. Talking regularly with a qualified person might help you immensely, not only for the imminent situation but for all areas of your life.”
“Oh it truly is, Harry! Sending Ariana to the castle that night was your best idea ever! How fortunate that she turned up at Bellevue Beach of all places, just where Professor Flitwick made me stay with Pinkie,” Daisy agreed.
Bellatrix was dead. And the only feeling he had about her death was one of pure relief. He remembered her final battle well enough and it gave him the creeps how close Bellatrix had come to killing Hermione, Ginny or Luna. He had been deeply impressed by Molly finishing her for good to save the girls.
Aberforth nodded, “Makes sense. Maybe that’s another reason why Albus was always so fond of you… he saw a lot of himself in your character, I’m sure… but why this sudden interest in pure-blood traditions and Magical Arts, Harry?”
What had the letter suggested? The back-door was supposedly unlocked and Harry was expected to climb upstairs right into Aberforth’s sitting room. Well, this he would not do. His only chance was to outsmart his opponent by finding another way inside, grabbing Draco and making a run for the safety of the castle.
“Well, that’s… a surprise,” Harry stared at the coat of arms on the envelope which was well known to him. The Malfoys’ coat of arms. Ginny glanced over his shoulder while he ripped the envelope open. There was something slightly disappointing and even more astonishing about the name at the end of the short letter: Narcissa Malfoy had sent him a letter. An invitation actually.
“Good point. You are surprisingly naughty, Mr Potter – I mean this in the nicest possible way, of course.”
“And no, my… Taurus isn’t one of the present Imagic Masters. I remember him boasting about his abilities to charm and hex paintings in numerous ways, but he never managed to create an Imagic– with one exception, he has painted a fair number of self-portraits and those seem to be Imagics alright, but he never succeeded in creating any other Imagic. Which makes sense – he’s such a narcissist, whereas true Imagic Masters are supposed to be extremely kind-hearted and positive personalities. I think, he always envied them,” said Cass.
Harry was glad to have the corridor for himself alone. Josh and Draco were nowhere to be seen. Draco… what would he have to say about Harry being gay? Just a few weeks ago, before Harry had met Cass, he would have dreaded Malfoy’s reaction expecting nothing but verbal abuse. But Cass and Draco were really close and knowing how supportive the guy had been to his cousin, Harry had no idea what to expect. He was just glad Malfoy hadn’t been present when his closest friends found out.
Today’s lesson was about various ways of changing the size of stuff. Harry was reminded of little Teddy effortlessly growing and shrinking his tiny baby-nose… Teddy must have grown so much since Harry had last seen him. He sighed again and Draco snarled over his shoulder, “Stop distracting me, Potter!”
McGonagall sat down as well. “Spare me your house prejudices!” she snorted. “I am longing to get rid of this ridiculous structure once and for all! Actually I’m close to filing a request to our esteemed board of governors to dissolve the four houses!”
Draco looked up from his book. If Harry was not completely mistaken, he had listened in to their conversation all along. Draco searched the room until his eyes found Harry’s, who smiled encouragingly.
Hermione narrowed her eyes and stared at Harry. ”So you knew? How come you never mentioned it? Let us ramble about Josh, when we were having breakfast at The Early Bird?”
Harry’s heart ached seeing Cass so disappointed but he kept his game. “I’m sure the Aurors will sort this out and the sooner Draco turns up the better. I’ve been searching for him – no idea where he is…” He could not help noticing that Hermione and the Headmistress exchanged a significant glance but neither of them questioned his statement.
“Nah,” Ron grinned, “looks like she has yet another admirer…” and he nodded at one corner of the dance-floor. Harry followed his friends’ eyes – and his mouth fell open.
will tell me before you hook up with some bloke, right? Just give me a fair warning… let’s say a week before you start snogging?”
The air outside was fresh and cool. While they were waiting for the coaches to the castle Harry wondered how many of the students still could not see Thestrals after the war? He knew for sure that every single person who had fought in the battle of Hogwarts must see the skeletal horses by now. But what about Cass? Had she already encountered death?
“Of course, Harry, I understand,” she smiled, “looking forward to seeing you and Draco in the morning as usual!” She waved, kicked her heels in the birds back and Pinkie took off the ground with a piercing shriek. Obviously she didn’t read too much into Draco missing their morning routine twice – maybe Harry shouldn’t either…
“Well, Mr Weasley just found out whom I intend to hire as D.A.D.A. teacher replacing Auror Jordan – if the Board of School Governors permits it, that is,” the Headmistress explained.
“What’s up?” he asked rubbing first his eyes and then the stiff neck he had gained from sleeping crouched in his seat.
The tiny dog seemed to be aware of his given name because he jumped up, wagged his tail frantically and licked the Imagic’s hand.
“I am rather surprised but very glad to hear it, that you find Draco looks nice,” Narcissa Malfoy replied with a strange little smile.
The festive dinner was served at seven. At the sound of another gong everybody had to clear the dance-floor and dozens of round gala tables appeared, loaded with food and set for thirteen guests each. To Harry’s disappointment the seating arrangement was different from everyday meals. He had been looking forward to sitting face to face with Draco, including the option of secret touches under the table. Instead he found his place next to a very agitated Christie – and Professor Laddley’s name tag! It turned out students of every year were placed at each table plus one member of staff. There were far more first- to sixth-years than seventh- and eighth-years, so everybody from Harry’s usual table was on their own among younger kids. At least Tavin was also sitting at Harry’s table.
Ginny added, “… and you behaving all awkward just made us wonder if maybe you are into blondes now? You said she looks very much like Malfoy, right? Come to think of it, he might be quite handsome, nice butt and all – if one ignored his character.” Ginny grinned and obviously enjoyed the shock on Ron’s face as much as on Harry’s, who felt he had to make some clarifications and fast.
“Hey, keep your hair on, defenders of Draco the Delicate!” Blaise’ eyes darted from Harry to Cass and back again, “or is this the improved version of Crabbe and Goyle?”
Hermione let go of her boyfriend’s lips and added, “I totally agree. Not many people can wear pink without looking cheap. But on you, it looked quite classy. Although I would suggest a lighter shade.” And with that final remark she took a very stunned looking Ron by the hand and left with her boyfriend in tow.
“But what if –” an alarming thought hit Harry, “– what if Draco turns up at the Manor while she’s gone and his crazy uncle awaits him there instead?”
After pudding Peeves struck the gong a third time. This was the signal for the younger students to leave and the great hall was transformed once again. The gala tables were cleared away and the dance floor reappeared, now surrounded on three sides by boxes draped in burgundy velvet. The ground floor boxes were open to the dance-floor and another level of boxes upstairs was to be reached by two impressive staircases on both sides of the staff table.
“Draco, listen… you don’t get to decide for me. Because I… I’ve made up my mind and I want… ” Harry exhaled deeply. “I want you.“ There – he had said it.
Thursday afternoon went by in a flash. After talking to Mrs Malfoy, Harry felt the need to tell McGonagall his vague assumption of Draco hiding at Edinburgh. He decided to skip Potions and went directly to her office instead. As it happened she was just discussing further proceedings with the Headauror when Harry appeared. Kingsley immediately launched a search party of Aurors to scan the city and to make discreet enquiries among the local witchards. Harry was not too optimistic about the outcome – but it was a start, right?
For a change of topic he said, “Well, I’m going to Hogsmeade this morning. I’ve got the Headmistress’ permission ‘cause I need to talk to Aberforth.”
Harry shifted uneasily in his seat. He felt Draco Malfoys eyes on him when he said, “Nah, I don’t think so… maybe some other time.”
“Only two months have passed since we last spoke to each other, Mr Potter, but it feels much longer… who would have thought…” Narcissa Malfoy sighed. “I know that these days must be very difficult for you… as they are for Cassy and for myself.” Her voice was trembling now and Harry was oddly reassured by it. She was a human being with feelings after all.
“First of all, be assured, this is not an unusual problem,” Josh smiled at Hannah, “and there is an easy enough trick to solve it. Please tell us, what shape your Patronus takes presently?”
One glance at Ron confirmed that his best pal was still digesting the latest news, he looked utterly bewildered. Harry could not help grinning.
“And of course she wants us all to be safe, I’m sure about it and that's why she'll be an excellent teacher,” Harry said. They had finally climbed the staircase to Gryffindor Tower. “Does anyone know the password by the way?”
He smiled at Draco and was relieved to see, that one corner of Draco’s mouth rose promisingly as well.
Now that the owl was finally on his way, Harry paced the room. It was way too early for going to bed and he was restless. Maybe he should go down to the pool and swim some laps? That would at least tire his body, if not his wound up mind.
“Hello Harry,” McGonagall sighed, “I’m afraid the whole affair has taken an unpleasant turn. It looks like two more of my predecessors have vanished last evening.” She pointed her wand at two empty frames near the window. “The Imagics of Selena Darknight and Amanda Da Ponte, both former Headmistresses from the House of Gryffindor, left for a stroll in the painting of Bellevue Beach –that is one of the paintings in my private quarters– and didn’t return as expected.”
“Of course he is! Don’t you know he was Charlie’s first lover? The reason my brother finally came out to mum and dad? Come to think of it, Josh might have converted Charlie.”
Harry stared at her. If Cass thought they still had a chance, Cass being the one who knew Draco better than anybody – well that was enough reason not to give up. He felt hopeful again.
Harry just nodded and grinned at Luna and Dean, “Congratulations!” he said pointing at their hands, “took you long enough!”
Ron cleared his voice. “Hermione put all the stuff she found on the incident board and she thought – well, we thought, if she talks this through with you, maybe something will make sense? You might pick something up which she can’t see? I’m no good at this… this Advanced Charms stuff.”
Snape seemed slightly irritated. “Well, no, Mr Potter… in fact Professor Flitwick thinks,” he looked at his former colleague, who nodded eagerly, “that Mephisto –that’s what I’ve decided to call the poodle– has been painted right into the boudoir in all likelihood.”
Could it be true, that maybe –just maybe– Draco returned his affection? Fuck, why didn’t he have time to talk to Draco in private right now!
“Many of the remaining Imagics are quite frightened,” Harry went on, “they are afraid to get abducted as well. Some have stopped visiting other paintings at all, others only dare to walk around in pairs.”
The former Headmasters and Headmistresses were wide awake, very attentive indeed. Some of them even looked like being on high alert, as if they were expecting something horrible to happen.
’ you are calling him already? That figures.” Draco snorted, “Well, he might not favour you during lessons but – “
Harry drew a sharp breath. Flitwick was wrong, of course – there was at least one trap-painting at Malfoy Manor. But how could he share his knowledge without increasing suspicions of Draco? His mind raced. What was he supposed to do now? They obviously had no idea, such a hex existed. Taurus Malfoy must have kept his invention very secret indeed–
“But to reassure you – it wasn’t too much of a sacrifice for him to spend his holidays at Edinburgh. Aunt Mella is really cool – much more relaxed than his parents – and since we were old enough to go out, Draco especially loved to spend August in Edinburgh. This year, with him being confined to the house and me preparing for O.W.L.s, it was different of course. But previous summers… we didn’t study all the time… we explored the Muggle Fringe Festival, went to bars and raves, it was wild. I could tell you stories about Draco that would really surprise you… but as you don’t do gossip…”
At the moment he was still undetected, well hidden under the cloak and that was his only advantage, he did not want to risk it. Alas, Aberforth – or whoever had sent that letter – was aware of the cloak. They must be watching closely and therefore Harry needed to consider his moves ever so carefully.
Harry glanced sideways at Ron who didn’t seem to mind. Oh well, if the elder brother did not object, surely the ex-boyfriend had no right to complain either.
She took one look at her brother and said, “So you’ve heard, huh? Don’t you even dare to complain, Ron! You’re out of here in a few months! It’s my fate to stay for one more fucking year after this one!”
“Blaise just called. Ten minutes are over… we don’t know what to do next,” said the youngest of his group, a tiny girl called Christie.
“Yeah, I might be a bit nervous and –” Harry hesitated before he blurted, “I just wonder… I had no idea… with whom Draco was staying, you know?”
In the total silence of the room the throbbing of his own heart rang in his ears as he approached the door without a sound. He bent down and took a peek through the keyhole – and could make out even less than through the gap of the curtains before.
,’ Harry thought. Little Andromeda and little Narcissa seemed to be quite content without their mean elder sister.
With narrowed eyes McGonagall said, “Out with it, Harry! Whatever it is, even if you are not quite sure whether it is relevant or not, let us hear it! You do trust us, I hope?”
After Thursday’s swimming class Harry accompanied Tommy back to Gryffindor Tower. When they approached the door to the Gryffindor common room, for a moment Harry was surprised to see the Imagic of Severus Snape where the Fat Lady was supposed to be.
Ginny was delighted by this idea and suggested not just a tour of the castle but exploring the grounds as well. “We could even go to the Forbidden Forest, if you wanted to – it’s far less dangerous than it sounds!”
The Muggles Studies teacher had been astonishingly subdued since Halloween. Laddley was paler than usual and whenever Harry spotted him at the staff table, he was poking his food and kept quiet. In fact he looked as if he were heavily burdened. Wasn’t that strange, considering that he was now talking to Healer O’Malley? Wasn't that supposed to ease his mind?
Harry was quite surprised when he turned into the corridor to the Headmistress’ office. McGonagall, Kingsley and Flitwick stood at the foot of the enchanted staircase obviously waiting for him.
“No, not at all, quite the contrary… it’s actually fine. Relax, Hermione,” Harry sighed, “just… wait a minute and you’ll see…”
The three of them strolled around the village without much interest in window shopping and when it started to rain, they decided to have a drink at the Hog's Head Inn. They entered the shabby pub and it was as gloomy inside as Harry remembered it to be.
“No, I don’t!” Harry shouted, “And I don’t know what’s so funny about that either! First Hermione, then Josh and now you as well – I’m ever so glad you all know what’s going on in Draco’s fucking mind, but I certainly have no clue!” He felt quite exasperated.
“Are you done, dear?” Molly seemed highly amused by his outburst and the smile she gave him now was genuine.
“No idea.” Ron shrugged. “Boy, that guy Tadgh really is weird, you didn’t exaggerate, Harry. Did you see his hands, holding that spade? Those freakishly long fingers, they look like white spiders… and I wonder what’s wrong with his eyes? You say he always wears those glasses, even indoors? Strange.” Ron shook his head. “Come on, let’s get back to the castle. You better tell McGonagall the whole story… there’s something fishy about Laddley’s past for sure.”
Still his heart skipped a beat when he saw Draco at lunch-time. Both of them barely said a word, although the others at their table chatted and joked a lot, all excited about the upcoming ball. When finally Blaise Zabini had the nerve to ask, who would be Harry’s date for the evening, the tattle stopped. Everybody at their table except Blaise seemed to hold their breath. When Harry calmly responded, that he didn’t have a date, but would accompany Ron and Hermione instead, he could feel Draco’s eyes on him.
“Why are you telling me all of this?” Harry suddenly asked with feeling, “It is a horrible story and I feel terrible about it, but none of this is my fault! I knew nothing about it! Up until today I didn’t even know Cass exists!”
“She cut me short, as soon as I asked her about it. Said, I should consult with Flitwick instead,” Hermione sighed, “in fact, she looked at me, as if I were a bit dumb. Can’t blame her… asking the Transfiguration teacher for Advanced Charms is a bit like asking for milk at the hardware store, isn’t it?”
The guys at Harry’s table looked mostly as nonplussed as him, but the girls seemed to be delighted by the chosen motto.
!” and in an instant Draco’s shirt turned a lovely shade of mauve, which suited him not too bad, Harry thought.
“Please forgive me for asking, I certainly don’t want to intrude – and I also don’t want to keep you any longer from your friends, your presence is eagerly awaited at the common room for sure – ” the Imagic motioned to open the door.
Harry felt sick and torn apart. How could he convince McGonagall, that the Draco Malfoy he had come to know during the last few weeks was so very different from that confused, misguided and self-centred boy two years ago?
“Finally,” the Headmistress continued, ”I have the pleasure to introduce our new Muggle Studies teacher, Gregory Laddley, who will also be the swimming instructor for those of you, who plan to exercise in our new indoor pool.”
For the rest of dinner time Harry had barely a minute to eat in peace. First of all Blaise and Tommy were alerted by Laddley’s presence at the staff table. They took Harry aside and wanted to know everything Harry could tell them about McGonagall’s arrangements – not that he knew much about it. Eventually both of them agreed to cooperate. To Harry’s surprise it was far more difficult to convince Blaise than Tommy, that Laddley deserved another chance.
Ron whispered into Harry’s ear, “If you ask me, there’s nothing wrong with playing cards!” Harry grinned but kept quiet.
Upstairs Professor Flitwick was standing in front of an easel, holding his wand and a brush at the ready and looking deeply disappointed.
When he nodded anyway, she went on, “Well, I have to admit it’s not my favourite topic, Harry, but I owe you so much, you’ve made it really easy for me to find my place at Hogwarts… and I do know quite a bit about it, because the creep that happens to be my father,” she said the last word with distain, “is a master of Magical Arts.”
“I guess… what we have to ask ourselves is – how can we help Draco now? Find him before that lunatic gets to him?” Harry said. “It’s just dreadful that our secret connection has been broken and I can’t write to him any more.”
“So – what are we waiting for! Let’s search his room,” Ron got up too and went for the door, when again someone knocked to come in.
“Wow. That’s…” Harry was lost for words for a moment. “Thanks. Honestly, thank you – that means a lot. So what do we do now?”
“Okay,” Hermione said, “that’s the summary of where we are. Now let’s focus on priorities.” She gave him a questioning look.
Harry threw back his head and laughed. “I guess our esteemed Headmistress might be indignant over being addressed a girl! And to call the Headauror ‘
“When I saw what he created I relaxed a little bit, because first he just gave me a pet. You have seen my poodle, I presume? He is the best dog in the world! Only yesterday this… this gentleman’s Imagic,” she blushed, “took him away and now I miss Pippin terribly – Pippin, that’s what I’ve called him. But only after the strange artist had left us alone, I never said a word while he was around.”
“Very,” Harry nodded solemnly before he addressed Ron again, “If it’s any consolation to you – I also had no clue about Ginny and Cass until yesterday evening.”
As the large painting of Wizard’s Wood belonged to the Headmistress’ sitting room and the enquiry was more or less over – disregarding the painful fact that Draco and Dumbledore’s Imagic were still missing – naturally the painting had been returned to its usual place. Harry stepped closer to look at its replacement. Oh well, he knew that crazy bugger.
“Dumbledore showed me,” Dean said to Harry’s surprise, “When we were fifth-years he found me drawing one day. He must have liked what I did – it was a picture of the castle, you know – so he encouraged me to practice. Gave me a book about Magical Arts and showed me some simple charms to add small movements to my drawings. I was still too young to use magic that summer, but Dumbledore said, I should keep it up anyway… continue to draw the non-magical way during the holidays.”
Harry sighed, hardly listening to Ginny’s and Hermione’s arguing any more. They had been through this discussion during every meal all week. He zoomed out. His thoughts travelled to Draco as they so often did.
“I’m not sure… I would like to have my little sunshine with me of course and it might be rather interesting to see how Narcissa behaves towards Teddy, don’t you think? But maybe it would be too much for him?” she looked at her grandchild with affection and hugged him tightly.
When he, Ron and Hermione finally arrived at Gryffindor Tower late in the evening, McGonagall and Flitwick had already opened the door to the common room, checked all rooms for intruders and declared the place to be safe.The remaining students at Gryffindor Tower had not even been aware what had happened. Ginny and Cass retreated to the girls’ dormitories after reporting what they had seen – which was basically an empty frame.
Harry bit his lips. “Well, actually… don’t take this the wrong way, Ron, but… I’d rather go searching for Draco by myself.”
Harry was surprised. “How come you know about that? Me wanting to become an Auror, I mean?” They took some more steps upwards, turned yet another corner and Harry was totally lost– he was quite certain he had never been to this part of the castle before.
The girls passed a glance. “Yes please, we’d like some pencils, paper and water colours as well, if possible?”
“I’m afraid I don’t understand? Cass seems to be very nice,” he replied, “I think she looks a lot like your son.”
Just for distraction he ripped the Malfoy envelope open: Yes, Narcissa Malfoy had written again. She invited him once more to the Manor because she wanted ‘
“You’re going to Hogsmeade?” Ron asked while loading his plate with roast and potatoes. “Can I come too? Sound’s much better than finishing my Charms essay…”, but after one look at his girlfriend he added, “… oh well, I guess it’s going to be the essay instead.”
“With pleasure, Headmistress, with uttermost pleasure,” Phineas Nigellus puffed up and said, ”we were all very sorry to leave, of course, but it seemed the sensible thing to do. Albus was all for it, even convinced those who were rather reluctant to go. In the end everyone agreed, as Minerva said, and we were stored nicely enough. Naturally it was rather dull, you wouldn’t expect anything else from an archive, would you?
Meanwhile the abducted Headmistresses had left the hexed painting as well, both now fast asleep within their own frames.
“You mean to tell me Laddley has a problem with Muggle-borns?” Harry frowned. “But he’s teaching Muggle studies! That’s…”
“Whoa – calm down! I don’t know where he is and I didn’t do him any harm, ok? We talked and he left, that’s it,” Harry said defensively.
Everybody clapped their hands and the delicious food prepared by Hogwarts’ House-elves appeared at the tables.
So what if Draco Malfoy didn’t care much for him? Harry just had to focus on what worked well and was dear to him. Hogwarts needed him to solve the Imagic mystery, his friends wanted him to be happy and a good sport – that’s what he had to keep in mind. That’s what counted.
“I’ve stopped reading the Prophet at some point during the trials,” Harry murmured, “couldn’t bear their horrible gossip anymore.”
But Harry went on, “No, I won’t let you blame him! I am well aware that I used to rant and rave about him, but… all the trouble we gave each other in previous years – that was as much my doing as his! And about his past as a Death Eater, I believe – I
Ron shook his head. “Maybe… hopefully you’re right – but what about the fact you’ve recently been seriously wounded and unconscious for a full week? Like it or not – you’re still a convalescent, Harry! What if you tire and fall? And even if Taurus Malfoy is out of the picture, don’t you think some other nutter might take the opportunity to attack you? Mate, there’s no denying it – you’re a possible target! At least until the storage situation of the Elder Wand has been improved.”
And so they did. Andromeda stepped out of Harry’s downstairs fireplace at noon with an excited Teddy in her arms. She praised Harry’s spaghetti sauce and after lunch took a good look around the basement of the old house, which she had last seen as a girl. They did not walk up to the entrance hall, to avoid giving Teddy a start by the shrieking portrait of his hostile great-aunt. Finally they settled down in Harry’s favourite sitting room next to the kitchen, Andromeda and Harry sharing the sofa while Teddy and Otto occupied the old rug in front of the fireplace.
“Good afternoon, Mr Potter,” she said, “I see you have already made the acquaintance of my niece Cassiopeia?”
Harry just stared at Laddley. “Seriously? You think, this is what’s going to happen?” He shook his head. “No, Professor Laddley, think again. Hogwarts is a school with a strict anti-harassment policy and I will do anything to keep it that way.”
“No, thanks, Harry, I’m fine.” Molly said and, although she smiled at him, her eyes were concerned, “So… you and Draco Malfoy?”
Visitors came to see him and to wish him well – a lot of them. Molly and Arthur were there on the very first day he was awake, as were Ginny and Cass. In the course of the next days each and every one of his friends appeared and most of the teachers as well, including a very tearful Hagrid and a confusingly emotional Headmistress.
“You don’t have to come with us,” he told Harry, “it’ll be boring anyway… maybe we could meet again at the Three Broomsticks afterwards? At four o’clock?”
“Oh, shut it,” Harry growled looking across the table at Draco Malfoy, half expecting a vicious comment. But Malfoy seemed unimpressed by Ron’s remark. Instead he focused on spreading marmalade on his toast with uttermost precision.
The Fat Lady was the only Imagic that officially had been declared missing. Still among the students rumour had it, that hers was not the only disappearance. Ginny had heard a panic-stricken fifth-year claiming that seventeen Imagics, nine House-elves and three students were missing already! Thus it was only a matter of time until the Ministry and the School Board were forced to tell the truth.
At the sound of his question the Imagics fell silent. Polly had been faster than Harry. Nibbling a hazelnut she sat on top of an enormous green hat of a rather stout looking Headmistress, who cried quietly in her hanker-chief.
“Yeah,” Harry said and drew a deep breath, “listen, about Malfoy – I mean Draco – I know how close you are, so if you want to tell him… about me being gay – I won’t mind. Honestly it’s okay. He’ll find out soon enough. I’ll survive whatever he has to say about it. Just leave out the… the Josh thing, ok?”
One of the House-elves, wearing nothing but a tea-towel with pink polka-dots, looked from Hermione to Harry. Obviously she was the more daring one. “Millie never saw anything unusual at Master Professor Laddley’s room, Master Harry Potter Sir. He is a very tidy person, Master Laddley is.” Millie said with a trembling voice. “He always stored everything in its proper place. Bottles only in his bath room, like shampoo and such.”
“Right. That’s just what I need! Everybody’s messing with me nowadays,” Harry grumbled and with one final wave at Hagrid he turned around and pointed his broom towards Hogsmeade. Otto hooted and took off. He looped around Harry and obviously invited his master to race with him.
When Harry arrived at the foot of the moving staircase to the Headmistress’ office, McGonagall’s Patronus was already waiting for him. He climbed the stairs right behind the silvery cat and found the door at the top of the stairs slightly ajar.
“Well, I wanted to ask you, if I might join this training session with Potter and Zabini?” Tommy smiled politely and seemed totally oblivious of Laddley’s temper.
“When the sky is clear, you can see mountains at the horizon,” Harry said. He felt ridiculously proud of his home, because this is what Hogwarts meant to him: home. And whatever turmoil his emotions were giving him, he was right where he was meant to be, at the place he loved and cherished, the place he had fought for.
“Whoa,” Cass looked awestruck, “You know what that means, Hermione? The library has chosen you! That only happens about once a century! As described in
She addressed the rescued Imagics. “Welcome back to my office, ladies! I am sorry to inform you, that you have been hexed for a few days. Professor Flitwick just broke the hex and everything should be back to normal soon enough. I assure you, we are enormously relieved to see you again! Headmistresses Da Ponte and Darknight, please switch to your own portraits immediately, will you? You might want to rest for a while until all the side-effects of the hex have faded away completely. As for our esteemed Fat Lady – I’m afraid you will not be fit for the responsibilities tied to your usual position. For the time being I suggest you switch to Headmaster Snapes portrait.”
“That’s because you’re the best boyfriend Hermione could wish for and the best pal I’ll ever have, dumb-ass,” Harry knocked playfully at Ron’s arm.
“Yeah, that makes sense – he narrowed it down as much as he could and trusted, we would work out the rest,” Harry said, “that’s just like the real Dumbledore used to behave. At least we know it’s one of the teachers, not just any member of staff… or a student.”
“Stupid, actually, to imply his colleagues would not be able to see the difference,” said Kingsley, “That’s their first mistake! I think we will make some progress soon enough.”
“Nah, Magical Arts is not part of Hogwarts’ curriculum,” Dean sighed, “pity, actually. And I’m Muggle born – last year I wasn’t allowed to attend school anyway.” He picked up the cards he had been dealt by Neville and furrowed his brow before he addressed his fellow players, “My game!”
Harry’s heart ached – no, he would not interfere, but he certainly did not have to watch this either. “I’ll see you at lunch,” he said and turned to leave, walking towards the entrance of the Guest House.
Thanks to one of Hermione’s long-lasting warming charms, Harry was quite comfortable in spite of the cold night air. Just like he had expected they headed in the direction of Edinburgh for most of the flight, but in the end Otto had led them into the small town of Bonnyrigg, about eight miles south-east of the city centre.
“You’re insane,” Harry muttered, before he added with a grin, “but I’m very honoured to hear you cherish the chocolate-frog card with my picture. I sincerely hope you keep it on your bedside table?”
After a lengthy discussion with McGonagall and Shacklebolt, Harry had finally accepted the attendance of three Aurors for the flight under the condition, they backed off as soon as he touched down. Josh volunteered to be one of them, the others Harry had not known before. They left Hogwarts in the early hours of Saturday, assuming the flight would take them about five to six hours as Otto had been able to cover the distance twice in one night.
“What is this? A joke?” Taurus Malfoy sneered. “This is the rescue team you’ve been waiting for, Potter? I am so very frightened!” And he threw back his head and roared with laughter.
Maybe he should ask Kreacher to deliver a message? The House-elf could be bound to secrecy and was less likely to raise suspicions than Harry’s Patronus, if spotted. They would need Kreacher anyway to bring food to the Room of Requirements. But calling for the House-elf in the middle of the night? Harry hesitated.
Harry decided to keep Josh’s disclosure to himself for the time being. He wanted to tell Ron and Hermione of course, but feared Hermione might try to convince him to share that piece of information with Kingsley and he was unwilling to do that. He just hoped that Slughorn would not give anything away, but considering that Slughorn was not part of the investigating team and therefore clueless about Josh’s intentions, Harry thought that unlikely.
“A proper Muggle education really has its benefits,” Cass giggled, “But what you say about siblings, Harry – that sounds a lot like Draco and me as well. Don’t you agree, Dray?”
“Good boy! Have you come to comfort me, huh?” said Harry and was just about to close the window again – when he saw a single shoe dangling in midair, just outside of the window. A very elegant shoe of black patent leather.
“But what about the… the naked lady? Won’t she miss him terribly?” Hermione asked, “Now that she no longer enjoys the company of other ladies to play cards with?”
“As many as you wish,” said McGonagall, “You just have to concentrate on what you want, when you reproduce it again. I want to add two things, Harry: First – as we have agreed on taking Ms Granger and Mr Weasley into our confidence, you can of course show the board to them. In fact, I would be glad, if Ms Granger took a close look, she might see connections we miss. And if she –or Mr Weasley of course– feel like sharing with the rest of us, they may well add their knowledge to the board. Second – don’t even think about using this spell for your exams, it cannot be done unnoticed.”
He shook his head and sighed, “No, I didn’t. In fact it’s the other way round… he rebuffed me for ridiculous reasons.”
He took just one glance and nodded eagerly, “Right you are, Severus, this is clearly not Albus’ hand writing.”
“I have to admit, I felt different when Charlie told us, but I’ve learned a thing or two since then, hopefully. I did some reading, talked to a few people and, most importantly, seeing Charlie so much more content after he came out– that made all the difference to me.”
“Very good bedside manner, Ms Granger,” matron complimented her, “one day you’ll make an excellent Healer!”
Draco shrugged. “Well it wasn’t exactly hard to get. Don’t you remember we even talked about it some time ago? You were worried Ginny might get hurt and I said that’s exactly how I feel about Cassy.”
Gregory Laddley gave Harry a pleading look. “As I’ve said before, Mr Potter, today I can see – what I did was wrong and evil. I am so very sorry for putting you and Aberforth in jeopardy, for driving Draco Malfoy into hiding. The thought alone, that some other innocent person came to harm because of me, that’s terrible. Please believe me, I never wanted that, I was delusional. Anyway – I’m ready to pay the price for what I did. But I want you to understand… I’m not a bad person. I love my brother and I just wanted justice for his suffering… and enough money to ease his life, you know.” He buried his face in his hands.
Draco turned around, said good morning and smiled at Harry who's pulse quickened - but just a little bit.
Draco snorted and shook his head. “That is so totally not my point… quite the contrary in fact, I’ve been with plenty of guys… in a purely sexual way of course. To be honest, I’ve been a proper slut.”
“Well, there’s always Otto,” Draco said carefully. “He’s a Malfoy’s Owl. They are famous for secret messaging. If we take some precautions, nobody will be able to follow him.” Otto hooted excitedly – he clearly understood that his name had been mentioned. Draco gave Harry a questioning look.
“Wow, that’s a major change,” Hermione said, “we are no longer seated according to houses but to cohorts!”
“Lucius Malfoy was the most popular of our house and year, the other Slytherins downright worshipped him. He was clever, good looking and had lots of money. Of course I envied him like everybody else but we hardly ever spoke. He ignored me for six and a half years – until during our final year at Hogwarts he started to befriend me. I was surprised but pleased and I certainly didn’t question his sudden change of behaviour. Secretly I suspected he wanted my support preparing for N.E.W.T.s. Well, we passed the exams, school was over – and Lucius was still my friend. I was astonished but glad about it.
Harry very much doubted that Draco Malfoy would ever write, let alone say those words. Draco’s note –just a few lines scribbled in a hurry– merely confirmed that he had left the no-apparation zone without trouble and thanks for the cloak. But there were three little words at the end of the note that made all the difference:
The villain sneered. “You’re such a fool! Rejecting the indomitable powers of the united Deathly Hollows!”
“Well, I certainly don’t want people to know about my parents abandoning me,” Cass pulled a face, “I hate to be pitied, you know. That’s what I don’t want to be talked about, not being queer.”
“I’m afraid not, Minerva,” said Snape’s Imagic. He ran his fingers through the poodle’s fur and the tiny dog flopped on his back presenting his naked belly to the Imagic.
“Well, I’ll have to wait and see, what the fact-finding committee has to say about it. I hope the Auror department won’t sack me for good, but my time teaching at Hogwarts is definitely over.”
Harry grinned and patted the bird’s chest, telling him, “Very elegant you are indeed." Otto fluffed up, hooted excitedly and took a spontaneous bow. All three of them burst out laughing.
Harry pushed his still half-full plate away. “You are awful, both of you. Last call: stop talking about sex!”
To delay the inevitable he asked, “You want some tea, Molly? I’ll fetch some from our common room, if you like?”
“Good morning to you too, Potter,” Draco sighed and sounded very much like a parent, teaching his kid manners without result, “it’s a painting. A rather nice one, actually.”
Snape seemed quite pleased by Ron's praise,“Well, yes, it seems I underestimated the joys of having a pet.”
Swimming was pure bliss. Lap after lap he swam crawl which was his preferred style by far. He stopped counting at forty and fell into a meditation of sorts. There was nothing but the water and his body, perfectly able to move along… and again… and again.
Laddley stared at Tommy. “Are you making fun of me, kid? Or are you really that dumb? Well, I can certainly spell it out, if you need me to! I want no fucking poofter in my pool! Have you got it? Or do I have to shove this information up your freaking arse?”
When a coach drew nearer to their group, Cass reached out to streak one of the Thestral’s head casually. Feeling Harry’s gaze upon her, she said quietly, “Yeah, I can see them. Last Easter a group of Death Eaters attacked Muggles in our neighbourhood. Aunt Mella tried to help the victims and I assisted her… but she couldn’t save all of them. A little boy, he was only two years old… he passed away.”
“No need to worry, my dear. I’m sure it’s nothing… we’ve just been fire-called by the Ministry. Apparently something’s wrong with Draco’s tracking spell again, so an officer from the department of Magical Law Enforcement and our probation officer have announced to come by and take care of it. They’ll be here in half an hour.” She seemed to hesitate, then went on, “Cassy my dear, would you please be so kind and help me find Draco? Sorry to steal Cassiopeia from you, Mr Potter.”
“This is all about Professor Laddley, Mr Potter. You are quite right, he was expected to return from London this afternoon. But the Headmistress was fire-called from St Mungos late at night. Gregory Laddley collapsed at the hospital while visiting his brother. His condition is serious and the Healers are fighting for his life.”
With one swift motion Hermione pulled Ron’s head down and drowned his words with a kiss. Harry was ever so grateful.
Harry sighed and manoeuvred his broom into a sensible flying altitude towards Hogsmeade, Otto at his side. Why was it so much easier to cope with animals than with humans? Language, the ability to communicate by talking to each other, should make it easier to get along, one would expect. But words could also be very confusing and hurtful – his thoughts trailed back to Draco’s conversation with Blaise in the early morning. What he remembered most clearly was Draco saying ‘
With a sharp knock the compartment door was opened once again and Harry’s heart somersaulted at the sudden sight of Josh Jordan.
“First of all get dressed and put on a warm coat as well, I’ll wait for you at the common room, okay?”
It was Sunday evening and they were at Hermione’s and Ron’s rooms. Harry had returned from Hogsmeade and informed the Headmistress of his latest, rather fruitless enquiries at the pub right after dinner, before he joined his friends at their cosy apartment.
Hagrid just nodded at the two blondes before turning to Harry with eager looks. “So where is that new owl of yours? Show me!”
“Searching for Draco of course,” Harry found it alarmingly easy to lie to his friends. “I haven’t seen him after dinner… no idea, what’s gotten into him now.” He shook his head as if disappointed.
“I can assure you, it was not Narcissa’s idea to marry Lucius. He had quite a reputation even among pure-bloods.” Andromeda tasted the soup and then waved her wand to add some herbs she grew in little pots, standing at the windowsill.
“But Headmistress –you have to understand– I have good reasons, my brother…” Laddley stammered and was interrupted again.
“I said you’re a good friend, idiot! The best! Hell, I have the best girlfriend and the best pal one could wish for – I really am one lucky bugger!” Ron rubbed his eyes.
Harry raised his eyebrows, wondering what she was insinuating, when a tiny bird chirped at the open window and reminded Harry of Otto.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Mr Potter!” Narcissa Malfoy interrupted. “None of what has happened is your fault. It is his family that has failed Draco, not you. If anybody is to blame, it is me. I should have left Lucius years ago, put an end to that farce of a marriage and protected my son from his father’s influence.”
Draco’s choice was very close to Harry’s, just a hint greener, the effect was still very much the same.
At breakfast McGonagall had informed all of the students that Professor Laddley was unwell. Muggle Studies was cancelled and today’s swimming lesson was to be held by Blaise, Tommy and Harry instead. She had asked them to step in mere minutes before that announcement, which had increased the popularity of swimming apparently.
Draco rolled his eyes but kept quiet. He never talked much at mealtimes, Harry observed. Come to think of it, he didn’t eat much either.
“Ok, I’m listening. And I even might have to add something to the board later on,” he said, “I’ve just found out something about Laddley.”
“Mr Laddley’s statement is confidential, Harry,” Josh explained, “he gave testimony just a few days ago. What’s the use of going public?”
“Oh no, he’s hurt!” Harry shouted and removed the letter from the owl’s leg – yes, it was still his own writing. Otto stretched out his other leg towards Harry and hooted some more.
Last evening when the eighth-years had taken hold of their new residence, they were thrilled by having single bedrooms – and all of them with en suite bathrooms! The Guest House, as the new dormitory was named, was part of a purpose built edifice next to the castle. A spacious gym including a large indoor pool took up the ground floor, upstairs were plenty of guest rooms.
“Don’t look so shocked, Harry,” Christie giggled, “I’m just asking for my brother… he’s a fifth-year and he’s really nice… a bit shy, but still nice, believe me!”
“What?! Oh for Merlin’s sake, stop fishing for compliments! You know damn well how handsome–“ Draco cleared his voice and blushed violently even for his standards before he went on.
“Well, you might want to bring your knowledge along as well, Mr Potter,” said Flitwick, “just point your wand at the board, concentrate on what you know and say ‘
Andromeda reconciling with her remaining sister – that certainly came as a surprise. Harry did not know what to say, so he started spooning excellent soup instead.
“Fine, that’s settled then. Well, it’s dinner time, isn’t it?” McGonagall started walking again but Harry stayed put.
“That’s certainly one way of putting it. Well, I was hoping you might also be able to see it as a chance to work with the Auror department… considering your career plans, you know?”
the Imagic glared at Harry – who had dared calling Flitwick by his name only. Snape nodded and left.
“They’re at the bookshop,” Harry explained, “probably wanted some time on their own – you know, since they’re together, they don’t need me around all the time, naturally.” He tried to sound more relaxed about it than he actually felt.
“Quite right, a Sorores Cup it is.” Narcissa said. “And I am very astonished indeed, that it turned up at the Black… sorry, at your house. The last time I saw the cup was in our parent’s parlour,” she hesitated, “where it would have been lost without doubt, as my childhood home was destroyed during the war. I am very glad that you found this cup.” She looked at Harry with questioning eyes.
“We know you do, Harry,” said Kingsley, “which makes your behaviour all the more incomprehensible.” He shook his head. “Maybe you do not fully understand why the whole issue of missing Imagics is so important to the school?”
“I suggest we take a break until the headmistresses return,” McGonagall said walking back to the other investigators and with one swift movement of her wand all of the coffee tables were set with tea and an assortment of snacks and sweets. “Help yourself, will you!”
Harry nodded, “Yes, you told me when I first saw her on that night of the battle… I assume the secret passage to the castle is gone?”
Cass had fire-called Harry the day before to confirm that she and Draco would indeed sit with them, which had surprised Harry quite a bit. But as promised he kept the remaining two seats for Cass and – reluctantly – for Malfoy. He baffled his friends by turning down Dean, Seamus and even Neville who had asked for the seats.
Harry’s mat showed a red and green herringbone pattern, with lots of yellow and some blue freckles. The amount of green was no surprise to Harry, he had been aware of his Slytherin tendencies for some time now. He decided he liked his own pattern well enough.
“I see you have made some acquaintances already?” McGonagall regarded their group with satisfaction, “It pleases me very much, I have to say, that you, Mr Potter, Miss Granger, Miss and Mr Weasley, are ready to befriend our new student. I still have to borrow Miss Malfoy for a minute – you will see her again soon enough.” She gestured at Cass to follow her and the two of them left to a side entrance.
Draco sometimes wished he’d gotten the chance to look over his bedroom in the Malfoy Manor one last time, feeling cheated of a nostalgic memory. He struggled to remember his mother’s citrus perfume that could be smelled from her clothes. He missed his father’s lectures about his role as heir, and the way the peacocks would chirp in the early hours of the morning, welcoming the rising sun that climbed over their view of the expansive English property. Grimmauld Place was going to be home away from Hogwarts for a long time to come.
“It’s not that…” Draco heard himself say before he could come up with a better response. “I’m just…”
Harry snatched his hand back and furiously rubbed at the aching spot, standing as he did. Angry green eyes waiting for something for a second longer, maybe for an apology, or an explanation. Fat chance.
“What are you talking about, babe? We’re in no rush.” Pansy said, smiling. They had been friends long enough for the blond to know the black-bobbed bitch was toying with him. There was always a condition to his unconditional love for her, like this condition right now. He moaned internally -
Draco nodded with a sarcastic smile before pulling the curtain all the way around his twin-sized bed with one quick jerk, ending their conversation.
Snape gave a quick smirk, if Draco hadn’t been keeping a secret eye on him in his peripherals he would have missed it.
The bastard was grinning awkwardly at the dramatic display, clearly uncomfortable but also not unaccustomed to the level of grovelling. “Nice to meet you too…Uh - Niffler, was it?”
The room was filled with vivid orange light from the setting sun, a view of it sliding behind the Scottish hills could be seen from the large castle windows.
“You can trust me, my Lord, us. All of us here.” Bellatrix had crumbled to her feet, succumbing to the white hot rage in his voice, and planted kisses into his ink black robes. “I would never betray you like the slut Omega and two-faced Malfoy’s - “
