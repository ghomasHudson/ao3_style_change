Except for Potter, of course.  Though no one had to know he was already keyed into the wards – least of all, Potter himself.
Harry groaned around his cock, and Draco bit his lip so hard he tasted blood.  He hadn’t received a blow job since Pansy Parkinson fifth year, and the difference between the experiences was staggering.  That one had been quick and one-sided and ultimately disappointing, while this one felt like a strange frisson of energy between them that was igniting.
to him was enough to understand what he was feeling: there was lust – an igniting inferno of lust – and beneath it, something softer.  Something fierce.
Alright, so he was a bit cross with Harry as he straightened his clothes and entered Honeydukes still uncomfortably aroused, but who could blame him?  A minute ago, he’d had Harry Potter pressing him into a wall and snogging him senseless – who in their right mind would be happy to part with
asked him to dance by the hips and b) a whole room of their peers had just witnessed Harry make the most colossal mistake of his life.
He was beginning to feel like this back room would end up as his grave.  The longer he dwelled there, mixing cauldrons in the shadows, the more he felt his hopes for escaping dwindle, then wane and drift away.  Leaving no longer felt motivational; it felt
Slytherin House gathered in the common room a good hour before the festivities in order to start preparing.  There wasn’t much left to do – most of their performance, after all, took place in the dungeons
“Hey, Malfoy.”  Already, Harry was liking this plan, because it didn’t involve some dramatic entrance on his part –
like a wild animal.  Draco had spent so many years taunting him, coming up with new ways to prove himself an equal through rivalry.  He didn’t want Potter to see just how pathetic he had become.
, let alone breathe – Harry had flopped down into his lap, curls of hair tickling his arm, laughing eyes filling up his whole vision.
“Look – it’s Professor Potter and Mister Malfoy!”  The girl waved emphatically, and her friend loudly asked, “Are they on a
Harry took a moment to catch his breath.  “For spending two hundred galleons on a pair of shoes,” he finally managed.
It was a bit of a test, and Potter’s instantaneous blush was the unexpected answer.  He felt his heart quicken in his chest.
After nearly half an hour, he had a fairly decent outfit together – lavender button-up, a deeper purple vest, black trousers, black tailcoat, polished shoes, and, of course, the orange bowtie.  It looked seasonal,
Draco sighed.  “Then, Father cut me off.”  He said it simply, like constraining his tone to neutrality could constrain his emotions as well.  “He finished his year in Azkaban and immediately froze my finances when I refused to come home.  So there I was: penniless, jobless,
He turned back to his food with a scowl.  There had to be some way to get Potter’s attention – over the years, he’d become something of a master at it.  Even if he was laying low, that didn’t mean he couldn’t entertain himself a bit at the same time.
“Yes, indeed,” Slughorn murmured.  “Cruel – and also careless.  Which is why I shall forego participating in this year’s festivities altogether.”  He glanced up to meet Draco’s eyes in a rare show of acknowledgement.  “I was rather hoping
“I never heard what you wanted to tell me yesterday,” Draco realized at breakfast the next morning.  “You were so excited about something.”
“Still.  That’s…just leave it.”  She glanced worriedly in Harry’s direction, which he pretended he didn’t see.  He was fully aware that he’d been acting out of sorts since that day at training, and he didn’t want to parse out to her—or himself—exactly why that was.
behind for him to ponder.  He tried to close them out, to segment them off in his mind like he’d been taught, but after fighting so long, he was exhausted.  He was broken.  A chain binding his chest to the chair was all that kept him from crumpling under the weight of such heavy words.
The sunken, wan face of a girl came into view.  Young, maybe twelve.  Her unseeing eyes stared past him, and he was electrified with terror when he remembered exactly who she was.  How those memories shook him a way that was deeper.
Potter hesitated on the threshold, looking vaguely ill.  He caught Draco’s gaze with a twitch and muttered an “uh, thanks,” as he finally stepped through.
The fingers stopped just before they reached the bulge in Draco’s trousers, and he fought the urge to break down and beg.  His times before had been
He smiled a bit sadly.  Well that was something amusing he could do, couldn’t he?  Add his own delusions to this book?  He doubted that Potter would read it anyway - out of principle - and if he did, then maybe it’d serve as that push Draco wasn’t willing to take on his own.  Merlin knew he’d been nursing these inappropriate feelings for enough years as it was.
FRED: Thank you all for coming today!  We’ve had a phenomenal season of holiday baking from the students and staff at Hogwarts Culinary – but the time has come for us to announce a winner.
Draco couldn’t help but swell at the compliment.  “Yes, that is the idea.  It would be a potions sort of equivalent for Occlumency, to guard your secrets.”  To have the
FRED: Alright, bakers!  Welcome back for another week – and enjoy it while you can, because it is your last.  Congratulations on reaching the
”  He glanced around again, drawing attention to the silence before continuing.  “Let them come ask for themselves.”
Harry stalled, and the jack-o-lanterns floated above him, casting a soft, orange glow about the room.  The skeleton orchestra celebrated, whirling traditional harvest songs into dancing tunes, and candy apples dripped gobs of caramel to the floor.  But none of it –
As footsteps crashed loudly behind him, however, he realized her look had been warning of something else entirely.  Draco set down his drink and hardened his jaw.
The common room fell into easy chatter, younger students clamoring to confess their drama to Draco and eager to impress him with their stories.  It passed the time nicely, so he found himself almost feeling bad as his mind drifted back to earlier this evening, when Harry had met him after the match.
them was.  “Other people might like that hair and the way it glistens in the sun, but not me!  No siree!”  He clapped a hand over his mouth, eyes huge.
A flash of pain in his side.  Fingers skimming his face.  Draco’s eyes flew open to unfamiliar surroundings, experiencing one long moment of blissful confusion before he remembered.
Altogether, this story will elaborate and expand upon my original work, so I hope you'll join me for that journey if you enjoyed the first one!
“Juicy articles about The Boy Who Lived taking place within our good castle walls?” Draco asked sardonically.  “Unlikely.”  His chest felt tight all of a sudden, and he couldn’t help the question that slipped out next.  “Why, would you rather no one knew?”
The thought tore him apart inside, because, for the life of him, he couldn’t figure out what he’d done wrong.  He’d replayed their conversation obsessively in his head, each time hoping to discover the exact moment which had set Potter off.  But, each time, he only found himself more confused than the last.
Harry glanced huffily down at the monstrous hand-knitted jumper he had on, muttering, “Molly made it for me.  Why?  What’s wrong with it?”
He’d dragged Harry to flying class yesterday in order to give him a break, and he’d been looking forward to relaxing together a bit this weekend before Weasley had stuck his head through the Floo at an ungodly hour and whisked Harry away to help with wedding preparations.  All before seven AM on a
It stung.  It stung in a way that he wasn’t quite ready for, given how he’d hardened his heart to the whole affair in the past couple of days.
Which, admittedly, was a rather large divergence – but personally, he didn’t think warranted as much attention as it was now getting.  As he stepped up into the stands, he saw several students zoom in on him with Omnioculars, Hermione’s face grow dark with suspicion, and – gaping in wordless horror – Filch walk straight into a pole.  That one made him smile, once he was sure Filch wasn’t getting up to see it.
The insult didn’t have quite its usual sting, and Draco wondered – with no small amount of panic – if this was actually Potter
this year – their relationship had started at age eleven, even though its recent direction was undoubtedly new.
Fenn had guilted Draco into several hours of drills and scrimmages, but, nearing the end now, it had wound down into nothing more than a chaotic pickup game.  Somewhere along the way, he’d stolen a beater’s bat from Kat’s outstretched hand – but only after
“This can wait,” he said at last, stealing Draco’s cruel quote from earlier.  A devious smile played about his kiss-swollen lips.  “After all, we have a date to finish, and you owe me some sweets.”
The downward quirk of her mouth was the only flicker of reaction from her.  “I’m merely stating it as an observation.”
Harry’s pulse fluttered under the soft beginnings of a bruise, and Draco traced the area with a finger.  Harry let out a shaky breath, voice low when he managed to speak.  “I can do that.”
He pressed harder against the nape of Harry’s neck to keep him down as he stroked his dick to full erectness with the other.  “If only the Wizarding world could see you now – all prepped and needy and
.  It summoned a smile to Draco’s lips, and before he knew what he was doing, he was leaning forward, practically brushing his lips against Potter’s ear, just to see what he would do.
Harry, in typical Harry fashion, finished turning bright red and squawked in a quite indignant fashion.  “How could-
“Yes,” he murmured, “well, maybe there’s no point in pretending otherwise.  I was a Death Eater.  I can’t change it now.”  It took something out of him physically to admit it.  He was saying too much, his barriers were too sorely damaged-
He was pushed to the basement door, sweat breaking out as the wards crackled against his flesh.  Forgetting his bravado, his head swung wildly to take in his captors – to take in the situation, any possible escape routes.  He felt adrenaline shooting through his veins as he realized there were none.
to do with the way Malfoy’s body felt against his.  Somehow both comfortable and electrifying.  It certainly wasn’t the way their dance had lingered in Harry’s mind ever since, replaying with startlingly clarity whenever he caught sight of the man from across the room.
Harry raised an eyebrow, but was already working at his trousers.  The button popped free in an instant, and in a panicked confusion of reality and fantasy, Draco told him to do the rest with his teeth.
He said it so disarmingly and so obviously at a loss that Draco couldn’t help but continue teasing him.  Draco caught the hand that Harry was using to hide the worst of his blush and pulled it away gently.  He brushed his lips over the knuckles and dragged softly over the back of his hand.  “Maybe I should be honest more often, then.”
It would be no fun if Potter found it right away, so he charmed it to the board, disillusioned it to Potter specifically, then disappeared into the night.
“Mister Jenkins,” he purred, malice dancing undetectable beneath the address.  “How can we help you?”
Draco didn’t speak until he’d stalked up to face Potter.  He stopped several feet away, eyes darting to Flitwick for a moment before resuming harsh eye contact with the Savior.  “This is dueling club, correct?”  He didn’t give the man a chance to answer.  “I’m here to duel.  With Potter.”
But alas, there were more opinions to be added to the pot.  Fenn, who was the captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team – and therefore the seventh-years’ spokesperson – leaned back on the sofa and snorted.  “Halloween isn’t about any of those things, you guys.  It’s about the permission to dole out absolute
Draco allowed himself a smirk.  “To fuel your obsession with me,” he drawled.  “Tell me – is it working?”
‘feeling great,’ and that he needed to go clean up his shirt – ignoring Draco’s reminder that he was indeed a wizard who could do such things with magic.
Draco touched himself again that night, thinking of Potter.  It was a quick, exhilarated thing – matched in desperate pace only by his longing – and he came with a muffled groan of “Harry” against the bathroom tiles.
him to come home for Christmas; last year, he certainly hadn’t.  “I’m not coming,” Draco said slowly – and perhaps that was his first mistake.  If he said it more firmly, then maybe his father wouldn’t-
little gingerbread family?  [He clearly thinks that the cameras are otherwise occupied, and he flushes when he notices one has caught him.  If the scene from their classroom is anything to go by, DRACO has put on quite the performance of politeness during his time on this show.  Now – with only CEDRIC and HARRY there with him, and nothing nameable to do – he can’t help reverting to his old self.]
McGonagall sighed, shifting her hawkish gaze to the window while answering.  “Draco, I hired you this fall knowing precious little about your situation or your intentions.  I hired you because you were qualified – but also because I believe everyone should be given a second chance.  I don’t imagine you had an easy time these past few years, and I don’t pretend you’re the same little boy who threw hexes at his classmates under the table during class.  But I took quite a leap of faith in bringing you back to Hogwarts, and you need to give me a measure of trust in return.”
you.  I kept the most unsavory lot away from you, so you never even knew.  I won’t be doing that anymore.”
He fought back an eye roll of disgust in favor of ignoring the reporter entirely, and asked the now wide-eyed cashier, “How much does that come to?”
Harry grasped Draco’s face and forced him to meet his eyes.  “That’s not true.  You being a competent, mature teacher here is reason enough to grant it.”  He hesitated, eyes drifting to the side.  “Also… I think she’s just really fed up with all the rumors focused on us.”
CEDRIC: [aside] Ahh, brilliant!  [He is carving out gingerbread-Cho’s features with the world’s smallest scalpel.  It looks undeniably like her, and we only hope that it will retain its shape in the oven.]
VOLDEMORT: It looks a bit hurried to me.  There’s icing missing on some of the trees over here, and the figures weren’t held in place long enough – see here, one is sagging.
He wrapped his fingers around the base, eyes flickering between the sheer hedonism of the sight and the wrecked expression on Harry’s face as he watched Draco’s hands.  The gloves slid gracefully up and down, catching only a few times on the damp skin.
“That’s not true!” Harry retorted.  “There’s got to be a way I can help show him he’ll find someone else…”
”  Unlike Draco’s pathetic attempt, he heard the bones clicking back into proper place.  The man repeated the spell, drawing it across Draco’s chest and down to his poorly battered hip.
Draco felt like he’d been gutted.  Like a fish sliced cleanly from throat to tail with the hidden messiness of its organs spilling outwards.  He felt Harry engulfing him in a hug, and in his confusion, he felt a jolt of relief that at least the pressure would help staunch his wound.
“Three more,” he murmured, to ground himself more than remind Harry.  “Can you handle that, Potter?”
“No problem,” Draco replied automatically, voice strangled and unfamiliar to his ears.  Only as Potter turned to descend did it strike him that he’d actually been expecting a
Did he honestly believe that he would get anywhere with this pacifist shtick he had picked up somewhere in the past two years?  It muted and dulled him in a way that infuriated Draco, not only because he wasn’t living up the image in his head – the boy he remembered so clearly from school – but also because Potter looked so bloody
[The camera refocuses on HARRY and DRACO to gauge the losers’ reactions, and yet they are not at all what we might expect.  DRACO looks wryly disappointed, like he can’t decide whether he’s upset or amused, and HARRY is shouting something to him over the noise – to which he nods, and suddenly they’re slipping away through the crowd.]
Roddy appeared in an instant, tripping over himself in a rush to take Draco’s light coat and gloves.  “Master is late!” he grumbled, practically shoving him towards the drawing room.
want to talk about these things with Harry – in fact, he wanted nothing more than to have that kind of intimacy with the man.  But the issue was timing.  He and Harry had just begun this…whatever it was between them.  He didn’t want to douse that flame by unburdening twenty years of fraught family tensions on top of it.
was the enterer this time – and therefore it felt like the two of them could finally have a conversation rather than perform an improvisational play in front of an audience.
“I came to talk about the article,” Harry said, and the irksome shred of hope that Draco hadn’t managed to crush yet puffed out in his chest.
so.  His heart was thundering in his chest, and it took all his strength to stand and walk away from the man seated beside him - after he had waited so long to see him again.
They broke down into excited whispers and new ideas, and in the commotion, Draco sidled over to Marla and Kat to ask them something.
It was Gloria – the barmaid.  Her usual expression of concern had deepened into a face sick with guilt and worry; Draco had seen such an expression enough times in his mirror to recognize it.
It was as if, in this sleep-induced haze, Harry had been able to strip away the complexity of it all, to cast aside the forces of hesitation that usually kept them at arm’s length.  With a simple, normal phrase, he’d erased the distance and made
She swept past him with her usual self-possession, finding a seat in one of the armchairs without being asked.  Behind her back, his mouth twisted into a scowl.
His smugness faded in an instant as he noticed the panic settling on Potter’s face.  The way his jaw was working, but no sound was coming out.
Fenn slipped away after that, returning to the frivolous conversation around them.  He didn’t blame her; things like the war were best talked about in small doses.  He fell back into easy chatter with his students, though the ghost of their conversation remained.
He slumped against the wall, and with a rush of nausea, considered all the things he might’ve broken.
“What are you talking about?” he forced himself to ask calmly.  Calmly, so he didn’t start panicking.  “We’ve been ‘going out’ for the past week.”
Bagman looked him up and down in a way that made his skin crawl a bit, and then the man was muttering things like “hmm, no matter” and “you can’t have lost such promising skill.”
Be right there!” he heard Harry say.  There was another few seconds of fumbling before he heard the chamber door creak open.  Then, voices again – but this time, too muffled for him to hear.  Cursing under his breath, Draco drew his wand and cast an auditory enhancement charm.  He pressed his ear to the door and caught the tail end of Harry asking Sam why he’d come.
Ignoring the sudden thundering of his heart, Draco tilted his head with an expression of mock seriousness.  “That
“I only started figuring this out this year, at age twenty.  Now, I certainly don’t claim to have my shit together, but at least I have a bit more life experience and a basic grasp of
His first feeling, shameful as it was, was relief at the idea that he wouldn’t have to deal with the looming guilt and frustration that his father’s presence evoked.
go wrong with Madam Puddifoot’s.  How about somewhere else?”  He looked rather horrified by the idea of it, actually, and Draco prayed it was because of his calamitous date with Cho Chang and not the idea of Hogsmeade that caused it.
He would keep his mouth shut and his head down, if that’s what they wanted.  He had gotten used to that.  He would simply do his job to the best of his ability and pray that no one got him fired for his Dark Mark.
Naturally, Draco was disappointed with this suggestion as well, but it was almost worth it to see the look of abject loss on Harry’s face.  Like he’d built up a terribly exciting night with Draco in his head, and it was all crashing down around him – ultimately, a very flattering sentiment.  He only hoped he could live up to it tomorrow, or whenever the time came.
, that’s not really the point here.  This case is not, in fact, about your possible transgressions against your former boss, and even if it was, I don’t think we’d have enough information to convict either way.  The
Something didn’t look right outside his office.  Draco paused by the door, thrown for a second by not being able to place what it was.  After a moment though, his eyes fell upon the office hours sheet.
After a minute, Harry clapped a hand over Draco’s wrist.  “I want you…I want you to fuck me,” he begged, voice ragged like he’d been running.
.  He’d known it would – he’d read it and heard it said – but it was quite different to hear it than
Here, Draco’s mind snapped from its relative peace, as he reeled with sudden, terrible realization.  He
The cabinet in Potter’s classroom was rattling, and Draco was beginning to think that this was a bad idea.  Maybe, just
He somehow managed to calm himself by the time he reached the pitch, and with the new broom, Jimmy floated easily into the sky.  Then, mercifully, Draco could finally begin his class.
, he had forgotten that his earlier marks might still be here.  Something white-hot and insistent lodged in his throat as he caught sight of the fading bruises painted across the swell of Harry’s bum.  He couldn’t help but reach out and touch, grabbing a handful of flesh and kneading it under his grip.  “
Students hushed as they saw him enter, but he couldn’t tell if it was because of his presence or the furious expression he couldn’t seem to wipe off his face when his eyes landed on Potter.  Potter, who looked disheveled and tired as usual, but not debilitatingly ill.  Not wasting away from some legitimate misfortune.  He looked rather normal, truth be told – if a little weary – and that set Draco grinding his teeth.
She startled and glanced up.  “Oh?  Yeah…yeah, I’m fine.”  She tugged at the strands a little more harshly, eyes settling far off in the distance.
, Potter?”  It didn’t mean to come out as incredulous on his tongue, but his surprise was great enough to warrant the drama of it.
“No, he can’t,” his mother confirmed, ignoring her husband entirely.  At that moment, with Lucius’ immature comments falling on deaf ears, the dynamic between the three of them seemed to drastically change: without intending to, Lucius had taken on the role of an unruly child – and from the defeated way he slumped in his chair, he must have realized it, too.
His previous confidence in Potter’s interest was flagging, and he found himself reexamining every second of every interaction they’d had since he’d started this bloody job, and came out no wiser than before.  Sure, there were signs of attraction – the blushing, the looks, the breathlessness.  But what if it wasn’t
“Yeah?”  The twisting in his gut had been rapidly replaced by an electric kind of tingling; Malfoy thought his hair was less messy – that was practically a compliment!  He knew his face was doing something stupid in response.
Reaching the starting point, the boys lobbed the rain orbs into the air, where their final teammates were waiting.  The girl on the left missed hers, which sent her team quickly into second as she dove to retrieve it.  The other caught hers with a practiced ease, and she took off towards the magical shield Draco had set up in the sky.  She tapped it with the rain orb and smiled as the whole shield glowed blue before she twisted to descend.
He stepped forward, earning a wry eyebrow-raise from his opponent—which quickly turned to a look of shock when Harry didn’t stop when he reached respectable hitting range.
FRED: Yeah, I’ve heard him called the ‘King of Saucy Puds’ when new people come on set sometimes.  It’s always a bit of a surprise to remember that old Voldie’s got international acclaim in the field when you’re working with him every day…
HARRY: [sneaks up behind DRACO and jostles him as he reaches past him for a whisk at his station] Sorry – just needed to borrow something.  [In knocking DRACO, he has just caused the man to spill the entirety of his hot milk mixture into the eggs, and curdling is immediately visible.]
He offered them a small smile, his attempts at professionalism warring with his more mischievous natural state.  “Good work,” he allowed at last.  Because, really, compliments were owed where compliments were due.
Harry, eyes black and glittering, could only nod.  Draco swallowed dryly before lining himself up at last.
While he was still incredibly nervous about dueling Potter in front of a class, he had Occluded enough of his darker thoughts that he was buzzing with that fleeting sense of false confidence.  Even if he wasn’t planning to do anything stupid regarding Potter – he
Draco had seen his mother charm many politicians and Ministry executives in his time, and her aim here was just as clear.  He ground his teeth as Harry, ignorant to her machinations, could only nod dumbly in response.
*ing course.  [He glares at both CEDRIC and HARRY in turns, wincing as the biscuits burn his pale skin while he rolls.]  ‘Labradors in Liverpool’ my arse…
He paused, face twitching at the familiar address so common to another jovial, egotistical man.  Turning, he pasted on a smile.  “Professor Slughorn.  What can I do for you this evening?”
Ah, yes.  The Christmas lights.  As if their estate was still something worth marveling at during the holidays.  He wasn’t shocked that she was starting so early; they’d lost most of their help after the war, of course.  An undertaking of that scale could easily take months.
“You don’t seem to be working so hard in Defence class, either. You are a natural at these things. I used to think you only got good grades because of your name, but even I have to admit it. You’re good.”
he took a deep breath and looked away. “You know that, for a while now… it’s been a rough few years, right? No, that’s not what I meant to say. Harry, it’s been hell. After Azkaban, I’d wake up every morning and curse myself for not having died in my sleep. I would spend hours on my knees in His living room just wishing not to be. Most of the time I was numb. I didn’t even know how much pain I still – I didn’t know how much…” his voice, the traitor, cracked, and Draco wiped his stupid eyes. This was not the time. He had to be very, very clear. “You coming to the shop was the worst thing that’s happened to me. Seeing you again, thinking about all those things I’d avoided, having to – face you, every time, it was a nightmare. When you laughed. When you made me those pancakes. When you gave me the mobile. When you smiled at me. When you… kneeled with me… Harry, you made me feel cared for, and I hated it. You made my life an absolute mess, but you made me feel
How to explain? How could he put it into words, this feeling spreading inside him like a black hole? How can he phrase it, make it tangible, make it clear? He had no idea. “I think the bracelet might be there,” was all Draco could bring himself to say.
“Nothing is all right, as you know perfectly well. And you, Harry Bloody Potter, are our only chance in this wretched world. So if you don’t mind delaying whatever it is you were thinking of doing – “ he gestured broadly towards the bed, still there since their previous engagements – “We should really get down to business.”
He straightened himself on the stool immediately, grasping for control. Coughing a little he looked at Potter, only to see a devious look on his (handsome, damn it) face. “So, I have another question, actually.”
. Potter who thought he was good enough. Not in a million years would he have been able to guess it; Potter wanted him, he did, he really did, all this time, and Draco was none the wiser. He had no idea his Potter could be so unexpected. His Potter. Gods, Draco could not stop repeating these words in his head, over and over again like a chant. His Potter. And to even imagine he’s worthy enough to think that…
A little knot of dread twisted in his gut, and Draco took a seat at the very edge of the bed, as far as possible from soft, tempting, painful Potter. The man seemed as anxious as he, if not more; he kept twiddling his thumbs and covered himself with the duvet up to his chin. “Well?” Draco asked in the end, when nerves got the better of his patience.
He sounded so aggravated, Harry had the decency to look embarrassed. “Look, Draco, we’re not going to do anything before he gets back. We just want to be prepared.”
“You are?” Draco asked, uncertain to the point of physical pain. “I… you’re the bloody Golden Boy, Potter. You don’t condone murder.”
“Because some poisons are very specific to the maker, and so to – never mind, it’s too long and you’ll fall asleep halfway through my explanation. Let’s just skip it. How was your day?”
“What do you think it means?” Draco snapped. “He spelled the ink in. It was His design, too. I would never have gone for anything so…” then he stopped, because come on, there had to be a limit, and offending
Harry’s mind was spinning and crashing ungracefully in anxiety. He didn’t want to do anything that hurt Draco, but he had no idea what to do, as he was all the way inside him. There must be something he could do, right? There’s no way it had to be painful. This was meant to be enjoyable, god damn it. People were doing it all the time, and it was supposed to be good... it was good, before, when he did it with his finger. So there had to be a way. He tried to calm himself down, to quell the blackness that started fizzing in the edges of his sight. No, he won't do this right now. He will find a way to fix it, to make it - to make it good for Draco too, because that's all he really cared about. But how could it be good if it was hurting him? Harry tried to think logically. What they needed was a way for Draco to relax, maybe. If he wasn’t so wound up, it would probably hurt less. Very carefully he leaned down, kissing him softly.
Malfoy shivered when Harry said the name, and he could feel the grin on his face widen. “Get off me, Potter, before I have no choice but to hex you, and to hell with explanations,” he said in a low voice.
“No, I know what you’re going to say. My magic is still… I know I’m not in top shape yet, but there’s hardly any time to wait. With everything that’s going on…”
“Don’t be an idiot, Malfoy. Voldemort doesn’t care about how you do at school. He doesn’t care about anything other than hurting and killing and dominating everything.”
right?) They wanted him to be better so bad. But he wasn’t getting better, he probably never will, and the whole thing just kept slipping further and further out of control.
“I know, I know. I can’t really excuse what I did, but I have to be able to act like me in order to solve this. You know it same as I do.”
“Me. Once you really know how messed up – once you know what I – you will leave, and I will have nothing, nothing but Him. You can’t – you can’t show me all of this, push it right in front of my nose and expect me to – while I know, I know all along it can’t continue. That it will have to end, and you will be gone, and I will be – please, Harry. Please. I’m not strong enough. I don’t… I can take much, but not this. It’s too cruel.”
Twenty minutes later found them finally making their way to the living room, where Mother, Pansy, Blaise and Theo were waiting, looking smashing in their formal robes. A large vase sat on the table in front of them filled with delicate golden roses, each of them a portkey.
“Interesting… well, Father always did say you could not do Occlumency… well, then. You know about the bond. It matters not.”
“But, Draco,” Harry countered as logically as he could. This course of action didn’t feel altogether wise.
He can’t tell him the truth. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, exasperated with himself, frustrated with Harry. “You don’t love me.”
be clear, though: if you fight me, I will not be the one to pay the price. And neither will you, before you say anything. I don’t suppose you want me to show you what I can do to Draco if I truly intended to hurt him? I promise you I had been very restrained in regards to him until now.”
“Please,” Draco begged his knees, since he couldn’t possibly look at that sad face. “Please.” His voice was barely even a whisper.
Malfoy nodded quietly, and Harry wanted to punch him. Why was he acting like that? If only he behaved the way he did with Harry around Ron and Hermione too, they could all get along fairly well, he felt certain of that. But he was all weird and stiff, not looking at anyone directly.
“He didn’t kiss me,” Draco said, probably in a dream. “I kissed him.” Where, where were the words coming from? Why? How? Other WH questions that might apply? He had no idea. He didn’t care. Harry was crumpled on the floor across from him, his father’s memory had been wiped clean, He had betrayed him and nothing mattered anymore. Nothing. Mattered.
The cooking was apparently done; Potter was busy plating spaghetti and tossing the salad he cut. Draco cleared his throat. “Can I help with anything?”
“Good. Listen, Dobby, we have to make a quick getaway – do you think you could come with us, and we’d look for the others together? This way we could leave as soon as we find them.”
Now it was a real battle inside Harry not to hold him. In the end he won: he just couldn’t let the boy remain like this, kneeling on the frozen ground, tears still streaming down his face. He pulled Malfoy up, who came without a fight, like a rag doll rather than a person. He still looked completely fazed, like he has no idea who was touching him, but also like he could not care. Throwing caution to the wind Harry tore the cloak off him, and for a second Malfoy only stared at him in shock. Then he gave an odd cry, and the next second he was on Harry, his face buried in his collar, arms over his neck as if he was about to fall. Instinctively, Harry caught him; he wrapped his arms around the thin figure and squeezed tight. He didn’t know if Malfoy was actually crying, but his body was shaking with uncontrollable sobs, and Harry held on for dear life, for it felt like if he let go they will both fall. They stayed like this for some time.
“Father,” Draco said for the third time, his mind frozen with fear. He stared at the familiar face, too astounded to say anything else. His father knows, he knew all along. He was a bloody fool for thinking otherwise. He should have foreseen this… stupid, stupid Draco, too numb and dumb to see clearly… He stepped right into his father’s trap, and now he brought Granger along with him.
He didn’t even hesitate for a second; Draco was desperate to show Potter that he can be good, that he doesn’t need to punish him, that he doesn’t need to
“Are you single, love?” It was so bold a question, Draco gaped in shock. Delilah gave him a wheedling look. “My daughter is twenty-six years old. She’s a very beautiful girl, isn’t she, Mags?”
! He quickly looked away; true that this insolent creature needed to be put in his place, but Draco really didn’t wish to see it happen. His heart lurched in sympathetic fear.
There was tension in the way Draco nodded. A mighty amount of it. “I… yes, I do know him. He came to the Manor a couple of times, the summer before seventh year. He was there to… confer with the Dark Lord.”
. Draco wanted to cry the whole time. And then when he flinched away from his reaching hand, like a total prick – as if hand-holding wasn’t something they did all the time now, as if he was scared Harry would
“Dumbledore told me.” Draco’s eyes widened with understanding. “He said your evil plan all this time was to get your license and Apparate me away. But then you failed, even though apparently you’ve been able to do it ever since you were a kid.”
He was panting breathlessly, the room still spinning unbalanced around him. Malfoy swallowed lightly, and Harry could do nothing but stare at him, eyes wide with shock, heart fluttering faster than ever before. It took a long while until he had enough air to say anything. “Where did you learn to do that?” was all he could bring himself to ask.
Her fingers twirled around a lock of her hair. “I’m willing to hear, if you’re willing to tell me. I can be strong for you, Draco. I can be strong as well.”
He was still aware, though. He could see when they attached a lead to his collar, could feel the unbearable pain as they hauled him across the dungeons and up the steps. He tried to keep up, to crawl on his hands and knees, but the pain from his broken bones was blinding and he simply could not do it. Draco fell countless times, dragged forwards from his neck, and the salty tears in his eyes were the only reaction he could produce.
Potter sat down next to him. For a second, Draco was sure he’s about to touch him, and opened his eyes just a slit in alarm. But he didn’t; he only laid both hands on the table, deliberate and slow. “I know it can’t be easy, to be away from her.”
“Relax, Malfoy. You passed out. Are you okay?” Harry bit his bottom lip, looking at him with concern. In the short period of time since he was last close to him, Malfoy seemed to get into even worse shape. He was thinner and more tired looking than before, the black bags prominent under his eyes.
And what if he could love her back? What if he could look at her, really look at her face, and love her utterly and completely again? Faithfully, endlessly, what if he could love her like that once more? Could he do that? Was he strong enough? He’d known hate for so long. He thrived on hate for so, so long. What if he could
The bells rang so loud Draco nearly stumbled out of the spell holding him aloft. His mind was positively shattering with the racket; these weren’t bells of joy, he discovered harshly. These were bells of doom. And he was about to cave under them, because this was
First he tore the petals and crushed them in his fingers, mulling them into tiny pieces. He dropped it all in the water, then took the root of the flower and cut into it with a little kitchen knife. He was careful to carve around the thin veins in the root, and got about three inches of it into the water, shaking the glass vigorously. The final step was taking a single green leaf, cutting it neatly in two and inserting the left piece, mixing the whole thing thrice in an anti-clockwise motion. Draco watched the liquid in the cup darken then brighten, until it was clear again. When the process was complete he ran as fast as he could back out to the corridor, skidded on his knees next to Potter, and tried very hard not to throw up. In the fifty seconds he’d been away, Potter had become deathly pale. He was almost a ghost.
It was only after the man had whirled to walk away that Draco realized the depth of his mistake.  The words had felt so final, and their icy cadence terrified him.  “Potter, wait!” he yelled, but within another second, the hallway was empty once again.
In truth, the pet names made him melt – as embarrassing as they were.  Which is why he’d counted in the first place.
Thinking of star signs now, however, tugged at his chest in a way that would be best described as bittersweet.  He remembered her lessons fondly, letting those feelings flare and fade to guilt when he remembered his stack of unanswered letters.  Draco had written to tell her of his new position as a teacher, of course, but he had read neither the precedents nor the aftermath of that news.

to Harry – at least, not yet.  He needed to let things settle for a while; he needed proof that Harry wouldn’t turn and run.  In the meantime, he could reveal himself in fragments.
Draco rolled the wand between his fingers, delighted at its smooth, familiar grip.  For the first time in a long time, Draco knew that he’d be okay.
The request sounded desperate and harsh in the sudden silence, and his hearing felt muddled from the adrenaline headrush.  They had never… They had done most everything else…
He paused before the door.  It looked the same as it had the other day when he’d stopped in to torment the man about his interest in flying class.  The only difference was that the bulletin board out front was now noticeably absent of office hours.
Draco smiled sadly, more torn apart by that sentence than if Harry had reprimanded him for overstepping.  “And I think that
Now they were outside walking, though, and the stares were putting both of them on edge.  Not that people
.  Draco let his mind latch on the words as he was tugged gently away.  Something soft enveloped him, and then the world went mercifully dark.
Draco could see that Harry was hiding something from him – something to do with that mysterious allusion to “love” – and it needled him in a way that made him even more obstinate than usual.  “Harry, pass me that tome over there, won’t you?  I would get it myself, but I need some sort of sign that you’re as
, Draco corrected furiously – though he didn’t dare say it aloud for fear of proving Morpheus’ point.  Moments like this were easy enough to ignore as long as he pretended he was somewhere else.
The man’s clothes were the same, but the rest of his appearance had grown visibly ragged during his time in Azkaban.  His hair was thinner, cheeks gaunter, bags carving deep canyons under his eyes.  Those grey eyes gleamed with accusations he dared not make until Draco’s position was a little less precarious – that was the same too, it seemed.  He still acted like a politician.
and so Draco let himself smirk reassuringly as his eyes fell at last to Harry’s cock.  “Looks like I’m not the only one affected by our little duels,” he commented, erasing Harry’s self-doubt into a pleased glow of embarrassment.
Slughorn’s face reddened like a ripe tomato as he blustered to dispel the remark.  “I don’t think… I mean, I wouldn’t phrase it precisely like… You have to see, lad – I’ve been teaching here a long time, and-”
It was the kind of jibe he made on instinct, but Potter’s eyes locked on his with something dark and pained.  Before he could even reconsider his words, a desk to Draco’s left exploded.
VOLDEMORT: Do you have any plan to keep your honey from spilling out into the pan and making your dough too wet on the bottom?
Fenn laughed and took a swig of her drink.  She’d been drinking rather heavily tonight, but she still seemed to have her wits about her – at least compared to some of the others.  She wasn’t leading the crusade to get the group to play Truth or Hex, so that was something.
Draco let his eyes flutter shut for a moment in bliss – that he’d finally reached this moment.  This moment he’d self-sabotaged and fantasized about for most of his life.  He opened his eyes and considered Harry, to make sure it was real.  “Do you want me to be?”
FRED: Annnnnnd that’s it, gents!  Your final showstopper has reached its fraught and fantastic conclusion!
.  “Slytherin House couldn’t just put up some scary decorations, could they?” he asked with a tired amusement.
And, just like that, the imposing table shrunk to a regular-sized one, and the imposing Harry-painting melted into one of the Weasleys that hung on the wall at the Burrow.  Hermione’s eyes twinkled.  “I know,” she said simply.  “But you’re going about it all wrong.”
t/w: descriptions of consensual (but unpleasant) sex between Draco and someone other than Harry (in the past); Legilimency (reading minds) without consent
She appeared at the designated time with burrs tangled in her hair and green eyes wide from having apparently just undergone an ordeal.  “Professor?  You wanted to see me?”
Harry’s throat worked as he worked himself up to whatever he was going to say.  “W-well…first I thought of you…sucking my dick.  So suddenly like that…and how it felt so-” he trailed off in embarrassment.
It was thrown in defense, but Draco couldn’t help but grin like a loon as the implications of that sentence struck him.  “‘
’”  He drew back slightly so he could see the way the man’s eyes squeezed shut, how he swallowed a bit wretchedly.
Looking in the mirror had certainly been a shock – though, surprisingly, not an altogether unpleasant one.  Ron had finished the look with an ear-piercing spell (that Harry wasn’t likely to ever repeat) and pushed a stud through what he insisted was “the gay ear.”  He’d been doing a lot of research lately, after all, and the new magic-melding computers in the library had provided them both with a wealth of knowledge about queer-coded fashion that Harry had heretofore lived in ignorance of.
“Harry, you’re babbling,” Draco chastised lightly, catching Harry’s hands that had been flailing with emphasis.  “I know what bisexuality is.”
Harry bit his lip to keep from saying he’d ditched the dating advice book at the Weasleys before they’d even started the Horcrux hunt.  It had seemed unimportant at the time, and it seemed even less important now – though for entirely different reasons.
Darling, traitor son.  How has life been treating you recently?”  Lucius’ serpent-silver eyes landed on him with a particularly vicious gleam.  “Find any new sodomites to acquaint yourself with?”
.  He realized he cared more for the game than the winning – his eyes snapped to Potter, and then he was twisting and falling.  A flash of gold imprinted his sight as Potter’s fist wrapped around it-
His cheeks warmed just remembering it, as he geared up for Quidditch later.  He was doing up the laces on his boots when he felt a gentle punch to his shoulder.
Draco was so caught up in his thoughts that he nearly ran into McGonagall while turning a corner in the halls.
“Hiya,” burst out of him when he was several steps away.  He froze immediately, and it took his remaining courage not to turn around and run.
He must’ve pinkened like a sow, because Harry’s next move was to call him over with a little smile quirking his lip.  He patted his lap, and after a beat Draco realized what he was trying to get him to do.
Perhaps Potter had felt it too, but he was dissipating the aura with humor, quipping now about the cheeriness of the Slytherin dungeons.  To which Draco quipped about the favoritism of the Gryffindors.
Draco smirked wryly, unwilling to admit anything just yet.  “Nothing.  Some amusing presumptuousness.”
looking forward to Christmas this year – to gather my disinherited son, my deluded wife, and my dying self together in the joyous spirit of the holidays… Ahh, it shall be just like old times.”
“Oh.  Right.”  She fell into the opposite chair to face him.  “Harry was asking about you at lunch today.”
Caught, Harry remained staring down at their mostly-cleared plates.  He was pink to his ear-tips, which was what prompted Draco to lean across the table and whisper and toy with him some more.
you – I just thought it might give the wrong idea.  If I were to keep coming here after we’d broken up.”
But an hour passed, and things were starting to drag – the students must have been trickling down to the Ball, having seen the other Houses’ “decorations.”  Draco had been taking groups down to the dungeons almost constantly, but now he found himself sprawled in a chair by the common room, praying someone would come by.
“Maybe it just didn’t hear,” Draco said.  “Stripey jumpers!” he yelled, then “Jumpers with thumb-holes!  What does it mean?!”
Harry made a small sound in his throat, and Draco followed it – pressing desperate kisses from his jaw to his collarbone.  The man’s head fell back in pleasure, and Draco nearly combusted with delight.
Draco slipped back into himself with a jolt.  “You never even got a Potions Mastery, did you?”  He swiped mindlessly at the blood that had begun trickling from his nose.  “Did you?” he repeated.
Harry chewed on that for a minute before gathering himself to respond.  Draco half-expected him to refuse such a sorry excuse.  “I get that,” he said instead.  “But I’d like to know what’s going on if possible so I can help you.  Or just listen.  Sometimes having someone just
He sat back even further and narrowed his eyes at the man beneath him.  “I got those boots fourth year, and you
Thoughts of winning fled his mind as Malfoy’s tongue licked against his, and then he found himself helplessly—
Harry pouted a beat.  “I don’t see why you’re making it a big deal – it just makes you lie, yeah?  Can’t be too bad.”
The following week, Draco found himself once again sneaking into Potter’s classroom in the dead of night for the sake of a prank.  He’d always prided himself on being level-headed, but in situations like these, he had begun to wonder whether that had ever been true at all.  Potter brought out the crazy in him, for sure.
And, because Draco was feeling magnanimous, he agreed rather than provoking him further.  “Of course.  Students can be cruel – an unfortunate truth.”  As he said it, he wondered why he felt compelled to comfort the older man in front of him – a man who, for all intents and purposes, had disliked Draco since he first met him.
Draco closed his eyes against the onslaught, drawing in a long, deep breath as he wished to be literally anywhere else.  “This.  Isn’t.  About.  You.”
Draco repressed a surge of jealousy at the delicious and comforting-looking meal that was leagues above the things he’d ever gotten sent up to his room.  Potter had certainly done more to earn the adulation of the elves than he had himself, though.  With a sigh, he set out to do what he’d come to do – flicking his wand over the meal with muttered incantation.
“Alright, let’s see here,” the judge mumbled, flipping through her stack of papers.  “Sentenced to eighteen months, no wands; a check-in will occur at that time to determine the good faith and good behavior of the defendants, et cetera et cetera…”  She looked up at them over her horn-rimmed glasses and raised an unimpressed eyebrow.
He took another swig of drink, catching Gloria’s eyes flicking nervously towards him, and he interpreted it as another part of her unspoken mothering.  About which he was grateful, but also a little heartbroken, since one disappointed mother seemed rather enough.
Draco stared at him.  Harry’s face remained solemn for a few seconds, then his eyebrows wavered and his mouth cracked into an unstable grin.
Harry entered first, dodging the boy levitating with the force of Fizzing Whizzbees, and paused a moment before turning around.  His eyes catalogued the bluebell bubbles ricocheting around the room before settling back on Draco with unrestrained wonder.  His smile was radiant, and Draco wondered a bit whether it would smite him on the spot.
.  See, sometimes contestants bring us a dish that is severely overcooked on the outside, yet the flavors inside redeem it.  I can say with certainty that there is
.  Like it wasn’t year-old news that happened before any of their recent involvement.  Like Harry just might be able to interpret it as
After the games, Draco would drag himself upstairs, in various states of injury, to the staff bathroom.  To
But his pride forbade the very possibility of pity.  And he was still enough of an arse to keep Draco from feeling sorry for him.
HARRY: [confessional aside] Well, that went pretty well!  I wasn’t sure about the wild strawberry, so I’m glad they liked it in the end.
Draco nearly melted with relief – though there was still an edge to her tone that suggested that there was more than what she was saying.  Before he could answer, though, Harry cut in incredulously: “But Minerva – surely that can wait?  I have, err,
Ron clapped him on the back, and Harry knew it was time to go over there.  He muttered, “fresh produce, fresh produce, fresh produce” under his breath, and was about ten feet away from Malfoy when the man glanced up and noticed him.
But Potter was paling under his very gaze, and he realized it had been the wrong thing to say.  After a too-long pause, the man snapped back with, “No!
Surprising himself, Draco let out a short, tentative laugh at her joke.  She looked a little shocked as well, though not in a bad way.  “Yes.  Yes, it would,” he said with a shy, somewhat wry smile of his own.
Vaguely, he could hear them taking off around him as he arrived in front of the Green Flash.  Or what was left of it, anyway.
“I’m self-preserving,” he said instead, letting the banter take over naturally.  “It keeps me from looking as wretched as you do right now.”
Seeming to sense the bitterness in Draco’s tone, Harry brushed some bangs from Draco’s eyes and ran his hands down the side of his face in a soothing manner.  Draco leaned into the touch, feeling distinctly like that hippogriff Harry had tamed third year, his embarrassment only outweighed by the peace that overcame him.
When Harry continued to stare blankly at him, he elaborated.  “You were always getting into trouble – sassing people, starting fights, saving the world – and happiest when you were doing all three.  ‘Peaceful living’ – as you call it – was bound to be terrible for you.”  Which seemed, to him, incredibly obvious.
“No, I was just…saying hi.  I’m going back over there.”  He gestured weakly to where Ron was setting up Parcheesi with Hermione and Dean to either side of him; his friend had been forced to get into Muggle board games lately, after Hermione had endured one too many snaps exploding in her face.  The group was only several feet away, though, so the excuse was awfully flimsy.
Draco’s eyes narrowed at the seemingly-innocent question.  “Yes.  And you Hufflepuffs better not go stealing our ideas.  Not that I think you
But that wasn’t everything.  Perhaps this feeling was about Harry – those older emotions of inadequacy and jealousy rising up to drown him.  Here was a boy who’d had nothing and no one and had fought tooth and claw to protect the friendships he had earned.  And then, after finding out that one of those few, precious relationships was built on lies, he didn’t even have the capacity to fully
Potter’s face shifted subtly, but he was clearly still bothered by something, as he continued undeterred, “I, err, felt a little better, so I went and laid down for a bit in my room instead.  But thanks for checking on me, I guess.”
Several players in his periphery were mounting brooms and making substitutes, and it wasn’t until he saw Grant flying by with a beater’s bat and a laughing expression on his face that Draco came to his senses and took off as well.
.  But I’m glad you could paint yourself as the Byronic hero of this story, if it helps you sleep at night.”  She laughed, and the joy shook her whole body.  “Tricked by a seventh year,” she murmured, shaking her head in gleeful disbelief.
Draco was half annoyed that Harry was trying, half heartened by the gesture.  He continued to glare at his mother.
really liked him – at the time, Draco certainly hadn’t noticed anything, but if he delved really deeply into his memories, he seemed to recall Potter staring at the boy a fair bit.  Which made his heart twinge in a conflicted sort of way.
Draco was about to turn and ask Harry if they’d played innocent long enough – if they ought to maybe retire to a room back in the castle together – when he realized the man’s attention had been snagged by someone else.  “Hi Professor,” the kid was saying, “I didn’t expect to see you in Hogsmeade today.”
, come true, but also the crushing guilt of feeling like you’d misinterpreted and forced these feelings onto that person you’d come to care about.  And then, you couldn’t even just enjoy remembering the moments you spent together that got you excited, because your perception of them is forever changed by the fact that they didn’t feel the same way.  It’s just…it’s not fair.”
Draco waited for more.  There had to be more – some deeper explanation for reopening such deep-seated wounds.  There had to be.
They made it to the library without incident; Pince had gone to bed, so it was just a ghost or two on guard duty.  They were easy enough to get past, if you knew their habits enough to slip by.  Luckily, the magi-computers were in a separate little room that had been installed for the express purpose of limiting the amount of magic that would mess with the devices’ function.  But it also meant that they could close the door, cast a muffling charm, and then talk like normal people without anyone ever coming to check.
Draco nearly laughed at the greeting.  He didn’t get a chance though, as McGonagall turned and tutted, sending Potter leaping into the open chair.
Merlin, it truly felt like one of his schoolboy fantasies.  Had he ever heard Harry talk like this when they were both teenagers, he had no doubt their fun would’ve ended in a sticky, premature mess.
[The biscuits go in, the biscuits come out – over and over for the next 40 minutes.  In that time, DRACO has taken over a second work bench to spread his pieces out to cool.  HARRY pours caramel onto his base biscuit for the lake and begins frizzing trees out of the remaining sugar in the pot.  They work like madmen, and if it weren’t for their harried frustration, the scenes of CEDRIC would convince you that it’s a leisurely day.]
[Freeze frame.  The scene shifts to a pleasantly crowded cottage filled with a red-headed family along with HARRY.  Emcees FRED and GEORGE are present, as well as former contestants RON and GINNY.  Their mother, and well-beloved baking show host, MOLLY WEASLEY, steps into the frame with a pan of piping hot scones to entice the audience.  In the background, we see the famed ‘Weasley Clock’ with a different family member’s face over each of the numbers; it is currently pointed to ‘Charlie-o’clock.’]
“-and Ravenclaw’s common room kept reciting Poe!  And they even had a floorboard that popped up every few minutes to reveal an eye!”
The man reached for Draco’s belt, and he pushed him away as an instinctual reaction.  In this game of teasing and dominance, it felt wrong to let Harry undress him.  Too intimate, too revealing of his infinite softness for this man – the weakness he left unguarded now that it seemed things might go his way.
He swung open the door and watched the initial shock fall to disgust on Potter’s face.  “Malfoy.  What are you doing here?”  His voice was flat – completely changed from his previous tone – but it was the one he was used to hearing.
Draco repeated the length his mother had told him.  “At least he’s still an arse, or I’d know things were really serious,” he mused, startled by the sharp downturn of Harry’s lips at the comment.
you would actually pretend to be bad at a subject in order to spend time with someone.  That’s so debasing and also the oldest cliché in the book.”

Harry lurched forward, hands slipping clumsily over Draco’s belt.  It still felt terribly intimate – but more controlled now that he’d made Harry wait.  The leather slid smoothly from its binds, and each loop it passed made it harder for Draco to breathe.

He coughed a little at the bluntness, and felt a flush rising to his face.  “Yes...well…” he glanced around the room for inspiration, “Well, it’s not like everyone thinks of it that way, unfortunately.”  His eyes flickered back to Hannah to find her looking at him with a softer expression, like she’d just figured something out about him.  He wasn’t sure he liked it.
Draco entered the rest of the way at her gesture, finding a seat by her desk with a distinct prickle of embarrassment.  “I…er…  Well, it
Draco took a deep, steadying breath at the reminder of his father.  A selfish part of him wanted to berate the man for invading even a private moment like this.  But since that was impossible, he pressed a long, biting kiss to Harry’s neck instead.
Draco was in the middle of reinforcing a beam in the stands when McGonagall caught him off-guard.  “So, what are your intentions with Harry?”
Despite himself, Draco let out a dry chuckle, charmed.  “They say your ‘true’ feelings come out in times of duress.”
Draco tackled Harry, forcing him backwards onto the couch.  He climbed atop him, pinning his hands in a light display of dominance.  “Is this your way of complimenting my style, Potter?  There are more honest ways of doing so.”  He drifted his lips over Harry’s, smirking as the man tried – once again – to chase his lips as he pulled back.

I apologize that Harry has been largely absent from this/the last chapter 😅  Don't worry - he'll make his reappearance in the next one, I promise.  The boy just gets very angsty sometimes.
It was like the universe had conspired to obliterate his self-control through unrelenting proximity.
.  With Father in jail for another five months, and him and Mother banned from using magic for almost another year, they were each trapped in their own uncompromising hell.  But rather than bring them closer, it had only fractured them apart.
She momentarily halted her frenzied sorting of parchment scrolls on her desk to fix him with a hawkish glare.  “No.  And I’ve been asking around the staff to see if anyone knows
Draco walked up the path to the Manor, trying his best not to sick up in the hedges.  His stomach was twisting violently with nerves at the prospect of seeing Father, and not even the courage-boosting potion he’d brewed for himself this morning was enough to temper the anxiety.
The official documents lay forgotten now, as the judge leaned forward in her seat.  “And who did you perform this Legilimency on?”

Why would he be acting in alignment with these gay stereotypes if he wasn’t? – and the internet assured him that striped jumpers were
Harry seemed encouraged by the fact Draco hadn’t hexed him yet.  “And then,” he continued, “he’d prod them disdainfully with his cane and set them on fire or something, then order his house elves to purify the spot the package touched, so it didn’t ‘taint the Manor with poverty’ or whatever!”  He wrapped his fingers around Draco’s biceps, grounding himself in his hilarity.
“Mister Malfoy!” she called, as soon as he stepped into the room.  “Good!  I was hoping to run into you this morning.  Do you have any ideas as to why Harry didn’t attend his classes this morning?”

“Lucius, stop,” Narcissa cautioned, eyeing Draco warily as he took his seat.  As if he would flee so easily after psyching himself up to come.
Draco smiled.  He pushed into the locker room, holding the door behind him – only stopping when he realized Potter hadn’t moved to enter.  “Well, aren’t you coming?” he asked, glancing over his shoulder.
“It goes better when he’s not surrounded by Zabini and Parkinson.  And…I guess when I’m acting less hostile.”

“What?  No, I’m not doing that again.”  Sitting in Harry’s lap the last time had been both arousing and humiliating, and he’d decided then and there that he was unprepared to hand over so much of his dignity in one sitting – literally.

Only once he was gone did Draco finally break into a grin.  If there was something no one had the strength to ignore, it was Peeves’ cruel song parodies.
Thankfully, Draco was distracted by the delighted whispers of the second-years.  While none of them were in his flying class for obvious reasons, he recognized one or two of them as students who had come to him for Quidditch advice before the try-outs.  Apparently – judging by the curious glances and hesitant smiles – he wasn’t as disliked as he’d previously thought.
Draco leaned against the wall and waited for everyone to enter first while he tried his best to compose himself.  It had been over two weeks since he’d seen the man – would Draco lose it and do something to get himself fired?  The frustration and hurt within him were matched only by his rage, and that made him feel twitchy –
“Drink?”  Zabini offered him the bottle of firewhisky, but Harry shook his head, already formulating an escape route.
Draco glanced down the table to where the man chatted animatedly with Hannah and Longbottom.  He was glad to see he looked less dead today, even if it stung to be unwelcome in that radiant presence.  Lifting his utensils, he forced himself to eat more and look less.
“Oh, Draco…”  She petted a hand through his messy hair.  “That’s not true – you can still get out.  Get out while you can.  Don’t get stuck here like me.”
This time, they hadn’t even gotten their clothes off before Draco had shoved them into a shower stall.  Harry had only just started on his buttons – a task he quickly gave up when he realized they weren’t stopping.  Draco had pressed him into the spray, smirk sharp and hungry as Harry’s Quidditch leathers quickly began to soak through.
With an air of wonderment, Draco let his other palm come to rest on the bruising flesh.  He ghosted over the curves of it, groaning a little at the heat that radiated even through his gloves.  “
But Draco endured, gazing long and hard at the wide pupils and flash of color upon Harry’s cheeks.  That kind of lust was not a trifle to simply fade away.
Draco snorted lightly, then lifted his arm to inspect how far their semen had trickled down his wrist.  He felt marked by it, like their mixed seed was a physical consummation of some ancient, powerful spell, and his heart would never belong just to himself ever again.
; he just had to sit there, and Harry came up with strange and flirtatious interpretations of Draco’s actions on his own.  Like when he urged Draco not to fellate his bangers and mash at dinner, when it hadn’t even been on his mind (this time, at least).
He fidgeted with the fit of it, but it was still just as tight and uncomfortable as when he put it on.  “And I haven’t even
“Bye.”  Draco had half of his hand in a glove when Harry turned and disappeared in a panic.  He smiled slowly into the silence, letting the warmth from earlier fill him again.
Draco laughed, his body shaking like he’d just played a five-hour Quidditch match.  “No, you idiot.  It was
Hating himself for complying, he flipped through the pages now.  There.  On page seven, he found an article entitled:
[Overlay of GEORGE’s voice announcing, ‘And the person going home this week is………Ron!  Rotten luck, brother mine.  Time to go home and do your share of the dishes.’  RON doles out his hugs looking both shocked and like he’s endured some unspeakable loss.]
? Draco had lost his marbles all day trying to grapple with the fact He was a liar, that He was a murderer, and that was more than enough. But to think that He’s – that He’s what, exactly? The Dark Lord? His fucking relative? Some twisted, heinous reincarnation of him? Or in other words,
Anger, confusion, exhaustion, pain, everything was so overwhelming. Draco stared at him and didn’t understand a single thing. Harry cast him aside, Harry told him to leave, so what was he doing here now? What did he want from him, why did he come back, what did he think Draco could give him? What? He had nothing. “Harry, please. I… I don’t… please.”
“What is this? I thought you said you brought no more of your friends, boy?” Granger looking at him through Pansy’s face was whiter than chalk.
“Honestly, could you just…” Harry looked at him, miserable. “Just shut up, okay? I have zero patience for you today.”
“So why are we fighting?” Harry was at a complete loss. “Because I really care about you and you really care about me?”
It couldn’t have been love, for that’s not how love feels, and Draco knew that. He knew that because he did love, he loved Him, and so he knew what to expect. There was none of that mad, explosive way in which his heart beat whenever He was near. There wasn’t that painful longing whenever they were apart to always, always be near, to offer himself in that unrelenting way. There wasn’t this desperate, hopeless need to satisfy, to appease, to please. In all honesty, compared to Him, Draco’s relationship with Potter was dull.
“It’s complicated,” he said in the end, not feeling braver than that. “He had to leave. And I was… left alone.” Each word was a knife in his heart.
“Perhaps you have forgotten. Perhaps the time I spent away from my family has made you complacent. Do you need a reminder?” Lucius raised one fair eyebrow in an expression Draco has learned to copy. It was beyond bizarre seeing it on the older man now, after he himself wore it so many times.
“Where did you get that?” Harry asked, taking the bottle from his hands and whistling in appreciation. Malfoy simply shrugged as a response, then grabbed the bottle back and unscrewed the cork.
“Well, I may have made some, er, suggestions as to what those might entail. I’m afraid to say I may have gone a little too far - he did leave the office looking rather pale. But that was all a part of the test, only to see how he would react. He cares for you, Harry, a great deal. I understand it might be a little hard to believe now, but it is true.”
“Just go, Draco.” Harry wouldn’t look at him. He had his head in his hands and he wouldn’t look at him. Even beyond the fumes and yells in his head, Draco knew this would be the last time he'd ever see him, and it would end just like this; with Harry angry, disappointed, hurt, and all because of him. All because Draco was such a fucking piece of shit. “Nothing’s tying you here.”
“Yes.” Draco tried to swallow the words, but they came out anyway. “And you could… be in it, too.” It sounded crazy, went against his every instinct, but the thought of Harry in another room made him want to vomit. Even having him a few feet away on Draco’s mattress would be too far. Draco needed him here, his own personal savior, or he wouldn’t be able to breathe right. When Harry looked shocked, he thought perhaps he could do a slightly better job explaining it. “Erm, we could do it without touching. Just – just sleeping. If… you think that would be okay.”
, and there was nothing he could do about it. Nothing. When Potter knocked he opened – the door, his heart, anything. Whatever he’d ask for. Draco was very much the type of person to develop a… well, a slightly obsessive fixation on someone, and Potter was misfortunate enough to fall into this category of being someone. Because Draco had no one else. He just had no one else.
Harry had not been prepared, and Malfoy was right, he really couldn’t withstand it; the sudden attack was enough to break his shield. There was that hand again inside him, prying his thoughts open and touring in his memories. He twisted and writhed, trying to fight it, but it was no use. Malfoy’s fingers in his mind took hold with metallic talons. Harry was forced through what felt like a very narrow tunnel into a memory he didn’t recognize at first.
There it was again, that almost overwhelming craze to wrap the blond in a tight hug. If he weren’t careful, Harry might find himself leaping forwards, arms held wide open. He blinked the mental image out of his mind. “I’m glad to hear that, Malfoy. Truly, I’m glad.”
The others nodded, Draco obviously unwilling. As the three of them raised their vials to drink, he neared Harry.
“These scars are not what matters, Potter. You want to see proof, but… there's nothing I can show you that will make you understand. Nothing to show how... When I came out of Azkaban I was – broken. Entirely. I thought I'll never get back up again.”
being his friend? He forced himself to move past it, though, before he broke apart. This was a dangerous path to take, and he’d disappointed himself enough times by now to recognize it. No reason to cause more pain to his already weak psyche. Especially something like that which could cause damage deep enough to take him under.
The rest of it was far too awful and too hard to contemplate, but this Draco knew, had known for years: He was meant to love him. All three of them turned to him, a short pause in what seemed to be the most ridiculous fight Draco ever witnessed, and they all saw him slide down, all the way to the floor. To his surprise – that it to say, if he were able to feel anything at the moment, it would probably be surprise – Grove turned to Him before moving closer. It was outrageous to see the man who haunted his nightmares for years asking for permission.
“I get what you mean. Sometimes I wish I could do the same – haven't trusted the papers since about third year, anyway.” Potter sighed, tapping the table. “The stories I brought you did check out, though. I ran your mother’s profile in our database. The details seem to match.”
“Yes, well, but he’s not even been renting it. There are no contracts or anything whatsoever suggesting anyone’s even lived there in the last ten years. Don’t you think it’s a bit odd, that he simply doesn’t exist in the flat on record? Why would he be hiding?”
Revulsion was dashing through him in a zigzag pattern, and he was close to giving up. He didn’t, though, gods know why. He knew he knows, and still he asked, “Abroad?”
Draco didn’t honestly think he will make it. He had no doubt this will be the thing that breaks him. However, he thought that by this point, there was no going back. He imagined he will be raped repeatedly into his death, and for once found no consolation in the thought of his demise. He just didn’t see any other way. Whatever it was that kept him from giving up was still there, and so Draco saw himself as doomed. He even tried to convince himself it won’t be that bad. What’s rape compared to the Cruciatus curse, right? Still, the rumbling in his gut told him it would be something else entirely. When he pictured the look on Greyback’s face, he actually felt faint. A small voice in his head told him very simply he could not do it. He just couldn’t. No matter what they want from him, no matter what they ask for, he must relent. He must, because he can’t do it. This was too much, way too much, and it was where he put the line, so to speak. Yet he didn’t.
But safe, was he safe, he was never safe, he was – he was – fuck, fuck, wait, fuck – and David – and Delilah – Butterfly Lady – thirteen people in a party
It hurt, but then he saw something that made him forget all about it. The bracelet – Draco’s breath hitched when he spotted it, his fingers aching to grab. Fucking gods, there it was, all this time – all this time right here in the flat, and he never even considering trying to get it, his most precious possession, the most valuable thing he had. His most precious possession which He gave him, then took away. That He
All in all it was maybe five spoonfuls, and it wasn’t nearly enough. When Draco was propped to his hands and knees he wondered if it was maybe worth it. Maybe he would let them do anything to him if they just let him eat. Maybe he would –
“Five,” Harry shook his head. “Five, and if we want you to, you testify against any one of them who's ever – “
Even the speed of light wasn’t fast enough; Draco tore the space of the room, nearly face-planting on the floor in his hurry, and it took less than a millisecond before he put himself between His raised wand and petrified Pansy (hopefully not by a spell, but who the hell had time to check).
“No, Draco, honestly – I’m an Auror, right? I know a little about these things. Please, if you can just trust me – “
Harry nodded, shutting his eyes again. He tried to think of something to focus on, but his mind was oddly blank. What was a part of him, on which he didn’t need to think? And how come, in Merlin’s beard, Malfoy touching him was something he found so natural?
No, no he wasn’t – no, nothing was – no, it was simply impossible, it couldn’t be happening, it – and the realization was so heavy, Draco might have actually passed out again; it was something he never really grasped and always had known. Something that was so obvious he would never have guessed it:
Draco tried to focus on his list, his ever growing list of sins. There were so many, it would have been hard to retrieve - would have been had he not kept it religiously, obsessively. He could recite it by heart, even now, in the midst of his wreckage: he joined the Dark Lord. He used Unforgivable curses, hurt others, tortured innocent people. He was evil and arrogant and bigoted and cruel. He actively tried to murder Dumbledore. He hurt Ronald Weasley and Katie Bell and Madam Rosmerta. He let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. He was the reason Vince died, that Greg killed himself. He put Pansy’s life in danger, his mother’s life in danger. He hurt his father. He betrayed Him. He lied to Harry and betrayed his trust. He hurt him.
“Just you,” Draco whispered, and already his eyes were closing. Harry’s ribs gave up and cracked open, and now his heart took every single inch of his chest. Harry climbed up onto the bed and held Draco, and the little approving ‘hmm’ he got was the single best sound he’d ever heard. He didn’t fall asleep that night either, but he didn’t really need sleep anymore. Just like he didn’t need air, or his ribs, or anything in fact that didn’t start and end with Draco. Now that he had him back – now that they were truly together again – he could be calm.
“Ah, that. Well, yes, we have,” Harry said sheepishly, but he was slowly regaining his cool. Hermione talking about learning, Ron squeamish about details – these were his friends, the people who knew him best in the world. And if they’re telling him they’re
. Which was… sobering, in a way. Draco had been left totally flabbergasted by all those emotions that suddenly returned to him full-force, and it was a whirlwind to try to control them, but this one he recognized. This specific emotion was almost easy. Being angry with Harry Potter was something he was good at. He exceled at it from a very young age, and doing it now made him feel more like himself than he had in years. “Harry, you bloody arse. Will you just listen?”
“I know it’s a shit apology, I wouldn’t take it either if I were you. I just couldn’t handle it any other way. All of Wednesday – hell, up until tonight, I was in shambles. And I wanted to see you, needed to see you, I just didn’t know if… didn’t know how to… I was so angry.”
“You don’t understand even half of it, Potter,” Malfoy spat, annoyed. “And I’m really not going to explain any further. Now are we done here, or were you actually hoping to use any of these torture devices on me?”
Draco didn’t know how to respond to that, so he just shrugged and careened over to the uncomfortable plastic chairs. Harry followed suit, plopping loudly next to him. “Draco?”
But how could he possibly take it? There was no chance, not ever, that he could actually go forward and do it. Him? Doing something? What a ridiculous concept. He couldn’t even speak
Draco took an excruciatingly long pause, but no one seemed able to move an inch, and he had no choice but to continue. The corner of the rug he was focusing on was beginning to look a little fuzzy. “He made it very clear. I killed a man, an Azkaban guard, and there were only two options. Wait for them to catch me and go back to prison for life – or go with Him. I think you all know which one I chose.” He waited for a comment, for someone to say what an utter fool he was, but none came. Maybe the others weren’t listening anymore. Or maybe they’d all just been paralyzed with terror, like him. “He took me to this bungalow somewhere remote, in the middle of a forest. Could have even been in Albania actually, I have no idea, hardly spent any time outside. But while we were there, He, er… well.”
? He wasn’t even a little familiar with the meaning of the concept. With his tales of horror and gore, his unstable and dangerous personality, he was making Potter
“No, I think I’m done for the night. You can have the rest of it, I see the way you’re eyeing it up. Do they not feed you at work?”
“Harry,” he said once more, because he could. It wasn’t easy, though. His voice cracked halfway through, and he tasted more blood in his mouth.
“Shh,” Harry squeezed his hand once, twice, “Shh, Draco, it’s all right, it’s going to be okay, you’re all right… please, calm down, calm down, you’re all right…”
“Of course not,” Lucius said, masking Granger’s stunned gasp. “Where is he, Draco? And why haven’t you told me?”
All right, he told himself after laying out all the ingredients on the marble counter. Step by step, Draco. Nothing to worry about here. This is just a simple meal you are cooking for someone who doesn’t really expect much of you. Someone who just happens to be the best person in the world and whose smile could make cities rise and fall. A man whom Draco did not, under any circumstances, love, and with whom he would never stand any sort of chance. It was important to remind himself of that sometimes, when he was getting really frisky in his own head. The simple, honest-to-Merlin truth of it all. Draco was maybe not so much His anymore, with everything he's done, but he certainly wasn’t anyone else’s, and he never will be.
“No, it’s not that at all! I know you care more about him than about almost anything. This is precisely why we have to go to Dumbledore.” Her pleading tone melted the last defenses in his heart. Broken he turned to his other best friend.
On the first lesson on Tuesday, Transfiguration, Harry finally spotted his blond head. He laughed in a combination of anger and relief, and Ron and Hermione, who were very careful around him since Sunday, seemed to relax as well. By the end of the lesson Harry managed to send Malfoy a note, and received his confirmation. They agreed to meet in the Room of Requirement that night. Harry was giddy and antsy all day, and wasn’t able at all to control his mood. Quite frankly, he was frightened. He had no idea why the thought that something might have happened to the Slytherin bothered him so much. Maybe it was the notion that if it had, it was his fault; maybe it was because he was slowly but surely getting himself invested in the other boy. Whatever it was, Harry knew it was trouble, and the other two weren’t helping him calm down. They seemed even more puzzled than he was with his change of mind about Malfoy. He was tired of trying to explain to Ron that he didn’t necessarily like Malfoy now, it was just that… damn it. It was just that he wanted to save him.
Draco did not know what to expect, but he definitely did not expect his father. Lucius stood next to the bed, alone, looking at him with an expression Draco almost recognized.
. I have no desire to be rescued or fought for – in fact, I’m quite capable of fighting my own battles. The dragon is gone; if you wish to meet her, I could point you in the right direction. Now, if that’ll be all…”
“I feel like I abandoned you,” he admitted, and his voice wavered. “It’s just so unfair, because it wasn’t your fault. You didn’t deserve this from me. You probably wondered where I’d been, and I was just… I wanted to come, every night I wanted to. I know how much you – I know that you need it to be – urgh, I just fucked up, Draco. I can’t excuse my behavior. I wanted so bad to be someone you could count on, I still do. But I was so out of it, I was scared I’d hurt you by accident. Then I just ended up hurting you anyway.”
“Oh,” Hermione said in her best imitation of nonchalant. “Right. Well, he didn’t say anything special, anything we… didn’t expect him to say.” There was a definite tinge of pink on her cheeks.
“Yes, I’m aware,” Harry smirked. He returned his gaze to the fire, staring at it dreamily. “Ron, it was amazing. Really. Best thing I ever did.”
“Oh, Harry, that's just time. At first you were shocked, and then you started processing it, and now you’re… you’re still dealing with it, but of course it’s different. It's totaly normal. And I think all the scheming with Malfoy is helping you in a way to cope.”
Draco huffed a painful sigh. “What do you think He will do to the man I’ve actually kissed? Multiple times?”
The Death Eaters weren’t going all out; the cage was rather small and didn’t allow much room for really extravagant moves. Draco was subjected to some painful curses in the past, so he knew fairly well what to expect, and so far they weren’t exceeding it. He knew, of course, that once the Dark Lord arrives the level is going to increase substantially. Perhaps to such height he would no longer be able to stand - at some point he lost track and could no longer care. The time was running out for the potion anyway. Somewhere in him he wondered what was taking so long, why He wasn’t here yet. The majority of him was focused on drawing one breath at a time.
“No!” Harry said quickly.  “No, it’s just… I’m just… You surprised me, is all.”  He didn’t know what made him say it, but he had no better excuses at the moment, anyway.
been staring at them in the restaurant, it was just that there had been a limited number of people who
It would be exciting, really, if Harry wasn’t about to try and seduce Draco Malfoy.  The thought left him nervous enough that he feared he would pass out – or punch him by accident, or something.  Maybe his brain would overheat, and he’d fall back into his old habit of “fight first, justify later” – then he’d
Potter didn’t visit him the next day or, even, the following.  In fact, the most Draco heard as a result of his prank was a flustered McGonagall racing down the hall that afternoon, muttering “Bats!  Who in their
Draco took a moment to size Harry up in the most theatrical way possible.  “Merlin, Potter!  How did you describe me?”
– no elaboration, no note.  But the delivery had felt much like those mornings Father would throw the paper on the table in disgust – not even saying anything, just expecting Draco to pick it up and read it to understand his disappointment.
“Or perhaps you’re over that, now that you’ve bagged the most famous of the lot.  Tell me, does he dress like that on purpose?  Or is it some unfathomable new-money trend?  If you ask me-” which no one had, “once a pauper,
