“Yes, ma’am.”
But Malfoy was looking at him oddly. Not angry—it was something else. “You didn’t use your wand. Again. Is wandless magic really that easy for you? It took me years to get one or two small spells.”
Ron didn’t care. “Stick with fish and chips if you like. Meanwhile, Hermione and I will sample all the delicious foods of the world, won’t we, Hermsy?”
At that point, Harry—and he was sure nearly everyone else—was feeling a very acute and terrifying sensation. Because it was brilliant. It was the best thing he’d ever eaten in his life; it was better than anything Hogwarts had ever served; it was, horrifyingly,
“You’ve come,” she said, her voice hoarse. The translation spell grated against Draco’s ears, but his Greek was too rough to go without it. “We were afraid you would not.”
“Good. I do fine with the meditation, but when I try to visualise, I don’t get anything. I know I’m doing it right.”
The cobbled pathway leading to the front door was crowded with the press and other gawkers, but Millicent got through with a stern glare while Harry led Malfoy around the crowd through the neighbour’s drive, taking care to step only on the pavers that lined the flower beds, so their footprints wouldn’t show.
Potter was losing his magic.
, Harry says.
Oh, well. At least he’d tried.
“It changes the wizard enough to override his original form,” Snape insisted. “How then, is he able to transform into his Animagus while under the effect of the potion in the first place?”
He hoped they were doing the right thing. A small part of him wanted to un-link his hands and step back from the ritual circle. He was afraid they were incorrect, that they would damn them all to experimentation under Muggle hands. The rest of him knew that they
“Ready for class?” Dudley asked.
Harry was silent for a moment, thinking. He masked it by shuffling through his trunk, on an extended hunt for his ‘best cloak’. He didn’t even have a best cloak, he didn’t think. Maybe he should get one. Did Hufflepuff suit him? Did he feel comfortable here, in this cosy dorm room, with two of the windows facing the setting sun, and sunset light streaming in over his bed quilt and Malfoy’s hair, as he stared into his wardrobe, presumably choosing from a number of ‘best cloaks’?
Hermione turned at his exclamation, but she was far enough away now that the boggart didn’t notice her attention. He heard her gasp. “Harry,” she whispered.
“Conjure yourself a chair,” Draco said, waving vaguely at them. “Weasley, better do one for Potter. He’s probably still fucked from his stupid spell. I’ll be back in a moment. I need to check on my class.”
“I can,” said Malfoy, “but it’s a very nice vintage Chanel. Are you sure you want to risk it?”
Harry laughed, even though he tried not to. He scrambled up, hoping he hadn’t inadvertently sat on a treacle tart or similar—he did love treacle tart. There didn’t seem to be anything there, until—
“I know,” Draco said. “This is Elias d’Malfoy. My great grandfather, ten times removed. He was a Metamorphmagus, and hanged for it shortly before his twenty-eighth birthday. At least he managed to reproduce, or else our line would’ve ended before Hogwarts.
“As you say,” Coddler said and upon a nod from Harry, promptly banished the cloak back to its display. “Now we have the standard Head of Family winter cloak here,” he continued, pointing to the second. The jackalope fur can be replaced with mundane rabbit or shearling upon request. Some prefer a kelpie lining on the inside - it does offer extended weatherproofing. The crest could either cover the back, be placed more classically on the chest, or be woven into the interior lining in a blocked pattern. Any option will include the Potter family standard protection spells in the weave, of course.
There were children Scorpius’s age jumping off of roofs and fluttering safely to the ground, and others gutting fish with knives, their little tongues sticking from their mouths while enterprising dogs licked up the refuse by their feet.
with a tailoring spell.
“Ast…” Draco swallowed. “Astoria has full custody of Scorpius now. I made arrangements earlier in the week. But she knows the importance of keeping Scorpius with the Demiguise-dog.”
“Brill, thanks, Mum.”
Draco leaned in and nosed his neck, very briefly. When he raised his head again, his cheeks were pink. “Goodnight, Harry.”
“He should’ve just Obliviated the Muggles and shut up about it,” Anthony agreed.
“It’s Australia,” said Harry. “And February. And we’re in a desert, basically.” It was easily 28C. Why anyone would wear a suit to a rock was beyond Harry.
“I remember that,” said Luna. “Draco was very good at distracting himself from things he didn’t want to think about.”
“Ah, perfect! My lovely boys, lined up all in a row,” she said, smiling at the display on her DSLR. She looked up at them and beamed. “I’m doing a post on New Year’s Eve traditions, both new and old. Did Teddy tell you his news?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, his voice, too, cracking.
Harry waved his hand to open the door. Malfoy stood there, blinking at the quick open and the crowd of people in Harry’s sitting room.
Their Portkey took all three of them plus the Disillusioned alien to the Queen’s private garden. The reporters and other assembled Muggles were already waiting, some with cameras already rolling. There were scattered shrieks of alarm as they materialised in the garden, and Harry had his wand out immediately before he realised what was going on.
A sharp flash hit Harry in the gut, but he ignored it. He’d known that. He’d known they would be without magic. He nodded. “Did it work?”
Harry realised his mistake too late; already predictions of what Malfoy’s naked body looked like were swimming in his head. Malfoy elegantly bent over a cauldron, steam reddening his cheeks. Malfoy getting too hot and removing his lab robes. Malfoy rolling up his sleeves, showing off his colourfully defiant sleeve tattoo, wiping the sweat from his brow, turning to Harry and overcharging him for litmus strips and then unbuttoning his shirt and trousers, his cock springing free—
Potter shuffled uncomfortably. Draco sighed, flopped back on his bunk. Potter had no subtlety. No finesse.
His heart was pounding wildly as he climbed the few steps to the top of the dais where the podium, stool, and head table were. Just over seven years ago, he’d done this same thing, and not been half afraid as he was now. If he were sorted into Slytherin tonight, he’d never make it out of that dungeon alive. Surely McGonagall wouldn’t throw him to those snakes and leave him to fend for himself?
“Lips sealed on all events from this point forward. We will never get glory for this,” Alick reminded them solemnly. “But I know you all know that and you don’t care. Much.” They laughed, nervously. “Ventilation charms up before we near the landfill, if you please!”
The creatures followed them all the way to the edge of the Forest, where they stopped, and stared after Draco from the safety of the trees. But Draco hesitated a few feet beyond the Forest, his brow scrunching up in something like confusion.
“No!” said Potter and Weasley together.
“I want you,” Draco agreed.
he wrote. And then below it, the Floo password for Malfoy Manor.
, he thought. He didn’t care.
“Mister Malfoy, Mister Potter!” one of the reporters—the one who’d reminded Harry of Hermione—called. “Puebla Piazza,
“It was the time McGonagall barged in to tell you off for making Augusta-Alice Longbottom cry, and you—”
of stuff.” He detached himself and started leading Harry back towards the kitchen, chattering all the while. Harry nodded along, trying to give Teddy his full attention, but unable to quite do so with Draco’s voice drifting out from the kitchen. His body was on high alert. There was something in him that both resisted going in that room and couldn’t wait to get there.
“It’s not enough,” Hermione said. “It takes a life, too.”
Draco cocked a grin, lopsided and entirely too much for Harry to endure. “One must certainly appreciate your panurgic nature, Granger. You didn’t quite beat me to the transformation, but you’ve certainly beat me for flair. I didn’t realise it was even possible to have an existing animal as your form, but where there’s a Potter, there’s a way, and you do spend rather a lot of time with him.”
“Didn’t I what?” Hermione asks.
He looked down, through the invisible dog on his lap to his naked chest beneath, where there was a huge, smeared streak of black, black blood. He swallowed.
Draco slowly approached, coming round behind Potter to glance over his shoulder. The being came into view and Draco gasped, grabbing hold of Potter’s biceps to steady himself and not remembering to let go until Potter made a note of pain, low in his throat. Draco loosened his fingers, but held on.
“She hated
The alien was deathly white, unnaturally so. There was no melanin to protect this creature from sunlight, suggesting it hadn’t left its spaceship for more than a few nighttime outings in generations. It was long and thin, lacking almost any musculature, its body more a vehicle for the mind. It wore a top and trousers, both made of the same shiny, unnatural-looking metallic fabric, and its shoes were no more than slippers.
“I did,” Harry agreed. “I just wasn’t sure I wasn’t going mad. You actually
“No, Galene.” Sostrate peeked one eye open and glanced at the elf, adding, “I will miss you; you’ve always gone above and beyond for me.”
Draco says it again now because it’s equally appropriate. Harry has, once again, dragged him into one of those ‘only happens in late-night WWN stories’ circumstances.
The story of Harry’s rescue of Draco, and Shaadhon’s subsequent rescue of Harry, has made the rounds around the London Ministry. Dawlish’s already offered him his job back, but there’s no fucking way. Still, it’s a nice little ‘fuck you’ to all the Aurors who always thought he was incapable of being present enough in a danger situation to even know when another Auror needed rescuing. And it’s also kind of humiliating to be rescued by a juvenile Manticore, but whatever. He’s never going back to London anyway. They can laugh all they want.
?” Draco repeated, just to be sure. “Who could hate magic?’

... he’s not. He
“One,” said Draco. “I saw a kelpie in the Puget Sound.”
And not even in any substantial way. But Malfoy, unlike other magically raised people, was taking this weirdness seriously, and Harry felt a strange kinship with him because of it. Ron thought it was a bit of an overreaction, and Gin did, too. But Harry knew it wasn’t, and Malfoy agreed, and that…felt like they were on some wavelength together. Malfoy
Malfoy paused, but he didn’t look pleased about it. Harry didn’t care. He still needed to get an O, whether he got to satisfy his morbid curiosity about Malfoy in the interim or not. “Wait—could you just, maybe tell me where I could start then? A book that would explain the foundations to me in…I don’t know, muggleborn terms?”
in such a way. In any way, really. This crush seemed to be worsening instead of lessening.
Shortly after the sounds in the Aurory picked up, Ron came in with a cup of tea and a plate of jammy toast.

“Worse,” Potter said, staring at the tent flap.
“How do you know?”
There was a Danish concept:
“Well, not really,” said Harry. “I mean, they did transmute a really tiny bit of gold a few times, but it was radioactive, and I think it decayed back into mercury or something anyway.”
“Is there a problem with rain?” asked Griphook. “Does it not water the soil that grows the tubers?”
And now, Harry
“Can’t we, like, summon him or something?”
before Millicent et al. got it to the press conference.
She fluttered a hand at him. “As you say, Mr Potter, but even if I weren’t inclined to, that cat isn’t worth anything to a wizard. I couldn’t charge
He picked up the stirring rod, and began again, stirring anticlockwise. “One,” he whispered, and Draco pressed in further, one arm coming all around to hold his waist, his chest flush against Harry’s back, and he was
Samhain was the beginning of winter for the druids, and they considered it a greater sabbat celebration. It was marked by the belief, later verified by magical researchers, that the veil between the living world and the dead world was much thinner on that night. It was good for divination and charms that worked on the soul. It was good for magic that needed help from beyond. Harry didn’t know that theirs would, but he supposed it couldn’t hurt.
She shrugged. “I have another job. And we have two children who need a parent good at defensive magic. You’re better at it than me.”
Harry waved a hand. “Oh, I’ll pick one up in London tomorrow.”
“No,” Harry whispered, his voice raw with a sudden onslaught of desire.
“Do magical people have sixth senses?” Dudley asked.
“You could’ve saved yourself from drowning,” Draco said. “You saved me from it.”
“You may.”
Eloise said, “We should all learn as much as we can. We don’t want to accidentally create something worse than we started with. And Draco – do you think your Massachusetts relatives are going to help put any pressure on the MUS to relieve the sanctions? Our economy’s already suffering from the tea and broom embargoes. Added stress on the people is really the last thing we need; it’ll make magic go haywire.”
It seemed that it was only minutes before the floo activated again and Lavender stepped out, followed by her mum, who was carrying a huge plate of pies and pasties. The quiet murmur of sleepy, happy voices changed to something much louder and more exuberant when she ran to hug Ron, and began chattering happily about all the things she’d been doing during her time off from the Aurory.
Draco smirked against his lips. “Not anymore. Results came today, while you were in exam. You may call me
He put the Stone away and moved to lay down on the bed next to Draco. Harry curled himself around Draco’s body, and sighed in relief when Draco’s fingers came up to card through his hair. He closed his eyes and breathed in Draco’s scent as the voices downstairs erupted in cheers. Mr Weasley drunkenly began a rousing rendition of
“Oh, god,” Draco said, his face scrunched. “We’re all dandies, aren’t we? Potter was on my bum in the barrels, and Goldstein likes princess stories, and Longbottom’s always had an eye for me–”
“Where I’m very similar to the rest of you,” the Queen said, “they are much different. Evolution has changed us dramatically.”
They could only go to ground, wait it out in a safe place while they developed as a species.
Luna noted this down. “I think it’s lovely that Ron is so comfortable with you dating his wife. Do you think you’ve always been in love with both of them or were you in love with Ron first and you fell in love with Hermione later because you realized that love transcends gender?”
“We’re
Six months ago, none of them had even believed the legends that the druids linked Britain’s magic to flowers. Tonight, they were undoing that legend. There was no going back.
because every one of them are British citizens, even Proulx and Malfoy, despite how French they’d like us all to believe they are!”
“Afraid so,” Draco says.
“Right. Anyway,” said Harry. “We should find a place to sit down and talk.”
Michael took his Snitch and returned to his place in the lineup.
Harry sat up. “That’s perfect.”
“Well, Gawain’s family friends with the Malfoys,” said Ron.
Narcissa smiled.
He’s still in bed at the time, in that drowsy, foggy, delicious state between sleeping and waking when one’s imagination is so fiercely in control that dreams give off visceral sensations that anyone would swear is real. Outside their flat, the holiday lights over London Bridge are shining, bright with festive cheer even at this hour.
When Quincy opened the door to their flat, Harry was immediately assaulted with the strangest almost-Christmas smells. It was like pine needles mixed with arsenic and gingerbread mixed with sweet rot.
He looked drunk, disoriented. Even in spirit form, his lips were blue, and Harry
Professor Switch rolled her eyes.
“What?” Harry says.
Harry tried not to be too pleased with Draco calling him friend. It was well on the way to calling him
“Merlin save me,” Draco muttered.
He’d never realised kissing someone could be so good, that it could make his whole body light up like the purple and orange fairy lights down in Hogsmeade. His hips pushed against Draco’s of their own volition and—Merlin, yes—they were both hard.
“That will be up to Professor Snape,” she said, blinking quickly.
Gratefully, Harry did. He was very pleased to discover that the wooden floors in Malfoy’s quarters had Warming Charms built in. A brilliant idea, which Harry should’ve implemented eleven years ago.
“You know I don’t read that rubbish.
When his suite was empty again, Draco fell back onto the sofa, letting out a long sigh. A throat clearing above the fireplace reminded him that he was, in fact, still on display. Draco rolled his head in the direction of the portrait, eyes narrowed.
“I left out fugly,” said Harry. “I was being polite.”
Suddenly, he felt another presence in the room and his body went stiff with terror. He couldn’t move his legs, his arms. He could barely draw breath. He’d been afraid before, but never like this, never physically unable to move even a finger. Harry began to struggle, feeling as if he were in a nightmare and surely he’d wake up soon.
They stood, and Potter and Draco made their way out of her office and up to Potter’s rooms, while Millicent ran to her own to pack her necessities. From there, they called an elf to them—not Kreacher, since the Ministry would question him first—and sent her to gather Draco’s most important books, clothes, money, and a few treasured pictures of Astoria, Scorpius, and his parents. He wished he could tell Pansy where he was going; wished he could say goodbye to her. But he couldn’t put her in that position. He couldn’t drag her into scandal again, not when she’d finally redeemed her own name.
‘It’ll be good to make your own connections,’ Padma had told her at one of their recent wedding planning meetings.
“You always have a plan!” Millicent said, and suddenly she burst into tears. “That’s what you do. You have plans and save the fucking day. You have to save the day now, too! You can’t just save the day when it’s Gryffindors; you have to do it for Muggles and Slytherins, too!”
“I know what it is!” Narcissa said, gathering herself. She shook her head, as if trying to clear it. “I remember you,” she hissed, stalking towards the bound alien, her wand raised. “That day I lost several hours…this thing was there…I remember now.”
“What will you name them?” Narcissa asks then. She pauses delicately. “I do hope not Narcius, darling,” she adds to Draco.
He wished he could talk to his family, to Hermione. Get her advice and tell them all he was sorry for doing this without telling them, but not sorry if it saved their arses from certain death. He wished he could talk to the Queen, or Snape, or Dumbledore, or anyone who had more sense than him and Malfoy and Millicent—which, given their actions, could be argued wasn’t much.
Harry smirked. “Nope. I’ll show you mine when you show me yours.”
“Fine, Draco!” Snape said. “Do as you wish! Carry the fucking Poisoned stone around in your fucking pocket if you so desire. It is
Much like the shopkeeper, Ron whistled lowly. “Merlin, Harry,” he said. He stared at him, eyes wide, and nearly walked into an old witch carrying a little basket of dissected slugs.
Reynolds falls to his knees in front of Harry and immediately starts casting shaky skin-knitting spells over him.
“I’m sleeping,” he said.
“I got loads of insider secrets,” Hermione explained one evening at Harry’s flat, while they ate curry from takeaway boxes and read each other the letters from Hogwarts that their kids had sent them. Both Rosie and Teddy had ended up in Ravenclaw, to no one’s surprise.
“Mate, I’m really sorry,” Harry said. He was already reaching for the biscuit tin and crumbling in a gingersnap. Seabiscuit didn’t emerge from his castle, even though it was his favourite. Harry despaired. “Biscuit, come on buddy. It was just a couple days. I’ve been really busy and stressed out. I totally forgot.”
“Hey, Harry! Hey, Draco!”
Potter crossed his legs, leant forward in his chair in a way that made Draco want the same focus and attention given to him. Potter was all-or-nothing; he cared immensely, or not at all. “Your return to the world—to this time—was not a coincidence, was it? Other things are happening, and even the Muggles have made that connection, although I hope they’re making the wrong one.”
Harry glanced up and saw that Draco’s hair was sticking to his face, just as it had in his lab at Hogwarts when Harry used to visit him. He swallowed, feeling a sudden rush of longing. What were they doing? Could it last? What if Harry was just setting himself up for more heartache?
“Look, Draco, the thing is… the thing is, I saw something wrong with our lives when Murdoch sent us over there. I figured that if we still couldn’t just live our lives, after thirteen years, then we’d never be able to live them over here. And I wanted to
The lad behind the counter smiled at them as they came in; Harry ordered them three cappuccinos to give them something warm to sip on, a reason to sit and watch television for awhile.
“Heartbreak?” Ron guesses. (A lie—he’s psychic. And perfectly present.)
Her mouth worked through several expressions, finally settling into a grimace. “Something happened to me a few weeks ago. I started to feel—odd. Different. I didn’t like foods I’d liked before. I remembered things I’d long forgotten. Piers Morgan made me so angry I had to turn off
“What abou—” he says before it cuts out again, and that’s when he realises that he’d vocalised an entire sentence and a half.
“Oh god, yes,” Harry said.
“I’m fine, I’m fine,” said Petunia. “Where are you?”
Ron passed him one from his own plate, a true friend. “How’s Hufflepuff?”
Harry grinned, leaned forward conspiratorially. People always liked when they felt like Harry Potter was giving them special attention. “How about private seats down with the English National Team?”
They dumped their bags on the table in the sitting room and Harry summoned a stack of books from his bedside table. He heard Severia yelp and when the books floated over to him, she was atop
“The car’s just this way,” said Quincy. “Let’s get home and get you something to eat.”
“Volcanoes,” Hermione repeated slowly.
Annoyed, Draco shook that off. He had a rare evening alone, and tomorrow was going to be a clusterfuck, and there was no sense in being maudlin over something so ridiculous as where Scorpius spent the night.
“Thanks,” he said, finally.
“Fine! It’s a date, Potter.”
He leaned in to kiss Harry again, and Harry took a hasty step back. “I did it for Scorpius,” Harry said. “Not for you.”
She shrugs. “I know. Neither are you. That’s why we’ve ended up
Harry hesitated because his first instinct was it would be the right thing to do, and his next instinct was ‘Fuck, no.’ Then there was the third instinct, the one that really was integrated into his bones and blood like instinct was meant to be:
“Right,” Harry said, after a moment. “Then, the next thing we need to do is find a way to coordinate with volunteer Muggles and…and just do the spell.”
choice at all.”
Apex looks up at Harry over her reading glasses. She’s not happy. None of them are. Probably doesn’t help it’s
Finian was with Hermione, but his guesses were so pathetically off the mark that Harry couldn’t even react to them. But then came Malfoy, who was alone since Michael Corner was currently being treated for caterpillar burn at the hospital in Mykonos.
He threw a wave over his shoulder as he ushered the kids out. Despite Ms Williams’s prodding, Ms Lovecraft was noticeably anxious stepping out onto Charing Cross.
“Can we fix that?” asked Lee.
Harry nodded. He couldn’t stop thinking of that feeling he’d got when he cast the spell on the soil. It had felt like he’d been shocked right in his solar plexus and the charge had travelled down, into his bellybutton. The longer he thought about it, the scarier it got. Is that where all his magic was?
. Fuck your light magic and your pretentious definitions of
She gave him a tragic look and he knew they were both thinking the same thing, that Al was the only one they had, their only living son. He was more valuable than gold to both of them. They had to do ridiculously annoying things like take probably unnecessary precautions, because his life was everything. Sometimes, that made it hard for Harry to remember to just enjoy hanging out with him.
Just then, the Floo roared to life again, and another person stepped out. Draco turned quickly towards it, his expression changing as he said, “Mill! You made it!”
The first night of his semi-freedom, the dream changed. That night, Potter jumped down from Hagrid’s arms, alive and vibrant, and instead of the Dark Lord, Draco hugged
.” Draco snapped his wand at the litmus strips in turn. Two numbers materialised above them.
“Romantic, isn’t it?” Draco whispered.
Draco didn’t know. He would just rest for a moment…
“Muggle weddings often have themes,” said Harry. “Like ‘Winter Wonderland’ or ‘Under the Sea’, where the whole wedding is designed kind of like a fancy dress party, except the fancy dress is in the decorations.”
He was probably just being an idiot.
“You’re letting Akiko wear glonde,” the model says, pouting.
“That’s about the sum of it,” Cece, their guide, replied.
“You shall,” Harry sang. “Or else I’ll tell Hermione about the face you make when you—”
“That’s what Potter said,” added Draco, who was already bored with this conversation. “But I really think we ought to focus on actionable things. Any ideas from the Queen on how we can get Dudley back? Or connect with any of the Muggles who’ve come back from being abducted?”
“Yeah. It’s very—you. You were all happy for a while and it was so Terry Boot that it was nauseating.”
Millicent’s nose scrunched. “Was she adopted? Why aren’t they called Granger? And why
“The next Snitch is for Michael,” said Harry. “You’re a good friend,” he added. “I don’t know if there could be more, but I’d like to find out.”
“It’s so pretty,” said the mouthy fourth year girl. Harry could only nod.
folded under her arm. Harry still couldn’t make out the headline.
His day-to-day life was as
“Oh, that’s wonderful,” Hermione says. “Be sure to use a proper spell to get rid of all that lead paint. I worry about bringing Rose over. She’d probably eat the paint chips all over the floor.
“You’re right,” said Harry. He couldn’t help giving Draco a fond smile.
Four weeks and three hours later, Harry’s misconception is corrected.
When he came out an hour later, his room was dark, and Malfoy was gone.
except Malfoy’s become a good man, and I didn’t get a compliment.”
any of it.”
Eye’s narrowed, Malfoy tapped his wand on the frame one more time. Still Snape didn’t appear.
greater good? Could he hide his attraction long enough to learn from him?
“Explode,” Harry finished. “I know.”
“Squibs,” Granger interjected. “You’ll still have magical cores, just nothing filling them.”
“I was talking to Addolgar, Professor,” said Harry.
Malfoy did not seem at all drunk when he came over to sit next to Harry, but the redness of his eyes belied that.
Next to him, Malfoy chuckled. “I thought the same thing. You are so fucking hot when you come with something in your arse.”
“That makes it easy, then,” said Quincy. “I bet I could spell a sliver of demiguise hair into each of the eggs to turn them invisible. When they reproduced, about half would come out invisible, too. Maybe more, depending on how they bred. Then they’d take care of the rest themselves. I’m sure we don’t have to concern ourselves overmuch with inbreeding since oysters are born and die in the same place. There can’t be too much genetic variation there.”
He’s so annoyed by this that when she falls through a mineshaft sort of thing in a renegade goblin hide-out they’re scouting, he takes her to St Mungo’s instead of calling for a healing Auror to help them. Anytime they end up in St Mungo’s, there’s paperwork, and Harry gets some small degree of satisfaction from the scowl she sends him as he levitates a pile of Accident and Injury Report (AIR) forms onto her lap as she reclines in her hospital bed.
“You’re overthinking it,” said Harry, who was grateful Malfoy apparently hadn’t caught Harry’s Freudian slip. “It’s probably part of your animal’s temperament. Why don’t you meditate again here, and when you reach the visualisation stage, focus on the feelings of restlessness instead of pulling out of the meditation.”
Harry sighs quietly. He might as well run this by Ron since he’s here.
Malfoy slipped his arm around Harry then, pulled him in. Harry was surprised to find no one raised an eyebrow at it. And touching Malfoy like that...being able to be free with him and close to his body...just made all Harry’s worries go away. The second half started, and Dudley rushed back in the room, followed by the others. Chelsea scored in the first play and Ginny and Millicent screamed, high-fived.
the difference.
Kyle lived in Manhattan on the Upper East Side, but despite the ferocious traffic between JFK and there, their driver seemed to magically glide through all of it. They pulled into the underground garage ten minutes after leaving the airport. There was a lift up to the Malfoys’ penthouse flat. The whole way up, Libby stared at them, far too sullen for any four-year-old. Draco seemed to feel more at home with her than with Kyle, so Harry left them to their weird bonding.
“Yes!” said Ron.
“Well, we need to do something in the meantime… at least get it started. That water is practically uninhabitable,” Hermione said.
“That’s great, Harry. My boggart is myself without any friends, so as long as you don’t give me that, I’m sure it will be wonderful.”
The short witch didn’t sit back down. “Atlantis must resume the hiding spell or the British Ministry will take it as an act of war!”
That’s taking it a bit far, in Harry’s estimation. It’s on the tip of his tongue to say
Downstairs, Seabiscuit looked even less thrilled at getting packed away as he had the first time. Harry apologised with a few crumbles of bacon.
“Well,” said Hermione, bracingly. She put her hand to her stomach and leaned against the International Arrivals dais gate, her face more green than tan. They apparently didn’t stock courtesy Ill-Effects Bags for international Portkey travellers on this side of the Atlantic.
“Morning,” he said, passing Harry the food. Harry hadn’t realised how hungry he was until he bit into the toast. “The Minister’s going to call for you in about ten minutes, so eat fast.”
"Give me five minutes,” Harry said. He felt Draco nod against his head, and then nothing.
Groaning—or trying to—Harry peers over the desk, and finds himself staring at four irritable Embassy Aurors and Fievel’s weary face. She looks like she’s been running on hopes and Every Flavour Beans for about five days. He lifts his eyebrows in what he hopes is a friendly query and not a sarcastic-looking gesture. One of the Aurors narrows his eyes at it, and Harry points to his throat just to be safe. He’s got the look of a man who wants to fight and Harry suspects he’s the French yeller. Seeing the scar seems to appease him, which Harry refuses to think about.
Draco’s hands slid over his sides and held on. Harry jumped. Merlin, it felt like Fiendfyre was running through his veins all of the sudden. “Finish your potion.”
“Because he’s trying to dismantle the Wizengamot,” said Ron. “If you’d bothered to stick around and help out, you would’ve guessed that ages ago.”
, Harry says.
He hated that conclusion.
She sighed again. “And Mr Zabini, I see you skulking nonchalantly back there. Do stop. You’re safe.”
It had lasted twelve years too long.
Harry gaped.
could miss being attracted to other men?”
“Damn it,” said Harry. “That means I’m going to have to speak to that bastard little goblin again.”
“Sit then,” said Harry. He gestured for him to take the last floor cushion. “You can have Al’s play mat there; just Transfigure it however you like. Tea? Coffee? Three fingers of Old Lusty Centaur?”
“Teddy are you still having trouble with sevens?” Narcissa asked, brows furrowed.
With a roll of his eyes, Snape disappeared from the siren’s beach and she looked much relieved by it. Hermione waved to her, ever polite.
“The Our Lady of Lebanon monument in Harissa,” Fievel says then. Another pause. “The fuck you can’t! Those are my Aurors out there, and you will send in the goddamned
Snape huffed, as if being in Harry’s presence for too long was unbearable. Harry was quite sure it was, for him. “Yes.”
To his surprise, Demelza seems to get it. She sighs and stands, stretching her arms over her head and yawning. “I told Dawlish it was a bad idea to put two explosive Aurors together, but no one else was willing to work with you.
Malfoy was still looking at him oddly, and Harry took a breath as the weight of all his feelings he’d been avoiding thinking came crashing into him. He liked being around Malfoy. He liked working with Malfoy. He liked drinking brandy with Malfoy and saving the world with Malfoy, and he didn't want him to
“No,” Draco interrupted. Merlin, of course his father would jump to that first…though oddly, so had Potter. “Living Muggles. Volunteers.”
just to prove a point, Draco,” Padma said, sighing.
Harry observes.
Harry narrowed his eyes. Malfoy was just being a twat, which was nothing new. Why Harry supposed Malfoy might have changed was beyond him—or rather, Malfoy had changed, just not in a way that Harry wanted. What he wanted, he could admit in the abyssal corners of his mind, was Malfoy’s attention. And he was making a fool of himself trying to get it.
But he couldn’t say any of this, despite how significant it was, because the walls were paper thin and Michael Corner was just on the other side. He bit down hard on his wrist, breathing quickly through his nose as he watched Malfoy suck and finger-fuck him, his hips thrusting up of their own volition, and then it was just too much, the delicious feeling too much, and Harry’s back arched all the way off the bed as he emptied himself in Malfoy’s hot, waiting mouth.
“Sergeant, have you met my heir, Edward Lupin?” Draco inquired.
Harry chewed on his lip, thinking. “Is Miguela using the same one as Snape used?”
“Slowly?” asked Malfoy, slowing down, and Harry wanted to cry. God, every time Malfoy thrust into him, his prick rubbed perfectly over Harry’s prostate, and he was shivering and fevered with the need to come. It’d never felt this good, even with his favourite vibrating dildo. But it was just too slow. He writhed, aching for more contact, but Malfoy held tight to his hands and kept his movements restricted.
“Fuck! Fuck, don’t say it,” Harry yelped. He reached down and dug Hermione’s claws out of his thigh. “Shit.
“Sure, but imagine going through life as a Kyle. Be thankful your parents gave you a solid, British name, Potter. You could’ve been a Kyle. Or a Todd. Or a Jayden. Or a—”
And now he had it, had something with Potter, and it was good. But it was so different from his teenage fantasies. What would it have been like if Potter had noticed Draco then instead of now? What would it have been like if—
And then the world closes in. Truth, reality, and every potential thread of fate fall together. What does it matter if it’s real?
Draco’s folder’s there, locked now, but he’s seen it all at this point. He pushes it aside continues prowling through Fievel’s files, finding nothing. Then he sees the photograph, half-falling out of the brand new case file labeled ‘Our Lady of Lebanon’. Harry grabs the photograph and sucks in a breath at the photograph he finds inside it. He’s seen this monument before. It was on the Lebanon Wikipedia page.
They turn back to the cat—likely a kneazle—still staring at them from the window. Her eyes are clear and intelligent. She presses her nose against the glass. Unwillingly, Harry presses his hand back. He feels a thread, a shimmer of magic pass between them, the same magic Nigella gave him before he killed her to save himself, to save Draco.
“Fuck you,” says Malfoy. He calls out the name of his flat, steps into the Floo, and disappears.
Harry shook his head, looked down at
“I found traces of angel trumpet, hemlock, oleander, mercury, arsenic, antimony, lead, and thallium. However, I’d barely begun analysing it when I learned that the Dark Lord was searching for a sample of the very thing. I could not risk him discovering through
what you want.”
The portrait, previously still, seemed to tense even further. Slowly—very, very slowly—the portrait’s eyes moved down, down, down, until they settled on the corner of Mrs Black’s miniaturized frame that was peeking out of Harry’s jacket. The man’s eyes widened, and he glanced quickly around. The room had cleared of Muggles and they were alone.
The next step was Fermentation, a process that started with decay and putrefaction, and ended with rebirth of the spirit, quite literally in the case of wine, and thus the reason wizards called alcoholic drinks such. It was, according to Harry’s notes, a process both metaphorical and alchemical: first came death and decay; only after it could life renew. Harry rather thought he was a living example of Alchemy, as he’d done the very thing one night in the Forbidden Forest.
“Ag Griphook! U meggurt gukk frigoj a druv, Grig!” Teddy said, bowing so low his nose touched his knees. There was a lot more to it, with more repetitions of ‘frig’ every few words. Griphook smirked and said something to Teddy that made his eyes sparkle like stars.
“Are you the Brits?”
Damn it. How did one learn Potions without the Half-Blood Prince’s book? He was so buggered.
“A gukk friggikz uurzungek gja?” asked Draco, who had a much firmer grasp on languages, much to Harry’s infinite displeasure.
“Because our mums had us twelve years ago,” said Rosie, who always managed to sidle into rooms without anyone noticing her until she was ready.
“They aren’t...in our bodies?” Harry asked. “Like another organ?”
“I think time travel’s out, unfortch,” says Fields, gnawing on the inked end of his quill. He and Mitchell keep giving Draco and Hermione curious, delighted stares, like their a pair of Wolpertingers and not colleagues. “We been studying this one for months now—it’s a love that transcends time and space, y’know? If we pop back to last week, it’ll just pop back with us, pushing the origination point to wherever we go.”
No one had seen
Taking this stroll with Draco was… interesting. There were other people, sunlight, and fresh air, so it was nothing like the time he’d spent with Malfoy when he was teaching Potions at Hogwarts. But it still felt… nice. It felt the same, but nicer, Harry supposed.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Draco gesture oddly, whispering, “Holy Mother Ceridwen.”
In answer, Harry bent down again, and tugged on the laces of Draco’s trousers. They unravelled easily, and his cock sprang free. Harry immediately engulfed it in his mouth. Draco’s hips moved in the most obscene ways as he helped feed his cock to Harry. He moaned in sync with Harry’s every solid lick and his fingers grabbed rhythmically at Harry’s hair.
He did know that small, foot-long or thereabouts-length wands were relatively new to magic-working. Staves had been
“Then it’s a good thing I saw a bottle of it locked up in Uncle Sev’s personal supply room a few years ago.”
“Tomorrow,” said Draco. “We’ve scheduled a Muggle press conference on Atlantis. The Queen’s bringing in press from all over the world to cover it.”
“Kaylen,” Hermione said hesitantly.
He gasped. Acute sensory overload. Draco flicked his eyes up at the sound, and there was something in them, some look, that Harry couldn’t endure. It was drunk and confident and amused and triumphant and—
“I’ve no doubt you’ll leave it alive,” Draco said. “What use would it be to you dead?”
Harry had made it three weeks without Draco, without a battle chant.
path? This was entirely too poetic for his sensibilities.
The Chieftess gestured to some sea flora that resembled chairs. “Please sit. I will bring caviar and kelp.”
That was all Harry thought about the entire way home. He barely registered the heat from Draco’s dry leg pressed against his own in the back seat. They could’ve talked of that bastard Minister again, but they said nothing instead.
“That will do,” said Narcissa, nodding.
“Wanted to see the world,” he said. But then he smiled at Harry and Harry knew there was something else to it. He blinked, watching Malfoy closely. He didn’t laugh at Hermione’s bug even once.
Harry levitated it in, careful not to splash. It didn’t react to the aqua fortis at all, and after a moment, when all was still pacific, Harry reached for the Poison. “There’s about five ounces of the stuff,” he said. “I reckon we should save at least one ounce so we can reverse brew it. You know, in case we ever need it again.” Like in case they buggered up this stone, somehow.
“And the trash?” asked Chieftess Undine. “The fish swallow the
“You’re awake,” he said, his smile broken by a yawn.
“You said ‘we’…” Harry said.
At one hundred, he wordlessly (wandlessly) adjusted the heat, and just hung his head, letting Draco continue to devastate him, unable and unwilling to do anything about it.
Draco nodded. He looked up at the sky. It was getting dark, but…perhaps. “I know what to do.”
Harry looked up. Snape was regarding him soberly. “I will say this only once, and you will never repeat it to anyone.” Harry nodded. “I will give you this Poison for this experiment, not because of your whining, but because you have shown yourself to be an…excellent Potions student since embarking on this foolhardy journey. I have been surprised at your talent, and your restraint. Do not make me regret this. I do not wish to spend eternity in a frame with you. I have enough to deal with avoiding Dumbledore.”
And they were now, officially, criminals.
“Just one?” Ron asked. Harry was grateful he chose to ask about that instead of the fact that Harry had just used his name to try and score something that regular people couldn’t get. He still felt sort of sleazy about the matter, but Draco was bloody hard to shop for. “Who’d want to go to the World Cup alone?”
“Yes, thanks,” Draco said, a bit snidely. He couldn’t help he was a bit off, right now.
There is no snap. No surge of magic. No bond.
Harry hadn’t really been planning on it, but…maybe he should. Maybe Ginny would appreciate it. Maybe Malfoy would be going.
Proulx scoffs.
Dudley strolled in then, a bit sweaty from his sprint up to Hogwarts from his three-bedroom cottage in Hogsmeade. Why he needed three bedrooms in Hogsmeade as a single Muggle, Harry didn’t know. Why he sprinted from Hogsmeade to Hogwarts every morning during the school year, Harry also didn’t know. He suspected it had something to do with Millicent and wishful thinking.
Hermione nodded. “I know.”
“You coming with us to the ICW meeting?” Dudley continued.
Just when Harry thought he was finally getting Hermione’s pulse to slow down, his door snapped open again.
“I told you we’re all gay,” Draco muttered. Was it Harry’s imagination or did Draco look right at him when he said that?
Harry frowned. “Draco, can we—”
This had not happened in Gryffindor. There, it’d been every lion for itself, and Harry had most often been an outsider. They weren’t going to let him be an outsider here. He was welcome, whether he liked it or not. He didn’t know what to make of that.
“Shows what you know,” Harry replied before pressing in to kiss him again. His fingers tangled in Draco’s hair, and yes, it was just as soft as water, just like he’d suspected. It flowed through his fingers like a stream, cool and soft to the touch.
awake. What the fuck has been making him fall all over himself for Malfoy if he hasn’t got any allure?
“I love change,” she said. “Creating change, stopping change, watching change. It is such a beautiful, chaotic thing.”
he saw, how could he not have seen? It wasn’t like the desk was all that far from the door.
“It’s how I roll,” Harry said, shrugging. “And also, you know I’m stupidly in love with you, right? Like, it’s really bad.”
“Well, that’s definitely accidental magic,” Ron said, taking another Chocolate Frog. He was more inclined to eat with them at the Hufflepuff table now that there was a constant supply of chocolate to hand at every meal (and in between them). “Merlin, there’s been a lot of breaks of the Statute recently. Why aren’t the Obliviators doing anything?”
, it said in golden thread. And right next to it, like another leaf sprouting from the same branch:
Harry snorts. “Good luck getting that approved. Those things have been floating untouched in that tank since they cleaned up after us. I imagine Apex won’t be amused by you wanting to mess with them.”
“We’ve an emergency staff meeting,” Minerva told him. “Fifteen minutes. Can you hear yet?”
“You did not!” Harry said, laughing.
“He’s not, in fact, accepting an Auror position in France, though,” says Harry. “Nor in Quebec. Do they speak French anywhere else?”
“I’m good at Quidditch.”
Hannah slumped against his shoulder. Apparently slumping in Neville’s direction was too much effort. “We wait,” she sighed.
“But we have wands. And wands can amplify magic by up to 10,000 joules—logarithmic!”
of them could have drowned. As witches and wizards, they took for granted that magic could save them… and this time, if they’d been alone when that happened, they would have died.
But he did take her suggestion and left early for Hogsmeade in order to post it. He couldn’t bring himself to go up to the owlery just yet. Hedwig’s death ached sometimes and seeing her old roost would put a damper on his day. Today was not a day for that. It was a day for Malfoy. And Quidditch.
Potter and ex-Potter followed suit, though Ginny performed a lovely, deep curtsey that Draco would not have expected a Weasley to be able to execute. They began to file out, some faster than others.
“I’ll do my best, Mr Potter. Merry Christmas.”
“The transformation?” asked Harry.
, let that happen. In desperation, he reaches into the flames, and his fingers close around the soft linen of Malfoy’s shirt. They both pause, startled. He hadn’t even realised that was possible to do in international calls.
This would be their first
, and…Draco was free.
wanted you. I think you want me, too.”
Harry fought not to drag him in and kiss him for all he was worth. He swallowed, his throat heavy and thick. “Goodnight, Draco.”
“There you are, Malfoy,” she said. “I’ve finished analysing your mineral transfigurations and I have some comments for you. Shall we discuss it now? I’ve an engagement this evening.”
“I’ll bloody well tell him myself if this kills me,” Harry growled, even as he was shaking his right hand to wandlessly banish the glove to the table.
This communication without words thing is really, really hard.
Malfoy frowned. Harry could see his mind working and knew neither of them were going to like it when he spoke again. Finally, Malfoy looked up, his sharp eyes meeting Harry’s directly.
“Good idea,” Hermione said, writing that down on a napkin. “And then there’s televisions, too, of course. I imagine loads of men would like to actually watch the professional Quidditch matches instead of listening to them on the wireless… Ooh! And computers and the internet—”
Eloise Midgen took up at the piano in the corner and sang all sorts of bawdy songs in a lovely contralto voice. She had tightly curled auburn hair and the pretty translucent-brown, freckled skin that sometimes showed up in mixed children. She looked a lot like Hermione now that her skin had cleared, and he wondered if they were friends at all, if they’d ever chatted about the opera, of which Hermione was a fan, or what it was like to come from multiple cultures and be thrust into yet another.
. He could not lose him
“Previous partners?” Harry interrupts, heart hammering. “Who—?”
Finally, there was nothing else Harry could do. He stood up and waded back to shore. Seabiscuit’s tank looked so lonely here. He couldn’t just take it back with him. So he decided to deconstruct it to its base elements and return it to the earth, as he had with the rubbish in the Bay. It was the work of only a few moments, and then there was nothing left to take back.
“No,” said Potter. “Not nearly enough.”
It doesn’t matter if it’s true or not. It’s reality. Harry nods, then tugs Draco’s hand, pulling him away from the shop, the cat, and the aching pull of Hedwig’s magic.
“Harry!” Padma said, before Harry could begin to feel guilty about the systemic immorality of the Ministry, and how they apparently never trusted Draco unless Harry was there to supervise him. Padma embraced him briefly and then stepped back, hands on his shoulders while she scanned his face.
“Oh my god,” said Ginny, cackling. “You carry around Snape’s portrait!”
Harry nodded as if this made loads of sense to him when in fact it didn't. “I thought I’d be free, after the war,” he said, mostly to fill the empty space. “I thought I’d be done with all the bad stuff, and I’d marry Ginny Weasley and we'd have a bunch of precocious kids and I’d be an Auror and she’d play for the Harpies and it would be
“What are you doing?” Harry asked, voice strangled. Malfoy ignored him, and Harry, try as he might, could not look away as each successive button revealed another couple of inches of recently tanned skin. Malfoy shucked off his shirt and stepped up to Harry. His hands came to rest on Harry’s hipbones and Harry tried to convince his mind to jerk away, but it wouldn’t listen. When Malfoy’s fingers curled over his skin, he moaned and stepped up to his body.
“Harry,” Draco whispers, fingernails digging into Harry’s back. His mouth moves away from Harry’s own and drags kisses along his jaw, trailing down the pink scar that runs down and across his neck. “So glad you’re alive.”
“You horrendous cretin!” Draco said.
Things did not always work out the way one expected, but if the intent was there, they would always find a way to work out eventually. Sometimes, he even thought that messed up Obliviation was good for all of them. Struggle did bring people together. And it seemed they would have seven of those to prove it to themselves. The only thing that could’ve made it better was if Teddy could count them. But he had his calculator. It was fine.
, claws sunk desperately into the pages to keep hold.
He sorted through the stack of papers on his bedside table, and finally unearthed the notes he’d taken after leaving the lab. There was something he’d overlooked all along, something he felt ridiculously stupid for not remembering. He’d held a Philosopher’s Stone in his hand, once.
“Hey,” he said. He was confused by the raw sound of his voice. Maybe he was just confused by his voice, full stop. He couldn’t remember speaking a word since Boxing Day. He reached out to take Draco’s hand in his, which was trembling for some reason. Harry had no idea what to say to him, so he squeezed his hand and turned back to the window. It was something after ten now; the new year was only hours away.
how to get Dudley back. I don’t think we
Lee shrugged. “You know the press don’t reveal their sources.”
Harry’s mind went in a number of interesting directions at this.
are too close to Unspeakable Granger to focus,” Apex adds.
Then purplehybrids said that since their mind had been released from its spell, they could see the future sometimes, and Harry sighed, disappointed. Just another crackpot, trying to become internet famous.
“What?” Harry said, turning to stare at her. Malfoy’s words from the weekend came back to him in a rush. He suddenly remembered the way Malfoy had looked in black and gold, how he wore it rather well.
, Harry says.
“I’m done with being an Auror,” Harry continues. Draco’s face is so pale. There’s a gash on the side of his head where part of the retaining wall hit him when it exploded. Harry can’t think anything but ‘what if he doesn’t wake up?’
“It’s been two months, mate,” Ron said.
That Harry could do.
“How can it?”
“What is that?! What is that?!” she kept yelling, her finger waving towards the unconscious being on her floor.
Potter rubbed his jaw. He looked dangerously close to comforting Millicent, which was more than Draco could’ve done if she’d just punched him. Thankfully, she hadn’t. They could still figure this thing out. They just needed to get this alien back to the castle before it could escape, put a kettle on, and think this through.
“That’s our best guess,” Jones confirmed. “They won’t talk to any of our ambassadors, though. We aren’t one hundred percent sure. Maybe speaking Mermish will help,” she added, nodding to Hermione.
,” Potter insisted, turning to face them both. “Look at them, they’re an advanced civilisation, they wear clothes and communicate and fly through the universe. They’re not humans, but they

clipping advertising the new position of Professor of Ancient Cultures and Casting.
“Come in, come in,” Mrs Weasley said then, bustling Draco off to the table. “You’re entirely too thin, Draco. We were just finishing lunch. Have a mince pie. Or do you rather yorkshire pudding? There’s leftovers from last night.”
him. Miles had set his camera aside and was now performing a gentle Summoning charm on Hermione. She resisted for a moment, but then leaned up to give Harry a peck on the cheek before walking off to join the other wizards, head high.
Though, it wasn’t as if anyone with the Mark just said, ‘No thanks, m’Lord, it’s just not for me.’ Draco knew that well enough. But he also knew his father was a gambling man, and had bet on the wrong Abraxan that go ‘round.
“Afraid so.”
“I know,” Draco agreed, and his fingers began plucking at the top button of Harry’s shirt, sending tingles all down his torso. “I don’t give those, anyway.”
“Only one to a table. I’ll come around with a hat, from which you will draw a piece of parchment. Upon the parchment you will find the name of the potion you are to brew. After you have brewed your potion, decant two ounces for analysis, then continue through the door at the back of the room to the written examination where you will receive further instructions.”
The bedclothes were a disaster. A faint imprint where Dudley had been lying was still evident. Across the way, the telly was showing a dark-skinned detective, the show’s dark atmosphere very much something Severus would’ve preferred all his paintings to be in.
He hadn’t heard from Snape in a while and found himself really wishing the man was here tonight. The clock showed half past one. Harry grimaced, knowing he was still going to have to be up early to take Albus, who’d be overly excited by the prospect of trick-or-treating in Hogsmeade and then to his Gran’s for the annual Weasley Halloween dinner, and
Potter said, “So there are many versions of the same person in Atlantis?”
She nodded. “Of course.”
“It’s too much for me to bear. I reach up and finally, finally, touch him. His skin is hot. His nipples tight and responsive beneath my hands. He lets his head fall backwards and the pose is so excruciatingly erotic that my fingers clench around his waist and hold him there as I shift my hips up again, move them against him like the water. He begins to move with me. He leans forward, holding himself on his hands, and bends his head to kiss me fiercely. I make a wretched, needy sound, and surge up to meet it. I have never been kissed like this before—like he has a thousand options, but thinks I’m the prize he has to fight for.
Millicent scrunched her eyes closed. “Go to the press. I’d better see you on a Muggle telly by the end of the day. Then we’ll work on getting you home. And—Dudley, don’t go to sleep alone. Stay at a…at a hostel or something. With lots of people around. We’ll send you money.”
“I do agree with Mr Dursley’s assessment of the situation,” Granger spoke up. She’d had her hair straightened today and it hung in a sleek fall around her face, accentuating her high cheekbones. “My parents are Muggles with public-facing careers that allow them to do a lot of small talk with their clients. They’ve told me that while almost everyone was talking about it yesterday, no one, so far, suspects anything more than natural phenomena.”
that much from anyone without affecting their sanity. My hope is it just doesn’t work at all.”
Griphook gestured to three chairs before his desk, the one in the middle just a little higher so that Teddy could see over it. “Please, have a seat. Furleezja tells me that you must speak to me about the Patil-Nott financial review ceremony. Is there a problem?”
“Welcome to Hufflepuff, brother,” he said.
“I’m trying,” he says, knowing it’s not nearly enough. “Fuck if I know what to do though. I don’t work with manufactured love. That’s Mitchell’s spec.”
Draco pounced on him, kissing him full on the mouth right there in the lobby of the Mermaid & Clam. “Stop it. I mean you’re a cocksucker because I was considering asking you to move in with me, but I probably would’ve deliberated over it for another six to eight months, but here you are, jumping right in.”
So they lugged out all thirty crates to the front garden, and started stacking them in as Padma and Blaise got out of the car. Blaise was in a Juventus jersey today, though it was still a well-tailored Juventus jersey.
Harry swallows, feeling hunted. “Erm, yes. It.”
Teddy beamed. “He’s the one who recommended Mr Durjtak for my Gobbledegook lessons. They’re related.”
“Well, yes.” Draco was unruffled. “It worked for Atlantis, but now we need to hide all the magical communities, not just them.”
“You know what I meant,” said Harry, staring angrily at his own green inkwell. “I don’t want to only be good for dark lord defeating and printing gossipy stories about.”
“Yes, thank you, your Majesty, but you said the extraterrestrials are also similar to us—that we’re made from their DNA.”
But she, it turned out, didn’t know either. She gave an elegant shrug, one sun-darkened shoulder lifting, the burgundy fabric tied over it sliding against her skin. “My mother was the Seer, not me. I only know what she told me—that it would take the cooperation of all the people on this earth to free us from the Creators.”
. “Yes.”
“Not at all,” said Harry. “Won’t know for sure until results come in July, but Snape seemed confident, and, well, it’s Snape.”
? “You don’t think so?”
. Draco used to play
Draco stared at him. “Oh.”
“But Snape likes you,” Harry said. “And I’m pretty sure he sort of likes me now, too, since he’s been calling me ‘moron’ instead of ‘Potter’ a lot lately. You think he’d let us in?”
“Milly!”
“Should be at Trafalgar Square,” said Millicent. “He was finalising some last minute press passes.”
Kreacher eyes him for a moment, then disappears.
Zeph nodded. Quickly, Harry moved them along to the next sculpture, which was Titus’. He’d recreated a startlingly accurate and sturdy rendition of the London Eye. “I love London,” he said. “It’s the best city in the world. I’d never leave.”
Harry blinked several times. “What?”
to pass the time.
still be alive. It was hard to be the better Potions Master when one was dead, Harry suspected, and he was damned if he’d let Snape make him feel inferior when he was rotting.
Zacharias Smith’s mother worked for the Ministry, and had been able to secure a number of unregistered port-keys for them. Harry had no idea how she’d done that, but a Hufflepuff soon learned that often the best way to maintain one’s loyalty was to not ask questions whose answers would be better left outside one’s own head, if one were to be questioned.
She nodded, eyes wide, as she took the flowers from Draco. He did a series of four more transfigurations—some of them even more complex for lack of apparent similarity. Each apple became a cast iron frying pan, a working pocket-watch, a plush dog, and a snail.
Down and down they went. Draco seemed to have forgotten the existence of No Spill Spells; either that or he’d wanted the excuse to focus on his wine glass and say nothing as he let Harry draw shapes on his back all the way down to the lower vaults. They slowed and Harry quickly readjusted himself.
A knock on the door made all of them jump, even Luna, who was never rattled.
“I’m here for Theo,” Draco replied.
Hermione huffed. “The mirror, you twit.” It was reflecting the blue light from the wardrobe, making the whole room light up in a soft, eerie glow.
McGonagall paled, stared at them, and then waved them into chairs, which were red tartan.
“Can I stay at yours?” asked Potter, as if it weren’t a foregone conclusion by now that they’d sleep together.
. Let’s all give ourselves a pat on the back for a job well done. Congratulations to this task force for solving the problem of Atlantis!”
“Maybe a bit more in the bum?”
Out of Draco’s line of vision, Lee was turning red trying not to laugh. And just beyond him, Narcissa looked on with barely disguised amusement while Blaise didn’t bother pulling himself away from today’s Juventus game on the kitchen telly. Malfoy’s crew was certainly making themselves at home in Harry’s Airbnb.
“Suck up,” Harry muttered.
“Disgusting,” Blaise said. Harry had to agree.
“Do you think they’d work on stone?”
“Aliens, yeah?” said the barista. He shook his head. “Still can’t believe it. Sure, I’ll change it over for you.”
Harry frowned, remembering the distant looks Draco sent him on Sundays when Vic announced the standings and Harry was in first again. There was none of that spark left when he looked at Harry; it was like he was…dead. Inferi.
“Aunt Petunia,” Harry said, clearing his throat.
Harry took the little green paper-wrapped package from him, and was surprised by the weight of it. Shrunken, then. Only when Draco picked up the parchment envelope with his name on it, did Harry begin to peel back the paper. Inside, was a little wooden box. He flipped the lid on it and peered inside. There was a tiny cauldron, no bigger than the palm of his hand.
Harry nodded miserably. “I have no idea how we’re going to coordinate that, or even get the word out. And we can’t go on telly again—the ICW is out for our blood and they’ll find us.”
“Mr Potter,” McGonagall said. “I can appreciate a fine cat as well as the next witch, but if you don’t mind, we do have a meeting to attend to. Perhaps we could save the pet-related discourse for lunch.”
trapped in a forced love bond with a
“Go fuck yourself, Malfoy,” Hermione says primly as she walks past him into the circular antechamber separating their sub-departments.
Malfoy pursed his lips, looking away. “I don’t know.” He swallowed. “But can anyone else do for you what I just did?”
Draco snorted.
It didn’t take long. It seemed to Harry that both their bodies tensed further then.
If, that was, they could find enough volunteers.
: (n) a fear of feeling pleasure, likely because you’re a fucking miserable cunt.]
Draco hesitated. He turned his head, focusing on the china cabinet full of taxidermied fairies that Harry kept meaning to toss. “I don’t know. I need time to think.”
Harry flushes, and quickly stows the magazine away before Dawlish can see the other headlines, especially the one about Draco...or the one about how to be better at oral sex. He skimmed that one, but no one has to know. He’s just curious about the mechanics is all. He’s always been pretty impressed by the women who did it to him, imagining how they fit entire dicks into their mouths, wondering if they liked doing it.
“Just…stay inside,” Malfoy said, taking his mother’s hands.
Slughorn called: “I’ll have a decanted sample on my desk before you leave, then a twelve inch essay on the process due a week from today. And don’t forget that you’re all invited to my little party this Saturday evening. Eight pm, come dressed for success and fun!”
Harry deflates, swallows. It suddenly feels hard to breathe and he doesn’t know if it’s anxiety, sudden-onset asthma, or if it actually is possible to die of a broken heart. He’s read
one of them to follow.
Harry laughed. “God, you are such a twat, Malfoy.”
Harry nodded absently, still feeling somewhat dazed that his separation spell had worked on a cauldron full of
“Dislike,” she says, her voice quite small indeed. “Perhaps something… even stronger. But there had to be a certain camaraderie there, too. A certain… I don’t know, Harry. It’s so hard to explain. In essence, we had to both hate and like each other. Which feels… very awful. I didn’t realize I still disliked Malfoy after working with him all these years. Not really. I thought he just
Malfoy looked back but didn’t stop. He was wearing his reading glasses. Why Harry never noticed whenever he wore them before, he couldn’t say, because they were rather fetching.
“Fine,” says Hermione. “Why?”
?” Harry lifted his eyebrows, sipped his ale.
Malfoy was developing a lovely tan, Harry thought as he approached. He couldn’t see what his structure was yet, but he could see a lovely view of his bum as he bent over it, applying the finishing touches.
“Then we need to
Draco looked over at him, eyes sparkling with humour, and—and maybe something else, too. Harry tried to look closer, but it was gone before he could identify it. “Potter, you silly bugger.”
Potter shuddered when she cast the spell over him, too, and pulled at his left ear several times. He caught Draco looking and gave him a dour glare in response, still wiggling at his ear. Draco rolled his eyes and turned back to the proceedings.
“But it looked just like yours.”
Harry’s gut was still screaming ‘instinct, instinct!’
Despite the hour, they didn’t have to wait on the Headmistress to come down from her rooms. McGonagall was awake and at her desk when they reached the top of the stairs. She looked at them over the top of her square glasses, frowning.
“You think she’ll talk about Dudley?” asked Millicent. “Do Muggle news shows take callers? Maybe someone will Floo in and tell her how to get him home!”
“I’m such a cunt,” Harry mutters, running a hand through his hair.
“When I was younger, a spell was cast on me—“
“You’re attracted to me, too. I know you are. You
that came out three months ago.
Harry was one of the last to be approached, which wasn’t unusual – he was terrible at making friends – but eventually even the first years came up and introduced themselves to him. The numbers in Hufflepuff were roughly the same as in Gryffindor, but having all of these people here at once, passing him around as they all shook hands and smiled and said things like ‘Anything you need, anything at all’... well, it was as a weird experience, to say the least.
“I do okay at defeating things,” Harry said.
This surprised Malfoy. He looked quickly back at Harry. “You’re more observant than the average Gryffindor. Maybe you were sorted wrong to begin with.” He turned back to the pitch, lifting his binoculars again and completely missing Harry’s frozen reaction. “You know, there’s a reason that so many Hufflepuffs went to Slytherin, and a fair number of us came here.”
“On the other hand, there was never enough evidence for me to truly believe aliens—should they exist—would have bothered to come here, or that they would have the technology to overcome such a great distance. You know, it takes a single particle of light, a photon, eight minutes and twenty seconds to travel from the Sun to Earth. We’re 92.96 million miles from the Sun. By comparison, the Earth is 4.24 light years away from the next closest star, Proxima Centauri. And no one has yet discovered a method of traveling as fast as light, not even with Apparition. So it seems quite insurmountable as a distance.”
“Oh, shut the fuck up, Malfoy,” Harry said softly. He smiled, to show he didn’t mean it. And that he desperately wanted this conversation to be over. “Look—just don’t worry about this. Let’s go back and do something productive with the rest of the night. I found a manuscript on early Alchemy that I think you’ll be interested in. It suppositions that transfigurations was the final step in creating a stone.”
Draco grinned, all sexy teeth and crinkly eyes. Harry died, perhaps, then struggled to maintain his best we’re-just-mates-and-I-only-love-you-like-a-bro face. “I know, moron. This time last year, you didn’t give a toss about Potions. It’s…”
If surviving two Killing Curses, weathering a stillbirth, getting divorced, accidentally getting his ex-wife pregnant, and raising the subsequent child to seven hadn’t done it, then a continent would.
Harry sipped his wine. He was starting to feel rather warm, with or without the winter cloak. “Oh? You seem remarkably invested in my wellbeing.”
Great.
“Being Mum One must’ve gone to her head,” Malfoy observed.
“Not fine,” Harry admitted then, grinning a little. “Bloody terrified, to be honest.”
Their call did not look pleasant. Lee barely got in a word. When he rang off, he looked worried. “I have to go back downtown. She wants me there immediately to help rein in the story.” He hesitated for a moment before adding, “The way she explained it… I don’t think it
When Malfoy returns, he looks much more composed. Harry wishes he could say he felt the same. Harry has no idea what’s wrong with him, but there’s this strange, suffocating piece of panic lodged somewhere in his chest and it chokes him whenever he thinks about the fact that Malfoy’s got a Portkey set for 6.55 tomorrow morning.
“Is this…?”
“Morning, Malfoy, Mrs Malfoy.”
“But that’s our land,” Malfoy said, gesturing out to the wheat field below. “That’s our tenant farmer and our wheat field and there are
It’s not his usual thing, but he’s been fully cocked for five hours and he’s afraid his bollocks might fall off if he doesn’t empty them. So he does—in great quantity, on his kitchen table, just inside the door to his flat.
Harry thought at him.
Harry turned his broom to the north, and flew to Hermione. Miles and Javier trailed him, no judgment, no commentary, just silently recording his choice. He was almost to the end of the bridge, close enough that the fog was breaking enough that he could see Hermione standing down there. She looked up at him, and for a moment, her face fell, before she schooled it into a welcoming expression. Harry stopped, hovering in the air, his eyes locked on his best friend. His best friend who, while she hadn’t turned down a free holiday, had no real need for any prize money. Her daughter was well loved, well cared for. Rosie had plenty of family, plenty of toys, plenty of milk, and two parents and a godfather who thought the Sun revolved around her.
“Which is perfectly reasonable,” Draco said.
“I think he was calling me bro this time,” Harry said.
He frowned.
He knew, logically, that not all of the Slytherins had been in favour of Voldemort’s victory, but some had. And he was pretty sure that at least a couple of them had returned for their seventh and eighth years. Frankly, Harry was surprised so many had. It was as if they’d filled up their rosters out of pride and determination more than any real desire to be here.
Harry considered not touching the Portkey, letting it activate without him there. He’d miss his connection to Sydney and then maybe he could go home and just…Nope. Magical binding contract.
The Fudge case is solved and Ron has the time to fully submerged himself in a new episode, focused, uncomfortably, on winning his wife back through sheer force of will.
Hermione slides down the wall behind her, face in her hands, but she doesn’t say no. She doesn’t call it off. Doesn’t say anything at all. Really, they both should’ve been Slytherins from the beginning.
Ron shakes his head, still grinning.
,” Hermione said. She pursed her lips, cast a privacy spell over their table. “The Ministry tied my hands—technically, since I’ve remained on call for the Department of Mysteries, they can reactivate my contract for ‘emergency situations’ and they
, it was an unmitigated disaster.”
“She only hated you because I got into dangerous situations because of you,” Draco says. “And Mummy knows it’s not for her to judge anyone else’s personal relationships, even mine. Everyone’s relationships are strange if you look deep enough. She married my father, after all.”
Draco sits straight up and stares down at Harry with wide eyes. “I thought you meant you’d just never bottomed before.”
Just then, Lee’s mobile began to buzz. He pulled it out and frowned at the screen. “It’s Kennedy Jones,” he said to them, before sliding his thumb across to answer.
“What do we do?” asked Harry. “How are we going clean all those landfills if we can’t use magic on them?”
There was an awkward silence. Predictably, one of the Ministry idiots broke it. “Doubtful. They died or disappeared about a thousand years ago.”
“In the kitchen, Cissy!” Andromeda replied. Draco gave her a pointed look, and she nodded, though she looked rather exasperated.
Dudley, Petunia, Piers, and the Grangers appeared around the privacy screen. Dudley’s relief was almost tangible.
His heart fluttered oddly.
Draco’s hair was mussed. It looked far too fetching to be fair. His nose scrunched as he tried to fight off a yawn, and lost. “Morning,” he said, just as quietly. “I had a nightmare that the Cannons won the league.”
“What do you mean by that?” Harry asks, sitting up straight. He drops his wand to his lap, forgotten.
He didn’t get the chance to finish, as Hermione, exhaling in a very bracing manner, approached. “Your turn, Ron,” she said. Her words were polite, too, but there was an undercurrent to them. A strain that Harry hated.
And it had attracted Severus, who was like a fly to rotten misery.
He wrinkled his nose. “Never had to find ways to take up space with Ron before.”
“Want it?” Harry asks, running his nose along the shaft.
“I hope he’s going to be okay,” Harry said to Draco, who was back on the grass, somehow inspecting his nails through his leather gloves.
always came looking for
For the first time all night, Malfoy seemed truly happy. He laughed genuinely, a little maniacally; Harry could easily imagine him rubbing his hands together in anticipation. “My dear cousins could host us until we were settled,” he said, grinning widely.
This was why he’d stopped visiting Draco in his office to begin with. Seeing someone you loved but couldn’t have was the worst kind of torture.
“What secret are you going to keep from me?” asked Draco.
Draco grimaced. “And?”
Harry wore his new cloak on the night of Halloween. They were all stuffed and happy from the feast. Their spirits were high and their pockets were full of Honeydukes. Where the other houses had an array of sweets to choose from, the Hufflepuff table had been loaded down with all kinds of chocolates. Harry had looked up to the head table as he finished dinner and found Professor Sprout looking down at them all, her eyes soft with the worry a mother might feel watching children go off into the world. There was more to it than that, but she was good enough not to let on.
if his love is real… or to not have him at all?
After a long moment, Draco looked at him. “Notice the blocks that are out of place. Read the clues for those squares.”
Harry stands up, desperate for a fellow English speaker. He looks around, then holds the blank side of his list up and projects the words onto the paper,
“And me, too,” said Luna.
,” she said. “Not something that makes me want to pull my hair out.”
“I know you understand human languages, you cocksucker,” Millicent growled. “Where did your friend take him?”
Harry did.
Brunch progressed in typical fashion. Draco enjoyed being with his family. His parents had always been demonstrative with him, and they were the same with Scorpius, if not more so. Having come as close as Malfoys ever did to rock-bottom had shaken them loose a bit. They’d found Astoria too modern at first, but forced isolation from the rest of the world made strange bedfellows and it had not taken long for them to warm to her.
Malfoy changed his and Millicent’s features and clothes, and they’d popped into town for some dinner and to see what they could make of the townspeople. How they were acting, what they were thinking.
Magic swam around them. Hogwarts was hidden in a mist of swirling lights... surely the students and staff could see this from their windows? Surely everyone was watching this light show, wondering what was causing it? Professor Sprout would know; she would watch from her warm rooms in the dungeons and know because many years ago, she’d done magic with her own cohort of Hufflepuffs. Not magic to this extent, surely, but she would know it nonetheless.
He gapes at her.
“Flight paths do cross that area of the Atlantic, as I said last time we met,” Hermione growled. “And the Parrot AR Drone, a smartphone-controlled quadcopter for consumers, was released this year. Muggles can now send remote-operated cameras wherever they want to take photographs for them. I’m sure someone with enough money to blow on toys has already purchased and piloted one out there. Has anyone bothered to check with their Muggle Liaisons on this? Not to mention,
Harry and Draco stayed in Hogsmeade long after the others had gone back to the school, excited to begin their research for this new ritual. Harry was less excited, and Draco even less so. In truth, they were both conflicted by it all, and the hours they spent walking around Hogsmeade were spent mostly quietly, as they thought through the afternoon’s developments.
“It’s Rosie’s DNA, actually,” she said. “Luna said we couldn’t do a person. She didn’t say we couldn’t do their DNA sequence.”
“It really is! Very nice!” came chorus of replies, and breakfast resumed. Next to him, Harry felt Lavender deflate in relief, which was great and all, but it still remained one of the most uncomfortable meals of his entire life. And he’d had to eat Hermione’s camp cooking for nine months.
: Acceptable
Another little swish from the anemones and Harry groaned. He was hard, which was embarrassing but not unusual. He felt another touched his shoulder and let his head fall to the side to make room, but instead of a soft ghostly touch of a sea anemone getting a bit fresh, he felt the unmistakable slide of Draco’s tongue along the place where his shoulder and neck met.
“Healer Thomas says you’re staying the night for observation, so get comfy.” Demelza pauses again, making a show of collecting up his AIR, seemingly uninterested in saying whatever else was on her mind. Gryffindor, though, so she huffs and finally adds: “Dawlish said to tell you he’ll be by at five. I’ll see you, Harry. I’m going home.”
“Hey, Harry! Hey, Al!” he said, dumping piles of papers on Harry’s sitting room table. This was followed by a couple of notebooks and a pack of mechanical pencils.
Draco nods, lips pursed tightly. Draco’s hand slides into his and the feel of Draco’s palm against his own requires of Harry a deep breath and closing his eyes to keep from exploding in a mess of useless magic, but he holds it together. They step through the threshold together and… nothing.
“Ronald!” Mrs Weasley said.
Al leaned in, as if sharing a huge secret, and said, “I’m going to be a Demiguise like Ms Danger! Luna made me a doggo costume and Mum nicked your Invisible Cloak from your room, but don’t tell her I told on her.”
A slow smirk spreads across Malfoy’s face. He struts back over to the bed and crawls up on it, pushing Harry back down with a palm on his chest. He looms over Harry, that beastly little smirk still playing about his lips.
Potter followed his gaze and nodded. “Right—I dunno how close I want to be to the alien, to be honest, but I think I’d rather that than up here, all exposed to the sky.”
“Harry, you cocksucker,” Draco finally said.
“Other things appear by magic,” she said. “Why not patience?”
Millicent added milk to her tea and twirled the spoon around without clinking the porcelain. Where did Slytherin come up with these posh types? You’d never even think it to look at her. Harry supposed it didn’t matter what kind of trousers Millicent wore, she’d never be able to hide how she crossed her ankles, just like Ron would never be able to hide that he was a milk-in-first sort of bloke.
As if summoned by Harry’s thoughts, Draco Apparated into the clearing. The ground was wet and squelchy, but there was no sign of rain in the forecast that night, for which Harry was grateful. He did not relish a cold November night outside in the weather they’d been having of late.
Apex looks up sharply, just a quick movement of her hood. “You have research.”
would make those potions. It’s not like I had Mer potions on my OWL-level curriculum.”
“I didn’t tell her a anything. I showed her the Pensieve memory from the Minister’s visit.”
Scorpius cleared his throat.
“They’re fine,” she said, but she wasn’t talking to Draco. “They’re all fine. Even Kilgore.”
Hermione’s eyes were wide. “Oh, my god,” she said. “Harry.”
“In the meantime,” said Hermione, “we should talk about that New Year’s Eve party we landed with Fortescue’s.”
She nodded. “It was sleep paralysis—a Muggle term—but no one knows what causes it and it just felt so…so…unnatural. I asked my parents about it, but they didn’t remember anything from school that I didn’t find on the internet, and they’ve never experienced it themselves.”
“Well, what the hell do you two expect me to
Harry turned the knob on his lab door and jiggled it open before turning to look back at Malfoy. He was staring at the walls as if he could almost remember what they looked like before. He turned back to Harry and raised his eyebrows.
Blood was tricky that way—it didn’t like to ‘let go’ of its creator body. It would keep holding on, magically, long after it’d been pulled from the veins. And that hold could drag a wizard down, make him feel like he was walking through a swamp for weeks, months, or even years afterwards the ‘sacrifice’ wore off.
Draco nodded. “Elias’ daughter Celestria married into the Blacks, incidentally starting the tradition of naming Black children after astronomical bodies. I came across Elias’ portrait after Father died and I came into my full inheritance. When I saw it, I knew something was special about it, but I couldn’t put my wand on it until a few years later. When Teddy turned five, the resemblance really started to show, and I knew he was meant to be my heir.”
Malfoy cocked his head. “You don’t want to go back, do you?”
“Split them up—” says Harry.
Harry says, when her writing has continued on long enough for his patience. She doesn’t look up so he forces the words to blink.
. Merlin.
“He’s awfully protective,” Harry observed, casually. He turned to find his Harpies t-shirt, forcing himself not to look over-interested.
Harry closed his eyes, felt warm and protected, even when another tug yanked at his core. “No!” Draco said. “I’m not letting your magic leave you, as long as you believe me, Harry. You’ve got to
“All of it,” she said, with a wry grin. He supposed he should’ve guessed that. He gave her a tentative smile back and she added, “Arithmancy, I suppose. You can do so many brilliant things with it. Spell creation, curse breaking, ward setting…amazing, unlimited magic.”
“Harry Potter, one of two Muggle Immersion Professors at Hogwarts in Scotland,” and sat right back down.
“Are you quite sure it works, Mr Peterson?” Hermione asked, smiling in that way that Harry knew indicated a bloodbath was soon to follow.
“To my hotel room, obviously.” He takes a few steps, looks back over his shoulder with that damned eyebrow cocked. “Are you coming or not? Do I have to model your clothing to get you interested in taking it off me?” As if Harry needs the temptation, Malfoy opens his over-cloak and shows Harry what’s underneath. White waistcoat, silver buttons. White trousers hanging on by a prayer. It’s the suit Harry’s designed for him to model—he must have sneaked it out after the show.
“It is always a disaster at the Ministry,” said Lucius. “I doubt something as small as a worldwide catastrophe could make it worse.”
Harry was gaping at him. He’d already forgotten most of the details, but hearing Malfoy offer so much about himself without prompting was staggering. Was this a Hufflepuff thing?
“I could’ve got a message to the Queen tomorrow!” Snape said. “I do visit the castle at least every other day. You didn’t have to tether me further to this fucking castle.”
Potter gaped. “Piers Polkiss,” he repeated, dubious.
Harry smirked. Hermione put her head in her hands and groaned.
Their shoulders brushed as Harry stepped through, and he suppressed a shiver as best he could. It was like Draco’s skin was made of the same quartz, piezoelectric and attuned specifically to Harry. The Botticelli shut behind them, and Harry headed for his settee, but a hand on his shoulder jerked him to a stop.
“I’m really good at these Muggle games,” Draco says as he (cheats) sorts through the black deck to find a new card. “Here we go: ‘Blank. That’s how I want to die.’ — Harry Potter. Well, maybe not
That had never happened. That never
Ms Danger made herself visible and looked up at him with big, brown Springer Spaniel eyes. Her fur, now a warm, auburn and white wave, was soft against his hands as she pushed her head into his palm. The book she had in her mouth dug further into his gut, but at least it wasn’t the one on Animagi that was due this week.
She nodded. “You have it.”
Harry’s heart skipped a beat and he forced himself to look forward, straight into Ms Jones’ narrowed gaze.
Harry nodded glumly. “Thanks.”
“Eggs and toast for you, bucko.”
became part of that group by extension. You were part of the shibboleth in that moment.”
Finally, Draco was pushing his robes off his shoulders and down his arms. He tugged his t-shirt over his head and bent down again to lick Draco’s feverish skin, delighting in the throaty moan that followed. “
Learning to weave was hardly a difficult task, comparatively.
“No, I said if I’d been
Harry flopped back on his bed next to his mobile and crossed his hands behind his head, staring at the ceiling and thinking of hypoxic waters while he waited. His phone vibrated. Harry grabbed blindly for it and brought it to his face.
And then all too soon, wobbly rays of sunlight began to filter down and Harry knew they were nearing the surface.
Draco sat back on the desk and spread his legs as Harry neared his belly button. “Potter,” he breathed. “Potter, what are you doing?”
He was defending Snape, and it made him sort of hate himself.
“Riiight,” Ron says. “Not anymore anyway. So no, then?”
Harry cleared his throat. “So, Transfigurations.” Malfoy made an agreeable noise, which was a good sign. “Why? I didn’t even know you were good at Transfigurations. I thought you were good at Potions.”
He set his cauldron up and headed for the front of the room, where a selection of potions ingredients were arrayed for him to choose from. There was the boggart liver, and the astragalus and chicory root and all the other minutiae involved. He took a measure of distilled water and returned to his table.
Potter rolled onto his side, facing Draco. He brought his hand up, his fingers toying with the edge of the sheet, teasing it lower. His eyes sparkled.
Potter tapped at the keys with one hand, feeding himself with the other. Crumbs fell on the letters, but he didn’t seem to mind, which was just like a Gryffindor.
Harry sat back, blinking quickly. That sounded rather forceful. “Well,” he couldn’t help saying.
Hermione nodded, sipped her cappuccino, and slowly, ironically, repeated, “Wowww.”
works on Muggles,” the MACUSA rep said, rolling his eyes. “Just because it didn’t work on mice doesn’t mean it won’t work on Muggles, who are a completely different species. The spell is MFDA-approved, so it’s perfectly safe.”
“Potter, they know about the blood ward,” he said right away.
“It’s just,” Ron said, hesitated, then laughed sharply. “It’s just that both me
Malfoy didn’t reply right away. Harry heard him sigh. “Do you think McGonagall will take me on if I can’t get the Animagus transformation?”
Frowning, he writes,
Her lips twitched. “He’s found a way to deal with it.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I distinctly remember a broccoli and cheese casserole.”
“Pardon? Eternal life, Potter…It’s hardly destructive.”
He grimaced, imagining what ‘softening to Malfoy’ would entail.
That was worrying. Even more worrying was that the ICW had neglected to share this news with the rest of the task force. Draco wondered if Potter knew.
When he goes to sleep, he thinks about him there, too, only when he’s asleep, he can’t stop his subconscious from remembering that night with the Muggle and replacing the woman with him…or sometimes even replacing her with Malfoy. He dreams about the long line of Malfoy’s spine; he sees it shiny with perspiration and bowed with pleasure; he sees Malfoy turning his head back over his shoulder and looking at Harry with sex-drunk eyes, his body moving with each of Harry’s thrusts, and fuck, when he wakes up from those, he forgets that Malfoy is
The Antique Vibrator Museum was embarrassingly intriguing to Harry.
“Initiate Hufflepuffs,” said Emily. “You have been sorted Hufflepuff because there is a great part of you that values what our founder valued. You proved your worth when you entered our den. In the three years that you’ve resided among us, you have learned Hufflepuff values and grown to respect and love each of your housemates, despite the differences we all have. You have learned tolerance for people who’re different from you, loyalty to your fellow badgers, the value of a cool head in all situations, and tonight, you will see the exponential power of plurality. As I learned in first year, from the Muggleborn girl who’d become my best friend three days later, we are large and we contain multitudes.”
Malfoy pushes in and the burn of it is slow and aching, as if this is exactly what Harry’s body was made for, only it needs to be reminded.
“And now look at it from Draco’s perspective,” says Luna. “His father’s dead, his mother moved to Italy, he’s all alone in that big, dusty manor that, I’m sure, holds more bad memories for him than it does for me, and even though he graduated in the same Auror class as you and Ron and Susan, he’s still a Junior Auror while the rest of you have been promoted. He’s a highly specialised Auror with a track record equal to your own. He’s earned the chance for a good career.”
“She’s a kneazle,” Harry said. “And I haven’t named her.”
“I really wasn’t,” Harry said.
Dudley gave him a look echoing the sentiment. “Is that even possible with a potential breach this large?”
Harry grinned back. “How’s Ron taking it?”
“It’s nearly lunch,” Ernie broke in. “You two were still in bed?”
“Situation normal, then,” said Potter.
Harry grimaced. No, he wasn’t. He wasn’t anything close to okay. His head was spinning with a hundred different terrifying future paths, like he was a ruddy seer or something. And just like Trelawney, none of the futures he saw were good ones.
He decanted an ounce, sniffed it. It smelled…well, it had a smell. Sort of coconutty, sort of pineappley. Probably why Slughorn was so excited about this one today. But was it a vague scent or a decided scent?
“Riiight,” said Blaise.
Ron scrunched his nose; all his freckles merged together for the duration. “Right, well. Why are all my friends gay?” he then wondered, as they made their way back towards the other end of Diagon. “First you, and now Hermione’s gallivanting off with Millicent Bulstrode. And Slytherins at that, the both of you. It’s not right, Harry, the things you put me through. I’ve been imagining a hundred years of Christmas dinners with Malfoy ever since we left the broom shop, and Harry, it’s not a pretty sight. Are you sure you’re up for it? With his colouring, he’s going to be a right eyesore at a hundred-twenty. All that
“Ohhh, fuck,” said Draco. Pansy eyed him sharply, said nothing.
They put on some Bubblehead Charms (Hermione cast his), took their mobile out of their pockets, and ducked underneath the water, carefully directing the oysters to the seafloor. Hermione pointed to a nice rocky patch about thirty feet down and they sent them down, applying a light sticking charm to the bottom oysters. They could move if they wanted to, but it would give them good purchase until they decided to attach their suckers to the rocks beneath.
He busied himself in the converted ground floor kitchen, setting the kettle to boil the non-magical way over a fire in his hearth, and arranging the tray with cups and the biscuits Harry always bought because Draco liked (but never ate and always ended up throwing away because he hated them and they went bad). But he had them now and that was good, wasn’t it?
Hermione sipped her pod-coffee, and continued:
Harry shook his head. “I don’t know who to pick,” he admitted to them. His eyes caught Malfoy, looking down and away, even though Harry didn’t want to look at him. He didn’t want to be drawn to Malfoy or to think of him constantly. But he did anyway, and he
“We could burn the whole bloody castle down.”
Ruby brought him a plate, shouldering freckly Dune out of the way with the sort of friendly disregard that only those who don’t understand their true size can have. And Ruby was definitely a man of size. Harry watched his shoulders flexing under his red plaid shirt, rolled up at the sleeves, and thought,
been here all along. It is only that they thought they’d solved their problem with our kind when Atlantis disappeared.”
Even Lucius, bad gambler that he was, wouldn’t have done that lightly.
If there’s one thing he’s certain about, it’s that he cannot survive without Malfoy with him. He doesn’t even know how he made it through the first six years of Hogwarts without accidentally killing himself. Malfoy’s been a staple in his life since eighth year Potions class and that day Harry would’ve blown his head off without Malfoy’s quick interception of a fatally incorrect ingredient.
request he’s ever received aside from Draco’s on the train before first year. Other people just assume they’re acquaintances or friends after meeting him, and it’s made him uncomfortably aware of his own personal space and when other people are easing themselves into it.
“Oh, shut up, Hermione,” Millicent said, sighing. “Sometimes pain is compulsory.”
Harry shrugged. “The life of a suspicious person. You should see the trouble Lee has getting a cab.”
He was reminded, several times, of the fairies he’d seen at the beginning of term. Fairies that were supposed to be hibernating. Were those…?
There is just this, nothing else. If they'd had before... or... or... or.
Slytherins might not be cowards, but it appeared that they didn’t bounce back from abject terror quite as quickly as Gryffindors.
“Me?!” Malfoy said. “These things got through the Manor wards! I don’t want either of you staying here a moment longer—“
He nodded. “It was only for Muggles.”
Ron would be laughing at him right now.
Suddenly, her eyes lit up. “Harry!” she said, leaning across the table and nearly upsetting the fresh coffee their waitress had brought. “I’ve got it! Let’s start a business!”
Harry lay back on his bed, slicking up his fingers and tracing them over his entrance. Sometimes he wished he could just pull one off at the wrist and be done with it. The effort it took to get off was the reason Harry so rarely did. Even if he woke up with the most amazing morning wood in history, he’d still never have time to prepare himself and fuck himself on one of his dildos before he had to be at work. And after work, he was too exhausted to want to spend that much time by himself on ‘maintenance.’ Orgasms were like a weekend treat. It would be so much better if it were something he could do with a partner, something that would feel intimate and lovely instead of a requirement of making it through the next week.
“We got her,” said Draco. “I had to go back alone to talk to the goblins,” he added pointedly to Harry, and Harry ignored, “but they released the magical records to me and I was able to find a link. In fact,” he added, turning to Teddy, “I think it was an offhand mention of my favourite little heir that convinced them to hand them over.”
Malfoy says nothing.
Harry grunts. She can’t even be a bad partner, can she? Just give him
He’d already turned the corner when Harry’d parsed out the insults and remembered to yell out, “Thanks, Malfoy!” but
This was bigger than even he’d thought.
“Watch it, Potter,” Malfoy muttered, but there wasn’t any feeling behind it. He was too preoccupied with craning his neck around Harry to look up the spiral stairs. It annoyed Harry. Merlin,
Harry raised his eyebrows, took a sip from his rapidly cooling coffee. These environmentally-friendly conjured cups (“ConjureCups™ disappear into the void after use!”) had zero insulation. Malfoy was already sat at the table in his prescribed spot with his prescribed placard, twirling a quill between two fingers in the most boredly intricate fashion.
Mrs Granger brought the tea in and they busied themselves pouring tea and grabbing biscuits. Behind her, the television was flickering between different scenes, though the sound had been turned off. Every now and then, clips of their presser played. Draco had never seen so much of his own face, and he had been known for spending too long styling his hair in the Slytherin loos.
“I never told you how much I needed you,” Draco said, in between panted breaths. “I should’ve told you. I shouldn’t have let you think I hated you.”
“Hey!”
He chewed for a few minutes, took a drink of black coffee (he was not a fan of tea), and continued: “Even though Atlantis is inhabited, they’re all happy to believe it was a tectonic plate shift that unearthed a previously underwater island—the tsunami helped that, you know?—Portugal was soaked and there were about five hundred people killed along the south of France and Italy. A bunch in northern African countries, too, but somehow most of the tribal peoples there made a hasty trek inland the week before, for no explainable reason whatsoever, so there weren’t more than a handful killed there.”
“We were resolving it,” said Harry. “We were meeting the Mers’ demands so they’d stop attacks.”
At this point, Hermione and Millicent’s selective hearing selected to hear again. Harry felt the weight of their astounded gazes without even having to turn his head. Surprisingly, it was Millicent who spoke first.
“Welcome to Hufflepuff. You’ve made it through the barrels, and so you must be true badgers, even if you don’t look like them yet. A few words to get you started as you adjust to your new house: We are one.”
Harry shifted. The low, solid sound of Draco’s voice certainly wasn’t helping matters any. “Do you know what I think?” asked Harry.
“Seriously?” asked Harry. It was such a nice spot.
Teddy paused and considered this. His forehead scrunched. “Erm… did you have Draco’s penis in your mouth? Because it looked like you did.”
Rees made an ‘ugh’ sound. “Really? No one’s going to follow? None of you are decent Hufflepuffs. I can’t believe you left your fellow badger to go through alone. We have our work cut out for us.”
Harry nodded in agreement. “We also have to share cases and coffee in the breakroom. Honestly, there’s so much sharing going on between us already that we might as well be re-sorted into Hufflepuff.”
Yeah, he was definitely done for.
“A greyhound,” said Draco, preening a bit.
Harry took Draco’s hand in the chaos. No one was looking, and he could risk this little pleasure, he figured. “There’s still time for Greece, if you really want to.”
“He’s right,” said Hermione. “And they deserve to be negotiated
, and they’re inviting the press to the event.”
“Oh, yeah! Have you guys eaten yet? There’s this food truck here that I always have to stop at when I come down. They sell Thai hot dogs. It’s the weirdest, coolest thing.”
Potter snorted. “Non-magicals can’t do Occlumency, Malfoy.”
“Where are you?” Harry demanded. “We’ll come get you. Tell us how to find you.”
He found the Alchemy section and scanned the shelves for titles that looked relevant enough to what he was looking for and modern enough that he’d be able to understand the text. Despite his enthusiasm, this was not Harry’s forte, and he felt adrift amid the sea of books and unfamiliar terminology. This dedication was not spurred from some long-lost, innate sense of studiousness, but from something much more primal and raw. Where Voldemort had been a monstrous, nightmarish fear, it was something physical he could fight. The prospect of losing his magic was so much more; it was feral, icy, and it stole his breath when he thought on it too long. His determination to help was about survival, about keeping him and his community alive.
Here they were looking for abstract ways to contact abstract Muggles, and Hermione had
Jones continued: “We got you an Airbnb in Foggy Bottom. Just four stops up on Metro, but it’s walkable if you’re the type. About thirty minutes. Might actually be faster given all the single-tracking on Metro lately. I never know what segment they’re closing next.”
“I got tired of having to ask him to heal my knuckles after I broke them on his pointy fucking face. He got so smug.”
She quickly walked to his desk, handed him a large parchment envelope and was out again in the blink of an eye. The Minister gave them an apologetic look and opened the envelope. Inside was a clipping of a special edition
“Milly,” Dudley said with a laugh, “They’ll think I’m a nutter.”
“You told me I could come buy some from you.”
Teddy gave him a sly look. “Wore him out, did you?”
“Hello, Mrs Black,” said Hermione.
“They’re already separated. We recombine them one final time. I’ve Transfigured their molecular formulations. They won’t melt now, but they will be receptive to change when heated. When they reach the appropriate temperature, you’ll need to charm the Sulphur one into the Salt and then the Mercury around them both. I’ll transfigure them into a single, solid structure, with each layer separate but combined.”
“Harry Potter,” said Harry. Zeph smiled again, all pearly white teeth, russet hair, and sharp black eyes. Harry was immediately in love. Zeph followed Luna’s direction into the Opera House and Harry turned in time for the next wizard flying down.
“There has to be another way,” said Draco. “Besides risking our magic.”
Malfoy rubbed the bridge of his nose. “There’s very little magic that’s been developed to work in conjunction with Muggle technology, Potter. And certainly not a spell that was developed before most humans even had a written language.”
Queen Sostrate was unamused but very politic about showing it. “I cannot.”
Ron opened the door when they and Luna apparated into the Weasleys’ back garden, already beaming; Ginny right behind him. His smile barely faltered when he saw Draco standing stiffly behind Harry, trying to hold a terrified Peep as far away from his dark-coloured robes as possible. Severia and Crookshanks, for their parts, sat cleaning their paws, and behaving, on top of Harry’s levitated trunk. As it turned out, Luna also had a cat: a yellow tom, named Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore-Grindelwald, which she abbreviated to Alperwu.
“They’re giving out biscuits in the canteen for anyone who returns their self-eval by noon,” Hermione said as Harry walked with her to the lifts. “I figured we could go snag all the florentines and chocolate bourbons before everyone else opens their inboxes.”
At any rate, he wasn’t interested in wanking anymore.
“Mr Koetsu asks his camerawoman to make sure she gets a good shot of this,” said the translator. “Mr Koetsu wants it filmed from all angles.”
Had she studied baby Harry like this? Had she foreseen she would give her life and magic for him, just for him to give his life and magic to someone else?
Harry and Lee approached the Arrivals desk, and the wizard looked up from his computer, smiling.
“And now for the celebration of our unity,” said Alick. “We give thanks to the magic that unites us, and we illuminate the things that make us different.”
“Hi, Albus’s Uncle D,” Scorpius echoed.
“Will you forgive me?” Seabiscuit glared harder. “What if I take your tank up with me and Mrs Black?”
“Welcome, welcome. Thank you all for joining us today. I am Herbert Kurzschluss, Supreme Mugwump for Germany,” he said, his accent coming through the more he spoke. “And also President of the ICW, your host today!”
“Badgers!” called Professor Sprout, her voice somehow still soft. They were all awake now, some more coherent than others, but awake nonetheless. The cold from the snow was starting to get to them now that they were conscious, and Harry was sure some of them would need a potion or three to heal themselves of frostbite. “I must ask you all to return to the Sett now, please. I will have Madam Pomfrey see to you all there, and then I must ask those of you who are well enough to attend breakfast in the Great Hall. It would not do for all of my upper years to be missing the morning after such a racket of a storm."
“Draco!” Harry choked out. He could barely breath himself but he had to get Draco out of there, had to fix him. Why weren’t the vapours affecting him as badly? Why wasn’t Snape still talking? Why hadn’t anyone come to see what the explosion was? Oh, god, the Weasleys—if they came outside and breathed the—
“I think so,” Hermione said. “But those books are rubbish. Politicians use them when they want to brush up on something so they sound like they know what they’re talking about, without actually knowing what they’re talking about.”
“I think, my lady,” came Severus’s low voice, “that they are unaware of the inherent technical immortality of Atlantean.”
Harry grabbed his bar shampoo and scrubbed it into his hair, dragging it harder over his scalp than he really needed to. What was Chieftess Undine’s niece’s name? What games did she play? What watery books did she read? Did she want to be chieftess when she grew up?
“But yes—it’s a Malfoy trait. We are unfailingly good at making business decisions. I’ve been in this league since third year, and I haven’t failed to place top three once.”
at the ICW meeting. Draco could definitely get behind Potter’s surprisingly funny and subtle pettiness, though it presented a danger to Draco’s ability to refrain from wanking over him for the foreseeable future. It made him feel as if they were on the same side for once.
Draco sighs heavily and then comes to sit down on the chair across from him. He props his elbows on his knees and stares at Harry. “What’s going on, Harry?”
He shrugs. It took me awhile to realize it. How I’d always felt drawn to Nigella, how she reminded me so much of my owl, who died in the war. That owl was the first being to ever love me, that I ever loved. Her magic was familiar and safe. The same magic I’d feel in dreams of my mother. And Nigella has it, too. I never felt it until she started pouring it out of herself.”
“Much better than seeing more of these stupid American ambassadors’ faces,” she said after swallowing, and irritably flung the day’s paper onto the steps in front of them. “I’m beginning to believe that they’re still just bitter about being colonies. Don’t they see that they’re endangering
There was nothing for it; he’d have to do it manually, like any other potion. He reached into the ward, and grabbed the Poison. His dragonhide gloves were too slick—it nearly slipped out of his hand at first.
A bell tolled, and Harry jumped up, realising what had woken him up. The eight a.m. bells. Breakfast was half over. “Malfoy,” Harry whispered, shaking his shoulder. “Malfoy, we have to get up. It’s eight."
“Call me Petunia.”
Draco shrugged. “It’s different when you know everyone so well. There were a lot of people there I don’t know well.”
Draco snorted. “That sounds like you.” He turned back to Andromeda and added, “He was particularly obligation-free this Thursday at work, when he somehow managed to avoid the semi-annual all-staff meeting by claiming ‘women’s issues’.”
“Since Binns’ class for me,” Potter admitted, then laughed again. “I’d forgotten about it, but then—you being back here, at Hogwarts. It all came back, much as I wanted to ignore it.”
Harry exhaled. “Good. Thanks. I’m going to talk to Minerva about how we can improve the wards, too. With the Statute in question and now these mysterious ships floating around, I’d feel a lot better if Hogwarts was virtually invisible to
“Malfoy!” Harry called after him. Malfoy paused, glancing back over his shoulder.
She nodded her head towards the train, where Ron was gently cuffing Rosie on the shoulder and giving what looked to be a very Gryffindor-inspired pep talk. “They get on so well.”
They stared at one another for several long moments.
“Malfoy,” Harry growled.
Their waiter approached warily, circling around the privacy spell and trying to gauge their facial expressions. But Draco’s water glass was empty, and apparently desperately needed to be filled. The waiter broached the edge, hesitantly refilled Draco’s glass, and hurried out again.
When everyone had a plate of food, including Mrs Malfoy who was studying her noodles with some degree of intensity, Malfoy began:
By the end of May, the empty space at Harry’s side that Draco had only just begun to fill was already changing into something new, but somehow more volatile and maddening than the same empty space that existed before Malfoy.
“We have seen the Nott finances and the Patils are satisfied that there is no undue risk inherent in the union proposed between Theodore and me. I, Padma Patil, on behalf of my parents and sister, do accept Theodore into the House of Patil from the day of our marriage on.”
“No, I’ve got it,” he said. Harry levitated the tea set over to the table while he plated the pies. He took a deep breath and made his way over to the table. Now that it was all over, he was starting to feel rather… exposed. He set a pie down in front of Draco and then another at the seat diagonal from him. He took probably too long pouring the tea and fixing it how Draco always took it at Hogwarts before sitting down himself.
, up there, in one of those terrifying-looking spaceships, doing Merlin knew what to him. What if they were experimenting on him? What if they were torturing him? What if they were kil—
She left that hanging, a confused shrug of her shoulders. Malfoy nodded, thanked her.
why veteran players must try out for their teams each year.”
Hermione strode to the back door, where the anti-Apparition wards dropped off on the back deck. “Shall we? Narcissa gave me the coordinates for the ward anchor leypoint. We’ll meet them and spread out from there.”
It turned out that Harry and Hermione both had previously undiscovered creative streaks, something that surprised everyone who knew them. With the success of their Fortescue New Year’s event, the press had got hold of their venture and done several pieces on their business, which they belatedly came up with a name for and registered with the Ministry, once Francine Fortescue asked them for it and they abruptly realised they’d forgotten it.
He shifted, getting more comfortable in his spot on the floor, leaning against the wall. Should he look in the mirror? Where did Dumbledore get off on still trying to control him? He was twenty-two years old, for Merlin’s sake. He’d already done his dark lord thing, and he’d passed a Potions apprenticeship with a very bored and ornery Severus Snape. He’d more than proved himself.
But Harry didn’t need to know that, not tonight. Tonight, he was happy and more relaxed than he’d been since St James Park, and he didn’t have to sleep alone in this room that he didn’t want to admit kind of freaked him out. But tonight, Malfoy was here…and Malfoy got it. Malfoy understood.
“Ah ah,” Harry said.
Her expression cleared. “Those of us who were altered, or made from altered humans, do not age and die naturally…or at least, it’s rare that we do. It is a curse upon us, but has allowed for much time for study and many great advances in technology and magic.”
She trailed off again, the hope she was forcing onto herself so brittle and obvious. They all knew there was nothing a detective could do for Dudley.
Ron’s mouth moves, a distinct panic shuddering through him as he stares at Harry and process this faster than he should have to, but not as fast as the impending mania wants him to. “What about you?” he says, voice hoarse.
There was a series of vigorous nods.
“The fairies are weird this week, aren’t they?” Harry said to Millicent the morning the students were to arrive.
For one, Draco was certain he’d finally landed on the correct method to incorporate wands into the Atlantis spell. If his maths were correct (and they always were) then they could, theoretically, put out enough power between the two of them—assuming they were standing in Atlantis at the time—to reach the mainlands in either direction, rushing over the oceans in search of conduits to bounce it back into the air again, stronger than before.
“Wizarding Britain disagrees with you. And if you find love, is it really such a bad thing?”
The way he looked at his inkwell, then his fancy ten galleon quill, then Madam Pince, made it clear. Slowly, Harry grinned. “You can’t do it, can you?”
Malfoy looks like he wants to smile, but he doesn’t. “Thanks for lunch, Potter,” he says, beginning to turn away. Instinctively, Harry reaches out and grabs his arm. Malfoy pauses, but it takes another tug before he turns back around.
, after being reunited with me for less than a week in the fucking United States of Arseholes, you hump me on a kitchen table without so much as a by your leave! Do you not see anything wrong with this? Does
“Are they here?!” Teddy called from upstairs. He pounded down the steps, yelling, “I want to be Professor Plum!”
“Fuck, Harry, do you have a death wish?” she says, pressing her hands to his throat. She’s looking around wildly, curses flying over their heads. A blasting curse hits the table guarding them and she flinches as the impact reverberates like thunder against the Protego infused into it.
Dudley was quiet for a moment, only the sound of his elevated breathing to show he was still on the line.
“Just invite yourself into my house, Malfoy, please,” Harry said.
“Ah ah, Teddy darling,” Narcissa said. “The forks go on the left. Littlest to biggest, if you please.”
Harry shrugged, and struggled to think about not-Malfoy. “He’s really, erm, sexy.”
Ms Lovecraft was still screaming, but Harry couldn’t see a thing, and then Ms Williams—the most rational of all his fifth years—started screaming, too. Her voice cut off midway through as she fainted, and Mr Kilgore and Mr Dearborn jointly caught her before she cracked her head open.
“Seven!” said Teddy. “Want to hear how far I can go? One times one is one. One times two is two. One times three is–”
The Slytherins started cackling across the room, and Harry’s face turned red, even though he knew they couldn’t hear him. That meant maybe it was Hermione’s reaction that was causing it—he had no idea why she’d stopped talking, but the look on her face told him that she’d just realised something horrid. Something where he was found wanting.
He dried off quickly, newly invigorated with a purpose besides ‘Maybe get to go home one day.’ Back in his Grimmauld Place bedroom, he pulled his mobile from his jeans pocket and texted Malfoy’s number.
Pansy stopped short, inhaled and exhaled slowly. Draco put a hand on her back and she gave him a grateful smile.
In the bathrooms, Harry stripped and tossed his pyjamas into the laundry basket for the elves to pick up. In Hufflepuff, he hadn’t yet had to wait for the water to heat up, which significantly improved his mornings. He turned the faucet on and it automatically began spraying cedar-scented water at the perfect temperature and the perfect pressure. In Gryffindor, he’d often suffered through chilly, weak showers – even magic couldn’t save them from the travesty of seventh storey water pressure – but these Hufflepuff showers sprayed sinfully firm jets of water
“Are you shitting me, Potter,” Draco said flatly. “How are we going to get twenty-five
They jerked their heads at his frame, but he was studiously staring at the book laid out on his desk, and refused to meet their gazes. When he finally did look up, his expression was carefully neutral. “Like any potion, the Alchemical process is personalised for each individualised wizard. The reason it hasn’t been made widely available like a standardised Pepper-Up is because there is no standard process. Its magic is in the transformation, not in the product.”
in Britain. Why do you keep talking about it as if there were? Have you been hexed?”
“Gentlemen!” Andromeda snapped. They jumped to attention.
One night in early March, Dexter Loupe made an impossible play, and Harry, who’d been on the edge of his seat listening to the play-by-play, screamed in surprise and excitement, much to the girls’ annoyances. Then Malfoy threw a toy quaffle at his face, and Harry caught it, and then he twirled Malfoy around, and it was
“Oh my god,” Harry said faintly, staring into the red, blinking light of the camera.
Malfoy unzipped the tent, stepped in. Harry and Millicent followed him and added a dozen warding and security spells to the tent. Then, for good measure, he added the hiding ward Hermione had used during their year on the run.
Luna ignored his outburst as she was wont to do. “The
“Oh?” Draco said, suddenly more interested. “Have you got Ogden’s in this house?”
, speaks Mandarin and would like to interview the extraterrestrial.”
“Severia,” Harry said to his kneazle, choosing to ignore Draco’s words. They’d come too close to saying too much already. The kneazle looked at him questioningly. “I’m afraid you’ll have to get used to it. What Malfoy wants, Malfoy gets.”
“Yeah.”
“Jesus Christ!” someone yelled. The sentiment was repeated in dozens of languages.
There were perhaps twenty people altogether, most of whom were older and that he’d never met. As his eyes travelled around the table, he was surprised and dismayed to see Happy Terry Boot there, with a girl perhaps three or four years their senior. The sandy hair and beatific grin on her face gave her away as another Boot. Terry gave him a grin and an exuberant wave, and Harry forced one in return.
“Do they talk?” she asked. Harry shook his head. “Strange. You know, Harry, I’ve noticed that other houses aren’t like ours, like Gryffindor, I mean.”
So he did what he did when Hermione said something uncomfortable. He changed the subject. “What was that you were going to say last night then? About the Felix Felicis? Because you know I’m right. It’s a brilliant idea.”
Harry may’ve passed out at some point. When he came back to himself, there were tear-tracks leading down the side of his face and he wondered how an orgasm had brought him to that. Malfoy was lying on the bed next to him still struggling to breathe. Harry levered himself up on his elbows and stared at the white wall of his hotel room. He blinked.
“What is it?” Harry echoed.
A week in, and Harry’d only left the dungeons for meals. Even his rooms were down there, isolated from everyone else’s except Miguela, who was housed a corridor away. Snape had him testing new bases made from poisonous mushrooms, and it was exhausting work, but he absolutely loved it. And that was such a revelation that it floored him when he had time to stop and think about it.
“Jean is starting to favour Granger-Weasley,” says Fields. “Bit of extra fluff to that one’s tail.”
“Scarface?” asked Malfoy, cautiously.
“There was a tsunami?” Pansy asked.
“Better get off his bed,” Harry advised sleepily. “She might come in and screech at you. Does she still do that, too?”
“There’s your Eton showing,” Draco said. “Yeats, Justin, really?”
Draco remained uninterested throughout. He listened with half an ear while devoting the rest of his attention to the people around the table. He picked out many he knew—many his father had known, in another time—idly cataloguing their strengths and weaknesses in his head.
Harry would love to ask a few, such as ‘What the fuck,’ but she turns around before he can get the words up. “I’ll be in my office,” says Fievel. “Big clusterfuck with the Turkish Ministry. Would tell you more, but it’s Burnt Orange clearance level. Oh, forgot to mention, you’re also on coffee, lunch, and morning
Blaise was sitting on the rocks but jumped right back in when he saw Draco.
To think—a wizard could be made a Squib in just three minutes.
“As you say, Minister,” said Ron’s partner.
Google returned a page of results on everything from
“Appetiser?” she asked. She scrunched her eyebrows. “Or, er… small plate?”
Professor Sprout found them in the morning, just as the first rays of daylight were peeking over the horizon. She had a wheelbarrow of garden supplies and chocolate with her. Harry was Ennervated by Addolgar Rees, who was still covered in morning dew and snow when he spelled Harry awake.
“As if you ever listen,” Severus muttered, from half-beneath Potter’s coat lapel. Draco had no idea how he was seeing anything but the strap from Potter’s shoulder bag and a bit of stone facade.
Neville laughed, and even that sounded tired. “Zach Smith could’ve still been here.”
parts that wizards can’t normally go to!”
“It was—peculiar,” he agreed, lamely. “It seemed really simple compared to everything else he’s given us.”

Thus adrift, he leaned against the window, and determinedly did not think of whether his friendship with Ron had been detrimental to Ron’s life.
It was like a revelation to Draco. He shook his head in wonder.
“How much did you spend on the elf, Mother?” Draco asked, looking defeated.
“There’s this spell I found,” he said. “It’ll break fire down into its mundane parts. For example, fire is made mostly of carbon dioxide, water vapour, oxygen, and nitrogen. The spell was used in the Bronze Age to stop forest fires – they’d sort out the carbons and the nitrogen, and the oxygen and water vapours would reform themselves into water and air, and it would instantly stop the fire. I bet we could use it for other chemicals, too.”
“What are you –”
The Slytherins in residence—Pansy, Millicent, Adrian Pucey, Astoria Greengrass, and Theo Nott—all apparently trouped up to Malfoy’s quarters in his tower the day he arrived; Harry understood from Luna the next day that it had been a dazzling, delightful welcome party, but that she couldn’t tell him anything further without breaking a number of sacred confidences. He was not jealous, even when he found out that Dudley had managed an invite, too—apparently Millicent’s doing.
—everywhere. GIFs of their presser were in every Twitter feed. Close-ups of the alien’s conversation with Ms Liu were trending. The video had already been uploaded to YouTube and watched over one million times.
“I notice Albus himself didn’t bother reading it once it came in?”
says it was aliens. UFOs.”
“They want to live on our planet and breed with humans, but they think magic’s dangerous, and they intend to wipe it out first,” Potter offered. “Killing magical people is the first step to them moving in, so to speak.”
we argued about your communicative choices with the goblins?”
who doesn’t want to own or imprison me?”
“I’m pretty predictable,” Harry admits. He pulls a small package from his pocket and unshrinks it. “Remember that time you told me rice noodles pair best with aromatic white wines?”
“Look, I’m not going to let them destroy our work,” Harry said forcefully. He stood up and began to pace. Seabiscuit watched him amid a palette of pink gravel. And that was the story Harry felt in himself.
“It’s Dumbledore’s doing,” Harry said. “He’s scheming again. There’s a boggart in that wardrobe, and that mirror shows things one ought already know.”
But their plan was in action. The path was moving forward. Each step closer to safety—and the loss of their own magic.
She shrugged. “I remembered feeling differently before that day. Afterwards, I was always so…so angry. Even before—before Lily started showing magic. I was just always angry and afraid of everything. I think, somehow, I remembered that day without actually remembering it. I remembered magic hurt me…and that I should’ve had it, but couldn’t do it anymore.
“Dunno,” Harry said. “No one, really, but Hermione and Millicent come by sometimes.”
Pansy and Draco exclaimed together.
, he writes, the words sharp and snapping in the air.
Shortly after, they approached a large palace, built high and white in the Greek fashion of yore. Draco wasn’t surprised by this—the few surviving sketches and paintings of Atlantean architecture suggested the same—but it was still astounding to finally witness firsthand.
“So what’s the catch?” Petunia asked, shrewdly.
Millicent narrowed her eyes. “You’re saying you’ll believe in magic, but you won’t believe in alien abductions when I’ve got one right here in front of you, living and breathing?”
“Harry, you utter
“Since when?” Malfoy could not have expressed disbelief more if he’d literally said ‘the fuck you don’t.’
, which he hated, but kept abreast of anyway just to make sure no one tried to libel him too badly.
“You certainly need the help,” Draco muttered. Harry lifted his eyebrows and smiled, waiting. “What,
“You see that?” Harry said to Hermione. It was one of the nights she’d stayed to eat dinner with him instead of rushing off with the other Ravenclaws. They usually invited Ron over, too, but he hadn’t shown for dinner yet. Hermione stopped talking and followed his gaze. Her mouth curved into a thoughtful frown.
, a spell that Summons an item to the spell caster. You’re free to hold up anything you’d like to be used for the spell.”
“Hello, Potter,” drawls Malfoy from his perch. He’s sitting stiffly, as Lavender’s pulling his hair one way and Pansy the other while Dean crouches before him, painting shimmery white speckles over his naked chest. “My favourite twat in a hat.”
“It says here on the Google,” Lee spoke up, “that what they’re supposed to do is create these buffer zones for the run-off. Riparian zones.” He was leaning almost all the way into the screen, his eyes squinting. Hermione reached over and fixed the zoom on the laptop. Lee beamed.
He heard Draco sigh from somewhere above and to his right, and then he was moving in front of him, coming around to slide down the wall next to Harry. He rolled his head over to regard him, grey eyes deathly blue in the reflected light. “I’m afraid to ask,” he murmured. “I was sure you’d pass, but you look so angry that I’m beginning to worry.”
“No good, man,” said Lee. “The NoMug—NoMajes would just holiday there instead, and then the Mers wouldn’t be able to hide so well.”
“Mother…” Draco whined.
They’d exhausted the pleasantries and were now sitting in a tense silence. Albus was curled on Ginny’s lap, petting Harry’s invisible dog, Ms Danger. Luna leant into Gin’s free side, gave Harry a soft smile.
“Not speaking to me now, Potter?” Malfoy says, voice rising in annoyance. “Too good to for me now that you’ve a brand new Gryffindor partner?”
“Yeah,” Draco said, distractedly. He turned the rough, pink stone over in his hand, but the frown on his face didn’t ease. “It’s a metamorphic stone, made from quartz and other things. My—my father used it as a focus stone inlay in his wand.”
“You are so full of yourself,” Draco croaks.
“Oh,” Hermione said, as if this explained everything. Harry glared at the lovely green grass covering Central Park. “Well—that might be the reason he signed up, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that he doesn’t want you for you, too.”
“Gonna be tough,” Ron says. “Since it was blown up with the last explosion on the Syrian border.” He holds a picture up to the Floo, and it looks a little wobbly though the mirror, but with squinting and the activation of his translation charm, Harry can see ‘
Harry felt restless and unwieldy in his own body.
“Don’t let me leave,” Harry whispered. “It’s you. It’s always been you.”

So he picks up the stack of files from his desk chair, sits down on the floor to lean against the desk, and begins to tag and sort everything. A lot of them aren’t written in English, so he has to put the fucking translation spell back on, which of course gives him a headache, but despite all that, or maybe because of it since Harry will admit, if only to himself, that he works well under a strong sense of martyrdom, he manages to clear the chair and the desk by noon. He would keep working, in fact, if it isn’t for the disgruntled yelling in the office.
“I am such a hot mess,” he announced to his cat. She began to purr.
partner. He exits the British Embassy Arrivals Chamber where his Portkey dropped him, and pulls out the directions to Malfoy’s grandmother’s flat. For a moment, he considers hailing a cab, but then remembers that he doesn’t speak Arabic and he damned sure doesn’t write it. So he sucks it up and attempts Apparition to a place unknown.
“Draco,” Harry said warningly, but he was trying not to laugh. “You have to be polite to me in public.”
“Capture the vapours,” Draco suggested. “When they precipitate, they may be necessary to the Elixir.”
“What are we going to do?” asked Padma.
“It most certainly was not!” Draco squawked.
had been stuck in his throat, and it’s so strange how two things can have the exact same physical sensation and he would die to feel the first again while the second is making him feel like he’s dying. “The emotion it takes from the unnecessary sources, it shunts to the bond-tie. The goal was to make the villagers care enough about one another that they’d take precautions not to kill one another.”
Granger rolled her eyes. “Then don’t you think we should do that before attempting dangerous spells with unknown results? If Atlantis has been hidden for thousands of years, then magic made that happen. I think it likely they know what magic did it, and how to reproduce it to hide themselves again.”
“I want to know more about these—aliens, she called them? Where can I find more information on them?” asked Malfoy.
. He’s a lazy sort of exerciser, so he only does it when he’s forced to because it’s part of his workday. When all he has to do is sit at home in front of his telly, well, that’s all he does. He could do some push-ups in front of the couch between games like Draco used to, but he doesn’t give enough fucks to bother. He’s always been able to stay in shape with just his on-the-job training, and the discipline to go further is, quite frankly, beyond Harry’s capability right now.
“Well, take a break and get us all lunch. We like the shawarma from the Muggle woman with the blue cart, and pick up a few of those bread baskets from the magical man on the bicycle since we didn’t get croissants this morning.”
wrong,” Draco says. “This is far too tidy to be crowd-sourced.”
“Because I don’t want you to think that this is going anywhere—”
“Last night was certainly…” She cleared her throat.
They crossed Constitution Avenue with a crowd of tourists. Some coming the other way, from the Mall, bumped into Draco, who was not accustomed to right-side walking. Probably most wizards weren’t—after all, one always wanted one’s wand hand to be closest to the potential enemy. The tourist tossed a map on the ground and Harry picked it up, annoyed. That map was going to end up in the water supply one day!
“Well, well, well. Charm me surprised. You’re actually reading.”
Harry nodded, looked out to the crowd. Immediately, they started shouting things out—oranges, tomatoes, cricket balls, a laptop computer, even an elephant, which Harry grimaced at. A woman in the front row was furiously scrolling her mobile and then stuck her hand up and shouted, “a rose bouquet!”
Malfoy shrugged. “But did their militaries know?”
“No argument,” Draco sighs. He flops down again, takes another drink of the Firewhiskey, and passes the bottle to Harry. “And yet you find it without being trained in intelligence.”
“Our samples from the magical depletion sites came in this morning,” said Professor Sprout. “And since we’ve just seventh and eighth year Hufflepuffs in this class, I’d like to change the curriculum for the day. We were going to work on harvesting techniques for the mint family, but I think we’d all be better served with a return to third year’s lesson on soil analysis. Shall we?”
Harry stared. “Fuck.”
Nevertheless, the boys were still sleeping after he and Potter had pulled themselves out of bed, showered, and dressed. And both boys woke up with just light touches to their shoulders and didn’t require an
“Fuck!” Malfoy gasps.
Draco smirked. “You didn’t really think I would need the entire time, did you?"
It was lapses in judgement such as thinking more time with students was a good thing that got people like Malfoy hired on at Hogwarts as Professors of Ancient Cultures and Casting. Who the fuck cared about ancient spells? No one even used them anymore.
Millicent punched Potter in the face.
Harry pasted on a smile. “Sure thing, kiddo.”
But as he gave her a nod and continued onto the Restricted Section, that fist that had been squeezing his heart since the moment his offer letter had arrived from Headmistress McGonagall loosened just a fraction. Someone besides his friends, and McGonagall and her frustratingly easy belief in nonsense like redemption, was pleased he was here.
“What on earth is—Draco,
it. The knowledge gave Harry a previously unknown freedom. His Gryffindor reserves were full to bursting after so many weeks in Hufflepuff. He reached out and looped his arm around Draco’s waist, pulled him in the same way Draco had pulled him in to Side-Along. Harry pressed their mouths together and wanted to cry with relief and desire when Draco opened his mouth to him.
to be Mated with his Veela. He crawls back onto the bed, Summons his wand and does his best to cast a lubricating charm. It’s difficult; his magic always goes wonky when he’s wound up, and he’s rarely been as utterly undone as Malfoy is making him right now. Harry succeeds on the second attempt and then his hand is coated in oil.
, and—“
Marietta retreats and returns a moment later with the white moiré silk suit instead. Sometimes she can almost read his mind. He thinks maybe next season he’ll let her design some of the loungewear and see what she comes up with. She’s good at spotting trends—helped along, no doubt, by her nickname in the mags: Marietta Trend ‘Spotter’. People like that name; it makes them feel comfortable wearing eight foot tangerine scarves looped around their necks in the spring and spots on their forehead spelling out crude words.
Snape nodded. Then said, “I will ask Her Majesty for an audience on your behalf. I know she keeps Thursday evenings clear for her own use, so you may anticipate an invitation for that time—although with the shift in tensions amongst Muggle nations, she may be too busy. If she accepts, her office will supply a Portkey for travel. Expect a letter by tomorrow evening with the decision.”
“True,” Harry allowed.
“Wait until we get there,” Harry said. “I don’t want you to sick up on me in the middle of the Atlantic.”
“Today,” said Harry. “Her and Millicent are flooing in sometime after three.”
“We have an allergen-free option, right?”
“He’s been playing with Albus Potter,” Astoria said, with that patient, amused look on her face she always used when she was warning him about something she thought he was going to ridiculously overreact about. “They stole away together at breakfast while you were in Atlantis, and now he’s going with Albus to his Gran’s this weekend. They have LEGO.”
“You really think the photograph on Dudley’s mobile showed people from another planet, Granger?”
was not ritual-based, but that didn’t stop Hufflepuffs from turning it into one. They linked hands as they had done the night of the equinox, when Harry first saw how powerful a group of magical people could be together. Emily and Alick had chosen to sing the spell instead of chant it, an idea they got from the perpetual choir of lore.
“It worked,” he says, mostly to himself. “They’re still the same.”
But then, here she was with him, walking away from her failed marriage instead of trying not to ‘give up’ on it. Harry knew first hand how hard it was to stay in a relationship when one’s partner was the wrong gender, and that made it all the harder to watch their marriage dissolve, like salt into water. Pretending as if nothing meaningful had ever been there, when they all knew there had been. There always was.
They digested this. Harry’s mind was a whirlwind. There were so many variables. So many Muggle and magical factors coming together at precisely the right time to start them on this road of disaster.
Luna, who’d taken over the first through fifth years for Minerva (and every other week with Harry’s child thanks to her marriage to his ex-wife), was leaning back in her chair, staring at the ceiling, but her mouth twitched upwards at the words. She wasn’t entirely Nargles and daisychains. Harry took a good look at her face and saw that, despite the smile, her eyes were farther away than usual.
Severus, actually. Draco was annoyed.
He was cut off as Hermione came up and elbowed him. She said into the camera, “You deserve that, Ron, but Harry’s going to have a good time anyway. Please don’t forget that the milk will spoil if you leave it out so be sure to put it back in the icebox—”
“We got a bunch of samples from around each of the major flowering locations. Soil, water, and air. Took magical readings, too. We need to develop a way to quickly see what the cause and effect of all the chemicals to the flowers and magic in the area. Find anything on that?”
To Ginny Weasley, Potter said, “Are those dogs on
Socorro nodded. “Definitely. Company’s good, too.”
Harry and Millicent ate them in front of the tent while Harry charged his laptop with his wand. Afterwards—warm, full, and with his mind think a thousand thoughts at once—Harry lay back on the crunchy ground, head pillowed on his arms. The sky down here was different from that at Hogwarts. They were close enough to town that the light pollution from the village blocked the whole of the Milky Way, leaving only a few handfuls of stars visible.
McGonagall did not look impressed, but turned back to other matters. Harry listened with half an ear, too intrigued by the grey tartan detailing on Draco’s navy apprentice robes. The McGonagall colours looked rather…nice…on him.
Ron holds his gaze this time. “Are you?”
He wished he could talk to Albus and tell him he loved him, and he was always thinking of him, even though most of those thoughts were anxious worries about how to keep him alive when they hadn’t managed it with James.
On the Saturday of Lee’s fourth date with Madison—Harry knew which because Lee wouldn’t stop texting her these days—he and Draco spent an entire afternoon in the Grimmauld Place lab, testing and trying different experimental potions, to see if any of them could clean up large amounts of water. They weren’t having much luck with that, but Harry was having a fair bit of luck with Draco.
“We should develop a strategy, though,” Blaise added. “I should like to meet with the politicians myself and see what cards we have to play. Narcissa, perhaps we could visit together.”
“How fortuitous,” Harry said, finally craning his neck around to look the man in the eye. “The Queen of Atlantis must be delighted to have an engaging fluent speaker to chat with in her library.”
Dudley laughed. “Nah, he’s a good chap these days. Obnoxious about travelling, but a good friend. Plus, he’s bloody freaked about these UFOs. He’ll help us. I’ll call him.”
“Yep,” said Ron. He beamed at Harry and Harry hated him even more for being so ridiculously photogenic. What a twat. Maybe if Harry was that photogenic he could’ve found a nice bloke on his own by now. “But you know what’ll comfort me in the long, lonely nights I’ll spend with Hermione watching your suffering on our magicbox?”
Which was fair. Nothing that hellish was anticipatable.
How insightful they could be.
“Is it fair of you to ask Draco to stay in Britain when public opinion is holding back his career and making him unhappy?”
“Hugo was my fourth cousin,” Mrs Black said. “I was forced to marry my first cousin, Orion, when Hugo called off our wedding. He drove me
helps.”
Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy dating too many people over the years. Maybe he’d been with Pansy for a few months, and there was a period during fifth year when Harry would’ve sworn he’d seen Malfoy kissing Michael Corner after a Ravenclaw match, but Ron and Hermione hadn’t believed him. So Malfoy had been fairly single or fairly discreet over the years. He was fit from Quidditch and had legs for miles and Harry really didn’t think it was ‘fairly single’. Especially now that he was getting to know him.
“So she’s imagining it,” Harry surmised. “Is she okay…mentally?”
She considered this. “That would be an excellent form for a student so captivated with flying,” she decided. “Well, if this student should ever like to become an Animagus, and
Harry sighed, feeling profoundly frustrated. He felt like this was just going to make it all worse. Somehow. He didn’t know quite how yet, but he knew it would.
“What’s wrong with Ms Lovecraft and Professor Potter?” Draco asked.
She sneered at him. “Trying to make sure I don’t kill it?”
“Not at all,” Draco said. “They were one of only three advanced civilisations in existence at the time—the Mayans, the Celtics, and the Atlanteans. The Greeks didn’t develop control over magic for another three thousand years. And Atlantis had a much closer relationship with the foundations of the Universe than later civilisations did. Or do. Their magic was more elemental, and they had a connection to Time Magic that no civilisation has yet to rediscover.”
Some libel was to be expected in the wizarding world, Harry had come to accept.
“Thrilling,” Dean adds.
. We’ve got to figure out this spell and get Dud back.”
“How will you get to me in my sleep?” asked Harry with new interest. He was ignored.
“Well, yes, but I didn’t think you’d
“Mrs Dursley,” Malfoy said, “please speak plainly.”
He wishes that he could care more, but honestly, he really doesn’t have anything else to say. Not until Draco wakes up. He
Malfoy starts making breathy little whines and his thighs are trembling beneath the silk. He’s close. Very close. And Merlin, how is Harry ever going to dress the bloody ponce again after this?
He walked down to Slughorn’s with Hermione, who looked radiant but distracted in her scandalously low-cut green dress. It showed off her scar from Dolohov’s curse, and made her look dangerous and fierce and bloody hot all at once. Ron would be so miffed he missed this.
“I will tell you a story,” said Queen Sostrate, watching the house-elf pour three goblets of honey-water and place figs and cheese on golden plates.
They were called in alphabetical order again, which would have been fine if Harry wasn’t in the same group as Draco and Parkinson. He did his best not to let it affect him, but he could still see the look Draco wore in his mind’s eye, and it made him miss him desperately.
But he was pretty much on par now with the happiest he’d ever been, and…even if it sort of ached to look at Draco and not touch him, at least he got to look.
Malfoy scowled, shoved some toast in his mouth. “Yes.”
“Could you explain, Kaylen?” asked Padma.
Harry beamed, then bit his lip to try to tone it down, but it was no use. “Yeah?”
Seeing his expression shift to thoughtfulness as she made her points, she added, “Oh, please, Harry. Think of how fun it would be. Think of how
Kennedy gave them a pointed look. “Well, as you can see, they have. There were 804 souls on board, and not a one lived. No Magicals, so far as we know. This is the first incident that has claimed American lives, and we’re having a devil of a time keeping it out of the papers. The NoMajes believe it was a hurricane. There weren’t any storms in the area at the time. We had to alter a number of memories to get the media to report that Hurricane Hanna followed that path and was a Cat 5 at that longitude.”
This time, Snape couldn’t maintain the illusion of boredom. “An abduction attempt? Potter, you cannot—“
“Magical world,” Granger interjected.
Potter snorted.
Neville waved him off. “It’s like church for Muggles, only it happens every six weeks or so instead of every week. Our families are really religious – which is fairly unusual – and they dragged us along during hols. And when you’re underage, they get very boring because all you can do is sit at the kids table and play Snap while your family has fun getting toasted and sometimes naked.”
“Yes,” decided Weasley.
“I know,” Harry said, almost numbly. It was really working, and he had no idea how he’d come to deserve this, or when he’d become good enough to do it at all. When he’d approached Draco with the idea of working on Alchemy together, he’d never really thought they’d succeed. He’d never thought they’d even get to the first operation. It was, he could admit, just a desperate measure used to spend time with him.
muscles, Draco decided, as he reached another hand down to take hold of his balls, roll them gently in his palm.
Harry watched Draco. His breathing was slowing, but his eyes still looked wild, and Harry knew that the terror he showed was not even half of what he felt. Harry tightened his arms once, a hidden reminder that Draco was safe. Safer — which was “safe” in Harry’s world.
Harry rolls his eyes at him. “Don’t even,” he says. “She would destroy you.”
But then someone stepped out of the crowd of cloaks and smiled up at him. Eloise Midgen. She said, “Hello, Harry. Welcome to the Golden Cup.” She reached out for his hand, and on automatic, he took it. Hers was warm despite the chill of the night. Her brown eyes were soft like Hermione’s; it helped settle Harry’s nerves.

Mrs Granger had clear, dark skin and wore her hair in the same small French braids Granger had taken to wearing in recent years. She had a lovely, wide smile with gappy teeth, but it was Mr Granger who’d obviously contributed his blood to Granger’s own…sturdily sized teeth.
It was not until early December that they realised their mistake.
“Oh my god,” Michael said, rushing off to Luna. Harry was glad he was so grossed out by the caterpillar that he hadn’t tried to do the same thing.
“Are Malfoy and his mum okay with the

, but his heart’s not into it and he gives it up to stare at his ceiling. His stomach still feels weird, but only, strangely, when he’s thinking about the Partner-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.
“People disgust me,” said Daphne, and then proceeded to look out the window and ignore the class. Apparently that statement was meant for all people, and not just Muggles. At least she wasn’t prejudiced, Harry thought.
They headed to Flourish and Blotts without requiring any discussion, but the shop was huge, endlessly filled with books and people, and one step inside the door had them both quickly backtracking. “Maybe we shouldn’t get her a book this year,” Ron suggested.
“All but the Gryffindors,” said Harry, frowning. The little bastards always played fast and loose with him, thinking he’d go easy on students in his old house. They were always disappointed.
“I’ll have that,” Lee said.
Teddy nodded. “What’s wrong with you, then?”
It seemed to last forever, and Malfoy didn’t stop suckling him until the sensation was almost too much to bear. Harry fell back against the bed and Malfoy crawled up his body, kneeling on either side of his shoulders. He pulled Harry’s face up by the back of his neck and fed him his cock and Harry wrapped his lips around it eagerly, his eyes meeting Malfoy’s as he sucked and swallowed around him. Malfoy was staring right at him, fucking his mouth with deep strokes of his hips. Harry reached up and fondled his balls, sucking hard, and Malfoy gasped, spilling hot ropes of come straight down Harry’s throat.
“It’ll be the fact that I’ll be too busy laughing my arse off over how fucking hilarious this is going to be.”
Considerably less dignified, Harry stumbled out after him – after taking a moment to adjust himself. The thought of his face in Draco’s arse had been more appealing than he would’ve liked. Crushes were one thing – a thing Harry could deal with. But it had to stay there, a crush. This one still wasn't cooperating.
Draco was too stunned to even be horrified by it.
“Merlin,” Draco said to the sky. “I beg you. Save me. I promise to be good.”
~The End~
“I beg your pardon?” she said, startled.
“You’re going to Hogwarts!” he agreed, snatching her up and spinning her around before depositing her, dizzy, back on the ground. He gave Ron and Hermione a sideways smile, and then stepped back to chat with Ron while Hermione read Rosie a list of requirements for her first year at Hogwarts, to include studying hard, not taking any nonsense from boys or other girls, being respectful to all of her professors, thinking for herself, and being sure to write.
On Sunday, Hermione and Millicent followed them to the Broomsticks for Fantasy Quidditch because they were, as Hermione put it, bored. It was Draco’s turn to buy drinks—finally. He returned to their table and passed drinks around, but when Harry sipped his, his eyebrows shot up in surprise.
no truth but our own reality. The Department has taught us that.”
In truth, Harry was fairly well versed, too. His mother had used one for him, after all, and there had been a time, some years back, when he’d wanted to know all he could about that.

before I go under, and then when I move into visualisation, feel how it feels for me. But for Merlin’s sake, don’t run off because mine feels restless, too. You might take my mind with you.”
said Addolgar, finally turning to look at him.
He tried his best to broadcast the feeling of sprouting feathers and growing a beak to Draco, hoping that he would be able to translate that into fur and tail.
“Potter,” Malfoy says quietly. Not even angrily, like Harry had half-expected. “What are you doing here?”
Harry sighed. “I know. But it has. And we need to help him.”
That…was not what he’d expected to hear. Nor what he wanted to hear. Draco didn’t need him. Never
Madam Pomfrey rushed around their privacy curtain then, before Harry could fully process this, coming to an abrupt stop before their beds.
, Harry tells him.
Draco smirked, but said nothing.
“Potter.” Draco kicked his shin a bit. Harry scowled. “You had a look on your face I haven’t seen since summer holidays after third year.”
Another heavy pause. “Yes.”
He jumped into the nearest hot tub and Zeph and Hermione followed him in. The other men, trailing in from the changing rooms joined soon after. Luna levitated in a box of tequila, limes, salt, and a very fruity-looking mix to the side of the hot tub. “Margaritas, boys?”
“She fainted,” Harry said.
“May I borrow your potions kit?” This time, the voice came from directly behind him. Harry tensed in his mashing, but dutifully sent the kit floating back to Draco.
Draco smirked, and there was a new spring in his step as Kyle led them to their bedroom for the duration. When they were alone, Harry set his backpack on the bed and turned to face Draco.
Hermione’s foot catches against Harry’s own, and he looks over from his perusal of the tablecloth to find her fighting a smile. She leans into his shoulder and whispers, “Ron says you’re Malfoy’s Mate.”
The capital city had a number of well-manicured Salukis trotting about, seemingly unattended, going about their own daily errands. As they passed into the city proper, via a tidy, stone-paved road, Draco took note of the city’s layout. It was just like the stories had said: a huge, wondrous city spread between concentric rings of land, then rings of canals, then more rings of land.
There was a further silence, and then, so quiet Harry almost didn’t hear it, Malfoy said, “Okay. Yes.”
“They went sprawling across the floor when the last of his magic came back,” said Ron. “It was pretty forceful.”
“Was it really important?” Harry asked. “I mean, I like women, too. I’d still try with Ginny if she wanted to, but she’s all over Zabini now. It’s only been three weeks!”

On and on they went. They all saw it. Every Muggle in the world—or at least the ones who’d managed to get outside.
“Yeah, me too,” Harry said. “He didn’t get it from me, that’s for sure.”

“And the unhappy ones, too,” Neville said. “Magic might make them happy.”
She was tall, very thin, and very pale, with black eyes and very straight black hair, cut in a chic lob against her sharp shoulders. In sharp contrast to Kyle, she was wearing all black—soft-looking suede flats and a sleeveless black knee-length dress with a wide-belted waist.
Harry kissed him.
“Alright, Malfoy?” Potter asked, sounding a little dazed. He ran a hand through his hair and it really didn’t help at all. Potter was a walking cliché of bedhead.
Harry hopped out of bed, causing Ms Danger to grumble and burrow into the warm spot he’d left behind. He gave her a fond, unseen smile, pulled on his dressing gown and slippers, and quietly left his suite.
The cat turned to Draco, staring at him dourly through her big, black-rimmed eyes. Harry rubbed her tummy and she made a rumbly noise. “She’s a squib.” And before Draco could comment on that, “And she’s great.”
Minister Murdoch was trying to look busy. He had his head bent over a stack of papers, his brow furrowed as if in deep thought. Harry called bullshit on that. When Harry was seated, Ron and his partner standing close behind his back in case he made a run for it, and the office door shut, Murdoch looked up. As though he’d just noticed their entry.
When Malfoy comes back, he’s alone and his mouth is pressed tightly together. All he says is, “You need to go, Potter.”
“What kind of not-right?” Ron asks, finally settling onto his knees and leaning in closer to the Floo. Ron’s always trusted Harry’s instincts on things like this, and as a fellow explosives Auror, he knows exactly how wrong things can go when Aurors who aren’t trained for them try to deal with explosion spells.
“Why not?”
“Muggles are going wild,” Pansy said, delighted. “Have you heard of the internet? It’s like having a conversation with a lot of people at a cocktail party all at once.”
Padma repeated these words exactly. Then they let go of their own wands, tapped their new wands together once, and the Protego fell.
Queen Sostrate looked at him curiously. “Yes, is that uncommon?”
, remained unspoken. Harry beamed at him, trying to remember if this had been his idea or if he’d been Confunded. At least he wouldn’t have to be an Auror. Even being forced to spend time with Snape’s portrait sounded better than that. After all, he could wash his hands of Snape after three years, but he’d be an Auror forever.
“I’ve always wanted to be in the same house as you, Harry,” said Luna, taking Hannah’s abandoned seat. Poor Hannah had ended up in Slytherin, as did Susan Bones. It was highly suspicious.
, but it wasn’t on the table before him. It was, in fact, still in the harness in his sleeve. He pulled it out, stared at it dumbly. “I don’t remember putting my wand away.”
, he thinks, uncharitably.
“Not as yet,” Kurzschluss admitted.
, Harry thought. Sometimes he forgot that teachers even
“Scorpius!”
“Morning, Harry,” said Ruby, his voice deep and rumbling. Harry glanced at him and his stomach flipped. Merlin, what a man, what a man. His eyes travelled over Ruby, taking in the thick hair covering his muscular chest and stomach. He was stocky, strong-looking, not too tall, but everything about him screamed
And then Draco activated the compass, returning them to the original leypoint, where Narcissa and the others would no doubt already be waiting. Harry’s body twisted into nothingness while his love for Draco spun out to fill the entire universe.
Malfoy didn’t put his head in the sand. He saw the spaceship and he acted. He didn’t hope it would go away. He didn’t pretend it’d never been.
Instead, he very calmly said, “No, Scorpius.”
She laughed. “Not close enough. Not nearly close enough, but they’re going to try it in a week, anyway. The rest of you will be invited to that ICW meeting, I’m sure.”
“Ale, for the love of Mer—God,” Lee said.
By the end of April, just as the panic of NEWTs was really mounting, Harry’s potion work was further along than even he could have hoped, but Draco’s Animagus was still elusive. He had to be something twitchy, like a fox. Merlin, Harry hoped it wasn’t a ferret. If it was, maybe Draco was blocking it out, out of shame.
Malfoy stood. “I don’t need to be
!” he yelled.
Outside, a woman screams, and Harry makes the mistake of turning to see what’s wrong. Nothing’s wrong, as it happens. He’s just been spotted again. It’s always bad during Fashion Week. Everyone wants to be a model. He doesn’t
“You needn’t speak as though I can’t hear you,” Elias said.
He scrunched his nose. “A really good tutor maybe?” Slughorn was difficult to digest in large doses. It was exhausting to be around him.
“You like my name?” Harry asked, before Malfoy could insult anyone else.
They set Teddy up at the worktable in their office, where he immediately started in on his homework. Harry and Draco shared a look of dismay.
“I even had to bring my mother,” he continued, hands extended towards her like a product model on a Muggle telly show. “No one’s mother should be forced to travel to the United States.”
Addolgar gave him a patient look, and then an impatient one. He sighed. “Harry, what do you think happens when hydrocarbon gases like methane from rotting Muggle waste mix with plastics, like polypropylene, which is liable to chain degradation in heat and UV radiation, like the kind that comes from the Sun?”
He was ignored.
“Your Majesty,” he said, leaning forward as Potter had done. “I can’t speak for the rest of my countrymen, but I can tell you I will stop at nothing to protect my son from these…these beings. Creators or not, they won’t be his destruction. I will find a way to keep them away from him, and gods take my magic if necessary. I will make our world safe for him, but it would be a lot easier if you gave us a place to start.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Anyway,” he said.
transform disease into health. Merlin, what a mess.
Malfoy looks at him, amused. “I think most of us do, Potter.”
Hermione looked sad. “Harry, I know you said you were ‘emigrating’ but you know that doesn’t have to be true. We
Or was it just as hard to forget it and move on? Sometimes Harry, when he woke up screaming and terrified from nightmares of Snatchers and huge snakes, would wonder if he could ever move on completely. And he wondered if Malfoy was able to ignore all that, if he didn’t have nightmares. Or maybe he did, but he refused to acknowledge that they were significant. Maybe he was still able to live his life anyway.
“Real estate,” Quincy spoke up. “They all invest in real estate. Hotels and the like.”
She took off for Petunia’s house, Harry and Malfoy following invisibly behind. The house was pretty—a small white and blue cottage with pink and coral ranunculus everywhere. Sunflowers popped up from among them.
“It gets a bit wonky at the school,” Dudley said, as his thumbs tapped against the glass picture. “But Harry rigged it to mostly work around magic. Let me just…one sec.”
Wordlessly, Draco reached up and plucked out a single hair. He handed it to Harry. Finally, Harry broke eye contact to turn and arrange everything in the cauldron. It was hot enough now that he could add the wine, and did so. All three bottles of it went in, followed by the one of rectified spirits, then the stone, and then the galleon, representing worthlessness, followed. Finally, he added one cup of dried sacred herbs, including mistletoe from the Weasleys’ kitchen door, to encourage the putrefaction process. They watched silently as the wine heated up and began to decay the coin, fermenting it and the herbs like it had once been fermented itself.
It was weird sitting here with Malfoy on the first day of his first term at Hogwarts, chatting about the impending doom of all magical cultures. But no one else wanted to chat about it. People were tense, but no one, Harry could tell, had the same sense of eeriness that he did. No one else felt like all of their futures were unraveling all at once, and even the Oracle Cassandra wouldn’t be able to find them a path forward again. No one else but Malfoy.

could do better than two weeks. The reality that he’d just been kissed by Draco Malfoy – and kissed him back – in front of the majority of his House was beginning to set in.
Malfoy pushed his book aside. “What’s your form?”
“How could I hardly notice? I’ll never be able to stop thinking about it now!”
Draco smirked. “Next time, don’t fall. Now turn around and let me
Harry looked to Hermione and Lee. Hermione returned his look with a clear signal that he wasn’t yet forgiven. “Shall we get them in before reporters are tracking our every move?”
Malfoy managed to get Petunia
“Just rain,” said Harry. He was leant back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest. Honestly, the sooner he could get away from this sleazy, sneaky, thievish—
“And dark lord-killing,” said Draco. He paused. “And wandless magic.”
“I despise that name,” Malfoy muttered.
Harry was unsure of what to say. He settled on, “Malfoy, are you aware of the term ‘schadenfreude’?”
Boot grinned, and it was such a nice, happy grin than it made Harry’s mouth curve up as well. God, he hated Boot. Hated how happy and together he was. And he also thought he was an alright chap and they probably would’ve been friends if Harry wasn’t trending towards basketcasedom these days.
“I think you will find, madam,” the Queen said lowly, “that not only can I do that, I can also order executions. My patience is long, but you have worn it away like the tide. Leave,
Hermione dropped her quill, and purple ink began to drool out onto her notes. She noticed and cast a hasty spell before all her pages were ruined. “Harry—are you out of your mind?”
Harry laughed. “How did you become such a twat, Malfoy? Was it natural or?”
“Did you decide on what you wanted for your first date or do you want me and Dennis to pick?”
Malfoy hmm’d. “It takes a lot of honesty to see yourself how you truly are. I suppose most of us don’t really understand why we were re-sorted.”
“He is a bit tidy,” Harry admits. But it’s only at the office. At home…
“Is it because it’s a metamorphic rock?” asked Harry. “You said they were, that day. It likes to change, doesn’t it?”
Malfoy picks it up, laughing at the tag, and unwraps it without any of his normal fanfare. Harry’s just as intrigued at what’s inside as Malfoy is, though he pretends like he’s not. After five years an Auror and another three in the Academy, he knows how to do subtly now. Malfoy pulls out a pair of wayfarer sunglasses with a note from Harry’s Ministry-issued stationery spellotaped to one of the lenses. Malfoy reads it aloud:
“I would like to join you for that,” Narcissa said primly. “I’m sure I can offer something to help.”
He felt cold. Draco refreshed his warming charm for him, and Harry sent him a grateful look. “I think I’m figuring it out now,” Harry finally said. “Yes, I had that problem, too.”
Finally, Queen Sostrate sighed. She turned away from her window, backlit like magic itself. “I see and understand your point,” she said again, nodding graciously to Draco.
He put an order in for ten each of them through the magical counterpart of Foyles, which had a location on Charing Cross Road near to the Leaky Cauldron. They came on Tuesday, along with Justin’s wholesale order of Basic Blaze Boxes from Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, and were immediately checked out by the seventh and eighth years. A few industrious sixth years managed to grab a copy before they ran out.
Slowly, he lowers his face to Draco’s, watching for the denial, smelling warm whiskey and exhaustion with each of Draco’s rapid breaths. Their lips touch and the sound that comes out of Harry’s throat is frighteningly new to him, earsplitting in its existence, not its volume. All at once, Draco’s arms come up around him and his body surges up against Harry’s and there’s nothing in the world more meaningful than the process beginning between them.
“We’re
Petunia curled her lip. “You should kill it. I’m nearly certain they have some kind of…tracking technology. And they may not have magic, but they have technology that’s near enough to it. You saw it, didn’t you?” she asked Millicent.
They walked out to the pitch without speaking. It wasn’t entirely uncomfortable, either. Who would’ve guessed they could walk so far without sniping at one another without the excuse of light alcohol and Hufflepuff friendliness?
Draco sneered, shifting his carry-with bag on his shoulder. Harry had a backpack instead, as he was also carrying a ten-gallon tank of saltwater, pink gravel, and unimpressed seahorse.
Merlin, the water was perfect. Warm and swishy and better than even the Prefects’ Bath at Hogwarts. They should do this more often, when they weren’t on the hunt for immortal jellyfishes. Harry dove down, using his spare wand for extra light, even though the water was clear and it wasn’t very deep here. He’d learned to keep his normal one strapped in tight on these sorts of adventures after a close encounter with a hag who’d kept herself alive for sixteen-hundred years eating only goat kids.
“Hermione!” Mrs Weasley said, coming in. “I just heard the most unladylike things coming from your mouth, young miss! What’s got into you!”
“We have to protect them,” Harry said. “We’ll be criminals at worst, pariahs at best.”
Harry grimaced. “Well, I guess Titus might build something related to London, or having a good time. And Zeph might…well I rather suspect he might build something that can’t be shown to viewers beneath the age of seventeen.”
, but it didn’t inspire in him any profound methods of subject change. “It’s just—I was reminded of how transitory things are sometimes. How you can look at…something, and everything feels right, and then it occurs to you that it’s gone, or it was never there.”
Lee and Hermione looked at one another. Hermione nervously pushed her hair behind one brown ear. She cleared her throat. “I think we can do it, Harry. Magic can do a lot that Muggles can’t.”
Sephora hummed an acknowledgement, ignoring him in favour of a stack of surveys Human Resources had sent down for the annual self-evaluations. She made an awful face at the parchments and Harry knew he’d get no more out of her. He continued on to his office, and spelled the door unlocked. Draco was usually in first, and their office felt cold and abnormally still without him.
Harry smirked at Ron. “I made you one, too, remember? Let’s sit down and have a nice, long catch-up before you take my beloved goddaughter away from me.”
“All right, let’s go.”
, because I was excited. It won’t happen again.”
He runs his hand through his hair, agitated, and then half-turns before squeezing his eyes closed briefly, as if warding off a headache. He turns back only enough to say, “You want some tea, Potter? I’m going to make some tea.”
Dudley shrugged. “She said something super strange when I rang the other day. Said she finally remembered.”
“Malfoy, that’s—” Harry began, eyes narrowed.
“It would help to know what we’re trying to
“Oh, I will,” Malfoy said.
He could practically feel the Hat’s shrug.
Harry nodded, though Draco wouldn’t be able to see it from this angle. “How do we separate it from the quartz?”
He watched Hermione scroll through her newspaper for a while, sipping his coffee and trying to remember how to be human.
Draco smiles at him, casts a
“I passed the last character assessment on Friday,” Ron was saying, a fork of Christmas goose poised halfway to his mouth. “Can you believe it? I'm a real Auror trainee now! Just two years to go. The class is pretty small actually, you’d never think so with it being such a brill job, but…”
Harry finds he’s enjoying the roasted larvae so much, and the night is so nice, that he decides to bypass his hotel and walk around a bit more, see the city. He pulls out the next stick and, ah, here’s the famous roasted mantis. Smells a bit saffrony, which Harry approves of. He bites off the first one and crunches on it as he walks along the coast. The Mediterranean is beautiful and the weather is still warm enough that the light breeze coming in from the water feels good as it flows over his black uniform shirt and trousers.
Malfoy’s fingernails grazed his skin above his waistband. He may’ve died. He wasn’t sure.
“Who was it designed for then?”
Potter sat across from him, standing Severus’s gilt-framed travel portrait up with a perfect view that, as a benefit, obstructed the face of the very short Ministry witch. The same one who’d glared at them in the lobby
“They have a kinship,” Draco whispered to him as the wine was served. Ron and Zabini were currently discussing an essay they were working on for Divination. Together. “The only two of their kind.”
It’s opened by Malfoy, looking tanned and sleep-rumpled in a pair of pyjama bottoms and nothing else, save for the hipster glasses on his nose. He blinks a few times, then his eyes go wide. “Potter?”
Men with happy laughs and strong spells, who understood family always came first and would never let Draco down. Draco felt himself sliding down, his skin dragging slick and wet down the tile. It was too much, too much sensation to experience; his thighs were giving out. His arse touched the tile of the shower and he curled further, the new angle allowing him to press two fingers into that perfect spot and his vision sparked with the pleasure of it. He bit his lip, his breath coming out in fast, little moans, as if in sync with his strokes.
“Now, I’ll share it on reddit and a few social media channels,” Petunia said, “and we’ll hope it gets picked up soon. We want it to go viral—and it very well may if the right people with the right followers see it. The media have been following my accounts since I was exposed, and they might be interested in sharing it.”
Hermione looked miserable. “I don’t know. Maybe. The article said that these aurora things have been showing up all over. I need to go to London and pull the last few weeks of all the major UK newspapers. Maybe do some more magic readings, to see what the status is around these sites. I’ll see what I can find.”
Harry laughed. “Thought you got over camping in seventh year.”
“I haven’t had my grilled cheese yet!” she said.
Draco huffs out a laugh. “I know you’ll be delighted to tell my father, though.”
Draco frowned, nodded. They would just have to figure it out themselves. That would come in time. For now, they needed the spell—they needed a place to start.
He wasn’t afraid of his emotions. He was afraid of Draco’s. That’s how those-people were: they hid everything, even from themselves sometimes.
He was devastated by this new understanding, but it was a dull sort of devastation, the kind that came with a terrible news that’d happened too long ago to still be fresh. Had he always, somehow, known this?
Sostrate tilted her head. “The easel just there.”
Harry slashes his wand and a bright blue hex whips towards Ron, catching him on the shoulder. Ron grunts as his blood drips black down his bicep, but doesn’t slow. “Not enough,” Ron says, and knocks him back, his head ringing. “You got me where I needed to be for Hermione. I’ll get you there, too, mate. Stop—holding—back!” And then he swings out in an arch and a wall of flame soars right to Harry; he slides to the side but not quick enough.
“Splendid,” said Rosie. “Mum got me a new astronomy set—the one I’ve been wanting that has a mini black hole that really eats objects that come near it.”
quite Gryffindor,” Nott observed, staring round the spa and the gold-and-red decor he and Hermione had installed that afternoon.
Inside, there were about two litres of pure, crystal clear water. No aqua fortis at all. “Holy shit.”
He was ready to find the right man for him and take him home to London.
Harry winced. “No.”
They travelled the length of the corridor and paused by a stack of barrels where the pair of prefects hesitated again.
Ron didn’t seem to mind. He gazed at her adoringly when she wasn’t looking, and when she smiled at him, her cheeks dimpled only on one side.
“Potter, none of those words sounded like food words.”
The translation spell was like a tension-headache building, but he couldn’t even bring himself to care. He felt like he would burst with childish exuberance, and wished, for a brief moment, that Scorpius could’ve seen this, too.
Harry shrugged. There was an illicit sort of thrill to leaving Hogsmeade during school. Students weren’t allowed to do that, but technically, they were of age and could do whatever they wanted. So long as McGonagall never found out.
“Potter!” Draco says. “Last night, you—?”
Madam Pince gave him a tight smile as he neared her desk and he returned it.
He tugged Harry’s swim trunks up and then his own before swimming over to the ladder and pulling himself onto the boat with unparalleled dignity. Face red—and not for lack of a Suntan Solution—Harry followed. He tried to exude some dignity of his own, but it was hard to do when one had just got off spectacularly while being fondled by sea creatures.
Snape turned to him, lifted an eyebrow. “And I need a body that feels inebriation, but life—and death—remain unfair, a lesson I regret I never managed to instil in you.”
