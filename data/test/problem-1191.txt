“How can I understand you?” Draco asked, tearing his eyes away from the sky, from the spot the animal left in its wake.
It all happened so fast, Draco barely even noticed when his fingers loosened, and the wand slipped from his hand, silently falling to the grass at the same time as Berenice’s knees faltered.
He shook his head, scrambling for his coolest tone. “Not so good, I must say, if it took you three hours to get here.”
As he had learned after the episode with the girl; in the past, hunters killed Sacis to get the mushroom, in order to produce the exact type of potion that was dark enough to need a sacrifice to be made and to function. The whole thing was disgusting. However, now that Draco understood it, he could do something regarding the treatment. He hadn’t found a cure for those afflicted by it, but he believed it was only a matter of time.
The force of the waterfall, even if it was so very far from them, still sprayed water in their direction, ensuring a brief reprieve from the warmth. It was not enough to quench the searing burn of the sun on their skin.
And although he was sure the guarana fruit—the magical variant he had to get his hands on—was responsible for one of these effects, Draco still had no clue which symptom it caused and how to find the other ingredient.
“Did it?” Draco took his cup, letting the steam melt a bit of all the cooling charms the house held inside.
“You don’t have to. I haven’t changed my mind, you know. I’m not going to,” Draco said, mouth coming to rest on Harry’s forehead. “I love you, and I’m staying here.”
in an indigenous language, I’m not sure which. There are a lot. Maybe Tupi.” He shrugged sheepishly.
“Oh no. I was passing by when I saw you coming out of the woods,” José said, watching Machado take off from his shoulder and disappear with others like him in the sky. “You’re very comfortable now, right?”
Harry lifted his head, dropping the last of his outfit on the grass, left wearing only his glasses. “Isn’t it obvious? We’re going to swim. The water is great here.”
Draco heaved a sigh, trying to tune out Francisca’s continuous rambles about Caipora, the way she was clearly ignoring Draco’s internal debacle.
“No, Potter, I haven’t seen the woman. I don’t go around fraternising with your Gryffindor friends or your exes for a hobby.”
Saci laughed, then, hands dangling at his sides. “Ye see, that’s what happens when ye’re curious. The night escaped. The girl had to find a way to separate night from day.
Draco had never meant to hurt Harry by coming here. He didn’t even know Harry was living in Brazil. And Harry knew Draco was coming, Harry had wanted Draco to come. He had opened up to Draco willingly, showing a side of him he had never shown before. Harry had given himself to Draco, and Draco had made a silent vow of protecting him, but now…
Harry’s hair was shorter at the sides and back, but still as messy as a lion’s mane on top as it used to be. His skin had gained an even darker tan, and the bird tattoos he was cultivating close to his collarbone had now become two full sleeves of shapes and colours Draco couldn’t tell them apart for the life of him. Harry was still shorter than him, as expected, but his slim build had gained a more muscular shape, framed by dark jeans and a brown short-sleeved shirt. But even though his face had got older, and he was wearing frames more modern than Draco'd ever seen him using, those green eyes still shone as bright as the sun.
Harry dared to smile at Draco, a relaxed grin shaped by dark stubble, as if no time had passed at all. As if he was happy to see Draco.
Potter guided him to a table with the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Fernando. They engaged in a delightful conversation about the species the school held in the Dark Greenhouse, as Draco tried to make out what was the light, strongly scented glob on his plate—
A dry laugh escaped Draco’s lips, even as tears streamed down his face. “It’s okay. It’ll heal,” he whispered, lips locking with Harry’s; then Harry’s cheeks, his eyelids, his nose. “Better than breaking my heart a third time.”
Draco found Tainara later that day, and she seemed to be the only one happy. Not about the infinite sun, he gathered, but happy nonetheless. Lighter, more so than any other person on the school grounds.
That night—even if the sun was so hot it felt like midday—Draco was determined to put an end to it. Either he and Harry would reach some kind of compromise, or he’d leave Harry for good.
"Rio’s samba schools are sophisticated facilities that have turned into arenas of enormous floats, flashy costumes, and uplifting dance moves in the period of the Rio festival.
She kept pressing, as though no reaction had been exhibited by them. “Sorry, my English is not so good. Harry is helping me with it. I’m Tainara. You can call me Tai.”
Draco would not excuse himself for that. Even if it meant acknowledging that he had to pick his jaw from the floor
Draco raised an eyebrow, trying to meet Harry’s eyes, and finding it hard when Harry kept glancing at everything in the kitchen but him. “And how do you know that?”
The barn where Draco had first met the professor came into view again, along the green horizon stretching lazily in the landscape. Chica guided their stroll past the structure and into the forest, stopping only when a distinguished line of thick trees separated it from the grass.
Harry didn’t answer, instead hiding his mouth behind his own mug. They stayed silent for quite a while, before Harry sighed and his eyes finally met Draco’s. They were heavy, darker than Draco had ever seen. “Why did you do it?”
The macaw didn’t go looking for Potter, though. It kept biting his hair, ear and clothes until Draco was on his feet. And then started flapping its wings anxiously around him. Draco took it as a cue to follow the animal to wherever it wanted to go.
Draco couldn’t figure out what it was before the blinding gleam of the golden stones of the main building of Castelobruxo claimed his attention. It was an exuberant structure, but he noticed its beauty was more prominent from afar, rather than from the oppressing closeness in which he found himself now.
Potter smiled fondly at the girl and turned to Draco. “Tai is always here, just not… as a formal student.”
Draco’s face turned three shades redder. The urge to scream some truths into Potter’s face was hard to control. He did, though, spit through gritted teeth, “What. Does. It. Mean?”
Draco didn’t ask what the place was. Potter said nothing, sauntering towards the structure without a glance back.
Francisca and José, who had been talking excitedly to them about this Caipora figure for the best part of the last hour—
he convinced himself. It would, as long as Draco kept Potter in a separate space of his mind from the one he had occupied in the past. Thinking of Potter as the man he had—possibly always—loved wouldn’t do him any favours. Draco had to focus on the things he would accomplish once his research was done, and on going back home.
,” she muttered to herself, absent-minded. “Inca! That’s it. And some other people. They all decided this school would be for every wizard in Latin America and changed the name to Castelobruxo. And build a golden castle. I don’t like it a lot.”
His face burned with embarrassment, and Draco inhaled deeply as he tried to smooth his incredulous laughter into a softer smile. “You know what. This argument is going nowhere. Unlike you, I do not find it enjoyable to waste time talking about things that have little importance, after waiting three bloody hours for someone to pick me up. Of course you would mess this up.” Draco rolled his eyes. “I’m not going anywhere with you. Go back to Castelobruxo and ask them to send someone more suitable to fetch me. I don’t mind waiting a few more minutes. Thank you very much.” He fixed his eyes on Harry’s, despite the man’s first attempt of avoiding the stare. It felt like a challenge, and Draco wouldn’t break eye contact first, he would not lose. He had already lost too much.
“See there?” Tainara took him out of his reveries, pointing at a small group of people dancing around the fire. “It’s called ‘Dance of the Fire.’”
There was a tightness to his chest that wasn’t there before, and in his distant dazedness Draco barely realised he was… heavier.
They did. Draco drew his wand, chanting in an indistinct murmur. At the same time, Francisca used her own wandless magic to cover them in a soft hum of protection.
Draco yelled, too far gone by anger to be afraid of their retaliation, “Merlin’s balls! Harry Potter was bloody touched by the ultimate darkness and you didn’t even consider him before?!”
. He couldn’t even tell how long he had been running. It felt like hours, days. It felt like he had been running for his entire life.
The car turned left, alarmingly close to hitting a tree. Draco held the windowsill, trying to focus on his breathing for now. Surely Potter knew what he was doing.
Potter only seemed to notice his quietness when Draco remained silent throughout an entire episode of
Tainara finally explained what the paintings adorning her face meant; indigenous people used those symbols to protect them, physically and spiritually.
. Not from Martin, not from anything. Draco went because of his research. Why did people keep assuming there was another reason behind it?
Draco could bite the bait for now, let the absence of an answer slide as he distracted himself by talking about his work. It was fine as long as Draco was willingly and consciously going into Potter’s game, he convinced himself, ignoring the flush spreading on his damp neck, purely from the fact that Harry knew what he was doing here.
Draco didn’t want to know what the bloody hell was Tree Com for now—his resentful brain was already busy wondering how fast Potter had learnt it all so that he could beat him somehow—so he went for a subject that presented less of a chance of a meltdown. “Does everybody here perform wandless magic?” Because, again, he hadn’t seen a wand on Francisca.
“You’re not running from me! We need to talk!” Draco yelled into the forest, but his only answer was another set of leaves rustling above him, a roar by his side. There was no one there, Draco convinced himself. It was all Curupira’s deeds. The creature was creating those noises, playing with his mind. He had to be. “Those tricks will not scare me! I’m not leaving until we talk!”
Potter’s eyes widened a bit—in shock or surprise, Draco couldn’t tell; maybe both—at Draco’s, or rather, Tai’s, idea. “How did I not think of that before?”
That morning, when Draco came out of the forest, Machado faithfully perched on his shoulder, he was graced with José’s wide grin right at the edge of the Living Section. The parrot mellowed to José’s touch, trading Draco’s shoulder for his and making Draco wonder where the animal’s loyalty truly lay.
, Potter had said again—and plenty of new sets of clothes for him. Those were mostly jeans, simple shirts, a few Muggle suits, and a couple of sneakers.
Berenice’s voice was not loud, but it echoed through as if inside Draco’s head. She was doing it again; she was trying to hypnotise Harry, the same way she had done to Draco to calm him down. If those creatures were as powerful as Tainara had led him to believe during all these months, Berenice might actually succeed at freeing Harry from the girl’s control.
“Nice to meet you,” he said as politely as he could. Curiosity nibbled his insides before he turned back to Potter. “What do you mean Local Creature?”
Draco was there because of something important. If they couldn’t see Draco’s research was a perfectly valid reason for using their resources, it was their loss. That seed was calling to him, and it held some of the mystery regarding the ingredients he needed. He just knew it.
But Draco couldn’t really be mad at Potter’s excitement. After all, Draco was, truly, great company, and Potter should feel honoured that Draco even considered talking to him again after everything.
Draco almost fell out of his bench—though it was really only another part of the giant’s tree’s root. “Potter, if you’re trying to kill me, I can suggest smarter ways.”
He was getting used to this routine. He would drive to the school with Harry in the morning and then he would just roam around Homunin listlessly. Draco would usually meet Saci or Tainara right away, read some books, and then look for Harry again when he knew the classes were over—he had memorised Harry’s entire schedule by now.
Caipora asked, her sentence flexing in a question by the end, Draco noticed. Her voice a low growling sound near Lua.
To capture a Saci, one must throw a sieve at his wind swirl (what he uses to run around), then taking off his cap and trapping him in a bottle.
He hesitated, hand hovering over Potter’s forearm, before resting loose fingers on warm skin—Potter’d always been hotter than anyone else—noticing distantly a lack of wand.
Harry’s mouth made an “O” shape, and he tapped three fingers on the table before getting up. “That makes sense,” Harry said, filling the kettle and putting it on the fire, still with his back to Draco. “It’s not a drug. It’s—Er, a psychedelic tea. Kind of. It induces changes in perception, consciousness. It’s used by indigenous shamans for reaching the spiritual state of the conscience.”
“How many people did you tell I was coming, Potter?” Draco asked, after a third group of students interrupted their journey again.
Draco wondered how much of the tale was true. He took in the Headteacher’s appearance with fresh eyes. She didn’t look like a mermaid. But she did seem strong and Draco didn’t doubt Berenice could take him down any day.
The promise could not be fulfilled, naturally, since the school didn’t agree with them about Draco seeing the restricted section.
Draco knew he would be accepted even if they hadn’t done that. However, it was a good feeling knowing there would never be another one like him, rejected and judged by a past that didn’t represent who he was anymore.
Curupira left so quickly, Draco’s mind almost didn’t process his absence. The fire of the challenge burned in his body, prompting Draco to action when he wasn’t really sure he should take any. He was already on his heels, startled into following the boy’s footsteps, as Francisca’s screams faded in the distance.
The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas (1881) is a classic book by Brazilian author Machado de Assis and it has such a unique narrative and avant-garde style that it's considered, to this day, a masterpiece.
He took a step forward, trying not to dwell on the fact that he was alone there, exposed to that growing darkness.
There was no flavour that he could distinguish apart from the strong tang of alcohol. The liquid burnt his throat all the way down, leaving Draco with a coughing fit for at least a minute, while Potter laughed humorously.
Draco stared at him askance, before directing his attention to the task at hand and pretending he didn’t hear the teasing in Potter’s tone. It couldn’t be real. It had to be some kind of morning indisposition, because there was absolutely no way Potter had just flirted with him. Not that Draco wasn’t flirting material. Potter was just seven years late. “One would expect Harry Potter’s snake to slither its way into my bed at night. Actually, in retrospect, it reminds me of one occasion when—”
He ran outside, Machado following suit, too jittery to stay still. The Jeep should still be there, parked under a tree, exactly how he had left it the last time it was used.
What did he have to do with Caipora losing her shit around the forest? If he had to spend another day in the woods for the rest of his life, it’d be too much. Draco was becoming tired of it all. Not being accepted by the fucking network, these creatures—whatever they were—doubting him, the mistrust, suspicion, all when he had not even been there for three days.
Draco didn’t, as well, but he was too baffled by the new wave of information to care about her opinions. “You mean,
“Hey,” Potter spoke softly, resting a reassuring hand on his forearm. Draco almost shook him away, but panic kept him frozen in place. “Don’t worry, you can come back, just not… stay on the grounds for long periods of time.”
They also had no idea of how old Lua was. One book had told them that a new Cuca was born out of an egg to take the place of the previous one at each thousand years. They had no way of knowing if that was true, so the information turned out to be ineffective. Another one said a Cuca could morph into the shape of animals, like owls, moths or a dragon. Draco could only hope Lua wouldn’t turn into a dragon in front of him. She already looked too much like one without the proper scales. There was, yet, one book that said a Cuca could control the minds of their victims, their memories and their sleep, which left Draco practicing his Occlumency for an entire day after that.
Harry visibly flinched back at Draco’s remark, and Draco had a hard time remembering what had been so appealing about riling each other up in the past. It was, at least, more comfortable than the memories of naked bodies trembling in the darkness, grasping each other in order not to fall apart from the war’s recent wounds.
“I swear to God, Potter if you…” Draco started looking around, and his eyes soon caught sight of a dark mass slumped close to them. “There!”
it. The potion is awful. But I need to learn how it's made in order to develop a proper treatment for those afflicted by it.”
Oh, Draco was such a fool. But he did it, despite his brain’s many warnings. He trusted Harry Potter. Potter, who had torn Draco’s heart into a million pieces. But, in retrospect, it had only happened because Potter had helped Draco stick his pieces together in the first place. Harry Potter had saved his life more than once in the past. Draco had no doubt he still had as much goodness in him as he had then.
Draco was the first one to notice the controlled ball of fire floating. Its flames swayed in a choreographed dance around them, circling the trees, running, and floating higher, then lower, as if it was alive. Draco wouldn’t be surprised if it was, considering everything he had seen.
Despite the fatigue wearing Draco down—Potter’s healing magic had otherworldly soothing effects on his scratches and sore muscles, but this was more due to the feel of his magic against Draco’s skin than Potter’s actual healing skills—and the desire to never get up again, they spent the rest of the night chatting about the day’s (un)fortunate events, Potter hovering anxiously over him like a worried parent.
The passage Potter had mentioned recounted an old ritual that allowed shamans to bring people back to life. Draco wasn’t sure if he took it seriously, for the book was full of myths and stories passed down by generations of indigenous folk. People didn’t simply come back to life like that (unless they were Voldemort or The Wonder Boy), but it resembled some aspects of his research. Those found in London after the war had been declared dead and buried, but after the tests Draco and tons of healers had performed on them, they had all concluded none of the patients had died at all.
They ended up watching the soap. Potter had a copy on tape and used a spell to translate everything that was said in
Draco disentangled himself from her in a swift motion. “It’s not! Is this about my past?” He ground his teeth, planting his feet on the ground, arm stretched forward showing the patch of skin where the Dark Mark stained him in a faded reddish-grey. “I am
Draco and Tainara were up in a second. Draco, because he was terribly afraid of fire since the Fiendfyre episode, and the mere word was enough to get the hair of his skin standing on end. He doubted Tainara had the same reservations.
An indigenous shaman responsible for healing magical rituals or rituals to invoke and control spirits. A healer.
He didn’t know this place, didn’t know its people and creatures. Draco did not know how to fix it, and had no devices to help him. He had to trust that this was for the best.
“I’m fine!” he screamed, not brave enough to glance down and meet Harry’s eyes. “Are we good already?”
Draco blinked, trying to get used to the darkness falling upon them, cool and serene. Crickets sang, cicadas found their place back in the forest. He heard low growls and birds singing. But he knew whatever animals were around them, they were just as relieved as Draco was.
Draco wasn’t sure if he had screamed or if it had been all in his head. He wouldn’t have heard it, anyway, above the disturbing sound of Tainara’s chortle, as Harry blanketed them both in more shadows.
Draco identified the lie, even before he felt Harry’s magic coming to life around them, rippling in the walls, dark and suppressing. Draco knew it, because of Harry’s eyes. The once light green orbs swimming in a sea of light were now almost entirely black, all white gone from them.
“He took too long, and Denakê, worried, followed him. But she did not find elder, but young and strong Carajá warrior. She took him home. Imaeró got jealous and said she had seen Tainá-Can first. Tainá-Can said: ‘You could not see beyond what your eyes saw. You didn’t love me, you loved my light. Your sister loved me, even when I looked old, and Denakê will be my wife.’
. People rarely reacted well to his tainted past. But Draco was happy enough that she spoke English—even if with a thick and hardly understandable accent—to let the little piece of information fade into the back of his conscience. It changed nothing.
“Oh yeah,” she said matter-of-factly. “It can do many things. Like, feel when you need help or are hurt. Well, not you, obviously, or me.” She snorted. “‘Cause we’re not on the network.”
Draco had thought when grey eyes met green. And he proved himself right when he awoke alone to cold, deserted sheets, never to be filled again by that heat.
“I’m sorry, Mr Malfoy, but this is it. Homunin is very sensitive, and it doesn’t… appreciate your presence here.” She was unyielding, voice grave and that grin with too many teeth completely gone. Headteacher Albuquerque did seem, right at that moment, even scarier than McGonagall—if that was possible.
As if understanding the sentence, the macaw nibbled at Draco’s hair and rubbed his head against Draco’s cheek.
“We had nothing serious…” Harry repeated what he used to say endlessly in the past. It felt as if no time had passed at all, but in the worst way possible.
“Caipora told me to wait, which is useless,” Draco went on. “You can’t possibly expect me to just sit around, clean your house and keep your snake company all day. Besides, I need new clothes. Clothes that won’t leave me melting on your floor.”
Draco and Potter barely talked the rest of the day, both too lost in their own heads to acknowledge each other’s presence. Draco was still reeling from the way the Headteacher had dismissed him earlier. Tainara had accused her of being
Once they had landed and Draco was safely on the ground again, still bleeding and dizzy from the transportation, he got to his feet. Saci grabbed his elbows when Draco swayed dangerously to one side.
Draco was in no rush to do everything now—apart from finishing his research, of course, since people still depended on him. That Harry had drunk a variation of the Moriaetem Potion was enough incentive for Draco to decipher the potion as fast as he could.
Boiuna, as in the giant snake from the myth, had sealed the night in the seed. Of course, the night had been freed centuries ago, according to Saci, so the whole thing didn’t really make sense.
The sight that greeted him almost had his knees buckling. It was, indeed, Harry Potter—not that he’d get his voice wrong, despite the many other ways in which Harry differed from the last time Draco had seen him seven years before: lying on his bed, stark naked, sweaty skin and adoring green eyes.
“But Professor Harry already was a bit like us when he got here,” the girl from before added, ignoring Potter completely. The others nodded agreeably.
Draco raised a hand to his chest. “Well, you should talk to Caipora. She trusts me.” Well, that was not exactly true, but hopefully Lua wouldn’t go after the truth, either.
Draco murmured, “What would happen if we managed to get Jurupari out of Harry?” His body was stiff and his eyes never left Tainara and the crescent cloud of dark matter around her.
“She’s great. I hope she’s not too much trouble for you. The girl can get overexcited.” Francisca nodded once, pulling the rope to make sure it was securely knotted to them. “And I was talking about the Boto—you’ll meet him, eventually. All of them, if I’m being honest. You’re fresh meat, and they’re curious as a bunch of cats, even if they don’t approve of you.”
Now that he was here, it was difficult to believe anywhere else in the world had a sun so warm and vivid as this place. Also, he couldn’t bring himself to contradict the kid, though he wouldn’t admit it under a death threat.
Regardless, Draco added quickly, before any questions could follow up his statement, “Why is it so hot here?”
The jaguar’s cackle became louder—if that was possible—and more acute, its body now rolling on the grass by the stump. It didn’t seem so threatening, rolling around in the dirt like a big cat.
Samba schools are composed of different neighborhood representatives, each of them coming from tiny towns or ‘favelas.’ The schools have two practical purposes: they emphasize the importance of the Brazilian culture to the world, and provide local members with lucrative employment opportunities."
Tainara’s description of “small, furry and red” was not completely inaccurate, and the creature in front of him was all of those things and more. She looked more human than animal, even with the red fur covering her entire skin. The woman was smaller than an ordinary person, but her presence was so overwhelming Draco felt like hunching back. Pointy ears were framed by hair almost as bright red as the rest of her fur. It fell around her face, covering her body almost like a dress. The woman—creature—wore big leaves strapped on her waist, some feathers hanging from her ears and several bead necklaces around her neck. Her face, though, reminded him of Curupira’s. Maybe all those beings were made to frighten those unaware. Sharp teeth slashed her expression in a dark, sadistic grin. Her eyes felt like knives, and Draco was standing at the piercing edge of her blades. It was Caipora, he was sure. It had to be her, but no one told him she could bring animals back from death.
His low, modulated tone sometimes reminded Draco of Lovegood. José was a much bigger man, of course, but his features were always soft and detached. Harry had said Luna and Ginevra had visited him once, and it didn’t surprise Draco to learn Luna and José were seen together a lot, and that the Weasley girl and Francisca had got along pretty well.
in his hands. The cover seemed enthralling enough, showing a man in a coffin with his eyes wide open, even though Draco didn’t understand a word of it.
Once Potter had fetched a bottle from one of the many red cupboards, he sat on the seat opposite from Draco. The bottle had no label, and the glass was stained and dusted from time. A tiny straw hat with an orange ribbon covered the cork. Where the fuck did Potter get these things?
“Hey, it’s okay,” Potter’s fingers pressed against his skin, grounding him. Or, at least, making sure he was still standing. “You can stay at mine. It’s barely at the limit of the school's grounds, so you won’t be affected by the lack of the Iaké Ritual. And I can come with you whenever you need to do research here. I’m sure Zé and Chica wouldn’t mind accompanying you, either.”
The creature shook his head, flames licking his face swiftly. “Caipora doess not wissshes to talk to the Dark Dragon.” Well, it was an improvement from ‘boy’. “She’ss ssso mad because sssomething of herss got stolen.” Curupira tsked, sounding suddenly melodious, peering amusedly at Draco as if it was his fault.
Harry had said Tainara didn’t do the ritual by choice, because she didn’t believe in the type of education they preached in Homunin. It had been true, apparently, that she didn’t trust it. But the reason Tainara hadn’t done the ritual wasn’t because she didn’t wish for it, but because she knew she’d never be accepted. Tainara was cursed. Maybe as much as Draco and Harry had been.
The seed trembled in his palm; the heat becoming almost unbearable. Then, just like before, it sliced itself in two.
Draco looked around, but Harry was nowhere to be seen yet, even if his voice was growing louder, closer. He turned to Saci immediately. “Get out of here,” he told the boy. And added, grimacing and hiding the hat in his enlarged pocket “Oh, and please, don’t tell anyone I have your hat.”
, more than he had felt in the years after the war. It was ironic, though, that he had to leave everything he thought that made him be himself, to really find out who he was. What he—possibly—wanted.
It sucked all darkness. The seed sucked everything that was shadows around them and closed itself with a thud.
of the night in the forest; no more cutting wind, just the leaves rustling smoothly, cicadas singing and birds crying.
Groups of students gathered in circles, using whatever magic they could tap into to keep them safe against the shadows. It wasn’t working. Their magic turned against them the second they were in the open, just like their own dreams. Most of the professors seemed to have noticed that limitation, and had picked up stones and twigs to protect their pupils against immaterial beasts, while still trying to make their magic work properly. It would not work either, Draco figured.
—after what seemed like hours and a lot of soreness on the soles of his feet. The trees had become thicker around him and the parrot, the canopy denser, protecting them from the worst of the heat even if the sun had already set by then. He tried not to worry too much about how much time had passed since he had begun his brief journey.
She raised an eyebrow, composing herself in her usual pristine stance. “You might have read about me in one of your researches with the girl. Some call me Iara, others call me
Draco could pretend all he wanted, but he was soon involved in Nazaré’s (the villain, not the snake) traps and ploys—she was a very good villain, and Draco tried not to feel bad about relating to her a bit.
Draco couldn’t move, enthralled by the creature and its small paws that reached for him. A smile tugged at Draco’s lips and he didn’t prevent it.
“Oh, it’s just a formality,” Potter clarified, waving his hand dismissively. “Don’t worry. The school likes to know who enters its grounds. It’s kind of like a light bond of sorts.”
Draco’s eyes widened for a second before he caught sight of Potter’s rueful grin as the wizard scurried out of the room without another word.
honest. He wanted to get that ritual done before it became too hard to disentangle himself from his old lover and his vexatious, distracting lips.
There, slumped around a stump, enveloped in the cold light of the moon filtered by the leaves, sat four figures with cards in their—Draco couldn’t figure that part out—paws, and a bunch of other cards displayed around the cross section of the trunk. A large and colourful toucan that had its long beak hidden behind a deck of cards held with his wings turned to face Draco; while the giant tapir and a jaguar—both also with cards in their paws—remained focused on their game. There was, yet, a fourth one, and Draco was relieved to deduce this one was a person, a man. He had russet-brown skin, and was dressed in an all-white outfit, an equally white hat covering half of his face and curly dark brown hair.
Harry Potter was not worth losing everything Draco had worked for over the last five years. Harry Potter
He had hesitated at first, considering whether to go back to his room after… Well, after he ripped his chest open so that Harry could poke inside and do to him whatever he pleased. However, soon after their bodies fell exhausted on the bed, Harry had snuggled close to him, holding Draco by his side and leaving no option for him to leave.
The change had happened two years after the war, when he finished his masters in Potions Damage and returned to London. Living in France proved to be not only a great experience, but a respite from all the ‘Malfoy rules’ Draco had begun to ignore when his father wasn't watching anymore. Most of the Aurors who insisted on ‘casually’ stopping by his new flat in London didn’t seem to like his jabs about their uniforms and what exactly Draco thought of their constant unannounced visits. Not that he cared. Draco didn’t really bother with people who didn’t get his humour.
But there was so much more to it that neither Neville nor the books had prepared him for. From just a glance, Draco felt life beating in each stone weaved into that construction.
Draco wore the new clothes the next day. After waking up with a terrible hangover—Potter’s fault and his insistence on Draco drinking cachaça—he had no energy to invest in his wardrobe choice, and ended up going with a t-shirt and jeans. Draco didn’t feel like he was in his own skin without wearing his exquisite robes, but nevertheless the new clothes were a fit match to the sultry air of the day. If Potter did a double-take when he saw Draco that morning, it was the last confirmation he needed that wearing them had been an excellent decision.
“Oh, please, I could see the dust from a mile away,” Draco interrupted, raising his arms affectedly. That wasn’t exactly true, but his boredom was so great that he took any distraction he could find. Draco had even started reading one of Potter’s dictionaries. English to Portuguese. It had helped him decipher the first pages of
The fear of being out in the open had been so intense back then that Draco had walked only a couple of blocks before he’d started panting. He’d gone into the first shop he saw: a little antique store.
“I know who zis is,” Lua said, her accent spilling out of her mouth like venom—Draco wondered distantly why the hell they all had so many accents in here. She didn’t spare a second glance at Draco, instead focusing on Potter, acting as though Draco wasn’t even there. “He’iz not coming in here.”
The new information had certainly piqued his curiosity, but he stored the knowledge for later once his eyes caught the sight of the thousands of books and scrolls piling up in front of him.
The tables scattered around were covered in typical food, most made of corn. There was also something called
Though there were a few tables strewn around, most people chose to sit on the floor, leaning against the gameleira’s roots. Potter had assumed correctly that Draco wouldn’t do well on those more… rustic seats and had got them a proper table.
Being deep in the forest had made the buzz of the students diminish to nothing miles before, and the only things Draco heard now were the leaves brushing, cries of the birds and monkeys, the crawl of smaller creatures and growls of the bigger. The macaw, at one point, had given up making Draco follow him as if he was as lost as Draco, and rested calmly on his shoulder as he usually did when wishing to be petted. Draco raked a hand on its head once more, before his brain started fully rationalising the deranged sight his eyes caught.
it. And he would always belong, because that place had claimed him as one of their own—even if it had taken an obscenely long time.
Machado, out of some sense of protection, landed on his shoulder as Lua approached him. Her steps made no sound, and Draco could swear she was floating, if not because he was staring at her feet and they were touching the ground.
it, as Potter had taught him, but the usually deafening noise that a substantial amount of water made when descending into nothing was muffled and distant.
It was better this way—to keep his distance from Potter. It was just one more thing he’d have to convince himself of.
It’d been seven years. A lot had changed. Draco no longer knew the reasoning behind Harry's actions, no longer had the right to analyse what he did.
Draco was getting used to staying there, even if he was not doing very useful things with his time. He and Potter both created a routine and fell easily into pace, as frightening as that might be.
“You just need me and the seed.” Saci blinked, as if it resolved all of their issues. “Just do what you need and I’ll boost it.”
“Ye don’t want anyone knowing,” Saci said one of those days, near the edge of the forest, not too close to the school that he’d be worried about getting caught. Draco, resting against a tree trunk, rolled his eyes and the seed of tucumã between his fingers. Saci went on, “Ye know it’s wrong.”
Potter sometimes resembled an animal, he thought. Not that he wanted to mate with Potter. Where had he got that idea from, anyway?
Harry was cold, so cold Draco could have thought he was dead. But no. He couldn’t be. Harry was breathing. Draco was sure of that. He checked again. His pulse was steady, despite how unresponsive he was.
, Draco pleaded in his mind. It didn’t matter that it was just a boy, and it was just one. Draco was
Draco wasn’t someone to give up that easily. He had, indeed, been through worse and got out of it. He could do that again.
He shook his head; the ghost was back again. Not one, many. Shapes of light wriggled around him with arms raised, yellowish figures that were so bright in the dark night that they were outshining even the stars. The leaves had turned a shade more saturated, gleaming in the orange hue of the fire and the ghosts Draco was sure, somehow, didn’t exist outside his head.
“Are you okay?” he asked, turning on the couch to face Draco. “Everyone’s okay, you know. And it happens sometimes.
Despite how alluring the school was, he wanted to get rid of the prat’s company as soon as possible. If Draco was honest, Potter’s presence wasn’t all that bad. But Draco was
Rudá didn’t touch Draco again, which didn’t stop him from reaching out anyway, hands resting on the trunk, albeit not making contact. Draco jerked back, not even caring for the wood scratching his skin—he would be left red and with rashes all over after this encounter.
“I mean, the magic here is unlike any other… You’ll see. We’ll Apparate to my place, then take the Jeep.”
Staying so close to Potter was risky. Not just because of what Draco felt about him, but mostly due to what he pretended he
Potter laughed, sprawled on the couch, hair still damp from his own shower, and wearing only a t-shirt and boxers—to which Draco decided against commenting.
Nazaré got so used to sleeping with them in bed Draco could swear she looked annoyed whenever they ended up dozing off on the couch. Even the damn red parrot found a place in their lives, frequently showing up before breakfast and landing on a chair, which left Draco wondering how the hell he always got inside the house if all the windows were sealed.
Draco had listened, and now he knew. The words slowly stumbled out of his lips. “Jurupari was the thing trapped inside the seed. The God of Darkness had been trapped, and I released it. And it needed Harry as a—”
She didn’t seem to notice his sarcasm and instead pointed excitedly at a page that, much like the others, Draco couldn’t understand.
All the Dark magic he had watched taking over Harry during the last weeks, the mood he had seemed to be in.
The night was back. And nothing had happened to him. Draco was fine, he was absolutely fine. There were no dark powers inside him, just his own magic and Machado’s.
“Yes, Drrragon Boy. No to darrrk in my forrrest, and we will let you in,” she agreed, sounding bored now.
She had been misunderstood, and it had led her to do bad things. It was no excuse, of course. But Draco knew that restlessness and despair far too well not to relate to her on some level.
Draco drew his wand, replenished the sun protection charms and insect repellent spells Harry had taught him—
him because they were just so alike. The only thing Draco ever saw in Harry’s eyes was himself mirrored back, and he was sure that was all Harry saw when he stared at him.
Saci was born from the bamboo bud, living there for 7 years, then 77 more practicing his tricks among humans and animals. Then, when his time is done and he dies, he becomes a poisonous mushroom.
She shook her head. “Maybe I will come visit you. I am most intrigued by how these… Brazilian wizards perform magic. I have also heard the most interesting tales about something called Samba School?”
almost tumbled out of his lips before Harry stiffened between his arms. Instead, Draco whispered, “What’s wrong?”
Not that it’d be the best plan to exploit Lua’s weakness—if she had any—considering she was already too suspicious of Draco. But there had to be
But he didn’t meet any of them. Instead, Draco faced Saci once more after only a few minutes of walking into the woods near Harry’s house.
“To infuriate the Carajá, the King Vulture told his secret in a whisper, thinking no one was there to listen. The Carajá couldn’t make out his words, but the birds and the trees did. That’s how they learned to remain young, renewing their feathers and leaves from time to time, as we, people, will never know this secret.” Harry finished in a whisper in Draco’s ear, his breath a hot puff against his skin.
Draco retched again, coughing and brushing his hand across his lips, swaying to the side. “What does it mean?”
He conceded after not much thought, to be honest, and fell easily into step with Potter. His hands came around Potter’s neck as he held Draco’s waist. The song was slow, a husky voice singing verses about love Draco couldn’t understand, but he
Spells were still thrown in an attempt to contain the flames, but it didn’t take more than an hour to get everything under control. The trees were still charred, and the persistent odour of burned wildlife blended with the damp air. But there would be no more harm today.
“Damn right I waldan’t, that’s exactly why.” Saci feigned nonchalance, staring at the woods around them as if Draco wasn’t there. “That’s wha’ I’ve been telling everyone.” His eyes were on Draco now, dark and fierce and furious. “Ye’ll cama here, and use yer magic against us, and destroy everything,” he talked with as much calm as he seemed to muster, which seemed little, from the way Saci flared his nose and held his jaw taut.
That red macaw came back a week later, and from then on it didn’t stop showing up in front of Draco, perching on his shoulders whenever it saw him—it had dropped the hopping on his head act once it learned Draco was very much inclined to yell his lungs out if it did that. He was becoming increasingly used to the creepy stalker parrot around him all the time, which didn’t stop Potter’s colleagues from making fun of him.
According to the old Pottermore and JK, Caiporas are protectors of Castlobruxo. Though I don't agree 100% with this, Caipora is a fascinating creature and I wanted to use it in SoS.
When he spotted it, it was nothing more than a blur. Surrounded by green and brown, the yellow bright thing stood out, catching his eyes almost instantly. “Wait, stop!”
Potter’s easy grin returned, as if it had never left. “Half past six. Time for breakfast. Fancy some?”
They stopped when they reached the highest platform, made of, apparently, the same wood as that tree. Harry guided him through another set of charmed steps to the top of the crown, where they found a large hammock hanging between thick branches, under the deep and infinite night sky.
. His mind-healer’s words didn’t help. As he’d told her many times: how could a person like him even have a happy place?
“It works like Apparition,” Potter supplied, seeing Draco was still stunned to silence. “You’ll be able to do it, once—”
Saci looked unsure, his bouncing more harmonic than Draco had ever seen before. That couldn’t be right. It didn’t look right, but it didn’t look wrong either.
Draco was there to finish his research, and that’s what he was going to do. After he found a few breakable objects to appease his growing temper, obviously.
Except it breathed. It was as alive as the rest of the school, vibrating with a magic Draco couldn’t yet understand.
Sighing, he shook his head and his shoulders, freeing them from the Headteacher’s grasp. Steely grey eyes met hers. “Who the fuck are you? What did you do to me?”
The hope that things would work out vanished from inside him at that moment—not that it was abundant, before. Draco knew what was happening, he knew, and he didn’t like it.
Their lips crashed like waves on the rocks, encouraged by the storm coming up the horizon. It was slow, intense, tongues remembering the path they still seemed to know in their hearts.
“There's no point in my staying here, if your school is going to prevent me from reading anything useful.” Draco got up from the root they had settled on. “And I happen to be famished. You know I can’t think on an empty stomach.”
—wasn’t trying to eat me? You should probably make sure she knows I’m not edible material. Not very tasty.”
The shadows pressed closer. Francisca screamed something unintelligible. Draco didn’t look at her, his eyes darting fast between Harry and his pupil.
The girl shrugged, clicked her tongue, and laughed, loud and disturbing. “I brew your potion. And I gave it to Harry.”
He turned to Draco. “My ancestors might be Latin, Brazilian even. It’s unclear. I was travelling the world trying to figure it out, when I came here and…” Potter had a shy grin playing in his face. “Stayed.”
The water was great, indeed. Fresh against the skin, made hot by the scalding sun above their heads. The greater part, however, was to watch the droplets slowly drawing patterns on the curves of Harry’s body, glistening against the sunlight, making Harry’s golden, tanned complexion even brighter.
Draco glanced at the star-filled sky, at the brightness that the King Vulture had left behind. He wasn’t so sure people hadn’t learned that secret, after all. People changed, too. They became better. They had to.
The car was destroyed. It had almost completely melted to the ground. Its structure had turned into a metallic sludge, spoiling every patch of grass it touched. Had it been Harry’s magic’s fault?
The little monkey scrutinised him for a long moment, prodded his little paws in his direction and took the fruit—too big to fit properly in its tiny fingers. It clasped the mango, though, and scurried away right after.
At first, Draco had thought he stumbled into a wizarding shop by accident, so strange were the myriad of knickknacks on the shelves, bright and enthralling. It wasn’t, but it felt comfortable enough that after three strolls down aisles full of treasures, he had calmed down.
was not Harry. It was just something else using his body, his voice. Using Harry's fiery touch to hurt.
“Is that what this is?” Draco finally started again, softer, the feeling of being lost that had disappeared for a while settled back inside him. “I’m just visiting, and then I go away and they won’t think about me anymore?
Both women turned, neither of them too surprised to see him. Lua had the same air of superiority and anger that had met him before, but Caipora stared at Draco with something resembling pity.
“You can call me Chica. And you’ll see soon enough the things we have to deal with here on a daily basis,” the woman said, a smirk playing on her lips. There was a threat to her tone, despite the mirth. “Now, Draco, Harry here told us a lot about you.”
accent coming out of Potter’s lips as he tried to bend lines of rebellious students into submission.
Fernando gave him a wan smile that Draco assumed meant the man couldn’t do anything about the problem.
Potter, overprotective as he was, was already on Draco’s heels, hands groping Draco’s body, checking for any grave injuries. Draco was fine, though, and batted Potter’s hand away before the heat of Potter’s skin became something dangerously natural.
The climb was steep, almost completely vertical, but Harry had been right when he had said those trees were heavily charmed. The one time Draco’s hand slipped, a strong root grabbed him by the wrist and waist, smoothly keeping him from falling.
He jumped back a step. But Harry’s hand was still on his and he didn’t really want to separate them. Draco forced himself back to the place at Harry’s side.
Harry still had a couple of smaller tattoos scattered around his body; the anchor on his thigh, a palm tree on his calf, and a snake on his hip. Draco worshipped each of them with his lips, stopping only when he was certain he had covered every inch of Harry’s skin with kisses.
Francisca huffed, pointing at the pipe, “Keep that in hand. And try not to draw your wand. It might trigger them.”
“Look, I promised Caipora I wouldn’t give in to whatever darkness would tempt me—” Draco took a steadying breath, stepping in front of Lua. “I really just want to fix it. Please, help me. I’m begging you. And I rarely beg. But I’m doing that now. I don’t know who else would be more qualified to—”
“Harry, you’re fine. You will be fine. Tainara cannot control you. Jurupari cannot control you. You’re strong,” Berenice chanted smoothly.
There was, truly, no hidden agenda in his trip to Brazil, despite his mother’s suspicions. It was the last step to finally finishing his research. That country held the ultimate key to achieving the conclusion of his years-extensive work. He’d shoot himself in the future if he decided not to come only to get married instead.
Draco blinked, deterred by the unfamiliarity of the languages they all spoke at the same time. Surely they understood each other, and Draco was in no mood to admit—
“A coconut?” she asked, and her curiosity was now focused on Draco. “Who gave you this? And what the fuck happened to your hair?”
The Living Section featured an assortment of small cabins, and a slightly larger building that, according to Potter, was the dining room. A powerful scent came from that structure and Draco could not identify it for the life of him.
When Caipora and Lua said he would release a dark power after opening the seed—a power that would possess him—Draco had assumed he would be the only one harmed. He hadn’t imagined this power could cause such havoc in the school.
“It was the fox who spoke what the boy wanted to know. ‘The other animals are afraid of talking, but not me. It was the King Vulture, who found the secret to eternal youth and thinks there’s no point in remaining young if he’s ugly. He stole all the stars to embellish his feathers. He told the others to keep quiet, if they wanted to know the secret,’ the fox said. The Carajá was furious, and went searching for the King Vulture, finding him with a startling clutch.” Harry’s hand rested on Draco’s waist, fingers softly stroking his skin. “‘The stars were made to garnish the night, and not to feed your vanity,’ the Carajá said, not interested in knowing the secret of youth. He ripped the King Vulture’s feathers and threw them in the sky. Each of the feathers turned into stars and the sky was filled with brightness again. The King Vulture, seeing that the Carajá was distracted, flew away, now not bright or flaunting anymore, and screamed into the sky. ‘You took away my feathers, but I still know the secret to eternal youth.’
Saci was grim now, bouncing right in front of Draco. His aura was something dark and surreal. Shadows danced over his limbs. Saci secured Draco with firm hands, trying to keep him standing. “Put that thing away.”
Draco reached for the book, but before his fingers grazed the paper, it closed with a heavy thud. Potter muttered something about the breeze and opened it again for him to read. Draco leaned in, all but willing to, but just as his eyes caught the first words, the book closed again on his nose. He huffed, this time trying to open it by himself. However, the moment his fingers came in contact with the material, a jolt ran down his skin.
Draco told Narcissa so, when he called her the morning of his lonesome birthday. Deciding he was too worn out to go out, Draco gave himself the entire day to rest at Harry’s house, avoiding contact with any living thing apart from Machado and Nazaré.
was here?” Draco spat, leaning forward. He wondered if he shoved his hands in the fire if his fingers could grab Longbottom’s neck.
felt different. It felt smothering, humid, dark, crawling its way over Draco’s body until it reached his neck, gaunt fingers closing on his throat.
When Draco woke up, the soft sunlight streamed through a crack in the curtains and birds sang in the distance. He felt the freshness of a cool breeze wafting around the room. He stretched on the bed, willing his sore muscles to respond, and winced when they tried to refuse.
Draco’s eyes darted from one to the other. Potter’s face had creased into a grimace, but the Headteacher… well, she was pale, all colour on her face had disappeared, leaving behind a taupe aspect to it.
Draco doubted that, with how he was being constantly watched, but he shoved his head against Harry’s neck anyway, a smile curving his lips. “Wish we could sleep here. It’s so… peaceful.”
Zé was kind enough to clarify. “It’s a spell to take you to another point in space. I think you have something similar in the UK.”
Draco took the first step in once the initial shock had ebbed away. There were so many spells knitted into the foundations of the house—extension charms, protection spells, sticking spells—that his words were completely lost. Not for the first time that day.
someone so deeply it became part of him. This feeling never left him. And after some time, it didn’t even hurt anymore not to be near Harry while loving him.
spiritual animal had to be a snake—a snake that you saved, on top of that. Not over the saviour complex yet, I gather?”
Draco was disheartened to have to brave the woods again—and alone, if the animal was not considered into the equation. But he’d been in Brazil for long enough to believe all things there happened for a reason, and if the bird was dragging him that way, it had to mean something.
going to fix it and prove to Harry, and Berenice, and the bloody school, that he could do it, and that he
Draco was becoming progressively aware of Tainara’s disappearing skills, and he doubted she didn’t really know how to perform the transportation spell everyone around there did but him. “She was just here.”
“How the fuck do I win a school over, Potter?! It’s a bloody school, not a person!” And he didn’t win people over that easily, overall.
Draco wanted to ask what exactly Harry was trying to say when he closed his arms around Draco’s waist, but he remained silent, lips resting against Harry’s.
He almost didn’t catch it, but once he did, he knew immediately what it was. The small fruit had the shape of an eye; white filled with a tinier black dot in the middle. It was small and hot, and full of magic. It was the magical guarana.
“What the fuck…?” Draco sputtered. He couldn’t be intimidated by that. He could not let Potter’s voice get to him—it was
“Yes, that. When he was reaping fruits in the forest, Jurupari transformed into a snake and bit him. Tupã sent a storm… No, thunder to warn the boy’s mom and dad, but it was too late, and the venom of the snake killed him.
He was deep in the forest, completely alone. The rope Francisca had tied to his wrist had been long lost, and Draco had no way of knowing which way was back now. Perusing his surroundings, he found Curupira’s footprints once again, but he was sure it would be useless to follow them. They led to many places, and Draco doubted chasing someone with his feet turned backwards would be effective in his current—or any—situation.
Francisca must have thought his state was deplorable, though, for her strong features creased in a grimace as soon as she laid eyes on him. “Harry was just here looking for you, but he seemed to think you were at the library.” Draco frowned, but let it slide when the woman added, “I don’t know if I want to know what you were doing
The magic rippling through his body was something like Draco had never felt before. It touched his bones, awakening his sore limbs. It was sheer power, pure and bright. He registered everything around him in a slow fashion; the way the breeze powered by their combined energy made his short hair float, the chanting of the leaves on the trees’ crowns, how the hair on his skin all stood on end from the pure magic, the silence around them falling upon the night like a quiet sea, drowning them in something different, something
Both José and Harry laughed, but did not contradict her. He was under the impression she was not an easy woman to oppose, and just accepted the jab with a stilted laugh.
What was happening was terror. A deep, frightening horror clawing under his skin, pulling him down, making everything dark in a place where only light should prevail.
There was, however, something else weird about this Harry, something off or just… different. Draco couldn’t put his finger on what it was yet.
Harry moved smoothly across the forest, his steps so quiet they didn’t make a sound. Draco’s sounded like the steps of a staggering child. Draco only knew Harry was there for he was in front of him, guiding the way, with Machado placidly flying above their heads.
Draco pushed him lightly, sighing and taking a step back. Silence reigned in the room for a beat. Draco didn’t trust his own voice to speak. Not yet.
He and Tainara had been reading comfortably for a couple of hours when Francisca and José crossed their way, a sly grin plastered on their lips.
Despite his amused tone, Draco recognised the truth for what it was. It was too bad (for himself) he could still identify Potter’s slight nuances.
The stroll out to the next section of the school—the Practical Studies Section—was turbulent, as people kept stopping them to chat. Most of them seemed to know who he was, from what Draco gathered of the “
The tip of Harry’s fingers touched the back of his hand. Draco opened his eyes; the sun seemed brighter now, blending between the clefts of the canopy. The green of the woods was more saturated somehow. Giant trees stirred up around them, most of them of such height that their tops merged with the deep blue sky. It had been raining, but there were no clouds above their heads anymore.
It was a tiny village, featuring brick roads, small colourful houses and people sitting by the steps on their doors, talking and beckoning them over as Draco and Potter crossed their way.
All alone. Yes, sure. To transform something that should be romantic into an isolation. “I’ll come with,” Draco blurted.
” Draco let a relieved sigh escape his mouth. He cupped Harry’s face, a hopeful smile drawing his lips up. “Yes, it’s me. How are you feeling?”
Her eyes, locked on the fire, slowly turned to face Draco. “We don’t need your help here.” The way she stated it sounded like an accusation, more than a simple fact. She turned to the fire unceremoniously. “Look.”
Draco frowned at him. This man was… worried about their presence disturbing the animals. This man went out of his way to make it easier for others to be around him. Draco was secretly happy
His robe got caught against a smaller branch sticking out from the base of the gameleira’s trunk, and he was about to curse all the gods when he heard Potter’s laughter. The git had, once again, offended his sense in fashion when they had left the house earlier. That time, though, Draco didn’t even have it in him to retort, as his loafers plunged in the wet grass, muddy because of the rain from the night before, and emerged ruined. Potter had said the rain had been the reason Nazaré went to Draco’s bed in the middle of the night. The snake had just been seeking heat. Draco had abstained from replying, even as the answer almost tumbled on the tip of his tongue—that it didn’t fucking explain why the snake chose Draco’s bed and not Potter’s. He was too proud to admit that Potter emanated heat like a furnace, as if he had a sun of his own.
He told her everything, narrating the night’s episode in frightening details, while Francisca helped fix his hair, only after concluding she was going to use scissors—
Potter didn’t make a turn now, but ran through a thin space between two trees that physically would be impossible to fit a single soul, much less a car.
Draco barely remembered going back home and lying on the bed, apart from Harry’s soft whispers in his ears and his steady hands holding him. Harry changed his clothes at some point. The feel of the magic cleaning Draco was warm before he had given in to sleep. It was Harry’s magic, and it felt…
What had he been thinking when he left London? Even with Hogwarts, and the war, and Voldemort sharing his house, and everything that Draco had had to live through, he still felt terribly unprepared for what he was facing now. Draco didn’t belong here, didn’t belong with Harry. Everything went wrong because of Draco.
Tainara proceeded, “My family line was cursed not to be accepted by the school, and you,” Tainara’s index finger, something that now looked too gaunt, was pointing at Berenice. “Kept this ridiculous tradition of the ritual. Kept pushing us until we were forgotten!” Her voice was strained with venom and hatred, face turned into something ugly behind all her face paint. She turned to Draco again. “I just needed to get you the seed and dad was so helpful.”
Draco flinched back and Francisca—Chica—laughed. “You came to do research, didn’t you? You’ll love it here. Harry is a lost cause, he won’t be able to help you. Anything you need, just ask us.” She pointed a hand at her own chest and at José.
“It iss the Dark Boy,” the creature hissed, in a way that reminded him too much of Harry’s Parseltongue—minus the arousal—staring at Draco with a pointed and honestly terrifying glare. Curupira’s voice sounded so animalistic and alien that it took Draco a moment longer to compute that the creature was speaking English. And it had just called him Dark Boy. Who the fuck was he to tell if Draco was dark or not? Draco was torn between being a terrible person or someone better since the war, too much on his own, to need the judgment of a being who didn’t even have hair.
Narcissa’s eyes were locked on him. She was poised in silent understanding, but there was no softness to her gaze.
Draco couldn’t blame the drug, ayahuasca, whatever it was, for his actions. He remembered them so clearly, he could still follow the line of thought that made him attempt it, and figure it was something he’d have done, eventually. Drug or no drug. Saci or no Saci.
Draco wanted to return the gesture, but the weight on his shoulders seemed to have settled also on his face, making the corner of his lips constantly curved down.
? Then…” Her voice was now barely a whisper. The bad feeling Draco had about the whole thing since the damn flame didn’t enter him now intensified. She seemed to sense it in his face because Tainara added, “It’s no big deal, right?” She waved a hand like it was really nothing major or catastrophic. This was how Draco was painting it in his head now. “I’m not on the net either.” Tainara rolled her eyes, shrugging. “Everyone here is
fault!” he yelled, and this time he made sure he was heard. “You wanted to pin everything on me and now look at what you’ve done to Harry! You’re hurting him! And it’s all because you kept playing with me, instead of looking for the real threat!”
The shocked expression he got from her was what he needed to finish burying his hopes in a deep pit of despair.
He was about to prod the answer out of him when Potter interjected, “It’s time for your ritual. Berê is waiting.”
what was going to happen. They’re toying with me and you know that. Tell me they did that to you when you got here as well.”
Apart from himself and the woman behind the counter, there wasn’t a single soul in the Portkey Station. The clerk, however, didn’t look bothered in the slightest by the smothering emptiness of the space.
life would try to throw him off his balance by shoving the Boy Who Won’t Die in his face after years of silence and three hours—he checked his watch yet again—and thirteen minutes.
Convincing Lua to talk—or to help him—would be another business entirely. She clearly despised him, even more so after the whole sucking of the night into a coconut episode.
Distracted by the unknown words, Draco barely missed the way the fire crackled on the hearth. It was too hot for a fire, especially for them to spontaneously start burning like that. But it was Potter’s house, so he figured normal rules didn’t apply. However, as the flames grew they took on a green hue and Draco suddenly remembered Potter had mentioned the house was connected to the International Floo Network. Draco had made a mental note to call mother and Pansy, but with all that had happened, he didn’t really feel like reliving his failure with them.
It wouldn’t do him any good to let his guard down now. But the thing was, Draco would take anything those creatures were willing to give him. He still didn’t trust any of them, but it could only help with his research.
“But, you see,” he went on, unsure if she was even listening to him, but determined to break the walls she held so high. “There’s no logic to your line of thought. The longer I take to figure this out, the longer we’ll all have to deal with the sun. And with Rudá, whatever he was planning.” The name made Lua flinch. Whatever Rudá meant, it had worked, so Draco continued. “Rudá gave me the seed for a reason. I tried finding him again, but it’s impossible, as you’ve probably figured.” It was. Draco had spent a few days in the search for the half-marine creature, before Saci kindly reminded him that Rudá transformed into the pink dolphin by day. And since it was day every time now, the man was unreachable.
He doubted he’d notice Caipora or Curupira approaching before it was too late, but his ears stayed stoically attuned to any noise out of the ordinary. Draco was not an explorer, nor prepared for what he had to face in Brazil. There was a different sedateness in the certainty that there was nothing he could do to change the outcome of that jaunt.
Many things happened at once; Rudá tipped his head to the side, the glint in his eyes turned graver. The jaguar stopped rolling on the grass, stood on its paws and started circling them like a beast ready to strike—none of its previous laid back demeanour apparent. The tapir disappeared somewhere behind a bush and the toucan flew away from there.
The screeching on the field became even more distant, a reverent silence falling upon them like a mantle.
Blinking, Draco watched as Saci disappeared right in front of him. In his place, a small plant raised from the earth.
Draco didn’t. Not quite, and his stomach fell at Harry’s response. He should be glad Harry was understanding. That he was willing to give Draco the space he needed.
A sting of betrayal and abandonment shot through him. It was not the first time Potter left him to the wolves and it wouldn’t be the last, Draco convinced himself. Of course, if Draco was rational about things regarding Potter, he’d realise the truth for what it was: Potter was trying to help him. And Potter trusted these people to do the same and keep Draco safe.
was the one that was gone. And just in that place, Draco found out that they were two completely different things; grieving the dead and mourning past mistakes.
Draco failed to see how things would be alright, but hummed in acquiescence and turned to face him. Potter parted his lips, as if he were about to say something before immediately closing them. His face creased in a scowl and he lifted his head, almost as if smelling something in the air—just like Francisca had done the previous day. Draco raised an eyebrow but got another grimace in response.
“Well, he did give it to me.” Draco shrugged, fingers closing in on the hat. “What is that, anyway?”
“Well, it took me Merlin knows how long running around in this labyrinth—I mean, forest, to find you. Common courtesy dictates that you hear me out?” Draco hated it sounded like a question, like a plea, but that was all his terrified body could manage. He’d take what he got, as only looking in her direction made his breath hitch.
“Hey, it’s okay. It’s no big deal, I swear.” Potter’s shrug carried the same placidity of his words. “It’s very light and absolutely reversible.”
He changed a lot. It wouldn’t be fair to say that he didn’t. Draco improved himself and learnt how to keep his mouth shut and his features schooled into something cool and distant, when all he wanted was to grab something—
It wasn’t fair, though, that Draco’s heart had no preparation over the fact that the Boy Who Stubbornly Lived was there.
Potter got up, offering a hand to Draco, and smirked. “What? Your inability to land? Hadn’t realised you couldn’t fly anymore, Draco.”
“You just like him because he riles me up.” Draco rolled his eyes, then turned to the macaw. “I should let Nazaré eat you.”
The house—which was more of a rustic shack—seemed too small at first glance, standing on the end of a path marked with black stones. From the outside, it looked tidy and cosy. A red hammock hung over a wooden porch, swaying gently in the breeze. There were beautiful, colourful flower pots scattered around the entrance. It was a simple dwelling, so small that Draco doubted Potter would have a spare room for him.
, please, tell me what I can do to be accepted by Cast… Homunin.” He caught himself at the last minute, presuming she’d be happier if he used the original name of the school.
The Headteacher, the staff of Homunin and the creatures of the forest had devised a way to loosen the strands that held the school together after what had happened to Draco and Tainara.
At least he still had his wand, he considered, groping around in his pockets and pressing the familiar wooden stick. He didn’t pull it out, though, remembering Francisca’s warnings about it. He was lost in enemy territory, and unwilling to present himself as a threat. At least, not more than how those creatures already perceived him.
“Perhaps it confused Draco’s long hair with feathers,” Francisca went on. “Or no, no, maybe his voice reminds him of the mating call.”
“This is for you,” Rudá offered, stretching his hand to Draco. “I think you’ll find this one quite helpful.”
Harry nodded, a sad smile on his face as he took his hands away from Draco, and with them all his warmth. “I understand.”
The sun was as bright as in any other day, time, hour, minute, searing hot against his scalp. The hours were merging into one endless day. Draco couldn’t tell the difference even if he wanted to. He couldn’t help but be thankful that his hair was shorter now. It’d be sticking to the back of his sweaty neck if it were still long.
They passed by the Practical Studies Section fast as lightning. The Quidditch pitch resided at that side of the school, but Potter dismissed it quickly, explaining they’d have time to go back there again. He was expecting a match between the two clearly, and Draco winced at the thought. The flame of the old challenge burned something inside him. However, the dullness of a body which hadn’t mounted a broom in years held his enthusiasm at bay.
They were resting on the grass, a large kapok tree serving as shelter from the sun, a pile of books mounted by their side. Despite having spent most of the morning trying to find anything new about the magical version of guarana or the mysterious mushroom that Draco was convinced was the last ingredient used in the Moriaetem Potion, the pile was now abandoned.
When questioned about it, Potter dismissed it with equal disinterest, telling him it lay in the Research Section, along with the most dangerous beasts. It was restricted for the safety of the students, but Draco would have access to it once he’d done the ritual. Potter’s disregard for it shouldn’t be a surprise, as he had never been the academic type.
To Brazilians, though, the full moon had a different significance. Well, not all Brazilians, as Tainara explained, but the period was paramount to indigenous people.
He hissed, laughing bitterly. “No! I’m bloody furious! And why the fuck didn’t you keep that bloody coconut safe if you knew it was dangerous?! Are you stupid or what?”
He opened his mouth and took a deep breath, hot air filling his lungs, tongue sticking out, clammy and weird tasting.
A hand grabbed his forearm, pulling him back and back from Harry and his pain. Draco couldn’t tear his eyes from his lover, though, even when his feet took him away from there.
With Harry's back to Saci, the creature could not see his face, the darkness in his eyes. Draco wanted to hold on to him, not to let anyone get close to Harry, not to let anyone see what was happening to him. Draco needed to protect Harry from whatever it was. He just didn't know how.
eager to show him around, unable to stand still, fidgeting and trotting here and there. It was nice to see his open smile. Draco couldn’t lie about it even if he wanted. It was not like he had had many opportunities when they were together, when the weight of the war made their lips stay almost constantly tipped down.
No one had told him anything about a Curupira—not really. Apart from remembering he might like the pipe Francisca had given him, Draco was not ready to deal with the small, fiery indigenous boy.
Draco pulled it from his holster and pointed at the object. His eyes, though, were on the creatures. “It doesn’t work. I’ve been trying magic since the first time I opened it.”
him to read it, Draco couldn’t be bothered to feel embarrassed. He didn’t know how to ask Tainara how she did it, and she didn’t offer an explanation, so he just read—with Tainara’s translation, of course.
Machado was always by his side nowadays, so he wasn’t really afraid of getting lost in the forest anymore. But, of course, there was the tiny detail that all the creatures that lived in there probably hated Draco by now. Well, he had dealt with far worse during and after the war. He could handle Caipora and Curupira’s disapproval.
Saci stayed silent for a few moments, nostrils flaring, before he crossed his arms and lifted his chin, looking to the side. “Ye wish. I’m not answering.”
The moment Potter disappeared, a girl took his place, popping in front of Draco from nowhere. He jumped back, trying as hard as he could to regain his composure.
Draco had never shown his scars to Potter, not even when they were together. He always kept the shirt on, or used charms to hide them. It didn’t matter anymore. The only thing Draco felt when he stared at the marred tissue of his torso was grief for what he had lost that year. Himself.
prepared for this and all he wanted was to run and hide, and never think about backward feet and boys with impish grins again.
Harry scowled. “No. I was in a really dark place when—Anyway, Ginny had a hard time when she came visiting, too. It didn’t last long.
Harry’s eyes were even darker than before. Long, black veins slithered across his face as if the shadows were bleeding out of him, as if he couldn’t hold it all inside. It was pouring out, a mass of powerful, dark energy surrounding Harry—surrounding Harry
Draco tamped down whatever instinct ordered him to track exactly what had hurt Harry and make them pay—it was not his place anymore. Maybe it had never been.
Not that Draco socialised that much with Potter’s friends, but time and some space had transformed their stilted bumping on the streets into something more polite and deliberate.
“Ouch, stop that!” He tried waving him away, but the animal only got more determined, raking his head against Draco’s cheek. “What do you want? I’m sure you don’t need me to feed you or anything. Go look for Potter, he’s the one with the knack for helping every weakling he can find.”
—rose to its paws. Draco backed away immediately, even if it was many feet away. Harry chuckled, his eyes following the beautiful creature as it pranced into the forest, away from them.
Harry’s body was lying motionless on the floor. He was still breathing and his chest heaved softly, but other than that, he was completely still.
Draco suddenly wanted to know who had sealed the seed. How they had both forest and outside magic, but he didn’t ask. Not now. Once the night was free and everything went back to normal, he would fix the rest of it and if they felt like it, the women would let him know. Draco was in no position to demand anything from them.
He didn’t seem mad, though, his grin spreading even larger. “She’s fiercer than I thought!” he shouted, turning to his game companions.
“Never have I felt this way anywhere,” Harry said, pulling away and resting his head on Draco’s shoulder. “I used to doubt how I felt all the time. It was like… I was still dead, even after I came back. But here—I feel alive here.” Harry smiled sadly, and from the brightness of his eyes, Draco knew that to be the only truth Harry had. “I don’t know if I deserve to be happy when so many have died because of me. But no, I don’t think I’m ever leaving.”
If Harry seemed hurt, Draco assessed, it must be only his impression. He couldn’t really waste any time worrying about Harry or his feelings. Draco had better things to do. And it was past the time he’d bend backwards just to get Harry’s attention.
They did that thing again, when they stared at each other because they didn’t want Draco knowing what they were thinking.
wouldn’t have sent him to Brazil completely unaware that Harry ‘We Had Nothing Serious’ Potter was there waiting for him. Longbottom wouldn’t even see what was coming before it hit him once Draco was back in London.
A crack appeared on the edge of the translucent shield. A thin vein of black magic made its way across the energy that protected them.
So far, he had heard about the Caipora, protector of the woods; Guaraci, the sun; and Tupã, God, and wasn’t really sure about the true existence of any of them. It was impossible to deny his curiosity about the Brazilian culture, about their beliefs. It’d been a long time since Draco had been so engrossed in anything that wasn’t potions or marriage decorations. He was sure he’d spend all of his free time in Homunin at the library, deep in readings about indigenous culture, once the school finally accepted him.
They had a good routine, and it matched their needs; Harry’s not to be alone at all times, and Draco’s appeasing Harry’s sense of protection whenever he thought Draco was feeling down.
He sat, legs trembling, eyes still staring at the blackness of the sky above his head, when he heard the leaves rustling on the tree on top of him.
—throw it on the floor and see it shatter to a million pieces. It wouldn’t appease his temper, he’d learnt
, he heard again. Draco hadn’t known what it meant when he’d heard it before, and he didn’t know now, leaning against a tree inside the forest, alone, panting and spewing his guts out. Somehow, it made sense.
Draco hummed, waiting for the rest, but when nothing else seemed forthcoming, he slid his eyes to José’s profile. He offered, after a beat, “He did mess up.” And
A shiver went down Draco’s spine, as each of Curupira’s words echoed in the forest with the same intonation, the same cadence of Harry’s voice.
But it couldn’t be. This complete mess would have a logical explanation. It could be that dark power’s fault, it could be the creatures’ fault. Not Tainara’s.
Castelobruxo was a lot more than the palace and the cabins where the students lived. Potter’s eagerness to show Draco everything was evident in the gleam of his eyes and his lopsided smile. Once again, Potter’s hand landed on the small of Draco’s back, filling him with that infuriating heat of magic. Draco didn’t pull away as Potter’s chin lifted and pointed at the sky. No, not the sky. The trees on the rim of the forest around the castle. Draco’s eyes glinted as he finally took in the sight that Potter was trying to show him. The trees, a lot of them, held what seemed to be rugs hanging from the branches. The hammocks were displayed in many colours, standing out from the green and brown of the trees. If he squinted his eyes, Draco could just make out the form of chunks of wood on the trunks of the trees, creating steps that lead to the most high hammocks.
Instead of smashing something at that moment, though, he took a deep breath. Draco tried imagining his happy place now, as his mind wandered off to his Breaking Room—it had been the smallest room in his old flat, completely devoid of furniture, the sole purpose of it being to mollify Draco's destructive behaviour. Compact as their flat was, this was something Draco wouldn’t give up. He had made it clear to Martin when they had moved in together. Martin had been so eager to please a short-tempered Draco that it had not been a problem.
“Grrreat, then I have something forr’u,” Caipora announced, and then promptly screamed into the air. From her mouth, though, came a cry that reminded him a lot of a bird’s song.
“No, it’s not! What have you done?” There was no need to scream. Not in the unearthly silence of Homunin. Still, Draco did so. His lungs hurt, his head throbbed. His eyes were wet, torn between staring at her and making sure, every second, that Harry was still there.
Draco shouldn’t get used to that. To belonging. Longing for something he couldn’t have anymore was dangerous.
He had heard it all at least twice a day over the course of the last few days, since Draco had formalised the Iaké ritual. Harry had taken it as a personal challenge to teach Draco all the magic he could perform once he was in the network, not really realising they had all the time in the world now.
The woman merely blinked. Hand raised, she cast a translucent green shield around them and it didn’t turn into darkness. “I understand your uneasiness. We’ve all miscalculated.”
The engine roared to life, slowly and carefully, as if it had been sleeping for too long. Draco averted his eyes from Potter, trying to make out what was moving on a tree just ahead. “You didn’t answer me. What are you doing here?” he asked.
“This is not Curupira. The fire doesn’t just go out. Never!” Harry was on his feet in a second, dark eyes fixed somewhere above Draco’s shoulder.
Draco, once again, found himself speechless. Not with the bit about Potter. Sometimes he wondered if Potter had the emotional intelligence of a twelve year old, getting all excited about an ex popping up in his life again—if they could even be considered exes—but at the trust she had just placed in Draco.
Hiding how he felt now seemed irrelevant, though. Also, it turned out schooling his features was more difficult once he started speaking his mind. Draco had convinced himself that honesty was the right path to get people’s acceptance. Honesty also granted him a lot of animosity; these days, the only ones who didn’t flinch when he was less than pleasant were Pansy and—surprisingly—Longbottom. It happened an awful lot. Not that Draco saw people very often, apart from his mother, those two friends, and people at work—who weren’t really fond of his facetious comments.
Draco huffed, raking a hand through his face. “I can’t believe you didn’t even consider him just because he saved some people once!” More than once, and Draco himself at least thrice if he was counting the way Harry saved him with his love.
“I like it better like this,” Francisca offered, shrugging. “Not that it wasn’t beautiful long, but you seemed like this steely figure. Now you look like someone… I don’t know, real. Approachable.”
“They’re fine. I’m sure they’re fine,” Draco stuttered through gritted teeth, ignoring the pain building in his burnt skin. His eyes went back to Saci, who was already backing away as silently as he could. “I just found you fainted on the floor, Potter. You can’t possibly expect me to just let you go deal with these creatures’ stunts now, right? I’m sure it was just Curupira pulling some of his tricks.”
The main building—the palace—resembled a temple. Its golden rocks glittered and refracted a flaxen hue almost everywhere the light touched. The field surrounding it was covered in short grass, the vivid green of such life that it seemed to beam a light of its own. Around the field, surrounding the school and the giant waterfall, the trees of the Rainforest enveloped them in a protective dome.
Potter took him to the shack Draco recognised as the place he kept the materials he used to teach. When he picked up two bright new brooms, Draco raised an eyebrow at him. Potter had a sly grin on his lips, and he only shrugged, the challenge written across his face.
The strange man lifted his head, and Draco finally saw his eyes. They were bright, a colour that resembled rose gold shining in the dark. His features were gorgeous, albeit cold and menacing, plump flushed lips slanted in a wide smile that got Draco shivering. “What a wondrous sight!”
Draco’s face furrowed in rage. He yanked his arm free and stepped forward, the menacing energy still preventing him from reaching too close.
Potter snorted, shaking his head. “I think it’s a bit late for that, or you won’t be able to sleep. I meant something… maybe something alcoholic.”
Her smile grew bigger, and she forgot the previous subject as quickly as she had brought it up. “Absolutely! It’ll be so much fun! And no, don’t worry, I’m meeting Jaci later.”
Potter. It was a teenager, speaking in riddles, trying to scare him away with some illusionary powers. Just that. “Yes, I am sure as hell.”
Brazilian portion of the Amazon Rainforest. There was really no reason for surprise. Still, it was a sight so different from what he was used to that he was at a loss for words as he tried rationalising the absence of concrete and the usual colourless sky.
He and Tainara—mostly her—had taken some books about native plants to the patio, and sat under the shadow of a tree to read.
“My cousin gave him to me this summer, only I couldn’t tell my dad. He’d be so angry if he knew. So I had to take him to Hogwarts with me.”
“No pressure or anything,” he joked, Pansy rolled her eyes. “But in all seriousness,” Harry insisted, softening, “Draco and I are no different from you and Theo, Pans.”
“When they mature they will be able to unpetrify Mrs Norris, Argus. She’ll be back to her full health,” Dumbledore reassured the caretaker.
“It’s a frightening concept,” Pansy agreed. Harry didn’t miss the look she shared with Draco. What was that about?
A cool breeze swept over the grounds and Pansy used the hand she wasn’t using to hold her croquet racket to hold onto her wide brimmed beige hat so it didn’t blow off. It was a humid day and Draco was thankful for the breeze that blew through his loose clothes and gave him a brief relief from the heat. There was something different about this wind though. It smelled like fall.
Harry blinked at his friends. This was all new news to him. “That must have been why Fudge tried to keep me in Diagon Alley. He wanted me to stay in the Leaky Cauldron.”
“Gee, thanks.” Harry rolled his eyes and lowered his wand, reaching for his glasses on the bedside table he shoved them up his nose.
Theo turned to face her with a look darker than she’d ever seen on him before. “What’d’you care,” he snarled.
“No? Why would it be a big deal?” The other boys glasses were sliding down his nose and Draco felt the urge to reach over and push them back up but resisted.
It was the best Harry had slept in ages, he figured it was because of the comfort of having another person, especially his best mate, so close. From that night on Harry continued to sleep in Draco’s bed. One of the two of them always came up with something that lead to Harry in Draco’s bed. They’d be listening to music, playing wizard chess or Exploding Snap.
“Just because her preference in men is kinda influenced by how many Galleons he’s got in his gringott vault and Harry, even though you dress like you’re homeless we all know you’re loaded.”
Draco waved his hands in the air. “I don’t know, Harry! Maybe because ever since you saw Clemonte and I snogging in the library you won’t even look me in the eye!”
Pansy swallowed thickly. She’d never really had any serious conversations with Theodore. Those usually happened with Harry or Draco. But both of them had a lot going on at the moment and she didn’t want to bother them while they already had so much to think about. “My parents are getting a divorce.” She wasn’t sure why she told him. Pansy hadn’t really planned on telling anyone. But he’d offered and talking about her feelings had worked before in the past.
“Nah, if he had a crush on someone he would have told me,” Harry said. He would right? They were best friends, surely if Draco liked someone he’d trust Harry. Now that he thought about it though Draco had never told him about a crush. “Who in this room do you want to have your first kiss with?”
“None of your business.” She held up her nails and examined them, refusing to talk about her and Harry anymore. "Truth or dare, Theodore?’
Harry and Draco shared an amused look. Both of them thought Blaise’s crush on Pansy was obvious but Pansy denied it.
“I promise, Pansy.” Harry shares a look with Draco, this is about the third time they’re having this conversation.
“Oh, Harry, it’s not that simple. It might be alright for a little while, but what about when we break up? It’ll completely ruin the group of us. It’d be so terribly awkward!” She sobbed, tears falling.
Harry made a sound like a growl at the back of his throat. "I can't see you soding asshat. Give them back." Pansy had started laughing hard and heads at the Slytherin table started turning to look at what was so funny. "Draco!" Harry's eyes were unfocused and Draco was laughing hard now too.
Draco snickered. “I’ll ask Dobby to make us a platter of crackers and cheese. I’m famished but at this rate we’ll be here for a good time longer.”
Harry had gone down to breakfast wearing what he’d slept in assuming the rest of them would be in similar attire. Theo, of course, had been the only other one wearing anything resembling what he was wearing. Pansy had a robe pulled over her thin, strappy, silky night dress. Blaise was wearing what qualified as pyjamas for Blaise, a black sweater and grey sweatpants. It was the most casual thing Harry had ever seen Blaise wear in his life. Draco had also pulled on a sweatshirt and loose pants. This left Harry and Theo to be the only ones in boxers at breakfast.  Mrs Malfoy really had gone very pale.
Sitting back down on the bench Draco took Harry's glasses off and handed them over. "You're no fun," he moped.
“This is my serious face,” Theo told him, biting his lower lip to try and suppress the grin, it was totally ineffective.
”Draco, I spend every waking hour of the day with you,” Harry snapped, growing irritated. “When would I have had the chance to enter my name?!”
“You found it?” The other boy stared up at him in disbelief with wide eyes. “Let’s tell the Dumbledore.”
“Hello, sirs,” said an unnaturally high voice from behind them. Harry let out a strangled noise and grabbed Draco’s arm as he whirled around.
Of course he’s masturbated before but it’s usually been a quick and rushed affair in the shower to make it go away fast before lessons. It’s always been an inconvenience. Now he’s filled with an excited rush, a heated tingling, every stroke felt good.
“I want your friends to be comfortable when they come to the manor and I’ll pardon it this time because for starters it was the first time and in addition because it was Christmas morning.”
“When the Clemontes came over. Draco did a little more than show Griffin the books his mother wanted him too. Then there was that time when we were playing cards.”
Draco buried his face in his hands again. He didn’t want to have to think about, let alone face or deal with any of this. “How could I? They’ll be weirded out by it, Pans,” he said, voice pained.
“Because you’re the obvious and easy answer.” Pansy seemed slightly skeptical but overall satisfied with that answer and went back to flipping through her Witches Weekly.
“I smell apple pie baking,” the boy told them as he pulled off his hat and gloves. “That’ll be soooo good with some vanilla ice cream on top.”
“Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker,” suggested McGonagall. Creevey. That annoying slime ball of a kid who’d been annoying Harry all year trying to take his photo. Who else had a camera at Hogwarts?
Harry shared an amused look with Blaise but didn’t argue with his girlfriend. Girlfriend. That thought sent an unpleasant spike through his chest. The guilt he’d been feeling around her lately and his best friend was almost too much to bear. He figured the most likely reason was because when he jerked off it was usually with the thought of Draco in mind. Merlin, he was despicable. He did his best to think about it as little as possible. He’d tried all summer to think about Pansy instead but it just didn’t work as well. Being around either of them in real life made him feel uncomfortable, like he was lying to them. But he wasn’t, it’s not like he liked Draco. He wasn’t gay. Sure, he’d sorta had a crush on Cedric...before- but that didn’t prove anything. He’d also found Cho attractive and she was definitely a girl.
“Apologies Miss Parkinson. Dobby didn’t mean to frighten you. Hello to you too Young Mister Draco Malfoy, Mister Harry Potter.” The house elf waved enthusiastically.
It was him, the boy from the robe shop. Draco could see behind his mothers soft smile and caring words, he could see her panic. Draco glanced at his father and saw the panic in his eyes as well. He kept his mouth shut, not wanting to disturb his parents train of thought as they steered their trolleys through the thick gaggle of muggles who parted for the group, backing away from the other boys hooting snow white owl.
The other boy staggered backward, a hand over his nose, blood seeped from between his fingers. When he took his hand away from his face Harry saw that his nose was crooked. The sight made up for the pain that was coming from his curled fist. Aldrich took a swing at him, Harry barely managed to duck away but landed to punch Aldrich in the gut. Aldrich doubled over and Harry brought his knee up, winding the other boy who staggered forward. When he turned around there was blood all down the front of his shirt, tie, and robes.
They continued the truth or dare until Pansy got back and she sat herself on the low wooden table in the middle of all the sofas and chairs, facing Harry. “What kind of look should I do?”
“Better than,” Theo bragged. “I asked her when we broke up if she was interested in being friends with benefits cause I’d be down, she didn’t seem too interested in that idea.”
“You know it’s okay to be upset right? You don’t have to be so chill about this. It makes sense that it hurts.”
Theo, initially in the submissive position, stepped forward on his left foot and moved into Adam’s personal space. This forced Adam to reorient his hand, palm now vertical.
"I know." Draco sits back. It was then that the train whistle rang out and they started to chug forward. He searched for something else to say. "So which house do you think you'll be in?"
“Serves him right,” Pansy scoffed, “disgusting toad of a boy.” They were all gathered in the Slytherin boys dormitory, listening to Pansy tell them what had happened once she’d gone along with McGonagall to her office. ”I mean, sure, he’s not that bad looking, but Merlin, what a slimy git.”
“What else am I supposed to say?” Draco adopted a mocking voice.  “‘Oh, Harry, do you really think so? Oh, Harry, compliment me more, Harry!’” He dropped the high tone. “I don’t think so.”
“Potter, can’t keep his big flap shut.” Draco side stepped his friends and Harry chased after him, determined.
By then they’d reached the manor. Harry smiled at him and passed through the door he held open for him. Theo released a near pornographic moan when he smelled the food being cooked in the kitchen.
“Draco, talk to me,” She begs him, sitting beside him on his bed, her hand on his shoulder. He wants to shrug it off but resists.
“Here’s something better,” Theo struggled to pull his sock back on with one hand as he passed the nearly empty vodka bottle. Blaise downed the rest.
“Harry, remember right before the attack on Justin and sir Nick, how you told me you heard a voice in the walls talking about how it was going to kill?’ Harry nodded. “And how you’ve heard it before every attack? The Basalisk is a snake-”
There was no conversation about it but the next week Theodore Nott was bashfully walking Pansy Parkinson to her classes and carrying not only her books, but her hand in his.
The train ride back to Hogwarts was brutal. Draco had been trying to get Harry to talk to him but he was always around Pansy, Theo or Blaise. Now they sat on opposite sides of the train compartment, avoiding eye contact and not talking to each other unless it was indirectly.
"You wouldn't know them. They're dentists." Hermione puffed out her chest but at the same time her voice shrank.
“Don’t argue, Potter. This way if you have another nightmare I’ll be here with you.” Something in Harry’s stomach fluttered at that. Harry slipped his hand around Draco’s wrist loosely and pulled him toward the bed in the middle of the room. The duvet was pushed back, the sheets rumpled, decorative pillows discarded on the floor. Harry felt bad for waking Draco, he hadn’t meant to. Hopefully he hadn’t been screaming loud enough for it to wake Mr or Mrs Malfoy.
Draco held him back from rushing toward the veil. At first Harry had struggled against him. Something in him was ripping and tearing apart. He could physically feel the pain in his chest. It was agonizing and he couldn’t see straight. His knees gave out from beneath him and had Draco not been supporting him Harry would have collapsed to the ground.
Draco relaxed his shoulders and tried to untense. Picking back up his quill he started writing. He’d been grossly overthinking the letter but it was easy to write once he got started.
"Not half bad?" Harry nearly fell off his broom at the sound of a new, deep voice from behind them on the ground. "That was fabulous." Harry looked down to see a rough looking older boy with dark hair and a crooked nose (like he'd been punched there before) peering up at them, shading his glinting black beady eyes from the sunlight. "You're Potter. Figures you're good on a broom. The name's Marcus Flint. I'm the captain of the Slytherin quidditch team."
Blaise shoved open his hangings and stuck his head own. “Shut up you prats. It’s like the ass crack of dawn, what are you doing up?”
Harry looked wide eyed at the glistening silver, emerald encrusted, sword in his hands. It was perhaps the most beautiful thing Harry had ever seen. He looked up at Draco, who was trying to look cool and unbothered but Harry could see beneath it.
“A girl has been taken by the monster,” Snape informed him in an icy voice. “Alas, your moment has finally arrived.”
“I don’t want to watch you two and your disgusting public displays of affection.” Draco rolled his eyes and moved to leave again but Harry hopped up and grabbed Draco’s trunk from him.
Blaise’s laugh was raspy in the morning. “Nah, nevermind, dumb question. None of you poofs were that lucky. I’d be surprised if any of you got further than a kiss.”
Dinner was a torturously slow affair. Harry couldn’t stop fidgeting in his seat, impatient to tell someone what they knew. He hoped that it would be enough. After dinner when students were streaming out of the great hall he and Ron tried to get around them to speak to their Headmaster but Dumbledore disappeared  into the throng of students.
“You know it’s okay to not be good at everythi-” Harry was suddenly blinking cold snow out of his eyes. “What was that for?!”
Pansy finished with his left hand and reached for the nail polish. “I just don’t understand why it hurts. They made each other miserable. I knew it was coming for ages. They’ll be better off.” She tried to discreetly wipe the tears from the corners of her eyes. “Why does it hurt so much?” she asked, voice cracking.
“My mother just bought a new house in Poland so I suspect we’ll be spending most of our time there,” Blaise said, yawning. Harry wanted to laugh because of how flippant Blaise was about his mother buying a new house. He wondered if Blaise knew it was usual for most families to only own one house.
He squeezed his eyes shut and gripped the arm of the chair so hard his knuckles went white. “I swear Potter if you say cool one more time.”
Draco let out a heavy sigh and dropped the sweater he’d been folding into his trunk to turn and face Harry. “And why, do enlighten me, would they decide that?”
“'Real mature, Malfoy.'” Seeming to not be able to help himself Draco tacked on, “And no actually I will never need to know how to manually make meals. This is servants work. I am a Malfoy.”
Draco rolled his eyes and kept walking down the hall. “Right, yep, you’re right, Potter. I definitely hear the voice in the walls.” When Draco didn’t hear Harry’s footsteps behind him he turned back around. “Harry let’s go.”
Pansy shrugged, nonchalant. “Doesn’t seem weird to me. It’ll give us a chance to get to know each other.”
It was incredibly weird having the whole bed to himself, weird to not have to fight for the blankets. He was actually annoyed with himself by how hard he found it to fall asleep with the ringing silence, no deep breathing to lull him to sleep.
"Ahhh, Harry Potter, I wondered when I might be seeing you. But where should you be placed? Courage indeed. A fresh mind as well. Lots of talent. Oh. Oh, yes, you've got such a strong thirst for greatness. You know where I'll put you? SLYTHERIN!"
Harry blinked and watched Draco continue to try to cover up the pimple. A few minutes later, tilting his head this way and that in the lighting, he seemed satisfied and started to put away the powder.
Harry rolled his eyes at his boyfriend. “Seems unnecessary to use the knocker. Would it be weird if I just knocked?”
Draco made a face and pulled up a chair. “Please, Potter, I’ve read ahead far enough. I won’t fall behind.”
The first portion of the train ride the group discussed going to Hogsmeade since they were allowed to go now on designated days since they were in their third year at Hogwarts this year. When Harry revealed that he hadn’t been able to get his Aunt or Uncles signatures, hence he wouldn’t be able to go, they started discussing ways to sneak Harry in. It was around then that a rain started up, thick and fast. Bullets of rain fell in rapid succession against the compartment window. Professor Lupin still hadn’t woken up.
Harry and Draco ended up spending Christmas together again, this year though the Malfoy’s spent Christmas at their place in the mountains.
The third gift felt like a book but when Harry tore away the wrapping he saw a photo album. He flipped open the first page and sat, stunned, by the photos he saw. He was equally taken back by the rest of the album. There were all sorts of photos, some from all the way back in their first year. Photos of quidditch games with all his friends completely decked out with face paint and banners with Harry’s last name in big green letters. Photos of a slightly more chubbier cheeked Harry and Draco fast asleep and leaning against one another for support in the common room. Photos of them at the three broomsticks playing exploding snap with massive grins on their faces and wild gleams in their eyes. Photos of him and Remus drinking tea and photos of him and Sirius hugging in some and laughing in others. A photo of Harry playing wizards chess with Ron and another of him studying with Hermione. Photos of him and Theo sharing a joint in the green house. A photo of him and Pansy, her legs thrown over his, the way they were so often when they sat together. Photos from last summer of him and Draco at the Quidditch cup. Photos of all four Slytherin boys in nothing but their boxers and ties doing the can can and smiling like maniacs at one another from that one evening they’d gotten really drunk for the first time just the four of them.
“Don’t be silly. We’ll be well behaved, won’t we Pans?” He said as he lifted Draco’s trunk over his head to put it in the storage area. His shirt slid up an inch showing a peak of smooth skin. Draco bit his lower lip. The train hadn’t even left the platform and it was all already too much, this year was going to be torture.
Harry shared a look with Blaise and Draco, silently communicating that they’d stay with Theo while he followed Pansy. Easier said than done. It took him half an hour to find the girl. He found her fuming on the winding steps leading up to a tower. Tears tracked down her cheeks.
McGonagall's eyes hardened further. "Hogwarts does not tolerate such filthy, derogatory language, nor does it condone violence. Both of you have detention with me from 7-9 every night for a month," she declared. Her tone made it clear that there was no room for negotiation. "Now go see Madame Pomfrey, Mister Aldrich."
Draco looked him up and down. Harry felt blood rush to his cheeks, it felt intense having Draco look at him that way. His own eyes scanned Draco. He really did look good in red. It wasn’t fair. Then Draco said,  “You look no more stupid than you usually do.”
“He was on muggle TV,” Harry remarked, remembering the snippet of news he’d overheard from under his Aunt and Uncles window sill. He shoved the croquet gate back into the ground and took another swing at his ball. He was distracted though and his blow miscalculated. His ball went way off from where he’d been aiming for and he sighed.
I would also like to apologise for the fright I think I gave you that night last year when you left your uncle's house. I had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the sight of me alarmed you.
Draco snorted and shoved his head away. “Mmmm I d’know. They weren’t surprised. Mother laughed and Father told me we weren’t very subtle.”
Or maybe they wouldn’t. Draco dwelled on the possibility. Maybe they would disinherit him. Perhaps they would cut him off, take his trust fund and never speak to him again. Maybe they’d be disgusted and hate him and pretend he didn’t exist. What would they tell their friends, the media?
“I don’t like that Moody character,” Draco said, scowling as they left Defense Against the Dark Arts.
“He’s your best friend and you’ve developed feelings for him. You’re afraid he won’t feel the same way towards you. Or worse, that he won’t want to even be friends if you tell him.”
“Gee thanks, Pansy,” said Harry, looking through them. He knew muggles had face masks but he was pretty sure they weren’t baby blue with crushed billywig wing to clear pores or chartreuse with gnome saliva to calm irritation and soothe redness.
Harry looked away from his friends and instead shifted his gaze to Draco who’s head rested gently on his shoulder. The other boy had fallen asleep almost as soon as they sat down. He sighed gently in his sleep and Harry smiled down at him softly.
Harry looked up from where he was playing a quiet game of wizards chess with Theo in the library (alright, so it wasn’t so quiet. Madam Pince had already given them sharp shushes and the murder look a couple times and Harry knew they were on thin ice), Blaise and Pansy sat with them. Draco was walking toward the group of them. He looked good in a green sweater and dark tight jeans.
Harry’s lashes fluttered. He could hear himself breathing, shallow, flush with desire. He reached out and knotted his fists in the fabric of the other boys jacket and pulled Draco down into a kiss.
“Wait!” Theo yelped. “I have to get more alcohol for this!” He rushed out of the room and when he came back he uncorked a bottle full of golden scotch. “Shot glasses?” He asked Draco.
As annoying as it was every time Harry ended up in the hospital wing because he passed out from the presence of the Dementors he didn’t mind it quite as much anymore if only because Draco was always there when he woke up. Madam Pomfrey had been adamant at first that Draco not miss lessons but the boy had fought back fiercely until she’d given up. Now all she did was shake her head and tut when she saw him.
Suddenly his cock twitched in his hand and he sucked in a breath. Draco’s smirking, cocky, arrogant, face swam to the forefront of his mind and his hand sped up. The thought of the other boys breath on his neck, licking, sucking, kissing. Just that thought was enough for the heat in his chest to liquefy and pool south.
I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter's godfather, hereby give him permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends.
Draco’s heart fluttered. Harry knew something very few did, what he looked like first thing in the morning. Even the other Slytherin boys didn’t know that. Draco always had a few short moments to compose himself behind the curtains of his four poster bed before facing them and starting his day. However, with him and Harry sharing a bed there was no hiding. He composed himself and was proud of how evenly his voice sounded when he spoke. “Unfortunately enough for you my parents and our guests do not appreciate my bed head.”
Narcissa stormed down the halls of Hogwarts, memories of her own days as a student in these halls flooded back to her. However, she didn’t let herself focus on them as her priorities were elsewhere.
Harry was incredibly touched by Draco’s offer but worried that the Malfoy’s wouldn’t appreciate him stealing their son for the evening with so many important witches and wizards around. He shook his head. “That’s alright. Let’s go back down. I was just taken back.”
“It’s summer!” Theo hollered as he threw open the compartment door and settled in beside Draco, who sat across from Harry.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” seethed Theo, turning his back, a crease between his brows.
“I thought- but no, I guess once a bigoted pureblood always a bigoted pureblood,” Harry lashed out. Not even able to look Draco in the eye anymore, Harry turned away, pulling Ron with him. He’d thought Draco had changed, that he’d become more open minded. Harry considered the thought that the superiority of purebloods over any other blood status had been what Draco had been taught his whole life but dismissed that because it wasn’t an excuse. Harry couldn’t make up reasons to justify and defend Draco’s actions, his usage of slurs and ignorant, offensive behaviour.
Recognition passed over the girls face. "You're Harry Potter. Mother said she thought it was about time you started your education. My name's Pansy Parkinson. It's a pleasure to meet you."
As the three of them followed her into the entryway Harry got a good look at her. Pansy looked older, she’d cut off her long black hair and it barely brushed her shoulders now. She also had bangs. It suited her very nicely.
"Is that who you live with?" Hermione asked curiously. "I really am sorry about your parents by the way. I couldn't find very many good books on what happened that night and of course my parents can't tell me. It must be awful."
“Uh, for two obvious reasons,” Blaise told them. “One, he’s the only other boy here with kissing experience that isn’t Theo, who you already said no to. Two, you already bicker like an old married couple and you’ve got all this chemistry between you. The way I see it you might as well.” When no one said anything to that he asked, “What have neither of you ever thought about it?”
Draco sighed heavily. All he really wanted to do was relax but his parents had raised him to be a good host. He supposed relaxing would just have to wait. “What would you suggest?”
“Friends with a Malfoy?” Black croaked, lip curled when his eyes landed on Draco, who Harry had moved to protect with his body as the tall, dark haired, gaunt man had stepped out of his hug with Lupin and toward the five of them. “I don’t think James would have wanted that.”
His view of the boy was locked when Mrs Clemonte, a hefty woman wearing a navy blue dress and her hair in a low bun, stood when she saw Draco. She set down her tea with a clatter that made his mother flinch. “Draco! The last time I saw you was nearly five years ago! How are you my dear?” she looked behind Draco and spotted Harry, Blaise and Pansy. “Draco are these your friends from Hogwarts? How is school going? Enjoying it I hope? I’ve heard wonderful things!”
Harry felt Draco’s fingers stroke gently through his hair. He shifted his gaze, without moving his head, from the veil to Draco’s face. “Of course it hurts. It will for a long time, love.”
Wolf whistles followed this action and he went on for a good minute before he pulled away. Draco was staring at him like he’d lost his mind and that made him laugh.
That name made Harry’s insides roil unpleasantly. He reasoned with himself that he wasn’t being fair. Claudette was a perfectly nice girl. He still couldn’t figure out why just the mention of her made him upset. “Come again?”
“Harry, you should know better than to make rude remarks about a girls hair at dinner. Honestly.” Her tone was hard and he knew he’d have to do something extra to make up for this little outburst.
When he was gone he turned to face Draco again. "Draco, why don't we talk to him and the other boys?" Draco finally looked up from his work.
After a moment of silence Draco thought maybe Harry wouldn’t say anything else. Then he said, “I jinxed it.”
“You really suck at this game, Theodore,” Pansy frowned over her book at the chessboard containing significantly more of Harry’s pieces.
“But I didn’t get you anything,” Draco mumbled as he stared in awe at the parcel Harry handed to him.
“I’m very well. This is Harry, Blaise and Pansy.” He pointed to each of his friends in turn. “Theo should be down any minute. They’re my housemates at Hogwarts, which is indeed a very good school.”
“No, I don’t,” Harry glared into the flames. “I don’t want to be friends with a prejudiced asshole.”
The other boy rolled eyes and clenched his jaw. “Why do you care? Why are you thinking about that?!”
“Be done in a bit,” Harry said before heading up the stairs, taking them two at a time. Draco watched him leave before heading to the kitchen.
“Well, my father will get tickets. And your coming with us of course,” Draco said, as if they’d discussed this before now.
I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don't know whether they're used to owl post. I am in hiding. I won't tell you where, in case this owl falls into the wrong hands. I have some doubts about his reliability, but he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.
Draco stopped and shoved a finger in Harry’s face. “Stop. Stop chasing me down the hall and yelling.”
"Hopefully Slytherin. Then we can be housemates." Draco grinned at him. "It would make sense if you were. Slytherins are destined for greatness. You killed the darkest wizard of all time when you were a baby. Imagine what you're capable of now!"
“Because I highly doubt Fudge would have released Harry to an unknown house elf. Besides, Dobby is making Harry’s favourite, treacle tart.” Harry’s mouth watered, the Dursleys had fed him even less this summer than usual.
Draco walked up a gold winding staircase that led to the second floor of the library, Griffin trailed after him.
“What, why?” Harry ran a hand through his ever messy hair and Draco promptly tore his eyes away. He hated how whenever Harry ran his hands through his hair it made it look like he’d just had a rough shag.
Today was the day her little boy was going off to school. Narcissa told herself she would see him at Christmas and that the holiday break wasn't far off. Only four months, she'd only have to spend four months alone at the Manor. Of course there was Lucius, but Draco would be miles away, and it just wouldn't be the same.
“Bonjour, c'est un plaisir de vous rencontrer. Je suis Claudette Bernard.” (it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Claudette Bernard) The girl extended her hand to Draco. Harry watched, internally seething, as Draco pressed his lips lightly to the top of the hand she’d extended.
“I’m not saying he isn’t..” Draco searched for the right word. “Talented. But something’s off about him. Trust me.”
“It’s not extreme,” said Harry, running his hands over his face and through his hair, frustrated with the whole situation. “Draco can’t possible think it’s okay to distinguish wizards and their worth by their blood status.”
“This is insane,” Griffin said, wide eyed as he moved to the closest shelf and ran his finger along the spines of the books. Draco was fixated by the movement of the other boys finger. They were long and thin, similar to his own, fingers like that were good for playing the piano or violin. Draco blinked, he had to snap out of it. “Which is your favourite?”
“Oh- well- go ahead.” Draco slipped around him. Harry sucked in a lungful of air as he passed and hurried into the bathroom.
Theo’s eyes narrowed at the possessiveness of the gesture. “Yes, delightful,” he said, forcing a smile.
“Remember that time you came to the manor for Christmas in first year? And we accidentally got tipsy with the eggnog?”
The corners of Theodore’s eyes crinkled when he grinned. “You gonna paint my nails now?” He asked teasingly, voice gentle.
“Thanks, Pans.” The words came out uneven and broken. He found he had the urge to cry again, for a different reason this time. He was so grateful to have her as a friend.
Harry was about to open his mouth to say he was probably just staying at Hogwarts when Draco, without looking up from his paper, answered for him. "He's coming home to the Manor with me."
“They’ve been trying to hide it from me but, well, it’s the reason I think they made me stay at my aunt’s in Greece last summer. So I wouldn’t see. But they don't even live together anymore. My mum stays in one house, my dad in another half way across the world.”
He let his thoughts meander and drift as he watched Harry take his turn and send his orange ball straight through the gate with a solid swing. When his boyfriend turned back to him, a triumphant look lighting up his face Draco gave him a lazy smile back.
“I’m not angry!” Draco clutched the strap of his leather bag a little tighter so it dug into his palms, distracting him from the flashes of what definitely were not unreasonable anger going through his chest.
She smiled at him. "Make sure Draco knows that. Of course it's fine for you to make new friends. Just remember your old ones."
The five of them talked about things like classes and what their parents had told them about Hogwarts for most of the remainder of the ride. Harry felt a little left out because he didn't know much about magic or the wizarding world. He was grateful for Draco, who did his best to patiently fill in the gaps. Pansy, upon realising Harry's situation, giggled. "Oh Harry! It's okay. We'll help you out."
“I can’t be friends with people who have opinions like that. I’m a half blood, Pansy. Draco can’t just pick and choose when it’s convenient-”
But when the weekend came around and Harry had walked into the common room Draco had been standing with Pansy and Theo looking ready to go in tight dark denim jeans and a black pea coat. He’d claimed that he needed to take a break from studying. Harry had done some fast thinking to get out of going and said he had to practice for the next quidditch game, maybe he’d go to Hogsmeade with them next time.
“Pansy’s mother lives here alone?” Harry marvelled at the Parkinson manor. Night was falling fast but there was still enough light to see how extraordinary the exterior of the manor was. The grounds were expansive and green, littered with statues and shaped shrubbery. The manor itself was castle-like in appearance and Harry felt slightly intimidated by the large knocker on the door they stood before.
That made something in him snap. Harry couldn’t hold it in anymore. “Maybe that’s because everytime I see you all I see is Clemonte pressing you up against a bookshelf and sticking his tongue down your throat!”
Harry snorted. “Definitely. I’d trip over my feet otherwise. It’d be a spectacle, what a nightmare.”
“What have you done to my cat?!” Both boys jerked around to see Filch who looked about ready to skin them alive. “You’ve killed her! You’ve killed my cat!”
She grit her teeth. “You’re right,” she ground out. “I’m not.” With that she sat up, stiff as a rode, and stormed from the room.
“That Umbridge lady is a daft cow. I honestly don’t think I can go to another one of her classes,” Harry threw Defensive Magical Theory across the room.
“Maybe it doesn’t matter if you don’t do well?” Theo asked. “I mean, what do you want to do after Hogwarts?”
Pansy gave him a long, considering, once over, dragging her eyes up his body, then tutted. “Huh, still not ringing any bells. Must be because you didn’t beat us,” she said, smirking up at him. Theo glared out the compartment window but Harry wasn’t sure the boy was actually seeing the scenery flashing by.
“It’s pretty much a dragon,” Ron said, looking down at the illustration in the book of the Basalisk.
Draco tilted his head back and clung to Harry, releasing a trembling breath. Between breathy gasps he said, “We said we’d go to Hogsmeade with them. If we don’t go soon they’ll know something’s up.”
“No- I’m- I’m not,” Draco said weakly. But things were starting to add up and click into place and with sudden clarity he realized that’s exactly what was going on.
The whole night Harry found his eyes going to Malfoy even though Pansy was all done up. She clung to his arm and whispered in his ear in the way she’d always done that he’d never found annoying before but despised for some reason that evening. She really did look lovely in a dark green, silky looking dress that swept the floor and had thin, intricate straps in the back. Her dark long hair was in a braided messy bun up the back of her head. Harry really couldn’t figure out how she’d done it.
Harry refrained from correcting Draco’s usage of the word ‘skiiboarding’. “I think you’re just worried you’d wipe out and not be able to stand.”
Harry felt himself flush even deeper. “I’m going down for breakfast while you wankers get over the fact that Pansy and I swapped spit.” Draco made a choking sound.  “Later girls.”
He wished he could talk to someone about all this but it wasn’t like he could go to the boy he’d been masturbating to the thought of, and he couldn’t go to the girlfriend he wasn’t thinking about.
“Yeah, well, Theodore says a lot of cruddy things.” Her footsteps picked up pace as she walked faster.
“Oh yeah.” Harry dug around in both his pockets. “Shit. I must have left them in my room, hold on, it’ll only take a minut-”
“I’m sorry, can you say that again?” Harry couldn’t help but laugh. The sound of it carried down the hallway they’d just started to walk down. It had tiled floor, with a green and silver carpet running down the centre. The walls were dark with silver torches that held glowing green flame. Statues were evenly placed down the right side of the hall, on the same side as the torches. The opposite side was lined with nearly floor to ceiling windows with dark swaths of fabric held back by intricately designed silver clasps to let in the summer light.
Draco slipped onto a staircase just as it detached and Harry blew a kiss and watched the other boy roll his eyes. A smile on his face. Harry fell back to walk with Blaise and watched Theo give Pansy a long languid kiss on the mouth in front of her class.
Harry breathed a little easier when he was by himself in the dormitory getting ready for bed. He ran a hand through his hair and cringed because he thought it felt a little greasy. Figuring he’d probably better take a shower he grabbed a fresh pair of boxers and headed to the bathroom. Just as he was reaching to open the door, it opened itself and he leapt in surprise.
Draco shook with laughter. Harry’s heart swelled at the sound, despite the insults being thrown his way. “No, not goose. Gosse,” Draco said, putting emphasis on the last word.
“I’m not letting you anywhere near him you lunatic,” Draco spat, holding Harry close to him, shielding him from Lockhart protectively.
Draco was distracted from Theo’s pouting when Harry came up beside him, and said in a voice that only he could hear, “Sirius wrote to me.”
“That’d be Pansy of course,” Harry joked, slouching into the sofa beside Draco and ripping the package open.
Draco stared at him and pursed his lips and without saying anything walked right passed Harry and out his bedroom door.
the one with giggling french girls, harry's head being blown by draco speaking french and jealousy and denial on both sides
“Yeah, I’ll go grab it.” Harry went down the hall and rifled around under the bed in the guest room he’d been sleeping in. Clutching the long parcel he tried to keep his balance as he entered the living room and stepped around presents and gift wrap.
"He's right," Blaise said, agreeing with Draco, yawning as well. "We won't do well if we don't get enough sleep and are exhausted when we're writing the test."
Harry felt a blush rise to his cheeks, looking up at Draco he shrugged. “Well maybe not directly but if they figured it out themselves or asked us…”
Draco let his head fall back down against the bed. “Pomfrey needs to check your head, Potter. You definitely hit it. There are no voices in the walls.” All of a sudden Harry was vaulting back into the bed over Draco’s head. “Wha?”
Just then the other Slytherin boys burst through the door. “Are you the Heir of Slytherin, Harry?” Theo asked.
“Oh get down off your high horse you big wuss. It’s not like I have you shucking corn or peeling potatoes. Your only stirring soup in a pot and making cheese plates.”
His eyes scanned the dancefloor and landed on Draco and Claudette. In the dark he could barely make out ones limbs from the other. Tearing his eyes away he looked at Pansy instead. Her dark eye makeup really made her eyes sparkle, he told her as much. This made her smile.
“Harry, my parents already like you because you’re Harry sodding Potter and everyone likes you. In addition, as much as I hate to admit it, Granger from Gryffindor has better grades than me in most classes.”
On the last day of August the group of them were packed for school and spending their last free hours playing croquet outside on the grounds. Draco wore a light pair of denim jeans and a loose white button up with the sleeves rolled up. Harry was wearing a textured ban-lon shirt with panels of colour down the front with a pair of oakbrook casual slacks. Draco had bought them for him. He’d bought the other boy a lot of new clothes over the summer. Blaise was dressed in his usual immaculate dark pants and shirt. Pansy wore a pretty floral dress that skimmed the grass and had loose sleeves that dipped over her shoulder but cut off just after. Draco wondered if Adam had worn a shirt that matched Pansy’s floral dress on purpose.
Draco decided he wished he hadn’t given it to Harry the moment the other boy pulled it over his head. The feeling of warmth that spread in his chest when he saw Harry wearing his clothing was dangerous. It was too much. Too adorable. But it’s not like he could tell Harry to take it off, that’d raise too many questions that he didn’t feel like answering right now.
“Duh, of course I did, Potter. You didn’t think I just got you a shirt and facemasks did you? But seriously, use the face masks, your skin is absolutely awful, the lot of you. I mean, have any of you ever washed your faces before?”
“Seriously,” said Professor McGonagall. She didn’t look too happy though Harry suspected it was because Gryffindor was out of the running for the cup for the eighth year in a row. Slytherin had a great chance of winning if they won, which Harry was determined to do.
Y’all in this time of lockdown I’ve had plenty of time to become re inspired to finish Raised a Malfoy. Hopefully it doesn't take me as long to post chapter 9 (the final chapter!) as it did for me to post this one. Enjoy!
“I don’t doubt that,” Harry assured, “but it’s best to be safe. What would you like your safe word to be?”
“Good boy,” Harry praised, bringing both his hands back around Draco and running them down his bare chest, “so beautiful, aren’t you?”
“Sir, huh?” Harry asked, pulling on the bud now and reveling in the whimper that left Draco’s lips, “you must really want to touch me. You only call me sir when you give up all your deficiency.”
With that, Draco was kissing him again. Harry was letting him, surprisingly. Perhaps it’s because he thought he was dreaming, or it could be that he messed up a potion earlier and inhaled something that made him insane. Either way, he was letting Draco’s arms snake around his neck and his tongue push into his mouth.
“No hiding. I want to see your face when I cum inside you.” He sped up as he said this, starting to feel the familiar heat coil in his stomach, “Say my name, Malfoy.”
Harry shook his head, but he definitely didn't trust himself to keep quiet with how good Draco was making him feel. His instinct was right because as soon as the silver-haired boy picked up his pace he was failing to hold back a whimper.
“That’s it,” Ron spoke, gripping onto Harry’s slim hips and pulling him back into him on every thrust, “sound so sexy when you moan for us.”
“Let’s play a game,” Draco rushed out, continuing when Harry didn’t shut him down right away, “it’s a simple game, really, it’s called wand roulette.”
“You leave for a year and then you show up on my doorstep at two in the morning expecting a warm welcome? Well, you can go fuck yourself.”
Draco's dirty talk alone could have him cumming right then, but he obeyed and lifted his head. He locked eyes with Draco's silver ones. He wanted nothing more than to wipe the smirk off Malfoy's face, but he was more concerned with getting his release at the moment.
He lifted his head, releasing Malfoy’s hands which fell to his sides. He pets one of his own hands through Draco’s hair, the other landing on his waist. Draco immediately leaned into the touch, grinding down almost unnoticeably onto Harry’s thigh.
Thursday there was Quidditch. It’s a rough game sometimes, Harry knows that, but the actual game isn’t what got to him. It was after the game in the locker room. He had taken the furthest shower from the locker room, wanting to have some peace after a grueling game. He had peace for a little while until he felt ice-cold water being poured on him from above and a too-familiar snicker retreating from his shower as he let out a loud yelp.
“Yeah?” He asked, “You think you could take another cock? Maybe next time I’ll get Ron in here, and right after I’m done, he can have his way with you. Would you like that?”
He stroked a soothing hand over Draco’s shoulder and asked him politely to turn around so he could see him. Draco got up on shaky legs and turned quite ungracefully, plopping back down into Harry’s lap.
“P-Potter, I’m serious, st-stop, I-” He was cut off as a wide stripe was licked over him, a gasp leaving him as Harry began to eat him out.
“Only good boys get to cum, you know.” Harry said as if it was something Draco had been taught when growing up, “and good boys always ask permission. You’re mine, pet. If you want to cum, you’re going to have to ask nicely.”
Harry groaned as Draco expertly went to work, opening him up with his tongue as he used it to push inside the raven-haired boy. Draco got him slick with his tongue, loving the small moans that Potter was letting out. Once he was sure that Harry could take it, he pushed a finger into him, up to the knuckle.
Ron pulled his fingers out, watching as Harry's hole clenched around nothing, ready to be filled again. Ron cursed at the sight, placing his cock there and slowly pushing in.
Harry pretended to think about it for a moment before he leaned down beside Draco’s ear. He held himself at Draco’s entrance with one hand, the other snaking into the blonde’s hair and getting a firm grip on it, pulling his head back so that it was on his shoulder.
He didn’t need to be told twice. As soon as he had permission he was cuming. He came hard inside of Harry, white light blurring his vision until he came back down, panting.
“Now, now,” Draco said, scooting back into Ron’s arms in case Harry decided to choke him this time, “to be fair, that was supposed to go with the robe this morning.”
“You never were good at your greetings,” The other man spoke, making his way inside despite not being invited in, “nothing’s changed in a year, I see.”
“No reason. You didn’t stop by, didn’t send an owl, anything! Three years we spent together and then one day you don’t come home. You never broke up with me. You didn’t even say goodbye, and you want to talk about me being cold? Well, I’m so sorry, am I hurting your feelings, princess?”
Malfoy did his best to suppress his sounds, and he did a good job until Harry whispered something under his breath, and, a moment later, a slick hand wrapped around his semi-hard cock. He let out a strangled gasp that melted into a pleasured grunt as Harry stroked him to full hardness.
Ron placed his lips on Harry’s once again as he came inside him. He pulled out gently as he began to get soft, but his lips never left Harry’s until they were both out of breath.
His best friend was too engrossed in a stack of potion books to notice the two other men in the room. Once again, he was jealous that this was not new to Draco and watched with intent as Draco reached forward and took the book Harry was reading from his hands.
Draco smiled solemnly, gripping Potter's hips and bringing them towards his own. Harry gasped as his back arched off the wall, his hips meeting Malfoy's as the latter leaned in to whisper in his ear.
The other male just stared at him, leaning back against a desk and waiting for Ron to speak. This unsettled Ron somewhat, never knowing the man in front of him to leave any talking room.
Harry could tell that Malfoy was struggling to not move in rhythm with his strokes, and he smirked as he began to twist his fists, eliciting a delightful moan out of the writhing boy. He could see the sweat that glistened on Draco’s collarbone and decided to lean forward, poking his tongue out and tracing the bone with it.
Once he was relaxed enough underneath him, Draco was pushing Harry back onto his bed and sliding down his body. He slid his hands under Harry’s shirt, taking it off of him before moving to his jeans and unbuttoning them.
Draco shrugged, leaning closer and making Harry fight to not get up and physically drag his seat away from the other male.
“What did you call me?” Harry asked, holding Draco down so that he couldn’t continue to move on Harry’s cock.
Draco fell forward onto Harry’s chest as he lost his balance. His cock was leaking now, and he was so close to just cumming and taking the consequences.
Harry shook his head at this, earning a questioning look from the lust-filled eyes of the boy who should have disgusted him by this point.
Instead of seeing his proud Gryffindor emblem, he instead found a silver and emerald green one. The robe he wore was a Slytherin house robe, and it was none other than Draco Malfoy’s. He turned to the Slytherin table, finding that Draco’s eyes were already on him, beaming with something he could only describe as mischief, his lips turned up in an amused smile.
“I feel like you’re trying to say something,” Draco responded innocently, tugging the sleeves of his own robe over his hands to make sweater-paws, “you know you’re always cranky when you oversleep.”
The begging didn’t seem to be of any use, and Draco wasn’t the only one who seemed to notice. As he swatted Draco’s bum once, twice more, he noticed a slight tent in his boxers. He said nothing as he listened to Draco count, “eight, nine.”
“I’m here, your day just got better,” Ron said to Harry before turning to Draco, “and your life just got longer.”
He could see the faint blush on Draco’s cheeks and he savored it, as it was not often that Draco Malfoy blushed. In fact, he wasn’t sure that Draco Malfoy had ever blushed in his entire life. If he had, Harry had never seen it.
“I was bullshitting, of course. I just wanted to get him riled up, you know? He obviously responded to dirty talk, so I took it up a notch. But, oh gosh… Ron you should’ve seen how he reacted to that!”
“Are you going to tell him?” Draco asked, walking around behind Harry where he was now standing, “no? Well, then it’ll be my honor.”
“I wa-nana cum on y-your cock, please!” It was desperate, really, but Ron couldn’t bring himself to feel bad at the moment. Not when Harry looked so fucking hot taking him like he was.
Harry gave him a questioning look, to which Draco just smirked and stood. He untied his robe, taking it off and laying it neatly in the corner of the room.
Thick, white stripes were painting his own abdomen as Draco thrust once, twice more before coming inside of him.
Harry startled once again as he pulled away, looking at Draco wildly. He fumbled with his hands before finally deciding to rest them on Draco’s hips. He looked up at the blonde, waiting for some kind of explanation.
Ron nodded, stepping forward and batting Draco’s hand away. He popped the button on Harry’s jeans, the zipper making a harsh noise as it slid down the metal teeth.
He nuzzled into the side of Draco’s face that was beside his ear. He was praising him and asking how he was,
Tears had gathered in Harry’s eyes by the time he finished and he turned back to the kettle to hide his face as he gingerly wiped them away. He wasn’t even sure he was sad, moreso numb. He took a deep breath as he pulled the kettle from the stove.
Draco didn’t answer, couldn’t answer when Harry was now running his thumbs over his nipples and making them perk up at the attention. They weren’t the only thing, as he cock also gave an interested twitch at the ministrations of Harry now pinching and circling them with soft, sure fingers.
Draco acted quickly, gently blowing on Harry’s face as he began to hiccup. Draco blew gently on his face again, holding Harry’s chin as he whispered to him, “blow on me,” Draco told him, nodding as Harry gave him an odd look but did it anyway.
Harry nodded but made no move as they both froze, the too-familiar sound of heels clicking through the corridor. They jumped apart and practically ran to their seats, sliding into them as Madam Pomfrey opened the door with an exasperated grunt.
"Someone's impatient," Draco tsked, placing the head of his cock back once he was sure Harry would hold still, "is there something you want?"
He built up a pace, changing his angle slightly so that he was hitting his prostate every time he lowered himself.
“You have far too many articles of clothing on. Stand and strip for me. You don’t have to take your time, I’m too much interested in what’s underneath to have to wait.”
Draco obeyed, cumming hard between his stomach and Harry’s. As he squeezed around him, Harry came inside him. He filled him up, some leaking out when he pulled out.
“Wait,” Harry interrupted suddenly, obviously annoying Draco but asking anyway, “what does the winner get?”
Draco could hear Potter’s tone change, and a shiver ran through him as he obeyed. He walked over to Harry, who instructed him to turn his back to him and then straddle him. He followed his orders and tensed when Harry placed a hand on each of his spread thighs.
Draco knew when he had one finger inside because Harry was panting into his mouth. He smirked against Potter’s lips, knowing he probably didn’t even need prep.
Harry threw his head back as a moan left his lips. His eyes shut on their own accord as Ron slid his tongue up and down Harry’s shaft, circling the head before taking him in once again.
He felt Harry tense up when he pulled them off of him. He could imagine that Harry didn’t think he was serious until this moment. He rubbed his thighs soothingly until Harry relaxed under his touch. He let Draco reach into his bedside drawer to grab the potion that served as lube in the wizarding world. (What? It wasn’t exactly his first time sneaking into the Gryffindor rooms.)
"What the hell, Malfoy?" Harry practically seethed as the Slytherin crossed his arms in front of his chest, giving the Gryffindor a once-over.
He was sheepish as he looked at Harry, and he hated feeling so small. “Was I okay?” He asked, sounding unbothered but showing he really wanted to know.
Ron settled down and thought for a moment, “maybe it was more of a squeak? He was caught off guard.”
Draco watches as Harry pours two cups of tea, adding a spoonful of sugar as he likes before sliding it over the countertop towards him, “you still drink tea when you’re upset,” Draco notes, watching the way Harry practically downs the tea like a shot of whiskey.
Harry nodded, not trusting his voice at the moment. To be completely honest, his mind was only producing DracoDracoDraco, and it made him feel a little woozy.
“I was thinking,” Harry started, voice hushed as he spoke beside Draco’s ear, “you never did thank me yesterday. Shame, I’d hate to have to spank you again for that… wouldn’t you?”
Before he knew he was clenching his fists his quill had snapped, earning a glare from the professor. He should have cared that he was on incredibly thin ice with getting kicked out right then and there, but as he watched the way Draco looked back and smirked at him with that proud smirk, he couldn’t be bothered.
Once they had both caught their breath, Draco was pulling out and making sure Harry was stable against the wall before pulling his pants back up and buckling his belt. Harry threw his own clothes on as well before looking shyly in Draco's direction, not exactly knowing where this left them.
They parted immediately, letting Harry press his own thigh against the tent in Draco’s trousers. Harry’s smirk only grew as on the inside he silently celebrated being right.
“Most definitely,” Harry agrees, taking two cups down from the cupboard without particularly realizing it.
It went like this for a while; Harry speeding up and slowing down as Draco let his emotions out into the pillow. Finally, Harry pulled out, only the flip Draco onto his back, making sure his binds flipped along with him to keep him in place.
“I need your help,” Ron stated, not having much time to waste, “I know you’ve seen how Harry is, and I know you know something is up. He’s always so stressed lately and he’s distancing himself. I don’t know what to do.”
Though he didn’t open his eyes, Draco nodded fervently, “yes, please!” He seemed to beg, though neither boy had the heart or will to deny him this time, “want to cum for you, please! Please let me!”
"I want you," was what Harry could manage as he rolled his hips into Malfoy's, earning a surprised sound out of the blonde. "Please, Malfoy,"
Draco lost his words as a smack landed to his backside. It wasn’t a playful smack, either. It was a smack that quite frankly told Draco to shut up. He caught his breath before he dared to turn his head over his shoulder, taking in the stern look on Harry’s face and turning back forward.
Harry didn’t startle near as much as the last time Draco had seen him like this. In fact, he didn’t startle much at all, as if he was expecting someone. Maybe he was.
“You’ll only be down the hall,” Draco reasoned boredly, watching her knit her eyebrows together as she seemed to think it over, “you’ll smell the smoke if we attempt to burn the school down.”
Wednesday there was his homework. Harry had his books tucked tightly under his right arm as he made his way down the turning stairs, moving hurriedly as to not be relocated. As he reached the first hall, he ran into Draco, his books and papers being let go of and landing on the floor. Draco leaned down, snatching a piece of paper from Harry’s loose grasp and smirking as he saw it was the homework for Snape’s class. After tsking that Harry was too soft to survive Snape’s detention he pouted his lip out and walked off, the paper now a ball in his hand.
“Look how well you’re doing, you’re taking all of me” Draco praised, watching the way Harry’s eyes were scrunched closed with pleasure, “you were fucking made to take my cock, weren’t you? Such a slut for it.”
To both of their surprise, Draco moaned. It was quite loud and shameless, and he couldn’t bring himself to care as he wrapped his arms around Potter’s neck in an attempt to bring him closer. He did, their body’s pressed fully against one another now as they explored each other’s mouths.
When he couldn’t hear the click of Pomfrey’s heels anymore, Draco was out of his seat. He walked back a desk, plopping himself on the one Harry had chosen to sit behind. Harry eyed him but said nothing, opting to slump back and wait for Draco to do something to get them both in trouble once again.
“I’m not very nice,” Draco responded, throwing an eyebrow up at Harry as he took in their minimal distance.
Ron pulled off of Harry with a wet ‘pop’ before wiping his mouth where saliva had gathered at the edge of it. Harry’s chest rose and fell as he gained his breath back.
Draco shook his head, placing one of his arms above Harry's head, resting his hand on the wall behind him. The other made it's way to the red sweater Harry had chosen to wear, running his nimble ringers up the smaller man's chest and taking in the way his breath caught in his throat.
Harry smirked as Draco entered the room, black robe drawn tight to his body as he closed the entrance way. He looked around, as if Harry would blindside him as soon as he walked inside.
“Remember your safe word?” Harry asked as he placed a hand on the back of Draco’s head and stroked his hair.
“Before you go,” Harry quipped, a loud sound in the silent room, “I’d propose another game… Tomorrow?”
Harry was on fire. Sweat was pooling on his forehead and his body was already slick with it. But that’s not what he was focused on.
Harry was pleased as he landed two more slaps in succession, listening as Draco answered a “three… four.” He landed the fifth one too soon after and managed to make Draco squirm as he hit the same spot he had previously.
“No?” Harry asked, changing his angle and hitting Draco’s prostate, making the other boy yell out and squirm around, “Looks like someone’s not having such a bad time after all,” Harry said as he watched the way Draco’s own cock began to fill up, “such a fucking slut you are.”
Harry’s words were anything but sweet as he relayed them to Draco, but Draco couldn’t find it in himself to be offended. He stood and quickly shed his clothes, opting to leave his underwear on but shedding them too when Harry made a sound of disapproval.
Draco gave him a soft smile and nodded as he carefully slipped into Harry. He started slow, running his fingertips along Potter’s thighs as to help him relax, but Harry simple shook his head and pushed his hips down once again.
Harry slowed down only a tad as he leaned forward, taking one of Draco’s nipples between his pointer and forefinger and rolling the bud gently, “what’s that, love?”
Draco let his wand fall into his hand and gave Harry a pointed look, to which Harry just chuckled and cast a spell. Draco watched as one of the needles went up into a puff of pink smoke, a vial of amortentia left in its place.
Draco’s lips tug up in a small smile at the comment, “not particularly, but you do look quite handsome standing there.” He coughs to clear his throat when Harry gives him a solemn look, “I came to apologize.”
