“The pleasure is mine, I am sure,” Nikola replied. His accent was heavy, but he seemed to know English well enough. Once he finished shaking hands with Lucius, he turned his attention to Draco and smiled. It was a pleasant smile. An innocent smile. “And you are?”
Approaching them was Mr. Potter and his ever-present companion, Ms. Granger, who wore a long navy blue dress which suited her nicely. She had not changed dramatically since school, Draco noted.
A smile crept across her face, showing her wrinkles. She sat forward a bit, her dress suit rustling against the fabric of the ottoman. “You really should be more careful who you bring home in future.”
“I’m just saying, it’s sort of impressive. How many other wizards do you know that have control of their magic like that? Sure, he’s a tosser, but he is good at what he does.”
He looked over his shoulder towards the road. Cars whizzed by in the rain, cabbies picked up drunk people who were all but oblivious to the fact that London’s Nightclub Killer just walked out of the same club they’d been partying in.
“Come on, Draco, let’s do this. We can move into Grimmauld Place. What the hell, right? It’s technically just as much your home as it is mine. We can live together, and I can wake up early because you hate to, and I’ll make you breakfast and coffee every day. I’ll get better at making coffee, I swear. And you can still do your probation, and we can be together, and you can study to be a Potions Master. And we can have a future together.”
“Depends,” Harry said between two deep breaths. “Where are we on the whole ‘should I or shouldn’t I’ thing?”
“Um. Definitely,” Harry said, grimacing. “Hermione is beautiful, but she is practically my sister. I think if she tried this, it would have made me likely to never study again. I am much, much happier with my new tutor.”
She shook her head. “No, when did you begin having visions. Not these specific ones, but in general. How old were you?”
“So, some Life Energy must taste better than others, like say wizards versus Muggles, and if she’s not a picky eater anymore…” Harry trailed off, letting Malfoy put the pieces together.
Kreacher smirked. “A woman.” And with that he popped back out of the hallway and up to his room, the attic. I could hear him mumbling something and stomping around the room.
Draco cut Potter off before he could finish. “Yes, the potion was supposed to make us immune to the Succubus by amping up whatever attraction we already had for someone, like a sort of mental block. If you acknowledged those feelings, or accepted them, then the effects wouldn’t be as strong. Or at least, they would be strong, but you’d be able to control them. If you denied them, or they were being blocked somehow then it would be worse.”
Harry smirked and walked over to Draco. He placed his hands on the wall on either side of Draco, licked his lips and moved so he was almost kissing Draco. “I think we…were…right…about…here,” Harry said and in between each word he kissed Draco anywhere but the lips. His neck. His cheek. His nose. Finally, landing a soft kiss on Draco’s lips.
“Gin, not here, yeah? Nev and Luna are celebrating. We can have it out about Draco later if you really want.”
My voice came out soft. I felt tears threatening to fall. “I saved him. I did what I did to save him.”
Flashes of the man lying dead filled my mind. He was screaming. Begging for his life. Then it shifted and I saw him hovering over me, black ooze pouring from his eyes and mouth. His hand outstretched, reaching down to me. He tried to say something but more ooze fell from his mouth like a waterfall.
“I could wear a dress if that helps,” Harry huffed out, forcing himself to laugh. If he didn’t laugh, he might do something stupid like kiss those obnoxiously pouty lips.
Amid the chaos, Draco managed to keep an eye on Potter and his friends. They were easy to spot thanks to the cluster of red heads that followed Potter around like lost crups. It still seemed to Draco, that Potter was the ring-leader, even when drinking. He got everyone shots and begged them to do them. Once over the music, which came from an enchanted gramophone, Draco heard Potter shout to Granger who seemed to be refusing yet another shot—“
A soft chuckle came from the Succubus. “Mm, did desert follow me home? Oh, I remember you. My little sour milk. Have you come for more?” Her voice hit Harry like a brick to his gut, and he felt paralysed. It was still the husky voice he heard before, only it sounded displaced coming from her haggard mouth.
Ron took the newspaper back and tossed it in the bin. He was quiet for a moment and then turned to me, patting me on the shoulder. “Things just need to calm down a bit. Just a bit fresh in people’s minds. It’s only been two months. Everyone needs time. That’s all.”
It was impressive, really. Potter managing to keep his anger all these months. Draco would almost be impressed if he weren’t so annoyed. It was his job, after all, to make sure Potter’s morale was gone. And Potter made this job nearly impossible. Yet, Draco persisted at the bequest of the The Dark Lord because though he would never voice it, he feared the rise of Potter and his compatriots, even knowing most of them had been captured.
He grinned. “You haven’t even seen the best part yet.” He moved to the side and ushered us inside. “Everyone is out back in the garden.”
“I am not indifferent. I am simply…” Draco paused, searching for a word. His brain would not supply him with one. Well, not one that would help his case.
Draco licked his bottom lip as he took a breath. “Okay, well, say I kiss you and we both feel nothing? It would’ve been ridiculous that we even tried. It would probably make things awkward between us, and I’ve grown used to having you around. I don’t want that to change.”
“Harry Potter, Saviour of the Universe, fancy seeing you down here of all places,” a drawling voice called to me from the stairs leading down to the dungeons.
Hermione and Neville both laughed. It made me feel good for a moment, being with them, being at Hogwarts with my friends. I tried to enjoy it, but it faded just as quickly as it came about. I died here. I literally died out on the spot where the memorial was being held. I think people forget that. They see me standing and smiling and all-around alive and forget that I died in that battle and sometimes, I am not sure if all of me came back.
“Are you okay?” she asked, pushing into the bathroom with me and locking the door behind her. She didn’t wait for an answer before she was holding my head in her hands and looking at my eyes.
I turned to face Neville and saw a little bit of my own feelings reflecting back at me though his eyes. He’d tried to make it a joke, but I could sense the undercurrent of sadness. “Nev, you’re insane if you don’t think this many people love you. You’re one of the best people I know.”
Draco felt the weight of the moment as it sank through him, filling him with a warmth low in his groin. He needed to do something else, something that would keep Potter’s eyes off of him until he was sure he could breathe properly again.
I knew it was going to be a hard sell for them. Skeeter was notorious for publishing half-truths and outright lies. Her
Looking around the Great Hall, which was adorned with all manner of Christmas decorations, Malfoy’s jaw clenched. The tension was so visible, Harry momentarily found himself worrying for the state of Malfoy’s teeth. He could hear Hermione’s voice telling him about her parents patients who would grind their teeth. The stories always ended with people having to get dentures. Harry tried to picture Malfoy with dentures and almost laughed.
Then everything went hazy as Draco did what he did best, tore the rest of Harry’s clothes off and brought him to the edge of pleasure.
Draco didn’t respond. His mouth fell open and his cheeks flushed, but he didn’t respond. Harry was afraid that after this, Draco would never speak to him again, but Harry was also afraid that if he did nothing, that moment between them last night would be lost forever. With school coming to an end and effectively ending their midnight matches, he needed to act.
“Really?” Harry laughed, feeling relieved. Draco wanted to kiss him. It wasn’t a joke. Only his pride kept him from crashing forwards and capturing Draco in a kiss right then. “So all that deliberation over what you should and shouldn’t do…and it’s over boring old me?”
“All right, this is what’s going to happen,” Robards took out his wand and pointed at Ron. “I am going to cast two Obliviate’s so when they check my wand it will look like I already wiped your memories. Then if the Unspeakables really do wipe my memory, at least you two will still be cognizant.”
However, reality hit him hard when Potter stumbled out of the bathroom a minute later and walked past Draco without a second glance. He tossed back the contents of a vial and slipped the empty in his pocket.
The only small blessing of the day was that his partner hadn’t taken the empty chair next to him as an invitation to whisper passive-aggressive comments at him during the meeting. However, that did leave it open for his best friend, Ron Weasley, who made his way into the room and straight for the empty chair at Harry’s side. He sat down with an ‘oof’ and nudged Harry with his elbow.
“Your suggestion about adjusting the amount of bitter root to snowdrop ratio is what got me into the last phase.” Malfoy extended his hand and Hermione took it. They shook once and then released.
“Well, I thought it was Ginny, too. I mean, she’s loved me since we were kids. She’s beautiful, and strong. I’d be lucky to marry someone like her. But...it’s different than it was before. I’m different than I was before.”
“And in the process got yourself benched and awaiting a hearing to see if you are still allowed to do your job. How many other people do you think you could have saved in the last few months if you’d handled that case differently?”
“Potter and Malfoy have been working to track the Succubus’ movements through the city and found it only comes out after sundown, and frequents popular nightclubs and bars for its victims,” Robards said. He spared a breath to eye both Malfoy and Harry, then added, “It took some time to put it all together since the Muggle law enforcement didn’t hand over all their files at once, but Malfoy managed to write up a summary report of all we know about this particular Succubus.”
“Oh, shut up, Reed. Let’s hope the ethics board isn’t soft on him like our Minister for Magic,” Lamont said. “He should have fired him, not put him on desk duty looking into the uptick in illegal magical surges. That’s what drove him to kick the guys arse in the first place. Putting him on those cases seems like an odd sort of punishment.”
I forced myself to relax my hand in his, letting my fingers soften against his skin. I could hear my heart beating furiously as if I had just pulled a wronski feint to grab the snitch and win the game. I watched Malfoy’s face as we stood there, hands still touching and realized the spell had faded around us. I didn’t pull my hand away and neither did Malfoy. He watched me with those dark-gray eyes that were like standing at the edge of a storm. They were tempting and dangerous and I was afraid I would drown in them if I wasn’t careful.
Draco fought against every instinct that told him this was a bad idea and opened the door to Potter’s room with Nikola close behind. He found Potter sleeping. Curled up in a corner like an abandoned dog. Immediately, Draco moved to kick him awake, but stoped himself. Potter might be less agitating if he was not provoked.
Tilting his head to the side, Harry decided to instigate Malfoy further. “What song was that supposed to be anyway?”
“Come on,” Harry said, knocking Draco’s knee with his own. He didn’t want to come across too eager, but he was dying to know what Draco thought he shouldn’t do. “Out with it. This is a festival for good fortune next year. Can’t start that off with a lie. Not after we just jumped over a mythical fire. It’s gotta be bad luck or something.”
His teeth clattered together. It was an especially cold night, but the snow fall and wind made it moreso. Usually, Harry enjoyed seeing the grounds covered in snow. It was like the picturesque landscape inside of a snow globe—perfect and quiet. However, with the wind screaming past his earmuff-less ears, Harry quite thought he hated the snow-covered grounds.
“What?” Harry asked in a whisper. There were plenty of people that could see Malfoy with his wand. It was bad enough that they were still in their robes; they didn’t need to stand out anymore.
I watched the air near his wand for something like the golden dust I’d seen come from the potion. After a moment, I saw a blueish light lingering in the air around him with a small wisp leading back to his wand. It was more solid-looking than the trace from the potion. Maybe potions and spells present differently because they are different kinds of magic.
Hermione and Ron had been helping him avoid some of the more aggressive fans who had surfaced after the article. People had begun waiting outside Grimmauld Place, or in spots where they knew Harry frequented. Basically, he was resorting to glamours and charms until he got into work.
“Get yourself together, Potter. We have a Succubus to find.” Draco wanted nothing more than to stand there and watch the pulse in Potter’s neck as his heart beat, watching his chest heave up with each strained breath, but Draco also knew that the longer he let himself indulge in those feelings, the worse the potion would affect him, and he was already having a hard enough time ignoring how his body reacted to Potter.
After a few moments, Draco realized that somehow he let himself drift back into Mr. Potter. Their elbows brushed and the small touch sent a wild thrill through Draco’s body. It seemed to search for an appropriate place to lodge itself and settled for his stomach.
A laugh, thick and warm like honey, bubbled out of Potter. Soft and understanding. Draco wrung his hands for something to do other than take off at a sprint for the exit. This was the most unsettled he’d felt in quite a while.
I tipped it back and chased it with the coffee, which only made the taste worse somehow, and winced as it went down. Despite the unpleasant taste, I felt better. Less like my head was working to separate from my body.
stamped across the front in black ink. “Take some time today to go over what Malfoy collected. It is thoroughly researched and organised.”
I wanted to lose myself for a little while and sex worked for me, well that and alcohol but like an idiot I left that at home. Those were probably a few of the reasons Ginny and I didn’t work out. She wanted a commitment, a life together, and I just wanted someone to fuck the memories of the last seven years out of me. I wanted to forget.
“So, you’re my perfect match, then. The fires have spoken,” Draco said, laughter in his words, as he sat down on the bench. “Guess that figures; I spent most of my life thinking about you, though most of the time, I
“Do your adoring fans know all the bad, bad stuff you’ve been up to lately, Mr. Golden Boy?” Malfoy asked, his posh voice cutting through my revere. He stepped down off the last stair and smirked. “Nothings popped up in the
“Hey, aren’t you supposed to be at some fancy dinner with your parents?” Harry asked, genuinely curious. The last year had been one weird thing after the other, including, but not limited to, his newfound friendship with Draco. He knew the Malfoys had planned a formal evening as a charity event to pay reparations as part of their post-war probation.
Robards grabbed the box and nodded. “Good. But don’t think that means you two are off the hook for engaging with the perp after I specifically told you not to. There will be desk duty in both of your futures.” He turned to look at Potter once again and sighed. “And Auror Malfoy, get your partner to St. Mungo’s so he can get that cut seen to.”
When I first found out who I was that day in Diagon Alley, I thought how nice it was to finally have some attention after the Dursley’s and the small scraps they tossed at me. I’d liked it. Hogwarts was a different story though. I couldn’t even shower without someone coming in to spy on me. To see The Boy Who Lived. No where except my dorm was safe from prying eyes. It grew worse the older I got. Some of the attention was sexual and that made me uncomfortable, but it went deeper than that. It was the eyes. They followed me, always watching. I couldn’t exist without someone looking at me. The worst part was when I realized Voldemort could see me—see through my own eyes. Even alone I was being watched. After that, any attention I got completely soured and all it did was make me taste bile.
“No, that’s not why I’m here,” I whispered. I felt a heat spreading though my body thinking about how he stood me up last night. ‘There's a guest room.’ Merlin, this was embarrassing. He didn’t even speak to me the rest of the party and I hated to admit that it stung.
At Harry’s words, there was a collective gasp from the crowd watching them, the sound like a flock of birds taking off at once. Behind him, there was a shriek that sounded an awful lot like Hermione and an awkward laugh that had Ron written all over it. His mates must have caught up with him.
Potter’s face got serious all of a sudden. He seemed to agree with Draco, but did not want to admit it. “Don’t worry, I’ll protect you. That is my potions partners promise.” Potter raised his right hand and straightened his back, looking all official and said, “I swear it. No harm will come to the sole reason I am passing Potions this semester. Come on.”
“Well, last night was set in place to remedy those missteps, as you know. The Dark Lord received word early this morning that Nikola was pleased with his visit and spoke highly of you to the Russian Minister. So much so, that he is requesting a meeting with you himself.”
I sat up and brushed the dirt off my arms. The only thing that really hurt was my back and I was pretty sure that was just from sleeping on the floor of my own living room last night after I told Hermione and Ron all about the visions and seeing my mother at Dean and Seamus’s party.
“It’s the way you say it.” Potter pulled Draco’s hand to his lips. He did not kiss Draco’s hand, but instead rested Draco’s fingers against his lips. Then he whispered, “Sometimes, I get hard just hearing your voice.”
Everything about my feeling’s regarding Malfoy was a contradiction. He agitated me. He excited me. He made me angry, but he also made me feel more awake than I had since the war. I was drawn to him. I’d been drawn to him my whole life and somehow those feelings of rage, disgust, had morphed into desire.
“That won’t be a problem. No blocking here,” Potter said, his voice a bit unsure. Or at least, Draco could have sworn he sounded unsure, but then again, that was wishful thinking on his part.
“Well, I better…” Draco started, but trailed off as he outstretched his fisted hand to Harry, palm up.
“Because…” Draco considered saying ‘because I want this partnership to work out,’ but he decided on, “We are partners, and that’s what partners do.”
Malfoy reached me first despite his improper footwear. He always had been fast. “What is it?” He sounded out of breath, too, but he didn’t show any visible signs of being winded.
“That’s probably the all the rest,” I said with a smile. I didn’t feel rested. I felt depleted like a used up battery. I placed the present under my arm, mirroring Ron.
“Well, she’s right,” I said. That earned me a smug hrumph from Hermione that seemed to tell me Ron didn’t agree with her.
Malfoy laughed. “I half expected some contrived seer response like ‘I see all.’ It’s nice to know all you divination types aren’t as obnoxious as Trelawney had been.”
Draco’s specific task was to practice wandless and wordless magic on them. Torture them. Gain any intelligence he could on remaining rebels. In short, he was an interrogator. And he enjoyed torturing his captives. He took pleasure in it. And how could he not? After Hogwarts, after the embarrassment of being bested by Potter and his mates regularly. Finally, he would be able to show them his superiority. They would soon understand that he, Draco, was better than them in every conceivable way. He relished the idea of rubbing it in Potter’s face that he lost. That after all that pomp and circumstance that surrounded their tenure at school, everyone had placed their bet on the wrong pony.
Malfoy didn’t move; only his chest rising and falling rhythmically let me know he hadn’t spontaneously turned into a statue. He looked straight ahead at the party. The look on his face was a mixture of pure agony and amusement.
Harry returned with a cocksure smile. He felt his face get hot when Draco only rolled his eyes and scoffed before pulling on his broom and heading the opposite direction.
At his side, Pansy sighed again. Her body next to his was familiar and he felt himself gaining his composure back in increments. Social events had always been the hardest thing for him after the war, as Pansy was well aware. All the people. All the pretending. It was wholly due to Pansy that Draco managed to get through them at all, so when she left him alone his mask started to slip away to reveal the unpleasantness within—the unpleasantness that was sure to convince Mr. Potter that Draco was unworthy of his attentions.
After they were settled in the embrace, Malfoy’s arms snaked around Harry’s neck and Harry’s around Malfoy’s middles. Malfoy did something Harry hadn’t expected, he smiled into the kiss. The warmth that escaped from his mouth covered Harry’s. He found himself smiling, too. And then laughing. They both laughed, never parting.
Near the coffin, a circle of black and red candles were arranged in a pattern with one white candle in the middle. All but one of them were lit despite the damp breeze that rolled in through all the small crevices and cracks in the old stone walls. Harry noticed six of them were lit. Six. Like the six victims. Like the six Ley Lines leading to the nexus. The wax rolled down the sides of the candles, hitting the stone and trickling inward to meet in the middle of the circle where the sole white candle waited unlit. He wagered once the middle one was lit, whatever spell the Succubus had been working on would be in full effect. And he’d bet his last Galleon that she needed to make the final kill here to activate the nexus.
“I’d probably call it a gulp, but yes,” Harry said, placing his now empty cup on the ground in front of him.
“You know,” Potter said, his voice breaking through Draco’s reverie, “You could have just come to check out the clubs without an invitation from me. Not everything needs to be filed out in triplicate and submitted to Head Auror Robards for approval. I wouldn’t have trusted that you’d call me, I would’ve just been there. Paperwork isn’t our job, catching bad guys is.”
Sipping from his drink, Potter walked around to where Draco stood at the edge of the table. He nudged Draco in the side and asked, “So do you?”
All the time, Nikola would not detach his gaze from Draco. This was to be expected. If there was one thing Draco knew about himself, without any shadow of doubt, it was that he was attractive. Not just normally attractive, either. No, he was
“Get it together, Harry,” he mumbled as he passed yet another empty mausoleum. Well, empty wasn’t the right word. There were dead people and a decent amount of insects making their homes in the stone structures, but no sign of the Succubus.
At Hogwarts, Ron ran off to find Hermione who was setting up the stage for revealing the memorial structure she had commissioned for the five year anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts. That left me sitting in the teachers lounge drinking tea at a small circular table with Neville Longbottom, who started on as Herbology Professor when Sprout retired last year.
“Yeah, probably best,” Harry agreed and released Draco’s wrist. He stood there a moment, processing what Draco had asked him before he made his way over to Ginny and Hermione.
“You’re in pretty good shape for someone whose head is so far up their arse they run into a dangerous forest chasing down what is shaping up to be a murderer, apparently.”
A loud crack of thunder made Harry jump, and then the lit candles flickered, flames reaching for the sky in tall orange columns. The one in the middle that was unlit stayed that way, making Harry curious. The flicker of the flames cast shadows all about the room, making him feel like he was at a campfire about to roast marshmallows. All of a sudden his mind was flooded with images of Malfoy: his white-blond hair mussed up after a practice duel, the hard line of his cheekbones, the mysterious grey of his eyes that seemed to grow stormy when he was concentrated, the curve of his Cupid’s bow lips when he smirked.
He was not going to switch with Thomas or Finagean. He had seen their idea of cleanliness after sharing a common room with them all year and dreaded the idea of wearing clothes that smelled like they had never been washed properly.
But it was too late, Potter managed to drag Draco away from the drinks table, leaving the shattered glass on the deck where it fell. They crossed the party and a few people gawked at them. The Beauxbaton’s boy, who Draco suspected was the whooping charm culprit, very audibly said “
Levy, one of the chasers, was busy hitting on any girl who would pay attention to him long enough. And since all of the recreational quidditch teams were invited to these parties, there were a lot of women who Levy could strike out with.
She was a quiet witch as far as I knew. Not that I spoke to her much. She was one of the many Harry Potter fans who beamed at me regularly when I came through training. Always asking me out. I tended to avoid those people as best I could. They only liked the celebrity of me, not the actuality of me.
Many of them found his silky pale skin reminded them of the first snowfall—pure, untouched. Others attributed his beauty to the striking white-blond hair which made them think of mystical creatures like the Sirens in Greek Mythology, pulling them into his trap—mesmerized. And of course, there was his slim build. It made him androgynous. He was tall and toned, but not overly so and this meant when he let his hair get long, he looked very feminine.
Harry did his best to keep from sounding nervous. “My point is, if we jump together and hold hands the whole way over without breaking apart…it means we would make a good couple. They say, if you can jump over holding hands the whole time, then that’s the person who’s your perfect match.” When Draco didn’t respond, Harry quickly added, “According to the very silly myth, of course.”
Hermione sat back again, letting her hands flop in her lap. “Okay, say what Skeeter says is true. What does that mean?”
The trio head back to Harry’s flat to discuss what they know. Harry tells them about his odd visions.
“Potter, why are you undressing?” Draco asked, completely scandalized. His mouth hanging open. A slight blush coloring his cheeks.
“That’s fair,” Draco said honestly. It was true. The prophet did more harm than good. If anyone else knew that, it was Draco. After the war, they eviscerated Draco and his family and revealed the location of the Manor. This resulted in more hate mail than Draco had ever thought possible and more than a few people trespassing and getting lost in the gardens and maze after being hit with the Confundus charms surrounding the grounds. He hadn’t been living there for some time when it all happened, but when he read about it, he tried to owl his mother. She never responded.
And so, another sort of match grew from there. Not only were they chasing the snitch—they were chasing each other. A battle of wills, of pure unadulterated stubbornness to be better than one another in every way. It reminded Harry of the muggle game Dudley played with his mates. It was called HORSE and it was basketball, but everyone had to make the same shots. Each shot grew more difficult or convoluted in attempt to make one’s opponent mess up.
Shaking the thought of how much money Luna could save on parchment if she wrote smaller, Harry refocused and felt his stomach tie in knots. It was bad enough he was going to have an exclusive tell-all article printed in the Prophet, but the fact that everyone seemed to know things that he had thought were secret; well, that was starting to worry him, “Did Ginny tell you?”
“Occasionally, I do get information from you that benefits the Dark Lord, so it’s all in a days work. I don’t expect a muggle like you to understand the honor bestowed upon me and my family,” Draco spouted the company line at Granger, not that he believed it.
Relief washed over Draco in that moment. He felt it flood his entire body. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He smiled and then answered in his best haught tone, “In polite society, it is unacceptable to respond after more than a fortnight; however, I could be inclined to revisit my invitation.”
“Come off it. Everyone is good at parties. Just got to get a bit more whiskey in you and you’ll be singing the pirate jaunts along with Seamus in no time.”
“Black, like smoke. It starts here and then there is a trail to the forest.” I pointed to the spot in the tree line where the black disappeared behind the foliage.
"It is. I just wanted to give you a shot to back out without looking like a prat when you inevitably lose,” Harry said with a smug, satisfied smile on his face. Maybe the firewhiskey was fueling this a little bit, but Harry had been dying to broach this topic with Malfoy all year.
Mouth dry, Harry dropped his hands with more effort than he would ever admit and dusted off his robes. Malfoy did the same, though he hadn’t been kneeling in the dirt as Harry had.
“You’re right. We follow the magic. Track the patterns.” I brushed the rest of the dirt off my pants and picked up my wand which was in the dirt just in front of the tombstone. I don’t know why it didn’t occur to me to read the stone sooner, but I read it now and felt my stomach flip. The name on it was Frank Longbottom Sr.
That was all it took and Draco pulled away shaking, his face and lips pink. His hair tousled, his nipples erect. Harry considered forgetting the whole thing in favor of kissing and licking lines down Draco’s chest, but shook his head. “Can you please say something?”
Quickly, Harry wrapped one hand around Draco, pulling him close. He heard Draco let out a small gasp, but saw that he wore delighted smile. “One more firm request?”
“Exactly.” Draco tilted his head to the side and gave Harry a face that seemed to scream ‘Really, Potter?’ Then he folded his arms across his chest, slouched down until his head laid on the back of the bench. His long, slender legs outstretched in front of him, practically hitting the edge of the nearest bonfire.
Draco fought the urge to tap his foot in impatience. Instead, he let himself steal a look at his father who stood regally at his side. His white-blond hair was slicked back and fell in cascades down the length of his back. His robes were black silk and embroidered with small golden leaves. His cane was made of redwood and bore an intricate design of snakes slithering and twining themselves around one another.
Merlin, everything was so messed up. I was so messed up and I had been since that first fight against Quriell, I just didn’t know it then because I never had time to slow down. There was always another life or death situation waiting around the corner. Another mystery to throw myself into and no one questioned it, no one noticed every little bit of me I sacrifed because I was saving their lives. I was Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World and no one ever cared that that was killing me way before Voldemort ever actually did.
“Harry, you okay?” Neville asked and crossed the room so he was standing directly in front of Harry, who was still nervously shuffling the Exploding Snap cards.
In the dim cone of light from the lantern, Harry could just make out the star shaped leaves of one of the plants on the list Snape had given Hagrid. He stalked off toward it, casting a
The door to the greenhouse swung open and Harry smelled the perfume of the blooming flowers, and for a moment, it felt like springtime. He looked to see who had decided to brave the cold, and was greeted by the soft smile of the man of the hour, Neville Longbottom. “Harry, mate, thought that was you. What are you doing out here pacing like a madman? It’s beyond freezing.”
When the lights flicked back on, I was staring in mirror at my mother’s reflection. Her auburn hair flowing around her as if she were underwater. Her eyes were black orbs and a dark ooze flowed out of her mouth. It was just like the dead man in the cemetery. I swirled around but there was nothing behind me and when I looked at the mirror again, she was gone.
“Why are you sulking in the dungeons when the Harry Potter parade is about to start? Don’t you know all your adoring fans are waiting?” Malfoy asked. He stayed on the last step, not making any attempt to move closer to me.
George, who was in the middle of sipping his drink, coughed loudly and pounded a fist on his chest at my words. “Merlin, umm, I think I hear Charlie calling my name. Bye.”
“Now, that we have all said our hellos, I think I will have a drink, Lucius,” the Dark Lord said and headed down the hallway to the sitting room. Draco watched as he seemed to glide over the marble floor like the ghosts he encountered at Hogwarts.
“Maybe I would have, maybe not. You never gave me the chance, Potter. If we are going to work together, be partners, you have to be honest with me.”
I knelt down in front of him. I cupped his face and stroked my thumb under his eye, wiping away tears and sweat before I could think about What that might mean. “Neither do I.”
“You’re no fun today,” Malfoy whined. He turned away from me and headed toward the door to the back of the shop. He didn’t turn around or indicate that I should follow him, but I did it anyway.
Malfoy let out a deep sigh. He looked around again and I didn’t like the look on his face. “I suppose I underestimated my own feelings and overestimated yours.”
An odd feeling of calm washed over Harry as the potion settled. The line for a Portkey was long but moving quick enough. They could Apparate—in fact, Malfoy had suggested it for expediency—but Harry knew it would be too dangerous for him after the Succubus feasted on his Life Energy. He wasn’t fully recovered, so it would be like Apparating drunk and blind, he would splinch for sure. And since he couldn’t tell Malfoy the truth, because he would undoubtedly cite protocol and insist that Harry see a healer before they went out, he lied and said it would be better to save their energy for a potential fight. It wasn’t a total lie anyway, he
“Hey, it’s not my fault that you finally found a study technique that works on me.” Harry had to force himself from reaching a hand out to glide over the ripples of Draco’s stomach. After a hot streak of getting answers right, Harry had Draco down to his socks and his pants. “It just happens to be the one that gets you naked.”
We stood at the entrance to the cemetery just in case they needed to get me back to the shop quickly. Malfoy could apparate us, but not from inside the cemetery. It was illegal to appatate in the Hogsmeade Cemetery because of the historical significance and the fact that they often had looters in the late 1800’s trying to make off with family heirlooms. Seems Hogsmeade’s history was a lot more interesting than I was led to believe in Flitwick’s class. Funny how history is just history until it got in the way.
It felt wrong. Seeing her there. She was painted in her gardens. Seated at the table where she spent so much of her free time. Her dress was ivory and flowing down to her ankles. The sleeves reached down past her wrists and steepled into a point stopping at her knuckles. The neckline was swooped and exposed her collarbone and a string of pearls that shone in the false light of the portrait-version of the garden. Her hair was wrapped in an elaborate bun of braids at the nape of her neck. A few strands left free to flutter in the wind. The greenery behind her oscillated between the green buds of spring and the vibrant blossoms of summer.
before I get a Bat-Bogey Hex tossed my way.” He nodded over Harry’s shoulder to where Ginny and Hermione stood. Ginny was watching them carefully. She didn’t look happy at all.
“Well, it’s about the magical surges. Something I believe you have an interest in, if the papers are to be believed.”
They ran the short distance to the fire and leapt at the same time over the flames. Harry felt heat at his ankles but other than that, all he focused on was the laugh coming from Draco as they bounded over the fire to land on the other side.
The twisted smile returned to her face, shattering a bit more of her hold on Harry. His head still felt clouded, but he managed to shout, “
“Sorry, mate. You said Dare and now you have to do a dare,” Weasley answered and Draco thought he sounded a bit too happy about it.
, Harry thought. He needed to refocus and remember that Malfoy wanted him. That Malfoy fancies him, so all he has to do is get Malfoy to kiss him which shouldn't be too hard since he knows the git wants to do it.
“He finds me barely tolerable as was made clear from his behavior after the trial and with, not one, but two refusals for dinner. It is only that this ball is so mundane and filled with boring Ministry officials that he even desired to shower me with his attentions. I can no more see him happy to stand at my side than I can see myself happy to be with a man whose pride gets in the way of such politeness as accepting a dinner invitation. He is quite possibly the last man on earth I could ever truly see myself with.”
My interest was piqued at the mention of Hogsmeade. That’s where the adult surges and grave vandalizations happened. Maybe I could slip away and look into it. “Hogsmeade, right. I forgot they moved there.”
Draco’s family status was once rivaled by none, but had been greatly de-escalated after the war—his finances gone, his titles removed. And if not for Mr. Potter speaking at his trial, Draco would surely be rotting in a cell.
He didn’t look for Draco. He focused on the snitch. And when he stretched out his right hand, he did not anticipat any interference.
.” He couldn't believe he actually said Potter. Out of everyone there...he said Potter. He had meant to say Granger. He was going to say Granger. Instead he said Potter.
“Next week is good. I’ll owl with my schedule and we can set something up, yeah?” The excitement in her voice was apparent.
“I heard Hermione scream,” Potter said through gritted teeth. “What did you do to her? I swear if you hurt her, I will—”
Draco’s lips quirked into a smirk. “How very thorough of you.” His fingers drummed on Harry’s neck, still holding his head steady.
The cemetery was old. That much was apparent from its grandiose stone and iron gateway. It was also one of the few wizarding cemeteries in the middle of London, so the fact that it was a nexus of Ley Lines wasn’t at all surprising. The stone was covered in ivy, giving the whole thing a gothic, mystic feel. Staring at the gate, Harry almost felt like once he stepped through them, he would be stepping into another realm. There were all manner of tombstones, some newer made from granite or slick stone, but most were made from old stone and had partial names and faded dates on them.
“No?” There was shock all over Draco’s face. Shock and betrayal. He arched an eyebrow at Harry. “What do you mean ‘no’?
When I turned back around, Dean and Seamus were holding hands and ushering people inside the house after Ron whispered something in their ear.
She cooed softly like a mother shushing a child, promising there were no monsters under the bed. “I can sense it, a block in your Life Energy. You won’t allow yourself to feel love, why?”
“Potter, you’re making a scene,” Draco said, his voice barely audible. His eyes were flitting around, taking in the size of the crowd that surrounded them. Harry couldn’t make himself care that everyone was watching. Nothing new there.
Quickly, he cast a silencing charm on his room and locked his door. He had some time before dinner, so he let himself picture Potter on his knees, in his binds, sucking and licking. His already achingly hard cock was throbbing by the time he yanked his trousers to the floor and wrapped a cool hand around himself. With each pull, he felt the heat in his stomach coil—building and building, until the heat exploded forth as he whispered Potter.
. Even Voldemort being in power can’t change that about you. No amount of perceived power will make you stronger than me, you arrogant, insufferable, miserable little cock.”
“You’re beautiful, Draco,” he repeated, this time smirking at Draco they way he would if he caught the snitch seconds before Draco could. He hoped Draco understood the meaning—the unspoken part of it all that said:
It wasn’t until the Dark Lord spoke about Potter that Draco snapped to attention. “Yes, it is a great victory to have captured such a nuisance. I believe that having the wizarding world know I posses their last hope helps to keep them compliant.”
The crowd cheered in a roar so loud, so booming, that Harry had only ever heard its like at the Quidditch World Cup. It seemed like everyone was in a good mood, except for him. It seemed that everyone was also in a relationship, except for him. Hell, it seemed like everyone was ready for their future—except for him.
Draco moved toward the door to chase after his partner, but Pansy grabbed his forearm. She gave him a soft, concerned look. “You need to be more careful than him. You’ve had feelings for him for a long time. That could manifest in the potion in unforeseen ways.”
Draco, hoping to lighten the mood a bit, plastered his best lopsided grin across his face and said, “You say the sweetest things, partner.”
Still, he was not sure if it was the act of hitting the man, or if it was knowing that Potter belonged to him and he was allowed to treat him whatever way he deemed fit that had sparked his attraction. Either way, he found himself in his room once it was over, his body pulsing with desire. He had pulled himself to completion at the image of Potter kneeling before him with a bloody lip.
The weeding man looked up at the noise and smiled. “Can I help you?” His voice was sweet, soft. It matched the smile he wore. The man looked a bit older than them, maybe in his late thirties. He was starting to go gray around his hairline, but it suited his face.
Potter was visibly shaking. The exaggerated motions pulled Draco from his thoughts. He watched Potter writhe against his binds and it was animalistic. Draco felt himself getting aroused by Potter’s strength and immediately felt disgusted with himself for not being able to control whatever it was that he felt for Potter.
taste like milk.” He fought the urge to drop at her feet and beg her to love him. He knew it wasn’t right, but he just couldn’t remember exactly why. That nagging sensation was the only thing that kept him from doing it.
They were still half undressed. Potter picked up Draco’s robes and without a word, dropped his trousers and slipped the robe on. All the while, Draco stared at the bulge in Potter’s pants until it disappeared under the robes. He found himself licking his lips at the thought of touching it again.
It seemed so right, that Harry couldn’t understand how he hadn’t put it all together already. Luna and Ginny, of course that made sense. He felt his heart swell with warmth at the thought, “Luna, I think that’s wonderful and you should tell her. I think she might feel the same way.”
Not anymore. Once, he had believed his family was honored by the Dark Lord’s presence. That they were chosen because they were powerful. Now, he realized the Dark Lord chose them because his father was a coward who would do anything the Dark Lord asked, even if it meant his wife’s death.
“He’s tried, countless times,” Lucius flicked his wrist in disinterest. “Rumors have been circulating for decades about him trying to make the magic work. So far, he has been unsuccessful.”
“I swear if everyone stopped kissing his arse for two minutes they’d see the bloke isn’t so special. So what, he killed you-know-who. That was five years ago and other people helped him. Not like he did it on his own.”
I looked directly at her for a moment. Her eyes were a striking green, not unlike my own. She stared back, unwavering. “Are you admitting to illegally obliviating someone to an auror?”
It was lunch before Harry knew it, and with the warm summer weather, many students were gathered in the courtyard. Ron and Hermione only managed to drag him outside after Harry was sure Draco wasn’t hiding somewhere in the Great Hall.
“Indeed. Quite lovely,” Draco agreed because it was easier than disagreeing and because Mr. Potter’s proximity to him was making him highly uncomfortable. Feelings were surfacing. Feeling which he had long since resigned to ignore. Feelings that would only cause him trouble. Feelings that would surely ruin whatever sanity he managed to obtain since the trials.
Malfoy’s eyes went wide. If his cheeks weren’t already red from the cold, they would have from blushing. After a beat, he scoffed and then he semi-shouted, “
George laughed at Malfoy’s joke and then seemed to realize he was laughing at Malfoy’s joke and stopped mid-laugh. “Oi, no fair. You’re being likable again. When did I start laughing at your jokes?” He shook his head in exasperation but there was a hint of a smile on his face.
“So confident, in fact, that you felt the need to point out my earlier response was not up to your conversational standards.” Draco paused in order to take in the mischievous smile on Mr. Potter’s face. Then after a pregnant silence, he finished his thought. “I do wish to please you in this manner, Mr. Potter; however, I have so little knowledge of what does the trick as you and I do not often have occasion to speak.”
“It wasn’t,” Draco snapped. “Remember Pansy also said it would be worse if you denied it or were blocked?”
“I must have been absent the day they explained that one,” Draco quipped back and laughed in spite of his best efforts to be annoyed with Potter for acting so casual after the bathroom incident.
Sleep settled in over me and I let it drag me away. I had the strangest dreams while I slept. Sleeping draught always did that which is why I rarely take them. Too much like the dreams I had when Voldemort was alive. Somehow even without the draught, I had those odd, fragmented dreams. These were all about this huge stone, oozing black sludge. There was a man hunched over in front of it sobbing, but I couldn’t reach him.
“I’m just saying that this place is full of some of histories most powerful and significant wizards. The location could be important somehow. Maybe the caretaker’s death was…collateral damage.”
That caught Harry off guard. What was he saying? He clenched his jaw and said the words that had been forming in his mind all week. “It’s now or never, Draco. It’s us, or it isn’t. Will you live with me or not?”
Harry tried to figure out how to say it without sounding insane. Did it sound insane? Would it ruin things if he said it? Was that something he wanted to risk? Did Draco even want to be in love? He’d said no commitment, right? Harry promised he could do that. But could he when he felt this way?
In those fantasies, Mr. Potter would sincerely apologize for his lack of response and credit this misstep to the misfortune of a man who travels often, therefore, losing often their correspondences. This would then be returned with Draco’s understanding and admittance that he simply thought there was an issue with the letters and in no way considered Mr. Potter the type of person to ignore an amiable invitation to someone’s home.
Malfoy eyed me carefully. There were tears in his eyes and sweat running down his temples. “I’ll cast to make sure the tea is safe,” he said.
“Then there was Luis something or other. He was also not my type.” Draco laughed, and Merlin, it was a good laugh.
Before he cold storm out, Draco heard the crack of a spell being cast and felt his body go ridged. He recognized the spells signature. It was an Imperious. His father’s command to sit poked and prodded at his resolve, worming its way into his head until he felt his knees buckle and his thighs hit the chair.
“You followed me?” I asked impressed. From what I remember, Malfoy was scared of these woods. Or he had been when we were in school.
Neville nodded. “She’s currently being cornered by Hermione. Apparently she wants all the teams in the league to sign some sportsman conduct agreement and thinks Gin is her ticket in. I’d save her before Hermione gets hexed.”
That did not just happen, Harry thought and he tried to shake the moment from his memory by actually shaking his head in disbelief. Rather a stupid idea, considering the amount of alcohol he had consumed. Now, on top of his nerves being a mess, he felt like he was going to barf.
Malfoy zipped up his trousers and pulled out his pocket square to dab away the sweat beading on his brow. “Don’t say anything. You’ll ruin it. Go do your insipid speech. Everyone is waiting on you, oh Saviour of the Universe.”
“We...uh...need...potion,” Potter managed to get out between ragged breaths. He leaned back on the metal counter, and fanned himself with the file. His cheeks flushed pink, making Draco’s heart skip a beat, though that could also be from the running.
Next to him, Malfoy fidgeted with his collar. His slender pale fingers slipping between his neck and the fabric of his robes. The skin of his throat was red, either from his constant fidgeting with the collar, or in reaction to the potion. Every time the line moved, Malfoy looked down at his feet and walked as if he were blindfolded and trying not to trip.
The beast had turned the ground to rot the last time I saw him. It looked like I could bring it back to life. Art least temporarily. I didn’t understand it, but I took another step and then another.
After a lot of contemplation, it seemed like a public spot would be best for this sort of conversation, so Harry asked Ginny to meet him in Hogsmead that morning about a half hour before they were all supposed to meet at The Three Broomsticks. They had spent a better part of the half hour catching up. Harry was desperately avoiding the topic, so they bought a few Butterbeers and walked lazily around Honeydukes before Harry gathered up the courage to tell Ginny.
Only if this were two years ago and Harry had been confronting Draco like this, he would have been challenging him to a duel, but now he was challenging him to something else entirely.
Possibly, it was the cold getting to him. Possibly, it was the adrenaline of the snowball fight. But also, possibly, it was the ethereal air that Malfoy gave off as he stood among the falling snowflakes and barren trees like the hero on a cover of some fantasy novel.
is here, so I expect they will want a ton of pictures. I know you hate it, but just think what it will mean to all the people who lost someone at the battle.”
Malfoy sucked in his bottom lip and sighed with what looked like great effort. “You were, but you were thinking about the Succubus, not about the small technical stuff. Subtlety isn't really your strong suit, is it?”
“Not quite. It is only impossible because no one has made it work, but then again, no wizard has been as powerful as the Dark Lord.”
Ron nodded, used the couch’s armrest to stand up, and wobbled into the crowd toward wherever the alcohol was stationed. From his perch on the couch, Harry had a view of the whole common room. Someone had taken to pushing all the furniture to the walls so there was a big empty space in the middle of the room for dancing. The ceiling had been bewitched to match the night sky, with occasional fireworks going off for New Year’s. Harry watched the bewitched sky for so long that he didn’t realize that someone had been sitting next to him until they coughed to get his attention.
Out in the courtyard, Harry scanned the crowd. Ron had been talking to him, but Harry couldn’t hear a word because his eyes spotted a streak of white-blonde hair across the courtyard. Draco was sitting with Pansy, lazily eating an apple—juice covering his lips. He wasn’t wearing his robes. They were in a careless pile next to him on the bench. His shirt was unbuttoned at the top, revealing a pale chest. His legs were crossed and Harry noted the flex of his thigh muscles.
Potter hummed under his breath and moved forward until their mouths were slightly touching—not kissing. Just lip touching lip. Draco held his breath. He felt the soft tickle of Potter’s chest hair on his chest. The boat swayed and they stumbled, but Potter righted himself by planting both hands on either side of the door.
There was no way to avoid being taken in by Draco’s appearance. No matter what he wore, he wore it with this easy confidence that radiated from him like a sunbeam. This outfit was no different. He wore a tailored gray suit the color of his eyes, with a white button up under his coat. He left the last few buttons undone, revealing the pale dip of his collar bone. His white-blonde hair was swept back, a few strands artfully falling around his face.
That’s when he felt it, her magic, falling over him like a silk sheet. It was silky, it was erotic, and he wanted to bathe in it forever. Her eyes fixed on him, and her smile softened into something devilishly sensual. The quirk of her red-lined lips made Harry stand at attention. He took a step forward, moving to her. There was a nagging voice at the back of his mind that told him this was bad, that he should probably cast a spell, stop her—but it felt so
“The music is lovely,” Mr. Potter affirmed but seemed to be saying something else. He seemed to ask Would you like to dance? in that subtle way that held no risk of rejection because it had not been a question so much as an invitation for Draco to assert that he would like to dance.
That I believed. Hermione got tunnel vision like me. When she was focused on a task, that was the only thing that existed. “Okay, so look presentable. I can manage that.”
Hermione shook her head, but she was smiling at her husband. “Madame Eloise Mintumble is buried here, you know?” She pointed to a gravestone a few feet away from where we stood. The stone read Lost in Time, Remembered with Love. “The witch who got stuck in the past. She is one of the main reasons time travel is restricted. One of the anomalies her time travel caused made the Tuesday after her return to her present last for two and a half full days.”
The rest of the day went off without a hitch. The crowd loved the memorial which ended up being a wall listing all the names of those who died and those who fought in the battle. There were etchings of wands around the edges that were charmed to move and casts spells from them. It was all very touching, at least, I knew it was supposed to be touching.
“I’ll say,” Pansy answered, clearly impressed by Potter. Draco felt an odd pang of jealousy even though he knew it was unfounded. Pansy didn’t date men, and even if she did, Potter wasn’t her type.
So, when an uninvited witch managed to make he way onto the Auror’s floor, Harry was shocked. Firstly, because his wards were perfect and secondly, it was Pansy Parkinson.
“Yeah, that’s…” Harry trailed off and turned to face Draco. There were tears in his eyes, his cheeks flushed pink. “Are you okay?”
“Got bored,” Draco said, scowling at Harry for shoving him, but it held none of the venom it once did. Now it was more like an inside joke for them. “Snuck out through the study’s Floo and then hoofed it from the Three Broomsticks.”
While Harry had been lost in his thoughts, Malfoy had inched closer so their lips were practically touching. The anticipation of it all was driving him mad. Being that close and not kissing Malfoy was proving to be more difficult than Harry anticipated. With that thought, his stomach flopped at the realization that if he just moved forward a little, he could taste Malfoy’s lips finally.
“Mmm,” Draco said into the kiss. He lowered his hands, sliding them beneath the waistline of Harry’s trousers and dug his nails lightly into his skin.
It was his first kiss. He didn’t know where to put his hands, so they were clenched at his sides. His nails digging into his palms. The pain was easy to ignore because Potter’s chest hammered against him. Draco wondered if Potter was nervous. His heart seemed to beat as fast as Draco’s and Draco
“Immensely,” Draco answered curtly. He forced a smile. Then, because it is polite to ask after people’s wellbeing, Draco added, “And how do you find the event, Ms. Granger? Is it to your liking?”
Draco lost himself in that thought and poured a glass of whiskey. The bottle whooped loudly and jolted him from his revere just in time to see that Potter was sauntering over to the table with the Girl Weasley at his side. She touched his arm lightly and tilted her head back, laughing at something he said. The whole scene made Draco feel like he was was drinking acid instead of whiskey. His stomach cursed him for even
Before Harry could make a decision, Malfoy’s lips were on his and Malfoy’s free hand had moved to cup his chin. A wave of pleasure surged through Harry’s body as Malfoy deepened the kiss.
Or was it something else all together? Something Harry had never vocalized, but still felt it in every fiber of his being.
? You’re going to jump over a fire? In that expensive suit? In those shoes?” Harry pointed down at the wing-tipped Oxfords Draco wore.
“You don’t really pay attention much, Harry.” She looked like it hurt her to say the words. “I don’t like to burden you. It was worse for you.”
At the very edge of the cemetery, Harry spotted an iron gate about six feet tall with ivy growing around the iron poles. There were hip-high bushes and a tree whose branches hung over into the cemetery. Underneath the shade of the tree, Harry spotted three dead birds just as Ned, the caretaker, had said.
Another quiet moment passed between them—Harry watching Draco watch him. Around them, the air felt thick and hot. He wanted to say something else, but Draco twitched and started to pull his hand away, so Harry scooped the snitch out of Draco’s palm and pocketed it.
When Harry thought about it, and he thought about it often, he wasn’t sure what compelled Draco to continue these meetings. Sure, they had a rivalry and once upon a time, it was a ‘horns locked in battle’ sort of rivalry. But now, it was less and more at the same time. Now it was more of bear cubs play fighting—testing their limits. Harry knew what he was getting out of these meetings. He just wasn’t sure what Draco was getting.
It was amazing to him that Malfoy could encapsulate so many different emotions in one look. It was a demure mixture of curiosity, caution, and contempt. Harry suspected that Malfoy was curious about the Invisibility Cloak, though he could hardly blame him. It was even a mystery to Harry, still. So many unanswered questions. But how Malfoy could look at him with contempt, as if Harry were the one forcing them to steal from Snape...well, Harry was sure he didn't know.
The sky, even lit as it was in starlight, felt endlessly dark. The expanse much like looking out at the ocean. It made Harry feel small, but Draco—he seemed to take up all the space in the night sky. Everywhere Harry looked he saw the flash of white-blonde hair and was instantly reminded of a hummingbird flitting around flowers in search of nectar. His speed had improved since their last time playing one another two years ago. For a moment, Harry felt stupid because clearly Draco had been practicing while Harry was as out of practice as they came.
“Want me to fuck you, Potter? Is that what you want?” Draco said in a low growl. His hands pulling slightly at Harry’s hair.
Pansy’s face went slack and then suddenly she was smirking and looking all-together too satisfied. It seemed Harry had stepped right into her trap. She even rubbed her hands together like a villain in the movies. At full volume, not a yell, but loud enough for the small crowd that gathered to hear, Pansy asked, “Are you fucking Ron’s brother? The dragon tamer?”
Dizzy from Portkey travel and the blasted potion coursing through his veins, Draco steadied himself on the brick wall of the alleyway where they landed. It was slick from the earlier rainstorm. They were a foot away from a dumpster that thankfully smelled like coffee grounds and not rotten fish.
That’s when he felt Draco’s hands; one barely touching his cheek, the other slipped around the back of his neck. Then their lips touched, soft at first and then Draco’s lips parted and Harry tasted him on his tongue.
She was stark naked, but she wasn’t beautiful any longer. The long raven hair was now a stringy white, and it hung around her face like vines. Her once perfect, supple skin was gray and wrinkled. It sagged off her bones. Her breasts hung like rotten fruit on a thin tree branch. But it was her eyes that were most unsettling. They were the putrid yellow of bile with no pupil. They seemed to glow in the darkness of the mausoleum. And they were trained on Harry.
not saying that to be an arse. It’s just the truth. You are always willing to suffer so others won’t. But an untested potion could fuck up your magic for the rest of your life if you aren’t careful.”
Draco brought his shaking hands up to Harry’s face, cupping his cheeks. He tilted his forehead to rest on Harry’s. He breathed unsteady breaths, and then kissed Harry softly on the lips. “I love you, too, you idiot.”
Harry was almost sure of it, but still...ever since they started whatever it was they started, he’d wondered if Draco was feeling the same way. And he decided now was the time to find out, finally.
After a moment's pause, Kharkov nodded toward a group of Beauxbaton girls who were all shouting out animals names to a rather large and boorish looking Durmstrang student, who was mimicking each one the girls called out. “It is good. They have fun. Blow off steam. It is good to be young when one is young.”
“I should have banned her from coming to the Quidditch team’s after-parties. That’s where she figured it all out. I denied it, though, but it was too late because she saw,” Harry mused, remembering the night last week when Ginny had shoved him, quite hard, from the main room of the party into the empty hallway and demanded to know why he hadn’t told her that he was in love.
“Agreed,” Potter said, giving Pansy his best hero-smile. “Malfoy and I were just about to send him word about our theory anyway, so that works out well. It looks like she’s using Ley Line magic.”
The man in front of the rock placed his palm on the smooth part of the stone and when it came away, there was a blood print with elongated fingers just like at the crime scene. The man’s hand shook and I watched it shift like the beasts face. It was a normal sized hand and then it was suddenly the beasts clawed, boney hand.
“Both.” I gritted my teeth. I desperately needed to change the subject, so I asked, “How long have you and Parkinson been together?”
She nodded. “I assume you both do, too. Halfway through the party, I noticed Ron very swiftly disappearing his champagne when no one was looking.”
Harry felt his stomach sink. Draco’s suddenly rejection of their ritual of empty challenges struck him like a stinging hex. Maybe Harry had imagined the bond he felt between them. Maybe he was a fool to think that they could ever be anything more than what they already were.
“Yeah,” I scoffed. “Thanks so much for the wake up call. I was nearly late and I had the pleasure of being greeted by Lamont and Reed.”
I hesitated a moment before lowering my hands. He released his grip. I felt drained from the effort it took to stop trying to attack. My voice came out weak and hoarse. “Ron?”
“Good match?” Draco asked scandalized, “That was a bloody great match. I’m completely spent. And I see you’ve been practicing that new grip I showed you last week?”
The grounds were empty. No mourners. Nothing. Not even a sign that aurors or Unspeakables had even been here. Not a footprint in the mud except for our own. The bloody handprint was gone from the gravestone. The only clue that anything happened here was the still upturned dirt in front of the grave. The hole wasn’t far down, maybe a foot. Whoever had been digging it must have been interrupted. The Unspeakables must have missed the hole when they were making sure this crime was swept under the rug with the rest of them. The bastards.
Without answering Granger, Draco staggered out of her cell and into the hall. After her door was firmly locked, he looked down at his knuckles. The blood was already drying—caking into the crevasses of his skin. He pulled out the handkerchief he always carried and began to scrub at the blood on his knuckles. He felt repulsed by his actions, but decided to use his misstep to get a reaction out of Potter.
Draco knelt down next to Potter and saw the wound on his head gushing blood. He touched his partner’s face, feeling a rush of lust hit him. Potter’s skin was warm under his fingers. He didn’t flinch away, but instead leaned into Draco’s touch. The potion hadn’t worked its way out of their systems yet, that was all.
Everyone laughed at this. Draco wondered at how easy it was for Potter to be out. Of course, it was headline news for months after the war, but Potter never seemed phased by it. Draco, on the other hand, well, his parents threatened death if Draco so much as looked at anyone before marriage. So he never really let himself consider romantic feelings until after the war, after his family disowned him for his
“Harry, you are a wonderful wizard,” Ginny said, dropping her hands and sighing deeply before continuing, “but you are also imperfect, and so is he. Don’t let your pride, or fear of judgement keep you from something you so clearly want.”
“Like I said, it isn’t always clear at first.” Greyjoy moved toward her fire and poured out the rest of the tea over it. Smoke billowed up from the fire as it went out. “Come back to the castle with me. We can discuss it more.”
Potter tried to place a hand on Draco’s shoulder, but Draco pulled away. “Because I just know,” he said, chanced a look at Potter and regretted it. Their eyes locked, the fiery green of Potter’s eyes scorched through the last of his resolve. “He wouldn’t.
“He’s vocal about Harry and the hearing. All he had to do was claim he didn’t want Harry knowing about a death linked to a odd magical occurrence becasue that could help him prove his theory.” When Hermione scrunched up her brow, Ron added. “Our trace spells wouldn’t work at the scene. Like not inaccurate or anything. Just nothing. None of us ever saw it react that way. Like there was too much magic to focus on.”
Running his tongue over his teeth, Draco tasted the morning on his breath more and more, and the taste of lavender, less and less. It was necessary for his composure. He needed to attempt to erase the terrible stain of his memories in some manner.
He found, more and more, that he wanted to see the way Draco moved. He wanted to watch Draco’s taut muscles relax into a motion, watch his wrists tighten into fingers gripped hard around the broom handle, watch his jaw clench right before he sped up into a trick. There was an intensity in all that Draco did—nothing without purpose, nothing without cause, and yet, nothing predictable. He was calculating and rash, somehow all at once.
“I’m not rash. Who’s rash? You’re rash,” Harry stood up fast, hugged Hermione and the made a mad dash for the door before Hermione could try to talk him out of it.
The air around them crackled with power, then it fizzled out. Potter scowled, so Draco put his hands up in defense. “All I’m saying is, pushing away every partner they assign you isn’t going to bring Thomas back.”
Draco laughed again, his warm, sweet breath ghosting over Harry’s lips. “You’re ridiculous, Potter.” He used his hand on Harry’s neck to bring them together again, their lips slotting together in a slow, passionate kiss.
After all, their conversation had gone well until Draco ejected himself unceremoniously. In fact, Draco had even let himself slip into the fantasy that he so often entertained himself with in front of the fire after dinner to quell the quiet evenings.
Draco misses his mother and finds himself in the garden the ghost of her memory lingers. As he sits there, mourning her loss—his father approaches ready to lecture him about his duties for the Dark Lord. One of which, is torturing Potter.
“When did you fall in love with him?” Ginny asked, her face was somber as she waited for a response.
“No, that’s not what I…of course,” Harry sat up so he could look Draco in the eyes, “That isn’t what I—what I mean is…I like this.”
Luna laughed, but it seemed forced, or at least like she clipped it off faster than she usually would. “Right, so,” she turned and waved to someone, a bloke who was at least an inch taller than Draco and averagely handsome, if one was into the whole rom-com love interest look. He had brown hair, and a soft smile that he turned on Luna when she waved him over. Once he reached her side, she continued, “This is Ryder. Ryder, this is Draco. He is very smart, clever, and obviously very well dressed.” Then as an afterthought, she nodded to Harry. “And you know, Harry, of course. If only by reputation.”
The party had moved inside since the rain hadn’t relented. I could hear it falling in sheets on the cottage roof.
Draco didn’t answer his father. Honestly, he had no words. Goyle, who was never one for witty conversations, had always been good to him. He felt a small bit of sympathy for his loss, though he didn’t dare voice it. Anything even remotely resembling disloyalty and Draco was sure he would be no better off. The fact that he was Lucius’s son would do nothing to dissuade the Dark Lord. In fact, he was sure his father would offer him up gladly if it further secured his own position. It seemed all that mattered to his father was the Dark Lord and his wishes.
Before Malfoy could finish what was shaping up to be another insult to Harry’s intelligence, Harry closed his eyes right, leaned forward, and kissed him.
“Didn’t anyone ever tell you it was impolite to talk about your friends like that, Ms. Granger?” Potter asked, winking at Granger. She blushed and rolled her eyes at him. Seemed to Draco that Potter had that effect on everyone. At least he wasn’t alone in that.
Pansy’s eyebrows shot up in apparent interest. “Hmm, that’s oddly clever of you to work out, Potter. Most wizards forget that Ley Lines are even there since there’s so much ambient magic about.”
His accusation shocked me. I almost said ‘yes, I do want to get fired because at least then I won’t have to pretend everything is okay’ but I managed to catch myself and said, “No.”
,” he shouted, following Harry’s lead. This time flames erupted from the tip of the wand, hitting the Succubus in the face. She howled in rage, leaning down closer to the man she sat astride. The flames got dangerously close to burning the man underneath her.
Neville blushed and shook his head. “Still a terrible flirt. I see nothing has changed since eighth year.”
George moved closer to us and placed a hand on Malfoy’s shoulder. “This ponce accidentally got a letter I was sending out to this bloke I’ve been pen pals with for a while now. We send letters and only sign them with our first names, right? And he sends me presents, but that’s not important. He’s a potions master named David from France. Well, the owls must have gotten mixed up because they sent a rather racy letter of mine to Malfoy here who replied back with a very serious rejection of my advances. In fact, he didn’t think the letter sufficed, so he stormed into my shop and quite animatedly told me where I could stick my letter.”
A scream. It was quiet at first. Easy to dismiss as something else, but then it grew louder and I scanned the party to see where it was coming from. A buzz of voices murmured once the scream stopped. Everyone looking panicked as they checked on other people at the party.
So he played at the tip—soft and slow, until Draco cursed and pulled Harry up into a fevered kiss that was more biting than it was kissing.
“Merlin, I thought Granger was kidding when she said you Muggle-raised sometimes forget to use magic since you grew up without it.”
“Sorry, yes, Father. I am,” Draco responded with his best smile. Though he had not heard what his father said, he was sure he could imagine it. The lectures he received lately always seemed to end on the same note:
“Erm, ‘Arry, as much as Malfoy gets on me nerves, yeh did snort at him,” Hagrid decided to add unhelpfully. He shrugged as he said it seeming to apologize for siding with Malfoy.
“Sure, you might, but I bet Harry is bored out his mind doing all the paperwork, eh?” Seamus asked, nudging Charlie who smirked.
Pansy only stared at Draco in shock. It was clear in her expression that she had not intended to upset him in such a way. Her normally composed face wore worry lines around the eyes and an expression of pity that Draco wished she would wipe from her face in the quickest fashion.
Ron looked at Hermione and then back to me. “You don’t have to take the potion, Harry. I know we all said it was the only way to trace the magic but maybe we are missing something?” His face was an amalgamation of fear and queasiness. It reminded me of the day in first or second year when he vomited up slugs becasue his curse backfired. He been aiming at Malfoy of all people. Now he stood next to Malfoy hoping his potions didn’t kill me. I guess ironies really are going around.
Robards raised his voice and added, “Do not engage without backup.” He paused and eyed Harry seriously. “Make sure you are properly armed and that you inform me before you head out to do any surveillance. We cannot let another person die on our watch. Understood?”
“Hmm,” Draco heard himself say. How interesting that Potter knew he was in the captains bathroom, but did he know that Draco had been in there with him before he took the pepper up potion?
Heart pounding, Harry averted his gaze. He needed a drink, right now, so he grabbed Charlie's hand and dragged him through the living room and into the kitchen where McGrady always stored the drinks.
Harry smiled and closed the distance between them. At first, he just pressed his lips against Draco’s, breathing him in and waiting for his heart to get itself under control. He slid his hand to rest on the back of Draco’s neck, then pushed harder into the kiss, and felt Draco push back, opening up to the kiss.
The Imperious was still holding him in the seat, but his father loosened the reigns on what he could say, so in spite of himself, Draco was curious. “The what?”
We sat in silence for a while. She watched me cautiously, eying the whiskey in my hand. I was getting bored, so I held it out to her and said, “Care for some whiskey?”
“Her almost victim.” Draco took the Lock Box out and extended his hand towards Robards. “We got her.”
Then, over by the opposite goal posts, Harry spotted the snitch. It floated mid-air and beckoned Harry to move—to catch it, but he hesitated, his eyes flitting over to Draco of their own accord. He eyed Draco, who was soaring high above the pitch looking in the opposite direction, and his stomach caved in on itself.
He didn’t know what to say, so he blurted out the first thing that came to mind. “Uh, well, at least I’m rich, right? She’ll like that bit.”
At first, Harry only felt the sensation of his lips touching something. Not exactly the magic he expected kissing in the snow would be. After all, his body was basically frozen after being in the snow for so long.
“I’d like to, yes.” Potter smiled. It was a soft, almost shy smile that Draco was not used to seeing his partner wear. “If we’re going to work together, don’t you think we should be honest with one another? Someone pretty clever told me that recently.”
“You and I could have been happy together, but you didn’t want that. You chose to be alone, and now I’m trying to move on and you have the nerve…”
That made the both of them laugh, and they headed to another table where there was still a bottle of whisky. It was half full. Draco snatched it up, took the cup out of Harry’s hand and placed it down on the table along with his own.
“You said if I got three in a row right you’d take off a piece of clothing. Time to pay up,” Harry demanded.
“Fuck,” Draco breathed out. His head felt light. He couldn't think, and his body flush against Potter's was doing nothing to help.
“No one will talk. You know that right?” Potter’s eyes shone even more when he spoke like this. Like they were reacting to the prideful tone in his voice. Growing in intensity. “We would all rather die than help you and
I looked at Sirius barking and smiled softly. He calmed down and sat at the front fo the portrait with his tongue hanging out of his mouth. “I—I was somewhere else.”
“That sounds like an amenable plan and I am sure I can handle a little spit,” Nikola answered quickly before Lucius could object, the smirk still present on his face. It felt like he knew the inconvenience he was causing, knew he was challenging the Dark Lord, and he didn’t care.
Malfoy asked, “Did you garden before you arrived?” He tilted his head to the side and looked like he was trying to remember something but couldn’t quite place whatever it was he had tried to remember.
“Without me following protocol, you’d be on probation faster than you can say ‘filing system.’ Try being a hero Auror then.”
Harry grabbed Draco’s hands again, interlocking their fingers. “Then say yes. I’m going crazy here. I’m all in. I told you I was all in a million times. I’m all in, Draco. I need this to happen.”
“Uh,” Harry said eloquently. “Yeah. Not ridiculous at all.” He was still trembling. That kiss had taken him off guard in all the best ways. The feeling of Draco’s lips, the taste of him sweet like a Honeydukes treat, had taken hold of Harry, and he wanted more. “Though, I think maybe we need to do it one more time to really be sure.”
I felt my pulse quicken at his insinuation. I was already more interested in this conversation than any of the conversations I’d had today. This back and forth with Malfoy had always set my nerves on edge. Fighting with him had been a decent substitute to almost dying at the hands of Voldemort. At least Malfoy didn’t pretend I was perfect, or ask me to be because it fit the fantasy of Harry Potter that he grew up with. Around him, I didn’t have to hide like I did with my friends. Irony of all ironies.
“Who knew a prat like you could be any fun at all?” George squeezed Malfoy’s shoulder and I felt my magic humming under my skin. It was agitated by their closeness.
The walk back to the dorms was uneventful, even without his invisibility cloak. No one passed him in the halls, not even a portrait gave him more than a passing glance. Clearly they were used to seeing him out of bed after hours. The novelty had probably worn off somewhere around fourth year.
The rain persisted and I had to cast a goggle charm over my glasses to keep them from fogging up. The humidity in the air rose as the rain pounded agasint the dirt.
He knew she was trying to work a spell, but he couldn’t figure out what kind. The deaths told him it had to do with Life and Death Magic, sacrifice most likely the reason for so many deaths all at once. But what could the Succubus want that it didn’t already have? What could drive something that only needed to kill once a year to survive to kill so many, so close together in desperation? And it was clear she was desperate, but why?
“But won’t it be awkward after, you know?” Draco asked. His cheeks were burning with the heat of embarrassment. He couldn’t believe he was having this conversation.
“Yes, of course. Come through at eleven. We will head to Hogsmeade by portkey from the Ministry around noon.”
“Then they’re fools. I’ve seen you work. You’re the most precise person in our class. It’s like you have magic fingers.” Ryder laughed, his voice talking on a huskier tone.
Draco, already feeling vulnerable, didn’t want to give Potter anymore reason to think him incapable, so he lied. “It felt the same as always, Potter. Maybe the potion is affecting you more.”
“Agreed.” Potter’s eyes lingered on Draco for a moment, then he turned on his heel and jogged towards the far end of the rows of mausoleums, ducking out of sight.
It started innocently enough. Potter asked to be his potions partner at the start of term. Draco said no. He planned to lay low until the end of the year and being Potter’s partner would not allow him to do that.Yet, Potter insisted he needed the help. He relentlessly bothered Draco until he agreed. After a few late night study sessions, Draco found himself
Neville nodded. “Well, do you think you’re ready to join us? Luna and I are going to announce who our best people are going to be, and you don’t want to miss it.” He winked at Harry playfully. It was honestly very cute that Neville didn’t know that Harry knew he was going to ask him to be his best man. He’d told Ron, for Merlin’s sake, and everyone knows Ron can’t keep gossip like that to himself. Harry had known for a week now that Neville planned to ask him since Harry played a part in getting him and Luna together eighth year.
The string quartet played a soft suite. The sound wafted through the air like a summer breeze blowing across the Thames. Quiet chatter filled the ballroom. A hum of activity. A bustle of noises. Feet shuffling on the dance floor. Laughs echoing over the music. Glasses clinking in cheer.
Greyjoy waved a hand arbitrarily. “Ah, not exactly. I have a ward up around my little fire. This forest isn’t exactly safe, you know? It warned me there were two people nearing and then I focused and cast a revelio and it told me who was there.”
Harry thought about it, about drowning out the odd feeling that was settling in around him and then thought about the hangover he would be sure to have in the morning. “Not right now, thanks.”
When they reached the Floos, Potter turned to face him. “There is one thing I wanted to talk about before we go back.”
Harry couldn’t stop himself from frowning. “He literally, no exaggeration, he literally organises his quills by size, smoothness of the flow on parchment, and type of feather, and if I ask to borrow one, he makes me sign it out and leave something as collateral.”
Outside in the garden I could see nearly every good friend I ever had standing in small clumps, drinking from champagne flutes and laughing or smiling. It took everything in me not to run the second I stepped out of the house, arm linked with Hermione. There was a layer of pleasantness blanketing the affair. That sort of afterglow feeling you get when you fall asleep outside in the summer and wake up with your eyes bleary and the sun warming your face. A soft comfort that threatened to dissipate the second you opened your eyes too wide.
“This is getting out of hand,” Ron added. “We shouldn’t be involving more people in this investigation. Harry should have just gotten the potion. It’s bad enough Skeeter is involved. Now Malfoy is here. If he gets hurt then…”
“Psh, I can admit it.” Everything around him blurred, until all he saw was her. He wanted to make her happy, so he continued, admitting something he had never voiced to another person, something he rarely even let himself think about. “It’s just, I don’t deserve to be loved—not until I make everything
Ron’s eyes widened with shock. “Oh, of course, that’s what George meant by ‘better leave the boys to it,’ after he walked away from you. I didn’t know what he meant then, but…oh Merlin, were you two going to do it at the party?”
“You are like spectre,” a voice came from behind Draco. The thick accent told him it was a someone from Durmstrang.
“Potter, this is—well, it’s not right, so if you would please remove yourself from the front of my robes,” Draco said, hoping his voice sounded as steady as he was trying to make it sound, but fearing he sounded more like a child making a request.
“It’s okay. I think about him sometimes, too. It comes out of nowhere. I’ll be making coffee in the kitchen and hear Ron slam a book shut and suddenly I’m thinking about the basement at Malfoy Manor.”
At a quidditch party, Harry tires to make Draco jealous by bringing Charlie, but things get a little complicated.
Draco was still smiling and the earnestness of it make Harry’s breath catch. Sitting there across from Draco, Harry allowed himself to think all of those thoughts he had been boxing away. The swarmed inside of him like a hornet’s nest knocked on it’s side—buzzing and racing around in search of some unseeable thing.
“Sure,” Neville said. He eyed me and there was still a hint of a blush in his cheeks, so I winked and he bit his bottom lip to keep from laughing.
Fuck, when I joined the aurors after school, I expected that I would get to do much of the same stuff I did while fighting Voldemort. Chasing bad guys, keeping people safe, making sure justice was served, dodging curses, surviving. It wasn’t like that though. It was like a walking nightmare. A nightmare filled with inter office memos and paperwork and red tape and stupid, antiquated laws that made no sense. Like leaving a child with his abusive parents because they are the Head of Improper Use of Magic Office and no one wants to deal with the fallout.
Fuck, Harry thought and then his face got hot and he couldn’t make himself turn to face Ron, who Harry was sure was just as embarrassed. A few responses flew thorough his mind, most of them just variants of ‘no’ and all of them useless because the damage was done and everyone would be talking about this soon enough.
She laughed. It was a beautiful sound, but beautiful in the way an abandoned ruin covered in overgrowth is beautiful. Her laugh hinted at darker things, untold power. “Let’s take this out of the rain. I want to taste all of you.”
Pulling Harry out of his thoughts, Ron’s voice was careful when he asked, “So, how did this happen?” And then he extended his arm out, waggling the empty glass in Harry’s face.
Harry waited a moment, then he said, “Everyone is a bit drunk, but you did have me hugging you in front of a lot of people. And I’m not straight.”
They were sitting on a bench in the faculty office waiting for Snape to return with McGonagall. Harry worried that this would finally wear McGonagall’s patience thin. Stealing from Snape wasn’t exactly a good reason to break to rules, not like all the times he broke them to keep Hogwarts safe.
Draco straightened up from checking his trainers and shrugged his shoulders. Licking his bottom lip, he responded casually, “Yeah. Thought you would like it since it’s muggle fashion.”
Draco was practically out of breath after jogging from the elevator. Potter had made a run for it as soon as the door opened and didn’t stop until he was skidding past the Potions lab door. Now, Potter was catching his breath as he waved his map at the Potions Master on duty, Pansy Parkinson, Draco’s dearest friend.
“Are you kidding me?” Potter laughed. It was one of those bitter, ‘I’m better than you and I know it’ laughs. The kind that held derision and contempt. “I was doing just fine before they saddled me with you.”
“All right, I am sorry, Hermione. You know how sensitive our Ron gets. Ginny already knew, so if I didn’t tell him next, he would have had a fit,” Harry joked right back.
I nodded, unable to form words for some reason. The darkness of the cloud persisted and then rain fell in hot, heavy sheets. I blinked and staggered backward into Malfoy who was still holding his champagne flute. His eyes were wide with fear.
Merlin, Harry thought, as he followed his partner through the Floo and back to the Ministry. His partner really was a pain in the arse. Dropping a bomb like that and then making an exit without waiting for a response. Ever the drama queen. He didn’t even give Harry a second to process what that meant, or to tell him that clearly the attraction Harry had been denying was for Malfoy, so that plus being around Malfoy made the potion extra strong.
When he opened them, Potter was standing in front of him looking Draco up and down. His face was unreadable. “You would have to wear the most formal looking dress robes in the world, wouldn't you?”
Potter seemed to consider his options and then his face set into a pout before he shifted and knelt in front of Draco. For whatever reason, it seemed Potter was going along with this little show of power. Again, Draco found himself worried that things would get out of hand, revealing his ridiculous attraction not only to Potter, but to a stranger who could use the information as leverage if he so pleased.
It was Hermione and she sounded chipper. I really hated people who could be chipper this early in the morning. “No, no. I was up,” I grumbled, blinking the sleep from my eyes. I’d had barely seven hours of sleep in the past forty-eight hours and I wanted to kill Hermione for sounding well rested. If I didn’t get some sleep soon, I might actually act on those impulses.
Harry nodded. “But I will pass my NEWT’s with flying colors and you will get to brag that you succeeded where Hermione failed. You tutored the Un-tutorable.”
Malfoy pointed to the dirt on his clothes and hands. “Just you’re a bit dirty and not the fun kind of dirty either. The dirt kind of dirty.” He ended with a wink and again, I felt my body react to him.
He was not an infant. He did not need to be reminded that being polite to Mr. Potter was in his best interest. It was not lost on him that having someone like Mr. Potter be amenable towards him would greatly help his cause, which was reason enough to smile and nod courteously. However, Draco still greatly felt the sting of rejection as if it were yesterday that he was waiting eagerly for Mr. Potter’s response to his letters.
The portkey was an old clock radio situated in the window of the night watches kiosk. The old man behind the window smiled at us and asked for identification.
“As you all may be aware, we have a problem in London. There have been a string of murders all perpetrated by one creature that, according to history, was once a witch who used Life and Death magic to prolong their life; a Succubus. We had hoped they were all extinct or apprehended, but it seems at least one remains active and has been busy.”
Harry conceited because he did sort of like that they had become friends, though he would be remiss if he ever admitted it to Hermione; she always has been a bit of a sore winner, “Merlin, you are terrible.”
“This is very typical of you, Harry Potter...” Draco’s eyes wandered down Harry’s body and then back up to his eyes. He sighed, and said, “I love you, too. Fuck me, but I do. I really fucking love you.”
It was his own fault that he was stuck in a corner of the Great Hall practically being held captive by Draco Malfoy. Over the last month, Harry had been begrudgingly accepting help in Potions from Malfoy. It was his only option, as he often reminded himself, if he hoped to pass with high enough marks to become an Auror. Now he was repaying his debt by helping Malfoy sneak into Snape’s stores for some ingredient to make a potion Malfoy wanted to practice brewing over Christmas break.
Mr. Potter then did something that Draco could never have anticipated. He winked. The man winked at Draco and then bit his lower lip, keeping his gaze fixed on Draco’s lips.
“Well, I think that is about all the revelry I can take.” Draco moved to leave, but Luna caught his arm and she pulled him in close and tight. It felt nice to be hugged, Draco thought. It had been so long since another person had touched him in a kind way. The last few months at Hogwarts had been a stream of hexes, slurred insults, and ass-kickings in empty bathrooms.
Ron couldn’t meet my eyes. “The law is the law, Harry. Yes, that particular situation was complicated and I will admit that sometimes people look the other way, but you acted outside of the law when you beat him. How is that any different?”
“And you’re worried it would ruin our friendship?” Harry prodded. He couldn’t stop his smile, or the way he’d unconsciously leant closer to Draco as he spoke.
“….so, that means you will likely be tasked with it. Draco are you listening to me?” His father’s voice cut through his thoughts. His face was set in a disappointed scowl—lips pursed, eyebrows furrowed, nose tilted to the sky as if there was a wretched stench about.
Some of the Aurors stood up, assuming the meeting was over, Harry among them, and as he stood, he saw something on the map that he would never have thought of if he hadn’t been complaining to Ron about Malfoy—the deaths all seemed to line up with a Ley Line leading into a nexus. He wasn’t sure why that was important, not yet, but they were definitely all Ley Lines.
“I didn’t ‘almost get killed.’ I got sucker-punched and she got away. And you cling to your precious protocol with such desperation you can’t see that it makes you a weaker Auror, unwilling to do the hard work when needed.”
From the crowd Harry heard a few people shout, “Oi, who won then,” and “I think Harry won.” But in all honesty, Harry didn’t care about the bet. He never cared about the bet. What he cared about was kissing Malfoy.
switched sides—losing his family in the process. Everyone was shocked when he did it and in the end, it helped them win the war. Though that didn’t seem to be enough for some people.
trying to sabotage you. Mother will be so pleased when I tell her I’m meant to be with Harry Potter and not some rich, demure witch from a foreign country.”
Malfoy looked at the tea in his hand. His eyes widened and I watched his normally schooled expression of indifference fade away and be replaced with fear. He looked up at Greyjoy. “Why are you gathering your own ingredients when Hogwarts has a store room?”
He shrugged. “It’s supposed to last over an hour. It could last that long or it could last ten minutes. You’re the first person to ingest it.”
“If that's all you want, yes, but I was thinking more along the lines of what you told me at St. Mungo's.”
,” Malfoy cursed under his breath when he accidentally brushed against the person ahead of them in line. He sighed and looked around at everything except Harry, which Harry found odd because ever since they were eleven, it was a guarantee that wherever Harry looked, his eyes would eventually find Malfoy’s looking back at him.
“One moment,” she said and whispered something into the kettle that was sitting near the fire. It was cast iron. She levitated it to hover over the fire. “Tea is on. Come, come.”
“Nice night isn’t it?” Charlie's voice came from behind Harry, but Harry didn’t turn around. He wasn’t ready to look Charlie in the face, yet.
He still had his wand out and ready. He pointed at me. “You said you wanted to find out what magic killed the caretaker, who by all accounts isn’t actually dead according to the Ministry and I definitely don’t remember any screams from the party. I decided to indulge you because you are stubborn and would have likely stolen the potion if I refused to help you, but now you’re telling me you’re having visions?”
“How is the magical traces potion coming?” I asked, abruptly changing the subject. I was getting good at that.
As Draco strolled leisurely through the gardens, taking in the beauty that had been his mother’s favorite hobby, he felt a pang of terror. His dream. It kept resurfacing at the most inconvenient of times. Most often, it would strike him like a dart from across the room whenever Voldemort spoke his name in that sickly sweet way he often saved for Draco, and only Draco.
He had no idea who it would be, but he stepped back to give them access when they arrived. Part of him was shocked when Potter stepped through. Another part of him felt happy, but he told that part of himself to shut up. Potter couldn’t be here for a good reason. In all of the time they were partners, Potter never once used the Floo to come see Draco.
Potter, still pinching his nose, laughed. “Fuck. Remind me to never underestimate Parkinson’s warnings again. I mean, she said it would make us touch-sensitive, but Merlin’s tits, even leaning on this wall feels overwhelming.”
“Read over the file,” Robards continued, ignoring the rising chatter about the very hot demon killer. “Find her.”
Ironically, I ended up in the dungeons. At least the setting matched how I felt. Gloomy. Dark. And a bit unpalatable for most civilized people.
“Don’t put words in my mouth, Malfoy,” Potter snapped. He was now in step with Draco, though he was taking two steps for one of Draco’s.
I couldn’t make myself say the words. My head was pounding and I felt my magic thrumming under my skin, itching to go somewhere. It felt erratic like it used to when I was still learning control. I tried to breathe through it.
They had fallen into an uncomfortable silence. Draco sipped at his champagne simply to occupy his mouth before he let another veiled insult slip from between his traitorous lips. Mr. Potter, Draco noticed, watched as Pansy guided Ms. Granger on the dance floor. He smiled as he did.
I blinked my eyes open again, slower this time. I still couldn’t see. I touched my face. No glasses. “Blind.” I said.
“Not this time,” Draco asserted to his reflection. He looked around the bathroom for something that might help. After all, this is the Headmaster’s private bathroom. Maybe there was a pepper up potion lying around.
Malfoy stood next to me with his hands over his head. He was taking in deep, long breaths. “Fucking bollocks.”
“Well, he was waiting for you to ask him out. He said you two had been flirting for months and that you even got sort of close to asking and then didn’t.”
The music drifted out of Pandemonium like a vibrating pulse. Harry could feel it in his bones. He stood tense, waiting for something to happen—and it was a matter of
Harry swallowed hard, trying to ignore the growing arousal in his pants, and peeked over the top of the bush in time to see a woman, tall with raven colored hair in a red dress that looked more like a teddy meant for the bedroom than something to wear in public, and a man hanging all over her. He seemed drunk, in both the literal sense and in the magical one.
Harry’s heart felt like it had begun beating at the speed of a hummingbird’s. He couldn’t quite control the smile that spread across his face. “Did you just tell me you loved me? Did Mr Keep it Casual just admit that he loved me? You love me, Malfoy. Oh Merlin, you love me.”
It had been a long time since Draco trusted someone—really trusted them, not just outwardly saying “I trust you” while inwardly keeping his options open. Ever since he was a kid, trust was a farce. Trust, as his father used to say, was for fools. A Malfoy can only ever trust themselves. And as much as Draco hated that he still heard his father’s voice in his head even today, it didn’t make it any less accurate. He couldn’t trust that Potter wouldn’t mess things up for him. In the five years since the war, Draco managed to garner a decent reputation for the Malfoy name between his charity work rebuilding the school, and his various donations. The icing on the cake: getting accepted into Auror training. Most people didn’t associate his name with his father’s wrongdoings anymore, but with him, with Draco. He was nearly there, and then a Potter-shaped problem plopped in his lap.
The man, still moaning under the Succubus, reached up for her breasts, but she slapped his hands out of the way and sat up straighter. She ceased her hip gyrations, and Harry felt her push her magic at them again. And again, the potion rippled along his skin, flooding him with Malfoy’s scent and the contented hum he made every time he sipped his tea, keeping her out of his mind. He was going to buy Parkinson a drink after this. Maybe two.
His hand hung between us. His long pale fingers outstretched toward me. His hand trembled a bit as he waited for me to take it. “You had no problem touching me the other day, in fact you insisted on it.” Malfoy’s voice lowered to a whisper and if I wasn’t mistaken, he sounded hurt. He was the one that stood me up last night. He had no right sounding hurt.
A small smile spread across his face. “Thanks, Harry.” He took one more look at the crowd and then looked down at his clothes and sighed. “I’m going in to clean up a bit. I’ll see you in a bit.”
“What’s your favorite potion to brew, Draco? I’m partial to anything with Valerian root in it myself.” Ryder said. He seemed genuinely interested in Draco’s response, leaning forward to better hear Draco’s answer. That’s when it dawned on Harry that Luna was trying to set Draco up.
that he would hurt either Granger or Potter and the red-haired monstrosity would all but cave. In fact, Draco wasn’t sure which person the Weasel cared about more. He would have figured it would be the muggle since they were dating, but he begged with equal patheticness for Potter to be left alone.
He hugged his coat in tighter and pulled his shoulders up to his ears effectively reminding Harry of a turtle when his scarf covered his pointy chin. Though a sort of oddly attractive turtle, Harry admitted, at least when his pale cheeks were wind blown and there were flakes of snow in his eyelashes.
“Is it working?” Malfoy asked all the awkwardness from our conversation was gone and replaced by academic intrigue. I couldn’t even tell he had been annoyed a few minutes ago as we walked here.
I was wearing my cleanest pair of jeans with a gray t-shirt that had three buttons at the collar. I left them undone, glad that I decided on the cotton shirt instead of the button up. The heat was unbearable today. An unusually hot May day according to the papers. The papers also boasted that there hadn’t been any magical surges in over a week, so maybe Harry Potter was buckling under the pressure of being everyone's Golden Boy. There are reasons why I don’t like the papers and that's one of them.
“I’m in need of one particular potion and it has nothing to do with the bedroom, sorry to disappoint.” I ignored the impulse building in me to ask him why he stood me up yesterday at the party. That was a problem for another day. What I needed was the potion, not another distraction.
This last line of thinking persuaded Draco to write another letter, outlining the same sentiments as he previously wrote. He expressly begged Mr. Potter’s pardon for not receiving his first letter of thanks sooner and explained that it must be lost somewhere.
“Actually, things do need to be submitted to Robards,” Draco snapped. His frustration bubbling up his throat. Potter didn’t have to be careful the way Draco did, not when he was the wizarding world’s savior. “Are you saying I should be more like you, then? An Auror who doesn’t know the difference between an M-123 form and an M-342? An Auror who ignores protocol and goes out without his partner to face a dangerous criminal and almost gets himself killed?”
We all stared at each other and laughed. It wasn’t that the situation was funny. It wasn’t that we were suddenly insane. It wasn’t even that it was late and we were tired. It was the absolute hilarious conclusion that we all seemed to come to at the same time: one of us would need to ask Malfoy for his potion, even though it hadn’t been tested on humans yet, and one of us would have to ingest it to see if we could follow the magical trail at the crime scene.
They sat there for a while in silence, looking at the moon. Charlie's body was squished against his in attempt to stay warm. The night was becoming unforgivably cold, but Harry couldn't make himself move, yet.
I took in a shakey breath, but felt a bit better when Ron placed a hand on my back and started to rub back and forth. I cleared my throat and looked around the station. No one seemed to be looking at me which was a small kind of victory. The last thing I needed was an article in the paper about how I had a breakdown in the Ministry.
“Probably,” Harry answered. His breath caught in his chest. There was something so suggestive about everything Draco was doing. The tight clothes. The winking. The innuendo.
It’s New Year’s and Harry is feeling the pressure of the future like a crushing weight. At the New Year’s Eve party, he ends up pretending to be Draco’s date and then things heat up between them.
After side-stepping through the crowd, Harry found himself at one of the drinks tables and grabbed for the firewhisky, only to have another person’s hand snatch the bottle away before he could wrap his fingers around the neck of the bottle. Harry looked up to see Draco Malfoy smirking and pouring himself the last bit of whisky.
But Harry was still afraid of the reactions he would receive upon sharing the news, so he decided that telling everyone would have to be a one-on-one thing, for his sanity. Most of his friends, well, three of them; Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, already knew he fancied both men and women, so at least that part wouldn’t shock them. However, the person with whom he fell in love, that part could be tricky.
But I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the professor. She was small, short and wafer-thin. Her hair was graying and it was loose around her face. Some strands were knotted together in braids and adorned with silver trinkets. She gave Trelawney a run for her money with her thick purple-rimmed glasses and the flowing dress that made her look like an amorphous blob. When I didn’t turn away, she winked at me and then returned to her tea.
In the corners of the room were large marble sculptures of nude men and women which had been moved from their normal places in the library. An obvious show of power for the Dark Lord’s guest. The Malfoy’s, after all, were the wealthiest of the Dark Lord’s followers, so they must dine like Greek gods in order to showcase this wealth otherwise what good was it all?
bows. That paired with their outfits should have told me just what kind of party I was heading to, but I couldn’t focus on much of anything except how I could slip away unnoticed to go and speak with the caretaker.
The mechanisms sprang into action, the metal box unfolding like a flower in bloom. The sounds of gears turning and metal scraping was like music to Harry’s ears. They had her. It was over. They’d done it.
“So what?” Draco scoffed, working to hide his own smile which threatened to take over. “I’m attracted to you or whatever, and I want to kiss you, but that doesn’t mean I
I stared him down. “Then who is it on, Ron? That man is dead. I could have helped him, but he was killed, most likely by whatever that beast is from my visions.” I was beginning to sweat, so I fanned my face but that didn’t help. Summer was coming early this year. The heat was humid and thick. It was the kind of heat that felt like it rested on your skin like another layer of clothes.
Almost as if on cue, a group of fifth years walked past and Harry caught three of them dragging their gazes lazily up and down Malfoy’s lean frame.
“Yes,” Potter said firmly. He crossed the room to stand in front of Draco and smiled. “I am very sure.”
a short sleeved cotton shirt. It was pale blue and made his platinum blonde hair stand out even more than usual. Beside him was a tiny owl who looked impatiently at Malfoy as if waiting for the response was taking too long.
“Pans, we can sign waiver M-78, relieving you of all liability if the potion has unexpected effects. Not that there will be any. We all know your potion brewing is second to none. It will be fine. We need to stop this thing soon, before more people get hurt.”
It felt like everything he expected and nothing he could have imagined at the same time. Potter’s lips were soft and unmoving, but there was a roughness around his mouth where Potter shaved. He tasted sweet like a honeysuckle in summer. He smelled like whiskey. His lips parted and Draco mirrored him—unsure.
I stared at her, and for the first time in a long time, I let myself cry and be held by someone. I felt everything I’d been pushing away rush though me like a flood. It felt terrible, but there was a moment of clarity. No more oblivion. Not if I was going to stop the corruption. I couldn’t muddle my way though this one half-drunk and throwing punches. I needed a clear head for this case.
The door swung open and Hermione came in. Her hair was pulled back into a low bun and she wore a formal set of robes, giving me horrible flashbacks to Yule ball and that ridiculous frilly thing Ron wore. She looked a right shot better in it than Ron had looked in his.
Draco let out a small squeak at the thought of Potter walking around naked after showering and then masked it by coughing so ridiculously loud that a few partygoers near them looked over. In fact, he was so caught up in the moment that he barely felt the glass slip from his fingers. It shattered at his feet.
And what had once been an even match in flying was starting to become balanced in Draco’s favor. He flew with such abandon and with such fluidity. It was that night, among the snow fall and the quiet winter air that Harry realized he was in love. He had almost gotten up the courage to ask Draco out, but in the end, he chickened out, assuming that Draco would never reciprocate his feelings.
“I wasn’t thinking,” Harry lied. Usually he would have said something defensive, hurled an insult Malfoy’s way, but the potion and the Succubus’ words had him off kilter. That, and Malfoy’s annoyingly rosy cheeks.
“I’m sure he will be flattered that you’re interested, but he just started dating Draco,” Neville said. He shrugged apologetically and then placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder.
We moved in silence after that and reached the break in the trees just as the magical trace faded completely. I looked around and saw all the other magical traces fading, too. The potion had run its course.
“I expect you won’t,” Hermione said and then walked over to her pristine desk and lifted herself up to sit on the desktop. She crossed her legs and smiled triumphantly.
“Yes, darling,” Ron answered and then put his arm around her shoulder and kissed her forehead. She smiled up at him and wrapped her hands around his middle.
Through the fireplace, I heard Hermione shouting at Ron to hurry up and Ron shouting back that he would except he couldn’t find his tie. I stared at his tie on the couch and smirked. Even the effort to half smile made my head feel like it was stuffed with cotton balls, so I dropped the smile and grabbed the tie, heading to their bedroom.
The cold was making it hard to feel anything, let alone a kiss, so Harry grabbed the front of Malfoy’s coat and pulled him into an embrace figuring body heat would help. Malfoy made a small stuttering noise as their bodies crashed into each other. Neither of them pulled their lips apart, however.
“Don't need to hear about your sex life right now, Ron,” Harry quipped and shoved an elbow into Ron’s side playfully, “I’m in crisis over here.”
Harry shook off the image of his lips on Malfoy’s with greater effort than he would ever admit to anyone. “Right, let’s go.”
Harry chanced a look at his partner and found Malfoy searching the map behind Robards rather than scowling in Harry’s direction, which was what he’d half been expecting considering their past and the fact that Malfoy was clearly mad at him. He hadn’t even bothered with good morning pleasantries when they’d arrived for work. He had just sat at his desk and ignored Harry until the memo for this meeting dropped on both their desks that afternoon calling for an evening briefing before everyone headed out. Then he’d told Harry he would see him in there and stalked off.
The line in the portkey station was long. It seemed a lot of people were heading out of the city today. We were tucked in line between some family whose kids wouldn't stop staring and pointing at us and an elderly couple who didn’t seem to care who we were. The ropes separating the lines were purple velvet wit gold accents. The sign over the line we were in flashed Hogsmeade Station in bright gold letters.
I didn’t want to talk to him. Not now. Not after I’d let my lust, or whatever it was, distract me. A man was dead because I’d been thinking about him. “I’m
Draco, on the other hand, had not stopped flying since taking off. He circled the pitch, his head held high, his eyes narrowed. Harry was reminded of a bird of prey. The only issue—was the snitch the prey, or was Harry?
“There’s nothing here.” I stood upright and looked around the stream. The forest was quiet. There was a tinge of evil to the silence in the forest, menacing even, but under that there was something serene. That was magic. That was all of magic as far as I’d seen. The capability for both good and evil, light and dark. It felt fitting that ambient magic was gray since magic wasn’t one thing or the other, it was all in how we used it.
“You really want to do this here?” Draco asked, standing up abruptly, his chest heaving. Draco’s height made it so Harry had to tilt his head slightly to keep their eyes locked.
“For what? If it’s so important, tell me.” His voice was cool and detached now. I hated how sad it made him sound. I hated that somehow I was responsible for that.
Harry swallowed hard, looked around and caught Hermione and Ron’s attention—both of whom looked down to see Harry and Draco holding hands. When their eyes snapped back up, Hermione gave him a soft smile of understanding, but Ron looked smug and mouthed, “Told you so.”
So school is starting up and I am going to do my darndest to keep up one chapter per week, but I am human and life is busy, so I might have to dial it back to one every two weeks. Who knows? Either way, I will keep you all up to date.
The ship had a strange, skeletal look to it, Draco noted as he made his way around the main deck where the party raged on. No doubt there were as many ghosts roaming the decks of this ship as there were in the castle, though Draco had not run into one yet and he was almost disappointed.
The only sign that she had been drowned was the small trickle of water dripping from the corners of her mouth. Otherwise, she looked composed. More composed than the Bloody Baron or Nearly Headless Nick, anyway.
There was a pop in the air like static and Harry felt magic fill the room. It threatened to drown him. He felt Malfoy solid behind him. And then the flare of the potion shielding him. Flashes of Malfoy’s face rushed though his mind, warming him to the core. The potion worked, it blocked her magic from consuming him again. He let out a relieved breath. Parkinson had done it.
Draco looked away from Potter, though it took great effort. He could still see Potter out of the corner of his eye, and even though they were a foot apart, Draco practically felt the heat of Potter’s body on him.
“Is he? Hadn’t noticed.” Draco waved off the idea with a flick of his wrist much like his father whenever he was done with a conversation. This was not the topic Draco was prepared to cover. He expected to be questioned on how long it took to get information from Potter, or what methods of torture were being used. These were things he had answered on countless occasions. No one ever inquired after Potter’s looks.
I searched the party and spotted Neville with George in a corner. They were leaning in close, whispering to one another. Neville’s clothes were still covered in dirt. I guess he never got around to cleaning himself up with the scream and panic afterward. With the obliviate, I doubt he even remembered why his clothes were dirty.
Harry shrugged and then leaned back against the wall, so he could attempt looking casual as he scanned the room for Draco, who was now no where to be seen. This made Harry more uncomfortable than he cared to admit. For one thing, what was Draco doing? And how could Harry make him jealous if he wasn’t here to watch?
Midnight had been his bright idea. He spoke the words before he even considered that meant they would have to find a snitch, which was already difficult to catch, in the dark. Harry blamed his ego. He never could avoid a challenge, especially against Draco. Any logic he had, went up in a puff of smoke whenever Draco sauntered over to him ready to trade insults.
He was embarrassed by his own unashamedly childish hopes that his feelings might, even in some small way, be reciprocated by Mr. Potter though his earlier rejections of Draco’s letters still hung in the air like so many unpleasant scents.
Before Malfoy could respond, the door burst open and Harry braced himself for the pursed lips and devastating look of disappointment in McGonagall's’ eyes, but instead found himself looking at Hagrid wearing a Santa cap.
Even though it was getting incrementally warmer out, both of them had kept to wearing their quidditch kits. The jersey’s were long sleeved and the pants had necessary padding in them. And now, here was Draco wearing those bloody shorts.
“You—you’re so beautiful,” Harry whispered. It wasn’t what he had meant to say—he had meant to ask Draco why all of a sudden he refused a rematch.
Draco’s eyes were still on him. Harry could feel them roaming his face in search of something, but Harry kept his eyes on the night sky. Under the scrutiny of his gaze, Harry considered saying never mind and calling it a night, but this feeling—this heaviness in his stomach—it was too much to ignore anymore. He was carrying it around with him constantly.
“So, then what happened? Why didn’t you seem as affected? Every time I touched something, my whole body felt it. It was even more intense when we touched, and I sort of remember Parkinson saying that if you were around someone you found attractive that it would be worse, so I guess what I’m getting at is...”
Faintly, Harry heard a sound and turned to find Hagrid, who he assumed was the source of the noise, only to see Hagrid was leaning against a tree practically sleeping with his eyes open. If Hagrid was sleeping, then that meant Malfoy was humming and nothing seemed more unlikely to Harry.
He was right and I hated him for it in that moment. “You know this time of the year makes it worse for me. Plus, I hate speaking and I am dreading the photos and headlines. It’s just the stress of all that and the stuff with the hearing and desk duty. I’m going a bit stir crazy.” Ron smiled at me sheepishly, wordlessly accepting my apology, and I smiled back. “Let’s go before Hermione thinks up a spell to flay us while also lecturing us on punctuality.”
Someone in the crowd whistled. Other’s were ooo-ing. But Harry focused on Draco and how his body started to melt into his. Their torsos meeting. Their thighs flush against one another. Touching Draco held all the same weight as it did when they were on the pitch. There was still the hum of electricity between them like a live wire.
“Harry, this is the same thing I was talking about in school. You think that you have to suffer so everyone else can be happy and then you get mad that you’re suffering and everyone else is happy. How does that make any kind of sense?”
Draco stood up next to him. “You’re an idiot, Potter. Why didn’t you tell me you couldn’t cast? That the Succubus got a bite out of you last night, didn’t she? That was utterly foolish, and not to mention, it could have gotten you killed.”
“Come on, that settles it.” Draco leapt up from the bench, extended a hand to Harry, and said, “Get your arse up, Potter, we’re
“Yes, is that insane?” Harry asked. Part of him wanted to know how Luna had figured out who he loved, but decided that the answer would only solidify the fact that he was completely and utterly obvious about his feelings, even though he fancied himself subtle.
Before Potter could respond, Pansy was back in the room. She flicked her wrist and sent the paperwork off to Robards. “While we wait for his signature, let’s talk about how the potion works.”
“Please, just leave her alone,” Potter begged. And he managed to look Draco in the eye as he did it. If Draco had been anyone else, maybe this heartwarming display of camaraderie would have some affect on him. But all it did was make Draco’s insides flood with satisfaction at knowing he was winning—that there was still something he could do right. He was the one that Potter answered to—the one who had the power.
The call went dead and the fireplace went back to being a fireplace. I turned and debated going upstairs to my bed to sleep, but eventually I settled on the couch under Sirius’ portrait. I curled up and placed my half drank mug of coffee on the floor near the couch. Dean and Seamus’s wedding had been fun, that boded well for the garden party. Though I’d drank at the wedding, so maybe that had something to do with it. That thought was frightening. Maybe I did drink too often.
I nodded and he cast a spell I'd never heard of that was probably some potions master spell and seemed satisfied with the results. He stared down at the drink for a moment. “I don’t like thinking about him.” He sounded smaller, less Malfoy-like and it made me uncomfortable.
Harry tugged his coat tighter around his torso. “Just needed a minute. Had a hard day at work. Didn’t want to carry it in with me.” He shrugged for good measure. If he was honest, everyday as an Auror was a hard day, but Neville didn’t need to know that.
“Merlin, I don’t know whether to be impressed or concerned,” a drawling voice came from behind Harry. He turned to see Draco Malfoy wearing a formal-looking royal blue suit, tailored to perfection, with the top-most buttons of his pale blue dress shirt undone. His robes were draped carefully over one arm. “Did you just finish off your whole cup in one sip?”
All of those observations felt like they took hours, but only a moment had passed because when Harry snapped out of it, Malfoy’s eyebrows were still raised in question. He nodded and they proceeded to sneak into Snape's private store closet. Once inside, Harry desperately wanted to be free of the cloak and tugged at it. Malfoy must have been caught off guard because he tugged back trying to cover the part of him exposed by Harry. Then in an instant, Harry saw Malfoy lose his balance and sway backward into the shelf.
Harry, rash as always, had enough of this dance they were doing and shouted, “I tell you that you’re beautiful and all you can say to me is that I’m ridiculous?”
“Shut it,” I told my reflection and rubbed the rest of the grogginess from my eyes and headed back to the task of seeing who in the fuck could need to speak to me so badly that they came through at four in the morning.
“I don’t do tradition well.” Potter’s hand fell and he stepped back a little, giving Draco space to breathe. Well, space is a bit generous as the bathroom was the size of a broom cupboard. Potter simply stepped back enough that they would not bump elbows as they undressed.
,” Draco drawled. He crossed the room and positioned himself in front of the desk, but decided to remain standing for as long as his father would let him. It felt more like equals meeting in a battlefield like this and less like he was a beaten down mutt waiting for his treats.
A hand shot up in the back. Harry could see out of his periphery that it was Auror Read, a mousy man that reminded Harry of Pettigrew. Harry had gone through training with him, and he was almost as annoying as Malfoy. “But sir, a Succubus will rarely kill so close together. They feed on Life Energy, and according to
“Yes,” Ron answered. He looked at me and I could see his concern for Hermione. It couldn’t be helped. She had been obliviated with the rest of the party. She didn’t remember the scream or that we’d run off to investigate it. No one did.
The room he kept Potter in was small, windowless, and poorly lit. He suspected it must remind Potter of being kept under the stairs by his relatives—a nice piece of intel he gathered from the Weasel, who was the easiest to get information from. All Draco had to do was merely
In answer, Potter shrugged. Then he did something odd. He turned to face Draco and reached a hand up to stroke his face. Potter’s fingers were shaky as they trailed down from his cheek to his jaw. “She was right, you know? You are silver-tongued, charming, and beautiful.”
“Harry, Hermione, get over here,” an excited voice came from the small group near the food table. It was Seamus who looked almost as happy as Dean had when he answered the door. Martial bliss, I guess.
He looked at me. His eyes bloodshot. He pulled away from my touch, then he took a sip of the tea and some color returned to his face. “I didn’t know you had visions back then.”
“No, thanks,” I added. “If I drink anymore tea I’ll likely have to run out in the middle of my speech to use the loo.”
“Hmm,” Hagrid said, scratching at his beard with his free hand. He looked back and forth between Harry and Malfoy. “Fin’, don’ tell me. The look on Snape’s face, though, that was a sigh’. Glad I didn' miss it, I am.”
“I’ll alert the prophet,” Draco deadpanned in response. “Draco Malfoy, occasionally funny. It will merit a full page article.” He smiled half-heartedly and took another sip of his drink. It was vile, but he gave him something to focus on other than Potter’s hand. The longer Potter stood there with his hand on Draco’s back, the more Draco worried someone might see. Someone might see and...and then what?
Malfoy blushed. His face a soft pink. “Well, turns out George found my little speech hilarious and won’t let me live it down.”
And like those words were law, Harry felt his orgasm burning through him like a super nova bursting. Bright, hot, and explosive.
While I was bent down behind my desk, I overheard two aurors as they came into the bullpen, Luke Lamont and Angie Reed. They clearly thought they were alone.
For a moment, nothing happened and Harry regretted his boldness. Embarrassed, he started to loosen his grip around Draco, but then he felt the soft brush of lips on his.
“Good match,” he called to Draco and he meant it. Draco had been in rare form that night. He flew with great control and speed. Harry suspected that Draco was practicing flying during the day sometime so he could beat Harry finally after a two weeks long losing streak.
“Not alone,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “You could have told me. We could have planned something...”
The garden was in full bloom. Fragrent flowers mingled with the smell of the food. Laughter flooded my senses. “You ready to get your mingle on?” Hermione asked with a soft chuckle.
The man turned toward Harry and then took his advice. He didn’t even bother to grab his clothes before running out of the mausoleum.
Just then, as if he wished it into existence, a girl nearby screamed and threw her drink as a ghost wearing full pirate garb floated through her on his way to walk the plank. Unlike the Hogwarts ghosts, or even the ones in the Manor, this one seemed trapped in a loop. He did not even acknowledge the students as he flung himself into the Black Lake.
Pansy tilted her head to the side and gave him a look that screamed ‘seriously,’ but professional as always, she answered, “I assure you, everyone has at least one attraction somewhere in their subconscious. Even if you’re unaware of it, the potion will latch onto the attraction and bring it to the forefront.”
Up until now, Harry had not looked into Malfoy’s eyes. It was easier if he didn’t because Malfoy did have a very intense stare and Harry was sure the prat would use it to his advantage. So, in an effort to avoid eye contact further, Harry leaned his head in to whisper something into Malfoy’s right ear.
“I said, I’ve seen you in my own visions. I had hoped to talk to you about them at the memorial, but you were hardly alone that day and I didn’t wish to speak with you in front of Mrs. Granger-Weasley since her disdain for divination is very clear.”
“Let’s go,” Ron said and headed off to the back of the yard. I took one more look at Malfoy and Hermione and as they entered the house, she began casting some protection spells. Malfoy seemed to wake up at that and began helping her.
That seemed to make Sir Hilliard happy. He straightened his armor and nodded at Harry. “Good to hear, Mr Potter. Rest easy.” With that, the portrait swung in on itself, giving Harry access to the eighth year common room.
Laughing loudly enough to wake the entirely of Grimmauld Place, Ron leaned forward and rested his elbows on his knees and then said, “I can see that. But what I don't get is why you are acting as if your world has ended, mate.”
Draco took up the quill after Potter placed it down next to the form. A huge part of him was screaming ‘don’t do this, he will figure out your secret.’ If he thought being Potter’s partner was difficult now, he couldn’t imagine what it would be like working with him if Potter found out how Draco felt about him. It was almost enough to make him back down.
“Oh. Yes, I like you as my tutor so much better,” Harry said, dragging Draco forward into a lazy, slow kiss. The taste of mint on his lips drove Harry wild, and he had no idea why other than the fact that it was Draco. It tasted like
Fondly, he remembered his last encounter with Potter. It began with Potter spitting in his face, but ended with Draco back handing Potter so hard that his head flew back and hit the wall behind him, knocking him unconscious. The high Draco felt at knowing he was finally the one in control was more addictive than the Dreamless Sleep he devoured each night to rid himself of his incessant memories.
I walked closer to the man and saw his body shaking from crying. There was no sound, not even the sound of the earth beneath my feet as I stepped on twigs in the grass.
Before he could get out the rest of what he intended to say—all the reasons this was madness, all the reasons it shouldn’t happen—Potter pulled him into a kiss that was so hungry, so desperate, that Draco lost his breath.
His mother only smiled at him and then took her seat again. Unfortunately, his mother had not had enough time to teach her portrait much. It had only been a few months ago that his father decided to commission portraits for the family. Mother had found it silly to have them so soon, but Lucius insisted like somehow he knew she would die. She was a strong witch whose magic was infused with the painting, so it moved like her, talked like her,
Mad at himself and mad at this situation, Harry could feel tears welling up in his eyes and thanks to the harsh January air, they felt frozen almost the instant they fell down his wind-burned cheeks, “No, but why would he?”
as well. Then Harry heard the crunch of his footsteps moving in the opposite direction. Harry turned his head slightly to watch Malfoy from his periphery. He knelt down and examined a small white-petaled flower at the base of the tree. It seemed to grow out from a knot in the tree’s roots. Malfoy’s tongue flicked out in concentration and then his eyes set in a determined way before he removed one of his gloves to stroke the petal, making sure it was soft enough to be collected. His long index finger stroked the petal from stamen to the outer edge. Then he repeated the motion on the other petals. Seemingly satisfied, Malfoy plucked the first petal he stroked and placed it in one of the jars.
“Yes, yes. All right, you are forgiven,” Hermione sighed heavily and let out a harsh laugh. She looked at him and raised her eyebrows in that way she always did when she was lecturing him on deadlines and how he was an adult now and had to start planning better, “Of all people, Harry.”
. Robards coughed to quiet them. “It’s all hands on deck now. We need to track this thing down. If we can find it, catch it unawares, then we stand a chance at apprehending it. Use your Lock Box to trap it until it can be dealt with by the Unspeakables. I know it’s a relatively new charm box, but it’s been tested in the field and the extension charm inside the box is about the size of a cell.” Robards kept talking while a few of the Aurors in the room skimmed the file, Ron among them. “That being said, Ada Holcomb, the woman who died last night, her death is on us. All of them are, really, so let’s make sure no one else dies. Don’t try to be a hero. Call for backup.”
Harry rolled his eyes at Ron. “Not this again. I solve cases. I get the bad guy in the end, isn’t that what matters most?”
I put a hand down on the upturned earth. I can’t say what motivated me to do it, but when I did—I felt a searing pain like a white hot poker to my gut. It took everything in me not to scream.
Harry shifted his broom from one hand to the other. The familiar feel of the wood against his calloused palms made him miss the rush of quidditch. He hadn’t played in two years thanks to the war and McGonagall deciding that eighth years weren’t allowed on house teams, so when he was faced with an opportunity to best Draco in a seeker's game, he made sure to take it.
“You won’t.” And Harry was more sure about this, than he had been about many things. Draco was just being cautious like Hermione had predicted. So, Harry had to be completely and perfectly clear about his intentions.
“Hi,” Potter said as casually as if they often visited each other’s homes. He dusted some ash off his robes and sneezed from the debris.
“Potter, slow the fuck down, will you?” His voice was shaky and out of breath. He must have sprinted to catch up with me. He’d been on the other side of the cemetery fence when I took off and somehow managed to catch up.
Harry watched their easy dynamic. That’s another thing that changed about Draco, he was working to make friends who liked him for more than his family's money and influence, which he no longer had. Luna was the best of all the friends he’d made from what Harry saw. They were practically inseparable. Weirder things had happened, Harry supposed, like Harry letting Draco tutor him in potions all year and actually enjoying the time they spent arguing over how best to put a potion together.
“Oh, is that what you were doing? Couldn't tell.” Harry stood up to meet Malfoy’s gaze. The light from their wands danced around them as they moved in closer, circling each other.
Harry groaned. “This is why I never tell you anything. People are in danger. The sun is starting to set. She likely only needs one more sacrifice to activate the nexus. All the Ley Lines are accounted for, so all that’s left is where they all cross. Are we supposed to let someone die while we wait around for him to give us the go ahead?”
A long moment passed. The Succubus’ hand loosened even further, giving Harry a chance to breathe properly. She was distracted looking at Malfoy, so Harry slipped his hand in his pocket. It was the Lock Box. The cool metal felt like heaven in his hand. He just needed to wait for the right moment to toss it at her and end this.
It smelled of dust and mold. Harry coughed one of those wet coughs that are the result of humidity mixed with the dust and mold smell of the mausoleum. The rain fell even more furiously, pounding on the stone roof. It felt wrong to be in here, somehow, like he was intruding on Benchley and his family.
,” Harry said putting extra emphasis on Malfoy’s name. It was partly a tactic, but also partly an actual request because Harry’s will was slipping. The longer he stood this close to Malfoy, the more he felt turned on which seemed absurd because Malfoy had barely done anything except for gently hold Harry. And yet, he could feel the blood coursing through his body, and he could feel his cock growing hard against the fabric of his trousers.
Ryder coughed once to clear his throat. “Uh, sorry. I was...Luna made it seem like,” he stuttered and then took a breath. “Of course, it was nice talking with you guys.”
Though Draco was positive Potter hadn’t really been asking him, he answered, “Like I said, you wouldn’t have to go through this every time you needed something if you just organised your desk. It’s a wonder you get anything done.”
“Brilliant deduction, Granger,” Draco spat out the words, angry that Granger was seeing through him. “You really are the brightest witch in our year. However, you missed one tiny detail.”
“What's that about?” I whispered to Ron as we fell into step behind Hermione who walked with determination past the large water fountain that replaced the statue that fell during the war with Voldemort.
Malfoy had been shown leniency after the war. I’d made sure of it. I spoke at his and his mother’s trial. I let his father rot, the prick. Everyone thought I was mad to speak on their behalf. I did it anyway because I liked that it was the opposite of what everyone expected me to do. He’d gotten off with probation and house arrest for one year. Same for his mother. Now he works at an Apothecary shop in Hogsmeade and freelances with the Ministry creating new potions.
I tilted the vial back and swallowed. The potion tasted like mulled wine, so it could have been worse. It could have tasted like cherry cough syrup like so many other potions that come out tasting like the worst medicine you’ve ever tasted. So many amazing things about being a wizard, but potion’s almost always tasted bad.
Mr. Potter was dashing through the crowd, no doubt headed for the nearest apparation point. Thoughts clouded Draco’s head, but he pushed them away and found his legs carried him after Mr. Potter even though he could not fathom what excuse he could present that would forgive him the harsh words which he laid upon Mr. Potter’s character.
.” His magic, weakened by the Succubus’ kiss, lessened the effect of the spell, only managing to push her a few steps back. But that was enough.
“Thanks, took forever, but I think it’s nearly done.” He looked at his handiwork appreciatively, then his eyes found Luna. She wore a flowing forget-me-not blue sundress and no shoes. She beckoned Neville over with a crooked index finger. He smiled at her and then turned to Harry. “Be back, the woman of my dreams needs me for a moment.”
“No way am I giving you the potion.” He rolled his eyes. “And I did not leave you waiting. Ginny followed you down the hall before I could. I figured you would send her away but you didn’t. When you guys came out looking, well, I thought... I don’t know.”
Harry took a moment to remember what Draco looked like in that moment in case it didn’t happen again. His hair a tousled mess, his lips red from their kiss. He swallowed once and said, “Tomorrow.”
I sipped my coffee slowly, letting what she was saying sink in. I was having a hard time focusing on anything but what Skeeter had said. I don’t think well when I’m tired. The pepper-up only lasted so long before exhaustion took the driver’s seat again. Dean and Seamus had been married a few months ago and recently bought a house. Neville had helped them fix up their garden which was likely the reason for the garden party, but for the life of me I couldn’t remember the invitation. “Right, of course it is.” I was sounding nastier by the minute and she sensed it. “I mean, I’m sorry. I was up all night. I feel like the walking dead right now.”
Potter laughed. “Observant as always, partner.” The stubborn man Draco had known for so long and loved for nearly all that time, tried to stand up only to fall back against the wall for support.
That made Draco choke on the sip he’d been taking. “No. Since when?” Draco downed the rest of the whisky in his cup. “Okay, we really need to find another bottle.
I tore my eyes away from the stone and nodded. Ron was right. There was a lot we didn’t know and the longer we waited, the more people would be in danger.
Harry hovered in a corner of the pitch, watching for a flick of gold against the darkness. He felt his heart pounding in his chest. It was nearly as bad as the time he had to face the dragon in the Triwizard tournament. He wasn’t sure if it was the adrenaline of the game, or who he was playing with, but his body felt as alive as the snitch had in his pocket.
“Explain,” I said once the floo was locked and the wards on the house were checked and double-checked. The only other living being that could get in the house was Kreacher and he wasn’t here now.
Harry could tell Ron reached the description of the Succubus when he let out a low whistle. Harry had to admit, for a demon-witch, she had been hot. Tall, legs that went on forever, and long, raven hair. Not to mention her perfect hourglass shape and the slinky black dress she wore like a second skin. He’d been taken in immediately when he first spotted her at the bar. An impulse had grown in him to talk to her. It was like she’d sucked all the air out of the room and he needed to look her way in order to continue breathing. That’s when he’d realised what she was—who she was—and decided to follow her out of the club. She’d gotten away with Ada Holcomb because he hadn’t been strong enough to resist her magic, the lure of her promise that he wouldn’t have to feel… so much.
