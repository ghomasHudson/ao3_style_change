‘He... he’s still here if that’s what you mean, as for what he does I'm afraid to say for once I do not know, you need to eat’ she added throwing an apple his way, ‘honestly Harry I don’t know what’s gotten into you asking about him... and what do you mean you saw him, he was in the Gryffindor common room?’
‘I know you’re there Draco, please don’t hide from me, it makes me feel like a criminal of something’ he said turning around looking for him, ‘you’re very good at hiding but I don’t want you to’
‘You were following me last night, I think... I don’t think that’s why you left, I believe you were in a situation not unlike my own, you were restless, you couldn’t sleep and so you went for a walk, what you weren’t counting on was me being there... am I getting this right so far?’
The boy was quite knowledgeable on the subject, the more Harry thought about it the more he realized that the answer he gave was something similar to one Hermione would give, dare he say more detailed than she would give. It was quite strange the more he thought about it, his long absences from class, the fact that no one ever saw him anymore, his late-night wanderings, could he have just turned? No, it was nowhere near the full moon, although perhaps he was preparing for his next transformation. Could Draco Malfoy be a werewolf? He now realized it might not be that unlikely. The class drew on and as Harry turned to speak to the boy, he found he was gone.
‘Yeah exactly what Hermione said, it’s a two-way thing Harry, we’re friends and we’re here through battling the dark arts to stupid class essays but you have to do the same for us, does that sound fair?’ Ron asked the two now turning to face him as he nodded in reply to the boys' question.
‘Well I wouldn’t want to make you feel bad... I don’t like it when others make me feel bad and i certainly didn't like it when you did it... I would never do that to you, at least not intentionally...’ he turned to face him, his fangs were exposed and Harry couldn’t tell if that was something he had intended or if it was just a natural state for him at this point, ‘I missed talking to you, I’ll admit that I was kind of hiding from you but I really didn’t want to, all I wanted was to talk to you’
He flipped the projector showing a rather aged looking image of a werewolf with writing alongside it that was barely readable as their textbooks floated in front of them and opened on the page they were to learn about, clearly snape was in no mood for any hesitation in their education or more likely he wanted to get his topic over and done with so he could continue with his usual lesson.
‘No don’t worry silly, you’re fine’ he gave a toothy laugh his fangs showing once more he still hadn’t gotten used to them which made sense as he had only shown them minutes ago, ‘no I wasn’t born with them, I don’t even know if vampires can reproduce beforehand but I think so but no my parents are not vampires. Uh my father had an associate who was a vampire, their business deal didn’t exactly go to plan and instead of punishing him he decided I would be the better prey’ his eyes fell to the floor of the wooden stand.
‘Very good Mr. Malfoy’ Snape acknowledged as he read from the defense against the dark arts textbook, ‘it is as Mr. Malfoy has just said, there are a number of telltale signs of a werewolf from the emotional to the physical yet all are equally important in identifying a werewolf, of course there have been regulations on werewolves since the 1637 werewolf code of conduct formed by the wizarding council, before the time of the ministry of course however more recently in our history the ministry has passed the anti-werewolf legislation making it impossible for werewolves to do much in common society’
"Nothing..." Harry said as nonchalantly as he could. In truth, he was kind of freaking out. Did he... like Draco? No way, he's dating Ginny and he loved her and she's amazing... but as he glanced at Draco he couldn't deny the butterflies in his stomach when they made eye contact for a brief moment.
‘Yes... Well i didn’t go back to my dorm I fell asleep in the great hall but aside from that yeah I would say that’s all pretty accurate description of what happened’ he answered after several minutes of silence.
‘We need to talk Draco, about last night, about today in class, we need to talk about everything’
He walked silently under the light of the moon finding that he was not as alone as he might have thought, although faint his ears had caught the sound of rustling leaves... from behind him. Perhaps the stranger had not being running from him but had been following him all along, if that was true then they were the person that was standing behind him, they were following him. His only question was why? Why was the person following him and what had they been doing out so late? Were they burdened by restless nights like he had been or had they just made a choice like he had to leave their dorm and explore how the night affected the castle like he had?
He walked to the quidditch pitches where he had argued with his classmate the night before, he climbed up the Slytherin spectator stand and sat in the wooden seats, thinking of his Slytherin classmate. He looked around him, the stars shone brightly in the night sky and were the only light to guide him, he could make out all of the constellations and thought back to his astrology classes and how he really should have tried harder, perhaps he might have been able to read his future in the stars so he wouldn’t act like such an idiot all of the time.
As the sun rose on the horizon of the Scottish terrain Harry found his eyes opening and as his vision regained focus, he saw the boy no longer laying in his bed, he had vanished while the boy had fallen asleep. As he jolted up, he looked around the dorm and saw his fellow dormmates were unaffected and still sleeping in their beds. Had it all been a dream? He wasn’t sure anymore. He didn’t want to think of it anymore, he pulled the sweater off of his chest and began to dress in his school robes, his head was still sore from the night before, had the boy crashed into him or had he simply fallen out of bed? He walked over to Ron’s bed shaking him awake, he was running late like he so often did, he had a bad habit for sleeping in as opposed to Harry’s bad habit of not sleeping at all, they were an imperfect duo. Ron let out a groan as Harry poked his rib, he rubbed the sleep out of his eyes as he looked up at his friend's messy hair. He did not speak but lazily picked up his robes and put them on half-heartedly and obviously without looking as he put several items on back to front or inside out before changing them due to Harry’s notifying him. Once ready the two walked out of their dormitory to the great Hall where they met Hermione at their table, she was the brightest witch of their age and also the most dangerous. When a Slytherin student Crabbe had called her a mudblood she had placed a curse on him that had put him in the hospital for a week, Harry had never heard him utter the word since in fact no one had ever said it since, she had become sort of a champion for the less fortunate students at school, the brightest witch of their age was not to be crossed. Ron had also made a mark for himself in the herbology department one that his brothers had never thrived in, the only issue being his extensive knowledge was of deadly, poisonous or dangerous plants, although he could heal the most unhealable wounds with mystical unknown plants, he could also inflict terrible untraceable pain, that with Hermione’s skills for potions had made then quite a deadly match making their dating even more worrying for those around them, they were quite the power couple. That along with Harry being the boy who lived made the golden trio the most well-known group in all of school, their magical skills and knowledge was envied and feared, and despite commonly using it for good the fact that they could use it for evil was all that people worried about or noticed, they had aided in several defeats of the dark lord, if he wasn’t a match for them then who would be? Harry looked at the food in front of him and turned always, he wasn’t hungry, he had an uneasy feeling in his stomach and decided to look beyond Ron who was shoving his face, he lived in a house where if you weren’t quick you didn’t eat and so even the smallest amounts of food were quickly devoured, beyond this he looked at the several other tables and his eyes fell upon the Slytherin’s table.
With nothing but a house crested maroon sweater that covered a pair of boxer briefs he was wearing, Harry walked away from the large dorm window, past his dormmates who lay in their bed and to the dorm's door. The door swung open with his touch and the light of the moon from his window flooded the dorm room as he softly walked down the stairs to the common room looking at the red and gold features of the room. He noticed how the appeal of these combinations disappeared during the night, their hues were better suited to the golden shine of a summer sun or the orange glow of a warm fire during a winter night. But the summer sun shone no longer and no fire was lit, the colours looked more intrusive and aggressive than they had before, his mind wandered to the Slytherin common room and how the pale light of the moon would have been better suited if it shone through the large glass panes that showed the lake, the lake so beautifully reflected the light of the moon but to shine it through the common rooms large glass panes that revealed the lake would be a true beauty to behold.
The light of the moon was not reflected in the mirror although the more he thought of this the more it made sense. The mirror had been enchanted to show the viewer what they truly desired, it did not obey the typical laws of physics, although what item at Hogwarts did? He edged closer to the mirror and sat with him legs crossed in front of it seeing the image he had pushed to the back of his mind so many years ago. He saw his mother and father behind him although the image was slightly different than it once had been, as he sat on the floor so too did his father and mother, kneeling beside him their hands placed on his shoulders, his mother's head laying on top of his head, her other hand running through his messy hair that was so similar to his fathers it was scary. He was so often told of his similarity to his father that it had become like a habit for people to tell him of it, but every time he stood in front of that mirror, he saw what they meant, his messy hair was much like his fathers despite his grandfather Fleamont Potter creating Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion that was designed to tame and style even the most bushy or unruly hair, his jaw shape, his eyebrow shape, they all resembled his father. The only thing that did not resemble his father was his green eyes that were also so often commented on by those who met him.
He continued to walk pretending he had not heard the crackling of the leaves under the feet of those who had been following him. He walked further into the night turning at the whomping willow tree and disappearing from the view of anyone who might have been following. He could hear their footsteps come to a stop and felt their hesitation in the air, they were most likely looking to see where the boy had gone. As he peered from the side of the whomping willow he saw no one standing there before he could even wonder where they had gone, he felt the knock of someone crashing into him as the two were knocked onto the grass and tangled in each other.
“Oi! Potter!” Aziz called from the front desk. “You’re the Were Whisperer, come take a crack at this one.”
The fans on the other side went wild with joy for the length of time it took for the Announcer to call out, “Ballycastle catches the Snitch, but Harpies win the game, a stunning 260 to 250!”
“Don’t we all?” Ron smiled.
Harry stood in front of his wardrobe, slowly buttoning up his shirt. Ginny always said the green brought out his eyes, but as Harry finished the last one he wondered what Draco would say about it. Would he make some comment about Slytherin green, something pithy and smirky? Would he say it matched Harry’s eyes too? Would his eyes merely flick disinterestedly over him? Or, would he come stalking over with his eyes dark and intense the way he had that morning in the parlour?
“I wanted to talk to you about Harry.”
“Oh, uh, I mean, it was sort of high profile, I don’t think I’m supposed to talk about it.” Neville said awkwardly and then glanced over at Ron.
Harry didn’t say it. He could say it, say it loud, say it proud, make the whole fuss. But Draco had opened the door, and that was more important. “Are you going to invite me in?”
Draco lay in the puddle in shock and horror. He raised his gaze to Harry and said, in a very, very small voice. “I’m covered in Neo Death Eater.”
“Just be there for her, you know, hold her hair back kinda thing.”
What made it odd was the taxidermy. Spaced evenly along the walls were stuffed animal heads, zebras, gazelles, lions, tigers, cheetahs, there was even an entire stuffed bear upright in the corner. And for a long moment, Harry couldn’t help but stare at the nearest wall.
She straightened up and shrugged. “‘Cause you feel bad about it afterwards.”
“God,” Tilly moaned. “I am not in the mood for a party, but it is definitely time to get drunk.” They started towards Tavistock and Connaught Hall.
He might have visited Ron, to complain about this, except that Ron was out interviewing witnesses for a cauldron theft. Which left Harry with the unpleasant option of making nice with Maisie, his only other coworker in the room. Maisie was a reasonably good Auror who spent an awful lot of time talking about her copious nieces and nephews, and Harry never could remember any of their names.
“Takes one to know one.” Harry grinned back.
Harry rolled to the side, just enough that he could lay down and press his lips against Draco’s ear without having to hold himself up or crush him. He threw his leg over Draco’s hip and his arm over his chest to rest on that tangle of scars. Harry pressed closer to Draco, as close as he could and whispered, “Draco Lucius Malfoy, you are the most contradictory man I have ever met, and I love you fiercely.”
And Draco broke into a fierce grin, practically bowling over Tilly in his haste to get to the table. “Evan!” he cried.
“What?” Draco glared, and then Harry clarified, “Not a question, just an exclamation.”
“What choice?”
“And?”
“I thought you weren’t arriving until this evening.” Draco said angrily.
“They don’t care about what you're doing.” Harry should really wash his hands and leave, he
“Hermione assures me that’s not possible. You’ve either done something or you know something, and I just want to know.”
And then there would be the conversation topics, the newest Ministry reform to pass, the latest slight to the Sacred Twenty Eight, the indignities suffered by the pure blood elite. Or, from the more liberal families, the latest victories of the new regime, whatever exciting thing Potter had been seen doing (probably speculation on when he might propose, Ha!), and the audacity of one Draco Malfoy to show his face in public. It would be just like his mother’s dinner parties except with more people and fewer places to panic quietly and alone. Draco took a large swallow of his eggnog and slurred, “No, thanks.”
“What is this?” Draco demanded when he could find his voice to speak, showing the will to Weasley. “Why has Potter left me his fortune and house?”
And Draco put his hand in Teddy’s hair, ran his fingers through the thick black locks, and turned his head in towards the sofa so Teddy wouldn’t see him cry. It hurt, more than his ankle and his ribs, more than that bloody mark on his arms or the scars on his chest and hip. The ties that bind.
The sun went down, and Draco felt the sick clench in his stomach. It always started in his stomach, the twist and the squish and the pull as organs shrank and moved, and Draco heaved against the chains around his wrists. Then came the tremors, the shaking and pulsing of his skin so that it jumped as the hair started to come in, thickening, poking new holes in his skin. His bones cracked as they changed, and Draco was grateful when he could finally slip from the cuffs and hit the floor with four paws.
“How do you know?”
And Draco turned to look at Evan. “We need to leave. We need to leave now.”
“I thought you were a Dark Artefacts Specialist?” Harry put his bag down on the back counter next to Draco’s.
“Oh good,” Harry smiled. “I’m not sure I know how to turn on the hob.”
“Then why?”
“Apparently, Atkinson cut into Draco to make him a conduit for more magical power and then held him hostage in his lab until Draco broke out.”
He strained his ears trying to listen for a single noise from inside, but there was nothing. After a full minute, Harry raised his hand to knock again which was when the door cracked open to reveal a tiny sliver of a face and one brown eye.
Tilly looked back for a moment, saw Neil, shrugged and continued on her quest for Paul.
The whole table turned around to see Trevor, and that painful knot that had been building inside Harry’s chest since Oliver’s first touch utterly dissipated. “Trevor.”
But then Jude was standing between them, and Harry realized just how tall Jude had gotten in his last year at school, how much muscle he had put on.
Draco cracked open an eye. “It’s not been a good twenty-four hours.”
“You tried to Crucio me!” Harry shouted back, wrapping his hands in the cotton and yanking him around.
After she left, Alice asked. “Where’s his Pack?”
He stood there, in the grimy alley, and felt something other than hopelessness and nausea.
“We need you to open it.” Weasley was scowling too
The little boy was only a few months older than Hugo.
“Do you want there to be?”
“It’s good to see you, Mr. Potter.” She smiled too, and Harry remembered just why he liked seeing her so much. “I’ve been talking with the other Professors, trying to devise a curriculum for Miss Lowe.”
“So he can curse them! And do all sorts of horrible things.”
“I’ll let you know what happens,” Hermione said to Draco.
It was lovely to know that Draco was there, that if he wanted he could march over to that table any time and sit down for a chat. Except, he knew that if he marched over there, other people would follow, and Harry didn’t think Draco would appreciate that kind of scrutiny. And Ginny was still looking at him, expecting some sort of answer that Harry didn’t know how to give, so he said, “Oh, uh, that’s Jude’s boss. From the bar.”
“I could get you a new wand.”
“Hate makes people do crazy things.”
Harry nodded. The Aurors already knew there were Packs of Weres in London; it wasn’t surprising that Sawyer was in one. “Where did he work?”
Draco pointed at her with his bacon. “That’s true for a lone Werewolf, but like I said you don’t know Pack. The Pack listens to its Alpha, whether human or wolf, wolfsbane or none. Kathleen was the Alpha, she took the wolfsbane and kept the Pack from running wild. That’s the job of the Alpha, to protect the Pack.”
There was no way to answer that question, so Harry stayed quiet in the hopes that it was rhetorical and that Ron would drop it. After a few tense moments, Hermione put a hand on Ron’s arm. “Come on, let’s go.” She linked her arm in his and steered him carefully towards the door.
Hermione dashed around her desk and knelt next to him. “You quit? Your job?”
“I drink my potion every day the week before the full moon, so yes.” Draco took a sip, there wasn’t much left to drink.
“Where’s Draco Malfoy?” He demanded of the attendant who spluttered nervously.
He looked down at his shoes again. “He was lonely; I could tell.”
Draco turned away, and Harry looked down at the menu, Fire Whiskey, Pumpkin Juice, Gilly Water, Mulled Mead, Giggle Water, each with a list of ingredients underneath. Served in a smoked glass, fresh pumpkin and nutmeg, locally sourced. He looked up when Draco appeared back at his end of the bar, they weren’t like the cocktails most familiar to Harry. “What is this?”
“A great big red wolf with a crooked tail?” Draco asked quietly.
“Where the fuck are we, Potter. Some posh muggle house?”
“Ah, Potter, just who I wanted to see. You two, come with me.” And then he was storming the narrow halls and Aurors were ducking into the nearest cubicle or flattening themselves against the walls in an effort to stay out of the way. Robards inspired that kind of action. Harry was pretty sure he was the only one who was immune. But then, Harry had faced down Voldemort, so, maybe he was.
“You don’t have the right to give him orders! You will not treat him like he’s some runt in a litter!”
The lifts behind them dinged.
“What else would I be talking about?”
He was sitting on the bed with his arms wrapped around one knee, turned away from Harry to look out the window. “I just wanted to make sure you were okay up here.” Harry straightened up, but didn’t cross into the room.
He crossed carefully over the threshold and shut the door behind him. “Is this where you live?”
“That’s my point! You need someone who can stand next to you. Someone who sits at your table at pub night, and can go to the Ministry parties with you.”
Friday they ate at the canteen. Draco had finished the last of the eight laptops that morning, and was busy thinking about his plans for the evening when Ron suggested the canteen because they had Harry’s favorite, treacle tart. Draco hovered for just a moment outside the double doors when Harry put his hand on the small of his back. He didn’t say anything, just a pressure letting Draco know he was there.
“Whiskey, neat.” He smiled back.
“Oh, so it’s my fault your nosey friends are butting into my place?! I suppose it’s my fault that you have spent the last thirty minutes talking about how I’m the worst person since the Dark Lord and that I need to be vanquished?! Well, what are you waiting for, huh? We’re in a bathroom, the perfect place for you to cut me open again!”
“She finally got you to move out of this place, and you think she’s gonna be okay with me kipping on your sofa?” Jude gave Harry a look because they both knew Ginny liked it better when Jude lived somewhere else, that she liked having a place of their very own, that she had shuddered a little when Harry had suggested she move into Grimmauld Place.
“You never do,” she said with a smile.
“Werewolf population.” Harry rolled his eyes.
“We are trying to instigate some reforms to the Anti-Werewolf legislation and I wanted to speak with all of you to have a better understanding of how these laws impact your lives and what changes could be most beneficial to you and the wizarding populations.”
“Who are they?” Harry asked.
He was beautiful, all that thick white fur, and Harry sort of wanted to open the door, cross the room, and sink his hands into all that softness. He wanted to run his hands along Draco’s sides, and scratch behind his ears, and press their foreheads together. It was nearly overwhelming, the urge to be close to him, to stay near during this time. And Harry squeezed his fists until his knuckles turned white. Draco had a Mate, he wouldn’t want this kind of attention from Harry, even if he and Harry didn’t have all that other history. Even if Harry wanted it.
Asortia put her hand over his. “As you said, ten years you’ve been gone. Many things have changed in that time. And many things can change in the next ten. I am sure that given a little time, you would be able to find your place here.”
“She mentioned Harry.” Draco swallowed. “He told her how to find me. He told the Aurors, that’s why Longbottom was here.” He squeezed his eyes shut.
“That’s a panic attack,” Draco said calmly.
“I don’t know,” Hermione said quietly because Harry was on the verge of a breakdown, the size of which she hadn’t thought possible.
Atkinson smiled at him, and Harry realized he had sort of a nice face. Eyes with crinkles that made him look like he knew how to laugh, a double dimple on the left side, wide lips that looked as if they could laugh loudly. It was hard to see how fit he might be, underneath all those menacing robes, but Harry got a first hand look at just how Draco might have fancied himself in love with this man. “Good morning, Harry. I just wanted to thank you for all your assistance in recovering my artifact.”
It was another thirty minutes before Harry could escape the fawning masses and find another drink. And it was with great relief that he saw Draco at the bar. “Enjoying the evening?” He asked.
Wednesday was mind numbingly slow, and Draco wished for something lively. He spun his phone across the counter and then slapped his hand down to stop it. Tilly often commented that he needed a fidget spinner, something to occupy his hands when he was busy being morose, and Draco scowled at her, and she cocked her head to the side and said brightly, “Love you!”
Draco kept his eyes closed even as the two of them crossed the floor, as Teddy put his hand on Draco’s side, as the little girl put hers there too.
“Hey,” Harry reached out and grabbed Malfoy’s elbow. “I need to stop over there.” He pointed across the hall.
“Perhaps we should talk in the office?” Draco offered, hands clearly visible, voice calm.
Harry’s mouth gaped. “But I haven’t solved the case yet. There’s no information on how he stole the artifact, the Department could use that to revamp their security. If Malfoy was able to steal something, someone else can get in.”
Blaise did a sad smile as he followed Draco with his eyes and shared a knowing look with Pansy. The other students in the Great Hall looked around in confusion because - did Draco Malfoy just follow Harry Potter outside the Great hall, that's weird.
"May I ask what is so funny?" Draco demanded, annoyed.
"Of course I have, Malfoy I just don't particularly want to think about your's or Zabini's mouth." Draco had to admit that he was slightly impressed that Harry managed to quip a comeback so easily.
Harry
(See the end of the chapter for
"I was-just out late! With-with Pansy!"
Yeah, we get it, you're in love. Harry loves Ginny but you didn't see them draped all over each other all the time!
"As I recall, you drank when Pansy asked if anyone had thought about someone in this room while wanking?" A thunder of laughter ruffled through the eighth years and Draco burned a dark red.
"Yes!" Harry said all too quickly. "Uh, yes, I'm fine. Thanks for coming to check on me." The fact that Draco took the time out of his day to come make sure he was okay... that just made Harry's stomach do backflips. Maybe he likes me as much as I like him? Or... maybe he's just friends with Hermione now and he wants to be nice...
Ron looked between his best friend and his girlfriend. "What the bloody hell am I missing here?"
"Hey, you two... what's up?" He asked sceptically.
? How is anything supposed to happen if you don't? Look, I know you say he doesn't like you and, whatever, maybe he doesn't. But, you're never going to know for sure unless you talk to him about it. Look at 'Mione and me, huh? I mean I was
The non answer she got from Draco was as clear as if he would have screamed it from the rooftops. She just gave him a look that made Draco trust her implicitly. Fucking Gryffindors...
Harry joined Hermione and Ron. "I still can't get used to the fact that Bill is our teacher." Harry said, putting his bag down.
She leaned in, and whispered "Don't worry just pretend I have shorter hair, glasses and maybe a lightning scar on my forehead." He almost punched her, but then went in for the kiss.
Who takes the cake for shutting a room up, Draco or Harry? Draco won this round.
"So... you-you
"Everything... like...?"
"You can call him 'Draco'," Ron said, fidgeting with his hands while looking down at his lap. "I mean... if that's what you want to call him. You can. You can do whatever you want. You know? Like... if you want to... call him 'Draco' then call him 'Draco' and I'll support you. I just don't want you to think I wouldn't-" It was Harry's turn to cut Ron off.
"Look, Malfoy. Harry hasn't come out to everyone he wants to yet so don't go blabbing your mouth about it, okay?"
"Yes you are if you seriously think Potter doesn't like you. God, men are idiots I swear. Thank Merlin I don't have to deal with this. Potter has the major hots for you, you complete and utter wanker."
"Anyway... it's not like anything is going to happen. We're too different and there's too much history."
No, it doesn't mean anything... so Draco kissed him. It definitely doesn't mean anything to Draco... and not to him either. No way. At least that's what he told himself.
at Dinner, with an added verse of
"Not yet...we aren't ready to tell anyone...please, guys."
Blaise glanced at Draco and then spoke up, "I'm bored. Let's play 'What Are The Odds'" he said, smirking.
"So... want to try and find an unlocked, empty classroom?"
"Of course not, Blaise." They headed in front of them.
"And you've... you know...had sex with him? I mean I just know that you were um... a virgin... so..." Ron added, quite awkwardly.
"I-yeah. I guess I do."
Draco
"You should have seen his face, I felt terrible for him." He heard a voice that belonged to Draco.
Draco felt tears prickling at his eyes, but he would
's neck, do you?" Blaise smirked.
He went down to the common room, hoping to find him... no luck. Then he thought about Harry.
"We're getting invited places by Gryffindors now. Merlin, next thing you know a Hufflepuff will ask me to go to the ball with them." Greg said, disgusted. "You lot can count me out. Like I want to be seen with that group."
"I don't know. Something changed. Everything changed."
She smiled, turned and walked away.
"I mean, it was very embarrassing on his part." Harry rolled his eyes and guessed the next voice to be Blaise.
Was he obvious in his attractions? He didn't think so.
"Shut up, Pansy..." was all Draco could muster up to say.
"You aren't being a really good friend today, Pansy." Draco said, frowning and crossing his arms. Pansy all but exploded.
He stopped so suddenly he almost fell backwards. "Huh... What?"
"I thought you were staying upstairs, Harry?" Ron asked.
"Well... I'm certain
"Yeah, because I'm the only one who thinks it's dumb. You agree with me, right Harry?" Ron asked, desperate to not be alone in this.
"Oh, I always am, Potter" Draco said, smirking.
- you dumb git!" Pansy yelled, again.
"Never Have I Ever?," Draco asked, "What, are we first years?"
"What is there about me to like? I'm insufferable... gods especially back then... Everyone 'likes' me because I'm Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived. The Chosen One. No one wants me for... me." Harry turned away, surprised by Draco's confession. The lack of confidence Harry had made Draco so upset because he couldn't see everything that he was to him.
"Why don't we try again... I mean I know we said... that it wasn't the right timing but... maybe it's right now." Draco said, between each kiss and bite he left on Harry's neck.
"Well, dinner?" She asked.
Harry had been so concerned about Ron and Hermione being missing, he didn't even realize that the Hogshead was empty besides himself and a few workers. He looked around and not a single soul was dining. He turned the corner and saw a beautiful sight. There were flowers and candles set on a table with a beautiful tablecloth. There were pillows surrounding the table in colors of red and green...
"Just curious, is all..." Harry said sheepishly.
"I-I-I-Well... I-" For some reason, almost every word in the English language was leaving his brain and he suddenly couldn't form a coherent lie to tell Granger that, no bloody way does he fancy Harry Potter, because he does. He really does.
"I don't know how to start other than, I'm sorry." Harry started. "I can't believe I said those things to you and I can't imagine you'd even want to forgive me... I never wanted to-" Harry was talking a mile a minute, but Ron cut him off.
"Erm...uh...sorry...you two...I was just uh-just going..." Potter pathetically stammered.
Once again, that adorable blush made it's way onto Harry's perfect skin. "Well, anyway, why are you getting ready to sleep in here?"
"Yes, Po-Harry...," He just called him Harry, that felt really good, "for everything I've ever done or said to you. I was an obnoxious prat and I needed attention from you and I-" Draco stopped abruptly. What is the matter with you, he silently berated himself. Great, way to go Draco you just told Harry you need attention from him. He tried to continue with some dignity, "and I well I was completely out of line. I grew up in a horrible environment and I know that's not an excuse but..." Oh, Gods... was he rambling? Yes, he was definitely rambling, god dammit.
"I'm not very good, but that sounds lovely. Now?"
He hoped no one had seen, but Draco let a few tears fall during Harry's speech. He wanted more than anything to just run up to him and hug him, and tell him that no one was ever going to hurt him again. But, he couldn't. So he just sat there. Draco couldn't believe that Harry thought that way. The poor kid actually thought everything was his fault.
When they broke for air the only thing that Draco could think of saying was "What... the hell...?"
"What are the odds that the guy I... well...like, with a girlfriend, is bi." He said.
"None of your bloody business, Potter!" Draco didn't know why he suddenly yelled at him that way but when he saw Harry's hurt expression his face softened.
"If you did, I imagined the same thing." Harry turned round in his seat to face Hermione and Draco.
Draco almost threw up, that was worse then Never Have I Ever. There's no way anyone would want to play that, right?
‘Knowledgeable on this topic, aren’t we?’ snape inquired as he corrected himself, ‘making it extremely difficult for werewolves to do much in common society, does that suit you better Mr. Malfoy?’ with an embarrassed nod Snape continued the lesson but Harry wasn’t listening he was too focused on the boy across from him.
‘Uh no... I was... well I was out’
‘Well Harry it appears you’re question from early has been answered, he’s right there’ she was right he walked forward all eyes locked on him as he sat in the desk to the side of Harry, they both sat at the table at the edge the only thing parting them was the gap in the center on the class for students to walk through the two sides of the class to each set of tables. Snape made no comment about his late arrival instead turning on a projector to show the image of... a werewolf, hadn’t they learned this when Snape had taken over for Lupin?
What happened next was not what Harry had been expecting, in fact he would have preferred literally anything else, because at that very moment Draco Malfoy was laughing at him. His laugh was soft yet had an unintentional mocking tone to it, and had an infectiousness to it that made Harry want to laugh with him, but Harry did not want to laugh, he felt incredibly awkward sitting there as the boy's laughter slowed and finally stopped his grey eyes meeting Harry’s green ones.
‘Well now I just feel stupid....’ he sighed shaking his head, ‘I really thought I was on to something’
‘Well I don’t know whether to lie or to tell the truth and have you reprimand me’ before she could open her mouth to call him and idiot or whatever she was going to say she added, ‘in my defense it naturally flowed into the conversation we were having at the time and I asked him in a non-accusing way and he laughed about it and we moved on from that subject quite quickly, it wasn’t a big thing or anything like that and he didn’t seem to care... he’s a good kid it’s a shame that so many people whisper and spread rumors about him, he’s nothing like they say he is, nowhere close to that’ his eyes fell slightly, thinking about he was no better than the people he was talking about, he had gotten overexcited and asked him to bite him, he wasn’t going to tell them that of course, they would absolutely flip and it wasn’t really his place to tell anyone, it was Draco’s.
‘Out?’
‘That’s not fair, you shouldn’t have had to deal with it’ his voice raised slightly in anger, ‘it wasn't your burden to bear, to hide away, it’s not fair!’ the boy grabbed his hands as he looked up at him his voice calmed as his grey eyes fell onto him.
‘Yeah Harry said you and him had been talking quite a bit more’ Hermione interrupted pulling a disgusted look at his piggish manner of eating, ‘Ronald and I found it quite funny at his thinking you were a werewolf I mean how ridiculous is that?’ she let out a slight chuckle as did the rest of them, of course the other two were not aware as to why they were laughing or the secrets that they knew about Draco.
Once he had finished, he wiped the blood off of his chin and the two began to dig up dirt together and buried the bowtruckle and covered it in the dirt. He looked at the boy smiling as the two of them sat together by a tree talking about his eating his experience and how interesting Harry found it.
He had snuck out of his dorm past curfew many times before with his friends Hermione and Ron under the light of the moon but that was nothing compared to this. Those times he had been searching for a way to defeat Voldemort or searching for answers when he shouldn’t have been, using his invisibility cloak to conceal himself. This time was not like that. No invisibility cloak lay on his shoulder, only the red sweater, leaving him exposed in a quite literal way and to the revelatory nature of the moons light and he was not searching for answers, at least not in that way. He was searching for the truth in himself, and he hadn't even realised it. There was something missing in his life, something missing in him. He felt fragmented, like a shard of his mirror was missing, perhaps that was why he had found it so difficult to sleep lately, because how could he sleep if he wasn’t fully himself quite yet? His mind was constantly flowing with thoughts, of things both dark and demented, he had seen horrors and as much as he would smile and pretend, he was doing fine he knew that what he had been through would forever leave a lasting effect on his mind.
‘Draco... I think we have an issue...’ he looked at the boy and the blonde-haired boy beside him almost jumped in fear as he saw what he was talking about, the boy’s teeth had now become fangs. He had turned Harry into a vampire.
He exited his dormitory and out to the school grounds in a similar fashion to the previous night, this time however he was not following a mysterious shadow, this was his choice. He passed the whomping willow and edged towards the quidditch pitches once again hearing the familiar sound of leaves crunching behind him, this time however he stopped and turned seeing the pale faced boy standing behind him, his eyes scanning him.
‘Harry, Ron look’ she held the paper in front of them as she read it aloud, ‘Hogsmeade residents have reported a serious of animal attacks, large teeth marks have been found in a variety of livestock leading residents to believe there is a werewolf on the loose in Hogsmeade... it couldn’t be... could it?’
The soft cool touch of the pale moonlight tickled the young wizard’s skin as it poured through the large window in the Gryffindor common room, it had cradled him softly to sleep for many nights but tonight all it did was keep him awake as his soft green eyes glowed in the light that reflected in them. The month of October had brought a cool crisp air that had made breath visible and caused faces to become hidden beneath scarves and jumpers, Harry didn’t mind the cold though, he found it comforting for some reason. Perhaps it was because it reminded him of his cupboard under the stairs, while the actions of the Dursleys were cruel and he knew no child should have to sleep in that condition it was still a comfortable memory. The cupboard had been his sanctuary in that hell hole of a house, his room, his space, it was the only place the Dursleys never entered, it had not been tainted by their touch. Due to its lack of insulation the winters had been cold, a temperature he had gotten used to and had come to enjoy, the chilled air that had fallen upon Hogwarts brought him that feeling of sanctuary, as brief as it might be in those moments.
He walked further into the forest as the trees around him grew heavier and the light from the moon disappeared behind the trees, somehow the further he seemed to walk into the forbidden forest the colder he seemed to get, he wanted the boys wrapped around him to keep him warm and he wasn’t getting it at that moment. The noises of creatures around him appeared to increase but appeared to be moving away from him and further away, meaning they were running away from something or someone... Draco. He edged forward into the woods hoping the person that they were running from was in fact Draco and not some dark wizard who had come to kill Harry, either way at least he wouldn’t be alone anymore, he would have company one way or another and perhaps the cool touch of death would remind him of the cold touch of the boy he had grown to care for, his Draco Malfoy.
‘Sorry I know this is a little unpracticed but uh Harry and I got to talking last night and went over something and I though its time he introduced me to you too, us being... friends and all now’ he answered their concerned looks and hoped it would answer their questions as he ate a plate of pancakes rising some stares from other Gryffindor students but no one made a comment.
That next morning in the Great Hall at the breakfast table he was speaking with Hermione and Ron when he felt the presence of someone sitting beside him and as he turned to his surprise, he saw that it was Draco Malfoy sitting beside him. Hermione and Ron sat slack mouthed at the unprompted presence of the boy looking at one another for an answer but they could not find one in each other and so looked to Harry for an answer but he wasn’t even paying attention he was too focused on the Slytherin boy sitting at the Gryffindor table, a first in history.
Harry waited outside his dorm room that night for Draco, they had planned to meet but the boy was nowhere to be seen much to his disappointment. He decided it best to walk, hoping the boy would find him but the further he walked from the castle and the longer he walked on his own he felt slightly isolated in the cold of the night. As he walked further, he heard a noise coming from further in the distance and thought it might be Draco playing a game with him and so he decided it best to play along following the direction the noise had come from. As he walked further, he realized the noise he had heard was coming from the forbidden forest, but he supposed the danger might be a part of the fun for him and so saw no reason not to go into the forest anyway.
‘No, it couldn’t' Harry answered shaking his head, already knowing what she was going to suggest, ‘i spoke to him last week, he has a large supply to keep him from transforming and he’s with Tonks anyway, she wouldn’t have let this happen... this was something else’
The stranger had all but disappeared, he couldn’t see them in the dark of the night, despite the light of the moon lighting his path their shadow was nowhere to be seen, he had completely lost them or he supposed they had completely lost him had that been their intention. As he looked around him, he noticed the lack of life that was present on the school grounds. In the corner of his eye he could swear he saw the movement of a shining tentacle in the lake as it slithered softly through the water. He would ask himself why the beast was awake at this time of night although he supposed he could not judge it; he too was restless in the night and understood why it might be awake at this time of night. Maybe it too was following a mysterious shadow it had seen under its waters. Hopefully the giant squid was having more luck than he was at finding the owner of its shadow.
‘So, it’s not like triggered by anything?’
‘Oh no Harry you did not’ Hermione looked rather shocked, Ron seemed not to understand what she was talking about, ‘please tell me that us not talking you out of it did not lead you to talking to Draco about, or Merlin forbid... actually accusing that poor boy of being a... of being a werewolf’ she hissed the last point in a whispered voice so as to not gain attention from the classmates that were around them.
‘Coconut water... huh I never would have known’ he said giving a nod, ‘so uh... how did it happen, you weren’t born like that were you? N-not that there would be anything wrong with that I just never would have guessed if you were’
‘I don’t hate you Potter... I just thought you were different I- I hoped you were different’ he walked around the boy leaving him there, alone in the cold October night.
The soft sound of footsteps that echoed slightly through the corridors revealed to Harry that he was not alone wandering these halls and while he should have felt nervous at it being a professor or Filch, something in him knew that it was someone in a position similar to his own and in an action almost like a dream his feet wandered the halls the cold touch of the stone staircases beneath his feet increasing with every step he took towards the sound he had heard moments ago. He regained his focus from his dream like walk when he stood in front of the mirror of Erised, an object he had not seen since his first year in the magical school when he had his first encounter with the dark lord that had continued to terrorise his life ever since that day when he had picked the blood red philosophers stone out of his pocket upon it’s revelation from his reflection when he looked in the mirror. That was before its inevitable destruction, he still felt guilty in a manner like his actions were the reason Nicholas Flammel and his wife were going to die, while this obviously wasn’t true the thought sometimes crossed his mind and saddened him.
thanks for reading. hope you enjoyed. i know it's short but i like this chapter a lot so i hope you do as well! (:
Finally, they pulled apart and Harry couldn't stop staring at Draco's lips. They looked so soft, and really big and plump. He wondered what it would be like to kiss him. It would probably feel warm and smooth. He assumed Draco would be a little harsh, but tender and sweet as well. What if he-
"Would you like to go to the Quidditch Pitch with me?"
They started walking to McGonagall's classroom and, what do you know, they ran into Ron and Harry.
Harry tensed up. "What are you talking about, Ron? What's going on?" Harry looked around the hall, concerned on why people were still gawking at him.
the weasley's do some talking and draco does some 'decorating' with an unlikely friend(:
how much he liked Potter, Pansy was quite done hearing about that bloody Gryffindor.
"That does!" Harry snapped. "'The Savior', 'The Boy Who Lived', 'The Chosen One', all of those! That bothers me!"
Still, he couldn't control his insane feeling of jealousy bubbling inside. As he was leaning over the sink the door opened to none other than Harry Potter.
"Yes, please announce it to the whole world!" Draco said it a loud whisper.
"Mmm what is it- mmm, about my neck that you- love so much." Harry said, panting furiously.
"Back to that are we? Thought we were friends. What is it, Draco? I can help."
"Love you too."
"You're welcome. Now are you going to tell me why you've locked yourself in here all day feeling sorry for yourself?"
"Alright, don't tell me. I'll find out eventually," she looked at him with a loving expression, "Please don't stop being my friend, Harry. I think I'll always need you in my life."
"Worth it." He said into Draco's ear. He didn't get a response, but the smirk on Draco's face was answer enough.
these boys are dumb and they suck at basic communication skills.
Harry
"Yes?"
"What? Where!?" He grabbed a spoon and tried to look at his reflection. "Hey, there's no hickey..."
"Spit it out, Ron!"
When Blaise got back from the loo, he hopped in his own bed, and saw that their other dorm mates weren't in yet. Blaise, being the horrific friend he was said, "Who topped?"
"Blaise and I... are seeing each other." Hermione's jaw hung open.
"So you know how terrifying it is to be in the same room as him?"
"Blaise... we're ...uh- you and me, I mean, we're-"
"Sounds good. We can tell the 8th years at breakfast tomorrow. See you, G-Hermione."
something ALMOST happens (;
"So, What Are The Odds?" Harry asked, a smile on his face.
Blaise put his hands up in surrender. "Hey, I didn't say anything."
Harry
Later that night, Draco was feeling sorry for himself and didn't go to dinner. He avoided everyone all day by hiding out in his and Blaise's room. He may or may not have locked Blaise out and
"Well, originally, but then she decided we could just meet up and plan what we think it should be..."
Pansy and Blaise decided to leave for breakfast while Draco stayed in his room.
"Every Gryffindor I know..." He replied, smirking heavily.
Blaise sauntered over and sat next to Draco. He looked absolutely knackered... Oh, he was going to enjoy this.
"Great. Have a Happy Christmas, Harry."
"Hey! Ron what the fuck!?"
For some reason, when Harry woke up the next morning he felt well rested, which wasn't common. He realized that was the first dreamless sleep he had in a long time.
"I'm fine, don't worry about me." Draco said quickly. He looked back and saw Blaise in his usual spot with his legs extended on the empty chair, he was talking to Pansy and laughing about something.
"Well, don't look so nervous," Draco quipped, "I can't believe this...really?"
"Nice hickeys, Potter." Blaise said holding back a chuckle when Harry took his seat. Harry didn't have a comeback in him right now and just wanted to crawl in a hole
"Don't worry about that, Draco. Harry is oblivious to almost everything. Sometimes I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing." She laughed, more to herself than anything.
He could never have that with Draco...
"Draco... I wasn't brought up in the Wizarding World. But, I do know that growing up in a Pure-Blood family, like your own, things were shoved down your throat and you were forcibly taught all the wrong things. Just the fact that you apologized to me proves that you're not an awful human being," Hermione took Draco's hands as she said this last part, "and I forgive you."
cry in front of Harry. Not now. So, Harry knew Draco was in love with him and he didn’t want to continue because of it… how did he figure it out? He thought that he played it off as just sexual attraction, but it didn’t work the way he thought, obviously.
"He said that?" Draco asked, hopefully.
"Alright then..." She went into the bathroom and quickly changed into her robes, "let's go then..." She walked to the door.
"Uh...Draco?" He was snapped out of his daze about Harry.
"We know." Blaise said, eyeing him. "We uh- it's sort of all over school that... well... you and Potter... well, She-Weasley and Potter.... well...." He looked to his friends for help but all of them kept their mouths shut.
"Will you be my boyfriend then?" Harry asked.
Suddenly the common room door opened, and he saw him. Draco’s breath caught in his throat as he made eye contact with Harry. The man he had long awaited to see for the two weeks he’s been gone…
"Yes it is! I'm not doing it, Ron help me out here."
"Ok." Draco said.
Where are they? Ron said 6pm... right? He was looking around at the meeting place Ron assigned him. He didn't even want to come out, it was Ron and Hermione's idea, since he's been so mopey about Draco, and they're not even here on time.
"You know, rosy cheeks, swollen lips, mischievous sparkle in the eye."
"Yes, well, anyway... Hermione won't tell me what is missing from my drunken memories... she told me I needed to ask you... and I can't tell if this is a
"I'm... you're with... me?" He responded. And... what good will it do Harry to lie about it anymore?
"Hey Pansy, Millie... uh- do you-would you...Uh, Millie would you mind if uh- if I talked to Pansy about something please?" He finally managed to say. Jeez, being nice takes a lot more work than being an arsehole.
"Oh... wow. I mean, that's great! Blaise is great! I'm just- shocked. I never pictured you two together. So, you really like him?" Hermione smiled. Ginny blushed and started playing with her hair.
don't hate harry! you'll get his insight into why he broke it off with draco next chapter, he has a really good reason i promise!
"Right... totally. I believe you! Except for the fact that you're lying through your teeth and you have an everlasting boner for
"I-uh-well... sometimes I like to walk around when I want to avoid people..."
But, not having Harry in his life at all would kill him more. And, because Draco didn’t care how hurt he would be not having Harry the way he wanted him… because in whatever way Harry
about him. Please. Help me help my brother." Ron said. There are very few things in life that Ron gets passionate about. Hermione,
Thankfully Blaise opened his mouth and said "Well, be on your way then." and pulled him into another kiss.
"What's your favorite memory as a child?" Draco asked. Harry was caught off guard.
"See you, Harry." Hermione called as Harry had already left the table.
"And I was going to retaliate for the punch he gave me until Harry stepped in." Draco said.
"Thanks for that. Let's go before we're late."
"Y-y...yeah... yeah. Draco and I are kind of... dating? It's a bit complicated but... yeah. You and Blaise?" Harry smirked.
"You know Ron doesn't care that you two are together, right?" Hermione said softly.
Hello! This chapter has some fun games in it hehe.... and yes it'll be predictable but it wouldn't be an 8th year fic without it. Enjoy!(;
"Like Draco said... he thought there was something in his-" Harry tried to respond but Ron cut him off.
They got in the classroom as the lesson was beginning, and were instantly greeted with a
"We don't have a- I didn't-! We never- Harry and I didn't-!" Draco stuttered, before Ron cut him off.
"Untrue. I was just an arrogant prick. I was brought up that way and never taught anything different. I never actually believed in all that rubbish without my father pushing it down my throat. It's bullshit. No one is better than anyone else just because our cousins fucked each other. I mean that makes no goddamn sense. You're an idiot Goyle." Draco said.
"Cool..."
"You know what I think of when I hear those names?" He said quietly, but not to a point where people couldn't hear him. Harry looked up, surprised that it was Draco that spoke up. "I think of a kid who gave everyone hope. You were the face of the war Harry, and not in a bad way. In a bloody wonderful way. You're the reason everyone had the courage to go on. I mean you walked to your death at the mere age of 17! You were ready to lay down your life to save everyone. When Hagrid brought you back and The Dar-... V-Voldemort... announced that you were dead..."
"You talk... so much for someone who is half naked right now." Draco laughed. He pulled Harry in to a deep kiss and he felt like the entire world disappeared. How can one person be as amazing as the man beside him? How can he be lucky enough to be kissing him. In this moment, Draco didn't care if he and Harry would end up together. All he cared about was this perfect boy and this perfect moment...
. Harry couldn't wait to get home.
"Please, Draco. Tell me what happened!" Harry begged.
"Ow! What was that for?" Draco said rubbing where Pansy hit him.
"Well, it's not the first time I've attempted to be straight." Draco said, Pansy chuckled.
"Greg, we all want to forget about the horrors of The Dark Lord. Yeah he bribed us and manipulated us... but that's all bullshit like Draco said. You can continue your hate and keep being a spoiled, obnoxious prick... but the rest of us?," she glanced around to the Slytherins all around her, "we're going to take a lesson from the heroes." Pansy said.
. Just something to do whilst I'm bored, I suppose." He responded coldly.
"Yeah... she said she thinks I like someone else..."
"I don't know!" Harry said abruptly. "I... don't... I don't know. I- I can't explain it... It's just I..." He trailed off. He had no idea what he was feeling, let alone any idea of how to explain it to Ron.
"So, what's going on with you and Potter? I didn't miss the way you were flirting in Potions." Pansy said. "And, don't bother lying darling. I know you too well."
"Shush it. Don't deny it."
"He finally told you? Jeez, it's about time."
Draco was pretty sure he wasn't breathing right, and may never breathe right again because Harry Potter was single and evidently bisexual and likes someone else. Could that 'someone else' be him? Should he get his hopes up?
"Spit it out, Malfoy." Draco sat down next to her.
"So, Granger and Weasley. You reckon the two of you are forever or something disgustingly romantic like that?" Pansy asked, slurring.
"Lemon drops." Harry said and smiled sadly to himself and then watched as the office revealed itself.
"Erm... uh... sorry ... you two... I was just uh- just going..." Harry managed to stammer out.
"Yes?" He turned a bit to face Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
Blaise is dating Ginny? Ginny??? Potter's ex girlfriend...
"Well D-Malfoy, you don't need to be embarrassed I think most people who fought in the war get nightmares... I know I do."
"I saw her crying in the corridor the same day that her and Potter broke up and we started talking... and I walked her back to her common room. We made plans to hang out the next day. We hung out that next day, just in an empty corridor and talked for hours. Then we kissed and she felt really guilty because she had only just broken up with Potter... but I told her that she had nothing to feel guilty about. We are keeping it secret because she's not ready for Weasley to know... and for Potter to know either. I don't blame her."
"Well, no shit." He laughed, "I love you too. Now, let's go. You can drool about Potter while Pansy is talking. You never listen to her anyway."
"You look worn out, Potter. Up late were you?" Draco smirked. Harry blushed, but smiled at him. He looked at Draco, shocked. Harry very clearly look tired and drained. But, of course, Draco
Looking at Harry, Draco couldn't help wondering if he seemed... jealous? But... there was no way... was there?
Draco
"My potions essay, really? Discreet, 'Mione." Harry laughed.
Draco
"How can you go from 'kind of, sort of, liking him a little bit'  to being arse over tit about him. It doesn't make any sense." Ron said as he was changing into his pajamas.
"Just give me the damn potion...please."
"You-you.... k-kissed me..." Draco managed to get out.
"Does it have something to do with Potter?"
"In real life, Pans! Not in rumors people have made up about us! God Dammit! Every time I care about something people find a way to ruin it for me." His friends tried to stop him but he ran off, not really caring where he ended up.
"No. That would be someone who wasn't really your best friend. I am always honest... and honestly? You're an idiot. Falling for Potter? Dumbest thing you could do. Well, except for me...falling for my best friend." Blaise had a joking tone but still, Draco could tell there was more to the playful theme.
‘Uh oh yes well Draco this is Hermione and this is Ron but I think you know that anyway from having classes with us, Hermione’s like the smartest witch ever and is obviously top of our year but if I remember correctly you were catching up to her there with your grades you might have some competition there, and Rons very good at Herbology and all of that’ he knew he was ranting but couldn’t seem to stop his mouth from moving, ‘Draco and I apparently have a similar interest in quidditch and that’s actually where we met and talked last night, isn’t that so weird’ he shoved his mouth with toast to stop himself from talking any more for fear he might reveal that the two of them had kissed, he didn’t know how Draco would feel about him giving that information away.
‘Hey Hermione, you know that Slytherin kid... Draco Malfoy?’ her gaze had fallen on the boy sitting across from her, ‘do you know where he is? I think I saw him last night but... but I'm not sure, does he still come to classes or?’ she swallowed her toast with a look on her face as though she was looking like a mad man, although he supposed he might sound like one when he randomly asked about an elusively rumored about boy.
‘Finish’ he said nodding to the bowtruckle
He brushed the boy's white blonde hair out of his eyes revealing a slight scarring on his head most likely from the two of them crashing into one another, although now that he thought about it, they hadn’t exactly crashed into one another, the blonde-haired boy had crashed into him, after following him for a majority of the night. He lifted his sleeve to the boy's head wiping the blood from his head, although as he wiped it away, he realised the blood was not Draco’s but was in fact Harry’s, he hadn’t even realised he was bleeding until then and as he lifted his hand to his head, he found that his hand had more blood on it than he would prefer, that being none. As the blood dripped from his hand onto the grass, he wiped it on his maroon sweater, if it stained it would be hard to notice and if anyone did, they would assume it was from a rather eventful quidditch match. The boy below him moved slightly letting out a soft groan, he rubbed his hand on the boys head hoping to soothe him, he felt that the rest might actually do him some good, he looked like he needed it, Harry wished it had been enough to knock him out too although he realised they would both then be helpless and vulnerable if they were knocked out in the middle of the Hogwarts grounds in the cold of the October weather without anyone to care for him. Now the duty of care fell upon him, despite not knowing him very well or at all now that he thought of it, he still had a responsibility to take care of him stalker like tendencies or not, he was hurt and alone... he would put an end to those two things as quickly as he could, he had already fixed the alone part, although he was knocked out, he enjoyed the boys' company.
He dragged his feet across his bedsheet and placed them softly on the aged wooden floor that was cool to the touch, cooler than the air even, a feeling which he had thought was impossible. He stood to the window looking at the moonlight and the landscape of Hogwarts that lay before him, it looked different like this. As unrealistic as the landscape of Hogwarts always was, its magical aspects and all, when the moon hit it like this it looked like an ornate oil painting that belonged under heavy guard in a high-class museum, not somewhere real, not a real location for him to be staying at, not a place for a boy like him to be. He always feared that he might someday wake up back in that cupboard under the stairs and his return to the life he had so narrowly escaped upon Hagrid’s arrival to the lighthouse he had been forced by the Dursleys to move to due to their best attempts at hiding Harry’s true nature from him.
‘Yes... Yes, you are’ he answered quite honestly after sitting in silence.
The two walked onto the quidditch pitches, Harry led him up the stairs of the Slytherin stand as he followed him in silence, they finally reached the top sitting in the spectators' seats beside one another. They looked up at the night sky the stars sparkled like diamonds and his vision fixed on the moon, the revealing moon that had given him so much to think about the past two days. His gaze eventually turned to the blonde-haired boy sitting beside him, he had a look of terror in his eyes, a look he had never seen on his face before. Not that he had seen him much before.
‘Don’t let me interrupt please... finish’ he grabbed the boy's hand and led him to the bowtruckle once again kneeling down with him, ‘eat for me Draco, I wanna watch you do it’ he whispered in the boy’s ear, like nothing he went down to the neck draining the blood as he ran his hands through the boy's hair, the sight of him feeding was intoxicating as he pushed his head slightly into the beast.
‘You were out late; I never see you in school, you disappear for long periods of time, and your extensive knowledge of magical creatures-’
‘Now can anyone tell me what the most common signs of a werewolf are... don’t all rush at once now’ of course Hermione had her hand up but to Harry’s surprise it was not her name he called upon instead he uttered the name, ‘Mr. Malfoy’
‘How does he keep doing that? How does someone just disappear without a trace without anyone noticing?’ this was the fourth time Harry had asked those questions to the annoyance of Hermione and Ron, ‘and why does he know so much about werewolves? Half of that stuff wasn’t even in our textbooks so how does he know any of it?’
‘I know what you are you know, I figured it out not that you did the best job at hiding it that is’ he smirked slightly trying his best not to show any sense of fear, he didn’t want to give him anything over him, ‘we should talk Draco, that’s all I've wanted to do since last night when your stupid head crashed into me and knocked yourself out... talk’ he walked closer to the quidditch pitch, the blonde-haired boy following behind him.
‘Well yes, I suppose, not everyone who is bitten it transformed I think it’s a mind over matter thing, if you decide to turn them, they will if its only for drinking then yes I suppose you could do that.... pleasure and food sounds like fun’ he smirked looking at the boy.
‘Harry I must interrupt, your obsession with Draco Malfoy is becoming rather worrying at this stage’ Hermione said stopping, the other two doing the same as they turned to face her, ‘now after everything you’ve said please tell me my understanding is incorrect, please tell me you are not seriously considering that Draco Malfoy might be a werewolf and on top of that please tell me you are not accusing him of those attacks that occurred in Hogsmeade because if you are you’re madder than I ever thought you were in our six years of knowing each other’ they had been through quite a lot in their six years together, fighting the dark lord several times along with several death eaters, facing and conquering death several times, if this was what made her think he was mad after every crazy thing he had done, perhaps he was taking it too far. No. He was certain something was strange with that boy.
‘No you’re not dreaming, yes I am a vampire and I suppose they do but I tend not to use them, I mainly eat raw meats or and here’s a fun fact, coconut water can be used as a blood plasma substitute in emergencies and so I can drink that if I need to, I tend not to drink real blood and I've never drunk muggle or wizard blood, that I’m aware of anyways’
The boy appeared beside him making him jump, his presence brought a warmth to the cool air that was around him, his touch on his leg was cold like death but his energy was warm, he couldn't quite explain it but it was just the energy of Draco Malfoy, one he had become rather used to and didn’t like leaving him, if he could play this correctly there would be no reason for that feeling would ever have to leave him again.
‘I am sorry to burst your bubble Potter but I am not a werewolf, and here I thought you were onto something’ he said shaking his head with a smile, ‘is that seriously what you wanted to ask me?’
‘So you saw me in the corridors and turned away planning to go back to your dormitory but you heard my footsteps growing closer and then turning away and your curiosity got the better of you and you followed me, to the mirror of Erised and watched me as I looked in the mirror and as you went to leave I caught your shadow and so you left the castle hoping I wasn’t following you, when you realized I was you hid behind something and when i continued to walk you followed me now caught up in this game like thing we were doing what you didn’t account for was me hiding behind the whomping willow and so you crashed into me and knocked yourself out, now I might be filling in some blanks here so pay attention, so when I saw you knocked out I realized I did not know the exact location of your dorm and knew i wouldn’t get in anyway so I took you to my dorm and tucked you in, after I fell asleep you woke up at some stage and realized where you were and panicked before rushing quietly out and going back to the Slytherin dorm, that sound about right?’
They left the great hall in unison and ignored the stares and whispers that had come with their leaving, they walked through the halls in a V-shaped formation as those around them moved out of their way the only ones bothering to say anything were the Hogwarts ghosts likely because they were dead and the trio could do nothing to them, although there were some ghosts that still kept their distance. They walked through the big wooden doors into the defense against the dark arts classroom all of them sitting at their desks, they appeared to be the last ones to arrive although their professor did not seem to be present in the class, they had cut it very close. Moments later the door opened dramatically and the blinds closed in unison as professor snape walked closer to them stopping in front of the class. The sound of the door opening again caused them all to turn, including Snape, to see the blonde-haired boy Harry had been discussing at the breakfast table.
‘Would you ever do it? If someone let you that is...’ he was drawing closer to the boy, breaking the gap between then, ‘would you do it with me?’ he was walking on thin ice; this was a dangerous game but right now he didn’t care.
The moon, despite not being full, was as bright as it had been the night before when he had Draco Malfoy crashing into him and knocking himself out, the absolute git. The moon looked more intruding that night, perhaps because of the theory he now had about the young Malfoy boy. It had revealed something he had never wished it to, although he supposed that was the curse of the truth, it wouldn’t always be pretty in fact it often wasn’t, revealing dark truths often came with a deep sacrifice on both sides and you wouldn’t always like what you heard. Yet still he spun in the light of the moon that shone through his dorm window. Tonight he lifted his maroon sweater once more but decided it best to throw a pair of trousers over his bare legs, though he still left his feet uncovered, he had enjoyed the cool touch under his feet last night and he wished to feel it again, the cold feeling of the floor was already exciting him to the journey he would make tonight, this time he planned on going directly out onto the castle grounds, no more following shadows or chasing theories of lycanthropy in his fellow students.
‘Harry wait, what are you doing here... I thought we were meeting later’ he asked quickly, the blood still dripping down his chin.
His looking into the mirror was interrupted by his notice of a shadow in the mirror's reflection, he was surprised he could even notice it, despite not obeying the laws of physics it could still catch the shadow of a someone outside of his gaze. He turned away from the mirror, his parents disappearing from his line of sight as he saw the end of a shadow turning into the corridor past him. He decided after a moment of deliberation that it would be worth his time and effort to follow the unknown figure. He lifted himself up leaving the mirror behind him as he had so many things that night, he had left so much behind him often not by choice but tonight he was choosing, and it was his choice to leave his dorm, to leave his dormmates behind, to leave this mirror behind him and now it was his choice to follow after this stranger.
‘What?’ he almost fainted with shock at the boy's comment.
He walked down the corridor as the shadow grew shorter and almost disappeared from his sight, his eyes were heavy from tiredness yet he did not feel sleepy, the bags under his eyes were so dark and deep that they could have held all of the tragedies he had faced in his lifetime and possibly more. Had he imagined that shadow? Was he hallucinating from a lack of sleep? He no longer cared and he dragged his feet across the cool touch of the stone following the path of the long corridor as it led to steps that would lead him to the outdoor grounds of the Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. He stepped through the ajar wooden door and walked down the steps to the grass. The grass was cool beneath his feet, it tickled him slightly with every movement the tickling sensation increased.
‘Actually, I think it’s my turn to ask a question right does that sound fair?’ Harry nodded shocked at his forwardness, ‘so what I'm wondering is why couldn’t sleep is that a common thing or was that just a last night thing... this night too I suppose but I feel you were only out tonight to find me’
‘Okay so-’
He turned from the glass window bending down slightly to pick up a large maroon sweater from the aged wooden floor that bore the Gryffindor crest on its chest, placing it delicately over his head and onto his bare torso providing him with a slight warmth that he guessed was similar to what a hug might feel like, warm and comforting. He looked over at his dorm mates who all lay peacefully letting out soft breaths that made visible clouds in the air due to the temperature, they were all so calm and absent minded, he wondered what that felt like. How he longed to not have a care in the world, to sleep calmly without nightmares intruding upon your peaceful slumber, it was something he had never experienced and feared he might never experience a well slept night so long as he lived.
The next morning, he could feel the weight of yesterday's problems on his shoulders, he moved through the motions almost like he wasn't entirely there, like he wasn’t fully present and while he often wasn’t sure if this was because of his lack of sleep or not this time he was sure. It was because of what had happened with Draco at the quidditch stadium the previous night. People kept speaking to him; telling him stories, information for classes, ranging from the unimportant to the critical but no matter the importance he did not fully listen, it went in one ear and out the other as the phrase went. He hadn’t seen Draco all of that day despite having quite a few classes with him, he did not spit out knowledgeable facts on werewolves in their defense against the dark arts class that morning – he didn’t even show up. He wasn't at breakfast, but the two that were, were the last people that he planned on seeing... Hermione and Ron. They hadn't hidden, or ran, or did it out of defiance, they had even saved him a spot to sit in despite how horribly he had treated them regarding the whole Draco thing, they had only been trying to help him and all things considered, he realized had they done the same he might have and probably would have reacted in the same way as they had probably worse, he had been a pretty shit friends lately and they really didn’t deserve it, especially considering everything they had done to help him with Voldemort and the death eaters, they had almost died multiple times for him.
“Has she ever spent the night before?” Jude asked slowly, the way one approached wounded and dangerous animals.
Carefully, Harry slipped out from underneath her and padded silently over to his dresser, to the sock drawer, to look at that small box. Love, loyalty, and friendship. Harry felt all of those things for Ginny, but when he tried to imagine getting that ring out, and presenting it to her, he just--he just couldn’t. His mind went blank.
“Yeah,” Val nodded gruffly.
“Yes,” Draco carried on. “She is the brains of that outfit after all.”
“You were,” Harry said quietly, finding words that had been buried so deeply for such a long time.. “I--that’s my home. Sirius
Draco wasn’t looking at Harry, but over his shoulder. “It’s all a lie,” he said, but let Harry help him off the floor and into the kitchen.
“I just have to get Jude. Did you see him?”
“Oh,” Ginny waved her hands dismissively, but laughed as she said, “I’m just happy to fly, whether that’s in practice drills or a match, makes no difference to me. It’s about being part of a team, working together to make something great happen.”
“I’ll deal with Ajax.” She licked her lips again, and then bit the bottom one, a sure sign of nervousness. “There’s others too, none of us want--we just want--” she broke off, still unable to meet Draco’s gaze.
“Ah,” if possible, Officer Hughes' smile got even bigger. “Anything to help a compatriot. What do you need?”
Sarah nodded but in the absent way that Draco had noticed meant she was thinking too hard about something. She was like Harry that way, you couldn’t coax words from her, you had to be patient and wait.
She hugged him back, and Harry spent a moment just breathing in the sweet scent of strawberry from her hair. “I brought take-away.”
Harry caught sight of him outside the men’s in King’s Cross and picked up the trail. Jude made his way with the commuter crowd down the pavement, and Harry kept pace. They walked for maybe fifteen minutes, before Jude stepped into an alley next to a corner pub. Harry watched as he walked through an unmarked door, and then debated if he ought to go through the same door.
And Draco didn’t back down from the challenge. This was the street, and Potter was not his Alpha! “I did no such thing, you half-wit! He just showed up at my flat! Snuck into the fucking building!”
Jude looked at Malfoy who just shrugged. “It’s fine. I can’t find what I’m looking for here anyway. Shall we?” He nodded towards the stack in Jude’s arms.
“Well, isn’t this day just as stellar as I imagined it would be.” He said dryly, reaching into the sleeve of his left arm. “Blaise, I wish I could say it was a pleasure seeing you again.” He removed his wand from it’s holster, fingers running along the faint remains of the Dark Mark. And then, without a word, he pushed his wand into Thomas’s chest and left. He had absolutely no intention of handing his wand to Blaise simply because he was the one to ask for it. Petty perhaps, but then the muscle under his eye was twitching.
"Hermione, we're probably going to need more Firewhiskey." Draco said after a long pause. She pulled another bottle from her purse.
He tried to walk by without uh, interrupting them, but they were sitting right by the stairs which Harry needed to walk up in order to get where he was going.  And, Harry being who he is, sort of stumbled as he was heading that way.
"Yeah, 'fraid so." Ron said sadly. They sat in comfortable silence until Dean and Seamus walked down and plumped themselves right next to Ron, across from Draco.
Draco was trying with all his might to not let the tears that were forming in his eyes fall. He failed and one slipped down his cheek. Quickly he wiped it and looked at Hermione once more.
(See the end of the chapter for
While walking back to their common room Draco pulled Harry back. Blaise and Ron looked back, smirks on their faces.
"Of course that's what I want..." There was a long pause. How was he supposed to talk about how much he liked Harry when he couldn't even find the words to say it? "I just... I don't want just a shag buddy... I... I don't know."
"Get what?"
"I guess it's you and me then, let's go." Harry said with a huge smile. He then grab Draco's hand and made a move towards the door.
Ok. He knows he that,
"Bullshit. What happened with Potter?" Blaise asked.
"How the hell do you know what he's thinking? Oh, I got it... you don't! You have no fucking clue how he feels because you never asked. You just assumed his feelings for you. Maybe he was just trying to keep it together. It's embarrassing to get dumped, Harry. Maybe he was trying to save face."
"Well, be on your way then." Blaise replied as he pulled Draco in again.
Draco watched as Harry left the Great Hall. For some reason Draco's brain stopped working and he got up without even realizing it and followed him.
"C'mon Draco, there's gotta be something you haven't done. Jeez..." Pansy said, laughing. Draco blushed and sent a death glare her way. A few people joined in on the laughter which just made him blush more.
And he did.
"You're kidding me!!!" She exclaimed.
He really was screwed, wasn't he?
"Wh-why... why would you just assume it had something to do with Harry?" Draco asked, feeling small. Was he that obvious?
"Draco, why don't you go?" Blaise said suddenly. Draco glared at Blaise while everyone's heads turned to look at him.
"Because neither of them have told each other how they feel! I've had to wipe Harry's tears and hold him too. He's in love with Draco, Ok? He thinks Draco doesn't feel the same way because... I don't know maybe he needs new glasses or he's deaf or maybe he's just an idiot! But, I've never seen him happier than when he's with Draco, or talking about Draco, or
"Draco, calm down! I just came to check on you because you seemed pretty pissed off."
Harry smiled and then dropped his gaze back to his eggs.
"Know what?" Blaise asked skeptically.
"You just are in love with him and refuse to tell him.” Pansy finished for him.
"I mean, no shit you like Potter! Am I your best friend? Are you an idiot? Both answers are yes, by the way."
Draco looked at Blaise, then at Ron and Harry. He, of course, wanted to be with Harry...but he didn't want to say anything in case Harry didn't want to be with him. He gave Blaise a look like
"Weird... I was with Pansy chatting last night and she went up to bed after  you left the common room and I don't believe I heard you come into our room last night..." Draco was loving this. Blaise was glaring daggers at him and Draco was about to open his mouth to say something but a certain green-eyed, black-haired, beautiful wizard caught his eye.
Harry ran off and Draco pulled back from Blaise.
"What's that supposed to mean?" Harry asked, his breath getting shakey. Draco put his hand on Harry's thigh.
"He's not my worst enemy. Not anymore. If he makes Harry happy, that's all that matters."
"What's your fucking problem Greg?" Draco asked.
"Well, I am very picky about who I am
"Malfoy." Weasley sneered.
"Yeah?"
"I'm sure he's just worried for her. He's a lot more understanding then what you give him credit for. He also was just telling me that he kind of likes Blaise now, he learned a bit about him in Detention. By all rights he could have freaked out about Draco- and for good reason. But, he understands that he's changed. And, he trusts you. If you believe Draco has changed so does he.  He loves you, you ignoramus."
Ron grabbed the bottle from Draco's hand and took a sip. "Something that bothers me is when people," he looked directly at Draco, "don't take responsibility for their actions. Everyone has a choice."
"Sucked your cock?" She asked. He gave her the finger, but continued on.
"Hermione... please. Fuck! I knew you knew... at the party... you...you gave me a look and I knew... but, Harry does...he..."
And Harry pulled the covers over and heard Hermione and Ron whispering on the bed next to him. He couldn't find it in him to care enough to try and listen as he tried to get rid of the memory of Draco's lips on his own.
"How? How do you know that?"
But, with Draco as his partner he's not minding it so much. He makes it easy to understand and it helps that they can hold hands or play footsie during lessons.
"Blaise... I-"
"Ginny I can explain, seriously all these rumors going around they're nothing and-"
"You'll have to forgive Draco, he was too busy making goo-goo eyes at Potter again to listen." Pansy laughed.
"I thought maybe you'd need this. You can thank Hermione." Draco smiled, graciously accepted the potion, and then downed it.
"Fine... thank you." Draco grumbled.
Harry returned to his dorm and his roommates were already sound asleep.
"Uh, are you dense? There are not just two types of sexuality's, idiot! One of our best friends is bisexual... Potter could be too." Draco pondered this for a moment.
"No need." She said. When lunch was over she smiled at him and got up silently and walked away, just like she had done every day before- every meal before.
"Of course, dear! Let me get you some potion and just take a pick of beds." She ran off to her cabinets and ruffled through some while Harry sat down at his usual bed.
"What!? Blaise Zabini? How? When? How long? What?" Hermione was floored. Of all the possibilities of what Ginny was about to tell her this didn't even make the list.
"I think you'd be surprised. You're so set on him not liking you... and I'm just not sure why." Ron said.
"Merlin, Zabini...who is it that's got you worn out?" Seamus asked, joking.
Ginny laughed, "Oh, come on. You think I don't know you, Harry Potter?"
"Harry, where are-"
"Spill."
"Hermione." Harry warned. "I love you, but- stay out of it, please." He gritted.
It's all stupid Harry Potter's fault, Draco thought. Him and his gorgeous body... face...hair... Goddamn him!
Harry blushed, in all honesty? He was staring at Draco. He didn't know why but he felt drawn to him for some reason. Since last night he was curious about the blonde haired boy and why he seemed so different this year. Harry had to admit that Draco was really attractive... he was the type of handsome that wasn't thrown in your face but everyone was well aware of. Harry realized it has been a long few seconds since Ginny asked him.
"Look down the table. Do you see Draco anywhere?" She asked him. He looked down the table both ways.
"Yeah... I do." She kissed him on the cheek and went in to find her brother.
"I do... believe me I do... It's quite honestly one of the worst things to like someone who likes someone else... but you get that."
Draco looked up to see Hermione with a worried look on her face.
But knowing that you were still out there, after that day when you lot were captured," he gestured to Ron and Hermione as well, "and I knew for a fact that you were alive... you gave me hope without even trying."
"You know, 'Mione?" Harry asked. Draco was taken back a bit. Harry had remained awfully silent for a while.
"Did he tell you that?" Pansy asked.
"I... think we have everything. I'm confused." As Harry was saying that Hermione walked down the stairs and greeted them cheerfully.
"I-uh-sorry... Uh... I wanted to apologize... for-to you." He mentally slapped himself because god dammit Malfoy's don't stutter, fuck Potter and his ability to make him turn to putty.
"You look like shit." Blaise said when Draco was finally ready. Draco glared at him.
"Well!? Are you just being a freak and watching me sleep? One of your weird fantasies, Potter?"
"Er...what-what about last night? We were all drunk..." Harry started.
"I mean, they will know that we hadn't made out when we exit... since we won't have make out hair or make out face."
"Bye, Harry. Feel better." Harry eyed him until he fully walked out.
"I hope so. I can't stand seeing Harry like this."
"What's up?" Draco asked as they walked towards the bench by the stairs.
"What were you doing wandering around the halls after hours?"
"We already share a ruddy dorm with the lot why do we need to 'bond' with them?" Goyle asked, irritated.
. I like it." He leaned in and said directly into Harry's ear. The motion gave Harry goosebumps all over, remembering exactly why he'd been so
"Morning friends! Hey, Malfoy! Seems like people have died down talking about you and Harry's secret love affair!" Seamus joked.
"So Harry," Hermione started when they got situated, "How was your night?" He smiled.
Alright fine, maybe... maybe Draco had a small, teeny tiny crush on ... Potter. But, it's not his fault! Harry is really obscenely good looking! I mean... it's not like he's the only one, people practically fall over themselves about Harry. He didn't want a relationship or anything, Gods no! He just liked looking at him. He was dating the Weasley girl anyway so even if he did, which he didn't, it wouldn't matter.
Draco
"Shut up, Pansy." He turned away from her with his arms crossed over his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
Class started and Draco was disappointed because Harry wasn't there yet. About 15 minutes later Harry barreled in and the first thing Draco noticed was that his shirt buttons were messed up. The second thing he noticed, that pissed him off the most, was that there were multiple hickeys all over his neck. He sneered and took his attention away from the disheveled boy.
Harry looked up at Blaise "What's that?"
"You don't even understand my love for you. I'm so in love with you. I'm everything? No. Hermione Granger you're everything. You're my everything and I don't know how I got so lucky." He kissed her and she melted into him.
Draco watched Blaise just standing outside the portrait door for about 5 minutes until he heard it open. And, you can't blame him for being completely and totally stunned  to see him grabbing Ginny Weasley's hand and walking her in the other direction.
Before he could even come up with anything to say to Ron he came face to face with him as he ran into the common room- literally face to face with him. Harry ran through the entrance and collided with his best friend. They both fell to the floor. They stayed like that for a minute before Harry propped himself up and reached his hand out for Ron to take.
could never have that with
"Well, you weren't at breakfast this morning and neither was Draco and after the whole...," Ron lowered his voice, "you know... kiss thing last night... I guess a bunch of people started talking about you and him and well..."
"You think I'm worried about Sluggy? You've met my girlfriend, right? She's gonna kill us." Harry took a bite of toast, handed it to Ron, and took the quickest shower of his life. He rushed into his robes and out the door, shoving the bacon and toast into his mouth.
A few minutes later Draco had calmed down,but he was still resting his head against Blaise's chest. "I'm so sorry if this is how I made you feel Blaise." Draco said.
"I didn't remember last night... but Dra- Malfoy showed me his memories..." They stared awkwardly at each other.
"Potter!"
"Er... yeah."
"Of course she knew. She had to punish us, but she knew Goyle was being a right git. The 3 weeks part was for any passer byers so they would know she meant business." Ron said.
"I... shut up. I am not..."
"Ginny! You can't do that. Tell me what's wrong. Are you all right?"
"Uh.... what-what do you mean?"
"Oh?"
She looked relived. "Thank gods, is it my turn then? Hmm... Pansy, What Are The Odds that you'll kiss Draco... for 10 seconds?" Draco looked up in horror.
He eventually had made his way up to the common room and found the absolute last person on the face of the earth that he wanted to see right now.
"I would say the same to you, but it looks like you've marked Draco more than he did you." Harry replied shortly. Draco was seated in front of him next to Goyle.
"He told me '
i really liked writing this chapter, let me know what your thoughts were! (:
"Oh... poor Blaise..."
Wrong. Everyone smiled in agreement and Ron said "That sounds fun, why don't you start, Zabini?"
"Because you're the 'Golden Boy', Potter." And Draco winked at him.
"I have many more, but I can show you another time."
"I was just making sure you weren't uh- up to no good or something."
"That's it. Get up." Ron landed on top of Harry and ripped the pillow out from under his head.
"I think I may have an idea... and I think you'll be pleased to hear that he's interested as well... in you..." Draco replied.
"He's not 'Mione... he's... he's not." Harry said sadly. He knows Hermione just wants to see him happy, but it hurts thinking about how Draco will never love him... not the way Harry loves him. Hermione just looked at him and sighed.
It was frankly not something you need to see when you're just trying to eat your eggs.
Harry hadn't seen her yet this morning, which was weird considering she was usually the one wondering where Harry was. He decided to leave his friends' mushy gushy love fest and find his missing girlfriend.
"Oh... is that so? And who is this man that is lucky enough to have caught The Saviour's eye?" Draco wondered if Harry could hear his heart beat, because he was sure it was about to pound out of his chest. Harry took a step forward so that his nose was almost touching Draco's.
"Shut up about his girlfriend!" Blaise shouted. "Just because someone is in a relationship doesn't mean that they don't fancy other people. When Potter and I were in the other room, we didn't make out by the way, he hypothetically asked me if he was a bad person because he or in his words, his friend, fancies someone even though his friend is in a long relationship."
"Let's go, loves! The family is waiting at home!" Home...
"I knew no one was in here, idiot. And no shit."
"It's difficult to explain... there were parts that were cheerful and parts that were not. You know? I never had any idea of what other people's lives were like until I woke up and realized... parents are supposed to support your own beliefs and dreams... and- and wants? It was a shock to me...I was always told that it was my father's way or no way at all..."
"Thank you, Luna. It's beautiful... How did you learn that spell? I don't think we were taught it in Charms class." Draco joked.
"Well, the thing is. I can't remember most of last night. Apparently I took a lot of shots and I was ridiculously drunk and-" Harry was cut off by Draco.
"Morning, Draco. Sorry if we woke you?" Draco shook his head no, "Ron said you looked so peaceful, so we didn't want to bother you." She added.
Harry
He decided to sum it up to his utter shock and leave it at that.
"Ron and Ginny are talking? What about?" She asked, a certain amount of concern in her voice.
"Well that was terribly mortifying." Draco said as he and Harry walked back to the common room.
The beautiful thing with their friendship was just that. They understood each other without having to say a word. Ron and Hermione may be endgame... but Ron is his soulmate and no one can tell him differently. Not in a romantic way. In a 'This man has been like a brother to me since the moment we met and I love him' kind of way. They had an unspoken agreement that nothing was too big for them to handle.
"Yeah. I don't know this friend but he sounds like he might be some sort of big hero... maybe savior of the world? Hundreds of books written about him? Hmm... I don't know I just got that vibe," He chuckled and Harry laughed, "don't worry about it, Harry. Do what you have to do... or you know tell your friend to."
"Where-uh-where's Har-uh Potter at?" Draco asked as they sat down. Hermione gave him a knowing smirk and then Ron answered, "He said he didn't sleep well last night and wanted a little bit longer. Asked me to bring him up some toast."
“I guess we’d better head over to the Port Authority and see who’s arrived then.” Luis and Roxi stood up, their stools disappearing with another flick of Luis’s wand.
“I am dying to know how you and Tilly met.” She took her own seat next to Ron.
“So, you saw the kitchen, and the living room.” Harry walked them forward a little so they could see the whole of the outside of the house. “Up there are all the bedrooms.” He gestured upwards. “The outside is pretty nice. Bill and Fleur had their wedding here.” They began to walk around the yard, avoiding the happy squeals to the best of their abilities.
And then there was Potter, talking about his hair and his earrings, putting words to all the unease Draco felt. Of course Harry looked fit in his well tailored formal robes and his obvious drunkenness. And the conversation was easy and not unpleasant despite the topic, and for a brief moment Draco wished he could stay there instead of returning to Astoria like the dutiful suitor he was.
But Draco was feeling like he should have known, should have known Harry would show up with his two best friends, that this secret between them couldn’t only be a secret on Harry’s side, that it was all bound to get out. He cut Harry off with a hasty, “I need to breathe, I just need to breathe.”
After breakfast, Draco went back to his apartment. He put away the clorox wipes, folded a basket of laundry, ran the dishwasher, and went to bed. Jenkins gave him a look when he arrived for the night shift that evening, but didn’t say anything, and Draco slouched in the back with his hands in his pockets while she read out the assignments.
“Alright, this?”
It was a doomed hope he realized when her gaze immediately landed on the half empty plate. She looked over at him. “That’s certainly a pile of work.”
“I had to take some things down to Records.”
There was another chorus of approval, but Ajax stared at Harry. “We can’t just leave him out. He’s Draco’s Pack.”
“Ah, but because the young Edward was raised in the knowledge of what his mother did, of why she cursed his uncle to such a life, he grew up to be a great ruler. He had compassion for his enemies and love for his people and the city prospered under his rule.”
“I mean,” Draco took a breath and gathered himself together a little. “It was always very clear to me that I had to get married and produce an heir. There was this, I guess this plan that my parents had for what my life would be like, and it looked pretty much exactly like what their lives had been like. And it wasn’t until sixth and seventh year that I started to question that plan.” He opened up the drawer and started to count the money.
Harry was fairly certain that whoever invented weekends did it just to cause him stupid amounts of misery. Especially now that Jude had returned to Hogwarts. Sure, Jude didn’t talk much, but Harry could hear his presence, from the pipes creaking when he took his shower to the occasional shouted curse when he stubbed his toe on something.
“There’s a file on the table, Marie Culpepper. Can you look through it for me? I’m looking for someone with a tattoo on their arm.”
I was very drunk. Excuse the obnoxious texting. DM
“He can’t like going into the department for that either. I’ve heard how some of the other Aurors talk about him.”
“Have you met?” Tilly asked, her voice heated, Draco recognized distantly.
Meanwhile, Faye closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. One of the wolves behind her was growling low in its throat, but the sound was not really threatening. “Minister,” Faye said before opening her eyes. “You do have a lovely smell.”
“All clear.” Harry called back and then climbed back to standing.
Harry stared up at the windows and tried to decide where else Draco might go. His office was still a possibility, but he’d never stayed the weekend there before. He couldn’t have gone to his old flat; Harry had bribed the landlord into letting Draco’s lease lapse without telling him and then paid another couple’s deposit to move in. He wouldn’t go back to the Manor for anything longer than lunch with his mother.
“Good speech, Potter.” He held out his hand.
“So, last night was pretty crazy,” Ron said, steering Harry back out the door and into Muggle London.
Harry smiled. “Yeah, I think so too.”
“Sorry I missed it.”
He sat down instead and pulled Hermione in close to wrap an arm around her waist. “You are leaving on Sunday for Hogwarts. This night is about celebrating and happy things. Most definitely
The Atrium was always crowded at this time of day, people trying to leave early, others coming in to pay fines or drop off paperwork. There were those headed for probation appointments (more and more of those since the end of the war) and those applying for apparition licenses. Harried parents dragging small children with errant creatures on leashes for registration and veterinary appointments on level four. There were even people carrying broomsticks headed to or from the department of Magical Games and Sports to request a pitch reservation.
They walked in silence the rest of the way, but what Draco had assumed would have been a painfully awkward moment simply wasn’t. It was as if just the mention of tea was enough to thaw, just a little, the icy chasm between them.
Draco jerked back as if hit by the forcefulness of her tone. He was, of course, being childish and at twenty-eight there were many behaviors he should have put aside. But he still felt churlish and no longer interested in eating. “Of course, Mother. I do believe the international travel has tired me more than I expected. Please excuse me.” He stood up from the table and walked determinedly out of the room.
“What the fuck is going on?!” Tilly screamed
“So you’ve just been laying there?”
Harry turned his hand over and looked at the silver line. “I wasn’t very good to Trevor.”
“Okay. I guess I’ll see you around 4. I need to finish the payroll.”
“Shit.” Draco said as he opened the door slightly and then quickly let it shut. He looked at the girl. “They're standing by the door.”
“How can he not know that? He’s Harry Potter.”
Harry pulled back just slightly, and Draco clutched hard at the front of his shirt. “We need to get you to St. Mungo’s. Are you hurt?”
“Of course she is!” Harry tried to sound reassuring even though he had absolutely no idea. “She’s mad for you, she’d say yes if you tied a string around her finger.” That was probably true, especially if it was a leftover from one of Mrs. Weasley’s organic yarns she bought directly from a local farmer.
Maybe it was hours, maybe it was minutes.
And Harry just knew it was going to be a losing argument. He could see what it would be like in the club, hot and sweaty, and Ginny pressed up against him. Loud, and lots of people having a good time, and Harry, also drunk, was just going to spend the whole night thinking about Draco Malfoy and whether he went to clubs with his friends, and if he danced with other people, pressed himself against them, let them put their hands wherever they wanted, suck hot marks across his neck.
“Yep,” Harry said, because it was literally the only idea he had. He stuck his hand in his pocket for a scrap of paper, ducked back in the empty building and transfigured it into a picture of Malfoy. It wasn’t great, but the likeness was good enough. And then he stepped back onto the street and began asking if anyone had seen him.
He threw his head back and sighed loudly. “But I want to run!”
This time Harry was waiting on the bench outside, untouched glass of wine waiting next to him. Draco ran through the grass. The gate smacked against the wall with the strength Draco shoved it open, and there was Harry, pulling him into his arms. “You great bloody wanker! What were you thinking! You could have actually died!” he cried.
Harry brushed two fingers over the inside of Draco’s wrist. “Come to the club tonight.”
And Harry was deeply grateful. “Oh, it’s that same one we went to before, the Crown and Wand. I think Seamus and Dean are coming out. And maybe Padma and Parvati? I don’t really know but I think he’s rounded up a big group.” Probably because Luna would be there, and things were still a bit awkward between them.
Draco growled for this was his prey and he would feel the Man-Prey’s neck break in his jaw.
“Why?”
“That one’s mine.” Harry confirmed, and Malfoy nodded just once before disappearing into the room for him.
“Yeah, she’s got a few weeks off, and she said she’d be here for Teddy’s birthday,” Harry was saying as they walked into the kitchen.
