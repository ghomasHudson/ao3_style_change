, logically, that he and Potter both worked for the Ministry and that someday they might, perchance, cross paths. He hadn’t really given much more thought than that to what he might do, or say, or not do, or not say. He couldn’t help but wonder if Potter had given him the same consideration, or if he had put him out of his mind the minute he could.
, Draco thought.
Draco turned anti-clockwise in the center of the room and found himself face to face with a mirror, hung up on what he supposed was a closet door. He looked
Now, though… Draco felt something deeply uncomfortable begin to unfurl in his chest. He followed after Potter and Yeltz, leaving the little office with their map and their keys and their Muggle phones. Back out into the atrium, where the afternoon sun was still high up in the sky, visible through the high windows.  Yeltz lead them back through the airport, dodging hurrying and irritated Muggles. When they emerged outside, it was in some kind of concrete structure, filled with evenly spaced, quiet Muggle cars. Yeltz lead them through the rows, towards the very end, where a black car was parked. It was quite big, with four doors and a fifth in the back that looked as if it opened upwards.
Draco couldn’t possibly imagine how or when, but then again, there had been several long years that he and Potter hadn’t even so much as laid eyes on one another. Maybe Potter had picked up some particularly useful Muggle skills during his summers away from Hogwarts, or maybe even after the war. Draco, for his part, had
“There’s been an uptick in curses placed in highly concentrated Muggle areas throughout North America,” Ellingsworth continued. “We were asked by the American Bureau to loan some of our best Curse-breakers. Their own resources are getting stretched thin.”
. What’s the point of Muggle transportation? You’ve got brooms in America, don’t you?”
Though they’d left at nine in the morning, and the flight had been
“No,” Potter agreed, his brows drawn tight over his eyes. His nose scrunched, putting his glasses a little off center. “I didn’t think I had to. I wanted to trust you’d get a fitting punishment for your part in the war.”
have done, if Potter had struck around long enough to find out.
Draco followed suit and shook his head.
Draco sat up a little straighter. He wondered if he was summoned to this meeting by mistake. It wasn’t that he was a poor Curse-breaker. He was
That seemed good enough for Yeltz, because he didn’t address Draco for the rest of the briefing. Back home, Draco had assumed that people disliked him more for the infamy of his name more than anything. Now, though, he was starting to see that he had gotten… a bit out of touch with other people. He didn’t have to speak to the Wizard he shared his office with, so he never did. He had a few conversations with the people he helped out in the field, but barely. All he had to do was go in, do his work, and leave.
the damn thing and be out of here in minutes.
Those were the most words Draco had heard Potter say all at once in years, and they immediately stroke a fire of irritation in his chest.
When, finally almost twenty minutes later, they shuffled off the plane with the rest of the Muggles who had been sitting far back, it was into another little hall connected to the door of the plane. Between the edges, Draco could feel
Draco had
He was just flipping through the field notes to find Roanoke when Potter made a frustrated little noise in the back of his throat. “I don’t understand,” Potter said, finally.
. (It was.)
As they came out of the terminal, a short, squat man with dark hair and a sweaty face was holding a little sign with
. He wasn’t
Last night felt like
“Look.”
. The bottom left rib, in Hurricane. The larynx in Laurel Fork. And…” Draco paused, eyes scanning over the three short paragraphs provided by the Roanoke investigative team. “Ah. Eyeballs, in Roanoke.”
“Which one are you reading?” Potter asked, seeming to only begrudgingly be allowing the topic of Draco’s war crimes to drop.
for your positions.” Her eyes glowered over them all, and one of the Aurors was shifting uncomfortably.
“Field assignments,” Draco said, standing up from his seat and grabbing his Ministry-issued robes from over the back of his chair. They weren’t as nice as ones he would have tailored for himself, but he supposed that kept him humble.
They had to drive one, apparently.
“I’ll learn,” Draco said dully.
“You,” Potter said.
“I was, actually.”
at what he did, but Ellingsworth didn’t seem to want to bother with all the fuss that it would be sending a Malfoy out onto the more extreme cases. Draco had spent the last year and a half toiling through domestics and old, feeble family curses.
Draco’s expression tightened, one lip curling up. “I trust we’re allowed to have our
“Good,” Ellingsworth said, handing the case notes to Potter and dismissing them with a wave of her hand. They both hesitated a fraction of a second, then Potter took the lead back towards the seats, dropping down in the front row. Draco sat in the seat to his left, feeling like he was thrown back in school and being forced into proximity with the one person that hated him more than anything on the planet.
Draco’s fitting punishment had been a slap on the wrist, and confiscation of his wand for eight months. In comparison to some of the other Slytherins caught up in the war their parents had begun, it was practically a vacation. In comparison to his own parents, it had been nothing at all. Father was gone. He hadn’t repented, in the end. To the very last, he had dug in his heels and even when it was over, even when he could have lied, he held his chin proudly (Proud of what, Draco often had to wonder?) and accepted the Kiss with misplaced dignity only the Malfoys were capable of.
Yeltz’s face looked like it was about to balloon up and off his neck. Potter shot Draco a look and shouldered himself in between them both.
Harry grinned at the boy. “Yeah. Well-spotted, Teddy.”
Whatever you two are talking about, though, it doesn’t sound important in the least. Just amused murmurs and delighted laughs. I make the mistake to chance a glance in your direction, catching you with a fond smile on your face, your eyes sparkling, your free hand fiddling with the fringe of the blanket you have thrown over your legs. You’re so smitten, and for a moment I find myself wishing you weren’t here.
Your Majesty,
“Yes, well, weird cravings are kind of common, right? I mean, Hermione was basically going through a jar of pickles per day when…”
“Yes,
Draco drew in a sharp breath. “You’re saying you thought about giving a hundred-year-old a lap dance? In the middle of Diagon Alley? In front of dozens of innocent children?” His attempt to look appalled was completely ruined by the mirth dancing in his eyes. “Oh my, Potter, you
“Good.” Draco nodded, pushing his hands deep down into his trouser pockets. Harry was sorely tempted to call him out on his uncharacteristic behaviour but got distracted. The dark-grey fabric stretched intriguingly over Draco’s hips and his— “Well then…”
He prayed Harry didn’t notice the slight tremble in his hand as he brought the glass to his lips. His mouth felt parched, his throat sore, and the sip of wine did nothing to remedy that. Harry’s voice was soft and warm as he spoke, a comforting blanket draping over Draco’s shoulders.
Harry couldn’t help it, though. Ever since that one time last summer, when he had —
At Harry’s reply, Draco closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, stretching the fabric of his slim-fitted t-shirt as his chest expands with the inhalation. The corners of Draco’s mouth twitches, clearly fighting a smile, and Harry watches him mesmerised, unable to quell the excited butterflies swarming in his stomach.
Now, any self-respecting Slytherin would have run in the other direction. Draco reminded himself of this repeatedly over the hours that followed and, had it been any other circumstance, he probably would have, too. As it was, though, this was apparently the moment Draco decided to abandon any self-respect he might have still possessed and ran
Harry snorts. They'll see about that.
“That’s… I—” Malfoy clears his throat and licks his lips, then frowns. “Hmm, try…” Harry shivers as the gentle ripple of wandless magic wafts over him, unfastening the two uppermost buttons of the shirt, allowing him to breathe. “There. Better?”
The Burrow, Devon
She let out a huff. “He’s not going to shit in there, is he?”
When Draco woke up, it was still dark. He’d nodded off on the sofa sometime late in the evening, only waking when Molly covered him with a hand-knitted blanket and insisted he’d sleep right there for the night. He’d been terribly tired after the intensive evening and, although embarrassed, he’d been quite comfortable right where he was and so agreed.
Baking.
Harry nodded, then raised an eyebrow. “Are you slipping out without saying goodbye to everybody?”
Received: Bingo. Wanna dance?
Harry frowns, sweeping his gaze around the bistro he’d chosen for their ‘date’. “Why? I come here all the time, and none of my dates has ever complained about it before. I like that it’s Muggle; that, here, I can be just Harry. I know the staff; I like the food. It’s a perfectly good place for a date.”
“Er…” The always so eloquent Draco fumbled for words and Harry listened, intrigued, as the man attempted a discreet cough to hide his flustered state. “No, I’m afraid not.”
Draco blanched.
“We’re going out,” Potter said by way of greeting as he burst into the room like the chaotic whirlwind that Draco had the misfortune to share quarters with.
— cup the bulge in his trousers. “I have a question for you, Harry.”
Molly smiled and shook her head fondly. “We know that, dear. That’s why we’re here.”
Amusement still fizzling through his body, Draco grinned and looked down into Harry’s deep green eyes, their joint laughter combining and forming a little cloud that hovered between them. Harry blinked up at him, and Draco realised he could discern every individual eyelash fluttering, despite the surrounding darkness. Circe, they were close. So close the tips of their noses were nearly touching. So close he could feel Harry’s hot breath against his skin, on his lips. So close.
“It is.”
you." Gods, the mere idea makes Harry's cock begin to harden. "Please," he adds with what can only be described as a needy whine.
The smell out there, with owl droppings, pellets, and feathers littering the floor, was usually enough to deter anyone from staying longer than necessary. But Malfoy didn’t seem to notice. He just stood there by the open window, lost in thought, looking out over the fiery autumn colours of the Forbidden Forest. Harry approached with caution, unwilling to interrupt whatever thoughts were running through the boy’s head, but Malfoy turned his gaze towards him, and the look in his eyes was one of longing. Harry remembers himself thinking the boy must really wish he could escape this place and fly far away.
And just like that, he’s gone, whisked away by the magic of Disapparition, leaving Harry and his futilely waiting lips behind in the chilly February night.
“Yes?” Harry’s eyes widened, and he sounded so hopeful and still so unsure.
“Don’t we all?” Malfoy chuckles and takes the vacated seat opposite Harry. Harry glares at him. If anyone excels at the dating game, it’s Malfoy; always entertaining a new fling and seemingly loving every minute of it. “What?” Malfoy shrugs innocently. “Either I suck him or he sucks me, and whichever way, a fun time is had by all.”
With his heart racing in his chest, Harry rushed after him, not slowing down until he was back at Teddy’s side.
Oh, right. The exam.
He lay in the centre of his large bed, the soft mattress cradling his body as he stared at the ceiling, listening to the silence.
“Yes?” Draco called as he sprinkled a healthy dose of bacon on top of the meal.
Malfoy,
“Go,” Draco said, shooing him out the door. “I’m right behind you.”
Your daredevil,
Malfoy motions for the street, prompting Harry to step over the threshold and close the door behind him. A not-at-all-unpleasant shiver travels up his spine as Malfoy places a light hand on the small of his back, guiding him down the front steps.
“Draco is his fiancé,” a sweet voice came from the door. Draco turned his head towards Hannah in alarm. His
“You’re a good boy, aren’t you Harry?”
The silence stretches between them, a charged tension humming in the air, travelling over Harry’s skin, making his every hair stand on end.
“Interesting choice of colour scheme, Potter,” he said amused, glancing over to where Harry was standing near the door. “Here I thought you’d be the one to go for a classic red and gold, but I guess I should have known better. This rainbow explosion you have going on here is really someth—”
“Reasonable? Why the fuck would that seem reasonable? Why? Because I’m a Malfoy? Because there’s no way Charlie Weasley would ever want to marry an ex-Death Eater like me unless I was knocked up?”
Left with little option, Draco stepped past Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Arthur to have a seat next to Molly. Bill and Fleur stood near the wall on the other side of the bed smiling, Fleur occasionally reaching down to brush Charlie’s hair out of his face.
He really
“I’m going back down there and I’m telling him the truth, Sirius. I have to.”
Speaking of, here’s a secret for you, Draco, something no one else knows, not even Ron and Hermione: The sorting hat wanted to put me in Slytherin at first, but thanks to you and your haughty attitude, I convinced it not to. Yes, the great Harry Potter could have been a Slytherin. Can you imagine? Us, sharing a dorm in that creepy underwater dungeon of yours, sharing the same table for countless meals in the Great Hall, fighting for the same seeker position on our house team? Of course, you wouldn’t have stood a chance against me, but then you’d probably have cheered me on from the stands instead, wouldn’t you? I mean, who knows? If we were housemates, this never-ending feud between us might’ve never existed… Imagine that…
Had it been anyone else, Draco would’ve been obliged to ask for a specification regarding the tea, presenting the various options and guiding them to an informed decision. However, with this woman, he knew not to bother with the company guidelines. He’d made that mistake once, his first week on the job, only to receive a ten minutes’ lecture on how and why Earl Grey was the only blend worthy of the name tea, and how anyone thinking otherwise were ‘deluded dimwits devoid of dignity and decorum’. Draco still cringed thinking about the experience, but once the air had been cleared between them, and Draco had got a chance to commend her for her inspired alliteration, she had turned out to be the sweetest grandma.
. Young Draco, the Draco he grew up with, would have let him fall right into the mess and then busied himself by taking pictures. But this Draco, the Draco he’s been dreaming of for months, brushes off his visible concern with sarcasm.
“No, I—”
“Do it,” Draco growls. “Come for me, babe. I’ve got you.”
“Draco?” Harry’s voice was soft, and when Draco looked up, Harry reached out and took Draco’s hand in his. Warm, strong, calloused. Reassuring. “Don’t worry about tomorrow, okay? You’ll love Hogwarts, I promise. You’ll make lots of friends, and you’ll learn magic, and play Quidditch, and have a brilliant time.”
“Oh.” She looked down at his book, then back up, meeting his eyes with a wrinkled brow. “Er, I thought you were doing your whole Malfoy-thing again. Ron said you’ve been muttering about him in your sleep, and that you’re arguing about it with Orion.”
, Draco thought as he desperately fought the urge to sink into Potter’s touch. “I bet a sledge ride in the fresh air would do you wonders.”
On the national level, I’m sure you’d be happy to know the Arrows are currently in the lead, closely followed by the Falcons and the Wasps. They still have three rounds to go before the season is over, and from the looks of it, almost any team still has a shot at the cup (except for maybe the Cannons, as per usual). You’re an Arrows fan, right? Better bask in the leading position now then, before my Falcons swoop in and steal your thunder from under your nose.
Right. He needed to tell Pansy what had happened, and he needed to check on Charlie.
Merlin, that voice. Draco had got a taste of it the other day when they spoke on the phone, but hearing it now, mumbling close enough for Draco to sense the warm breath ghosting over his skin… Holy fuck, Draco’s knees nearly buckled from the wave of arousal crashing over him.
But Draco didn’t give Harry a chance to finish. Instead, he pulled the man to him again and plunged.
“Yes, well, your baby is eating the packing paper in this crate.”
Deluded Malfoy,
Thank Merlin Teddy had insisted on staying with him in London, or Harry would probably have spent Christmas evening sobbing pathetically into a pillow all by his lonesome.
“How hard can it be to get it into your pretty little head? A is feminine; O is masculine. And as far as I know, I’m still a—”
Draco smiled, squeezing Harry’s hand, and he just knew his eyes sparkled with the delight of being on the arm of a man who knew him so well.
Harry thought back to the war, to their wedding, to their time at Shell Cottage, and had to agree. They were definitely stronger as a couple.
Draco let the door close behind him, the mellow harp music fading into nothingness as he stepped outside the wards. The chilly December air sent a shiver through his tired limbs, and his breath produced a billowing cloud before his eyes as he looked around at the quiet London street and heaved a sigh.
He had walked up to the Owlery, only to find Malfoy there, alone. He hadn’t been in the letter room, the heated space where students could find writing supplies and owl treats, but was standing with the hooting birds out in the roost.
She flipped through the papers and paused, then closed her eyes, remaining very still.
And apart from defence and flying, there’s really not much I’m actually good at. I don’t have the brains Hermione does, nor the potions skills you do. I’m not a strategist like Ron or an entrepreneur like George. I don’t even know a fraction of what Nev knows about plants, and no matter what Luna says, I certainly shouldn’t be trusted taking care of any creatures, not when I can’t even seem to take care of myself. I can’t deny a quidditch career might have crossed my mind at some point, but how would I ever know if I was drafted for my talent and not for the marketing value of my name?
I don’t…” Harry followed Charlie’s gaze to where Malfoy stood glaring at them from under the edge of his purple bobble hat. “We’re not…”
Your voice is so soft, so weak, that I almost miss it at first. And the words make no sense; surely I must’ve heard them wrong. I reach for the remote and mute the melodramatic strings accompanying the credits of the movie we’ve just seen without really watching it, both of us too lost in thought to take any note of its content.
“I’m not,” I assure her, helplessly accepting that my eyes are already back on you, drinking in the sight that makes me dizzier than any beer ever could. “I’m not going to ‘do anything about it’.”
Hermione would probably say he’s becoming obsessed again. She does say it, actually, so often that Harry can’t even bring up Malfoy in passing anymore. His friends don’t want to hear it.
“It’s complicated. But what about you?” Harry shot back. “Would your mother be pleased to know that you’re terrified of your own happiness? To know that you keep coming up with excuses not to go back to a place that was so special to you both?”
“I’ll look,” Hermione said, grinning. “I’ve always wanted to see one of those.”
"I need you, Draco. I need you inside me."
Draco did notice those furtive glances, though. Like the man kept scrutinizing his every move, making Draco more self-aware than he’d been his entire life. Was his collar out of place? Was a lock escaping the messy bun at the nape of his neck again? Had he forgotten to put on trousers this morning? Sometimes, it felt like those bright emerald eyes were looking straight through his defences, uncovering every dark secret Draco might have wanted to keep from the world.
“But…” Harry watches as Malfoy walks over to the ball return to pick up his neon green projectile. “But you’re a great catch? How can he not…? Do I know him?”
“Please…” he begged, arching his back and parting his legs.
“I love you,” he says as Draco eventually moves to leave.
Harry turned back around to find Charlie with his eyebrows raised high under his flaming red fringe.
Shacklebolt chuckled. “Ms Parkinson says otherwise. According to her, this charity was all your idea to begin with. And I’ve recently heard some good things about you from other sources as well; you seem to be making a good name for yourself these days.” He leaned forwards and lowered his voice so only Draco could hear him. “I realise this might sound condescending, son, so please take it in the manner in which it’s meant.” He hesitated, and Draco nodded, nervous to hear him continue. “I’m proud of you. You’ve taken the chance you were given and made something amazing. You’re a most impressive young man.”
Draco froze and steadfastly kept his eyes on her, refusing to even glance Harry’s way. “Uh, well, I mean, I don’t really know Harry’s type or anything.”
“Unless you don’t—?”
“Sure you can. How else are you going to learn enough about him to keep this whole thing up? Where is it?”
Which is why Harry opens his front door to greet Malfoy at two o’clock the following day, ready to take the Erumpent by its horn.
he responded nonsensically and turned away, going back to sleep.
He wants to say more. He wants to tell Draco how much he means to him, how much he lo— likes him. He wants to tell Draco how amazing he is and how utterly perfect his glorious body feels against his skin. But his stupid brain refuses to cooperate, muddled as it is from the flood of arousal coursing through his veins. Instead, he takes Draco’s earlobe in his mouth and sucks hard, flicking it with the tip of his tongue as he sinks his fingers into Draco’s locks again and tilts his head up for another desperate kiss.
Harry takes a sip. "He's cold and ready for us to be done so he can come up here and exploit our body heat."
But it was.
Draco regretted the barb before it even passed his lips. He was better than that these days, he really was, but sometimes his defensive vulnerability still managed to catch him off guard.
“And me.” The conspiratorial glint in his eye made Draco’s insides tingle. “Still, I’ll make sure to remind him tomorrow.”
Draco reached the paddock and slipped through the protection wards that kept the dragons away from the buildings of the Reserve. Blazing heat slammed into his face, scorching his throat and making it all but impossible to breathe. It was an inferno, and Draco suddenly had a flashback of the Room of Hidden Things, of raging Fiendfyre and absolute terror. Heart hammering in his chest, his breathing quickened, desperate for oxygen but too shallow to actually take it in.
With a crack of magic, Dandelion appeared at the edge of the sofa, her big, elf ears bobbing as she rocked back and forth on her feet. The house elf beamed and wrung her hands in the bright yellow smock he’d had fashioned for her. Draco couldn’t help appreciating the anticipation of his needs.
he say, really, in the long run? He wasn’t about to tell Potter that he was a changed man or whatever. Not because it wasn’t true, to some extent, but because he was certain that it wouldn’t matter. Especially since Draco couldn’t even pinpoint what about him had changed, not really.
, and headed through the flat to his bedroom. It was going to be a long night, he supposed, and he didn’t plan on getting much sleep to begin with. He could only hope that he and Potter didn’t kill one another before they got to America.
Ellingsworth was just clearing her throat at the bottom of the amphitheater when Draco scooted in through the doors. She was a tall witch, perhaps in her late forties, with sandy hair that was never out of its severe ponytail. He dropped to sit in the back row. There were a scattering of other Curse-breakers there, in their dark green robes. Moreover, there were an equal number of scarlet-robed Aurors, all straightening their shoulders to attention when Ellingsworth began to speak.
of them knew what they were supposed to be doing from here.
From the looks of it, Potter wasn’t particularly pleased either. He stood and headed down to the front of the amphitheater. Draco hesitated, his heart pounding obnoxiously in his chest until it began to hurt.
“Kind of ya, Mr. Potter,” Yeltz said, dropping the sign on one of the desks. Potter’s name drew the attention of the two wizards working at the desks in the room, their eyes tracking them. “And this your Curse-breaker, here? I don’t believe I caught your name.”
printed across the front. Draco did his best to stamp down any annoyance. He was here, too. In fact, he was imperative to helping out the American Bureau of Magic. Potter was an Auror, he probably couldn’t break some of the most common curses. It wasn’t his forte. Draco, on the other hand. It was his
“Harry?”
“You really think it’ll be enough?”
“Molly, love, you’re scaring the boy.” Arthur stepped up behind his wife and wrapped his arms around her before smiling at Draco. “People rarely bake for her since they know she cooks, but it’s one of her favourite things to receive.”
Two weeks ago, he would have been spending the evening with Pansy at some restaurant, or he’d be hosting some charity event for the homeless. He’d come home to his fox, tidy up the flat, then settle into bed with a good book. It was predictable, as predictable as the sounds of Slyvia’s grooming routines, and there used to be comfort in that.
Draco looked down at the wadded parchment in his hand, the words ‘Malfoy’ and ‘Charles’ peeking out through the folds. “Uh, yes. I messed this one up, though, obviously.”
He expected a laugh, so Harry’s choking cough was a surprise, but ever so much more satisfying. Draco tossed a sly glance over his shoulder and gestured for Harry to follow him back into the living room. He was pretty sure he could feel Harry’s eyes on him the entire way.
“Let me guess,” Draco greeted the girl whose cheeks were still rosy from the crisp autumn air, “two large coffees, one with a splash of milk, the other sickly sweet?”
It takes a while before Harry’s ready to let go. As he does — more thankful for his fiancé than ever before — warm silver-grey eyes await him.
12 Grimmauld Place, London
Sirius rambled about his motorbike as they stepped onto the next lift and ascended to the fifth floor. Draco tried to listen, but his mind was racing with the sudden realisation that this was his opportunity. He could come clean, explain everything to this man who reminded Draco so much of family.
“Well, this is awkward,” Harry said, trying to catch his breath between sporadic giggles. Draco quickly rolled off him, watching Harry sit up and crawl up onto his knees, his jeans hugging every inch of those toned thighs perfectly.
Harry nodded and set his box down, digging in his coat for a key. Drawing it out, he opened the door and returned for the box. “Ready?”
When they finally settled under the covers, Draco nestled Harry against his chest, wrapping an arm around his waist and pulling him close.
“Huh. And you’re with Charlie? He’s not really the neat and orderly type.”
“Turn over,” he growled, “I want to…”
This was probably when Draco should have reminded her of the proper way to address one’s boss here in the UK. (She had moved in with her sister and Bill to learn about British culture and customs, after all.) However, as it was, he could but blink at her, amazed by her audacity as she continued unperturbed.
. “He’s been in school together with Potter for six years, you know; imagine the amount of intel that must be dwelling in that blond head of his, just waiting to be examined and put to better u—”
Harry rolls his eyes towards the ceiling, sighing in defeat at the all but lost cause. The first few months after Draco started calling him that, he tried to fight it, asking him to stop. The more Harry brought it up, though, the more Draco insisted and, after a while, Harry caught on and changed tactics, figuring if he only managed to act unbothered by the moniker, Draco would grow bored of using it. So far, it hasn’t helped matters much, but it’s an ongoing battle. A battle Harry is still hopeful he’ll come out of victorious.
No, scratch that. He didn’t hate it, per se. It was still the same house he grew up in, after all, the place he’d loved so much as a kid, back when it still felt like home.
“Check.”
Harry grinned and looked like a little boy playing a prank.
And Harry knew he shouldn’t have. He’d already decided he didn’t want to know, right? And yet…
“Since I somehow ended up engaged to his surrogate brother. Now stop distracting me. What do you mean, my bowl?”
Draco gave the elderly man an affirmative nod. “Certainly, sir. Would you like some whipped cream on top of the chocolate?”
poor nerves?” he said in a matronly voice, teasing. Fleur’s light laugh joined his chuckle, but Molly shot him a scowl and took the chair Arthur pulled up behind her.
“You’ll have one too,” Draco murmurs, lifting a trembling hand to run his fingers down Harry’s neck. When he hits a spot halfway between neck and shoulder, approximately the same place on his collarbone as where Draco’s tattoo is, Harry nearly chokes in pleasure. It’s like the best orgasm of his life, concentrated down into that one spot.
“For fuck’s sake, Harry, shut up,” Draco said, laughing. “Stop talking so I can say yes.”
"We'll deal with it. Together." Harry runs a hand through Draco's hair, watching his silver-grey eyes flutter closed. "It'll be okay, no matter your test scores. And one night off from revision won't make a difference in what you know, but it might make a difference in how you manage the stress."
Even so, it was enough to convince Harry that perhaps he liked blokes as well as girls, and to realise he wanted more than just a light romance with a friend. He and Ginny had both agreed they wanted more than that after the war, and what Harry wanted was, well…
“Let me take over for a while,” she said, beating him to the cup he’d been aiming for. “Pumpkin spice latte,
.” Draco winks and takes a sip of his sparkling water. “As in, show interest in what your date is telling you, listen, ask questions, make eye contact, don’t glance at your watch, and do throw in a compliment or two when you see fit.”
As they kissed, Harry’s arms wrapped around his back and
It may seem inexplicable, but Dumbledore actually had his reasons to leave me with my aunt and uncle rather than someone else. You see, as long as I stayed in their home, the magical protection my mother’s sacrifice gave me at the time of her death lived on through the blood connection between her and her sister. For it to work, I had to consider their house my home, or Riddle and his followers would be able to find and kill me as soon as I was outside Hogwarts’ protective wards.
expression. So Draco humoured him. Sort of.
“What do you want?” A breathless whisper, a wet tongue flicking his earlobe before it got sucked in between soft lips and stinging teeth.
“Draco is not a coward.”
Pansy tilted her head. “Well, no staff discounts on a charity auction. You’ll have to bid like everybody else.” She reached into the crate and pulled out a note Draco hadn’t noticed before. Its content made Pansy grin like a shark. “And get out your cheque book, baby, ‘cause he’s letting me put his name on it this time.”
“Of course. I’d like her to be—”
— ☕ —
“Relax, Cissy, I’m not going to kill him.”
Harry and Draco were okay with that. It'd only been a year since the war, after all, and only a month since they'd returned from their final year at Hogwarts. Some things were bound to take time.
Sirius chuckled. “Perhaps, or so I’ve been told. Everything I’ve said is true, though. Your presence has brought every single one of us comfort. Everyone’s so pleased that Charlie’s found someone, and the fact that it’s you, well, it’s vastly amusing.”
“Yup.” Harry smiled and reached over to tuck a stray lock behind Draco’s ear. “But I’ll give you a minute or two to catch your breath first, old man, before—”
Soft and slow may have been a nice idea in theory, and maybe — hopefully — they’ll be able to get back to that later. Right now, though, Harry needs more. He
“Scared, Potter?”
Draco didn’t dare move. It couldn’t be Dobby or any of the other elves, or he would’ve heard the crack of Apparition. And his parents never came into his room during the night, except when he was sick enough for them to worry about his health. (Something that hadn’t happened more than a handful of times in his life, as far as Draco could remember.) No, this was someone else.
“I promise. In fact—” Harry let go of Draco’s hand to reach into his trouser pocket, fishing up a… coin? Draco frowned. “Here. Take this,” Harry said, placing the coin in Draco’s palm. “Just something to help you remember our little chat.”
“Wait,” she stopped him, setting down her cup. “They gave you his personal items? What’s in there?”
Because they’re both blue. Of course, they are. One light as the sky on a clear summer day, the other rich like precious sapphires gleaming in the light of numerous chandeliers.
PPS All right, so, can we both just agree we’ve hurt each other in the past, that we’re both sorry for it, and that we’ve both managed to save each other’s lives after that? Call it even?
Charlie chuckled. “Ollie helped me out a bit. We go way back.”
Harry was quiet for a while, then Draco felt the warm weight of a hand on his shoulder. “You miss her. How long has it been now?”
“I just thought…” Draco shrugged, looking everywhere except at Harry. “Since you’re making dinner…”
Molly reached out her arms and pulled him into a hug. “Thank you, dear boy. I’m sure it’s wonderful.”
“Huh?” The woman turned to face him, blinking. “Sorry?”
“What’s wrong with pizza?” Just the scent makes Harry’s mouth water.
After dinner, Draco watched everyone gather around the Christmas tree, piling onto sofas and chairs, large pillows on the floor and conjured stools. It was chaotic, with the baby being passed from person to person nearly as much as the cups of wassail and punch. The eldest children handed out the gifts, and Draco watched everyone’s delight as they unwrapped their presents.
“Why?” Draco could almost feel the gust of that hot, breathy voice caress the skin of his ear.
Draco walked over to the next crate and read its label.
be able to produce such a fluttery effect on any young man’s stomach. Harry ought to know. He was a Healer, after all; the body and its reactions were supposed to be his area of expertise. Yet, the number of pixies stirring in his belly as he watched Draco joke with the girls and make them feel comfortable was almost frightening. He’d known Draco was good with Teddy, he’d witnessed it before, but he had no idea Draco’s love for children stretched any further than his own cousin — or why it should in any way matter to Harry.
“I know!”
At the very least, Harry figured he should give dating another try. He hadn’t been on a date in like… five months? Or was it six already? Harry had no idea. He didn’t particularly like dating, especially when set up with random strangers by his well-meaning friends, but he’d do it, he promised himself. Anything to take his mind off Draco.
Harry glances at her sideways through his fingers. “Why not? It’s true.”
No, silly, our house wasn’t all that tiny. In fact, there were four bedrooms on the second floor, the master, the guestroom, and Dudley’s two rooms. After my aunt and uncle realised Dumbledore knew about our sleeping arrangements (my Hogwarts letter was literally addressed to ‘the cupboard under the stairs’), they were quick to give me my cousin’s 2nd bedroom, much to his chagrin. That’s more or less how it always was, me taking over Dudley’s discarded stuff; toys, books, clothes… even though he was several sizes bigger than I was. The first piece of clothing I owned that was bought just for me and actually fit was my school robes, the ones I was measured for when I first met you.
“I love you, Draco. I want to be your family. I want to see the world with you, to grow old with you. I want to go to Florence with you and let you show me all the happiness you’ve experienced there. I want to make you happy.”
“How about an old cousin?” came a voice from the doorway. “People generally complain they can’t get me to shut up, though, so don’t be surprised if you don’t get a word in edgewise.”
“It’s nothing like that,” Harry professed, even as he felt a flush rise on his cheeks. “I mean, it’s
Ginny had mentioned it the other day; that her brother was coming up from Romania to substitute for Hagrid whilst he was in France visiting Madame Maxime over the holidays. This was the first Harry’d seen of him, though, and before he knew it, he was already running over to meet him, chatting and laughing amicably like they’d done all summer.
I think you need to hear it — that arranged marriage nonsense sounds blooody archaic and narrow-minded to me, like something belonging to the fucking past and nothing that should ever dictate the lifes of anyone
Nearly every conversation — and there were at least three going on at any given time — included Draco in some way. They asked his opinion or told him a story, everyone making sure he knew the backstory behind the family lore or more information about the person being discussed. It was overwhelming, and insane, and…absolutely perfect.
It’s the first evening you’re spending in our flat in days. I’ve looked forward to it, to finally having you home with me again. I’ve missed you so much. Now that you’re here, though, even as you’re sitting right beside me, I realise I still miss you.
“Impatient much?” Draco chuckled.
“True.” Draco grinned; he couldn’t help it.
And Draco moved. Slowly at first; long, deep thrusts that felt like a manifestation of sorts, as if Draco was trying to pound the reality of it all into Harry’s very core with every grind of his hips.
And Harry can do that.
Saturday 16 October 1999
Harry laughed. “Yeah, George and Ron named it that. I actually have a workshop on the other side, and the area just sort of took on a cave-like atmosphere after I set it up.” He shrugged. “Come on.”
Harry moans in pleasure as the warm cloth glides across his arse. It feels so good. "Okay," he says, any argument he might have made Obliviated from his mind by the soft touches.
Harry’s mischievous grin cuts me off short.
“Harry?” Ginny asked, her voice laced with amused accusation. “Please tell me you’re not doing this again.”
bearable to be around?
Until then, stay sane.
Sorry for the mood. (I blame the house.) It isn’t really all bad. The practical blocks are all right, if tiring, even the more mundane weight and cardio sessions down in the gym. It’s a good tiring, though, you know, the one that gives you a good night’s sleep at the end of the day. But even so — and please don’t let this go to your head, you smug twat — the best part of my week was all courtesy of you.
Oh, the hug.
. “Then why haven’t you ever said anything?”
What's more, he knows so many places Harry’s only heard of in passing, if at all, and over the next few weeks, he takes Harry to them, letting him experience everything from paintball and arcade games to horse riding and karaoke. They go to a wine and cheese tasting and they visit the Greenwich Observatory. They go on a boat trip down the Thames and even to a pottery class (because ‘every Potter should know how to potter, right Potter?’).
Sent: Seriously, who is this? Blaise? You're not funny you know.
Draco’s heart rate slowly returned to something resembling normal, and he glared. “Well, you certainly let me know, didn’t you? What are you doing here?”
Sent: Salazar, help me.
I swallow hard and watch as you return to the mass of bodies moving on the dancefloor.
He hadn’t thought much about it in the years since the war, but now the day had finally come, it suddenly felt more significant than ever before, as if everything in his life had somehow been leading up to this particular moment in time.
“Nearly five years. After Father passed in Azkaban, she managed about two more years. A curse she’d taken during the war had weakened her heart, and it finally gave out.”
She threw her head back and laughed. “Oh, Harry. I certainly had a choice, and so did Bill. We, either of us, could have walked away at any time and the tether would have snapped. But we were both attracted to the other, and enjoyed each other, so we came to love one another. He is my mate, but if either of us had chosen otherwise, the bond would have dissipated and started looking for someone else.”
When Harry trailed off and Draco realised he wasn’t about to continue, he put the empty jar in the sink and took the dish from the counter.
Realisation seemed to dawn on Harry then, and Draco watched entranced as a blush rose up his neck and tinged his cheeks an intriguing shade of pink.
“It was a hard time for many of us. I lost someone too, you know. Remus. I think you knew him as Professor Lupin, but he was my Moony. He wasn’t allowed to get married because of the whole werewolf thing, and of course, I was still a fugitive at the time, but we were going to find a way after the war was over. We’d wasted too much time being idiots and not enough time just being
Received: You never guessed what I want for my birthday. You don’t care! Whyyyy don’t you care?
Damn it, Mafloy,
It felt like an eternity, but maybe two weeks without Draco was exactly what Harry needed to return to some state of sanity. So why didn’t it feel like a reprieve? Why did it feel like a punishment?
Harry glanced over and smiled, and his face lit up in a way that made Draco’s heart swell. “I was on a business trip to the states. I visited this old museum where people were in old-fashioned costumes and did all these traditional trades: pottery, blacksmithing, glassblowing. It was all really interesting, but the glassblowing was what really caught my attention. They were offering a seminar the next day, so I cleared my schedule and went.”
Draco’s heart pounded against his ribs as he collapsed on top of Harry, as if wanting to break free only to take up residence in Harry’s heaving chest instead. It was definitely too soon for all that sappy nonsense, Draco knew that much, but even so, he feared it was already too late. He could deny it all he wanted, but the truth was, his heart already belonged to this man. Had done so for longer than he cared to admit.
“Hey, take it easy.” Harry chuckled, apologising to an observant old lady who’d been kind enough to step aside to let Teddy cross her path. “We’re almost there, cutie cub. I’m sure Santa will have time for everyone.”
“Oh.” In the quiet relief from Fleur’s words, one question remained on the tip of Harry’s tongue. “What do you mean by a tether?”
He took a deep breath and stood up, rubbing his hands over his face. He bent over and picked up the canvas bag from the floor.
Clearly, Potter knew Charlie better than the others these days, and there was no doubt the man was about to call him out on the entire charade. Perhaps it was better this way, though. This was his chance to come clean.
Received: Whatever…
Sirius looked up with an innocent raising of his forehead, his eyebrows nearly touching his hairline.
Harry returns to their table, taking a long swig of his beer while checking the scoreboard. “So,” he ventures over the characteristic clack-and-clattering coming from one of the lanes further down to their left, “if you’re such an expert dater, how come you’ve never found anyone you’ve liked enough to want to get serious with?”
“Draco, darling!” Slyvia squealed and stepped back, making a show of raking her eyes all over him. “I’ll be out for the night and just thought I’d stop by on my way down. I must say, you look absolutely delicious; I could eat you right up.”
Why wou—”
“I might have saved you from that dragon, but the real hero here was you. While you were sleeping, you saved my life by allowing me to be a part of your family, if only for a little while, and I haven’t had that in a really long time.”
?” She was trying to sound disinterested, but he knew that tone.
“Right where you left me.” He glances at the clock, wondering where the hell time went. The position of the hands makes him frown; Draco’s back earlier than expected. Not that Harry’s been sitting here waiting for him or anything, just… unexpected, that’s all. “Everything’s okay?”
The two friends seemed to be immersed in deep conversation, comparing notes and crosschecking them against what looked like a detailed diagram of the human body. None of them made any sign of being aware of Draco’s existence, so after a few moments of visual indulgence, Draco returned his attention to the phone, opening up the new message that waited for him just below last night’s text conversation.
“After my sentence was up,” Draco said to his abandoned dessert, “I was so excited to get back into the real world. You know”— he glanced up, offering Harry a wry smile —”just walking down Diagon Alley, perusing the shops, enjoying the sun, taking it all in.” He’d got about seven and a half minutes of that before… “I’m sure you remember what happened…” Harry winced. Yeah, he remembered, all right. It had been plastered all over the news, after all, the ex-Death Eater finally getting what he deserved. Draco couldn’t forget it if he tried; he’d always have the scars to remind him.
When Ron had first proposed the idea of introducing Muggle coffee culture to the wizarding world — way back when Draco still struggled to call the bloke Weasley instead of The Weasel — Draco had been far from excited by the prospect of returning. If he remembered correctly, it had only been Ron and Hermione’s second visit to Beans & Serendipitea, and at the time, Draco had been convinced it was all just another inane joke out of the man’s mouth.
happy? Because it seems to me you’re stuck in a job you don’t really care about, ignoring what you really want to do — what your talent
“Nothing. Just…apparently, he agrees I’m an idiot.”
“She sent Harry one in his first year at Hogwarts, and that was it. He was one of them. It took me until Sixth Year to get one,” she added with a laugh.
Behind him, Harry let out a shaky breath, and Draco had to squeeze his eyes shut as the sound rushed up his spine like blazing wildfire. Harry’s hand still lingered on the back of Draco’s bare thigh, a warm weight grounding him to the present and keeping his every nerve-ending sizzling with anticipation.
Arthur stepped away from the bed and put his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “He
“Which is why I like it, Harry.” Draco averted his gaze to take in the room. “You know, my parents never took the time to sit down with me and make garlands out of multicoloured paper. They never let me help to decorate the tree. Salazar knows what would’ve happened if everything wasn’t absolutely perfect where someone was able to notice.”
“Did he now?”
Even so, he felt his heart racing as he cleared his throat.
“Obviously.”
“You and Charlie? Really?”
“O-okay.” Harry swallows. The collar isn’t tight by any means, Harry can easily fit his fingers between it and his neck, yet it feels like he’s suffocating. He’s never worn a slim-fitted dress shirt in his life; why would he, when tees and hoodies are so much more comfortable? It’s a nice colour on him, though — even Harry can see that — a deep, warm purple, almost shimmering in the overhead light. It’s a garment he’d never give a second glance if he were on his own, much like most of the clothes Malfoy’s had him trying out today, but just as with the rest, he finds himself trusting Malfoy’s judgement implicitly. A weird concept, indeed.
“Harry sucking at dating.” Ron grins and grabs his pint before it even touches the sticky surface.
“Wait.
Draco closed his eyes and grinned.
Draco hated that he was so weak, letting Potter lead him on like that. Hated Potter for giving him hope, for making him want. He hated Potter for making him dream. Hated him.
“Oh, don’t look at me like that,” Malfoy says, pointing his spoon at him over the table. “I’m not the one having trouble with my dating life; I can walk out that door at any time if—”
“Uh, Smaug? Do you have a dragon?”
Eventually, Draco rolled off him to lie on his back next to Harry. Harry let his head fall to the side, studying Draco’s striking silhouette while the man contemplated the ceiling.
"Me and my snake are so
Draco looks positively debauched, his usually so perfect hair tousled and standing up in all directions. His eyes are darker than Harry’s ever seen them before, blazing with desire from under heavy lids and framed by those impossibly long, golden lashes. His lips are red and swollen from their kissing and his skin is flushed — and not only a faint blush on his cheeks either, but a bright pink stretching all the way down to his hardened nipples.
Draco cocked an eyebrow but did his best not to imagine Charlie Weasley off debauching himself, or anyone else for that matter. “How do you know that’s what he was up to? He may have been spending the weekend with his saint of a mother.”
Harry's only vaguely aware that the sound is likely coming from his own mouth.
“I-I am?” Heat rushes to Harry’s cheeks, effectively ruining his intended casual, teasing demeanour.
However, when he placed the two coffees on the counter between them, her curious expression was still there. She cocked her head towards their table, a subtle motion that could have easily gone unnoticed by anyone. A gesture Draco knew he’d do better to ignore. Yet, he was powerless to resist a quick glance in the suggested direction.
to release it, just for a few hours.” Draco looks up and runs slender fingers through his long, blond locks, revealing eyes bright with unshed tears. “I thought if I came out here, if I was far enough from the castle, it wouldn’t affect you as much. You deserve so much more than this; getting wrapped up in my problems. I’m so sorry.” He turns away again, looking out into the starry sky, his wings once more on full display where they hang loosely below his broad shoulders. “I won’t hold you to anything. I promise,” he whispers.
. It must have slipped from his hand as he dove for the floor.
Draco smirked. “No, that’s
However, he does recognise Draco’s questions for the verbal landmines they are, and so he answers them in the only way he can think of: with a question of his own.
“What do I do, Smaug? I don’t want to keep leading them on, but I don’t want to disappoint them either.” He glanced at the Christmas tree. “And it would be nice to be part of someone’s Christmas for once.”
“Yes, well, I’ll just be going.”
Draco blinked, bright flames still dancing on the inside of his eyelids. The freezing rain was back in his face, sharp as shards of glass against his skin, feeling like a blessing from the grey skies above. He let out a deep breath, willing his shoulders to relax with the exhale, and looked down at the man in his arms.
“Draco, what is this?” Pansy cut him off before he managed to escape.
“There,” Draco says, giving Harry’s shoulder a friendly pat. “No need for me to stick around anymore; you’ve got this, Potter.”
He stepped through and into the reception area of the Reserve.
Unable to voice any reply, Draco went for a slight nod instead, then drew back to look at her. “I have to tell him.”
What if Potter was right? What if he’d been right about everything? Did that mean…? Draco’s fingertips went to his lips, remembering that kiss in the bathroom a year ago.
Harry grins and pulls Draco up to standing, And it doesn’t matter that he was practically draped over Draco’s bare chest only a minute ago; when Draco straightens in front of him, rendering them not even an inch apart, Harry forgets how to breathe. Their height difference is not much, and certainly not anything Harry’s ever contemplated before. Now, though, standing this close together, he suddenly realises he has to tilt his head up slightly to meet Draco’s eyes. Harry refuses to question why this revelation causes his cock to strain even more eagerly against the tight fabric of his pants; as if it was reaching out for Draco, craving contact.
Harry can’t help smiling at that. “We’re not enemies anymore, though,” he murmurs. “Haven’t been for a long time.”
“What?” The git saunters into the kitchen with an amused smirk. “I was just…”
“Yes! No! It’s not like that. It’s just… Charlie’s not the type to settle down and get married, okay? And frankly, he doesn’t seem like your type, either. He’s messy and selfish, and you’re not even willing to take him to fucking Florence with you, so why would you want to marry him?”
“Thank you, darling.” He preened. “And you look beautiful, too. Wherever did you get that dress?”
“Which doesn’t help me much, since I’m apparently pants at that too.” Harry pouts, fiddling with the napkin he still hasn’t been able to let go of after the Sauce Incident.
Not bad. The burgundy set off the lighter grey of his shirt and the dark, heathered grey of his trousers perfectly.
Draco turned to Pansy and handed her his still untouched wine. “I’m sorry, Pans. I’ll see you later. Just have to step out for a moment and beat the bollocks out of this fuckwit, for obvious reasons.” He leaned forwards and kissed her cheek. “Happy New Years, if I decide to go home after.”
“Now, stop fishing for compliments, you vain git.” Somehow, I manage a light, casual tone, lightyears from the flustered turmoil currently swirling behind my ribs. Your eyes light up at the familiar teasing banter and I manage a chuckle, albeit a bit strained, desperate to regain at least some of my precarious equilibrium. Heart racing, I tear my eyes from your heady allure and head for the door. “Just get dressed and get out of here, will you? Before the lucky guy thinks you’re standing him up or something.”
And they were. Draco looked around the room, each person pulling a jumper down over their heads, thanking Molly and exclaiming their pleasure with the gift. Pulling off the jumper he’d arrived in, leaving him in just a light dress shirt, Draco tugged the new jumper over his head and sighed.
"What's he saying?" Draco asks, tossing the cloth aside and handing Harry a glass of water.
“Yeah.” Teddy’s grin grew even wider. “He wanted to know who you were.”
“Merlin, yes. I could really use a night out.”
“Your bare arse?” Draco raised his eyebrows. “Come now, Harry, it’d only be pants.”
“I think he’s talking about Draco.” Luna smiled and took another bite of porridge. Next to her, holding her hand, Neville merely raised a quizzical eyebrow in Harry’s direction.
Draco felt heat blooming on his cheeks. Merlin, when did he grow so unaccustomed to taking a simple compliment? He typed and erased several replies before he was interrupted by a party of new patrons barging through the front door, forcing him to leave the text unanswered as he became busy with preparing drinks and grilled sandwiches for the famished study group.
A stream of fire from above followed, and Draco ran.
Hermione made a little sniffle, and Draco paused, afraid he’d upset her.
“To think, I almost didn’t come.”
Draco cleared his throat, trying to regain her attention. “Anything else?”
Draco sighed, rolling his eyes. “Anything you
.” His voice cracked, but he went on. “The Weasleys were there for me. They took me in, made me a part of the family, and Molly and I were able to grieve together.”
Saturday 3 April 1999
just like I remember you. Only healthier. Happier.
She stilled and studied him a moment; searching his face for Merlin knew what. Draco could see the wheels turning in her head.
Draco proceeded to change his mind no less than ten times as he showered and dressed for the day. Staring at the soft glow of the fairy lights, he decided he needed to clear his mind. That could only mean one thing.
“And then you were a glassblower? Just like that?”
this, ought to be the last thing Draco should do, and even as he revelled in the comfort of Potter’s embrace, he couldn’t help cursing the universe for showing him what he could never have.
It wasn’t that Draco had anything against drag queens per se, even those nearly twenty years older than him like Slyvia. It was just, well, he preferred a different type. The type that worked with their hands, and maybe had a bit of a shadowed jaw, and without question, the type who wore less makeup than Draco did.
Harry let out a low groan. “Circe, I’d hate that. I had to do it for the Wheezes once when George was out of the country for a couple of weeks. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.”
A slight movement of platinum-blond hair, caused by a minuscule headshake, and, after another endless second, a weak, cracked whisper. “No.”
“What are you doing New Year’s Eve?”
“Smaug!”
job.”
Hmm, I’m curious now. What else did you get in that kit? Care to tell me?
Merlin, just get down off that high horse already, before you fall and hurt yourself and that precious little arse of yours. No, I really don’t need you back in my life pestering me anytime soon. In fact, if you could stay as far away as possible, it’d be great. Just for a century or two? Although, I must say I am a bit curious about testing that fan repellant theory of yours sometime. Your reasoning in this case is interesting and may indeed have its merits.
What the hell made you think I’d ever be interested in becoming Minister for Magic? Godric, your brain really works in mysterious ways sometimes. And not that I have any idea how you know about my auror aspirations, but surely you would know me well enough to know I’d never use my name like that to get ahead. If I ever get the chance to be an auror, I want it to be because I have the right skills and abilities to do it, not because of my fucking name.
6 March 1999
Draco didn’t know the answer, but he didn’t care. Potter was alive; it was all that mattered.
The Scottish night air is cool as Harry waits for Draco to arrive, his nerves tightening in his stomach.
“Nevermind. It’s better if I just make up a fun story in my head.”
It would be infuriating if Harry wasn’t right. As it was, though, Draco
Anyway, enough about my weird friends. Let’s talk about yours instead. As I’ve understood it, Tracy Davies and the Greengrasses are at Beauxbatons this year. I don’t know if the transfer was by own choice or if their parents made it for them, as the Patils did, but I’ve overheard Parkinson talking about them with Bulstrode so I assume she’s still in contact with them, at least.
