Cassie somehow maintained decorum, keeping her face blank and serious, but Draco just knew that once they were no longer privy to outside eyes she'd be grinning like Christmas had come early. She loathed Moody just as much as Draco, if not more, and they had known he was bad news from the start. For him to be put in his place in front of Dumbledore, by Severus Snape of all people!
Dumbledore raised a hand to lightly rest on Severus' shoulder, and the latter released Cassie with the greatest reluctance. Sensing their departure the labyrinth parted to create an opening. Draco grabbed Cassie's hand before stepping over the threshold, both looking over their shoulders to wave as the wall closed up behind them.
Cassie had passed out with her head resting between the bed and the wall. Snape quickly moved to get her back into bed with Andrew not too far behind him. The latter turned to help him lift Draco up once she was settled, and despite his small frame Draco was unbelievably heavy. All that siren muscle had to go somewhere, he guessed.
Fallen trees with trunks taller than Draco in diameter had been hollowed out to act as bridges between the three islands. Draco could see one coming up in the distance, a group of young kids chasing each other through one. He wondered what it would have been like for him to grow up here instead, never seeing the world outside of this safe haven. He wondered if news of the impending war was even scarier considering sirens were being targeted by Voldemort, or if they were blind to the threat lurking around the corner.
"Something like what?" he asked, feeling like a child with how small he felt.
to his left as Andrew added the last potion ingredient. Draco could already taste the bitter concoction sticking to the sides of his throat. How dissonant it would make him feel once it started to take effect in his system.
Dumbledore moved in the corner of Draco's vision. "No, but my guess is that it's the same culprit as the first time. I'm so sorry for your loss, my dear."
He swallowed the Draught in one gulp, and was grateful for its almost immediate effects. It was the small blessings in life, truly. Not everything was naught.
This is exactly what he had been trying to avoid! Sure, if Andrew was alone, whatever! There was no need for Draco to be a casualty of the probable truth.
"You definitely belong in Slytherin, there's no mistaking that. Circling back to my so-called illness, did you invent any specific symptoms for me to emulate?"
"Wait, weren't you already planning on going with Zabini? You asked him a few weeks ago, did you not?"
Draco thrashed in Snape's hold, trying to yank his wrists free from Andrew and Corey's hold. It was a futile effort, weakened by the potion they'd haphazardly shoved down his throat. But even when drugged Draco remained a force to be reckoned with.
Refusing to look at her, knowing he'd burn up with embarrassment at the look she was most definitely giving him, he began to disrobe and make his way out onto the porch. Corey followed, going to close the door behind him, when Cassie decided to get her two cents in.
He blinked. "So I'm going to take a wild guess and say neither of them told you about that..."
"Are going to the Ball together?" Hermione supplied.
Andrew's reasoning fell upon deaf ears. "Do you think Narcissa will be upset?"
Potter had been the most recent addition to his headache. Severus was long past the point of wanting to hex Albus, but the last thing he needed right now was to try and wrangle a
Cassie tilted her head in consideration. "Usually the civilizations beneath the Islands are considered the 'residential areas' for sirens. I believe the best comparison for Amphitrite is that it is much like the muggle state of Texas: lawless and wild. Most of those that live on Amphitrite are Sea Devils and Sea Demons, historically it's always been that way."
Dumbledore cleared his throat once more, reigning the room in with the simple sound. "Alastor, the offense you have committed is entirely unacceptable. I cannot let it go unpunished."
And, as he rushed out of the door, flying down the staircase and out into the castle, Snape sat unmoving. His hand still resting atop Cassie's leg, he gave her ankle a light squeeze before he continued.
The Gryffindors, well. There were some capable enough to unearth his secrets, and once someone found out it would spread like wildfire throughout the whole school. The Ministry would be upon him in mere seconds, swift to deliver his death sentence. Even worse, if they kept it secret, they'd use it to hold it over him and blackmail him into doing their dirty work. He could barely fathom being dragged into one of their reckless schemes.
"I'm not asking you to decide, I'm asking for your opinion," he countered.
Everything happening around him was simply an echo, unimportant.
If his stomach weren't already empty, he would've been sick. Instead, coughs wracked his body as he dry-heaved while struggling to sit up.
She lightly shook their entwined pinkies, as though they were shaking hands before a Quidditch match.
"What're you reading?" he mumbled, not bothering to open his eyes.
Of course Cassie had inherited her father's flair for the dramatic. Draco couldn't be so lucky as to be spared from the theatrics that were going to go down once seated in Dumbledore's office.
That look, full of resignation and sadness and
"Narcissa thinks we should move them to the Islands until we figure out the underlying reasons for their... afflictions," Severus muttered. He likely thought Draco was asleep or he wouldn't have said anything while he was in the room.
His voice trailed off with a choke, and for the first time in his life, Draco watched as the man struggled to collect himself. McGonagall turned to Cassie with an evaluating look.
Ah, yes. The dreaded event that meant everyone would be staying over Winter Break, and would draw unwanted attention to Draco if he didn't make an appearance. His mother had already had him measured for new dress robes in August, and they would be arriving within the next week, likely along with a stern reminder he still had certain appearances to keep up.
I figured since Draco was learning about the non-magical world in an American setting, it only seemed fair that he would learn the American terminology instead of the English ones
Narcissa entered her sister's vault with a feigned distaste only meant for the goblin's eyes. Satisfied, he let them be, letting the vault close behind them to give them privacy as they carried out their business.
Corey left, and Andrew went back to his potions notes. He'd been working on the theory for this brew for months now, and he still needed to figure out what could balance out the gillyweed without disrupting the potion's integrity. It also couldn't interact with the Black Sea clay, which was temperate in most cases but could turn south quickly if it disagreed with too much of one other ingredient.
He shouldn't have felt this hurt, he had never told either of them about his crush. Realistically, it was a long-shot to begin with. Andrew was two years older and had known Cassie for years (not to mention also being a year closer to her in age), and had barely gotten to know Draco over the course of a couple months.
Cassie frowned. "With Draco."
Not even twenty-four hours later, and he was back on the same couch. Only difference was Cassie was now in the middle of Draco and Andrew, and she was in a much brighter mood as she watched McGonagall pace back and forth, Mad-Eye sat with his arms crossed in an armchair and Potter stood nearby shifting from foot to foot every two seconds. Dumbledore had yet to arrive, so when the door swung open, there was no surprise when it was he who entered, Snape not far behind.
"Draco isn't?" Corey sat dumbfounded, and he could see the exact moment it clicked. "Oh. That makes a lot more sense, actually."
Except... He'd be betraying Harry. It wasn't something he was capable of doing anyways, seeing as it'd go against his very nature... But even if it were a choice he'd be able to freely make, would he? Dare he risk betraying Harry's trust in him by just entertaining the idea?
The siren smiled at him, for once his eyes glinting softly, no hint of mischief or disdain. He had somehow moved so his knees were pressing into Harry's thigh, their faces even closer as he leaned in further.
"Whatever you decide, you know I'll support you," Severus whispered to him, "but you need to decide now. You'll need to leave soon if you're to get back to the Islands, before
It was only once he was in his private quarters that Cassie began to take an inventory of him. "Draco, where does it hurt?"
Like the water, he, too, felt trapped sometimes. Like a tiger in a cage forced to watch living beings different than him gawk and stare from the outside, in.
"Dear Merlin, what the hell is that?" he grumbled, surprised Andrew hadn't passed out from being so close to it as the elder siren added its contents to the potion.
"They've gotten Narcissa to safety, but Lucius exposed her secret, all of his followers will know before midnight! If he reveals that Draco is alive, we're fucked, am I clear? Tell the Order I don't give a damn about some trial, Lucius needs to be dealt with!"
"Before I go, can I see her?"
Another
The next sequence of words that left the headmaster's mouth had Draco reeling.
Harry didn't recognize the spell, but didn't get the chance to see its effects. Before it could hit Malfoy a shield had formed around him. Malfoy, looking around in confusion, must not have been the one to cast it.
"Compost! A variety of fruit peelings and tea leaves, and I'm pretty certain Cass threw a dead fish in there at some point that she found in the lake."
Something deep in Harry's bones reverberated with the sound, otherwise he might not have noticed it in the slightest. That same something told him this note was her Song, the one ability that made sirens so feared by the wizarding world. But, just as though he was a siren himself, Harry was now immune to the effects of any Siren Song directed at him. But if she couldn't Sing to force Draco to calm down, then what was the point of using her Song at all?
"Was there a moment when you knew... When you knew you loved Andrew?" he said, trying to keep his tone as neutral as possible.
"Right! Right..." Potter scratched the back of his head. "So, um, can I talk to you? In private?"
Feeling a surge of Gryffindor bravery, he surged forward. He'd get answers if it killed him.
"I really tried, Andy, I really did. But no matter how much Narcissa asks of me, I couldn't get him to feel that way for me."
"Is that where you two have been? Teleporting all over the place?" Draco wished he'd been there to see that. He assumed it was a lot like apparition, and would've gotten a laugh if Cassie landed somewhere without her eyebrows.
She sat up on the couch, leaning forward enough so he could see the twinkle in her eyes. "Don't worry, princess, I left all of the creative freedom up to you. The popular theory, however, is that is has to do with your heart. It would explain why it's something the Healers haven't managed to heal after all of this time, with it being one of the more complicated organs."
"Do you feel better now?"
"Snape's been trying to help me improve my occlumency but I can't seem to get it right- Draco, are you alright?"
"Can you add 'improving the taste' to your to-do list, then?" he whined.
Draco thrashed from where he was being restrained by four sirens, eyes pitch-black and teeth sharp as razors. Unlike the previous times Harry had seen him like this... He didn't seem like Draco anymore. Didn't seem to recognize his surroundings.
Hermione glared at him from the desk to his left. She was taking plenty of notes for the two of them, who cared if he knew the theory behind bonding magical cores between species! If they could just tell him what they needed him to do, this would be much less painful for everyone involved.
"Of course he
"C'mon, it's about time I dragged you out for a real swim, not just you doing laps in this pool." Cass blinked, her second set of eyelids sliding shut, making her entire eyes an inky black that Draco tried not to see his reflection in. He blinked as well, ready to get this over with, and dove down after her.
The arctic pod was the definition of passive. Unlike the Islands, only Nightingales resided within, and they minded their own business to the fullest extent. They could hunt in peace there, and the muggles stayed obvious to their actions, accepting it as a residual effect of the dangers at the poles.
"Two feathers of a fledgling raven."
Their cackling died down, leaving them both laying there side-by-side staring up at the pink and orange paint strokes in the sunset sky. Draco felt like his whole body was thrumming with happiness.
"Did I not tell you that scratching would make it worse?" she chastised.
Andrew had turned his back to him, but Draco could
"Tell me how you did it!" Potter demanded.
Because he wasn't an idiot, Draco knew that Harry's stuff had been moved into that room while he'd been asleep. Andrew was
He set the pieces of parchment down, knowing he would not be able to get any more studying in now. "Oh?"
"Are you alright, mate?" Weasley muttered behind him.
Corey's eyeroll could be heard in his voice. "Sir, with all due respect, fuck off."
"While that's the opinion of the merpeople, that's not the opinion of the sirens," Hermione stated, "they loathe the beast status as it justified the mass genocide of their kind."
Draco would never be the same because of it. It was the last pure thing he had in his life, he couldn't move on from it. Had no desire to do such a thing.
"No," he managed to get out.
It had been a moment since he had thought about that peculiar tidbit of his life. He chewed on his lower lip in anxious thought, the skin raw and tender from the day's ministrations.
The entrance door swung open with a telltale creak, barely-there footsteps indicating Cassie had returned. Knowing there was gossip to be shared, he was grateful he was mostly finished with his schoolwork for the day.
"It would've made him feel better about me and Harry," he mumbled.
Cassie was a bit behind Andrew in her abilities, but she made up for it by being much faster a swimmer. He may be able to skip around to get ahead, but it did not take very long for her to catch up.
They were in Draco's dormitory, which had once again been rearranged to accommodate new circumstances: the room was mostly the same but had taken on an extra three doorways. The first was just a passageway that connected directly to Severus' office for ease of access, one was Corey's new bedroom, and the other had three spare beds inside.
Malfoy Manor was like a Dementor in how it sucked the life out of the room before anyone even set foot in it. It smelled as such, but that also could be attributed to the dead body rotting atop of the dining room table. Even coming in through the Floo, cold had settled into his bones the second he'd arrived.
Umbridge's lips were pursed, the toad looking like she had bit into something sour. She likely hadn't anticipated the two of them teaming up against her, especially not like this.
Ezio continued to argue, with the occasional shout of agreement from the other two Elders with him. The Oracles, on the other hand, did not seem eager to try and defend Aegeus. Instead, they had no qualms with throwing him to the wolves.
The two had the apartment all to themselves. While Draco knew this was intentional, a small part of him wished he could've sat with his friends. Things were different now. He was different now.
She shrugged. She had to've known this was the only direction this conversation would take. Why bother bringing the subject up, if not to ruffle Draco's proverbial feathers?
Corey shoved his shoulder into Draco's. He could nudge him all he wanted. Draco would not relent in his stubbornness.
Weasley paled, failing to catch on to the obvious sarcasm. What Granger saw in those fools, Draco would never know. She was far too intelligent for their likes, not that he'd ever say it aloud to her face.
His fifth-year companion spoke up. "You're free to brood if you want, or you can say what's on your mind. The latter would be much healthier for you, emotionally."
She spoke up, "They are fledgling feathers, it is likely that they have not been born yet. One will come before the other, but they will be of the same bloodline. We just need to closely watch the Nightingales born over the next few years, surely it cannot be that hard to deduce the prophecy children."
This was not the first (frankly, not the last either) time they had gone over this very conversation. But it wasn't every day that you risked being outed as being part magical creature--long thought to be extinct--and getting yourself murdered as a result. All because he didn't want to be privately educated, wanted to be as normal as he could and continue going to school like his friends.
Cassie smiled at him, her reaction slowed as she barely clung on to reality.
"It's Jessica. The Magical Congress found her body off the coast of Florida... she's dead, Draco."
Something still itched at the back of his mind. "Why tell McGonagall about Andrew being a siren at all? Doesn't that make me a more suspicious candidate to also being one?"
Draco lost his train of thought as he walked into the bath and was confronted with the calm stare of the pool. He spun on his heel to leave, but was met with firm hands on his chest pushing him back into the room.
Harry gave him a look of sympathy. No potion had been able to ease his suffering and Severus was beginning to look mildly concerned as a result. It wasn't often that the Potions Master was left stumped. Draco was also quite certain that Harry felt a tinge of guilt every time he looked at him and hadn't yet determined the best way to stamp that out.
Malfoy and his bloody smiling face, all high cheekbones and grey eyes, a face he had literally picked out of a crowd a hundred times. A face that... A face that...
The panic in Andrew's muffled voice on the other side of the door felt like a bucket of artic water being dumped onto his head. Straightening his rumpled clothes as best as he could, he threw the door open, fear sending hot sparks down his spine at the look on Andrew's face.
They were the opposite of blind.
Come December, Draco had returned to some sense of normalcy in terms of his class attendance. The pitying glances diminished, and Cassie was less likely to be found glued to his hip outside of their shared classes.
as you might've already guessed, the Horcrux Hunt is a bit out of order compared to canon. Bear with me, as more will be explained/make sense as the story moves along, but this timeline diverged from canon a looooong time ago (this chapter would be set at the start of summer after Fifth Year, to give you an idea)
He'd kissed Harry.
They could've stayed like that for hours for all he knew. In the moment it felt like it, just the two of them. Harry focused on staying still and giving him the time he needed. He'd stay like this all day and night if he had to.
Too bad he was a whole two years ahead of Draco, and also not a Hogwarts student. It really put a wrench in his plans to absolutely ravish him.
"Perhaps she'll be grateful upon us healing her, then. If we bond her to me then she'll have no choice but to swear her loyalty."
Lucius let his tears fall. "Tell me, is he mated? My son?"
Andrew then tried shoving her out of the booth onto the floor. She was ready, hands gripping the table like her life depended on it, and Draco could see her feet planting onto his own booth for more leverage.
"You knew you would be able to see the threstrals," Cassie muttered to him. They briefly separated to climb into the carriage, shared with some older Hufflepuffs Draco vaguely recognized.
He nodded, not capable of any more words, his throat tightening and holding the air in his lungs captive.
"You're insane," Severus said, resting his head in his hands.
"Yes, but his symptoms don't line up with any of them! It all sounds like symptoms of delayed growth spurts and siren presentation, which is common in sirens hidden among wizard-kind. His death doesn't make any sense-"
When he opened his eyes the next time, he was tucked into his bed. His robes had been changed, and their was no lingering taste of vomit on his breath. There was a vial of Dreamless Drought on his nightstand, and a small bowl of oatmeal placed under a stasis charm. Sunlight trickled in through the stained glass windows of his room, the rays fluttering about as a result of the lake water they had to breach to travel this far down.
, Parkinson had explained with pity as he'd asked,
Dumbledore cleared his throat, looking back at the teachers table before speaking. If he noticed Snape's absence, he didn't look twice.
"We had to dump the bodies in the sea and get rid of the surviving witness. Ironically, not the first time we've been in that particular scenario. But, uh, after I drowned the poor sod, Andrew made this offhand comment. About how he 'wouldn't want to be an accomplice to murder with anybody else.' Then he just smiled at me, and I knew. I was in too deep."
Sat across from him, his cousin straightened in her seat, looking at something over Draco's shoulder.
"It means that if I were to break your promise, that you'd have the right to cut off my finger. It means it's a promise of the highest regard. So, pinky promise."
Ron blinked, sitting upright to look at Harry like he'd grown another head. "Yeah, mate, what about it?"
hell. So many questions were spinning around in his head, accompanied by a silence so loud it was painful.
Draco wiped the blood from his mouth, wiping it off against his scales and letting the crimson dissipate in the water. The Death Eater that Andrew had yanked from his broom sank faster than an anchor towards the bottom of the ocean, face suspended in a state of shock, eyes wide with fear.
Snape finally released his grip from his shoulder to shove him forward. Harry barely noticed the water seeping into his socks and shoes. Draco was likewise released, and Corey shared a look with the professor before slipping under the water, his red spines the last sign of him.
"I think that you and Cassie should not have turned this into a game," Andrew replied, yet there was no bite to his words.
TW: (slight) internalized homophobia, panic attack/hyperventilating
TW: mention of nausea/imagery of vomiting, anxiety attack, hyperventilation
Dolores Umbridge's eyes were as lifeless as they had always been. Although, this time was significant, because the light behind them had been literally extinguished.
"Pray tell, your qualifications for parenting advice?" Snape droned from his corner of the teacher's lounge.
"Get him in the water, now!"
He had been caught in his staring.
This was fine. It was fine, Draco can handle himself.
He spooked a bit as Severus spoke out of the blue. The Potions professor looked quite pale.
She ducked back behind the pillar, inching her head around the corner ever so slowly. She bit back a gasp as she watched Professor Snape and Cassie dance a slow waltz to the muted orchestra floating in from nearby.
There was a break before Potions, and Harry found himself crossing the courtyard when he spotted Malfoy leaning against a tree, speaking to the bloke he'd seen him with last night. Another American, also in Slytherin robes, looking bleak at whatever their topic of conversation was.
Mind you, the only known ways a siren's mating bond has ever been broken is death. Mated sirens die together, and sirens mated to humans won't die until their mates do. But Harry would live if Draco were to die first; he'd be able to recover and move on. Fall in love as many times in his life as his heart desired. Hell, Draco didn't even have to die for Harry to move on and be infatuated with someone else.
ears.
Draco dried off and threw on the first toga he saw, barely managing to not trip over himself as he made his way to the parlor for evening tea. Cassie and Andrew were already there, curled together on the loveseat like two elderly cats begrudgingly sharing a napping space. It was almost funny how grouchy they both looked, but Draco knew the truth. Both were exhausted and overworked, and running on fumes was beginning to catch up to them. It was the boat that everyone was in; they could only scoop out the building water in pails and dump it overboard so quickly. At this point, some were hoping it would just sink already and seal their fate.
Draco groaned, burrowing further into the cushions.
Draco spun to face her, the commotion around them diverting all the focus to the front of the room.
No. "You're a bad influence," he told Cassie.
"I also thought it was utter bullshit to keep you out of the loop."
Inexcusable.
"It's time to get moving," Cassie quietly announced, and within the blink of an eye Draco was now seated on the Hogwarts express, watching through the window as Narcissa's smiling face grew further and further away from him.
She ruffled Draco's hair, and he took a deep breath in. He blinked, and his eyes returned to normal, the hostility draining from his face. Draco looked around, first in confusion, and then in mortification as he realized both the position he was in and that their audience included his godfather of all people.
Her tone had been polite, cautious. Draco bit his tongue.
He huffed, turning to gather his books for his next lesson.
for giving in to its own nature!"
Both always circled back to Draco, never getting too far away from him. He wanted to voice how grateful he was for their consideration as they were likely attuned to his anxieties at being near the Tournament. If the Ministry were to find out what lurked beneath them...
Breakfast was an otherwise quiet affair. Cassie had somehow already earned a reputation for not being someone to cross, and many were weary to engage with her early in the morning. Knowing her, she'd probably gone to the extreme the first day to make less effort for herself later on. If only
also it's been a MINUTE. school is flying by, but I'm progressing quickly in Portuguese (aka the class that takes up all my spare time) so at least I know it's paying off
Cassie swung first, hitting the one closest in the temple, and it was almost comical how fast he crumpled to the ground like a puppet getting its strings cut. Instead of backing down, the other three lunged at them, and Draco's vision went black before he could register anything else.
When the Aurors found them, they moved within the hour. The Ministry had a sorry time trying to determine their location in comparison to the Death Eaters, which said everything you needed to know on how little they knew of siren culture and history. This wasn't Voldemort's first recruitment rodeo, and he knew having sirens on his side would win him the war in a heartbeat.
Andrew began to pour a portion into a tall vial, prompting Draco to try his luck one last time. "We don't even know if it affects Voldemort's immunity to the Song, so do I really need to take a dose for a silly trip to Diagon Alley?"
As Harry rushed out his explanation on how the Dark Lord has a backdoor into his brain and has been inserting images in an attempt to manipulate him... He felt numb. No anger, no anything.
Oh. Harry blinked blankly at her.
Something wet poured over him; cold this time, not warm like fresh blood. As the pain washed away and the wound healed itself, he came to the embarrassing realization that the sound he'd heard hadn't been the rushing of blood in his ears, but the trickle and rush of a small fountain.
Cassie didn't stir from her spot on the couch. Perhaps she had smelled it earlier and died. Seemed like a logical conclusion to make.
He jogged to catch up, and Cassie took his arm in her elbow. "As you already know, Sirenum Scopuli was the birthplace of the First Siren. Each island is a distinct district; St. Achelous the home of the school and the majority of the shops, Isle Poseidon is home to our healers and elders, and Amphitrite being the island we're currently on."
Draco had leapt onto him, shoving Andrew's head underwater with a satisfying gurgle as his sentence was cut off. His victory was short-lived as Andy retaliated, grabbing Draco's hair to throw him off. The two scuffled until Draco was nearly skewered on the sharp spines of Andrew's dorsal fin--a result of a very dirty move on Andrew's part where he spun mid-grab and extended said fin--and Cassie wacked both of them with her freakishly long tail.
He was splashed with water when she dove into the pool, which earned her a glare when she resurfaced.
Cassie abducted Draco at the first opportunity she had. Said opportunity so happened to be as they were leaving the Great Hall; She had swung an arm around his shoulders and steered him away from the others, yelling some tired excuse about 'needing some quality time' with him. She led him outside and practically drug him down to the lakeside with her arm keeping an iron grip around him the whole way down.
She shrugged, as if this were a fact of life to just be accepted. "A song cannot be unsung. However, if it bugs you this much, I can counteract it by the end of the tournament."
"So she's said. I'm assuming that's why we'll be welcoming another exchange student soon?"
Draco arched an eyebrow, his lip quirked. "Missed me, then?"
"Come on, Dray, the water is perfect!"
Someone cleared their throat. Harry's head snapped to direct his attention to the sound, seeing a very flustered Hermione with a nauseated looking Ron standing before them. Before he could get a word in, Draco snarled at them.
The two of them had just gone for a swim near a neighboring reef. They had played a game of
The cat in question, Koshka, chirped in response. The darn stray had somehow turned into their cat, all because Cassie had decided to feed it after the brat had followed her in from patrol one day. Granted, the cat did keep the mice away from the potions stores, and Draco only held a grudge against Koshka because of the motherly affection he stole from him. Draco would be fine, but ideally he would not have to compete with a feline for his mother's attention.
He forced his hands away from his shin. "Sorry,
"You think I desire to face the wrath of your mother once she has made up her mind? I'm not so careless with my own life as to become an obstacle on her warpath."
What proved more challenging was the curriculum being taught to him by Cassiopeia. Sat together in a clearing of the Forbidden Forest, he carefully laid his twigs out in the formation Cassie had drawn in his notebook for him.
The fingers kept brushing through his hair, lulling Draco into a state of calm despite the dull throbbing in his sides. Everything had been handled, all he had to do was lay there and heal. Letting the darkness overcome him, he fell into a dreamless sleep.
"The Dark Lord has a keen interest in Narcissa Malfoy," Snape had informed them, "as her husband disclosed to him her status as a Nightingale siren."
Time passed very quickly after that. Trusting Severus to have everything under control, Draco's focus returned to his studies. After spending a whole summer getting impromptu private lessons from the older sirens, much of it was quite manageable. His magical core had also grown tremendously, and it meant he needn't put so much effort and concentration into his spellwork.
He could imagine the face his godfather pulled at that comment.
"Mr. Potter," Dumbledore grumbled with enough fury to part the Red Sea. He would've felt more intimidated if it weren't for the way Draco's attention snapped to just over his shoulder to release a low snarl that rumbled through his bones.
"Ron, did you see Malfoy?" he hissed, hoping the Patil sisters couldn't hear him (they could, they just really didn't care).
The dragon that Diggory was facing breathed a stream of fire awfully close to their sections in the stands, and Cassie gripped Draco's hands so tightly that he was certain he'd heard at least two of them break. He hadn't been actively watching the event as it had happened, otherwise he would've certainly had a similar reflex-fueled reaction.
Harry cleared his throat. "Since you're already upset-"
"Indeed," Severus replied, "to allow him to sleep despite his chronic pain."
He was going to kill her.
Draco leaned away from the warmth of Cassie's side to meet her eyes square on. "Is there anything you all want to share with the class?!"
"Harry, are you certain that you want to do this?" If Snape's voice didn't break him out of his reverie, it was the fact the professor had chosen to use his first name.
"First you'll have to teach me how to brew it." Along with every other relevant siren-created potions that he'd been too incapacitated to help brew the first time around. It also wasn't helpful that most of the ingredients needed were sold in apothecaries on the Islands, a place he had yet to travel to.
"First, you and me have a Triwizard Task to referee," Cassie joked, "then you can worry about your plans for summer vacation."
"Way back when, sirens lived in pods based on their subspecies. The First Siren we're all descended from was a Sounding Tomb siren, native to the oceans around Greece, you know? But pods traveled a bunch, and over time they evolved to better fit their environment. If you didn't notice, the ocean is ginormous. We needed a way to communicate across long distances; turns out the best way is by humming the same frequency as your fellow sirens' bones. From an evolutionary standpoint, it reassures us that we're not vulnerable or alone."
His friend rolled his eyes, slumping back against the desk. "Nightingales are just like that, hunting in pairs or whatever. They do it without thinking."
made Draco feel unsteady in his foundation. He wished she'd confide in him more about what She had asked Cassie to do.
Andy attempted to explain. "The Sirenum scopoli's location is covertly moved every few years, as you already know. A lot of sirens have non-siren family who can't even step foot on the island, and if it's constantly moving all over the world they might go a long time without seeing that family. A lot of sirens get privately tutored because of it. But we as a species have always been prosecuted. Some feel safest at the islands, and seldom leave them."
Potter was whiter than the Bloody Baron. Dumbledore still had that bloody twinkle in his eye, no doubt having sat back knowing he'd barely have to lift a finger to get the point across.
"I almost lost her."
know the comfort that is to be loved unconditionally by someone--up until their dying breath--but you will
He had failed to let go of Potter, who struggled to the surface for air. He wasn't certain where they had ended up, but were no longer at that blasted graveyard. Had Draco been in a better frame of mind, he would've been more careful in the moments that followed, but, alas...
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco slapped the hand away before it could touch him. "Don't touch me! I'm a beast! I could kill you right now if I wanted to."
"How could you? How could you do this to us?" He wasn't sure if it was more of an accusation or a plea for answers. He wasn't sure there was much of a difference between the two anymore. Not when it had come to this.
In her slow healing process he had unfortunately gotten to know her. The doubt had already been planted in his head the moment Lily's life had been endangered, and his hatred for James only went so far. If anything, he had begun to further despise the man for simply putting Lily at risk. Damn Gryffindors and their need to run headfirst into danger with no matter as to who they drug down with them. He figured the reason they'd never gotten along with Slytherins was simply because snakes could never get over their instinct for self-preservation. Their unwillingness to leap blindly into action made them unappealing to the risk-seekers who would never understand their perception of the world.
As he stood there, he watched the other four of his pod splash about, their roughhousing a common sight. Draco envied their true forms, wishing for his development to be complete already so he could be like them too. It'd be a full year before he'd get there, but next summer for certain. Then he would be the envy of someone else, not the other way around.
Immediately, an argument began. Or, well,
Thirteen sirens would be sent to Hogwarts by sunrise. They were to aid the Light in their war efforts, gain their trust whilst learning to trust them. The Ministry had sent an Inquisitor to oversee them, with guarantees that no harm would come to them.
And then, it was done.
"Draco? You need to take it before we go inside. C'mon, it doesn't taste that bad."
"Scratching at it is only going to make it worse."
Potter, frozen in his spot, was shouldered out of the way by a fuming Cassie. Draco was quick to fall in step, not sure how much more he could witness her covering for him. The more details released, the weaker their lies became. Although, Cassie being a skilled liar certainly moved the odds in their favor.
He shook his head, leaning back against one of the many trees of the Forbidden Forest. Ironic, how he used to fear this very place for the dark creatures that loomed within. Now, he may as well qualify as the darkest of creatures present.
"Both of us have already tried convincing him that something is off with Alastor. There's been whispers among the pods, the longer we sit by and do nothing... This may be Draco's last year at Hogwarts. Sirenum scopoli is already preparing for a complete lockdown, something they haven't done since the First Wizarding War. Narcissa wanted Draco there yesterday."
The man looked ready to hit him upside the head. "Neither of you."
the restlessness seep from her body at the touch of her mate. Utterly disgusting how sweet they were.
Cassie was audibly shivering in the bed just a few feet from his. Andrew had been forced to go to the Islands to meet with the Elders for a reason he'd been tight-lipped about before leaving, and Cass was too out of it from her pain-killing potions to be able to pry it out of him. Their symptoms had diverged almost overnight, hence him burning up and Cassie freezing cold, but the new Seer part of his brain told him that wasn't why Andrew had been called to that meeting. He would get better physically soon, but thinking about his near future beyond that filled him with a familiar sense of dread. The stink of death was almost upon him, yet he would not be the source.
Gods, once Andrew and Cassie heard about what he'd done... If not from Draco himself, then likely from Dumbledore and Severus as Potter wasn't exactly one for keeping his damn mouth shut.
"Not soon enough, it seems, I could really go for a swim right now. I despise traveling by Floo."
to him?
He could have easily continued, but Cassie's stern kick to his shin shut him up. "If someone finds out, hex them and find me. You can. If a potion explodes, Snape already knows. If you're in a different class and something goes to absolute shit, which is unlikely, Pomfrey would have to be very specific in her spell work to find out you're a siren. It wouldn't happen on accident, she'd have to be purposefully looking. Which, she won't, because no one at that damned school has any reason to believe you're anything but a pure-blooded wizard."
The portkey threw the four of them to tumble onto the muddied grounds. Draco had landed a good five feet from Potter, landing behind a headstone-
Harry promised to talk to her again tomorrow, after some much needed rest, and she began to make her way back to the dance. She had taken them both into a courtyard hallway far enough from the Hall where they wouldn't be interrupted, and barely caught herself as she went around a corner to an untimely sight.
"In your rising quadrant, you've laid your foundation twig on top of your dowsing twig. You have a habit of neglecting the importance of the foundation. The magic won't work without it, but it will if you've only fumbled with the dowsing twigs. Sure, your specifications of the spell won't be exact, but a working spell is better than a pile of sticks doing jack squat."
He had a purpose. He had a life. And he had yards upon yards of messes to clean up from when he'd let all his responsibilities go.
, um, Malfoy?"
One thing, one value he'd created and tended all his own was his love for his family. He had that. A genuine source of humanity in him he could acknowledge and value. He was a person.
Harry shook himself. If something had happened to Narcissa then he would have found out by now. Still, it was another question that needed an answer. Eventually, though Harry is not prepared to disturb the peace just yet, he’d have to start asking these questions. Mostly he would have to ask, well, living in a muggle neighborhood and sending Teddy to a muggle nursery was telling, but it wasn’t enough. He needed Malfoy to tell him point-blank that he wasn’t teaching Teddy anything inappropriate. The whole absurdity of everything had kept Harry restrained but Teddy’s father had been a
Eventually, oh Merlin,
Marge laughed, fluttering her hands about nervously. "Oh yes, Mr. Potter. I've, uh, pulled his file for you." She straightened out some parchment, running her hand down the creases and refusing to meet his gaze.
“You shouldn’t have to do this,” Hermione muttered, and to Harry’s everlasting horror, tears welled up in her eyes. “There are other ways.”
A chirp came from his ankles as he closed the door to Teddy’s room, along with the cool press of a wet nose.
Draco flushed.
“Uh,” Harry started, getting up to help but, not finding anymore work to be done, just hovered awkwardly over the table.
Draco sighed, feeling a stinging in his eyes himself. He’d had Teddy for six years, and for those six years he’d done his absolute best to distance himself from a horrible past and a vindictive present. He’d done everything in his power to create stability and safety for his charge and for himself, rearranging his entire life around the kid crying into his ratty old muggle shirt. Then, after all these years, came a spit in the face to all he’d worked to build.
it obviously, despite Pansy’s absurd riddle, but just having the option near was a comfort.
Draco said nothing, dropping his head and fiddling with Teddy’s struggling limbs.
A two-story home in muggle London.
Suddenly feeling delighted, Harry latched onto the information. “You go to school?”
Along with all those papers were two sets of birth certificates (one magical, one muggle) and a letter from Malfoy himself.
Potter but I’ve done nothing illegal by both muggle or magical laws, beyond what I’ve already been tried and acquitted for.”
Facing the crowd, Potter let go of his hand to hold his fist ahead of him, with Draco mirroring him. The old man stepped between them with the cloth Draco had carried in; a long strip of simple white silk. The crowd witnessed as the man wrapped the cloth first around Draco’s wrist, winding it three times around until his arm felt heavy, then doing the same to Potter, leaving a few feet of silk to float beneath their raised arms.
Harry smiled sadly, fiddling with the gold bands he’d been halfway coerced into wearing.
“Supper will be served soon.” Malfoy muttered, gesturing to the neatly set kitchen table that marked the boundary between the separation of the two rooms.
“Oi! You lot!” Ron called out behind him to the servants fluttering outside the room, no doubt gossiping. Harry sent them an apologetic smile when they re-entered and grabbed at his cape to help him walk. He’d sent them out when Hermione started getting a bit too maudlin.
The doorbell rang for barely a second before the door was being wrenched open.
Then, of course, there was his husband.
“Teddy.” Draco huffed around the fur, “Go shake his food.”
Beyond the head table were individual circular ones, each with a lavish centerpiece and luxuries in the hope that those who had to sit at them wouldn’t take offense that they hadn’t made the cut to sit at the head table. Hermione was at one of those tables; her parents were physicians and she herself was indispensable to him, but when there was foreign royalty you had to always show them the highest regard.
The third time Harry took a look at the muggle home may have been be less intense, less horrified, but no less emotionally engaged. It was darker, sky overcast and angry in a way Harry couldn’t help feel was directed at him. He was here for dinner with his godson for the first time ever.
"Oh bloody fu-! Hello! Mr. Potter!" The older woman exclaimed, hastily re-arranging her desk at his entrance. "Do come in. My name is Melinda Marge and I am at your disposal."
The doors of the great hall opened once more and Harry swallowed. Well, Ron wasn’t one for lying.
"It's
Andromeda sighed. "He's with family, if that's any comfort. Some distant cousin took him in, at least that's what Melinda said."
Teddy’s records arrived just a few days later, everything from school records from his muggle nursery to vaccinations to chronicled visitations from Melinda. Teddy was apparently an active little boy who plays on a muggle football team (though “team” was a stretch) and had a wide social net of friends whose information Draco also felt the need to give him, along with his class schedule. It was a bit much, but Harry felt…considered. And it certainly felt good to pepper in facts to Teddy’s life.
“Er-”
The levity almost knocked him over, and Harry’s mood instantly improved. “So she was just…?”
A patter of small steps. "...Daddy?"
Teddy pursed his lips and flicked his eyes back to Harry, pulling his heart when he saw that no, not all the fear had been removed from Teddy’s gaze. Teddy shook his head at Malfoy’s question and tucked his face into Malfoy’s neck.
"I know ." Teddy sighed, much too long-suffering for his age. He reached out a hand.
Draco huffed, a bead of sweat rolling down his head as Teddy continued to struggle. “They can give me all the raw information, but I need to know which one is pertinent to my situation.”
And just like that, Draco would never be a king.
And, well, this was why Harry couldn’t form an opinion. Malfoy was sitting across from him, haughty and poised and oozing disrespect with every breath. Yet the mere fact he was here, in his home drinking the tea Harry had served and revealing any information Harry asked for meant something.
Resentment rose fast then died just as quickly. Draco was too resigned to hold onto his anger any longer than a moment. Potter had no idea the position Draco was in, had no idea what it felt like to allow someone he’d long considered an enemy access to his child. And Teddy
Narcissa sighed, closing her paper and eyeing her son. “He is
“Mother, please.” Draco begged, holding the babe on his lap even as he struggled. “What am I doing wrong?”
That was an understatement. Harry swore he felt his heart actually stop when Teddy turned those eyes on him.
“Are you thick or are you being deliberately cruel?”
life.
Of course Draco hadn't learned that until a few weeks into his detainment, shucked away into a cell in between some of the most horrific death eaters Draco had had the unfortunate opportunity to grow to know. The guards were on loan from the Romanian ministry, and had little pity for those they were guarding. Even so, a month into his detainment a guard addressed him, gruffly telling him his father's fate and then awkwardly shuffling away when Draco began to sob.
Oh fucking stars he’d have to save this somehow. “It wasn’t that!”
“Nope!” Teddy all but screeched, taking a step away from the cat as he bounced violently up and down. His hair was a matching orange to the cat’s fur.
considering how much Draco’s hands shook at just the idea of the one night together. Ugh.
from any further war. They’ve been through enough already.”
“Ah, your Majesty,” a servant girl spoke from behind them, earning glares from her cohorts, “would you like us to relieve you of your capes?”
The ministry had come to claim him into their custody about a week after the battle of Hogwarts. Well, the international wizarding agents who were currently operating in the ministry that is, considering the Dark Lord had corrupted the majority. They'd come for him and his family at the manor. His mother had been begging his father that entire week to flee, to abandon their home that had been so abused by the death eaters and to move away. Father had had none of it, frantically sending letter after letter out to his political allies who'd never overtly sided with the Dark Lord during the war, confident he could escape charges as he'd done the last war over seventeen years ago.
“Did you see the cat?!” Teddy demanded, still bouncing. When Harry nodded, he continued, “Do you want to know his name?!”
“No no, it’s okay,” Harry said, scrubbing his eyes, “I think I’m just beginning to see just how much you didn’t want to go through with this.”
“If it makes you feel any better,” Ron said suddenly from his side, “the bloke is pretty.”
“No.”
He went to the ministry and testified for and against both death eaters and ministry officials. The international wizarding community had stepped in to help with ascertaining who was aiding Voldemort's regime and who was hindering it from the inside. Eventually Kingsley Shacklebot was declared minister and order was finally established, with regular ministry employees getting back to work.
The duvet rustled next to his ear. Somehow, Draco tensed even more.
Harry thought, and couldn’t help the slight narrowing of his eyes.
. Regardless of any impression Malfoy’s muggle home or his interaction with Teddy might have had on him, it was still Malfoy.
Teddy rummaged around in a small set of shelves filled with tapes, emerging with a purple VHS. “Have you seen this film?”
Harry ran a hand over his face. “Not here. We’re already married here. No consummation necessary.”
Both his friends cracked smiled, and Harry let it ease his anxiety. Yes, he hadn’t actually met his betrothed and that was, well, his major point of nervousness. Harry liked to think he was good at reading people, and even if they’d just met for five minutes he would feel much less stress going into this thing. Unfortunately it had all just been advisor's and diplomats he’d been able to meet face-to-face, with correspondence from Lucius Malfoy being done through letters. He hadn’t shared a letter with his son.
“And do you know why I picked to name him after the orange cat?” Teddy asked, shaking Harry’s arm in his excitement. “It’s because he loves Draco so much! Doesn’t that make sense?”
Harry should have checked up on him. Merlin. Merlin. No matter how hard it was just to keep on living, he should have visited him. Or just even given him a fucking thought beyond how Teddy was just another person he was letting down.
“Er, right.”
“Thank you all for coming to share in this joyous occasion,” Harry began, and Draco couldn’t hide his flinch. “With all the suffering and strife that we’ve fought through such an occasion is a new beginning, and I hope all of you continue to find joy in the feast and entertainment provided. Unfortunately” -he was grinning despite his words- “we have reached the part of the evening where my new husband and I must say goodbye. Thank you all again and please don’t stop the festivities on our account.” Harry raised their bound hands. Somehow Draco mustered a polite smile. “Good night!”
Harry pursed his lips and remembered the simple (albeit delicious and nothing
“Just-!” Teddy cried, grabbing at Draco’s shirt hem, “Does he
Malfoy hummed, crossing his arms.
She approached, waving a servant girl to follow behind her.
, Draco thought,
Supper crawled to a close with Teddy patting his belly theatrically and the cat winding between his feet expectantly, having actually succeeded in charming a slice of meat. Draco gathered the dishes and Teddy leapt up, picking up the cutlery where the china would be too heavy.
Teddy barreled down the stairs much the same as he’d done before, tripping on the last few steps only to catch himself on the rail. He was dressed like an adult, with a knitted cardigan over a solid colour, but more startling was the white-blond hair worn stylishly sculpted in parody of Malfoy’s current style. Teddy gave Harry and imperious look, hands on his hips before striding right past him to Malfoy’s side.
Too late, he saw the light in Harry’s eyes and how it drained away at his words. For some reason Harry had learned to find the idea of Draco stabbing him endearing. A kind of light amusement and pride at the idea of Draco sticking up for himself against an evil version of him. Too late, Draco realized he should have lied, should have said he’d gut Potter like a pig if he got too handsy. Too late, he realized he’d just lost the first bit of respect he’d ever gained from his new husband.
Hysteria crept into Draco’s chest. “I fucking know, Potter!,” he cried, then forcefully lowered his voice. “I mean, it’s an important ritual.”
. If Draco, who had taken such great pains to remove himself from that world, were to become it’s source of entertainment he couldn’t stand it. There would be no running away. Reporters would hound him for daring to do as he’d done all those years ago. And if Potter were to decide to contest him for custody? There was not a soul alive who would be on Draco’s side. Letting Potter see Teddy in structured visits was
“Er,” Harry intelligently and Draco cursed inwardly. Now, of all moments, was not the time to be combative. And
“Teddy!” Draco admonished, but went down to his knees next to the bed all the same.
“What I know,” Harry began, taking Hermione’s hand in his, “is that if I do this I spare others from petty bloodshed. I spare
Teddy crossed his arms and huffed, but slid down further under the sheets.
“So, uh,” Harry said, “you can get in first. If you want.”
way. That wasn’t what a Malfoy did.
Hermione eyed him up and down. “Kingly.” And then to his immense horror, she bundled up her skirt and sunk down into a low curtsy.
It was true. Even as he spoke Teddy leaned towards Narcissa, hands trying to grab at her hair. His mother pressed two fingers to her temple, massaging gently. “Have you tried simply- giving him attention?”
them after being denied entry-”
Malfoy noticed. “Why don’t you ask our guest if he would like to watch the film?”
Malfoy huffed. “Well you’re not exactly his favourite person at the moment.”
Flushing deeper, Draco cleared his throat.
Pansy had no compulsion to dress in foreign colours; her gown the black customary of the Malfoy kingdom with blue and violet accents. She looked absolutely distinguished. Draco looked away.
war that had taken his parents and his throne away from him was one of the bloodiest and longest wars ever to known history. When Voldemort had killed both King and Queen of the Potter kingdom Harry had just been one year old and stowed away by the stablemaster, ferried across his kingdom to be raised the joined forces of those that would oppose Voldemort’s dominion. Harry had grown into an excellent fighter and, though it pained him to admit his merits, an inspirational leader. Under his command Voldemort fell and his decades long conquest ended. It was thought only natural that Harry would ascend to the throne, but the reality of post-war politics meant that Harry needed to project stability and strength to the people who had lived under Voldemort’s rule. He needed to heed tradition, and he needed another who bore his name.
Etiquette lessons from the age of four made Draco perfect for his role. Poised and elegant, he carefully didn’t react to the sight of his future husband, though every inch of him wanted to spit a few uncharitable words.
people who lack proper manners, so I demand you accept my sincerest apologies.”
"I'm sorry? I believe I misheard." Because he had. Regardless of the ministry’s incompetence and Malfoy’s acquittal there was no way that would have gone through. His reputation alone is enough to get himself bullied out of Diagon Alley, let alone adopt a child.
“Last thing,” she muttered under her breath, and Harry held his as she took in hand his father’s crown and stood in front of him patiently.
But nothing happened. His husband just deflated, running a hand through his hair. “Fine, I’m thick. But I’m also fucking exhausted and I don’t know you well enough not to offend you, something you’ve made obvious. So tell me what’s wrong so we can both go to sleep.”
When Malfoy opened the door he barely spared him a glance before ushering Harry in, gesturing for him to add his loafers to the shoe pile. The shoe pile, along with all other domestic and trivial evidence of human occupants still left Harry flat-footed and strangely blank. An ornate bowl full of business cards and breath mints sat upon a lovely wooden table. Static photos of landscapes and nature decorated the wall. Nicks to the baseboard and bumps to the beige walls speak of a well-used hallway. Used by children.
“Oh?” Malfoy inquired, his voice gaining a bit more edge. “Well if you’re here for a pleasure visit I’m afraid you’ve already mucked it up.”
“Oh, come on, ‘Mione,” Harry said kindly, waving away her concern. “It’s not the end of the world.”
“What do you want.” Malfoy demanded. It was a stark contrast to the shrill tone he’d had before there was a child in his arms.
An unspoken message passed between them, leaving Harry warily eyeing the dagger. Before he could comment Parkinson was on her way and Draco was sheathing the blade once more, but instead of sending it off with the rest of the gifts he slid it into his belt.
Harry ignored him, taking advantage of how his husband had turned to watch her leave by gently tapping his wrist. “Do you know her?”
“He calls you ‘Daddy’.”
The sound of scribbling broke the silence and Harry watched as Andromeda scrawled something on the back of an unopened letter.
Draco clenched his jaw, hands flying through the rest of his clasps. “You don’t know that.”
The woman smiled, kind but brisk. "Could I speak to you? It will only take a moment."
He’d only had two occasions to wear it so far; his coronation and the diplomatic meetings that went into creating this whole affair.
Steam curled upwards off of Harry's teacup. He desperately wanted a sip. "That's it?"
And they did bow. As he passed they fell in waves, lowering their heads in a respect that made his insides squirm, but gave him a reprieve to lift his head just momentarily to the ceiling of the great hall. The hall itself was a lovely, if bland, light grey stone that supported itself with columns interspersed where the rows of guests sat. Of course, it was lavishly decorated but somehow all the flowers and ribbons couldn’t hold a candle to the ceiling. It was a twisting symmetry of carved stone and stained glass, leaving huge swaths of natural light into the hall; colours dancing in geometric patterns on the walls no matter where you turned. The stone running in between the glass had the Potter history carved into it, with marriages and treaties and all other notable periods in history permanently etched above their heads. The fire that had burned the corpses of Voldemort’s conquest had happened in this hall, and the ash had coated the ceiling, hiding the beauty beneath for decades. While much of his family’s history had been lost with book burnings and the destruction of monuments, the ultimate record had survived. Beneath his parents ashes.
The woman stared at him carefully, steepling her fingers then bringing them down to rest on her lap. "We would be very grateful if you could take him in."
had been Draco’s wedding vow. It was a deliberate choice.
For the first time that night Draco met his eyes voluntarily, sharing a brief moment of understanding before the circumstances seemed to catch up to him, forcing Draco to avert his eyes.
Harry had never felt that before. Had never felt the exhaustion in his limbs that he couldn't shake out. Never felt the fog in his head begging him to go back to bed. He hadn't felt bad, he'd just felt tired.
Quiet fell between them, their mutual failure taking up all the air. Six years. For almost six years Lupin's son had been raised by absolute strangers while the people who were trusted to care for him wallowed in grief and pain and illness and who knew what else. Regardless of all that, regardless of what his healer would say, the responsibility towards children always came first.
The question was awful. Would Draco have let Harry bed him? Yes, it was his duty. Would Draco have let Harry brutalize him? Well, there was the fantasy and there was the truth. In the fantasy Draco had Pansy’s knife under the pillow, carefully waiting like Draco had the whole thing planned from the beginning, like he was in control. When Harry displayed any sadistic tendencies that would have maimed Draco for life he would casually pull the blade out, stabbing directly into Harry’s stomach and tearing until Harry stopped moving. The movement would be clinical and neat. Everything done to the precise plan in Draco’s mind. But that was only a fantasy Draco used to help him, to empower him and make him believe he had a choice. In truth, what would Draco have done if Harry had been a bastard unworthy of a Malfoy? He would have frozen in fear and cried through the pain, riding everything out with the idea of seeing his mother in the morning.
Harry's tea was finally cool enough, but he didn't drink.
said, holding a bundle of fabric in his arms.
Ignoring the weakness in his limbs caused by a relief Draco refused to let himself feel, Draco pushed himself up until he was sitting, finally the same height as Harry. “Look,” Draco said, still feeling the press of expectations, “we still have to.”
,” the woman whispered, putting a soothing hand in to tuck the blanket more firmly around the child.
"They're still able to, did you read the section on gill infections? Or the one on peculiar parasites?" She did her best to be helpful. Circe knows how much of a sensitive subject Draco was to Harry.
Snape nodded, looking resigned. "Which is why she spoke to no one before leaving."
Cassie wrapped her arms around him. "But you don't love him, right? You know sirens only fall in love once, and I need you to tell me now if you do, it'll change everything-"
"She's not actually going to drown herself, is she?" Draco hoped he hid the hint of fear from his voice.
He hadn't been able to tell last night, but... It was much, much longer than he expected. Draco didn't even reach six feet tall in his human form, but that was the length of his tail by itself. It made sense when you considered how deep down sirens had to dive on top of the fact they could swim across oceans within a matter of days (but only if they stopped for breaks, according to Corey).
Draco didn't need to look to know who it was. Bloody Gryffindors. Why couldn't they ever just leave well enough alone?
Draco's mind then drifted to Andrew, a thought he had to quickly shake away. He was two years older than Draco, and would never ask him out even if Amortentia had been slipped in his morning coffee. No one would be appalled if he went with a bloke, it wasn't unheard of in the Wizarding community, and not anything to be ashamed of. He was the only heir in his family, and in the past would have deterred him from any sort of public announcement to his sexuality. It'd disgrace his family if he displayed intentions to not continue his bloodline.
Harry almost gave himself whiplash with how quickly he turned back to Draco. "You think-?"
Mad-Eye Moody was much like looking at a fish left out to rot for much too long. Draco didn't dare dive any deeper than that, not needing the nightmares of whatever he'd find.
Again, that summer had been Draco's favorite, by far.
It wasn't long after that Draco fell back into the darkness.
Those lions really couldn't leave well enough alone. What made them think they had the right to dig into other people's personal lives, anyway? Curiosity should just do them all a favor and kill the cats already.
He gasped awake.
"Draco," Hermione turned to him, "Do you think you'll attend the Yule Ball?"
Draco groaned, "that sounds way more like a prophecy than just a good guess."
"There are times like this where I wish to burn that whole institution to the ground for the atrocities they've committed."
"If you so much as get a scratch in that bloody maze, I'll never let you out of my sight again," he warned. Dumbledore and McGonagall both shared looks of amusement at the rare outwardly display of emotion on behalf of the Potions professor.
"Mr. Malfoy?" Dumbledore was talking straight to him. "Are you alright?"
While she had scales covering her entire body neck-down, he only had patches here and there, as well as from his lower torso to the tops of his thighs. He had webbed hands and feet, she had a gorgeous six-foot long tail. He despised how long of a process his presentation was, just wanting it to be over with so he'd stop looking so ridiculous. He felt ridiculous.
Begrudgingly, Harry chuckled.
Was he teasing him?
And just like that Draco's demeanor sharpened, the uncomfortable longing he'd felt and dismissed during his time detained growing until the feeling flared brightly and painfully in his stomach, along with the gut punch of a realization.
Fluff and angst you know the drill. Introducing a cat, a draco perspective, and a child that loves it when adults listen to him even when he hates them. God I love teddy hes just such a wacky kid.
So this was it.
“Mother!”
could ever have accomplished) meal they’d had a week ago. Shrugging, Harry cut into his meat and took a bite, only for his salivatory glands to erupt and send a very urgent message to his brain telling him to
Harry cringed internally, one extra gift more than planned. Great.
hotel of all things, Draco began a new existential crisis.
With only a few more minutes and minimal fuss Teddy was tucked in and seconds from passing out. Tantrums take more out of him than anything, and Draco was grateful it happened at bedtime rather than during the day where he had to keep him awake and deal with a cranky Teddy in order to make sure he slept at his bedtime.
Malfoy’s eyes flicked up to meet his. “Absolutely eloquent compliment, Potter. You should be a food journalist.”
Draco took it.
“Ron!” Hermione gasped and ran to his side, getting caught up in one of his best friend’s famous hugs.
Teddy's eyes slid over to Harry's and it took all of his willpower not to gasp. Teddy truly had Tonks' features, brown hair worn short and the dark eyes Harry knew would twinkle with mischief. He was clutching at the banister, shoulders to his ears and tiny fists clenched to his chest, staring at Harry with wide eyes.
“He’s a metamorphagus. I’m told his mother had the same ability.” Malfoy ran his hand over Teddy’s head as he spoke.
Doors opened from behind them, the opposite end from the entrance to the great hall they’d used. Sunlight illuminated them and for just a moment Draco let himself relish the picture they made, halo’d by the light coming in from behind them.
Draco glared. “Of course I give him attention. I’m not neglectful.”
“Hi, there.” He murmured, letting his voice pitch itself higher. Teddy stared. He wasn’t fussing at least.
Potter spoke first. “To join my house, to act as a Potter in all grace and duty, you must rescind all prior loyalties. Do you accept?”
Marge squirmed. "We hadn't known it at the time. There was no paperwork-"
Teddy’s eyes flicked between the two adults staring at him suspiciously, an eerily familiar nose wrinkling as his face started scrunching up.
The old man hummed. “Then we can begin.”
Teddy giggled.
“Look,” Harry said, hands raised in surrender, “I don’t know what’s happening. You have to tell me.”
Harry clawed at his neck trying to draw in breath but the rage was too much, his face was twisted and the smell of blood was so close he could taste it.
“Alright.” Malfoy said, finishing off his tea with one last delicate sip. “You can see him.”
A crown was placed on his head, smaller, with less height than the one Potter wore and without the jewel centerpiece, but the same style and colour of gold.
Draco rolled his eyes, serving Teddy a portion of green beans which he accepted much too excitedly for it being vegetables. Teddy was a weird kid.
Harry grimaced, glaring at the peeling wallpaper of grimmauld place. He’d have to. He would have to find a way to reconcile the two people. Harry didn’t know how to proceed without all the information and his godson’s health and happiness were at stake. There was obviously a relationship between Teddy and Malfoy, they’d spent six years together for bleeding’s sake, but beyond that and a ten minute confrontation Harry didn’t know anything about their lives. Anything about
“A lovely gift, but I’m afraid I couldn’t part with my own sword for very long,” he said, patting his hip.
Harry made tea.
Harry shrugged, dropping his bag by his feet. “I’m sure it’s nothing I can’t handle.”
Which was why Harry wasn’t feeling exactly cheered by the relative success of the ceremony. Draco was, well he was beautiful of course, and Harry got the sense that Draco knew it. He was poised and elegant and regal in a way Harry feared he’d never master. Where Harry had grown up in war camps, acting as a soldier from as young as eleven and traveling from place to place without any stability, Draco had grown up a prince. He’d grown up studied and sheltered and loved, if how his mother traced a comforting hand down his arm was any indication. He was starkly slender compared to Harry’s build, even though his physique was obviously masculine. From the few moments he’d held his husband’s hand it was obvious that he’d never truly trained in combat or done any hard labour, making Harry just a bit self-conscious of his own callouses.
Harry flexed his left hand from where it rested on the table, tied to the pale hand only a few inches away. There was enough slack in the binding for them to each comfortably eat their meals and, well, apparently not talk. Just next to Draco sat his mother, a gesture Harry had hoped would act as a sort of peace offering. Instead, Draco was well and truly facing away from him, letting his mother chat to him about gossip Harry had no interest in.
“Could we please watch this film, Mr. Potter?” he asked demurely, hands held politely in front of him.
tw for: discussions of non-con (as a concept), gore (in history), violence, and any other triggers associated with the arranged marriage trope.
“Ah,” Ron sighed, appearing more wistful than offended, “This takes me back.”
He was acquitted on all charges, released from the chains binding him in front of an audience of judgment and shuffled out of the courtroom to a private hallway.
It was a good thing Harry wasn’t drinking his tea. “You have a
Maybe they weren't entirely correct. It had certainly felt like Draco had believed what he'd espoused. He'd
Harry quickly closed the door and locked it, sighing something awfully fierce as he dragged Draco over to a large vanity. With nary a word Harry released his hand, instead busying himself with removing his crown and shaking out the bits of gold from his hair. Draco couldn’t move, feeling rushed and disregarded. His inaction really wasn’t helping any, as Harry had already moved on to the clasp in his boots, not wasting any time.
That being said I hope you all enjoy what has been an extremely fun thing to write.
Harry reached over to the bedside table, lighting more candles and bringing colour back to the room. Draco flinched when he turned back around. He looked…extremely tired.
What Harry wanted was for the world to be what was promised to him.
“Can you go to your room now?” He asked, hushed.
Harry gave it a sad look, but knelt down to accept the crown. It had been his father’s, and he’d been wearing it the day Voldemort had killed him. It had been revealed that when they’d been killed Voldemort had ordered their bodies be burnt to ash, which they had, but the crown had stayed intact. It hadn’t melted or lost even an inch of its intricate shape. Voldemort had taken the crown as a trophy, but when he’d been overthrown the foot-soldiers had discovered the crown and brought it back. It would have brought them great fortune if they’d sold it, but the peasant army had brought it back to Harry.
Such a taunting idea, having a job to return to after such an earth-shattering shift. For years Harry had nothing to fill his days, and now responsibilities clashed. Harry had walked into work that morning with circling thoughts that demanded his attention, firmly pulling him away from his duties. Well Teddy was his duty now, wasn’t he? His duty as a godfather was to ensure his safety, and Harry hadn’t even ensured his
than the horrific reality of a public custody battle. No matter how much it tore at him, Draco needed to create a place for Potter in his life. The alternative was too horrible to contemplate.
Bastards.
“I can’t be?”
tw for expectations of dub con. Basically yall know the messed up wedding rituals usually present in medieval stories? A lot of those things will be addressed this chapter so if you have any squicks or triggers be warned.
The film turned out to be quite cute, if a little dated. Mostly Harry just let himself revel in the strangeness, if only because he was sick of feeling awkward. He was sharing a couch with Draco Malfoy and that was just his life now. He was watching cartoon cats play jazz music and watching his godson pop up and start kicking out his legs in mimicry. He was feeling amused at the idea that Malfoy would be compared to an extremely mothering and feminine cartoon cat and delighting in how Malfoy would squirm at the comparison. It was
Draco ground his teeth. Well, in for a knut…
the expectations, not sit and stew and wonder about the sexual proclivities of this brutish culture.
"Mate!" Ron called from a floor below. It was Monday, which meant that Ron was over for a delicious takeout dinner. Hermione would be working late and as such wouldn’t be around to frown over the lacking nutritional value. It also meant that Harry had to suffer through Ron’s internal struggle to pick a restaurant, as if they wouldn’t be ordering from the exact same fish n’ chips place they always go to.
“Oh?” Harry asked, but not really. His voice sounded deadened.
Harry didn’t have it in him to be angry about it, feeling off-kilter. “Er, sorry.”
“You sit with him and give him toys. You don’t talk to him, Draco.”
Marge giggled embarrassedly. "Ah, yes, well, um, so you see-"
“You talk
This specific custom had all been explained to him beforehand of course, but faced with the reality of the next step killed any joy he might have found in his aesthetic.
“Well,” Harry said slowly, his voice obviously meant to be soothing but came out as more hurt, “of those two options, I hope I’m thick.”
“You need to leave, Potter.” Malfoy said, in a tone that brook no argument. He sounded like Mrs. Weasley.
Hermione scowled, and made sure Ron noticed her scowl from where she walked on his other side. “Seriously, Ronald?”
Harry turned to Malfoy for clarification and was startled to find him already watching him. Slowly, Malfoy nodded. “When it was clear Teddy was a metamorphagus it would be too dangerous to allow him to go to a muggle school unsupervised. I used the muggle nursery, but now he goes to a private wizarding institution to learn his basics…” He trailed off, looking uncomfortable. “I can send you his records if you want them.”
Harry desperately wanted to say, but the words tied themselves into knots in his throat. He was. Technically. Maybe literally.
Malfoy nodded, fiddling with the sleeves on his jumper. "It will."
“Told you.” Kennedy grinned. He’d been watching Harry the whole time he read the file. Harry refused to let himself care.
He apparated. He couldn't stay there and even attempt to regain his control, not while Malfoy had his godson's hand in his. Not while they joked about supper. Not while Teddy called him "daddy" like Lupin had never existed.
"And she verified my claim?"
Teddy huffed in agreement and in just a handful of moments they were back on the couch, just like they were last week, with Teddy at their heels and Malfoy at his side. The cat was a new addition, rubbing up against Teddy’s face as he stared as close as he can get before seeming to remember something and jump up on Malfoy’s lap. Teddy didn’t seem offended, just smug.
“Sorry ‘Mione,” Ron said, regretfully letting her go, “no time for long hello’s. It’s time.”
Teddy immediately went back to his work and Harry heard a coughing laugh from beside him. “He’s a little manipulator.”
Harry shook himself. "Can you give me their name?"
“Of course we have a television. Teddy’s friends, not to mention their parents, would assume I was some religious nut and depriving poor Teddy of all the luxuries the middle-class could offer.”
“What are you talking about?” Malfoy whispered, angling Teddy as far away from Harry as possible.
Harry sighed.
As he approached he could hear noises from inside, the clanking of dishes and muffled voices. That was good. They were home. No reason to dally.
“Oh, shut it.”
?” Harry read.
“Ah.” Malfoy nodded, suddenly calm. “So you’ve just come to terrorize me and my family then.”
The room he was steered into was no different. A kitchen opened up next to the entrance, white marble counters over blue cabinets. The sink was perched under the front facing window, adding plenty of natural light even with the dreary day. The kitchen flowed freely into the living room, television balanced in the corner with an earthy brown couch angled towards the glass. A bin full of colourful, plastic muggle toys sat next to the TV, looking haphazardly cleaned up.
“It’s time.”
Teddy did as he was told without a word of complaint, and the two of them migrated to the table where they were treated to the sight of a lovely Sunday roast.
is right here, Teddy.”
Harry almost rolled his eyes at the offense in Malfoy's tone, but was quickly distracted as Malfoy started trying to physically
“Hello,” she said, sinking into a low curtsy before rising swiftly, “may I approach?”
3. There will be no, uh, game of thrones-esque non-con or anything of the like, but there will be discussions around it so...
Frustration flared, mixing with his fear and almost,
"So courteous, Weasley." Malfoy sneered, "did Granger finally put you on a leash?”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Draco drolled despite his dry throat, “everyone? Hundreds of years of tradition? My
"This is Melinda's office address," she said, shakily getting to her feet. "She can get you a name."
Teddy twitched from where he’d been fiddling with the entertainment system and slowly turned around, eyes lowered and feet scuffing the ground.
Draco agreed with the sentiment, but quietly. They’d never worn such a ridiculous piece of clothing in his kingdom and for the life of him he couldn’t understand the appeal. The servants unclasped the fabrics from both of them, carefully folding them until little squares remained. Then, to Draco’s horror, all four of them turned on their heels left, with nothing but a quick bow to signal their leaving.
“Hey!” Teddy protested, but he had a distinctly mischievous grin which spoke to zero offense. Malfoy rolled his eyes and playfully kicked Teddy’s chair.
“Melinda?” Teddy squeaked. Malfoy pursed his lips, but Teddy continued. “Draco, he knows Melinda.”
Hermione pulled away shakily. “Well, if you insist on it…” Harry nodded. “Then you should finish getting ready.”
A thump came from upstairs, and Harry watched as Malfoy carefully cocked his head to listen further.
Potter’s hand tensed in a way Draco knew was made to help him rise to his feet. Draco rose under his own power.
“No occasion.” Draco said, folding his napkin on his lap. “Some people just have higher standards for mealtimes.”
Teddy coughed, drawing away from his arms to wipe his hands over his eyes. “Alright?” Draco asked wearily, keeping his arms outstretched.
Harry sighed, suddenly exhausted. The image of the fear in Teddy’s eyes as he saw Harry for the first time was cycling through his brain.  “Ask Melinda from the Child’s Interest division. She seemed to know you.”
“A loving reminder,” she said as she curtsied once again, “that a leopard can’t change its spots.”
A young woman approached wearing much darker colours than what was considered fashionable, but the more interesting thing was how Draco stiffened, giving his undivided attention for the first time that evening.
When Draco had been a teenage he’d suffered only one (horrific) conversation about keeping himself pure and how on his wedding night he would be expected to lead his new bride in consummation. It had frightened him then, the idea of being in control and have someone rely on him, but at least he could have at least
Harry bit back a sigh, watching as Draco turned once again to his mother and accept her hand on his arm with little fuss. Hilariously, Harry did the same when Ron pat his shoulder.
Snape stared off into the distance, humming in agreement. Harry hadn't ever seen either of them in their siren forms, or any sirens up close for that matter, and he felt a tinge of jealously that Hermione apparently had.
They were making their way back up towards the castle, unfortunately past the champions' tent, when she spotted them. Rita Skeeter, in all her sniveling glory, cut straight into their path.
"Why does it sound like you're only trying to convince me? Cassie?"
"If he can't breathe, isn't that the last thing we should be doing?" he retorted.
Snape paled, and Harry cheered internally. Caught in the act, then. The professor slowly stood to walk around the table to Draco. The two were talking in hushed whispers, until Snape looked over to Andrew with a strange look somewhere in between a glare and a plea.
Lupin never thought he would be in a position of such gratitude to the other man. He had successfully drawn the attention off of Lupin, for nothing if not the most basic of sympathies. Like the salivating dog that she was, Umbridge bit into the bone dangling in front of her.
"With all these uncertainties, there are few left that we can trust. But, Draco, I trust you with my life. I can only hope that you would trust yours with me. Dray, do you accept my offering for courtship?"
Andrew disappeared at some point, and returned much later with Cassie in tow, both of them smelling crisp of salt and brine. Cassie had come to kneel in front of him, gently removing the empty mug from his hands before speaking to him.
His voice sounded far away as he asked, "Why are we doing this? What's happening?"
Harry still felt like a puddle when Draco pulled apart from him, clear blue eyes taking him in with a shine brighter than the smile he was bearing.
Others had been automatically drawn to the windows as well, but some were examining other parts of the room. Looking over his shoulder, he could see Andrew over by one of three large fireplaces basking in its warmth. The wall space between the fireplaces consisted of expansive bookshelves. The floor was littered with cushions and plenty of cozy seating, the whole room coming together through a blue-green color scheme.
"It's about time that you and Harry had a talk, Draco."
"Pardon the interruption, but if the Ministry wants to know more about us, they need to prove they're not going to come and slaughter us all the second we're no longer beneficial to them. If you need a tidbit for your findings, here's something: Does the Ministry want to kiss our asses individually, or are they okay with just eating shit to compensate?"
"That's... that's bloody brilliant."
Andrew reappeared, a vial in his hands. He passed it off to Cassie, who carefully uncorked it before holding it out to Draco.
He let out a deep breath. His hands still trembled as they held the letter. Whatever words were inside, they were bad. Even if they weren't regarding his mother.
"I reckon the Ministry wants to feel more in control over the beasts that Dumbledore's so intent on letting in," Ron commented.
He laughed, this time with much less hysteria. "I don't think he will, to be frank."
The ground trembled, knocking them both into the nearest wall, Draco smacking his head against a marble pillar. The whole building shook with it, portraits and paintings running out of their frames as rubble and dust rained down from the ceiling.
Malfoy looked tired, barely glancing over at him. "Not now, Potter, I'm not in the mood."
Umbridge was proving to be quite the thorn in Draco's side. As she moved to push the sirens into submission, the more they pushed back against her until she finally snapped.
Perhaps what made it so difficult was the fact that Draco truly did care for him. Even if his heart was still caught up somewhere else, there was someone here right in front of him that guaranteed a life of security. Corey was a siren, meaning once the war nonsense was over they could hideaway within the safety of the Islands. His mother was here, likely would remain here for the rest of her life, and if Draco mated another siren she'd be ecstatic for him.
Alex, or whatever his bloody name was, was very attractive.
! The merpeople, for one, didn't want to be associated with vampires!"
Yet all he could focus on was the quick rise and fall of Draco's shoulders, stare into the depths of the colorless eyes. Feeling a surge of Gryffindor courage, he leaned forward to press their foreheads together.
Even worse, if the day came that Harry... That Harry no longer reciprocated Draco's feelings...
"You used your Song. The first few times can be a bit jarring before you learn to control it, as it comes out when you're afraid. It's okay, it's happened to all of us, you're not alone. You used Her gift, and there's nothing wrong with that."
His thoughts must've been too loud, as both of the older sirens turned their backs to him. Stripping quickly of his robes, he slid into the pool, his muscles tensing at the freezing temperatures.
Was his godfather trying to suppress a smirk as well? At least someone was amused at this hour. He should've just played dead in front of the fire.
Draco wouldn't be able to handle if Harry stayed by his side out of pity.
Andrew beamed.
Cassie had beat him to the punch. Run off to serve Voldemort because she knew he would die trying to protect her from him. He shouldn't have warned her. Shouldn't have tipped her off to what he was planning to do.
Honestly, why did Dumbledore look so surprised when Andrew started to threaten the old man within an inch of his life? Did he really think looking to Severus for help would get him anywhere? Just because he was immune to siren Songs didn't mean he wanted to interfere with one in progress. At least the Potter boy looked rightfully scared, he couldn't stand the hormonal tension that arose whenever Draco displayed even the slightest of his siren traits.
And thus had started his tumultuous journey with the pod of teenaged sirens. It was difficult to interact with them at first, their customs not even the exact opposite of Draco's. It was more like they were going by entirely different books, but theirs was in Ancient Greek and written both backwards and upside-down.
This is what would happen to him. Perhaps during the war, or perhaps later on in his life. He would be reduced to nothing but inconsolable grief as half his soul parted from him, his exposed heart bleeding from underneath the heel which crushed it. All it would take is a matter of measly minutes. It was that easy.
"Your mother called here, but you had left already. Let her rest, Dray. She's been learning aquaparition this week."
Cassie squinted her eyes at him. "You're overestimating how capable your friends think we are. Ron's still convinced the only thing we're good for is killing and/or brainwashing people."
It was growing dark again. Loud, like someone was screaming. He was screaming.
Her status as a siren had been revealed early on in the summer by Professor Snape at an Order meeting, along with the revelation that Cassie was his daughter. The latter wasn't surprising to Harry, as in that moment he remembered learning that tidbit many months ago yet somehow forgetting about it almost immediately after.
He shook his head. "You're not making sense, Cass-"
Oh. That's where he recognized it from, had seen Cassie make this formation once every few days as though the predictions would change.
That wasn't even considering the press attention that the Tournament brought. Rita Skeeter, in her obnoxiously bright outfits and her invasive disregard for others' privacy or personal space, made Draco consider bribing Cassie to use her Song and get the horrid reporter to have an untimely appointment with the Great Lake. It surely would do everyone else at Hogwarts a big favor.
He swam away in a panic. The longer he stayed there the risk of him doing something stupid once more increased. He sped through the water before the Merpeople's village was in sight. They would be able to smell him, even if they couldn't see him. Draco forced himself and his heart rate to slow down so they wouldn't mistake him for a threat.
Hopefully Granger would talk some sense into them. Loathe to admit it, but the girl was intelligent, and definitely the most sensible of the three. He hoped she didn't hold too much scorn for him and the way he had treated her these past few years. He'd apologize, but it would likely only make them more suspicious. Heaven forbid they discover he was projecting his fears of not being a true pure-blood onto a muggle-born. At that point, he'd gratefully turn himself in to the Ministry to be boiled alive.
Despite watching his memories over and over, the Aurors couldn't ask enough questions. It took Snape of all people to get them to finally back off, escorting Harry down to the Hospital Wing.
Being back at Hogwarts after months of being away was a strange experience for Draco. Cassie and him had port-keyed to Hogsmeade at midnight, moving in utter silence through the desolate village before meeting Severus at the gate. Both wore long cloaks with hoods that obscured their faces from view, but the second Cassie laid eyes on Severus she leapt at him, the hug nearly toppling them both to the ground.
"I'm sorry," Draco said, his voice trembling. They were all mad at him and it was all his fault. He couldn't handle it when people were mad at him.
At least the rumors were contained to just the Slytherins. Perks of being in the house with the united front; everyone rather keeping to their kind than risking the unreliability of the other three. Draco wondered briefly, what it would be like to be in his situation in any other house. The Ravenclaws seemed the type to see past the lies, capable enough to figure him out. The Hufflepuffs might be too dunder-headed to think much of his illness, more likely to try and smother him and annoy the living hell out of him.
Cassie's voice echoed through his head.
With his head still throbbing, he did not have much of a choice. He risked a peak to the other two, when a strained voice blared through the cemetery, turning Draco's blood ice cold and stopping his heart in its tracks.
The attacks on muggleborns had amplified throughout the UK. The death eaters were becoming a force to be reckoned with, and Dumbledore had confided in Harry that he found it likely they'd be taking the Ministry soon, especially considering the haunting visions he'd been having at night. Mr. Weasley's screams still echoed in his ears.
The pain. He reached a hand to the back of his head, where Cassie had smashed the vial. The moment his hand touched the cool liquid mixed with his boiling blood, he felt Her. She would protect him, keep him calm. He wasn't alone.
Draco splashed some water at him. "Says the guy who knocked a river rat off his broom at
The shadow people were gone, but they had left behind an accomplice. This shadow was different than them. Like a cobra, its color a violent red; the red you see in a lightning storm, that dramatic flash right before lightning strikes, the red you see when you squeeze your eyes so tight you see stars.
Snape nodded to affirm what she said, but added, "Humans will only be left with a faint scar afterwards. I've been told they stand out quite clearly to other sirens to the point that they can see it under layers of clothes, but they have not elaborated past that. In his human form, Draco will have a similar scar, but in his siren form the scale removed and then replaced will be the same color as your magical core."
He had noticed that most of those that resided underneath scopuli were Moonbeams and Tomb sirens, but hadn't paid too much mind to it. In all honesty, the idea of sirens living separated by species was an idea novel to him. But here, pods lived in permanent settlements. Traveling pods were more likely to be diverse with their safety relying on numbers.
Andrew raised his hand, all eyes turning in his direction. "I had left to get Cassie when Potter had started taunting Draco about his illness, and when we got back a fight had broken out between Potter and Draco. Moody had tried to hex Draco, but Cassie stepped in, knowing that magic is already straining enough on him. Who knows what could've happened had he been successfully hit, on top of everything else he's battling..."
"Eternally grateful, the girl never left Her side, and She was never lonely again. Her sirens were the living proof of Her love, and carried the power of Her wrath within them, a promise to all those who would threaten them."
That was over an hour ago. It was the middle of the night, and Draco wasn't even sure if Harry would return here or spend the night in the Gryffindor dormitory so he could walk with his friends to breakfast. He'd only done in once in the past four days, but even Draco would admit that his dorms were much farther a walk from the Headmaster's office. The smart move would not be to waste time trekking all the way here if one was bone-tired.
It was almost a one hundred percent guarantee that Corey had already asked her for her permission.
While they were all users of magic, none had wands. They wore muggle clothing and played muggle games and did things the muggle way. It was mind-blowing to watch how different the two worlds were.
"Can I help you?" Cassie drawled out, her sickly sweet tone paired with sharp eyes that sent a shiver down Draco's achy spine.
Another squeeze. "That's okay too."
Draco's face might've drained of all color if he wasn't so pale. "We barely understand the prophecy as is, how could you let them be so reckless?"
Another voice shouted out the killing curse, and Cassie leapt out from her hiding place to let out a blood-curdling scream that created a bubble-type shield for the killing curse to ricochet off of, striking the ground and leaving a scorched patch of grass. Still loopy, he watched Cassie lunge for Diggory and the Cup, all three vanishing with a
Now that was an idea.
overheard my conversation with Professor Snape regarding your 'return from St. Mungo's', and already the entirety of Slytherin knows about your debilitating illness that's been ailing you since the end of last year. Do you know how much shit I could start with a gossip chain this efficient?"
Draco stayed hidden in his room for the first ten minutes of Granger's visit. He could hear the two girls talking through his now closed door, which he now stared at intently. He wasn't building up courage to open it, that would be preposterous. He simply doubted his company would be enjoyed, and he'd rather not sit through an awkward silence.
Not even Narcissa thought to seek him out. When he heard what she'd asked of Corey, he wanted to laugh. Corey, as nice as he was, was nothing like Harry Potter. Even if he was, Draco had his eyes set on the Gryffindor boy long before Andrew came into the picture. He didn't even need to consult with Cass to confirm his theory. Draco showed his hand without even trying to hide it.
Draco tucked his head into Andrew's shoulder in hopes to hide himself away. He hated how much he had come to rely on his cousin's vehement presence at his side. Although, he supposed his magic had grown used to counterbalancing hers. He could almost feel it now, bundling him in a tight embrace, like the way his mother had when he was young and scared. It was crushing him, squeezing the air out of his lungs. As his vision grew spotty, Draco imagined he was in the deep trenches of the Atlantic.
The door creaked open, the high-pitched whine drawing the room's attention. It was one of St. Achelous' professors, but Draco couldn't remember their name. Perhaps she was the Potions Master?
Draco gulped. "You didn't answer me."
Cassie grinned like the maniac that she was, and Draco shoved her, starting a wrestling match that left them both breathlessly cackling like hyenas laid out on the sandy beach. He didn't even care that he was going to have sand coming out of his hair and ears for the next few days because of this. For once, he didn't have to be afraid to be himself, and he'd never felt freer.
Andrew pushed on. "What could you say that would be worse than 'snog?'"
That had been the curse that had wiped out the sirens during the Great Hunt. Only wizards could cast it, and only wizards could reverse it. Draco shuddered at the thought; didn't want to imagine how excruciating it must be to drown on air.
Draco ducked his head into her shoulder, peeking at Harry with one eye.
' You'd think the Goblet would have better security. Like a blood oath! If anyone can write another person's name and bind them to a contract, especially in this case a minor, and I bet your ass it wasn't his legal guardian that signed him up for this! It should be spelled to bind the person who wrote the name, not the owner of the name itself! What if Potter legally changed his name? Would he still be bound?"
At that point, you hadn't looked for the signs fast enough.
"Why you insolent little-"
The porch door opened, letting in the warm ocean breeze. It was Corey, hair still dripping wet from the water, carrying a crate of potion ingredients for Andrew.
"I just meant, um, that we... That I won't be able to see your face. I rather enjoy looking at it."
"Oh! Of course!" It was a Muggle thing, then. "Hold out your pinky."
He turned to look at his companion, and tilted his head with a raised brow.
They kept on that way for a minute before letting the note fade. Draco's eyelids now drooped with exhaustion, grey eyes still unfocused and distant, his upper body swaying with the threat of giving out at any moment. Harry had to lunge forward to catch him in time so he wouldn't hit his head on the floor, letting out a grunt as Draco's deadweight hit him full-force.
She shrugged. "Why not? He's super fishy, radiates bad vibes, and could easily get past the age line."
"Come in, then!" Cassie splashed the newcomer, which Draco took as his cue to begin moving towards the ledge occupied by a stack of large, fluffy towels and hurriedly climbing out and wrapping himself in one.
Dumbledore butt in, "Like the majority of Hogwarts staff and students, she believes you suffer from an ailment most severe. Your godfather's daughter helping care for you is not the most suspicious thing to be witnessed by the Castle's walls."
"You're not going," Snape stated.
He shot up from his seat, blinking away the stinging in his eyes. "How can She ask this of you? She's risking you, your life! What about Andrew? What about me? We need you!"
"What, afraid now that Cassie's not here to fight your battles?"
"Are you going to teach me how to do that?"
His eyelids were lead weights that he could not hold up any longer.
Moody's face had fallen flat. He seemed as if he accepted this losing battle, in a room where he had no allies. Not even Potter, who had some sort of weird attachment to the Auror.
They were there to gain the Ministry's trust. Not to prove the point
Andy sucked in a breath like he'd been punched in the gut. "Right. She's, well, she's not here right now, so I'll have to suffice until she gets back, okay?"
"I'll take your place, let me take your place," he bartered, and she hugged him with renewed vigor.
"It's so painful because they take root in your vertebrae, and there's a fair amount of nerves bundled up there. It isn't so bad once they're established and break through the skin, but it's going to be a few days before they get to that point." Her words made sense, but his head felt cloudy.
"Alright." She looked at the others. "No polyjuice. Let's roll."
Now, he was in an even bigger mess.
"Some nerve telling me to get ahold of myself when you're just as far gone as me."
Draco was torn from unconsciousness by a brilliant light, so bright he felt as though he had been staring into the sun despite his eyelids being clenched shut. He could feel his heartbeat in the relentless throb in his head, worsened by the shouting-
The floor-length fishtail dress was reminiscent of her siren form. It was the same deep black of her scales; the kind of black that was not an absence of color, but one that appeared to devour its surrounding light, forcing your attention to the wearer. Unlike the blinding sun that stunned you upon first glance, she was the polar opposite of brightness, drawing your eyes to her like a black hole pulling you in.
He wouldn't have to wait very long to see.
He looked to Andrew. "Any idea what that was all about?"
Upon returning to his quarters, Draco found Cassie splayed across the couch in muggle clothing, dead asleep. In front of her, the coffee table had been magicked into a lab station. A cauldron simmering with a navy blue concoction inside sat atop it, giving off a slight peach smell.
It was no secret what they were. Every bystander around them knew. The goblins could easily sell them out, a proper repeat for history's sake. Or one of his loyal followers could be tipped off, sending him straight to their doorstep.
He did his best to find his footing and support as much as himself as he could, but she was moving too fast for him. It was better for the both of them if he let himself be pseudo-dragged out of here. For one, it was faster than him trying to play catch-up. Two, Cassie was an impatient bastard who didn't care if he wanted to attempt to save the last shred of his dignity.
He continued to stare blankly at her. Quite honestly, he expected her to try and smack him for his ignorance.
"It's time," she said, the finality in her tone sending a shiver down his spine. He took the vial from her, bracing himself as he downed it in one go.
"Your mother asked me to begin planning your death."
The rest of the adults shared looks of conspiracy, but Sirius and Nymphadora seemed confused.
Draco shrugged, adding, "That was still better than that debate we had over landing face-first into a pile of shit versus a puddle of stinky urine."
He did as she asked, and she began rambling off about the legacy of Rowena Ravenclaw. He was never going to take her for granted ever again, bless her heart.
To be fair, that was the very reason why he hadn't been allowed to patrol with his cousin that afternoon. Turning it into a game had added a lot more entertainment into the chore, neither could be blamed for that.
"I never took my cloak down!" he tried to defend.
It helped that the other sirens were there to support him unconditionally. He thought he might actually become unhinged without their comforting presence. It was while he was cuddled into Corey's side that he asked Andrew to tell him the story of the First Siren one more time, a tale that helped him come to peace with his actions.
To see the effects of that fear in his cousin now, he understood the gravity of his own circumstances. How he was exposing his beating heart to a human, someone who could go and love someone else more than he loved Draco, someone who remained whole even if Draco were to perish. It wasn't the first time he had confronted this particular insecurity, but it hadn't ever felt this real. This... applicable, to his own life.
"Draco?"
"And when she refuses to do it?"
"Corey will understand. Not all courtships lead to fruition. The whole point of them is to discover what you're looking for in a mate. But you need to talk to him, right away. He doesn't love you yet. You can't let it get that far."
"The five types of sirens are Sea Devil, Sea Demon or Hellfire, Moonbeam, Sounding Tomb Siren, and Nightingale," she supplied, putting an emphasis on her know-it-all voice.
Her face hardened. She made no move to look in his direction and pushed herself up to a sitting position. He followed automatically, trembling with nerves.
Draco was surprised at the lack of jealously in the statement, instead reading off a wave of protectiveness. It made Draco feel queasy.
Blaise raised an eyebrow, his lip quirking. "I am not."
"Harry." Now her look had evolved to one of pity, like he was the dumbest person she had ever come across. "He's ill. I've been to his quarters, and there have been times when I've visited with Cassie and he's looked truly awful. He's in pain, Harry. I don't know why that's so hard for you to understand. And, really? Spying on him with the Marauder's Map? If he was in Dumbledore's office with his Head of House, they were likely talking about something of personal matters. Which, is none of your business, and frankly if you keep this behavior up I'll have no choice but to burn that bloody map and lock away that stupid cloak-"
to protect you, no matter what."
He almost felt a tad jealous that he hadn't been the one to kill her. But he didn't have the same flame of vengeance buried inside him like his cousin did. He couldn't have made her death quite as agonizing or drawn-out.
with Professor Moody, Dumbledore has decided it may be wiser to trust two magical creatures to oversee an abundance of other magical creatures."
Cassie looked up at Draco like she hadn't expected that reaction out of him. Her mouth stuffed comically full, he had to wait for her to finish chewing for a solid twenty seconds before she was able to speak again.
He couldn't stomach seeing anything more. He turned his head, silently pleading for Cassie to take them away, and she did. In a blink they were both standing at the edge of the Black Lake, far far away from the crowd that would quickly learn of the looming threat over all of them.
"I am beginning to believe your suspicions regarding Alastor Moody may have some merit."
"Cass, I am happy, it's not your job to try and make my life perfect. Worry about your own happiness."
He smelled blood. It was fresh, the scent of iron burning his nostrils. It smelled foreign enough for Draco to know it wasn't his. He took a deep inhale.
The rest of the day went similarly. It was easier to focus in the other classes thanks to the absence of one very unsettling professor, but as the day grew on he could feel his soaked shirt clinging to his skin. Instead of the material brushing against the wounds with each movement, it stuck against it, the fabric dragging. If was though every time he breathed he felt like scabs were being peeled off, the wound reopening. It reminded him much of wet paper, the way it was stubborn to disobey his wills and desires, everything getting much worse as he tried to remedy the situation.
They were inside the castle now, almost to their shared quarters. "That isn't fair! What if one siren manipulates someone to get at another siren?"
"Hermione, you've met my cousin Draco, so sorry if he's been a real sod to you in the past." Cassie shoved him forward like the petulant child that she was, and Draco wished he'd made up an excuse about his gills still hurting.
"One of these days I'm going to poison your pie. You'll rue the day you ever decided to harass all the bones in my body."
Severus didn't need to vocalize that she'd have to get in line given the murderous rage threatening to boil over at any point. He despised another unpredictable variable being added into the mix. Yet, he could see why Aegeus had done what he did. The prophecy guaranteed that they wouldn't die until the war was at its peak as they'd have to play a direct role in the defeat of Voldemort. Nightingales were also the only sirens to form dependency bonds that allowed them to tap into another's magical core--even if it was (normally) only when a pair were in close proximity to each other. Plus, Draco and Cassie shared a birthright prophecy and were bound by blood; if you were to test the limits of the hunting bonds then you would want your subjects to already have a strong connection.
"I, well-" Harry cleared his throat, "I just don't think it's that surprising, that Cassie went and became a Death Eater. Snape was one, for all we know, he still is one. She could've been spying on us this entire time."
"What is it that you wish me to do?"
Narcissa gave him a grim smile he couldn't see as she continued in her explanation.
His vision was spotty, black dots flashing in and out of existence. He hadn't been spotted. He knew as much when they grabbed Potter and made no move in his direction, dragging off the boy-who-lived to some statue in the near distance. Lifting his shaking hands, he made the sign formation for a cloaking spell, allowing himself to camouflage into his surroundings as the world around him went dark.
He turned to look at her, but she'd closed her eyes, slouched against him where their bodies were pressed together. If this was going feral, just like falling asleep, then how bad could it really be?
Andrew's hands were digging at the gills on his neck, and Draco realized they were bleeding. Cassie's hands quickly covered her mate's, frantically muttering any healing spell she could think of. It didn't appear to have any impact as Andrew kept choking, a horrid sound of agony.
Cassie looked up from her pebbles, a glint in her eye that could only mean trouble.
She hummed, an obvious 'no.' The darned thing had been mostly gossip the past few weeks, pointedly about Hermione and Potter's speculated love lives, which made Draco uncomfortable on many levels. They were both children for Merlin's sake, it seemed borderline predatory to be so invested in their romantic relationships. Then again, Rita Skeeter was not a prime example of a model witch. Perhaps he should have convinced Cassie to take her out at the First Task, it would have been a great service for the whole country.
Not being sorted into Gryffindor for nothing, Harry leaned in the rest of the way, pressing his lips to Draco's with a tentative softness. He lifted a hand up to caress the blond's cheek, and ended up with a hand fisting the hair at the nape of his neck while Draco pressed further into him. It grew progressively heated in a manner of seconds, Draco swinging a leg over Harry's so he was sitting on the latter's thighs, Harry feeling dizzy from the rush of adrenaline that coursed through him.
Soon. Once he had his tail, and could out-swim even the fastest of grindylows or kelpies. When he would be just a hair's breadth away from full maturity.
The idiot stepped forward, a hand suspended in the air like he was going to try and comfort Draco. It was ridiculous how soon the fear had drained from his eyes, the self-preservation instinct absent. Bloody Gryffindors.
Turning back, he found Severus with an empty vial of Sleeping Draught in his hand, Andrew gingerly adjusting a sleeping Cassie so he could stand them up. Draco rushed to help him find his feet, Severus scooping up Cassie as Andrew swayed back-and-forth.
Someone tucked their arm into his elbow, guiding him out of the Great Hall with gentle steps. His chest rattled as he sucked in air, and Hermione helped lower him to the ground, sitting beside him as he cried.
He internally pleaded that she wouldn't say exactly what he knew she-
She had reached their side of the room, and had paused mid-stride upon looking at his table. Draco willed himself not to look up, to pretend that he hadn't noticed. He really did not want to deal with the headache that would come from unnecessarily interacting with her.
He broke into a dead sprint, letting go of Cassie and not bothering to waste time looking back to see if she would follow. She did, gaining on him as she caught on to what Draco had said. The maze had obscured them from being detected by Diggory and Potter, but as they ran towards them the vines shielding them curled away, as if they had caught on that bigger things were afoot.
He floated with zero effort. Attempting to move around was... baby steps, 'slow and steady,' he told himself. He shifted his tail, thinking about using the same muscles one would to shift your weight from one foot, but all it did was throw him off kilter. His tail was so much longer than his legs, didn't cooperate in the same way as these muscles were different. Like having a completely different set of limbs nothing like either his arms or legs.
“Well, you do.” Teddy said, nodding. “Three times a week when I’m at school.”
Harry did want them, but was more blown away that Malfoy would so easily offer such a thing to him.
Draco’s neck snapped with how quickly he turned. “Excuse me?” he asked, the words finding a horrific meaning in his skull.
Harry didn’t know this person.
Made of pure gold, the crown spun a modest height with poised and angular points that resembled a stag’s antlers. The peaks pointed forward, twisting along the circle of the crown to gather at the front where some peaks twisted up like they were ready to skewer and enemy, while others just twisted, creating a nest-like center where it hosted a large blood-red jewel.
A few dozen galleons lighter Harry had a fancy new mobile and a rather terse conversation with the only wizard who uses mobiles (somehow that wizard was Draco Malfoy) and he’d set up plans for another supper for the coming Saturday. Maybe he should bring something? Damn, should he have brought something last time? Malfoy had said he’d cooked everything though, and he seemed like the type to be particular about what, uh,
"Is someone going to explain why I'm here?" Draco rested his head against the back of the chair. "With this numbing potion in my system there is not much keeping me from falling asleep right here."
The bastard didn't even seem that guilty at being caught as he pulled back and turned to them, Cassie rumbling a low growl of displeasure.
Draco had fallen a few steps behind Cassie from getting distracted at the sights around him. Not that either of them were in much of a hurry to get anywhere. Cass must have noticed, as she stopped, her slate grey toga ruffled by the soft winds. Her dark hair tousled around, some strands wrapping around her face as she turned to look at Draco. The sun here had changed her complexion, the once pale skin now a light olive, her near black hair sun-bleached to a golden brown.
Cass' face didn't hold any heat to it as she examined Draco from where she sat. Severus opened his mouth to continue his tirade, but she held a hand out for him to stop. The scrutiny in her eyes made him wish he'd combust on the spot and not have to confront whatever accusation she was about to lay down.
"You need to be bonded, before the Dark Lord comes for you, and for fuck's sake, Draco!" Andrew gripped his hair like he was on the verge of pulling it out, "You're going feral! If Harry hadn't been back there in the Hall, what do you think Dumbledore would've done? Do you really think he's so tolerant as to've let you keep on like that? We're only pawns to him, and a feral siren is beyond anyone's control! We mean nothing to him!"
They'd stand a chance in this war.
Snape sat directly across from him on Cassie's bed. "They can't. Think about a pack of wolves howling. Similar concept."
He gulped. "Yes, Professor, I understand."
Something awful began to fill the air, and if he had anything left in him, he would've puked again. Cassie was brandishing the open aluminum tin full of compost, letting the rotten smell permeate into the room. Someone coughed from over by the fireplace, and Cassie and Andrew leapt towards the source of the noise.
Andrew was 'jumping leagues,' a skill where he would swim straight at an obstacle--whether that be a rock or a cluster of weeds--and vanish right before colliding with it, appearing again a good distance away that he logically couldn't have swam to based off of trajectories. It was a skill more advanced than portal creation, where water would swirl into a physical portal that could transport you into any body of water anywhere, as it involved illusive evasion that required blind trust in Her. With a portal, you had a destination in mind. With league jumping, you had to trust Her to prevent any collisions and also trust she would transport you safely out of harm's reach.
"Look, Dray, you're front page news."
He must had started dissociating, as he found himself being supported by Cassie and Andrew while being led down one of the moving staircases. He didn't remember anything else that had happened in Dumbledore's office. He had no idea when they had left, getting to this part of the castle.
He closed it, but held it on his lap instead of setting it aside. "It says that sirens almost never get sick."
"I only requested the presence of Mr. Malfoy," Crouch said, as though he were accusing someone--Dumbledore? Snape?--of something.
"Let me show you to your room, Draco. Once you're settled I'll bring you to meet the others."
Draco could hear the blood rushing through his head. "Is it really that dangerous out there, for us?"
Draco pressed a palm to the window. He was itching for a swim right about now.
All he got in return was three blank stares.
Cassie snorted, audible enough for those nearby to startle at the sudden noise. Why was everyone so quiet? Surely-
you know," his mother did not fail to remind him, "and he would appreciate it very much if you began to use it."
Draco nodded, smiling back, avoiding Cassie's eyes burning into the back of his head. He could already hear her voice and what she wanted to say to him:
She looked quite hesitant to interact with him. Bloody hell, she probably thought he was an irredeemable asshole.
Draco detested everyone being privy to his business. His safety be damned, he'd like some privacy as well, thank you very much.
Fuck.
At this point, Harry wasn't even sure that it was answers. Just the slightest of hints, anything to explain her betrayal. Seeing as she was literally Snape's daughter, Harry wasn't sure why they even bothered to excuse her actions. The apple didn't fall far from the tree, and all that...
She mouthed,
He closed his eyes. His life was cursed, there was no other explanation. Perhaps, this was karma for all the years he was an intolerable git to so many people around him. His life was not destined to be fair, he had been born to stay in the shadows. He was not meant to know the light, especially not one as bright as Harry Potter.
Andy laughed at the incredulous look on Draco's face. "It's a nourishing potion for aquatic plants. When you pick them and move them to a tank to be stored, they need this potion to keep their properties nice and potent. Basically, a potion to keep future potion ingredients good while they're being stored."
"I know. I know. I suppose it is comforting, on some level, to know he will be there for her no matter what your prophecy implicates."
that Draco will try to claw or bite you when you place the scale, but it shouldn't hurt."
So, yes, sue him for deciding that he wasn't going to just sit there and let things happen. Prophecies were vague as hell, which meant that all the actors behind the scenes would easily go unnoticed. No one even thought to tell him to keep his nose out of it, because they all assumed that Cassie would be the one to get in the proverbial way.
He shrugged his shoulders. Seeing as they weren't sirens, he had no other way of communicating with them down here.
"Wait, Malfoy!" Potter called after him. "It's true?"
He found his date, her sister, and Ron sitting at a table. All had their arms crossed, and the twins were glaring at Ron (and, now, Harry by proxy).
Draco wanted to roll his eyes at the unexpected audience that greeted them inside and barely managed to restrain himself. He allowed Cassie to manhandle him into a chair, with her sitting atop one of the arms like a crow perched on a castle spire. She leveled her gaze at Barty Crouch Sr. and Ludo Bagman.
He could feel Harry standing right behind him, hovering with worry and with a comforting hand resting on his lower back. Draco leaned into the pressure as Andrew forced himself to calm his quick breathing to explain what was the matter. It was only then that Draco realized he was sopping wet from head-to-toe.
Corey released a strained laugh which he then tried to conceal with a cough. He was focused on something in his hands, fiddling with it before he continued.
"I know you're up to something, Malfoy." His hand automatically reached into his pocket to tighten around his wand.
"He's evil, Hermione, just like his family. He was in Dumbledore's office last night with Snape and his cousin and someone else whose name I didn't recognize, and when I followed them they didn't go back to the Slytherin dorms! He has his own quarters that aren't even attached to the dorms-"
She was muttering to herself as she moved them forwards; further proof of her annoyance.
He followed his friend's line of vision, and it wasn't hard to deduce what it was he was supposed to see.
Draco looked back, feeling like this all must be a prank at this point.
"Oh?" Ron was an inch away from shoving his foot into his mouth. "And, who told you that? Your siren friend?"
He looked at the other boy, feigning an air of nonchalance as he kept his face composed. It was his only choice, with twelve sirens' immediate attention falling on him. Corey was right there, too. Draco couldn't risk sabotaging that.
"Free? Then how do they make a profit?"
Cassandra was beautiful, even in the beat up state she came to him in. The Dark Lord had been trying to collect as many living sirens as possible, but there were more deaths than actual captives as they viciously evaded capture. Although Severus was not a healer, his aptitude for potions had been sufficient enough to land him the job as the designated caretaker for the five sirens kept locked away in the dingy prison cells in an underground cavern in northern Scotland.
The first Triwizard task was dragons. No wonder the tournament had a history of its champions dying, with how they let actual children compete against each other.
The lake was... nothing like Draco would've expected. He thought the water would be dark and grimy closer to the bottom, his vision obscured by weeds. Yet, he could see all the minor details with a shocking amount of clarity. Although the sunlight from the surface didn't reach this far down he was still able to make out all the figures in the dark. What he couldn't see in the distance, he could smell. The Grindylows burrowed in the weeds, a small school of fish on the other side of a rock to his right...
Snape did his best to school his expression, waited for the other father in the room to say the words first.
He shoved her off with a laugh. "At least you're not my post-humorous wife?"
The guilt swirling in his gut told him that Ron had a point. He hadn't been the greatest friend lately, but he couldn't help it! The only times he got to see Draco were outside of class, as the sirens didn't share their classes with any of the other houses. Sometimes they didn't even attend shared meals, and took them in their common room at random, Harry couldn't find any consistency to their schedules.
"What are you on about, Potter? It's not like you care, we're not even friends."
Andrew huffed. "That was my suggestion three days ago, if you've forgotten."
Merlin, this was going to be a long night. It was just sticks, it wasn't that exciting!
"It's just a term we use for unstable sirens. Nightingales are most sensitive to becoming unstable, because our magic is regulated by the moon, but any siren can get that way if there's a perceived threat great enough. Like, if Cassie saw someone flirting with Andrew, she could go feral just because their bond was recently threatened. Honestly, though, she's probably just being overly protective. This whole week she's been acting like he's going off to war on another continent."
He wondered whether or not he should feel more ashamed at the swirling in his stomach at the idea of seeing Draco that way. From the look Cassie was giving him, she seemed attuned to the path his thoughts were following.
Cassie smiled, soft and maudlin. "He gave me ocean jasper. It represents bringing love into your life, but also empathy and responsibility. He told me that he admired my strength, but even more so that I trusted him with my vulnerabilities. He hoped to bring out those qualities in him, to see the best of himself reflected within me."
Remus Lupin found Dolores Umbridge to be his least favorite kind of person: Power-hungry, entitled, and (to put it simply) devoid of basic empathy.
"I'm not going to- It's not worth it."
"Miss Prince, perhaps with some
This damn castle really was not that accessible to anyone with a disability. He'd have to bring up that particular concern to his father some other time.
"As you already know, sirens are more respected than half-giants among magical creatures. Not even veela are a match to your kind."
The breath many were holding was released, pleased with the results of the prophecy. Evil was on the horizon, but hope followed in its shadow.
to you or anything like that, but as you get older-"
His cousin smiled at him, but it was nowhere near reaching her eyes. Eyes that were sad. Resigned.
She turned away from him to look back towards the sky. The smile had left her face, and even at side-glance Draco could tell that he wasn't meant to see the look in her eyes. He'd seen it more than enough times all year, knew it had to do with what they had discussed all those weeks ago in Severus' office.
The words washed over him like a bucket of freezing water. Had it been a year prior, those words would have elicited a scoff of disbelief, a laugh at the incredulity of it all.
Harry sucked in a breath. Did she know who she was speaking to?
"It's like, it's..." Harry finally looked up to bore into his eyes. "It's pure. It's like when you have to cast a spell in front of the whole class, and you're thinking about making a fool of yourself in front of them, and worrying about having food in your teeth or your robes on backwards. But when you're in that state, there's none of that. It's just your emotions, stronger than ever, and your mind is clear. Like what it feels like after a fresh kill, or in the dead calm of night when the only sound is the crash of waves."
“Can we watch the film again, Draco?” Teddy asked, clasping his hands behind his back and staring at Malfoy from behind his eyelashes.
It was all…entirely too domestic. Harry had gone in with zero expectations and yet still he found them subverted. Draco Malfoy took muggle cooking classes. The majority of Teddy’s friends were muggle. He played with little plastic men and casually shifted his hair to match the cowboy figurine without even noticing it.
"And living in a muggle neighborhood?"
“No, he’s right. It does make me feel better.” Harry shot her a grin. “You know how terribly superficial I am.”
Andromeda narrowed her eyes. "I did. I sent you all the information. Years ago."
“In the witness of my allies and my people, I bind myself to thee, Draco Malfoy, and give you my name and my house in offering. I so swear to honour you as my first and only husband, to serve you as a husband should, and to protect you with all the might I carry within my breast. To these things, I swear.”
. The thought of showing any bit of weakness, any bit of vulnerability to the person who'd broken his nose or let death eaters into Hogwarts or tried to kill Dumbledore, well, it was impossible.
Where Draco had iron clasps, Potter had gold. And gold. And more gold. Gold bands, gold in his hair, gold crown. His outfit was almost a mirror image to Draco’s but it had been completely over-exaggerated, with more elaborate designs in the embroidery and baubles hanging off the tunic. His cape was entirely red to Draco’s white, and the phoenix design white and gold to contrast.
The banquet was held outside, something done against tradition but the ballroom was still in disrepair. The head table was one long horseshoe-like table where Harry sat right in the center. It surrounded a vast swath of polished wood flooring, obscuring the grass beneath it and acting as a makeshift dance floor. Two separate bands were hired to perform, one reasonably close to the head table and the other much farther down, beyond the wooden dance floor to a wide open area of just grass where the common-folk danced. Though Harry hated the segregated set-up on principle, there was no rule enforced whether peasants could dance on the wooden floor or vice-versa, it was just how things seemed to work out.
, of all bloody moments, was not the time to campaign for his husband’s attention. They hadn’t slept together yet. Draco might hate the act all-together and be glad to have the nightly ritual erased from his social calendar. In fact he
upbringing for his godson, even if the circumstances around it continued to leave him distressed and ashamed.
“Teddy’s upstairs.” Malfoy explained, shooting him a dirty look for the language. He then raised his voice to a shout. “I’m sure he’ll be down soon! Like he promised!”
Teddy set his jaw. “Harry Potter is a hero. You’re a bully.”
, Draco thought as he made his way up the podium, only to think it again when Potter extended his hand for him to take.
The shadow jerked, and Draco flinched.
“Are you tired now?” Draco asked.
"Get out!" Malfoy shrieked, "I didn't give you permission to enter!"
Respectful silence followed the end of the old man’s speech and for the first time Draco let himself meet Potter’s eyes, both of them sharing an understanding that they were to speak next.
Harry thought, tensing in his seat. If Malfoy didn’t like it he could take it up with him.
him. I’m sure those infernal books would have told you to talk to him.”
Melinda, as Harry had learned, was Andromeda's longtime friend who worked in the Children's Interest division at the ministry. The majority of the division was just tracking underage magic, something Harry bitterly found out himself after certain revelations about his own childhood, but there was a branch that helped relocate children and worked with private orphanages.
"Draco Malfoy?" He asked Marge. Again, absurdly, she nodded. "The Draco Malfoy who was a death eater? Who lived with Voldemort for months?” Harry said wryly, “That Malfoy?”
“No! He’s been over three times! I didn’t forget the first time!” Teddy yelled, slamming his free fist down on the bed.
unprepared for the reality that Teddy was in a loving home, after seeing Malfoy’s family. Truthfully he’d been expecting Narcissa to be about, but she hadn’t been even mentioned once.
he got professional help. Ginny had kept her distance after their relationship fell apart, but the day she finally chose to see him was the same day she'd marched right back out and found him a mind healer.
“I wasn’t going to
But to say such a thing to Malfoy...would be impossible. Malfoy may have surprised him, may be just midly more restrained with his tongue and may go gallivanting to muggle markets to buy his food but he was still
With every inch the sun disappeared behind the horizon Draco tensed, growing steadily stiffer until he was practically jittering with nervous energy.  His mother was doing everything she could to calm him down but her comforting gestures only made what came next more real, more pressing. It almost felt like she was grieving.
Harry sighed, closing the door and sealing the room off once more. When he'd returned from Malfoy's the previous night, angry and confused and full of such impossible thoughts he thought his head would cave in, he'd marched right into this room desperate to find Andromeda's letter. It was only the reality of how long such a thing would take that sent him to bed. He'd had to be up in the morning.
Alarm flared in Draco and he cursed himself for not taking the out when it was presented, for
“I suppose,” Harry said sadly, “that if you came to bed expecting violence, a knife wouldn’t exactly be the worst thing to bring.”
The issue with Potter is that he has literally no awareness about the state of the wizarding world and how Draco's situation, his entire life, would look when it was splashed across the papers. Whatever Potter’s issues were post war that kept him away from the society pages were not unnoticed, and his glorious return to becoming an auror had been the only thing talked about for
Teddy grumbled under his breath but climbed into bed without fuss. The fussing came when Draco got up to leave.
Inadequate, that’s how Draco felt next to such pageantry. Understated.
Ron and Hermione had tried to pull him out of it - of course they had - but he'd turned to stone, just letting the years wear him away because there was nothing else he could do. He was stone, he couldn't move, he couldn't feel. He just was.
Draco frowned. “
to come over so much?”
Giving his friend a complicated yet begging look, Ron rolled his eyes to the sky. “The things you get up to.” But, well, Ron had matured a great deal more than Harry in the last few years because with a lazy salute and a dazzling grin at Malfoy (which had Malfoy shifting uncomfortably, as was obviously the intention) he was out the door.
Harry scowled but waved him on. Receiving wedding gifts was the absolute worst part of this whole affair. Harry had called for a break at least twice already, and the sun was going down. No wonder his court marshal was stressed.
Harry also blushed. “I…” but Draco was already moving. After all, he had been spurred into action, hadn’t he?
Brown parcels tied together and stacked on top of each other leaned in precarious towers around the shabby room. Letters in freely falling mountains claim each corner and a sea of parchment falls in between them. White, beige, and grey paper and parchment completely cover the drab colour of the carpet, with a fair bit of pink envelopes Harry dare not touch. The pile was worse than he thought.
Draco was a bad person.
“You should have seen it, mate.” Ron rolled his eyes then pressed a hand to his head in a dramatic fashion. “Oh, our king,” he said in a pitched voice, “so noble, so gallant is he. His words bring tears to the eyes of even the coldest men!”
he’d want with his cooking (and honestly the sheer idea that Malfoy was out there cooking the muggle way was still too senseless to fully process). Maybe he should bring something for Teddy? A toy? What kind of toy would he want, but not have? Malfoy seemed like the doting type after all. Should he just call Malfoy again? Er, well no that doesn’t sound like a lovely idea. Still, he wanted to bring something.
“Oh, ‘Mione, please,” he begged, but he could tell the gesture was genuine and not just a tease. It was so much harder to deal with the emotion rising in his throat when she was earnest like this.
Malfoy rolled his eyes but grabbed the offered hand, holding onto the railing and helping the little boy down the stairs of the stoop.
“I witness the binding,” the old man spoke, “and I declare it true.” At his words Draco and Potter reached out for each other’s hands once more, the small chain of fabric sagging beneath their clasped hands.
Teddy grumbled and peeked out at her, looking much too disgruntled for a baby. He coughed and a spit bubble formed at the corner of his mouth which the woman wiped away. The baby seemed to take offense to the action, affronted with narrowed eyes.
Before Malfoy had said such a thing the idea that he could have still been involved with criminal activity had never entered Harry’s mind, but the thought made a new sickness burn his stomach. He’d have to look up Malfoy’s file when he got back to work.
Severus took a tentative step forward, indecision clouding his eyes before they cleared and he strode forward to engulf Cassie in a hug.
It was something, however, that Draco had quickly learned to accept. After the Great Hunt in 1513 (and the subsequent follow-up in the 1940's), the sirens had hidden among the muggle folk to stay alive. By hiding in plain sight, they had made it thus far, and Draco was alive because of it.
Krum came to collect Hermione, and Draco felt relieved to know his friend wouldn't be stuck down here much longer. It was then that he noticed Potter hovering about, a merperson growling at him with their trident aimed to strike. What had he done to piss the merpeople off this quickly?
He reached out for Draco's hand, his grasp gentle around Draco's wrist as he turned it palm up. Whatever he had been fidgeting with was pressed into Draco's palm, smooth and heavy and cooler than the ocean spray that held in the breeze. Corey's fingers ghosted over his skin a moment after his wrist was released, leaving an echo of their warmth behind as they retreated back to Corey's lap.
The phrase was novel enough to break him out of his daze, and he looked at her for an explanation. "Pinky swear?"
Skeeter nodded in gleeful agreement. "Of course, thank you so much for your time. Have a good day, Mr. Malfoy."
"This is nothing like the conversation about eating placenta!" Cassie leapt to defend herself.
"It's beautiful," was all he could manage to reply. And, it was. A lighter blue that was almost lavender, the stone had wispy bands of white and bleached violet layered throughout.
There was some commotion in a cluster of weeds as Grindylows made their way to attack Diggory, but the Hufflepuff made quick work of them and continued on. Draco almost did, as well, had the commotion not been redirected towards another Champion.
Severus shifted from one foot to another, before making his way over to sit next to Draco on the sofa, staring straight ahead at the wall instead of meeting Draco's eyes. "I would never do anything to endanger your life, Draco. The Third Task will be a labyrinth, with various obstacles installed by other professors. The walls of the maze are enchanted, and will make way for any magical creature attempting to navigate it. Along with some other enchantments, and you would be protected from the eyes of the champions, not even the Minister would know of your involvement.
Draco could feel the anxiety clenching at his heart as he passed the threshold. He had swam a few times in the ocean in Washington, but had mostly stuck to the shallows, only having his first set of gills at that point. This was his first time out in the open in a large body of water. He'd be putting himself in a vulnerable position, leaving a space he knew was safe.
Severus was unaware of any information campaigns to spread the word that they were traitors, but that didn't mean that Voldemort hadn't given any of his followers special instructions to be on the lookout. Severus had yet to even be informed that his daughter had disappeared from their prison, and they had gone great lengths to ensure that it wasn't suspected that Severus had any involvement.
By the door was a tall one that sounded like tiny cymbals clinking around with each dart to-and-fro. The window, the shortest, rumbled like a tiger ready to leap and devour its prey. They were fast, unstoppable, even as Draco tripped over himself in his pursuit of them. He was spinning and spinning and spinning until he collapsed into a heap.
He went back to scrutinizing his appearance in the mirror. His face had changed so much since the start of summer. His hand came up to brush against his cheekbones that seemed to be sharpening with each passing day. Even as his fingertips brushed over soft and delicate skin he failed to convince himself that he wasn't looking less and less human.
Draco emptied the contents of his stomach once more.
"He's lost a lot of blood, Draco, help me get him to his dormitory."
His breaths were choked out of him, his chest refusing to expand with each inhale. "Getting mated was, was s'pposed to fix e'rything, s'not, tisn't-" he tried to force the words out of him, but the more he tried the heavier his tongue. Draco's vision was blurring from the sudden onslaught of tears that spilled down his cheeks.
Severus didn't look any less infuriated. "Something attacked a grindylow that was after him, and then Gabrielle Delacour was mysteriously freed right in front of Potter's eyes! You may have been cloaked, but your blatant disregard for your safety was on display for all to see!
Anger flared brightly in Andromeda's eyes, the most emotion he'd seen of her yet, until it stuttered and died with a quiet sadness.
This was shame on another level. This was shame in it's true form, and it was all Harry could do not to bury his head in the dirt and scream.
Potter spoke first. Again.
He had the Black nose.
With a scowl and a grunt Harry went on the offensive, almost relaxing at how familiar fighting with Malfoy was. Instinct coursing through him had Harry kicking the door closed and pinning Malfoy to it like he would an assailant, an arm behind his back. The comparison wasn't far off, considering Malfoy was halfway to a kidnapper.
“Jesus Christ.”
“In the presence of witnesses, I bind myself to thee, Harry James Potter, and I accept your name and your house onto my life. I swear to honour you as my first and only husband, to serve you as a husband should, and to protect you with all the courage I carry in my lungs. To these things, I swear.”
Just a glance at the woman who opened the door made dread pool in his stomach. She was greasy and disheveled, in her nightgown even though it was the afternoon, and her eyes were clouded over with a familiar and terrifying fog.
The feeling of both intrusion and amusement carried Harry through the evening. Teddy was too adorable not to love, even if he mostly concentrated his attention on Malfoy. Harry never really considered children beyond a vague hope that he would have them someday. They were always ideas, the would-be markings of when Harry would have his happily-ever-after. But when it came to actually interacting with children…well, Harry only had his own personal memories of being a child. Being bullied and then revered. He had no idea what it took to interact with a child (as he’d very much proven) or how to take care of them.
His mother was not so grateful.
"Why didn't you tell me?" His voice strained.
Swallowing his pride (something he’d grown accustomed to ever since the marriage was proposed), Draco asked, “What happens next?”
Teddy nodded vigorously. “It’s my favourite film ever. You see this orange cat?” He pointed at a drawing of an orange cat on the cover. “His name is Thomas O’Malley, and so is my new cat!”
“I will ask Melinda about your claim. If you’re right then-” Malfoy cut off, a desperate gleam in his eye. “If you’re right then I will be in touch.”
Quick as a snitch Malfoy tried to wrench the door shut in his face, only managing to catch Harry's fingers as he tried to hold the door open. Pain blended with agitation and before he knew it Harry was literally kicking the door open and barging in, vaguely remarking on the beige muggle walls and haphazard pile of shoes on a mat.
After that exchange the evening was a lot less tense. Yes, it was still an exercise and by the time Harry called it a night he’d felt thoroughly wrung out, but conversation that wasn’t lined with barbs or hostility was a huge win. Instead they spent an hour or so over tea and biscuits (which Malfoy has also made), having a stilted conversation about this and that while Teddy watched. Eventually he got bored and asked to be excused but he remained in the line of sight, pulling out a toy from the bin and fiddling with it on the floor. Teddy’s animosity seemed to have abated towards him (apparently children were fickle), but when he remembered he disliked Harry he made sure to shoot him dirty looks.
A strange look came over Andromeda, and she cast her eyes around the clutter.
When it was time to say goodbye Harry recognized he’d finally relaxed somewhat, had normalized a bit more of the nonsensical situation he’d found himself in and parsed out a bit more of his feelings. He was prepared to do it all over again next week, and said as much.
"You haven't been reading your letters have you, Harry." Andromeda croaked.
Malfoy rubbed his wrist, steeling himself with a shaky breath. "Go to you room, Teddy," he said, much more calmly than he'd been speaking to Harry, and quite a bit more calmly than Harry expected of him.
"Right," Harry breathed, "I'm here to see Teddy. And I'm sorry for how long overdue this visit is."
?” Muggle architecture he could handle, but muggle devices were something completely different.
“Er,” Harry said, “okay then.”
Draco had known, had been warned over and over again as to what was being asked of him. He would have to abandon his middle name, the name of his father, in order to be sworn into Potter’s house. His father had done too much in the war, had offended too many people. He hadn’t even been allowed to come to his son’s wedding, though that had not been overtly discussed. Draco was allowed to bear the name Malfoy as a compromise to abandoning Lucius.
“Well, I mean,” Harry blushed, and how a man as strong as him could look demure was beyond Draco, “I wouldn’t be averse. If you insisted.”
Harry regarded the sword politely, though not pulling it from its sheath. He’d hadn’t been gifted a sword yet at all today, and most knew why.
The door of the building was shoved open and Harry froze, only to remember he'd thrown on his invisibility cloak over his robes, in respect for the muggle locale. A figure popped out and narrowed his eyes at the grey sky, fiddling with knit gloves before shuffling back inside.
"I don't think you should put peas in it, is all." The smaller figure- a boy-
Stepping in as maidservant (a position far below her actual stature) Hermione grabbed his ruby encrusted sword still in its sheath and handed it to him, letting Harry attach it to his waist. Next came the, uh, resplendent red cape that Hermione struggled to carry, giving Harry a new admiration for the servants that bore the skill to do such a thing. He wasn’t exactly sure why Hermione felt the need to dress him but he didn’t want to protest or say the wrong thing and have her actually burst into tears. She’d settled a bit with the chore, the shakiness gone out of her limbs, so Harry said nothing.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked
“I’m saying that even if I married for love the arrangement would have become political almost immediately. Because I am a king.” Harry paused. “And just what do you mean by
Days bled into each other. Months. Years. Harry cried, but couldn't quite feel what about. He just felt hallow. And so tired.
“I am Pansy of Parkinson house, and I bear two gifts, one for each spouse.”
The lapsed into silence, Harry giving Draco the time to absorb his words.
his child, even if the idea of Teddy treating him like a father made Draco self-conscious. But Potter barging into their lives with more of a claim to the title than Draco had any right to be
Draco thought,
Ron was, thank the stars, royalty. He was fifth in line for the throne and his kingdom had struggled economically under Voldemort’s reign, but he was royalty nonetheless. Next to him sat his mother and father, King and Queen, and beyond flowed those of royal (or noble) blood who had fought next to him in the war. Those who hadn’t had such an active role sat on the other end of the horseshoe, with both those who had stayed neutral and those whose borders were so far removed from Harry’s kingdom that sending aide would have cost five times as much as anyone else in the Upper Lands. And of course there were those who were embroiled in their own wars as well.
Harry Potter?” Teddy asked him dubiously, narrowed eyes inspecting Harry like a specimen (another Malfoy mannerism).
Harry shook his head, choosing that moment to fling the covers back and dive into the sheets. Draco followed his lead, taking the silence as a blessing and silently begging whatever forces at work that his new husband and king didn’t have him thrown off the highest turret the first chance he got. Draco deflated, all tension leaving his body.
Harry rose to meet her and accepted the envelope, only to be startled at the wetness on Andromeda's cheeks. She'd cried throughout the entire visit without Harry hearing a sound. Harry remembered what that felt like.
Feeling a bit like he was imposing once again (because a film was just a bit more of a commitment wasn’t it? Was he being invited to stay or was he being subtly asked to leave?) Harry jerked in his seat, not knowing if he needed to rise or not.
Draco nodded seriously. “And then what?”
Malfoy groaned, covering his face with his hands. Teddy whipped back around. “Daddy didn’t get it even though I explained it a million times.” He said dramatically, rolling his eyes.
. Many a brothel had stories of Harry’s brothers (and sisters he supposed, what a backwards culture) in arms and not all of them were particularly flattering. Who knew what Harry would expect from him tonight.
She was currently on the other end of the old castle tending to his… betrothed.
