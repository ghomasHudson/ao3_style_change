Harry sighed and closed his eyes. He was very tired now and only wanted to lay down on the couch and sleep. "We had finished, I stood up and we shook hands, I fainted and woke up on the floor. My pulse was speeding crazy and I couldn't breathe. It was like a bunch of firecrackers had set off inside me."
"Helping you to relax. You don't have to clamp up and endure until I'm finished, you know. I could make this feel good for you too, if you want me to. So, spread your legs a bit more." Malfoy's voice sounded muffled and once more he made a wet track with his tongue along Harry's perineum up to that most intimate sensitive place.
"You think this is the next step?" He sounded a bit out of breath too. His face was very close now. I could see flecks of silver in his grey eyes.
"I knew you had it in you, Potter," he heard Malfoy's low voice right above his ear. He could feel the light scratch of his stubble on his cheek. "You only needed the right partner." He made Harry spin and caught him again, much closer this time. Harry's crotch was now directly over Malfoy's thigh and something long and hard stirred against Harry's hipbone. Was that…? Oh, God!
"Hey, are you awake?" Draco put his sharp nose in the crack of the door before the rest of him followed. The room was dark with only a few pools of soft light in the quiet night. The clean smell of magical antiseptic filled the air.
"No, I didn't!" Ginny yelled back. "I told you so many times how much I love this, how playing Quidditch is my life. Have you any idea of how good I am?" She glowered at him. "When was the last time you saw me play a game? I might have a chance to play for the National team, that's how good I am. But I can't do it with a bunch of kids. That's your dream, nor mine."
Harry looked at him. His curiosity grew. It's been three years since the war and since then their paths had only crossed a couple of times. The Malfoys were cleared at the trials, mostly because of Harry's testimony about Narcissa's and Draco's part in the outcome of Harry's own fate, and the last-minute turn of alliances they all made. Lucius Malfoy had to pay an enormous fee and a year at Azkaban, but after his release everything seemed to be back as they once were. Almost.
"Well, not exactly..." Harry felt a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature in the room. He let his forefinger follow his swollen lip. Had they kissed?
A violent retching sound made them both turn to the boys at their side. "What?" Harry asked James, who pretended to vomit over his plate.
Harry sat down heavily on the trunk and chuckled quietly. He wondered what any of them would've said if they saw him now. He stretched his aching back and neck. The bending up and down today had been tiresome and he had felt a constant hum of discomfort all afternoon.
When Harry stepped inside the restaurant, with all it's familiar scents, Marina grabbed him by his arm and dragged him over to the secluded booths.
means something to you." He leaned over and put both his hands on Harry's knees. "You have to bloody talk to him, mate. Find out what he thinks, what he wants, instead of making all these crappy assumptions," he said resolutely. "For what it's worth, Harry, we all think you deserve some happiness."
"When I was little, he was my hero and I wanted to be exactly like him. I admired him so much and did everything I could to imitate him." He fell silent again and closed his eyes. "But that's just it," his voice was a bit hoarse, "I was nothing more than a poor imitation. It wasn't me." He stopped talking again. He realized that he'd let his guard down. No dissimulation, no false appearance. What was wrong with him? Had someone managed to slip him some
A little sad smile pulled at Draco's lips. "Well, I didn't put up much of a fight over them, did I?"
"Keep your voice down," Draco growled. "I'm not in the habit of denying who I am and what I do, but I don't want my son to witness yet another argument in his home."
"Oh, sod it, Malfoy," Harry retorted. He was at the same time reluctant, embarrassed and a little aroused.
"Any Quidditch-material in the lot?" Flint asked around and accepted the glass of Fire-whiskey Draco offered him. "I'm planning on training Tiberius over the summer, so he'll be ready for the try-outs. The House-team could really use a couple of good flyers next term. The bloody Gryffindors keep beating us to the cup year after year." He glanced at Harry and cleared his throat. "No offence, Potter."
Harry grinned widely and held up his hands in mock surrender. "I'm your slave, oh Great God of Potions. What shall I start with?"
"Well, that was sort of refreshing, I suppose," Malfoy said eventually, as he stepped out of the shadows and wiped his mouth with a white handkerchief.
"It's not like that." Harry shook his head and smiled. He couldn't help being a bit amused. "It's for my house, actually. I'm having a bit of a problem with the previous owners. Relatives of yours, I guess."
Malfoy rubbed his face with slightly shaky hands. "For Salazar's sake, Potter, just pick one. I wouldn't know one from the other."
He walked into the breakfast-room and paused. The sun poured through the high window, that faced the east, framed with soft green curtains. He closed his eyes and let the warmth wash over him. He could never get enough of sunlight these days.
Potter laughed. "Oh, well, let's see. First we ran, then you tried to Apparate, which I stopped, naturally, you can thank me later. Then, after a lot of fuss, I managed to get you into a cab, but you threw up in the seat, so we had to walk the last bit. But we made it here."
Harry's head hurt and he was panicking for air. Malfoy's fingers trembled as they opened the collar button of Harry's shirt. It made it easier to breathe and the dizziness subsided.
He walked over to a sideboard and poured Harry a glass from an ancient-looking bottle. "I'm restocking the wine-cellar here. I guess it's a hobby of mine. This just arrived. Wine is absolute hell to transport in any magical way. Far too sensitive for Portkeys or Floo-ing, so it has to be the Muggle way." He swirled the dark-red fluid in the bowl of the glass and held it up to the light from the chandelier to look at the colour. "This is a Chateau Ausone Saint-Emilion, one of my favorites. I'm sure you like it."
"Of course, I love him. He's the best friend I have." She straightened up and tilted her head back a little so she could meet his eyes. "If you think, Neville Longbottom, that it was news to me that Draco's arse over tits for Harry Potter, then think again. It's been the worst kept secret in Slytherin since fourth year. I'm so happy for him I think I burst."
Harry turned and gave him a curious look. "Is that how you grew up? I thought you were close to your parents?"
He left and ignored Slughorn, who'd been waiting outside, calling after him. With long strides he walked hastily through the corridors. Away. Out. Somewhere else.
"Oh, well… you're Draco Malfoy. You're like this superior being. You're so bloody gorgeous, pefect body, long legs..."
Harry shrugged. "No reason, I just wondered." He worried his lip between his teeth, as he always did when things bothered him.
Harry began to breathe heavily and shifted restlessly in his seat. Before he had a chance to think it through properly, he got up and mumbled, "I've got to go outside. I'll be back in a sec."
Draco sighed. This approach from Granger bothered him. He had forced a smile and she had looked at what he had written about the runes found at Old Upsala. Clearly it wasn't what she'd been after because her own notes had been almost exactly the same. What was she up to? A friendly chat?
"Now you understand why I don't want my children anywhere near this place with her still here," Harry said, and raked his fingers through his hair, making it even more tousled. He had just called Malfoy his friend and felt a little awkward about it.
"Draco, is that you?" he whispered. "Merlin's beard, have I been looking for you." He came up to him and threw his arms around Draco's shivering body. "You're absolutely freezing," he said. "Come here." He steered Draco towards the bed and cast a silencing spell around them and closed the drapes. Draco had spent the day walking, for hours, in the cold, until his body was as numb as his mind.
"Look, Harry." Malfoy lifted his hands from Harry's chest to let them rest on his shoulders. "I'm with a client." He squeezed soothingly Harry's neck, searching his eyes. "There's a teashop just around the corner here. I must finish this first, but I'll be there in twenty minutes, tops. All right?"
"Well, it makes that little pert arse of yours stand out in the sexiest way possible, if you ask me," Adam said with his head tilted to get a really good look before he returned behind the counter.
I laughed too. "I think I know what you mean." The moon had risen slightly higher in the sky and it shone on his head, giving his hair an ethereal glow. Merlin, he was beautiful.
"Yes, he's quite lovely," Pansy admitted with a smirk. "Scorpius Malfoy-Potter," she said and patted the baby on the blond head. "you're going to be just as handsome as your Daddy when you grow up."
"I've been invited to a book-release. I guess there'll be drinks and hours dóeuvre, reporters and such. Will it do as a date?"
Mrs Malfoy supervised as Harry and Draco carefully lifted down the portrait from the wall. All the while, Mrs Black sat completely still with her jaws clenched and her lips pressed tight together. Now, that she wasn't screaming and cursing, Harry could see that she once must have been truly beautiful.
"You know, this came completely out of the blue for me," he said and stirred the tea. "I didn't know I could get attracted to men. I've never been with anyone but Ginny, and I thought I never would be." He laughed a little. "It never occured to me to look at blokes. But now, after what happened… after I've been thinking, I can't say I'm that surprised. There were always something about Ron's brother Bill, in a way Sirius, Cedric, and of course, you." He gave Draco a look. "Though it was never easy to feel anything but contempt for you."
I was quite content where I was, wedged in between Ron and Luna, who always seemed to find her way into the 8th years common room. My head was buzzing pleasently of the Fire-whiskey we'd all been handed, "To get everyone relaxed and to smooth out the awkwardness," as Seamus said.
"I've been out there the whole time," Draco huffed. "This place is absolutely obsolete. The directors of this second-rate hospital will have a lot to answer for when I'm through with them. No wonder so many families prefer to give birth at home."
He heard a woman cry out, "Harry! the baby!" Maybe it was Hermione, but Harry wasn't sure, the noise and the commotion were too loud, and Harry screwed his eyes shut. People were scurrying to get up to the podium. Harry heard, as from far away, McGonagall call for order and to remain in the seats.
Draco had the strangest feeling. Never in his old life had he ever imagined himself in a situation like this. He was sitting on Harry's dark blue sofa, which he had helped picking out the colour for, wedged in between two little boys, eating ice-cream, watching something colourful on the bright box Harry called 'the telly'. Albus, on his right, sensed in a way only a four-year old do, that Draco had no idea of what was going on, and explained what was happening to the mermaid with the long red hair. He had just been up to cast a new spell on Walburga Black while Harry was upstairs putting the baby to bed, so he had missed most of the song the strange orange crab was singing. It didn't matter. What mattered was that he felt more relaxed and at ease here in this house than he'd felt in his own home for fifteen years.
"It just doesn't seem plausable, that's all." He sighed and disposed of his glasses with one hand so he could rub his eyes with the other. "I've already told you of my dating disasters. I can't connect with a Muggle girl. My history is too complex to understand for someone who's not in our world, and all witches I meet are far too obsessed with the thought of dating the Saviour, the Boy-Who-Lived. I can't do it anymore." He put an arm over his eyes to cover his face.
"Yes, you were." Harry's eyes lingered on him and a soft smile curled his lips. Draco couldn't resist smiling back.
"Well, I sort of changed my mind." Harry squirmed in his seat and looked into Molly's kind brown eyes. He felt his throat clench and burn. "There's going to be a baby," he croaked.
Harry's hands shook and the names on the list became a blur under his eyes. Something sharp hit him on the shoulder. Harry looked up at the crowd.
Potter said, and the tip of the wand ignited with a pale amber light that reflected in his unshielded eyes. He held out the wand towards Draco. "I've been meaning to give it back to you since the start of term, but you're not the easiest person to approach. I also wanted to say, thank you for letting me have it. I know I snatched it from you, but without it we wouldn't be here today. None of us would."
"André told me I have a secret admirer, who never stays the whole show, but comes every week. When I asked him to describe him, he said, "Light brown hair and hazel eyes", I asked, "Glasses?" and when he said no, I knew it had to be you."  He sat down opposite me. "Lose the
something wrong with my fireplace, though. That's why I asked you not to use the Floo." He paused and felt anxious and awkward. He knew he must look like a bufoon and tried to flatten his hair down again. "Would you like to come in?"
"You think that's what Harry's there for?" Neville peered at Ron with an unshielded confusion. "A fight?"
Oh, Draco knew how to make them work, alright. His father had forced him to practice, so there never could be any doubt where his alliances lay, but against Potter, that day...?
"Astoria, naturally," Malfoy admitted and followed a crack in the table with his forefinger nail. "She yelled at me, she never done that before. And she called me a fool."
With a blurry head Harry turned back to his family and friends. Al was tugging at his robes, apparently still distressed over the argument in the car. Harry squatted down and looked at the face that was a spitting image of his own, except for the glasses and, of course, the scar. "What's the matter, Al? Aren't you happy to start your first year at Hogwarts?"
A bath, that sounded manageble. He carried the squirming, furiously screaming child up the stairs and into the bathroom connected to Harry's room, which was the only one in the house with a tub. Kreacher popped up at his side, wheezing at every breath he took.
He Side-Alonged Harry to a secluded area right behind Oxford street. Harry looked around. "If I'm right, this is an all-Muggle part of London. Does this even count as a date?"
Mandy smiled again and left him for her cluster of friends, and Blaise found that he had positioned himself on the wrong side of the bar, like a fucking bartender, when Draco swaggered up and handed him his cup for a refill. The punch wasn't heavy on the alcohol, but this must have been his third or fourth in less than half an hour.
Malfoy panted very close to his ear, "You can waltz around with that little She-Weasle all you want, Scarhead, it doesn't mean a thing. You're still gay as fuck. You don't want anything more than my cock up your arse." His lips trailed down on Harry's naked back and then he pushed something long and throbbing against Harry's crack. Harry couldn't help but grind his arse against it. He wanted it, he craved it. He felt dizzy and Malfoy's voice seemed to come to him from far away. "Say it, Potter, say that you love it. That you'd love to have my cock inside your arse."
"Speaking of promises." Potter sat up and leaned over to the bedside table on Draco's side. The warm naked skin of his chest pressed against Draco's torso and made Draco bite his lip not to gasp. Potter pulled out a drawer and took out something very familiar and gave it to him. His old wand.
Harry couldn't help letting the smile free now and his green eyes sparkled as they met Draco's worried grey. "It seems that we have to do this all again, then. Maybe more than once. I'm sorry about that." Harry faked a sigh, but the mischief stayed in his eyes. He beamed. "Draco Malfoy, may I introduce you to your daughter."
They were thrown out. Not in so many words, but a stern looking Ministry employee Harry vaguely knew from somewhere politely informed them, with barely concealed irritation, that the bar was closing and, if they wanted, they could be escorted home by the Ministry's house-elves, as they were in no condition to Apparate or even find their way to the Floos at the Atrium.
"I must admit, now you got me hooked," Malfoy smirked. "I want to know every sordid detail. Didn't you get turned on?"
"But if we don't buy the house now, it'll be gone, and it was perfect. It had just the right amount of small bedrooms for the children and that lovely back garden. You said so yourself." Harry put his chin out to make a point.
"Zabini," Harry said and shook his hand. Zabini raised a curious eyebrow. Harry turned to the third man. He seemed vaguely familiar. "Marcus Flint?"
Malfoy didn't seem to pay any attention to what Harry said anymore, wrapped up in his desperate fury as he was.
Harry sat back on his heels again and squinted up at his son while his heart raced madly in his chest.
Harry put his hands in his pockets. "Yeah, I know, but it's too far from where I sleep." He began to walk upstairs.
"I really don't know why I suddenly fainted," he concluded after finishing the story. "I've felt just fine up to that point and I feel just fine now again."
I walked a bit closer to where he sat. "Because of the shirt thing," I said and pointed a the two-letter word on my chest.
"There's no time for that now," Neville shot in. He was the new professor in Herbology. "We got to get Harry out of here safe. There's a lot of angry people out there." He turned to Harry. "I think it would be best for you if you didn't show your face in the Wizarding World for some time."
Don't tell me, Harry James Potter, that you're such a daft prick that you don't know that you're in love with him?"
The door was locked and warded. Pansy singed her hand when she tried the handle. "Draco, it's me, open the door." She could hear the sound of things being thrown around and a snappy retort came through the door.
"It's something really useful," Seamus said. "Something we've all been needing in our social activities."
"Wow, Harry," Ginny said and leaned back against her seat. "This is bizarre in so many ways. I didn't even know you were into blokes."
Draco shot him a demonic glare. Long strands of his hair had loosened and fell around his forehead. he pushed them back."Was Potter there?" he asked darkly.
Malfoy kept grinding his hand cupped over Harry's groin. "Maybe," he said, his voice a notch darker than it usually was, "we should start easy and just get rid of all the embarrassment, shall we?"
"How dare you interrupt me like this. Barging in, yelling about soulmates, in full Auror-uniform, when I'm with an important Muggle client. Not to mention that you left me in the same uncivil manner almost two weeks ago." Malfoy's grey eyes were like storm clouds, piercing into Harry's.
Malfoy held Harry's gaze steadily over the rim of the coffee-cup, as if searching for something. "I couldn't say with 100 percent certainty, of course," he drawled, "but my assumption is that she's in New York with her new husband."
Narcissa Malfoy raised her head and her eyes fell on Harry. She had aged. In the decade that had past, since he last saw her, her hair had greyed and her eyes had lost their clarity. She was thinner than he remembered and the hand that rested in Draco's firm strong one, was pale and wrinkled. She was only fifty-three.
He braced himself and stepped into the morning clatter in the Hall, and with his head high and with a perfectly arched eyebrow, he walked on to the Slytherin table, in perfect control of his body's movement. He was careful not to look around for Potter. He sat and nodded to his friends, when it struck him, that for the first time, in all the years he'd been at Hogwarts, was he seated with his back to the Gryffindor table.
When she was gone Draco slumped down in his chair and took a gulp of his tea. "That went well, all things considered."
Harry nodded, mute at the thought, and led them into his bedroom. As they entered, he cursed under his breath for leaving it in such a mess. There were clothes and uniform-parts in various need of washing thrown over the chair beside the closet, empty tea-mugs on the dresser and a multitude of Magazines and paper-back novels on the floor.
Potter was angry now. His jade-green eyes flamed, his cheeks burned and his breath hitched, and he looked
This had caused a rather heated argument but ended with them all here in Gryffindor tower, watching the two well-matched players, both determined to crush one another. They had moved the small table with the chessboard right in front of the fireplace so the others could follow the game while they read or studied.
He tried to avoid Potter. It wasn't easy, since all the 8th years had almost every class together. He hurried out of classrooms and spent most of his time in the Slytherin dungeons. He even stayed away from meals and sneaked off to the kitchen late at evenings, to get something from the house-elves, to eat in his dorm.
"This time I want you to see, and since it's your first time, I'll make it easy," Malfoy said. "Sit down on your knees." He lay a hand on Harry's shoulder and pushed him down. Then he took the red rope and threaded a couple of loops. "I'll work mostly on your back," he said. "Your arms go in here."
"As I said, it's my resignation. I'm finished as an Auror. As a matter of fact, I'm finished with everything that's politics and good relations and making public appearances. I never liked it and I'm not good at it. You saw the disaster I created at Hogwarts and how much it has taken to get the newspapers and the public opinion back at the Ministry's side again. And I can't honestly say that it won't happen again, 'cause it can. I'm no politician. And I'm fed up with being the Ministry's poster-boy."
"No." Harry played a little with his wineglass and dared to catch Malfoy's gaze. "But there was this time at a Muggle bar..."
Ron picked up Harry's wand and the precious Marauder's map. "Oh, this is so not good. We have to get him out again," he stated calmly. "Who do we know in Slytherin who'd be willing to let us in?" They weren't exactly friends with the Slytherins, but since they came back things had developed into a different attitude among the eighth-year students, polite and cordial. It was a fragile truce, and Ron had no desire to have it jeopardised by a drugged Harry, who obviously didn't know what he was doing.
"Then there is the question of Draco Lucius Malfoy, son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. Marked as a Death Eater, but according to his own statement, it was forced on him against his will, under threats from the Dark Lord Voldemort of hurting his family. Draco Malfoy was also underage at the time and should therefore not be held responsible for this. Furthermore, according to another testimony given by Harry James Potter, Draco Malfoy saved Mr Potter's life when he refused to identifiy Mr Potter and give him up to the Dark Lord Voldemort. Draco Malfoy surrendered his wand and aided Mr Potter in his escape from Malfoy Manor, where Mr Potter was held prisoner, and according to Mr Potter, thus changed the outcome of the war. If there is anyone in this jury who see fit to send this young man to a sentence in Azkaban, please, raise your hands."
Everything went black. Harry felt his heart's rapid beat in his brain and he couldn't breathe. He was on the floor, gasping for air.
"It is a most unfortunate occurrence," she said. "I assume that your mother wants you to come home immediately?"
"You ought to get one," Harry said and put it back into his breast-pocket. "It would certainly help the next time you want to have a night out. Hasn't any of your friends got it yet?"
He stepped into the bookshop. He had no real purpose, only a faint desire for something new to read, one of the latest Auror-crime novels, parhaps. He browesed the shelves and suddanly froze as he turned a corner.
Harry searched for words. They were a good group; it wasn't like there was something missing. "Why aren't we friends with anyone from Hufflepuff?"
She and Ron stood up and Harry let himself fall on his back on the soft cushions. What a nightmare, and on top of everything, the trial tomorrow. And there Malfoy would be. Harry covered his face with his hands.
"You think I had a childhood crush on you?" Harry's eyes glinted of mischief under his long dark eyelashes.
Zabini showed him a seat, and after levitating two magically heated teacups, he sat down opposite him, piercing him through with prodding dark eyes. "Now, what have you been up to lately, Harry? Any juicy gossip to indulge me with?" A snidely smile played at the corners of his mouth. "How are things with the Golden Gryffindors? Still in that amiable threesome of yours?"
Harry gestured Ron and Hermione to go on without him. Hermione turned her head, and nodded when she saw Malfoy. Ron made a face but gave Harry the thumbs up. Harry rolled his eyes at their too obvious signs of support.
"Draco, darling! Haven't seen you in ages. How are you?" The young man behind the counter rushed up to them with his hands in the air. His dark hair was shaved on one side of his head and almost shoulder-length on the other. He wore a multitude of earrings on the shaved side, and Harry suspected his eyes were rimmed with khayal.
"What makes you think it's not Ginny's?" he asked and pulled up the shirt-collar as much as possible.
"Oh, Ronnikins," Ginny laughed and made a disgusted face. "You're such a sap, always trusting in the happily ever after."
Harry felt his cheeks heat up a little. Another one of his many shortcomings in life. "I suppose I can stay at Ron and Hermione's tonight, if it makes you feel better."
On the other, he'd saved them all by not revealing Harry's identity at the Malfoy Manor, and yet he'd gone after them into the Room of Hidden Things, where Crabbe had started the Fiend-fire, possibly to seize him and hand him over to Voldemort.
"Not." He grabbed Harry under his chin and their lips collided, screwed together, deep in desire, then deeper still.
Hearing Malfoy moan his given name made Harry even more aroused. He clutched Malfoy tighter with his arms and legs, and released all his emotions. He pushed up against Malfoy's thrusts, made them deeper, and he couldn't keep silent.
Draco huffed, his cheeks burned a little. "You're such a moron, Potter. Give me that blasted book." He held out his hand and waited, but Potter hid the book behind his back.
Harry was sitting at his side on the sofa. He had his Potions textbook in front of him, but he didn't seem to study anymore. He wasn't watching the chess-players either. Harry had placed both his hands on his belly and had a rather awestruck look on his face. "Hermione," he said slowly, "I felt something move."
"That means they're going to talk about girls," one of the other men said with a wink at the woman beside him. "What could be more important than that?"
Harry took one more look at himself in the mirror. "You really think I should buy it?" He turned to face the other men.
"No, I'm not, and you know it," Harry muttered and turned her around in a stumbling twirl. Dancing with Ginny wasn't so bad, they both laughed at how terrible he was at leading and made a joke out of it. Mercifully, the waltz ended and the band started to play something with a slightly more beat to it.
Tomorrow he would Floo-call his mother. It's been a long time since they last spoke, and he had a lot to explain to her about what had happened in the passed months. He knew she would be worried about his involvment with Harry, not for Harry's sake but for his own. She didn't want him to get hurt, and he knew he was getting himself into deep waters. But it had become more and more difficult to stay away. The woman saw everything, had always done so. Draco just hoped it wouldn't stop her for helping them with Mrs Black, because, apart from that horrid portrait, this was now a home.
Potter and Weasley exchanged glances. "It's not Seamus's fault. I drank it by accident," Potter said.
The garden was small, even if it was enchanted, just a patch of lawn, a few flowerbeds and some fruit-trees, but big enough for a small gathering of friends on a warm summer night, when it's too hot to be inside and you never want to go to bed. It was sadly neglected, though.
He came through the Floo into his living room and flung himself onto the couch. But that didn't feel good either. He got up and went into the kitchen and opened the fridge but closed it immediately. He walked into the bedroom instead but went right back into the living room. Something didn't feel right; he was never this restless.
Malfoy snorted, turned around and plunked down in one of the recliners, all stainless steel and charcoal leather. Harry carefully tried out the other and found it surprisingly comfortable.
"Good." Harry smiled widely and stretched his arms up and landed back down on the sofa again. As he did so, his shirt rode up and revealed a strip of naked skin at the top of his jeans, the little pout of his belly with a string of dark hair vanishing down his pants. Draco growled at the sight, and the frantic pounding of his heart erased every clear thought from his mind. Before he knew it, he had pounced.
The bright lights kept blinking and the music kept pounding and Harry felt something significant dawn on him. With a loud groan he ploughed his way after him.
Harry took a gulp of his now cold tea. It really wasn't the same with magically heated water. "You mean, to call him, from Scotland, just like that?"
Now Malfoy pressed him even harder against the wall. "Maybe, just maybe you deserve to be punished for that."
"There is something, don't be alarmed, but there's something that I've got to tell you. I know how much you wanted an heir, someone to carry on the long line of Malfoys."
Malfoy laughed. "Naturally. Every pure-blood kid waits anxiously for the day when their soulmate is revealed to them."
Harry looked over the small table and couldn't help an eyeroll as his gaze met Draco's. Typical pureblood thinking. Draco's mouth quirked in a little scew smile. "That's right, Mother, the lines won't die with me. Though, mixed with Potter's, they won't be pure anymore." His jaw clenched and his eyes got hard.
She took a step inside, and the love she felt for this complex boy, with all his wrong decisions and conflicting motives, made her heart flood over. She opened her arms.
"You've not been experimenting with any... recreational potions, I hope?" It wasn't unheard of among the senior students, and Poppy was constantly worried, especially after last year's events. Different hallucinate potions, and even Muggle drugs, occationally found their way into Hogwarts, but surprisingly, she'd not heard of any such trend.
"Here's your beer, Harry." Ron handed one of the two bottles and took a large swig from his own and followed Harry's gaze. It landed on a tall slim boy with silver white hair on the dancefloor. He twisted and twirled, and the long strands of his hair whipped his face, and he was laughing. He was wearing light grey trousers that clung to his hips and arse, and a pink,
"I'm sorry," Harry said to all of them as he stepped up to the fireplace. "I never meant to cause this much trouble."
I cleared my throat. "Since I only saw it once in second year, I can't say I miss it that much," I said.
Harry thought of the stern snarky man in his black robes at that first meeting in the Muggle café, and the man in his bed this morning, relaxed and giddy, blowing raspberries on Harry's belly, insisting it was time for his son to wake up and kick his daddy. Had it only been a year?
Draco's eyes flung open. He saw both his parents looking at him, his father with a deep frown, his mother biting her lip. "Oh, little dragon," she said with a shiver. She hadn't called him that for many years.
"Wow, that was quite intense, don't you think?" Malfoy rolled over on his back and nudged Harry with his elbow. Harry, who had his face buried in the pillow and no wish to face Malfoy right now, merely hummed. Intense, my arse. It was the best fucking shag in the histoty of shags!
Harry looked down on his body. The red rope pulled his shoulders back, where his arms were captured, immobile. On the front they criss-crossed his stomach, where the rope weaved a beautiful pattern. It cut into his thighs and pulled them apart, tight knots were pressed into the flesh, making it sore and rosy. Only his cock was free. It bobbed and leaked, fully on display.
He grounded inwardley. He was a Malfoy, for Merlin's sake! Malfoys never say please. Malfoys demand and take what they want. Please is almost like begging.
He closed his eyes and tried to feel if he could sense something different, something out of the ordinary. He couldn't. But something had happened, his lack of magic was proof of that. He had done it. It was done.
Harry felt the excitement pounding in his chest as soon as he stepped out in the cold. He looked over the area and caught a glimpse of black robes flipping around the corner to the narrow dark alley. He followed and stood face to face with a snickering Malfoy. "Potter, Potter, you must be the easiest trick in the world," he drawled. "Are you having a nice little date with your Weasley-girl?"
"Stay where you are, Potter. You're obviously not in the right mood tonight." Draco picked up a T-shirt from the floor and tossed it at Harry. "Put this back on, will you."
Malfoy gave a him a dark look. "Oh, nothing much, the usual. They won't serve me; not here nor anywhere. I'm allowed to pass through, but that's all." He resumed to kick at the bricks in the wall, who were quite innocent about how Malfoy was treated. "I can't even get thoroughly pissed when I want to."
"They even took my old toys and books, can you imagine? Some things were returned later, together with the contents of the vault belonging to me, but the Manor will never be the same as it was before the war."
Malfoy resumed to lick and kiss Harry's jawline up to his ear, and purred, "I can't believe you wanted this as much as I did."
Draco sat down. It was the third time this week he'd been at Potter's house, working on the portrait. He'd failed again. It was exhausting work and he was rather glad to sit down for a while before going home, and Potter always made him stay for dinner. Strangely enough, Potter seemed to enjoy his company and he always cooked to feed a small settlement. He was a good cook, the food was always delicious. Not much waited for him at that large empty Manor, anyway.
"Maybe we should call it a night," Malfoy said, when Harry tripped on the pavement and Malfoy reached out his hand to steady him.
"Can't have Scorpius accidently walk in here, now can I?" Malfoy said, and with an intricate flick of his wand a door appeared. He opened it and made an extravagant flourished bow to show Harry the way in. "Welcome to my secret den, Harry."
Desperation and confusion whirled inside Harry and made him spin around. In a blink of an eye Harry had his wand pointing at Malfoy's throat. "What the fuck makes you think that anything like... like this will ever happen again," Harry growled, still a little out of breath. He had difficulty grasping what little sanity he had left in his dizzy brain.
Harry really had no clue of what he was looking for as he randomly pulled out one suspicious old volume after another in the section of
The silence and the eeriness hit him, and he removed his glasses and rubbed his face with his hands. Maybe he could get a dog, Ginny hated dogs.
He couldn't look right away. He knew he was such a coward sometimes, but he closed his eyes. He heard his father sigh and his mother gave a slight gasp.
"You have Muggle cows?" Harry asked confounded. He stepped carefully not to trip in his borrowed Wellingtons. They were Draco's and at least two sizes too big. Draco could've easily Transfigured them for him, but Harry didn't want to ask.
On one hand, it truly looked as if Malfoy had changed. He was quiet and withdrawn, studied hard and was polite to everyone as far as Harry knew. He'd even seen Malfoy help one of the Slytherin first-years with her Potions homework in the library.
"Not wrong, exactly."  Hermione furrowed her brow, as she usually did when her thoughts tumbled around in that omniscient brain of hers. "But I think your action spoke more of how you feel about him than our opinion of our past enemies."
He grabbed Harry by the waist with strong arms and pressed their bodies together. Then he twirled Harry around and they swivelled to the music pouring out of the speaker, filling the room. Harry couldn't help but laugh as his breath cought when they spun.
Malfoy lifted his pointy nose. "Could we have a bottle of Chablis with two glasses?" he asked in his haughtiest tone.
Kingsley Shacklebolt entered the judge's podium. Harry kept his eyes on his imposing posture. His dark face gave nothing away of his emotions, but his eyes met Harry's and there was warmth there as always.
"I'm perfectly fine. We both are, except little one here  likes to play Quidditch with my bowels from time to time." He gave Draco a nudge when he heard him snigger. "It's not as funny as you seem to think."
"I thought you might wanted to know." Potter shuddered his shoulders. "Since I just had the shittiest Christmas-leave ever."
"Yes, because of you." He faced Harry and met his eyes. "I've never thanked you for that properly yet."
"Excellent," Harry grinned and put a steaming pot on the table. "I hope you'll stay and eat with me. At least that would give you something for your trouble."
"You bastard." Potter's voice carried in the still of the classroom. "You could've told me. I was WAITING."
"I'm sure you're more than all right without us," Malfoy said to the woman who'd waved them over, "when there's such obvious display here of both beauty and intelligence." He took her hand and bowed over it in his poshest manner. She made a swooning sound and fanned her face with her hands, and they all cracked out laughing again.
They walked out to the back garden, where Molly Weasley sat in the shade with the five-months baby sound asleep in her arms. She looked up and smiled at the two friends as they stopped to look at the child. "He's fed and fell asleep five minutes ago," Molly informed the baby's father when she held him up for Draco to take. "He's been a perfect angel."
They were at some kind of truce with the Slytherin students now. They had all apologized for what been said and done during the war. Harry had spoken up at Malfoy's trial, telling the Wizengamot of how he saved his life, which had freed him and his mother of all charges. He'd also returned his wand. With a flushed face, Malfoy had offered Harry his hand on the platform at Kings Cross, as they were about to board the train and Harry had taken it. Since then, they had acknowledged each other with polite nods whenever their eyes met, which was more often than Harry wished to think about.
When Harry came down from his incredible high, he was pressed down on the mattress by Malfoy's limp heavy body. Malfoy ran his fingers idly through Harry's hair and sighed contently.
"This isn't even remotely funny, Seamus," Hermione snarled and came to her feet. "Come on, let's see what we can do to prevent this disaster."
Harry stirred his teacup and hunched over it, seeping in the scent of bergamot and lemon. He had ordered a perfectly normal Earl Grey with his usual two lumbs of sugar. He'd also bought a lemon-tart, but it tasted like sawdust, so he pushed it aside on the small round table. Malfoy was late.
The Pub was crowded when they got there, but they still managed to get a table. Harry suspected it had something to do with him being the Saviour, but no-one mentioned it, so he acted like he didn't notice.
The boy plucked a little at his robe sleeve. "There's some smells I simply can't stand anymore, like coffee. I've always liked the smell of coffee before, and Neville's collection of dried plants. I had to ask him to take them out of the dorm."
He meant to stay out of everybody's way and only focus on his NEWT's, and he'd been scared. But all it took was one look into those mesmerizing green eyes, as they met in the Great Hall the first night. Potter held his gaze and gave a small nod, before he went on his way, and Draco released a breath he wasn't aware of holding, and his confidence returned as he straightened his shoulders.
Mrs Weasley drank her tea, hot and sweet, in large thankful gulps. Narcissa Malfoy lifted her cup and took a minuscular sip. Malfoy didn't touch his. He sat at his mother's side with his face turned away and chewed on his lip.
Harry exhaled heavily. "It was Malfoy. I sort of woke up in bed... with him," he murmured inarticulately.
Malfoy grabbed the tiny creature by its spindly arm and fixed his gaze at Harry, as much as his unfocused eyes were able to. "I have an exellent elf-made mead in my cellar. Care to share that bottle as a nightcap, Potter?"
Draco stopped in his tracks as he saw a cluster of young women on the other side of the lawn, walking around with drinks in their hands. "Don't tell me you invited
Draco deflated. "It doesn't matter. You got what you wanted from the beginning, Potter. The deal's off. Congratulations on having a child without his Death Eater father around." He turned to Hermione. "Thank you for inviting me, Granger, but I think my stay is overdue." He extracted the wand from his sleeve and nodded to Ron. "Weasley."
Half an hour later Harry found himself on the dancefloor, jumping and waving his hands in the air among the others, three or four more shots buzzing pleasantly in his system. This kind of dancing he could do. He thought he was dancing with Lavender Brown, but right now she wasn't anywhere in sight. Instead he was circled by Hannah Abbott and Padma Patil, and they both tried to touch him and slid their hands along his waist. He smiled at them but freed himself and stepped aside to catch his breath, as he checked out his surroundings.
When he looked up again Mrs Malfoy stepped out of the fireplace with a twirl. She was fully dressed in an elegant robe; only her hair showed signs of being done up in a haste.
"Probably." Harry met his slate-grey eys. "But I'm not much into casual relationships with no strings attached, and neither are you, I can tell. If we could come to this point after our history, all we've been through, what could go wrong. I think we'll be great together, Malfoy. So, move in with me, marry me."
A moment later the clatter died down and all heads turned to the entrance. The Gryffindors had arrived.
"Oh," Potter said as he opened the shirt. His hands shook harder, but he let his fingers follow the welted lines that criss-crossed Draco's torso. "I didn't know it left such scars," he said. "Snape said it would heal..."
Blaise shrugged and put his feet up on the desk. "I guess they've decided to give a go at that inter-House unity thing we're all supposed to be striving at."
It didn't take long, in fact it was distressingly fast. As Harry sensed his climax coming closer he leaned in on Malfoy and tried to muffle his moans against his shoulder. He could hear Malfoy whimper and knew he was close too.  Harry put a hand at the back of Malfoy's head and pulled his face down to the crook of his neck, and with a suppressed outcry, Malfoy came, wich was all Harry needed to go over the top himself.
Harry had packed by hand, deprived as he was of his magic, and gone over everything the Muggle way for the first time in approximately two decades. The trunk had been filled with memories and forgotten trinkets, mostly things Harry had thought were gone a long time ago.
"Oh?" Draco questioned neutrally, eating his stew prim and posh with both knife and fork. Harry was, as always, amazed of how much warmth this cool collected man could spread, only by sitting here in Harry's barren kitchen.
"Dad, come on, it's only a pint at the pub." Al nagged on for what Harry felt the umpteenth time. "I'm meeting Scorp at the Three Broomsticks as usual, and I think you should come with us." He paced up and down the garden-path in his determined state.
"Good morning, Father. Good morning, Mother," he said with a light bow. No one should be able to accuse him of forgetting his manners, even at a time of inner crises.
Harry looked at him with his mouth full of the spicy chicken curry. He had noticed the telephones, the computer and other Muggle office attire.
"Well, you can turn that bloody thing off now, you tosser," Malfoy grinned and jerked his head against the still moaning telly.
When Harry stood once more out on the street, he wore a button-down shirt in a dark turquoise, that Malfoy called teal, to his new black jeans and the leather jacket hang heavy on his shoulders. He felt good about himself and straightened up a bit.
Ron watched his best friend go blank. He was sitting on the other side of the table and saw how Harry froze and every expression on his face died.
One evening I was early, oddly enough. I got my usual beer at my usual table, and BAM, there he was, standing with his hand on his hip, smoking a cigarette.
Malfoy came up to him. He stood right infront of Harry. He lifted his hand and pulled slightly at a stray lock of Harry's hair, then he removed Harry's glasses, folded them and put them inside the breast-pocket of Harry's plaid shirt. Malfoy's face was so near Harry could see it without squinting, but the rest of the room became a blur.
She huffed and cast a few other diagnostics, not that she believed them to reveal anything, but just in case. "Any other symptoms I should know about, Mr Potter?"
Draco watched the dark water ripple. The seaweed had drifted away with the current. If he fixed his eyes and focused, he thought he saw a tentacle of the Giant Squid further away. Once, in second year, it had come up right outside the window and scared the shit out of him. Draco had avoided looking out of the windows for a long time after that. Now, after living under the same roof as the Dark Lord, after Nagini, and after Greyback and his band of werewolves, he found it almost amusing that he'd thought it'd been scary at all.
Draco shuddered his shoulders. "I didn't feel like it." He made an effort to keep it steady and nonchalant.
The two final year students celebrated their last day at Hogwarts. Both 8th and 7th years had finished their exams, and tomorrow they would board the Hogwart Express for the last time, and their life as adults would begin. Tonight, though, they were still kids and there was a farewell-party in the Great Hall.
Harry couldn't believe it was Friday again. The weekend before and this week had gone by in a blur and Harry had trouble focusing on anything else except that tonight they were finally going to do it. Thank Merlin, there had been loads of work to keep him in the office until late every evening, but today he rushed home to shower and wait for Malfoy to come through the Floo. It had felt a bit strange to add Malfoy Manor to his connections and allow Malfoy through his wards, but it was the most convenient way.
Harry sat aghast and felt his old Gryffindor recklessness roar inside of him. Something had to be done. He looked around the premises. They were in some kind of hotel bar, and there ought to be some kind of reception desk. And there was the mandatory rack of flyers and magazines. Harry got to his feet, told Malfoy to wait and set off towards it. He stumbled a little on his way back, but the latest issue of
But Harry could feel Malfoy's eyes following him around the bookshop as he continued to lift up the dusty old tomes. It made him feel uneasy and wondering. Eventually he grabbed a couple of books that might possibly help him with his problem and went for the register.
"I don't know," Draco answered. He searched under and beside his pillow, but his hand came up empty. "It seems I haven't got my wand. But since it's late December in the north of Scotland, it could be anything from stupid o'clock in the morning to breakfast is about to be served in the Hall."
Andromeda gave a sly smile. "That's not what I asked, and you know it." She was a Slytherin and a Black after all.
Harry wanted to protest but found his mouth had gone completely dry and he couldn't get a word out. "Erm," was all he managed.
Malfoy shook his head at him. "I've answered your question," he shouted. "You're next, if you can hear me at all."
"Your feelings for each other became very obvious today, with your nobel, yet maybe a tad out of line, display of sympathy for the wrong side." Dean gave him a wan smile as he stretched out for the bread.
"I'm sure. After all, you keep saying that it's a boy that I'm carrying and that he will inherit the whole thing. I might as well know what the fuzz is all about."
Harry took a deep breath, screwed his eyes shut and plunged. "I think I'm in love with Draco Malfoy."
Malfoy put a hand on his hip, yanking him closer, and reached for the button on his jeans. Harry immediatley sensed his body react. His cock was swelling and stirring. For Malfoy? Good Godric, what was he thinking, he had a
Draco emptied his cup in one large gulp and stood up to get it refilled. He swayed a little doing so. How many of these had he have, five or seven? He had lost count long ago. He leaned against the wall behind him and returned his gaze at the dancefloor. Ginny Weasley had now locked her hands at the back of Potter's neck and buried her face on his chest. Draco felt a sick feeling churning in his intestines, probably caused by all the eggnog. At that moment, Potter lifted his gaze and his sparkling green eyes held Draco's. He felt the world spinning and gasped.
"No, I can't. Not without a very good reason. There would be an out-roar of indignation if I did, you know that as well as I do. But having a baby, that would be a totally different matter, even if it is with Malfoy. If he's willing to help me with this, then I think I can handle being seen with him a couple of times to improve his reputation. The war
"Maybe you should try addressing me 'sir' when we're in a situation like this." Harry could hear the smirk in Malfoy's tone.
Another day they walked out of a classroom, when a hex suddenly made Harry trip and drop all his books on the floor. This was so typical of the Potter/Malfoy sparring that Ron and Hermione merely turned their heads and kept walking. "I'll catch up," Harry waved them on.
Malfoy held up his glass with the golden liquid but didn't meet Harry's eyes. "Same as you, Head-Auror Potter. It is allowed, you know, even for someone like me."
"I never seem to remember which House plays which, it's all the same to me," she huffed. "You all end up here injured, anyway."
Harry glared at him but eventually told him of his week, of the clumsy kidnapping, about all the things that went wrong, all the mistakes that were made, how, if he'd had the right information at the right time, he might have been able to save the child, how inadequate it made him feel. It all welled out and not only the recent events. Harry talked and Draco listent silently. In the end Draco took him in his arms and pressed him close.
"Any chance of it becoming more permanent?" Harry resumed to putting more glue on the paper, turning his back at Malfoy.
"He doesn't count, he was disowned." Draco tried to maintain the sour strain in his voice, but the truth was, he was secretly both proud and happy where he crouched on the wet floor.
"Oh, ha ha!" Malfoy made a mock shove in the air at Harry, and then he sighed. "My father is dead set at forging friendships with the old families that didn't participate in the Revolution. Well,not on our side anyway; Smith, MacMillan and Greengrass are some of them. I think he even attempted to be civil to Arthur Weasley the other day at the Ministry. I can't imagine that turned out well." He snorted. "Anyway, what better way than through marriage. And since I am an only child, I am bound to produce an heir at some point. So, that's that."
"Money is always welcome at this sort of thing, and I still have plenty of that." There was a bitter tone in his voice.
"I have a couple of new dress robes for special occasions," Harry shrugged. "I'm in uniform most of the day, anyway. The rest of the time I like feeling comfortable."
She bore her eyes into his for a long time. Then she sighed. "I honestly don't understand this, Harry, I really don't. You're too young. What about your Auror-training? We're about to start our careers when school is finished. You can't do that with a small child. Now that your life is about to begin, now that you're supposed to find out what you want to do, you'll have this baby hindering you from becoming who you are. Is this really what you want? To settle down and play house with Malfoy?"
"But surely..." Harry began, but he was interrupted by a loud roar from the crowd at the bar watching the game.
Ginny looked at him and lowered her voice. "It's all right, you know, Harry. Our marriage is over. I believe it was over a long time ago."
"Feels good, doesn't it?" Malfoy brushed the gland with a second thrust of his fingers. Harry's cock jumped and leaked  and
"It doesn't change what he've done, but a person can change," Hermione said pensively. "Haven't you seen how different he acts this year, as if he's trying not to be noticed, not at all the way he used to be. Maybe he has changed. We don't know. Did you talk to him?"
"But I'm not attached to anyone else and I really would like to explore this thing between us, see how it goes, and I couldn't do that if you were married to someone else. Who knows what will happen? We can figure it out along the way. An engagement can be broken, or maybe we will get married."
Lucius Malfoy decended the marble staircase at precisely six-thirty in the morning, as he did every day, weekday or Sunday didn't matter. He was dressed in well-fitted robes and his hair was perfectly in place. He was ready to meet whatever the world would bestow on him this day. The only thing that gave away that he wasn't as in control as he once had been, was the ache in his right hip, where the Azkaban guards had once kicked him and his slightly shaking hands.
"Well," Potter swallowed, "you shouted at me and I shouted at you. You grabbed me and shoved me, really hard, against the wall."
"Ginny, yes. But we're divorced… It just came through." He still felt strained talking about it, letting people know how he'd failed, especially to someone like Malfoy.
"It was an arranged marriage. But they seem very close, always sitting with their heads together at society functions, whispering. It's most annoying. But happy? No, I don't think I've ever seen Draco happy. Except when he's with his boy. Then he sort of… glows." He drank some more of his tea.
"That was very reckless of you, Potter. That wand belonged to me, and I liked it," Malfoy said with a bit of a slur. "By the way, do you think we could change location again?" He hunched down a little. "I knew it was a mistake to flirt with that old biddy, she's been giving me eyes like forever now. I think it's only a matter of time until she makes another attempt at luring us over."
Malfoy shrugged. "People ask me for money all the time, you'd be surprised," he drawled. "They might despise me and everything my name stands for, but when it comes to money..."
I put on a pair of old sweatpants and a T-shirt and padded into the kitchen. On the counter was the Note. I still hadn't read it. I opened the fridge to see if there was anything eatable inside, but settled for a bottle of Butterbeer, when something suspiciously green peered back at me from the shelf.
"Hold on, little one," he murmured. "There's no way out for you there. We got to get ourselves to St. Mungo's."
Draco stood and moved to the door. "She married very young; you both did," he said and swallowed. "I really don't know anything about it, but it might be her way of adjusting."
Pomfey sighed. "Well, I honestly think you should rest, but there's nothing wrong with your nose anymore, so if you must..."
So, Harry was furious, and as Malfoy passed him, alone behind the broom-shed, he ambushed him, pressed his forearm under his chin and hissed very close to his face, "What the hell was that all about, Malfoy?"
"My thoughts exactly," Malfoy said. "And once I started to look, there was evidence of the notion of magic everywhere in Muggle culture, from folklore and fairy-tales to modern alternative lifestyles. Before Christianity, magic played an important role in everyday life and the witch and wizard was an acted member of society. All that has changed during the last thousand years, and we were persecuted and forced into hiding. These facts are the core of what made the Dark Lord's believes take root in the wizard community, and if we don't want anything like that to happen again, we have to start interact with the Muggles, take our place alongside them again."
"Time to go, Potter," Malfoy said, finished his beer and stood rather abruptly. "Let's get your straight arse out of here, before anyone perceives how cute you are."
Draco laughed maliciously. "Why would anything be about something as insignificant as Ginny Weasley?"
But Malfoy laughed and grabbed his arm to pull him up. "Oh no, Potter, you're coming with me." He shoved and pushed Harry up on the dancefloor.
His vision was blurred and all he could make out at this close range was a shoulder, broad and muscular, a slender neck, blotchy with love-bites, and strays of short blond hair, darkened by perspiration.
Draco stared silently at Potter's hand and then dropped his satchel to the floor. Something about Potter always made Draco slightly dizzy. He used to mask that dizziness by opening his mouth and spit out foul remarks, jibes and even worse. Now he merely pressed his lips together and let his eyes flutter shut for a while and hoped it would pass.
"As friends," Harry stated firmly. "And when we've eaten you can borrow some old clothes of mine and help me put up the wallpaper in Lily's room." Harry smiled, and Malfoy smiled back.
Malfoy took a step inside and wrinkled his nose. "There's a kind of stable-smell in here. How's that?"
He freed his hands and pulled Malfoy's head down and began to trail open mouthed kisses on his collarbone as his fingers tugged at the shirt, to feel the soft skin on the blond boy's chest. "You know, I'm never good," Malfoy groaned. Harry could feel Malfoy's erection grow and with a whimper, Harry pushed his groin against it as close as he could.
"Seriously?" Malfoy gave a short disbelieving laugh. He raised his wand again, but Harry gripped his knuckles. Malfoy still had his mother's wand. The hawthorn remained wrapped in a cloth and lay hidden at the bottom of Harry's trunk. He'd planned to give it back, but the opportunity hadn't yet presented itself. "You
Harry slumped down on the plastic chair Ron had steered him to and looked at his hand in his lap. He opened and closed his fingers a few times, mimicking what he'd seen. Harry raised his head and met his friends worried inquiring gazes. "I'm all right," he said. His voice didn't sound like it used to. It cracked and wobbled. Hermione pushed a water-filled papercup to his lips and he drank thankfully.
She shrugged her shoulders and tried to look like she didn't care, which was starting to make me feel uneasy.
"I thought..." Harry went on. A million thoughts and feelings were clashing inside of him. "Since you haven't done it, you could kiss me. If you like."
"Just fine. And you? Still playing for the Magpies?" She had been recruited right after the war and had played against Ginny's Holyhead Harpies many times.
A shelf in the bookcase was crammed with pictures of a blond boy in various settings; as a baby in Narcissa Malfoy's arms, as a toddler on a beach pouring sand out of a bucket, with a tooth-less laugh on a toy-broom, with Malfoy, both grinnig widely at what seemed to be a Muggle fun-fair. There were no pictures of the dark-haired woman from Kings Cross.
"That's my peanut-butter and pickle sandwiches. Pipsey makes them for me, and no," Harry swiped them out of his hand, "you can't have any of them."
"No, we won't." Harry felt his throat contract and his voice wavered a little. "You're not gonna like this, not who he is."
So, I did. When I put my glasses back on, he quirked a smile. "Imagine you here. How, in Merlins name, did you find me?"
As it was a bit off season, the club wasn't crowded and most of the patrons gathered along the bar. Twenty or so, couples mostly, were scattered at the tables in front of a small stage. I winced. I didn't want to be recognized. Not that anyone here, at a muggle gay-bar would know the Boy-Who-Lived, but I didn't want
Ginny bore her eyes into Harry and gaped. "You're what? I can't believe it," she gasped. "With Malfoy the git, of all people."
Both Harry and Draco remained silent, staring at him. Zabini looked from one to the other and threw his head back in a barbed laughter. "Holy fuck, Draco! You're banging him."
She hugged him again and with flour smeared hands she wiped tears away from her eyes. "Losing a child is the worst thing that could happen to you, and it doesn't matter if they're two weeks or twenty years." She blew her nose in a corner of her apron. "Well, I'm very happy for you, if this is what you want."
Harry slid his hands over the fronts and looked in the mirror. He instantly loved this jacket, but he'd seen the price-tag. Never in his life had he had something like this. The size and cut were perfect on him. "It's very expensive," he mumbled.
The small group of people gathered around Harry on the floor in the Entrance Hall gaped after him. Harry was the first to speak. "What's Goyle doing here anyway?"
She sighed. "You can't leave. Taking your N.E.W.T.s is part of your probation-deal, you know that just as well as I do."
Malfoy gave a short whimpering laugh. "You, of course, Potter. Isn't that obvious. That's why Pansy came up with this idea, to get you to dance with me on this last day. Rather sweet of her, when you think of it. Not like her at all." He turned and began strolling back to the castle again, still avoiding looking at Harry.
Hermione had watched them with a disapproving frown, but Harry had seen the twitch of a smile at the corner of her mouth. Now the landing opened up into a more modern style, but there were still bits of debris laying around.
They passed a dimly lit entrance and Harry screwed up his eyes at the colourful lights that hit him in the face as they entered the club. A heavy bass assaulted his ears in the loud surrounding music. As it was relatively early in the evening it wasn't too crowded, and by a miracle a small booth became vacant when two men decided to leave.
The girls planned some sort of Easter vaccation for them, with Portkeys and everything. The budding friendship between Ginny and Pansy Parkinson had turned out to be a rather scary combination, and all kinds of wild ideas were hurling over the desk. Harry thought he just heard skiing in Austria contra island-hopping on brooms in the Aegean Sea. "Why can't we just kip at Harry's and visit the local pubs?" Ron asked.
"Wasn't this a great idea?" Ron shouted in Harry's ear, since the music was a bit too loud for a normal conversation. After the Halloween-feast in the Great Hall, somebody suggested they should have a party of their own, all the 8th years, to boost inter-house relations, to come together as adults and possibly forget for a while what was wedged between them during the war. The Room of Requirement had easely provided them with what they needed; dimmed lights in every colour, a dancefloor and music. There were plenty of snacks and drinks as well, Butterbeer and pumpkin-juice, but also a neat supply of contraband Fire-whiskey, curtesy of Seamus Finnegan and Zachariah Smith.
"Hardly!" Harry snorted. "Did I say I wanted to be your friend?" He paused and put his wand away. "But I'm not your enemy either. Not anymore."
They were seated in a small booth in the back of the restaurant. "You come here often, I recon?" Malfoy looked after Marina, who had just left them with menues, two glasses and a bottle of white wine.
"It'll be fine," Harry beamed, slung an arm on his best friend's shoulder and hugged it. "When do you and Mione plan to be back from Australia?"
"I had a Valentine's card. It was anonymous, and I thought it was a joke at first, but when I read it again, I realized I remembered the lines."
A few minutes later he was inside the 8th year Gryffindor boy's dorm, wondering which bed was Potter's. The drapes were closed on all of them, and he had no desire to pick the wrong one.He was shivering with cold, his robes almost frozen on his bones. His teeth clattered and his hands were shaking, and he was starting to feel that this was the worst idea he had the whole fucking day, when suddenly there was movement in the curtains of the four-poster next to the window. A faint
"Last thing I heard," Harry said tentatively as he lifted a full-loaded fork to his mouth, "at the Wizengamot, your mother mentioned your upcoming wedding. Care to tell me what happened? I've been ranting on about my kids, my ex-wife and my failed marriage." He didn't want to poke, but he felt like he really wanted to know more.
He felt edgy and agitated. In all honesty, he was always a bit edgy, but this was different. Draco was nervous.
"Happy birthday, darling." Mrs Malfoy lifted her head and a wide smile spread over her face. "You're finally here. Was it a nice surprise?"
It was time to get help. It was time to stop aimlessly subsist in self-pity. It was time for Hermione. So, I went to her and I told her, over several cups of tea, and eventually a bottle of red wine. Everything, including what happened in sixth year, which I hadn't told anyone before, with  my face as red as a beet-root.
"Oh, that looks nice. Can we also have some?" A bright voice approached from the side, and Blaise looked up to meet the eyes of Granger and the rest of the Golden Trio.
"Blaise asked who I thought about when I wanked at night." Harry gave a surprised laugh. It seemed the Slytherins brought this game to a much more daring level. Malfoy gave Harry a sideway glance. "It was revealed that I'd had this crush for years."
Then he spotted Mandy's smiling face behind Goldstein and Corner, and Blaise walked over to greet her. Salazar's tits, he really liked this girl. She was smart and pretty, and she made him laugh at the most unexpected things.
"Afraid not." Harry tucked in greedily at the mince pie. He was greatful that Ginny seemed to accept things as they were now, and that they could be friends again. "You'll have to see it get worse before it gets better."
"This, you twat," Harry couldn't wipe the wide grin from his face, "is your ticket to get laid. You're not married yet, are you?"
Harry summoned one of the chairs from the dining room and placed it in front of the picture. The drapes were still shut, and the house was silent, like it was holding its breath.
"Do as you please, Blaise," he said blandly. "But don't count me in. In any case, I seriously doubt my company is wanted."
"I spoke up for you at your trial, remember?" Potter had also lowered his voice to a faint snarl. "Merlin knows, why I even bothered, since all it led to was you ruining my life."
Draco snorted and stood. "You ought to know by now, Harry, that I don't connect easily," he said. "I keep my friends at arms-length and my lovers even further. But, of course, you had to be different." He walked over to the cabinet and poured a generous amount of amber liquid in his glass and returned to his seat, without offering any to Harry.
With a sigh he took the quill and scratched down a message on a scrap of parchment to send when the owl returned from the Prophet. Harry hadn't named him yet, trying not to get too attached, but it was a good strong barn owl, who served him well. Maybe he could ask Draco to come up with a name for him. The thought made Harry smile and he started on the letter to Ron and Hermione.
Weasley looked unconvinced too and cast a dark glare, but instead of protesting, he pulled at Longbottom's sleeve. "Thanks for trying to help, Zabini, but we better follow Harry."
In the pub next door there was a quiz-game going on, so they decided to remain standing at the bar. They only gotten their pints, though, when an elderly lady in one of the quiz-groups started waving at them to summon them over.
Nine months. Delivery-date. Harry clutched his belly and moaned at his stupidity. The baby was coming.
"Are you telling me that after eight years of hexes and challenges and rivalry and WAR, that you actually
His mouth was hot and Harry leaned into the kiss. Malfoy's lips were hard and demanding and he probed his tongue into Harry's mouth, claiming him, deeper and deeper. Their teeth collided and Harry's head was spinning of lust and want. He fell into the kiss, drowned in it, in everything that was Malfoy. His skin, his scent, the hot tongue, the scraping of teeth, the flat chest that pressed to his own. Malfoy made a small keening sound, almost a whimper and his grip on Harry's hip hardend.
"Why do I get the impression that's an understatement," Harry grinned, "and that you came up with top marks, just like Hermione."
"Hardly," Draco huffed. "I detested your bloody bespectacled face, with your famous scar and your sparkling green eyes, and every time I saw you I got that funny feeling in my gut that made me want to punsch you." He peeked at Harry through a part of his fringe. Then he laughed and Harry laughed too.
Ron swallowed hard. A shiver of chill passed over him. "Oh, I got a really bad feeling about this," he said.
Draco looked away, and Harry raked his hand through his jet-black hair, making it even more tousled. "After the Hogwarts Memorial disaster, I made a few inquiries," Harry said a bit embarrassed. "Alright, there were some angry people there that day, and it got a bit out of hand. But I can assure you, they're a minority. Most of them doesn't see you as a war-criminal or a Death Eater anymore. They weren't ready for what I tried to do that day, that's for sure, but the things they shouted at you were more of a reaction at the time. They didn't really mean it."
"Anyway," he wiped his eyes under the spectacles, "my Healer asked me to evaluate what I find important in life, what I
Harry closed his eyes. His head was spinning, but he knew it wasn't the alcohol anymore. This situation with Malfoy was making him faintly nauseous, but in a totally freaking-out good sort of way. What in Merlin's name could he say about himself that could make Malfoy even the slightest interested? Somehow that seemed crucial at the moment. He cleared his throat and looked up.
"Oh, thank you, Pansy," a low voice behind them chuckled. "I didn't know you held my looks in such high regards." Harry continued to laugh at their faces when they turned. He put his arm around her perfectly slim waist and steered her towards the big garden-table. "Come on, I've saved you a seat next to Narcissa."
I worked hard to find a meaning with my existance. I wanted my life to have a purpose, that's why I studied law. I fill my life with work and try to spend as much time with my son as I can. Then there's the nice things, like music and art, good food and a good wine, and sometimes a quick blow-job with a beautiful stranger in the back of a Muggle-bar.
Harry gave a short gasping laugh. "How come I never saw this before?" His green eyes sparkled as they met Draco's.
Sometimes it was as if Malfoy couldn't wait, couldn't go fast enough, as if he wanted it to hurt. A hastily cast preparation spell and he pushed in before Harry had truly adjusted to the penetration. Once balls-deep inside, Malfoy clung to him and buried his face at Harry's throat and whimpered as he slammed vigously into him.
"Yes," Malfoy said, and all the joy was gone from his face. "It's time families like mine start marrying out of the Sacred twenty-eight. We're a vicious inbred defected lot, all of us."
"Oh, well," Malfoy sighed heavily and covered his eyes with his arm. "Then we'll have to do this all over again next week. Sorry, Potter."
Harry laughed. He threw his head back and roared with a rich contagious laugh. When he looked back at the other man, Malfoy's pupils were slightly dilated and he licked his lips. He reached out and took Harry's hand.
"Well, it seems we're all gonna miss it," Ron snapped. "Make a list," he turned to Hermione, "we might need it to show to Pomfrey later. What were the main potions anyway?" He bore his eyes into Seamus again.
"We ought to get him out of here," Ron said. He got up and rounded the table. He suddenly felt all calm and efficient, like he had during the last days of the war and all summer, when everyone in the family was beyond themselves with grief. Mum bursting out in tears, suddenly unable to carry out whatever she was doing, Dad hiding out in the shed. Ginny, usually so strong and daring, looking lost and bewildered, and George walking around like a ghost, like a man who'd lost a vital part of himself. Someone had to act the adult and get them all going, take responsibility, see them through. Ron had found it came easy to him and he had grown with the task.
"Master Draco's not even eating his chocolate fudge." The elf yanked her ears in a manne that was so like Dobby that Harry wanted to cry. "Harry Potter made Master Draco very sad. Harry Potter must make good again, for the baby."
" Ginny howled. "Who said anything about the fucking baby?" Her face had turned a scary shade of red.
I was paired up with Padma, (tough luck) and Neville, and we started on something as silly as getting sunshine out of an umbrella, (not my idea).
This had given me plenty of time to think and to watch. And to wank behind severly shut and silenced bed-curtains to, shall we say, experimental images. But I had no desire to get into an argument about it, not with Hermione in the room.
"I guess." Potter turned and his eyes glistened in the semi-darkness. "That day... when we... You didn't stop me. You didn't hex me or turn me away."
"So, you had a bit of a tumble in the sack and he got cold feet." Blaise shrugged. "Well, he's not exactly the first bloke, is he? Maybe he just wanted to experiment, and you being the only poof he knew, he took a chance."
She bit her lower lip an fell silent for some time. "Not necessarily." She handed me a scribbled note. "But here's the name and address to the club, so you can find out for yourself."
The next time we played a game of Spin the Bottle we all participated. I let my gaze slide over our circle of friends, all smiling happy faces, united for real in understanding oneanother. In the middle there were two bottles to spin, charmed by Hermione to land on either a boy or a girl, according to your choice, and whomever it landed on had the right to say no with no hard feelings.
"I'm glad they all get along so well," Zabini said silkily, and his cat-like eyes pierced Harry's under long black eyelashes. "Not like we were young. Hogwarts has changed since then, hasn't it?"
Harry nodded. "Even with the extra donations Draco and I have given, it's still difficult for the staff to properly take care of her. Doreen's accidental magic is so random she needs attention 24-7, and there's simply not enough personal for that, so I think we should adopt her. Maybe her brother Duncan too."
"Humph! It's not as if you could've had some, anyway, and it was a very good brand. Trust Blaise to deal with a thing like that." He continued licking his way along Harry's neck, nibbling at the earlobe. Harry could feel the bulge in his trousers pressed against his backside.
They all left for Christmas, and in the few days before the end of the term, Harry got no opportunity to speak to Malfoy. He looked for him, but he seemed to have vanished. Either he had left school early or he was hiding in the Slytherin common room.
"Let me get this straight, then." Hermione sounded quite cross. "You love Ginny, but can't shag her, for obscure reasons, and you shag this other person, obviously regularly, but you're not in love with her."
"But Harry, why didn't you tell us? There's nothing wrong with this, or with Malfoy, for that matter."
He ran his hands down Harry's arms and took hold of Harry's hands and pulled them back. "Ever heard of Shibari?" he asked.
We had stopped kissing but sat still with our foreheads resting against each other, panting heavily.
He needed to feel Malfoy's skin; that smooth pale skin that had haunted his dreams for days now. He wanted to press his body against it, and so he tugged and yanked until they were both free from their shirts. Harry gulped. There was a long deep scar across Malfoy's chest, disfiguring his, in all other aspects, perfect torso. The
Harry did something today. It surprised him at the time, but after so many years of smirks and pranks, glaring and teasing, he just did it.
Harry positioned himself right in front of Malfoy's frame with his face slightly over Malfoy's shoulder. His heart was beating like crazy. Harry could feel the tremor in Malfoy's hand when he placed it against the small of Harry's back. "There's no music," he said, very quiet.
Harry really had acted like a complete berk, hadn't he? But the flood of emotions that hit Harry when he came to in Malfoy's bed, under Malfoy, with Malfoy inside him, had taken him totally by surprise and had scared the shit out of him. Harry didn't plan to hurt Malfoy, not exactly, but he'd done it anyway.
When he came up in the Slytherin dorm, he pulled out his trunk from under the bed and hid the Cloak there. Before he closed it, a narrow blue box caught his eye and he picked it up. It was labelled with Scrivenshaft's and it contained a beautiful soft white quill. He hadn't used it, he just kept it there and looked at it sometimes. Nobody, except his parents, had ever bought him a gift. They all expected him to pay for everything. And this was given for no particular reason at all. Potter had just handed it over to him with a shrug, "I thought it might suit you." Draco put the lid back on with a strange feeling in his stomach.
Malfoy gave him a sceptical look, but Harry shrugged  and looked around the room. "Don't worry. It'll be gone when I'm finished in here. Some wallpaper, new furniture and a little wand-work will do the trick."
"I'm on the look for a new play-mate. Interested? Total discretion, of course. You were so irresistibly pliant that night, it gave me all sorts of yummy suggestions."
"Don't be silly, Malfoy," Hermione stretched out her other hand at him. "Of course, you must come too. Neville, how about you?"
"Still grovelling around in the dirt, I see, Potter?" Malfoy smirked as he passed. But Harry noticed the folded piece of parchment that was dropped as he passed by, and hurried to put it in his pocket. When he unfolded it, it only contained two words,
Now Harry stood still a little further away from them. He had his wand pointing at a piece of parchment under the light from one of the lit torches on the damp stone wall. Moisture was dripping from the ceiling into a small pool at their feet, indicating that they were deep down under the lake.
Harry's voice was low and he spoke slowly, "He did save my life, you know, and he was freed on all charges by the Wizengamot, their only demand that he took his NEWT exams."
He unexpectedly got the feeling of being exposed and vunerable, standing infront of Malfoy with his erect cock out in the open, so he pulled down Malfoy's pyjamas,
"And like it or not, before the end of next term we're going to be parents." Potter fell back into the bed and stared up at the ceiling. Draco could see Potter move his hands and place them on the lower part of his abdomen, which still seemed perfectly flat.
Harry could think of a few other words for it, but he seldom swore in front of his children, even if they were all grown up and somtimes used a language that shocked him.
"No, but somehow they know that you carried the next Malfoy heir and that you'd lost him. They have their own kind of magic." He took out another small package from the basket. "I thought we could watch something on that DVD-contraption of yours. Something nice to get you in a better mood. I didn't know what to get so I had to ask for help. Apparantly, there's a whole
"Hardly, but mother made her see the benefits of being surrounded by dead pure-bloods instead of being forced to live there with you. In the end, she agreed to be moved. No one could have done it except my mother, someone of her own family."
Harry groaned, "Oh God," and buried his face at her shoulder. She patted his hair and placed a sisterly kiss on the top of his head. "You could give it a try," she said. "Ask him out on a date, at least."
Harry read it through one last time and resisted the urge to crumble it like the rest of the parchments on the floor. Instead he rolled it up and fastened it on the owl's leg before he changed his mind. The tawny owl hooted irritated at him and ruffled his feathers before he flew away.
Draco Side-Alonged Harry to the slopes right outside the iron-gates and drew his wand to pull down the wards, and they walked side by side up the gravel path. The pale spectre of a white peacock was seen in a distance and its strange call echoed in the night.
Harry felt his face flush and took a big gulp of his wine. "So, you know wine. That's a Muggle drink."
Harry groaned with pleasure and started placing a line of soft kisses along the slender neckline, when he felt Malfoy's back stiffen underneath his touch.
"It's nothing of the sort," shouted Seamus and flung up his hands. "It's not that it'll make you do something against your will. And it wears off within the hour, anyway. I think." He rubbed his face and pulled his hands through his sandy hair and sighed in frustration. "It's just a joke, for a bit of fun."
"I don't think it would have worked," Potter said and shook his head. "You have to mean them, you know, and I don't think you did at the time."
Thoughts of Ginny weighed him down as soon as the effect of the orgasm died away. It made him feel despicable. Like something foul and unworthy. And so ungreatful of what he had.
This evening he had, because of his nervousness, resumed to these old teachings. He had swaggered into Potter's home, fully aware of how he was supposed to act. He'd even flirted, confidently knowing where this could lead, but Potter's kiss rendered him completely off guard.
He wanted to end this dance but Greengrass held him in a firm grip as they stumbled around the floor. The shout, once again, "
Suddenly it wasn't Parkinson in his arms anymore, but Daphne Greengrass. She giggled a little at the astonished look on his face and resolutely placed his hand on her hip, that wiggled in the same way as Pansy's. Harry blushed and tripped on his feet, but managed to disguise it as a side-step. That only made them bump into the pair dancing next to them, which was Theo Nott and someone Harry vaguely recognized as Daphne's younger sister. Was he compleatly surrounded by Slytherins? Why?
Malfoy watched him with a stern face, not saying a word. He sat down beside Harry and wrapped his arms around him and soothingly started to rub Harry's back. "Shh, calm down, Potter. It's all right, it's going to be all right," he murmured as Harry started convulsing and tears seemed to overflow. Then Harry draped his arms around Malfoy too and pressed his wet face against the soft fabric on Malfoy's shoulder. He was going to have a baby.
Harry quirked his shoulders. "I eat here a lot." But then he hurried to say, " That wasn't my number two, by the way."
Ron gave Neville a scared look. He wasn't sure Neville knew exactly where in the dungeons they were, but Ron and Harry had been here before.
" he wiggled his forefinger demonstrative in front of them, "I had to chase the dark wizards instead." He lost his balance and bounced into Malfoy, who seemed far from amused when Harry looked back at him.
"I Apparated away only minutes ago. I have no desire to go back to them right now, thank you very much," Malfoy snorted.
Harry kept his eyes on the book in his lap. The letters on the page skipped around and preformed a series of dances on the page. His hands shook a little, but he tried to hide it by pushing up the glasses on his nose. "I didn't feel like seeing anyone, alright." He sounded hoarse.
There was a whoosh of green flames at the fireplace and Hermione stumbled out, carrying a pile of cartons containing their dinner. "Hello, loved ones. What's happening?"
"All right, if you say so." She folded her notepad and put down her quill with a frown. This patient of hers was an enigma; he opened up easily on a lot of things and stubbornly clammed up on so many others. "You know," she started tentatively, "I can't say for sure, but it might be a way for you to move on. You could at least explore the posibilities, think about it. If you like, I can make an appointment for you with an Obstetrician Healer. One of the best happens to be a friend of mine."
Harry shook his head. "I've never seen anything like this before. It makes me think how close and strongly connected our two worlds are."
"The elves have prepared for a picknick-lunch, so after that, around two-three will be fine. They probably won't sleep at all tonight, so I wasn't planning on waking them until late. Everybody all right with that?"
Her eyes went wide and she turned to her son with a questioning face. Draco nodded. "Yes, Mother, Potter's carrying the next Malfoy heir."
"Potter!" The dark-haired girl with the heavy make-up grabbed his wrists and gave him a coy smile. "Are you denying the rest of us a chance to dance with 'Our Saviour'?"
"Thank you," he croaked out. The new birch wand he had got after the trials had never felt the same when he used it.
He flicked the lights on with his wand and looked around. This flat was as far from what he wanted as anything could be; in the centre of London with the convenient closeness to the Ministry everyone had persuaded him was a good thing. A bedroom, a sitting room with a Muggle telly and a Floo-connected fireplace, a small bathroom with no tub, only a shower- cubicle, and a kitchen with a table that barely sat two. Not that he had any dinner guests. The only time Ron and Hermione had stayed here to eat, the day he moved in, they'd ended up in the sitting room in front of the TV, eating pizza from the box, anyway.
Pipsey handed Harry a cup from the tray that was already set for three, and Harry gave her a smile and sat down in the chair adjacent from Mrs Malfoy and her son.
I was drawn to him, where ever he went. I hated him, I knew he was up to something, knew he was on the wrong side, and I kept following him around, with my Cloak and my map, never really sure why I was doing it.
Potter leaned back and rested his head on the pillow. "I haven't been exactly honest with you," he said, his gaze up at the ceiling. "I guess I find blokes attractive too, I just wasn't sure, since I never acted on it before, never felt anything like this before."
"See," Malfoy pointed at him with another gingersnap. "I'm right. Now call your elf and fix the fires. It's freezing in here."
"Yes, please, Marina." Harry looked around in the dining room, which was quite full of loud families eating dinner. "If there's something more secluded available, I would appreciate it?"
"Oh, yes. But he was crazy about my hair and kept touching it, pulling it, playing with it. Most annoying."
The top of the examination bed was cold. Harry had his underpants on, but otherwise he was naked under the hospital-gown and it didn't sufficiently cover his thighs and backside. He was nervous.
Why indeed? Harry certainly had intended to do so, but somehow never got around to it. The hawthorn wand still stayed in his bedside drawer, alongside some other memorabilia, like the piece from the two-way mirror he got from Sirius, a lock of shiny red hair Ginny had laughingly given him after she cut it short before her first real match with the Harpies, and the picture of his Mum and Dad at their wedding. He took the wand out sometimes and let his fingers slide over the smooth surface.
"I know that." Draco sighed and shook his head. "I've known that from the start. That's why it was safe to play. This could never lead to anything; I'd still always be free." He held Harry's gaze. "I never dreamed we'd be so compatible. In the beginning it was more of a joke, a hoax to see if I could rein in the great Harry Potter. To have you yielding to me, giving yourself to me so willingly... It was thrilling, intoxicating, but then, as you know, over time things changed."
"And that's his snake-spawn he's pregnant with!" Another hex hit him, this time a tripping-hex and Harry fell.
Malfoy bit and sucked at the pulse-point right under Harry's ear, scratching his skin with the light stubble on his chin. He mumbled something incoherent, and the low timber of his voice, the constant teasing of that spot inside, the slapping sound of sweaty skin against skin, the rhythm of Malfoy's cock slamming into him, again and again, was all too much. Harry squeezed the head of his cock and came with a cry. He pressed up at Malfoy's chest and trembled as he pulsed out ropes and ropes of cum between them. Malfoy stilled and shook, and with one last thrust he orgasmed and filled Harry with his release.
Potter sat down shakily on the bed again and turned his anxious blood-drained face up at her. "Madam Pomfey, please tell me what's wrong with me?" he pleaded huskily.
"Hell yes," Bulstrode answered and made her way through the crowd. She strained a bit with the shirt as it was a little too small for her bulky figure, but she gave a wide and genuine smile as the word
Draco studied his shoes and cleared his throat again. "We could try finding it out together, if you like. We could start with this. Are we doing this?" He lifted his left hand, wich had clasped around Harry's, fingers weaved together without any of them noticing.
"Deprive her of every hope of hapiness. You see, she fell in love with me. She was young and sweet, and I did the only decent thing I could do; I broke the engagement."
"Quite frankly, I'm sick and tired of this old hate-game between our Houses. In a few months we're all out of here and we must learn how to get along with all kinds of people in various ways of life. I think now is our chance to make amends and create a better future for ourselves. We ought to make them all a peace offering. It's about time we show this school that we're not the same as we used to be, that we're sorry, that we've changed. What happened last year wasn't our fault. What our parents did had nothing to do with us. We were kids, for Salazar's sake!" He shut his mouth and swallowed.
"What a success! Malfoy, I hand it to you, you alone finally got Harry housebroken. This cause for a celebration. Everybody, come to my office. I have a whole case of Ogden's stashed away there."
Draco hesitated, but only for a moment. Then he sneaked his hand out and put it on Potter's flat, toned, slightly hairy stomach. "Show me."
"Oh, you're awake," Draco whispered. "Thank you for the Cloak." He kept his eyes on the shimmering fabric and patted it lightly.
He put a clean pyjama  on the bed for Malfoy to sleep in, changed his robes for a pair of old soft joggers and a T-shirt and walked down to the kitchen again. He ate the
"I always wanted children. Do you think he'll mind having a second Dad? In due time, of course," Harry hurried to add.
This man. Harry cursed under his breath. How could he have been so bloody oblivious, with this boy, this man, right there all the time? All these, years being so close and still not realizing what it meant. This was it, this was finally it. What he'd been looking for his whole life. All that he wanted, all that he'd longed for and never thought he would find. This man, with his snarky remarks and loop-sided humour, his haughty airs and all his wrong decisions. And now this new version of him, that had shown such unexpected tenderness. He would never see what everyone else saw, the Saviour, the Chosen One and all that rubbish. He would always see just Harry.
Among the group of Ravenclaws she just left there was a bit of stirring and our attention was drawn. When we joined them Terry Boot had a shirt on with the word
"I didn't even know myself." Harry flushed and rubbed his neck. "Not really. Are you sure you're okay with it?"
"You want us to befriend someone, only so we can say that we're friends with people from all Houses?" The drawl in Draco's voice hadn't changed, and Harry marvelled over the fact that he found it such a turn on.
Ron chuckled. "It was the same for 'Mione when she carried Rose. With Hugo, though, she hardly threw up at all, but instead she had the strangest cravings, some wierd salty liquorice and tofu. She had tofu to everything."
He could get used to this. He had his hands pinned down above his head by Malfoy's sinewy arms and his brow rested against the pillow, his arse up in the air while Malfoy was slamming vigorously into him. Harry moaned.
"Congratulations, Potter, on your excellent observation skills. That was spot on." Malfoy slurred a bit too, the sharp posh consonants not as precise as they usually were.
Ron dared a step closer and reached out his hand again, but Harry flinched and shuddered him off, his eyes wide and frantic. In a flourish of black school-robes Harry twirled and started running in the opposite direction and disappeared around a corner down the corridor.
He worked on this spell for meny years. There were meny parameters to consider, like mutual culture, religion, language, age and so on, so that everyone should have a fair chance to find their mate.
He formed neat lines and meticulously shaped letters and swore out loud when the ink came out in a big blot and smudged his chart. In the heat of the moment, he banished the whole parchment and then regretted it immediately. Now he had to do the whole thing over again.
But the issue of Lily and Quidditch showed them how different they valued things, what they thought was important and what they wanted. To Harry, having a family was everything, to Ginny it wasn't. She loved her children, she would walk through fire for them, but she wanted something more, something that was only hers.
"We could have prevented this havoc," Robards growled, "if we'd been prepared. Or stopped it all together, if you'd asked me."
"Oh, Master!" Kreacher clapped his knobbly hands together in delight and his face contorted into what Harry was afraid was an attempt to smile. "Such wonderful news. What a treat, what a treat!" he exclaimed and begun bouncing up and down.
Hermione made a stifled sound and clutched her hand over her mouth. Malfoy sprang up and stood like stunned at Harry's feet before he dropped to his knees.
Draco turned at him, eyes wide and eyebrows arched high on his forehead. Before he got to say anything, Blaise held up a hand to silence the stream of protests that threatened to burst out.
"Well, that should cover everything. I'm sure it will be all right tomorrow." Malfoy stacked all the papers together and Harry rose from his chair and streched, a little stiff after so many hours.
Malfoy snorted. "Fake-date, Potter. I don't actually want to date you, even if you are the bloody Saviour of the Wizarding World."
"Sorry, there was no time." He placed a quick peck on Malfoy's cheek before he realized what he just had done and blushed.
"I'm not old, I'm 56." The retort came automatically, his brain was blank. Draco, the possibility to see Draco again.
"I could use a drink," Harry said. "Would you like one?" He held out the bottle of Fire-whiskey he offered to Malfoy, who shrugged. "Why not?"
"The purest of them all, who's magic is deep and strong and the one who owes you his life. Don't tell me you haven't thought of him, Harry?"
The wine was golden, cold and served in an ice-bucket. It tasted quite nice. Harry relaxed a little. Malfoy looked as if he was in his right element. Harry scoffed at him when he twirled the high-stemmed glass between his fingers, held it up to the light and took a miniature sip. The wanker.
"Scorp's dad says it's okay and he'll see even less of him since Scorp has to go to stay with his mum after. All the other boys in our year will be there, and we're gonna have sleeping bags and cake and a fly in the park and..."
A startled Janice stood at her desk, took off her glasses and left them hanging around her neck in a thin golden chain, her eyes wide as sauceres. "Mr Potter!"
"Just get out of here." Malfoy swept his wand over Harry's clothes that were spread out all over the floor and summoned them into a big heap and thrusted it into Harry's arms. "Get the fuck out of here, Potter, for as sure as hell, I'm not laughing."
"Where's your wife?" said Harry. The coffee was strong and hot and made wonders to Harry's intoxicated brain. "I didn't see her at the party tonight." He scanned the room as if he would spot her hiding in a corner.
"There's nothing between us. Nothing!" There was a shrill note of hysteria in Harry's voice. He could hear it and he hated that the other men could hear it too. "Why would there ever be? Someone like you, a war-criminal. A bully."
Harry put on his glasses with trembling hands and sat up a little straighter. He tried again, voice firmer, incantation clearer. "
Harry cleared his throat. "But surely there must have been someone else at Hogwarts, someone like you?"
"This is not the first time that I have sex, no," Malfoy smirked. He was much closer now and his warm breath whisked over the sensitive pulse-point under Harry's ear, giving him a shiver.
He moved to the front and continued the tying on Harry's stomach. "Do you think I can work on your legs?"
"No! Why do you ask a thing like that? I don't normally go around touching people's skin, do I?" Harry felt offended.
The pub was a bit crowded, but they managed to squeeze themselves in at a table with three men in business suits, discretely enlarging the seat with a few inches. Harry returned from the bar with two pints of lager. Malfoy was making wide eyes at the other patrons and he winced when he took a sip from his glass.
"It was his idea, and we  will possibly have a baby together. People will assume anyway." Harry shrugged.
Andromeda inclined her head and narrowed her eyes as she watched him. "Don't you think you ought to ask him that? In my opinion, though, he's developed into a very fine young man, much more than I ever thought he'd be with Lucius as a father. I never liked that man. If Draco should chose to be with you, I'd say you'd be very lucky." She put her hand on his arm and gave it a squeeze. "Having a child glues two people together in a way you can't imagine. Be good to him. Merlin knows, he's been through a lot and life hasn't been kind to him. He's worked hard and deserves a little happiness. You both do, and if you try to look past all the prejudices and stubbornness, it might be there for you to find."
The abandoned shed, close to the locker-rooms was dusty and dirty, with cobwebs hanging from the ceiling, but it was their best hideout, secluded and out of bounds from everyone, except Madam Hooch, who kept old scores and statistics in the battered old desk by the wall. Som worn-out Quidditch uniforms hanged on hooks by the door, but otherwise, it was empty.
Malfoy inhaled the smoke one last time, dropped the butt and put it out with his heel. "Nasty habit, I know," he winced. "I'm trying to quit. At least that's what I tell Scorp. Fancy a cup?"
"I was there today. It wasn't easy to bring him the news and I'm afraid he didn't take it very well, either."
"I agree." Draco rubbed his forehead with his free hand, the other clutched hard to the whiskey-glass. "I thought I knew what I was doing. I thought I had it all under control. I never expected to... care." He laughed a shrill hollow laugh.
Draco drained the potion. It was the expensive potent kind with a mouth re-freshener. His head cleared, and the nausea subsided, but he felt more and more confuseed over the situation. This was more than he could handle right now. He rubbed his temples. "I'm not sure, since I don't recall much from last night," he mumbled. "Did we...?" He gestured explicitly between them.
"Don't be ridiculous. Fetch me another glass of wine instead, and then take me to see the little dragon-spawn that's half me."
Harry lay sprawled out on the couch and was playing a little absentminded with the stem of his wineglass, his gaze lost in space. The food had been delicious, and they had talked and laughed, reminiscing, and for the first time really talked about their schooldays and those horrible years when they'd been trapped on opposite sides of the war and how it had affected them. Outside  a soft spring-rain trickled down the windowpanes, but inside the parlour it was warm and dimly lit, and the night was perfect. Draco closed his eyes and became even more aware of Harry's presence beside him, the closeness he felt towards him, the heat he radiated, his scent and the dormant buzz of his magical core.
"Good. You are so wonderfully obedient, Head-Auror Potter." He patted Harry's thigh. "Now, a word. Something you don't normally say on occations as this. What about..." he paused as in thought, "...Hippogriff?"
He opened his mouth and bit and licked at the pulse-point right under Potter's ear, making him moan and draw ragged breaths. Draco could feel his release coming closer, fast and unstoppable, as Potter sped up the tugging of his hand over the two throbbing cocks, gliding next to each other and leaking pre-cum. Draco withdrew from Potter's neck and looked at the face of the man on top of him, a face he knew so well he could picture it anytime he closed his eyes, the face of his childhood enemy, his nemesis, his rival. The face he'd had so many fantasies and dreams about. Potter had his eyes shut and his mouth half-open, lips red and swollen since their kissing earlier, with a spot of saliva in the corner. "Oh, Draco," he moaned, and that was that for Draco.
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up," Harry said, regretting killing the good mood he'd been having with Malfoy. It really was a wonder how well they got on together, how easy it felt talking to him.
"So, you're in a relationship now? Splendid, Mr Potter, that will certainly increase your chances of being successful a second time. And Mr Malfoy," he turned to Malfoy with a toothy smile, "see to that he's taken care of. The first trimester is always the most critical, but no stress. Make sure he eats well, gets plenty of rest and only do mild exercise. Good luck to you both."
"Uhu, that's exactly what I think," Harry gasped and captured Draco's mouth full on. Their tongues fought and their teeth scraped, and Harry closed his eyes and drowned in that hot mouth, those full lips. He put his hand at the back of Draco's neck and pulled him even closer, and he could feel Draco's hands dig into his buttocks, pressing their pelvises together.
"And why is there a love-bite on your neck, Harry?" Ginny folded her arms and her eyes narrowed. Harry's hand shot up and pulled at the collar. He'd thought they were all sufficiently covered. Draco had been ruthless with him last night, and then refused to help Harry hide them under a
"Not since we shook hands at the beginning of term. And I don't think he's much different. He's still a prat." Harry's voice was muffled as he kept his face hidden in her hair. "Oh, what shall I do?" he whined.
Reluctantly Harry followed Zabini. Robards had put him on deskwork after his forced sick-leave, and that included getting evaluations from the Department of Mysteries at level 9. Harry hated going down there and avoided it if possible, but today he had no choice.
"All right, Potter," Malfoy muttered. There was an amused twitch in the corner of his eyes. "Let's go inside."
Harry stood still, unable to decide if he should turn around the corner and see who was in such agony or move forward, minding his own business. His inclination to meddle took the better of him.
"Imagine how beautiful you would look like that, oh Chosen One," he murmured against Harry's ear. "All spread out and open, just gagging to be filled with my thick cock."
and quickly put on his clothes. Without a glance at Harry and without his usual: see you around, Potter, he left.
some lust potions and a little bit of Amortentia to start." He glance down at Harry's crotch. "And it's starting to work. Look, he's got a stiffy."
Ginny crossed her arms in front of her chest. "You said nothing happened when you took that blasted potion. You lied." Hermione gave a snorting sound and turned to the window.
Harry rolled over flat on his back on the gravel and groaned. "Bloody hell, I'll never touch alcohol again. Ever."
Often enough their meetings ended in a terrible row, where Harry lost his temper. Harry knew why he reacted the way he did, and so did Malfoy.
Harry stilled, his forehead resting at Malfoy's neck. The sinking feeling took it's vile grip on the guts in his stomach and he screwed his eyes shut. "Please, Draco," he pleaded, "stay with me." He felt a sob building in his throat. This wasn't fair. "Love me," he breathed.
"Except his bad tatoo and his excellent bone-structure," Ron muttered under his breath. Hermione gave him a shove with her elbow.
The bar was crammed this time of night and the music pounding. Bodies moved to the rhythm of the bass, half-naked and sweat-covered, and the lights, flickering in red, yellow and green, added to the surreal feel of it all. Harry knocked down two shots in a blink of an eye, then grabbed Malfoy's hand and dove right into that swirling hopping mass. Harry threw his hands up in the air and crowed with the other men in a whirling intoxicating notion of being free.
He whirled into the room with a cloud of ash. Harry curled up into a ball with his knees against his chest and drew a shattered breath. "I think something's wrong with the baby."
I suddenly felt a great relief. This was me; I could live with this. This opened for more options and opportunities, right?
When Harry woke, Malfoy was gone again. The bleak daylight that came in through the curtains could indicate any time at all in this November weather, so Harry pulled out his wand from under the pillow and cast a
"I know," sounded the cool melodic drawl of Mrs Malfoy. "I used to drive Lucius mad when I carried Draco." She paused and then added. "I didn't realize they were intimate. I know Draco's been on and on about Harry Potter since the day he began at Hogwarts, and I certainly had my suspicions that there was something more than a childish rivalry, but this surprised me, to be honest."
Malfoy let his fingers trail a crack on the surfice of the table, avoiding Harry's eyes. "Well, let's just say that I wasn't that eager on our side winning."
"Indulge me," Malfoy said and pouted. He made a gesture around the grand old room. "We never get to use this room anymore, it's really a shame."
Narcissa Black Malfoy looked at Harry with a slight frown, but smiled nonetheless. "Oh, it's no trouble at all, Mr Potter, and please, call me Narcissa."
"Only one, Kreacher, but he's very old now and never leaves his bed. I bring him food and try to take care of him as much as I can."
"Well, he's certainly not going to disturb her complicated lines of thoughts and call her crazy," Harry continued and turned an affectionate gaze back at Ginny. "When will I see you with such a dumb arse sappy face with someone?"
Harry was restless and fidgety, so he let his gaze roam over his fellow classmates, and over and over again it stopped at the blond two rows up front.
Draco nodded back to him. "You might not have guessed it, but I was actually quite nervous about going. First time away from home and all that."
"Are you all right?" Harry Potter asked with a frown. He was alone and not accompanied by his sidekicks for once, and the corridor was empty but for the disappearing group of students that were scoffing and sniggering, proud of their successful prank. He turned his head after them, "I saw they draw a wand at you."
"You do understand, Mr Potter, that you will not be able to use your magic during the pregnancy. As soon as there been conception, and that is bound to happen at once due to the potion you'll be taking, the womb must be created, and that is depending on the strenth of your magic alone. We can only hope that it is strong enough, but if it isn't, there's nothing we can do about it. This is a chance we're taking, but the prospects are very good, considering your magical status."
"I'm sorry, that was out of line." Malfoy took a step towards Harry. "I'll be on my way, I only want to ask you something. I think I've found a solution to the portrait-problem. Quite simple, actually, if it works."
Harry had cried and begged. and pleaded, and after days of relentless arguing and negotiating, she conceded, but she refused to breastfeed Lily, so Harry quit his job on the day she was born.
Harry sighed loudly and Ginny laughed a little and pressed a light kiss on his cheek. "Relax, Harry, you're doing well," she smiled.
Harry turned his head and opened his eyes. As always she was struck by their intensive green. "Please, call me Harry," he told the greying witch, as he had done several times before. This wasn't their first meeting, after all. After years of struggling with , what he now knew was PTSD, he had finally given in to Hermione's persuasions and started seeing a Mind-Healer, and Healer Donner had helped him to deal with the loss of his parents, his abused childhood, the trauma of Voldemort and his guilt of surviving while so many had died. Now they focused on the future and that seemed to be trickier than he first thought.
Harry winced. Blaise Zabini was still a perfect prat. Harry choosed to ignore the implication. "Ron and Hermione are both fine. Rose's giving them a full-time job, of course, but Hermione is doing great with her new assignment for the Department for Magical creatures, and Weasley's Wizard Wheezes are  expanding. I think Ron has that shrewd mind for business that George lack."
"Maybe I can tempt you with a cup of black coffee instead?" Malfoy snickered. He reached out his hand to help Harry to his feet again, as children do. "I do have the ability to make exceptionally good coffee."
The June sun had set and the many-coloured lanterns did their best to spread their lights in the dusk of the summer night. The music had been turned up and the makeshift dancefloor was filled. A song came on. It was a silly catchy thing that had plagued them a couple of years ago. Teddy preformed a crazed dance where he resembled a wolf, or was it a lion, and he clawed the air at Bill and Victoire, who was next to him. Bill threw his head back, as he and Teddy howled to the song's text of moonlight and dancing, his once handsome face straining at the deep scars. They've always had a special connection those two.
"If you're dating someone, why haven't you told me?" Ginny sat down at the large wooden table. "We agreed on that, remember, for the sake of the children, and I've been open about the dates I've been on."
He remembered the club, of course. He remembered dancing, he remembered being circled by men, men who were touching. Fingers touching his hair, arms coming around his waist, hands touching his arse, hands groping him. It had felt wonderful, like he was something desireble.
Weasley shuddered his shoulders. "Muggle expression. When something is very obvious but not talked about. Like the fact that you've slept in Harry's bed, naked."
could be read on her imposing bosom. More cheers and clapping, and my fellow students crowded in to get one of their own.
It was the first week after the Christmas holidays and Draco was cornered outside the Charms classroom and couldn't escape.
Harry turned and regarded the beaming wrinkled old face. "There seems to be a problem with the fireplaces," Harry said. "Can you, please, light a fire in every room, so we can chase the damp out of the walls and get some warmth?"
Malfoy spun around and looked at Harry, his eyes wide. "Your magic is forming the womb," he gasped and pressed his lips into a thin line. ""You're pregnant."
He ran. He ran until he felt safe. He stormed through the castle until he came to the only place where he knew he could let the mask slip, where he was truly on his own. The stairs to the top of the Astronomy tower almost got the better of him, since he was a little out of breath to begin with.
The dungeon courtroom was packed to the last row and still more people tried to get inside, pushing in, filling the steps and every empty space available. A large group of reporters and photographers were packed in at the front row, bustling and elbowing oneanother to get the best angles. The noise was overwhelming.
"Didn't you know?" Hermione spun her head back at Harry. "He's been the caretaker here at Hogwarts since Filch finally retired six years ago."
Very red in the face he said, "I wasn't going to tell anyone yet. I wanted to take my NEWT's without any fuss and start the treatment right after our graduation. There's a special ward at St Mungo's that do magical gender-alterations. But I guess you all know now. I'm Teresa." With a deep sigh she added, "And I'm very much into boys, if anyone would have me."
The coaxing started already in the backseat of the car. Al was jumping up and down, unable to sit still by excitement. "He's got this really big house, with tons of secret hiding places, and a basement with dungeons and everything," Al said.
They locked eyes across the stirring room and the intense of his gaze was so strong that it made Harry's heart rage. Then Malfoy raised an eyebrow, in his usual superior fashion. Harry groaned out loud. Ron turned his head. "Figures," he hissed, "of course,
"It's a little person," Harry said, and looked down at his hand again. "I couldn't go through with it. There's been too much death as it is." He gave a hollow laugh. "We'll have to have that pub-night another time, Ron. It seems I'm having a baby."
After the war it was like a whirlwind had hit him, everything seemed to be going too fast. When the media hysteria had died down a bit about him saving the entire Wizarding World, it flared up again just as intense when he went into Auror training, and when he married his childhood sweetheart there were no end to the outcries of joy. Harry could still wake up in the night with the nauseating feeling of the world spinning and spinning, and him not being able to breathe. He had everything he ever wanted, he was happy. Why wasn't he feeling happier?
"Bloody buggering hell!" The cursing was mixed with the sound of whimpering and the thuds of fists against the brick wall.
Harry started protesting but Draco shut him up. "Think about it, there are thing about the bloodlines that's inexplicably connected with the magical cores and could be lost if there were no purebloods left. My ability to get you pregnant is only one of them." He held his hands up in defence. "I'm not saying we're better than half-bloods or Muggle-borns. That was the believes of my father and what I was taught when I was a child. I've learned better."
Then Gregory Goyle came back. He was released from Azkaban half the size he used to be, and with a deflated look about him. Before the war, Neville could never have imagined a time when somebody like Goyle were reluctant to look someone like himself in the eyes, but this was the new reality.
Harry stood crestfallen and looked at the people who were his friends, his family. Once again, he had disappointed them. He wasn't what they all thought he was. He was a fraud and a fake, a liar and a cheat, but worst of all, a freak, not normal. "The Healer said," Harry stuttered, grasping at something solid, "it wouldn't be any risk for the baby if we…"
"You can bet your pretty skinny arse you're gonna have that," Harry chuckled under his breath. Draco's breathing had evened out and his limbs got heavier. He looked younger, more vunerable than Harry had ever seen him, even as a boy. A nice warmth spread over Harry as he looked at the sleeping man at his side, once his childhood rival... now? The words that kept poking at Harry's mind through all these strong emotions, was… It felt like home.
They grabbed a cab not to get lost, as they were a bit out of focus when they'd finished the wine and Harry had paid the bill.
One night I followed him down towards the dungeons, through a dark damp corridor, filled with pillars and niches. Suddenly I lost sight of him, and before I could stop it, he threw a tripping-hex in my direction and I fell.
"You know, Ron," he said. "When we came back here, everyone assured us it was going to be the same as before the war, but it's not. Everything has changed, we've all changed."
"I bet it was a surprise for them too, but there's always been strong emotions between these two," Pomfrey said. "We've seen them at each other's throats all the time. Only this term it suddenly stopped. Like a flip of a coin."
He poured a rich amount on his fingers and continued the administrations of opening himself up, two digits this time, scissoring them to make it faster. Harry was impatient. He put some of the oil on Malfoy's dick and lined him up so he could mount.
"Well then, Potter, now that you've made me give up on one of my principals of life, what more do you want from me?" Malfoy said, when he was finished.
"Oh, he could see right through me." Draco opened his eyes and met Potter's. "I couldn't hide anything from him, and he could never really forgive me."
Draco never liked coming to Diagon Alley, or anywhere else in the Wizarding World for that matter, but he forced himself to it, to face them all, at least once a month. The attacs on him had more or less stopped, but there were still one or two every time he went out in public who hissed something about filthy Death Eaters behind his back or cast a stinging hex at him as he passed. Even if it's been more than ten years since the war, they made sure he never forgot what he was.
"You've been carrying on with Malfoy behind my back, is that it?" A red flame flared up at the tip of her wand, but to Harry's relief it died out again.
"You shouldn't joke about it, Potter," Malfoy muttered through his teeth. "You know the Ministry took almost everything from the Manor, stripped it clean, claiming that all our heirlooms were contaminated with Dark Magic, which wasn't true, of course." He had his hands clenched into fists.
She walked to the door but turned before she opened it. Harry swung his legs over the side of the bed. The cold from the floor seeped up through the soles of his bare feet. He shivered and propped his hands under his thighs. Inside he was a swirling conflicting mess of sorrow, guilt and possibly relief. "I'm sorry, Gin," he choked. It was as if all the air had left his lungs.
"What can I say, you completely changed my life." Their eyes locked and Harry decided to sit after all.
Seamus winced and croutched down at the side of the sofa. "You were at the Healer's yesterday," he said. "I heard it's going to be a boy. S' that right?"
Draco held up his hand and pressed his thumb to that plump lower lip of Potter's mouth. It seemed like all acting was impossible from now on. "Why did you ask me here?"
Molly Weasley turned around at the sound of the Floo and gave a small screech of joy, "Harry, dear," she said and enveloped him in a bone-crushing hug. "How dare you stay away for so long? Didn't you think you'd be missed?"
