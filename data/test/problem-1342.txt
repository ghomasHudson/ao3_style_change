Standing next to him, Harry realized that Draco had grown taller since last seeing him, towering at least three inches above Harry. He shifted his weight uncomfortably.
Ron let out a long sigh. “Oh, fantastic. Training was great today. All of us shadowed an Auror for five hours as they worked on their cases, and it was bloody amazing. My Auror, Claire Parkins, she’s been working on trying to catch a dragon egg smuggler. I got to watch as she planned out a sting that’s taking place on Tuesday. Merlin, it was such a rush.”
“Trust me, the feeling’s mutual.” Draco paused. “But to answer your question, no. I never thought I would end up here.”
As dinner progressed, Harry couldn’t help but be overtly aware of how close he was sitting to Draco. It was nothing new; they’d been in such proximity plenty of times. However, he swore he could feel every one of Draco’s light exhales and polite laughs travel up his spine.
A thick silence fell over the table as they patiently waited. Harry could hear soft murmurs of discussion coming from the other side of the wall, but it was largely too quiet to make out.
After scrawling out a quick note saying it wasn’t an issue and that tomorrow would work perfectly fine, Harry resumed scarfing down his bowl of cereal and cup of coffee. Casting a
Once having landed on Inis Mór, they Apparated to a small village located on the northwest part of the island. As they gathered their bearings, dusting off any dirt from their particularly uneasy landings, Harry realized that they were standing in front of a long gravel driveway. In the distance, he could make out a large white farmhouse nestled in between luscious green hills that were dotted with sheep and cows. The rain had turned into a steady downpour, and there was a fierce wind blowing bitterly from the north. Harry watched longingly as plumes of black smoke rose from the house’s chimney.
Harry paused when he reached Malfoy’s quarters, which were located next to the Potions classroom. He raised his fist, about to knock, when the door opened. Standing in front of him was Malfoy, who looked just as sleek as he always did. His ashy blond hair was combed back neatly, although not with mountains of gel, and his pale cheeks had a pink tinge to them, as though he’d been exerting himself—packing, most likely. And, as much as Harry restrained himself from doing so, he couldn’t help but let his eyes wander over Malfoy, who was dressed in an olive-colored jumper and black trousers that fit him alarmingly well.
Harry took in a deep, shuddering breath. “Have you ever felt tethered to someone, as though there was a string connecting the two of you together? It’s like I’m on a yarn winder, and no matter how fast or slow I’m spinning, the other person is winding the exact same way.”
They began to run down the driveway, Harry occasionally skidding on the slick gravel. By the time they made it to the front of the house, they were both completely soaked through. As Harry led the way up to the porch and knocked, Draco cast a Drying Charm on them. A wave of relief immediately washed over Harry, and he no longer felt as though he was freezing from the inside out.
Andromeda turned around, greeting Harry with a sad smile as tears leaked down her face. “Hi, Harry. As you can see, we’re running a little behind.”
Later that evening, as the sky faded from a brilliant blue to a soft lilac and a cool breeze whistled through the trees, Harry politely excused himself from a tedious and unwanted conversation with Chester Davies about Ministry accounting. He quickly passed by people who were mingling by the fire pit and took a path that headed east out of the camp.
“Morning,” the host said before glancing down at his watch. “Or, rather, good afternoon, since it’s almost noon. How many?”
Harry bit his bottom lip in an attempt to hide his grin. “Some real character development going on, I see.”
Stockinette cocked her head before silently agreeing that breakfast would do, promptly jumping off the bed and heading in the direction of the kitchen.
Andromeda kissed Teddy on the cheek before looking back to Harry, a sad smile on her lips. “Now, enough about the Black antics. Tell me more about what you’ve been up to in the past month. Have you taken a fancy to anyone?”
Draco was looking around, his eyes finally landing on Harry. They exchanged a brief smile, and Harry beckoned him inside. As Draco entered the shop, the small bell above the door went off, and Harry sighed with content at the fact that he had stopped by for a visit.
“Are you really surprised?” Ron asked, raising an eyebrow. “I mean, you were kind of obsessed with him when we were younger. Need I remind you that you spent the entirety of sixth year watching his footprints on the Marauder’s Map?”
Draco looked around, pursing his lips in thought. “How about we start here and work our way around the first floor?”
It wasn’t until Draco’s lungs recovered a bit that he turned to Potter and spoke. “I think we should go with a cream color for your master bathroom since it has so much natural light. We’ll get you a lovely clawfoot tub, these gorgeous tiles that I’ve been dying to use, and a walnut double-vanity to match the buffet out here and your bed frame.”
“I―” Harry began, his tongue suddenly feeling dry and far too large, “I didn’t know you worked here. Why … why
Except that Harry didn’t want that to be it. He wanted so desperately for Draco to be coming over to his flat for a nice, romantic evening filled with dinner, drinks, and cuddling under one of the many knitted blankets Molly had made for him over the years. He yearned for the ability to look at Draco and know that he was cared for.
Malfoy shifted forward slightly, and then Harry could feel the tip of Malfoy’s index finger breaching his hole, pushing past his tight ring of muscle. He settled into the slight but familiar burn, and it wasn’t long before Malfoy was one, two, three knuckles deep, gently thrusting forward until it was time to add a second digit, and then a third. Harry could feel himself coming undone, a warm fire building in his abdomen as Malfoy picked up the pace, curling his fingers upwards so that their tips grazed his prostate. He pressed back onto Malfoy’s fingers, craving more.
After giving Stockinette one final scratch, Harry followed. A brief moment later and he was stumbling out of Grimmauld Place’s sitting room fireplace. The sweet smell of cinnamon, oranges, and baked apples hit him as he looked around, searching for a glint of blond hair.
“Fucking hell.” Draco stared at his cappuccino, his heart thudding heavily against his chest. “Fucking
Draco, who had gone bright red in the face, let out a light laugh. “I know it’s not necessarily good, but I did try, so thank you for appreciating that.”
As he munched on a package of pretzels that he’d stored in the checkout counter, he found himself staring at the clock, counting the hours until he’d see Teddy and Andromeda.
McWeenie clapped his hands. “Excellent! See, there we are. Teamwork! Doesn’t it feel good? Right. Mr. Malfoy, if you would please stand in front of Mr. Potter, just like so …”
Draco immediately walked to the front window display. There, suspended in mid air, was the sleekest broom Harry had ever seen. The walnut colored wood was polished to the point where Harry could see his reflection in it, and the bristles that made up the tail end of the broom were neatly arranged to a point.
Twenty minutes later, Harry and Draco shrunk the two boxes to pocket-size and bid their goodbyes, promising to come back to the farm soon. As they made their way down the driveway, Harry felt a twist of dread in his stomach. He wasn’t ready for today’s adventure to be over.
Pulling back just enough so that they could look at each other again, Draco reached up and gently took off Harry’s glasses, placing them on the table. “Now you can.”
“Have you ever thought about reconnecting with Narcissa?” Harry asked, a spark of inspiration igniting inside him. “You know, I could always talk to Malfoy about arranging a visit ―”
As they continued their walk, Harry chose to not point out the fact that Draco easily could have cast a Heating Charm instead.
Knitting had been far more difficult than Harry had expected. In fact, he was tempted to quit altogether. After placing the dishes in the sink and casting a
Harry anxiously glanced at his watch for the fifth time in three minutes, his eyes then flickering to the front door of the shop. Outside, the morning was dark, quiet, and drizzly, the only semblance of light coming from floating, dimly lit lanterns that lined the cobbled alley.
As Harry took in Draco’s words, his heart began to sink. Ever since they’d planned to meet up last night, it was all he’d been thinking about. There was something so ridiculously charming about watching Draco desperately try to grasp different concepts and techniques, and knowing that he’d have to wait another day and a half sent a sharp pang of disappointment through his chest.
Draco grumbled throughout the entire trek, which took no longer than ten minutes. However, Harry had to admit that the wet soil and dew dropped grass of the field, in combination with the upwards climb of the hill and beginning of a rainstorm, was enough to make him a little grumpy.
Harry let out a weary sigh. “You two must have figured this out before tonight, since neither of you seem surprised.”
The journey to Wiltshire was full of bitter gusts of winds and stars twinkling above in the deep black sky. Harry’s gloved fingers were going numb, and no matter how many times he blinked, his eyes refused to stop watering. He had to admit that the ride was beautiful, though. Inner city busyness had quickly dissolved into quiet neighborhoods and eventually empty country roads that gave way to expansive fields, forests, and streams.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh at the berate of questions, racking his brain for ways to tell the truth without outright lying. “Yeah, he’s around my age, and he’s taller than me by about three inches. He’s got the
Harry let out a heavy sigh at McWeenie’s words. There were times when he wondered if he’d stood a chance with Malfoy, had they not hated each other in school, but doubt often overshadowed these thoughts.
go blaming me! You were the one who fell under me!” Draco huffed, standing up and brushing himself off before glancing around. “Potter,
“Listen, mate,” Ron said, scooting closer to Stockinette. “It’s not our fault you have a great cat.”
Several minutes passed, and Harry took a look around the table. Everyone seemed to be doing alright, even the seven-year-old who was there with his grandmother. While some of the students, namely Mark, had managed to quickly pick up the flow of knitting and were flying through their rows, others were slower, going at their own pace. After having checked up on everyone, Harry finally let himself turn his attention to Draco, who was scowling at his knitting as he jammed the needles through the stitches on the first row, which everyone else had already managed to move past at this point.
“Midday?” Draco said before his demeanor changed, softening. “Mother will be very pleased to see you. I don’t doubt that she likes the way our Christmases are now, but I think she still winds up a bit lonely every year. I imagine you coming will make her day. Would ― would you be willing to stay for an hour or two? I realize you’ve got Christmas with the Weasleys, and I don’t want to interrupt that, but ―”
“Okay,” Harry said, clearing his throat awkwardly as he wandered to where Draco was standing. “Ready?”
Draco gave him a tight-lipped smile. “Thank you, Potter. We weren’t in love, which made it easier, I suppose.”
“Yes!” Hermione said, her eyes lighting up at the mention of work. “I’m Head of the Muggle Liaison Department, and it’s absolutely incredible. I’m at the forefront of making magic folk more comfortable with Muggles and their ways of life, which is beyond valuable. In fact, we’ve had a severe drop in crimes against Muggles in the last three years ―”
in the countryside. He had me play outside so that I couldn’t hear anything, and there were sheep. I went up to one, and the bastard jumped on me. I had hoof prints on my coat,” Draco said sourly.
She smiled softly at him, moving her hand to rest on Harry’s shoulder. “Ron’s heating up dinner. Molly made chicken soup tonight. Figured it’d be easy on your body.”
To everyone who's commented saying that crafting/knitting/crocheting is what gets you through your own mental health issues, I can't describe how beyond grateful I am to have been able to share a fic that mirrors your experience. To everyone who's taken an interest in knitting or crafting since having posted this story, I'm thrilled for you! I can't knit to save my life, but I do see the joy that it brings my wife and hope you're able to experience the same thing. And lastly, for anyone who read this just because, thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking a leap on such a weird post-war drarry fic.
Trudging back through the shop and onto the ladder, Harry let out a long sigh, willing Draco to get here soon.
He led Draco towards the back end of the shop, stopping in front of a cubby hole filled to the brim with colorful skeins of yarn, all of their labels reading
Because why would Harry ever love him? Although Draco had redeemed himself to some extent over the five years that had passed since the Battle of Hogwarts, there was no denying that people still associated him with his past. The dirty looks and open stares from strangers were enough of an incentive to avoid going out in crowded areas unless absolutely necessary. Even if Harry
“Really?” Andromeda asked, running a hand anxiously through her neatly styled hair. “He’s in a bit of a mood, Harry. I’m alright to finish getting him ready.”
By the time noon rolled around, Harry had squared away most of the new inventory and had pulled a chair to the front of the shop, watching a thunderstorm roll in across the bruised sky as he worked on his gloves.
Eventually, his eyes landed on Draco, who was scowling at his knitting. Harry’s heart leapt into his throat, and he could feel his pulse everywhere. He knew he’d desperately missed Draco over the past few days, but seeing him now, directly in front of him, was somehow indescribable. Perhaps it was because Harry knew what his lips were like, soft and sweet, or the way that Draco’s hair was perfect for running his fingers through.
“I’m sorry about Kingsley,” Harry said, frowning, “although I’m sure he’s been good for business. Is there anything I can do to help?”
Harry gasped at the cool air meeting his exposed skin as his clothes vanished, and Malfoy wasted no time in climbing onto the bed and straddling him. Harry’s hips bucked upward slightly, desperate for relief.
“Oh!” Andromeda said, clasping her hands together in excitement. “Tell me all about him, then! Is he your age? What does he look like?"
Harry stood back as Colette made her way into the room, choosing to perch on the edge of his bedside table. Her cream colored feathers were once again slick with rain water, which she promptly shook off to the best of her ability. Harry grimaced as water flew everywhere, including his glasses, and untied the letter from her ankle. The sight of Draco’s handwriting made his heart flutter, although, at the same time, he found himself feeling rather anxious.
“Well,” Ron said, peering around, “I’d like to try to find a present for Harry, so I think it might be best if we split up.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, Potter. Really. Although don’t let this go to your head. You’re still a wanker.”
Draco took a step back before sinking to his knees. The sight alone nearly sent Harry over the edge, having wishfully played this scene over and over in his head for the past few weeks. He’d never thought that they would actually be here, in his flat, having sex.
“Like.” Harry let out a heavy sigh. “You and me. Roommates. Friends. I think my younger self would be horrified if he could see us now.”
“That’s ridiculous, Potter,” Draco began, trying to keep a straight face. “I certainly don’t need help with that blasted
Harry nodded. Either he got up now and barely made it onto the train, or he stayed and mustered up the courage to do something.
“Alright, everyone!” McWeenie said as he dabbed a handkerchief to his bald head, which was moist with sweat. “Listen up. As you know, this weekend is all about building trust and unity between departments. What better way to do this than with games? Let’s have some fun with this!” McWeenie paused, clearly waiting for some type of reaction. He received none. “Wow,
Ron and Hermione were both alarmed at the rate of Harry’s decline, upping their visits to everyday after work and training. Hermione was the only one who could coax him out of bed, whispering soft words of encouragement as she would help him down the stairs and into the living room. Then, they would spend hours sitting there, Ron and Hermione filling the air with anything they thought would cheer Harry up.
Draco snorted. “Unless you count eating dinner with my mother as ‘plans,’ then that would be a very hard no.”
Draco frowned. “I remember visiting her as a child, although the memories are a bit blurry. She would always put out cauldron cakes for me. Why?”
“I thought you and your Mum could use a bit of company this afternoon,” Harry said, smiling softly at him.
“Merlin, I hope so,” Oisín said, gesturing for them to follow. “This way. Your boxes are in our office.”
“It took Mother some convincing. When I told her, she became pretty upset and refused to talk with me for a week. I’d practically given up when she suddenly came to me, apologizing for how she reacted. She told me that while she was still not sure about it, she’d love and support me no matter what,” Draco said.
After Oisín cleared the table with a wave of their wand, the four of them exited the house via the back door. The rain hadn’t relented in the hour that had passed, and a crack of lightning lit up the charcoal colored sky.
Surrounded in the darkness, Harry truly had no semblance of where he was. It was nice, to some degree, being able to imagine that he could be anywhere in the world. However, the more he thought about it, the more he realized that he could care less where he was, as long as he was with Draco.
Harry’s heart dipped at the mention of Sirius. Teddy only had a vague knowledge of who Sirius was, although Harry knew that Andromeda was planning on telling him about how important Sirius was to Remus soon enough.
“Listen,” Draco began, his gaze shifting from Ron to Hermione, “I … I’d like to apologize. Formally, I mean. I was awful to you both, and no matter how much I wish I could take every vile thing I said back, I know that I can’t. It’s taken years for me to fully own up to my decisions, and now that I have … well, please know that I am very, truly sorry for the years of bullying and all of the hurt I caused. I'm not expecting to be forgiven. I just … wanted you to know.”
“ —so I suppose those things qualify me as a happy individual.” He chose not to mention his heartache. “What about you?”
Before Ron could wander off, Harry beckoned for him to come closer, whispering, “what the hell was that about?”
Draco let out a heavy breath. “I’ve just ― well, have you ever had that feeling where you’re just not good at anything?”
“Well,” Ron said, standing up, “I should probably go make sure that the spoon I charmed is still stirring the stir fry. I’ll be right back.”
Harry snorted as he dropped his things off on the kitchen counter and walked into the living room. “Yeah. I’ve got to say, it’s bloody convenient. Now, feel free to take a seat on the couch. They won’t be able to see you from there.”
“Good,” Harry said, letting out a heavy sigh. “Stressful, but good. Thank you both for putting a good word in for Draco, by the way.”
Harry sucked in a sharp breath, not having expected such a steep price, but paid it nonetheless. He’d pay anything to see the smile that he knew would appear on Molly’s face when she saw the bouquet.
“Well, to create ribbing you use a knit stitch and a purl stitch, which is just another basic stitch. Sometimes the pattern will say ‘knit one, purl one,’ and other times, like with the neckline of my jumper, it’ll tell you to ‘knit two, purl two.’ I’ll teach you how to purl as soon as you finish your scarf,” Harry said.
Harry cleared his throat, unsure if he should elaborate further or not. After a moment of decidedly awkward silence, he opted for moving on.
Harry blinked, his eyes adjusting to the pale, early morning light streaming in through the crack in the white cotton curtains. He rolled to the other side of the bed, stretching to grab his wand from the nightstand and lazily casting
Draco sighed, absently resting his fork on his plate. “Lots of pine and holly wreaths, for starters. We’re also in charge of procuring and decorating the Christmas tree that’s to go in the center of the ballroom. We’ll have to
After everything had been turned on and Hermione had raised the shades in the front windows, the three of them went about quickly organizing the large cubby holes lining four of the six walls forming the shop’s hexagon shape, all of them filled to the brim with various types of yarns. On the fifth wall sat racks upon racks of knitting needles and crochet hooks, as well as cords, felting needles, and cloth project bags. Around the shop, sample knits of scarves, shawls, jumpers, and hats were levitating on display, as well as several yarn winders magically spinning on their own. Towards the back, where the check-out counter sat, were a few bookcases pushed against the sixth wall, fiber arts magazines and pattern books written by renowned crafters neatly lining them.
“Yep. Follow me,” Draco said, steering his broom so that he was facing west. “It’s an hour ride to Wiltshire.”
After a moment of reasoning with both Ron and Hermione, the latter had finally relented on the sole condition that she received weekly batches of biscuits. Ron, of course, had been happy to oblige.
“Don’t worry. It won’t,” Harry said, shooting him a reassuring smile. “Well, we should probably get going. I just need to grab Stockinette.”
“You’re telling me,” Draco wheezed, “that eleven-year-old you was so determined to convict me that you brewed Polyjuice Potion and snuck into the common room as my bloody best friends.”
Ten minutes later, the bouquet was ready. It was filled with bright orange and pink flowers, which paired nicely with the paleness of the eucalyptus leaves and baby’s breath. A cream satin ribbon had been tied neatly around the stems, which were held in place by a plastic bouquet covering. It looked right up Molly’s alley, which made Harry feel thrilled.
“Well, why don’t the three of you take a seat at the dining room table while Draco and I finish up dinner?” Narcissa asked, standing up so that she was only a few steps away from Andromeda.
Before Harry’s mind could churn any further, he felt something soft move against his leg. Opening his eyes, which were blurry with tears, and looking down, he saw that Stockinette had come out from her box and was now nuzzling him. He smiled softly, wiping his nose on the back of his hoodie sleeve before bending down to give her a thorough pet. Although he’d never trained her in any capacity to sense when he was beginning to disassociate, Stockinette had somehow managed to pick it up, never failing to ground him.
Draco looked down at him, frowning. “I’m perfectly capable of paying for my own order, thank you very much.”
After a few minutes of listening to Teddy explain his Crayola crayons coloring methods, Andromeda walked back into the room, two filled wine glasses in hand, and sat down on the couch next to Harry.
“Being honest with you … is something I can change right here, right now.” Harry sucked in a deep breath. “So, I love you; I have for a while, now. It’s okay if you don’t feel the same—I’m expecting you don’t. And I understand if you no longer want to be roommates or friends. It’s just that, well, I’ve been trying to figure out how to tell you for months, and this seemed like the perfect time.
“I forgot to ask, do you need to write your mum letting her know you won’t be home for dinner?” he asked.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut, jagged memories filled with Hermione’s screams as she was tortured by Lestrange piercing the quiet air, and Draco’s note fluttered to the floor.
“It’s your decision, Draco. Either you drink it, or you don’t. Just know that I won’t be there to listen to your complaining if you don’t at least
“Alright,” he began, letting Stockinette twist out of grasp, “feel free to have a seat on the couch while I get the menu.”
“Luck? Pans, I don’t—” Draco paused, his stomach twisting into tight knots as he looked at Pansy, his cappuccino, and back again.
“Great. Now these,” Hermione said, picking up the two wooden sticks, “are called knitting needles. I’m sure you’ve seen Molly use them before. Knitting needles also come in different sizes, which are measured in millimeters. The needles are what you knit with, so don’t lose them.”
“Oh. Alright. I’ve been eager to meet Teddy,” Draco said, a blush spreading across his face as he admitted this.
“Yeah, sounds good,” Harry said, nodding. “By the way, how would you feel about me dropping by on Christmas Day to give you your presents?"
“Um. Hello,” Narcissa said, fidgeting with the hem of her grey jumper as she took a few hesitant steps forward. “This must be Edward, although I understand that he prefers to go by Teddy.”
The evening sky was painted a liquid gold, and there wasn’t a single cloud in sight. Thanks to the heatwave that had been rolling over most of Europe, the August air smelled like sunbaked grasses and wild snapdragons that grew off the side of the road. Although the day had been warm, a cool breeze had picked up. Draco inhaled deeply, savoring the moment.
, did he love that smile. And there was something about the way he stumbled out of his room in the morning and into the kitchen, eyes barely open as he murmured a sleepy hello before making himself a cup of coffee, that caused Draco’s heart to skip a beat or two.
“I suppose,” Draco said sheepishly. “I’ve never had a thing, you know? Something that’s a part of me.”
“No harm done,” Draco said dismissively. “Harry and I know each other from Hogwarts. We were in the same year, although we’ve only recently become friends. Where did you go to school?”
“Despite the fact that Malfoy is an annoying prat, I’m still your wingman,” Ron said hastily, winking before following Hermione towards the staircase.
Ron also took a seat, pulling a chair next to where Hermione was sitting and taking her hand in his. Harry swallowed thickly, willing the tension in the room to disperse, even if only a little. He had gone into this knowing it would take some time for the three of them to get comfortable with each other, but now that they were actually in the process, Harry desperately wished they could skip this awkward beginning.
As the blistering summer of 1999 vanished into crisp autumn, Harry’s health took a turn for the worse. His days were filled with fits of crying, vomiting, and convulsions as he lived through memories that he didn’t particularly care to remember. He no longer knew what day it was, never mind what month, and he would occasionally find himself in places of the house that he couldn’t recall walking to. His nights weren’t any better, as sleep rarely came to him, and he more often than not spent the quiet hours before dawn sitting numbly in front of the telly that he had purchased the year before.
After thirty antagonizing minutes of back-and-forth regarding where to eat, the four of them finally landed on a relatively new Italian restaurant, owned by a well-regarded witch, near Flourish and Blotts. Once Stockinette had been adequately pet, coats and scarves had been put on, and Harry and Draco’s purchases had been snuck out of Hermione’s bag, they were off.
“I’m going to go get it. Be right back,” Hermione said, standing up and walking out of the dining room.
“Alright. See how I can’t get my needle through the stitch because it’s so tight? However, if I hold it like this,” Hermione said, adjusting her grip, “it works much easier. It’ll still be a little tense due to the fact that your other stitches are so tight, but it should get better. Can you see the difference?”
Stockinette followed him to the door, her paws pitter-pattering across the wood. Harry unlocked the door and was met with a grinning Hermione and a half-asleep Ron.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, I started thinking about it while we were still at Hogwarts. After the war, though … I decided that route wasn’t for me. I needed to find something that didn’t revolve around adrenaline and vigilance.”
Harry could feel his cheeks burning as he took the bouquet. “Well, thanks for the flowers. Oh, and are you still living at the Manor?”
“How’d you like to come with me on an errand tomorrow?” Harry asked, having barely processed the words before they were out in the open.
After washing his hair twice, he decided he’d stalled enough, begrudgingly turning off the shower head. As soon as he stepped out, he was hit with a wave of bitterly cold air, and his wet skin immediately broke out in goosebumps. Once he’d scurried to wrap himself in a towel, he quickly cast a warming charm, bringing instant relief.
Rolling his eyes, Harry stocked off to the bathroom to take a quick shower before work. He savored the hot water flowing over him, his muscles stiff from the frigid morning air, and took his time lathering himself with an orange and cinnamon liquid body soap.
Harry couldn’t help but feel a surge of accomplishment, beckoning Draco to follow as he began walking towards the cubby holes against the wall. He then pulled out a light grey skein, holding it up for Draco to see.
Clearing his throat, Harry began, “so, Malfoy … I see you have some dropped stitches. Do you want any help ―”
Draco led them to the first stall, which was only a few feet to their left. A large shimmering banner above it read
on them, he wandered back through the dining room. Just as he was about to head upstairs, he turned, staring at his knitting on the table.
Harry wandered back to his bedroom, quickly grabbing the satchel sitting on top of his dresser before stuffing it with his wallet, keys, project bag filled with a pair of half-knitted gloves, and a small, mosaic brown and beige shawl in case the radiator in the shop decided to stop working for the thousandth time that winter. Once double-checking that he had everything, he headed towards the front door and was met with an incredibly familiar sight ― Ron and Hermione were taking turns giving Stockinette heaps of affection as they sat on the floor, their laughs echoing off of the thin walls of the flat.
Draco let out a long sigh. “It went well overall, although it left Mother frantic. A woman who works at the Ministry ordered five-hundred white roses for her daughter’s seventeenth birthday, which was today. Why this woman thought that putting an order that large in only twenty-four hours in advance was socially acceptable is beyond me, but … Anyway, once we’d managed to transfigure our entire stock of roses into white, we began to put together the different arrangements that the woman had ordered ― bouquets, wreaths, sculptures, the whole lot. We didn’t finish until one a.m. Then, this morning, we had to transfer all of the arrangements to the woman’s house and set all of it up around the dining hall. Needless to say, my mother and I are both a little tired.”
idea!” Harry said, rolling his eyes as he stepped down from the ladder. “So, what can I help you with?”
“Of course. I just need to lock up the shop and then we can head upstairs to my flat. Sound good?” Harry asked.
“Well, their names are Draco and Narcissa Malfoy. Narcissa is Granny’s sister, and Draco is her son. Granny hasn’t seen either of them in a very long time, so tonight’s very special,” Harry said gently.
Brushing himself off as he stepped into the large drawing room, Harry took a look around. While the layout was seemingly the same, it appeared as though Narcissa had spent the past few years doing a major overhaul of the place. The cold, grey wall color had been stripped, and in its place sat Victorian turquoise and gold wallpaper. A large twelve light crystal chandelier hung from the tall ceiling, sending a cascade of rainbow refracted light across the room. Even the furniture had been replaced with a comfortable looking, chartreuse colored velvet couch and several sitting chairs that matched.
After pouring a moderate amount of kibble into Stockinette’s food bowl and setting it on the ground, Harry went about making his own breakfast. While waiting for his coffee to percolate, he quickly whipped up an omelette stuffed with bell peppers and shredded cheese. Once his cup of coffee had been made, four teaspoons of sugar and a generous amount of milk, he took a seat at the round kitchen table.
Raising his wand, Harry cast the incantation for the Disillusionment Charm. After a moment of rearranging, Draco’s face looked similar yet slightly off. His eyes were no longer a deep grey but instead a bright blue, and his now shoulder-length hair was a much darker shade of blond. His nose, which was ordinarily long and thin by all accounts, had morphed into a button shape, giving him the illusion that he was an entirely different person altogether.
Harry did, and what he saw was breathtaking. A glittering black pond shone below, it’s glassy waters reflecting silver drops of moonlight. Surrounding the pond was a perimeter of pine trees, whose bodies cast long shadows over the earth.
During the time they’d spent living together, Draco had managed to become completely immersed in Harry’s life. He participated in holidays at The Burrow, drinks with Seamus and Dean every other Friday, and bi-monthly dinners with the Granger-Weasleys at their new cottage, which was where they were heading home from now.
, just as Ron had Hermione, or how Bill had Fleur. He wanted to know what it was like to take a chance.
Just as Harry had taken a seat at the kitchen table with a bowl of Frosted Flakes, he heard a soft rapping on the living room window. Startled, he stood up and wandered into the room, finding himself looking at Colette hovering outside the window. Harry’s curiosity was immediately struck, wondering why Draco would be writing to him when they’d planned to see each other for knitting lessons that night.
“Oh Merlin, Potter. I’m so close,” Malfoy babbled, his voice raw as his movements became more erratic. “I’m so fucking close. Nearly there. Nearly there,
“So,” Harry said, pulling out an autobiographical recounting of time travel, “what are your Christmases like?”
Five minutes later, he slung his satchel over his shoulder and picked up a protesting Stockinette before making his way down the stairs and into the back room of the shop. Then, he went about setting everything up as quickly as possible, opening the front blinds, unlocking the door, turning on the Christmas tree and toy train, casting the Snowfall Charm in the front window, and putting on holiday tracks that began with Andy Williams’
“Like I just kicked a kitten. Drink your hot chocolate and stop pouting,” Draco said, taking a long sip of his Butterbeer.
“Hey, where’s Malfoy?” he asked, causing Hermione to stop and take notice of Draco’s absence as well.
“In that case—” Potter pushed Draco up against the nearest wall and slotted his leg between Draco’s thighs. “—I guess you could say that the rumors are true.”
It had been a long while since Harry had kissed anyone, instead spending his years recovering and working on himself. However, for the past year, he’d found himself hopelessly chasing the idea of being swept up in a whirlwind romance, dreaming endlessly of the idea of love. And now that it was Christmastime, the world seemed to possess just a fraction more magic than usual, making it all seem so irresistible.
“Of course. Come on,” she said, looping her arm through his, “let’s get you downstairs. Ron’s dying to tell you how his training went today.”
“I’m fine, Sir. Really,” Malfoy said, dusting off the seat of his pants as he shot daggers in Harry’s direction.
“Alright. Do you do a lot of business with them?” Draco asked, not batting an eye at Oisín's pronouns.
Grabbing the remote off of the coffee table, Harry flicked the television on, surfing through the channels and eventually landing on
Draco sighed as he set down his knitting and placed Stockinette in his lap. “Alright. I’m on board.”
Walking into the living room, he could see Ron, who was half-asleep, curled on the couch with Hermione, who was engrossed in her latest read,
“Well,” Harry said, glancing down at his wristwatch, “I was planning on closing up for lunch while I grab something at Florean’s. If you want to join me, we can talk about a schedule there.”
Two hours later, they were woken abruptly by the sound of McWeenie’s loud, obnoxiously enhanced voice echoing across the camp, calling everyone to the fire pit immediately. After scrambling to look as though they had, indeed,
“Oh. Well, I think Mother misses her. She’ll sometimes tell me stories from her childhood while we make flower arrangements, and she always seems to talk about Aunt Andromeda with fondness. I think they were rather close when they were younger,” Draco said.
Harry sighed, setting down his knitting on the table. “I ... don’t know. I’ve never given it much thought, I guess. It’s like there’s this bind between my fingers, the yarn, and my needles. Knitting is something I don’t need to think about. It just is.”
“Alright. This way,” the host said, leading them past the glass case nearly overflowing with baked goods and into the sitting area, which was filled with tables and booths.
Except for the fact that there was, indeed, a note with Malfoy’s loopy cursive in his hand—a note requesting his presence in Malfoy’s room, despite the fact that the Hogwarts Express would be leaving from Hogsmeade Station in an hour. Harry swallowed hard, his eyes tracing Malfoy’s words until they lost meaning.
“One last shag,” Malfoy murmured, their lips brushing. “One last fuck before we go. That’s what I want to give you.”
Days eventually turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and months turned into a little over a year and a half of pure, unadulterated torment. Before Harry knew it, he’d turned nineteen, time slipping through his fingers in a blur. He was absolutely miserable; he hadn’t had a proper night’s sleep in Merlin knows how long due to the painstakingly cruel nightmares that visited him every time he went to bed, he looked sickeningly thin from his lack of appetite, and he rarely felt any motivation to leave the house.
Malfoy nodded as he got up from the bed and began to put his clothes back on. “Come to the Manor on Sunday. Meet my mother. Eat dinner with us.”
Harry couldn’t discern who started it, but suddenly Draco’s lips were on his and it was if everything had fallen into place. The kiss was warm, and Draco tasted like the salted caramel hot chocolate he’d ordered at Anise Café. And his arms ―
Teddy immediately ran over to Harry, who stood up and enveloped him in a fierce hug, lifting him up and swinging him in a circle before setting him down. He then greeted Andromeda, giving her a tight squeeze before briefly kissing her cheek.
With a final check of his watch, Harry stood up from where he’d been crouching next to Stockinette. He let out a heavy breath as he looked down at her, frowning as she butted her head up against his leg.
“Cissy,” Andromeda murmured, her eyes once again filling with pools of tears as she stared at her sister.
After scrawling a messy confirmation back, Harry sent Artemis on her way and settled back down onto the couch, where Stockinette wasted no time in slinking into his lap, staring up at him with her bright blue eyes.
“Morning,” Harry said, gesturing for them to come in. “I just need to grab a few things, and then I’ll be ready.”
Beside him, Hermione let out an irritated sigh as she adjusted her cross-body bag. Brows furrowed and lips pursed, it was clear that she was having about just as good of a time as he was. Rose’s first birthday was on Monday, meaning that Ron was now in charge of getting everything ready for the party. While Harry knew that Hermione fully trusted his capabilities as both a stay-at-home dad and a party planner, this didn’t stop her new-mom radar from needing to check her flip phone every five minutes to ensure that no one had burned the house down. Thankfully, Ron was proving to be very compliant with her needs, even if he wasn’t entirely sure how to use a mobile phone. More often than not, he ended up sending pictures of his thumb instead of Rose.
“Well, you don’t look particularly pleased by it,” Harry said, slightly annoyed. “I can just go if you’d prefer—”
Here it is! One of my favorite chapters! Whenever I would visit my wife in Dublin while we were long distance, we would hang out on Grafton Street, eat waffles at Gino's, and get lunch at Bewley's. They're some of my most treasured memories.
Mrs. Van Ness smiled. “Yes, and I’m looking for the yarn to be light green in color. My granddaughter just announced that she’s pregnant, and Merlin knows that I won’t get the blanket done unless I start now.”
By the time six o’clock rolled around, Harry had flipped the open sign to close and let down the front blinds before locking the door. Once everything had been closed up for the night, he scooped up Stockinette, who was sleeping on top of a pile of alpaca skeins in one of the eye-level cubbyholes, and slung his satchel over his shoulder before exiting through the back room and heading upstairs.
Except that he couldn’t stop looking at Malfoy; not when McWeenie called out the last two people, or when he explained that they would be doing trust falls, or when everyone was instructed to spread out because they would be needing “ample room.” There was something about the way that the soft, golden afternoon light fell through the trees and cast shadows across Malfoy’s face that made Harry feel inexplicably warm inside.
“Well,” Andromeda said, pausing to blow her nose before saying, “people sometimes hurt on the inside, like when they get their feelings hurt or miss someone a lot. It’s like having an ouchie on your heart.”
As he went about procuring breakfast for both Stockinette and himself, he heard the Floo roar to life. Glancing at the clock, he felt his stomach twist.
Harry let out a content sigh, closing his eyes as he threw his arm limply over Draco’s stomach. “I love you too.”
“You two absolutely spoil her,” Harry said, grinning as he slung the satchel over his shoulder and pushed up his round glasses.
And with that, McWeenie rushed towards the center of camp without so much as a glance behind him. Harry turned to Malfoy, whose face was now a shade of bright red, and winced.
“Don’t be,” Draco said, stepping forward and putting a hand reassuringly on Harry’s shoulder. “I just want to make sure you’re alright.”
Before Draco could say anything, a loud whooshing sound came from behind them. Draco took a step back in surprise, and Harry could immediately feel the absence of warmth from Draco’s hand on his shoulder. Turning around, he saw Andromeda and Teddy stepping out of the Floo.
Ron, from his corner of the couch, yawned before closing his eyes and leaning his head against a pillow. “Morning.”
A moment later, Draco opened the door and Harry felt all of the oxygen in his lungs evaporate. Wearing a plum colored jumper and charcoal colored trousers, he looked like the Draco that Harry had come to love. The sheer sight of him was enough to bring Harry an indescribable amount of comfort, as though he’d just stumbled upon the one thing he’d spend his entire life looking for.
“Yeah, it is. I’ve never been here in the winter, so this is my first time seeing the decorations. They’re amazing,” Harry said.
Draco rolled his eyes, shoving Harry lightly on the shoulder. “Fuck off. Now, where’s my breakfast?”
“Oh?” Andromeda said, setting down her glass of water and holding her arms open for Teddy as he wandered towards her.
It had been six days since they’d kissed, and Harry hadn’t heard a word since. He’d been so sure that their time together had ended on a positive note, as Draco has given Harry a sleepy peck before stepping into the Floo after he’d woken up from his accidental nap. However, with the awkward radio silence that had since ensued, he was no longer so sure that things were alright between them. When he’d confided in Hermione and Ron about the predicament, they’d assured him that Draco probably just wanted to take things slow. Unfortunately, this did little to ease Harry’s worries.
“Fuck, Malfoy,” Harry panted, tugging Malfoy’s jumper over his head to expose pale soft skin covered in scattered clusters of beauty marks. “I didn’t think I’d see you again until after term resumed.”
“Potter, we’ve barely begun to get to know each other again. Why is it that you so desperately want for me to get along with them?” Draco asked.
Harry’s stomach sank, and he instinctively looked towards Malfoy, whose mouth had curled into a severe frown. All at once, they both began to fervently protest.
Once they’d landed and brushed off any stray, frozen soil that had skidded up during impact, Harry looked to Draco. His cheeks and nose were bright red from the cold, and his hair was slightly mussed from the wind as he looked around and let out a heavy sigh.
As soon as he was free of the conversation, Harry wandered over to Draco, Ron, and Hermione, who were in the middle of discussing where to begin.
Draco raised an eyebrow in amusement as he began to gather his things. “My, my, Potter. That fond of me already?”
Draco let out a heavy sigh. “Yeah, and overwhelming, I suppose. She looks much older than I remember, although she’s just as kind. And Teddy is rather amusing, isn’t he? I’d like to show him the albino peacocks when it’s not so dark out. I’m sure he’d like them.”
Stockinette’s food in hand, Harry wandered into the living room. As soon as he caught sight of Draco, his heart leapt into his throat.
“Hey,” Harry began, taking a seat next to Draco. “It’s going to be alright. This is a do-over, a clean slate. And if you’re going to be lurking around the shop, you might as well get to know Ron and Hermione, you know? Plus, Hermione was the one who taught me how to knit, so she might be of some use when it comes to teaching you.”
They pulled back a few minutes later, and Harry shifted so that his head was resting on Malfoy’s shoulder. The sky was now a dusty blue with a burst of orange lining the horizon as the last sliver of sunlight slowly faded away.
They continued on to a stall that consisted of hand-blown glass sculptures. Harry’s eyes immediately went to an amber colored sculpture in the shape of a Snitch. Just as Harry reached to pick up the Snitch, Draco did the same. Their hands brushed, Draco’s skin warm and soft, and Harry was entirely lost. The moment hung suspended in air, Christmas carols and loud chatter fading into the background, and for the second time that night Harry felt the urge to hold onto whatever this was for as long as possible.
With one final thrust, Malfoy was coming, emptying himself into Harry before collapsing on top of him. The room stilled, the only sounds being their heavy breaths and the rain that was falling in hard waves against the roof. The air smelled like sex and sweat, just as it always did.
Harry looked up from the stove and was met with a smirking Draco. He looked just as smart as usual, a dark red collared shirt tucked neatly into charcoal colored trousers and a wool coat, and Harry immediately got the impression that he was underdressed, despite knowing that this was a casual occasion. However, he couldn’t help but look down at his own outfit, a deep brown turtleneck and form-fitting jeans with a hole in the right knee, with self-consciousness.
Draco hummed in thought as he read over his own menu. “The tomato soup with brown bread and butter sounds particularly lovely.”
“Okay, Stocky,” Harry began, immediately catching her attention. “I’ve got to go run an errand, but I’ll be back in a little bit. I’ve put your dinner out, and you’ve got fresh water. I’ll see you tonight, alright? We'll do big cuddles.”
Andromeda let out a heavy sigh, briefly closing her eyes. “You know, I just can’t find it in myself to fault Draco. Being brought up in such a harsh way … well, you know the effects it left on both Sirius and myself. I don’t blame him for having been horrible, no matter how much I want to. I suppose I can’t help but wonder if that’s how I would have ended up ― so young and so angry ― had things been different.”
Harry woke up to the sharp sound of something hitting against his bedroom window. As he groggily looked around, wiping sleep from the corners of his eyes, he realized that Colette, Draco’s owl, was directing rather impatient hoots his way. With a heavy groan, he reluctantly peeled back the covers and sat up, making sure to not disturb Stockinette, who was fast asleep on the other pillow. After a minute of adjusting to the frigid, early morning air, he slinked over to the window and let Colette in.
“Thank you, Draco,” Harry said, turning the cool glass over in his hands. “I absolutely love it, and it’s going right on my nightstand. Now, for your last present.”
“Draco …” Hermione began, setting her knitting on the coffee table and scooting closer to where he was sitting. “Can I make a suggestion?”
, Pansy,” Draco ground out. “I can’t just walk into his house and expect a shag because I’m feeling lucky. And Merlin’s tits—” He glanced down at his watch, which read ten minutes to nine. “—I have to be there in ten minutes.”
As Harry emerged back onto the bustling path, he thought about how he would have the opportunity to get to know who Malfoy was now, their schoolboy days long forgotten.
Wandering down the hall and to the bedroom, Harry couldn’t help but smile at the memory of seeing Draco’s progress on his scarf, it having looked so much like Harry’s very first project. The first thing he would need to go over with Draco would be the tension in his knitting. His stitches had been unfathomably tight, not uncommon for new knitters, and Harry had noticed that Draco had been having trouble slipping the stitches onto the needles because of it.
Malfoy followed suit, discarding Harry’s hoodie and T-shirt somewhere off to the right. Just as Harry was about to pull him in for another kiss, Malfoy stepped back, grabbed his hand, and led him to the bed, where he was pushed back onto it. Harry scooted up so that his head was level with the pillows before letting out a slow exhale. Still standing at the foot of the bed, Malfoy was undressing further, peeling off his trousers and pants. Harry stared, hungry eyes easily going to Malfoy’s cock, which was fully hard and flushed against his abdomen, leaking glistening precome onto his skin. Malfoy’s cock was beautifully thick with jutting veins running up the sides, the head deep pink. Harry swallowed hard at the sight of it—at knowing that he was moments away from feeling it, touching it, being fucked with it.
“Hey,” Harry said softly, placing his hand gently over Draco’s, “it’s okay. You explained that you were busy, and that’s all that matters.”
. I’d spent so long dividing the world into good and evil, and I was done with that. So, I turned them down.
Their movements weren’t rushed, instead coming together with a softness that Harry hadn’t expected. As their lips met, Harry could feel the rest of the world fall away. The only thing that mattered was right in front of him.
Draco stopped after a few minutes, pressing wet, open-mouthed kisses to Potter’s collarbones. “Need you inside me.
“They’re called Viridi Gigas,” Draco said, squinting up at the huge stalks, “and they’re one of my mother’s most prized possessions.”
“How would you feel about opening our presents in private?” Harry asked in a hushed tone as he grinned, leaning into Draco’s arm slung around his shoulder.
Realizing he didn’t recognize the owl, he stepped down the ladder and headed towards the front door, curiosity getting the best of him. After opening the door and beckoning the owl inside, her sleek feathers slick with rainwater, he swiftly untied the rolled piece of parchment tied to her ankle by a neat white ribbon and straightened it out in his hands.
Harry nodded as he forced a chuckle. “Yeah, I think I should limit the Snowfall Spell to the window display. So, any plans for the rest of the evening?”
Harry let out a soft laugh. “No, Ginny and I broke up shortly after the war. We decided that we were better off as friends. In fact, she and Luna have been together for well over three years now. Word has it that Luna’s bought an engagement ring, and she plans on proposing on New Year’s Day.”
Malfoy leaned forward, placing wet, open-mouthed kisses along Harry’s chest before pausing to look at him. “What do you want, Potter? Do you want me to fuck you? Is that it? I’ll open you up so well, Potter. I’ll go slow, working one finger at a time until you’re wet, and shaking, begging for more. You want that?”
As the three of them ate dinner, both Ron and Hermione finishing their bowls while Harry’s remained two-thirds full, Hermione cleared her throat.
crowd. Anyway, I’m about to split you off into partners. You’ll be working with your partner for the rest of the weekend — no ifs, ands, or buts! Let me just find the list …”
Harry looked up, startled, only to find Draco grinning very cheekily at him. However, he quickly recovered by snorting.
As quickly as he could, Harry dashed into the kitchen and pulled out the takeaway menu from the junk drawer next to the fridge. As he headed back to the living room, he felt eternally thankful that he’d managed to pick up the dirty laundry and stray shoes that had littered the ground surrounding the couch that morning.
Pansy leaned back in her wicker chair, clearly not bothered. “Where I got it is none of your concern, and I was
“Hi, Harry! Just changing Teddy’s shirt. We had a little chocolate milk accident,” Andromeda said, her voice coming from the direction of Teddy’s room.
Malfoy took a hesitant step forward—something so different from his usual cool and collected demeanor—and let his hands rest on Harry’s waist, pulling them close. Harry sucked in a sharp breath at the proximity, their lips nearly touching. He could feel Malfoy’s soft breaths against the skin on his neck, and he sank into the familiar scent of his orange and clove aftershave.
“Afraid not. Now, I know for a fact that you haven’t changed your pajamas in four days. How about we get you into a fresh pair?” Hermione asked.
“Do you honestly want to hear what a former Death Eater has been up to all these years?” Draco asked.
“Piss off. Now, how long until dinner? I’m famished,” Draco said as he stripped off his coat and levitated it to the coat rack in the entryway.
Pulling a face, Draco wandered over to the couch, taking a seat with a heavy sigh while Harry kneeled down in front of the fireplace. After quickly igniting a log, he stuck his head into the fireplace and placed his Fire-Call. After a moment, he could see the outline of Ron and Hermione’s faces poking through the embers.
Harry watched as Draco disappeared behind Narcissa into the next room, his gaze lingering only a moment too long before he got hold of himself and turned his attention to Teddy and Andromeda, who were seated opposite him.
“No, I think those years were important,” Draco murmured, looking down at their hands intertwined. “Without them, we wouldn’t be where we are.”
Harry thought ― felt strong and sturdy around his waist, reassuring him that Draco wasn’t going anywhere.
Harry grinned to himself, remembering the way that Draco’s face lit up while they were decorating the shop. “He’s a lot tamer, I think. He doesn’t seem quite so hard around the edges. At school, he was nothing but a pompous git that nobody ― especially me ― could stand. Now, though … now, he’s
“Sorry, Stocky. How about I make it up to you with some breakfast?” he asked, wincing as his bare feet touched the bitter coldness of the hardwood floor.
“Oh, Draco,” Hermione murmured, leaning into Ron, who was now standing next to her. “Thank you. I can’t tell you how much that means.”
Draco shrugged. “I’m not particularly interested in ruining perfectly nice clothing for a game of Quidditch. This is just what I wear when I garden with my mother.”
Once dressed, he ran a comb through his hair, although his black waves still sat at odd, unusual angles. After a minute or two he gave up, spraying himself with eucalyptus and pine aftershave. Then, giving himself a final once-over, he felt reasonably content and headed in the direction of the kitchen.
“It’s complicated, Ted. You remember us telling you about the war that hurt your mummy and daddy?” Harry asked, his chest tightening at the thought of Remus.
As he finally finished his dinner, there was a polite knock on his living room window. Looking up, he could make out Hermione’s soft, tufted brown owl through the frosty glass. He stood up with a sigh, his stomach feeling uncomfortably stretched, and wandered towards the window, opening it.
Ron awkwardly cleared his throat. “Yeah, I … I suppose that’ll be fine. But, if the Ferret utters a single word out of line, I swear ―”
Dinner had gone by surprisingly well, the conversation mostly consisting of small talk and pleasant inquiries about each others’ lives. Now, as they resumed sitting on the couch and the surrounding chairs, Harry watched as Draco tried desperately to pick up a stitch without dropping it. In the chair next to where Draco was seated on the couch sat Hermione, who was at the tail end of knitting her socks.
“Never pegged you as a cat person,” Harry said, entering the living room and taking a seat next to Draco.
“I see. Well, I think it’s a lovely sentiment, Potter,” Draco said, his cheeks flushing. “Actually, speaking of jumpers, how’s yours coming along?”
Draco’s shoulders dropped. “I don’t know, Potter. I haven’t practiced Potions in years. What if I’m pants at it?”
“― And I doubt you ever had a say in the matter. I just wish other people would realize that,” Harry said, muttering the last part as he averted his eyes.
Harry couldn’t help but smile, touched at how much Teddy cared for him. “Granny told me you named one of your dolls after me. Is that him?”
“Perks of being famous, I suppose,” Harry muttered. “I think I need some change in my life, but I’m not sure where to start.”
Once they’d paid, Amelia having taken Draco’s money with forced politeness, they went to the end of the counter and waited for their drinks to be made. Harry looked around, realizing that several people were staring at Draco, none of them hiding their discontent.
Harry grinned sheepishly, ducking his head as a crimson flush spread across his cheeks. “Yeah, they are. We went out to dinner two nights ago, and then I took Draco to see his first Muggle film ―
Harry rolled his eyes. “Don’t worry. I won’t leave you behind while I go to Ron and Hermione’s flat tomorrow.”
Malfoy’s hips jerked forward slightly before he pulled back, righting himself. “Fuck, sorry. Just—you feel so fucking good around me, Potter. So hot and tight.”
“Sounds good. I’m going to go with the yellow curry,” Harry said, knowing the menu by heart. “Do you want to split a plate of fresh spring rolls?”
“Of course,” Draco said, nodding anxiously. “Well, I’ve had a lovely time tonight. Thank you both so much for welcoming me into your home.”
Draco nodded. “That’s understandable. Why don’t you start with something non-work related? Something that seems manageable. Maybe you could try to accomplish it within the next day or two. I can help, if you need it. Just let me know—”
After a minute or two of silence, Draco looked up once again. “I think I’m going to get the pad thai.”
“I―yes, thank you,” Draco said, dumbfounded as his eyes flickered between Molly and Arthur, no doubt wondering how the hell Harry had managed to convince them to give up their Christmas afternoon.
“Listen, Stocky, I love you,” Harry said through a mouthful of curry. “I really do. But, there’s no way in hell you’re getting my dinner.”
“Narcissa would sneak off to visit me after I married Ted, bringing Draco along when he was born,” Andromeda said, leaning into the back of the couch. “She was the only one who missed me, I suppose. And each visit, for a few hours, the both of us were able to forget everything: my disownment, the war, her involvement with Voldemort. It was as though everything just fell away.”
They continued to chat as they walked, although Hermione’s mood only seemed to grow fouler as they neared their campsite. However, she was far from the only crotchety person in the group — many conversations could be heard criticizing not only the retreat itself, but the fact that McWeenie was forcing them to hike into camp the Muggle way to “build unity.”
As Harry lazily flicked through the television channels a few hours later, he found himself watching Draco fall asleep next to him, his soft breaths quickly turning into abhorrent snores. Harry had never pinned Draco as a snorer, although he supposed there were a lot of things he still had to learn about him.
Harry’s heart sank, his mind churning with ideas of who Draco was knitting the hat for. He and Parkinson had always seemed close during school, and he was nearly certain that they’d dated at some point. Perhaps it was a gift for her? Or, if not, some other person lucky enough to call Draco theirs.
I honestly don't know where to begin. I started working on TWWW in September on a whim, and while I enjoyed writing it, I was quick to assume that it would become a complete and utter failure - no kudos, no comments, no reactions at all. There were many times when I debated scratching the entire project, but my wife, along with Peachpety and Veelawings insisted I not. So I didn't, and I'm so glad.
After a moment of hesitation, Draco’s hand landed on a deep mustard colored skein with flecks of white and red in the wool. Harry grinned, that particular color being one of his favorites from the collection.
“I don’t know. We’re a few years out of Hogwarts and I still feel like I have no idea what I’m doing with my life.”
Harry gave him the go-ahead, and then he felt something cool against his arsehole. Draco’s index finger slowly pushed through his unworked ring of muscle, and he let out a sharp gasp, fisting the sheets. Although not exactly painful, it wasn’t necessarily comfortable, and Harry could feel a burning sensation surrounding where Draco’s finger was.
A few minutes later, Teddy with his bright turquoise hair emerged from the hallway, followed by Andromeda. Despite it having been several years since Harry had gotten to know Andromeda, he always managed to be surprised at how much she looked like Bellatrix Lestrange. They both had the same wild corkscrew curls, although Andromeda’s were a dark brown instead of jet black, and their eyes were the same shade of cool brown.
Just as Harry thought he’d caught a break, one of his regular customers, an older witch by the name of Mrs. Van Ness, insisted that she needed help in picking out wool that would be suitable for a baby blanket.
“Alright, well, my name is Mark Hurley, and I decided to join the workshop because I’ve always been a huge crafter. When I was little, my mum couldn't get the Crayola crayons out of my hands. Recently enough, I’ve taken an interest in fiber arts. I’ve taught myself how to felt in the last month, and I’m really hoping that this class will help me develop my knitting skills.”
“That’s the plan,” Draco said, his hand slowly snaking down to cup Harry’s bulge as their eyes made contact. “May I?”
Two more thrusts, and Draco was coming, his pleasure shooting hot and fast into Harry. As Draco began to slow, his cock growing limp, Harry fisted his own length a few more times before he orgasmed, semen spilling over his hand.
A deep blush crept up Draco’s neck, and he let out an embarrassed laugh. “Yeah. I could just see how much you loved it, and, well, I wanted you to have it.”
“Brilliant. So, what have you been up to since the war? Besides the flower arranging, I mean,” Harry asked.
“The trial. Yes, I’m well aware, Potter. Now, I need assistance, and I’d really rather it not come from you. Is there anyone else who works here?” Draco asked.
Absently tracing the stem of her wine glass with the tip of her index finger, Andromeda said, “it’s difficult to imagine a softer version of Draco. Even as a young child, he had a fierce temper and an even fiercer allegiance to his parents.”
Ron let out a heavy sigh as he collapsed onto the couch. “Dunno. Pizza kind of sounds good ― that Muggle place near here, what’s it called?”
Next to him, Harry had one hand loosely gripping the steering wheel of his Vauxhall Nova while the other tapped along to the rhythm of a Muggle song on the window ledge. His black waves, which always looked slightly unruly, were even more tousled from the car’s open windows. Golden shadows danced across his brown skin as the sun continued to sink.
At Hermione’s words, Harry took a seat on the couch, patting the space next to him. Draco cautiously followed, sitting down as though he was waiting for a bomb to go off. Since coming into the shop for the first time, Harry had only seen him this uptight when they’d gone to the ice-cream parlor.
“Shut up. No one will know about this,” Draco said, his eyes still glued to Stockinette as he scratched behind her ears.
While Hermione and Ron sat on the couch and amused Stockinette, Harry wandered back to his bedroom. There, he quickly changed out of the hoodie that he’d worn to the shop and pulled on a pine colored jumper that was donned with white and pastel blue stripes. As he quickly attempted to flatten his hair, which was curling in peculiar angles, he heard the Floo roar to life and Draco’s unmistakable voice.
Hermione picked up the skein of yarn and slipped the label off of it. “Well, since you’re making a scarf, I’m going to start you off with a simple cast on. Casting on is the type of stitch that you make in order to get the yarn onto the needles. There are dozens of different cast ons, but we won’t worry about those now. We’re going to begin by making a slipknot. So, take the tail of the yarn and hold it …”
, it took me forever to finally feel as though I was capable without Hermione’s supervision. As frustrating as it is, knitting is something that takes a lot of time and patience.”
“The Celer One-Thousand. Fastest broom of its kind. No one’s ever seen anything like it,” Draco said, mesmerized.
“I’ll always be yours, love,” Harry murmured, taking a step forward so that their bodies were fully flushed. “Always.”
Harry reached down, taking his own, heavy cock in hand and beginning to pump it up and down. Precome was leaking from his tip, and he could feel that he was growing close once again.
“I know you’re about to close,” Draco began, shifting his weight, “but I have a couple questions about knitting that I hoped you could answer.”
As he stepped into Andromeda’s living room, he spotted a large box of Cheerios upside down on the ground, sticky O’s littering the carpet. Figuring that Andromeda was helping Teddy get ready, he whipped out his wand and quickly cleaned the mess.
Harry nodded, smiling softly at him. “I’ve been in love with you for years, Draco. It just took you walking into my shop for me to realize it.”
Draco set down his knitting, which looked more disastrous than it had the last time Harry had seen it. “You too. Harry, I’m really sorry for not writing sooner. I didn’t mean to scare you; I just couldn’t find the time ―”
“Oh! Right. Well,” Harry said, pausing on the path and wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck, “I had a lovely time. Thank you for inviting me.”
“It’s perfect. Absolutely perfect,” Draco murmured, running his hands once more over its smooth surface before looking up, his gaze softening. “Never, in my wildest dreams, did I ever think that Harry Potter would be teaching me to appreciate the finer things in life.”
Draco began to toy with the hem of Harry’s jumper, lifting it up just enough to run his fingers over Harry’s hips and abdomen. Harry leaned into the touch as he broke their lips apart, instead leaving hot, open-mouthed kisses on Draco’s neck. Draco, in turn, began to card his fingers through Harry’s curls, desperately tugging their bodies together.
Looking at Draco, Harry swore he saw a hint of jealousy. It made sense, he supposed. The way Draco described his Christmases sounded very lonely, especially compared to the chaos that ensued every time the entire Weasley clan got together. Harry racked his brain for ways to remedy the sad look in Draco’s eyes, eventually landing on the fact that he would need to consult Ron and Hermione about it.
“I think so,” Draco said, setting his yarn on the table and fishing out the owed money from a small, expertly knit coin purse that only Narcissa could’ve made.
Harry swallowed thickly, the conversation suddenly turning somber. “You said that you hoped Hermione would be killed.”
Harry grinned as he tried to finagle the hat onto his head, only partly successful. “I love it, Draco, and I’m so proud of you for making it as well as you did. My first hat came out much worse than this. It’s just … thank you.
He rolled over, his body stiff from lack of movement, and watched as pale sunlight streamed through the window above his bed, catching on particles of dust floating through the air. He tensed, waiting to hear the sound of Hermione’s footsteps coming up the stairs. After a moment, the sound of the bottom step creaking echoed across the house, and Harry groaned, closing his eyes, hoping that he might convince Hermione that he was asleep.
Harry handed Draco a much slimmer package, wrapped in only tissue paper and a bow. He could feel anxiety working through his body as he watched Draco open it, his mind churning with doubt. At last, Draco unwrapped it, revealing the navy, cream, and lavender beanie that Harry had knit him. A medium white pom pom was attached to the crown, which bobbed around as Draco picked up the hat, running his fingers over the different stitches.
“At the beginning, yes,” Andromeda said, enveloping her arms around Teddy as he hopped up from the floor and crawled into her lap. “I was disowned by my family in 1972 when I announced my engagement to Ted, and Narcissa would visit me regularly for the first few years. However, by the time Draco was born, the visits had slowly begun to dwindle, and she only managed to make it over here once or twice a year. Then, the visits stopped altogether. I’ve always had a hunch that it was Lucius’ doing, but this is all speculation. Who knows, maybe he didn’t even know about the visits.”
Harry nodded enthusiastically as he scooted towards the headboard, resting his head on his pillow. “I’m sure.”
“Uh, yes. She finds it to be very therapeutic. That, and her arrangements are incredible. In fact, Kingsley often commissions her to put together arrangements for Ministry balls. If I remember correctly, there’s going to be one on the 22nd,” Draco said.
Draco let out a huffy, out of breath laugh as he tilted his head back. “Are you always this articulate?”
Amber shook her head. “Unfortunately not. We couldn’t find a babysitter for our toddler, so she’s at home. I’m sure she’s been roped into reading
“Well,” Draco began, “alright. That sounds fine. It’ll give me time to give you your presents, too.”
“Said he had to go back and get something. I see you were successful,” Harry said through a snort as he nodded in the direction of Hermione’s bag.
“Yeah. Well, they say you can knit anything as long as you’ve got the knit stitch and the purl stitch down,” Harry said, grinning.
Harry cleared his throat as he awkwardly pushed up his glasses in an attempt to distract from his embarrassment. “Y ― yes, all good. I’ll be down in a minute. This paper snowflake has been an absolute bastard.”
Before they knew it, an hour had passed and their arms were full of paper bags containing gifts. As they wandered towards the sitting room’s fireplace, Draco stopped short.
“Do the colors have names?” Draco asked, peering further into the box on the right and causing Harry to grin.
Grabbing the remote from its place on the coffee table, Harry leaned back into the couch and turned on the telly. As he flicked absently through the channels, he couldn’t help but feel disappointed that the Whomping Willow Woolery was closed, given that it was a Friday.
Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise. “Really? I’ve got a merchant here, so I’ve been a few times. It’s a beautiful city, and you’re going to love it. I’ve actually got a Muggle place for lunch in mind, if you’re interested?”
Teddy turned to Harry, a slight frown on his face. “Granny said we’re going to see some family that I’ve never met before.”
PS For the Draco hat that my wife and I are designing, I will be putting an update on my notes when it's finished! However, the most sure way for you to see the announcement is to follow me on Tumblr @thesleepiesthufflepuff. ALSO, I've already got plans in the works for a sequel next December, so this isn't goodbye. Not yet, anyway.
Harry, astounded, let out a bark of laughter. “You think I’m bad? You should’ve seen yourself. You spent more time trying to get up from the ice than you did skating on it!”
They quickly switched positions, Draco taking the wooden spoon while Harry popped the measuring cup into the microwave, and then they went to work.
Harry wandered back into the kitchen just as his two pieces of toast popped. Grabbing a stick of butter and a pot of raspberry jam from the fridge, he went about dressing the toast appropriately. Several minutes later, he returned to the living room with two plates and took a seat next to Draco on the couch.
As Harry frowned, not at all reassured by Ron’s words, Hermione walked back into the room carrying a plastic bag. Resuming her seat next to Harry, she began to pull the contents out of the bag and set them on the table. Harry raised an eyebrow.
As soon as Draco left an hour later, Harry pulled out a piece of parchment and a black gel pen, not bothered to go to the trouble of using a quill, and began scribbling a note to Narcissa.
“I’m honestly not sure,” Harry said, sighing as he leaned into the back of the couch, “and I can’t exactly go up to him and say, ‘hey, two questions. One, are you queer? And two, want to go on a date with me?’ while he’s shopping for yarn.”
Draco raised his eyebrows as curiosity set in behind his eyes. “And how, pray tell, did you try to find proof?”
Just as Harry was about to tell Teddy that he was doing a good job of waiting, Draco slid into the chair next to him. He looked up, startled, only to find that Draco was smiling softly at him as he folded a fabric napkin on his lap.
Harry offered him a sympathetic smile, remembering all of those years at Privet Drive. “Yeah. Is that what you feel like?”
“And I’m not asking you to change,” Harry said. “I’m just asking you to consider giving this—us—a chance.”
Harry let his eyes flutter shut, reveling in the building heat in his abdomen and the sharp tendrils of pleasure that seemed to shoot from his core outward whenever Malfoy pressed up against his prostate. His cock ached horribly, desperate for attention—which he’d resisted giving it since Malfoy had begun stretching him with his fingers. Slowly, he let his hand snake down his torso, wrapping it around his length and pumping it. He quickened his pace, timing it with Malfoy’s thrusts. He could feel his bollocks drawing close to his body, his muscles tensing, and then he came, shooting spurts of liquid onto his stomach until he was wrung dry. Still, sparks of pleasure were bursting within him as Malfoy continued to fuck him hard and fast.
Two days later, Harry could be found staring out of his bedroom window, watching the pale evening sky dissolve into a dusky lilac. Stars began to dot different constellations across the stratosphere, and a large silver moon hung low against the growing darkness.
By the time they got back to Harry’s flat, they were both drenched in clammy sweat. As Harry leaned his broom against the wall of his living room, he let out an exhausted yawn.
Harry cleared his throat and handed the letter over to Draco for him to read. After a minute or two, Draco let out a heavy sigh and gave the letter back.
Harry scooted closer to the side of the building, slowly taking his hands off of the broom handle before leaning over and shutting the window. Then, he turned to Draco.
“And I’ve got the solution,” Pansy said, pulling out a small glass vial filled with sparkling gold liquid. She quickly uncorked the lid and poured the contents into Draco’s cappuccino. He watched, mouth slightly ajar, as the golden liquid dissolved into his coffee, leaving behind a shimmery film on the top. “Everyone needs a bit of luck now and then.”
Harry followed Draco down the cobblestone path. A full moon hung painted against the inky sky, and only a few stars were visible behind thick clusters of clouds. To their right were rows upon rows of pink, white, and red rose bushes, all neatly trimmed into perfect spheres. Up ahead sat a wall of tall, willowy reeds surrounding what appeared to be a pond. As they neared it, Harry could just barely make out the silhouettes of koi swimming in the dark water. Draco led Harry to a white marble bench that was hidden in a cutout among the reeds, and they took a seat.
The minutes passed by like ice moving along at a glacial pace. By the time 4:01 rolled around, Harry had taken to pacing across the length of his living room, occasionally mumbling to himself about how it would all be fine.
Ron nodded. “Yeah, that’s right. All of the Aurors have been invited, and I think Hermione and I are planning on going."
Now, he was doing better than he had ever dreamed of; he not only owned his own yarn shop in Diagon Alley, but he also lived in a flat directly above it. In the year since he had opened the Whomping Willow Woolery, he had been more content than he could ever remember.
. Next to them sat the Christmas tree, its strings of golden lights filling the room with warmth, and there was a fire crackling away in the hearth.
As soon as Harry set Stockinette down on the ground, Crookshanks came lumbering out from the kitchen, his thick, weathered body truly showing his age. Stockinette began creeping towards Crookshanks, the two of them staring at each other in the process. Harry found himself holding his breath, hoping that Crookshanks would decide to be reasonably cordial. He’d brought Stockinette over to Ron and Hermione’s plenty of times, but each visit was different, depending on Crookshanks’ mood.
Draco blinked at him, slightly startled. “Yes, sorry. I was just admiring everything. It’s beautiful ― and so different from London, but in a good way."
“So, I initially thought about making you a jumper,” Harry began in an attempt to fill the daunting silence, “but it’s bad luck in the knitting community to knit a jumper for a romantic partner that you’re not married to. Legend says that it will make the relationship end and, well … I know we weren’t dating when I began thinking about all of this, but I thought to myself ‘what if?’ So, I landed on a hat.”
“Now, let’s go around and introduce ourselves. Please say your name and why you decided to take this workshop. I’ll start. My name is Harry, and I’ve been knitting for five years. I really struggled at the beginning though, and I was only able to learn through sheer stubbornness. My goal is to make the process of learning how to knit a little easier,” Harry said, and the table erupted into applause.
“Oh,” Harry said, shifting so that he could see Draco more head-on. “Draco, you didn’t have to get me anything. You know that, right?”
“About a year, I’d say. I know I’ve told you before that the first few months were rough ― like, really rough. I was dropping stitches left and right, and my tension was all over the place. Hermione really had to work with me on that. My second project, a beanie, looked more like a cone. I think the first properly successful thing I made was a triangle shawl. It's navy blue, and I still wear it on occasion,” Harry said before noticing that Draco looked uneasy. “Why?”
Harry tried desperately to ignore the disappointment settling in his stomach. “Alright. Well, thanks for a great time.”
Narcissa let out a light laugh, which Harry was relieved to see reach her eyes, and crouched down in front of Teddy. “I have some Cauldron Cakes, although they’re for dessert.”
Draco wasn’t entirely sure who moved first, but suddenly their lips met, feverishly kissing as hands began to roam. Potter’s lips were chapped and tasted like black coffee. His tongue worked its way into Draco’s mouth, setting his body on fire. He was already achingly hard, and Potter’s leg rubbing against his length certainly wasn’t helping, nor was the way his hands made their way underneath Draco’s jumper, brushing his hardened nipples. Draco let out a soft gasp, which only seemed to encourage Potter further.
mad at me for going behind her back. In fact, she told me to go ahead and schedule a day for the reunion to happen.”
, Harry,” Draco stuffed his hand into his coat pocket before pulling out a small, golden sphere. “I’ll let it go on the count of three. Ready?”
As Harry stood, coaxing a pouting Teddy into the kitchen and towards the silverware drawer, he found himself staring at the dining room table, longing for two more seats to be filled.
Harry slowly removed his right hand from where it had been resting on Draco’s and moved it upwards, cupping Draco’s cheek. The softness and warmth of his face underneath Harry’s calloused fingers was addicting, and although Draco’s pale pewter eyes had gone wide with skepticism, Harry reassured himself that he was making the right decision.
“Oh, it’s brilliant. The adrenaline that comes with it is unlike anything else. It also helps that I love having Seamus as a partner, which I try to rub in Harry’s face as much as possible,” Ron said, grinning.
“See how it’s soft, but it’s still a little scratchy? That’s a characteristic of wool. There’s a few different fibers that people knit with. For example, mohair is a type of fiber that comes from an Angora goat, and it’s known for being exceptionally plush. People often integrate mohair with whatever wool they’re using to make it softer. Then there’s alpaca, silk, and cotton. Does everything make sense so far?” Hermione asked.
“Thank you,” he said softly, squeezing Draco’s hand. “I’ve never been ice skating, but I’ve always wanted to. This is absolutely perfect.”
“Hey, Artemis,” Harry said, stroking her gently before untying the scroll attached to her right ankle.
“I don’t! It’s just that, well … we always get an earful about him every time we talk to you,” Ron said.
Now, moving on. *Prepares for all of the yelling I'm about to receive in my inbox from this chapter.*
They stood in silence for what seemed like forever, waiting impatiently for this to be over so they could go their separate ways. Harry leaned against a tree as he watched Malfoy pace back and forth while absently fiddling with his wand — a nervous habit that he had grown used to observing while at Hogwarts.
After unlocking the front door and turning the closed sign to open, he wandered back to where Ron and Hermione were perched on stools behind the check-out counter. Once he had taken to his own stool, he pulled his project bag out of his satchel, seeing that Hermione had done the same.
They rearranged themselves so that Draco was leaning into Harry, his head resting on Harry’s chest. Wrapping his arm around Draco’s shoulders, Harry drew him closer and placed a gentle kiss to the top of his head. With his free hand, he began to card his fingers through Draco’s hair.
Draco shook his head as he rearranged the various bags hanging off of him. “No, that’s alright. You go ahead and meet up with Gra― Hermione and Ron. I’ll only be a minute. Also,
that Narcissa doesn’t want to see you. Let yourself imagine having a relationship with her again ― and Draco too, for that matter. You could get to know them how they are now, not as who they were nineteen years ago. I haven’t seen Narcissa since the trials, so I can’t speak for her as of now, but I do know that she saved me when it mattered most, and that’s something that I can’t ignore. And as for Draco, he’s not the same bully I went to school with. He’s softer now, although he’s still an a ―” Harry paused, remembering that Teddy was in the room, “a
Crimson bloomed across Draco’s face, a look of panic in his eyes as he set the poinsettia down on the check-out counter. “Oh Merlin, I’m sorry Potter. I didn’t realize. I can come back tomorrow, if you’d like.”
Draco’s eyes lit up, and a wide smile spread across his face. “Alright. Well, when do you want to schedule it?”
They spent the next ten minutes going through each and every soap, marveling at how accurately they resembled childhood treats. When they finally walked away, Draco was the proud owner of five new soaps.
“Hey,” Harry said softly, briefly touching Draco’s hand to get his attention. “Do you need some help?”
Teddy, on the other hand, looked alarmingly like Remus, a light dusting of freckles covering his golden skin and bright hazel eyes sitting a bit wider apart than was typical. However, his smile was all Tonks, toothy and lopsided.
“Cróga is probably my favorite thing we’ve done so far,” Oisín said, holding the back door open for everyone as they trekked inside. “You’re one of the first shops to have it, and I’ll admit that I’m rather nervous about how the public likes it.”
Harry absently sat down, running a hand nervously through his hair. “Well, I was only interested in him because I knew there was something going on ― and I was right, wasn’t I?”
Draco briefly closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. When he opened them, tears were threatening to spill out.
As they continued to talk about their companies, Laoise brought over the tea, coffee, and a plate of pumpkin pasties. Time passed quickly, and before Harry knew it, eleven o’clock had rolled around.
Silently, Draco peered into the cubby hole, his hands skimming through the different colors. After a moment, he picked up a dusty pink skein, a lavender skein, and the same light grey that Harry was holding.
“I see,” Harry said, tickling Teddy’s bare torso as he thought about solutions. “It does seem a bit uncomfortable, doesn’t it? Why don’t I see what else you’ve got to wear?”
It wasn’t until the fireplace erupted into a gust of bright green flames that Harry felt distracted enough to get ahold of himself.
Without waiting for Draco to respond, Harry locked up, gathered his things, and headed up the stairs. Draco followed silently. Once they made it into Harry’s flat, Draco let out a soft gasp.
“Did I work you too hard, Harry?” Draco teased, doing the same with his broom before plopping down on the couch.
Before Harry could respond, he was being pushed against the wall as their lips met in a harsh collision. Whatever moment of trepidation Malfoy had felt before was certainly gone, because now there were only rough touches, and roaming hands, and wandering tongues. Malfoy’s mouth was warm and welcoming, and the way his fingers dipped underneath Harry’s jumper and grazed against his skin felt like a trail of fire blazing across his torso. He shifted his hips forward, desperate for some friction against his now fully hard cock, which was straining painfully in his jeans. Malfoy seemed to notice because he quickly slotted his leg between Harry’s thighs, rutting it against Harry’s length.
Draco looked up, frowning. “No thank you, Potter. I’m perfectly capable of figuring this out on my own.”
. He wasn’t even close to being ready to leave, as he had yet to pack his knitting bag, wallet, or printed order forms. Dashing to stand in front of the oven door, he took a quick last look at his reflection before begrudgingly deciding that he would have to do.
“It’s still pretty strange, to be honest. Laoise and I never imagined we’d be doing so well for ourselves
He wandered over to his trunk, which sat at the foot of his bed, and put his hand through the handle. Then, after double-checking that he had everything, he made his way out of his living quarters and down the corridor. Before his mind could catch up, he began to wander left, heading towards Draco’s living quarters instead of the Great Hall. He silently chastised himself with every step, trying desperately to convince himself not to descend the stairs that would lead to the dungeons. Yet, that’s exactly what he found himself doing, his footsteps echoing loudly against the cobblestone floors. The rest of the castle was silent, the air eerily still.
“Oh, fantastic! Alright, are you up for me to teach you right now?” Hermione asked, a wide smile spreading across her face.
Ron walked forward, standing even with Draco, and clapped him on the back. “Listen, Malfoy, that was really good of you, and we appreciate it.”
“No, no,” Draco said, shaking his head. “This is lovely, and I’m sure Mother is going to be over the moon. Please, come in.”
After a moment of silence, Harry had just begun to accept that he’d ruined the night by saying such a thing when Draco spoke.
Narcissa pursed her lips in thought for a moment before glancing at Draco and saying, “I think we have everything under control, but thank you. We’ll be back in a minute.”
“I thought I could hear company,” she said, coming to shake hands. “To what do we owe the pleasure?”
“Well,” Harry said, shifting in his seat so that their thighs were pressing together, “I need to collect inventory from an indie yarn brand called
Draco was standing by the door, a project bag’s handle looped around his slender left wrist. He looked nervous, fidgeting with the hem of his black wool peacoat, which was fitted nicely over a beige turtleneck jumper.
“No,” Hermione said, shaking her head. “It’s only a quarter to seven, although I expect Molly will be getting up any minute.”
Draco sighed, glancing at the tangled mess of yarn and needles sitting in front of him. “Well, I’m surprised my knitting didn’t burst into flames, to be quite honest.”
Forty-five minutes later, Harry and Draco moved to the couch in the living room, Stockinette following them. As they settled, both of them picking up their project bags from the coffee table, Harry felt a well of excitement inside his chest. Seeing Draco knit had rapidly become one of the highlights of his days.
“Well,” Ron said, scooping Stockinette into his arms and placing dry kisses onto her forehead, “I certainly wasn’t the one to figure it out first. That was all ‘Mione. She came to me in what, fourth year? After the Yule Ball. Said that there was something strange about the way you’d been looking at Malfoy all night.”
I'll be getting to comments within the next few days, but know that I've read them all and am grinning from ear to ear. Once again, thank you all. I hope you're having a safe and festive holiday season, and my wife and I are sending lots of love to wherever you are.
“I’ve also brought you something that might cheer you up, but you’ve got to go into the living room to see it,” Hermione said.
The warmth from Draco’s palm felt steady against Harry’s chest, reassuring him that this was real ― that Draco was here, in his flat, saying that he felt the same way.
“Righty-o, boys! How’s everything looking over here?” McWeenie asked. When neither Harry nor Malfoy responded, he clicked his tongue. “Lads, all of your peers are doing this exercise without complaining. I know that there’s some …
They’d managed to make it to camp in decent time, arriving in the early afternoon. It was located in a clearing surrounded by trees, and in the middle of it sat a fire pit with log seats that formed a circle. The tents were located on the outskirts of camp. Harry and Hermione shared a tent on the south side and, after putting down their bags, promptly settled in for a power nap that would hopefully go unnoticed by McWeenie.
He refused to admit that he was going to miss Malfoy, but the man was certainly more than a decent shag. There was something about him—the way he loved to bend Harry over his desk, the way he carefully tended to the sensitive spot in the hollow of Harry’s collarbones, the way he panted Harry’s name when Harry filled him with come—that made it just a little harder to go.
They wandered to the next stall over, which was full of soaps that smelled like magical sweets. Harry watched as Draco picked up a gold colored bar and raised it to his nose.
“I visit her a lot, since Teddy is my godson. I saw them yesterday, and we got to talking about how she wants to build a relationship with you and your mum but is too afraid to go about it. I was wondering if you had any interest in doing the same,” Harry said.
Wordlessly, Draco stepped inside. For a moment, he let himself admire the entryway that bled into the living room, which he’d finished a few days ago. The walls were plastered in a cream wallpaper with thin, golden geometric shapes, and while it was certainly beautiful, the deliciously bright turquoise velvet sofa that sat in the middle of the room, surrounded by two matching chairs, was the real showrunner. Across from the sofa was a walnut buffet table, and perched on top of it was a chunky Muggle television, which Draco had hated from day one.
Harry nodded stiffly. He wanted to be happy for Ron, but he couldn’t find it in himself to do it. Truthfully, he had no interest in hearing about how well things were going for either of them, as all it did was make it blatantly clear that his life was going absolutely nowhere. However, as much as he wanted to yell at them to stop, he resisted, clenching his jaw shut.
“Much agreed,” Draco said, pulling back and gesturing to the four packages sitting near their feet in a ring of dryness, two of them belonging to him and two to Harry. “So. Presents.”
I am beyond appreciative of all the continuous love and support that both TWWW and I have been receiving <3
