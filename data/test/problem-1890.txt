“Tonks?’ He came around the corner holding Teddy. Teddy’s Hair went into a kaleidoscope of colors when seeing his mom. ‘Is something the matter? You look shaken.”
“Well tell him we all said thank you for bringing us back. And I had a question for you. You don't have to answer Sirius and Hermione have told me about my sister. My mind healer thinks it would be a good idea for me to… resolve things I guess.’ She gave a sad smile ‘Do you think they were how they were because of the horcrux or that was just…”
“Right we will arrange it down in the trial room in half an hour”.
“You're an unspeakable. I already know. Thank you.”
The room heard the conversation between its friend and it's friend’s friend. It carefully lifted the ashes with the same signature and floated them into the open container.
“I can't go through the night without thinking Fred is dead.’ George said. ‘I'll do it.”
“You are aware we’re still here right?” Remus whispers. They both jump, blush and stutter out apologies and excuses.
Sirius said that he didn't like you but what matters is that I do.”
“No she lied to Voldermort himself, in the forbidden forest when he thought he killed me she was sent to check she asked me if Draco was alive and when I nodded yes she told him I was dead that's how i got away with faking it. What Hermione? Spit it out.”
Harry groaned and turned over. Remus dropped Teddy on him. No matter how cute Teddy was, he didn't think he would cheer him up tonight. “We had that party tonight, you know. Well Draco was on his second drink and I hadn't finished my first one. We went outside for a breather and I kissed him. He ran away. He didn't even say anything, just turned and walked.” He pouted.
“Mr. Potter thank you for coming I assume you got my letter”
"Are you sure you have to go? I mean if hogsmeade isn't safe Diagon’s definitely not."
N.E.W.T.S. Were the worst. O.W.L.S. were easy compared to this. They had to sit for hours just answering question after question. They didn't have classes anymore. They went from room to room for exams, with half-hour breaks in between. Three days of constant testing. Harry and Ron kissed Draco and Hermione goodbye when they started to discuss the exams and went to chill in the dorms. A Quidditch game was scheduled the next day for the students who tested to relax. The younger years finished the week out in classes then headed home.
He goes to introduce himself properly, but another boy defends him. "Ron! You can't ask him that! It's like asking my parents about Pettigrew."
“Did you take it willingly?”
“We did.” Draco smiled.
They settled into a routine for the next couple of weeks. They didn't talk much but they were only in the dorm for so long at the same time together anyway. Classes had started and everybody loved the new Professors. Harry heard Sirius sat outside the Gryffindor common room for 2 hours to get the fat lady to forgive him.
“Um, yeah, I’ll let him cool off more. Still not sure if he wants to hex me for asking something at the Manor.” Harry cringed.
“Do you think you deserve happiness, love, and kindness?”
“You could do it Harry. You have the political power. The right Ideas. Ideas that people would probably push to welcome into the new world cause they’re so scared of another Voldemort. And you have the stubbornness to learn what you need to to get it done. If you start close to home start with Hogwarts and build out. You could change our world Harry, more than you already have.”
“Uh...sure. I'll go get Dad.’ He walked as fast as he could doing the impression of his Dad he usually uses to mock his Dad. Maybe he should stop that. ‘Dad!’ He exclaimed walking into his Dad’s office. ‘Grandfather is here! And I know that sounds crazy because he's supposed to be in Azkaban but he just came through the floo.’ His Dad was looking at him as if he lost his mind. ‘He said to get you and I wasn't supposed to run and walk with a straight back and my head high. I don't know what any of that means! So i did my you impression to-”
Lily, Sirius, and Remus exchange a look before laughing. Regulus snorts and James blushes with a small smile.
He went to bed late that night thinking over his Mother’s Letter. He knew had to go to classes the following day, but he hadn’t made any decisions therefore he prepared himself to wear his mask and resolutely not look at Harry.
“Yess. We’ll be joining you in the library after that.”
“No, you just break them.” Remus said, coming up behind them.
“And you're just gonna give all that money away with nothing in return?”
He walks out as quickly as he walked in. Harry jumps up to follow and he can hear Hermione telling the rest of the people in the room to give him a minute.
Lucius died at some point, but if I put it in the story I feel like I would have to write the impact it had on Draco and i'm not really feeling that right now so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“Ah, Of course not. I will have the guards bring him, you can use my office, my apologies we normally don't have people to visit.”
“Oh. No, I think we’ll be alright. Kinda think we're both tired of fighting. And want to have a normal school year. Thanks Remus.” Remus gave him a nod and smile and left to follow James and Sirius.
“No Love.”
Harry looked sad and angry now slightly avoiding Draco's eyes “Um..You went to see who sent the charm and someone did it to draw you out so they could Hex you for what they called ‘Justice’. They used a pseudo charm of Cruciatus, where it just puts the body in pain instead of both the body and the mind. It dosnt hurt the mind but it does disorder it, that might be why your memory is messed up.”
Then Snape who was more focused on playing spy, keeping Draco from comiting murder, and trying to keep Dumbledore alive.
“The reason I was alive was because of Harry. I followed him into the room of requirement to get my wand back and then Granger and Weasley came in and Goyle ended up setting the place on fire with Fiendfyre and we almost died. Potter found some broomsticks and made Granger and Weasly come back to grab us. If Potter wasn't there I would've died in that fire like Goyle. And I will never forgive father for what he has done to us.”
“Thank you sir. Sir I don't know if you're aware but her son Draco carries the dark mark sir. Mrs. Malfoy would not be able to talk to or see her son, and I think we learned today that the bond they share keeps them good, and it saved my life I don't think we can take that away from them especially now...Sir”
“It's fine. I do get to see Narcissa. I just like the power I have over your father. Your mother likes it too. He hates when we agree.” Regulus winked.
“Draco my dear, are you alright?”
Draco sighed “Move over Potter.”
“Thank you.” Harry responded to the healer then he summoned his Stag to inform Narcissa, and Hermione in case she needed the information. He then walked to Dracos room and entered slowly, oddly enough Draco looked more relaxed then Harry had ever seen him. He pulled the chair in the corner across the room and sat next to Draco, hesitantly reaching up to grab his hand, when he didn't stir Harry grabbed it more firmly and laid his head down on the bed, anger evaporating quickly. He sat by himself for a couple of hours then Ron, Hermione, Narcissa, and a ministry worker arraparated into the room. Harry stood up still holding onto Draco, which nobody but he missed. “He's alright he’ll just sleep for a while.”
I don't know much more than that...was I supposed to do more?”
Muggle schools may have a hierarchy and they definitely aren't perfect but some school systems are mind-blowing. They actually prepare the kids for life while teaching them what they need to know.
One time when he was 6 he came home from the village and asked her why he didn't have a Grandfather from his dad's side. He saw a boy with 4 Grandparents and wondered where his fourth one was. He asked and she burst into tears and Dad had to explain to him that his Grandfather was in Azkaban. Where he was supposed to be for the rest of his life.
“Thank you Harry.”
“I think you can Draco, and I want you to write the letters even if you never send them.”
“But-But-’Draco started shakelely ‘But I've changed. I've changed you know that right Harry Harry you know i've changed ihaveill i'll prove ihave harry i prom-”
Muggles: Still wankers, Still don't understand
They made it to the tallest tower in the room. Below it was a clear pile of ashes. Draco dropped to his knees in front of it. Tears were making it down his face. Harry hugged him gently from behind.
Narcissa, Lily, James, Sirius, Regulus and Remus all gathered around them saying hello to the babies. Ron and Hermione came up after the group separated.
“What do you mean?”
Voldemort said “There are no more shields for you to use today.”He tried to use Dumbledore's death to make Harry feel pain. He said the battles that Harry won were all accidents.
Draco rolled his eyes while Pansy and Blaise leaned in further to hear his answer.
Harry starts to talk for the first time. “I lived with Petunia and her family all this time. They weren't great, but they could've been a lot worse. And once I started at Hogwarts I ended up at Ron's half the time. And before you ask Sirius no you're not allowed to go Dursley Hunting.’ Sirius sits back with a pout making Harry smile. ‘They were also living with a Horcrux all this time, I wouldn't be surprised if that made them worse than they truly were.”
“The council will now make a decision.”
Logically Draco knew that it wasn't that bad of a question and if anybody had a right to know, Potter was one of the few. However Draco could feel the anger bubbling under his skin. He clenched his jaw and spoke in a low threatening voice. “Go home Potter. NOW.”
Harry continued looking at the increasingly red skin that had a blush flowing through it till he saw dark scars across Draco's torso and slowly walked over to him without Draco moving. When Harry got closer he recognised the shape of the scars and couldn't stop himself from reaching out. His fingers hovered over it when he asked quietly “Draco… Did I do this? Are these ones from me? From Sectumsempra?” Harry got quieter and quieter scared of the answer.
---------
“I started questioning after Cedric’s Death. I know my father was there that night. He was only 3 years older than us and father let him die without a care in the world. I realized he committed to a madman.
“Sirius got a letter recently too. Let me go put Teddy down for his nap then we can read it.”
Just be patient within reason, and don't give up because everything did not fall directly into place Okay?”
“Yeah. The one he used to manipulate you, to get you to the mysteries department.”
“How would you fail your mother?”
“Of course Mother.”
“Thank you.” Draco politely nods and walks out the great hall. He drags himself up to the headmasters office past the Gargoyle.
“Listen before you object’ James started ‘We think it would be best if everyone went to a mind healer.’ Objections started ‘HEY I said wait.” Everyone quieted but seemed displeased.
“...Thanks. That was actually nice to hear.’ This time Draco couldn't control the eye roll. ‘Promise not to hex me for my next question?”
“...One session.”
“Yes, Me, James, Lily, Remus, and Sirius. Where do you think he stayed the last two nights.”
“No, they were worse’ Draco says factually ‘If you're asking, Yes I did have them killed so I could bring them without curse damage. Do you have an objection to that?”
“Right, sorry, I don't know if I can do that but if I don't I'm failing my mother.”
“Master and Mistress are taking no visitors currently. Please leave.”
They tell him what to wear. They tell him to relax about it. They tell him to be himself. They tell him to be careful and keep everyone safe. He understands other people might want to punish them for being his family. He tells them he would never put them at risk.
James sighed. “If you think you’ll be safe. I’ll admit you going to Voldemort's ex-headquarters makes me nervous.”
“We’d be honored, Draco. Are they busy now?” Remus responses for them.
Harry lasted until the night after the Prophet article. “So exactly how much of your inheritance do you have left?”
His father hugs him stiffly after, Draco can't remember the last time his father hugged him. “I'm sorry for everything, do whatever you wish in life.” He whispers. Draco can barely contain his shock.
“Neville, I don't mean to upset you but I thought your parents weren't dead?”
“So you tried ‘-mother-’ I know I just want you to be happy. I just want my dragon back.”
“I think they’re overreacting. You're rooming with Mr. Malfoy. McGonagall thinks it would be best if you two roomed together for untold reasons. But remember you have a room in our quarters if you need it.” Remus told him.
Sirius starts crying as James and Lily come back. "I'm sorry' he sobs 'It should have been me, I should've known."
It didn't take long to find who did it; they found that people answered pretty quickly when a pissed off Harry Potter asked them questions. They were on their way to the teenager who did it whose name was David when Harry heard a young voice call out.
“Master.’ Grobb says and Draco flinches. ‘Are you being careful and keeping safe?”
Narcissa hugs Harry gently in thanks. Draco hugs him next, both of them hugging tightly. They pull away as James speaks.
“Restitution is a common form of punishment for a crime. Just because Bellatrix did not live long enough to pay it doesn't mean her victims shouldnt get it.”
The Tonks had moved back to Andy’s house. Remus and Tonks had decided that they would do better apart. They still cared about each other. They were coparenting Teddy. Tonks had decided that she didn't want to be second best, and they acknowledged that if Sirius didn't die there was a big possibility they never would have gotten together. Remus stayed at Potter Mansion and they switched off Teddy weekly.
“Hey...You know ever since sixth year i've been wanting you to smile like you used to, you to get that gleam in your eye I used to hate so much cause it meant trouble for me, you to relax in the grass or sitting in a tree you're beautiful when you do that, Did you know? Anyway I would very much like to do all those things with you and much more, baby boy.”
Dear Harry Potter…
“What.” Harry asks flatly.
“I’m not enthralled by the Idea, but if you are sure you want to take this family in this direction, I will do my best to support you.”
Draco led them in slowly. Harry couldn't remember any direction he went that day but Draco seemed to know exactly where they were going. They ran into the diadem first. It was melted and looked disfigured.
“Power, It needs more power…’ He mumbled to himself. He looked to where Harry was folding parchment into flying paper cranes. He taught him recently and Harry was having a good time making them. ‘Potter those cranes suck.” He threw in a stinging hex for good measure.
“How is he?” Hermione asks politely.
“Mother whose letters are those?”
N.E.W.T.S. Sucked. Even after winning a war, they sucked. Harry and Ron were avoiding thinking about them while Draco and Hermione insisted they had to start studying early.
Regulus smiled slightly. “Well I’ll admit I had little hope you would answer, but you didn't hex him. From what I hear, that's improvement for the relationship. Baby steps.”
“We are very different. I also like the power your father has over me. I think this is the most Sirius and I communicated since he left for Hogwarts.”
Draco didn't show up for classes that day so it was easy enough for Harry to give him space. But Harry wasn't known for being patient.
“Yes. Mr. Lupin has taught before and I have full faith in the rest of you to be great Professors with a little guidance.”
Draco opened his eyes and saw bright lights all around him, he remembered dreams of waking to Harry and His mother holding his hands sitting next to his bed, Harry stroking his head, but the last actual memory was opening the door to his mother's house putting his cloak on the cloak stand and someone spelling a flash of light into the house then stepping out to see who did it with his wand in his hand. He looked around and saw that he was dreaming again and Harry was playing with his hair again.
---------
“Scorpius’ Lucius remanded. ‘You don't run unless necessary. You walk with a straight back and your head held high.”
The room wrote in Ink again. Draco read it out loud. “The Dark Magic is halfend. It is still too much to open my doors. If the same amount is taken a second time the level would be acceptable and I would open my doors.”
“Of course. I apologize for my forwardness. I only wished to confirm you were who I thought you were. Let's go into my office and we can begin this session.”
The rest of the group cracked up while Harry Objected. “You’re not an owl. You got presents as well.”
“Draco. I’ll be honest with you. The only reason we are in my house and not in an interrogation room is because my son cares deeply for you.” James says.
"Oh." Draco shakes one of Harry's fingers and Harry laughs.
“I quite cared for Kreacher, and that potion was wretched. I loved my parents even though perhaps I shouldn't have and it made no sense to. As we know Sirius has no objections to actively hating them. He’s right to. They were horrible people, but I couldn't hate them.
Kingsley nods his head. “That sounds acceptable. Before you go, is this spell permanent and are there any ramifications?”
“No. I just needed to know. Thanks Malfoy. For telling me and for bringing them back.”
11 Years Later
Andromeda went to catch her. Draco asked the room to close as quickly as he could. Regulus and Sirius chased down the one escaped shot of Magic and cleansed it before it could spread. Everybody at the end of the Hall came into the Barrier and stood next to the circle.
“Thank you Narcissa, I love it’ Harry said standing to give her a hug, ‘where did you even get these pictures?”
"Draco, I don't hate you,'Harry walked in front of him so he could look at his face 'Look, do I trust you? No. Do I like you? I don't know if i ever go to know the real you. But I definitely don't hate you okay. I just, I need to see the change to know that you have, and so do Ron and Hermione. Okay?"
Harry looked down at his few opened ones. "I have no clue. Guess I just do, I'm not used to presents."
“Yeah, who- Oh Harry, did you like what I did to Malfoy, Now that's justice right boys?” He questioned getting cheers from the boys, before the trio could react Chip had already jumped on the taller boy tackling him and starting to punch him.
“Okay. It sounds like I have somewhere to be. Thank you for coming Draco, tell you mother I love her. Please don't tell her about the ministry till we know if I can come home. And I love you my boy never forget I will always love you.”
“Yeah, Yeah Harry too. I guess.’ Ginny replied sarcastically. ‘On another Note. Mr. Zabini has the booze. Have fun everyone.”
Draco set up the potion. He waits until Kreacher says that's all.
“Well you shouldn't assume anything until you talk to him.’ James told him. ‘Why don't you go get some sleep? We'll talk more in the morning.”
“Okay. We can try.”
---------
“No. My father sent us a letter asking us to visit. And I need to know what to do.”
“W-W-Wha-W-Who are you talking about?”
Back in the library Hermione and Draco were still staring at where Harry was standing. “Did he? Did he just tell me he loves me?” Draco asked with amazement in his voice.
Ginny, Luna, Pansy, Blaise, and Hermione planned a party for the repair of the Room of Requirement. They didn't tell everybody what The Room was but, those who knew what it was were happy to have it back.
“Ellie can do so.”
---------
“NO I'm a colossal idiot.”
“I'll still never forgive him for what he's done.”
Draco had gotten the requirements to be a mind-healer and was set to open his own business. Harry and Ron had moved to be head Auror’s.
“Is s-something wrong?” He swallows hard. The feeling he had when they had dinner comes back twice as strong.
“Some from Hermione and I took the other ones when you guys weren't paying attention.”
“You may go, but Draco I want you to think about it for next week. We will be discussing it, I think that's your next big step in healing, one of only the few you have left. Once we get past your father I think we will only need to meet once one month, unless you want to do more.” She said to dracos back as he stopped with his hand on the door knob.
The house elf brought lunch and Dinner too. He didn't get a response from his mother until he was preparing for bed. He stared at it for 5 minutes before his owl pecked him hard, encouraging him to open it.
Draco has to accept that you feel that way about him. Now he might doubt it sometimes but he has to accept it at least once. And you have to accept that it might take him a while to be totally comfortable in his feelings and your relationship whatever type that might be.
She started duelling Bellatrix. Bellatrix taunts “when mommy's gone the same way Freddy was.”
Half-blood: Possibly knows both wizarding and muggle ways of life, traits change person to person
Harry watched as Draco relaxed up against the window in the moonlight. He closed his eyes and had a small smile on his face.
Draco hugs his parents as hard as his exhausted muscles can. “I love you both.” He says unable to keep his voice from cracking.
“I don't know how to make options so it took me a while to start but this is all I have
“I can try.”
Harry went back to Hogwarts on sunday afternoon after spending all day saturday with Draco. He went to school for the next week and sent Draco any information Harry thought he might need. The next friday he was saying goodbye to Ron and Hermione Promising to spend time with them and their families at Grimmauld, where they decided to have a joint Christmas, on christmas day and after since he was going to the Malfoy house till after they finish activities in the household, then to his parents in Godric, then to Grimmuald for the remainder of break.
“Um, my mom said to tell you thanks for bringing everybody back. And I also, Thank you. Also Neville told me what happened after you lied. So thanks for that and I'm sorry.”
Kreacher had asked if Master regulus would be going back to Grimmauld. Regulus told him that they would be staying at the mansion for the foreseeable future. James smiled all day that day.
“Repent..like to the muggle God?”
This was the first time Harry was excited to leave Hogwarts. He was going back to a loving home with his parents. His parents decided to ride the train back too, even though they could’ve floo’d.
“Can I look through them?”
They shared a look and both of them kissed James on his cheeks at the same time then spoke simultaneously. “Yes we do.”
Muggle-Borns
Harry explains that Snape worked with Dumbledore from the day that Voldemort targeted Lily. Told him that Snape never beat Dumbledore.
Andromeda had barely walked into the room when Malfoy knocked his ink off his desk in the corner. He was staring at Andromeda with wide eyes and seemed to stop breathing.
Harry chuckled. He kissed Draco’s knuckles and they continued their date.
If when I ran away at 16 I forced Regulus to come with me without a choice.
“You'll learn soon enough.” They then continued talking while walking to Hogwarts.
“Where was everyone destroyed?”
Fifty-Four of Bellatrix Lestrange victims have received Anonymous letters with a Gringotts Vault as restitution for her crimes.
“I don't know Hermione. Draco did recognize me at the manor, I don't know why but he lied for me, and so did his mother”.
“I'm sorry, when were you bleeding out on a bathroom Floor Draco MALFOY?!” Narcissa questioned with anger bleeding into her words.
“We are very pleased to meet your Harry Draco.” Grobb smiles at him. Him and Jeal move out of Dobby’s way and Draco drops to his knees like he's done every time since he turned 12. He looks up from his hug with Dobby and sees Harry smiling lovingly at him. He smiles back just as lovingly.
James looked equal parts sad and angry now. "Well you can get used to them from now on. You'll get plenty."
“So you two used to fuck.” Teddy smacks him upside the head.
Over the next month things didn't change much. It seemed to be more hopeful and lighter than before though. There was a discussion here and there about people moving out of Potter Mansion. James of course told everyone they are welcome to stay. The Grangers were invited after Regulus, Hermione, and Ron went to Australia and restored their memories. They moved in just while they got their affairs in order to move back to Britain.
“Hello.” Harry greeted as he stepped into Mcgonagall’s office after Dinner.
“That took a lot out of all of us. We need at least a week to recover before taking the same amount.” Regulus responded.
“MINNIE.’ He rushed over to hug her which she returned gently. He used a sonorous to announce her ‘Attention please. Mrs. Minerva McGonagall is in the house.”
“Draco.’ James greets him. ‘Thank you for joining us.”
Harry decided he would never be able to give the speech for the Anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts. Minister of Magic Hermione Granger-Weasley gave it instead. Her husband and 1 year old child were by her side.
The boys watched as he read it getting confused when he would pause and look in between them or stare in space for a few seconds. 'Huh, i guess that makes sense. She told me about you two. Harry, I don't know if I still have rights to do this but you will treat my son right or I will find a way out of the prison and to you, are we understood?" He asked not unkindly.
Harry knocks on their door before entering. He knows it is his room too, but given he’s the one wanting to talk, knocking seems polite. “Hey, can I come in?”
“Good-bye, Draco.”
“What are you doing with it? You know it doesn't work unless you pick it up.”
"I can't explain right now.  The battle is going on outside. Wait for the rest to come back." Draco tells them.
“Don't look so scared, boys.’ She comforts them. ‘They weren't in love or anything. They care about each other of course but they weren't in love. They just comforted and gave each other what they needed at the time. They understand each other like no one ever could. Hermione likes to call them two sides of the same coin.
I knew after he returned from Azkaban. Bellatrix loved the cruciatus curse. She loved phychological torture more. Me taking the mark was Fathers punishment along with control of the manor, but that wasn't it. Bellatrix tortured him because he wouldn't torture me. I know people can only handle so much, but he gave in quick. And he meant it. It worked as well as any other Cruciatus and I’m his son.
“Harry. She didn't kn-” Draco started
Mcgonagall got a thick notebook out along with some muggle pens. “I think you’ll need these if you want to study that stuff. I also think it’s more than one conversation. You have a free block every Tuesday before Dinner. We can start tonight but I would suggest we meet then to discuss more.”
Draco took Harry's face in his hand. “No but I won't object.”
The dorms looked more like a hotel or a mansion setting when they walked through. Rooms lit up one side of the hall. You can walk across the hall into a large open Common room. They used the neutral colors of the houses to match. Gold, Black, Bronze and Silver.
“No, the battle happened, then I guess it just slipped my mind. Blocked it out with everything else with the Carrows.” She said with a sad look.
“Okay.” Draco’s voice cracks and he sniffles.
It was after a particularly bad fight between Sirius and Harry after a bad night's sleep that Lily, James, Arthur, and Molly ganged up on everyone.
They had a few weeks left in school when Draco went to a muggle hair shop in Britain and dyed his grown out hair with a shadow of green. The day he came to school with it Harry and him missed half their classes making out in the room of requirement. They had two weeks left in school and Harry and Ron were running around trying to finish all their assignments while Draco and Hermione half-heartedly tried to help. Spending their other time in the library, where they were going over potions and side effects of certain ones mixed together.
“Well Professor Hagrid, go to search for the first year, and Professor Hooch will you fly around the grounds and find Mr. Malfoy Please.' Yes headmaster.''Yes Minerva' 'Meanwhile Welcome back to hogwa-" She was cut off by a bang as one of the doors to the hall opened revealing Draco with a First year. "Ah, Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Haldir, Professor Hagrid and Hooch were just about to come find you. Did you have troubles?"
“Yes”
“Draco. You’re not using me. Not at all.”
“You wanna meet them?” Draco asks disbelievingly.
"Hang on Reg.' Harry told him then ran upstairs quickly. He came back down with another present. 'Will you give this to Draco please."
For most of it, Harry tried to get out of his head but couldn't help but think of the Hawthorn Wand up in his room.
“Gregory.”
Sirius had talked to Harry late afternoon and calmed him down some. The next day they all had a meeting in the living room AFTER breakfast. Lily, James, Arthur and Molly sat everyone down and stood in front.
“Don't apologize. I definitely don't sleep like a baby anymore that's for sure.”
“If I can be as strict as I feel necessary. I refuse to teach people like Sirius and not hand out consequences.” Regulus said, rolling his eyes at Sirius’ “Well that's offensive”.
“Yes?”
Draco shared a smile with Regulus. No matter how strong his mother was, he could tell she was struggling. The session he had with her showed him just how much. He had a lot of unfound anger at her and she had a lot of unfound guilt about his life. But their relationship was as strong as ever, she would always be his Mother and he would always be her Dragon.
Voldemort felt as close to joy as someone like him can, in a meeting after Lucius’s imprisonment. He was more focused on Draco but I could see Bellatrix and Narcissa in the background. Whatever standing the Malfoy’s had after Lucius' failure was tedious. Draco taking the Dark Mark and given the task of killing Dumbledore was never about him. It was a punishment for Lucius. Even in 4th year, in the graveyard Voldemort talked down to Lucius.
“Yes. It was. Here since we won't see each other on break.” Draco said, handing him a package.
“I don't want to go back to fighting at all. You could take time off before you start training. You don't have to do it immediately after school.”
“Well, last time we talked you still had a great deal of anger toward him. You are in a better place now, so I think we should see how you feel about him now.”
“Did you take it willingly? The Mark.”
“Alright, I'm in. I think it will be fun.” James said.
“And the one you think will upset me?”
“Bloody Hell. He has a lot of sibling’s.” She said.
Thankfully the Family caught on to what happened and welcomed Minerva with open arms.
“Well, I kinda made them. Granger helped but we basically took principles from two-way mirrors and combined them with other spells. And now they're programmable for keywords. I programmed ours to be Sectumsempra so that we could put a new meaning to the word. We can change the word if you don't-”
Harry blushed. “Yeah I think he would hex me before willingly answering any personal questions.” He said while they walked through the front gate.
“I don't um, how can we get them in there?” Draco asked uncharacteristically.
Draco kissed him before running to his mother. “Hello Mother.” He hugged her.
Harry didn't say anything and just stared at the letter with them. They stared for a few minutes before Draco stood and opened the letter quickly and harshly. He read it silently then said in a deadly voice “He wants us to visit him. So we can talk about things.”
“Thank you Potter. It's appreciated. Was that all?” He didn't prepare for Potter today. He didn't know how long he could keep it together.
Grobb takes him to platform 9¾. He received his letter on his birthday. Grobb’s mate Jeal ordered everything for him and took proper measurements. Jeal would have come but Grobb said she had other duties. He made sure to hug Grobb and the rest of the elves before he left. It would be unsafe to hug them in public.
“The Black Vaults technically were not all mine. Sirius’s was supposed to be yours and my mother still managed most of them. I still have my S.P.I.V. Black Vault and Mothers half of the inheritance split between her and Andromeda. My Malfoy inheritance I still have 95% of. I still have the Manor. Septimus Vault was one of many. The ministry took Father’s personal one. The Donated Manor would be 2% if I bought it ten times over. Don’t worry Potter I'm still richer than you.”
Draco pulls himself away from Scorpius and looks at Harry. “My mother.”
When I first pledged my loyalty to Voldemort I was a dumb kid who thaught that purebloods were more powerful then anyone, and I was angry because certain people didnt like me. When Voldemort died the first time, I was relieved I didn't have to deal with him anymore. When he came back I knew if I didn't show he would kill you and I thought he couldn't be beaten, he died yet he still came back. I figured if he was going to rule the wizarding world the most I could do was make sure you had a safe place on the ash heap.
Harry curses. “Ginny, will you tell them? Lucius is out. I have to go.”
Pure-Bloods
The room fills with everyone who died during the 1st wizarding war.
Harry heaved a sigh “Fine if your five think it's a good idea I’ll do it. Anyone else?”
“I just wanted to talk. You’ve seemed a little off this week so I wanted to know if you’re okay.”
“You have to take me out on a date and formally ask. One kiss doesn't count.” Draco said, intertwining their fingers.
“How much?” She asks with surprise.
“Keep your wand on you, I don't trust him.” Sirius said then took his hug and followed James.
When he found out what the twin had done he tried to save her. However he was bound to his Master’s will. Their father stopped him. Ordered him to leave her there. He didn't have a choice. When she finally did die he went insane. So insane he was pardoned by the wizengamot. He killed all three other occupants. He buried the father just enough so he could watch as his son and wife die before him as well.
“Thank you, Harry. Maybe I’ll track Petunia down and at least tell her I'm alive. I hope your trip to see Malfoy goes well”
It only took so long before James screwed up. Just his toes peeking out from under the cloak. “Accio James Shoe.” Remus muttered.
“Are you sure you have no defence Mr. Malfoy?” “Yes Sir” “Then we call on witness number 1 in Draco Malfoy vs. the ministry. Harry Potter.”
“You slept in a cupboard for 11 years Harry.” Draco said quietly.
They stood for some time before Draco Questioned his father. “Father, why did you want us to come today?”
Harry learned he definitely lied to Snape when he said his dad didn't strut. That was exactly what he did.
They moved in Two weeks before school started. Harry refamilarted himself with the castle while the adults rushed to get ready for their classes. He helped set up each classroom though. Every once in a while he would floo to Ron or Hermione's.
Sometime after the Battle Of Hogwarts
James breaks first he starts laughing hard enough to almost fall off the couch. “Oh Merlin. I'm sorry. I just- I can't… I think you traumatized them. Hahahaha.” Albus and Scorpius, sure enough, look traumatized.
“I know but I didn't think he would go back to ignoring me.”
“Witness number 1 for Narcissa vs. The ministry Harry Potter. If I am reading this correctly Mr. Potter you intend to testify for the defendant…"
“Alright Harry?” James asked.
“Alright present time. Here you go Harry. Draco.” Narcissa started giving them both box shaped items. Harry opened his and saw Him and Draco in pictures from Hogwarts before the hospital and some from the Malfoy house on each side of the small box that was lined with red and gold which opened to give you a place to put things. He looked over at Dracos and saw different pictures of them in the same box but with silver and green lining.
Its two weeks after the dinner party he gets a Letter.
The room wrote
“I know. But I’m just assuming he hasn't fallen in love with someone else yet.”
“Look Neville went to see him and Neville was fine. I’ll be fine. And in case you forgot I always win against Malfoy. I'm good.”
Two hours later year 1 through 7 were sent to the dorms and eighth years were asked to stay behind. “As I said before, you all have separate dorms. The Third floor Corridor on the left side has been prepared.’ She paused at Seamus’s hand. ‘Yes. Mr. Finnegan that one, it's plenty safe now. There is only one entrance and there is a common room open straight across from it. Your dorms are down the hall on both sides. You do have assigned roommates. No you may not switch. I'm counting on you all to help bridge the gap between houses especially for the younger students.’ Everyone looked slightly displeased and alarmed at this. ‘Professor Potter and Professor Black will lead you there. You should also know that there is no curfew but this does not extend to other years. We also ask you to inform a staff member if you take a trip to Hogsmeade. It is good to see you all.” She finished smiling.
“Is it inside plans? It’s quite cold James.” Lily said.
Draco clears his throat and stands on top of a table. "The war against the dark lord continues. The battle is raging now. Those who have given their lives today should be awake and rejoining the battle.
“Well if you're going with her you can always just wait until you guys come home to start Auror’s. It’s not like they’ll ever turn you down. You're Ron Weasley.”
“We. um we need something to put them in.” Draco's voice broke.
“Hey. Um… I just came by to, Here this is yours.’ Harry shoved the Hawthorn in front of him, blushing.
Remus who was the only competent teacher and the single good one we had.
Luna Lovegood
“It opened with all those artifacts in it before.”
“Uh- Heyy… so. Don't get mad all of your stuff is protected and I have one hand on the wand at all times.”
“That was not fair Harry! You can't understand the guilt I felt about your parents!” Sirius shouted.
“She's got a point mate”
“Kingsley knows where I'm going. I’m not running Potter.”
Harry laughs a little, but it's not mean. "You're, uh- You're supposed to shake it."
“He admitted he didn't like you but he didn't say anything untoward. You skipped class yesterday. Have you talked to your mother?”
"Okay. Good night Mr. Malfoy"
The house elves have taught him how to write, read, and speak. His mother ordered them to start teaching him subjects a year ago. They let him explore the library when it's his free time. Which means it's his choice of what to learn about. He chooses a book that’s called ‘The Wizarding World War: The Basics.’
“I died replacing the locket with a fake one. I intended to Destroy it” Regulus says.
Dear Ron Weasley...
“Yes that's fine”
“Fine. I did your homework. I didn't like it very much.”
“Thank you. For getting them. For everything.” Greg said quietly.
“I think some of it was the horcrux. And some of it was they just hated magic, hated the fact they had to take care of me. Petunia always seemed to go quiet when Vernon
“You never had my loyalty, I just did what I had to do to keep my family alive.” Draco says.
Including Pureblood wizards who would like to escape Pureblood culture.
Draco stares at his magazine before he closes it. He sits up straight and swings his legs over the bed. He pulls a worn copy of the prophet from beneath his pillow and tosses it in Harry’s lap then stares straight ahead.
He led them to a picnic set up close by. You could see the layers of warming charms. Two full picnic baskets were filled with food with charms over them. A big blanket was spread on the ground and candles floated in the air unlit. Several small blankets were folded as well in case the warming charms weren't enough.
“Tell me five things that are different.” Regulus told him gently.
“The Un-People I work with will be able to forge the paperwork. She will have died after your eighteenth birthday. The world won't ask the questions you’re afraid of.” Regulus tells him.
If I hadn't gone after Peter that night in Godric’s Hollow.
“You think I'm ready to apologize and specifically admit to my wrongs cause I don't know if I can do that.”
---------
The group of Kids, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna, Neville and Adults, James, Lily, Remus, Sirius, Regulus went to hogsmeade together, even Draco and his friends joined them. The adults split off to the shrieking shack halfway through the day While the kids went to Hogs Head.
Everything Dumbledore did related back to the war. But he didn't fight for the people fighting in the war unless they were useful to him. Voldemort did the same thing; he just liked to use Impiero to do it. The ministry was right when they said he was raising an army, it just wasn't the one they thought it was.’ Harry finishes thickly with tears in his eyes. ‘I need some air, you guys should join everyone who's left in the great hall, be back in a bit.” He fishes his invisibility cloak out and puts it  over his head and walks out.
“Right. Sorry. Would they be safe? Narcissa and Draco?”
Dean Thomas
Chip looked toward Harry and Ron who nodded their heads and said “Okay, fine.”
“Yes.” Draco whispered, grabbing Harry by the waist when he flinched back so hard he jumped. “Harry Potter. Look at me,’ he said, trying to get Harry to look away from the scars.'Look at me Harry’ finally getting Harry's eyes to meet his. ‘This was for your own protection. Harry that night when you followed me to the bathroom, I failed again, I was terrified. If you hadn't stopped me...I don't know what would've happened. I wouldn't have been able to let you go tell everyone, and I would've had to take you to him and that would have been worse than death for both of us okay, cause I wouldn't have been able to stand back while he tortured you okay thats why I didn't tell Bella I knew he would've came and I can't watch you be in that much pain. Don't get me wrong watching Hermione go through it wasn't pretty but Harry you going through it would have broken me more than I already am.
“Harry.’ He looked up at his dad. ‘I know you’re not the most patient but trust me it's important.”
"Yes, Mother, I'll be okay. Alright? I have everything including my protection. It's only a week I'll see you then and I'll still write you letters as well okay. It'll be fine. Yeah. Fine."
‘They did however make a promise during 8th year. I don't know exactly what the promise is but it has something to do with being there for each other. This is not the first time it's been acted on. When Andromeda died and Harry got full custody of Teddy. Harry went to Dracos for the entire weekend. When Scorpius was Born Draco came over a lot after you kids were asleep. When Astoria died after School started Harry went and stayed at the Manor for the next month.
Half-Bloods
When he got home he could see his mother trying to avoid looking like she was waiting for him on the couch from the moment he left.
“You know how I had a connection to Riddle?”
“My friends are alright with you now. Even Ron and not just cause the Septimus Malfoy thing.
The room burned the words into the wall.
“Im sorry, i'm sorry you just weren't waking up and I figured you wanted out, im sorry, i know that was personal i shouldn't have-”
Andy stayed for another hour before she had to go. “I actually have tea with Narcissa.”
“Promise.” Harry smiles at him.
After Draco finished his letters he found his mom sitting in their living room letter still in her hand with the pages looking weary and worn.
As they leave Sirius  notices Frank and Alice Longbottom. "You know they weren't dead last time I checked."
James and Lily hug him. James looks over sirius' shoulder and sees Regulus standing in the background. He lets out a wounded sound and lets go of Sirius to wrap Regulus in a tight hug. He looks back and sees Lily talking quietly to Sirius. They separate and they both come over to James and Regulus. Sirius hugs Regulus tightly, "Reggie."
“The summer after the battle of mysteries the nightmares got worse. I wasn't obsessed with Draco because I thought he might have taken the Dark Mark. I knew he did. I watched him take it. With Bellatrix’s dagger against Narcissa’s throat.
“I have a message from Auror Robards. He’s heard of your work to create a box to help cleanse Dark Magic. He would like to help you if you need it. He would also like to talk further down the line about supplying the Auror Office with the finished product.” He handed them each a card with Robards information.
“Okay, I’ll talk to the ministry tomorrow and we’ll work something out.” Harry said when the worker from earlier came back and knocked on the door.
“I didnt- I didnt think you were. Sirius said you brought them back. How?”
Muggle-Borns (MudBloods): Muggle Parents, Hermione, Lily Potter
“Anytime Draco.”
“I mean I could lie.”
Draco snorted. “Wanker. I love you. Good luck.” He kissed Harry gently before stepping off the lift.
“Oops” Harry said while slowly going to hide behind Draco. Once they explained what happened and convinced Narcissa not to kill Harry, Harry and Draco put the balls into their boxes from Narcissa, and Harry handed them their presents. Narcissa opened hers first and Harry got her a few new books about muggles that Draco didn't know she might enjoy because he only got her what his class list said. Harry went and sat by Draco on the couch and gave him a long rectangular box then wrapped his hands around Draco so he couldn't run. Draco opened the box and saw his old wand that Harry was still using since he broke the elder wand.
And Sirius' issues with you are truly more of his issues. I carry the same Mark you do, he just knows me better. He also refuses to get to know you on the principle of your relation.”
“No it's not but you’ll be plenty warm. Promise.”
"Yeah. It's great. Mom and Dad fixed it up after they got the Malfoy vault. Com'n see my new room and then I think Fred, George, and Ginny are starting a game out back. Mom and Dad got us all new brooms for Christmas."
The hat says Malfoy like it’s sure of itself. It makes a shocked sound as soon as looks through his head. It says maybe he would've been in slytherin in a different world. Maybe Ravenclaw in another. And possibly Hufflepuff in another. But in this world, where he’s an orphan and it's his first secret. ‘GRYFFINDOR’. The great hall goes quiet and he thinks he understands. He’s the first Malfoy to ever be sorted out of slytherin. But he’s not the first Black. He figures they forgot he’s a Black, He sometimes forgets too.
“FATHER!!!” Draco objected
“Harry...It's fi-” Draco started before Harry cut him off.
“She has been and yeah she is that's Jimmy’ Harry said while pointing him out ‘he's supposed to stay with her while she's here. I actually think that you would like him.”
“Draco neither is right or wrong. They may be fair or unfair, and they may be considered to be good or bad by society, but an opinion can not be wrong against another opinion. You form an opinion and you act on that one Draco as long as it doesn't hurt anybody. Alright let's start by going through your journal and what you wrote down.”
Not to mention the fact that we’re kept in the dark until 11. We could at least be made aware of what we can do and where our life is going to go.”
“What if I’m not ready to just jump into all of it?”
He couldn't resist. He leaned over and kissed him. Draco sat shocked when Harry pulled away. Draco stared at him then turned on his heel and walked down the Hallway quickly. “Draco?” He tried. Draco didn't respond.
Draco nods his head and looks at his red bed sheets. He has gone from an empty house to having roommates.
“Draco what are you doing here we still have another week are you okay?” Nydia asked worriedly once she saw Draco in the waiting room.
“What do you wish to do?”
Chip ended up going to Ravenclaw and Draco made sure to smile at him when he looked towards Draco. Draco didn't know what it was about the child that made Draco attach to him so quickly but he did like the child. Professor Mcgonagall ended the dinner by sending the children away and asking the 8th years to stay. Draco made sure to go tell Chip he would see him tomorrow before heading up to stand behind the other 8th years making himself stand in the shadows.
Harry smiled and gently wrapped the bracelet on his wrist ignoring the looks from the adults.
He sends Kreacher to gather Regulus and Sirius' hair from Grimmauld then go to the cave and get Regulus then the ministry to get Sirius. He starts the spell as the Elves from the great Hall come back.
“HARRY!’ Draco said harshly, making Harry jump ‘Sorry, Sorry, Just don't... don't read those ones please”
“Ginny, you never told him?” Neville asked her.
Regulus and Andy floo’d into Malfoy Manor. The entry room was done up with Christmas decorations as was the rest of the path to the living room.
"Mother I won't have anything to do at school, I don't have quidditch and I definitely won't be making plans with anyone. Plus I think it will be good for the both of us if I come home often." The next week was spent at home with his mother making or trying to make his favorite meals. They really had to learn to do things without a house elf. Learning to cook set off many of the muggle fire alarms in the house and required many windows but they could both cook basic meals and were still improving. On Sunday night Draco put his trunk by the door and started to dress in his robes. Since he was basically already at Hogwarts he was just walking.
As Voldemort goes to curse them the centaurs charge. Neville cuts the snake's head off. Smoke rises in the air.
Once his mother had left he opened the packet of houses and looked through it. He found one house that had 2 levels. On one was a kitchen dining room and on the other 2 master sized bedrooms with a bathroom attached. The house was around the corner from the rest of the block and had a river flow through the backyard and into the trees. He marked it and told himself to tell his mother he liked that one. He wasn't sure how he felt about leaving the manor. It has always been home but now its tainted and haunts him wherever he goes in the house.
She’s wearing colors.
Regulus looked up from his book and realized no one else was eating. “Oh. Is no one else used to yelling at breakfast?” He asked looking at James last.
“What is it? Whose owl was that?” He said looking in between the two.
“I didn't tell you I was trying to do it in case I failed. Harry came to me earlier this year.’
“No, I'm good. I think bringing more people would just freak him out.”
They all met their parents after the ceremony. Including Draco.
“About Hogwarts.’ he rolled over. ‘About using my political power to change schools. Everything about the process is so Stupid. And I only met with Mcgonagall. She scheduled me with the Educational Office of International Confederation of Wizards E.O.I.C.W. for next Tuesday. And the next Tuesday after that I have to meet with Kingsley to understand what the ministry does. Which should be nothing in my opinion. They should stay out of schools, besides funding.”
“It does matter because what if they're right?”
“Alright, Alright.’ Draco calmed them. ‘Dont go telling the press yet. We have a Hogsmeade date planned for Valentines day the press will probably figure out then.”
“Who donated that?” Harry asked from the window.
They passed Lily and Remus at the table around the corner. “How is it going Love's?” Lily asked.
A red head comes up to him. He doesn't know who it is but they know him. “Say Malfoy. How are your Death Eater Parents?”
“We’ve all made bad decisions guys, besides I don't think either of them were loyal to voldemort, maybe to Lucius, but not voldemort.”
“I find Regulus to be quite a weird name for an owl.” She answered.
“Why love?” Lily asked.
"Goodnight Draco."
‘But as I got to know him we grew closer. Between the war and his parents I knew enough to know that having a relationship with him would probably hurt. He knew that too. When he first realized he loved me he didn't talk to me for a month. And the only reason he did was because of the rumors that he took the Mark. So I demanded answers. He hadn't got it yet but he made sure I knew he might, even was likely too. He thought if he told me that I would give up on him.
“Well Chip, how did you end up here so far away from the train?”
“I think it should open if the fire is just smoldering.” Draco closed his eyes and asked for the room of hidden things.
Harry’s parents tried to actually be his parents. Which was not a bad thing in nature but Harry didn't really have parents so he pushed back quite a bit.
Draco couldn't even remember the last time he called potter Harry. He definitely hasn't done it in the past 2 years. The last time may have been the first day of first year at Hogwarts, but he couldn't deny how nice it sounded when Harry called him Draco he wasn't sure if Harry had ever called him Draco. He started to wonder what it would be like to hear him say it everyday, what it would be like if he whispered it, what it would sound like in the early hours of the morning right after waking up, how it would sound with Harry laying over him slightly breathless while running his hands up and down-
“Well, Draco we are still just teenagers” Harry said soberingly.
“I Love you too dragon.”
“Did he ask? I told him you might answer him instead of hex him.” Regulus said.
“Scorpius, James.’ Draco called quietly down the hallway of St. Mungos. ‘Come here. Meet your baby sister Lily Narcissa Potter.”
Neville walks to the metal gates. He’s never been here. He talked about it though, with Luna after she was freed. It unsettles him. He knows there's only two occupants but knowing its previous occupants shakes him. A fancy dressed house elf appears in front of him.
Neville killed Nagini in the Courtyard.
That is until they left the overlook and heard the younger children yelling for help, the trio all removed their wands and started to run toward the sound which was coming from the houses, as they ran Harry vaguely remembered that this was the way to the Malfoys. When they found the children they saw Draco on the ground wand in his hand screaming in pain while Narcissa tried to perform counter hexes that didn't seemed to be working, then Harry tried some that didn't work as Narcissa held on to Draco trying to hold him still. Hermione had already summoned the Healers and they started to apparate and one of them put Draco asleep and he went slack in his mother's arms till the healers were ready to transport to St. Mungos. “Miss, would you like to come with us?”
“Thank you, Draco. I’ll tell her you said Hello. Yes?”
Neville X2
“Then that's where we should start. I know that the courts say 3 times a week but that might be more destructive than helping, so I wont see you till one week from today. While you're not here I want you to look at all the subjects on this list and write in a journal your opinions on them. Not what your father wants you to follow or what your mother believes. I want you to form your own opinions blocking out other people's opinions as much as you can. Then we shall discuss it next week.”
He wasn't sure how this meeting would go. She might be grateful to him or might be resentful. He got so lost in his thoughts he jumped when a ministry worker said they were ready for him. He followed the worker to a vacated small office door and took a deep breath before going in, he wasn't quite sure why he cared so much what Narcissa thought about him but he just couldn't shake the feeling of wanting her to like him, or at the very least not hate him.
“Do you Harry James Potter take Draco Lucius Malfoy to be your Lawfully and Magically wedded husband?”
“Draco.’ He lifts his eyes enough to meet James. ‘Nothing of what happens deserves punishment, except for a dead woman. Your mother never should have done any of it. As for your family that will only remain with the people in this room and any more You decide to tell. However, your mother's death will have to be recorded.”
They continued kissing and gripping each other till Draco pulled back breathlessly to rest his head in the crick of Harry's neck and felt Harry’s hands come up and wrap around his bare torso. Suddenly Draco broke out into a fit of giggles trying to stop them then failing when Harry started giggling too. “Oh my merlin, Harry we’re giggling like a gaggle of teenage girls”
“Please. Thank you.” Malfoy nodded.
“She Wasn't thrilled, but agreed to trust my judgement. Are you satisfied with your investigation?”
“Right, sorry.”
“Who is Jimmy?” Lucius asked with hints of jealousy
“I suppose I should head to Hogwarts, it's already dark out.” Harry commented after dessert.
“Yeah, but I can go get a new one. Plus the wand may work for me and it may be powerful but it's still yours, it just doesn't feel the same, it doesn't get me. You know what I mean?” Harry said smiling, remembering Dracos words in the room of requirement the first time he tried to get his wand back.
“Even with the deaths’ Molly said ‘This war caused a lot of pain that hasn't been dealt with. We are all struggling. The silencing charms of the night don't stop the dark spots in the morning.” Almost everyone cringed at this. Damn Regulus, Sirius, and Andromeda's Pureblood training.
“PROfessor!’ Harry stopped her. ‘Just curious, was the offer to return extended to everyone?”
The boys crowded around Harry and the red-haired baby in his arms. It will always be told, especially for her first date, that Scorpius and James fell in love with their baby sister quickly.
“WHERE IS HE?! NO GRANDSON OF MINE WILL BE A F-” Lucius rant is cut off as they floo’d through. The other kids made it safe and Harry and Draco were pulling out of a hug. Scorpius throws himself at his Dad while Harry looks at her questioningly.  “Lucius broke into the house. They didn't hear or see anything. We’re okay.”
They grow even larger than the ones who died in the 1st war. You can hear people gasping as they see previously dead people. Some of them look the age they died at. Others look younger.
They looked at Minnie shocked. “But Professor, Remus is the only actual Professor out of us.” Lily said.
Harry was sure it was a very nice speech but he didn't listen past that. He killed someone on this day. It was Voldemort. And he was barely human, but he still killed someone. It took him some time to come to terms with that. He saw all those bodys in the great hall. Yes, people came back to them that day, but Harry didn't think he would ever be able to focus on that instead of losing them in the first place.
Draco’s heart speeds. He can't risk his family.
“Regulus thinks the base theories are good. It may be the choice in the spells we used. The box itself also needs to be more formidable. We used a pliant wood. We’re thinking of speaking to a wand maker about different types of wood. It did start to cleanse the magic though so we’re hopeful it can be done.”
"Hey Dragon, yeah i'm alright. Did you finish your project?"
Draco returned to Hogwarts late that night.
Ron was still mad at Malfoy and still hated him but now he might be bearable for more then one second but until He saw it with his own eyes he wouldn't believe it.
“The last one please” Draco said in a small voice looking down at the ground. Harry put his arm around Draco walking them toward the room then shaking his head at Ron and Hermione who silently asked if they could do anything. They got to the room and lay down completely relaxing knowing no one would find them in there. They laid there for a few hours before Harry asked Draco if he wanted to talk.
He opened his notebook and put an X through everything that he had written and started over. Starting with what he knew based on how people acted.
The two Apparated to Malfoy Manor “Sorry I dragged you into coming. I figured he would be at least slightly comfortable with you.” Harry cringed slightly.
"Hey Siri."
“Hello Mr. Potter it's time for dinner. The prisoner must return to his cell now.” The worker informed them then shutting the door again.
Back in the Potter house Ginny is faced with 5 very confused children, one who is slightly shaken and shocked. “Okay. Okay sit down. Put the games up.’ She checks the wards while the kids clean up. She starts talking when the kids are settled. ‘Harry and Draco.’ They made an early habit of not calling Harry Dad when talking about him for Teddys sake. ‘They were the most affected by Voldemort. I know with Tom Riddle and the diary I was also very affected but Harry and Draco had it the worst. After the war during 8th year they bonded over that a lot. Now me and Harry were on a break during 8th year. We needed space to deal with the aftermath while still supporting each other. Draco and Harry were together.” She gives the kids a minute to process.
The Prophet
He was not smiling Three hours later when they finished. He was exhausted and he didn't know how people could be so stupid. It was like no one updated the school system in 5 centuries.
“Kay, okay, I'll get it you stay here.” Harry said gently, kissing Draco’s temple in comfort. Harry found a medium sized container still in condition and scourgifyed it.
To this day there are things Draco can understand about Harry that I can't. And if I’m honest I am so glad I can't understand. I don't want to and I don't want anyone else in this world to understand. Obviously they aren't together anymore. When we all graduated they broke up. Harry and I got back together a few months later. A few years later Draco met Astoria.’ She smiles gently at Scorpius who somehow both perks up and skins back at the mention of his late Mom.
“Yeah.’ Harry sat on the edge of his bed, hands collapsed and head down. ‘I’m sorry for what I said earlier about telling people things.”
---------
“Harry.”
“It is your room as well, Potter.” Draco answers, reading a magazine on his bed.
Harry pulled back and saw the anger start to dissipate in Draco eyes, then started to sooth his hair asking “Do you want to go home, go to school, go curse something, or just go lie down in the room of requirement?”
James, Sirius, Harry, Fred, and George were on a team. While Ron, Ginny, Bill, Charlie, and Fluer were on a team.
Friday May 25th 1998
“I think I'll give it back. Either way Malfoy deserves his wand back. I used Hermione’s for a bit and it just didn't feel the same, He said the same thing about his mothers. I just hope he doesn't hex me as soon as I walk on the property.”
“Azkaban is a place for horrible people who enjoy doing horrible things Mr. Malfoy. I do not believe that you are a horrible person or that you enjoy doing horrible things.”
“Only certain people can see them because only people who have seen death can see them. Tell me chip have you seen someone die?”
“Thank you Regulus. If he comes to your quarters tonight will you tell him he can come back to the dorms?”
"Sure mother no problem." A week later Draco was in Diagon Alley buying his school supplies and storing them in an expandable bag so he wouldn't look like a student. He bought some copies of his books for his mother like she asked mainly the ones muggle studies said he needed. He caught glimpses of other students including the golden trio but hid every time he thought he saw them. When he got home he separated his books and his mothers ,who was cooking dinner, putting his in his trunk and his mothers in the empty spot on the bookshelf for now. When they sat down to eat his mother started talking.
“It was. I just wasn't asleep.”
“Thank you. He suggested we do future test runs in the Manor. We have trial rooms there for this sort of thing. And if it goes wrong the magic isn't spread into Hogwarts. Speaking of School. After your meeting with kingsley in two weeks are you and Ron going to start studying for N.E.W.T.S.? I know you teased me and Hermione for starting early but you do need to study. I don't want to hear you whining that you failed them all.”
15 Years Later
“Right. Good point. This is Draco Malfoy we’re talking about. Thanks guys. Wish me luck.”
"I had Severus teach me at the beginning of sixth year, and Occlumency of course. I knew once he was in the manor and could be in my mind everyday without me knowing he was there I had to hide. Harry my feelings for you aren't exactly new, Now I can just feel them though and not have twenty different agendas involving you.”
“Draco do you remember when we discussed trying to repent to the people you hurt?”
Everyone laughs softly at Harry's half offended pout.
They reached the door and a nicely dressed house elf opened it. “Master Regulus may come in. Guests must wait for Master Draco before entry.”
Voldemort said that Dumbledore basically gave him the wand then.
“Well that's just karma.” Sirius laughed.
Malfoy looks like he was surprised that he was asking but not closed off to answering. “I figured they were fine now so you wouldn't care whether they died or not.”
“Grobb.’ He kneels in front of him. ‘I have a date. I don't know anything about dates, Grobb! Help me. Please!” He panics.
Just as she finishes a group of white streaks with 2 black ones mixed in come out of the entrance to hogwarts. One by one they land in front of the students and adults that just fought in the war. Neveille stares in awe at his younger parents from his position on the ground in front of voldemort.
“Yeah. I'm ready. How are you doing that with your trunk?”
“Oh.. I suppose it is late’ Narcissa agreed ‘Harry darling, are you sure you want to head back tonight it's already so late?”
“Mmm...Very well Mrs. Malfoy you will not consort with any death eaters including your husband and excluding your son, does that work for you Mr. Potter?”
“That is Sir.”
“What word?” Harry looked up.
“I've been told that mind-healers are a bunch of nobodies who only want to profit off of weak wankers who believe that mind-healers can help them because they aren't strong enough to do anything else.”
The first week with Teddy everyone at the school fell in love with him.
Some still displaced by the war have been offered rooms at the Manor for however long it takes them to recover.
“Please sit. May I call you Draco?”
Sirius was good. He and Remus had figured out their relationship. Which was slowly progressing. James and Lily were back. He was Back. Harry was better than ever. Voldemort was dead. He and Regulus were back to how they were when they were little before Hogwarts. He didn't necessarily trust Harry’s choice in crush but he also knew he couldn't change it. He tried that with James and Regulus.
“Yeah. Your Family already knows. Mother knows. We could tell our friends in the next month or so. Then go on a date. A public one.” Draco fidgeted with his necklace.
Just as she finished Malfoy walked into the room focused on a stack of parchment. He looked up when he realised everyone was looking at him and raised an eyebrow.
Neither Potter nor Malfoy were available for comment before the Return to Hogwarts School.
“My name's Chip. Chip Haldir.”
"I'm afraid that we lost a first year Chip Haldir…… also Draco Malfoy has not shown up for his escort" Flitwick ended quietly. Even when he said it sofly the hall quieted at the mention of Draco half looking at the headmaster and half looking toward harry, hermione, and ron at the gryffindor table.
“Ah, that was part of her punishment. I'm afraid they didn't tell me what happened during your trials, I only know what I could piece together from your letter.' He said while opening the letter from Narcissa carefully and pulling it out.
“No one. I just know you. You want to make sure kids like you and Riddle don't slip through the cracks. You want someone to take care of kids like you, and someone to recognize kids like Riddle sooner so they can get help.”
“Ah...then we will be ready in ten minutes sir”. Nodding in departure.
Draco floos first. He waits until they all come out of the floo to call for them. He holds Harry’s hand nervously. “Grobb, Jeal, Dobby, Hoffey, Blort, Evedy.”
“The council has made a decision. Draco Lucius Malfoy you have been sentenced to 5 years probation, 5 years of a track on your wand, in conjunction with other seventh year students at Hogwarts Academy you will return for an eighth year to finish your education you will be on house arrest till the start of next term, you will also be required to see a mind-healer 3 times a week or at the discretion of the mind-healer till the start of next term, at the time the mind-healer will make the quantity of visits required. Do you understand your sentence Mr. Malfoy?”
I should probably talk to my parents and Sirius and Remus but they won't go to the papers.”
“No, that wouldn't have worked. During the final battle, when you and Riddle were circling each other, did you feel the magical build up?”
“Hello, my name is Draco Malfoy. I have an appointment today with the healer Nydia. Can you tell me where to find her.”
“We are going to talk about that last one later. The Diary and The Cup would have spread up from the Chamber and been cleansed in the rebuilding process, along with Nagini.
“He is Theodore’s Father.”
After the war ended Hermione went to Australia and restored her parents memories, now that Voldemort was dead her parents could remember and be safe. Even though he was dead she made sure to put protection charms around her parents and their house. She went to see the mind healer close to weekly now instead of frequently like she did right after the war. She was currently visiting her parents spending the majority of her summer with the weasleys and grimmauld place. She wasn't expecting to get any owls unless something bad was happening, so she panicked when she got one, but was even more surprised that it was from Malfoy.
“Draco,’ Harry started to explain both parts of that story ‘Voldemort called your father to find Snape and bring him back to Voldemort. Voldemort thought that the elder wand belonged to Snape and that's why it burned him, but the wand never actually belonged to Snape, the wand changes loyalty when it's won, or the previous owner is killed.
“Potter Helped!” Draco shouted above the cheers and applause.
Draco startled with a gasp removing his hands. Harry looked at him with crazed eyes and he immediately started to apologize.
Mother
“It won't be the first or last time I'm in the Papers. Haven't cared before I won't care now.”
They had moved to a house near the ministry of magic while Lucius and Narcissa stayed in Hogsmeade. Lucius still catching death eaters and Narcissa opening a bake shop for the students.
“It’s Petunia. They think Dudley’s child could be magical. Her mom left her on Dudley’s doorstep when she was a newborn. She’s almost 4 now. Petunia says she is doing some of the same ‘weird’ stuff Harry did when he was little.”
“That would be why you can see them. Now they are very pretty but can also be dangerous so when you're by them be nice and use slow movements. Now why don't you come with me and we can walk the rest of the way to Hogwarts were not actually that far okay?”
“I meant everything I said in there you guys saved my life and the whole world. I guess I should be going. If you ever need help be sure to owl me. I'll see you when term starts Draco.”
“Do you have nightmares?”
“This is Malfoy’s wand. Not the Elder wand but his Hawthorn.”
Scorpius and James were 8. Old enough to understand. Someone had left their baby with their family, So they could take care of it. Lily was 4, she remembered waiting for Remus. She didn't understand why they didn't have to wait for the new baby. Remus was only 2 he didn't know it was supposed to take longer to get a baby. He was just happy they had one; it was cute and squishy.
They met back up with the adults late that night to head back.
“Thanks Minoe, I'm going to go stay with my parents tonight.” He turned and walked to his parents quarters with his head down. He wasn't going to force Draco to be in the same room as him tonight. He face-planted into the couch ignoring the 5 adults and one baby in the room.
“What Vaults are you going to use? And if you wish to be anonymous I suppose I don't object.”
Harry waited 5 minutes before Draco came down. Harry's heart sped at the sight of him in tight fitting Black jeans, an emerald hoodie and a black beanie covering his white hair minus a few strands.
“Space Harry.’ Remus told him. ‘You give him space to get his thoughts together. You push him too fast and he’s just going to run farther away.”
“No. Repented to the people you hurt.”
“And? Was there anything…” Greg trailed off.
“Thank you mother. Um...Can I go work on my homework and do some more packing later?”
“Sirius…” Harry pouted.
“I-I-I've loved since the first day I saw him. It all went wrong when I tried to talk to him of course, I thought there was no way he wouldnt love me, I was just a stupid child but by the end of first year I didnt know how to fix it and I couldnt it just continualy got worse. Now I know he'll never love me, he can't love me. As for how I hid it, at the beginning of sixth year I asked Severus to give me occlumency lessons. Between the two of you I got pretty good at it. I used Harry to block off that part of my mind whenever he used legilimency on me, I knew he would kill me if he found out I was in love with the precious savior.”
“How was he?” Harry asked.
“If we're talking about Malfoy I agree with Ron.’ Neville added. ‘The prophet article where it said Bellatrix’s victims were paid was true. Mom and Dad got a lot of gold. The letter said it was a large part of her Vault’s. It’s been really helpful, they were able to pay off the St. Mungos Bills with less than 5% of the Vault. It’s even on the seventh level with the Black Vaults.”
“You asked if I took it willingly.’ Malfoy broke the silence. ‘Bellatrix held a dagger to my mothers throat the second I walked in the room. She just did it for fun. They knew I couldnt and wouldn't be stupid enough to refuse. I let them but I didn't agree to it.”
“See ya Harry”
Everyone nodded and they clasped hands. They closed their eyes and Draco told the room to open.
“No! She’s not. If I had just looked in the mirror, I would've known you were safe. Then you wouldn't have had to come rescue me and would have been safe in Grimmauld.” Harry said and left the room.
Hermione and Ron seemed to be doing fine but sometimes Harry would get dragged into an argument and had to help settle it.
He started to skim through one's written during first year till he found one mentioning his first potions class. Severus had always been his favorite professor. He was the only one who knew what Draco felt for Harry, the only one who understood Draco. He was one of the only people that Draco cared for enough to cry when he found out Severus had died. He read through the first page which was mostly just him praising Severus. The second page wasn’t that interesting till he saw that he mentioned Granger. He couldn't believe that he once wrote that she ‘is one of the smartest in our year and she annoyed Professor Snape with knowing all the answers but I found it rather entertaining that she could keep up with me in potions and she must be from a Pure-Blood family in order to do that’. He couldn't believe he wrote that about a Mudblood and was curious about what he said in his next letter but found nothing except him ranting about Potter, Weasley, and Granger the Mudblood. He thought about his journal and how his feeling toward Granger changed just because he found out she was a Mudblood. He started to feel unsure if he really had his own opinions or just went along with what he was told to feel.
"Not like that. Here.' Harry grabs his hand with his other free hand. He brings Draco’s up and touches their palms together. He curls Draco's fingers around his hand and shakes with his whole hand. 'Like that. See?" Harry asks him.
“Yes. When I was a child and just learning about the fortune I actually wanted to give some of it away. I didn't understand what one family could do with all that money. Father put a stop to that rather quickly. I’m not a child anymore, Father’s in Azkaban. I don't have to follow his rules on what to do with my fortune.”
Draco stared down at the wand. The last thing he expected when Ellie got him was to see Potter at the door. He looked between Potter and the wand before speaking.
“It's just… Just because they each made one good decision does it erase all the bad ones?”
“Remus…?” she floo’d into his quarters with James, Lily, Regulus, and Sirius.
He watched Potter swallow then slowly back to the door. “Yep, yeah, okay. Tell Reg I went home please.” Potter walked quickly out the door. Draco shut it behind him and closed his eyes, breathing deeply.
Bellatrix laughed the same laugh when Sirius died. Molly's Curse hit Bellatrix squarely in the chest. Bellatrix toppled. Voldemort screamed, blasting McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn back. He raised his wand and directed it to Molly when Harry yelled “Protego.”
And she is holding a child.” Draco said. Then picked up his ink, repaired it, and went back to work.
Ron was currently at the Weasley's house while Hermione visited her parents and Harry was at Grimmauld when a mysterious owl flew in with a letter to him. As soon as he saw who it was from he wanted to throw it away but it started with ‘please read’ and he thought it might've been the first time Malfoy ever used the word please.
“Draco, my boy, you came.” Lucius said with a rusty and amazed voice.
"Yes mother. I'll be safe, I'm wearing my cloak, I'll be in and out before anyone realizes I'm there. Okay?
“Hey.”
Half-Bloods: Muggle Ancestors, 50% of wizarding world, Harry, Severus, Voldemort
With the skill of a seeker Harry caught the Elder Wand. Tom Riddle hit the floor with mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hands staring down his enemies shell.
I was going to call the room Her, but then I was like why does it need a gender just because it has a consciousness doesn't mean I Need to call it her.
