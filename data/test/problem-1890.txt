Harry’s breath caught in his throat as his eyes trailed down the length of Malfoy and latched onto the beautiful sight of the blonde’s ruddy cock, standing at attention, hard already. Water dripped down the Slytherin’s hard, glistening body, his skin rosy from the heat of the bath. Malfoy’s nakedness reminded Harry of his own and he realised that he was still holding his Nimbus 2001, hiding his considerable length. A flush rose to Harry’s own cheeks.
He was answered, not by Malfoy, but by a female giggle - sounding suspiciously like Moaning Myrtle - and a sudden parting of the cloud of steam. The pool-sized bath was revealed and with it the lithe, sculpted figure of Malfoy, pushing himself out of it and onto the tiles. He fully straightened and his eyes locked with Harry’s as he pushed his wet hair back and out of his pointy face.
Harry’s next breath caught in his throat as he admired the masterpiece that was Malfoy’s figure. The glowing white planes of skin were toned and lithe from hours of relentless quidditch practice. His pale pink nipples pebbled as Harry’s gaze stroked over them. A trail of light blonde hair beginning at his belly button led down towards a bush of magnificent pubes. Finally, Harry’s eyes snapped towards the angry, red tip of Malfoy’s cock. A pearl of precum was already leaking from his slit, his balls almost purple with arousal. The boy who lived thought he might burst then and there, cumming in spectacular jets across the blonde’s muscled stomach.
Malfoy’s gaze dropped from Harry’s eyes, to his lips, and finally came to rest on the sharp outline of his cock straining against the leather of his pants. Harry gulped at the mischievous glint in the boy’s eyes and felt his mouth go dry.
Suddenly, Malfoy roared in pleasure, his orgasm racking his body, and shot thick jets of spunk into Harry’s welcoming hole. The ribbons of Malfoy’s cum hit Harry’s prostate, causing him, too, to orgasm wildly into the hole his cock was consumed by. He spilled his seed into Myrtle, watching as it travelled up her delicious pussy through her translucent skin.
The brunette finally shoved hard enough for Malfoy’s grip to loosen and for him to wriggle out of the small space between lockers.
Harry was snapped out of his reverie by the blonde twisting the wand into his jugular and lifting his jaw, forcing Harry to look him in the eyes.
Gazing at the blonde’s magnificent pork sword, Harry slowly sunk into Myrtle’s welcoming heat, pulled out until only the head of his prick was still inside of her, and plunged back in. Pleasure quickly built up within the boy who lived, his balls tightening. But he couldn’t take his eyes off the sensual curve of Malfoy’s cock. The flush and colour of it. How it bounced and expanded in Nick’s translucent mouth.
It was the perfect weather for the biggest quidditch match of the year. Gryffindor versus Slytherin. Gryffindor had already gone to the pitch to practice last minute manoeuvres before the game - the Wronski feint included. But Harry always needed some time alone before big events like this - he didn’t like that many eyes on him all at once. Taking a breath, Harry placed his broom against the wall to begin his pre-game stretches. He breathed in the magic in the air as he bent over and stretched his tight hamstrings. A groan escaped his lips as the pain flashed deeply up the back of his legs. As he returned upright with a sigh, he could feel the steel grey eyes of a certain Slytherin penetrating the back of his head.
The boy who lived pulled down his goggles and ran to Madam Hooch at once, only to come face to face with Malfoy. Of course. Malfoy was Slytherin’s seeker. This was certainly going to be an interesting game…
Malfoy spread the tan globes of Harry’s cheeks and gazed upon them in admiration. He leaned forward to whisper into the shell of Harry’s ear.
Malfoy wrapped a soft but strong hand around the base of Harry’s heat seeking moisture missile and engulfed it, his tongue lapping on the underside of it as if he could never have enough. The Gryffindor’s head tilted back and his knees buckled as calloused fingers brushed a trail up his tanned, sculpted abs and to his sensitive nipples. Malfoy’s mouth left Harry’s prick, and the brunette barked in protest, but quickly went limp with pleasure again as wet warmth replaced the fingers circling his nipples. The Slytherin’s other hand pumped Harry’s shaft with vigorous pleasure, already slick from precum and Malfoy’s saliva. Harry dug his hands into the silky strands of Malfoy’s hair, tugging on them and yanking on the blonde’s scalp.
"Brilliant." Weasley reached for the stack of files and opened the first one. "Did you know Jameson Newark?"
Draco pulled away so violently he left several strands of hair in Harry's fingers. He stumbled back and almost went down. Harry stepped forwards, hands outstretched, desperate to keep him, but Draco scrambled to his feet unassisted.
His attention sharply left Malfoy the moment he spied the dark stain splashed all over the carpet beneath the chair. A small pool of coagulated blood lay on the wood at the edge of the carpet. It was a grim reminder and Harry forced down a bout of queasiness tainted with guilt. He took a shaking breath and went into the kitchen to prepare a cup of tea. He knew he was going to need it.
With a hardly concealed sigh Potter turned and opened his closet, handing what seemed to be a mismatched pyjama set to Draco. “Here, you can use this.”
“This is on you!” Draco felt livid, as he had for the first time in his life been described as clumsy by none other than that damn Potter. How dare he? A Malfoy could be many things, but clumsy?! Not a freaking chance!
As they were pacing along towards the great hall Pansy turned to Draco. “Are you gonna be fine? You know… sharing a room with Potter?” Draco noted how Pansy had been keeping a respectful tone as much as possible whenever she was around Potter or even just talking about him. It had almost ruined her when she had stood up and shouted at everyone about joining you-know-who during the start of the war. She had been lucky that Potter hadn’t placed her into the group of traitors that Draco had already been part of. And now it seemed like she was adamantly making sure to be careful with whatever she said relating to Potter.
Draco looked in surprise at Granger who looked just as baffled. Draco then turned to look at Potter trying to discern what was going on.
But why had he stared at him so much? Yeah, sure, even from a guy’s perspective that black-haired guy was handsome, do doubt. But why did he care? It’s not like he was gay or anything. He had just been taken a bit aback by the fact that the guy was unusually handsome is all.
“Always.” Potter just grinned as he got into bed. Draco did the same and with a flick of his wand, the room turned dark.
His whole life had been built upon the basis of not showing any weakness. This included not showing feelings or allowing yourself to rely on anyone else other than yourself. During the war, his mother had begged him to rely on her, that she would find a way for them to run away from it all. But he had been too afraid to disobey his father, and deep down he knew he wouldn’t be able to run anywhere that was out of reach from the dark lord.
This was definitely new to Draco and he was trying his best to keep up with Harry’s pace. It felt a bit reassuring that Harry seemed rather confident at what he was doing. Draco also noted that Harry was still as hard as ever, which was the biggest reassurance of all.
“Her name… What was it?” Blaise squinted his eyes as he tried to remember the new teachers’ introductions the day before. “Professor Evergreen!” Pansy finally said after a minute of thinking.
They all shuffled up the stairs to the eastern tower and gathered in what would now be their united common room. As all the eight years were now distanced from the rest of the students, Draco could feel eyes turning his way. Had he been anything less than a Malfoy he would’ve winced at the hostility that was blatantly thrown his way from a few of them. Yet, he kept his chin up and looked straight ahead. He knew many of them blamed him for various things that had happened during the war. Perhaps the biggest part of it was the blame of believing he had murdered Dumbledore. He was one of the few people who knew it wasn’t true, but he was aware of the fact that no one seemed interested in hearing his side of the story. In their eyes he was a death-eater and a murderer.
“You were awake?!” He yelped out, then felt heat surge to his cheeks as he realised just what he’d been doing while Potter had most definitely been aware of it.
“You ready?” Pansy was biting her lip as she looked at him with worried eyes. They were standing outside room 435 and Draco felt himself clench the vial in his pocket as he nodded slightly before tapping the door and opening it carefully.
“It’s just… I’ve never even considered the idea before, and now I’m suddenly unable to think about anything else than that” Harry sighed. “I don’t want to lose him, that I know for certain, but I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do any of the physical stuff, you know…” Harry felt a bit awkward at discussing such a topic with his friend, but he knew he needed some advice on all of this, and Hermione was always the best one to consult.
“You can make some cool potions using this. I can help you if you want.” Draco said, and Rosie grabbed his hand before he had finished his sentence and guided him into the living room.
It was weird, but it also made Harry feel a surge of something in his stomach. The quiet voice that always seemed to hold a hint of nervousness in it, had started sounding cuter by the day.
“No, no! I’m serious. I can walk! I’ve been walking for many years already! You don’t think I can walk, Potter?!”
But each to their own, Draco thought. He was aware of the fact that people have their own reasons for what they do in life, and he had learned not to bother too much with other people’s business. It might be why he had a hard time making friends, or maybe it was just his lack of interest in properly getting to know other people.
“Hold on…” Potter stumbled out of the bed, and as he stood in front of the mirror, he seemed to have finally woken up properly.
It was far from dignifying, but Draco couldn’t help it as he felt himself unwillingly whine at the loss of contact. A low chuckle was earned from it, as Potter’s lips quirked upwards.
“What if we bribe Retcher to keep a lookout? Eventually he’d spot something. He’s always hanging around with the wrong kind.” Ron suggested.
Potter inched closer to Draco’s face, leaving almost no space between them. Draco didn’t know what to do next, and it surprised him a bit when he closed his eyes.
“How about this! I’ll help you.” Pansy said, a big grin on her face, as her masterplan was forming right in front of her eyes. “I can be working the front desk, and you the back. I’ll take the orders and sell ingredients, and you’ll be in charge of brewing potions for customers.”
“Sure! Coming right up” She was definitely full of energy and it made Draco a bit less stressed just looking at her.
Draco sighed, if Potter had been meaning to throw his focus off, then he had succeeded. He had told himself to concentrate only on the snitch, but as of now he was just pissed off at Potter’s attitude and relaxed behaviour.
After a bit more bickering and overlooking Potter’s futile attempts at not being ignored, they all, mysteriously, managed to get a comfortable conversation going.
Draco felt a different ache in his chest as he realised they were now free from each other. The absence of constant danger had lulled him into a sense of protection and calmness that was suddenly ripped away from him the moment he realised he was no longer under a forced protectiveness from Harry Potter. Now what? Would they try to make things work between them? Did Harry even want to make an effort now that they no longer had to be close to each other? Draco didn’t know whether the close proximity had been the cause of why Potter was so compliant with his feelings for the man. It scared him to ask.
In a slow pace Harry pulled out slightly before pushing back in. Somehow the adjustment time had helped greatly as Draco didn’t feel the sting of pain rush through him when Harry moved. The big size of his cock made it impossible not to hit his good spot, and Draco moaned as he felt the surge of pleasure rush through him.
“Hi…” Draco couldn’t help but feel a bit uneasy. Him and Harry had only just agreed on trying for a relationship the day before, and not having seen Harry for a few weeks were only adding to the awkwardness Draco was feeling.
She stopped short as she saw what in her eyes was Malfoy sitting on Potter’s bed with a worried look on his face. “Hi Hermione.” He said in that usual soft tone of voice that did not belong to the body he was currently occupying.
“I…We’re not! That’s not!” Once again, Harry found himself at a loss for words when it came to his relationship with Draco.
A week had gone by and Draco had managed to get very little done as he was still bothered by his prior encounter with Granger. She must be out of her mind for thinking that he would ever like Potter.
“You look beautiful.” Draco wanted to laugh at Harry’s words, but his voice was caught when he saw the look in Harry’s eyes.
Draco knew that was his cue to leave, but somehow his feet didn’t listen to him. He was frozen just as he had been a few weeks prior.
Harry grabbed Malfoy's elbow roughly. "Come along, Persephone. We need to go and speak with Hermione now."
"Indeed. I would love to take you to Isabeau's new boutique in Actu Alley. She sells the most adorable shoes," Narcissa added.
"Oh." Harry's eyes widened at the implication. "Oh!" He looked at the leather and felt a surge of something warm and unexpected. A leather jess; basically a mark of ownership. The silver varvels would be engraved with Draco's name. Harry would belong to Draco as both man and falcon.
Nearly finished with my week of torture and I suppose I have to admit I'm starting to feel better. The shakes have mostly disappeared--Benjamin, my Chief Torturer, has insisted it's the green sludge he makes me drink, but I think it might be the daily massages. Heidi might have the hands of a Muggle leg-breaker, but I think she's finally worked all the kinks out of my muscles.
Greyback was fast, as expected, spinning and casting a Piercing Hex with a snarl, but Harry had already moved, drawing fire away from the boy. Although invisible, Niall could easily be hit by a stray spell. Harry needed to get them outside.
Harry glared at him. "Rosier! And he was looking for you. He tortured Eddie so that I would tell him where to find you."
What if he ended up not being able to sleep on his own anymore, just because he now knew how nice it could be to have someone else by his side? This wasn’t making sense at all though. He used to hate this, and now… Why was it fine?
After agreeing to see a mind healer, Draco had felt a weight lift from his shoulders. The mind healer had given him multiple coping mechanisms to use, and they were slowly starting to work on his nightmare issues.
“You’re quite determined, Malfoy.” Draco scowled at Potter sitting leisurely on his broom, seemingly not caring about the snitch at all.
“Would you actually trust me to back you up?” He blurted out before he could think. The sudden honesty of his words was strange even to himself, but Draco couldn’t help but wonder. They had been enemies for so many years, yet despite it all, Draco recognised that he probably trusted Potter more than he’d realised.
“This is it. All or nothing.” Hermione said with a nervous grin as she poured the potion into a vial. Draco nodded as he felt a surge of anticipation run through him.
“You don’t have to fight my battles for me, you know.” Draco said, not wanting to use Harry’s name to gain any favours.
“Ah, well I was thinking about taking shelter at the bakery until the storm gave up, but I didn’t realise it was closed before now” Draco said back a bit embarrassed for not having seen the sign on the door that had stated the bakery would be closed the following days because of the weather.
“You both had to face impossible situations because of who you were, so I don’t really think you’re as different as you believe.” Hermione said, staring into the cauldron for a moment before looking up at Draco. “I know you blame yourself, and I’m not sure if it means much if I say it, but I want you to know that I’ve forgiven you.” Draco felt himself wince at the words. It wasn’t right. She had suffered under his torment since long before the war, yet here she was, taking the high road.
“It’s karma. I finally understand the hardships I put people through with my endless rants and questions.”
Granger’s silence was only making things worse as Draco couldn’t stand any awkward silent pauses after that bombshell, so as his brain continued shutting down, he did not, in fact, shut up as he should’ve.
In-between kisses Harry managed to throw out. “Pansy wasn’t kidding when she said you had a great ass.”
Having to accommodate to other people every single day and going to endless meetings day in and day out had really taken a toll on him. Yet, this was his destiny and he wasn’t keen on trying to change any of it. Even if he had been, it would be too tiresome as he was already at zero energy most days.
They continued chatting and turning the conversation to other topics, mainly the success of Pansy’s fashion store and what their other childhood friends had been up to.
“Are you ready?” Harry seemed more worried about this than Draco. “I am.” Draco said, smiling as he readied himself.
“It- it hurts! In my chest!” Potter was leaning forward slightly, and Draco took a few more steps away trying to reach the dining table to sit down. Somehow, that only worsen the already dreadful situation and Draco felt his legs give in underneath him.
“Oh, how nice of you to say, Potter.” Draco couldn’t help the bite in his words, as he cursed his own misfortune.
As the next week passed by, Draco was starting to come to terms with what he was feeling. He had given up trying to run from it all and decided to at least accept it even a tiny bit. Still, he had no intentions of voicing these feelings in the near future. It was far too risky, and this whole situation of liking a guy was too new for him.
“About us making a plan to catch the Death Eaters and you staying here until we’re sure they’re in Azkaban.” Harry clarified.
“Well, I was teamed up with him during defense class today, and he wasn’t his usual self at all!” Weasley was furrowing his brows, his eyes locked on the blonde figure sitting at the Slytherin table.
Harry was promptly dragged out from the back of the bakery and had a mix of surprise and cheerfulness on his face as he saw who was standing in front of him.
“Can I talk to you in private?” Draco was adamant about not having the Weasel know about what was going on. He would probably poison Potter’s mind into humiliating him in any way possible now that he had complete control of his body. Frankly, Draco had more to lose as most of the wizarding world would turn a blind eye to it had he tried to disgrace Potter’s reputation.
The time it took to brew the potion felt unusually long, as Draco tried his best to avoid any conversation with Potter, and Potter in return, seemed to busy himself with looking through all the various nooks and crannies that were available in the brewing room.
It was fun to feel the banter remind him of the old days. Of a more playful time where the consequences of the war didn’t weight him down and make him scared to even say something remotely sarcastic in case someone somewhere got news of it and decided he was still a threat to the wizarding world.
“Only a little. Rumours spreads quickly you know.” Draco shrugged. Potter nodded his interest faltering as he resumed to reading through the various papers.
“As if! I barely tolerate him now!” Draco defended; a bit caught off guard by Luna’s sudden comment. How much had she been picking up on while he had no idea?
“I don’t believe you to be stupid, Draco, so I’ll just say it as it is.” Blaise was obviously having more fun with what was going on than Pansy and decided to spill everything.
“We needed her help in figuring it all out.” Draco said defensively, as he knew Pansy could be rather scary when pissed off properly.
“It’s fine. I’m sorry for having bothered you with something unnecessary… I just need a bit more time and I’ll get over it all and we can pretend it never happened” Draco said, still avoiding any eye contact. He could feel his chest tightening, making it difficult to breathe.
“Stop what?” Potter cocked his head to the side ever so slightly. Draco frowned, but forced himself not to get drawn in further by the messy Auror in front of him.
“If you don’t mind…” Draco felt relieved. He had slept in Harry’s bed before, and he slept better there than anywhere else.
“Well, I guess it was those qualities that saved us all, so we bitterly have to accept them.” Draco hummed back with a small smile forming on his lips.
“What about it?” Draco said defensively, despite knowing that this wasn’t really a ‘winning’ topic for him. Sure, he was talented in the sport, but he couldn’t disregard all the times Potter had managed to catch the snitch before him. The guy was practically blind without his glasses, so what the hell? Perhaps his glasses had been enchanted to always find the snitch, Draco pondered.
“Why were you hiding?” Potter finally spoke interrupting Draco and tilting his head slightly as he looked at him curiously.
Once Potter had calmed down Weasley they re-joined Draco and Hermione. Ron seemed less angry in his accusations at that point, despite still mumbling to himself how crazy it all was.
“I’m fine, just startled me a bit.” Draco said, trying to ease the tenseness with a shaky chuckle. Harry hesitated for a moment. “You can continue.” Draco assured him.
“Come in.” Draco opened the door and was pleased to see a much more structured office compared to that of a certain Head Auror.
“What the…” Weasley was furrowing his brows so tightly they were almost intertwining. “You actually know how to play, huh?” He stroked his chin thoughtfully as he tried to find a way out of his current predicament.
“What can I get you?” The dark-haired girl was undoubtedly cute in the baby blue uniform she was wearing. And her welcoming smile wasn’t bad either Draco thought.
“Well, yes. When I feel like I need to be, I am.” Potter said, his voice low and uncomfortably gentle. “I just…” Potter sighed. “We’re still basically stuck together, so I figured it’s better to properly talk things through.”
Draco hoped his way of saying it would indicate that he couldn’t be of much help, and Potter would have enough sensibility to say his thanks and goodbye as quickly as possible.
“Was it all nightmares?” At this Draco closed his eyes to try and remember. He had been too focused on the times he had seen you-know-who that he hadn’t taken the time to realise that there had been moments where everything felt peaceful. He would be enjoying late nights with Hermione and Weasley or fly across the quidditch field so fast that he felt like nothing could stop him.
He felt his muscles contract as Potter’s hand travelled down to the waistline of his trousers before it started massaging his cock, making him moan softly. The slow teasing left him completely hard as he clutched at the sheets.
“Is this what happens when you become Aurors? You all become overly paranoid and takes it out on a humble potion brewer?” The sarcasm dripped from his words as Weasley huffed once more.
“Get this! The Prophet said that the ministry is soon going to open up positions that won’t need to be filled before after summer. It will allow for us 8
Yes, Harry was handsome… That was something Draco had noted on their very first meeting. Yet, knowing that the handsome guy was also an excellent cook, could bake close to anything and was kind-hearted to anyone around him, made it even more difficult to brush it off as just finding a person attractive visually.
After the gift opening, everyone had just been sitting together in front of the fireplace and talking while consuming great amounts of eggnog.
“So you see, the time of day you take the potion is vital for it to work exactly as it should. You have to-“
“I told Professor Shrew I wanted to work on my potion essay and try out a few potions on my own. He gave me permission to do so.” Granger shrugged.
“7 would be good.” Draco just hummed in response, letting his mind focus on the ingredients in front of him.
“It’s not a bother at all! I’m just working on a new cherry pie recipe, so it would also help me out if you were to taste it and say what you think of it”. The guy made a compelling case, as the thought of a warm piece of pie sounded awfully nice.
“I’m sorry mate. I can’t help you if you insist on cheering for the losing team every time.” Harry chuckled, and Draco couldn’t help but laugh as he saw the betrayed expression on Ron’s face.
“P-please!” Draco managed to gasp out. His cock was throbbing, and he could feel himself building up.
It had become a bit frustrating for Harry, as he was sure they were trying to figure out whether a relationship could work between them. The only way to know would be to get closer, right? So why was Draco trying so hard to avoid that?
“May I ask what is going on?” Draco kept in a snicker, thinking that only someone like Granger would be able to keep her composure so well, despite the oddities she came across by being part of the golden trio.
Draco could see the white curtains of the bed covering half of the view of who was occupying the bed, and he could only hope he had the right room.
Draco didn’t know what to do at first, but then he heard it, unforgivable curses was screamed out and pointed towards the boy who lived. It felt like he acted on instinct, he must have, as he barely remembered raising his wand.
“And you guys couldn’t have waited for me to come around first?” She sighed, but both her and Luna joined them as they sat and had lunch together in Harry’s living room.
“Shit!” Draco yelled as he felt a curse shoot over his right shoulder, missing him by an inch. He was running while simultaneously trying to avoid the blasts of magic being whirled at him from behind. This is it; I’m going to die. The thought ran through his head in a frenzy as he realised, he was pathetically outnumbered.
“I… I’m sorry… I don’t… I… not like…that” Draco’s eyes widen at the words coming out of Harry’s mouth.
“I’m just saying.” Weasley made a piece move and looked up. “You can visit him you know. He talks about you quite a bit, so consider this as me being lenient about your new blossoming friendship. His room is on the second-floor room number 435.”
Potter nodded shortly before kissing his neck while gently unbuttoning his shirt. Each of the butterfly kisses sent a small shiver of pleasure down Draco’s back. Just as Draco felt his eyes flutter shut, he had to open them again at the loss of contact between his neck and Potter’s lips. He furrowed his brows slightly, but Potter just grinned as he guided Draco into the Gryffindor locker room, closing the door behind him.
“What the hell is going on?” Draco looked between his two friends where one seemed faintly amused and the other one had a worried look on her face.
“Er… It’s just… for dreams or well nightmares per se.” Draco mumbled the last words, busying himself with his wand and trying to keep a nonchalant look on his face.
Harry took Hermione to lunch and listened with a smile while she detailed the message she had received from Ron earlier in the day.
"That may be the case, but I cannot go to Azkaban. I refuse. I will be at home. If it makes you feel any better, I will be utilizing my father's extensive library to do some research into dementors, so it is not as if I won't be working. Don't forget this." He thrust the parchment at Harry, who snatched it angrily.
They levitated Quartermain and then gestured the others to precede them into the passageway by which they had entered, not bothering to be quiet. None of them even glanced in Harry's direction, so even if his feet or hands were uncovered they were none the wiser. He was left alone and contemplated the wand in his hand. If he could cast a wordless
Tonks giggled. "Sometimes you need to think like a Muggle, Harry. An aeroplane can get you there in a bit over two hours. I know, my dad took me to Ireland once, when I was a tot."
However, Draco knew it would earn him a cauldron full of pitiful Gryffindor recriminations once Potter recovered his senses. Draco would not have that. He wanted so much more than a one-off. He wanted the crazy, Celtic-knot tangle of emotions that Potter drove him to. He wanted to taste every inch of Potter's lean body, and wake up with those long legs tangled with his.
Tension crackled in the air between them and Harry forced himself to let out a breath and relax. Antagonizing Malfoy was not going to help him to cast a Patronus. Harry shut his eyes and tried to centre himself, to remember how it felt back at Hogwarts when he was teaching Dumbledore's Army. Encouragement, not censure, was the necessary tool.
Harry was in shock.  That was the only way he could explain it, really, as he walked wordlessly from the Quidditch pitch through the double doors of Hogwarts Castle, though the entry hall, and up several flights of stairs.  Absolute shock.
"Can't you tell?" Draco could see no sign of the Death Eater and decided Mulciber had set up some sort of scrying spell or device so that he could monitor the room. Another spell allowed him to speak. The room was small and round with a ceiling somewhere far above in the darkness—perhaps they had fallen from directly above. There were no visible exits.
He was only momentarily cheered at the thought of what Harry's reaction would be when he discovered that his best mate had sent his boyfriend away. The concept halted him.
"I know where he went," said Draco just as Pansy walked in. She was dressed in a thick ermine cloak and threw another to Draco. He grinned at her and she sneered. Oh yes, she was vexed with him. Draco buckled on the cloak and walked over to Potter.
, Draco thought uncharitably), the least he could do would be to pry some details from Potter. Perhaps the Ministry was being overzealous and Mark was not the primary player in whatever crimes were being committed.
Harry stared at him, shaken not only by Draco's words, but by the vehemence with which they had been delivered. He had no idea what to say, and wasn't certain he could speak at all through the growing lump in his throat. With the clarity of bright sunlight, he realised that what he'd felt for Eddie had been a candle's flame compared to the brilliance of what he felt for Draco. It was electrifying.
He deepened the kiss, licking the taste of sugar out of Malfoy's mouth and suspecting Malfoy preferred his tea far sweeter than the average person.
It was easier this time, surprisingly. From somewhere, Draco had found calm. Perhaps it was simply the knowledge that Pansy was safe, for the moment, or maybe their French words of nonsense had brought him a meagre dosage of peace. They were all destined to die, after all. It was only a matter of time.
The man’s shoulders seemed to slump as his walk slowed. Without turning, he halted and waited for Harry to catch up. “Potter,” he said when Harry reached him. Harry stared at him with conflicting emotions. Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy in over three years and now to randomly encounter him in Florence, Italy was…bizarre.
Harry chuckled and hoisted himself out of Draco's bed. He reluctantly left the bedroom and went downstairs to find Ron and Hermione in a prime fighting stance at the foot of the stairs. Hermione's fists were clenched and her cheeks were red. Ron was shouting at her.
"Hogsmeade," Draco whispered and then took them away. He figured Greg would feel safer in Hogsmeade, where townsfolk and tourists would be witness to any attack.
Draco snorted. "She would have to look at them first, and she can barely do that without getting a case of the vapours. Honestly, if she's ever seen a cock in the daylight, I'll eat my…"
"Yes, the Parkinson's are just as…" he stopped himself from saying “pure-blooded” and revised it to "…wealthy as we are. Also, their manor house is older and more opulent. It was originally a castle, back in the days of Charlemagne. I think my mother's dislike of the Parkinsons stems mainly from envy, although if you ever mention that to her I will hurt you in your sleep."
And when Harry collapsed on top of him, sweaty and spent and panting Draco's name in a tone that sounded like religious devotion, well, that was even better.
"Oh shite, I'm sorry," Malfoy said and patted at Harry's shirt, smearing the droplets more firmly into the fabric. Harry set the glass on the counter to avoid more spillage. "Want me to suck that off for you?"
Draco felt like seven kinds of a fool as he quickly passed through the grubby barroom of the Leaky Cauldron, hoping to hell no one recognized him. He plucked at the waistband of the unfamiliar denim trousers—the
He frowned. Provided Pansy didn't convince Draco to kick him out, or something. Harry sat up, suddenly worried. She had been eager enough to set Draco up with Mark, and she wouldn't be pleased at all to have her plans ruined by someone she disliked more than she disliked Roderick.
"They were created by magic. We should be able to destroy them with magic," Malfoy replied. "Yes, it hurts. There are potions for the pain, but they put me to sleep. I don't like taking them. Plus, they taste vile."
Draco patted his full stomach and stretched out on the bed. It was hellishly uncomfortable, but he'd slept on worse. He hadn't lied about the breakfast, either. The crumpets had been delicious and the tea had been strong and hot. Draco wondered if the quality would have remained the same if the cook had known it had been destined for a Malfoy. He wrinkled his nose. They probably would have slipped poison into it, or at least an explosive laxative.
Draco shook his head. "All of your friends are here. You're not alone now. All of these people—they are making me a bit claustrophobic."
But he mounted his broom and sped off in the direction of London, leaving Hermione staring after him with a deep sense of foreboding.
Granger swept into the room a moment later—accompanied by a watchful Weasley—and accepted a scattering of applause with a stiff bow and a short speech of welcome. Draco listened politely as Mrs Wells-Barton murmured hateful things about the disgrace of freeing house-elves and the fact that they had only come to keep abreast of the horrible situation. Draco made sympathetic noises and remained relatively near to Rosier.
"He changed his mind," Hermione said. "We've been working on his outfit all day. You should go say hello." Harry was still a bit amazed that not only had Hermione accepted his infatuation with Draco, but had actually
Harry snorted. "Bad luck for me, but good for you! Training now! Soon you'll be Head Auror. Anders better watch out for his job." He grinned broadly.
Hermione blinked at him. "You're admitting you need my help?"Draco's jaw set and she quickly raised a hand. "No, never mind! I don't need you to repeat it. It's just shocking, is all. I'm sorry I yelled at you."
"Not yet. 'E's desperate fer them Galleons. Needs 'em to flee the country, or 'e'll be back in Azkaban the minute 'e shows 'is face."
Draco bit his lip to stop the mindless babble from escaping. He felt hot and cold and electrified. And, Salazar, he was getting closer with each glide of Potter's brilliant mouth. A warning clench of Draco's hand in his hair seemed to alert Potter, who let go of Draco's cock and dove upwards again, pausing to give Draco's nipples some attention before kissing him again.
Malfoy's eyes opened and fixed on Harry, who felt a ridiculous sense of happiness when Malfoy smiled. "I would like. And thank you."
"Everything," Harry muttered to himself. "I know everything. I moved in with him, for fuck's sake!" And Eddie had never been anything but lovely, had never done anything even vaguely suspicious.
"Yeah, I didn't think so." She made a sardonic noise and gestured towards a sofa covered in a striped fabric. The furnishings looked expensive, but the flat was a mess. Books, magazines, papers and envelopes lay scattered over every surface, half-burying items such as unwashed plates, bowls, and glasses. Harry pushed aside several magazines on the sofa to make enough space to sit. Malfoy looked as if he would rather be AK'ed than sit down. His journal and quill reappeared.
Draco stared at Harry's rigid back and for a moment he could barely breathe through the pain. God, what had he expected? Had he really thought Harry would joyfully embrace him after he had disappeared with barely a word for
"No, you won't!" Harry resisted Draco's efforts to detach him and finally Draco slid down and took Harry's face in both hands.
Potter had no staying power, thankfully, because Draco thought he might come just from the sight and sensation of giving Harry Potter a hand job. Potter's release was explosive and his head tipped back beautifully as hot liquid spilled over Draco's fingers. He gave in to temptation and pressed his mouth against Potter's neck, sucking lightly as his teeth marked the Chosen One as his own personal property. Potter's fingers were fastened on Draco's sleeves and they detached slowly as Draco left off branding him and stepped away.
"Hi, yourself," Draco replied and gave Harry a slow once-over that made Harry glance at the house-elf, hoping it would leave so that Harry could drag Draco over the desk and divest him of his clothing in the next ten minutes or so.
It wasn't much of a cave. It was barely tall enough to stand in, and less than three meters deep. Draco crowded in behind Potter, since it was obvious by a single
Harry eyes widened and met wicked silver for only a moment before the spell snared him and practically yanked him forward. He cringed and mentally braced himself, expecting to recoil from Malfoy’s Shield Charm and then suffer through a barrage of laughter, but he met no such resistance.
He went upstairs to shower and wash away the taint that had surrounded him the entire day. By the end of his toilette, he felt almost human again, and even managed a familiar smirk as he traipsed back downstairs wrapped in one of Harry's thick dressing gowns.
"I hate research when I could be shagging you instead, but that doesn't seem to be an option at the moment."
SHIT. Christmas is in FIVE DAYS and I still don't know what to get for Malfoy. He already has everything! I barely know what to get Ron! Shit shit shit I am fucked if I don't get him the perfect thing. Except not literally, because while he's perfectly willing to give me oral sex at the drop of a hat, even in Flourish and Blott's (bloody hell, I couldn't document that here because we were nearly caught and I almost had a fucking heart attack) he still won't have full-on sex with me, which is fine, it's great. I wish I'd never made that comment about Jacob, because I fear Malfoy is never going to get past it. He's made a few snide remarks about fucking people only when he has
Classes on Monday were torment and Draco spent most of his time glaring balefully at Potter's unconcerned visage or bullying anyone within range. At lunchtime he poked at his food with disinterest until a nondescript school owl dropped a letter in front of his plate. It read:
He turned and tucked his wand away before heading for the door, trusting that Finnigan's noble Auror morality wouldn't allow him to shoot a hex at his back. "What do you mean?"
"Not quite yet." Harry's hands slid over Draco's hipbones and then teased close to his throbbing cock, yet never touched it. His palms swirled over Draco's abdomen and then he bent down to dip his tongue into Draco's navel, causing him to gasp aloud—not because of the lick, but because a wisp of Harry's soft hair brushed the head of his cock in a tantalizing, diminutive contact that made it ache for more.
Harry drew a shaking breath. He could not afford to make any mistakes. "I don't know where Malfoy is. He sent me a message yesterday to meet him at the restaurant."
"Why? Because it's Draco Malfoy, and he's this terrible ex-Death Eater scum who only became an Auror so he could undermine the Ministry from the inside? Did anyone ever to bother to think that he became and Auror for the same reason we all did? That he wanted to do some good? And for him, maybe to achieve some sense of atonement for the things he was forced to do? No one has even tried to get close to him; they only spit on him and pass stories behind his back. Frankly, I'm well rid of the Aurors. The lot of them make me sick." Curtis coughed and added, "Present company excluded, of course."
Draco had refrained from outwardly smirking, although Harry could see the satisfied glint in his eyes. Draco had also made an effort not to be quite so friendly to Hermione. He had still given her a pleasant smile, but had stopped telling her how fetching she looked, thank goodness.
"Yes. Everything is fine. May I come in?" Cho smiled at her, but Harry noticed that she didn't put her wand away.
He walked to the edge of the outcropping and surveyed the scenery. The view was lovely; rolling hills thick with wildflowers stretched away in the distance. He wondered what had happened to the goats with the old man's passing and then shrugged off the random question. He turned to head back to the village when he noticed an old track skirting the hillside. With a flash of inspiration, it occurred to Harry that the goats would have needed shelter, possibly a barn or other structure.
Harry straightened and traced his fingers over the barely visible, long-healed scars that crossed Draco's chest. Draco knew he no longer agonized over the reminder of
Days off are going to be rare for a while, so I'm savouring this one. Going to play charades at the Burrow and watch George try to slip experimental sweets into Ron's drink.
Things only grew worse from there. Harry tripped over his own feet on the way to the fireplace, dropped his favourite mug, and watched it crash onto the floor, spilling coffee everywhere. He spelled the mess clean and cast an absent Repairing Charm on the mug, but he'd really wanted that coffee and hadn't the time to make another pot.
Harry knew that rumour well; it was a popular tale over drinks at the Purple Cauldron. There were dozens of stories about what Malfoy had done to deserve his partnerless state, although the death of Malfoy's first partner was not his fault; the man had died whilst on holiday in Bermuda. It had seemed simple bad luck to Harry, but several rumours had Malfoy poisoning the man or arranging his death in order to escape him. Some even believed Malfoy had only joined the Aurors to pick them off one at a time from the inside. Ron had always enjoyed passing such tales around.
He frowned when he noticed a couple of droplets marring the covers of Eddie's books. A low bookshelf in the living room contained three dozen volumes of varied sizes and genres, although Harry had seldom caught him reading. Laughing, Eddie had once told him they were more for show, so that visitors would think he was well-read. "And aren't Ravenclaws supposed to love books?"
“How could you possibly help me, Malfoy?” Harry said, in a much quieter, huskier voice than intended.
Harry fell forward as the door swung inwards, but quickly recovered, ducked in and slammed the door behind him, breathing hard. Realising that he was likely exposing his arse to a certain sarcastic Slytherin, Harry whipped around to face the blonde, but he was nowhere to be seen. Instead, a thick wall of steam blanketed the room, obscuring the Gryffindor’s already poor vision and fogging up his glasses.
After his hair was sufficiently slick and his breath minty fresh, the Slytherin exited the classroom and swaggered down the hallway to the prefect’s bathroom, letting his erection part his robe down the middle proudly, as if his dick itself was an accessory.  He whipped out his wand in a flourish and trailed it down the centre of the door, from top to bottom, whispering the password at the same time - habent etiam patruos habuerit.
Malfoy’s head tilted back in a laugh that racked his whole body, his cock bobbing in tandem with the chuckles.
Draco glanced at his gorgeous reflection - Salazar he would never tire of looking at himself - and noticed the vibrant flush that stained his cheeks while he combed the gel through his hair.
All at once, Harry felt as though his meatstick had been stuck simultaneously into a pile of snow and a cloud of feathers. Myrtle’s touch was soft and shockingly cold, but one of the most pleasurable things he had felt in his entire life. He growled and moved to grasp her hair but met nothing but air, his fingers slicing right through her head.
Malfoy doubled his efforts as he resumed his attack on Harry’s delicious passage. He swirled his tongue inside of the Gryffindor seeker, desperate to taste every nook and cranny. Finally, Malfoy pulled back, his face glistening with Harry’s juices, and summoned his Sleekeazy’s hair potion from the pile of his robes in the corner of the bathroom.
Harry took a deep breath, preparing himself for his nude dash down a populated corridor surrounded by his peers and teachers. Godrick, was he really willing to risk the humiliation and multiple detentions that he would imminently face just for another taste of the cock of his mortal enemy? The velvet smooth, hard as rock, girthy, lengthy, throbbing, leaking, fucking deviously delicious cock of his mortal enemy?
Malfoy stood to his full height, a few inches taller than Harry, maintaining eye contact the whole time.
“What kind of medicinal remedies?” the brunette almost whispered, any previous thoughts of catching the snitch lost. He was too aroused to care.
Harry could feel the surprising warmth of Malfoy’s body pressed against his side. A rogue pixie suddenly flew into Harry’s path, eliciting a growl from the Gryffindor’s throat, forcing him closer to the Slytherin seeker. Their cheeks brushed and Harry gasped. Malfoy seemed to notice, despite the deafening thunder of the wind, and let a smirk curl his pretty, pink mouth. The brunette’s cheeks warmed. Whether from the speed of the chase or the accidental collision with ferret-face, he couldn’t tell, although he was beginning to suspect the latter as he let himself slow his pace to gaze upon the pert rump in front of him. Harry’s pace slowed even further as he felt a tightening in his cock and his quidditch leathers started to tent uncomfortably. All he could think about was the pale expanse of Malfoy’s smooth globes, bent over and spread, just for him. He let himself trail even further behind Malfoy, as he knew the evidence of his day-dreaming would be quite pronounced.
In answer, Harry’s hand snaked south, wrapping Malfoy’s throbbing member in his iron grip. He began to pump the blonde’s shaft with an unrelenting vigour, as his own cock swelled.
Malfoy slithered through the sky like the snake he was, his hips rocking the broom sensually back and forth, almost as if he was teasing the boy who lived. His usually light silver orbs now seemed dark with lust. But surely not? Malfoy couldn’t possibly be interested in Harry - he was a bloke! And a slytherin! And, well, Malfoy!
He ran out of the locker room, grabbing his broom on the way, and was almost blinded by the intense sunlight as he made it out onto the pitch at last.
“Uuuuggghhhh, FUCK! Potter! Ooohh fuck, fucking bollocks!” Malfoy screamed in tandem with Harry’s squelching tugs of his velvet-wrapped steel rod.
It sunk into him, then, the reality of what had just happened on that Quidditch pitch. He had blown Potter. Potter had blown him. Potter had fingered him. He had spilled his spunk into Potter’s plump, cushioned mouth. Draco almost came again from just the memory of Potter’s hot cavern locked around his fuckstick, as wet as a guppy fish in a tank. His cock started to tent his pants once again.
“Now, now, Draco. Clearly you haven’t been listening to Harry here for the past few minutes. We refuse to do anything if it is not asked for politely.” Nick chided.
Harry screamed like a banshee around Malfoy’s length, and was pushed over the edge. His seed sprayed down the blonde’s throat without warning, causing him to gag a little, some of Harry’s juices dribbling down Malfoy’s chin.
“We’d be happy to oblige.” Myrtle replied, floating over to Harry, while Nick headed in Draco’s direction.
Harry was snapped out of his reverie by the blow of Madam Hooch’s whistle, as the crowd’s screaming resumed. He growled as he berated himself for his distraction and pushed off the ground with all his might in quick pursuit of the snitch. Gold flashed in his peripherals as he dove lower and lower, Malfoy hot on his tail. Very hot. So, so hot. When did Malfoy get so fucking hot?
Once again, he coated his fingers in the viscous liquid and marvelled at the wonderful, multi-use product. Then, he slowly pushed two fingers into Harry’s arsehole, the brunette’s walls clamping around his digits.
He summoned his jar of Sleekeazy’s hair potion from the decrepit desk and scooped two fingers into the viscous jelly. The blonde had never realised until now the many similarities in texture between Sleekeazy’s and good old fashioned lubricant for wizards. He coated all his fingers in the gel and lavished in the cold slickness that reminded him of activities he had participated in not two minutes ago… with a certain bespectacled wizard.
Harry gawked at the gap in the clouds where Malfoy’s debauched figure was only moments before. Shit. Why had he chosen the prefect bathrooms as their next fornication location? He wasn’t a fucking prefect! Neither was Malfoy.
“You forget, Potter,” Malfoy said, flying closer so that the tip of his broom rested against Harry’s, “That I am the top potions student in the school. That includes the study of medicinal remedies.”
Malfoy snaked south and forward onto his hands and knees, mimicking Myrtle’s position. Harry curled his body over the ghost’s and cupped her clapping breasts, pinching her hard nipples. Malfoy took the opportunity, while Harry was distracted, to lean forward and plunge his tongue into The Boy Who Lived’s tight little hole.
“Classic Potter. Either too stupid to realise or just too distracted by my delicious arse to notice,  I caught the snitch ages before I sauntered over here.”
As the boys breathed heavily, recovering, Harry quickly realised their state of undress and their inability to recover their vanished robes.
It had been the only place that sprung to mind that was private and had built-in silencing spells - he would be needing those if Malfoy’s forked tongue came anywhere near his cock again. The brunette’s spent manhood twitched at even the thought. But, instead of the secret sex sanctuary he had imagined, Harry would be locked out of both the bathroom, and presumably, Malfoy’s delicious, pulsating passage. Bollocks.
The boys each mounted their brooms and locked eyes once again. A light blonde brow raised in invitation as Malfoy sneered. His brows were the most perfectly groomed pair Harry had ever seen. The arch lifted in such a way that it rounded the points of his face that the Gryffindor had been studying earlier. His gaze dropped to Malfoy’s lips as the blonde let out the point of a glistening, pink tongue and swiped it across his bottom lip. The raven-haired boy could feel a flush of heat creeping up his neck and warming his cheeks. How had he never realised how pretty Malfoy was before?
“Huh?” Draco said, as he had just sat back and enjoyed the banter, not feeling particularly involved in the talks surrounding their long friendship, but nonetheless enjoying the atmosphere and the fun remarks.
It was strange, really. The way Pansy and Potter was getting along, and her support for Granger would have been seen as a big joke just a couple years back. But Pansy had changed. That much Draco knew. She had certainly felt the toll of having supported the wrong side during the war, but instead of letting it break her, or keeping her old superiority, she instead chose to change her views. It had made it easier for the both of them to have each other through it all. Many of their former friends and pureblood families were still unable to leave their old beliefs behind them. Being able to have each other, both Pansy and Draco started learning and understanding more about the world besides their parents’ views and it helped them change their own views for the better. So yes, Draco knew that when Pansy said she was happy for Granger, she truly meant every word.
“Sure.” Draco said, not able to decline her invitation a second time. He also couldn’t imagine Potter would come invite him along to their tea-time, but then again, Potter was one who always surprised people.
Although Draco had seen him before, he hadn’t seen him fully erect like this. His cock curved up proudly as he lay down allowing Draco to get on top. Draco swallowed as he took in the view. He slowly reached forward and took Harry’s cock into his hand.
“Well, now you could be either one of you.” Unexpectedly Granger was visibly finding this more amusing than she should.
They walked past the man, who did not take his eyes from them, probably trying to place Malfoy, or at least memorise his current feminine features to describe them to the reporters.
He stood in a cell. An iron cot sat in one corner and thick chains hung from the walls. Draco struggled through the memories, trying to force them through the memory blocks that Mulciber had placed. A headache bloomed spectacularly behind his eyes and he had brief flashes: hanging in the chains while Mulciber cast Cruciatus Curses at him; lying on the cot, bleeding, whilst Pansy tended him; writing through drug-induced nightmares caused by the magical potions he'd been forced to drink; endless hours of darkness and mind-numbing boredom that he'd spent trying to extricate himself from his bonds…
He quickly chopped some spinach and tomato and then minced a sprig of basil and some garlic. The fire on the cooker lit easily, thank Salazar, and Draco sprinkled olive oil into the heating pan before retrieving the eggs from the cold box. He cracked four of them into a bowl and beat them--possibly with more force than necessary--and poured the mixture into the hot skillet.
The moment they stepped from the Floo into Harry’s flat, Draco headed for the hallway, intending to climb the stairs and lie down for a nap.
"Not right now, Teddy. But you can go upstairs if you like and look out the windows from Draco's loft." He gestured upwards.
That was a complete fiasco. What made me think that it would be easier to tell Malfoy about Jacob after we'd had a few drinks? The problem was that I couldn't think of an easy way to tell him, and then I kept drinking, and then I was too drunk to think at all, and then Jacob showed up... And then I accused Jacob of being "filthy potion smuggler" or something, although I'm not sure how he even understood me. Malfoy seemed amused, until I shoved Jacob and he pulled out his wand and shouted that I had no room to accuse anyone, being a bloody addict! I think some hexes were thrown at that point, but I don't quite remember.
Frankly, living with Potter was about a million times better than living with Pansy had ever been. Not that they didn't fight. Potter had driven him to the point of throwing things more than once. Potter had tied Draco up… well, once in anger… and several times after that because Draco had decided he rather liked it… His grip tightened on Potter's shoulder at the memory. Merlin, was anything sexier than a forceful, determined Potter? He shook off the thought.
"Or he was quite happy to see your breasts," Draco suggested dryly, glancing at them pointedly. Pansy had a habit of displaying her assets nearly to the point of obscenity.
"All right, who is it?" Parkinson snarled. She took two steps forward and curled her fist around one of the bat-ears on Harry's hood before jerking it upward with a sharp yank, taking a bit of Harry's hair with it.
Harry felt a moment of relief. Malfoy did not know about Harry's Animagus form; he was simply asking about his own falcons. "Yeah, of course."
"Quite right, Auror Potter. We've been working on a spell that will, in theory, contain intangible—and near intangible—creatures."
The press had played right into Draco's hands, turning them into a picture-perfect couple. Draco's father had gone through predictable stages of rage and despair, and the whole drama had finally settled into a quiet, rather boring, solidity.
Malfoy pushed back his hood and leaned against the sink. "Rosier." His face was unreadable. "And did you tell him?"
Harry looked into the swirling mist that made up the floor beyond the platform where they stood. Above the mist floated a bewildering array of slowly ascending and descending levers. They reminded Harry somewhat of the moving staircases at Hogwarts.
"I love you," he breathed. "I missed you so much." His tongue flicked out and touched the warm skin. "You taste good enough to eat, Draco. I think I will."
Harry glanced back at the skillet, which was beginning to emit distressing steam that threatened to become smoke. "Wait right here." He propped Draco back against the doorway and then hurried back to shut off the cooker. He shook the pan to loosen the sausages and then set it aside and went to escort Draco up the stairs. Draco moved as though he had aged by four decades overnight. Harry winced, remembering the lingering ache of the Cruciatus Curse. There was no telling how many Draco had suffered.
"I'm sorry," Harry whispered, finally locating the trite words that people always spoke when they knew their words were no solace at all.
He conjured a handful of buttons and repaired his torn shirt, blushing as he recalled Draco's amorous attack. They had better find the love potion antidote as quickly as possible. So thinking, he went to the desk and jotted a note before wrapping the parchment around the potion vial. Harry hurried outside to find Hedwig, who seemed none the worse for wear after the Apparition experience, despite Harry's annoyance with Draco always being right.
Each time their eyes had met, the Potter had flushed scarlet and looked away, finally earning a suspicious glare or two from Granger, who had turned it immediately on Draco, who had pretended not to notice.
"And for pity's sake, don't forget to ask her this time," Hermione snapped. "Instead of waiting until someone else does."
Instead of making another trip to the door, Harry cast a Patronus and sent his stag galloping through the wall and off to Kingsley. When the afterimage had faded, he sat in growing silence until he thought anything might be better than staring at the table in order to keep from studying Malfoy. He attempted conversation. "So, what have you been up to since Hogwarts?"
Harry took a drink of his too-hot tea and winced when it burned his tongue and the roof of his mouth. "Not sure. It depends whether or not there really is a case. At the moment, the evidence looks promising, but it could be that someone is screwing with us."
"Yes, and I came to rescue you. I'll take you to see your father now. All the bad men have been taken care of."
Draco felt something—a heaviness, but it was more likely Maeve's spell than any special ability of his. Her voice rose to a shout with the words of ancient arcane magic, and she snatched the dagger from her belt. She lifted it over her head. Draco tried Harry's trick of siphoning the magic out of the very air—with no result. Maeve's voice did not falter.
"Why here?" Potter asked, holding his lit wand high and ignoring Draco's shoulder against his own. Draco looked around, unwilling to admit that he didn't know. He and Greg had entered the cave once only because Draco had wanted to search for
"No! I heard something in the kitchen so I went to check it out, and then I came straight up the stairs—they must have exited through one of the other rooms!" Cho disappeared and Harry gave Greta a weak smile and squeezed her hand before leaping up and tearing after Cho, who slammed open the door nearest them and ran to the open window on the other side of the room.
"Potter," Draco said even though his voice was less steady than he would have chosen, "You constantly underestimate me."
Quartermain seemed aware of what he had revealed. He wiped his nose on the shaking sleeve of one arm. "What…what do you plan to do now?"
Draco shook his head. "My father was a proud man, Potter. He would have died before admitting defeat, accepting that he was wrong. He could think of nothing beyond regaining what he had lost. Crawling to the Order for help, begging for assistance-- It would have been unthinkable. He only wanted to retrieve what he'd once had, until the very end when he realised that none of it could be saved. Even if the Dark Lo… Even if Voldemort won we would lose. Status. Power. Respect. Such fleeting concepts, so hard-won and so easily lost. I'm not sure he ever really grasped that."
"Quentin! How nice of you to finally wake up. I would make you some tea, but you won't be needing it."
"Better," he said, but made no move to rise. He felt infinitely comfortable. "What was that spell? The one you used. That was no Patronus."
"How are you feeling?" Hermione asked Tonks. Harry thought it was a damned odd question—as far as he knew, Tonks wasn't ill. Unaccountably, Tonks blushed.
Hermione's eyes narrowed to a murderous bandwidth. Despite the fact that Malfoy was attempting to help, he seemed to be giving her cause to have him thrown out bodily. Then again, that might have been Malfoy's intention. Harry intervened before she could explode.
"Out with Dad looking at some Muggle shite he dragged home. Not much like Malfoy Manor, is it, Draco?" She stressed his name and her lips twitched into an almost-sneer.
"I don't pretend to know the minds of madmen, Potter. Your bosses have decided that Crabbe is seeking Draco and it's our job to protect him at any cost. We can't do that unless we know where he is, and he doesn't know, so he can't tell us."
Harry had commandeered the choicest conference room, designated The Cauldron by some employee back in the early days of the Ministry. It was on the same level as Courtroom Ten, but Harry had long ago got past his negative memories associated with that room, buried beneath dozens of trials and testimonies until he saw it as just another place associated with being an Auror. The Cauldron, however, was a favoured gathering room because of its rough stone walls, rustic fireplace, and enormous round table. It was pleasantly cool in the summer and warm in the winter, and gave meetings a conspiratorial affair that leant a strange sense of purpose to any topics discussed. It reminded Harry of the potions dungeon at Hogwarts, which should not have been a happy recollection, but the years had softened everything Hogwarts-related into a mostly-pleasant nostalgia.
"It's nice to be back, Minister." Harry looked at Draco and felt a laugh trying to bubble out of his chest. He knew he was making the right decision and it was brilliant. Draco's eyes gleamed with merriment.
There was a flurry of movement and it took Harry a moment to grasp the fact that Draco had opened the door and fled the cab. Harry pushed himself up and leaped out of the vehicle, blinking into the pouring rain and trying to stave off a wave of dizziness. He saw only a flash of grey as Draco ran into the darkness as if pursued by the hounds of hell.
Draco tucked an arm around Potter's waist and pulled him close. Potter only sighed, apparently resigning himself to Draco's manhandling. Pansy was not resigned. Her fingers dug into Draco's shoulder painfully as they Apparated. Draco took them to the living room of the Malfoy Villa in Marseilles. Potter leaped away and did his patented Auror wand-brandishing. Pansy did not release Draco, and she leaned closer to hiss into his ear.
Merlin, I have a recurring pain in my right elbow that's beginning to affect my aim. I need to have it looked at tomorrow. Hopefully I won't run into Jacob fucking Martinson.
—was in love with that swaggering megalomaniac prick! That news on top of the fact that Hermione had been goggling over the blond bastard all week had simply been too much. She had denied it, but Ron had known her since she was twelve years old—he knew all the signs. The nervous tucking of her hair behind her ear, the way she flicked the edge of her quill against her lips, and that breathy giggle… Ron had watched her use them all on Malfoy in the past few days.
Harry arrived early, although not earlier than Malfoy, who nodded at him curtly from across the canteen where he sat nursing a steaming mug. Harry prepared his own cup of tea and debated joining his temporary partner, but decided to go to his office and catch up on paperwork while he awaited news. The dementor team was not scheduled to meet until ten o'clock. It was with some relief that Harry greeted Ron's exuberant arrival into their office at 9:42.
"Do I mean nothing to you, Draco?" she cried as Potter stepped into another room. Draco pondered her question.
“Sabotage,” Harry said quickly. The previous night, some Slytherins had crept onto the Gryffindor floor (despite two sentinels and a barrage of Warning Charms – not that similar spells had stopped Harry and Ron) and dressed all of the giant nutcrackers in Slytherin robes and scarves.
A short time later, Harry knew praying definitely wouldn't help because he was surely going to hell, but oh was it ever worth it…
A splash drew his eye and he watched as Malfoy climbed from the pool, dripping wet and wearing next to nothing. He snatched up a fleece from a nearby chair and rubbed at his blond hair as he neared. "Welcome, Harry. Would you care for a swim? It's invigorating!"
!” Malfoy yelled, aiming at the legs of the nearest approaching treat-monster. The creature sprawled at his feet, howling, losing all ability to stand as its legs dissolved.
Teddy plopped onto the sofa next to Draco. "No, I am going to be an Auror like my mum and Uncle Harry."
Harry was baffled by the conversation. What possible reason could Malfoy have for seeking Harry's opinion of his date, or girlfriend, or whatever she was? Still, Malfoy had asked, and Harry was just drunk enough not to ponder the consequences for long. "Fine. She seems mean, and self-absorbed, and fake. She has about as much genuine warmth as that diamond you're wearing, and when she smiles it never reaches her eyes. She has an agenda that can be spotted a mile away and if she cared at all for another human being I would be astonished to see it." Harry clamped his jaw shut with effort and looked away. He kicked at the pile of rose petals at his feet, scattering them. "Sorry. Maybe you shouldn't have asked."
Harry's head snapped up. He knew what Malfoy had been up to, but even so he'd wondered if they would ever get to the actual reason for their visit. It was possible Malfoy had a chair fetish. Harry shied away from thoughts of Malfoy and fetishes; now was definitely not the time for that tangent.
Draco's eyes fluttered closed again and he bit his lip. His throat moved as he swallowed and Harry lurched upwards to attach his mouth to the slender column; he pressed desperate kisses to Draco's pulse point before capturing his lips again.
. The angry chant helped steady him and he repeated it a few dozen times for good measure before opening his eyes again to take stock of his situation. He was in a bloody forest. In his socks. Without his wand. In the rain. Without even a bloody cloak.
Draco looked around the space and shook his head with a smile. He had to give Pansy credit--once she got an idea in her head she tended to go all the way with it, particularly whenever it involved spending Draco's money. The loft looked fabulous. She had set up a variety of stations, complete with multi-coloured floating light sources. There were directional spotlights, assorted backdrops, and a moveable stack of furniture, from antique baroque sofas and chairs to modern bookshelves and tables. There was even a wrought-iron bed occupying one corner.
