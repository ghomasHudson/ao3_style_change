Harry nods. “Draco took the attic space for his lab. We had two spare bedrooms, one is Scorp’s and one will be the baby’s. We could convert the study to another bedroom, but we both use the study, and it’s a nice escape when the kids are all home.”
“We’re in negotiations.” Hermione rolls her eyes before gesturing at the plates on the counter. “Harry, would you? My wand is in my purse.”
Harry smirks briefly and then sobers. “We probably need to make some time for James to be alone with us before they go back. He may have questions he’s not comfortable asking in front of the others.”
“Of course, Aunt Hermione.” James climbs the stairs to Harry’s side and offers his arm, which Harry gladly takes.
Draco’s hold on Harry tightens. “That’s…that’s disgusting. That on top of the cooking and everything else.”
“Yeah.” James looks up at his dad and a smile quirks at the corners of his mouth. “It’s just different to see you with a man.”
“I’d like to be able to tell Blaise.” Harry nods as Draco continues. “We keep in regular touch, even though he’s been in Italy. His daughter just started Hogwarts, so he’s looking at moving back to England.”
Harry’s actually a little relieved. He honestly figured it had been more by this point, but he still wants to make sure that James is remembering what he’s been told before, regarding comfort and consent.
He steps out of his denims and Draco rises, running his hands back up Harry’s body to settle on his hips. “You’re absolutely gorgeous, Harry,” he says, voice raspy. “I hope you know that.”
“We’ll find out when they come in off the pitch. We only decided on this about fifteen minutes ago.” Draco shakes his head and rolls his eyes. “Harry just sort of blurted it out while we were on the patio. Guess that’s what I get for marrying a Gryffindor.”
“She called on the Floo not long after I woke up. She has some more books for you and a couple of new DVDs. I asked if she wanted to come on through and wait for you to wake up. She offered to bring dinner. She got here about fifteen minutes ago.”
“You realise we can’t actually tell much of anyone right now, unless we want the press to make an announcement for us.”
“Er, sorry about that.” Harry feels his face warm and hopes Draco blames it on the Floo connection instead of Harry’s embarrassment.
The Healer's footsteps descend the stairs and as soon as the Floo activates, Draco’s lips are on Harry’s and his hand is on his abdomen.
“Harry!” Hermione sounds torn between the anticipated scolding and hysterical laughter. “What on earth?”
“Would the magic necessary to support a male pregnancy and form the womb and canal be enough to cause that level of strain?”
“Are we avoiding the press today or enduring their nonsense?” Draco asks, rolling his eyes, clearly feeling that avoiding the press is the way to go. The first time they’d dined together at a wizarding establishment, the press had shown up and started taking pictures. They’d graced the front page of the Daily Prophet the next day. Harry is always game to avoid the press, so agreeing with Draco is quite easy.
“Draco,” Harry murmurs, eyes closed. His stomach is threatening to revolt once again. It’s been an ongoing struggle for the two weeks since finding out he’s pregnant.
Harry’s core is wrapped in strand after strand of malevolent magic, each twined around several others. It’s being held in check by his powerful benevolent core and Harry suspects if he had a less powerful core, he would already be dead. But that’s the thing with The Boy Who Lived: he has no intention of dying and leaving Draco behind.
Harry kisses Draco softly. “It’ll be ok, Draco. It might be awkward and a little fumbling and not perfect this time, but we’ll keep practising.” Harry winks and squeezes Draco’s hands. “Better now?” Harry waits for Draco’s nod and then lets go of Draco’s hands, and stretches back out on the blanket.
Harry directs the popcorn to the coffee table and reaches out to take both glasses of wine in his hands. He passes one to Draco as they sit down on opposite ends of the couch.
He settles on a pair of snug-fitting dark denims and a dark green fitted jumper over a dress shirt. Stripping off what he has on and sitting on the edge of the bed, Harry groans. He’s still half-hard from seeing Draco shirtless.
. Love like this happens in fairy tales, not in real life with your former childhood nemesis. Still, here he is, with his fiancé and their unborn son and their big, beautiful, blended family.
“I also just don’t know much about male pregnancy. I suppose I should learn. And James will need to learn, as well.” Harry pauses thoughtfully. “Do you want to see if Hermione wants to come for dinner?”
Harry sinks down on the couch and exhales. Despite the difficult revelation about what might have caused Ginny’s core to haemorrhage, he’s had a very enjoyable day with Draco. Unfortunately, he’s now more confused about what exactly is transpiring between them than he was before.
“James said as much.” Harry absolutely hates that his children are subject to this kind of scrutiny. He wants, more than anything, for them to just get to be kids.
“Bedroom suites are this way.” Bernice leads them towards a different section of the shop. “Do you know what pieces you’re looking for?”
“Of course.” The Healer adjusts her wand until the little boy’s face pops back in to focus. “Would you like some images of his face?”
“I’m right here, love, I won’t leave you alone even for a moment.” Draco immediately drops his leg and pulls Harry into his chest.
He’d sent a text and less than an hour later, Draco was leading him into an upscale clothing store. Harry had surrendered himself and given the man free reign dressing him. Draco had taken full advantage, pulling a wide variety of clothing, and Harry had obediently tried it on, enjoying the way Draco’s eyes appraised him while evaluating the clothes. Several hours later, he walked away with a sizable work-appropriate wardrobe and an outfit for the interview.
Once back home, they deposit their shrunken and lightened packages outside the bedroom. Draco starts levitating belongings out of the current wardrobe and dresser and into a couple of trunks while Harry retrieves the antidote to the Polyjuice.
“Shit, Draco. I’m sorry.” Harry locks the lab and touches Draco’s hip gently as they turn for the elevators. He hadn’t meant to make Draco wait on him; he’d just been so focused on his work, he hadn’t wanted to quit.
“Oh, Harry, don’t be silly. You’re very experienced with Dark Magic.” Claire puts her hand on Harry’s shoulder and gazes at him.
She turns and heads for the stairs, Harry following several paces behind. He knows she’s going to have a fit when she opens the door to his bedroom. His entire wardrobe is strewn on the bed.
“I just want the Malfoy name and everything it stands for to be left in the past. We — our whole family — we’re better than that.”
He’s found himself there quite often, usually with books on male pregnancy or raising children in a blended family. Today, he finds himself with a book of a different kind. He opens
“I do.” Draco doesn’t look entirely thrilled about this, but frankly, Harry isn’t either. “That’s why I chose somewhere Muggle tonight.“
“Draco and I will find someone reputable and discreet for you. Do you want to wait until Easter break to start seeing someone, or would you like us to arrange for you to see them privately while you’re at school?”
“It seems so surreal that we’re doing this. Like I’m living some kind of dream.” Harry looks over the large section of furniture. “Do you see anything you like?”
“Because I had Lily on my lap having a relatively identical conversation while you were having that one. She, James, and Matthew apparently discussed it while we were all out today.”
Harry looks up at the sound of feet on the stairs and smiles as a sleep-rumpled Draco comes into view. He turns off the hob and scoops the last of the eggs onto the two plates he’s been preparing. Turning to Draco, who has come up behind him, he kisses him softly.
“I’ve never rimmed someone or been rimmed, either. But I find the idea of rimming you incredibly appealing. I’d like to try being rimmed, as well.”
Harry knows what his own back yard looks like and is gazing at Draco instead. The setting sun makes his white-blond hair glisten like gold and gives his pale skin an almost ethereal glow. Harry’s breath catches in his throat.
“No, actually,” Draco says carefully. “I thought they were rather horrible for invading your life like that, but I didn’t read them. I didn’t read much from the wizarding world at that point, honestly.”
Harry’s brain ceases all coherent thought as he realises Draco is asking permission to undress him. “Yes, of course,” he manages.
Draco’s lips meet Harry’s and he’s flooded with warmth, both from Draco’s mouth and the contented feeling of starting 2020 with
Harry sighs and moves back again. “I’m happy to help,” he states, trying to put a note of finality in his voice. He eases himself back in the direction of his own station when Claire reaches out and puts her hand on his arm.
Healer Carr produces several images on parchment and hands them to Draco before vanishing the bubble and siphoning off the potion. “Everything looks picture perfect for a fifteen-week male pregnancy. Growth is right on track; everything looks well developed. We just need to check your canal, Mr Potter, and then we’ll be done.”
Harry shakes his head and turns to slice the bread. “No. I was told I could return, but I don’t want a job that puts my kids at risk of losing their only remaining parent. Especially given the family circumstances, it’s just not wise. So I’ll be looking for something new.”
Silver eyes are suddenly mostly black with arousal and Harry catches Draco’s whispered “fuck” before he answers.
“I will have you lift one knee to your chest and I will cast a relaxing charm and slide two lubricated fingers into your rectum. I’ll press lightly on the outside just above where the womb is sitting. That will allow me to feel a bump or bulge if the connection is being properly formed.”
With the help of both the Healer and Draco, Harry turns. He feels positively ridiculous like this, his arse sticking out of the water. But if he’s in labour, he supposes there will be a lot of feeling ridiculous today.
Harry summons another book and is once again thankful for Hermione. “Here. This book goes over an awful lot, but I’d like for you to do some reading.” James looks down at
“How do we do this?” Draco slides into a seat at the kitchen table with a full plate as Harry sits across from him.
“Here’s what we’re thinking.” Draco speaks gently, waiting for Matthew to lift his head. “We’ll give your parents these two weeks of break to process this. Once you get back to Hogwarts, you can write and ask them if you have a place in their home
Anything Harry thinks might help when he’s contracting, they try. Draco rubs his back, presses his hips together, and rocks their entwined bodies back and forth in turn, but nothing can actually quell the feeling of being turned inside out.
“Sweet Merlin,” Malfoy breathes, “I had no idea. That’s inexcusable. I mean, I wondered why Albus had never said anything around our place about his grandparents, but there are not grandparents in our situation either, so it was never something that was a topic of discussion.”
“All done.” Healer Carr straightens and covers Harry’s hips as he lowers his leg. Draco’s distraction had the desired effect and he hasn’t been focused on the invasive fingers, but on the love of his life and their son. “I think we can go four weeks, this time. I know you had a rough start of it with your pregnancy, but everything looks outstanding. You can always Floo if you have concerns.”
“That’s brilliant!” Harry is ready to burst with pride. He’s realised over the course of the last few months that Draco is incredibly smart — like, could-give-Hermione-a-run-for-her-money smart. This will move their research forward and might mean a treatment plan could even be ready for medical use by sometime next year.
“Yes. The womb builds a temporary connection to the rectum and then birth is much like it would be with a witch.” James sounds like he’s quoting directly from the book and Harry finds it terrifying reminiscent of Hermione.
“Very well.” Harry tries desperately to interpret the Healer’s expression but he can figure out nothing.
Harry pushes himself into a seated position and gratefully accepts the cup. Bringing it to his lips, he inhales the rich aroma before taking a sip. The warmth that spreads in his belly is partially from the coffee, and partially because Draco has remembered exactly what he drinks from Costa from the
“Of course. There’s documented evidence of gay men in most of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. The important thing is that you marry a pure-blood woman and produce an heir.” Distaste becomes evident on Draco’s face. “What you do discreetly on the side can be overlooked. Even the straight men have mistresses.”
“Nope. My aunt and uncle never took me anywhere as a child unless they had to.” Harry shrugs. “I had to stay in my cupboard if they went out somewhere fun with my cousin.”
“I need to pop over to the flat for some work clothes for tomorrow,” Draco says casually as he runs some dishwater in the sink. Harry notices how it’s become “the flat.” He smiles and sets the frying pan on the counter, picking up a towel to dry the dishes Draco’s washing.
“I know we’ve talked about consent, but I want to make sure you understand you do not have to consent to anything you’re not comfortable with. And you’re never to pressure Matthew to consent if he’s not comfortable.”
Draco meets his eyes in the mirror and Harry moans at that look alone. The blond holds eye contact as he slowly pulls his cock nearly out of Harry’s body. He sets a slow, deep rhythm, never breaking their gaze.
Suddenly there’s a weight in his lap, and he lifts his head to find Lily curling up there. She’s always been his snugglebug, and he’s missed holding her. She’s the only one of his children that still sits on his lap. He wraps his arms around her and holds her for a moment before he breaks the silence.
a label, but I’m not opposed to one,” Draco says, voice sounding much more relaxed to Harry’s ears. “I just…I feel like it’s more than ‘I’m dating someone’, but boyfriend sounds so…Hogwarts.” Harry doesn’t even have to look at Draco to know his nose is wrinkled at the thought. Harry snickers.
“We have a few things to discuss,” Draco begins, “but first, I want you to know that you are welcome in this house; you are loved and valued and there is absolutely nothing you should be ashamed of in this situation. Your parents are responsible for their own actions and reactions. Not you.”
Harry takes in his surroundings. There are two people in Mediwizard robes and a man in Healer’s robes. He’s clearly in St Mungo’s
Soft strains drift into the kitchen as Harry slides the last two plates into the cabinet. He smiles to himself and moves to wipe the counters so he can join Draco. They had cooked dinner together and — between kisses and soft touches — had managed to put together a fantastic meal. Draco had run a foot up and down his calf as they ate, as if he couldn’t stand for them not to be touching. It had been wonderful and intimate, even if it was nothing more than preparing a meal and eating it.
Healer Powell moves quietly out of the room, followed by the Mediwizards, and then Draco’s lips are on Harry’s forehead.
“I see.” Healer Carr turns her attention to Draco. “Your home-brewed anti-nausea potion, Mr Malfoy?”
He stares at the mirror, his pregnant belly fat with the child of the man who is driving into him. He wraps a hand around his own cock and gasps as it only takes a few pulls before he’s spurting white ropes onto the chair, arse pulsating around Draco.
Draco’s eyes open and seek out Harry’s. “That is absolutely delicious. I wouldn’t change a thing.” Draco’s eyes dart down Harry’s body for just an instant before he shifts back to his stool.
. Never in a million years would he have imagined Draco to be so protective and attentive, but he is, and Harry is finding it to be the balm he never knew his battered soul needed. He only hopes he can care for Draco as meticulously as Draco is caring for him.
“It’s been on my mind, and I thought that urge would go away, but instead it just keeps getting stronger.” He kisses those perfect pink lips softly. “I love you. I want to be bonded to you before Regulus is born. I want to be your husband when I birth our son.”
“Caramel Cortado, please.” Harry smiles at the barista and reaches for his wallet. Draco’s hand on his arm makes him pause.
know that dating me — that being in a relationship with me — comes with…Er…” Harry rolls his eyes. “Publicity, I guess?”
Sweaty and laughing, Harry yanks open the door to the Quidditch locker room and dashes inside. A quick glance over his shoulder reveals that Draco is gaining on him. He drops his broom on the bench and grasps the fluttering Snitch tighter as he sprints for the storage room to take refuge.
“That’d be lovely.” Harry balls the pillow against his chest again. Sweet Godric Gryffindor, he has a date. With Draco fucking Malfoy.
“Absolutely. Come up to our room and we’ll talk.” He feels Draco shift behind him so they can both stand. “Will you three put away the leftovers when you’re done?” he asks the younger children.
“Okay.” Harry gives Al a reassuring smile. “I think we need to find something to help you so it can change.”
Harry releases the catch on the box and the paint flies before settling nearly around the top half of the room. The midnight blue goes beautifully with the white beadboard that covers the bottom part of the walls.
“They’d never believe it,” Harry says, far more huskily than he intends. He lets his vision linger on Draco, hesitant to break this moment that he doesn’t quite know how to interpret.
“He is.” Harry shrinks all three trunks and casts a featherweight charm over them before Draco scoops them up and pockets them.
But since that day on the platform, they’ve become fast friends and he’s felt no discomfort speaking openly, even when they disagree. He finds Draco interesting and thoughtful and kind. Not that he’s perfect — his temper is still quick to rise, even though he’s better at controlling it, he rants when he’s frustrated, and he gives a wicked cold shoulder when he’s angry — but Harry’s not perfect either. Harry dares to hope that maybe they—
“Let’s go join the boys and once we’re done picking out furniture, we can send them elsewhere and let the press do their leering at us. At least that might keep them away from the kids.”
to help. Harry knows that his fiancé is struggling watching him uncomfortable and being unable to help. It’s gotten progressively worse over the last week or so, and they’ve both found that Draco doesn’t deal well with Harry in pain.
“Yes. Brightest star in Draco. And you and our son are the brightest spots in my life in a very long time.” Draco’s emotions are wild in his voice — some combination of love and happiness and maybe being overwhelmed by having more of both than he’s been accustomed to in life.
“Let me see it.” Harry sits completely upright, voice harsh as he cuts off the Healer’s explanation.
Draco’s grip on his hand tightens, and Harry is astounded how much their baby has changed in the three weeks since his last appointment. While Harry was glad to be past the more frequent monitoring stage, he’s missed seeing their sweet baby every week.
Draco furrows his brow thoughtfully. “Maybe a mirror? The one in the en-suite is fine, but it might be nice to have one in the bedroom. We have plenty of room in there.”
“We can find a Mind Healer for you that specialises in Anxiety. They can figure out if there’s a chemical imbalance in your brain that is making this worse. There are potions you can take to fix the balance, and they can help you figure out how to cope when it gets bad.”
“Hmm,” Hermione’s brow is furrowed and one hand is twirling the ends of her curls idly. “Has he ever dated anyone seriously?”
Draco hands him a phial of potion and heads for the bathroom. The sound of water running creates another issue entirely. He swallows the potion and sighs. At over 37 weeks pregnant, he swears he spends half his time going to the loo, in the loo, or heading out of the loo.
“I’d love to see them.” Hermione catches Harry’s eye and the look on her face speaks volumes. She’s so happy for them, and it’s genuine and whole-hearted, but she also lost her partner — albeit in a different way — and hasn’t found what Harry and Draco have. Harry can see the moment she stuffs those emotions inside. “Have you told the kids yet?”
Propped in bed with Draco in a chair next to him, he listens to Healer Powell running over his most recent test results.
“We’re getting married Saturday evening. We decided we wanted to be bonded as husbands before this little one makes an appearance.”
“I’ll be right back with your water and a basin. We’ll get some more sleep and maybe things will look better in a couple of hours.”
Harry looks at Draco and then sighs. He just wants to curl up in Draco’s arms, but there’s so much to worry about. Outside the security of Potter Cottage, he knows that his safety, as well as Draco’s, could be at risk.
I’d really like to monitor you weekly for now, just until you’re through the first twelve weeks. Your risk of complications and miscarriage drops drastically at that point, and we would move to every 3-4 weeks at that time. It would, of course, pick back up when you get close to delivery.”
Being cradled against Draco’s firm chest anchors him, and being held by his husband’s strong but gentle hands reminds him that this baby, this product of his and Draco’s love, is making his way into the world and into their family.
“So, if you’re amenable…” Draco draws a deep breath and smiles nervously. “…I’d like that ‘forever’ to begin as soon as possible.”
Harry swirls his tongue around the head and Draco moans again. Wrapping one hand around the base, Harry licks the tip before placing his lips right over Draco’s slit and slowly sucking the head into his mouth.
“Draco. No one deserves to pay for the shite we went through as teenagers. And you certainly never deserved to pay for your father’s transgressions.” Harry’s voice softens and he squeezes Draco’s hand. “And maybe this will be the start of my
“He brought wine. He kept me company in the kitchen while I got dinner into the oven.” Harry’s hands head for his hair again, but he catches himself this time and forces them into his lap. He chews his bottom lip, rolling over memories from the previous night and trying to decide how to explain them.
Staring intensely at the mirror, Harry watches each button of his shirt pop open under Draco’s skilful fingers. As the final button comes free of its hole, soft hands push his shirt open, putting his rounded belly on display.
A moment later, he pulls off his glasses and lays them on the sink. Pulling his wand from his back pocket, he carefully spells his eyes to clear his vision and shudders.
“Probably. Nothing official yet, of course, but I think a core stabilisation potion before neutralising the malevolent magic would probably be the best course of action. The research they gave us at the case briefing showed that stasis magic doesn’t hold the core well.”
Harry can’t quite wrap his brain around how much of their previous conversations Draco has taken to heart. He’s repeating details Harry hasn’t mentioned since the first time they went to tea.
“You helped my partner and me find new bedroom furniture several weeks ago.” Harry nods towards Draco. “We had altered our appearance for privacy reasons.”
“He’s a great kid. Scorpius said he was really upset. I thought maybe he was being overly dramatic, but you do seem quite disconcerted.” Malfoy scrutinizes Harry, eyes intense.
He pulls back from the kiss and reaches to hold both of Draco’s hands. “I’ve always told my kids to have an open dialogue with their partners when the time comes.”
“There we are!” The healer’s face relaxes and she gestures to the bubble. “Do you see the dark circle?”
“Thank you for the opportunity. I’m excited to get started,” Harry says in return. And he really means it. After talking with Mr Mason, Harry is certain that this job will challenge him, but he finds it fascinating. He’s optimistic it will be fulfilling for him, as well.
Draco turns and waves his wand quickly over the closed door, setting his wards. “Would you like to pick up coffee? There’s a Costa just around the corner.”
Draco nods appreciatively. “You’d do well with some advanced study in psychology then, or possibly Healer training if you’re thinking of becoming a Mind Healer.”
“You never said Wizarding Wedgies were off limits!” he wheezes, arms going around Draco and holding him upright.
That, Harry knows, is a smile he hears in Draco’s voice. Relief and something akin to joy flood his body and the pillow is released from his grip.
“You’re bigger than you were a week ago, love.” Harry knows Draco thoroughly enjoys watching his tiny pregnant belly grow. “I can use a basic tailoring charm on the waistband to let them out just a little. Are they
“Hello, Hermione.” Draco’s voice holds none of the trepidation Hermione’s face had expressed, and Harry’s sure he’s trying to make this an easier transition. “Are you going to join us this evening?”
“I want his name to somehow represent both of us,” Harry explains. “Obviously, my notes for a girl are moot. I know for you, something celestial, but I don’t know what would represent me yet.”
They’re halfway through their tea when the Floo chimes. A few minutes later, there’s a soft knock on the open bedroom door.
“None taken,” Draco laughs, “but I am sure between the two of us we can help you feel better about your skills.”
“We’ll join them shortly. I really just wanted thirty seconds alone with you.” Draco pulls Harry close. “Today has been rather intense, and while I’m glad our ‘first outing’ will be behind us, it’s just exhausting. I don’t know how you’ve put up with this for so long.”
Draco’s chuckle is low. They’ve stopped at the rail overlooking the water. Harry leans against it and feels Draco’s firm chest make contact with his back. Draco’s arms slip snugly around his waist, and Harry leans into the embrace, sighing contentedly as the warmth from Draco’s body surrounds him.
“I know that, love. But you also never do anything lightly.” Draco sighs. “And it would be different if we needed the Galleons, but there’s enough gold between our vaults for us and all five kids to never need to work. And probably their kids, too, if we’re smart about it.”
Somehow, they both manage to drag themselves from bed and tug on their discarded pants before making their way into the kitchen. Harry snuggles against Draco’s chest as they wait for the coffee to brew. Draco smells of sex and Harry’s bedsheets, and he finds that incredibly enticing. A gentle hand comes to lift his chin, grey eyes shining with affection as Draco kisses him full on the mouth.
A slow, steady rhythm soon has Draco’s finger sliding fully in and out of Harry’s arse. Harry gasps as Draco crooks that finger to brush his prostate.
“You mentioned Granger helped you set up your television to work around magic, do you think she could be persuaded to ward one of these for my flat too?” Draco asks, gesturing to Harry’s telly. He sinks back onto the couch, more towards the middle this time, and reaches for the wine, topping off both their glasses.
straight. I can’t make myself straight. And I’m happy with my sexuality and with James. I don’t want to change that.”
After some careful manoeuvring, Harry is on his side and Draco is spooned against his back. Long, thin fingers rub his arms, his belly, his hips.
“Of course, Mr Malfoy. I’m glad to be of help.” Healer Carr pulls her wand and conjures a small table, setting her medical bag on top of it. “It’s lovely to meet you, Mr Potter, though I’m sorry about the circumstances.”
Harry’s still struggling to wrap his mind around the fact that he’s found Draco to be such pleasant company. His former nemesis seems to have grown into a genuinely good person. Harry has always known that Draco wasn’t really evil when they were kids— that he was a terrified child doing what he felt he had to do to survive. Harry had told the Wizengamot as much when he testified after the war, securing Draco’s pardon, but he’d never expected Draco to completely reject his family and his upbringing in this way.
There’s a responding kick and then the firm press of a foot. James presses his mouth to Matthew’s ear and Harry pretends not to overhear the whispered words, even though he does.
There’s a hand on Harry’s back and he turns to see Albus, with Scorpius just behind already wrapped in Draco’s arms. Harry draws his younger son into a tight hug.
He offers the quill to Scorpius, who signs the third line on the parchment. It immediately glows white and when the light fades, the Minister’s Seal is affixed to the bottom. Draco and Harry step around the altar to hug Scorpius between them, quickly joined by four more sets of arms. Harry reaches in turn to hug James, Matthew, Albus and Lily. Draco is his husband and they are all, officially, a family.
Immediately shuffling away, Harry smiles carefully at her. “I think you were right, Claire. The orange bit does appear to be Dark Magic, or at least close to it. I’d leave that bit for the Curse-Breakers.”
“At the risk of being overly forward in public, I know we’ve discussed it and we intend to get married in a year or so, but how soon do you want to be engaged?” Draco wraps one arm around Harry’s waist and takes his left hand gently in the other, tracing a path with his thumb over Harry’s finger where his engagement ring would sit. “Because I can’t help imagining sliding that ring onto your finger, and it’s wonderful.”
“Yeah, it’s pretty disconcerting the first couple times.” Harry looks carefully at Draco before kissing him softly. He feels the same familiar thrill that runs through him every time they kiss. “Oh good. That’s still there.”
Laughing, Harry shakes his head. He finds Draco’s fits of jealousy over Claire rather endearing. Claire wouldn’t be his type even if he wasn’t involved with Draco. “Even if she does, we just won’t confirm or deny. We only have to make it six weeks, and they’re already used to seeing us together. For all we know, they already assume we’re together.”
“Don’t laugh,” Draco warns, “but pizza and garlic bread from the Muggle place you took me to for lunch last week sounds amazing.”
“Draco and I are adults in a loving and committed relationship. We express that love and commitment in a variety of ways, including sex.”
“Except Matthew! Can he be a Potter?” Lily supplies. Harry looks at Matthew. Matthew would be welcome to change his name as well, but he’s not sure that’s what the young man will want to do. To Harry’s surprise, James speaks, not Matthew.
“You should see some of it abate when you’re spending more time laying down and reclining. You can also use some of the mild pain potions in the Pregnancy Potions Manual I gave Mr Malfoy. No more than four doses a day.”
Draco’s face is pensive. “Would you help me ward one if I pick one out today? Maybe one for Scorpius, also?”
“Is it over?” Harry whispers. He realises it must be. He can feel his magic again, so they’ve clearly administered the antidote. He opens his eyes to look into Draco’s relief-filled grey ones. A glance around reveals he’s back in his hospital room.
“Sure, Claire, I don’t mind. But you’re much more experienced than I am, so I’m not sure how much help I will be.” Harry places a light stasis over his imaging and steps over to Claire’s station.
When the sobs have slowed, Harry steps back and surveys both boys. They’re puffy-faced and red-eyed and Harry’s heart breaks all over again for his son and the boy he cares so much for.
Draco laughs as he places the empty plates back in the basket. Stretching out next to Harry, he lays on his side, head propped on one arm. The angles of Draco’s face look softer under the lights, and his alabaster skin is almost glowing. He looks absolutely gorgeous.
“I AM exhausted,” Harry admits. “I slept horribly last night without you. We had training for our new project this morning, then a working lunch, then this imaging disaster all afternoon.”
There’s a soft “pop” and then the smell of something citrusy reaches Harry’s nose. Draco shifts and two warm, slick hands are on Harry’s shoulders. Draco’s thumbs work into the muscles at Harry’s shoulders. He groans.
A faint blush rises on Draco’s cheeks, and he shoots Harry a smile that sends his heart fluttering. “Shall we head up, then?”
Harry closes his eyes and exhales, letting Draco’s words wash over him. He did know it was there. They did already talk about this. It’s just hard to see the evidence on Draco’s skin. He opens his eyes and nods. Draco dips his head to kiss Harry again, hands moving to the button of Harry’s denims. Harry moans at the friction against his half-hard cock.
time they’ve been together. And that was the day they picked out Draco’s television, well before their first date.
“So it was okay when you were gay, but not in a relationship with a man?” Pure-blood ‘rules’ make no sense to Harry, even now.
Harry snorts. Hermione is, and has been since age eleven, like his sister. The thought of anything romantic with her is simply off-putting. “That one’s even worse.”
“That’s a long time, Dad!” Al is clearly distraught at this timeframe. Harry takes a breath to explain but—
“We are, Daddy. We want you to finally be happy. You’ve smiled more since we got home than you did the whole month before we left. I like that.”
Draco kisses him softly again and eases the ring onto the fourth finger of Harry’s left hand. Harry stares down at it, mind whirling. Draco proposed. They’re getting married. Not that he didn’t know they were eventually getting married, but there’s a ring on his finger, and that just makes it so much more real.
“Draco…” Harry’s tired, and while he doesn’t want to turn down whatever Draco has in mind, he’s also not feeling up to being much of an active participant.
“Yes.” Draco’s refined accent has taken on an even crisper air than normal. “We’d like to look at engagement rings. Perhaps some wedding bands, also.”
“Oh, it’ll fit in the space I want to put it, all right” Draco mutters quietly, eyes glimmering mischievously.
The dildo stops, buried deep inside him, and Harry hears a moan behind him, combined with the sound of Draco taking himself in his lubed hand at a frantic speed. Before long, Harry feels a hot splash against his arse as Draco cums on him.
“I don’t know. I’ve told him I like the man he has become. We talked through all the war shite at our first tea, apologies and forgiveness were given. But I haven’t been…overly flirtatious?”
“I went back to sleep until the potion wore off and it immediately started again. It’s like being hit by a bludger.”
“I’ve got more energy this week. Healer Carr said it happens in the second trimester sometimes. I’m thankful for it. I’m really tired of being exhausted.”
“I don’t know why I’m so nervous,” he confesses. “I suppose it’s because I want this to go well, but it seems silly. I already know I enjoy your company.”
Harry returns to rest against Draco’s chest. He’s pretty sure he’s in whatever this is for the long haul, and he’s pretty sure Draco is, too. But what do two grown men, both single fathers, call something like this?
“It’s not something I’ve considered before, honestly.” Harry finds both Draco’s hands and takes them in his own. “Draco, I could have been completely happy with our life and our blended kids. But this is a baby that’s half you and half me. And the more I sit here and think about that, the more I think that’s wonderful.”
Less than an hour later, all four kids are packed and ready to use the Floo. Harry and Draco have given explicit instructions that they’re to keep quiet about the baby for now until it becomes public. The only exception is James who has permission to tell Matthew since they need to have a discussion about safe sex and contraception. Harry hopes James follows through in the entirety of the discussion, not just the pregnancy news.
“I didn’t know you’d written your mother.” Harry really isn’t sure how to feel about this piece of information. Draco is completely entitled to write to his mother if he chooses, but as far as Harry knows, they haven’t been in contact.
“Lily, sweetheart, I don’t understand either.” Draco’s voice is gentle. “Nothing any of you kids could ever do would make your dad or me want you to leave. Certainly not the gender of the person you’re attracted to.”
“He came over here?” Hermione’s voice is back to carefully controlled. She reaches over and gently tugs at one of his arms, urging him to look at her and stop pulling at his curls, now speckled with grey.
“Oh!” Harry chuckles. “I forgot, you’re not used to this. Polyjuice, Draco. Hermione makes sure I have some for situations that can’t easily be avoided but where being me — or being with me, I guess — isn’t feasible.”
Draco’s hand reaches for his abdomen, lovingly running his hands across the slight protrusion that had really not been noticeable before today.
“I think I’d like that.” Harry’s heart flutters picturing a ring like that on his finger. He knows that everyone will be aware of their relationship after today, but some part of him is anxious for the world to know that this is serious, and not the fling the papers will surely paint it as.
“I don’t think so.” Harry runs his fingers through his hair again and sighs. “And we didn’t go get dinner. He came over here instead. I cooked.” He gestures vaguely towards the hob before moving his hands back into his unruly locks.
“Thank you.” Draco turns towards Harry as he settles on the couch. “I was looking at your photographs.” Draco gestures to the mantle. “You’ve done a lot of travelling with your kids.”
“Draco. I need to say this. This is experimental and we both know it.” Harry takes a deep breath. “If something happens to me, please take care of my kids. Custody, as well as the house and vaults, are already arranged. The paperwork is in the warded drawer in the desk in our study. Just in case.”
“I’ve really been enjoying all the time we have been spending together,” Harry begins, hesitating as he pieces together his next words.
Harry leafs through the Sunday morning Daily Prophet, growing increasingly frustrated as he finds nothing in the Situation Vacant ads that appeals to him.
They stroll down to Wand and Wood and step inside. At first glance, Harry can tell that Draco has chosen well. There’s row upon row of well-made furniture with a varying range of woods but all classic designs.
“So she just expects you to break things off with me because of her sense of family…honour?” Harry knows Draco doesn’t ascribe to pure-blood ideals at all anymore, but the fact that this ever would have been an expectation is mind-boggling.
Harry files that bit of information away before he continues. “I like handjobs, but not too rough. I like having my bollocks played with. With hands or mouth, actually.”
of sixth year Arithmancy and Herbology this summer and half of seventh year, right? Plus, a good portion of Portions, Transfiguration, and Charms! And you’ve learned it
Harry is pacing fervently in front of the fireplace when the Floo turns green and Hermione steps out. She takes one look at Harry’s face and laughs.
“Never? Well, that’s a thing we need to try, then.” Harry traces invisible patterns on Draco’s chest with his fingers. “I enjoy both giving and receiving them. No teeth though.”
He bends and kisses Harry before leaving the room. When footsteps descend the stairs, Harry manoeuvres his swollen body to an upright position, leaning against the headboard, before pressing his glasses to his face.
“Of course, love.” Draco retrieves his mobile from the dresser and kisses him quickly. “Have a good nap. I’ll come down with a dose as soon as it’s done. I love you.”
Draco hums softly and Harry pauses to let him speak. “Handjobs are good. I’ve actually never had anyone else play with my balls, but I’m not put off at the thought.”
!” he nearly screams and the dildo obediently goes deeper. Harry both feels and hears the balls at the base of the dildo smacking against his arse.
“I never set out to keep it quiet,” Harry replies firmly, eyes meeting Malfoy’s and holding his gaze. “It’s not something I hide and it’s not something I’m ashamed of. The kids know, and so do my friends. Ginny knew.” Harry takes a deliberate breath and waves a discreet hand over his cup, warming his now-cold tea. “Most people just assume, I guess, since I married a woman. And I haven’t dated or anything since Ginny died. I haven’t really done anything since then besides raising the kids. I retired early from the Aurors at the end of my paternity leave and it’s been me and them ever since.”
“No. Just a big stretch and some burning. I’m ok. You’re just…” Harry huffs. “You’ve got a big cock, Draco. I’ll be fine once I get adjusted.” Draco laughs softly and leans forward, kissing Harry, tongue dipping into his mouth.
“You should probably call the Aurors for security. They’ll post a guard to ensure staff safety as well, in case someone gets wind of my admission.”
“Mr Potter, how are you feeling?” Healer Carr follows Draco into the bedroom where Harry is already laying in the bed, waiting. Draco sits in the chair they’ve moved next to Harry’s side of the bed and takes his hand.
James' face is pale, but he leans forward to smack his brother upside the head. "So's every gay man at Hogwarts."
Draco says nothing, but Harry tips his head back to see him weeping openly. Those emotions his husband works so hard to control around people he doesn’t know are on display. Harry opens his mouth to tell Draco how much he loves him, but the next wave of pressure overtakes him.
Draco breaks the kiss and lifts his weight off Harry’s body, rolling to lay beside him and Harry shivers at the loss of contact and body heat. Draco tugs Harry over to lay on his stomach and gently prompts him to raise on his knees. Harry willingly and rapidly obliges, canting his arse into the air and closing his eyes as he pillows his head on his arms. He feels Draco’s fingers run down his body and sees one of Draco’s legs slide into view as Draco sits behind him. Firm, warm hands caress his arse, moving to hold his hips, and Harry feels hot lips kiss him gently where the hands were just moments before.
“Well, yes, but you’re incredibly open with your kids about everything. I somehow expected it to be…less internally agonising.”
“Arms up,” Draco says softly and Harry immediately obeys. He hears his shirt softly fall to the floor and stares up as Draco removes his own. Merlin, he cannot get enough of looking at this man. He takes in Draco’s pale, muscled torso. He’s not broad, but he’s solid and Harry finds him absolutely gorgeous.
Harry shakes his head. He’s not usually one for stomach bugs, so he doesn’t keep it in their potion cupboard.
“Obviously, I had to discuss some of it further before he left for Hogwarts. The war is covered in History of Magic and our name is affiliated with Voldemort. I wanted to make sure he knew that’s not who we are now.” Malfoy shakes off the unease and looks back to Harry. “But anyhow, no grandparents in our situation, either.”
“Harry’s really pregnant?” Scorpius’ face is schooled into a carefully neutral expression. Harry’s come to learn this means he hasn’t decided how he feels, yet.
“What questions do you have?” Draco speaks up, stepping closer to Harry and laying a hand on the small of his back.
“No one has to, except me, Draco, and your Mind Healer. Possibly the Headmistress if your Mind Healer treats you while at Hogwarts. You can choose who to tell and when to tell them.”
“I think it’s perfect.” Draco turns to look back at him and Harry is startled to see the open affection and joy in those silvery eyes.
“No, you haven’t upset me.” Harry braces himself and forges ahead. “It’s actually at the other end of the emotional spectrum.”
The Headmistress sits in the armchair across from them. Harry watches as she begins to pour tea from the table between them, trying to decide if it’s better just to get on with the rest of their announcement. He glances at Draco, who nods.
“It’s just help between co-workers?” Draco asks in a voice that clearly indicates he thinks otherwise. Confused, Harry tries to figure out what Draco is getting at. Claire is overzealous and chatty and touches people way too much, but she’s his co-worker and she’d asked for help.
“You’re not the only one who didn’t sleep well.” Harry looks more intently at Draco’s eyes and notices the tired lines there. “Why don’t we go get some takeaway and watch a film on the couch?”
“You are most welcome. Have a seat, gentlemen.” She gestures to the small sitting area. The men settle side by side on the couch.
Harry watches as Draco pulls out sandwiches and crisps and fruit and slowly becomes more lost for words. Everything — down to the flavour of crisps — is something Harry’s eaten in front of Draco before.
Harry blinks in surprise. He hadn’t expected Draco to embrace this much Muggle technology at once. “Sure! We can do that after we finish here.” Harry’s phone buzzes in his hand and he glances down. “Hermione says that one will work.” Harry smiles at Draco, who looks pleased at the news.
“That will be part of this process, too. If they say you do, you can make that choice. If they say you don’t, we will have it in writing and that will make the next part easier.”
Draco smiles at Harry before turning to lead him out of the hidden Apparition point. Walking hand in hand with Draco is nearly surreal. Harry hasn’t been with
“This smells wonderful,” Hermione says, stepping to Harry for a hug. He breathes deeply, comforted by the floral scent of her shampoo that hasn’t changed since they were kids, and holds her close for a moment. She has been his only constant for all these years and having her around grounds him.
Fingers dip into the waistband of Harry’s trousers, sliding under his belly and working them slowly down over his hips. Harry watches intently in the mirror as Draco sinks to his knees, helping Harry to step out of his trousers.
“I certainly think it has — minus the being ill, of course — but I’m in a different position than you are. I know you’ve been okay with everything, but I wasn’t sure you thought it was all
“Let’s try Wood and Wand. They usually have nice pieces that aren’t…ostentatious.” Draco smirks. “Unless ostentatious is what you’re going for.”
The hand slips from his hair under his chin and Harry finds his face being tipped up for a kiss. Slow and soft, Draco covers Harry’s mouth with his own. Harry feels Draco’s tongue gently run along his lips and he grants him entry. The heat pooling in Harry’s belly moves lower, and he’s straining against the fabric of his jeans.
“Harry and Draco, I cannot express what a privilege it is to bond the two of you as husbands. While you’ve chosen a simple ceremony, the bond you have chosen is strong. It will entwine your magic, your souls, and your love for the rest of eternity.
“Oh, I don’t mind.” Draco grins and Harry’s heart flutters at the sight. “Quite the opposite, actually.”
“Why don’t you Floo-call and see? Maybe we can get that squared away today and then pay Minerva a visit later this week to make sure it’s all on file at Hogwarts. And we can check on Matthew at the same time.”
“For now, there’s dinner in the kitchen.” Draco gestures to the counter, where the pans of pasta sit abandoned. “I’ll hit it with a couple of warming charms and we can eat. James and Matthew can join us when they’re ready.”
“Of course not. But he invented Sleekeazy’s. That’s where my family got all their gold. I still get a quarterly payout from them. It was part of the terms of sale when he sold the company.”
“It’s fine, Dad.” James looks concerned, as well. “Draco will take us. You really look like you could use the rest. You’ll write though, to let us know when you feel better?”
“I would be quite all right with that. Come on, let’s go ride the Eye.” Draco leads Harry to a secluded entrance at the base of the London Eye, giving his name to the hostess.
“Let’s go in here.” Draco tugs Harry’s hand and he follows Draco into a shop. He glances around and realises Draco has pulled him into The Dragon’s Eye, one of London’s premiere wizarding jewellers; Harry can’t help but laugh.
Harry removes the rolled message and feeds Pyxis several treats before she makes her way to the owl perch. “Waiting for an answer, are you?” Harry leans over the kitchen table, spreading the parchment to read.
“Sure. Let me finish getting myself together and I’ll be right over.” Harry’s heart soars at the thought of spending more time with Draco.
Harry works his way around Draco’s opening, tongue coaxing him to loosen up with short firm licks. Draco is no longer using words, but his body speaks for him, pressing back against Harry’s face, moaning without restraint.
“I tried to explain that I’ve been attracted to boys since before Hogwarts, but she didn’t seem to care. She told me I was ungrateful for everything they did in raising me, and then told me if I was going to continue with this ‘lifestyle choice,’ I couldn’t stay in their home and I shouldn’t depend on anything from them.
“Come on then, you two,” Hermione gestures to the open French doors, “let’s go out into the garden and give your dads a minute.”
“Fuck, Harry. Do you have any idea how amazing you look like this? Spread open, hole dripping, waiting for my cock?” Harry feels the blunt press of Draco’s head against his hole. Draco pushes forward and Harry’s rim stretches and he feels Draco hesitate.
“I’m sure Hermione will help decorate a little place out here in the garden. Maybe an arch and some flowers.”
Matthew is immediately in James’ arms and Harry and Draco are wrapped around both boys. For several long minutes, the men hold the two sobbing teenagers, neither able to keep tears from tracking down their own cheeks.
“Draco.” There comes a point where this question is no longer cute. Harry has reached that point. “If I start to feel worse, I will tell you. I promise.”
“…and then we did a full series of core imaging. It’s certainly not normal for a pregnant man, but it’s not something we’ve seen—“
“We probably need to put his mobile on our plan, as well. I’m not sure if his parents will cancel it in anger.”
A few moments later Draco’s eyes widen as he realises what he’s said, but Harry moves swiftly to cup Draco’s ivory cheek.
“I have. I never got to travel as a child, so it’s been an adventure for all of us. It’s also brought us closer together,” Harry smiles at the memories. “As I said over dinner, we’re close and have a really open relationship. My kids all know they can talk to me about anything, and I want it to stay that way.”
“I would, too. I know you’re ill, but so far, I can’t see any evidence that you’re pregnant. Seeing that tiny baby in the bubble reminds me that it will be worth it in the end.”
It’s always been hard since it’s the day his parents died, but since Ginny’s death, it’s always seemed just a little more difficult. He never wanted his kids to grow up without one of their parents, and he’s terrified of them ending up with no parents at all. The day just weighs heavily on him.
“Well that’s something,” she says with some satisfaction. She waves her hand in a rolling, dismissive gesture. “
“I’m so glad I can be the source of your entertainment this morning,” Harry says, sarcasm lacing his voice.
Lily wins the dinner battle. Pizza is ordered and the kids quickly settle into their rooms, Scorpius choosing the room next to Al’s. Harry pauses at the door to James’ room, seeing him sitting on his bed, expression pensive.
“Me, too. I just didn’t foresee any situation where I’d have a…” At Draco’s pause, Harry cranes his neck and looks up at him inquiringly. Draco looks down at him and shrugs. “I’m not sure what to call this.”
Matthew sputters and turns beet red. Clearly James, who merely blushes and nods, did not prepare him for the level of openness in the Potter household. Based on what Harry has learned about the McLellands, he’s not really surprised that Matthew isn’t used to a frank discussion about sex.
“I’ll make sure I spend some time just with him after we tell them. If he’s not ok with it, we can make a different plan.” Draco pauses thoughtfully. “I really do think he’ll be ok with it, though. He’s a pretty laid-back kid.”
They rock until the contraction subsides and Harry sits on the edge of the bed. His whole body throbs with the aftermath of the intense tightening of his muscles and whatever — Regulus, he assumes — shifted so violently inside him. He knew labour would be difficult, but he was not prepared for the radiating pain from which there is no relief.
“Merlin, Harry. I’m falling hard, too. And I’ve…fuck.” Draco pauses and closes his eyes. Harry runs his thumb gently along Draco’s finger and gives him the time he needs. “I’ve
“We can secure tutoring if you’d like, James, but I’d be happy to help you study this summer. I’m certain your Aunt Hermione would, as well.” Draco smiles. “You do realise we were the top two in our year at Hogwarts, yes?”
“Harry!” Hermione sighs, exasperation creeping into her tone. “Why don’t you start at the beginning of whatever is going on between you and…well, let’s start there. What’s her name?” She folds her hands on the table and Harry is happy to see her gentle expression.
Draco nods, but before he can answer, the Floo roars to life and Hermione steps out. Harry gives Draco a look that says they’ll talk about it later and wraps Hermione in his arms.
He ties the letter to Edgar, the great horned owl he’d adopted from the Wizarding Owl rescue several years ago. “You can wait for an answer if he has one,” Harry tells the bird, before standing, stretching, and heading for the shower.
“All right, let’s do this. It’ll all be out in the open in a couple of hours.” Draco kisses him quickly and they head for the stairs. A firm arm slips around Harry’s waist and he smiles at Draco’s protective behaviour. Any time he can offer support or a little extra safety, he always does.
Harry waits for the nausea to subside, then nods. Draco passes him the potion and supports him as Harry tips his head back to take it. Vanishing the sick and casting a cleaning charm for Harry’s mouth, Draco puts the basin back on the table and pulls Harry against his shoulder, holding him while they wait for the potion to kick in.
Harry carefully shrugs off her hand. He doesn’t particularly like to be touched by people he doesn’t know well, and Claire has tended to be a bit…handsy, for lack of a better word. He moves away from her, closer to her Magiscope, and presses his eyes to the eyepiece. He’s studying a particularly tight tangle of magic when he feels a hand resting on his back. He shrugs the hand off and slides his wand into the Magiscope to gently prod at a particularly ambiguous-looking spell.
“The headline is better than it could be, I suppose. At least it’s not ‘Saviour to Wed Death Eater’s Son,” Draco quips.
“Well, not just that,” Harry admits somewhat sheepishly. “He owled me yesterday and asked if I wanted to get dinner.”
“Absolutely. Take whatever time you need. They do plan to start the interview process this coming week, but it will be ongoing as they get the department running.” Draco pauses to gaze in the window of the confectioner’s shop as they pass before looking Harry in the eye. “I really do think you’d be absolutely perfect for the job. Plus, they’re very flexible with schedules, and I know you wanted to be able to have holidays and summers with your kids.”
“I did.” Regulus rewards Draco’s rubbing with another kick. “He really is wound up in there tonight, isn’t he?”
Putting himself between Harry and the mirror, Draco frees Harry’s straining erection from his pants. Kissing the tip, he slides the soft fabric free and returns to take Harry’s cock into this mouth.
“You cannot earn your way into this family, Matthew. You’ve been chosen. You also cannot do anything to be removed from it, save your own personal choice to leave. And even if you did that, you would still be loved and welcome if you chose to return.”
“Harry.” Draco’s voice is firm now. “You’re exhausted and you’re frustrated. It’s getting late. You’re not going to be able to focus tonight. Let me take you home.”
He sets the dildo and the lube on his nightstand, spells his bed and himself clean with a wave of his hand, and gives in to sleep on the waves of his post-orgasmic euphoria.
Smiling to himself, Harry resumes his task and sets a slow, steady pace. The soft whimpers and moans falling from Draco’s mouth go straight to Harry’s aching cock.
Sighing in resignation, Harry reaches into his bedside table and retrieves a phial of lubricating potion. He shoves down his pants, adds a couple of drops to his palm, and takes himself in hand. Eyes closed, he brings the image of Draco to mind — his smile, his face, his bare chest —- and he’s fully hard in just a couple of strokes.
Standing in front of the mirror, Harry smoothes his robes and turns again. He sighs and pokes his head out of the bedroom door.
“I did, but then I divorced my wife and continued to live as openly gay, which evidently was reasonably acceptable, or at least acceptable enough not to cause the social drama of disowning me.” Draco rolls his eyes. “I’m assuming the most unacceptable part of my current relationship is that it’s with you.”
“It will. I’m so ready to finally see the baby that I’ve watched grow from the outside. I didn’t get to see Scorpius being born, I’m so glad I’ll get to be with you for Regulus’ birth.”
“Yes.” Harry wants him to stay tonight and any night after. He doesn’t know exactly what that means, yet… But at least he can have Draco tonight.
Living with Draco, Harry decides, is the best kind of wonderful and the best kind of boring, all wrapped in one. He slides the pan of asparagus into the oven next to the chicken and potatoes he’s been baking and turns to put together a salad. It’s been over two weeks since Draco officially moved in, and they’ve fallen into a comfortable routine around work and home.
Harry pads after Draco into the bedroom. He smiles softly when he sees a bag from the first Indian place they went to together.
Harry finally blinks his eyes open and gropes for his glasses. Sliding them on, he finds Draco sitting against the headboard, wire-rimmed reading glasses on, and a book in his lap. Harry loves Draco in those glasses. They somehow just make him look that much more handsome.
Harry turns his head quickly, quite sure he looks like he just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. “I’m sorry. I got lost in my head thinking about how good it feels to be here, next to you.”
“Bigger! I’m still tired, but the nausea finally seems to be relenting. I’ve only been nauseous two mornings this week. I also think I felt the baby move today. It was a bit like a fish wiggling.”
“I don’t know. We’ll need to help him get one if he doesn’t. And make sure he has sufficient gold for what he needs at school.”
“Having a baby with the man I’m in love with.” Draco’s fingers card gently through Harry’s hair. “I never expected to fall in love and beyond that, I can’t carry. And I never would’ve pushed for us to adopt or have a surrogate. I’m still trying to wrap my brain around the surprise, but I can’t find it anywhere in myself to be sorry this is happening.”
Before he can regain some control of his gut, he hears footsteps return. Harry hears, rather than sees, Draco settle on the bathroom floor beside him.
“That should do it.” Draco is clearly not thrilled with where they’re going, even if they both know it’s a good choice for the disruption. For all his appreciation of the finer things in life, Draco despises the wealthy culture he was raised in. “At least their food is good.”
“I would prefer that you wait until you’re older and in a committed relationship, but I’m also not going to tell you that you can’t have sex. That being said, if you’re not completely sure you’re both ready, you’ll need to wait.”
“Of course.” Harry traces his thumb over the soft skin of Draco’s hand. “I’m not one for holding back, Draco. I have extremely open communication with my kids and my friends and I’d like to continue that with you through…” Harry squeezes Draco’s hand and glances back at him.“…this.”
“Why don’t you try to sleep it off if you can? We’ll see if you feel better in the morning. I’ll get you some water and a basin, just in case.”
“Vision charm, I think,” Harry replies immediately. “If Draco kisses me, I don’t want to have to worry with my glasses. Not the first time, at least.”
“Yes, the same I’ve always brewed. He just had a third dose before I called you. But he hasn’t kept anything down all day.”
Draco hurries from the room, and Harry lays one arm on the cool porcelain, resting his head on top of it. He can’t remember the last time he felt this ill. He’s just decided to close his eyes when the queasiness returns and he’s forced to endure more violent spasms from his stomach. The muscles in his abdomen protest loudly, but he can do nothing to stop the retching.
“Very well. Let me start this bloodwork, and we’ll make sure the baby is doing all right.” She turns to her table, and Draco turns back to Harry. Soft lips kiss his forehead and a hand cups his cheek.
Hair as controlled as it gets, vision charm in place, wand in his holster, Harry is as ready as he can be. After all, there’s nothing to be done about the fluttering nerves in his stomach. He stands in front of the fireplace and places both hands on the mantle, leaning on it for a moment and taking a deep breath. Tossing powder into the Floo, Harry calls “Center for Rare Magical Maladies” and steps into the flames.
“Ok, kids. We’re meeting Matthew in front of The Spotted Owl, then brunch before shopping. Ignore the stares, please. Don’t make rude gestures at the press once they find us. Stay out in front of Draco and me so we can keep an eye out.”
“I can; I noticed a couple of days ago. It just feels like something hard is sitting between my hips.”
“I don’t use the service much,” Draco says casually. “It’s not that I don’t go into Muggle areas, I do quite often. But I usually don’t purchase something that would need to be delivered.” Draco hesitates before continuing, his voice taking on a gentler tone Harry can’t quite interpret. “I’ve never had someone I trusted to help me navigate something like purchasing a television or a mobile that would need to be adjusted to work with magic.”
Harry puts the bread on a plate and shuts the finished salad in the cooling cupboard. “That’ll take about another half an hour in the oven. Would you like to see the rest of the house?”
“Are they going to let you independently fundraise, then?” Draco asks, settling at the table with Harry. “You mentioned that last week.”
“Yes. They’ll deliver it to the Muggle entrance of my building this afternoon. My doorman will retrieve it and bring it up,” Draco explains as they head for the phones.
By the time Harry's finished the washing up and cleaned up the kitchen, two more owls are impatiently tapping the window panes. Pushing open the window, he ushers in Woody first. Woody, ostensibly named after Oliver Wood, one of James’ favourite quidditch players, allows Harry to untie the parchment before nipping him on the ear and going to join Cupcake. “You’re a right arsehole, you are,” Harry grouses at the bird. Midnight, Albus’ owl, hoots softly where she waits by the window as Harry removes the final parchment and gives her a quick pat. “Go on then, girl. Have some treats and rest.”
Harry nods and turns towards Draco to reach for the basil. “And their cleaning. And their yard work. And anything else they didn’t want to do.” He shrugs. “My childhood was pretty much crap. As a parent, I’ve basically tried to do the absolute opposite of everything done to me growing up.”
He hears Draco take a steadying breath, then his legs are being nudged apart. Harry willingly makes room for Draco between his legs and moans softly as hands squeeze the globes of his arse lightly. The hands disappear and Harry hears that distinct “pop” of a vial opening again. He shivers as Draco’s cleaning charm moves through him, then warm lube is dripping into his crevice.
“Not right now.” Draco chuckles. “Probably in the future, but we haven’t got a concrete timeline for that kind of thing.”
“Yes. We wanted to tell them in person, and I’m afraid I’m already starting to show.” Harry gestures to his stomach, hidden today beneath his robes. “We didn’t want the media to end up catching on and make the announcement before we told the children.”
“It certainly wasn’t planned, and we were both rather shocked. But I’m finding it impossible to be anything but excited about having a baby with Harry.”
“There’s a higher rate of miscarriage and complications in male pregnancies. I already almost lost you both once.” Draco snuggles him closer. “I’ve never been so scared in my life as when I kissed you and walked out of that procedure room, Harry. I want us to do everything we can to make sure the both of you stay healthy.”
?!” Lily is practically squealing with excitement at this news. Harry laughs outright. He’s been concerned that Lily, who was somewhat accustomed to receiving all of her father’s attention the last two years, would feel pushed aside by Draco. This is, apparently, a non-issue.
Draco lifts Harry’s chin and cups his cheek gently, then covers Harry’s lips with his own. Harry immediately relaxes into the warmth that emanates from Draco’s body before parting his lips and deepening the kiss. Draco’s tongue slides along his own, gently dancing together and exploring each other.
Malfoy nods, understanding settling in his eyes “I’ve done something similar with Scorpius. He grew up knowing the basic facts regarding my parents. He knew they followed a bad man with wrong ideas about blood purity and magical power. I didn’t feel the need to disclose further when he was young. He’s met my mother twice. He never had contact with my father. I’ve made sure to teach him differently than I was taught. More details would not make the situation better, so I opted not to get into it.”
“Wanker,” Harry retorts as they set off down the sidewalk. Draco's subsequent laughter is music to his ears.
Draco shrugs. “It was fine. Crowded. Got some strange looks having Hermione with me instead of you. We’ll see if the Prophet chooses to speculate wildly,”
Matthew nods and tugs on James’ hand, indicating that he’d like his boyfriend to come with him. They slowly climb the stairs, and Harry turns to look at his fiancé.
They lay in silence — but for their breathing — for long minutes before Harry shifts himself into Draco’s arms and, exhausted, drifts to sleep.
Harry gives Draco a brief tour of the house, leaving out the attic and his children’s bedrooms, but spending a bit of extra time in the study, before guiding him back downstairs and throwing open the French doors leading to the back patio. The sun is drifting down toward the horizon, setting the sky on fire. Draco steps past Harry, gazing around the sprawling yard.
“Do any of you need us to go with you for anything specific?” Draco turns to Scorpius. “Scorp, did you decide if you want new furniture for your room or prefer to bring over what’s at the flat?”
“Write if you need us, or ask the Headmistress to Floo.” Draco’s hand rests on Harry’s back and Harry can feel the tension radiating from him. He’s not ready to let them go, either. “Go on, then.”
Harry is suddenly wrapped in Draco’s arms and they’re chest to chest and Draco is kissing him deeply. “Fuck, Harry,” he breathes, pulling back just enough to speak. “This feels like a dream.”
Harry watches them go, smiling fondly at the sight of all his five children together out on the lawn, waiting for the ceremony to begin.
“Thanks,” Harry says as Malfoy places a cup in front of him with the milk and sugar. Harry adds a splash of milk and takes a spoon of sugar.
Draco rises from his stool and slips it back beneath the counter. “I would like that very much. Lead the way.”
“Should we give my solicitor a heads up?” Draco reaches over and takes Harry’s hand, tracing gentle patterns up and down his fingers, but even Draco’s touch isn’t enough to quell his increasing irritation over dealing with the press. “He can at least have something prepared to send out to any publications that cross the line, especially regarding the kids.”
“Hey there, girl,” Harry says, running his hand affectionately over the owl’s back. “You and Lily made it all right, then?”
Harry eases back from the kiss and runs his fingertips down Draco’s cheek. He hopes, fervently, that Draco loves him as well, or will soon.
“No, but let’s go anyway.” Harry feels Draco turn and the twist behind his navel sends his head swirling.
“You said exposure to Dark Magic in childhood can cause hidden damage,” Harry utters in a soft, haunted voice.
“Is it that late already?” Draco’s surprise makes Harry chuckle. His fiancé loses himself in his work quite often. Having the lab at home has led to some unintentional late-night brewing when he forgets to set a
“I will take him to London tomorrow and get a vault started for him and move his mobile to our plan. That should keep him protected from any revenge moves his parents may take.”
“I love you. I’m happy with you. We have a great relationship and a fabulous sex life and we’re making plans for a life together.” Harry screws his eyes shut and tries to reign in his frustration. “I hate that we’ve had to keep our relationship a secret this long, and I hate that we have to worry about ramifications from the press and the public instead of just enjoying being happy together. I hate that being with me is going to subject you to Merlin knows what kind of bullshit.”
.” He mutters and the pace accelerates. Harry lets a loud moan escape and his breath quickens further. A squelching sound replaces the silence of the room as his hole greedily accepts the repeated intrusion of the long, thick dildo.
“You got us a private pod?” Harry shoots Draco an incredulous look. No one had ever gone to this much effort for him or made him feel so special. He suspects Draco may set out to spoil him if this relationship goes well.
Draco emerges from the pantry with a case of butterbeer just as Hermione steps through the flames. Harry winks at him before he moves to hug Hermione hello.
Harry closes his eyes and attempts to reign in the swirl of thoughts and emotions in his head. He certainly didn’t know he could get pregnant. He didn’t plan on becoming pregnant. And if he’s being very honest with himself, he doesn’t necessarily
Hermione’s expression is a mix of surprise, relief, and a bit of trepidation. She’s seen Draco multiple times since he and Harry became friendly and started dating, but not since Draco moved in. Harry feels like she’s not sure of her place in the house where she’s always been welcome before, now that it’s “theirs” and not “his.”
Harry breathes in the cooling autumn air and mulls over how very much he’s enjoyed spending the afternoon with Draco. So much so, that they parted with a friendly handshake, agreeing to owl and find time to get together again. Plus, Harry can’t deny that he finds Draco very
“If you look here—“ Healer Carr gestures to the image she’s just frozen, “—you can see tiny arms and legs beginning to form.”
Al heads for the door and meets Draco on the way out. Draco is carrying two good-size stoppered bottles of potion, which he sets on the dresser.
The strange sensation continues travelling up his body and with it, he becomes aware of his breathing and the sting of something in the crook of his right arm.
“That’s the last of it.” Draco closes the doors to his wardrobe and turns to Harry. Harry settles his hands on Draco’s hips and kisses him softly. Draco huffs out a laugh against his lips and Harry eyes him curiously. “We’re living together. Just kind of surreal.”
Draco lazily lifts his wand and the wireless begins to play the same song they’d danced to in the living room, the first night they’d made love.
“Now that you've brought this, hopefully he can stop throwing up long enough for us to figure that out.”
Harry drifts into consciousness and stretches one arm to the other side of the bed, eyes still closed. His hand finds a warm thigh and there’s a gentle chuckle. Since Monday, he and Draco haven’t spent a night apart. Nothing has been said since that first night Harry asked him to stay — it's just become how it is.
Harry’s palms flatten against the wet shower walls, scrabbling for something to grip where nothing exists. Draco’s tongue presses past his entrance, and his hips involuntary thrust back, eager for more of that delicious sensation.
A few minutes pass and Harry is finally able to lift his head to take the water glass Draco offers, swishing the cool liquid in his mouth and spitting it out. He finally looks at Draco, who is ruffled from sleep but looking very concerned.
Draco immediately guides his legs off the bed and offers his body to Harry for support, shouldering his weight with no complaint. Standing helps, and so do Draco’s hands squeezing his hips together and their bodies swaying slowly back and forth.
Harry nods and is suddenly even more grateful for the good, hard shag they had in the shower that morning. “What about orgasm?”
Harry feels himself sway as the world inverts and an arm is immediately tight around his waist. He finds himself leaning on James’ shoulder.
“That’s the point,” Harry chuckles. He feels his throat catch just a little as Draco reaches over and runs a hand down his body to his cock. He’s still achingly hard but he certainly doesn’t want Draco to feel like he has to reciprocate.
“Yeah. It just feels like something hard is sitting in there right now. It’s right—“ Harry takes Draco’s hand and places it over the spot. “—there.”
Harry’s mind tries assiduously to make sense of what Malfoy is saying. “That sounds like a business transaction,” is what finally exits his mouth, the tone somewhere between a statement and a question.
“No, It’s not that,” Draco says quickly. “I do. Very much. I guess I imagined being a lot more apprehensive for the ‘let’s move in together’ conversation. And I didn’t picture it happening at the kitchen sink.”
“You look fantastic, Harry. Malfoy’s not going to know what hit him.” She looks every inch a proud mother hen as she nods approvingly. She glances briefly down. “And it’s now 5 till, so go grab your things. He’ll be there to pick you up any minute.”
Matthew pulls his hand from Harry’s belly and wraps James in his arms. Harry can’t hear the young man’s words, but he can hear James’ whispered reply.
“Harry…Harry…Harry…” Draco’s voice is filled with lust as Harry’s name falls repeatedly from his lips.
“We’ll figure it all out. And as much as we like you and James as a pair, this also isn’t tied to your relationship.” Draco looks from Matthew to James and back to Matthew again. “We don’t see it happening, but if you were to split up, our support of you continues. Your value isn’t tied to you as James’ boyfriend. It’s tied to you as a person.”
“Isn’t that the truth!” Hermione lifts one outfit and sets it to the side. “If you’re not wearing your glasses, what would you think about one of these?”
“That makes sense.” Draco still sounds a bit hesitant. “That’s never been something I’ve had to worry about. With Astoria there was…no sexual attraction. It was something I had to do. And my other partners were…at the risk of sounding vulgar, just a shag.”
“You’re welcome.” Harry grins back. “We better get back up to the house. Dinner should be about ready.”
James cracks a smile. “I do think that serious partner might be Matthew, Dad. We’ve been friends since first year and things have been great between us since he decided to come out at school.”
not enough to match the sensations in his dream. He hesitates, wondering if he should be embarrassed at what he’s thinking about doing, even though he’s alone in his house in the privacy of his own bedroom.
“Yeah,” Harry agrees, “I was wanting to talk to you about that. I think we might need to find Al a Mind Healer. His anxiety is getting worse, and I think we’re at the point where he may need a potion. It’s not fair for him to be that upset all the time.”
, too.” She buries her face in his chest for a moment and then pulls back, taking both of Harry’s hands.
Draco immediately wraps his arms around him as they land, rubbing his back until the world rights. He steps back and Draco looks him over carefully.
By the time New Year’s Eve rolls around, Harry is beginning to wonder how he ever survived raising three kids on his own. He is completely exhausted from constantly being on the go. The Prophet had, of course, put a picture of Draco and Harry in The Dragon’s Eye on the front page the day after their first trip out, and the media drama has been non-stop ever since. Draco has strengthened the wards on the house to keep out owls from anyone they don’t know, because the quantity of Howlers has been completely ridiculous.
Harry is quite relieved to know this. He has always encouraged his kids to have an open dialogue with their partners in a relationship, but he knows kids don’t always listen. Plus, it’s not the easiest conversation to initiate as an adult. It’s probably mortifying as a teen.
Each person’s work is largely independent, which Harry appreciates because he really prefers to work on his own. The Dark Magic experts do, however, frequently ask one another to offer an opinion before lifting away what they think to be a benign spell. Pulling the wrong layer away from the magical imaging often results in having to reset the entire process and start over. So when Claire, the tall blonde French woman whose lab station is next to his, asks him to take a look at a tangle of spells before she lifts it, Harry thinks nothing of it.
They stand, spent, still entwined under the shower for long minutes. Harry makes an effort to memorise this feeling — Draco inside him, wrapped in strong arms, both of them radiating love and contentment.
Harry feels like he’s been punched in the gut. He knew James was going to be having sex soon enough, but knowing it might be happening and having confirmation are two entirely different things. Taking a deep breath, he forces himself to focus on the matter at hand, which is not the sex, but the aftermath. Draco seems to notice his struggle and helpfully takes the lead.
“I just wish people would mind their own business,” Harry shrugs. “Want to help me pick out something to wear that puts this one on display, then? Might as well leave no room for doubt.”
“Then Draco and I will support you and your partner through making some difficult decisions.” Harry knows he will always support their kids, all five of them, but thinking about James getting pregnant makes his gut twist. “But I would really rather not end up there.”
In that moment, Harry is sure he’ll never find something as much of a turn on as Draco’s heated gaze and his gentle prompting for consent.
“Did…anyone understand that?” He takes in the shaking heads around the table. “Ok, good. Not just me.”
Harry groans loudly and puts his head in his hands again. “I don’t remember how to do this. How do you do this as an actual adult?! How do
“I love the four of you.” Harry is trying desperately not to get choked up. “All right, go! We’ll see you at Easter!”
Harry is certain his grin matches Draco’s. “We’re going to have a baby.” He leans in and kisses Draco softly. “We should probably see what Healer Carr has to say and find out more about what we need to do now.”
Harry feels his cheeks take on just a hint of heat at the open inspection he’s being given. “It hit me harder than I thought it would. I’ve never been without at least one of the kids — not since Ginny died.” Harry sips his tea and sighs softly. “I’ve never even left them overnight with anyone. I just couldn’t. Even when James and Al had gone to Hogwarts, I still had Lily. I even did all their tutoring and schooling myself.”
“That’s probably for the best. It might also help Al. He’s not going to be content until he sees you, especially since you’ve been in the hospital.”
“I’m excited, too. I know we didn’t plan this, and we hadn’t planned on starting parenthood over again at 40, but I wouldn’t change it for anything.”
“Of course. Do you want to come through?” Draco gestures to his sitting room, “I’ll need to make myself presentable, but I can be ready to go in about twenty minutes.”
“Tell me about what you like?” Harry asks, cuddling closer to Draco and feeling Draco hold him just a little bit tighter.
Hermione’s eyes widen and her mouth drops open. This is one of only a handful of times in nearly thirty years that Harry has seen the brilliant witch absolutely speechless.
He’s just drying off from his shower when Edgar returns, parchment tied to his leg. Harry tucks his towel around his waist and collects the parchment, sending Edgar off to the perch.
“We do.” Draco’s voice is full of pride as Healer Carr turns to him. “He’s incredibly bright. What he’s not telling you is that he’s considering Healer Training after Hogwarts, so he’s also very interested in the subject matter.” The more Draco has worked with James this summer, the more he’s encouraged James to study Healing and specialise in Mind Healing if that’s what he wants to do. Draco is convinced James’ only academic issue is a lack of confidence in himself.
“Are you going to tell her that?” Harry cuddles closer to Draco. He doesn’t doubt Draco or his commitment, but it is always nice to hear it affirmed out loud.
He doesn’t open them again until he hears the doorknob turn. He pushes himself up to sitting as all four kids are ushered in in front of Draco.
Harry guides Draco to the bed and turns down the duvet and sheets. They slide in from either side and meet in the middle, immediately becoming a tangle of tongues and arms and legs. Draco moans softly into Harry’s mouth and Harry is lost to the kiss. The only thing he’s aware of is Draco’s skin against his and the hardness of Draco’s erection when it brushes against his hip.
“Well, yeah.” Harry feels his face heat. “I’m rather hoping you’d like to come fly sometime, if that’s all right?.”
One fingertip slides in and Harry's mind goes back to the recollection of Draco's slender digit nudging inside him in his dream. Harry moves his finger in sync with his imagined lover's, pulling back out just to move in deeper again.
“Like…I grew up without my parents, so maybe making life better for orphaned children. My kids don’t have their mother so maybe doing something to benefit single or widowed parents. Harry pauses and thinks. It’s so hard to remember sometimes, what used to make him,
“We also need to get a couple of things sorted out.” Matthew’s attention turns to Draco as he speaks. “Do you have a Gringotts vault?”
“Caffeinate.” Harry gently steers Draco towards the kitchen table and gathers their breakfast plates.
“Nice and clear.” Healer Powell’s voice penetrates the fog of pain. Someone must have vanished the fluid because the bed beneath him is suddenly dry again.
“Of course.” Draco kisses his forehead softly. “I’m going to go get the kids ready and we’ll all come in before we go, okay?”
“There’s plenty.” Harry studies Draco’s face. Hermione hasn’t come over since Draco officially moved in. She knows, of course, and is supportive, but she’s not actually been to the house. “Would you be ok with her joining us?”
James leans into Matthew who grins at him. Harry knows they’re young, but the more he’s been around the young couple this summer, the more he’s beginning to think they may be one of those rare couples who are Hogwarts’ sweethearts and go on to spend a happy life together. He hopes, fervently, they can be as happy as he is with Draco.
“Everything preliminary looks good. Shall we do some imaging, then?” Healer Carr spreads the imaging potion over Harry’s belly and conjures her bubble. As soon as her wand touches his abdomen, there’s a tiny, wiggly baby visible.
The public knew Ginny had died two days after Lily was born from a sudden postpartum haemorrhage of the magical core. The press coverage had been plenteous and invasive as Harry and the Weasleys had navigated her funeral and burial. But the public remained entirely ignorant of what had transpired after the rest of the world moved on, leaving Harry with three children under five and the Weasleys reeling from the death of another child.
He eyes the picture critically. They’d ended up in robes for dinner when Harry discovered that none of his nice trousers would button comfortably anymore. Draco looks fabulous in his deep plum robes, but he’s more worried about his own midsection.
Harry enters to find his son unpacking clothes. He looks more relaxed, and Harry hopes the impression he’s receiving is accurate. He perches on the edge of the bed and watches Al continue to move around his room.
Harry stands from the oven and slides the door shut again just in time to see a weary Woody swooping to the perch. Draco hands him James’ letter and he opens it.
“Thank you,” Harry says, once he’s got his feet beneath him. He laces his fingers with Draco’s. “Lead the way.”
“My trunk is shrunk and lightened and inside James’ trunk. He’ll be along in a minute.” Lily’s eyes sparkle with a look that Harry knows means she has a secret. “I think he and Matthew are saying goodbye in the compartment so it doesn’t get photographed.”
“That’s quite normal during pregnancy, Al.” Harry tries to sound as reassuring as possible. “Exhaustion and vomiting are pretty much par for the course for the first 15 weeks or so, especially in male pregnancy. I’ve had a good deal of both.”
Scorpius and Al shuffle over beside her, each taking a turn and receiving their own swift kicks and grinning in response.
“I just wasn’t sure if you returned the affection, or if you were even ready for that kind of relationship right now.” Draco seems hesitant again. “I didn’t want to be pushy.”
Is that shock or surprise in Draco’s voice? It’s so much harder to tell without seeing his face. At least it doesn’t sound like he’s upset or put off by it.
Harry obligingly lifts one leg and sighs. He’s still not really comfortable with even his Healer being this up close and personal with his anatomy. That’s not avoidable, seeing as how he will be birthing a child in roughly twenty-three weeks, and he knows this. But he doesn’t have to like it.
“Congratulations to you both! Healer Carr sent her notes, but if we can get your husband into the bed, we’ll check him over and see where we are.”
“Salazar, yes. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever been better.” Draco kisses him again and then slowly pulls his cock from Harry’s arse and lays down beside him. Harry hisses and he knows his face screws up with pain.
Harry’s skin lights on fire as Draco eases him onto his back and trails a hand down his chest and to the front of his pants. Draco dips a finger into the waistband and looks into Harry’s eyes.
“To be fair, love,” Draco says gently, “you're more powerful than the average wizard, and you haven’t done anything magically taxing.”
Harry feels Draco shrug behind him and his heart aches at Draco’s willingness to give up his chance at a loving relationship, to just accept never being able to have that in favour of doing what was necessary for him.
“You probably won’t, Mr Potter.” Harry shifts his attention to the Healer. He can’t be a day under seventy. “I’m Healer Powell. I’m a male obstetrics specialist with the Male Pregnancy Clinic.”
“What do we need to do from here, Healer?” Draco asks. “Obviously, neither of us has any idea what’s involved with a male pregnancy.”
“We know you’ll probably keep sharing a bed with James — we’re not delusional — but we also want you to have your own space if you need to get away or be alone.”
“Someplace upscale, then.” Draco sighs contemptuously. “You’d think wealthy people have more to do than gossip, but they can never get enough of it.”
“I know.” Harry shakes his head. At thirty-five weeks pregnant, no one is more aware than him of how much longer he has to go.
Harry pulls out a loaf of Italian bread and lays it on the counter. If he’s going to have potentially eventually romantic company for dinner, he’d better dress it up a bit; at least with some salad and bread. Turning back to the cutting board, Harry forces himself to focus on the task at hand.
“You likely laboured through a lot of the night, so I would say probably so. For wizards, it usually tends to be slow at the beginning, then much quicker towards the end.” She stands and gathers her bag. “I’ll be back in an hour or so.”
Harry suddenly feels Regulus shift and for a moment it feels as if that little body might burst out his spine. The pressure against his pelvis screams to new levels and suddenly he feels like his hips are being wedged forcibly apart.
“Harry, do you freely give your love to Draco, to be bonded to him in body, magic, and soul for the rest of eternity?
Of course, I don’t care.” Hermione rolls her eyes emphatically. “Would you stop beating around the proverbial bush and spit it out?”
“Hopefully not overly so.” Harry is hoping the news goes over well with the kids. Press be damned; nothing ever goes over well with them. “How is your daughter getting by at Hogwarts?”
“Do you want to go back?” Draco’s tone is carefully controlled, and Harry knows that means he’s not happy about the prospect.
They pour over Hermione’s neatly catalogued hairs and photographs and make an effort to choose something as close to their own body type and looks as possible, as Draco wants to feel like he’s with Harry and not a stranger. Draco chooses a man with his build, but darker blonde hair and light blue eyes instead of grey. Harry chooses a dark-complected man slightly taller than himself, with green eyes but no glasses and of course, no scar. Harry adds each hair to a phial of Polyjuice and hands one to Draco.
The young man seated at the side of the table looks lost and scared, and Harry hates that Matthew feels this uncertain.
“I am.” Draco strides quickly to Harry and gives him a quick kiss. “I’m sorry I’m late. We’re working on that stabilising potion for your study so we can get it to the Curse-Breakers this week and I had a breakthrough.”
“No Potter males have a recorded history of being carriers. My aunt and uncle never had me tested, but our family Healer told me it was highly unlikely that I could carry.”
Draco pulls Harry close, kisses his forehead, and wraps him in a tight embrace. “I don’t have any expectations, Harry. If we do nothing more than sleep next to each other, that’s more than adequate. I just want to be
“These rings are an outward symbol of the love between you. Like the magic that binds your souls, these rings have no beginning and no end.”
“Oh, Harry!” Draco gasps and Harry wrenches his gaze from the baby to look at Draco, who’s not even trying to hide the tears in his eyes.
“It’s not a her,” Harry confesses, averting his eyes for just a moment before looking back at his best friend.
Harry turns to Draco with a quick smile. “I do now. I didn’t, growing up.” Harry slides chicken into the skillet and moves back to work on the sauce. “The Dursleys — my aunt and her family — made me do all the cooking from the time I was tall enough to reach the hob. I hated it then, but after the war, after spending that last year never having more than heated tins of food or scraps of bread, I started to find it relaxing. Comforting, even.”
Healer Carr nods, exposing Harry’s abdomen and casting over him, quill moving furiously over her parchment. “It’s about time for that, so it probably was. It won’t be too long before Mr Malfoy can feel it, as well.”
“I was rather hoping you’d let me,” Harry says huskily. Draco’s eyes widen and then a slow, easy grin spreads on his face. Harry’s brain nearly short-circuits just thinking about all the things he would like to do to Draco, laid out on his kitchen table. But more than anything, he wants Draco on that table, arse in the air.
After hugging both men, Hermione settles on the couch and looks at them both expectantly. Draco balances on the arm of Harry’s recliner, lacing their fingers together.
“Sometimes it just doesn’t feel right.” Hermione is trying to keep her voice matter-of-fact, but Harry hears the underlying pang of sadness. Harry’s heart aches for the woman who’s like a sister to him.
He puts his hands over his face and sighs. He’s never kept anything from Hermione and he’s not going to start now. He drops his hands.
“I’m going to be fine, love. Can you go get Martin and Warren from the Curse-Breaking team next to my lab? And my blue notebook from my lab station. And some of your binding potion.”
“I know.” Harry’s whole body is flooding with warmth at the thought. He’s absolutely terrified and this was not in their plans, but he’s daring to hope that this baby is part of their
“That I can understand.” Hermione delivers a Draco-worthy smirk. “You never were one to let the chance for action go by.”
He lets his mind wander to what he can remember of the dream he’d suddenly been pulled from. He and Draco, in bed, naked and sweaty. Draco’s hand wrapped around him. Draco’s fingers…
Head still in his hands, Harry takes a deep breath and lets it out. He looks up at Hermione and smiles wryly. “There was a lot of hand-brushing in the popcorn bowl. By the end, we were on opposite ends of the couch but our feet were touching in the middle.”
“That’s true.” Draco grips Harry’s hips and turns him so they’re face to face, leaning in for a kiss. Harry lets his eyes drift shut and enjoys the butterflies he still gets, even now, when Draco’s lips touch his.
“If I am still this miserable later today, we can see what Healer Carr thinks. I don’t want to push Regulus before he’s ready, but I’m just
And then Matthew is between them and they’re hugging him from either side. Harry looks at James, who is crying silently at the end of the bed but smiling through his tears.
“Okay, so the spells that are running are checking your dad’s blood pressure and heart rate, the baby’s heart rate, and both of their stress levels.” She points out each spell and notates the results on her parchment. “Everything here looks well, and I’m pleased that your blood pressure is still down. The stress on your body remains lower, Mr Potter, so that’s also good.”
“Thank fuck.” Draco’s lips are back on Harry’s as he slides slowly out until his head pulls against Harry’s rim, then thrusts gently back in, setting a slow, deep rhythm. Harry’s nerves are ablaze with pleasure as each press in gets easier. Draco shifts as he begins to move faster and Harry yelps.
Wands working diligently, old furniture is shrunk and put into a guest room, painting charms are set loose on the walls, and the new furniture is resized and put into place. Draco carefully uses sticking charms to hang their new decor, and Harry fits their new sheets and duvet to the bed.
“That helps; you holding me. But something’s different now that he’s shifted. I don’t know what happened. It’s just so much pressure.”
“Everyone clear?” Draco asks. The kids all nod. The Potter kids are used to this, and Harry supposes Matthew probably is after he and James went public. A picture of the pair sharing a chaste kiss had appeared in the Prophet the morning after their Hogsmeade date.
Draco turns from grinning at his locker to grin at Harry. “Yeah, for quite some time. I supported the Tornadoes in school, though. Thank you. This is fabulous.”
Gathering the letters, Harry heads for his study to pen replies to all three of his children. Lily needs her quills, James needs some relationship advice, and Al needs some reassurance. They may not be at home, but at least he knows his children still need him, even if it’s just in letter form.
James and Harry reach out and touch the length of rope, Draco touches the activation point, and they are all deposited in the living room of Potter Cottage.
Once Scorpius’ furniture has been chosen, shrunken, and packed, they do exactly that. Harry thanks Bernice again and steels himself, taking Draco’s hand and leading him out the door.
Healer Carr eases the blanket down and his shirt up to expose Harry’s abdomen down to his hip bones. “There are more potential complications with male pregnancies, so we need to make sure several things are in order for it to be a viable and safe pregnancy.”
“Part of me can’t believe we’re sitting here doing this — the rest of me feels like we should have been doing this all along.” Draco shakes his head just a little.
“It can only mean one thing.” Draco tugs on his trousers and looks at Harry. His face is some strange combination of sad, resigned, and angry. It’s a strange look on him, and Harry doesn’t know how to help. “The gossip has reached France and she knows about us — and possibly Regulus. I’m sure she’s going to tell me what a disappointment I am. Again.”
Hermione sighs. “Just say it, Harry. We’ll figure it out from there.” She smiles softly. “And honestly, you
“That’s what I don’t know,” Harry says, wincing when he’s unable to hide the weariness in his voice. “I wish I knew. It’s all I’ve thought about since last night and—
“Would you like to go out tonight and let ourselves be spotted? I honestly thought we’d be spotted on the platform taking the kids back, and if I’m about to go back to work, I’m certainly not hiding our engagement.”
Draco takes Harry at his word and slides the dildo almost all the way out before thrusting it back in, hard and quick, over and over again. Harry rocks his hips back to meet each press. He’s close. So fucking close. He frees one arm and reaches for his cock while Draco continues to slam the toy into him and he pulls once, twice, three times before he comes, shouting Draco’s name and shaking with his release.
“I’ve chosen a film, but I seem to be lacking company and wine.” Draco’s grey eyes shift from teasing to concerned as he takes in Harry’s expression. “Are you all right, Harry?”
Draco helps him to the loo and then steps into the warm water, waiting until Harry is ready to get in. Harry grips his hands and steps over the edge of the tub, and they settle together, Harry leaning heavily on Draco’s chest. The warmth of the water is immediately relieving.
Three days later, Harry is humming softly to the wireless as he finishes chopping onions at the kitchen counter. He scans the ingredients for his favourite chicken and pasta dish, laid out on the counter, and reaches for the garlic. Just as he’s peeling the first clove, a tapping sound draws his attention to the kitchen window. Opening it, Harry takes in the impressive-looking eagle owl.
“I can feel where my womb is. It feels like someone’s put a very heavy and hard ball in my abdomen. But I can’t feel any movement yet. Probably in the next month, though.” Harry smiles in anticipation of feeling their child move.
“Right this way.” Erwin moves behind the counter and shows them to a display of rings with a variety of gemstones and styles. Harry steadfastly ignores the photographers now pressed up against the glass window at the front of the store. This will certainly make the papers.
Harry finally turns himself around in Draco’s arms. Still laughing, he looks at Draco’s red face and sparkling eyes and worms his arm up between them, holding the fluttering Snitch tightly in his hand.
“Not upset, but I didn’t expect you to laugh at me!” Harry tries to appear affronted, but all he can feel is relief. He needs Hermione and he wants Draco, and he desperately doesn’t want to have to choose between the two.
“All right, Mr Potter. I have some questions.” Healer Carr eyes them both with a look Harry can’t quite interpret. Harry nods, seeing Draco do the same.
“Thank you, love.” Harry shoots Draco a grateful look and a smile before turning back to Hermione. “Come on through when you’re ready?”
Harry closes his eyes and sinks back onto his bed. He’s not nearly as sure that he will be okay as he let Draco think. He knows the problem is fixable, but he also knows it’s experimental. And it’s never been done on a pregnant man.
“Yeah.” Al’s voice is strained. Harry opens the door to find his son sitting cross-legged in the middle of the bed, eyes red and face streaked with tears.
Healer Carr nods and begins her usual casting. “I’ll explain as I go, then, James. And you can ask questions so long as your dad is okay with that.”
Draco hurries into the hallway and Harry suspects he’ll be back in less than ten minutes with far more resources than he asked for.
“In that case…” Draco eases Harry out of his arms and takes both his hands. Harry’s body shivers at the loss of warmth and contact.
“Oh…here it comes. I’m gonna be split into pieces.” Harry groans as he feels the tightening begin. Draco’s arms come around him, holding him close.
A few cleaning charms later, they’re under the sheets with Draco’s chest flush against Harry’s back, both drifting into a sated, satisfied sleep.
“Deep breath in and push, Harry!” A voice he doesn’t recognise is encouraging him, but he doesn’t care.
“He certainly didn’t feel tiny on the way out,” Harry quips at his daughter. “Come over here beside Draco, and you can hold your brother.”
“Did you plan this?” James is the first to find his voice. Judging by his expression, he’s not at all sure how to feel about this situation.
“Not in the least,” Harry shakes his head vehemently. “James is gay, you know. Got his first boyfriend over the summer, actually. And I’m not entirely straight myself, so it would be rather hypocritical of me to have an issue with it, wouldn’t you say?” Harry gives his own almost-shrug.
They stroll the furniture section hand in hand, and Harry can’t shake his deep sense of elation that he and Draco are taking steps to build a life
“Of course. She’s your best friend. Having her over for dinner is probably overdue.” Harry sees no hesitation or unease in Draco’s face. Draco squeezes Harry’s hip. “I’m going to go change out of my work clothes.”
Harry takes a deep breath and looks to Draco, making sure the other man has also finished reading the short note.
“I do. Kind of.” Harry pauses to gather his thoughts. “My work is important to me. And it’s literally what saved our baby’s life, and mine. It would have been impossible with the way I was feeling, but now I’m really only nauseous in the mornings.”
“Wonderful. You’ll need to lie flat and disrobe from the waist down. Would you like me to step out while you get comfortable?”
“It’s all right, Harry.” Draco strokes Harry slowly, bringing him to full hardness. “I know you’re tired. I’ll take care of both of us.”
“Let’s go, then.” Draco tugs Harry’s hand, helping him up from the couch. Once he’s on his feet, Draco affectionately holds his bump on both sides.
“James,” Draco sighs, “the only issue you have is your self-confidence. You do realise we have covered
“Give him a moment, James. The world will steady itself and he’ll be right as rain,” Draco says softly.
The addition was more than Harry had initially envisioned, but it would suit their family well. Downstairs, they’re adding a den for relaxing and entertaining — a combination of playroom and game room — another bathroom, a library, plus a new mudroom with extra storage. Upstairs, they had opted to add two more bathrooms and four more bedrooms, one of which will be set up as a “study” for the children for now, complete with a desk and workspace for each.
“Just notes, no actual names.” Harry hasn’t wanted to make any kind of naming decision without Draco’s input. It’s very important to him that this name be something both of them love.
“That’s all right.” Harry shifts to lie flat and lifts his hips, pressing his joggers and pants down his legs under the blankets before kicking them off.
They walk around the pitch, simply making laps, and pause when Healer Carr arrives for a check. Harry again feels ridiculous, with her reaching under his gown there in the outdoors, but he’s progressed and that’s what really matters.
Draco’s arms slide around his middle to hold the place where Regulus is growing. At eighteen weeks in a male pregnancy, there’s no way Harry looks anything but pregnant. His skinny frame has nowhere for a baby to go but out, and he can’t blame weight gain if the only place that’s bigger is his round belly.
Harry drops his head again and kisses softly along Draco’s hip bone, slowly moving towards the centre. He buries his nose in Draco’s curls, inhaling the musky scent of Draco’s arousal before lifting up to look at Draco again.
“That timeline will be between Draco and me, Lil. But I’m glad that you and James are supportive of our relationship.”
Harry’s heart feels like it’s in a vice. He certainly hadn’t intended to get pregnant, but now that he knows there’s a part of Draco growing inside him, he wants this baby. He’d be devastated if there was a problem. Draco squeezes his hand, and he nods to the healer.
“Of course.” Draco pads across the room and strong arms help Harry to sit upright. He reaches up and puts his arms around his husband’s neck and heaves himself to stand. Balance has become an issue in the last week or so as Regulus has gotten so much bigger and every bit of the weight is out in front.
“That’s fine, then.” Harry obligingly holds out his arm wincing as the Healer slides a needle in and fills three phials with blood. She pulls several small tubes from her bag and drops blood into each, casting spells and recording results.
“I think you’re right, Al.” There’s a pause and a noise. “Come on, let’s take these drinks into the living room. Lily and Scorpius are setting out the pizza and we can all eat in there.”
There’s a soft kiss on Harry’s lips, and Draco’s hands are washing Harry’s hair as well as his own, then washing Harry’s body and guiding him under the water for a rinse. Draco shuts off the water and reaches outside the shower before handing Harry a towel. Harry buries his face in the soft, plush material only to discover that Draco had apparently cast a warming charm over it before he got in the shower.
“Yes. Any penetration, including anal sex, is safe. Your body has a membrane between your womb and your rectum that keeps the baby protected and that membrane won’t dilate and open until you’re in labour.”
be getting his own room.” James pulls a face, and Harry shakes his head. “I know you’ll probably continue to share a bed. We just want him to have his own space if he needs some time to himself.”
“That’s good. I’ve felt better this week even without pain potion.” Harry is always relieved when the way he’s feeling matches the testing.
He hears Draco return, followed by the rustle of clothing and then bedsheets. Draco’s side of the bed dips, and Draco’s hand joins Harry’s.
“They told him he needed to leave, yes.” Harry is trying to be matter of fact, but it’s getting harder. This isn’t a cut and dry, easy-to-understand situation.
“We really don’t know yet. I spoke to them briefly when I went to get Matthew. They are quite upset and were very insistent that his ‘lifestyle choice’ wasn’t acceptable in their home.” Draco sighs. “After I told them that I was James’ dad’s fiancé, they didn’t seem too keen on me being there, either, so I went upstairs, packed Matthew’s things, and we came here. We’ll try talking to them again later, once they’ve had time to deal with their emotions.”
Draco snickers as they follow the hostess to their table. Every eye in the restaurant swivels to look as they walk by, and Harry internally rolls his eyes. People always openly gawk when he goes out with the children, but this is going to be worse than usual. He and Draco had decided beforehand that they weren’t going to behave any differently to appease the masses or the press. They’re in a happy, loving relationship and anyone who doesn’t like it doesn’t have to look.
“You have nothing to be sorry for,” Draco says firmly, “but I’d be very happy if I'd never have to see you that shade of white again.”
Harry nods, grasping Draco’s arm and stepping close. Draco’s hand covers his and with a pop, they’re gone.
“Yeah, pretty close.” Harry passes his trousers to Draco and pulls on some pants. Turning to the mirror, he runs his hands down his torso. He hadn’t expected to be struggling to fit into his clothes at just over nine weeks. He still has 29 more to go!
His womb appears in the bubble and his whole body goes limp as the last of his anxiety abates. There, bouncing around, is their baby. Tiny arms and legs are moving. Harry feels a bit ridiculous as tears fall, but when he pulls his eyes away from that beautiful image to look at Draco, he finds he’s not the only one crying.
Draco shifts and Harry feels Draco’s hard cock against his own. Draco wraps his hand around them both and begins stroking them together. Harry moans at the sensation of soap and cocks and hand all sliding together.
Harry shifts and pushes himself into wakefulness. “I’m sorry, love. I didn’t realise I was so tired.”
“Oh, James,” Harry sighs aloud. It’s hard to be fifteen sometimes. It’s probably even harder to be fifteen and openly gay, he supposes. Harry is thankful again for his open dialogue with his kids. He’d rather them talk to him than hide everything like he did when he was that age. Placing James’ letter on top of Lily’s, he unrolls Al’s scroll.
They sit in comfortable silence as they eat and enjoy the lights and the skyline and just being close. When Harry’s had his fill, he stretches out on the blanket, lying prone and pillowing his head on his arms, face towards Draco.
“Look. I’m part of a team studying the long-term effects of childhood Dark Magic exposure. One of our findings is spontaneous haemorrhage of the magical core when it’s under strain as an adult.” Harry watches Powell’s eyebrows raise into his hairline.
Hermione’s eyes go wide at the mention of a library and Harry can’t help but laugh. Hermione, for all the changing she’s done, is still her eleven-year-old self when it comes to books.
Al and Scorpius are clearly discussing Quidditch as there are cookies, salt and pepper shakers, and pieces of napkin between them being moved around as they speak quietly, but intensely. Scorpius’ face is so like Draco’s when he’s passionate about something. Albus, always his emotional and empathetic one, is clearly trying to keep himself from getting more worked up than a Quidditch conversation warrants.
Harry shivers as the cold potion is spread around, but he watches intently as the imaging bubble appears and the Healer begins to direct her wand across his stomach. Her brow is furrowed and Harry gets more nervous as the minutes pass. He doesn’t remember this taking so long with any of his previous kids.
Harry’s quiet lust-filled voice is the only sound in the room. He presses his arse back, welcoming the dildo’s stretch and the slight burn that accompanies it.
Harry lifts a hand and levitates the plates of curry to the table, Hermione following behind with extra rice and a basket of naan.
“I can understand that. And they were rather invasive,” Harry agrees. “At any rate, my bedroom before I went to Hogwarts was a cupboard under the stairs.”
Harry is standing, eyes closed, letting the steaming hot water course down his back when he hears the door to the bathroom open.
“That doesn’t mean they need to hear it.” Draco squeezes Harry's hips gently. “We need to go or we’ll be late.”
“I’m sorry?” Harry tries, desperately working to school his features into something that might pass for remorse.
Hermione appears in the living room just as Draco is withdrawing from the fire. He looks to Harry and nods, indicating that Minerva is, indeed, free for Saturday.
the tea.” He uses the offered hand to pull himself off the couch and wraps his arms around Draco’s middle, dropping his head onto the man’s shoulder. “I may have a nap after we’re done with this checkup.”
Draco is gently stroking his hair, whispering quietly in his ear. “I love you, Harry. I know this is a shock, but we’re having a baby. I can’t believe you’re carrying our child.” Harry focuses on Draco’s touch and his words and tries not to pay attention to what Healer Carr is doing.
“Tonight. They said I’m not—“ He dissolves into sobs again, and it takes several moments before he can form words. “— not welcome here.”
Harry shoots him a look and they both laugh. “Is there anything I can do for the pain and discomfort?”
“Fuck, Draco!” Harry can’t help but cry out as Draco takes him in. Being pregnant has made the pleasure of Draco’s touch multiply, and this has set his body on fire. He wordlessly reaches out and feels the phial of lube meet his hand. Pressing it into one of the hands gripping his hips, he feels Draco chuckle around his cock.
Draco places a knee on either side of Harry’s hips and leans forward, leaving a trail of kisses from behind his ear and down his throat. Firm hands stroke down over his soft t-shirt and dip under, sliding it up. Lips gently suck in the curve of his neck, and Harry jumps when Draco softly pinches and rolls his nipples beneath his shirt.
Harry gathers his wand, wallet, and mobile before dashing to the loo for a final check in the mirror. He can’t remember the last time he thought
“You’ve nothing to be sorry for. Do you want me to see if Hermione can come stay with you while I take the kids to King’s Cross?”
Harry slips his mobile back in his pocket as Draco strides purposefully back to him, a satisfied smile on his face.
Harry opens his eyes long enough to see one Mediwizard on each side of him and Healer Powell between his legs, then the twisting in his gut intensifies and he needs to push again.
“I guess we are.” Harry shrugs with a smirk. His face sobers as he looks at Draco. “Do you not want to stay?”
“Draco, do you freely give your love to Harry, to be bonded to him in body, magic, and soul for the rest of eternity?”
Harry looks at Malfoy’s face. His remorse is evident, but Harry can’t decide if he should disclose the situation with the Weasleys. He’d worked tirelessly to keep it out of the press in that year after Ginny had died. No one knew beyond himself, the Weasleys, and Hermione.
“Well, so far, it’s been a bit miserable.” Harry opts for brutal honesty. The physical part of this pregnancy has actually sucked. “I’ve been pretty sick, James. Lots of nausea and throwing up, and I’ve been really tired. But seeing the baby in the imaging bubble is amazing, and knowing that I’m having a baby with someone I love is very exciting.”
“You’re engaged!” She turns to hug Draco who looks positively stunned to be hugged by one Hermione Granger.
“Everything you asked for is in here, including the potions Draco just bottled. We’re going to spell it to require your magical signature so you can maintain your privacy.”
Harry isn’t sure this will get them very far. He’s been over his family tree, at least as much of it as he has, and he really hasn’t seen anything he’d want to name their son. He leans over Draco’s shoulder and points.
“That’s a personal decision. If you’re feeling well and not experiencing magic fatigue, there’s no reason you can’t. But male pregnancies carry a high miscarriage rate when you don’t listen to your body and rest enough. I would advise you to err on the side of caution and not work if you’re not feeling up to it. If you are feeling well, there’s no reason not to.”
Draco descends the stairs and wraps Harry in his arms. “We’re getting married, Harry. I still don’t know how I got to be so lucky. I’m so in love with you, I can’t even find words to describe it. We have five incredible kids. You’re carrying my son. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.”
Draco withdraws obligingly, for a moment leaving Harry achingly empty again. Harry whimpers at the loss, shivering as he feels the wide, blunt head of the dildo prodding at his entrance.
, which seemed like…an interesting choice. I made popcorn and we had more wine and—” Harry stops abruptly as his memory is jogged. “Oh! He wants to know if you’ll help him ward a telly for his flat.”
Coffee securely in hand, Draco and Harry stroll towards Currys, enjoying the warmth from the coffee and easy conversation. Harry can’t help but steal looks at his handsome company, and the shop appears in front of them more quickly than Harry would like. He leads Draco to a massive display of televisions. Draco studies them intently for a moment and then looks to Harry.
“You’re terrible.” Harry pauses. He hadn’t planned on stopping here today, but he also wouldn’t mind knowing what Draco likes. He does intend to marry him at some point, after all. “I wouldn’t mind looking at some rings with you, though. Driving the press a bit mad will be a bonus.”
“Excellent. I’ll open the Floo for you. I’ll be out as soon as I’m ready.” Draco flashes another smile and moves to stand up.
A bizarre look crosses Hermione’s face and Harry looks at her askance. She shakes her head almost imperceptibly and Harry narrows his eyebrows in return before raising them expectantly. Hermione huffs.
“I’m ready.” He walks slowly to the top of the stairs. Hermione gazes up at him, dressed in a cream summer dress with accents the same colour as his robes.
“No, we didn’t,” Harry confirms and waits for what feels like a lifetime before James speaks up again.
Harry hopes fervently that Draco feels the same way he does. They’ve been open so far about everything and they seem to be on the same page, but Harry is falling even harder than he had been aware of, and that’s just a little bit scary. The hand over Harry’s abdomen moves slightly and Harry watches sleepy grey eyes open.
James’ black hair, so much like his own, is wild from flying and he’s snuggled close with Matthew. They’re feeding each other bits of cookie and stealing quick kisses when they think no one is looking. Both boys’ faces radiate happiness.
and begins leafing through the pages. In an effort to combat the boredom from not working, he’s been searching for baby name ideas that are just right for this child that is a combination of the two of them. Something celestial would certainly honour Draco as a parent.
“It’s not the worst thing I’ve gone through.” Harry shrugs. “I’d rather like to think life owes me something spectacularly good for a while after an awful lot of crap.” Harry’s worked hard not to stay bitter about his life circumstances after Ginny’s death. A lot of time with his Mind-Healer means he’s been mostly successful, but he does still hold hope that there are good things in his future.
“No, I just didn’t realise how tight my muscles are.” Harry shifts slightly. “Go on. It feels good.”
“She’s flirting. I stood in the doorway and watched the whole thing. She’s interested in you. Romantically.” Draco runs both hands through his hair in exasperation. “I know you can be a bit slow on the uptake, but
Malfoy was decent enough when Harry had encountered him in the last several years. Harry’s middle son and Malfoy’s son are best friends and starting Third Year at Hogwarts together in Slytherin House. Albus had visited the Malfoys’ posh London flat and Scorpius had been to Potter Cottage dozens of times over the last two summers, but Harry and Malfoy have never interacted beyond coordinating visits and pick up times. They had certainly never gone out for tea together, even with the boys.
“Draco!” Harry is torn between amusement and horror as he studies the paper. The press has usually treated Draco fairly and on his own merits in the last few years, but when their relationship had first become public, there had been some less-than-kind headlines.
Just as Harry reaches for the doorknob to the storage room, he’s yanked back by his shirt and wrapped in strong arms. He wriggles and struggles half-heartedly to try and escape, laughing so hard he’s nearly crying. He feels Draco’s chest shaking as his laugh rolls through the room.
“He stays,” Draco sighs. “I can see if Mr Stargell has time this afternoon. We need to get some kind of guardianship document.”
“I’ve already talked to Dad about this because I wanted to make sure it was all right with him first, and I didn’t know what you two had been discussing, but this is something that I’ve been thinking about, and that I’ve wanted to talk to you both about for a while, and I’ve been putting it off, but now you’re getting married on Saturday so I can’t really wait any longer and—”
“In the photograph? No.” Draco runs his eyes down the length of Harry’s body, sitting up against the headboard. “Right now, yes.”
Draco helps him shift, sitting behind him as a support, and Harry lays against him, legs in the supports, splayed open. Healer Powell slides his hand in and it takes all Harry’s self-control not to kick the man in the face. Everything is already so tender, so sore, he has no idea how he will manage to push a baby out.
“I found this one most useful when I was looking for stars or constellations that would work for names. We’ll have to switch to the other if we look at planets and moons.”
“I’ll eat after Healer Carr leaves.” Harry makes a face. “If she does an internal exam, I don’t want to actually vomit.”
“Really?” Harry’s previous intrigue returns and he begins to think he might have found something promising to do, all thanks to Draco. “That sounds fascinating, actually.”
“I see,” Malfoy’s voice tapers as he lifts his teacup to his mouth. He obviously doesn’t see at all, but it’s clear he doesn’t want to pry.
“I know we’ve already had this discussion, but I’m going to say it again. I haven’t had sex in twelve years, Draco. It’s going to be like the first time for both of us all over again and I’m ok with that. But I want this because I want this with
Harry sips at his cocoa and then pushes it aside. Cookies and cocoa just don’t sound appealing at the moment, so he wraps his hands around the warm mug and studies his children instead.
“They better stay back. I will hex anyone that touches you.” Draco glowers through the window at the masses.
“Erwin, could you make note of these two rings for us so we have the information when we’re ready for it?”
“I am, Al. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a romantic partner. It’s nice to have someone to share my life with again.”
“Of course!” She stands and gestures to the Floo. “Please let me know if there’s anything I can do for the children. Or the two of you, for that matter. I am glad to see the two of you happy and doing well.”
Harry stretches out next to Draco in their bed. Dinner with Hermione had been wonderful and they’d all enjoyed good conversation. Harry is thankful that it seems his best friend and his partner are going to be able to navigate a successful friendship. He’s not willing to lose either of them.
“Thank you, Healer Carr. We just needed a moment to wrap our heads around the news.” Draco eases back around to sit next to Harry.
Silence is a strange look on his children, Harry decides as they shoulder their bags and head up the stairs. He turns to Draco and buries his head in the blond’s neck.
Draco chuckles. “I spent the entire time between our tea at the coffee shop and that night trying to sort out my feelings. But I knew the minute you opened the front door that I wanted to be much more than your friend.”
“Good, because Merlin knows you wouldn’t do it yourself.” Hermione gives Draco a commiserating look before looking back to Harry. “Was it anything serious?”
“Harry!” Draco’s voice is in his ear. “You have to push, love. Regulus needs his daddy to bring him fully into the world.”
All three men turn at the sound of a train whistle which seems to signal Harry’s heart to begin racing even faster than before. He’s quite ready to see his children. Even with Draco as a distraction, he has missed them terribly.
“Are we really having this conversation whilst doing the breakfast dishes?” He hands Harry a plate and shakes his head. Harry joins him in relieved laughter.
