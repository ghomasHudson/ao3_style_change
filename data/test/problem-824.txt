Irritated by the mysterious notion, Draco finally left. He decided to skip the second class of DADA and wait for the lunchbreak.
Shaking his head at him, Jason’s face was contracted in anger and disbelief.
“Yeah. Last year was… chaotic.” Malfoy at least had the audacity to look a bit ashamed. “But I do hope you try out for the team, it would be less fun without a real match. Besides, without you, Gryffindor doesn’t stand a chance.” He laughed in a carefree manner.
“Screw you guys, I’m trying it on.” He scoffed and went for the dressing room.
“Well, I’m sure they can wait until tomorrow morning.”
Oh god, by any indication of the heat on Severus face, he was, after who knew how many years; blushing. Glancing at the golden framed mirror and the right, he could see the tinted patches on his hollow cheeks. Quickly he handed the man the right amount of currency, grabbed the bag and left without another word. The hot air outside did nothing to spare his cheeks of the humiliating yet disgustingly warm feeling in his body from spreading.
“Sir, I swear I want to tell you, but I cannot.” Harry hurried to continue as Snape looked ready to yell at him again. “I really want to, sir! But Jason has his own reason and if I tell you why I know… I fear he will hate me. I know he will tell you at some point. Could you please just let it go for now?” He begged.
“What happens if I lose?”
“So listen, we haven’t really had a chance to talk about what happened with you and Draco.” Harry tried not to sound demanding. A darkened look crossed the veela’s face. He bent over and gently moved the snow aside looking for the ground.
The concerned eyes watching him for signs of distress, finally broke him down. Tears gathered in the corner of his eyes, blurring his sight. Draco seeing this awkwardly pulled him close and pushed him away from preening eyes of the students.  Leaning against the strong broad chest of his boyfriend, Harry confessed to everything. Aodhan, the days they had hidden him, the chaos this morning… everything.  Through it all, Harry didn’t look up but simply cried into his warm shoulder, silently thanking Draco for holding him. For a minute, he feared he might have fallen to the ground if the strong arms around him weren’t. When he had finished speaking, his mouth felt like a dessert. The sobs retreated and in the end, he gently sniffled, trying to keep any snot of his boyfriend’s shirt.
The student population had thinned out and slowly turned into groups of sixth or more walking together. The six Slytherins had stayed together walking alone and quickly, trying to escape the many loud children. Finally arriving at the carriages, Draco noticed something move in front of it. Looking beside it before entering, he saw damn Potter petting the empty air.
Lupin looked as if he had just slipped him poison. It took a while before the wolf had gathered himself enough to answer. After a deep breath, he whispered to his own feet.
Draco crossed his arms and clicked his tongue in a very provocatively manner. “Can’t see it.”
A roaming fire lit up the small livingroom where black and grey furniture took up space. Books were scattered all around the room. In the giant bookcases against the walls, on the black marble coffeetable and on every smaller surface.
“Got you.” Jason practically purred as the dark-skinned teen started laughing, shocked.
“This! Now!” He said throwing his arms out exaggerating. “We are hiding in a broom closet. And- and what about you parents? My parents? I just… I don’t think it will be easy.” Harry Murmured.
“You seem a tad down today, Harry. Are you alright?”
Fearing his own answer, Draco nodded agreeing.
Snape made a dismissive noise and looked as annoyingly all-knowing as Dumbledore for a second. But apparently Harry got off the hook, as Snape changed the subject and asked him where he was heading now. Answering what felt like a rather leading question, Harry simply mentioned going back to the common room, and weirdly, Snape decided to accompany him.
Turning to watch the taller boy, he saw the conflicted look in his different colored eyes.
In this chapter we have moved along a few weeks. Last chapter Jason finally had enough of the tiny bit toxic relationship but veelas don’t always deal well with leving their mates…. Wonder how it will end?
Then he felt it. Slowly and steadily, Draco pushed the head against his hole. Tension returned as his body tried to keep the cock from entering.
“No, not now.” They didn’t need to know it was from Harry and not to him. He tucked the present away by laying it beside him on the bench. Hermione suddenly looked at her watch informing them of the time.
“So… how was summer?” Malfoy tried.
“What?” she barely whispered.
Harry started chuckling. “Wow, are you seriously acting this childish over a few inattentive weeks?”
‘Fine! If it will get him to stop talking.’ Expecting everlasting doses of sugar and simple bread, he took a small bite. He easily bit through the crunchy tier and chewed it thoroughly.
you are together?” she lifted an eyebrow.
“Do you think by any chance, I could buy you a whiskey sometime?”
Pansy looked madder than Draco had ever seen her before. “You have humiliated me in front of everyone who is someone in our circle! Not only does it look like you completely ditched me for a MAN! No, you left your house for the golden boy’s ass!” She sneered, her mouth crunched up as if she had eaten something disgusting.
Blaise soon pulled away to breathe and Jason wasted no time and continued to bite his ear and neck, hoping to leave a hickey behind. As the air grew heavy around them, Blaise gasped in pleasure as he bit him on the juncture.
“Merlin, save me.” Severus knocked back the rest of the glass at the thought of having his house filled with children whom he would never be able to avoid. Remus laughed again and finally had the audacity to pour himself a drink.
“I…” No, Harry had surely wondered but that’s how most people usually made a change. Small steps and different behaviour.
“Really? Erhm. Well I have been thinking it might not be such a good idea.”
But they did unfortunately worry his boyfriend. Harry had insisted on entering the training Healers program this summer and while his friends kept insisting any subpart healer school would accept him, Harry insisted to be accepted because of his talent, and not based on his status. Therefor Draco found himself without his boyfriend for many nights of the week. Although he was very understanding of Harry’s need to prove himself and gracefully accepted the many hurried apologises from his lover, Draco couldn’t control his desperately need for Harry’s body. It had taken him months to finally get Harry into his bed and they had only just had sex a few weeks ago. For Merlin sake! He was a healthy seventeen-year-old man.
The boy stopped smiling and gave him a darkened look. It was very rare to see such calm yet angry emotion flicking across the boy’s face, but it wouldn’t surprise if the boy possessed a few other of his traits, such as temper.
(See the end of the chapter for
For once, Harry decided to be impulsive and without thinking further, he opened his mouth just slightly enough for Malfoy’s finger to slide in. Without breaking eye contact, he gave the finger a few tiny lick before wrapping his tongue around the digit. As he began truly licking the sweet taste of Malfoy’s finger, he watched the silver eyes almost turn completely black with lust as his pupils dilated.
It was an early morning in the beginning of November when Harry realized he hadn’t been in contact with Remus for almost six months. Sitting at breakfast and watching the grey clouds drifting at the magical ceiling reminded him of Moony’s fur. While he knew the werewolf was grieving, he felt it was time to take action. He wanted to continue and improve his relationship with Remus. After all, Lupin and Professor Snape were the only two people in this world who truly had a connection to his parents. Losing them would mean losing another of the already tiny bit he had left of his parents.
“You spent a lot of time down there, don’t you?”
“Are you sure this is a good idea? We are better off staying to ourselves this year, Draco.”
Snape lifted a single hand to stop his questioning. The rest of the trip continued in complete silence.
This time, Lupin was the one to wave an indifferent hand at him.
The rest of the time was rather uneventful, and before Harry knew it, their last class was over. He fiddled with his school supplies as he packed his bag, looking for an excuse to remain the last person. Remus closed the door and asked him to accompany him to his private quarters. Inside the tiny cozy livingroom, Remus called for a pot of tea and some chocolate biscuits.
… It didn’t hurt… anyone…
“Come.” He invited him with a lifted hand.
Jason didn’t replay.
“True.” Harry agreed. “But it is usually the hardest choices that makes us the happiest.”
“Hermione,” Harry slowly felt the anger soothing inside him. “What did you tell her?”
“Say what?”
Giving him a rare smile, Blaise took his hand and soundlessly thanked him by stepping closer and leaning up to give him a peck on the lips. Jason felt the boy shivering slightly as he deepened the kiss. Not knowing wither it was from the kiss or the biting cold, he wrapped his arms around him and pressed them harder together. After -what to Jason felt like a too short time- Blaise pulled away but made up for it by lying his head on his shoulder and nuzzled closer under his chin.
Various types of agrees arose and Hermione suddenly seemed very interested in going. When asked why she was in such a rush, the strong headgirl replied; “I’m curious to see if they have gotten any new products we should be aware off.”
“Say; I told you so. You were right, I was wrong, and so on!” He snorted as more tears started gathering in his eyes.
Agreeing with him, didn’t really calm him down. Harry knew people like Draco could hold a grudge for god-knows-how-long. But refusing to overreact for the second time that day, he just gave a convincing smile to his friend and thanked him.
“Harry.” Remus sighed. “You know Professor Snape wouldn’t appreciate you meddling in his private affairs.”
“I will, wont I?” Draco smiled down at him.
“Apologies to Hermione.”
“Okay, I got it!” Harry intervened annoyed. “Yes, it is a little more ‘everything’ than I usually care for, but I want to get him something he would like. Do you have any ideas?”
suit their wishes. Draco would help Potter with his homework and therefor-spent time with him in the library, meanwhile the couple would spend any remaining time or every third day together alone before studying.
Harry almost walked right into Snape’s back at the staircase. As the staircase began to move, Snape took his sweet time to answer.
“Jason, I swear-“
He spit out the remaining toothpaste.
After only a few more times touching his prostate, Harry lost all self-control. With his other hand he grabbed his erection hard. He pulled harshly over the skin, pulling it back over his head and tortured himself by twisting it lightly. As both hands reached an incredibly speed, Harry found himself coming to the thought of Draco sucking his cock.
He could feel his erection getting pushed into his stomach as he moved back up.
No, it actually hadn’t occurred to him. He had been so obsessed with making Draco seem like a good person to his friends. A person whom had changed… the idea had never even struck him. No, okay so Draco might have spoken a little too loudly about their relation but it didn’t mean he had done it out of spite.
“It’s okay.” Harry smiled.  “Well, unpack it.”
But when the teen had confronted him in the library, Blaise realized how wrongly he had treated him. Blaise truly hadn’t meant it to hurt him. Honestly, it was just the way he was. But merlin, how much he regretted it now.
“Could you please take these three presents to Professor Lupin’s room?”
Knowing the cold air and the snow beneath them wouldn’t continue to be withstanding, he sucked the head and hollowed his cheeks.
“Well, Jason isn’t really like most of them, beside why does it even matter? He is nice and he even promised to help me with the History of Magic assignment.” Harry tried to reason with his redheaded friend.
“Did you ever
Somehow, Harry always felt slightly saddened whenever he saw a unicorn. Considering the first time he ever saw one, was as a witness to a horrible death of one being killed by Quirrell and Voldemort. Simply watching the creatures were so enticing, you could practically feel the magic radiating off them. Something so pure could only be killed by someone truly evil.
So now, Snape is on to Draco. He thinks something is going on between them or at least that Draco is planning something involving Harry. Let’s see if he figures out the truth. At the same time, Harry is rather confused. His emotions for Draco is getting very complicated in his own head.
“Damn.” Harry muttered.
He could already feel his blood pumping, hoping to achieve completion soon. The moment he felt the tight entrance slightly relax, he pushed his head against it.
“Lost track of time? You where there for almost ten hours!” Dean challenged.
Picking up the discarded rolled up paper, he checked his watch to see if he had the time to skim it. Five minutes.
How had he never seen it before?
“Enter.” The deep voice from inside sounded.
“No, it’s okay! It’ll be out soon.” Thankfully, it was one of the few times he had been right, and in the end only smoke and burned down wood remained. As they watched the small cabin turn to kindling, Harry stroked the dragon’s had soothingly.
“Charlie smuggled him out. As soon as he is big enough, we will find a home for him or her, of course.” Hagrid sighed. “It will only be temporary… But isn’t he gorgeous already?”
“Harry?” the bell-like voice whispered again.
“Harry, are you alright? It looked like one awful nightmare.” Dean asked worried.
“What the actual hell, Malfoy?!” Her tone reached a completely new level of high-pitched noise; in fact, Goyle had to scratch his ear afterwards.
“Wow. That… damn-“ Chuckling he fell to the side as to not completely crush his lover. Smiling broadly, he pulled the smaller boy against his own heaving chest and they simply stayed like that for minutes. Quickly and gently kissing each other around the face. Harry could only smile in pure bliss as Draco kissed his forehead and eyelids. While the heavy breathing was kind of soothing, Harry felt kind of cold as the sweat on their warm bodies were getting chilled. Draco quickly got halfway up and tucked the blanket out from underneath them, before lying back down.
HP POV
Looking up he almost laughed. Draco had pulled himself up into the window frame where he crouched. With the light coming in from the window and glass in each color decorating him, Draco looked like an elf. Laughing, he jumped up on the statue underneath as Draco lent him a hand. Pulling himself up, Harry kept smiling at him.
“What?”
It didn’t really seem to be in Hagrid’s favor but being the kind person he was, he obviously didn’t want to disagree with another teacher in front of the students. He didn’t say anything except wave Jason towards himself and Harry. As Harry stood in front of the class he discreetly sought out Malfoy, and by the looks of it, Pansy was digging her rather long nails into his arm to keep him quiet. Jason gave him a smirk and joined his side. Hagrid kept calling people forth, until everyone had been teamed up. The lecture continued for a while as Hagrid prepared them for the unicorns’ antics and how to approach the animal.
“Mother?!” Harry piped, his voice breaking.
Two hands grabbed his hair and he almost flinched from the tugging on his roots. Keeping up the pace, he sucked him off as he continued to circle the wrinkled hole. Familiarizing himself with each and every bump, he carefully inserted the finger.
Entering the silent hall, he searched between the large sections of books, only seeing few unimportant students, studying. No, he wasn’t here. Or at least not in this section. Turning towards the forbidden section, he imagined very well, one could seek solitude in between the screaming horrors.
“Oh, Harry you are staying here today, so do you think you could help me wrap them?”
“You know,
“Something you want, Potter?”
“You would think.” Seamus rolled his eyes as the rest laughed in sympathy.
Feeling as if he were monitoring a private moment, Harry coughed slightly. “Professor Snape, perhaps we should…” he left the suggestion unspoken and while it was obvious Snape would rather stay by his son’s side, he seemed equally uncomfortable watching his son’s ex-lover cry.
“I know, but I have to see Hagrid anyway.” He smiled and left the group of confused Gryffindors behind. At this time, they should all have been heading for Care of Magical Creatures but the bad weather – including the occasional thunder - had affected the plan of starting a big fire to study Fire Salamanders. Instead of feeling down because of the weather, Harry took advantage of the time to gather the last present that he needed for Christmas. Inside his schoolbag he had hidden a big vial and one of the metal cutters they used for difficult plants in Herbology.
Unfortunately, the spider seemed smart enough to realize his move and quickly moved its giant legs to the side. The second the spell had missed, it jump after him. Running behind the tree trunk, he once again tried the exploding charm, hoping it would hit something close to the giant creep. The spider, landing on the piece of wood, didn’t see the second charm fast enough and screeched with pain as one of the legs were blown to ashes.
Moaning, Harry grinded his ass up against his trapped cock, and Draco couldn’t wait any longer.
Professor Snape still didn’t seemed convinced but his shoulders slightly relaxed. Unless you knew him well, you wouldn’t have noticed at all, but thankfully Draco had known him since birth and Snape’s tense demeanor was always the same, for instance when his father asked him a favor.
The idea that he might wish to break up, punched a giant dark hole in his stomach. What if Draco had actually tried to break up with him, the other day? And Harry had been so caught up in them being more than friends that he hadn’t seen where the conversation was leading? God, now he felt even more awful than before.
“A coffee and a hot chocolate.”
Eventually, the food magically appeared and he, good mannered, took a smaller portion of steak and mixed a salad on his plate. Spending the rest of the evening talking to the other Slytherins in the commonroom, Draco went to bed exhausted from the long travel. Not long after the boys retreated to their beds. Blaise was having an after dinner drink, sipping some legally imported whiskey. Next to him, lying in bed in his silk pajamas was Draco, dreading tomorrow where he would officially have to start courting the Scarhead.
His face fell a bit and the smile completely disappeared.
“Harry, no matter how hard it has been for me to accept it, the wolf
Sitting down on his Draco’s bed, the shy Gryffindor took his hand. Draco watched him as he kept his eyes firmly attached to the floor.
It seemed so weird and incredibly uncomfortable to cry in front of another person. Especially his teacher. Yet… if he had to ask for help at any given point during this year – no matter how little he wished to do it – then perhaps it was time now. Trying to gather what courage and strength he had left, Harry finally said;
“Really?” Draco had almost backed him into the wall. “That’s too bad. I think I would have enjoyed it.”
in the laundry pile.
Everyone’s eyes were now at the boy in the chair, whom still refused to look up from the floor. Knowing he would have to say something, he visible swallowed hard before answering;
“So how come you wandered with Professor Snape at this hour if I may ask? I heard he isn’t very keen on Gryffindors, and –sorry to say it- you. Are you in trouble?” Jason raised his eyebrows twice in a mocking manner and smiled. Harry couldn’t help but chuckle. He liked Jason, he had a very warm present and almost an outreaching welcoming attitude, which were rather unusual for Slytherins.
“Draco!” the sound of books falling hit the floor but Draco didn’t give it a further thought. He had had enough of Harry walking out on him. He never thought he would hear himself say it but; he needed the golden boy and it was now!
Harry stared directly into Malfoy’s ice grey eyes. He had never been so close to him before. Seeing him as if for the first time, Harry realized that Malfoy had almost invisible freckles across his pale nose. Just a few, perhaps three or four, but they were there. His eyes, which were usually narrowed at Harry, were round and curious, although the constant arrogance was hard to miss.
Harry frowned at the three of them. "Just a Death Eater? Malfoy, you were with Voldemort! I spoke to your trial just because I didn't want you to spend the rest of your life there, don't think that makes us such good friends to allow you tp hug me. And why are you crying? Not even Hermione and Ron are crying. And what do you mean by hormones?"
Just then, an heartbreaking sob ringed thorough the room and someone hugged Harry tightly, leaving him even more confused. He wondered who would hug him. When they broke the hug, Draco Malfoy looked at him with tears in his eyes.
"Hey mate" Harry said "What's bringing you here? If Kingsley wants me on the field, you can tell him that-"
Draco omly smiled and kissed him. Then, he looked at his babies "Do you want to hold one of them?"
The brunette laughed and kissed Draco again and again, until the blonde had to push him away.
All my love,
But he didn't. Still, he gave Draco his book from the table "It's your free day. Relax. Actually, every day until after the birth is your free day. So just read and sleep and stay put".
"No, Draco! You're not a bad person! How could you even say that? You're carrying his child and you are doing everything around the house! You did nothing wrong! If anything, you have all my respect and you should have his too. He's so ungrateful, Draco. Maybe he is too dumb to realize that, but I promise he will. And when he'll remember everything, he will feel so guilty, that I'll laugh at him for months!"
"Your husband and baby are fine. Or, should I say...the twins are fine" Moore smiled to them.
Draco's eyes were filled with tears once again and he threw himself in Harry's arms, hitting him with his big stomach. Harry suppressed a pained groan, in order to avoid making Draco sad.
Harry smiled as he looked after him and he realised that he got a precious gift. A family. The family he never had. The Weasleys were like family, but it was not the same. He hurried back home, only to find Draco vacuuming the living room and holding his belly at the same time. He sighed and unplugged the vacuum cleaner, making Draco turn to him offended.
Narcissa and Lucius looked at him surprised, and then the woman burst into tears and threw herself into Harry's arms. Harry sighed and hugged her back.
Lucius looked at him with hate in his eyes, but Harry stopped them both "Oh God, this is just a big misunderstanding! I explained this to everyone! The divorce papers was a stupid contest at the office, that I regret! I lost that stupid contest anyway! And I didn't cheat on him! I got a letter and it was from Kingsley and I grinned because he let me work from home for a few months, so I could take care of Draco because I FUCKING LOVE HIM!!"
“Kiss me. It will help you with your depression”
"I will not hesitate to shove a broom handle in your mouth if you won't quiet down, Potter." Draco remarked, expression bored as he ran a hand teasingly up and down Harry's painfully hard dick. His eyes gave him away though, like they always did any time the pair snuck away for a few moments of passion. A subtle amusement lied in them, as well as a fondness that he couldn't bite back in the presence of the Boy Who Lived. There were days when Draco thought about dropping the act, admitting to Harry that he wanted something more out of whatever this thing between them was. That he wanted to hold hands down the hallway, listening to that ear sore of a girl Harry called a friend argued with Weasley about the important of homework, or whatever it was she talked about. To for once not shove Harry away when he went in for a final kiss before sneaking out of the closet, bathroom stall, section of forest they had hidden away to.
"If you're going to be a pain at least come over here and explain this spell to me," Harry caved, clearing up space on the bed beside him for Draco. Pleased, the other boy crawled up the bed, dropping down heavily at the brunet's side before glancing at the spellbook. Taking out his own wand Draco lazily waved it in the air.
"Education first, then I'll pamper you the entire night," Harry stated, pressing a firm kiss to Draco's forehead, which the blond pretended not to enjoy.
"Remind me that we're going to Hogsmeade tomorrow," Harry said, loosely entwining his fingers with Draco's. The boys skin was cold, enough so that Harry cheekily brought their hands to his mouth, blowing warm air on them. The action never failed to make Draco's lips twitch, cheeks blushing in a way that made Harry's heartbeat race.
"The entire purpose of you being here is to help me with my Transfiguration, Draco," Harry reminded, earning a hard eye roll from the Slytherin student.
"Surely this can wait until tomorrow," He tried again, casting bored grey eyes over to the other boy. Harry all but glared back at Malfoy, wand suspended in the air as he cut off whatever spell he was ready to attempt.
"Harder," Draco repeated and Harry let out a mirthless chuckle, lifting his head to stare the other boy down. With a final squeeze, he dragged his hand up the Slytherin's body until it reached the slope of his throat. Maintaining eye contact, Harry placed a light pressure, the touch imploring. At the smile which broke out on Draco's lips, followed by a curt nod, he tightened his hold and watched as Draco let out a choked moan. Picking up his pace, Harry slammed his hips against Draco's, lost in the pleasure that was his body, and growing desperate to come but unwilling to do so until Draco orgasmed first. Tilting his hips slightly, Harry slowed down long enough to seek out the spot inside Draco that made his back arch like a cat, eyes drifting shut as he panted Harry's name, voice wrecked with pleasure. Finding it, he released Draco's throat long enough to grip his weeping cock, stroking firmly as his own cock pounded against Draco's prostate relentlessly.
"So long as you actually promise to help me practice my spells once we regain the ability to stand up," Harry countered and Draco huffed.
"Harder." He grunted out when Harry had given up on teasing him, picking up a steady rhythm that had both of them breathing hard. Kissing was no longer an option, though their lips stayed pressed together more often than not, groans slipping through alongside each rapid intake of breath. A hand pawed at Draco's thigh, hiking his leg a little higher up as Harry grabbed his ass and moved his hips faster, squeezing the soft skin until the Slytherin whimpered at the dig of nails.
"Oh, Malfoy!" Ron hollered as Malfoy halted on the last step and stared at him unimpressed, the words turning more than just one head. Clearly, Draco thought, the boy had a death wish.
In an instant, Draco's hair shifted from its usual platinum blond to raven black, a change that had Harry bark out a surprised laugh.
With a firm hand to his chest, Draco rolled onto his back. His trousers hit the floor with a dull thud, hand pausing to palm over his hardening cock as Harry just watched, waiting for his cue to pounce on the blond. Draco didn't give it, instead he stretched, barely reaching the bedside drawer behind him and pulled it open. Lubrication was surprisingly hard to smuggle into Hogwarts, which was why Draco pulled free a bottle of massage oil he had claimed was due to his aching shoulders after the painful duel with Goyle last year, which had ended with him dislocating the right one. The bottle was mostly full and he placed it on the bed beside him before glancing up at Harry. The other boys expression was openly hungry, eyes swallowed by black pools that were surrounded by barely there rings of green. Draco stared into them a little while longer, reminding himself that no matter what Ginny had pulled earlier in the day, Harry was still his. Still here with him and no one else.
"I won't be able to live with myself if I don't do this," She said, voice growing more nervous as Harry's brows pinched together. He glanced down the hall, as though something around him could give him an idea as to what was happening. "Luna told me to follow my heart for once, so I guess I've got to try it, just this once."
"Afterglow is officially over, Potter. Time for you to go," He announced, curbing Harry's attempt to kiss him again. Guiding Harry's fondling hands back to his sides, Draco stood, grimacing at the come that slowly trickled down the back of his leg. Pulling open the bedside drawer he took out the box of tissues which lived there, gently wiping himself clean. He bit back a moan when his fingers brushed over his hole, knowing if he lingered on the spot he'd just end up agreeing to let Potter stay the night. Dumping the tissues in the small trash can beside his desk, he frowned when he didn't hear the sound of Harry's clothes rustling. Spinning on his heel, the blond scowled at the sight which greeted him. Potter, curled up under his sheets, fast asleep. Grumbling to himself, the blond slipped into the bed and steadfastly ignored the smile which tugged at his lips when Harry rolled over and pulled him into his chest.
Draco blinked up at the brunet, lips parted as choked moans escaped through every few breaths. The feeling was intoxicating. Harry, hot and hard inside him, fucking into him as though nothing else mattered in the world but the two of them being connected, driven by desire and need for one another. The shine in his wide green eyes that let him know that whatever Potter was feeling, it was purely for Draco. Emboldened, Draco shoved at Harry's chest until he was forced to pull out of him. Groaning internally at the loss he urged Harry onto his back, the brunet confused but willing to go with the action. Planting himself on top of the other boy, Draco threw his legs either side of Harry's hips and reached behind himself to line the tip of Harry's cock back against his entrance.
Pulling his own hands away, Draco wrestled to get his own underwear off. Harry lifted just enough for him to kick the fabric to the floor, doing the same with his own until they were joined together in nothing but blissfully hot skin. The brunet wasted no time in gripping Draco's hips, forcing the other boys legs further apart as he rolled himself against him, punched out groans filling the air at every thrust. Dragging a hand through his hair, Draco squeezed at Harry's shoulder, eyes nearly crossing in pleasure at feeling the other boy so hard and thick against himself. He let out a soft grunt, face hiding in the warmth between Harry's neck and shoulder. Laving his tongue along the skin, Draco nipped and pulled at the flesh, sucking welts into the hot flesh as Harry bucked against him, his cock twitching along his hip and leaking with every touch of Draco's warm mouth. All too soon he pushed Harry away, ignoring his confused expression in favor of turning over. Pressing his heated face against the bedspread, Draco raised his hips into the air in a clear sign of invitation. Not missing a beat, Harry scrambled for the bottle laid on the sheets and coated his fingers hastily.
Neither of them pulled any punches. Harry's tongue was questing, begging to get as deep into Draco's mouth as he could, to taste as much of the boy he loved as he could achieve. Draco moaned at the assault, going pliant under the attack and raking his nails across the rippling muscle of Harry's back. The skin was a more golden color than he'd ever seen it before, Potter having spent more time than not during the summer running around shirtless on the Quidditch field with Weasley and Thomas. He enjoyed the fruits of the suns labor, pushing his fingers deeper into the dip of Harry's lower back, nipping at his bottom lip as his hands plunged down the back of his underwear, revelling in the hot and bouncing flesh that greeted him. When Harry broke away, he pressed his forehead against Draco's, panting breaths laboured as he ground against the other boy, pleasant whimpers escaping bruised lips.
He went to work quickly, pulling out all the tricks he knew would bring Harry to the edge sooner rather than later. His hands dug into Harry's hipbones, leaving crescent dents that made the other boy shudder violently enough to knock his cock roughly against the back of Draco's throat. Thankfully, the blond had anticipated the action and swallowed, earning a scratching hand to the back of the neck desperately holding him in place. Breathing through his nose, letting out a rumbling moan every so often as Harry grinded against his face slowly, Draco reminded himself of all the reason he hated Harry Potter and why dating him would never be in the cards.
"Liar." the brunet said, shaking his head as he draped his body properly along the bound blond's form. The skin was hot, dangerously so, and Harry couldn't help but drag his tongue along the gentle sloop of Draco's neck before speaking again. "I should just throw you out into the hallway at this point, maybe then you'll learn your lesson."
Green eyes slid closed as Harry Potter rubbed at the bridge of his nose in annoyance, glasses lifting at the action. With deep breaths, he reminded himself for the third time that night that throwing Draco Malfoy out the window was not an option. It had taken over a year of nagging to get the boy to admit he liked Harry back, he couldn't just throw all that hard work away over one unpleasant evening.
"Knock it off Weasley!" Dean exclaimed through a tortured laugh, hands scrambling against his twitching side. At the entry of his friend, Ron lowered his wand, flashing Harry a toothy grin and relinquished Dean to his studies.
"What was that about?" Hermione asked, dropping the books into Ron's chest and pouting to herself as she corrected her robe after Draco's graceless exit.
"Say it again," He begged, hands sliding to grip Harry's neck before possessively drenching themselves in his hair and pulling until the taunt skin of his neck was exposed.
Well, the Slytherin had him there. Unconsciously, Harry grip tightened on Draco's hips as he imagined another person's eyes enjoying how beautiful he looked while restricted. He imagined invisible hands sliding along Draco's skin, making the boy moan and shudder and– No, Harry wouldn't have that.
"I can't feel my arms," Draco croaked after a few minutes upholding Harry's weight. The brunet chuckled, rolling over and wincing as cold wood greeted his furnace-like back.
"What happened to keeping quiet?" Harry quipped back just as he slid a second finger inside Draco and curled them both upwards. The blond moaned, head knocking back against the wood as his body arched, hungrily taking in more of the digits inside him.
Unthinking Draco sprung forward, clawing at Harry's shirt and slotting their mouths together in a firm kiss. Startled, Harry was sluggish to respond but when he did his hands grasped tightly at Draco's cheeks. Their breaths mingled and chests rose and fell in tandum with one another, Harry's tongue searching as it skimmed the roof of Draco's mouth. Breaking away Draco rested his forehead against Harry's, enjoying the warmth of skin for a brief moment before pulling back, face impassive as he corrected the collar of his shirt and smoothed the sleeves of his robe.
"No, that's disturbing. Change it back," Harry ordered, hand stifling further laughter as Draco ruffled his new locks.
"If I knew you were being serious about studying I wouldn't have agreed to come over," He muttered, smirking at the low flush that settled in the brunet's cheeks at the implying words. "Isn't this more your bushy-haired friend's domain? I'm sure she would love nothing more than to bark at you about incorrect pronunciation."
"Thrilled," Harry said, attention already directed back to the open book in front of him. "I might save practicing that one for another night. Ron had a mix up in class yesterday, gave himself a rather unflattering moustache that I don't want to risk imposing on myself."
Ginny smiled at the offer, shaking her head. Closing her eyes, she took a slow breath and Harry's face switched to one of confusion when her brown eyes landed on him in an awe filled expression.
Ron just snorted, shrugging his shoulders in feigned nonchalance as Hermione reclaimed her readings. "Beats me. I was just welcoming the guy to our group."
"What?" He barked back, uncomfortable under Harry's warming gaze. Draco was just fast enough to avoid Harry's kiss, but not enough so to push away the hands that grazed over the scarf, laying the ends flat against his chest.
"This is truly elementary stuff, Potter," the blond said and Harry ignored the barb as Draco muttered the spell. "Crinus Muto."
"I should listen to Luna more often." Ginny hummed, cheeks glowing as she backed away from Harry, all but sprinting down the hall, a peel of laughter following her.
"I'm not contesting that, Potter." Draco grumbled, ruffled by Harry's frantic movements enough he jolted when the boy suddenly filled his field of vision again.
Leaning forward, Harry trailed his lips gently along Draco's spine, mouthing at every bump that greeted him. His tongue flicked out against the warm skin, laving over areas at random until they glowed back to him bright reds and purples. Twisting his hands in his bedspread, Draco gnawed on his lips, wanting nothing more than to snap at Harry to pick up the pace, but at the same time desperate for his worshipping touch. When Harry finally reached the bottom of his spine, his hands gently kneaded Draco's cheeks, pulling them apart just enough to catch the winking hole between them.
"Say your mine," He said, grey eyes demanding and Harry swallowed hard under their scrutiny.
"Right. Head's a bit in the clouds today," He chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. "Any particular reason you called for me? I'm just about to meet the others in the common room if you'd like to tag along."
"Although, since you've made a right mess of your notes... Maybe we should both stop pretending that drilling me into the mattress isn't the only thought you have right now in that air chamber you call a head, Potter," the blond quipped and this time Harry was in full control of his body as he took hold of soft blond hair and pulled tautly.
Sat in the Gryffindor common room, the blond kept his face passive, but on the inside he was screaming with rage. How dare she. How dare that punny little girl touch Potter like that. Kiss his boyfriend as though he were air itself and she hadn't taken a breath in years. Only he had a right to do that, to feel such a way for the other boy. And yet Ginny Weasley had strolled up to Harry, planted one on him, as though she wasn't committing an act of Treason.
And let him not forget Harry choosing friendship with that dreadful girl and simple minded red-headed boy over him in the first year. Bruised egos never fade, which was what Draco told himself drove the reason he moaned when Harry whispered out his name in rapture as he came, nails piercing Draco's neck and making him shiver.
Unsure what Harry meant, Draco threw him a confused look before tender fingers reached out, tracing the curve his neck and winding to the back of his head.
"Kiss me." Draco said, intending the words to come out as a demand but they collapsed on themselves halfway out his mouth. They sounded yearning, a little too vulnerable for his taste, but he didn't dwell on it when Harry burrowed himself between his spread legs, hands cramming themselves into his hair with haste as his mouth reclaimed its rightful position against his own.
Harry leaned against the wall, trying to increase the distance.
Draco snorted, “Believe me when I say that you
“I thought you got the weekends.”
“Oh, I know.” Draco smirked. “It’s his name, though, and I’ll stick with it until he gets used to it, then I’ll find some other name that pisses him off. Maybe Wardo.”
“Please do. Do I need to worry about anything?”
He was also very relieved.
Harry watched Scorpius run around the room, finding new notes in toys and objects, all of them starting with an S. Draco would repeat the words with him, highlighting the first syllable, and then make Scorpius stick the notes back to some other thing that also started with an S.
“What’s the problem with it?”
“I really want to kiss you.” He murmured.
“Yeah,” She came to the counter, leaning over it to throw the empty packaging in the bin. Harry smiled when her feet left the ground, but was less amused when he remembered that he wasn’t much taller than her, and that in that position his feet would probably be hovering too. “I read this list with stupid enquirements this morning, and this one is bugging me.”
quiet. He didn’t have that in his life anymore. Everything was a snowball of yelling orders, spells missing his ear by an inch, older people thinking they knew better, paperwork you had to finish with someone breathing down your neck, fake smiles, office gossip - gods, did he hate office gossip -, and dealing with people that, to be quite sure, he couldn’t care less about.
“Never took you as a simplistic person, Ms Madley. Don’t ever let me plan your wedding.”
Scorpius nodded and was out of the bathroom at lightning bolt speed. Less than a minute later a man was standing by the door with the boy in his arms. Scorpius was hugging his neck and looking timidly from Harry to Neville from behind his little shoulder.
Harry was already missing him.
“But which home? This one is daddy’s home, but when you’re with Take where are you?”
“You could have asked me.”
“Oh, the dream. Please give me Harry back and I’ll take the Slytherin way.”
“There’s not much you can do, in the end. He’s growing up, it’s scaring as fuck, but it’s only natural. I read every single one of his letters at least fifty times, and pray I’m giving him the right guidance.”
“My question this morning was: what were you doing with a honeysuckle sapling when we got bonded?” Harry cut, trying to distract Draco from the teasing he knew was coming his way.  Draco didn’t get side-tracked as easily as Laura, he arched an eyebrow, clearly saying
He should say no.
“Yes! Yes, yes, yes!” Then he glanced at his father and added, “Please.”
“It’s a maidenhair fern, a glowing one!” Harry heard Laura say
Harry had laughed hysterically when Draco asked “are we
“Did I touch you when I gave him for you to hold?” They were sitting on the rug by the fireplace, surrounded by coloured pencils, children’s books and stuffed animals. Scorpius was fast asleep, his head on his father’s lap and his feet pressing against the side of Harry’s thigh.
Great.
He realised he was the second time he touched the man in a span of half an hour.
“Cool cousin. Right.” He shook his head, drinking from the image of a smiling Draco by the fire’s light. “I didn’t deal with it, though. Not in a good way. Teddy.” Draco frowned at him in a mute question. “I, huh. Well. Let’s just say I went a little crazy. Said goodbye to him at the station, pretended everything was fine, then visited all my friends at least twice that week. And cleaned the whole greenhouse. And my house. And Ron and Hermione’s house. The tenth time I showed up at Andy’s she kicked me out and told me to go home and have a cry, for Christ sake.”
“You’re so good at this! Let’s find another.”
Draco was an event planner, he had a wedding company with his ex-wife, and Harry always thought it was very funny that people would trust him to plan the best day of their lives. Not for his past, or anything like that, it was just that Draco was the most cynical person Harry had ever met. He was always making fun of his clients' decisions and ranting about traditional ceremonies to anyone who could hear him. Once he convinced a bride out of a wedding the day before the ceremony and Astoria had hit him in the head with the girl’s bouquet.
“I know you think they’re
“Yes, Lucian.”
“What did I never tell you?” Draco prompted from the corner, where he was sitting cross legged on a foam mat alphabet. Harry loved seeing him like that, unpreoccupied, with his hair undone, wearing his mismatched pyjamas.
What was that? What in their limited dialogue had triggered that reaction? Was Draco ashamed of their situation? Did he not want them to meet? Maybe keep his privacy?
“Guys.” Neville asked tiredly, and they went back to silence.
Harry nodded and they fell into silence. There were questions in the air he didn’t know he wanted to ask, and was too afraid to answer.
Harry looked down; pale fingers still in contact with the white petals, and when he looked back up Draco was still there, a touch away, with that damn side smile on his face.
Not even public transportation was an option, if the horrified look on Draco’s face meant anything.
Draco dropped his fork.
“Yes, it’s a Seal.
“Sharing is caring.” He told him before looking at Harry. “Good morning, Potter. Love the hair piece.”
“It’s not a bother.”
“Bye, boys. Keep me updated.” Astoria waved from the fireplace, and then they were gone.
“Sad.”
Harry taught him the names of at least ten flowers before Draco was back.
Their deal went down very quickly as soon as Scorpius was back.
Draco cast a Tempus, grabbed an orange pencil and wrote “FRIDAY, DECEMBER 11TH, 10:14PM” on the back of Babbitty Rabbitty.
He allowed himself a moment to be mortified, to feel his cheeks burning, to revisit that idea of drowning in the bathtub. But the moment he locked eyes with Draco again, the moment he saw how aghast he was, the bubble of laughter just emerged from his chest without asking permission.
She got up, still chewing the last piece of her lunch. They didn’t usually eat at the front, but it was a Wednesday, and Wednesdays were always a bit slow. On top of that, they had two big orders to finish until Friday, which meant sacrificing time from lunch, or staying after hours.
He averted his eyes when Draco said “hi” with a side smile, and busied himself doing a cup of tea while Laura wrote down his order for the next week.
He never intended to like the shop this much. It just… happened.
“It was a hard couple of days.” Harry guessed, understanding. Draco nodded.
“I can’t imagine staying away from him for too long.” Draco continued. “What will I do when he’s eleven? How are
They humoured Scorpius for a while, planning their evening until he’s a ball of pure energy, ready to start building a place for all his animals.
“Firing him, probably.”
“Yeah. I trust Take, he’s great with Scorpius, I know he’s in good hands. But it’s not the same.”
“What?”
“Please tell me you’re getting married on a beach. Please tell me Draco is organizing it.”
Hated it, hated it, hated it.
Everything happened fast.
“Sorry.” He frowned. “What’s going on?”
Harry looked from one to another, from Draco’s exasperated expression, to Take’s shit eating grin. There was a story in there, one that Harry was not sure he could read.
“Don’t you dare. We’ve come so far, there’s only a couple of hours left.”
Draco mumbled something into his knees and Harry tried to turn his face to look at him.
“Oh, I thought you were a dragon.”
“Can I?” He asked, and Draco pinched his nose playfully.
“Er… Yeah, sure.”
Harry snorted into his tea as Draco said, “I might surprise you.”
“Sorry.” He asked between laughs, trying to breathe. There were tears in the corner of his eyes and Scorpius was staring at him in wonder. Even Draco had lost his hard expression, he looked a moment away from joining him in his fit. The corner of his mouth was twitching.
“Say bye to daddy’s friend.” Take said to him, pointing in Harry’s direction. Harry waved, and a beaming Scorpius waved back with enthusiasm. So fucking cute. Take was also smiling at him, which made Harry a bit nervous, like he could see right through him. “Bye, Potter, sorry about, well, all this.”
“Oh, you so need not.” Draco intervened.
“Sure it is.” There was no malice in his voice, no irony. He was just affirming a fact. Harry said it was a wave, then it was a wave, simple like that. “I feel like I’m always in a hurry when we see each other, we need to sit down sometime, have a real conversation.”
“You know it’s yours, right?” He asked nervously, his hands still on the doorknob. “The job, I mean. If you want it.”
“You can have him in a week.” Draco replied, and he winked at Harry before going back to the living room.
“Do you like glasses?”
“It was unintentional. When I realized, I had already plucked them all.”
They both had lives they needed to go back to. They couldn’t travel apart by Floo or Apparition, and they couldn’t side-along because that would require touching, which meant they couldn’t go places they needed to go, because Draco’s house was in Beaconsfield, his office in Stratford and Harry’s flat was closer to Godric’s Hollow than London.
And when Draco opened his mouth to retort, Harry kissed him senseless.
Scorpius turned his big blue eyes to Harry, pleading written all over his face. Harry tried not to smile.
There was this ongoing joke he was compensating for the lack of love in his childhood.
“Thank you, Draco, I trust your judgement. Still want my good old veil, though.”
He wanted-
“Seriously, it’s only the first day, can you please refrain from touching me? Everytime it happens we have to start the counting over.”
“I’m a good researcher.”
Draco moved, sitting sideways in the bathtub, searching eye contact. Harry stalled, sure that he was pissed, that he was going to snap back at him, ask why he wanted to know, tell him it was not his business.
“You never told me,” Harry started saying on Sunday while entering the playroom. He paused when Scorpius looked at him with a neon green post-it stuck in his forehead. There was a S on it.
Draco shook his head and blessed him with a little smile. There was a white lily behind his ear, did Laura put it there or did he do it himself? Harry held his cup with both hands so he could refrain from stepping close and touching it.
, but
, how’s that safe?”
“Sorry, I destroyed a few roses.” Draco said and Harry looked at his hands. He had plucked away the petals of a small bouquet.
“I heard you got married.” She said grinning, kissing his cheeks. “Congratulations.”
Harry didn’t have a good enough counter argument, so he dropped it.
“I can’t fu-freaking believe it. You’re so blind.”
And start it over they did. Four times that day, until Harry started to police himself and keep his hands in his pockets.
“What?”
“What things?”
“That’s actually very clever. Did you come out with it?”
“Merlin.” Draco whined from where he was standing, a hand still on his biceps, right where Harry had given him a pat when they passed each other in the corridor. “Do I have to put measurements on the floor? Wear a crinoline?”
Harry hung up the phone, and he felt rage overwhelm him. He was angry at Hermione, for not figuring out, though she wasn't guilty at all, he was mad at Kingsley, for making him go on the field, he was mad at Ron, for trying to calm him down, he was mad at everyone but Draco.
"Hello to you too Malfoy. Your reaction is weird and I see you put on some weight since I've last seen you three years ago" Harry said, then he laughed, looking at Ron, whose face was yellow. "Mate, don't you find his reaction funny?"
Harry bit his lip to stop himself from grinning, then hid the letter. He looked at Draco, whose eyes were filled with sadness "Alright, so I thought I should stay home to take care of you and to help you around the house. This way, we can bond and I can keep an eye on you. Also, I'll take Jamie to kindergarten today and until I come back, you'll stay put, okay?"
"Hi baby, it's Papa. Tomorrow we will find out if you're a boy or a girl. I hope you're a girl" Harry said to the belly, kissing it "Don't be to aggressive, baby, and I won't make daddy sad. We need to keep him sane and happy".
"You heard me"
The pijamas fell from his hands and Draco held his belly. He sat down on a chair and took a deep breath. Harry came next to him a little nervous.
Good morning Draco!
Harry sighed and took two steps back "Draco, it's not how you think, I swear. It's just a big misunderstanding" he said, but Draco refused to believe a word.
Thinking it was just imagination, he went to his room, not knowing that James recorded him from the very beginning.
Entering the room at St. Mungo's, Harry felt nervous. He held Draco by his arm, too scared to let him walk on his own and fall. He let the blonde sit on the bed and lay down.
Draco paled "What did you say?".
"You know, you cried when Jamie was born too" Draco chuckled.
Harry smiled and kissed both her cheeks, then said that he wasn't upset at her. The Malfoys left, and Harry went to his office and started working. James was with Ginny for the night, Draco was asleep, so he didn't worry that somebody would bother him.
"Jesus" he said. "It smells like you in here. Mint and...something else. And stop looking at me like that!"
Ron sighed and took a photo album from Hermione's bag. He opened it at a photo from 2002. Harry and Draco were hugging on a bridge.
"And you didn't think this was something important that I need to know?! Honestly, Ronald! Now he thinks I'm just an evil Death Eater that wants to harm him!" Draco said, trying to stop crying.
Harry nodded and stood up, taking the girl from Draco's left arm. He looked at her small features and he started tearing up. She had his nose and his ears and Harry couldn't be happier. He sobbed and carefully holding his girl with one hand, he wiped his tears.
"They're fine. Draco has no idea about this...attack. Two aurors came to ask about you and Draco said you weren't there. It was the most subtle way, I promise. And then the two aurors reported directly to me that they were alright. So calm down" Ron said, and Harry drank all the water from the glass.
Harry smiled and kissed both her cheeks, then said that he wasn't upset at her. The Malfoys left, and Harry went to his office and started working. James was with Ginny for the night, Draco was asleep, so he didn't worry that somebody would bother him.
If he's cheating on you, I'll personally murder him. I don't know what to believe honestly, and I know you don't want to believe this either. And you can't convince me NOT to talk to him. He needs to realize his mistakes!
"A game and a letter. Nothing serious but even the smallest things can be turned into something bad. And I guess he believes I only see him as an useless fat ugly emotional ex Death Eater that is worth nothing, judging by the fact that he is insecure, domestic and sad, and trust me, I'm more afraid to hurt him than the baby" Harry said, laughing lightly "But I love the guy, Seamus. I really do. I don't know how I was and what I felt before I lost my memories, but one thing is for sure. He makes me happy".
Harry looked at the man in black and saw that he was watching them. He quickly looked at Ron and whispered back "It's just a big misunderstanding. The divorce papers are from that stupid game at the office. Remember I forgot them at home? I cheated. I took them from the internet, that's why they looked so real. And I would never cheat on him or anybody else. It was the letter from Kingsley. He told me that I could work from home, but I knew that if Draco found out, he would insist on me going to the office. And he needs my help! I heard him talking to Pansy. Mate, he's miserable. I want to help him because I think I lov-"
The next photo was taken in 2005, at what seemed their wedding. Harry and Draco were kissing, and everyone was standing and clapping, the priest smiling behind the couple.
Harry laughed "I love you too". And they kissed one more time, as the train dissapeared.
Suddenly, Kreacher, their former house elf, appeared between them, holding a camera. Harry looked at the house elf confused, then Kreacher played the video, turning on the volume. Harry recognized his own voice and James's gasps, meaning that the little boy recorded him.
"It's Draco! He- he went into labour but your magic transfusion from every night was not enough how I said, because there are two lifes inside of him, and the babies...the babies might not survive. I'm so sorry, Harry. It's all my fault. I'm so-"
It was Molly's turn to look down "I kinda told Narcissa and Lucius and they are both very mad and they said they will stop by" she said quietly.
Harry paled and started looking on the desk for Hermione's letter. He prayed that she would realize the divorce papers were fake, but then he remembered that Ron didn't tell Hermione about the contest, otherwise he would sleep in the garden for a week. Harry found Hermione's letter and anxiously read it.
"Just wanted to grab a drink, like mates!" Harry said loudly, then whispered to his best friend "I thought the protecting system would make you figure it out. Someone has been following us. Don't look now. The man in black at the bar. Act along."
Draco gasped and put a hand on his heart. Harry couldn't help but smile, as he took Draco's hand "Marry me again, Draco. I don't care when. Tonight. Tomorrow. In a week. Just marry me again. Will you?".
Hermione smiled brightly "They're fine. But you passed out one hour. Are YOU okay?".
"Hermione didn't tell me anything about your arrival. She said 'Give birth and then we'll talk about Harry'" Draco said, making Harry sigh.
"Mate, you lost your memories of Draco... I mean, you two are married. And while I still don't really understand your relationship, I know he loves you. And you will remember everything, I promise" Ron said, but Harry stared at Draco.
Cordially,
Then, the letter blew raspberry and it burned itself. Harry sighed and canceled the silencing spells, then went to Draco's room and entered slowly. He was in a deep, deep sleep, so Harry sat at his head and started stroking his hair and face. He watched his swollen belly and smiled.
Hermione rolled her eyes "You don't care anyway. About him or his condition I mean"
"Don't, you will not be able to get up until you deliver this baby" Harry said and, for the first time since Harry woke up, Draco laughed.
The next picture was taken at the Burrow, in 2004. Harry and Draco were both happily crying, as the Weasleys were cheering and smiling. Harry was slipping a golden ring on Draco's finger. Harry felt sick, because he couldn't remember that.
"I'm so sorry, Harry! I'm so stupid! I can't believe I assumed something like that! Please forgive me! I know I have no excuse for myself, but-" Draco's crying was interrupted by Harry's lips that crushed onto his.
Harry couldn't sleep all night. He hated himself for what he did to Draco. That was the moment he realised his mistake.
"You don't know how happy it makes me that you are in my life. Since I've lost my memories, I refused to accept that I'm in love with you, because I was scared to destroy your relationship with the other Harry. And to repress my feelings, I avoided you. But I shouldn't have done that. I now realize how important you are to me, to my evolution. And I've grown to love you. That's the truth. I do love you. Everything was just a big misunderstanding. The divorce papers were just part of a stupid contest at the office. Who made the most real divorce papers, would get 50 galleons from each person in the office. I cheated, that's why they looked real. I took them from the internet. The day of the contest, I forgot them home. That's when you found them probably. They're fake, I swear. I would never leave my husband and my children for anything and anyone, so that excludes the fact that I cheated on you. That letter was from Kingsley. You see, he gave me the opportunity to work from home for the next few months, so I could take care of you and our children. I didn't want to tell you because I knew you would never let me do that. But I want to. I need to take care of you every day and make you smile and laugh and to keep you happy and safe. I love you, Draco Potter-Malfoy, and this is the only thing I'm sure about right this moment. I wish I could've told you this when you were awake, but I am too much of a coward" Harry kissed his forehead, then he went to his room, but not before he heard some footsteps.
“Should we say hi?”
“Easy Potter, we are just having fun, right? Nothing wrong with that, as you should know.”
Blaise didn’t seem very keen to be socializing at the moment but was proper enough to answer.
“Perhaps, I was just pleased not having to talk to you.”
“I certainly wouldn’t object to some dark chocolate.” Jason leaned in and whispered, enjoying the slight bobbing Adams apple and the widened eyes.
“I… did not see… you there, Potter.” There. He hadn’t blamed the idiot for their fall, even though it most certainly was.
“It was… difficult.”
“Lovers…” Harry whispered out loud. Not to Snape, but to confirm the truth to the preposterous idea. Both Sirius and Remus had been the two uncles he had always wished fore. But seeing them together at gatherings and birthdays, had always reminded Harry more of brothers. Now, looking back over their time together it made so much sense. The gentle smiles, small touches, how Remus was the only one who could calm Sirius down after meetings with the order, concerning difficult planning or discussions.
“It’s morning. Look.” Jason was already sitting up and his hair looked even more in disarray than usual. Harry’s own hair probably matched very well. As he stretched his body, he had accidently kicked something from the end of his bed to the floor. A lightly colored packages with a small green ribbon laid there, waiting to be opened. After getting the present up, he noticed a rather big pile lying on the bed. Looking to his right he could see Jason was already opening his own but consistently smaller pile.
Trying to compose himself, Potter didn’t look very amused by the thought of having to share a carriage with the Slytherins.
Quickly stepping over he was more than a little surprised to see Lupin staring back at him.
Draco forced himself to get up slowly and not dash for the door. He could feel the icy stare of narrow black eyes at the back of his head. He had almost reached freedom, landing his hand on the door handle, when once again Professor Snape stopped him.
‘Come on, Potter!’ “Yeah, we talked about it, but he said his aunt is probably expecting him if nothing else comes up. He just didn’t seem very excited, at all. They aren’t very close.”
Harry only managed to duck by throwing himself into the snow, watching as Draco threw another after him with a smirk.
“How are you? Are you hurting?”
“Maybe.” Hagrid shrug.
Looking at his torn robes, he left it on the bed and sat down – reminding himself, he had to fix it later.
Jason nodded. “Yes, but not right now. I’m… not certain how well he would take it and even then, I just don’t know how to act around him. It’s just easier when he is my head of house.”
Seeing the interior, Draco sniffed in disdain. “Really? You couldn’t think of anything besides your own dorm?”
“Beside,” He laughed. “I left my change, so I think we are even.”
He had been so sure that this would be the defying moment in his career. That he would show them exactly how impressive he could be. He had spent so much time reading up on all the different kinds of artifacts they were supposed to bring back. Wasted time. If Potter and Black could see him now, they would be rolling on the floor laughing at the ‘errand boy’. He swore that when he left Hogwarts, he would never see them again. Each one of those arrogant, spoiled losers’ had stolen something from him. Potter had stolen his best friend and Black had stolen…. Technically Black didn’t steal anything, more likely prevented anything good from ever approaching his life. It shouldn’t even had surprised him. After Lily refused to talk to him anymore, he had only spoken to one Gryffindor and when the right time came and they were supposed to stand up together, the cowardly werewolf had stepped down and left him in the dirt.
“Ah, I see. Sorry but he’s certainly not so far away. I know Blaise saw him afterwards so maybe he just fell asleep or something. I don’t think you need to worry.”
defend him.” Blaise denied. “He is
Knott rolled his eyes at the annoyed tone. “Potter? How was he?”
“You are kidding? How could that possibly be true?” she grinned. “Unless of course… the little golden boy actually has a crush on you? Oh, Draco please become my special little Gryffindor snake?” She mocked and batted her eyes at him.
Blaise finally looked at him in a rather childish manner.
“Hi, what are you doing down here?”
The two spectators both voiced their dislike for the interrogation.
“I agree. Compromising and change is part of relationships.” Dumbledore started walking again.
“I do not know.” Draco sneered. “And I never claimed we were in any relationship, I simply stated that I cared for him.”
“Don’t know.” Jason was still eating cookies. “Ugh!” He jumped up so fast the cookie in his mouth broke and landed on the floor.
“Easy now, I already paired you up so there is no need for disagreeing.”  He advised.
Harry backed back from the door as he felt the need to sit down. Without saying a word, he left to sit down on the couch and Draco took a small step into the apartment. Enough to close the door behind him.
“I heard… smaller rumors through the years about your childhood. I wasn’t sure how much was true.”
“Would you like to see my place?”
“No reason.” He shrugged. “I just haven’t been talking to him besides in class. ‘Don’t really know him.”
“I can see the confusion on your face. Yes, Mr. Potter, whilst the headmaster has asked me to, I disagree. I did not find myself ever caring for your godfather-“
Soon everyone split up into smaller groups and left Draco and Harry to be the only ones standing back. Harry couldn’t help but look back, wondering if Remus and Snape were fighting. He hadn’t seen the closest person he had to a family, in almost 8 months. Was it so terrible he wanted to spend some time alone with him?
“Good, really good actually.” Harry nodded. “We are taking things slowly.”
“Harry, wait up!”
“Harry.”
After eating so much dinner and squeezing down a bowl of chocolate mousse, the Gryffindor friends headed upstairs. On the way out from the Great Hall, they ran into Draco and his friends. Draco smiled at him as their eyes meet, but Harry felt the smile was forced. About to ask him what was wrong, he was silenced with a passionate kiss. The tingly feeling bubbling up through his stomach and heart stumped him from asking any sort of question before the Slytherins had left out front.
On the other hand, Draco mused. It would be easy enough. He would only have to pull off the best performance of his life. He didn’t even have to consider the option of losing, because he was after all, a Malfoy. Malfoys didn’t lose.
“Lovelife?” Knott snorted. “Jeez, you got it bad.”
“I can imagine. While this is a fine wine, the champagne had been imported from a rather good friend of Theodore’s father and are usually not available in England.”
“Maybe…” Harry didn’t really know how to answer that. It was true, he somehow seemed less excited than the others. Maybe it was because he didn’t have someone to go home too. But he never had to see the Dursleys again. That at least made him happy. Suddenly his eyes caught sight of a family of blondes and indeed the Malfoys were leaving the Hogwarts grounds with their son a few steps behind. He was looking around and Harry hated himself for hoping he was the one the blond boy was looking for.
Right now, the seventh-year boys’ room was in complete disarray. Luna and Hermione were sitting on Ron‘s bed chatting amused as they watched the boys run around, looking for all their clothes. Ron was randomly searching through his trunk, throwing underwear and shirts all around. Dean was helping Seamus look for his favorite sweater that Seamus kept insisting
“Don’t you think it is weird? and the way they whispered seemed more like a fight than a discussion.”
“No, just wanted… to feel you completely.” He panted and gave a sweaty smile. A relieved chuckle escaped the pale lips as Draco crawled across the bed to lie on top of his lover. Both looked down as they watched their bodies connect once more. Moaning now seemed more out of amazement than pleasure. As Draco laid down on his arms on each side of Harry’s body, the smaller Gryffindor grabbed him by his broad shoulders and held on. He felt every movement in the muscled back and the shivers each time Draco gasped. Harry wasn’t sure what was possible the best part about this experience; the lustful silver eyes locked in his, the way Draco’s toned stomach pressed against- and stroked his cock, or possibly the way they stole eachothers’ oxygen every time they kissed.
“Easy Potter, breath. It wasn’t how I wanted it either, but it’s done now so we might as well use it to our advances.”
Jason didn’t seem to take it personally and if he did, he didn’t mention it.
It worried him a bit that Draco hadn’t come to dinner. Hopefully, he wasn’t off somewhere sulking.
The rest of the day went by quickly. After visiting Hagrid, he only had two more classes and then the Gryffindor gang spent the rest of the afternoon hanging out in the common room. Even though Harry loved spending time with his friends he felt completely exhausted. He would actually rather have gone to bed than having dinner, but Hermione didn’t look overly pleased by his idea.
The two boys hiding under the cloak were deadly silent as the sound of Remus’ footsteps lessened down the hall. Harry hadn’t really wished to spy on the two professors but Jason had seemed quite certain that this was the only way to get Snape to talk about his father.
“It’s not so big but it is a great place considering the rent and distance from the shop.” Lauris slipped off his shoes and Severus followed his behavior. Lauris showed him the small kitchen, where he couldn’t imagine being able to cook anything without hitting his head on the cabinets.
“I guess.” Harry was still thinking. “You know what, there is one thing you can do, if you are really serious about changing?”
Please. Stop.
Nodding understandingly Remus sadly answered; “Yes, Professor Dumbledore told the staff. How is he?”
Inside the darkened room, on his bed, lay the three presents he needed.
The students from the years of seventh to firth roared and cheered as the tired man entered from the side door at the back of the room. Waving slightly the new Professor quickly sat down next to Madam Hooch. Harry clapped so much his hands turned red and embarrassingly he shook his hands and tried to get some feeling back into them. Grinning slightly, Seamus did the same and grimaced.
Malfoy’s hands left his, as they travelled up to his neck. Sliding them against his pulse before resting on his cheeks. Letting Malfoy take control Harry moved his own fingers up and went terribly slow, truly feeling Malfoy’s body under his fingertips. The toned stomach, slightly folding from bowing down to meet Harry, the chest muscles, tight even under the multiple clothing. He lifted his hands up, desperate to lock them into the blond locks. Continuing sitting relaxed and sharing gentle deep kisses, they came to a naturel stop.
How will everyone deal with it?
It finally doled on Harry what he wanted, and it was as if his entire mouth suddenly became dry.
Love TMB
Zabini waited until she had passed before answering.
“So, Harry why did you suddenly feel for a snowball fight?” He lifted his hand in a surrendering motion. “Don’t get me wrong, it sounds fun, I just didn’t realize you were such a fan of violence.” He laughed while Dean elbowed him in the side.
Practically falling into his armchair, Severus massaged his temple, trying to relief the tension he felt building up. When it didn’t work after what he assumed was minutes, he grabbed his wand and repaired the glass still lying on the floor. Although when he couldn’t find the energy to refill the glass, he simply held it. The only heard noise was the kindling fire slowly dying out.
As Harry took a third portion of scrambled eggs, he noticed Hermione giving him a strange look.
Now he was directly above him. Sitting in the tree just beside where Blaise was hiding, Jason gracefully and soundlessly let go of the branch. He landed on his feet and waited in patience to see if Blaise could feel him. As the boy straight in front of him had yet to realize his presence, Jason jumped.
“Are you sure? I mean, it looks like your parents are already planning the wedding so why not just go with it?” Pansy mocked him in a sweetened voice as the others laughed. Clearly, they had forgotten whom they were speaking too.
Harry could only response with a needy purr.
“You okay?”
“Mr. Malfoy, stay.” Annoying, meddling old man. Why did he feel the need to push his extravagant long nose into others business? Couldn’t he get some kind of hobby?
“I’m not ready.” Jason admitted. It might have been a huge shock for anyone if they heard that the most spoken of couple in Hogwarts – with now the exception of Malfoy and Harry – hadn’t actually had sex yet. Not just that, but they hadn’t ever gone beyond making out. Jason wasn’t a virgin and hadn’t been for almost two years but having sex wasn’t the problem. No, the problem lied in whom it was with. Blaise was his mate. The one and only he would ever have. If they had sex, it would bond them for life, even if Blaise had no idea what they were doing. It was more binding than getting married and twice as complicated. Blaise had been handed the same excuse every single time, things were heating up and he was looking more and more annoyed.
“My family, I guess you could call them.” Harry continued looking at the beautiful scenario in front of them. “I live with my Aunt, uncle and their son.”
Dread quickly dropped as a bomb into his stomach. ‘Can we talk’ was usually the beginning of every breakup that had ever happened. The worry must have been plain to see, because Draco hurried to smile and tell him everything was okay.
“It’s cold.” He complained pouting.
“If I do this…” Malfoy asked carefully. “Will you go with me to Hogsmeade next time?”
Sighing annoyed, Severus handed him a folded note from his pocket.
“I thought you and Potter were doing it?” Her eyes narrowed in suspicion.
“Jay… my bluejay…” he gasped and desperately pushed his body up against him.
Ten minutes later the handsome boys were dressed to impress and ready they went downstairs to meet the others. A few pairs from the younger years were already conversation excitedly. Harry shook a quick hand with a few of the boys he knew and remembered to complement their dates.
Hermione looked at the ceiling and wrinkled her nose.
What? Just the idea of Malfoy saying anything to help anyone seemed so unlikely.
Hearing him raise his voice at Harry, only added fuel to the fire.
“Okay, I guess.” Harry sighed. It probably wouldn’t be any better no matter what robe he found. He just wasn’t that into fancy clothes.
“’Morning Jason. Slept well?”
“Hell no, they-“
since the day I told you who I was! You never talk to me unless it’s about school or to point out how unhappy you are with me!”
please leave a review, it means so much to me, every single one!
He took a deep breath feeling the harsh lump in his throat but refused to acknowledge its existence.
Harry nodded and returned the glass.
Nearing the boy on the couch he reached out to him. Reaching out a hand, Mr. Melck looked at him, probably wondering if he could trust him. Every fiber in his body fought for not giving in and taking the outreached hand back. As a warm hand entered his own, he let out his breath, which he hadn’t even realized he had been holding. Rising slowly the two men threw their arms around one another, hugging and fighting to leave the other with the possibility to breathe. Gathering the boy in his arms, Snape cupped the back of his head, feeling the same brown thick hair he had touched almost seventeen years ago.
Harry smiled. “No, I suppose not.”
“Answer me you coward!” Harry almost choked as his throat was getting dry. “When you kissed me for the first time…” he left the question dangle.
Ron, whom had just stuffed his mouth with sausage, nearly choked answering for him.
“Jay… you don’t have too, really. It didn’t have to be now or never, I just want us to move-” Blaise reached out to pull him back up, but Jason gently knocked them away and went for the zipper in his black denim.
Harry shrugged and turned back to restlessly flipping through his book, making sure to look busy in case Professor Binns came by.
Coughing slightly, Harry tried again.
“Oh! Right, sorry.” Harry could feel the heat gathering in his cheeks.
“Potter.” A long pale hand stretched out. “I believe a congratulation is in order.”
“A number of ingredients which can be used in various potions, most insignificant, others… slightly atrocious.” The professor gave no other indication as to what the thief could be wishing to achieve, instead he discreetly leaned closer to the Gryffindor.
Who was he kidding? The almost silent apartment screamed loneliness and it truly felt cold inside and out. Looking at the grandfather clock, Harry felt the air in his lung turn icy. The burn continued down his body and collected in his empty stomach. Seeing the time reminded him on the giant painful thought that had haunted him all day.
“Hey guys, I’m going with Potter to make sure he doesn’t get lost.” He said smirking at the now flustered boy.
“Sorry.” Harry cleared his throat rather embarrassed. “It just seems kind of obvious something is going on between you.”
“Yeah,” Draco Cheshire-smile widened. “You did.”
“It’s only a little sleeping powder. He won’t even notice the difference before falling asleep.” The man smiled comfortingly and showed Harry a hand full of blue crystals. Grinding them up in his hands, he gently threw it over the dragons head. The crystal, now turned to powder, settled over the giant head and almost vanished as it touched the warm scales, seeping into the skin.  “You can try to lead him in now, if you want.” the man stepped back as if to give them space.
Draco zoned out during the sorting hat ceremony and the headmaster’s yearly welcoming speech. More nonsense of house bonding and remembering to see the goodness in an otherwise evil world. Scanning the giant room, Draco could see the golden trio paying close attention to the headmaster. Draco snorted. What a surprise, they were never able to think for themselves.
“No, Professor. Nothing.”
“But he did start-“ Harry tried weakly to defend the boy whom had become a good friend to him. He really didn’t wish to say Draco deserved the cuts he got for it, but Jason was the kind of person who would beat himself in the head with it for a long time.
Soon though, he felt Draco other hand slip down his stomach. His touch stopped at his zipper and Harry tensed up. While the bulge in his black pants were rather noticeable, no one had ever touched him so intimately before.
“Malfoy if you get the knives and gloves, Harry you get the ingredients, then I will get the fire started.” The two boys nodded in agreement and Harry headed for the table. Coming back with his hands full of jars, Zabini asked him to help Malfoy shred the Bartle wings and chop the Alistsky bark. Grabbing a knife, Harry stood silently beside the blond boy and started chopping. It was mostly quiet beside the occasional bubbling sounds from the cauldron, but Harry couldn’t help but feel it was kind of comfortable. They each had their part of the job and whenever Harry or Draco had finished an ingredient, they would slide it across the table where Zabini and Jason would collect it and use it at the right moment. Trying to concentrate on not cutting his fingers off, Harry tried his best to ignore the heat from Malfoy whenever he gently bumped his hip against his. It was so gentle and only happened when Malfoy reached for something in the middle of the table, so it could easily be passed off as accidental.
anything.” Jason explained in a smaller voice. “I just… wanted you to know.”
“What?”
“So-“ Knott gracefully sat down at the seat beside him. “You look unusually happy for a regular Sunday morning.” He said in a way-too innocent voice.
Laughing sadly, Pansy shook her head. “No, I was foolish to think I could change your mind. It was always right in front of me, but I was so desperate to make a perfect couple. But we are never going to be like that. We can never make each other happy because you don’t love me.” She cried silently as tears fell on her dress.
“Escaping!” Lauris laughed as they continued. Severus was suddenly glad he had begun to duel as much as he had that year. He had never been the athletic-type and a few years back he would already have felt his lungs burning. The darkness must have hidden them from the streetlight, because soon the yelling stopped. Lauris suddenly pulled him into a swing, and they ran down a staircase that led them to a beach. The warm sand made its way into his tight round up shoes and he felt slightly uncomfortable as he trotted around in them. Finally Lauris stopped beside the stone wall towards the sea. Letting out a huge breath of relief he laughed and sat down in the sand. Looking up at Severus, he started pulling his hand, asking him to sit with him.
“I won anyway! You have to tell your father you don’t want to be married-“
Wiggling his eyebrows, Dean cheekily answered; “You don’t have to do it here.”
Smiling, the pair let go of each other and Hermione went back to the changing room. As Harry took a deep breath, he was kind of embarrassed when he felt a lump in his throat. He was surely not going to be standing in a shop full of his friend and start crying. Merlin! His friends would never let that go. He waited for Hermione before they headed to the counter to pay for their items. The boys came shortly after and everyone was ready to leave.
"The floor was murder on my knees and back. I may need a couple hours, possibly a massage too," He smirked suggestively, guiding the brunet's hands to the small of his back. Draco's gasp broke off into laughter when Harry grabbed tight handfuls of his ass, kneading the flesh before patting each cheek gently.
Flipping over, Harry shuffled into the middle of the bed. Holding himself up by the forearms he watched with rapt attention, captivated by the way Draco undid the buttons of his shirt. Unspeaking, Draco knelt onto the bed, and with each button that revealed soft white flesh he shuffled closer to his boyfriend until he found himself straddling his lap. Dropping down heavily, Draco sighed as Harry's hands roamed at his sides, creeping along his chest then into his hair as the brunet pulled him into a searching kiss. Shaking his shirt free from his wrists, Draco dug his nails into the meat of the other boys shoulders, kissing with a brutality that left both of them panting and eager to get closer.
"Come for me," He said, brushing his lips against the blond's ear and relishing every laboured breath that reached his own.
"It's the weekend, Harry." Ginny said through a grin, enjoying the older boys flustered expression at being corrected.
"So perfect," He murmured, bending over to kiss Draco's right cheek, repeating the action on the other side as he suddenly drove two crooked fingers inside Draco.
Draco stammered, for once thrown entirely off his guard that he couldn't resist when Harry laid a chaste kiss to his mouth. Blinking rapidly Draco fought to tamper down his growing blush.
"When are you going to let your grudge against Hermione go?" Harry all but groaned, running a hand down his face as Draco's grew more scowling. "You can't hold the duel against her forever."
An excited shudder ran its way across Draco's spine and he grinned.
"May want to cover up." Harry offered in answer and Draco stepped back as though struck, eyes flying to the small mirror stood above a leaking sink. Standing before his reflection Draco was alarmed by the angry red marks marring his skin made by Harry's pawing hands.
With a bored smirk, Draco straightened the collar of Harry's shirt, pleased by the large red and purple bruise marks littering his slender throat.
"I'm yours." He vowed, not entirely sure what prompted this change but definitely on board with it. His hands settled on Draco's hips, not guiding but holding him as he sunk back down until his ass was pressed cleaned against Harry's pelvis. Throwing his head back in a moan, Draco gripped the poster beside Harry's head and used it for balance as he rode the other boy frantically, twisting his hips at a vengeful pace that had both their chests heaving in tandem. Behind them the headboard smacked loudly with every desperate movement, matched by hoarse pants and guttural moans. Harry's hands roamed every part of Draco he could reach, tugging at his hips to get himself deeper inside the blond, gripping his ass just to feel Draco clench around him, raw lust driving the drag of fingers along the Slytherin boys stomach to hear the stupid little sigh he emitted. Harry was gone for Draco, and that was something he didn't think would ever change.
Draco was fuming.
Shaking his head Harry watched her go, dragging a hand along his mouth as he did. Looks like he owned Neville a chocolate frog, the boy having bet Harry in their fourth year that the Weasley girl had a major crush on him. Chuckling to himself, Harry made a mental note to tell Draco about the incident, sure the other boy would get a kick out it. As he walked into the common room he didn't catch the flickering shadow following him, nor hear the angered huff it let out. The brunet just waltzed into the common room, making his way to the larger couch facing Hermione, who still had her head stuck in a book, and Ron, who was busy enacting a tickling charm on Dean Thomas while he attempted to study in the back corner.
"What do you think you're doing?" Harry asked and the words rolled off his tongue raggedly, as if every breath pained him. Draco shuddered, eyes flitting open and so overblown by his pupils Harry couldn't help the groan that echoed out from him.
"Be nice." She said, playfully batting Ron's shoulder in a way that did not go unnoticed by Harry. Fighting back a knowing smile, he perked up when Draco appeared in the door frame. Waving the other boy over he didn't notice the flicker of darkness that washed over his pale eyes for a moment, too busy making room on the couch for the other boy. Draco took his place, stock still beside Harry and stayed that way hours later when the brunet finally walked him to his chambers.
"You're not listening to a word I'm saying, are you, Potter?"
On a whim, the brunet sat back on his haunches and raised a hand, slapping it across Draco's smooth right cheek. The reaction was immediate, Draco's back snapping in half as he arched, a low whine escaping his throat that had something in Harry break. His hand retracted from inside Draco, earning a quiet moan of protest, before he flipped the other boy over and onto his back. Legs like noodles, Draco didn't react when Harry shoved them apart and settled in. Gripping his cock Harry leaned over the blond, green eyes staring down intently into hazy pools of black and grey, and thrust inside him. Draco gasped at the sensation, trembling thighs moving to pull Harry in deeper as he bottomed out inside his lover. Choking at the warmth, the tightness, that engulfed him, Harry dropped his forehead onto Draco's shoulder. Mouthing at the skin he slowly started up a rhythm, pulling out a few inches before driving back inside Malfoy's tight heat.
"As if you'd ever voluntarily let someone see me naked," Draco scoffed though the words were a little breathless as he craned his head back just enough to smirk at the green-eyed boy. "I'm sure you'd like to keep this image all to yourself."
"Incarcerous."
Whatever response Harry had at the comment Draco made died the instant the other boy's mouth fell on his own. Their movements were smooth, unhurried as the blond nipped the Gryffindors bottom lip, teasing for entry that was immediately granted. Harry lost himself in the sensations, all but dragging Draco closer to him, pinning the boy into his warm sheets as he let his tongue ponder past plush lips and into a hot mouth. Moaning, it was only when his hand landed on his discarded wand that Harry remembered what they were doing in his room in the first place. Jerking back he ignored Draco's confused huff, the blond's hands immediately linking around his neck in an attempt to bring him back down again. And boy was that tempting. Flush high in his cheeks and lips ruby red, Draco's debauched expression was making it increasingly hard for Harry to turn away when all he wanted was to go back to thoroughly ruining him.
"Fine, but if you want me to stop speaking then you best keep my mouth preoccupied in other ways, Potter." the blond smirked, pressing back against Harry's tight fist. He gasped when the brunet suddenly let go, face planting into hot sheets as Harry slipped off the bed and left Draco's body cold in his absence. Moments later soft hands gripped his shoulders, yanking him to his knees. Draco blinked up when Harry pointed at the ground at the end of his bed, tilting his head in mock confusion. If Potter didn't state what he wanted, Draco wasn't going to help him out.
"Draco," He sighed, words intended to be scowling but coming out far too fond and flustered. Draco dragged his tongue along his bottom lip, clearly uncaring of Harry's internal struggle. His hands settled on his belt, slowly tugging the zip down as fingers encroached on the growing bulge sitting there.
"Good morning, Ginny." He said, tone friendly enough but eyes feral. The girl ducked her head immediately, scampering past them with a barely uttered hello back. Harry watched the exchange in confusion until his face turned red in understanding.
"I don't take well to tardiness, Potter," Draco murmured against his skin, taking time to run the tip of his tongue up to the other boys ear. "Especially when you were the one so desperate to see me."
"As if you would dare trying to read my mind, Potter." Draco scoffed, tapping down on the blush that rose in his cheeks. When did he become so obvious, so easy to read, let alone to Harry, when he began to shut down.
Draco snorted, blinking up at the ceiling for a moment before responding. "Mind untying me now, the feeling's starting to lose its luxury now that this is all over and we're disgustingly sweaty."
As Harry's clearly disshelved self came running across the quidditch field his team mates had no confusion as to what had held their captain up. Rolling their eyes at his excuses, knowing smirks were thrown behind the unsuspecting Captains back who was too distracted by icy grey eyes to notice either way.
The words were cut off by sure hands gripping onto his tie and pulling him forward, connecting Harry's lips with the red-headed girls in a blunt kiss. He winced at the harsh contact, hands flailing at his sides in shock. When Ginny jerked back, seemingly pleased with herself, Harry was still stuttering as he tried to comprehend what just happened.
"Take off your clothes and get on the bed." The blond punctuated the words with a final tug before completely exiting Harry's space. Walking over to the small desk tucked into the corner of the room, Draco tore off his robe and threw it onto the surface. He laid his wand gently in one of the drawers, slipping off his shoes and throwing his tie down before directing his gaze to the bed. He tried not to roll his eyes at the fumbling figure that greeted him. Stripped to his underwear, Harry was struggling to get his pant leg off, dancing around on one foot until it finally jerked free, glasses sitting pretty on Draco's nightstand. Without remorse, Draco shoved at the boys back, sending him sprawling face first onto green sheets.
First and foremost, the boy was a Gryffindor. That should've been enough to bar Draco from even having to be in the same room as him.
"Draco?"
"No. But I have a feeling they will be soon."
"No," Harry gritted out, breaths laboured and abdomen clenching as he tried to keep up his powerful rhythm. "I want to see your face, Draco." His tone was pleading, mouth begging as it glided along Draco's collarbones and sucked onto the curve of his neck just below his jawline.
A deafening crack sprung through the air as Draco wrenched Harry's belt free, dropping it to the tiled floor, and sunk to his knees. With wide eyes the brunet stared down at the scowling grey eyed boy, unsure what was happening. Usually this would be the part where Draco shoved Harry to the ground, had his filthy way with him. Instead there was Draco, unflinching as he yanked Harry's trousers down and got to work.
"Fuck." The blond shouted, sound punched out as his head flung back in pleasure. All too soon Draco was rocking against the fingers inside him, trying to drive them deeper, preening when Harry managed a lingering touch against the spot inside him that made Draco all but sob into the sheets. Harry watched every single moment with intense focus, never wanting to miss a second. Draco was truly beautiful like this, lost to pleasure and desperate. His hands shook, chest heaving as the prideful glint that always flickered in his eyes gave way to pure want. Back arched like a cat in heat on every thrust of Harry's fingers as they stretched him open, goosebumps littering the skin alongside sucked bruises Harry couldn't stop himself from leaving across his shoulders.
The blond just scowled back, side stepping Weasley and nearly knocking over Potter's stuffy friend as she appeared around the corner, books huddled to her chest threatening to slip over at the assault.
A tied-up Draco Malfoy meant a Draco unable to seduce Harry with carnal thoughts and imagery. Eyeing the blond who had flung his shirt across the room, pants around his ankles as he unashamedly got himself off, Harry raised his wand and muttered a single word.
"What happened to keeping my mouth occupied?" Draco argued back, preening when Harry knocked his legs down, forcing the blond to hook his ankles behind Harry's back as he suddenly thrust inside him. The stretch burned in the best way, the Slytherins toes curling as Harry pressed hips against Draco's ass as tightly as possible, forcing Draco to take in every inch of him. Discarding his glasses to the floor, the brunet ran his tongue along the pale strip of Draco's neck, worrying the skin with his teeth until it grew near purple, kissing the spots gently once he was done. Working his way up by the time he reached his boyfriend's mouth, Draco was trembling, delicious pleas spilling from red lips, begging Harry to move, to fuck him already. His eyes all but rolled back when Harry finally pulled out, dragging torturously slow against Draco's inner walls, making sure every second was felt before he slammed back inside him roughly, skidding them a half-inch across the floor and Draco keened, loving every minute of it.
"I know that look," Harry panted out, gaining some sensibility to pull his trousers back up from the floor and re-looped through his belt. "You better not be practicing occlumency right now."
"Nothing," Harry whispered and forced Draco to maintain eye contact when he finally stepped away. "Just realised how good gold and green look together. Gold and red suits you, Draco."
Harry snorted back, shaking his head as he brushed a thumb across Draco's nipple, enjoying the sigh it evoked from the blond. Dipping his head he swirled his tongue along the erect nub, nipping quickly when Draco made to bat his face away.
He hadn't meant to snoop, honestly. It was just that Draco still felt a little anxious when wondering into the Gryffindor common room by himself. Usually Harry stood waiting for him in the hallway, easy grin and knowing eyes as he took the Slytherin boy's hand and dragged him over to his waiting friends. So that afternoon had found Draco pacing in front of the common room doors, waiting for the scarred boy to arrive. He hadn't expected the flash of red that stormed past him, eyes too firmly trained ahead to notice Draco's form. No, Ginny Weasley was on a mission and her target had just rounded the corner, eyes trained on his feet as he hummed to himself.
"You can do all that, but conjuring a bird gives you a migraine?" Draco remarked dryly, groaning when Harry shoved his legs up and towards his chest, exposing his ass to the cool air. Nearly ripping off his shirt and tie, the brunet wasted no time slicking up his fingers before driving one into Draco's tight entrance. The Slytherin cried out, shaking as Harry threw either leg over his shoulders, smiling cheekily down at the writhing blond as he hastily prepped him.
Whatever scolding Hermione had at the tip of her tongue bled away to excitement. Primly, she straightened her back, a gentle smile on her lips. "Oh, so Harry finally confessed? They're officially together?"
over and over to himself until the word began to roll naturally off the tip of his tongue.
The next morning after breakfast, Draco followed Harry back to the Gryffindor commons. The brunet was intent on asking his friends if they wanted to join them in heading to Hogsmeade. As they approached the entryway, Draco's eyes landed on a familiar head of long ginger hair at the other end of the hall. Tangling a hand in dark locks still ruffled from the night before, Draco enveloped Harry in a claiming kiss, roughly biting at his lips and basically sticking his tongue down the other mans throat. Dazed, the brunet blinked back up at him as Draco pulled back, running a thumb across Potter's wet bottom lip, humming to himself. Over Harry's shoulder the blond raised a hand and waved smugly at someone approaching them.
"Always so primitive, Potter." He grumbled. Returning to stand in front of the bashful Gryffindor, Draco yanked the scarf that hung loose from the scarred boy's neck. Wrapping it around his own he fought back the smile that threatened to break across his face at Harry's pleased look.
Draco scowled further, grey eyes flickering with fury and something else. Tearing his own gaze away, Harry hunched further over his notes and aimed his wand ahead. He would get the spell done by the end of the night if it killed him. It wasn't hard, Harry reminded himself when his shaky whisper of Avis failed to produce any birds. In all honesty, the brunet was surprised his wand hadn't just burst into flames in order to save him the embarrassment of failing yet again. It was after a few more weak attempts that Harry's ears pricked to the sound of soft pants mumbled into the sheets beside him. Weary, the Gryffindor glance out of the corner of his eye only to have his jaw nearly drop clear off his face at the sight which greeted him. At some point during Harry's distracted spell casting, Draco has rolled over onto his front. The side of his face pressed into the red sheets, eyes shut in pleasure, the blond had been busy grinding his hips into the mattress in torturously slow rolls. Harry's wand clattered silently from his hand, immediately swallowed flying pages as the brunet frantically kicked his books aside and invaded his boyfriend's space. With strong hands, he gripped Draco's hips, pressing them hard into the mattress to still all future movement.
"I'm not sure," Draco admitted, hand now slowly descending down Harry's neck, only stopping when he reached his chest. "I think I like the idea of you looking a little more rugged. Sully the good boy image you've got going on."
Harry waited until Draco had lowered himself back onto his knees against the hardwood floors. The sight was serene, something Harry wished desperately to be able to photograph, to be able to look back at over and over again. Instead, he stood and stared for a moment, dragging a hand along the curve of Draco's jaw as he sat himself on the edge of the bed before him. Harry wasted no time in spreading his legs, dragging the zipper of his pants down while Draco watched in reverence. Grey eyes never wavered as the brunet took himself in hand, stroking slowly before waving Draco to come forward. And he did, knees landing hard on the wood as he shuffled forward to all but shove his face into the groove of Harry's hip, mouthing desperately against the fabric until Harry took control of his movements. Strong fingers threaded into his hair, yanking at the strands and directing Draco's mouth to hot flesh. The blond sunk into his motions, trusting Harry guide and balance him.
“Sorry,” Draco laughed. “I won’t waste your time; I just wanted to know if you were feeling better.”
“So-“ Malfoy started, his eyes gleaming. “You never answered my message.”
And his determination blossomed. In the bookstore he found a great novel to Hermione about a muggle who grew up as the only wizard in the family. Harry was sure Hermione could use it to compare and analyze her own upbringing. He also found a newly edited album from Celestina Warbeck for Mrs. Weasley. The three teens had been to seven stores and heading for the eighth, when Harry asked them a question.
“How. Was. Your summer?”
You could cut the tension in there with a knife and Harry wrecked his brain trying to find a possible topic of conversation.
So, when he noticed that Jason didn’t take the empty seat beside him during breakfast, he didn’t really pay attention to the usually loud teen. Eating the last of his honey melon, Blaise took the trip towards the classroom, alone. He was never truly alone at Hogwarts but he didn’t mind getting away from his fellow students every once in a while. Drama wasn’t a wanted activity in his every day, and unfortunately, Draco had a horrible habit of bringing it wherever he went.
A few days into September, the leaves had started to become orange and golden. The weather had already gotten colder, and Harry felt the need for his short-sleeved sweater almost every morning. Looking around the Great Hall whilst enjoying his breakfast, Harry noticed all the people he had barely spoken to last year. Since Harry hadn’t given much thought to his attraction towards men since the beginning of summer, he was finally able to stare at boys for real. Especially a boy from Ravenclaw had gotten his share of attention walking past the Gryffindor table just a few seconds ago, giving Harry a morning wave. To stop himself from looking after him, Harry desperately tried to concentrate on his breakfast.
“For how long?”
“I just feel like we have to start over somehow. I can’t just pretend nothing happened.” He whispered and enfolded himself.
“Oh.” Draco, -although knowing his friend wasn’t much for meeting parents- didn’t comprehend the horrifying situation. “And… you didn’t like her?”
“Maybe he didn’t want to hurt yeh. Maybe the whole idea of being casual is easier for him to make everyone happy.”
As Severus told the slight slip of information, he realized the dread of never actually telling anyone of the true result of his travels. It had been over a decade and he had been a completely different person back then. A persona, which he had left behind as hate and promises of power, had corrupted his every thought.
“Yes, some jasmine tea with milk and sugar on the side. Oh, and ideally some Jaffa Cakes, please.” Albus delightfully asked.
“Why must I always teach you good manners, Draco? For instant, keeping a lady waiting is not very gentleman-like.” She smiled like a Cheshire cat. Before Draco could sneer a comeback, Theodore took over the conversation.
“I don’t know, Harry.”
He was leaving…
“Bastard.” Harry sneered in fake anger, truly trying to escape the stronger teens grip.
Chapter 28
“How dare you?” He boomed. “I will not have you anyway near my son! As if you could ever be good enough, a simple half-blood!?”
“If I tell you something, do you promise not to tell?”
Finally, the boy took a shaken deep breath and looked at him. Even though the rest of his exterior seemed careful, even frightful, his eyes stood strong and unyielding. Looking away for a short moment, he picked out a folded piece of paper from his pant pocket and handed it to him.
“Seriously Potter, if you tell me now that you have lost your mind, don’t expect me to-“ Draco’s insult fell from his lips as he watched the stonewall transform. The beautiful carved door appeared as Harry ended his walk.
for fun.”
Both boys turned to see a group of Slytherins, Harry had no idea who were. The boys looked expectedly at the blond leader. Turning Draco gave him a brief kiss before jumping down from the window.
Getting up from his bed, he started pacing. This couldn’t be true! Everything was carefully planned and it was going according to plan! Seduce Potter, check.  Date Potter, check. Sleep with Potter and get his freedom. There was no part in this plan were he started giving a flying shit about how Potter would feel about this whole ordeal.
As soon as Harry and the golden trio entered the great hall, it was obvious something exciting was going on. They had apparently missed a quick speech from professor Dumbledore, as the older man strolled back to his chair at the teachers table.
“No,” Luna shook her blond curls. “-But she does have a statue on the sixth floor.”
“Oh, mmm…”
“Merlin, Harry I’m gonna shoot my load so far up in you.” Draco was clearly getting close and not wishing to finish without him, Draco grabbed his cock and used the lubed hand to jerk him off.
“Well, there is certainly more I don’t know, but Parkinson happens to be my cousin-“
Laying a gentle hand on Draco’s shoulder, Blaise whispered.
“What’s wrong?” Remus answered concerned.
Malfoy as well, continued to take part in his dream. In it, Malfoy had certainly seemed like a guy he could be dating. Harry had had a hard time looking past how much of a prat the boy was, so it had never really been a question, but he definitely wasn’t blind either. He understood why so many of the girls – Gryffindors and others – thought of him as ‘attractive’.
“Yes, but I was wrong-“
“Well, yes, I suppose we do. I’m rather surprised Granger would admit to that.”
“Do you know another Malfoy at this school?” Dean mocked his boyfriend.
“BUT,” she continued. “I didn’t get as many extra points as I had expected. I probably spent too much time focusing on the theory. I knew I should have-“
DM POV
“Can’t understand how you can possible eat those.” Blaise wrinkled his nose as Jason tore into the bloodpops, quickly throwing two into his mouth.
“You know why I couldn’t stay. I would have left him but I physically couldn’t.”
Looking back at the Christmas ball in his hand, he blushed with embarrassment. While the ball was indeed still red and almost round, a
“Ouch!” Harry couldn’t see him but by the thump noise he imagined Ron had hit his head on the underside of his bed.
“I guess that was the last of them.” Remus smiled tiredly.
“Besides, we know the dance is tomorrow and most people expect certain things to happen.”
“I will.” Harry gave a small smile and they both turned back to their homework. It certainly wasn’t too long before Harry lost his concentration and cautiously stared back at the darker boy. Harry could see why Jason would be attracted to Zabini. His darkened skin was smooth and the few pimple scars he had from their teenage years were almost invisible. Even though his eyes were rather cold-looking the light shining from the window lightened them into an almost hazel color.
“Could it be you are more upset for Mr. Malfoy than yourself?”
“Oh.” So that’s why Draco had seemed so distracted every time she had approached them.
Getting outside, the cold wind forced him to squint his eyes. Tightening his scarf around his neck, he left the Hogwarts entrance with the others and headed for the main gate. It wasn’t cold enough to snow yet, but frost had left a thin white layer over the grass. The frost crushed underneath their feet and the sound echoed. Pairs of feet could be heard from behind and walking a few meters in front of them. Harry hated the cold. While it was fun to sit inside and watch the snowfall, being outside left his hands freezing. He had unfortunately forgotten his gloves upstairs, so Harry buried them into his pockets, hoping to get them heated up. Finally, they had arrived at the gate entrance where the other students had gathered. Harry stood by his friends as he occasionally tried to discreetly look around for Malfoy. Had be perhaps forgotten?
“It’s time.” Professor Snape declared as the group looked towards the night sky. Six wizards arrived on brooms with a giant metal cage attached in the middle between them. As they landed a few feet away, Aodhan grew weary. He started tiptoeing around as if not fully understanding why the strangers were here.  Five men and two women, all dressed in leather landed and dismounted their brooms.
“What is it?”
“Professor, please, Aodhan isn’t dangerous-“
“Don’t you need to… drink? I know you eat food in the hall but aren’t you getting thirsty sometimes?”
“Oh, my little boy.” Hagrid blew his nose.
What could the Weasley possible have to do over here?
“OH, right!” Harry couldn’t help the nervous laugh. “I’ve been good. Schoolwork is going well. My friends… well most have been very supportive, but it has taken its toll on a few of the others.”
At last, the pleasure exploded and his legs buckled uncontrollably as he ran through the high. Draco franticly continued to grind against him a few more times before he too fell breathlessly against Harry. Trying to gain their breath, Harry gently started kissing him once again. It seemed different to kiss after one had sought gratification, he noticed. While it had been rough and pleasurable, it now seemed… wholesome.
“I heard what Knott said.” His grab on his own arms intensified. “Is it true?”
(See the end of the chapter for
When they arrived at the first house of Hogsmeade, the group of friends planed the day.
Lucius was still upset about the Dark lords falling. Of course, he was pleased that his family hadn’t suffered from his own selfish mistakes, but anyone who knew Lucius even a bit knew his pleasure and greed for power. His involvement in the war had left his indulgence for dark arts common knowledge, leaving the Malfoy’s with slightly harder options for trading and gathering favors. Even worse had it become when Lucius learned the truth about Severus own matters in the war. The fact that he openly sought pardon in the Ministry was more than enough for Lucius to turn away from him. Believing it was beneath them to seek any sort of forgiveness for their ‘own legal opinion’ was ludicrous in Lucius’ mind.
He had barely gotten out of his chair, intending to talk to Potter, before the dark voice from his godfather rang through the classroom.
“Finally! What the hell were you doing for so long?”
“There is another reason why I wanted him to supply me. It is one of the few excuses I have to talk to him.”
Releasing a shaky breath, Harry refused to cry once more. He nodded and quietly explained what had happened. How Malfoy had tricked him, used him for his own amusement. Through the story, Dean and Seamus continued to change expressions. The surprised raised eyebrows exchanged with a rather angry scowl. If Harry hadn’t been in so much pain right now, it would actually have been quite funny.
Seeing the gloomy look on his friend’s face, he continued;
She looked at him expectantly.
“Told you so.” He smirked.
“So what do you want to do?”
“Draco Malfoy?”
It almost felt unnatural directing it towards a Gryffindor, but he would have to start somewhere. At least this way, Potter couldn’t say anything stupid to piss him off as usual.
Professor Snape’s hand was still placed on his shoulder, but the man must have felt him shaking because he gently started to rub it in comfort.
Unfolding it, Hermione asked him whom it was from.
Laughing, Jason explained. “No, no, god no, he supplies me. I just have to go see him once in a while and have a cup- maybe two- and then I’m fine. Kind of like a blood bank.”
The leader shook hands with Dumbledore a final time, before climbing his own broom as well. Aodhan didn’t even flinch as the cage got off the ground. He was steadily asleep and would probably not wake before they were back in Africa. Harry continued crying silently as someone grabbed his hand. Draco had finally decided it was safe enough to step closer as the dragon was levitated into the cloudy air. His warm slender hand grabbed his tightly and Harry leaned against the shoulder. Whishing he could stop the crying before turning towards the professors once more.  In complete silence they watched the group turn smaller and smaller until they had disappeared into the night sky.
“It looks nice.” Before he turned away and moved to get something from his trunk.
“Wait, Severus.”
“What?” He turned back to his friend.
But no one caught them. They didn’t even have to hide at any given moment. Maybe the professors didn’t believe any of the students were senseless enough to break rules on the first week. Well, enter Harry Potter. Still, he questioned Malfoy’s intensions. What could he possibly have to discuss? It could be a ministry court problem. Harry wasn’t actually sure what had happened to the Malfoys’ except they had more or less been punished.
“Expensive?” Seamus snickered.
“My son…” He whispered, trying to comprehend the overwhelming feeling of love one could only have for a child of his own. They didn’t need to speak to feel the comfort of home from one another, and Snape just kept rocking the boy as he felt the wetness dripping down his shoulder, where Jason had buried his face.
“No, it just… you’re crazy, okay?! Draco loves me. I’m sorry he doesn’t want to marry you, but this is just out of line-“
“Zabini is gay or have you forgotten?”
“You’re right, sorry.” He took another sip of wine in defeat. Turning his attention to him, Draco looked at him before smiling coyly.
“No, I’m fine.”
Harry really didn’t care. He tried to remember what Dumbledore had said about unity. If he could befriend one Slytherin, then perhaps he could befriend another. He would definitely remain open minded.
He took a small sip from the scolding drink, enjoying the slight burn and bitter taste across his tongue. Beside him the joyful headmaster blew his own drink before slurping a taste.
“No way! That’s a lie.” Harry laughed.
Making out had been amazing every time, but Harry had gotten the feeling lately that Draco was ready for more. No matter how much he tried to leave it be, he knew for certainty that the blonde had already lost his virginity a long time ago, while Harry never really had the time to truly consider doing it with anyone, let alone someone he cared about.
The Black-haired girl looked amused but Draco wasn’t fooled. He had known Pansy for most of his life and he could recognize the smaller signs that she was feeling annoyed. Her mouth twitched ever so slightly and her eyes were getting stingy.
What Draco described as “some people” must have been his entire house of seventh year students. After changing circles for the third time, Harry stopped trying to remember their names. He had no idea how Draco could possibly have time to talk to everyone but then again if one only spent time with each five minutes, then it was quite possible.
“Size?”
“We shall discuss your punishment tomorrow but-“ As Dumbledore spoke a roaring green fire erupted from Madam Pomphrey’s fire pit and a resolved problem suddenly became an even bigger one, as Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy arrived with floo powder. The blond man looked as arrogant and angry as ever. His wife kept a more composed look but stood by her husband with her head held high.
“Gave it to Harry… he didn’t want it anymore.” He whispered sadly.
“Why are you sitting here now?”
Severus could feel another headache coming, as he tried to explain the situation.
“Mr. Malfoy, if you please-“
“Oh, right! Sorry.” Harry agreed. “Jason, these are my friends Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan-“ He introduced the boys as they shook hands and exchanged pleasantries. “-And this is Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.” The 2/3 parts of the golden trio only nodded their heads in acknowledgment. Trying to ignore the almost touching-awkwardness their cold greeting had created; Harry hurried and asked the group to head for the breakfast hall.
“I suppose.” Theo drank the last of his glass, as did Draco.
Sitting down again after taking a walk around the infirmary, Blaise carefully used a finger to feel down Jason’s face. The second he actually felt the cracks beneath his fingers, he almost screamed. Removing his fingers quickly he watched as part of Jason’s dusty skin was stuck on him. He had to slowly harshly as bill arose in his throat. Leaning across his face, watching where his fingers had dug into the love of his life, sweeping away his beauty, Blaise wept. The tears rolled down his face, leaving his cheeks wet and clammy.
“Fine enough. You?”
At the end of last class, the gang waited for Luna to join at the entrance. The four boys had grabbed all their warm clothing, gloves and hats, making sure they could stay outside without freezing to death. Between all the students wandering around, Harry could finally see a platinum blonde head poking up. He waved a hand waiting for her to get close enough to notice.
“Wait, Harry!” Hermione had followed him and breathlessly chased him up the stairway.
Standing in the receiving line along the others, all he needed now was his diploma. The students of the seventh year at Hogwarts were standing in their black robes, waiting for their ending as well as their new beginning. The sun was beaming through the great hall’s windows, leaving the students and faculty members slightly sweaty. The entire great hall had been expanded and families were gathered on benches in the back, excitingly chattering amongst each other as everyone waited for the ceremony to begin.
“Still…” Harry said doubtingly.
“Where are you going, if I may ask?” Damn the smirking bastard for not feeling embarrassed at all.
“Listen-“
“Maybe you can still find him. He is probably in one of the Slytherin compartments up front.”
“Potter?”
“Yes, hi.” Blaise answered tightlipped.
See you next chapter,
“I don’t believe we have to go all the way to the boulder, let’s sit by the oak tree over there.” Malfoy said, pointing to a dark tree still fresh with orange leaves. It was far easier than going all the way to the boulder and sitting by the lake, as Harry was certain there would be no isolation from the wind. He nodded and sat up a hurried pace to reach the tree quickly.
His eye caught a rattling between two of his students. Ah, Mr. Melck and Zabini were at it again. How the tan boy had ever been put in Slytherin, he could only wonder. He was certainly intelligent enough, but he showed too much emotion from the huge smiles he sent to every person. One boy had certainly caught his affection, however unwanted it was.
“I see.”
“Sit.” Snape guided him to the couch, where he was provided with a woollen blanket. Sniffling and discreetly trying to dry his face, Harry pulled the blanket around him, first now feeling the cold. Snape sat down in the chair beside him. “Tammy!”
He also ignored that one of the reasons Wednesday was his favourite day was because it was Draco’s day.
“Working hard?”
“It’s a wave.” Harry replied, in defensive mode. There was something in Take that, even though their age difference was only a couple of years, made Harry feel like a child.
Harry was so happy he could barely stop smiling.
Harry blinked slowly at the arrangement of dahlias he was working on, then blinked again and raised his eyes to look at his coworker. He only managed to see the top of her head, since Laura was sitting on the floor behind a row of turquoise orchids, eating a tuna sandwich.
“Sod off, I’m on my break.”
It was nice. It was good. Harry never thought he would like to have Draco Malfoy in his life, but well, he did. And, ok, he had a crush, but he knew how to deal with that. He was already dealing with that the past few years, things didn’t have to change. It didn’t matter if he had a boyfriend, Harry didn’t want him for himself, he just wanted to keep him in his life, with his sassy remarks and snarky comebacks, keep hearing his rants and tales, keep track of his weird sense of humour.
“Can’t win every battle.”
He was there when Neville voiced his fears about not being able to care for two shops. Augusta had answered him with “give this useless boy a goddamn job”, always a no bullshit kind of woman.
“Exactly. You know how your name comes from the stars? Her name is a flower.”
“Will she like it?”
“He has this effect on people, you get used to it.” He lowered his hands to keep helping Scorpius eat, and Harry could see he was red in the face.
So the greenhouse it was.
He didn’t have anything with Draco, they were barely friends, he had absolutely no right to feel jealous or to intrude in his life. This was not who he wanted to be.
Draco spied from between his fingers.
“Hey, baby.” Draco called him, very soft, and Harry held the edges of the bathtub with more strength than necessary. “It’s okay, they’re daddy’s friends. Can he come here?” He asked Neville, who answered with a small head shake. “Where’s Take? Can you bring him here?”
That made Draco roll his eyes.
“Are you sure you don’t want another sleepover? We can build another fort! Or a farm! Do you think we can build a place big enough for an elephant?”
“You’re doing a great job.” Draco said, looking him in the eyes, and Harry was so used to stealing glances that this one felt very intimate. He was more naked now then when they were in the bathtub.
“Sir, are you trying to tell me Malfoy has truly changed?”
“Would you like something sweet, dear?”
“Why?” she demanded with narrowed eyes, looking directly into his. Harry could see why such a person would be in Slytherin. She wasn’t scared to stand up for her house. But still, he was three years older and basically towering up over her. Hating to do exploit himself as a bully, but hating even more having to answer her question, Harry invaded her personal space, looking down at her.
Coughing, trying to find his voice, Harry turned to Knott.
Suddenly the tree door crept open and Madam Pomphrey nodded for him to join them. Trying not to wince, Harry sprung up and quietly followed.
When they reached the Quidditch pitch gates, they were not only very early but the Slytherin had been having DADA with the Hufflepuffs and wouldn’t arrive for at least another five minutes. The Gryffindor group just sat down on the cold stone benches and chatted. Hermione had brought a book she enlarged after grabbing it from her inner robe pocket. While Luna asked many wonderous questions on Herbology – which usually only had something to do with plants no one had ever heard of - , the boys discussed the safe topic of Quidditch, compared to the muggle sport football.
Fall had seemed to go by quickly and before Harry had realized it, Halloween had passed. While outside the weather had gone from cold to almost freezing, Harry had felt incredibly warm inside the castle. He, Jason, Zabini and Malfoy continued to meet in the library even after their assignment was handed over.  His friendship with Ron and Hermione were still strained a bit and Harry tried to give them some space.
“Don’t worry little brother,” The twins joined them at the door. “Harry’s got everything he needs, already.”
“I don’t understand, what wasn’t real?” Hermione didn’t wish to make any assumption.
“Well, Weasley, doesn’t she look nice?”
Now sitting at the breakfast table, he carefully tugged on his sleeves to get them over his hands. He was still rather chilly even though the cold had gone down. He was already drinking and eating only hot items. Warm tea with honey, oatmeal with raisins and bananas and he was eyeing a very good-looking muffin if he had any more room afterwards.
“Because no one can know! If anyone found out about our relation it could have horrible conse-“
(See the end of the chapter for
The walked together for the remaining length and entered the cozy room of Remus entrance. Remus quickly made them some tea and some crullers. They were still slightly warm and Harry imagined they had been delivered by the kitchen.
Yes, things would be okay. All he had to do was stick with the plan.
“Oh don’t worry, we won’t stay for long, just getting in quickly to give them the presents.”
“Students and teachers,” he addressed. “A wonderful first half of the year at Hogwarts, has gone by. As exciting and eventful this has been, let us wish for an even bigger surprise in the next.”
“It was.” Harry answered short.
“Get in.” Snape’s voice boomed.
Harry blushed. “Sorry, my blood circulation isn’t exactly the best.” He shrugged.
“Thanks.” Harry just said rather stumped.
Oh, how delicious was the pink colour spreading across the virgin’s face.
Lupin had the audacity to snort and seemed to let go of the foolish nonsense of getting him to talk about their previous attachment.
Slowly but steady their shirts were pulled off and thrown somewhere on the floor. Draco slowly kissed his way down the smooth chest and his tongue circled Harry’s nipples. Harry desperately tried to keep his eyes open to watch the erotic picture of Draco sucking on his nipples. Seeing the red tongue trail over his own chest while leaving a warm trail across it, he couldn’t help but lift his upper body seeking more.
Reality hit him on the head, harder than any smasher could and he moved his head away from the taller teen.
“It wasn’t so bad.”
After only a few minutes, his thoughts started drifting. Looking aside in boredom he noticed Blaise was doodling. Beside his notes, he drew a small man from the side, one hand in the air, another holding something by the hip. Another doodle was drawn beside it and Draco couldn’t help the snort leaving him as he realized it was two guys dancing together. Hearing the snort, Blaise quickly hid the note underneath the rest of his parchments and turned a rather deadly glare his direction.
“What in Merlin’s name? Mr. Weasley immediately release Mr. Malfoy!” The highpitched voice of Professor Flitwick stopped everyone in their track. Ron finally let go of the green robes held in his fists. For the first time today, Harry got eye contact with the course of his heartache. Not able to deal with things right now, Harry escaped between the curious students and left.
“Which one?”
Weasel? Why would I be interested in watching you beg others for pocket change?”
Why was this man in any way interested in him? He didn’t even know Severus.
“I am also what, Mr. Potter?”
“I hope I can wait that long, because seeing you in that suit, is making mine tighter.” As if the words weren’t more than enough to make his stomach knot in arousal, Draco pulled at his earlobe with his teeth for just a second.
Moving further he left his nipples and imagined Draco looking at him, lying there underneath him. His hands teasingly followed his toned abs, which mostly tickled, and he found himself starting to breathe even harder. He was almost at his wits end, but he wanted to explore himself a little more first. Grabbing the natural soap, he covered his fingers and started following his crack. He rubbed a single digit between his cheeks and constantly went over his hole without actually breaching it. Every time he touched it, it would tense up in anticipation. Not able to wait anymore he moaned as he teased the opening and quickly took an entire finger up until his knuckle. The position was slightly hard to reach around but it also felt really good, still thinking it was Draco’s fingers and not his own.
“-BUT if it had and Aodhan had been too late? Who could possibly imagine what could have happened? What if the spider had killed you and Aodhan had hit you trying to protect ye? The entire wizarding world would have been after the head of whoever they thought had hurt ye. Aodhan could have gotten into a lot of trouble, he could, and I would never forgive me’self if I thought I was the cause of you getting hurt.”
“Draco…”
“Push back against me. Just like before.”
“I thought you were friends?”
Everything seemed to slow done for a long time. Everyone looked at Malfoy, waiting for his answer. Because whatever he said next, would have to be followed up, not only by his father but by the schoolboard as well. After watching Malfoy looking slightly dumbstruck, the Headmaster came to his rescue.
“-Besides, I imagine the dungeon isn’t the most tempting place for you at the moment.”
“Hi.”
“Wow, really? That’s so great!” He smiled brightly. Would he ever get the chance to tell Draco that? He wasn’t in love with Draco yet. He really liked him a lot and could see himself fall in love, but it seemed difficult. Harry had never told anyone he loved them. Not one person. He had loved Sirius as a father but he never had the chance to tell him that before it was too late.
“Yeah, but I used them up on notes.” Seeing the derisive look on all his friends faces, the slightly buffed boy blushed and mumbled. “I spilt ink and sat on it, okay.”
It was only the first day of school, but Harry already felt exhausted. Having barely slept, being woken up by Hermione dragging of his covers, wasn’t pleasant for any of the boys. After forcing himself to eat a piece of toast and sip a few mouthfuls of pumpkinjuice, the golden trio continued their morning in Charms. Harry felt uneasy walking up the stairs. The tiny bites of bread he had been able to keep down, churned in his stomach. Wishing so badly he could go back to his warm bed, the trio got in line to the classroom. Some of the Slytherin pushed a few Gryffindors aside to get through.
Snape didn’t speak again.
‘Merlin Lauris, how I wish you were here with me now.’ How long had it been since he had truly missed the beautiful man? He missed his company every so often, but it had been years since he truly felt the impact Lauris had had on his life. The aching in his heart had increased since he had learned of his son’s existence.
“What are the rules?” Theodore asked curiously, his book completely forgotten now.
“Wow, dude you look dead.”
“It wasn’t-“
“You had no right to tell others!”
Harry had finally agreed to leave the books behind and have a date. Even though they couldn’t leave the castle, Draco simply wanted to talk to him alone and perhaps cob a field.
“Your eyes-“ Harry quickly stopped himself from blurting out. Feeling the blood rush to his cheeks, he felt grateful when the Australian boy just laughed heartfully.
“It’ll be fine, ‘arry.” Hagrid drank the last of his tea and reached for a cookie. “Besides, he had nowhere to go. The Peruvian vippertooths’ aren’t supposed to leave the country. If anyone else gets a hold of this, Charlie could lose his job and in worst case be charged for felony. It will be fine…” Harry wasn’t sure which one of them Hagrid was trying to convince.
“Charms. I didn’t read the entire chapter we were supposed to, so I’m kinda’ hopping I can sit in the back.” Harry laughed. Jason joined in and for a while they walked in comfortable silence. They walked through the smaller doorless gate, heading towards the great lake.
Harry didn’t say a thing. Afraid if he spoke, the illusion would fade.
“Uptight?” Seamus finished.
“After you, your highness. Let’s see your awaiting commoner princess.” Draco rolled his eyes at her tacky act and made to walk out the door. But as faith would have it that day, Draco accidently slipped on a candy wrapper from Crabbe or Goyle, moist with leftover chocolate. Slipping through the opened door, the Slytherins were left, watching their so-called leader comically sliding out on one leg.
HP POV
Jason reassured her he would drop by if any pain should come his way and Harry eagerly nodded along beside him. To be frank, he couldn’t wait to come back to class. The infirmary always reminded him of all the times Voldemort had dragged him into trouble and how he always woke up here afterwards. So the boys quietly got dressed and left. On the way to the next class, Harry kept asking questions about his and Snape’s relation.
“What were you two talking about?” Normally such a question would have been asked out of simply curiosity, but knowing Hermione, Harry decided to ignore her, as it would only lead them into a new discussion. Instead, he said ‘hello’ and sat down on the other side of Neville, picking up a ham and cheese sandwich as he did.  Neville with a face full of chicken asked what was going on. Smiling at the teen, Harry told him about him and Draco going to the dance together. Again, he chose to ignore the strong-willed girl on his right as he clearly heard the scoffed voice; “-Still won’t listen to reason…”
Shit. “Nothing, sorry I was thinking of something else.” Harry hurried to move on but it was obvious Snape had caught the end of something big as his eyes narrowed. Getting up slowly from his own chair, he went around the desk.
They had almost reached the hidden entrance when, once again, Harry was pushed to the ground. Unlike the first, he really hit the floor this time and Harry’s glasses flew off his face.
“So you never?---“ Harry tried asking.
“As he said, his name is Jason. Don’t you like him?”
“Look at me.”
“Of course, sir.” Harry smiled back.
The insinuation that Draco and he would be together even after Hogwarts sent his heart soaring.
As they slowly let each other go, Draco cleaned them with his wand. After readjusting their clothes the slid down against the stone wall. They kissed one last time.   “That was… wow.” Draco chuckled at his moronic sentence.  “Hey, about that dance,”
“’Not my fault your hands are gigantic.” Harry smirked.
And it was certainly one of them.
Jason couldn’t help the escaped laughter. Harry imagined the look on his face must have been rather amusing.
“Hey.”
At Harry’s obvious distraught expression, he quickly reassured the poor boy.
“I don’t know, I just thought you laid a piece of paper with your name on it and that was that.” Malfoy quickly stepped aside to avoid the flying fist heading for his arm. As Harry continued to miss, Malfoy hurried towards the gryffindor commonroom. Laughing the smaller teen chased the annoying pretty boy. As they slowed down, Malfoy grabbed his hand once again.
“But he is alive; maybe he needs a little help?” Harry tried hopeful. Hagrid shook his head silently.
“Apologies to Hermione. For calling her a mudblood.” Harry explained.
The entire trip from the tower to the owlery was almost too easy. He only passed by two ghost and not a teacher in sight on the map. Perhaps none of the elders expected the student to be out of bed already seeing that it was the first night back and most had seemed so tired at dinner. Checking to make certain before he left the hall, he noticed McGonagall’s dot lying still, so did Pomphrey, Lupin and Flitwick… Professor Dumbledore was wandering around in his office and Snape was in his private quarters, also restless.
“Hey, you looked a little distressed in there, are you alright?”
“Yeah… I just couldn’t sleep.” Harry lied. “Really.” He said, trying to assure his good friend.
Dear Merlin, this day was really getting annoying; Harry thought, massaging his tired temple.
But hoping everything was just as always was clearly too much to ask for. Harry had barely stepped away from the staircase before the common room became deadly silent. A few gryffindor-girls gave him encouraging smiles, while most gave him looks of an odd combination between pity and curiosity. Although a rare few only could be described as… disgust.
“Yes, he did.” Rems smiled sadly.
Getting close enough Draco held out his arms, waiting.
Waiting for Harry to let him in.
“Sorry, the portrait said he knew who I was.” Snape sent the front door a disapproving glance before nodding the boy inside. Sitting down on the black older couch, Jason tried to give him a careful smile.
“It’s fine.” Malfoy shrugged. “I honestly hadn’t thought of it either. Just as long as they keep quiet about it.”
“Nasty business, Mr. Potter. It always is in these cases…” Madam Pomphrey whispered. “Haven’t been part of one since my internship…”
“It’s fine.” Malfoy grinned. “She’s just annoying.”
Harry was scooping up the last of his chocolate mousse, when he heard Draco whisper;
“Sit down.”
Harry went a bit forward and caught the eyes of Remus whom was desperately trying to turn down Hagrid’s generous offer of mere mead in his golden cup. Hagrid had apparently had a few as his large face had gotten pretty flushed and his already booming voice had risen to another level. Nodding discreetly to the Professor, Harry left to gather his presents for tonight. Jason’s and his plan had to be put into action and they would need to be on their best behaviour if they should have any chance of getting the two adults in the same room. Remus wouldn’t be a problem, but Snape would definitely refuse to corporate without causing an uproar. Hopefully, Jason’s presence there and his wish to spend Christmas with his father would mellow the older man. At least for tonight.
“Draco Malfoy.”
“Well, while I was rather nervous and uncertain of Severus’ intention. We once again met in the library the following week. I think perhaps Severus’ expected me to have told everyone in Gryffindor but since I hadn’t… he took it as a sign.” Remus’ otherwise pale cheeks slightly rouged. “This time as we were about to leave, I kissed him instead.”
Hagrid gave a throaty laugh behind him.
“Yes, you told me Voldemort had sent you on a mission in another part of the world.”
Thank you to everyone liking the story and especially the two people who have commented. I really appreciate it !
“Nah, Neville and I are just getting them altered.”
Trying not to let it bother him that Malfoy was discussing him with the Slytherins he kept a straight face and tried to seem bored.
“Erhm.. Hagrid?”
“And how would I know this?”
“Are you certain about Mr. Malfoy?”
Zabini coughed a tad awkwardly. “Potter, have you had dinner or were you heading?”
Besides, he had to swing by to give Hagrid his present.
“I don’t want to go.” Hating how much like a child he sounded, Harry stuck to it. He didn’t feel like seeing his friends right now. Didn’t feel like discussing his whereabouts last night. And he certainly didn’t feel like looking at the smirking asshole to an ex-boyfriend.
“I won’t hurt you, I promise.” Draco laid down beside him and swiftly pulled Harry along, on top of him. “Why don’t you start?” ever the evil serpent, he grinned as Harry seemed even more nervous now. Lying down on top of the blond, Harry scooched down until he was a few inches from his crotch.
“So Potter, I suppose the disposition of you ‘doing better’ isn’t as well-evolved as planned?” Snape leaned back and crossed his arms.
The Professor carelessly waved a hand at his thank, but Remus was still smiling even when Jason rolled his eyes at his father. Remus picked up the goblet and hurried to drink the –probably still disgusting tasting- potion. By the irked grimace, Harry was certain he was right about the taste. The obsidian eyes from the other side of the table followed Remus’ moves and even though Harry could barely see the difference expressions, it seemed as though Snape was satisfied in the trust of Remus drinking the potion without question.
“I know, but I promised we would hang out.” Draco gave him an apologetic kiss on the cheek. “Sorry babe.”
“I hate seeing him like this.”
“What…. makes you believe I have travelled?”
“To new friends- and relationships. In the darkest of night and the brightest of day, may they continue to blossom.” Blaise seemed to mellow at the beautiful words and shared a rare smile with his friends as they cheered and clinked glasses with their neighbors.
“Nah, this?” Malfoy tried to smirk, but it was obvious even that was hurting him. “I tried worse.”
“Night.” Harry tried to calm his breathing and forced himself to move towards the Fat Lady.
How badly Harry wanted to play it cool and give of a sarcastic remark. But as fate would have given him delicate senses, his pumping pulse indicated the blossoming red patched across his cheeks.
“You must realize soon that I cannot keep protecting you.” Severus chastised and started pacing. “You have already proved yourself capable of deliberately hurting another student violently-“
Relaxing, Harry felt the tension leave him in the comfortable silence. In it, Malfoy had stopped picking the grass.
“Can you see it?” Hagrid asked excitedly.
“Have you noticed any changes in Malfoy?”
Suddenly Harry noticed a figure behind Jason moving closer. A rather intimidating glare pierced his eyes. The person turned out to be a boy from Slytherin whom Harry had seen hanging out with Malfoy. Something-Zabini, Harry remembered. Moving closer rather quickly, Zabini seemed to stare intensely at the back of Jason’s head.
“I don’t
“Aodhan is grown enough to take care of himself now, Hagrid, we both know he is.” Dumbledore calmly reminded him. The giant dried his tears but his red eyes puffed out like golf balls.  Harry couldn’t believe it. He knew that Aodhan would have to go, but so soon? He had barely grown considering how big the peruvian vippertooths’ usually were. How far away would he have to go? Dreading the answer, Harry didn’t protest any further but already felt the need to grief his friend’s departure. Aodhan had become such a big part of him, even though they hadn’t really spent that much time together or had known each that long, Harry had watched him grow from a puppy sized runt to the giant elephant chasing birds. He had watched him hatch, for Merlin sake! And now he was never going to see him again.
“So, how are you and Malfoy doing?”
“Yeah, I guess.” Colin sulked. “Oh! Sorry, Harry this is Esben. He is in same year as me.” he introduced the boy. Esben shot out a hand and grabbed Harry’s in greeting.
He knew Draco was teasing him - mocking him, even- but his voice was like whispered warm sun across his cheeks and he could barely control himself from sucking the life out of him. The way Draco was looking at him made him feel safe, excited and slightly nervous.  Finally, after what felt like a hundredth years too long, Draco leaned in to kiss him. It was barely a flutter across his lips so Harry leaned up, searching for the lips to deepen the kiss. Their lips moved gently against each other, dancing together.
“Why not? How much how you written?” Zabini seemed interested.
For a long time, they were both stuck in their own minds, contemplating what to do. Jason was still sleeping lifelessly, only his tiny shallow breathing made him seem alive. But Harry couldn’t let him die like this. Even if that stubborn git Zabini refused, Harry would kick his ass and drag him back up the stairs. Deciding that action was the best way to restore what could be saved, Harry determined rose.
“Severus, please come.” His tone of voice was seductive and less likely to leave him arguable.
“I don’t know what you are talking about Professor.”
HP POV
“WHAT! How dare you?”
“I see.” Snape sat up straighter, getting the feeling Mr. Melck had something rather serious on his mind.  “What did you wish to discuss?”
“If you say so. But a tiny piece of advice; you might want to start to call them by their actual names, if Potter is supposed to believe you’ve actually changed at all.”
Malfoy shook his head. “He didn’t, not really. He didn’t even look at me before casting a spell on the giraffe. It got hot and I let it fall to the floor, watching as it burned to ashes.”
Harry smiled. “Yeah, I suppose.” Hoping it was enough to prove he wasn’t mad anymore. If Malfoy could see anything in this dark. Apparently he did, because he sounded almost relieved when he asked;
“…Is this really about today?”
Being used to Lunas weird antics he waited for her to explain.
“Severus… I’m sorry, I have to go.”
“We’re casual?” He fumed. “Oh well, since we’re ‘casual’ then perhaps I should go with someone else, but yeah sure, we can ‘
“Professor.” Harry smiled as he approached the older man.
“You seem happy.” Harry noted.
The line seemed unbelievable cheesy, but Severus wasn’t about to mention it anytime soon.
“Yeah, the Dursleys’ doesn’t really do vacations. They don’t appreciate any culture where there might be different food or music so, yeah… They never leave their house too long at a time.” Harry played with a button on his robe. He felt slightly silly to have never left the UK, but without being a qualified adult and able to do magic outside of school, it wasn’t really as though he had much of a chance.
Yes, everything did truly seem harmonic. Harry was adoringly in love with him, classes were going great – therefor the exams would be easy- and he had won the bet. True, he did feel slightly bad whenever some of the Slytherin brought up the subject and yes, something tore into his stomach every time Harry mentioned their first few dates, but it didn’t matter anymore; The guilt would surely end at some point.
The two boys weren’t exactly interested any longer and only gave him a quick glance before nodding along.
The long parchment was the one, Jason and he had been working on so far in class. But now it was filled with scribbles, crossed out phrases and newly joined notes written on top and on the sides. Inspecting it, he found the words ‘ridiculous’ and ‘Not like that’, on more than a few pages. Harry couldn’t help the small chuckle that escaped him as he was reminded of the book of the half-blood prince.
Collecting his thoughts, he heard the sound of muffled snickering and turned to glare at his friends. Watching as Dean was keeping a hand over Seamus mouth as he continued to shake with laughter.
“And you don’t find that strange?”
Lost in thoughts the scheming boy almost jumped when his best friend and Pansy sat down beside him.
“It wasn’t real. Any of it.” Harry looked to the floor. “Malfoy was just bored, I guess.” Laughing at his own stupidity, he answered their unasked question. “It was a bet. That’s why. Yeah… So we’re not together anymore. He never really wanted me-“
Before Hagrid could finish, a strangled croak sounded and something very hard bumped into his head. Harry quickly turned as his head started pounding and he found himself with a handful of dragon. Smiling, he held the youngster close, as it cuddled against his face. Aodhan had grown crazily fast and Harry could barely hold him before his arm muscles started aching. Sitting down on a larger wooden chair, he placed Aodhan in his lap.
As the door closed behind the last student, he turned to glare at his godfather.
“I’m not mad; I just wanted to know what happened.”
“Oh, look at them.” Hermione gasped behind him. Now Harry was also able to see the astounding sight to behold. It seemed as if the students were awed by the enticing view of white shimmering unicorns spread over the small patch in between the forest and them. Loosely tied to tree poles, they stood, gently swaying back and forth. While some seemed to simply ignore the teenagers, others became curios enough to walk a few steps forward, staring at them before taking a few steps back again. A calming sense flowed through Harry as he stood by, watching. The last time he had seen a unicorn it had laid dead right in front of him, the beautiful white coat had seemed grey and faltering.
SS POV
“This still doesn’t explain why he told you about my… preference.”
Looking at the heated glance he gave him, Jason felt his determination falter. Leaning down with a smile he started kissing him again, feeling the push as Blaise’s elbows gave out, and landing them back in the snow. As they had bare stopped, the kiss heated quickly and Jason licked his thin over lip, gaining access to his warm mouth. As their tongues met, Jason swore he could see bright colors shining on the inside of his eyelids. Blaise hands stroked his cheeks and down his shoulders, holding him close.
“Ouch! … well yes…” Ron clustered his stomach. “Just… wow.”
“I am definitely getting new ones. Maybe with some real gold cufflinks to match.” Dean smiled charmingly.  Seamus shoved him teasingly. “Show off.”  The group of friends laughed and continued their day.
But Jason merely dodged the hand and continued to stare into nothing.
Blaise didn’t answer, but seemed to accept his conclusion anyway. Jason only waited for the group to walk a few more meters ahead before letting Blaise move. At least so far, so he was able to walk without being bothered by their joined hands.
“Death is part of life. Unfortunately, it greets some quicker than others.” He discreetly wiped his eyes with the white cotton sleeve of his pajamas. “I always thought it was exaggerated, when people in movies or books said they missed their loved ones every day, but it’s true… every single day. I recognize a smell that would take me back home. Listens to a song or a joke he would have liked. Every single day something reminds me the pain of losing and the love of having known him.”
Clearly not hearing right, Draco sat, staring at her, gaping.
“Oh god, Bluejay…” he cried as his fingers moved along the heavy dark eyelids.
“As you know, I’m from Australia. I’ve lived there my whole life, never even left the country. Being born in Sydney leaves you with more than enough adventure to last a lifetime, but I never truly felt…home.” Jason scratched an invisible spot on his covet.
“We don’t need to bring up such painful memories. No matter how it went, I still abandoned him and his father. Why should I wish to discuss such difficulties? No, we will focus on the present where I will help him become a spectacular wizard.”
“Why on earth would that matter now? Beside if you keep fooling around like a child it won’t be long before you’re not a student anymore!” Severus sneered at the childish argument.
“You don’t say. Sorry just doesn’t fix everything.” Chuckling brokenly, Jason finally looked at him. “I need some time alone.” No, that wouldn’t make things better.
Okay, new plan.
Maybe it was because Potter was wearing one of his belongings.
Looking at the teachers table he noticed most of the adults looked genuinely excited, only one kept his face from looking like he swallowed a lemon whole. Snape seemed angrier than usual and looking back to their new Dark Arts professor, Harry had a feeling it had nothing to do with the Christmas ball.
“Right now? Couldn’t it have waited till after dinner?” Neville asked intrigued.
Ron looked positively green and the idea of thanking Malfoy for anything.
“So much! Please, please, Draco. Fuck me! Now!” he pushed a hand back fumblingly trying to grab the cock and push it in, himself.
“Good, good.” He said with childish glee. “And there was the tea, thank you, Mist.” He reached to take the tray from the smaller creature holding it over his head. When the elf was certain the headmaster wouldn’t spill anything, he bowed and vanished once more.
“Yeah, Hermione is usually very honest.”
Besides, his parents were happy, Pansy was happy, and their fellow purebloods had seemed pleased by the match, so why should he be the only one to complain. Besides, it didn’t really matter. If it wasn’t Pansy, it would be someone else, so why spend anymore fuss. He didn’t even want to think about how much money his parents and the Parkinsons had spent on this ceremony.
Dean and Seamus had gotten him a new broom-fixer set, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had made a new sweater for him, even though he could still fit the one from last year, he was grateful. Hagrid, Dumbledore, Hermione and the Weasley twins had all gotten him rather thoughtful and personal gifts, but as he got through the pile, his heart started clenching. Fewer and fewer presents were left before Harry realized Ron hadn’t gotten him one. He knew perfectly well that Ron didn’t have as much money as him and he should feel offended that he had gotten his girlfriend one instead of him. Yes, it was obviously just a money problem… nothing else.
“Of course, Dumbledore.” McGonagall answered, while Snape gave a tiny nod.
“Oh.” Blaise wasn’t exactly a huge fan of emotions and he was really not comfortable seeing his best friend crying out loud. What was there to say? Surely if Potter knew everything, he wouldn’t forgive Draco in any case. Their relationship had already been quite rocky since the beginning. Realizing Draco had lied to him all along…  Potter had more pride than that.
“Oh okay, then sure.” Harry blushed. A little embarrassed now that he had reacted so hastily.
So far, the only things he had seen was Mr. Knott and Mr. Fern getting wasted on sherry and getting them coffee and pastries. They did indeed have a houseelf but no, apparently, this was a job fit for his ‘stature’ as Mr. Fern had gladly pointed out at the dinner table.
Sitting back down the Professor took a minute to answer.
Lying for a second in self-pity was enough for the rest of his emotions to catch on.
“Oh.” Blaise wasn’t sure how to address their painful break up. It still lingered somewhere deeply buried. “For what it’s worth; I really am sorry how things turned out. I never meant to lie to you. Especially not to hurt you.”
Zabini laughed and picked up a book from the stack on the floor, beside him.
“Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, why aren’t you getting ready for class?”
Harry really hoped the two boys would keep it to themselves. Seeing the two faces of his friends so excited on his behalf, he took a deep breath before barely whispering;
Looking ahead on the headboard, he felt the bed dip as Draco moved closer to him. Harry tried his best to relax and enjoy because his erection had certainly not wilted. A hand moved over his ass and the gentle motion almost tickled. Then, it grabbed on and Harry moaned as the hand roughly massaged his cheek.
Malfoy sighed deeply. He looked away from him and kept his eyes on the dark forest in front of them. Harry looked away as well, realizing it was easier for both of them to talk this way. After five years with the Slytherin boy, Harry had learned a few things, watching from afar. Malfoy was a stubborn creature. Everything beside glory and material matters were difficult for him to speak of. Pushing him wouldn’t give him any answers. Harry wasn’t sure how long they sat beside each other just looking at the forest. The wind moved the tress as if they were dancing. Shadows shaped by the light, shinning from the moon, made the illusion of a waving sea across the land.
“Just for once in your life, Malfoy, tell me the truth. Did you -when you started this this whole charade- ever think of the way it could have affected me?”
Harry had been unfocused for the last half hour, rereading the same page over and over again. He couldn’t help but wonder if Jason was upset with him. He couldn’t  imagine a reason why, but remembering how horrible he had handled Cho Chang’s grief, he realized it was probably time to ask.
No such luck, huh Merlin?
“What Ron means is-“ Hermione interjected before someone drew their wand. “Why Malfoy is suddenly concerned with you? He would not tell us anything and Madam Pomphrey cannot make him leave unless a teacher or you tell him to first.”
“I should get going, I have to go all the way up to the tower for Divination.” Waving goodbye, Harry turned and tried his hardest to pull his facemuscles into a natural looking façade, instead of that ridiculously happy smile he knew was covering it.
“It’s me. Easy.”
He gasped the second something wet touch his opening.
“Mr. Malfoy I believe it is time for you to head for the common room. Mr. Potter needs to rest.” She said strictly and they knew it wasn’t simply a suggestion. In a gentler voice, she reminded Zabini as well, and the two Slytherins left together. But not before Malfoy leaned close to steal a last kiss and whisper; ‘We need to talk.’
The day of the final exam in Defence Against Dark Arts had arrived. They had already taken the written exam so there was only the oral exam left. Seventh year students were gathered outside in the steaming hallway, waiting for their name to be called forth. Dean and Seamus had already been up, both more than happy to receive two E’s. Hermione was inside the stuffy rom right now and nothing could be heard from within.
“Harry, we are so glad you’re awake. How are you feeling?” Hermione came closer and sat down on the other side of his bed.
Sending the boys along with five point drawn from Gryffindor, Severus couldn’t help but speculate the idea of his godson speaking to Potter without brawling. About to follow the boys down to the crypt, Severus stepped on something crunchy.
“Really?” Draco couldn’t help the surprise in his voice.
“No, but-“
“Harry, why are you so tired? You went to bed long before any of us.” Neville asked worried. Harry smiled after he finished grimacing at the bitter taste of black coffee.
A happier smile subtly replaced the darkened face, and Harry could again recognize the illuminating boy.
“So Draco, have you thought about next summer?”
“Probably not.” Luna agreed. “Who knows? Maybe she hoped he felt the same as she did; That the risk was well worth the outcome. Perhaps he would see she had only done it out of love even if he didn’t agree with her plan.”
Barely able to breath, Harry wished it would never end. His whole body shivered as he neared completion. The roaring fire in his stomach continued and started centering in his abdomen.
“Oh. Erm, not so much but I did agree to go out with him. Is that okay?” Harry asked uncertain.
Draco obviously didn’t believe he had heard right because the man simply stared at him.
Slowly they ventured into the less crowded streets and, houses and apartments replaced the shops. Only a few locals were sitting on a three-step staircase having a smoke. Beside them, the street was empty.
Harry looked further into the room while Snape was pacing back and forth. In a chair in front of Madam Pomphrey’s desk sat Jason, his head hanging down, looking very stubbornly at the ground. Beside him, Blaise Zabini sat, almost mushed up against him, holding a single of Jason’s hand between his own two. While Jason looked ashamed and hurt, Zabini was looking very steadily at Professor Snape, daring him to comment on their seating arrangement.
Casting an awkward glance at his friend, Harry hurried to raise his shoulders in a non-caring manner. Neville smiled gratefully and hurried to engage the younger girl in small talk, probably hoping she wouldn’t take notice of her ex.
Looking up from is frozen hands, Seamus seemed honest when he suggested they should stay with him.
“You seem… upset.”
“I’m fine, just a little tired from the festivity.”
Hagrid gave him a sympatric look. “I don’t know, Harry.”
The younger teen pleaded him for a few more minutes, before Remus finally caved. Excited, the boy gathered all the presents and before Remus could comment on the fact that he had gathered his own as well, he ran out the door. Hearing the Professor’s sound footsteps behind him, he continued towards the dungeon.
Harry eat, slowly. He wasn’t really that hungry to begin with. He had had a lot to think about the last couple of months and tonight he felt the unpleasant darkness in his heart that arrived with loneliness. He wasn’t alone, deep down, he knew that. Harry had many friends and people he felt close to, but when it was just one certain person you wanted to speak to, others seemed to pale in comparison. He gulped down the last bite with some water and told the others he was going back to the common room. The gang nodded absently and turned back to their conversation.
“Ignore her. It’s me, not you.” Draco comforted him quietly. Harry nodded his understanding and tried to ignore the gnawing feeling inside his stomach. Draco continued speaking to his friends, while Harry simply listened. That was until Theodore Knott raised his glass and offered the Gryffindor a taste.
That was surprising. “Why?”
Once again, Lauris handed him the bottle but after a few swallows, Severus refused.
Severus didn’t answer him, but simply picked up his cup of tea blowing slightly before mumbling;
“No thanks, I’m good.”
“Yes, Mr. Potter, but unfortunately you must quickly get used to the fact that friendship changes over the years, particularly when you are teenagers and that it indeed,
HP POV
“Thanks.” Harry mumbled. “I could have gotten it myself.”
“I guess it wasn’t?”  Harry wondered.
“Harry please-“ He heard Hermione calling him. Ignoring them he hurried up and tried not to slam the dorm door shut. Around him his friends were sleeping. The light snoring from Neville’s bed was unmistakable, considering it had accompanied the dorm for six years. Harry tried not to disturb the others as he got ready for bed and threw his shoes on the floor. Closing the curtain around the bed, he laid down and closed his eyes. Even though he was exhausted, thoughts and dreaded scenarios continued to roam around inside of him. Of course, he wasn’t for sure that Ginny had told anyone. She wasn’t a chatterbox nor a tattle tell, but that wasn’t the problem. Ginny had a tendency to hang around Parvati and Lavender. And those two girls spent more time with their mouths open than closed. Trying to force the almost nauseating feeling in his stomach to settle down, he kept breathing deeply.
“Where on earth did you get this, Potter. Have you been to Knockturn alley?”
“Yeah, I can see that.” Neville pulled Trevor closer to him as the toad tried to jump. “It is good to be back though.”
“You can’t be serious?” Harry grinned.
“And the reason for you not going back to the tower then?” Remus stretched out the question.
“I know. He is eating everything I throw his way. He even started eating my chair when I didn’t come home quickly enough.” Hagrid laughed and showed him the leg on the only other chair in the hut. It was almost chewed in half and Harry wondered how it didn’t break under Hagrid’s weight. Actually, as he glanced around the room he realized a lot of things were broken. Splintered glass and wood laid around, some of the stones from the fireplace had been scratched out and the paint from the window ceiling was almost gone.
“I’m freezing. I thought our normal school sweater was enough, but it’s not really holding up.” He gestured with an arm swing.
“Hey Harry! How was summer?”
The pretty dark-skinned girl looked up from the board in her hands. “Of course, Mr. Weasley, they are in the back room. I’ll go get them.” she tight skirt she wore flared slightly as she turned. “Hello, Harry.” She winked. He simply gave the older woman a shy wave back.
“So when Snape kissed you?...”
The first night at Hogwarts was always the worst. Draco spent so much time turning, trying to find just a slightly comfortable position in the tiny single bed in their dorm. Next to his king sized bed at home filled with pillows made of peacock feathers, the bed at Hogwarts felt like a bale of hay. Therefor, waking up the first morning was never a good morning for Draco. Silently walking into the huge bathroom, he turned the knobs and entered the warm spray of water.
Storming in, he grabbed Malfoy by his collar which nearly pushed him to the floor in the haste. Everyone in class were looking at them as the three men came out. Harry couldn’t look anybody in the eyes, only imagining the horrible stuff they were quietly whispering amongst themselves. Getting back to the table where Jason looked rather worried and Zabini gave a chilling stare, Harry realized he had forgotten the honey once again.
“You had some sugar on the cheek.” He smiled and rang up the bag. “This is your first time here, isn’t it?”
“No, I just-“ Seamus ran a hand over his face.
“I liked the champagne better.” he admitted as he took a second sip. Draco chuckled into his own glass.
“Lupin, I swear-“
As Hermione was the least strong between the three and easiest at the wandwork when it came to
“Perhaps we can curse some of the snowballs to go after anyone whom moves?” Neville suggested uncertainly.
“I think it is time for you boys to head back inside now,” the headmaster smiled gently. “It is after all a school day tomorrow. Hagrid would you by any chance have a malt whiskey at your place? I do believe we should send off your friend with a proper toast.” McGonagall gave a small nod and a kind smile.
to jump two steps at a time!”
“Hey! We accept it, we just think they aren’t being honest about this whole… friendship.” Ron grimaced.
someone I dated while I was in Australia. He has lived there his entire life and offered to show me around. He was sweet and hot, so I agreed. We spend an enormous amount of time together, almost every day, for three weeks.” Blaise could finally look him in the eyes again. “Unfortunately, I accidently meet his aunt, whom he had lived with for a while.”
“Hello.” He smirked.
“I believe the anger is related more to Snape than you.” Harry couldn’t help but chuckle as he watched Malfoy being dragged off with Fay Dunbar, positively the most Scottish girl they had in the school. The two boys walked towards a unicorn that had not been chosen yet. Moving carefully, Harry gently raised a hand for the animal to sniff him. Practically holding his breath as he felt the warm air on his hand, inhaling and exhaling, slowly.
“Draco, can’t anymore…”
“Sir?”
Stretching his neck, Harry looked into the goblet where he realized the content of the batch. It was the same muddy potion, Remus had been drinking every month for the past many years. The wolfsbane potion looked as it always had and Harry wasn’t surer why Jason would believe this could be a present since Professor Snape brewed it every month. On the other hand, it was very nice of him to brew it even though the two men had had their difficulties.
“Jason?” He asked the eating boy. “Did Blaise get you anything for Christmas?”
Laughing now as well, Draco got up and pulled Harry with him.
A friendly warm hand was laid on his knee.
“It’s all right. I just noticed them and thought I would take a closer look.”
Looks like it…
Jason smiled and invited them in.
“Thanks, man.” Jason made a small fistbump, which he answered with a laugh.
A huge silence filled the almost empty room and Harry finally had time to think. His head barely hurt after the potion and his thoughts could gather whatever small memory he had of the accident. The unicorn had seemed very friendly and calm, so why had it suddenly flipped out? Looking back at Jason, he couldn’t help but wonder if something had ticked it off. Closing his eyes, he tried to push it aside for now. He was actually really tired…
“Charlie.” The man placed the cup on the table as they both sat down.
“I’m sure you’ll find the energy when it revolves around him. After all, having found his mate so young it probably won’t be too far into the future to expect grandchildren.” Remus teased.
“Great, thanks.”
“I know, I know, okay?” Harry tried to leave it, and even though his friends had been worried and were curious as to what he had been doing for the entire day, Harry kept his mouth shut. If anyone found out Hagrid had kept a dragon – for the second time in seven years – Not even Dumbledore could save him from the schoolboard. In the end, the boys left it alone and spoke about other matters, but Harry noticed Ron and Hermione sitting across each other, and he quickly felt an angered nagging feeling as they gave each other dissatisfied and provoking glances. They didn’t seem to believe his story; ‘talking’ to Hagrid, but unlike his other friends, they never knew when to let go.
