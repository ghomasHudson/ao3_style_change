“Hermione wouldn’t have kept that a secret anyways! Right, Harry?” Ron asked, bumping him with his shoulder.
“Yes, thank you. Would you like to give me my present here at breakfast or later?” She asked and Harry noticed that she did not blink as much as most people did.
a bit to get used to Draco and I was bonded to him! I could only imagine what it would be like for you. Hermione found out when we were fighting or I may have just told the both of you. I don’t know. We both made some shitty decisions this year, but I truly think you and Draco will get along eventually. You just have to give him a chance. But we aren’t talking about me right now. Congratulations you two! Hurts like a bitch at first!” Harry forced a smile at his two best mates, and then a thought struck him and he legitimately starting laughing.
“That’s it, we’re taking you to the Hospital Wing, you look like death. You’re fucking scaring us, Draco,” Pansy said and Draco felt worry pierce through the bond. He looked up blearily and witnessed Harry and Granger at the end of the hallway, staring at him. Harry had a look of utter surprise on his face.
Theo rolled his eyes, “Yeah, whatever.”
Draco pressed his lips desperately to Harry’s, a feeling of absolute euphoria settling over him as Harry kissed him back. Harry’s arms came up quickly around his shoulders, hands fisting in his hair, and Draco couldn’t swallow the groan that came from him at the feeling. They kissed feverishly, warmth and pleasure flowing from where their soul marks pressed against each other. Harry’s tongue swiped across Draco’s bottom lip and a sigh escaped him.
Draco glared at the back of Harry’s head; they were back in the dungeons, unfortunately for Potions class and not their extracurricular meetings.
“Couldn’t pay me to swim in the Lake right now,” Theo commented.
“You should let us take you to the Hospital Wing,” Hermione said standing near Draco’s feet.
"Thank you so much for that glowing recommendation," Draco drawled and she laughed at him.
The Great Hall was decorated to look like it was covered in snow, Draco caught sight of Cedric Diggory and Cho Chang standing outside the doors and Draco strained to try and see if any of the other champions were around. Unfortunately he couldn’t see anything, but felt anxiety flowing through the bond.
“Yep, fine. Good for those two though, they seemed really happy.”
“Welcome to the Second Task of the Triwizard Tournament! Last night someone near and dear to the Champions was taken. They will have one hour to retrieve them from the Black Lake, or it will be gone forever!”
“What’s happened?” Draco demanded desperately.
“Does that do something? I’ve noticed you keep touching it,” Weasley asked and Harry smiled.
“They couldn’t force a 14 year old to enter a tournament reserved for adults, but here we fucking are,” Draco spit, anxiety gripping him. “Well, I’m not letting them take me, they can shove it.”

“What the fuck did I miss?”
Hermione scrawled ‘What is wrong?’ in runes across the parchment for their next translation. She handed the note over, quickly translating the passage they were supposed to be scribing and watched Draco’s face as he puzzled out her words. His eyes narrowed at the message. He scrawled back a few runes and they swapped again.
“Yes, sir, I understand,” Draco forced out, his mind zipping through the horrors he could have possibly faced.
As Harry pulled the two of them away, he could have sworn he heard Malfoy exhale in relief.
“Well I suppose my parents thought it was the best, that and Dumbledore insists I go back every summer.”
“Shh, Draco, it’s okay,” Harry muttered and instantly Draco relaxed. His eyes darted to Harry, confusion on his face and flowing through the bond.
“Not going well, I take it?” Draco asked, busying himself with taking off his outer robe and tie.
“You’re right,” Harry said absently, hopping down from the counter and crossing the short space to Draco. “Can I?” He asked quietly, raising his hand hesitantly.
“Go, she needs you.”
“Please hold his hand to your mark,” Pomfrey instructed. Harry did what he was told, and fervently hoped it didn’t bring Draco as much pain as Harry was experiencing touching Draco’s mark. Harry ignored the feeling of his hand being burned, focusing instead on gritting his teeth against what felt like acid flowing through his body.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Promise," Draco assured him again.
“Doubt even Saint Potter could get past the age line Dumbledore drew, I don’t see a beard anyway,” Draco said offhandedly.
Draco felt a tightening in his chest and realized the gillyweed was wearing off. An uncomfortable feeling in his neck told him Harry’s gills were gone. Draco grabbed at Pansy’s hand, squeezing hard in an effort to not lose his mind. He felt Harry suffocating, his thoughts becoming overwhelmed with panic. Just as Draco was about to throw all caution to the wind and alert the tournament organizers, a series of splashes and a feeling of relief signaled that Harry had surfaced. Weasley and a small girl that Draco assumed was Gabrielle, shortly followed by Harry, made their way towards the edge of the Lake. Draco was also interested to see a crowd of Merpeople had surfaced and were swimming with Harry, Weasley, and Gabrielle. Draco released his crushing grip on Pansy’s hand, taking deep breaths to calm himself down and forget the feeling of Harry drowning.
Draco stared at the stag for a few more moments before it clicked, “Prongs.”
“Are you surprised? We stared at the lake for over an hour,” Draco laughed and Pansy scrunched up her nose.
Draco nodded before sprinting from the ward. He didn’t have to go far. Pansy was sitting against the wall a corridor over, face in her hands.
“Excuse me, what?” Ginny asked, blinking rapidly.
Harry sighed deeply, “I don’t understand why. I feel angry all of the time. I keep snapping at everyone, I screamed at you. I hate it.”
“Oi! Ron, Harry!” Dean Thomas waved from in front of a tent completely decked out in shamrocks and various other decorations in emerald green. His soul-mate, Seamus Finnegan, was wearing a matching outfit, completely plastered with shamrocks accented by a yellow edging.
“What were your theories? And what was with splitting my bag the other day? That was annoying.”
"Not my fault you were a prat," she teased back.
Ron frowned, “Unless he tortured and murdered a cat or something, I don’t quite think his dad should have done that.”
“You are wearing my tie,” Draco growled, punctuating each word as he grabbed onto the aforementioned object. Harry simply smirked at him, his teeth catching the light of the moon through the window. “You look so stunningly handsome. Green is definitely your colour. Now I hope you don’t hold my following behaviour against me.”
Theo shrugged, “Are you taking the bet or not?”
“You what?!” Harry burst, “That’s brilliant!”
“Oh call me Pansy, you may as well, we do share a boyfriend. And it’s barely different than before, I’ve been covering Draco’s arse since we were babies.”
“I liked dragons growing up...” He trailed off, refusing to look over at Hermione. He seemed to shake himself, “That doesn’t make sense though, they’re all so different. It would be like having one person fighting a hippogriff and the other one fighting a flobberworm. Welsh Greens are barely considered dangerous next to a Hungarian Horntail, they feed on sheep!”
“I’m not up to his standards, so he reminded me of my place. Nothing I’m not used to. It’s fine. You absolutely need to go. I’m well enough to get back to the Castle. Go find Harry. I’ll go to the classroom. Please,” Draco begged. He wanted to be alone. Hermione had seen and done enough.
“Isn’t her sister, like, not even school aged? I saw her arrive yesterday,” Pansy asked, her face pinched.
A few minutes later a splash was heard, and everyone cheered as Cedric and Cho surfaced about 100 feet from shore. Cho was looking incredibly disoriented as Cedric pulled the two of them back to shore.
Draco bid goodnight to his friends, thankful that overt public displays of affection this early in the relationship would be considered completely uncouth so that he could get away with not kissing Pansy in public. Technically leaving love bites on display was considered over the line, but as long as Pansy didn’t show up with any his housemates wouldn’t be writing home to their parents about their indiscretions.
Draco let out a relieved sigh and nodded his head. Harry unfisted his hand and spread his fingers across Draco’s mark, he felt Draco’s heart beat pick up. Harry bit his lip, but reached into his pocket and threw on the Invisibility Cloak. He carefully ran his thumb across Draco’s cheek bone, watching Draco’s eyes flutter shut and a quiet sigh fall through his lips, before he turned away and made his way to the doors of the Wing.
Harry smirked, thoughts of DADA completely washed from his brain, he reached up knocking Malfoy’s hands from his chest and flipped them around so Malfoy was pinned against the tree. “Maybe.”
“And Wormtail,” Harry spit, before shaking his head and smiling at Draco. “Regardless, they created it. I have no idea how, Lupin said it took every one of their skills and aptitudes to get it right and they barely finished it by the time they graduated.”
“What kept you away so long? We were going to send a search party!”
“Merry Christmas, Draco,” Harry whispered.
So I'm freaking out a bit because I finally linked some scenes that I had written way back in the summer for the end of this story, with what I have currently. Outside of a few scenes here and there I have officially finished writing this story! I'm going to estimate that we have maybe five to ten chapters left, leaning closer to five (not including this one). It's insane! I cannot believe how far we've come.
Draco sighed as well, “I know you’re right.”
“I’m trying not to laugh, but I’m imagining what you probably said,” Harry said staring up at him, his eyes soft.
Harry shook his head, as if to clear it, “Anyway! Thank you for helping him. That means a lot to me that you’d do that.”
“I made fun of you for that, constantly! I dressed up like a bloody Dementor to distract you. I was essentially making fun of you for being upset you heard your parents dying. That doesn’t strike you as something I should be cursed for? Fuck, how are we soul-mates?” He scrubbed his hands over his face, ending with his hands clutched in his hair.
Malfoy cut him off, “We both know what happened earlier,” He pulled at the collar of Harry’s shirt, exposing the sun tattoo. Simultaneously he pulled down on his own collar and the corner of an elaborate moon, made up of blues, purples, and even yellows around the rim, peeked into view. “We don’t have time right now. Just get out of here, it’s not safe. We’ll speak more at Hogwarts.”
Hermione bit her lip, turning around and hurrying the other way towards the Castle. “Physically yes, I think so.” She fought to keep up with Harry’s wide steps, he and Ron had grown so much in the past year. “Where’s Ron?”
"Not so fun being the uninjured party is it?" Draco taunted, packing up some of his supplies. Harry noticed the potion was gradually changing from a slate gray to a green colour.
“Two Blood-Traitors and a Mudblood,” Father’s lip curled as he glared at them.
No words reached his ears, but he could feel a question lingering in his mind.
Draco snapped his shields more tightly around his thoughts, glaring hard at the man.
Draco felt a tightness in his chest like when he would hold his breath until Harry dove the rest of the way beneath the water and the feeling disappeared. Draco figured he must be using his new gills. At the very least, the gillyweed had worked. Unfortunately, the icy child from the water was covering his entire body now. Draco wasn’t sure if Harry was uncomfortable because his emotions were focused, but all Draco could think about was how bloody cold he was.
“Please don’t waste your tears on me,” He said softly.
Hermione smiled at him and set her head on his shoulder, “I guess that’s definitely true.”
Ginny glared at him, “What, just because they’re both girls they can’t be anything but platonic? They’re lesbians, Ronald. Imogen has been out for awhile.”
“Don’t worry Malfoy, it doesn’t,” Harry called back. “Best bundle up for it though; I know how you Slytherins get when the weather isn’t absolutely perfect.”
“I don’t want that. It should be Cedric’s.”
“Cheers to that,” Fred or George said.
“Draco, I had no idea. I wish you would have said something, I could have helped. I don’t have to leave love bites; we don’t have to lock ourselves up here as much as we do.”
“You’re practically drooling.”
Harry blushed, breaking eye contact. He wasn’t about to tell Malfoy how he had previously broken ribs, his mind flashing briefly to Uncle Vernon.
Draco didn’t have to work hard to bring the sneer to his face, “Not that it’s any of
“You were the one that wanted to!”
Sirius returned shortly after escorting Harry back to the Castle, he quickly transformed back into his human self, helping Remus mend a few broken objects from the training session.
“How can you be sure?” Draco whispered, trying to calm his breathing.
Harry blushed and shrugged, “Er, I don’t really have an answer for that one. Magic?”
“It wasn’t, Lucius used her seal so that I would open it. More blood supremacy bullshit. Thankfully, he is sending an elf to come retrieve me from the platform. I have my letter ready to give to them instead. I sealed it with my magical signature so they’ll know I wrote it.”
The meal flew by in a whirl of Draco mindlessly chewing his food and trying to sneak looks at Harry whenever possible. Before he knew it, the tables were being moved backward and the Champions were being told to lead the Ball in the first dance. Draco smirked at the feelings of utter terror filtering through the bond, Harry hadn’t been this freaked out by the damn Horntail, but dancing was an entirely different horror apparently.
Draco waved her off, “I promise I’ll be fine. I have potion I can take in my lab should the need arise. I’m just tired. My cheek will bruise and I’ll have a wicked black eye. Feel free to tell everyone it was Lucius. I can’t wait until Severus finds out.”
“Can I go back to breakfast now?”
“Introducing Canary Creams by Weasley’ Wizard Wheezes! Available by order through us!” The Twins yelled, standing on top of the Gryffindor table.
Sirius nodded, “I can imagine any son and only heir of Lucius Malfoy is going to be raised in the typical Pureblood fashion.”
Draco cast the spell on their feet and they made their way out of their classroom and down to the dungeons. Draco was completely awe-struck by this map. It was no wonder Harry had no problem always knowing where he was.
Hermione bit her lip, “I’m sorry, I’m rubbish at healing. I’ve never learned.” She felt awful but didn’t know what else to do that wouldn’t make things worse. Draco seemed to acknowledge her words and had straightened his legs from the bent position they had been in. Hermione helped him into a seated position, figuring that getting his face off the ground would be beneficial all around. Draco went easily, still eerily silent.
“We know!” They said in unison, messing up his hair roughly. “You’re on your own explaining away your night time escapades with Ronnikins.”
Draco and Hermione’s eyes bulged and Harry saw a distinct green tint to Draco’s complexion.
Draco looked up at her, his hand still holding her scarf to his face. It had once been a red tartan, but was now a deep reddish brown. His skin was almost devoid of all colour besides the stain of blood down his nose and chin.
He definitely picked the right side.
“You suffered a bond refusal illness. I have already briefly spoken to Mr. Potter about the absolute dangers of ignoring your bond. Thankfully, we caught it in time and I was able to heal you. You should steadily regain your normal strength over the course of the day. I urge the both of you to discuss your differences; I will not be able to keep the Wing sealed for too much longer. There are a number of people that have been eager to visit. I can guarantee you a few moments. At Mr. Potter’s request I have kept the knowledge of your bond to myself, as far as anyone is aware Mr. Malfoy you suffered from an untreated case of the Owl Flu. You are obviously quickly recovering after the appropriate potions.” Madam Pomfrey disappeared without another word.
“Can I help you?” Draco asked, raising his brow, he fought off a wince from the ache that ran through his face at the movement.
Not even Malfoy and his family sitting behind them could sour his mood at this game. Throughout the whole game, Harry couldn’t stop thinking about how excited he was to get back on a broom. Just a few short days and he would be back on Hogwarts grounds and able to fly again.
Harry shrugged again before sighing, “We really should get back to our Common Rooms, we can’t afford to get caught.”
“Er, yeah, I can do a Patronus now. So it’s fine.”
Draco found himself having a good time, but was happy to sneak looks at Harry whenever he could. At one point Parvati was trying to teach Harry how to dance what Draco guessed was a traditional Indian dance and Draco could feel nothing but unrelenting happiness and joy filtering through the bond. Draco had had to reel in his jealousy when he later caught Harry and the girl Weasley dancing, but he tried to have fun with his friends and not be preoccupied by Harry’s dance partners. At one point Harry had even grabbed Finnigan and spun him around the room a couple times (in what Draco suspected was a ‘fuck you’ to anyone that thought that Harry only wanted to dance with girls) and Draco had done the same to Blaise, insisting they could not let the Gryffindors think they were better than them.
“Fisticuffs and other forms of grappling are beneath a Malfoy, my Father would be beside himself,” Malfoy twirled his wand in his hand.
“What are you on about?” Pansy whispered as they head down the hallway.
The Weasley siblings were quite loud and boisterous as they ate. Draco could safely say he had never seen such a scene outside of a few glimpses at the Gryffindor table at Feasts.
Harry clawed at his chest, ripping his shirt open, he felt like his entire soul-mark was on fire. It dully reminded him of the pain he had felt when the Basilisk had bitten him. Like an inferno had sparked from the sun on his chest and was threatening to spread to the rest of his body.
“I think I have a fair idea,” Harry grinned.
“You look beautiful, Millie,” Draco commented. Her deep purple robes twinkled subtly.
Ginny was frowning, “Er, I’m so sorry Luna, but I didn’t actually manage to get you anything.”
“You’d apologize to Hermione? You know what that would mean, right?” Harry asked, Hermione would know they were soul-mates then. Harry guessed she already suspected after last night, but this was something else entirely.
Draco was pretty sure his nails, regardless of how blunt he kept them, were going to shred the palms of his hands where he kept them clenched and hiding in his pockets. Sure enough when he saw and felt the pain of the dragon’s tail hitting Harry, his nails cut into his palms, Draco couldn’t inhale a breathe as he tried to gauge how badly Harry was injured. Shortly after Harry finally achieved his prize and flew away with the golden egg under his arm. Excitement and happiness clear emotions on his face and coming through the bond as he was dismissed from the task.
Harry felt badly for how upset Ginny sounded, but also found it presumptuous that this girl would come over demanding presents. Luna did not seem affected by Ginny’s words at all.
“You’re still Harry,” Draco said and decided, fuck it. He grasped the collar of Harry’s shirt and tore it in two, pulling the two scraps of fabric off his chest. Draco had considered just vanishing the whole kit, but worried how Harry might react to anything but non-magical means right now. “See look,” Draco brushed his hand over Harry’s mark and felt comfort flow through the bond.
After one more night in the Hospital Wing, Madam Pomfrey released Harry with some pamphlets detailing information on something called ‘Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder’. Harry didn’t really want to look at them, but Draco took them and pocketed them for later reading. Pomfrey also instructed Harry not to hesitate to Owl her if he needed any help or wanted to talk.
“Excuse me?”
Draco found himself outside of Lucius’ study quicker than he liked. Draco took a few cleansing breaths. He cast the spells needed to disable Lucius’ wards and stepped through. Years of watching Lucius cast the spells was finally paying off. Draco paused inside the room and took a moment to feel for the wards of the Manor. He had always felt attuned to them, but today he felt even closer. Hopefully that meant good things for what he was about to do.
“I’m sorry you ever had to deal with that,” He said, measuring his words carefully. His mind was whirling through multiple ways to torture and injure Harry’s relatives. He wished he knew what they looked like so he could imagine them better.
“Er-“ Harry said, abruptly sprinting from the room and into the loo, locking it tight behind him.
“Highly doubt that would ever be possible, besides you’re mostly pink now.” Harry held up his arm next to Ron’s, his brown skin throwing a deep contrast to Ron’s sun-burned forearms.
“Growth,” Draco acknowledged, a small smile on his face. Harry rolled his eyes at him.
“We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss...” Draco whispered, thinking hard.
“Sure, easy gold.”
“Ugh, gross! Come on, Draco!” Pansy complained as they continued down the hallway.
“I always thought that the ones that complete one another were platonic...” Ron said, confusion painting his face.
“Come on, love,” Draco said carefully reaching his arm under Harry’s arm and helping him to his feet. Harry went with him with no restraint.
“You’re being fucking serious right now?” Pansy asked, turning a steely glare on him.
“No, Harry, if this bitch wants to march –”
Draco was fighting hard not to think too much about what Weasley had said. Torture? That better not mean what he thought it did. Draco looked to Pomfrey, letting the sneer drop, “I am extremely sorry to bother you, Madam, but I took a Bludger to the ribs and it was beginning to get hard to breathe.”
Harry frowned, “What can I do to help?”
He drifted through the rest of his day with his thoughts permanently fixed on Draco.
“Sure, sure,” Draco waved his hand placatingly. Thankfully Madam Pomfrey was ready with more potion and before long Harry had drifted off again.
Harry sighed, “I feel awful, I’ve been such a shit friend to Ron. It’s just really nice getting to spend time with you. It makes me forget about all of the bad stuff happening out there.” He gestured vaguely towards the rest of the castle.
“Because in my experience it doesn’t fucking work like that! You think the grownups will come and save you, but they don’t. You go years always feeling hungry and being hurt and you figure this must be how it is for people who look like me.
The two of them exchanged a curious glance before stepping closer.
Draco smirked, "They'll have to drag me out kicking and screaming as long as you want me here."
“Oh,” Harry genuinely smirked, for the first time since before the 3rd Task it seemed. “Yeah, I can do that.”
“I’m sorry, I’m rubbish at healing. I’ve never learned,” She said as Draco winced at the cold. His wits were slowly coming back to him. His face throbbed painfully and Draco didn’t know how Harry hadn’t already come to find him. He hoped he hadn’t been too affected. Hermione gently pulled him into a  seated position when she pressed the snow-scarf to his face, but she still kneeled beside him.
Draco shook his head again, “It feels far, but I can still feel his pain and emotions like he’s inside the Castle.” Draco was struck with the pain of being tortured again and sagged down onto a chair, gripping the back as he rode out the pain.
“The threats were wonderful, however empty when he realizes that you do not speak for your family,” Severus drawled and Draco squinted at him.
“That’s obviously not ideal, but I’d rather you get lessons from two competent wizards and be able to defend yourself. I think spending time with the two of them will do you good too. Also, I imagine I haven’t been helping with the anger. I’ve been pretty mad about things too. I’m sure it’s bleeding off on you.”
“I can’t forget what has been drilled into me for 14 years, overnight. I’m trying, okay? I’m deeply sorry. Would it make a difference to you if I apologized to her? I will, if that’s what it takes to show you I’m seriously trying.” Draco stared at Harry as his eyes bulged.
“Come on, Ron. We’ll be back first thing in the morning,” Hermione said, grabbing Weasley’s hand and tugging him towards the doors. It was obvious she had been crying, her dark skin much paler than normal.  “Malfoy,” Hermione sneered before wasting no time to tug Weasley the rest of the way from the Ward. Draco paid no attention to what Weasley was complaining about as she pulled him from the Hospital Wing. The moment the doors shut behind them and Pomfrey had spelled them shut, Draco was off of the bed and wrenching Harry’s curtains apart.
Theo rolled his eyes, “Yeah I know that’s not what you meant. I dunno I guess I suspected at the naming of the Champions, then I really thought so when you got sick, then after the First Task I wasn’t so sure, then during the Ball and the Second Task I was positive. Sorry mate, I mean this in the least homophobic way possible, but I know you couldn’t get it up for Pansy if your life depended on it. It was too weird that you were now dating her, but I have to hand it to both of you, you put on quite a show. I honestly just thought maybe you were giving into your dad, but then when you stuck it to him after the Second Task, I knew there had to be a bigger reason.
“Finally!” Draco burst, “Can I go see him now?”
Draco spun the two of them around and pressed Harry against the wall, still holding steady to his tie. “This is the first time I haven’t wanted to rip your clothes off,” Draco commented before bringing his lips to Harry’s in a bruising kiss. Draco slotted his leg in between Harry’s and pressed his hips against him as he kissed down his neck, sucking hard on the skin as he went. Draco never left love bites where anyone could see them on Harry, but he found himself unable to care at this point. He had a night’s worth of pent-up frustration to let out. Harry was making absolutely delicious noises beneath him and Draco finally found the will power to undo the top of Harry’s robes to unveil his soul-mark. Draco lightly ran his nails down Harry’s chest before nipping at Harry’s bottom lip.
With a delay, Harry processed the silliness of the joke and the silliness of Ron’s attempt to lighten the mood and laughed. Ron laughed too. Harry felt so glad he had Ron in his life. No matter what, Ron was always trying to make Harry feel better.
Draco couldn’t help thinking as he felt Harry’s body. Harry was no super athletic jock, of course, but still.
“No, leave it,” Harry said.
“You know nothing, Potter. Nothing.” They stayed in silence for a moment.
Harry took a deep breath. “When he was with a boy and when he was with a girl. That’s what I’m trying to say. He didn’t care.”
“Where does that leave – you know… us?” Draco asked.
” said Ron and Hermione together.
He was right no one asked him anything, but that was probably because before they had the opportunity to point out his being in a hurry to leave the train he said, “Hey, let’s hurry before there’s a crowd of people pushing us. And to get a good carriage.”
“Let me just fix that for you,” said Hermione pointing her wand at Harry’s nose. “Episkey,” she said and Harry’s nose made a
That was why Harry decided to tell his friends what happened between him and Draco. It was the last thing he needed to do to make this a closed chapter in his life and let it go.
“Dumbledore told me to stay close to you,” Draco blurted out. He couldn’t stand any more of playing parts, pretending, he wanted to go straight to the point.
“Shut up,” Harry muttered in response.
For all that, and many other things Malfoy had done, Harry wanted to punch him. As if in doing so he’d be punishing Malfoy in advance for all the horrible things he was to be taking part of, and almost as if in doing so he could somehow prevent Malfoy from taking part those things.
“It’s okay.”
“No, I want to. I didn’t want it with him because, he’s a boy. I’m not proud of it. But I can’t lie to myself anymore. I didn’t want to be seen, or to see myself, like that with another guy. You know?”
trouble, and they had been
Draco turned back to the girl, “He says I’m not.”
“So…”
“Yes. My loyalty.”
. And it makes me think of us.”
“How? I want to understand, I really do.”
“You didn’t come,” Draco said.
“But you will be. I’m not fucking blind, Malfoy, I’ve looked at your arm, for fuck’s sake.”
“Yeah, maybe I am.”
Ugh, such a spoiled baby, Harry had thought to himself.
The only thing Harry knew for certain was that Draco wasn’t going through with it. He had been forced to put up with the mission and still couldn’t do it when the time came.
Harry, with his hands on Draco’s hips, started to push Draco softly for them to move toward the wall, never parting from their embrace. They tripped on each other’s feet, lost balance and fell. Smiling at their silliness, kept on kissing like their lives depended on it. In fact, Harry only ever stopped kissing Draco’s mouth when he was busy kissing Draco’s neck, or ear. Harry kissed Draco’s neck on a couple of spots, then sucked on his skin and left a small hickey.
“I thing I do.”
Draco was sobbing now, his thrusts weren’t as strong anymore, his pushing became more of a spasm as he cried uncontrollably.
“I see. That’s why you insisted on doing it for me since the beginning.”
Harry mumbled something inaudible.
Ouch. Harry knew of course that was true, but in these situation you always kind of expect the other person to tell you it’s alright and that you don’t need to worry. But Draco really had been hurt Harry.
That was scary but was the truth.
He was in a compartment with a few other Slytherins he hadn’t really had much contact with. He chose a compartment with people from other years than his on purpose so that no one would bother him. At least something useful his old life brought him, he did manage to build a pretty good reputation in Slytherin so hardly any of the people in that compartment would feel like they had any aperture to talk to Draco.
“Harry, he called me a mudblood!”
Before Draco could answer to that and say he disagreed, he noticed Harry was already sleeping. He rearranged himself and Harry so that they could both go to sleep.
“Oh…” said Myrtle, as if trying to find something comforting to say but failing.
Draco’s heart beat a bit faster at those words and he hesitated, praying Harry wouldn’t notice. How could he not? His ear was pressed against Draco’s chest. Harry raised his head again with a puzzled look at Draco. “What’s wrong?”
Harry never thought he say, or think, that, but he was glad that the more advanced your year in Hogwarts, the more homework and study related things you had, because now, in his 6
“Yeah, I guess. I don’t know, it’s just… everything. I know there is nothing to be
“So, what’s the deal with the both of you?” a Slytherin girl asked one time after the group had arranged itself in duos and the teacher was away grabbing some materials in another room. Harry and Draco had formed a duo, naturally.
“Just forget it. Leave it. And I need some time alone, too. Please.”
With the time seemingly slowing down and every day taking longer to pass than the previous one, finally the break ended. Harry and Draco would see each other again.
“What other stuff?” Harry asked.
“We can’t go at the same time, go first.”
Did Draco care about him? He seemed to. Harry was the one that strove to keep any emotional bond away from their relationship. Was he right in doing so? He thought so. He didn’t want things to get more complicated than they already were and that seemed the best decision he’d made, seen that now things were the most complicated they’d ever gotten.
me the more I hope he’ll grow to like me like I like him,” he paused. “But I…” he began again, “I– AAAH” he bellowed and Harry heard the sound of his fists pounding the sink. “I can’t!” Malfoy said finally. “I can’t! I just can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I CAN’T!” Pounding at the sink again. “Not now, not in the middle of all this,” his tone was that of one showing something that Harry, of course, couldn’t see from where he was. “And I feel it moving from time to time. It’s alive. You know what that means, don’t you? It’ll only get worse. I’ll only be dragged deeper and deeper into their plans. What will my father do if he discovers?”
As a matter of fact, yes. I have. I don’t want to go into that… path. I told Dumbledore everything. What they were making me get into. What they… demanded of me.” Draco faltered a little in finishing the last sentence.
“What’s the deal with the both of us?” Harry asked her in the same tone she asked them.
“Your loyalty?”
He was afraid. What would they say? What would they do?
Draco had been feeling good about the news. It felt like a little compensation in the midst of everything, of all the unpleasantness that was going on in his life, with his father and all.
Draco was a bit surprised.
“Huh?”
“Yeah, but it certainly feels like it is,” Draco had answered. “Oh, god, of everyone in this place, if could be anyone, anyone. Why him?” He had paused to exhale a big breath, then continued, “And it’s for real, you know, it really is. I tried to deny it to myself, to convince me it was just a crush, that it’d go away, but it’s not, it is for real, Myrtle. Oh, god, I’m in love with him. What would my father say to that?”
On the days that followed, the two were getting more and more comfortable being together in public. They had gone from – before the War – insulting each other in every encounter in the hallways to – after the War – not insulting each other and actually greeting each other. From discreet
Draco knocked twice on Scorpius’s door. “Come in,” came the answer. When Draco opened the door, he saw his son sitting on the bed, putting on his shoes. He stood up. “Does this look good? Or maybe I should use this other pair.” He was going to take the shoes off when Draco intervened.
“Yeah, I know…” Harry said chuckling sadly.
“And what do you expect me do to about that, Draco? You want us to go back to what we did? You want me to comfort you and say everything is gonna be alright?”
And did Draco want to stop insulting Potter? Were the insults empty of meaning? Only there because Draco was playing a role? No. They weren’t. Draco hated Potter, that he did. When he looked at Potter he really wanted to scream at him, and call him names, and see the glee fall from his face, and ruin his day. The way that the thoughts of Harry ruined Draco’s days.
“And you have doubts of whether I want the same,” Harry said. Draco noticed on his intonation that that was not a question, that was a statement. “That I’m just having fun with you. Draco, I–” Harry’s word trailed off as he let out a nervous laugh. “That same thought has crossed my mind about you. That you’d get bored of me. Or worse, that I’d be too difficult for you to deal with, that I’d hurt you somehow, I don’t know. Draco, I too want to be with you,” a sly smile formed on Harry’s mouth, “for a
“I guess you didn’t want to grow emotionally attached to the person that has been your enemy since first year,” Ron suggested.
… Harry,” he added.
“I’m sorry I left,” Hermione said.
“And what’s wrong with Slytherin values?” Draco asked, also amused.
Ron shrugged and said with his mouth full, “I don’t know.”
Draco laughed sarcastically at that. “Oh I’m not a saint either, am I? You’re a fucking asshole. You don’t care about anyone, do you?”
Draco instinctively reached his hand to his forearm, where the tattoo of a skull and a snake danced in his skin.
“I know. But I would like to,” he said, but the idea clearly scared him. “I wanna do this, Draco.”
meet in the hallways. It’s getting tiring to avoid you constantly.”
Draco asked himself. He had to concentrate a lot at time to not feel like when he had for the first time in his life done the right thing and offered his help for the right side, his help had been declined. It was like Dumbledore didn’t need him, had no plans for him. So he might as well go and join the Death Eaters, really join them, at heart and mind. He had had these thoughts when talking with Dumbledore the second time.
“Yes?”
“But I’m really sorry, though. I am,” Harry said.
This was not going well. Harry didn’t know what to do or say to help appease Draco, and he was afraid to say or do the wrong thing and make Draco shout and attract attention to them. “Wh… what do you want to do, then?” Harry almost shouted, but controlled himself to make it go out in a reasonable tone. It came out a bit choked. But it didn’t matter because none of them paid it attention to it when Draco did what he did next.
One day, a couple of years after they had finished school, Draco came to Harry almost jumping out of happiness with the news of having found someone to bear their child. It was Astoria, one of the few true friends Slytherin House had provided Draco. They never lost complete contact after school, always communicated here and there, at least in holidays and etc. Eventually the topic of Draco and Harry having decided they wanted to have a child and that they were in need of someone to bear the baby came up and she said she would be willing to volunteer, if they wanted. They were more than happy to accept and couldn’t thank her enough.
“Stay out of this…” said Draco pausing for a fraction of a moment, as if he was trying to pick an appropriate word, “Hermione,” he finished simply. That got Harry’s attention. He had never heard Draco call Hermione by her name. Most of the time he addressed her by insults related to her blood status, and even when he didn’t address her like that, it was by her last name. And with a lot of scorn, of course, never in that…
“I understand. It’s a huge change in your life, and the beginning of a very important phase, it’s normal to feel anxious. Just remember we will always be here for you. No matter what happens. Okay?”
“Oh, you know, being together against the odds. Everyone expected you two to hate each other, that seems like something you need bravery to do, doesn’t it?”
When the time comes. Was this the time?
about it? Thinking that it was having good results! Harry was being pathetic, and stupid, and a jerk. He was betraying his friends, stabbing them on their backs, letting Malfoy insult them and their families for years and now just forgetting all about it and having… relations with him. Harry realized he was so damn selfish. He was disgusted with himself.
Harry wished she would be back already with them in the Burrow. He wanted to ask her opinion on whether he should send a letter to Draco. He didn’t know why he was so awkward about it, but he didn’t know what he should do to make a good impression. Would he be too gluey if he sent Draco a letter? Would he seem too unattached if he didn’t? And especially after the talk they had by the lake. Harry went home shortly after that, so they didn’t say goodbye properly. Harry didn’t know if not saying anything would make it look like what he said by the lake was not for real or if maybe it was okay not to send anything for now and wait some weeks.
Harry laughed. Hermione joined in.
His friends reluctantly agreed and went to their spot on the tree, while Harry started to make back to the castle.
“What’s wrong?” Scorpius asked.
“Yeah, Malfoy, just fuck off,” said Ron.
Harry thought. But what was done was done and all was for the best. Now Harry had a huge thing in front of him and he couldn’t have anything holding him back. It was a good thing that the thing with Draco had ended because now Harry wasn’t going to go back to Hogwarts anymore. He had already decided that. He had already told his friends, they had already decided to go with him. It was settled.
Harry didn’t want to allow himself to get on thinking about Malfoy, he should forget Draco. But before he could turn his thought to some other thing, one last thought broke into his mind, even startling Harry, who didn’t know where that had come from.
Snape sighed. “I am not certain. I’m afraid we need the boy more than it seems to be comforting admitting.”
Harry and Draco had already eaten, but Harry was drinking coffee to make company to Scorpius as he ate. Draco took a mug and joined Harry on drinking coffee.
In one of the last compartments of the train, Draco almost could manage to convince himself he wasn’t nervous
“Something like ‘yeah, too bad that’s not ever gonna happen.’”
“I wouldn’t want to go in that shithole even if it did, Malfoy,” Harry snapped back, but continued to go in the direction they were going. “I’ll leave you there then I go to Gryffindor tower,” he said. “Because of the cloak, you idiot,” he explained. “You’d be seen otherwise.”
“What the
There was a moment’s silence.
“What’re you doing?” Harry asked, actually seeming amused, making Draco realize he’d been distractedly laying his hands on Harry’s chest and caressing his nipples.
“Well, talk then.”
Draco didn’t go back to Hogwarts either for their seventh year. As planned, he didn’t go back to school for the last year, since his studies weren’t necessary anymore – he would learn so much more from the Death Eaters, who knew magic more powerful than anything they would teach him in that lousy mudblood-loving school. Or so they told Draco – and since after what happened last year, they didn’t need to pretend not to be followers of Voldemort anymore.
“What?” Draco whispered. “Why are you coming with me? Slytherin common room won’t have you, Potter.” The antipathy was back in his voice in this last sentence.
“What do you care,” Malfoy muttered to himself quietly.
“So, are you calmer now?” Harry asked. “It’s normal to get a bit worked up, we’ve all been there. With so many new things to think about and all that. The choosing ceremony and all.”
“Do plan on finishing your studies?” Draco asked.
“Because you said we are sorted according to the values we admire the most.”
“Were you crying?” Hermione asked after they had entered the Great Hall and headed for Gryffindor table.
Did he see me? He had thought to himself. No, he can’t have. Or can he?
Draco decided he would try something. He would write back and he would ask Harry to not send any more letters for the rest of the summer. Even as Draco wrote it he felt sad thinking that he wanted Harry to write him, every day if he would. But Draco wanted to – needed to – know if he could live without Harry. It was a test. Draco was testing himself. To see how would he cope with it.
“Oh too bad, cause it was really being a very sweet dream for me. Really a dream to be
“Ron, I’ve pictured myself with other people I fancied. With… girls I fancied. It was never like that. It was… very emotional. But not with him.”
At least his father had taught him something useful – after being forced to live a lie for so many years, at least you mastered how to lie.
It was unnerving having no idea of how things would play out. What should he say? “Hey”? “How are you?” “How was your summer”? None of those things seemed right. “I missed you” was what he
“…totally fucked, aren’t I?” Harry heard Malfoy say. “God, I’m totally fucked.”
“Okay, that sounds… better.” Harry let out a nervous giggle.
“So you’re his owl then, are you?” the girl tried once again.
Draco pushed those thoughts away. It was no good thinking of this now. Or ever. What mattered was that they were fine, and together, with nothing between them. Both figuratively and literally because they were naked.
“No, Malfoy, I can’t.” Harry was getting impatient, Draco could notice, not only from his voice, but from the way he grabbed his pants as he pulled them up. “No, show me to the basement, or I’ll just find it myself, that is, if I don’t get lost in this place… And you should be going, too, by the way,” he added.
As soon as they arrived at the Burrow Harry started writing a letter to Hermione, to ask her opinion on the matter. As he was writing, Ron entered the room. He was eating a doughnut.
“Thanks,” Harry murmured.
Harry and Draco meet in the bathroom...
“Here,” Draco said pointing to a spot where the tree roots left enough space for two people to sit. They sat there and looked at the calm surface of the water reflecting the treetops around it and the sky above.
“What’s wrong?”
Neither knew what to say for some seconds, then both blurted out at the same time.
Those couple of months before the beginning of Hogwarts new term seemed to take forever to pass. Each week was like a whole year, especially being stuck in a home with Draco’s father. His relation with his father had always been complicated, but now it was something else. Draco had always let his head down and obeyed his father, but during the time of Voldemort’s return more than that was expected from Draco. He had to be
Draco turned. “Yes, Professor?”
Potter. Fucking. Harry. Potter. Is fucking. ME,” once again words intercalated with poundings on the sink, except for the last word, which was accompanied by the sound of glass being smashed and falling to the ground.
He wasn’t trying to hold a grudge against Harry, or anything, of course. The thing was that this situation was scary, because Draco felt vulnerable. As it was turning out, he was so unconditionally and irrevocably in love with Harry and that made him not care too much about himself. That was a scary thing to realize about yourself.
Even though it was already more than 10pm when dinner ended, midnight seemed to take very long to arrive. Harry had showered and changed in about five minutes and lied in bed counting the seconds.
“Oh little Weasley grew some balls, now? Oh go learn how to fly a broomstick, for Gryffindor Quidditch team’s sake, why don’t you.”
“Yes,” Harry said stupidly, answering Draco’s question-intoned sentence. Draco smiled and they climbed onto the carriage.
“I mean,” Draco quickly said to clarify, “I know you said it was over, and all. And I get it if it’s over. But… I’d just like to know if it’s not, is all.”
“Yes?”
Draco felt glad that at that moment that it was dark, except for the moonlight, so Harry couldn’t see his face was red. He felt like an idiot doing all that, and above all, pathetic. Harry hadn’t like that idea.
Harry then had instantly turned to the door and run.
He wasn’t sure what was the answer to any of those questions.
“Oh,” Hermione said. “Ok. At least he did like it that you wrote him, right?”
“Potter.”
Draco was in the middle of a sip of coffee when this last sentence came and he had to struggle not to spit coffee over the whole table. Harry would have spat coffee in the whole table, but luckily he wasn’t drinking at that exact moment.
They were lucky the people approaching talked, because in the middle of all that they would never have heard their footsteps. It was Professors McGonagall and Snape and Filch. Harry and Draco parted for half a second, which was the time Harry took to get his cloak from the ground, and then were embraced again, this time not kissing, but listening attentively. For what they could understand, there had been a lot of gatecrashers, or at least attempts at gatecrashing. Also, someone played some prank with one of Fred and George’s inventions. Harry and Draco saw smoke coming out of Sloghorn’s office when the door was opened and people got out holding their noses shut and complaining about some awful smell. So they could understand clearly that the party was over and everyone was heading to their House towers.
together, and living in Grimmauld Place, the old Black family house.
So Draco was home. With his father. Attending meetings with Death Eaters. Learning how things worked so that he could be one soon. Technically he already was. He had his tattoo. But Draco wasn’t dumb, he knew that didn’t mean anything, really. That didn’t make him respected. His father wasn’t, for chrissake. And Draco would always be his father’s son. Always in his shadow, which included – Draco very quickly realized – getting his share of being despised for his father’s mistakes.
“You’re crazy, Malfoy,” Harry said, not understanding what that was all about.
They mixed their sperms so that they didn’t have to decide who would be the donor, but when the baby was born it was clear whose sperm had won the race. Scorpius had every resemblance to Draco.
When they finally arrived in Draco’s room, Draco as careful as if he was disarming a bomb closed the door and put an imperturbable spell on it. Only then he spoke and in a normal tone. “Okay. So as to your question. You said you could use a mattress,” he explained pointing casually at his bed. Only then did Harry look away from the door and looked around the room. It was big, of course, also decorated in dark tones, and had a massive window through which entered moonlight. Harry looked at Malfoy, remembered his pointing arm at the bed, looked at it, then back at Malfoy. He breathed out a laugh.
Harry knew that wasn’t the best note in which to leave things. But it was for the best.
“C’mon, you’ll see,” said Draco simply. “Hurry,” he added as Harry was still standing in place. Finally, Harry conceded, always untrusting, and followed. Once they were in, Draco closed the door and muttered some words harry could not understand, then opened the door and they were in a dark room, different from the dark Unknowable Room.
Harry listens to a conversation between Draco and Moaning Myrtle at the end of 5th year and can't stop thinking about it all summer long; can't wait to be back at Hogwarts and see Draco again.
Harry follows Draco out of Sloghorn's Christmas party and hears his conversation with Snape;
The scary feeling came again.
“You understand why that is, right?” Harry was actually
Harry heard Draco’s voice in his mind.
“Shut up, you dick,” Draco said, but he too was laughing and he really was amused. “I like it when you call me by my first name, by the way,” he added.
But no, not yet. He would uphold his decision to not have correspondence as long as he was home. He would wait until classes began to communicate with Harry again.
“Yes, a plan. To make me kill him and show my loyalty to Voldemort.”
Draco thought for a moment. “I don’t know. I have no idea.”
. Isn’t it? Well, that’s why I think I’ll go to Gryffindor. Well, too bad yellow is Hufflepuff’s color, cause that’s my favorite color. I could also go to Hufflepuff, maybe. I’m a lot like Hufflepuff, aren’t I, dads?” But his dads didn’t answer, they were still too stupefied to speak. “Dads?” Scorpius asked finally raising his face from his plate.
They stayed still for a second or two, just looking at each other, both smiling. Then both reached for a kiss, long and intense.
“No, you go first. You called me, after all,” Draco said.
“You talk a lot. Is that the best the Slytherin can do for a Seeker? Jeez, tough times I guess,” said Ron.
Harry shrugged. “No. I’ll talk to him when we get there,” he said simply hoping this would be enough to signal he didn’t want to discuss this right now. Or ever.
“What same place?” asked Hermione.
“Ron, should I write Draco a letter? We haven’t said goodbye before leaving, so I don’t know if I should… you know, say something.”
“He didn’t mean it!” Harry blurted out before he could stop himself. It was true, Draco had once brought this up in one of the times they went to his bedroom through the wardrobe.
Harry sighed.
Draco hurried finished putting his left shoe, said “Wait,” and followed.
Harry had his gaze to the ground all the while, watching his own feet move as he walked. His mind was wandering aimlessly, unable to focus. Then a hard push from the back brought him back to reality, he almost fell, but could keep his balance. He got his balance back, turned to see what had happened and saw Draco’s fist hurrying to his face. He had barely understood what was going on when he felt the pain and had his hand holding his bleeding nose.
They stared at each other for some moments. Draco wondered what he should say, if he should say anything. How would Harry take whatever he said. He wouldn’t listen, would he? He wouldn’t want to hear it. Would he?
“He did…”
“Wonder where his mummy is?” Harry said to Ron and Hermione who had seen him too.
They walked toward the lake, none of them said a word the whole way to the margin of the lake.
“What do you mean?”
“Just spill it out what is it that you wanna say to me, Malfoy,” Harry said beginning to get impatient. “I didn’t come cause I didn’t fucking feel like it.” The last words were cut short by Draco’s holding his hand up. Harry was taken aback a little by that, he didn’t expect Draco to have such a bossy attitude. Draco turned finally.
“Nah, dinner is not for a while yet so they won’t let me in the Great Hall, I don’t have anywhere to go right now,” said Ron and laughed a little and then stopped at Harry’s silence and cleared his throat.
Ron chuckled. “Why is that? Because you dated our worst enemy or because you almost killed me with a bear hug?”
Harry shrugged, “You might,” and put his invisibility cloak around his body and disappearing. He took profit of him and Ron being alone in the room to get covered already and head out before their roommates came from the common room. Not that Seamus, Neville and Dean didn’t noticed Harry wasn’t in the room during the nights, but they were in a kind of “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. They never directly mentioned Harry’s absence, so Harry never directly mentioned in front of them that he was leaving Gryffindor Tower after curfew. Much less that he was to be entering
“I hate you,” Draco said simply. He had no energy left to scream. “I hate you, you fucking bastard.” His voice cracked in the last sentence.
“I’m sorry about that,” Harry said.
“You’ve fancied Draco Malfoy?
Harry was the rightful owner of that house ever since his uncle Sirius dies and left it for him, so they decided to go live there. Of course the house needed tons of repairing, but nothing that with the help of the whole of the Weasley family and some more friends they didn’t manage to do after a laborious month of incessant work.
“I can’t
Harry had been trying to make sense of things, but that just didn’t fit. What did that mean? He tried to snoop around the corner of the stall, maybe seeing the scene helped it seem more real, because up to that point it had only felt like a crazy dream.
“I’m sorry for telling you not to send any more letters.”
Would he have an opportunity to meet Harry again? Maybe after all this mess was over. Was this mess going to ever be over? If he depended on it to meet Harry again, his chances were horrible.
“We got together,” Harry repeated. He felt his cheeks reddening, he kept on looking at his feet. He couldn’t dare look at his friends. For the third – and last, he decided – Harry took a deep breath. He spoke in quiet resolution, determined to get this over with. “I don’t know how it happened. It began in the night of Sloghorn’s Christmas party. We were arguing and it just… happened. I don’t know what was it, but I felt like it had always been there, you know?”
Draco hesitated. “I don’t know. I just wanted you to know.” Again a moment of silence. “He told me to go on doing what they asked me,” Draco went on. “To pretend I’m on their side.”
And man was he wrong.
“What?” Harry asked.
His father at first wasn’t enthusiastic about the idea, but Draco’s mother said something about it might being good, since the Headmaster himself had asked that many times. That caught Draco’s attention. He remembered Dumbledore telling him to stick close to Snape. Draco was still a bit bitter about Dumbledore practically refusing Draco’s help when he offered it. But he wanted to give the old man a chance and discover what he meant when telling Draco to go to Snape.
Harry flew a few feet and slid a couple more along the corridor. He stayed there. Draco stayed at his spot. For a while, there was stillness and a silence broken only by Draco’s sobs. A tear streamed down Harry’s face, too. Then another and a third and a fourth. And then Harry was sobbing, too.
“Kinda, a bit.”
Dumbledore had said to him. Could the old man be reading his mind?
of, but still…”
“Ok, buddy, I need to breathe,” said Ron with a suffocated voice. Harry let go.
“We could pretend to be insulting each other when we meet in the hallways. Well, at least then we
, does he? So fuck off, Potter. And go on doing whatever silly unimportant things you do in your miserable life.” Then looking at nowhere in particular, Draco lowered his voice to a mutter, giving away that he was now more speaking out of his reflections than trying to get to Harry, “You can just do whatever you want. You’ll always be the hero in the end anyway. Just do whatever you want, since you can and no one gives a shit.”
Since year one, Draco felt that there was something special about that boy. When the years passed he grew to understand the essence of the attraction Draco felt for Harry, and he hated it. He hated to be feeling it, he hated that Harry would never feel it back. So he hated Potter.
afraid of his father intercepting one of the letters; Draco would have
“No,” Harry answered simply.
As Draco was in his room packing his things, he couldn’t help replaying in his mind the last conversation Harry and he had had in the third floor corridor.
Harry was taken a little aback by that last part. Before he knew he was surprised to be speaking, but he was surprised less for being speaking and more for realizing that he had somehow pushed aside his hatred for Malfoy and was speaking from a place he didn’t like to admit he had deep down – a place of pity for Malfoy. One thing that the conversation he heard had suggested, and that Harry had deliberately ignored, was that Draco wasn’t happy doing whatever he was doing, like he was being forced. So, thinking about this, Harry said in an equal mutter, “You can, too, you know. You don’t need to do anything you don’t want to.”
They both took support on their elbows and faced each other lying on the ground.
“If some years ago someone told me I would be making a little personal heaven out of a dorm room in
“I just wanted to tell you that I talked with Dumbledore. I asked him for guidance…”
Harry, turning to Draco, “Oh, no, of course not.”
“Yeah it wasn’t ideal,” Draco continued. “But the circumstances were complicated, I guess.”
Only one week later did Harry see Draco for more than two seconds as he passed in a hallway or entered a classroom. That was because Draco was avoiding encountering Harry as much as he could, confused and embarrassed as he was. There was another thing, too. If they encountered in the hallways, when there were other people, Draco would be expected to insult Harry, to verbally attack him, his friends, his family, his friend’s family, his “blood status”, well, just about everything. And the thing was, Draco didn’t feel like it. He didn’t want to do that anymore. He never felt comfortable doing it in the first place. But he did what he was “supposed to do”.
Draco laughed a little and nodded. “Yeah, I guess.”
“I don’t know. I just do. I don’t understand it either. I think I’ve always felt that the way he acted wasn’t genuine, too.”
“And you do?” Draco asked.
“In fact,” Draco continued, “I’m staying very far away from you idiots.”
didn’t
“Yeah,” Harry said.
He didn’t cut Harry off or anything. He talked a bit of how things were for him at home and said that he hadn’t told his father yet, so, because he was afraid his father might see one of the letter and ask questions, it would be better if they didn’t communicate just yet, and waited for the classes to come back. And he wasn’t lying. He
“Whew, yeah, that would be tough.” The air seemed to become heavier at the silence that followed so to try and change the subject Harry said matter-of-factly, “Well, anyway. Never thought I’d say that, but sucks that you’re not a Gryffindor. I could really use a mattress. Not that much comfort on the ground, is there?”
Draco turned back to the girl. “He says he might.”
’s they went to casual chitchat, to conversations… to holding hands.
“Nothing,” said Draco a little embarrassed, moving his hands away.
“Dad Draco even confronted his own father to be with you, Dad Harry. That must have been scary.” A chill ran all over Draco’s body only at the memory of how it felt back then to face his father. “And I admire that, so I think I’ll probably be sorted into Gryffindor. Cause you said the Sorting Hat sorts us based on the values we
He went to his room but could barely stay put. He wished that taking a nap hadn’t been just an excuse and that he could really fall asleep, but Harry was way too agitated. It soon began to get dark and Harry headed to the great hall in the hopes of having dinner earlier than they used to so that he wouldn’t meet Ron and Hermione there. He just couldn’t bear to look at them, he felt like he’d betrayed them.
Now he saw that his attitude wasn’t ideal and that he shouldn’t’ve treated Draco the way that he did all that time. He regretted it, he really did. But he decided it was better this way because it would make their relation, affair, or whatever that was, have a stronger sense of being over. Draco would hate him, that would make it easier for him to forget Harry. Knowing that would make it easier to Harry to forget that and focus on the matter at hand. Which was a crazy mission he had gotten himself into. He needed to focus on finding those Horcruxes. He needed to focus on defeating Voldemort. There were really serious things going on. He couldn’t let his mind wander in things like relationships and etc.
“What are you doing?” Whispered Harry as he arrived at the meeting place and found Malfoy there waiting for him. “Why here?”
Could it be… that Draco was getting… better? Could it be that the thing that was going on between him and Harry was having good results? Was Malfoy changing as a result or because of Harry?
She finally found Ginny and Luna inside Honeydukes. The two of them were drifting between the shelves, hands tightly clasped together. Hermione noticed that the two of them, much like Draco and Harry, liked to keep constant contact with each other’s marks. Hermione wondered what it must feel like. The way the two couples engaged in it, it didn’t seem sexual, just comforting. The habit also didn’t seem to be practiced by every bonded couple. She had found herself watching Dean and Seamus as well, and they did not seem to have the obsession with touching each other’s Marks like the newer couples did. Perhaps the marvel faded with time.
“You’ll get used to it,” Harry assured him. Draco hoped he never did.
Harry was referencing the Quidditch match the Slytherins had finagled themselves out of the previous year.
Harry sighed at the reminder, their laughter echoed down the stairwell as they retreated back to their room two floors up. Harry went back into his dormitory, hoping Ron had gone downstairs. Thankfully he had, Harry grabbed his journal and noticed it was warm to the touch.
Millie smirked, reaching up and pinching his cheek. Draco batted her hand way and pinched her side in retaliation.
“Thanks,” Draco sneered, snatching the book from him and paging through it idly. Longbottom stood there for a moment, looking lost, before he squeaked and left. Draco leafed through the pages realizing the book focused on different ingredients found in Herbology often used in Potions.
Harry took a good look at him. Malfoy had a massive red mark covering half his face, and on both of his exposed hands and forearms were a myriad of cuts and red welts.
“Last I checked she’s bonded. I could reach out to Daddy Parkinson to draw something up with the second youngest Weasley, if Draco concedes. Come to think of it, I believe all of the other Weasley children are unbonded. Take your pick,” Theo shot back and she flicked egg at him.
“Draco, can you cast another charm,” Pansy asked, throwing her arms around his neck, her eyes wide.
“Didn’t go well then?” She asked needlessly.
“No need, I feel the same way,” Harry whispered, his fingers also coming up to caress across the moon on Draco’s chest. It seemed like the moment they were safely in each other’s presence; the buttons on their shirts came apart. Harry couldn’t quite explain the feeling just seeing Draco’s mark brought him, let alone when he could touch it. Although, if Harry was being honest with himself, it still felt like he was stealing biscuits from the jar whenever he was allowed to touch another person this frequently. Draco kept having to tell him he was always allowed to touch him when they were alone, Harry had not quite gotten used to initiating contact.
“What is so urgent?” He asked his head whipping to each side to check if anyone had noticed them speaking in the shadows.
“So let’s promise to be honest, even when it’s hard. I loathe that someone else knows more about you than I do. Rationally, it’s obvious your friends should know you better. It’s not like I have ever tried to know the real you more than the one I created in my head, but that’s no excuse moving forward.”
“I’m sure I have no idea what you’re on about,” He smirked and dropped some ingredients into his cauldron.
“That’s my tie, Pans,” Draco grit out, dipping her slightly to make her lose the absolute look of delight on her face.
Draco noticed Harry had been becoming more and more jaded towards the Headmaster. No doubt aided by Draco’s open distrust towards the man, and surprisingly, Harry had told Draco how often Sirius ranted about the Headmaster. Draco had even read a few letters where Sirius was none too kind towards the old man. Draco felt sort of bad, but at the same time, Harry was right to be wary. The shady things Dumbledore did were just beginning to add up more and more.
“You all right, Harry?” Hermione asked and Harry nodded, trying to force down his blush of embarrassment.
Draco shrugged, “There’s no point anymore. I was not subtle at all at the Task, and now we’ve both been missing for 2 days. Most people will be able to put two and two together.”
To Draco’s surprise Theo snorted again, “Nah I just risked my arse against three of- age wizards to save your boyfriend because I felt it was ‘the right thing to do’. Fuck no! I mean, do I think you two are completely mad? Absolutely. But he could definitely do worse. And any person that changes you for the better in the way that he has over the past nine months is a good one in my book. I know it may not seem like a lot to you, but what you did with your dad? That was really fucking brave. You fucking exposed what those pieces of dragon shit have done to us our whole lives. People noticed. People said that it wasn’t okay. If what you did keeps Senior away from even just one Cruciatus this summer, I’m in your debt.”
Draco felt like an absolute prat for the corniness of what he was about to say, but couldn’t bring himself to care, “Nothing about you is ugly, shut the fuck up, that’s my soul-mate you’re insulting.”
Draco was sure he was going to vibrate out of his body with anticipation as he waited for Harry. Finally after he almost finished the potion altogether, he felt Harry’s emotions getting closer. Draco wrapped up the step he was on, setting a timer for the potion to brew, before turning towards the door and waiting. With a quiet click the door cracked open and Harry’s familiar mop of dark hair became visible. He closed the door behind him, pointing his wand at it and muttering a spell.
“Was there anything said about a Portkey?” Draco asked urgently, trying to ignore the pain still present.
“The elf won’t try to take you against your will?” Harry asked, his mind zipping through every worst-case scenario possible.
A few moments later Harry was dressed and looking almost brand new. Most of the blood and grit washed from his body and face. His skin tone back to the golden shade Draco was accustomed to.
“I’m sorry if it was excruciating for you,” Draco murmured. “Yes, Lucius cast it a few times. I’ll be fine. This is not the first time he has done it. I think he might have put a little extra into it though. Although it might just be the amount of time since I was subjected to it. I didn’t go home for Christmas as I normally do.”
It took longer than Draco wanted, but finally Harry made it to the classroom. He came through the door, locking it behind him and whirling to see Draco, a bright smile on his face.
Hermione was a logical person. She thrived on order and when the pieces in a puzzle lined up. So when Hermione started noticing something off about her newest friend, she began her observation.
“You’re absolutely freezing,” Hermione said her voice climbing several octaves. She began melting the snow around them, drying Draco’s clothes, and setting a Warming Charm. Draco’s eyesight was beginning to focus as he watched Hermione unwind the scarf she had been wearing and scoop snow into it from a few feet away before pressing it to his face.
Draco couldn’t even be surprised that Harry would have the luck to get the worst and most vicious dragon of the bunch, because of course he would. Draco wasn’t sure how often he breathed throughout the entire time Harry faced the Horntail, and a sharp ache was centred behind each of his temples from the stress of the day. Draco heard Harry bellow the Summoning Charm all the way from where he was in the stands, and then it was just a matter of Harry waiting to see if the spell worked.
Hermione very hesitantly reached over and pressed her pointer finger against the bundle of twigs. They both gasped as she made contact.
“Hey,” Draco said, catching his hand. Harry suspected he must have felt the crazy whirl of emotions inside of him through the bond. Harry stared at their clasped hands.
Hogwarts would always be his home, but as he followed Draco down the steps, their fingers intertwined and his other hand sliding over the cap in his pocket, he realized home was turning out to be less of a place and more of a person.
“He’s also furious I haven’t bonded. He organized for me to touch hands with every suitable Pureblooded girl the moment we were all the correct age. It’s a massive thorn in his side than ‘I’m being stubborn’.”
Draco frowned sheepishly, “Sorry, only last night, I’m just clingy.”
Harry finally broke the silence, “Your potion is getting messed up.”
Nott seemed to understand what he said though because realization dawned on his face, he threw Harry’s arm over his shoulder, hauling him to his feet and dragging Harry in the direction of Hagrid’s cabin.
“That’s disgusting,” Ron said through clenched teeth, grabbing Hermione and pulling her between Fred and himself.
“So, what? You hated me the last three years, that doesn’t suddenly go away!”
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at him, "I'll make a Slytherin out of you yet."
Draco opened his mouth to retort, but was cut off by a surprising voice.
“If I remember correctly, he did insult your mother at the beginning of the year. Two birds, one stone, as they say.”
“You two are bloody brilliant!”
“He does that,” He cackled and Hermione looked between the two of them rapidly. This had happened more than once?
“Never,” Draco said his eyes landing on Weasley as he helped Harry to the washroom. Draco half supported and half carried him out of the room and heard Weasley’s voice carry to him as he shut the door.
Harry was silent for awhile and Draco finally looked at him, surprised at the closed off look on his face.
Draco was going insane. It had been over a week and Draco had not been able to meet up with Harry. He had spent the entire time trying to figure out how Harry had done it; he had also tried to funnel his energy towards figuring out how to cover the soul-bond but had come up empty. Nothing in the library was very helpful, and he could not risk getting a book from the Manor without drawing attention from his parents.
"It’ll be perfect, I brewed it didn’t I? You can stop getting your knickers in a twist."
Hermione barely stopped Neville from putting butterfly wings instead of moth’s wings into their potion. Unfortunately in front of them, Ron made the same mistake. His and Harry’s potion crackled violently, like tossing water onto boiling oil and Snape swooped in.
**********************
“Draco, sit,” Father commanded.
“Leave your hand on his chest,” Pomfrey warned before pointing her wand at Draco. Moments later, Draco gasped, eyes flying open. He made to sit up and was stopped by Harry, his eyes flew down to his bare chest, and then to Pomfrey.
"Who cares? You heard what Moody said, he was trying to curse one of us. Better him than us," Ron shrugged and made his way into the Great Hall.
Draco set the two objects down on the desk and made himself comfortable in Lucius’ chair. If he was going to take on the Head of House duties, he might as well act the part. He plucked a hair from his head, and pulled the vial with Harry’s hair from his robes. He twirled the two pieces together, thankful for the length of each of their hair. This would have been much more difficult if they had shaved heads.
The other part that bothered him was that Malfoy hadn't even been the one making fun of Ron, which was out of character within itself. Harry found it hard to believe he would have cursed Harry or Ron with their backs turned. Malfoy was at least always up front about their confrontations.
Draco rolled the eye that wasn’t covered by the ice pack and flapped a hand at her, “I promise I’ll be fine. I have potion I can take in my lab should the need arise. I’m just tired. My cheek will bruise and I’ll have a wicked black eye. Feel free to tell everyone it was Lucius. I can’t wait until Severus finds out.”
Have a great week.
They filed into the stands, and waited for the Task to begin. Draco could see a white tent like at the First task that he presumed the champions were waiting in. Finally, they filed out after Dumbledore and the rest of the Tournament organizers.
“You didn’t say what you meant about Hagrid being a giant,” Harry persisted, brow furrowed.
“Okay. I need to figure out how to Apparate. I think that’s the solution here.”
Twin smirks raised on their faces, “You want us to prank one of your housemates?”
“Sorry your chest is a little moist, here,” Draco whispered a soft incantation and Harry felt a rush of hot air hit his chest. “I got a little weepy last night, no worries, all is well.” Draco was silent for a moment and the hand in his hair disappeared and grasped his hand tightly. “I love you, Harry,” His lips moved against the back of his hand as they formed the words, then they pressed against it in a brief kiss. Harry found himself able to squeeze Draco’s fingers back, a few moments later he blinked his eyes open, squinting into the light. Draco’s blurry blond head loomed over him.
“Looking back it was quite funny. She barely slapped me; Hermione hit me way harder, at any rate.”
Harry stared out at the sea of tents stretching as far as he could see in every direction; he briefly closed his eyes and opened them again. He could barely believe that he was here, at the Quidditch World Cup. It was one thing to be surrounded my magic at school, but here it felt absolutely surreal. So many magical beings, all in one place, all there to enjoy their favourite sport.
In that moment Harry desperately wanted to come clean, but knew he wasn’t ready yet. Ron wasn’t ready yet.
Draco couldn’t believe how lucky he had gotten.
Draco brought his hands up to his face and scrubbed hard, “I wasn’t even trying to curse her or you. If I’m being honest I was aiming for Weasley, but he’s being awful to you, he deserved it! I didn’t want to call her that name, but I can’t just stop overnight. I was drawing suspicion. You have no idea how hard I’m scrutinized! I’m drowning over here trying to balance it all!” Draco burst, grabbing the pillow from beneath his head and smothering himself with it. “I’m lost; I don’t know what I’m doing!” His last words muffled by the pillow.
Harry  followed his eyeline and looked down at his hands; small yellow fizzles of light sparked erratically from his palms.
“I just don’t understand, and don’t tell me it doesn’t matter. You’re terrified.”
Harry was impressed by the effort Ron was putting in towards his friendships with the Slytherins. Harry supposed now being bonded to one helped. Hermione, Ron, and Pansy had been slowly but surely getting to know one another more. Unfortunately, the timing of summer hols hadn’t helped. It hadn’t even been 48 hours since they had bonded. Hopefully Draco would be able to get his license to Apparate and then things would be easier. Pansy would also be able to freely use the Floo to get to the Weasleys, it was just a matter of her parents allowing her to. Draco had said that her parents would not be pleased she bonded with a Bloodtraitor and a Muggleborn. Harry had asked if Pansy could do the same thing Draco had done. Unfortunately, along with being bigoted, Pureblood culture was also very misogynistic. Pansy would not be able to take on the Head due to her being female.
Remus was also looking a lot better than when he had been Harry’s professor. The bags under his eyes weren’t nearly as prominent, and he simply looked more alive.
"Nothing to be done about it now, he walked away, I’m sure he’s fine. Let's go eat."
Alexis
“Rita Skeeter? I didn’t realize you even knew about the shit she was spreading.”
“There’s nothing quite like it,” Draco said his voice lower than a whisper. Harry squeezed his hand as hard as he could. He hated the idea of Draco having felt the pain before, especially now that he knew what it felt like.
Around him, he felt the shadows of the magic used within the Manor as well as from Lucius’ wand flare up. He witnessed shadows of the Cruciatus used over and over just a few feet from where he stood within the web. Years of Lucius casting it on him. He watched as a small book, ensconced in Darkness, was taken from the study, Lucius’ magic lingering around it. Countless other spells lit up around him all tinged with Darkness.
“Why can’t I ever have anything fucking nice? The second Sirius steps into my life, he has to live on the run! My first mostly relaxing year, and I get signed into a death tournament! I find my goddamned soul-mate, and of course I can’t have him. I’m so fucking done.”
“You sure you’re going to be able to not hide any details?” Harry teased turning fully towards him, Draco bit his lip.
They made it to the Owlery in record time and Draco pulled out a piece of parchment, quickly scribing a note to the store in Knockturn Alley that would be able to get him what he needed.
“Is that what he has done to you?”
“What will make you feel better?”
Severus inclined his head and Draco nodded, returning to the Hall.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry sighed; he hadn’t thought of how much harder this would all be for Draco. No one really truly questioned Harry, they might be curious or suspicious he was up to something, but in the end Harry knew everything would be fine if his friends found out about Draco. Draco did not have that same luxury. That didn’t mean he could just forgive Draco for calling Hermione that awful slur. He had been called enough slurs growing up in his Aunt and Uncle’s house for something he couldn’t control; he couldn’t just let Draco get away with it just because things were tough.
"I just don’t think Malfoy would have cursed us, Zabini was the one yelling at Ron. I don’t know why Moody said he did."
Draco smirked now, leaning into the ice pack and Harry’s hand. “I’m not particular about what it looks like if it gets the job done.”
"Yeah, cheers to the two of you. Can't thank you enough for helping after the Ball."
“Staring at the water, freezing my bollocks off, and feeling every little thing that happened to you but having no reference to what it may be, definitely wasn’t very fun. I have to admit.”
“Yes, quite disheartening indeed. I feel the best solution to this conundrum would be removing the Dementors from Azkaban, as a first step,” Dumbledore interjected.
“Not all of us have been flying since we were able to walk,” Harry commented with a meaningful look.
“You feel your best mate’s little sister growing colder and colder on the floor of some disgusting chamber with a snake taller than a house attacking you, and no one fucking comes to save you! You get bitten by that snake and feel acid flowing through your body, feel your organs slowly, agonizingly shutting down one by one. Then you tell your best mate’s little sister to go, even if that means dying alone in the literal sewer, so she doesn’t have to watch someone just a year older than her die. No one fucking comes! A fucking bird comes before any grownups do! So, no I wasn’t leaving that little girl down there! I’d do it a-fucking-gain. I’m sorry you had to feel that, but I was not leaving her there!”
“So he probably hasn’t said anything because of who Malfoy is.”
Draco burst out laughing, “He told you to bathe with it?”
“Almost lunch,” Draco supplied. Resolving to keep the promise he had made the day before.
Ginny and Luna bonded! Congrats to those of you who guessed correctly!! I hope everyone likes their mark, I put a lot of thought into it. So Luna is officially introduced to our story and we got a taste of what Hermione is thinking. Draco and Harry are still 100% our most likely POVs but I will sprinkle in some others occasionally.
Harry waved his hand at him dismissively, unfolding layers on the paper before groaning loudly. “You’re definitely going to need my help; it looks like every single professor is out on patrol.”
Ron’s eyes widened slightly at the scene. “Er, sorry, it’s just everyone is starting to go down to the train…”
“I’m sorry, but it is clear you are being more than taken care of here,” Sirius stated before bending down and pulling Harry into a fierce hug. “I am never more than an owl away.”
Hermione worried her lip again with her teeth, he was seeming back to himself. Harry was burying his face in Draco’s shoulder.
“What do I need to do to show you how sorry I am? I had to do what I did, but I feel awful for it. If Pomfrey made you stay, you don’t have to now. I won’t force you to stay here and listen to me, to touch me,” Draco said, resignation in his voice.
spell, but nothing but a few weak sparks had come from his wand.
Draco moved forward and carefully pressed Harry’s glasses to his face, Harry blinked a few times before a small appreciative smile was aimed at Draco.
“Take your glasses off if you’re going to do that, you’ll injure your face,” Draco chastised and Harry chuckled wetly. “Oh don’t cry over me, you sap, I’m fine. Don’t get your knickers in a twist.”
Happy Monday everyone! The last week has been insanity. I hope everyone has been staying safe and sane. Here we had some big boy talks between our fave couple. I felt like it was time Harry explicitly told Draco about his upbringing. I headcanon (as yall have probably assumed) that Harry was treated pretty badly by the Dursleys since the books are mostly vague. As yall also already know, Lucius is not father of the year either.
“Sweets?”
“It’s the only thing my brain can comprehend right now, because the idea of a 12-year-old just accepting the fact that he was going to die alone in the dungeons of his school isn’t getting through currently. I know you’re furious with me, and I deserve it, but can I hug you, please?”
Also I finally get to show Ron not being a complete and total ass. Just to be clear, this is not a Ron-bashing story. I love Ron. He just had a lot of growing up to do 4th year and he isn't the most likable character in the 4th book. We will see some growth. If you hate Ron, well sorry, this is still primarily Drarry, and that's what you're here for.
“Sorry it took me so long, I couldn’t get out of Gryffindor,” He mumbled. “Are you wondering how I did it too?”
“He’s torturing him,” Draco sobbed.
“No, just feelings,” Draco said shaking his head.
“Mr. and Mr. Weasley my office immediately!” McGonagall shouted over the din, her voice carrying in that way that was unique to a professor that had taught for most of their adult life. They simultaneously bowed before hopping off the table and leaving the hall.
“Why would you even want to? It seems like an injury or worse waiting to happen!” Neville said as he got changed into his pyjamas.
“Not at all,” Draco plopped back down onto the chair he had taken residence in. “I’m just happy to see you awake again.”
“That’s not even the biggest thing!” Pansy gushed, “Guess who was able to resist it?”
“Merry Christmas boys,” Draco greeted before grabbing a present.
Draco snorted, “Like I’d go anywhere else.”
“I wouldn’t miss it,” Draco promised, leaning down and pressing his lips to Harry’s forehead, then ducking further and pressing his lips to Harry’s before straightening. He quickly buttoned Harry’s top and squeezed his hand once before disappearing through the curtains. Harry sighed, plopping his head back against the pillows. He could hear Pomfrey escorting Draco out and was once again thankful about how helpful she had been towards the pair of them. Harry didn’t know what Draco would have done if she hadn’t covered for him. Hopefully Hermione would have helped someway.
Some thoughts on whether or not Draco will be at the bottom of the lake. Are they correct in their logic? Only time will tell. We get some more Draco and Hermione friendship because I love them. Poor Hermione finally gets a friend who is as passionate about their studies as she is (so does Draco if we're being honest). Then some fun banter, because I needed some light-hearted Drarry this week.
“Calm down, this is a business venture. I am in need of your services.”
“Potter is with the Headmaster. Barty Crouch Jr. was polyjuicing as Moody the entire year! I knew my stores had been pilfered!” Severus spit, looking incredibly put out.
“Harry, hey look at me, love, open your eyes,” Draco commanded. Harry did as he was told, his eyes linking with Draco’s, recognition blossoming. “It’s me love, remember, you’re safe. I won’t let anything happen to you right now. We’re just going to get cleaned up. That’s what you wanted, right?”
“I actually don’t know if I’ve ever noticed.”
“Could only be one person, really, and it makes a bunch of things from this year make sense. Are you okay?”
Harry couldn’t stop staring at Malfoy. He was already in his school robes; his uniform perfectly put together, not a button undone or tie askew. Harry figured he must have come to the station like that, to get away with not changing on the train. Harry had considered it, but figured it would have been more out of character than if he ducked out to get changed in the loo. Malfoy stared back, his eyes fixed on the bruise on his cheek.
Harry had been wearing a faded Chudley Cannons shirt to training but with how much of a sweat they had worked up, it had become a little see-through. An obvious soul-mark leaking through.
“That’s what Apparition is. There’s no spell, just focus. I’m sure loads of magic is like that, at its core.”
“Glad to see you’re in one piece,” Pansy affirmed looking at Harry. Her gaze switched to Draco, “Hercules has already been by with a letter.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry squinted at him, “What the Canary Creams? Yeah it was hilarious, glad you and Pansy were able to avoid it. I’m still wondering what Zabini did to Fred and George.”
Dun dun DUUUUUUN. That's what I thought after that last line anyways.
Draco couldn’t quell his curiosity any longer; he got up and walked to Harry, looking down at the parchment. “Harry, what the fuck?”
Draco’s fingers instantly went to brush across his chest, like a magnet drawn to iron.
Harry stared, he couldn’t help it. Malfoy’s mark took up as much space as Harry's. It spanned the entire left hand side of his chest, the exact same spot as Harry’s. The moon was as detailed and elaborate as his sun. With swirls of purple and blue spiraling out from each side. Harry found himself unbuttoning the rest of his shirt as well and heard Malfoy gasp a quiet intake of breath.
Draco did fall to his side now, warm blood flowing down his face and into the snow, staining it crimson. Draco was reeling. Father did not normally leave physical marks. He had apparently royally infuriated him.
Harry hesitantly reached forward, looking up into Malfoy’s eyes as he moved his hand closer. Malfoy didn’t move to step away or stop him and Harry carefully trailed his fingers across the mark. Harry noticed it felt a lot like when he touched a blanket fresh out of Aunt Petunia’s dryer, which she had insisted on getting to show the neighbours she was better than them. Harry secretly thought she just didn’t like having her under things drying in the backyard on the line.
“I don’t ever want you to block me out. You’re who has kept me sane through this year. I don’t know what I’d do without you. You put up with me, my crazy emotions, the Tasks. You’re friends with Hermione. You defend me, you’ve changed your whole life for me. Please don’t shut me out,” He pleaded. Draco bit his lip, still silent, but Harry felt his emotions flow back through.
Blaise and Greg laughed, “Yeah, you know how he is.” Theo had a historic reputation for being hard to get out of bed.
“I’ll take the bloody potion if it makes you stop crying. I just don’t want to waste it. Seriously I am okay,” Draco groaned, pushing Harry off as he sat up. Hermione didn’t miss the way the colour fled from his face as he became vertical.  He looked down at Harry, brushing his thumb across Harry’s cheeks.
Harry thought that was quite mature of Ron.
“What did he curse him with? You figured it out,” Harry accused, grabbing onto her hand as he picked up the pace so he didn’t leave her behind. Hermione let herself be dragged, she wanted to get there as fast as possible.
“Let’s sit with your House,” Draco suggested as they got closer to the Great Hall.
Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes at Theo. At least he had been betting on Harry since the beginning so it wasn’t out of character. Blaise turned away to talk to Millie and Theo leaned in close to Draco’s ear.
“It’s not a secret. You Gryffindors just don’t bother to learn anything outside your precious house do you?”
Sudden gasps and screams made Harry turn around; Moody was behind them, his wand pointed at a snow white ferret. He was using his wand to levitate and slam the poor animal repeatedly against the ground.
“Let me go!” She screamed; her voice heavily accented. “You took my sister; I must get her! Let me go!” She fought against where Madame Maxime was clutching her. The exposed skin of Fleur’s forearms and calves were covered in red welts and the wet suit they had all been wearing was torn in places.
Harry frowned, crossing his arms, "I'm doing everything I can."
“I figured out how to keep you from drowning!” Draco said pulling away so as to not make Pansy feel completely awkward.
He had called Granger a Mudblood in Potions class. He knew how much it bothered her and Harry, but his friends had began harassing him out about it. They had been teasing him that he had an infatuation with muggles now, since he had cleaned up his vocabulary. As much as he knew Harry would be upset, he needed to do what had been done. There was no way it could get back to his Father that there was anything suspicious going on. His Father asked him every letter if he had found his soul-mate, reiterating how important it was to find a suitable bond-mate, like Draco could fucking control it.
“Yeah, we can normally get Mum and Dad to agree at about his birthday,” Weasley pointed out.
“Okay...?”
Draco stared at his Father, turning over the words inside his head. He was interrupted from responding as Hermione, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood entered the pub. His eyes narrowed; Hermione had known he was meeting his Father here. What was she doing?
“Shh, it’s me. I’m sorry, but I just needed to tell you something before you went down,” Hermione hastened to get out.
Harry still had no idea what to say, he shrugged, “It’s fine now, though. I solved the Dementor issue. No worries.”
Pansy was fixing tea when he sat down and he noticed she had no other food on her plate, he leaned down nestling into her neck as if he was kissing her.
“Cowardly…”
"Nah, don’t worry about it. I'll be sleeping anyways. Thanks though," Harry said hurriedly turning towards the steps.
“The feeling is mutual, I assure you.”
“Fuck that! I still don’t know you’re not the one who did it!”
Harry nodded, unbuttoning the top of Draco’s shirt as well. “I ran into Cedric earlier today.”
"Is this how it's always going to be?” Harry whispered.  “Seamus and Dean never said anything about how this feels." Harry hastily loosened his tie and threw it off. He felt like he was suffocating.
“It’s dumb,” Harry muttered, but shook his head. “Anyways, what’s your favourite colour? I’ve always assumed green.” He got up from his chair and tugged Draco to the floor onto their mountain of pillows and blankets.
“Sod off, Malfoy,” Hermione sighed, finally reaching her limit. She raised her wand and quickly slammed the door shut before Malfoy could say another word. “I wish they would grow up.”
“Potter,” Blaise guessed, annoyance filling his tone.
Draco had been searching and racking his brain for a solution to his problems. He had known there was no way he could return to the Manor this summer; he knew Mother would not be able to keep him safe from Lucius for long. He also knew he wouldn’t be able to bare being away from Harry that long. He had searched every ancient Pureblood text he could get his hands on the past few months, completely in secret. He hadn’t wanted to worry Harry with how much he already had on his plate, and couldn’t bare his disappointment should Draco fail.
“You need the post-Cruciatus potion,” Hermione piped up. She had read all about the Three Unforgiveables after their class with Moody. It had specifically said that to ensure lack of nerve or brain damage, taking the potion within 90 minutes of exposure would greatly increase recovery of the victim.
Draco was laying on the green couch that had recently appeared. Harry had told her Parkinson had transfigured it, and Hermione had to be impressed with her spell work. It looked just as comfortable as any other couch that she had seen, she wouldn’t have even guessed it was transfigured.
“I do, but that’s hardly the point. We’re an absolute mess,” He sniffed, rooting around for his wand. He pointed it at himself mumbling a spell and suddenly all of the sand and other debris vanished from his body. Harry was still distracted by the way Malfoy’s hair fell around his face, no longer in its normal slicked back style. Malfoy pointed his wand up at his head, and Harry grabbed his arm.
“Harry, you should try going back to sleep,” Mrs. Weasley prodded gently.
“It was like you knew it was going to happen,” Hermione said in awe from across from them.
“So you saw it too?” Remus asked after they finished putting the Shack back together and Sirius nodded.
“Oh thank fuck, he’s home,” Nott gasped as Harry dimly noticed light coming from up ahead. “Don’t take this the wrong way, but I’m dropping you there. He’d think it was me. Sorry, but you know I’m right.”
“Harry, it was the Cruciatus, it’s the only thing that makes sense.”
“If he is back, he is fine. You must stay here until we figure out who has been trying to harm him. He escaped, but you are vulnerable should anyone have caught on what you are to him. I will go, you will stay and I shall return to collect you.”
“Diggory is dead, isn’t he?” Draco whispered, the sorrow Harry had been feeling, clicking.
A few minutes later Malfoy strode down the path, his head held high, his normal sneer present on his face.
Draco’s heart fell into the pit of his stomach. Dread filling him for what Harry was going to no doubt experience, he hoped his meeting with Sirius had ended up being far, far away.
“Why on earth would you think that?” Draco asked, tracing his fingers over Harry’s mark.
“Ancient Runes is quite fun, actually,” Draco called after him, affronted.
“All right, Hermione?” Harry asked setting his tower of books down.
“She’s quite good at a lot of things, you just have to give her a chance. A lot of the Slytherins come off as terrible but it’s just how they protect themselves. They’re used to people hating them on principle. Most of their home lives are as great as mine and Draco’s.”
Hermione bit her lip before sighing, "Actually I knew."
“Well, I’m not kissing him, if that’s what you’re asking,” Sirius commented, but reached out a hand towards Severus. Severus grasped it before recoiling quickly. Draco thought he was acting rather childish.
Draco looked hard into the Headmaster’s eyes, briefly glancing at the curtain before bringing his eyes back to Dumbledore’s icy blue ones. “Yes, I determined protecting myself and those I care about as a top priority.”
Draco forced a smile, “Thank you, but I’ll be fine.”
“Favouritism will only take you so far,” Harry teased. “McGonagall wouldn’t hesitate to give me detention for a month, and take points.”
“How are you defying him? No one knows about us.”
Draco bumped her shoulder with his.
Draco was furious.
“Oh no! Those are really nice ones too; do you want us to come with you?” Ginny asked and Hermione shook her head.
“Why was I packing by hand again?” Harry asked, slightly annoyed. They could have been snogging instead of wasting time packing his trunk.
“What were you even doing last night, Harry, you didn’t get back until so late,” Ron asked and Harry made a point of taking a massive bite of his breakfast sandwich, chewing meticulously.
“Yes well, godsons get even more leeway.”
Ginny wrenched the arm of her sweater up, looking down at what looked like the blueish-white trail a Patronus left behind with small seeds dancing through. It gave Harry the impression of dandelion seeds floating through the air. Luna carefully did the same, pushing her sleeve up as high as it would go. On Luna’s arm was the entanglement of what Harry thought were the vines or leaves of a plant snaking all of the way from her fingers up towards her shoulder.
There was no doubt that the other two Headmasters had definitely given their students a head’s up on what the task was, and Draco was momentarily thankful that Hagrid had clued in Harry. He could only imagine what would have happened if Harry had not been able to strategize beforehand. The elaborate spell that Delacour cast on her Welsh Green had been impressive to say the least, although Draco had not shared in the excitement of some of his peers when they saw her skirt catch fire. Savages, the lot of them, the girl was on fire for Merlin’s sake.
Draco nodded, he was sitting up completely in bed now, most of the colour had returned to his skin. “Yeah, a lot better."
What do yall think Draco's solution was going to be to get Harry back? What do you think is happening to Draco? How will they fix it? Will anyone figure out about Harry and Draco? (Spoiler Alert: at least one person does!!!)
“What is going on here?” McGonagall yelled as she burst through the crowd watching the ferret fly into the air over and over.
“I was up in the Owlery. That’s why I’m late, my apologies.”
Harry’s voice was harder than she’d ever heard it, “I’ll fucking kill him,” he vowed. Hermione couldn’t help but agree.
Harry’s face shuttered, the mask Hermione was familiar with for when Harry was incredibly upset fell into place. The rest of their sprint back to the Castle was spent in silence.
“What did you do to the Weasleys?” Draco asked as he sipped at his tea. The rainbow-Blaise-canary was not able to respond with words, but did squawk irritably.
"Malfoy, I-"
“Her transfiguration skills are quite impressive,” Hermione mumbled, her eyes still glued to her arm.
“Well, I – “ Ron was swiftly cut off with a groan as Harry suspected Hermione had kicked him underneath the table. “I mean, yeah, bang out of line.”
Harry pecked him on the lips once more before pulling the cloak off of Draco and disappearing.
Harry nodded, biting his lip. He took a breath and steadied himself, and then slowly unbuttoned his shirt, pulling it to the side and revealing his mark. Hermione gasped, her hands flying to her mouth.
Harry blushed and looked down at his plate but heard Ginny groan again. “Yeah two years ago! Merlin Ron!”
“Politics. Lucius pretty much bankrolls Fudge’s administration. It’d be a shame if he no longer had enough funding to run for reelection.”
Again, I am so thankful for everyone for supporting my writing. It's been a struggle to keep up with this the last couple weeks because I caught up to what I had chronologically written previously. Thankfully I have more written, the tough part is connecting it and making sure it works. I should be okay for a bit, I just hope this story still sparks joy for you all. Stay safe, and take care of yourselves.
“You’d better, you sap,” Draco commented fondly. Grabbing Hermione’s essay so that he could correct it before he went back to his Common Room.
“How’d it go?” Hermione asked and Draco rolled his eyes.
“It’s a muggle ice pack, it’s all I could think of,” Harry apologized and Draco smirked.
Draco trekked across the grounds, questioning who the fuck thought a task in February should include the Lake. Whoever they were, they were getting paid far too much in his opinion.
Nott pointed his wand at him and for a brief moment Harry thought he was going to curse him before he realized the wand was actually pointed at Hagrid’s door. Nott cast a stunning curse at the door, resulting in a loud bang that set Fang howling and loud footsteps pounded toward the door. When Harry looked back Nott was gone.
Harry wondered if they practiced how they said things, or if it just came naturally.
She had gestured to the bed directly next to Harry’s curtained off one, and Draco gratefully collapsed onto it. He used the hand he had been holding his ribs with to press against his Mark hoping to feel even a shred of return warmth. Pomfrey disappeared back into her office and Draco figured Harry couldn’t be too badly off if she and Weasley were stepping away from him. He hadn’t been transferring to St. Mungos so it couldn’t be anything Pomfrey couldn’t handle.
They shook on it, then fell silent as the ceremony began.
Draco had expected as much, but hadn’t prepared himself for how upset Harry’s word would make him. How could anyone lay their hands on a child and believe it to be okay? Draco carefully returned to carding his fingers through Harry’s hair again.
Harry gave Ron a look, “Just a few months ago you thought it hilarious that Moody beat him up.”
“Well if it screeches and Diggory said to bring it into the bath my guess is merpeople. They’re the only things that make sense, plus the Lake has a tribe I think.”
Harry bit his lip, frustrated.
“Harry Potter!” Dumbledore boomed and Draco wasn’t sure if the panic and dread inside of him was his or Harry’s.
“They’re the three things needed to maintain fire,” He said as the thought suddenly occurred to him. “Heat, oxygen, and fuel. The fire will not last without all three. The universe is telling you that two of you would not work without the third. All three of you are essential. That’s why they didn’t bond without you.”
"No need," Draco assured, running a towel over Harry's head to try to dry the soaking wet locks. Draco assumed Harry didn't want a drying spell used on him quite yet.
Malfoy squinted at him like he had grown a second head, but carefully reached up and unbuttoned the rest of his shirt. He let it fall open.
“That’s not what I’m worried about,” Hermione’s brow furrowed. Harry was far away with Sirius at this point, even if Lucius did find out in some crazy instance, there was no way he was getting to Harry. She was worried about what Lucius was going to do to his heir that would make Draco sick about it for weeks.
Thank you all for the amazing support. Let me know what your thoughts are and any questions moving forward. I love hearing what you're thinking!! Have a wonderful weekend, see you in a few days!
“Crouch attempted to finish what the Dark Lord started tonight. He sneaked Potter away while we were distracted. We have him apprehended and the real Moody is safe. Potter has been though a great deal. It seems the Cup was a Portkey, as you suspected. When Potter and Diggory grabbed it, it transported them to a location where the Dark Lord was reborn.”
“I love you too,” He whispered finally. Draco busied himself with massaging shampoo through Harry’s messy locks, keeping himself from cringing at the blood, dirt, twigs, and other debris that were washing out of his hair.
“It’s one thing to defy my father when he isn’t here, it’s another to think about facing him. I’m just nervous. It’ll be fine. It’s one lunch.”
“Mr. Potter, it is me,” Madam Pomfrey assured him as she ducked through the curtain. “I was waiting for you to wake up before rousing him. He will be very disoriented. I need you to help calm him.”
Shout out to sp-ac-ep-re-si-de-nt (TheQueenOfStars)  and crispy_croissant for their correct guesses that Harry stole Draco's tie! I hope you all enjoyed the Yule Ball. We're starting to see some divergence from the canon. This is from both the changes in Harry from his relationship with Draco as well as changes due to this soul-mate world. I absolutely love the idea of Parvati and Harry getting to share their culture a little bit. We also get a little tiny bit of smut at the end there.
“Oi, Weasley, your father is in the paper again!” Blaise Zabini called from across the hallway. “Is that really where you live? I guess what they say about the paper is true, it really does add a stone or two.” He brandished the picture of Mrs. Weasley standing outside of the Burrow.
Fudge started to sputter slightly, “Your soul-mate?”
"Thank you, Draco," Harry whispered.
Around him, he felt his familial lines rise up like a golden spider web, ensconcing the world around him in darkness. He felt the wards of the Manor like physical strings of gold, spreading out around him. He could see his Mother’s magic like a beam of light, the floor below him.
Draco was caught off guard as a stabbing, slicing pain ripped through his leg.
“It’s going to cut in on our time to meet though,” Harry warned him to which Draco shrugged.
Malfoy nodded, “We need to figure out how to glamour. I didn’t have time to research when I was at the Manor, but I’ll find something once we’re back at school.”
Dread pooled in Harry’s stomach at the thought. He couldn’t imagine telling his best mates about his newfound bond. He hoped whatever soul-mark he had wouldn’t be impossible to hide, but knew it was only a matter of time. He couldn’t exactly get changed inside his bed curtains or the loo for the rest of time, Ron was bound to get suspicious eventually.
Harry went downstairs to retrieve his books from the table. He found Hermione staring out the back window, sipping at a cup of tea.
The Slytherins found the whole thing hilarious and the Gryffindors were annoyed.
“You all need to go, get into the woods, and do not return until I come for you! Go, hurry! Keep track of each other! Fred, George, Ginny is your responsibility!” Mr. Weasley ordered, his wand out.
Pansy had marched around the bed to Weasley and slapped him. Precisely the moment she had, Hermione had grabbed her opposite hand to pull her off. They all gasped in unison and Draco watched as a bundle of what looked like twigs or logs materialized on Weasley’s forearm, a swirl of blue and white coalesced onto Hermione’s, and what looked like a spark etched itself across Pansy’s.
“My apologies, Draco, I forget myself sometimes. I meant no harm,” He said genially and Draco forced his features into an impassive mask.
“We’ll make sure they get an appropriate punishment.”
If you want to get an update on when I'll be posting again, my (largely unused ngl seriously tiktok has ruled my life [I promise I'm an actual adult]) tumblr is: silverlynings (yep same as my username) I'll post an update there. Feel free to rant at me there too if you'd like.

"I'd have figured you would think I deserved it." Malfoy said quietly, adding what looked like moth's wings into the potion and stirring it clockwise with a silver rod.
“I’ll be back soon, I promise,” Hermione assured him. She reached out quickly to run her hand across his arm, smiled at Harry, and left the room.
Draco laughed again, “Merpeople? Honestly, I’m going to start making you read. You know absolutely nothing about the Wizarding World.”
Draco had been very relieved when he had heard the next task wasn’t for a couple months. He needed the time to catch his breath after the absolutely insane last couple months.
Harry squinted at him, "Wandless magic? I don’t know. Sometimes I guess." His eyes caught the corner of blue peeking out of Malfoy’s shirt where he had unbuttoned it slightly. "Can I see it, like, properly?"
“Wouldn’t mind what?” Harry’s voice asked as the door clicked open.
“Draco is more than capable.”
Sirius was quiet for a moment, caught in thought.
“But what about the take on yourself not being able to be open with anyone? I wouldn’t have made it this far without being able to trust Ron and Hermione, and how can I do that without them knowing me at all?” Harry countered.
Have a wonderful week!
Draco wasn’t about to bad mouth one of Harry’s favourite people, but he honestly thought it was a completely barmy decision.
There was one person Draco was actually worried about upsetting and that was his mother. He didn’t think she knew the extent of what Lucius did. She definitely knew Lucius punished him, but he didn’t think she was aware of the severity. The society women were going to have a field day with this information, and it was going to look badly on her.
“That’s fucked,” Theo said in disgust.
Malfoy stared at him, wide-eyed. "We’re absolutely fucked,” He commented needlessly.
"I'm surprised Pansy isn’t already out searching for me, it’s well past curfew."
Harry’s hands went immediately to grab Draco’s hips, not allowing him to go far, “Are you feeling this too?”
“Draco, I-” Draco cut him off as he wrapped his arms around Theo and pulled him into a suffocating embrace.
“Languages?”
“And lastly, it is time that everyone be on the same page. Sirius if you could join us?” Dumbledore asked and the black dog hopped off the foot of the bed, quickly changing into the form of Harry’s godfather. Mrs. Wesaley screamed and Weasley quickly shushed her, assuring her it was fine. Draco looked over at his own godfather, seeing the absolute hatred in his gaze.
“It’s one of our latest inventions. We’ve been saving them for the right time. They survived the Great Cleanse of 1994 orchestrated by Mother Dearest.”
“Yeah there was a green one, a red one, a silvery-blue one that only breathed blue fire, and then a massive black one with spikes on its tail. Charlie said the names, but I can’t remember what they were. No Norwegian Ridgebacks, I know that,” Harry said shooting a smirk at Draco.
"Thank you," Harry muttered as Draco helped him get settled, he grabbed tightly onto Draco's hand as he pulled away.
,” Draco said simply and Harry stared at him. Draco rubbed his face with his hands, “You’ve never done that.”
“Seamus thought I might be battling a banshee.”
Assuredly, none of the whispers around them were about anything than the kiss that had just happened.
Coming up next chapter is the Third Task!!! The next couple chapters are my favorite in the entire fic, so I truly hope you all enjoy them as much as I did writing them. Thank you for tuning in!
“Mr. Potter, I asked you to leave!”  Pomfrey screeched when he hadn’t moved.
Happy New Year!
“What are you talking about, Draco? You’re barely fifteen you can’t not go home.”
“She didn’t have anything to say about it being, you know, me? She didn’t think I deserved this?”
Harry was silent for awhile, his quill was still, Draco wanted to revoke his question, but part of him needed to know. He had always thought Harry grew up spoilt and pampered, but things didn’t line up.
“You two okay?” He asked, eyes still fixed on Harry’s arm.
Draco pulled his shirt apart with little hesitation, revealing his Mark. “I’m positive.”
I believe that was my longest chapter yet! I wanted to include everything though, and not split it in two, so here we are! Sorry it's a bit late, I figured it would be worth it. So yes Draco was not brought into the Lake. We will get some explanation later on why this is, I promise. I hope you still enjoyed it. We also understand what has been bothering Draco for the past few chapters. Shout out to those of you who wondered what the letters were about. The Hogsmeade visit is going to be an intense chapter. Lucius in the flesh is gonna be a bumpy ride.
Draco shrugged, chuckling lightly, “You asked.”
Harry stared at him, “Does she really make you that jealous?”
“We’ve got to get out of here,” Harry said as he struggled to get his feet under him, it didn’t seem that Ron noticed how quickly he was pulling the two of them behind him.
“Well, lucky for you, I can,” Draco said fondly.
“Goddammit I wish we didn’t have to keep this secret. It’s such fucking bullshit,” Harry burst and the same fizzles of light that had shot from his hands before started up again. Draco got nothing but bad feelings from what Harry could do with his uncontrolled magic when upset like this. Also, Draco had never heard Harry curse so badly. Draco was corrupting him.
“Someone here is possessive,” Draco teased bumping his shoulder against Harry’s. Harry was now bright red, a rarity with his complexion. The table was absolutely roaring with laughter at his expense, but he didn’t seem upset about it. Draco had to admire the Gryffindors for being there for Harry at the moment.
“Did I interrupt something?” Draco asked, a soft smile on his face.
“What do we get out of it?”
Realization dawned on the two of their faces and they covered their mouths with their hands to quiet their laughter.
Soon the hallway was filled with laughter.
Woo, that was a long one, and sooooo much fun to write. It took me a bit to get it out because I just wasn't happy with the flow. I figured I just had to stop nit-picking and post it, so here you go! Getting closer to the end here! Also, I hope it's clear, but Draco refers to Bill as William because he would only ever know the proper names of the Pureblood families, not their nicknames (unless they attend Hogwarts at the same time). I hope that clarifies it for those of you who may have been confused!
“You’ll pay for that,” He growled.
“I hadn’t thought of that…” Hermione whispered back.
Snape seemed satisfied that Harry was still getting made fun of by someone, and moved back to his desk.
“They’re You-Know-Who supporters, Harry, come on!” George ground out, herding Ginny ahead of him. They had just hit the woods when two hands shot out and pulled him roughly behind a tree.
Draco stared at him in awe, he blinked rapidly, “Could you repeat that last bit again?” He said as he got to his feet, hands coming to Harry’s hips.
“I gathered that, I didn’t know that could happen,” Harry stared at Draco. He was asleep, having barely gained complete consciousness throughout the whole ordeal, which Harry was thankful for. It had been bad enough on his end.
"You promise not to leave?"
“I love you so fucking much, Harry James Potter,” He declared, bringing his lips to press against Harry’s forehead before returning to his mouth again.
“He should be at the Hospital Wing by now. Go straight there, and do not leave.”
Hermione seemed to realize that Draco wasn’t currently able to form words and shifted her focus to Harry, “Now to the more pressing things. What did Charlie say, exactly? I need every detail if we’re going to figure this out.”
“Oh fuck,” Ron commented, eyes wide. “That’s, er, that’s some shit.”
“I’m going to turn the water on, okay? I’m right here,” Draco said and watched Harry slowly nod his head. Draco got the water temperature to an acceptable level and then looked back to Harry. He looked dead. All of the light that had been present just hours before was gone from his eyes and he was barely keeping himself upright.
The trio set out across the campground, eyes wide as they took in the various scenes they encountered.
“You know we definitely need to look into this wandless magic you seem to do quite often.”
Already the first people to have exploded into feathers were moulting and returning to normal. The only one that wasn’t was Blaise. His rainbow plumage stubbornly held on. Many students were digging into breakfast, not caring about the prank, simply wanting food. Draco summoned a scone from the Gryffindor table and bit into it, hoping that their food would be safe.
Hermione looked even more worried, “Of course, Harry, you know your secrets are always safe with me.”
“I’ll walk you,” Sirius insisted before transforming.
“Sir,” Draco greeted, bowing his head slightly.
“Is that a student!?” McGonagall gasped before pointing her wand at the ferret. “We do not use Transfiguration as a form of punishment! Mr. Malfoy are you all right?”
“I know you must be exhausted, let’s just get you cleaned up, and then you can sleep, okay? Let’s get this kit off.”
“You may be seated,” a voice commanded.
“I didn’t know there was a spell to do that,” Harry scrunched up his face, looking embarrassed.
“Krum for sure, I’ve seen him diving off the ship to practice,” Blaise commented.
Draco felt a stab of anger pulse through and realized Harry had arrived to breakfast. Draco steadfastly kept himself from shooting a glance his way. He knew seeing the injury would upset his soul-mate, but it was a necessary evil.
“Oh yeah, I actually have been meaning to tell you about that. The reason Sirius wanted to meet with me and why he came back is because he wants to train me. He’s still being paranoid and thinks someone is out to get me. He and Lupin are going to meet with me in the Shrieking Shack and teach me defence.”
“No one often does, and yet,” He countered as he settled further onto the hospital cot. Dumbledore’s bushy brows lifted minutely and Draco kept himself from smirking in triumph. Dumbledore may be one of Harry’s favourite people, but Draco didn’t trust him as far as he could
Malfoy looked at him curiously, "I don’t recall you ever breaking ribs while at Hogwarts."
Harry stared at his hands, willing them to do magic. He had stubbornly placed his wand across the room and was trying to summon it back to him using his hand. So far it had barely twitched. Harry sighed, falling back onto the pillows he had transfigured before ridding himself of his wand. He didn’t understand how he could do wandless magic without trying with Draco around, but couldn’t any other time. Harry let out a loud groan and sat up at the sound of laughter.
Harry waved him off, “No, don’t worry about it. I’m sure Pomfrey will let me out. Maybe we could meet tonight though?”
Harry sighed, that was a worry for another time. His first order of business was to get some privacy to look at his bond mark in the first place. Maybe he was imagining this whole thing. Malfoy probably wasn’t even his soul-mate.
“No, don’t,” Harry said, eyes transfixed. Malfoy stared at him curiously, but slowly lowered his wand.
“Is there a problem, Mr. Weasley?” Snape snapped from his desk, silencing Ron immediately.
“Oh, so their well-being is more important than Harry’s? Makes perfect sense. From that response, you
Draco trudged down the Main Street and threw open the door of the Three Broomsticks. Father was already seated at a table away from the draft of the door. Draco would have preferred a booth but knew his Father loathed the indignity of ‘scooching’ into a booth, so he wasn’t surprised by the choice.
“I’ll take the bloody potion if it makes you stop crying. I just don’t want to waste it. Seriously I am okay,” Draco assured them, forcing himself to sit up. He was obviously coming off as too weak, lying down. “Please don’t waste your tears on me,” He said as he wiped at Harry’s face gently.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Pretend hiding this is as important as hiding the whereabouts of your godfather. You don’t understand the danger we’d both be in if my Father finds out." Malfoy said urgently, stepping closer and shaking Harry’s shoulder slightly.
“It would have been fine, I’m sure. It’s fine Draco,” Theo reiterated.
Harry had never looked so utterly miserable as long as Draco could remember.
Draco was at a loss of where to even begin. The top Harry was wearing was caked to his body, pressing into a cut on his arm that had bled all over him. He had dirt and grime covering everything else. Draco bent down and touched the side of Harry face and he visibly flinched away, Draco noticed tears tracking down his face.
“Draco, before we go back out there. Draco, he summoned his followers there,” Harry said urgently, his gaze meeting Draco’s.
“I won’t hold his Head of House against him, at any rate,” Sirius laughed.
Draco agreed, and thanked Merlin for giving him such a fantastic best mate, one willing to be his beard without him even having to ask. This way he wouldn’t have to consistently take his healing potion and waste such an expensive and useful potion. He also knew Harry would be a lot less jealous if he could see the love bites he left displayed for anyone to see, in theory anyways.
Remus frowned, “Honestly he was a bit of a prick. He reminded me a bit of Regulus.”
Ron just nodded dumbly, that same look on his face.
“Just point anyone you see with a similar allergic reaction our way. That and if we could borrow Hedwig, we would be much obliged,” Fred said holding the sweet out again, which Harry gratefully took.
