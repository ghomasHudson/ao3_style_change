I can help to iron out this mess a little. Therefore I have"—Hermione made a heavy pause while she reached into her jeans pocket and pulled out a small velvet bag—"this."
"No need to freak out," Draco huffed, finally turning around and looking at Harry. "Nothing else has happened, and not everything is your job! You had to rest, and I made sure you did so." He shook his head. "You won't be able to focus on anything while you're tired, so then you won't be of any use for this mission. And neither will I be if I have to worry if you're staying alive or not."
"Yes. And uhm, what's the words? There wasn't any breach of security or whatever. I know enough about your kind. My family went into hiding during that war of yours. So if you'd excuse me, I'm sick. Really sick. And if you can't do some Hocus Pocus to heal me I'd appreciate some peace and we'll talk later."
"Let's go and check where those senior Aurors are so they can arrest this piece of shit and we can go home. Home. Not Grimmauld. We can stop by there, but we won't stay."
"You have no idea," Dudley drawled, the memories of multiple fires and a ruined microwave shooting through his mind.
"Okay. Let's go and search the rooms again. We must have missed something, and we have to hurry. The others won't be knocked out forever, and we don't want to be there when they wake up!"
It took him ten horrible long minutes to get there, and another five before Draco finally decided to show. His grumpy face instantly switched to worry as soon as he spotted Harry.
"The Ministry has been taken over," Draco called. "Someone wants to finish what the Dark Lord couldn't do. And we're here to stop them. Fight with us, or leave and get out of danger. You all saw what happened lately! You all whispered, heard rumours. They are true. And we're not allowing this to happen again."
Robards' tone and the angry set of his features made it clear that this was to be the end of Harry's questions. The wizard swallowed his concerns and gave his boss a short nod.
"We know where to get any potion we might need. Write us a list and we'll get them. Ingredients too! We'll take Neville or Malfoy; they can advise us about those as well," Ron said, sounding just as excited as Harry felt.
Sure, there's been a critical raid here and there, or a mission too big for only one team. But Harry today counted 12 teams, all crammed into the room waiting silently for orders. He could feel the tension pressing against his skin.
The only things happening were the lights in the house switching on and off. This carried on until at 10pm when everything went dark and there was no further movement at all.
A stirring in the air was the only warning they got before a storm of curses crashed into Ron's shield, bouncing off with a furious hiss.
He heard Draco sigh behind him. "That's all rather complicated. Let's just say, due to my father's past business dealings, I couldn't find anything better. And yes, if the world were only kind to me, I think I'd have enough money to buy this shitty apartment complex simply to raze it to the ground and build something better."
Sighing, Harry closed his eyes. He really didn't feel too well and Draco was probably right that it needed to be checked, but Harry just didn't want to stress him even more. Draco was pregnant after all, and stress wasn't good for the baby. At least that is what the three parenting books he had said. If Draco would read the books then he'd know too, but he refused to. Not until he made it past the first three months.
"Stop brooding," Draco said as he sat down too. "Tomorrow is Sunday. We should take a day off and maybe go to the beach or something? Just get out of here and get away from everything to relax before Granger comes home on Monday. Much as I love the witch, you know what she's like! We won't have time for anything after that."
It wasn't only Draco's room now but his own too. Then, of course, a new anxiety rolled through him. He didn't know where he stood with Draco, and that didn't help at all. At least the bed was huge, so space wouldn't be a problem, and after their stakeout tonight he'd be too tired to deal with anything anyway.
"You need something to eat," Harry noted as they walked towards the room. He let his eyes flick over the man beside him. "You haven't had anything to eat in ages."
"Yeah. He ran away from home and moved in with my father while they were at Hogwarts together. They were very close."
Two were registered shop owners at Knockturn Alley, one was an old man living in a hut in the forest who was everything but happy to have visitors, and the others had nothing registered on them so far. Not even underage magic or anything minor like that. It didn't make any kind of sense to Harry. But if Robards wanted them brought here to the Ministry, then they'd have to be brought in.
"I'm not. Only the cousin of a wizard who was heavily involved. Your friend is right, you're ruining your sleeves, stop it."
Ron took a sip of his pumpkin juice before he spoke. "Nah, should be fine. As far as we know he has no idea that we saw him on Friday, and you don't want to change your behaviour. You usually keep him updated on cases."
The things one did for loved ones. Next time Harry would be the one who'll get pregnant. He wouldn't do this again. No chance. He'd rather carry the baby and look like a glowing angel.
Dropping the shield, Harry walked closer to him. "It's not about that, but my partner and I would love to hear exactly what you saw Friday night."
Harry and Draco were the first ones to step out the Floo at the Ministry, and people instantly stopped to gawk at them. But nobody raised their wands, nobody whispered their names nor made any move towards them.
Apparating back, Harry and Ron marched into Robards' office, not even amused at how red he was. They told him what had happened before letting him know that they'd be leaving now and that there was to be no discussing it. Then they turned and left before Robards could get a word in.
He managed to unlock the door and all but crawled into his apartment, but not even his raging fever could explain the shit he saw then.
Skin and bones was everything that was left of him. But Harry knew that even though he didn't look like his old self anymore, Malfoy hadn't lost any of his snark.
A private meeting with Robards never meant anything good, Harry wasn't sure what to do. His long experience told him that. If Harry was about to get a warning for simply questioning some rather ridiculous orders he'd be so livid that he'd be lost for words.
Draco had been pacing their kitchen for the past thirty-something minutes and Harry tried to ignore the nervous energy the wizard radiated while eating some eggs on toast.
"You would. And I'd love to see that. But I fear that you can't take those without coming and ruining some of the fun for me," Harry said, laughing at Draco's desperate expression.
"Well, good thing that I've never listened to you. I won't start now." Harry closed the zipper of the tent. He would not let Malfoy die here.
Right at that moment Harry felt as awkward as a teenager. "Hey! I'm good at my job! Hermione just has a very unique view on everything and we trust her to see those things that everyone else misses."
He could see that Harry thought the same, but he lifted the spell nevertheless and Dean instantly jumped back on his feet.
"You better be," Draco said, giving the assembled Slytherins a wink. "See you later guys. Let's go, Potter."
"You know Robards will have your arse for crossing a name from that bloody list, right?" Ron asked while unpacking his sandwich.
"You're welcome, Mrs Granger." McGonagall turned to leave but decided otherwise in the last second to glare in the direction of Draco. "Horace is retiring, just so you know."
"Not as far as I could see," Ron said, furrowing his brow, "but we don't know how much they saw last weekend so be prepared for anything. Word may have gotten around."
"Sit on my lap, Potter. I want to enjoy this as long as it lasts. Don't touch me again until I say so, understood?"
"Stop distracting from the fact that you look more and more like Moody did!" Draco tutted his annoyance. "Nobody thinks that's sexy, Potter! Here let me heal that for you."
"Strange." Ron mused, "but fine, it'll wait. I wouldn't be surprised if Hermione didn't have a plan in mind too."
Thinking this would be the end of this nightmare, Draco was about to turn back to Castiel and thank him, only to find himself slammed against the wall and held there with a painful grip.
Standing up Harry removed the spells around Draco's bed. Leaving the Hospital Wing, he glared at everyone waiting out there, before announcing loudly that he'd personally kill each and everyone who ever tried to harm his child again.
"I wanted to ask if you'd already started at Grimmauld Place? I know there hasn't been much time yet—"
Draco reverted to sitting on the sofa, fiddling with his sleeves anxiously while waiting for Dudley to feel good enough to wake up and return to their company.
Packing things with magic was a lot easier than doing everything by hand, but he still didn't trust it to get everything. Their belongings had been shrunk down and filled only a couple of boxes now. Harry hadn't realised how little his life had consisted of.
Heavy footsteps from behind announced Robards' arrival, and they thankfully dragged Harry out of his chain of thought. Following Robards into his office, Harry closed the door behind them. He waited for the order to sit, which followed suit.
Not waiting for an answer, Hermione turned and left the room, already pulling another piece of parchment out of another pocket. Harry marvelled at her organisation and, not for the first time, wondered why she hadn't been sorted Ravenclaw.
Sitting down at one of the chairs in front of her little window, Harry closed his eyes and tried to clear his mind. Panic and anxiety weren't ever friends in a situation like this. He knew that he couldn't expect to make any progress on his work while being distracted by worrying.
It really did look fantastic. All the years of neglect, sadness and Dark magic were gone, vanished like an enchantment. All that negativity had been replaced by the same hopeful feelings and sometimes questionable interior design ideas Hogwarts had. This was a place Harry believed he could really consider moving into one day. This could become the real home that he'd craved since he was a small boy locked in a cupboard under the stairs.
Squinting, Harry recognised the red face of Robards standing up there, looking down at the mass of magical folk, waiting for the room to fall silent.
"How come you live in this shitty apartment if your parents are rich? Doesn't that mean you're also swimming in money?"
They were alone now, with the disgruntled Ministry official and Malfoy's parents finally gone. Harry was still fuming and he didn't feel the tiniest bit sorry for what he had done.
"Guys, I'm going to go home and get my mother out of the country. I fear we'll see each other sooner than I'd like to," Blaise said, already getting up and Accio'ing his belongings.
"I feel betrayed, and you look ridiculously soft and squishy in my oversized stuff," Harry giggled, which only made Draco pout. That wasn't good for the Nargles filling Harry's belly. Pouts only added to the general cuteness, which didn't help the general aesthetic at all.
"Thankfully I know how to hide us properly, even without your cloak if necessary," Draco said, his voice carrying the smallest hint of a smirk.
"I think both. Us and them. Do you think this was supposed to be a warning? To stay out of whatever this is?"
"Good. I have a dinner date tonight, and I really don't want to miss that," Harry snorted, before he sent the first spell towards Crouch who answered him promptly.
Harry knew there was tension between the two of them. He felt it in the air, felt his blood burn through his veins whenever Draco looked at him. He couldn't point his finger at the source of the tension, didn't know when it'd happen, but he knew something would. And probably soon.
Harry couldn't stop staring at the size of the socks they had taken home today. They were beyond tiny.
Doing as he was told, Harry took a deep breath before he Side-Alonged Draco to Robards' house. The wizard had been there several times before, to drop off or pick up some things, but he had never really paid any attention to its surroundings.
Pebble appeared and bowed deep but Harry cut her off before she could even utter a word. "Please take my friend to Grimmauld Place, he'll tell you where his friends live, go and get them all," Harry told the elf, hoping that she could recognise just how vital her task was. "Just take them there, don't let them ask any questions, I'll meet you there in about thirty minutes."
Taken aback, Draco stared at him. "That sounds horrible. I'm not surprised that my magic knocked the floor from under your feet. I'm sorry. Your cousin sounds like a real prick."
"Oh no. I'm with him because he's a good man." Harry smiled at Draco and, he had no idea what overcame him, pulled up Draco's hand to kiss his knuckles. "Also he's pretty, don't you think?"
"Thirty minutes. And we can send him to Hogwarts if he won't move his feathery bum into his cage in time." Handing a buttered piece of toast to Scorp Harry waited for Draco's input that he knew would come.
"But what if something else happens?" Harry asked, still staring at the house. His inner-Saviour was loath to leave when he knew that there were criminals within.
Smiling at him, Harry nodded and held out his hand again, waiting for Draco to take it. "Not alone this time."
"I still think it's not fair that you didn't spend the last months puking your guts out like I have," Harry sighed dramatically while looking angry at Draco.
"You managed to get us married! This was meant to be fake! You ruined it!" Malfoy's voice was shaking as he spoke.
Smiling widely, Mrs Weasley sent Draco off to put the presents in the living room, and order the twins to show him the way and give him a drink.
"Any news yet?" Harry asked as he dropped the lunch Draco had carefully prepared for him on his desk.
"Kingsley was in Robards' office, he looked worried but didn't tell me anything. Backup takes five to ten minutes, Robards keeps a team on call for us." Harry informed his partner as they gathered the rest of their kit.
When they reached the gate, Harry's heart was beating wildly in his chest as he looked at Draco by his side and their old new home in front of them.
Hermione would Transfigure his clothes so he'd match Robards, and Draco would fix his own robes to match Mrs Robards' clothes. They'd go into the Ministry, followed by their invisible army, and then they'd do their damnedest to try to stop Crouch.
"Speak for yourself, Potter. I kind of enjoy this idea. It's definitely the best of today's chain of grand ideas."
His mind felt like a broomstick caught in a storm, untethered and out of control. Harry felt like someone had thrown him back in time—thrown him back to the worst point in his life—and he was not ready to deal with that again.
Something big crashed against the shield George and Ron had put up around the shop and they all looked towards the spot the noise had come from. There was a random wizard in a badly fitting Ministry uniform standing at the window trying to look inside. His face was twisted with fury and he radiated violent intent.
Looking up at Draco, Harry already wanted to decline. He wasn't a good dancer, and the music was way too romantic for doing this without full body contact. But something told Harry that he should do it. "Don't cry if I step on your toes. You know I'm a horrible dancer."
"Glad to be of service, you prick. At least you two will shut up once our food arrives. And I'm not pouting."
Next to him Harry could hear Ron mumble the Anti-Disapparition Jinx, making sure the witch couldn't flee.
"Worrisome? I thought the same, but an order is an order, Auror Potter." Robards looked at him with a stern, fearsome expression until Harry huffed and leaned back into his chair.
At that Ron actually snorted, and Harry shot him a confused look, just as Draco rolled his eyes at him and left.
"Same for me, Harry. This week was"—she hesitated for a second—"something. To say the least. Is there anything else that I can do for you?"
Writing his mother a note, he left it at her door together with the new robe he had ordered for her, before he ran back downstairs and out of the Manor to Apparate to Diagon Alley.
But tomorrow, tomorrow they'd beat the Headmistress in Quidditch. And tonight they'd move into their shared quarters.
"I'm pretty sure Kingsley was just murdered, we have to go. Now," Harry stuttered out, finding Draco's eyes with his own
Rolling his eyes, Harry emptied his bowl at top speed before he dragged himself into his bedroom and looked for a pair of jeans and a presentable shirt. He didn't want to turn up in his full Auror robes at Kingsley's doorstep, but arriving there in his scruffy joggers also wasn't a smart move, seeing that his house was no doubt guarded and watched by the Ministry.
At that Harry heard her turn around and leave, and seconds later Draco scoffed. "She's just as annoying as you are. What did I do to deserve the pair of you?"
Malfoy hesitated for a second but then he huffed and shook Harry's hand. "Lovely to meet you. Again. So who's wedding will we attend?"
Harry tried to hit him with every non-lethal spell he could think of, not willing to kill him. That could wait until the Wizengamot got their hands on him once again. They needed his memories, needed to prove Robards was guilty too, and prove his whole sordid plan. Harry needed to expose everything Crouch had done including the horde of Inferi he had created. Like Voldemort before him, Crouch was nothing more than a murderer.
"We go home, quit our jobs and move to the Bahamas. Only once in my lifetime do I wish that people would make it easy for us," Harry sighed annoyed. "
A blindfold wrapped itself around Mrs Robards eyes, and Hermione gave Blaise a sharp nod, allowing him to levitate her out of the house. Plucking a few hairs from Mr Robards' head, Hermione got up and they started to move back through the house.
"Monitor him tonight and call me if his cough gets worse. The soup is a good idea, and I left him something to add to a bath later. It'll clear his airways and heal the cuts and bruises he has. Make sure he doesn't drown in your bathtub. He has a rash on his back, so you'll have to help him with the salve I left for that one after the bath."
Throwing himself next to the puddle of coffee, Harry rolled himself into a ball and sobbed until it got hard to breathe. And then he sobbed some more as he tried to tell Draco how beautiful he looked and that he should stop worrying about his body because he looked absolutely breathtaking.
"Don't think I would send our son to Hogwarts without his own pillow. That'd be madness. He needs a good sleep to get good grades. How is he supposed to do that with those rock hard pillows there?"
rose to power the first time. He knew what was going on, he had watched him for years. Dumbledore knew what he was fighting against. The second time we all knew who our enemy was, right from the start. This here, this is a different thread. A different cloth. Right now, we know nothing, so we have to find out what's happening before it's too late."
It was only once the pair of wizards entered the Atrium that Harry realised the last time this had probably happened: when the wizarding world realised that Voldemort had returned. The staring witches and wizards probably hoped that he'd be the one to stop it if history decided to repeat itself.
Harry heard the lie, he didn't even need to look to see Draco fumble with his sleeve or whatever it was this time to know it. But Lucius Malfoy obviously didn't, or he didn't care.
Magic tingled up through his arm and all but pulled him through an invisible barrier, spitting him out into a garden covered in strange shiny plants and ridiculous looking mushrooms. Ron joined him there only seconds later, his wand held at the ready. "I think you were right about the spell. This would all look
Landing far enough away to not be noticed immediately, Harry and Ron sent the brooms flying back to the farmhouse before they took a cautious look around.
"Let's go to the backroom again, I don't want to draw their attention onto us," George said, his voice wary while Ron took hold of his arm.
Locking the house again, the three Apparated back to Grimmauld Place. As soon as they opened the door they were smacked into the face by a cacophony of sound and busy, scurrying people bustling around the house.
Harry still couldn't believe it. It felt surreal. So he simply listened to Draco ranting on while grinning like a loon, overwhelmed by his own feelings. A month only, and they were already expecting.
"We can't hide them all," Hermione suddenly realised, her intelligent eyes taking in the size of their army. "Is that the change of plans? Just go there and march up to them?"
Suddenly the entire place was glowing, revealing multiple footprints and traces of magic. "They'll know we're coming now, but we can hurry and perhaps find a wall where the traces end suddenly. That way we'll find them."
It wasn't until they both felt like they'd explode from all the delicious food that Harry and Draco felt they could move on to the next point on the list of things they had to do. Saying goodbye to Arthur and Molly, they left to check the state of Grimmauld Place.
"Correct," Neville piped in. He was wearing a thick woollen shirt, and he rolled the sleeves back, unconsciously getting ready for action. "I wonder what made him snap and decide to get out. We know actual murder didn't stop him."
"You're not going there alone Potter. We all know you're a reckless idiot, but that doesn't mean you get to risk everything again. I'm coming with you," Draco insisted, voice matter of fact, the wizard already gently placing down his fork, his face brooking no argument. "Someone has to make sure you come back alive."
Feeling the spell on his body lift, Harry scrambled onto his knees with a groan and looked up at the familiar face. "Nice to see you too Professor. It's been a while."
"Want me to hold her while you make up her bottle?" Harry asked, concerned about the logistics his friend would need.
Royally fucked. And I know you have a saving people thing, so I'm requesting your aid once again, as if it wasn't bad enough that I'm already so deep in your debt that I'll never get to repay you in my lifetime.
"So, what do you expect me to do? What does this arrangement include? I can pretend I'm drunk the second we arrive, or—"
"The Servant. Everyone thinks he's gone. But he's back again. And he's worse. He's... insane… Truly insane. We'll soon be dead. All of us, all of you, so, so soon." At this point Mrs Robards started sobbing so hard that she had trouble breathing. But stopping now was simply not an option: the group had to know. Just a bit more; a little bit more information, and then they could leave her to rest.
"Nice you made it, are the others here too?" Harry asked while Draco returned to fussing with his glasses.
"Possible," Draco agreed, sounding very impressed with the older witch. She had displayed a very Slytherin level of cunning. "I'll water her plants and see which ingredients I can find here."
"I got you the first five files I could find and will send the rest to your office by the start of next week. That way, they can't make you work on the weekend." Mathilde winked and Harry sent her a grin.
Harry took another step and his foot hit something solid. Looking down he saw the remnants of a burnt Inferius on the floor and he scrunched his nose in disgust, wondering from what part of Hell Crouch had summoned those monstrosities from.
"And then they'd barricade the entire wizarding world," Harry hissed back, angrily cleaning his glasses for the tenth time, "and we'd have no time to act on what we learned. Bad idea, Malfoy."
Another set of laundry, and Harry racing to the next store since they had forgotten to buy a tiny plastic bathtub for the baby.
Mrs Zabini opened her eyes, and looked down at all of them. "This is for luck," she said, her voice sounding rich and smoky. "It'll keep you safe, curses will miss you, and people will not feel the need to attack you if they hadn't planned to do so before."
"Indeed, Mr Potter. It's a spell, not from this land, not from this time, it has no name and not many people know it. But it has similar effects," Mrs Zabini said with a wide, confident smile. "It's not as potent, but it will last longer. This is what I can give you in addition to me being by your side."
"We can put them in our wardrobe. Nobody would dare to meddle with my clothes. They all know I'd kill them," Draco huffed, looking at Harry like he might dare to pinch his Versace trousers.
"Promise you we'll eat together tonight," Harry said quietly, knowing Draco could hear his fear too, and knew that it was okay to feel vulnerable. It would do Draco a disrespect to let him believe otherwise.
Malfoy flinched but slowed down his pace and took a few deep breaths. At least that was something. Once the git had calmed down things would be fine. And if not, he had always been keen to punch Lucius Malfoy square in the face. So it'd be a win-win situation for Harry no matter what.
When Mrs Weasley started singing to Celestina Warbeck's Christmas songs, Draco gawked as the entire family started to join her for it with loud laughter and clinking glasses.
"I'd say probably a level fifteen at the least but we'll know once Potter manages to get a word in," Draco snorted.
The room fell silent at his statement and Harry knew they were all thinking about exactly the same thing. What were they supposed to do with this? If Hermione had been there, she'd probably have run up a plan already, or five at a push. It wouldn't surprise him if she had a plan in reserve just in case something like this happened.
Draco tried his best to distract him, going out of his way to arrange as many fun activities for them as possible.
Paying his overly sweet Muggle drink, Draco decided to get up and go looking for him, and if he couldn't find Harry he'd go back to their hotel and pout for the rest of their honeymoon.
Furrowing his brows Harry looked up at her, waiting to see what she would do next. Then he caught Blaise smirking at him and giving him a short thumbs up.
"You'll have Rose to keep you company, and don't listen to your father. You won't die, and you'll have a good pillow. What else could you wish for?" Draco answered with a big grin on his face as Scorp came walking into the room.
That actually made Harry snort, and he grinned at Draco, thankful that he didn't treat this like the drama it absolutely was.
"I have an owl, I can bring her next time I come and visit. Or Draco can bring you along next time he visits me."
"Lucky I didn't get out of my uniform yet," Harry said, rubbing his eyes beneath his thin metal frames. "Lets go so we can grab a good spot."
"Harry, will you lead the mission with Ron?" Hermione suddenly asked, disturbing this small moment he had been sharing with Draco.
An hour later, all of them were standing in front of Robards' gate, hidden from spying eyes thanks to Draco's clever magic. Blaise was the first one to get active, dismantling all the charms with obscure enchantments and spells that secured the property whilst simultaneously searching for curses and hexes that could have been put in place against intruders.
"Me neither. And now they managed to get themselves into trouble together, let's hope for a low mortality rate."
Harry grinned at the blatant attempts Draco was making to lighten the mood. He supposed that was why they always got along so well. Both of them always knew how to cheer the other one up. At least once they had gotten used to each other, that was. It'd be a lie if Harry had said it had been like this from the very moment they moved in together. The two of them had learnt to get on, learnt to understand one another.
He saw the way Draco looked at him whenever he thought Harry was too distracted to notice. So Harry had started watching him, trying to catch him looking his way.
Stepping into the big room, Harry gawked and Draco laughed. It had been decorated in a very obvious Slytherin green and one could definitely call it a Master Bedroom. It was pompous, and nearly offensive in its size and ostentatious display of wealth oozing from every inch of the room. Alone, the bed was the size of a small flat if someone were to ask Harry.
When Harry resurfaced from the nothingness surrounding him, he threw Malfoy a foul look. He couldn't believe he was really doing this. Harry knew he had been bored lately, but he hadn't thought he was bored enough to become Malfoy's fake date at a Malfoy family dinner. The second he came home, Harry promised himself, he'd look for a job or a new hobby. Preferably Hippogriff breeder so Malfoy would stay away from him.
"You can't take me with you!" Jasbert cried out and seconds later a blinding light appeared that all but burned the ropes away.
At one point Draco realised that Harry had put his arm around him and that they were holding hands. He had no idea who started this, but now that he thought of it, he didn't feel the need to complain.
"Impressive," Crouch's voice echoed through the smoky air. "There are many amongst your ranks that could have been of great use to me. But sadly, fire won't help you with my final surprise, Potter. They can fight for themselves, let's see how hard you'll go after your colleagues, shall we?"
"Yeah, maybe. Maybe I was just worried about him or something," Harry sighed. That had to be it, surely? His brain had been running in every direction this last week.
"I'll go with Potter, you can come to my place when you get your mother out," Pansy said to Blaise and he nodded, looking thankfully at her.
He knew Draco was worried about his weight, but he had no idea how bad it had affected him until Draco walked by a mirror and Harry broke down sobbing, spilling his morning coffee all over the floor which then made him lose the rest of his sanity. This was more than slightly inconvenient. This was the worst, a nightmare.
"Yes. And with everything happening right now I'm not surprised about your visit at all," McGonagall huffed out before she held out a hand to help Harry up and onto his feet.
"I caught them playing Quidditch, you should have seen it!" Harry's voice was full of admiration "Anyway, McGonagall, Flitwick, Hooch and Sprout all are informed now and up to date with everything. They'll protect Hogwarts and have promised to assist as well as they can from Hogwarts. We're supposed to stay in contact with the Headmistress."
All this was a mess, and he didn't know what to think anymore. Draco was his friend, and he had been for years. Harry supposed it was normal to get confused sometimes. Extreme situations brought up extreme reactions, and as Hermione and Ron said yesterday, they had bigger problems to worry about right now.
Harry looked around the empty hallway and lowered his voice to a hushed whisper, "Is there somewhere we can go where nobody will listen?"
"So..." Malfoy said as he attempted to pull Harry into a dance. "Was your chivalry because you were scared for that Muggle's safety? Or is the famous Harry Potter hiding a dark secret and is into hot blondes and not only gingers?"
Rolling his eyes, Draco padded his bare feet out of the room which didn't help at all to calm Harry's rapidly approaching laughing fit. It was the easiest and happiest that Harry had felt all day. Harry finally lost it, dissolving into small chuckles when Draco came running back into the room and told him that Molly was awake and saw him in Harry's jumper. Apparently the witch had immediately promised to make him his own.
"But you can fix it, right?" Harry huffed. He actually didn't really care what he looked like but he did care about the pain. He was getting rather too close to passing out for his liking, and it would be nice if it'd stop hurting soon.
so nobody can get to it. If they do, then they deserve to get the potions. I pay the Ministry now, young Auror Potter, so I thought they'd leave me alone. Why do they want to see me anyway?"
As they walked downstairs, they heard a crash come from the room they had stunned the first man, and they all hurried then, wanting to get out before the others regained consciousness too.
"Hey!" Ron whispered from next to him. "Who would expect a war zone in the middle of Diagon Alley at this time of night?"
Inspecting his work afterwards, Draco decided this would do until they got back to their hotel where he could fix it properly.
An earth shattering crack sounded through the hallway, and Harry looked at the floor in front of him, seeing it open up and crumble into black nothingness.
. We were simply sick of your whining," Draco said, while rolling his eyes. There wasn't any heat in his voice though. "Unbelievable. I'll meet you at home, Potter. I'm making sure those two get home safe."
"Dear Salazar, spit it out already, " the witch laughed, amused. "I don't have as much lifetime left as you."
After the ceremony there was a rich meal while Draco made sure that both Vernon and Petunia heard him speak about some fancy food Harry hadn't even heard of, and how he had paid for 'his less fortunate friend's' wedding where he made sure they'd only serve the best of the best.
Mrs Gardner sat on the floor next to the flesh-eating-slug-repellent with an empty, vacant look on her face and drool running all over her chin. Harry had never seen the victim of a Dementor's Kiss before, but this came very close to what he had always imagined.
When he was out of sight, Draco closed the door and walked down to the kitchen where he plonked his head against a cupboard and let out a muffled scream.
"Not alone," Harry echoed as he looked down at their linked fingers. He felt a lump build in his throat and tried to swallow it away.
"Sorry! You sound like an old married couple. It's so ridiculous to listen to the pair of you." Ron held his hands up in defence. "Two sides of the same Sickle, you two."
"It's my fault, I didn't tell you I'd come over, thought I'd surprise you." Mr Weasley smiled apologetically. "I'll be gone in a minute, just wanted to give you an early Christmas present."
Looking at Ron, Harry furrowed his brows and, barely noticeably, nodded towards Robards before mouthing the word 'Minister'.
Draco looked at the set of keys in his hand and then up to the strange looking building in front of him. This was supposed to be his new home, but it somehow didn't feel much like a home to him. It felt more like he was trapped in a bad book, one where the writer had given him the perfect life, only to take it from him, bit by bit, until he had to move into a tiny flat in an old house. Worse, he had to share his space with a Muggle on top of it all.
"Well, if that isn't a plan I don't know what is," Blaise laughed as he got up to refill everyone's glasses with generous shots.
Feeling a Knockback Jinx hit him, Harry flew back through the room and dropped agonisingly to the ground, where he found himself immobilised before he could do as much as aim his wand.
Thankfully the two Patronuses were enough to get rid of them. Once the Alley was clear again, Harry crouched down to get a hold of his shaking limbs.
"Guys, you're creepy when you're in Auror mode. Could you possibly just shut up?" Pansy asked. "There are people who might be dying outside the door and you're chatting about the
"It'd be Pebble's great honour to help the famous Mrs Granger! So good to us elves, the Misses is!" the elf said, spinning around and bowing in front of Hermione who instantly turned pink.
"Fine. But if the Ministry chugs me into Azkaban I'll blame you," Draco muttered loudly before Dudley heard him stomp off.
"House-elves. Grimmauld is in a bad state, very bad. As many elves as you can send to my place to clean it up. Draco hexed me into next week after he nearly broke through the third floor ceiling. I need help to fix that place and actually make it liveable again."
At that murmurs picked up, and Harry saw that the people gathered around them had begun to gather their heads together, whispering urgently as they watched the scene unfold.
Sending her a foul look, Harry took another sip of whatever Mrs Weasley had given to him. It definitely had loads of alcohol in it, which he appreciated now more than ever.
The wizarding world had fucked up many years before, letting innocent children fight in their war. Ron, Hermione, Draco and he? Each of them were now trained professionals, each with a set of skills that made them powerful, dangerous and a force to be reckoned with. They had the best witches and wizards the UK had to offer by their side too; each and every one of them were ready to kick some Ministry arse.
Harry wasn't satisfied with that answer. "But if not even you know what's going on, who's doing the questioning then?"
Hours later, Harry had come to a stark realisation. This wouldn't be as easy, or as straightforward as he had imagined. Draco had spent the last three hours snoring next to him in bed, a small smile playing around the edges of his lips, while Harry had tried to sleep too. He had failed spectacularly because Harry was everything but tired.
"Tell me we'll be back here tonight," Draco said quietly, looking in Harry's direction. He was looking for reassurance and Harry was only too willing to give it.
Racing upstairs, Harry got held up at nearly every door for a chat and his friends telling him how great it was that they could stay at Grimmauld for a while, and Harry couldn't help but feel as if he'd burst with the joy of having all them here. Part of him felt like he was back at Hogwarts, surrounded by all the people he loved and cared about.
Harry was speechless. He hadn't ever thought that Draco would take such a small—but such an important—task into consideration. And when he threw a glance over Draco's shoulder he noticed that it wasn't just any clothes that Draco had brought. It was his favourite clothes, the items that made him feel most secure. A jumper Molly had made him, his comfy joggers and warmest socks that he barely ever wore nowadays. The jeans that fit just perfectly, and a few extra things he might need. He didn't have the words to express how much this action meant. So rarely had Harry been the first person in anyone's thoughts.
"I don't know all their names," Mrs Robards answered as tears started to stream down her face. "There are many people involved… and my husband never told me what was happening until it was too late! They invaded our home, they made Gawain plot against his friends which ended up in Kingsley's death." She sobbed, her voice breaking as she spoke. "And they will kill us too, once they don't need us anymore."
"Yes, I was at his place and he was off, he wasn't himself, it was like a part of his mind was broken, and then there were people coming, and—"
Dudley wasn't too sure about the new bloke. They had lived together for about three months now, but something about him was rather off. He couldn't quite put his finger on it.
Harry hadn't seen Malfoy since the hearing where he spoke for him, resulting in Draco walking out of there a free man.
"She's sure it's him, and she can't lie to us right now. But I don't get why he's not rotting away in St Mungo's or in Azkaban. He shouldn't have survived the Dementor's Kiss in fourth year."
"Fine," Draco sighed, resigned. "I'll come with you. But only because Mrs Weasley makes fantastic food and loves to spoil us."
"Dementors," Draco whispered next to him, as he stepped closer and placed his shaking hand on Harry's arm. "I can't help with those."
And that's how Harry found himself on his sofa once again, feeling moody, and wearing something much like a makeshift bra that had been spelled by Hermione herself to protect his nipples from touching anything but the soothing charm itself.
"So? What can they do? Put me on the wanted list a second time?" Harry snorted, flashing a quick look back at Draco. "It worked, they're out cold."
"Absolutely not. What the fuck did you do, you muppet? We're on our honeymoon! There's no saving the world on our honeymoon, only catering to your husband's needs! And you're bleeding, you idiot! Way to ruin the day!" Draco screamed. He wasn't even sure if he was angry or relieved. Maybe both.
"Witches and wizards of the Ministry. We have organised this meeting today to share devastating news with you all." Robards took a dramatic pause and looked around the packed, frightened, room before he pulled a parchment out of his pocket. He made a great show of unfolding it before he spoke again. "Our Minister, Kingsley Shacklebolt, died last night in a horrible accident."
"I'll tell everyone to get ready then," Draco answered, twisting his wand through his long, lithe fingers. Harry could see that he was entirely ready to stand by his side. "I can hide them, and one of us can Polyjuice into Robards, maybe another one into Mrs Robards. And then we'll see how far we'll get without using force," Draco said, glaring at Harry.
What if Harry wouldn't come back by the night? Was it possible that something had happened to him? Draco had heard that the states weren't exactly safe. He already saw himself sitting at a police station and waiting for them to bring him the bad news.
"You could just fuck me," Draco moaned, impatience audible. "I did the necessary as soon as we arrived here, you're not the only one who can do wandless magic. Please—Harry, please..."
When he started to come back to life, Dudley realised that he was laid on something soft. And that there was another person beside Draco in the room. That only confirmed to him that Draco was, in fact, a full-blown wizard. No chance that he'd manage to lift Dudley anywhere, not even with a second person. Draco’s back would have snapped like a twig if he even attempted to move him.
"You're absolutely correct of course, Hermione, but what you're saying is scarcely news to us anymore." Blaise sighed. "We figured most of this out on our own already."
Ron had declined the offer to become the next Head Auror, and he had quit the very next day too, deciding he'd rather work with George and invent new Wheezes products to keep Harry on his toes in the future.
Hesitating for a second, Draco took a deep breath, before he followed Harry out of the passageway and towards the Hospital Wing.
"There's four down here, no idea how many people are on the other floors. Stun, not kill, quiet and fast," Harry instructed the others, allowing the Auror training that had defined his life for so long to come through his personality and take over. He couldn't risk getting nervous here, not with so many things—and so many people—they could lose.
Smiling Harry tasted a spoonful of the rich soup and all but melted into his seat. It was so rich, tasty and delicious that it reminded him of— "Did you ask Molly for her recipe?"
Getting up he pushed himself through the crowd, ignoring the people around him, too focused on Malfoy. Dancing Malfoy. Malfoy who had his eyes closed and moved his body with the rhythm of the music, looking as if he didn't care who was watching him.
"I'm just here for a quick update, sir. We've got all the files now and have decided to go for the potions witch next. We don't expect anything to go too wrong badly there, sir. Her report states that she didn't even act up the last time she got arrested for selling illegal potions."
"Oh, Draco can heal you. Go and fetch him a Pepper Up, Draco. I'll watch over him. Making sure he's not attempting to run."
Harry had swallowed a good load of soot and ash on his way there, and he shook his head, scarcely sure whether he could even speak right then. Hurrying to the kitchen Harry gulped down an entire glass of tap water in a hurry before he looked at them both and felt his knees gave way again. "Kingsley. I think he's dead. We have to get everyone. I sent Pebble to get the Slytherins to Grimmauld Place. Do you think anyone else is in immediate danger?"
"I think I'm in love with her. Do you think she'll adopt me? Draco Millen? I could keep the towels with my initials. This house is amazing. You should bring Longbottom here, he'd faint and wet his pants."
Giving Greg a quick, and hopefully not too interested looking, once over, Dudley agreed. He was a rather impressive bloke, big with broad shoulders and hands like shovels, but Dudley wasn't anything less. And besides that, dinner sounded good. He was starving.
"You heard what she said," Ron said worriedly. "It doesn't sound like they ever Kissed him. We don't know if Fudge actually watched the Dementors after ordering them to Kiss him," he carried on. "I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't, and we all know Voldemort had them under his control later. He could've easily influenced some of them back then. We don't know when and how he acted."
Suddenly the air was filled with translucent golden fog that whirled around them and made everything glimmer and shine for several seconds, before it was gone once more.
"No worries. Now eat. You have to get dressed and go before Kingsley decides to leave the house again. You know where he lives, right?"
Tying the small piece of parchment to the owl's leg, Harry glowered as he watched the bird fly off. Dinner at the Manor. What a good way to spend a boring Friday night.
And now they were once again hidden in the bushes opposite Robards' house, freezing due to the cold rain that somehow still managed to get through their jackets and trickle down their collars despite the
They had agreed on meeting an hour before the wedding would start to get the details down, and to grab a coffee before they'd wreck a wedding together.
In the end, Harry ended up with a house full of anxious, and therefore insufferable, Slytherins long before Draco came home and could take care of them.
His only answer was another bad cough, so Harry stepped forward and bowed to open the tent flap. He looked inside.
"Spit it out already!" Ron bluffed. "I'll be as old as dad once you finish the story if you carry on like that!"
Yawning, Harry threw himself onto the sofa and turned on the TV before passing Draco the remote so he could choose. Casting a quiet
. "Oh look, now this is interesting. There's a tiny article about the missing Muggles. Granger told us about that right? It's barely a footnote here."
As soon as Harry had finished mopping the floor, Draco had already a new cup of coffee in his hands which he handed Harry as they sat down on their sofa.
Mrs Zabini stepped onto the kitchen table, under the protest of Mrs Weasley, and looked around the mass of people. She paused for a single moment before she pulled out her wand and closed her eyes.
Draco had a strange system of which glasses should be used for different occasions, one that Harry had long given up on trying to work out or talk him out of. Perhaps it was a pure-blood thing, or perhaps just a Draco Malfoy thing, but whatever it was, it was far easier to just run with it and deal with the tons of dishes to wash later.
"Young Mr Malfoy," an amused and cold voice filled the air around them. "You are barely in a position to call anyone a coward. The Dark Lord would be proud of how far I have already come! Very proud! All this took me not even a month. The Ministry is mine."
At first he had thought this was just another crazy fan, trying to lure him into a dinner. But then he saw the neatly curved name that closed the letter and his annoyance made way to utter confusion.
Taking the lift to the Atrium, Harry and Ron went to the first empty Floo and called out an address that led them to a location just outside the New Forest National Park. Their target lived within the wood. The two wizards visited a nearby farmhouse where they borrowed a set of brooms to fly towards the heavily warded hut.
Harry was used to random stakeouts with Ron or other Aurors, and he was very used to being all crammed together in very small spots and ridiculous hiding places. But he wasn't used to doing this with Draco by his side.
Carefully stepping inside, Harry watched as Kingsley stuck his head outside the door. He looked around, his eyes skittish, wide and panicked, before he closed it quietly and dragged Harry to his living room.
Letting go of Draco's cock, Harry reached for his wrist to pull him towards his bedroom where he threw Draco onto his bed. But he refused to join him there straight away.
"I want to see Mr Robards," Harry shouted into the deadly silence. "Or the person pretending to be Robards, because I know for sure that the real Robards is currently half dead in a hidden room in his own house."
When Draco returned from his appointment he didn't come alone. To Harry's surprise he had brought Narcissa along, who looked at Harry with a remorseful pity in her eyes.
How could he leave Draco in a place like this? Draco had no idea what he even was supposed to do all by himself and with a husband who was lost.
At that Robards lifted his wand, and the fireplaces in the room snapped back to life and people slowly started to dribble out. Their shock, horror and upset was written all over their faces.
Draco hesitated for a second before a daring look settled on his face as he stared Harry down while removing the pillow. "The thing in my pants is not the remote, Potter. But feel free to check it on your own."
Grinning, Harry stepped into the shed and followed Arthur back to where he came from. There stood a half demolished washing machine that looked older than Harry.
Humming, Harry looked at the pile of files on the table in front of them. "I think I'll go and update him. I can tell him that we have all the files and that we've decided to check the potions witch next. That's not too suspicious, right?"
Maybe he could help and find Harry? But that'd mean he'd have to stay with Mr Trenchcoat, who radiated even more Lovegood vibes than Lovegood herself, and Draco wasn't sure if that was a good idea.
"Very well then." Waving her wand through the air Professor McGonagall transformed the bench Harry was sitting on, and the brooms the Professors had just ridden into comfortable seats that stood in a circle before she sat on one of them and nodded towards the others to sit down also.
Draco instinctively wanted to reach for his wand but stopped himself from doing so. The MACUSA didn't joke around with the statute of secrecy, and they were surrounded by Muggles. Salazar, he still wasn't sure if Castiel was a wizard or just a weirdo.
Once he stood he looked around to see who the other people were, and nearly laughed as he saw Professor Sprout, Madam Hooch, and Professor Flitwick of all people, standing behind Professor McGonagall.
Harry watched half-disgusted and half-impressed at how easily the Unforgivable Curse came to them. The Aurors who were hit by the Malfoys' curse dropped their wands and left as the two of them moved on to the next ones.
Smiling at Harry, Draco was sure that this night couldn't get any better. This had to be his best Christmas so far.
"Fantastic!" Mr Weasley clapped his hands together as his smile grew even bigger. "I'd better be going and help Molly prepare everything for later. See you soon, Draco!"
"Wow. Slimy, really?" Malfoy asked as he shoved him on the sofa and pressed a book in his hands. "The bathroom is over there, there's a second one upstairs that I'll refer to as our bathroom so you should use it. It's on the left."
"Ronald!" Hermione cried out, pulling on Ron's upper arm with all the urgency she could muster. "This is a very serious matter and not the right time to have
" Harry whispered, and seconds later a figure of a big bearded man appeared in the shadows of the trees. He didn't wait until Jasbert realised what was happening and instantly pointed his wand at him, screaming
Fifteen minutes later, Draco finally appeared behind Harry. The cheeky bloody git scared him into the middle of next week as he tapped his shoulder to let Harry know he was finally ready to leave.
Draco wasn't sure how many Weasleys he danced with that night. But his last dance had been with Harry.
"I'd prefer to get my stuff myself," Draco said, looking at him with furrowed brows. Harry could sense how upset Draco was and he could empathise. The whole situation felt so out of control. "Can we somehow make that happen?"
The elves had restored it, restored every person that Mrs Black had burned from it. It had become an item of rare beauty. All those people that had been deemed an affront to pure-blood traditions were back on there.
Not waiting for an answer, Harry turned to walk into a dark alley to apparate back to Malfoy's tent.
The mood soon lightened a bit, once Harry had decided to order pizza for everyone including Draco, Ron and Hermione. For good measure Harry sneakily added four bottles of red wine to their order, knowing full well he'd get a headache from the cheap stuff they sold, but accepting his fate. Anything was better than living through this ordeal entirely sober. Especially when Draco came home and found his home already flooded with visitors.
"Absolutely not. You have no business in my files as long as they didn't send you to help me," Mathilde snapped.
Cursing under his breath, Harry turned around and smashed the door shut behind him, marching back to Draco's bed where he spelled the curtains shut and blocked Madam Pomfrey out with a
Ron nodded his agreement. "We'll have to go there today. We don't have a choice. Hermione won't like that."
"Yeah, we will. And then we'll go to Hogwarts and just stay in that damn castle and beat McGonagall's backside in Quidditch whenever there's nobody watching."
"Now's not the time to leave me hanging, Harry," Ron begged, his voice low and almost panic stricken as he conjured another Jack Russell who stood watch in front of them.
Harry already wanted to thank her for everything, reassuring her that there wasn't anything else when an idea shot through his mind. "Actually, and I know this is kind of a grey area, but technically I'm not asking you for any information, so—"
"So grateful to have you, mighty Unspeakable, I'd be so lost without you," Harry said, rolling his eyes.
Narcissa was the first one to step through. Her face switched from the blank mask she usually wore, to confusion upon seeing Harry, to happiness when she spotted her son.
Harry snorted, for once not caring about his friend's opinion. "I fear that I started to not give a shit about what Robards says when I saw him taking down random people Friday night. I'm not going to arrest that poor git to satisfy his sick games."
Rolling his eyes, Harry hurried out of the room to use the fireplace downstairs. He had to move quickly and make fully sure that things were safe at their apartment before Draco decided to ask Pebble to get him there. He knew how impulsive Draco could be on occasion.
Grinning at Greg, Harry took a piece of paper and wrote the address down so everyone could read it before he burnt the piece of paper with a swipe of his wand. "Go there. If anything happens go there straight away. I'll know if someone crosses the ward and will come to you as soon as possible."
"You're welcome, Potter. Wake yourself up properly, then we can go downstairs and meet the others. Hermione sent Neville and Blaise on another stakeout to take pictures and they're also back now."
"Hold still, dickhead. I want to fix this, not make it worse." Draco stepped closer and put his hand under Harry's chin as he inspected the cut more closely. "Raid?"
Only then they noticed that something was very off, even more than usual down in this sketchier part of London.
Gawking, Harry tried to make out how many potions were actually hidden away in this room, but he simply couldn't tell. It seemed like an endless stash.
"What else has he done since he moved in with you?" Potter asked Dudley, a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.
"About three weeks ago? Maybe four?" Pansy twisted her ring around her finger as she spoke. "I didn't pay attention at first! I don't know if it's been many people or just the same person whose story got shared over and over again."
"Middle ages, Mr Potter? Well, if this is the case. I hope you don't mind me asking if you plan to make a honourable man out of my son soon? I have to break a deal for your thoughtless liaison after all."
Snorting, Harry watched as the wall of fire slowly dissolved and revealed the destruction that Seamus' spell had wrought on the Ministry. Whatever had been in the open rooms and hallways was now destroyed beyond repair. The doors and walls were burned and covered in soot, and there was destruction wherever he looked. This would take forever to fix, if it was even fixable at all. Harry bit his lip. He was close to Crouch now.
"Well, look at it this way. At least you don't have to take care of the prophecies anymore. That's something."
"'s not related, you bloody nitwitss. 'n the books are there b'caus nobody wants them these days. What happened to me?" came the confused voice from Mr Peck.
"Uhm. No idea, honestly," Harry answered, taking in the comfortable surroundings that the elves had created. "But I know someone who can answer this. Pebble?"
Sure Mr Weasley had said not to bring anything, but who in their right mind would turn up at a family's door, on Christmas Eve, without presents?
"I need new glasses," Harry grumbled annoyed as he took them down to clean them on his sleeve. "Do you think Robards is already back from the Ministry?"
"I thought about Blaise, he'll be helpful with his experience in Curse-Breaking," Hermione said, running her forefinger down a neatly quilled list of names. "And Draco, he'll be responsible for keeping us all hidden until it's time to show our faces. I'll come too. And we have a backup at the hiding spot in case there are more people than we know about." Hermione skimmed through a couple of dozen sheets of paper, probably all the notes she had taken about the house. "The plan is to interrogate Robards or his wife at their home. In the best case scenario they're both there. If that doesn't work out, you'll take whichever we can get and take them to Grimmauld and I'll erase their memory once we've gotten what we want. If everything works out then we won't have to carry out the next step right afterwards. If things go wrong, we'll improvise and see what we have to do next. I'd say we leave in an hour."
Yawning, Harry scooted closer to Draco. Smelling him was a relief for his poor senses, and he took a deep breath. A short nap and things would be better again.
Grinning into their kiss, Harry used a wandless spell to strip Draco out of his clothes, catching the surprised gasp with his lips, enjoying the feel of Draco shuddering beneath his touches. It had been an addiction back then, and it wasn't much less addictive now.
George's voice appeared from somewhere next to him at that. There was an edge to it and Harry wondered briefly if he were remembering the night he'd lost Fred. "It started about fifteen minutes ago. They all streamed in from Knockturn Alley. Ron thought about calling the Aurors in, but your boss is one of the people out there, and we reckon the rest are some kind of Hitwizards."
"Don't hurt me! I'm coming! There's no need to use curses!" came a shaky, quivering voice from the back room. Harry and Ron exchanged glances.
Snorting, Draco shook his head. "I'll join you. Maybe take Hagrid's position? We'd make such a great team there. Potter and Malfoy living the good life! Low stress jobs and good payment, I'd even live in that bloody hut just to get away from all this."
. With their suspect secured, Harry lifted him up with a spell, all the time checking he wouldn't have another burst of energy that made their spells ineffective. But Jasbert was still entirely knocked out. Pleased with the outcome, Harry grabbed Jasbert's shoulders and nodded at Ron. His partner was picking up Jasbert's wand before the three of them turned and Apparated back to the Ministry, Jasbert a dead weight wrapped in Harry's magic.
Life went on. The newspapers were a constant hassle, with their angry, blaming headlines and their controversial opinions. It was about time for Harry and Draco to get away from everything and start their new careers at Hogwarts, learning under the current Professors how to educate the future of wizarding society. Harry could only pray that they would make less of a mess of it.
After everyone ate, Ron and Hermione vanished with Draco and Blaise, and Pansy excused herself for a bath. Greg began setting housekeeping spells to clean the kitchen, which left Harry all by himself.
Harry had sent Draco a memo at the Department of Mysteries and promised him to get everything sorted before he got home from work. So now it was up to him to somehow get hold of the Slytherins.
Harry realised that this was the point Crouch Jr. caught on to what they were doing, and so did everyone else.
"Well Auror Potter, there has to be a good reason but that's one that not even I'm aware of yet. Those names are all people who were in some way involved with Death Eaters, or suspected to be involved with them. Yesterday's questioning obviously didn't bring the expected results so now it's up to us to bring in the rest of them."
"We have to take you with us nevertheless," Harry said, feeling a little unhappy with himself for saying the words. "If you
Harry caught Draco a few times as he stepped out of the shower, dressed in nothing but a towel. Which wasn't that bad, the important things were covered. It only caused Draco to turn a bit more red, his already flushed face still wet from the shower being a lovely shade of pink.
"Succinctly put, Potter. I think we should leave. We have what we need. Robards is most definitely involved, but perhaps not willingly. Granger will have our arses if we stay any later than this," Draco whispered, before he stood and dragged Harry up with him.
He tried his best to keep the hope out of his voice. He'd lie if he'd say that it didn't hurt when Draco had left the last time. Because it did. A lot. But Harry had understood, and he had let him go, hoping that he'd come back one day.
"No idea. I wasn't involved in the interrogations and have no idea what they want. Tried to snoop around but I found nothing."
He hadn't even the energy left to pace the hallway until Draco appeared, so he sat down on the cold floor and put his head on his knees while he waited. He was so anxious that he thought his heart was going to burst out of his chest.
"You'll have to teach me that incantation," Harry answered, forcing himself to grin back at Draco who had already pointed his wand at him.
It was shortly after they had gotten the good news that Harry fell ill. At first they thought he had eaten something wrong, something he couldn't stomach. But after a week had passed, and Harry still spent most of his day semi dead on the sofa, or hanging over the loo, Draco got worried. He spent most of his time next to Harry on the sofa, trying to feed him broth and nudging him every other minute to drink a sip of water.
Stepping through the wards, Harry smiled at them as they all came running towards him. Padma, Parvati, both Healers now. Dennis Creevy, working for
Giving Hermione a short nod, Blaise vanished from the room. The wizard returned a few minutes later, carrying a pompous Pensieve made out of silver with tiny gold threads and spiked with odd-looking jewels. It was obviously an item of very powerful old magic that looked like it was carrying memories in its very metal.
"I'll go and tell Mum and Dad, they have to be prepared if the Ministry comes to arrest them too. If they don't find you at home it'll be only a matter of time," George said, looking worried at the rapid turn of events.
The kitchen gradually filled with bustle, but Harry was too distracted watching the sleepy little girl in his arms drink. When she fell asleep mid suckle, Harry put the bottle onto the table before swiping some drool from the corner of her mouth with his thumb. Then, Harry finally looked up. He found Draco staring at him with a soft smile on his face.
Taking a bite of his new favourite chocolate bar, Harry went to look where Draco was waddling around so he could share it with him.
over the circle before he sat down too and started to tell them everything that had happened so far, including the strange raid at Diagon Alley and what Mr Weasley had said to him.
Secondly, every time Draco moved Harry lost his focus on the house and inevitably looked over at him. Then he'd find himself nose to nose with Draco and getting surprised every time.
Hesitating for a second, Harry nodded before he dropped his wand and allowed Castiel to stitch him up.
As soon as they had arrived at the Burrow, Molly had already spied them and came bustling out of the house. The witch pulled them both into a hug that made their heads bump together and left Harry feeling slightly dizzy.
As expected both Pansy and Hermione were in raptures at the news, both gushing over Draco and throwing Harry pitiful looks when they heard that he had to suffer through the symptoms instead of Draco.
He felt himself being pulled into the house and suddenly he found himself in his own personal hell, stuffed to the brink with red hair and cheerful, loud people.
Harry spotted Draco's name not far from Sirius' own, and Harry wondered if he'd approve of the Slytherins being here, finding sanctuary there and helping them. It probably would have taken Sirius a little while before he'd have trusted them. But Harry was sure he would have warmed up to them eventually. He'd been a man of great empathy, with an uncommonly open mind.
"Make sure to come back, Potter," Blaise said while looking sternly in Harry's direction. "I don't fancy Granger having my bollocks for letting you go, and I'd prefer to not lose my oldest friend because he grew too fond of a bloody Gryffindor."
"Yes, I fear I do know. It feels a lot like last time. Draco thinks I'm mad, but—" Harry shrugged, a hundred awful memories coiling around his belly.
"So, she probably also knows what's up," Pansy said, staring at the two of them. "Do you think we could somehow get her? She'll talk with Veritaserum, no matter how much she loves him. And if she resists then we can show them what we learned last time evil forces tried to seize hold of our world. I haven't forgotten them. I know that none of you have either!"
Draco's answering smile was all he needed to know that this was worth every struggle he'd have to face.
"I am," Harry answered, wanting to be honest with Draco. "But I had hoped to make a change to our world. Doesn't look like I'm doing so at the moment. But this time we're not children. And we're united, not divided by some stupid rivary caused by different houses. It'll be different this time, Draco. I promise you that much."
"There you both are," Draco said as soon as they left the passage. "I thought you two idiots had died down there, sniffing a few too many potions or something."
"Harry how drunk are you? Looks like it might get nasty in here soon," Ron said quietly, his voice switching from casual to official within a second.
Aurors Potter and Weasley need backup at Peck's Books in Knockturn Alley. Transport of suspect, not urgent. Floo connection possible."
"We got attacked by Dementors in Knockturn Alley. One of our witnesses lost their soul. Ron and I quit for the day."
"I think we should go for that witch at Penrith," Harry replied thoughtfully. "It says in her file that she's sold illegal potions before and she's already on the DMLE watch list so there's no harm in going there and checking the situation."
"Honestly, I wish I could say yes. But I'm not sure about that. Greg, your father died on the side of Voldemort. Blaise and Pansy's parents might have mingled with Death Eaters, I don't know. But what can't be denied: you're definitely all close friends with Draco. Being friends with me doesn't count in this situation. It won't make a single Sickle of difference. I'm not even sure how long Draco will be safe." Looking at Draco, Harry sent him what he hoped was a reassuring smile. "I'll hopefully get notified the second someone asks for your files."
Their magic was rioting, lashing out unexpectedly whenever they caught sight of each other. But they tried their best to suppress it, knowing there was no other way than to make this work.
Throwing himself onto Draco's bed, Harry watched him unpack while waiting for a sign that the others had returned. When he was finally happy that they had all come back in one piece, Harry began to relax a little bit. Nothing would happen to any of his friends tonight.
Once they had arrived, Ron and he took Jasbert to the holding cells before taking the confiscated wand to the Artifacts, Articles of Magic and Stolen Items Room where they filled out the necessary parchment form to designate it as belonging to Jasbert. Harry handed it all over to the quiet guy working behind the desk.
The day of the wedding arrived and it was just as nice as Dudley and his wife had hoped for. The perfect weather for an outside event. And the sun would take care of Harry seeing all the colour drain from Petunia's face. Perfect.
"Yes they are," came a voice from the door. Both wizards turned their heads to find a grinning Greg Goyle standing there, looking back at them. Greg was another surprising addition to their circle of friends, once Harry had taken in Draco. Nobody knew Slytherins only came in packs.
"No. Not Aurors," Harry whispered back. "Nobody I know. They don't look like people I'd like to talk with." The wizarding world was small, and Harry recognised many people from sight alone.
Realising that this was the first time he ever held her, Harry smiled down at the little girl. How exciting and exhausting the world must be to someone so small.
Draco leaping from one side of the kitchen to the other to tear open the window made Harry nearly jump into next week. He stood up to look out of the window himself. Up in the sky found two dots sailing towards their apartment at top speed.
Humming in agreement, Harry led their way back out of the potions room, and waited for Ron to lock the door again before the two of them marched upstairs, leaving the frigid cold behind.
"We could call a—uhm, what are they called? Those people coming to fix those things?" Draco suggested.
Apparating back to Grimmauld Place, he and Draco dragged themselves upstairs as quickly and as quietly as possible, trying to not wake anyone. Once in their room, Harry instantly started to shed his wet clothes and rummage through the wardrobe to find the jumper that Molly had made for him and that he knew Draco had brought along, but it was nowhere to be found.
For one, Harry was anxious about the other man's presence—the last thing he wanted was for him to get injured—which was entirely ludicrous, seeing as Draco was more than capable of protecting himself.
"Mr Potter! What in Merlin's name made you sneak up on us like that! You should know better than to conduct yourself in such a way!"
"That's my house. We're meeting my parents here. I thought it'd be easier for you than the Manor. It sure is for me."
Filling his glass up too, Harry sat down next to Draco with a loud, frustrated sigh. "Honestly? I have no idea. We don't know anything yet. But tonight was highly alarming. I'm as much in the dark as you are. I don't know who those men were. I knew none of them except Robards. The part that really flummoxed me was that it happened so shortly after we got the assignment. There's something fundamentally wrong."
"Your parents and a lot of other people read the headlines and decided to move into Grimmauld before it's too late. We're now short on bedrooms, and I fear we have to make some new rooming assignments. Blaise moved in with Greg, Luna with Pansy. Dean and Seamus arrived with their daughter, your parents got our bedroom, Ron. We'll take the sofas for now. Harry you can either move in with Draco or stay with us in one of the living rooms." She broke off her speech, no doubt struggling to remember every detail. "Neville offered to take in others who might come here when there's no room left. His gran obviously made a second Hogwarts out of her home, but she forgot to include him in the wards at first, the poor guy couldn't find his own home anymore."
About ten witches and wizards blocked their path, pointing their wands at them without saying a word. Their faces were flat and filled with bigoted hatred.
"There were criminals on our list," Harry explained, "but also shop owners from Knockturn Alley who only had misdemeanors in their files. Ordinary people, living ordinary lives. There was absolutely no reason to arrest them as far as I could tell."
"Listen, Potter, it's hard to learn all this Muggle stuff on your own. And it isn't as if anybody got hurt! Though I can't promise that'll stay that way if this room keeps feeling so damn uncomfortable."
Nodding, Harry agreed with his best friend and he sat down too. "I'll send a note to Robards, then let's write this lovely report of ours and go home. I'm already tired only thinking of tonight."
By the time Harry had cleared a path to the Minister's office he had sweated through his shirt, and his hair was wild and messy, stuck to his forehead. His whole body vibrated with weariness, and he felt like his magic was depleting. Harry was tired of this, and he realised that this was exactly what Crouch had wanted. Make them tired, and drain them down before he himself would face them.
"It looks like it, yes," Harry sighed. "At the moment it looks like that you're getting arrested for only speaking to anyone who ever even saw a Death Eater from a mile away. It's entirely random and they won't even tell us what's going on. I met Kingsley today and honestly? He looked worried."
The owl looked and behaved like a posh idiot, it didn't even look at him and Harry could swear that if the owl could pull up an eyebrow and sigh annoyed, this bird would do so. It
"Of course you do, you fucking moron! Glad it only took you nearly dying and me screaming at you to realise!"
"Like I said, Moody made some adjustments to the house after Dumbledore died. We can't get rid of him. So he's now Dustledore, welcoming all my guests with grace and dignity. Just like the portrait of—"
"Yes, but now it's me who has to go and find said lost and traumatised trainees. I don't know if that's much better," Draco sighed.
Sitting down in the same spot as the previous night, Harry waited for Hermione to open the meeting. But, before she could do so, George burst through the door, panting and heavily out of breath. The wizard sank down into a chair. "News. I have..." he said gasping for air, "news. Heard something just as I wanted to close the shop."
"Yes, I know Mrs Weasley. But you know how it is, life gets busy and I'm usually just happy to get some peace from this one," Draco nodded towards Harry. "So I usually enjoy the silence at home while everyone else is here."
It's only dinner. We can be civil guests without showing obvious affection to each other since that wouldn't be good manners anyway, and once they've cancelled the arrangement I can tell them we broke it off. Sounds like a solid plan to me.
Harry nodded before climbing on Draco's lap, heart beating in his throat as Draco started stroking him.
Just as Harry was thinking about calling it a night, Draco got up from his seat. He held out his hand and smiled.
"I mean, if you look at Draco, he's also rather scrawny." Squinting at Draco's unmoving body, Dudley sighed. "Should we wake him?"
"You can go and ask them." The witch smiled. "Whomever volunteers can go and help you. That house was already in a bad state when we used it as Headquarters. Just make sure they come back two days before our children return," McGonangall said, looking at him over the thin metal frames of her glasses. "And Mr Potter, make sure to keep this trouble away from Hogwarts this time. I won't have a repetition of last time. Stay in contact, I want to know what's happening."
Taking time off work thankfully was an option they could afford, Harry had no idea how else they'd manage. At this point it was painfully clear why not many male couples went for that option. But imagining Draco having all the issues he was currently suffering from was much worse than having them himself. Harry would carry his weight in their pregnancy, even though someone could have warned him.
He wasn't keen to find out what waited for him on the inside. He hadn't met his flatmate yet, but if he was anything like the building itself, Draco would contemplate the cardboard box on the streets again.
"It's a scratch, it'll heal just fine, stop making a fuss," Harry replied, his fingers automatically reaching to the cut on his cheek. It stung under his fingers. "Greg came over today and asked what he should bring. I told him to bring snacks, I hope that's okay," Harry said, trying valiantly to change the subject.
Thankfully Mrs Weasley called them to the table shortly after, and Harry was happy at the prospect of getting some space between them. Until he realised that Draco had been seated opposite him, so he'd have to look at him all night long.
Harry felt like she was making fun of him, but when she turned around to face them again she still looked tense and worried. Harry decided to let it slip. Hermione was right; she always was. The three of them had a world to save once again. "Of course. Let's deal with Robards first, you're right."
"I vote we drink ourselves silly tonight and take care of the rest tomorrow. I know the Aurors don't work on Saturdays unless it's absolutely necessary. And seeing that Harry is here it probably isn't," Pansy said, lifting her glass in a wry toast.
He had told Harry that the Healer had to ask for a second one to come and check the result because it was so rare. In fact St. Mungo’s had never seen something like that happen before, their previous fastest was four months, and Draco was glowing from pride as he told Harry exactly what had happened, and how everyone had looked at him in disbelief.
Harry finally got him with a Blasting Curse that threw Jasbert six feet backwards, deep into the forest. It left him unconscious.
Taking a quick look around, Harry could see just exactly how terrified his friends were. He noticed Greg's grey-tinged features and George's extremely white face. Pansy's entire body was shaking as she leaned against the wall. Draco looked the least perturbed, as if this chaotic scene hadn't taken much of a toll on him.
Getting up, Harry stretched before he slipped into his Auror robes and tied his boots just a bit tighter. Still closing all the buttons and clasps on his robes, he made his way over to Robards' office.
"What the actual fuck is going on here?" Ron asked, open mouthed as people rushed past them and scarcely looked in their direction.
"I have a few questions. Give me a second…" Harry felt his thoughts racing through his mind. Draco wasn't safe, not here, not with all those nosey people lingering outside believing the rumors. Taking a deep breath, Harry looked at Draco on the bed, allowing his eyes to drift down to Draco's belly for the first time.
"He's just being dramatic. How about I'll treat you to a good dinner, now that you're feeling a bit better? You can tell me some embarrassing childhood stories about Potter. And then we can send him a letter and see if he gets it. We could also send one to one of his friends. I'll bet Longbottom can help. I know he'll get our letter."
"No. But they didn't ever help me down here. You spent half of your training here and even stayed to have lunch with me, so I'll gladly help you get your files first before I take care of the others."
Taking a deep breath, Draco lifted his hand to knock on the door. But it opened before his knuckles could hit the worn out wood.
"This means we're all in danger. I've heard the rumours, heard about people disappearing once the Ministry got their claws into them. But those were criminals, not random people! I thought maybe they were thrown into Azkaban for a while," Pansy said with a low, frightened voice. "What do you mean by random, Harry?"
"Sorry for my friend," the other bloke said quietly. "I bet he's been a handful over the last few months."
It only took a few strokes until he felt Draco's legs tremble underneath him, his breath becoming ragged. The kiss turned more forceful, needy, as Draco's cock pulsed in Harry's hand.
Harry had no idea if this was a good plan. The Unspeakables weren't exactly fond of him, but he knew that he needed to see Draco. Time was of the essence.
Harry was in constant pain, something in either his or Draco's lower back had given up under the pregnancy. Every step hurt, and the hormones didn't help. There was no rest for either of them. Draco was always on his feet watching Harry. And Harry was always on his feet to prepare everything for the baby.
"No." George shook his head. "I have to be here in case they decide to pull a stunt like this in broad daylight. Also school is about to start again, I have to keep the shop stocked."
Nodding, Harry ate the rest of his lunch before he got into his uniform again to pay Robards a visit.
Draco's words surprised him enough to make Harry slip and accidentally step on Draco's foot. He hadn't even thought of that, and no idea why he had said it. But now that he actually did think about it— "I wouldn't say no to having you around more often. See how things will go."
"I'm not here to make any trouble, my neighbour’s dogs pulled me to your tent. Is there anything I can help you with, Sir? Money? Food? Medicine?"
Harry ignored his best mate's very good question in favour of leaving the room to look for a bottle of booze to pour himself a drink.
"The most loyal one. Crouch Junior. They didn't kiss him, they listened to him, he's— He did unspeakable things to us. Gawain fell for his promises, he paid for it, we all will."
There was absolutely no reason to keep it. Draco spent all his time in Harry's house now, while Greg had offered Dudley the chance to move into his place rather than staying at the shitty little apartment. It was an offer that Dudley gladly accepted.
"I can handle a few plants myself, Potter. If you come with me I'll have to babysit you and make sure they don't eat you. Stay here, I'll come back, and if something happens, I'll scream."
Agreeing, Ron waited for Harry to place the charm on himself before he did so too. Then they were ready to make their way down the staircase and go and investigate.
," Ron mumbled as soon as Hermione had finished her work, and they all stood back and held their breath, waiting for Mrs Robards to wake up.
"Thank you for the invitation, Mrs Weasley." Draco smiled at her, still slightly overwhelmed. "I know you said no present, but I already had some so I brought them along."
At least their dinner dates continued. Maybe they weren't as regular as before, but they still met at least once a month. Which also meant that the stories of Draco's adventures in the Muggle world and their strange unfathomable technology, never got too boring to have as a topic once in a while.
Snapping out of the feeling of being lost, Harry shook his head. Draco's hand on his arm was all it took to vanish the feeling of overwhelming sadness from his mind. "
"Because then we'd have to put our everyday glasses up there, and as much as I like you, that won't happen," Harry replied, unable to keep the fondness out of his tone.
"I don't know. Could have been us by the way they were coming at us. Could have been our witnesses, or anything else." Harry cast his eyes all around Knockturn, like the old stones held the answers.
Something about Robards' smile made Harry feel uneasy, but he couldn't do anything about it immediately. All he could do was leave and join Ron in their tiny crammed office that reminded Harry strongly of how Mr Weasley's looked when the two of them were growing up. At least they had a window even though it always seemed to rain when Harry decided to look outside.
"Oh." That was quite thoughtful of Malfoy. Not that Harry would say that out loud. But he absolutely wasn't happy about the whole Manor part. Not having to step foot inside the Manor helped a lot.
Taking the Floo, they all went to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes one after the other, all stumbling over each other since when they arrived the shop was entirely pitch black.
Sitting down on the bed, Harry hoped this wouldn't go wrong. "There's a lot of people out there. And also a lot of rumors about you and your baby. I don't think you're safe, so I have to—is the father still in the picture?"
"You'll be alright here, won't you? I never asked you if you were okay with this," Harry breathed, still holding onto Draco. "Never asked if this was what you wanted."
Draco let out a long sigh as he plucked a leaf from the bush in front of him, staying silent for a while while, taking it apart.
The later it got, the more relaxed Harry felt. Everything went just brilliant. Draco was an excellent fake boyfriend.
But, thinking about what everyone else could lose if anything went wrong knocked all the air from his lungs. Family, partners, kids, parents, close bonds much deeper than friendship. And Harry couldn't imagine how much more afraid everyone else was. It was all down to them. A ragtag bunch of witches and wizards against the entire Ministry. If anything went wrong, then their whole lives would change forever.
As he stepped out of the Floo Harry did indeed find Draco already sitting on their sofa nursing another glass of whisky.
"Sorry, promised George I'd help him at the shop first thing in the morning," Ron replied, examining the crust of bread that he still held in his hand. "I know how nights with the Slytherins usually end so I'll do the wise thing and stay at home."
Pulling Draco into a hug, Harry hoped he'd understand how much this small gesture meant to him. Draco obviously cared, and so did Harry.
"Pebble? Could you come to my home for a minute?" Harry asked into the room, and not even a second later the elf appeared in the middle of the room.
"Maybe. What do you think we're doing when you wander off to Mr Weasley? Sitting around in silence?"
"We can do that later," Harry replied with a decisive shake of his head. "I'll get my cloak and come back, then we can go to your places one after the other. I'll pack Draco's stuff while I'm at home."
Harry's blood froze at this question. If they were going to bring in all those people and if Robards was asking specifically for Draco, that couldn't mean anything good for the wizard. "Yes, sir. We still live together. He's working for the Ministry as I'm sure you know."
"Dodging my question about doing something stupid, I see." Mathilde laughed her rich laugh and shook her grey locks which made her heavy earrings swing around. "I'm wise to your tricks. Tibbles still has his cough, he's taking veterinary potions once a day now and feeling a lot better. And I'm doing just fine, you know me. Nothing can shake me up. So where's your list? I can get to it right away."
"I had a lot of fun today, thanks for coming with me," Harry said, quiet enough so only Draco could hear.
Huffing, Harry looked down at the note with the address and he checked it against the street they were in currently. "I think two houses down?" he said, squinting behind his glasses. "It looks rather Muggle to me, what do you think?"
"Jesus Christ, Malfoy. Stop fussing, your plan is good, it'll work. You're way too nervous which makes me nervous too!"
Looking over at Draco, Harry furrowed his brows. "How was it, to be on the other side of this?" He frowned. He wasn't making himself very clear. "I mean. Did Voldemort or your father expect us to come barging in? I never asked before."
"I'll say I told him about it and that's where the idea came from. I don't think they'll even remember it by then."
In agreement, Harry looked at all the worried faces surrounding him before he let out a slow sigh. "I think that's all we can do for tonight. Everyone who can help should be here tomorrow again, maybe a bit later than today." He played with the cuff of his shirt as he spoke, feeling the anxiety course through his blood. "By the evening we'll know what is going to happen next and which steps we should take from there."
"Oh right, forgot about that," Draco laughed, pulling his wand from his pocket. "I really like that one, It makes us see each other but nobody else can unless I put the spell on those too. Found it in a book at the department."
Sighing, Harry inspected the cut on his cheek for a last time before he went to check what Draco needed.
"Okay, let's hurry. Stay together!" Harry said, starting to lead everyone out of the room, guarded by Ron's shield.
Suddenly the dogs stopped, and Harry looked up from his desperate tries to ditch the worst thorny traps on the path. A tent. There was a tent, in the middle of nowhere. And somebody in this tent had a bad cough from what he was starting to hear.
"I have a bad feeling about this. It won't end well for any of us," Greg said with a shake of his head, before grabbing the whisky from the table and refilling his glass with a shaky hand.
"Bedrooms," Harry answered, gesticulating at the surrounding building with his arms "Four for now. Some of my friends will be staying here until further notice, and there might be more of us in a while."
"I'll come back once we've finished our work tomorrow, Mr Potter." Bowing again, Pebble left with a pop and Harry looked over at Hermione with a grin.
One after the other left the room, whispering their goodbyes and patting Harry on the back, until only Ron, Hermione, Harry and the Slytherins were left.
"Hi Mathilde! I thought I'd give you some time to please the masses before I come here to trouble you, too. How are you? And the cats? Did Tibbles ever stop coughing?"
I beg you, Potter, please help me out of this, and also spare a poor witch the disappointment of having me as her husband.
"Yes. Just made the decision to go in after the first contact on the list we were given. Recluse living in the forest, goes by the name of Jasbert, nobody knows what his real name is according to his case files," Harry said, glancing at Robards before looking back at Kingsley. "Sir, do you mind if I ask—"
Pansy bent down to inspect Harry's face and let out a sigh. "Never thought it'd be possible to make you even uglier. I have no idea what Draco sees in you," she smirked.
Turning around, Harry found Draco walking back into the kitchen, Invisibility Cloak already in hand. Harry's eyes flicked over the blond Slytherin. Even though he was worried, he was glad to have the man by his side.
He remembered vividly how often she had cursed Ron, and wished for him to suffer with her when she was pregnant with Rose.
Draco had tried turning on the TV. Dudley had no idea how, but somehow all their channels had vanished. As he sat down in front of the blasted thing to check the wires, and the connections and press random buttons, he couldn't stop himself anymore. He had to ask the question that had been burning on his tongue ever since the first fire had been extinguished.
" screamed both Harry and Ron as a wall of fire rolled towards both of them. The spell took rather too well, and the flames danced and roared. Harry could only hope that their shields would hold up against the raging flames.
"We might even be back in our apartment tonight," Harry grinned, looking up at the swirls and whorls of ceiling plaster. "I'll make dinner and we'll watch telly together."
Turning his head so quick that something in his neck almost snapped, Harry gawked at Headmistress McGonagall. "You're here too?" he uttered, the only thing he could think of to say.
"Why didn't you come downstairs?" Harry asked, feeling puzzled, the same second Ron barked a "We didn't
Malfoy was dead to the world within seconds. He didn't cough much in his sleep, which Harry took for a good sign. Things would get better for him, Malfoy would be healthy again in no time. And then they could take care of their next steps together. Because one thing was for sure, Harry wouldn't let him go back to being homeless.
"The Slytherins should stay here," he stated baldly, his voice confident. "We have to go to work and pretend like we know nothing and then see what happens. Harry, you're the most famous young wizard in England, if you don't go back it'll only draw more attention to Draco not being around. And we need you in the Auror department with Ron because you're the ones in the front line and you'll hear things first there, things the rest of us aren't privy to. Luna and I will go back to St Mungo's, and we'll keep an eye out. We'll let you know if something happens there." He twisted his wand through his fingers, pausing to ensure that the rest of the table were listening. "We have to keep our eyes open now, have to figure out how to end whatever this is before it's too late. And if anything goes wrong we can join the Slytherins here."
"No. This is something else," Ron replied, readying his stance to throw the first hex. "I think you were right earlier today. We'll see if there's something in the newspapers about this, or if Robards calls in a meeting Monday morning." He shook his head, seeming to come to some decision. "If none of that happens we better get our act together and everyone as far away from this as possible."
Humming, Harry got up to get clothes and find his fluffy bathrobe. Nobody deserved to end up like this. Not even Malfoy. He needed to speak to Hermione tomorrow. They had left Malfoy with nothing, and he surely wasn't the only one.
"Yes, for once I do, Harry. This is, as we politicians say, a matter of national security. I can't give you any more details about it." Kingsley's deep voice was steady as he spoke, but as Harry looked closer he could see worried lines appear around his eyes. "Your role isn't to reason, Auror Potter. It's to get out into the field."
It was not a wizard’s tent, that much he was sure about. It was dark, small, and stuffed with different things someone homeless would need to survive in the winter cold. On the left was a heap of fabric and, upon another cough, Harry guessed correctly that there was someone buried under it, trying to stay warm.
"We should get our uniforms, just in case—" Harry's words broke off abruptly as an owl crashed against the window pane outside.
"Well, you could have spared yourself this tiring ordeal by simply asking your son about his own plans. Or, I don't know, maybe by not being trapped in the middle ages?"
"Sure," Harry shrugged and reached for the bottle Seamus held out. This was exactly the calming activity he had needed and it took his mind off the blond conundrum asleep upstairs.
One after the other left back through the Floo. The last ones to go were Ron, Hermione and Harry who decided to wait another ten minutes to see if someone else came to meet them. When they realised that nobody else was coming they gave each other a grim look. It was the three of them facing the world once more.
"Visited first Pansy then Blaise. Mrs Zabini is on her way to France and my mother, and Pansy has a bag packed with her most necessary stuff. They're ready to vanish whenever they need to. Oh and Weasley sent an owl, the letter is on the table. It was addressed to both of us so I made the decision to open it. Granger will arrive early Monday morning, she couldn't rebook her Portkey so we have to wait for your brain to arrive when she was expected to arrive anyway. What did McGonagall say to all this?"
"Stunned him. Listen, I have no idea what attacked us earlier, but you guys are obviously dealing with some very strange shit over here. I'd be happy to not get involved with it in any kind."
"Must be nice to know that he won't ever be after your money," Dudley's wife smiled before she winked at them and left to speak with other guests, ignoring the fact that Vernon was choking on a piece of meat nearby.
Harry decided there was absolutely no point in staying in bed, and ordered Draco to take a bath while he took care of the laundry.
Humming, Harry pointed his wand at the arsehole on the floor, using the fact that he was still knocked out, and cast a full body bind at him. "Let's get you checked. Come on."
"Got the Polyjuice!" Ron called from the other side of the room. "I'll also take some that only carry the healing label and hopefully Draco can tell us a few more details about what they are."
"They're coming for you," Harry said, his voice flat with appalled shock. Whatever we left in our flat is gone for now." Turning to Ron and Hermione, Harry only needed to send them one look and his two best friends understood. Jumping up, they both ran for the Floo to get what they needed from their house before the Aurors, or whoever Robards sent for them, inevitably arrived.
"If it was just a stomach bug it would have gotten better by now. We'll get you to St. Mungo's today, and that's not up for discussion."
"Oh my god you're the worst! It's not like that!" Harry screeched, knowing his face was every bit as flushed as Hermione's was. "I'm just—"
Walking closer to the office, Harry heard the tell-tale sound of hushed voices. Looking around he found the hallway empty, so he crept closer to hear what they were talking about, but it was to no avail. He could only make out a few words, and they were hushed and whispered. It sounded like a private discussion, not any Ministry-related matters.
Three hours and two cauldron cakes later Harry and Draco hadn't made any noteworthy progress. There was some activity at the address: a few ins and outs by scurrying people who all looked rather shady. There was not a single sign of Robards nor his wife.
"You're right," Harry said, holding his wand in white-knuckled fingers "Get ready. Stronger shield probably, do you need us to switch?"
Robards was already waiting for them and Harry immediately sensed trouble. He could tell by the way his eyes jumped from one Auror to the next—as if he was making a mental list of some sort—and Harry knew this would be bad.
Harry stood ready, hidden under his invisibility cloak, behind a huge potted plant, waiting for the signal. Ron had promised him at least ten minutes, maybe more, with the help of some tricky items that were still in the experimental stage at the joke shop.
"If I haven't heard from you within a minute I'll come through anyway," Draco snorted, not taking Harry's serious Auror voice as a threat. "I won't let you fight those crazy bastards on your own once again."
"What the fuck were they doing here?" Ron panted, every bit of colour having drained from his face. He looked as upset as Harry felt.
"I don't know. But I won't complain about it." Harry grinned as Draco finally closed his arms around him too.
The slightest inconvenience and he broke down, sobbing like the end of the world had reached them. And the worst part was that it wasn't only if something happened to him, no.
"Will you keep us updated, Harry? If they're after you too, then all of us need to be prepared to leave our homes, and I don't know about you, but I'd rather start right away. And maybe stop at the homes of a few other friends and tell them what's going to happen so they can get ready," Neville said, his voice resolute while looking at all the other worried faces in the room.
Harry could see that his best mate was suspicious. "Yeah, it all felt a bit off. But I couldn't really ask what she was doing there, could I? Robards told me to send a report when we're back, that's all."
, I don't give a shit about my own name. I haven't planned to get married to anyone ever seeing that the risk of my spouse being nothing but a crazy fan would always be there. So I'm rather content with this. You're not a crazy fan, therefore not the worst match."
Biting his teeth together, Harry tried to keep his head as still as possible while Pansy did her work. He hated the feeling of skin knitting itself together. Mixed with the burn of dittany on his open wounds it was nearly enough to make him want to scratch off his face. But he only clenched his hands into fists and kept still until Pansy told him he could finally move again.
Humming, Harry glanced at Ron's notes and came to a halt in front of Mr Peck's scuffy, shabby little book shop. "I bet not even Hermione would want books from here," Harry said with a shiver. "They look like the Horcrux book she got from Dumbledore's office. Remember how disgusted she was?"
"Yes, Professor McGonagall. Thank you for lending me the elves, I'll send them back in time. You can rest assured that they'll be well looked after. And of course I'll keep you updated on the situation, or rather Hermione will once she's back from Australia."
"Nice try! Why don't you show your face instead of letting us walk into traps!" Draco shouted, his voice loud and ragged, full of an anger that had lain unrevealed for years. "The Dark Lord would be ashamed of your pathetic efforts to stop us! He at least had the balls to show his true face once he was confronted!"
Grabbing Mrs Robards' arm, Harry Apparated them both to Grimmauld Place, knowing that every second would count, and that they were disappearing as quickly as grains of sand though a time now.
A net of magical traces appeared around them, shimmering and shining in the afternoon sun. Harry realised with horror that they had long passed the line where no magic was present, which could only mean that Jasbert already knew they were coming. "Fuck."
There were half the staff of Hogwarts, including Hagrid, and as Harry looked behind him, he laughed out loud at who else he saw. Narcissa Malfoy, and a tall, very elegant lady who must be Blaise's mother standing back and looking at the crowd in front of them.
Smiling up at him, Harry held out his hand, hoping that Draco might help him up. "I knew you'd come. I promised you we'd have dinner together. You never let a dinner invite slip."
The mess was perfect. Absolutely perfect. Harry took a moment to marvel at Draco's sticky t-shirt before all his energy left his body and Harry went slack against him.
Slipping into the huge bed, Harry placed his glasses on the bedside table, and yawned. This bed was so far beyond comfortable that it was ridiculous, and due to not sleeping a wink earlier, Harry fell asleep within seconds. He was finally dry and feeling cosy and warm.
"That won't be necessary." Robards smiled as he stood up. The interview was over. "That's all, Auror Potter. You can leave and get to work now."
Laughing, Harry scribbled a quick 'We're back. Holding Cell 15. Potter, Weasley' onto a memo and, with a quick swish sent the memo flying off to find Robards before he and Ron filled out the report.
"It was frightening," he said eventually, throwing the remains of the leaf onto the floor. "I was expecting your lot to come, hoping for it even. Everyday was an exercise in fear. But it didn't happen, Harry. The Dark Lord only feared Dumbledore, but not enough to be worried that he might just come knocking on our door. Father—well, he'd lost half his marbles by then. He was jumping between knowing that nothing would ever happen to him since nobody would dare to come over… and then he'd be broken in terror, fearing that even we were after him." Draco sighed and looked very sad. "I'm glad to not be on that side again. I know this much: I wouldn't get through it again. I wouldn't survive. To be fair, your side might look safer, but it really isn't. So"—Draco shrugged, his small confession drawing to a halt—"we'll see. Was it like this the last time too? For you and the others, I mean."
"Well, this was an evening that didn't exactly go as planned. What do you think is going on, Potter? The truth."
"I think so too," Draco sighed. "Let's go and see what's going on. Let's just hope he didn't die again."
It felt like he had been looking for an eternity, sprinting towards every unruly-mob-haired-person just to realise it wasn't Harry. And there were many of those in Florida, it seems. The second they were back in London, Draco needed to make an emergency comb purchase and send them all over here. If only to spare another poor soul this torture. Maybe Potter's next husband seeing that Draco would gladly sign the divorce papers right then and there.
At that Harry had to laugh. "Is that so? I already see you in the office of the Headmistress once a week because you're not happy with something, and be it the quality of the pillows they have."
"I have an idea, Potter." Draco stepped between him and Ron and started some complicated wand movements as he whispered, "
And the arm stayed there for most of the day. Malfoy made sure to touch him at any given time, there was no chance anyone would look at them and confuse them as friends. Not with the way Draco cooed over him at any given moment.
"We'll talk about this tonight, yes?" Harry asked, hoping that nobody was trying to listen into their conversation. This was the Ministry and the walls had ears.
Nodding at Harry, Ron was the first to go into the house before Harry followed them. Inside it looked just like Neville's place, but even worse. There were plants with multicoloured tentacles and fangs, others with tendrils that curled over the floor and walls all the way up to the ceiling, making the place look like an overgrown cave rather than a house.
Malfoy had found the sofa by now, and made a big show of theatrically falling down on it. He exclaimed: "Greg is balls at silencing charms, and there are things I simply don't want to hear."
Harry wasn't suffering from a stomach bug, but plain morning sickness. And that was only the first symptom to come. Harry knew that because he actually
"I haven't seen anything! You don't need to take me in!" the man answered in a panic, the words rolling over each other in his haste to say them.
"Sadly, yes." Turning to face Draco, Harry grabbed him by his shoulder to stop him from getting any closer to Grimmauld Place. "There's something you need to know before we go in. Once I open this door, there will be a very creepy version of Dumbledore waiting for us. And I'm not going to lie, this scared the living shit out of me when I first saw it. It's a spell, an illusion installed by Moody before he died. It'll lock our tongues and make us unable to speak, but it only lasts a few seconds. Just…be prepared for it, yes?"
Slipping out from behind the plant, Harry crept into the office and quietly closed the door behind him, going straight to work.
"I don't think we need to take such extreme measures," Harry said. "This chap has been through a lot." Thinking for a second, Harry walked to the back room and found a fireplace there. "We could ask for backup to take him? There's a fireplace, I'm sure it's connected to the Floo Network."
Another round of drinks, another song, and Draco found himself asking Mrs Weasley for a dance through the stuffed living room. He started grinning as he saw that her already rosy cheeks darkened even further as she agreed.
Excited like a small kid on Christmas Morning, Harry jumped up to get scissors and his clippers. If he got rid of the worst matting first then he wouldn't have to shave everything off, which would make Malfoy look more like Malfoy again.
"Too many," Harry answered. "There were the wizards who went to and from the bakery, plus the others that dragged Robards back in and at least one other."
They didn't get far, but Harry had expected that much. No matter how many spells Harry's Army might use, it seemed the Ministry had been taken over by the wrong kind of people after all. They wouldn't just let them pass through.
Robards and his wife, one man he definitely knew from the Death Eater hearings but who had slithered away, and another one who looked like he was half-human, half-swamp-thing.
Crossing his fingers, Harry hoped that Mrs Robards knew who was behind it. They'd be truly damned if she didn't.
It'd been months since Harry had gotten to leave early, and he already felt full of dread that he wouldn't be able to enjoy the extra time off since he had to arrange tonight's meeting.
Remembering the portrait of Mrs Black and Dustledore waiting right in their places in the Entrance Hall, Harry bit his lip. "I hope they didn't give you a headache."
And at least Draco got to have a laugh about it once Harry calmed down. He wouldn't make the mistake of laughing while Harry had his meltdown still ongoing again.
Harry immediately felt his mood improve. "We'll come over tonight, yes? Or do you think coming to our place would be better?"
Thirty minutes later the atmosphere started to slowly change from deeply worried to tipsy chatter, when a bright idea suddenly shot through Harry's mind. It was simple, and brilliant, and he couldn't for the life of him think why it hadn't come to him before.
He thought about calling for Hermione, so she could check the letter and tell him what she thought. He wasn't sure if Malfoy, if this really was Malfoy, would appreciate Harry outing him to Hermione.
"You fucking idiot. So much for promising not to fucking die again!" Draco screamed as he walked towards him. "You could have waited! Or pulled me along! You know I would have come with you! And now you're here and your entire face is cut open and you're barely alive anymore!
"That's a bit drastic, don't you think?" Hermione asked, looking with concern at the other witch. "We should try less invasive things first and keep illegal drugs, potions, and the use of force as the very last option!"
"I don't think I'll get a third chance so I'll try my very best to stay alive," Harry chuckled lightly, wanting the look of anxiety to leave Draco's face. "Don't worry, we'll be fine."
Sighing, Draco walked down the flight of stairs that would eventually lead him to the kitchen while swinging his wand at the decorations he had put up, making it all fly back into the boxes he hadn't even put away. He needed tea, maybe spiked with something that'd make him drunk enough to fall asleep and forget it was Christmas.
"Once all this is done I'm going to quit the Aurors and go back to Hogwarts. I really miss it," Harry sighed, feeling wistful. "Isn't Filch due for retirement? I could take his position."
"Don't pretend like you won't come to Grimmauld straight after work anyway," Draco snorted as he discovered Harry watching him steal all the sweet and savoury snacks and empty the pantry. "You won't be able to keep away, Potter! I'll have dinner for you when you arrive. Well, that is if the others decide to leave you any!"
"You could have let me die out there, but instead you take me home and let me taint your space with my dirt. And all this even though you know that I'm not welcome in any part of the wizarding world and that I'll never be able to repay you for your help."
and pushing it to the middle of the table. "I think Arthur could have some information on where to get started when events like these happen. If not him, then Molly. Both her brothers were in the Order at the time they died, she has to know how Dumbledore made the organisation."
"If I can't leave, the others also shouldn't go, Potter," Draco said, his cheeks flaming. "I'm not some wet-behind-the-ears first year baby! Just check if it's safe to come through first, I'll even wear your damn cloak for packing," Draco carried on, his voice annoyed.
Ignore the so called life debts, but you fucking owe me for this one. Plenty! This certainly was not what I thought of when I told you to contact me. Pick me up whenever, I won't dress up for this.
"That she surely does," Professor Flitwick nodded. "She'd have done very well in Ravenclaw. But I always understood why she was sorted Gryffindor."
He still didn't even stop when Greg had left and Harry reassured him once more that them cheating must have been the reason that Ron had lost that badly, knowing fully well that they had lost because none of them actually knew how to play poker.
Greg had stayed too, flapping through a prospectus he'd found on the kitchen table. He looked much too calm for this disaster. Draco was catastrophizing and already saw himself finally locked up in Azkaban, key thrown in the sea and never able to leave his cell again.
"Because I want you to be extra careful today. And if something feels off I want you to go home and ward the entire apartment until I finish work. Whatever this is, it's not normal protocol."
"Hmm maybe it's a spell? To hide it from Muggle eyes, something to make it look unsuspicious? We'll see once we're there."
Looking around until he found him, Harry instantly walked towards him to take the empty spot next to him. His legs carried him over unconsciously. Harry didn't care what the others might think of that, he just needed to make sure Draco and the others were okay.
They also bought about five stores empty and had gotten everything they could think of, even though it was hell to get neutral clothes for tiny humans. Everything was either pink or blue which was a real pain in the arse.
He sat down in the small cafe near King's Cross station and waited for his new boyfriend for the day.
Draco laughed. "Are you proposing to make this more than a one time event, Potter? Here I am, thinking this fun will end soon."
And to make things even more perfect there was a bowl of steaming soup waiting for him on the coffee table.
This move was the most impressive thing Harry had ever seen happen on those grounds, so he got up and clapped for whoever it was. It was entirely surprising then, when Harry found himself in a full body bind and dropping to the ground the next second.
"Again with the observations. Well done. Take a good look at me and my misery and then leave, Potter. I don't fancy people watching me die."
Ron worried his brows, but sent him a short nod. Harry knew that he could trust the wizard with his life. "Yeah. I can do that," Ron answered shortly. "Also, I think we should go to Knockturn Alley tomorrow. We could subtly ask a few questions about Friday night and hope they know what happened and who those people were."
Harry knew them but couldn't put his finger on what they were. He felt like the answer was on the tip of his tongue. It left him all cosy and warm, so perhaps wasn't a good thing right now, he decided. He needed to keep his wits about him.
Draco stared at him in shock. But after a few seconds he took a deep breath and gave Harry a sharp nod.
Harry didn't answer, instead he leaned forward to kiss Draco first. He absolutely wouldn't mind seeing him again. Not at all.
Laughing, Harry led Malfoy upstairs and into the small, unused, bedroom. "Next time just let yourself in. I really don't need that picture in my mind. I surely won't sleep tonight thanks to you."
Arthur looked over the brink of his glasses, his pale gaze full of concern. Harry knew he'd already lost so much., "What do you want to do?"
Draco didn't move his hand away, and neither did Harry, as they stayed in bed together waiting for the hour to pass.
"Hermione won't be here for lunch today. She's at her parents place this weekend, left this morning," Ron said absent-mindedly as he looked at the sandwich he had brought along with him. "I should have put more mayonnaise on this I think."
Deciding the soup was good enough now, Harry filled two bowls and carried them to the living room. He found Malfoy lying on the sofa buried under at least five blankets.
Biting his lip, Harry looked at Ron who only shrugged his shoulders. He didn't want to place Draco in a risky situation, not if it was as present as it was right now. But Harry knew, also, that he wasn't playing fair. Draco was a fully grown wizard so he couldn't really tell him no and let the others go and get their things themselves, could he? It was simply easier for Harry to collect Draco's things without placing him in danger than it was for the others to collect their belongings.
"Cut off your—? I actually have a Muggle thing here that'll cut them down evenly if you want to get rid of them." Harry would have been lying if he'd said that cutting off Malfoy's hair wasn't something he'd dreamt about since they'd both been at Hogwarts.
On their way Ron and he caught several hushed whispers, people speculating about what had happened, or perhaps might happen. The worst part was that many of them were staring blatantly at Harry and Ron.
"How the fuck did you even see them from over there?" Harry asked as he picked up the toast he had dropped onto his plate.
Sighing, Harry turned to leave the room but he stopped dead in his tracks when he spotted Draco leaning against the door, watching him.
Now that Draco once again was right next to him, once again in full-body contact, and still wearing Harry's jumper, he instantly panicked again. He surely didn't hate Draco. Not if the view of him, all soft and sleeping, made his heart beat faster and the nerves spiralling through his tummy instantly return.
Next to him, Ron shook his head; only a small gesture, but big enough for Harry to know that talking wouldn't take them very far in this case. He was right. Jasbert was obviously paranoid and detached from reality. If living in a forest far away from everything wasn't a big enough hint, then his frenzied, angry words definitely were.
"You know that's not true. And even if it is, day drinking isn't a solution for that problem," Hermione said drily, rolling her eyes as she tried to take the bottle of Odgen's away from Harry, but he held onto it, his hands as firm as any Sticking Charm.
"Fine. But first we have to visit the holding cells. There's a person I need to set free if she's still there," Harry said, hoping badly that Mrs Millen would still be sitting there waiting.
"He would deny it if he could but he's out cold so I tell spill all the beans. All of us know it. One must be blind to not see it." Greg laughed and shook his head.
"And how many people are there?" Ron asked, Accio'ing a whisky glass and pouring himself an inch of the amber liquid.
Nodding, Harry looked down at his own wand. He had read about Malfoy being exiled in the Prophet. But he had never thought about what that'd mean for the man. Harry had expected for him to leave and play Muggle in one of the Malfoy's many houses elsewhere on the world. "Thanks Luna. Is there anything important I should know?"
At this point, it was rather ridiculous to watch, and Draco could swear he saw Castiel rolling his eyes.
One after one, the entire family left the room wishing everyone a good night, until it was only him and Harry left, swaying to a soft song under the light of a Christmas tree.
The floor underneath their feet was nearly hot enough to melt their shoes, but Harry pressed on, making as much ground as possible. This was their moment, their one shot. Harry couldn't afford to lose even an inch.
"No. Yes. I don't know. Harry, something is wrong, something is happening and I don't know what it is. Do you know what is happening?"
He stopped sprinting after only a few seconds. That was when he was near enough to make the man out and decided to get the fuck away from him.
"Good," Draco said, obviously cheery now that he had gotten his way. "Let's see what room the elves have prepared for me. If it's anything less than the Master Bedroom I'll throw a fit, Potter! It's a Black house and I'm a Black after all."
So instead they got up and took a shower, Harry helping Draco to scrub him down seeing that his belly was too big to even cover the basics. They had gotten to be a good team over the last few months.
"What the hell are you?" A low voice growled into his ear. "You can't be an angel, Cas would have known. So what are you? A demon?"
Humming, Draco downed half of his drink before he leaned onto Harry's shoulder. "Tonight was…not nice to watch. It reminded me of the war. I have no idea how you can work as an Auror. All this fighting—the offensive spells, the intrigue—aren't you sick of it?"
"Maybe it's just because you're not used to having him around for stakeouts, mate. I wouldn't worry too much about it, honestly," Ron added, giving Harry's back a chummy slap.
Thinking for a second, Harry gave her a nod. "I'd appreciate that, Professor. That's probably the safest way. We'll wait here for you."
"Harry knew what he did by asking Britain's best house-elves for help, I see." Hermione smiled and Pebble made a tiny squeaky noise that made Harry grin widely. His other best friend truly had the gift of the gab. "Thank you for your help, Pebble, we truly appreciate it."
Smiling, Harry promised her they would if Malfoy was awake. That made her visibly cheer up before she left.
At first he had suspected his new flatmate to be an alien, seeing that he had no idea how to do anything around the flat. He didn't even know the names for anything, and Dudley had been forced to explain to him everything painstakingly slowly and in great detail without forgetting a step of the process, else it'd end very badly.
"Mum, you’re scaring him. I'm sure our little snake would never lie to you," one of the twins chimed in with a snort.
at Crouch, making sure he wouldn't be able to move even if he woke up again. Then Draco left the room and returned a minute later with Pansy beside him.
Shaking his head, Ron copied the names onto an empty sheet of parchment and handed it to Harry before he sent him off.
Focusing on filling his mind with all the warm feelings and memories he could think of, Harry tried once again. "
"Okay. Yes. If something's off I'll leave." Draco bit his lip and looked around. "Thanks for warning me. We need to invite the others tonight, let them know what's happening."
Seeing that this wasn't a regular pregnancy, Draco and he had to wait for the okay from their Healer.
"What the fuck?" he muttered, looking at Draco to see if he had a better idea of what was going on before their eyes.
"Okay, perfect. We have another team at Robards' house. I know you want to get going right away but we have to watch him at least for today. I really believe it's better t get a picture of what's going on before we go in." o
"I wish we could go in there now. They're sleeping, so easy targets. We'd be in and out in less than 10 minutes," Draco huffed, annoyed, after checking the time with a hurried
Suddenly all eyes were on George while he tried to catch his breath. "There were guys behind my shop. Wanted to take the rubbish to the bins, so I eavesdropped on them. Don't think they noticed me. At first I didn't notice them either, but then I heard Robards' name and, well… that got my attention."
Draco tried for another few minutes to make small talk, but Castiel didn't seem too interested in having a chat so he stayed quiet while they looked for Harry and Dean, asking random people if they had seen them but to no avail.
All in all Dudley was an okay guy. He worked longer hours than Draco did, which allowed him to use his magic for the basic cleaning tasks he had to do around the apartment. By the time Dudley came home Draco had finished his cleaning jobs and was mostly reading or browsing the internet, one of his new found favourite things to do.
"You really have to stop that, mate," Ron said, as soon as he discovered Harry who was rubbing his shin and feeling very sorry for himself.
At that Ron's ears started to burn pink, or perhaps it was just the colour blanching from his face, but thankfully he managed to get out of the Ministry before anyone bar Harry could notice.
"Mum?" Ron's face displayed pure horror, but then it switched to confusion as soon as Hermione ran up to them.
Smiling gratefully, Harry took the files from her and left to dive up the spiral staircase back to Ron.
