Draco sighed as he was led away and gratefully took his wine. With as little refinement (involving meals anyway) that he had ever shown during their short time together, he proceeded to down the toxic liquid as of it were a shot glass. Half was gone in a flash. The rest he decided to savor as he quirked a brow at Harry, but didn't comment; just smirked around the lip of his glass. It was the first time Harry had ever told him not to help clean after a meal and just relax...
Draco's face, once pink from Harry's delightful ministrations though calmed in the last minute, flamed up as red as a Weasley's hair. His eyes went wide and he was certain his heart had stuttered a moment. He slammed their mouths together in an energetic kiss, his tongue immediately thrusting past Harry's unresisting lips as Draco turned his head and slanted their mouth firmly together. His hands moved to grasp and squeeze Harry's hardened cock.
Draco tsked and went to baby whatever he had in the pan. Harry sidled up next to him and appraised the multi-part dish he had going. Not too shabby.
"We need to have a little chat,
" Potter complained, rubbing the wound. "That wasn't very nice."
He could practically
He stepped to the edge of the path and away, turning to crook an inviting finger and a smirk to Harry before disappearing into the thick foliage.
Dear Potter,
With Draco laid bare before him and so many truly excellent places he could put his mouth, Harry broke the snog after just a few seconds to move on to unexplored territory. He kissed along Draco's jaw and to the thin skin behind his ear, trailing the pointed tip of his tongue down to Draco's fluttering pulse point. His prick, never having fully calmed after Draco's attentions at the Hall, was painfully hard and leaking. He ground down on the thigh between his legs and moaned against the side of Draco's throat.
"I like you," Potter proclaimed. "Rather a lot." Fucking Gryffindors interrupting perfectly good shagging for heartfelt bloody declarations. "This is where I'd usually say something smart like 'Merlin knows why,'" he continued, "but I actually do know. It isn't hard to figure out--you're brilliant and sexy and a right pompous git, but you genuinely care about your students and you're braver than anyone gives you credit for.
Harry ground his teeth, the stone of the wall rough beneath his palms. He counted breaths.
I didn't realize you watched me so closely on the pitch. Flying is probably my all-time favourite thing about being a wizard. If I could do it without a broom, I would.
"Well, technically," Draco had to pause between words to catch his breath, "Well, technically, you didn't obey any orders."
He dared to creep out from his hiding spot and balance upright on his hind legs for a better view. Potter seemed close to climax. He wasn't the only one. It was an embarrassing struggle for Draco to keep from humping the ruddy furniture leg (which was a detail he would take to his grave.)
"It's not the only way," he responded carefully after first clearing his throat to dislodge the unpleasant dryness that had settled in. He gestured to a tall, lanky kid in basketball shorts and a loose-fitting tee (Adrian Allard, 16, promising young point guard--torn ACL) doing agility drills with a ladder, and then to a slow-moving pensioner wearing a dull grey sweatsuit (Harold Larsen of Chelsea, 62, hip replacement) huffing and puffing on a stationary bike. "It's perfectly fine, though."
In that case, how do I persuade you?
Draco unlocked the door, but didn't open it. He was washing his face for the fifth time until his skin was flushed and his bangs were damp. He had changed his outfit into a "Harry-approved-for-guests" button-up shirt and folded trousers.
"Come on then," Potter said, holding out his palm for Draco to scamper up. He did, quietly grieving the loss of the delightful camaraderie they had managed to establish, which would fall by the wayside as soon as he was back to his usual self, he was sure.
Isn't it obvious? I would like that very much.
*****
"Mm," he pulled away just long enough to grab a pinch of floo, toss it in, and say clearly (in a dry, raspy voice), "Malfoy Manor," before unceremoniously tossing his lover in--quickly following after with an excited cackle.
Happy Christmas!
At least his embarrassed disappointment was mostly hidden by the mask and relative darkness of the room. Romantic torches burned in scones on the walls and pillars throughout the airy space, casting interesting shadows about the place. Harry left his post to go hide in the sea of anonymity.
He was quick, but Gladys was apparently quicker. Just as he turned he went from the Boy-Who-Lived to the Man-Whose-Arse-Was-Pinched. Her claw-like fingers had snatched forward like a striking snake just in time to latch onto his left cheek in a quick pinch before she settled back in her chair and continued to read her Witch Weekly column. She smiled innocently, despite her obvious leering at the pictures on the page.
"That context definitely helps," he responded truthfully. "I'm glad your mother's on our side. Godrick knows we have few enough allies as it is. I'm sorry I pissed on your excitement about it. I get that it's a big deal."

Malfoy,
When Harry pulled away after a minute, Draco held fast and let himself be tugged under the water, finally releasing the Saviour only to hog the shower spray. He bumped his hip against Harry's to make room.
He spent the rest of the day going absolutely bloody nowhere with Draco's case. More of his time was taken up writing formal requests and rebuttals to Parkinson and Zabini's solicitors than actual investigating. He was pretty sure that was the point. The bastards cited outlandish, centuries old laws that had nothing to do with their clients or the present circumstances, but Harry had to deal with legal to establish that.
Oh, calm down, Draco.
...And that was how Harry found himself an hour later with an unconscious Draco Malfoy in his lap.
Harry snorted, much of his anger forgotten. "Not so bad," he agreed with the reluctant hint of a smile.
Harry lounged against the wall of the Lift and eyed Malfoy surreptitiously--he appeared to be enjoying his biscuit, but his hands shook ever-so-slightly and his startle reflex was high (never mind the fact he was hiding under a heavy winter coat even though the weather was fair). Harry wondered why he'd agreed to come when it was obviously so stressful for him. Could it really be so simple as curiosity about Harry's workspace?
(Yes, I mean my head. My hair may be a bird's nest, but I prefer it to bald.

I still enjoy flying and playing in a pick-up match here and there, but playing professionally holds no appeal. Remember what I said about wanting a normal life? That isn't it. I've got more than enough "fans" as it is.
Draco twitched a little as he noted Potter's inattention to his perfect arse. And it was perfect, dammit! Why couldn't Potter appreciate it the way Draco thought he should?

Potter,
Unfortunately, in addition to being meticulous, Draco was also paranoid--all his journal entries were written in code to protect his secrets from prying eyes, which meant he needed to locate a sympathetic potioneer
Draco smirked, vindicated and smug. Carter had been a good one--too boring to maintain his interest for long, but vocally and enthusiastically appreciative of Draco's talents. It was nice to hear that he was still singing their praises (and rightfully so).
"Then come, Harry," Every word was punctuated by a short, high-pitched groan. Draco's hands slid down Harry's muscular chest and stomach and eventually to his lover's waist. He squeezed the Auror's hips and held there tight as he proceeded to buck back as much as he could onto the cock digging inside him.
is the reason. I haven't forgotten that."
*****
Unless he was simply trying out a new tactic for getting under Harry's skin with the mistaken assumption that he was homophobic.
He snuck out of bed--his efforts at stealth wasted on Draco (who slept like the dead)--and went about his morning routine, content to let the man rest as long as he wanted after the night they'd had.
For his own part, Harry was a far cry from the brash, angry boy he'd once been--
He leaned forward until he could peck Harry's lips, causing his hips to shift until it was his semi-flaccid cock pressing hard over Harry's erection, their chests and abdomens flush.
*****
It took a lot of restraint to keep the grin from bursting on his face as he heard Potter announce his departure to somewhere much more private. He waited until the Auror was out of sight and his two friends were deep in a chat (something about "Baby Cheeks" or something), as if they were the only ones in the world, before excusing himself once again to follow after Potter to the loo. There was only one, but it was large enough on the inside to fit a stadium of people. Draco skillfully dodged hands and conversation alike as he passed through crowd, eventually walking inside the Men's loo with his heart beating loud in his chest.
"Happy birthday," he purred, leaning in for a kiss. Harry was not reluctant in reciprocating. Draco flicked his wand over his shoulder, shutting and locking the door without looking, and took Harry's mouth in a searing, possessive kiss.
, I suppose it's a good thing I'm not as easy as I seem." There was something in the undertone of his words. He smiled as casually as he could muster and moved to settle in the seat directly in front of Potter where his bowl waited. One hand lifted his spoon, but he didn't dig in just yet. "Smells delicious. Glad I helped."
He sighed.
Malfoy had obviously put effort into his appearance. His robes were fine. Sumptuous ice blue fabric with silver embroidery at the edges, flat-fronted and neat at the waist--they made him look like a porcelain doll. His hair was sleek and shinny and his face appeared freshly scrubbed. Harry felt shabby and self-conscious in comparison.
Considering I do nearly all the chores (at your own admission), including the cooking, I think it only fair for you to buy the food.
-- Your friend (I mean it)
He hated weddings as a general principle, unless the people getting married were among his nearest and dearest or there was an open bar. Unfortunately neither was the case that night. Robards, the conniving bastard, had ordered Harry to attend in the hopes of currying favor with the bride's family. Sylvia Rosier had been kidnapped for ransom two months ago and Harry had been instrumental in her safe and speedy recovery. Her grateful parents had insisted he be added to the invite list as a token of their appreciation and he'd had every intention of respectfully declining until Robards caught wind of it and saw an opportunity for political advancement (with Harry as the Chosen Pawn, yet again).
Draco sighed, slowly registering the question.
"How about we leave the loo, quietly walk through the crowd under a Notice-Me-Not, and Apparate to your place? Anti-apparition wards here, I'm afraid."
Of course he'd had this entire philosophical debate while thrusting against another man's erection--and enjoying it quite enthusiastically--so it was really a matter of splitting hairs.
"What is this stuff anyway? It looks like vegetables drowned in brown goo."

Dear Potter,

Exhaling through his nose, he continued, "Sorry to disappoint you, Gladys. I'm actually working on an attempted murder case, as I mentioned before, and I need that list of names to try to identify the suspect. I'm meeting with the victim tomorrow afternoon so I need all the time I can get between now and then to focus on the case."

Harry pulled Draco to himself and apparated directly to Draco's front door with a resounding crack.
Harry cursed himself once more for not thinking before speaking. Would it kill a man to display even a speck of Ravenclaw discretion?
He had to have misheard.
"You is keeping Master Draco up with your unwelcome ruckus," the elf scolded sharply, leveling a gnarled finger at him. "You is to be going. Now."
"Yeah. Of course," Harry promised readily, putting his hands in his pockets to hide how twitchy he was beginning to feel. Standing around and simply chatting with Malfoy was uncharted territory. He was employing a strategy of agreeing to as much as he possibly could without compromising his morals or position at the clinic. It seemed to be working so far.
It is somewhat difficult to regret something that
Ron sat up straight in his creaky wooden chair, planting his feet firmly on the ground. "Ooookay..." he said carefully, noting the strain in his friend's voice. He hadn't expected Harry to defend Malfoy so strongly or to admit to feelings of want...
"You couldn't even give me a chance to change?" Draco clucked his tongue. "Now I'm over dressed." He held his hands at his sides and looked down at his outfit disapprovingly. "Fine," he sighed, since the point was now moot. "As long as you're paying. I will reserve judgement until after I eat the food. Until then, I will attempt to be nice. Attempt," he underscored. "No promises."
"So, not too painful to see it end. Honestly, they haven't had a real marriage for years--it's time they straightened themselves out," Draco mused. "Besides, Mother is young and beautiful, still. She'll find someone else. As for Father? Well, he's still quite handsome himself, but he's too paranoid for anything other than flings at this point."
"It was beautiful. I love music with emotion instead of the usual dead-pan more recent works use. You know, that 'deep' and dark tone that many of today's composers think you've never heard before but had already been mastered and used?"
Draco came soon after Harry with a breathy groan. His hands left their cocks, one going for his wand left on the counter and the other smearing a bit of cum on Harry's cheek with a grin.
as a regular customer), he was not ready to be despoiled in so coarse a manner, and not with an appointment to be kept.
Dear Harry Potter,
Draco felt like he needed a long, looong bath as he finally exited the interrogation room and walked to Harry's office. He hadn't slept since the midnight debacle, though (besides some graying under his eyes) he didn't seem much worse for wear. It was finally time to make his exit, but there was no way in hell he would feel safe enough to go home alone and he wasn't sure Harry was able to leave yet.
"I am concerned about my son and his future," Lucius replied quite calmly as he crossed one leg over the other--knee over knee. His cane was laid across his lap. "If you can be bought, you aren't worthy of him. And if you don't see a future with him then you need to step aside and let someone else in. As long as you're in his heart he will remain tethered, and I don't want him to be wasting his time and emotions on a fruitless tree."
"You're so randy," Draco chuckled breathily as Harry rutted and groaned against his leg. He bucked his hips forward to press his own growing hardness into Harry's hip. "Since this is apparently 'punishment', how do you want me this time? Boss me around, Auror Potter..."

It didn't rhyme and Harry wasn't going to count syllables to see if it qualified as a haiku, but that didn't matter--it was, hands down, the best poem he'd ever heard.
"Take your time," he smiled, coming to lay next to him on the pillow. "You worked hard for that."
Harry hated him with a passion usually reserved for Dark Lords.

"Draco, stop!"
"Are you
Dear Potter,
Harry grinned, happy to oblige. He took over holding Draco's legs and leaned his weight into the next grinding circle of his pelvis. "Like that?" he asked smugly (and unnecessarily given the high pitched whine Draco made in response). He repeated the gesture and Draco's fingers scrabbled on his shoulders, surely leaving welts behind. He kept it up a few times more but as the pressure built in his balls, his restraint faltered. He withdrew most of the way and snapped his hips forward, coming perilously close to coming as his whole prick was squeezed.
Truth.
Draco's arse didn't need much prepping, considering their minutes ago activity, but the feeling of Harry's finger probing around inside once again was pleasant enough that he chose not to complain, point out the obvious, or demand he hurry up. Draco's head fell to the side and his eyes closed as a mewl escaped once the pads of Harry's fingers touched his prostate and rubbed.
Harry nearly choked.
Harry nodded once.
I'm in the kitchens alleviating one of several issues right now. I just ate two sandwiches, three buttery rolls, an entire plate of potatoes and veggies, and I only just got full after two slices of cake... I would say "yes", but in this state I may shag you to death.

"Erm...I know the languages Malfoy is fluent in," he answered sheepishly. "They're in his file. Dutch stuck out at me because I wondered why he'd bothered with it."
He pushed the curtain aside to take a look into Potter's shower. There was some soap, shampoo, a loofa... And a book. One Draco recognized. He grinned wide as he lifted the novel and peered at the cover.

Harry,

Draco breathed a long and happy sigh as Harry came across his arse with a shudder and a hot, wet spurt. He reclaimed the wand that had fallen to the side and undid the spell that bound him. Once Harry was freed, he let go of the wand and instead grasped Harry's hands, gently massaging the abused skin of his wrists with the tips of his fingers as he leaned in to nip and kiss lazily at the Auror's lips.
"Is it Dutch?" Potter asked out of the blue.
Draco fully expected Potter to continue to walk away, but just like old times the Hero ended up surprising him by turning (reluctantly) at the taunt. There was an odd thrill about the way Potter practically growled the words at him. He took another long sip as he considered his response and stifled a chuckle.
"Probably Prince Charming," he settled on finally. "It was the first."
"I'm not as straight as you think I am," he muttered under his breath, smoothing out his robes and assuming Malfoy was too far gone to hear or understand him.

"I've got buckets of unused vacation time," he replied, feigning at lightness. "Figure I'll just camp here on your drive."
Dear Malfoy,
Harry straightened his spine. "It's not like he's never done it before!" he argued hotly, feeling defensive and unfairly like
You talk about my dad as if you went to school with him. What are you basing your information on? If it's stories from your father, forgive me but I am inclined to be skeptical.

"I didn't think so." Arthur rubbed his hands together slowly. "The way I see it, you have several apologies to make. For my part, I am sorry to have put you in this uncomfortable position tonight and that I ever gave you the impression there is anything--
Draco didn't struggle as his wrists were brought together in one of Harry's hands but he couldn't help but writhe and buck as his cock was stroked by the other.
"'Hullo,'" he repeated dully. "'

At this point, Harry wondered if it would be easier to tell her the truth. The chair beneath him creaked as he leaned back to regain a bit of personal space.
"Brilliant. Thanks."
He alternated broad swipes of his tongue with circles around the outside and probing thrusts, working Draco wet and loose until his jaw ached something fierce.
It took Harry a long minute to process Malfoy's question because his brain got hung up on images of the unreasonably sexy blond wanking the days away. (He did not miss the fact that no other men had been listed as inspiration, however.)

He was cut off by the sound of pots and pans and who-knows-what-else crashing to the ground.
"Oh sure," Harry retorted archly, dropping down into his seat (unsure if his legs would have held him steady very much longer). "

He laid back across the visitor's couch with his legs bent, one curling over the edge of the couch with his foot on the floor and the other pressing into the back--leaving his legs wide open. He laughed.
It didn't come. After years of living with Hermione, Ron was finally starting to recognize when he was being manipulated. He simply crossed his arms, sat at the chair behind Harry's desk, and smiled.

Malfoy was his next appointment (which, of course, he'd known without looking) and he didn't have another one scheduled until 4pm, which meant he had
Malfoy just up and left.
"Mm, how about we floo to my place? I have a bed that could fit ten people in my room and soft fur blankets we can roll around on," Draco offered between pants, quirking one brow in challenge. "Or are you scared of being in the home of an ex Death Eater? Very dangerous, I admit. You may not be seen for several days..."
Harry
"Well, I technically didn't go through your things, being as it was right out in the op--" Draco stopped short with a regretful grimace. "Right. I'm sorry. It was just nice that someone I knew liked that schmaltzy romantic drivel as much as I do, that's all."
"You really did miss me," Draco breathed as he lifted up the blanket just high enough to see the action going on beneath. It wasn't the first time someone had his cock in their mouth, but it was the first time Draco felt like he might cum (like a teenager) just from watching. "Ohhh, fuck... Feels so good..."
"I have excellent news! Really excellent! Of course, you may not be affected by it--as it may not mean much to you, but this will make things so much easier when dealing with father!"
He lead Draco to the table and sat down with him, pulling his chair close enough to Draco's for their knees to touch. He was out of his element--uncomfortable, anxious, irritated still, and unsure--but he powered through it for both of their sakes. If they were to have any hope of a future, and that was what he wanted when it came right down to it, they'd have to be able to have conversations like this, fights even, and be okay.
After losing the Aurors and much of his leg, he'd just about lost his mind along with them. His work was everything to him. It gave him meaning. Purpose.
Harry narrowed his eyes, unsure if he should be offended by that comment. Then Draco found the bundle of nerves he sought and Harry felt rather generously toward him after that moment. His head lolled to the side and he almost lost his grip on his legs when they spasmed involuntarily from the electric sensation.

Draco laced his legs around Harry's to bring him closer while his hands slid around to the back and over the Auror's arse. His hands dipped into Harry's back pockets and squeezed.
If it matters to your decision, I will be wearing leathers (though I am exceedingly curious about your inclusion of this detail).
"I want to see you come!"
In "retaliation", he used his leg to rub into Harry's insistent hardness, still partially pressed against his thigh.
The first half, anyway. He still wasn't sure about the second part, but if Draco asked, he probably wouldn't say no. That seemed only fair.
The shagging was particularly nice. Draco got over his 'trauma' right quick and demanded all sorts of experiments to determine what positions he liked best. Harry was only too happy to oblige. (His personal favourite so far was Draco on top riding his cock.)

His eyes glittered mischievously as he eyed the man across from him again, this time with far more appreciation. Potter had scruffy, thick hair that looked shiny and soft; brilliant green eyes that could melt ice or give birth to butterflies with just a glance; and a perfect build, as far as Draco was concerned... far better to be seen in life than in fantasy. He worried his lip once more.
There's the Gryffindor spirit!
"You are quite the Hero, aren't you? Just like in school." The words were fond. "I'll give you the memory, but on one condition."
He could feel Draco's smirk against his neck--kinky bastard got off on the risk of being found. (But Harry, knowing that full well, was the one who'd suggested sneaking off to the garden shed during Rose's birthday party, so he was hardly in a position to judge.)
Draco allowed Harry to control their stride as the Slytherin grew used to having someone inside him. It was only a little different than what he had imagined (he had thought the experience would be excruciating, but was happy to note it wasn't nearly so bad, quite possibly thanks to his years of intense wanking in there.) Once he was certain he could move he began to slowly thrust back, squeezing Harry tight as he fluxed his hips and lower back.

Malfoy didn't appear likely to forget them anytime soon.

Harry chuckled, improbably warm and fond. He was a lucky man.
The whole place had an odd aura to it, something comfortable and heavy like a welcome blanket. Harry's leftover energy was there and the most dominant of all, but so were the energies of a few other wizards and witches--other people who had lived there generations past. Draco felt entirely comfortable in the old mansion, as if he were not only welcomed but

"It has barely been past three months," he argued, setting into a slow, steady rhythm he could maintain for a bit. (Perfect for getting Draco to the quivering, desperate brink without sending him over the edge.) "Cut me some slack."
Harry whimpered, arching against Draco's body in search of the friction he so desperately craved.
"Not yet," he answered brusquely, setting his tart aside--the reminder of that grisly case turned him off eating for the time--and electing to ignore Ron's sass. "I think it was Goyle but that's just a hunch. I'm hoping to have him in for an interview soon and the Unspeakables are checking for a magical signature on the weapon. There's not much else I can do in the meantime."
Harry hadn't actually gotten that far in the plan. Especially not now that he was employing his occlumency lessons to shield some of his more incriminating thoughts from Malfoy.
"I can't really say much," he began as he raked a hand through his hair (and realized he needed another haircut.) "The club was fairly dark. The lights were hovering in a high ceiling. I think his hair was brown? Eyes might have been blue? It was two years ago..."
"I certainly am," Harry retorted smartly, having found his voice at last. "But unlike you, none of the rubbish they print about

He bent to retrieve the shoes and kneeled before Potter to assist him in putting them on. Holding out a hand, he enjoyed the image of the accomplished Auror lifting his skirts and daintily resting a foot in his waiting palm.

Draco gave a rather cheesy laugh.

Malfoy looked like he was seriously considering slamming the door in Harry's face. Harry, for his part, was certain he could force his way inside if he had to, as long as he could do it before Malfoy got the wards back up. A whole team of Aurors hadn’t been able to crack them when they’d gone to arrest the Manor’s occupants in the aftermath of the War; fortunately for them, Narcissa and her son persuaded Lucius to surrender for the sake of their impending trials. In the end, it didn’t curry him any favour, but it helped the cause of the other two plenty.

As if hearing his thoughts, Malfoy combed his fingers through the thin strands to set them as much to rights as he could without magical pomade. Harry fleetingly wondered if he ever used Sleekeazy’s, the ironic source of Harry’s wealth given how untamable his own hair persisted in being. (If he had had any of his family’s giftedness with potions, maybe he could have whipped up a new and improved recipe but, alas, it wasn’t meant to be.)

"At any rate, after a couple minutes of you being nice to me, I realized you must need me for something. You're never nice to me otherwise." Draco wanted to argue that Potter was hardly a paragon of kindness toward him either, but again, now was not the time. "It wasn't hard to put two and two together after that. Since you didn't go to Minerva, I'm assuming you don't want her to know. Which means you probably did this to yourself, yes?"

In response to Harry's warning, Draco drew back, but not all the way off. The knowledge that he wanted Harry to come in his mouth combined with the additional stimulation from his hands was enough to push him over the edge.
The girl placed their food in front of them and offered to top off their glasses. Harry declined. He could pour for himself and he was eager to be rid of her. The house lights flashed, signaling the time to take a seat, while the server continued to bustle around them. Draco looked curious and slightly alarmed.
First name again. There'd been none of that when Granger was around. Draco didn't bother to reply, though he resolved to bite the git if he attempted bringing him to the infirmary.
He knew better than most the sorry lot of Malfoy House-elves. Even if Draco was a kinder, gentler master than his predecessors, an appalling precedent must surely have been set at some point during Bixby’s tenure. And, Harry could admit, his protectiveness of Malfoy was somewhat endearing. Vowing to be more charitable towards the House-elf in the future, Harry made quick work of his t-shirt, trainers, and denims.
Both suspects went perfectly neutral in their expressions at the first hint they weren't there as witnesses and calmly asserted that they wouldn't be answering any questions without their solicitors present. Even if they hadn't made that stipulation, which was well within their rights, there wasn't enough evidence to use Veritaserum. Meaning not only was it a total waste of time, but it served to alert them to the fact the DMLE was suspicious so they would now have an opportunity to cover their tracks.
Draco patted his cheek like a child who needed comfort.
? YOU? But you're a Death Eater! What Auror would want
Flushed with the satisfaction of victory, Harry didn't need to hurry. He was still enjoying the fluttering aftershocks of Draco's inner muscles contracting on his fingers and amazement that the man had actually come from that alone.
Harry found himself in a darkened room in Malfoy Manor, somewhere he hadn't been in many years and, frankly, never expected to be again. Suddenly questioning the wisdom of this plan, he covered his bits with his hands and looked hastily about for unwanted company. Draco stepped gracefully out of the flames a moment later--completely unabashed in his nudity--and sauntered up next to him with a predatory smirk on his face and victorious gleam in his liquid metal eyes.
"Oh that's

"I can still play with it if you cut it," Harry smirked, releasing the strand.

To his displeasure, Draco apparated them without warning while he was mid-thought.
"What's wrong?" he bravely queried. "You're either annoyed at me or worried about something, or both. What did I do?"
"I didn't see it as a big deal," Draco said honestly. "I didn't think. I guess I'm just so used to being told... and observing that sex wasn't much of anything for people that I forgot there is a difference between real consent and what is essentially prostitution. That's why I'm apologizing. But no one else has ever told me or made me feel like my body was worth more than just... I don't know, a

"Well, we killed about ten minutes," he said lowly, so close that he couldn't actually focus on Harry's features, so he swam instead in a dazzling pool of green. "What will we do for the next forty? I'd like to get there at least ten minutes early to ensure our reservations. They're for my favourite room."
"I do," Harry countered truthfully, having met skepticism like Malfoy's before (just never from a wizard). "Especially at the end of the day or if I've been on my feet a lot or it's damp out. But I spent more than a year in occupational therapy strengthening the remaining muscle and learning how to walk again. So I am a living testament to the fact this works." He gestured expansively let Malfoy know what all he meant by 'this.'

"Sorry if I smell like a peasant or whatever. I had to apparate five times in pursuit of a suspect and then chase him on foot through a muggle neighborhood. Didn't have time to shower."
Malfoy was in pyjamas. Why was Malfoy in pyjamas? It was nearly noon and Harry had made an appointment, which Malfoy had confirmed. Yet there he was, half-naked, and wearing...penguin pyjamas.
Draco was dismayed. "You're serious?"

After the shit with Ron that morning had got his blood boiling (with no good outlet for the anger) and then spending the last three hours since receiving Draco's owl half-hard (because he was thinking obsessively about this moment), there was little finesse to his approach.
Draco didn't want to talk about it. That was ok with Harry--he didn't much want to talk about it either. The more time that passed, the more protective he felt and the angrier he got at his impotence there. He wanted Draco safe, and that meant putting the people who'd tried to hurt him behind bars.
Draco continued to stare down at his food and dip his crisp until he finally grew tired of it and set the dripping fry down on his plate. He shrugged as his hands slipped into his lap and his eyes noted the anthill design his ketchup had taken.
Harry'd known that, of course, but he'd still entertained several fanciful scenarios in which it went rather differently. (And a few in which it went
"It's entirely muggle," Harry affirmed, drinking in the sight of Draco so awed. "Just wait til you see the inside."
"Secondly, just take a minute to think about how the situation looked to me, yeah?" he entreated, rubbing small circles with his thumb on Draco's bicep. "I was fairly certain you weren't the one behind the attack but I had to be sure. I am now, so let's get to the bottom of this together. Please?"

," and tugged at Harry's pubes once again. He let go of the black curls to slide lower and tease the edge of the Auror's erection, petting his jutting hipbone and the stretch of skin between cock and thigh.
After a light lunch of stale bread, hard cheese, and lukewarm pumpkin juice, Harry laid down in a bit of shade for a rest. He'd had a crap night of sleep (again) and had been working harder in the last 15 hours than he had since retiring from the force. He was asleep almost as soon as he closed his eyes.
"Hi," he said somberly, trying (and failing) to muster up a convincing smile. "I'm really glad you're here."
At this rate Harry wouldn't last. His legs quivered and his moans grew louder as his bollocks tightened up, but the feel of Malfoy's hot, wet mouth and talented tongue wasn't something he wanted to spoil so soon.
"I'll ride you later if you're good... Hard and fast, the way you like me."
And then there were the ones his own libido suggested.
I happen to know (thanks to a certain female) that you can get (and have had) pretty much anyone you want.
He soldiered on.
Anyway, there wasn't any question about it to begin with, but I can say without reservation that I am glad I wasn't raised in a pureblood home. At least not one like yours. It's a wonder you turned out as well as you have. Now, I mean.
He lifted Harry's hand to his lips and kissed the back, before letting them both drop--still joined--to their sides once more.

"Not at the moment," Harry said, satisfied with his inspection and turning his attention fully to Malfoy. "I've been somewhat…
"You're ridiculous," Potter chuckled. He gripped Draco around the middle and shook him on the desk, pretending to wrestle. "I don't know how much of this is the ferret in you but I hope at least some of it stays," he confessed. Draco latched onto his hand with his forepaws and kicked at him with his back, feeling the freedom to be a good deal more silly than usual. He could grant that this unwanted transformation had had an unexpected benefit or two.
"A procedure to fix your eyes?" A curious brow quirked high upon his forehead and his eyes lit up. "At St. Mungo's? Is it new?"
Dear Malfoy,
(Robards has thoughtfully filled me in on the circumstances of your infection, which you neglected to mention.)
He set an unforgiving pace that made Draco's whole body shudder on impact and their bollocks slap together loudly. Pleasure coiled like a snake in his belly, tight and ready to strike.
(I am, indeed. I'll give that one to you for free since I thought it was rather obvious in my last letter.
“You haven’t even tried,” he countered, the words delivered gently to mitigate the sting. Malfoy‘s frustration was understandable, even without Harry’s first hand experience with disability. Malfoy had dropped the wand three times and been unsuccessful in casting even a basic
It might be fun, but I would have to think about it. That's a lot of media coverage, a lot of screaming crowd, and a lot of hell to come after... Can I at least avoid being hassled before hand?
After, however... You may be late to the next meeting.
"What are your symptoms?" he asked with proper professional detachment instead.
He tightened his fist on the bottom half of Draco's shaft so that Draco would have sensation on the whole length of it and began to bob on the top half, being mindful about his teeth and using his tongue to swirl and lick as he sucked.
Draco chuckled at Harry's dramatic display. He leaned forward and brushed their lips together in a slow, teasing press and suckle of lips before pulling back.
Composing himself for the serious business of fucking his partner into the mattress, Harry pressed forward, gently but inexorably, until his cock was fully hilted. "That better?" he asked cheekily, giving Draco but a moment to adjust before he pulled back to thrust in again.
Harry was apparating blind. He felt jittery with nervous excitement, but he was also just plain anxious. He'd never so much as

That was a topic that actually did spur his attention. He wondered how Harry was with kids. He even thought about asking after his tiny cousin, the rumored ball of energy that was Teddy Lupin ("rumored" because he really didn't know), but it seemed like too big a leap just yet.
You already gave your Gryffindor word (on paper no less!) to never speak of those things again,
Harry chuckled. "You are quite welcome to take a bath like this every night," he replied, dragging his knuckles down either side of Draco's spine. "You can find me in bed when you're done."
Harry snorted. "I may be bent, but I don't do drag." Bite. Swallow. Smirk. "And it'll be a sunny day in Scotland when you manage to transfigure my clothes without me noticing or taking evasive action."

"Do you know the effect of repeated and sustained Cruciatus on one's nervous system?" Malfoy asked after a minute, startling Harry with the suddenness of the question and the intensity of his storm-grey gaze.

"Too right."
Draco grit his teeth in frustration and turned back to his conversation, sort of. They hardly spoke anyway, so Draco used most of his brain power to conjure another plan up. A slow smirk began to creep along his patrician features as a new, more direct idea immediately presented itself. He excused himself politely between sentences and walked into the crowd again, this time purposely brushing past Harry (crotch to butt) in order to greet a pompous looking man with a large, feathery mask.
Truth be told, I am not bi-curious--I'm gay. I tend to keep it to myself, obviously, and dating is hard. So maybe we should take her advice?
He pushed himself up onto his knees and curled his fingers against Draco's prostate in a 'come hither' gesture, which make Draco toss his head back into the pillows with a deep, delicious groan.
Shaking his head in fond exasperation, he glanced up just in time to see Malfoy turn away, expression dark as a thunder cloud.
Malfoy demurred, though he was obviously pleased. (Harry’d figured early on that compliments were the best way to Malfoy’s heart, but they had to be genuine or they’d backfire; fortunately it worked out that Malfoy had no shortage of praiseworthy material in Harry’s book).
"You should make yourself comfortable," he murmured against Draco's lips, trailing a hand up his side. He kissed him again before vowing, "I intend to do this right."

Draco nodded and stood from the couch, in that slow and lazy way he had adopted over the years. He playfully ruffled the Auror's hair as he passed on his way to the hall and hummed to himself as he exited, acting almost as if he was not only comfortable in the small mansion but
Draco let go of Harry to brace the counter with both hands as he panted his appreciation. His right leg managed to maneuver its way between Harry's legs now that there was space to do. He slipped his leg between them and press his thigh up into the jutting growth.
"Like that, pet?" he breathed as his hand tightened and began to stroke. "Tighter? Faster? How do you want it?"
"I meant Grimmauld," he confirmed with a nod. "Your place is probably still crawling with Law Enforcement. We'll get you in bed and you can sleep as long as you please."
he had company, she was pissed that it was Draco.
Harry groaned with pleasure. "I may or may not have some Slytherin tendencies," he replied, backing Draco against the counter and lifting him up on to it. He mouthed Draco's sharp clavicle and smooth upper pectoral, dragging his teeth over the creamy, unblemished skin (it begged to be marked).
"Who taught you that trick, I wonder?" Potter mused, taking the handshake as permission to touch Draco once again. He lightly scratched between his shoulder blades and up to the crown of his head. Draco went stiff, but not because it felt unpleasant. No, it was almost mind-numbingly good. He held still to keep from debasing himself for more.

The next evening, per Harry's invitation, Draco Flooed from the Manor to Number 12 Grimmauld Place. He stepped out onto the cold stone hearth looking every inch a Pureblood prince. His hair was finally shortened down to a "respectable" length (though belatedly he realized he had actually grown to like it longer and considered re-growing it). He wore a new mink robe and matching ankle boots with buttons climbing up the sides. He ran a hand over his glossed back locks and smirked once he entered the now familiar sitting room.
Now that he thought about it, a lot of the responses Draco stirred up in him were reminiscent of their younger years, making them both familiar and exciting.
What say we have a conversation in person and see how that works out? I will keep my hands to myself if you will.

Draco grinned. Why the woman had been sorted Gryffindor over Ravenclaw remained a mystery, but he trilled twice nonetheless.
"So, what are we waiting for? It's a Saturday, nothing is going on, and I'm bored as hell! Let's go interrogate a bird in the name of Princess D. Oh, and be careful if you go near Gladys. She's mad you're 'cheating' on her."
Oh Em *Squee!* You guys!! Check out PrinnPrick's stinkin' adorable illustration for this fic, newly posted at the end of chapter 6. It's just too cute! XD

The elf sniffed, then promptly shut the door.
It was harder than it should have been with the compelling urge to look up and drink in the sight of the man igniting his synapses. Potter went into the kitchenette and put on a kettle to boil. It was strange how Draco could see everything so clearly in his mind's eye without the use of sight. The only true unknown to him was how Potter was currently dressed.
"Don't ever change," Draco said simply, almost inaudibly, before casually pointing his wand at the door and unlocking it.
"I want you to squeeze yourself. Tight, you hear? And no holding back on any noises! I want to hear you..."
He actually enjoyed time with his goddaughter so it would be a win-win-win if Ron said yes.
Something mischievous and thrilling flashed in Malfoy’s gaze. “Fancy another go, Potter?” he drawled.
His fingers were still, but remained inside, and began to be crushed by Draco's interior muscles tightening with apprehension. He kissed the pad of Draco's thumb where it rested against his lips and turned his face to nuzzle against his palm.
Inside this issue: The Chosen

He scanned the menu and considered doing the same but Hermione's voice in his head told him he needed to eat a balanced dinner. For some dumb reason.
He captured Draco's mouth in another wet, enthusiastic kiss, this one with some bite to it.
"You should be more concerned with the mess we're going to make," he retorted archly before grabbing Harry by his top and pulling him in for another searing, possessive kiss. Thus occupied, he walked Harry backwards toward the large, unkempt bed in the middle off the room. The kiss remained unbroken until Draco shoved Harry onto the blankets and slowly moved to crawl over him.
With that, they fell easily enough into their familiar routine. Harry coached a reluctant Malfoy through some light agility work with the ladder to get his heart rate up and then put him through his paces with a modified strength training routine using the resistance bands and Malfoy’s own body weight. Malfoy, predictably, blustered and whinged the entire time. It was all show, of course. They each had their parts to play in this well-rehearsed performance.
*****
Have I mentioned I find you sexy? Because I do. Even the way you cast is sexual and teasing.
But I'm not going to lie, the idea of you in the water gives me incentive to get over my fear.
To his relief, Draco didn't linger, instead moving the flat of his palm back up Harry's spine and wrapping his other hand around Harry's front to card through the hair on his lower abdomen. His prick strained at the nearness of Draco's hand and he subconsciously widened his stance and canted his hips in silent plea, bracing his hands on the wall as he did so.

"Come on," he prompted, holding out his hand. "Up you get."

Secondly, I'll have you know I'm still in perfect control of my mental faculties. Though for some reason I'm hungry, my head hurts, my other head is hard, and I'm salivating more than usual. I also just read a twenty page essay on the uses of orange peels in potions and now feel like I can quote it. I guess it does work, but the rest of me feels like it's going into over-drive, too. I better get out the library before someone notices my growing problems. Next reply may be delayed since owls have trouble inside the castle sometimes...

And if you prove yourself there, there's a good chance one of our teams would scout you. Your reputation could actually be a blessing in disguise--it would put people in the stands, that's for sure.
Potter frowned flatly at him. "You think that's going to work a second time?" he said, tone dubious.

"I know this isn't easy or comfortable to talk about," he began carefully, hoping to strike the proper balance between concern and professionalism, "but I also know that you wouldn't have told me about the attack in the first place, and you certainly wouldn't have held on to that syringe, if there wasn't at least a part of you that wanted your attacker found."

"Hm. Mainly lack of interest," Draco replied, "and a great expanse of toys. You see, people would either bore me after the first few minutes of snogging or make me angry somehow. Major turn off. I found toys to be all I needed..."
Truthfully, he and Potter had managed to establish a polite, if frosty, rapport for the sake of their positions within the school. With the Gryffindor on the Pitch most days and Draco in the dank bowels of the castle, they really only saw each other at meal times and staff meetings and did a fair job of pretending the other didn't exist when that happened. Their exceedingly rare instances of conversation were mostly limited to grunts and nods anyway, so perhaps his mission wouldn't be as difficult as he feared. After all, Potter had a hero's reputation to uphold...

"I don't actually have to do any of the exercises," he replied, stuffing his hands in his pockets and leaning against the wall. Maybe if he
Draco looked back with a small chocolate in hand to fully gage Potter's reaction, but the man was back in the crowd. Had Draco just fantasized the way he seemed so eager to speak with him as he passed? Potter didn't even look at his legs, and he knew his legs looked great in these! Draco, deciding it was suddenly too hot, removed his short robes, handed them to a servant with a barked order that was mostly threat, and then walked through the crowd as nonchalantly as possible. With arse now on display through his white trousers, a few guests he passed happily oggled--a good sign, Draco walked up to a pair of Unspeakables (he recognized their anti-social behaviors, they were the resident wallflowers) and turned to speak to them with fine backside to the crowd.
"You don't need to go easy on me."
Malfoy was unpredictable. Waspish. Prone to fits of temper and bitter cold that left Harry feeling alternately dumbfounded, irritable, and on edge.
"Godrick," he choked, stumbling into Draco. "Were you intentionally trying to turn my bathroom into a sauna?"
Dear Malfoy,
Hours passed. Not even a house-elf had visited to disrupt the monotony of Harry's failed foray into burglary. He was a good deal past 'frustrated' at this point: not only was he not making any progress on the wards, they seemed to have been increased at some point during his efforts.
"Come on then," he prompted and they made their way down the stairs.
Harry snapped.

It felt strange to be standing in Malfoy Manor in nothing but his socks, pants, and bandages. And it was quickly going to become stranger still, he thought ruefully, as he availed himself of the closer of the two settees to begin unwinding the elastic bandages wrapped securely around his upper thigh.
It was a sleepless night after that leading up to their public date about the wizarding world the next day. His heart wouldn't stop hammering. It took a dose of sleeping drought (half a bottle only) to finally pass out.
Well, suddenly it didn't seem so hopeless, after all.

Potter withdrew his hand. "I'm pretty sure you're giving me bedroom eyes and that is where I draw the line," he announced with a shudder. Draco flipped onto his feet, his laughter sounding like a combination
"If you want to save this for someone who reciprocates your feelings, I understand completely. That might even be me someday," he smiled with a squeeze to Draco's knee. "In the meantime, we can do more of what we've done before."
Of course, he was lying with that one. He recalled the man's face almost as clearly as he knew his own. He remembered the clothes he wore, the oh-so-innocent smile, and the flare of his eyes when he attacked. The man himself was hardly a threat at all (terribly weak and easily subdued, though he hadn't been as scrawny as indicated and should not have been quite

"Three," Draco answered with an amused chuckle at Harry's eagerness. He lifted his hands until his arms hung above his head like before and gripped the pillow cradling his skull. The Slytherin's gaze was half-lidded and intense. He watched the way Harry's own dark, green-ringed eyes looked on, almost enchanted by Draco's sweating body and waiting hole.
"Maybe after dinner," Harry echoed in a husky rumble, seriously considering it.
That is, until he realized his victory meant another interminable wait.
Draco didn't struggle, as expected, but he did gasp as his hands and arms were pulled and forced his back to dip further backward. He turned his gaze to Harry's ministrations, biting his lip and furrowing his brow as the sensitive nub was tended to so thoroughly.
The elf adjusted the knot of his pillowcase-cum-tunic from where it had slipped off one bony shoulder and glowered, the frightful expression incongruous with his tiny stature.

"I'm not easy," he countered. "Just because it took you and 'Mione years to finally shag doesn't mean the rest of us need to operate on that timeline." He dodged the quill Ron threw at him in response and continued, "Malfoy's not the first bloke I've fancied. You know that as well as I do. He's just the first I've been willing to consider actually taking the gamble on."
"I'm on to you, Malfoy," he said jokingly, eyes narrowed and heart still racing. "I've deduced your evil plot: you're trying to shag me to death."
Amidst the chit chat, he requested that two plates of dinner be sent to his rooms when ready, claiming a false headache and a hearty appetite. (Why he took the trouble of lying to the creatures when they would have gladly licked his boots if only he asked, Draco had no idea.) The elves agreed, of course, and soon Potter was on his way to the Defense Against the Dark Arts tower with Draco in tow.

With Draco pressed so snugly against him, Harry could feel quite readily the effect his attentions were having on him.

"That means it
How Malfoy could swing so rapidly from cocky swagger to sweet shyness was mind boggling. The nervous way he fidgeted made Harry want to leap to comfort and reassure, but he was trying to be better about his impulsiveness these days. Was a relationship with a man he'd known as an antagonist when they were boys and who was now little better than a stranger really something he wanted to jump blindly into?
Harry rather agreed. The thing was, he wasn't convinced Malfoy believed his own boast.
"Of course I do," he replied smugly, despite knowing what a wreck he was not even half an hour ago. "And you... Look more than adequate."
Draco jumped as Blaise fell backwards into the wall. The punch had been so loud it echoed slightly in the large entrance hall. The blonde was simmering with rage (it had been a volcanic eruption, until he watched his former "best friend" get so beautifully smacked.) It took a minute after they had apparated to realize they were no longer at the restaurant and instead in front if his own door.

"Well I like chocolate, so I don't have to worry about that," he joked, grateful that Ron took him seriously enough to change tactics. His friend gave him a flat frown in response.

"I'm not just staring," Harry replied with a pointed eyebrow raise in the direction of Draco's crotch. "Besides, I thought you liked my uniform," he quipped.

Malfoy was trying to play it cool. Speaking to Harry as if he wasn't Harry, just some Auror.
"I had nothing to do with his visit. Nothing! I knew he might do something, as you recall me warning you, but I didn't know he would do so as soon as he had. I thought I could talk him out of it first."
He couldn't be entirely sure because almost everything was drowned out by the sound of the water spraying out of the shower head and the blood rushing in his skull. (The absolute filth Draco whispered directly into his ear was a notable exception.)
Draco tugged his trousers down as far as he could reach then pushed them the rest of the way off with his feet. "I concur. Sofa or bed?"
"I'll just keep them all," Draco replied as he flopped across Harry, sending him sprawling back over the table--Draco laying atop him. "And those bites were playful... Markings, yes, but nothing too serious. I doubt they will last more than a day.

Hermione had asked what it was about Draco that attracted Harry enough to overcome their years of negative history and risk of public censure. It wasn't an easy question to answer, but when it came down to it, Draco was fun. He excited Harry and challenged him. Irritated him and made him laugh. Kept him on his toes. Made things interesting.
Draco bucked at the pain and Harry met his pelvis with his own, grinding their erections together and reveling in the spine-tingling sensation of another man's prick. What was happening between them felt nothing like being with a woman--it was hard and sharp and aggressively demanding and, Godrick, he was loving it.
Harry hummed. Focusing on Draco's words was difficult. Answering was harder still.
Draco wasn't sure who moved first, but Potter was horizontal in a flash, stretched out on top of him with his fingers in Draco's hair and his tongue down his throat. Draco, for his part, had one leg wrapped around Potter's thighs while his greedy hands lifted his shirt to get at the blazing skin beneath.
As you know, all the proceeds go directly to the War Orphan's Fund. I personally absorb all the cost of hosting the event so the galleons raised can go directly to the children.

"I'm not annoyed at you," he lied. "I'm figuring this out as I go along. A lot of it is unfamiliar and unintuitive for me." That much was true. He glanced at a plump, red flower hanging from a tree as he thought about how to proceed. He decided to go with an analogy.
Harry was torn between being pissed--he liked that shirt--and even more turned on. He opted for the latter, deciding Draco had just declared open season on his own clothes, whether he liked it or not. His trousers would get a stay of execution (because Harry was a fan), but whatever he had on underneath was fair game.

She was against marriage contracts, against the few boyfriends I've had, and has gone out of her way to make her dislike known. She felt no one would ever be good enough because I am too perfect," Draco chuckled a little self-deprecatingly at that. "She's always been stubborn about it. Never even allowed my own fiance, Pansy, to come over as a child after meeting once because my mother felt she was unworthy and even helped me buy out the engagement contract to get rid of her. So... By saying 'he'll do', she's really saying 'I can't think of anyone better suited'."

He put Draco's hand in the crook of his elbow and apparated them to the shopping district.
He held Draco at arm's length and inspected the damage. It was hard to believe all that had come from a bout with writer's block. "'Mione and Ron are going to be here in an hour," he informed him. "Why don't you go get cleaned up and I'll start in on dinner."
refers to me as a 'one-time Death Eater'?" He drew himself up to his full height, near shaking with fury. "Grow up, Potter. It's long past due."
Draco couldn't contain his yelp of surprise at being lifted suddenly, almost effortlessly, as though he weren't a fully grown man. He did a better job tamping down the fit of giggles that threatened to bubble forth when Potter, in all his naked glory, carried him out of the entryway, like some kind of Neanderthal will his ill-gotten prize.
How can I possibly know your true sincerity if I cannot know who you are (and apparently would be less likely to believe upon knowing it)?
Harry pressed again and Draco arched his back, hands clutching helplessly at the bedclothes as a wonderful breathy whimper escaped his lips. He closed his eyes and relaxed into the pillows, unfurling like a flower. Harry licked his lips and pumped a little faster, a little harder, caught up in the idea of what it would feel like to be buried in that tight, clinging heat. Draco moaned and writhed, tugging at his own hair with one hand and holding his leg up with the other. It was the hottest damn thing he'd had ever seen.
He went to walk out the door, slowing his steps only a little and counting down from 10 in his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
With a barely concealed grimace, he surveyed the piddly bar offerings. There was nothing there to catch his eye... except perhaps the rather fit (if flamboyant) blond lounging against a nearby pillar. If he weren't stone sober and there in an official capacity he might even consider chatting the bloke up.
"Do you like it, Harry?" he murmured as his neck was attacked with wet kisses; it tingled from the contact. "Do you like watching me beneath you?"
And would it be so impulsive, really? After all, we both admitted to wanting the other for years (on and off on your end it seems, rather consistently on mine). We also both admitted to having high expectations of the other and wanting to be careful about how we approach things (you more so than I, for certain).
When he couldn't possibly eat another bite, he moved away from the carnage on his half-empty plate to groom himself meticulously. Only once he was clean did he check on Potter, still eating quietly behind him.
Potter snickered. "What, like a tiger?" he asked incredulously.
Needless to say, he received a few glances--both sneering and leering. His father told him not to wear white to a wedding, even though that rule was generally in the case of the women, so of course white was his theme for the night.

Dear Readers,
Malfoy looked up, making Harry swallow reflexively.
Draco laughed at the crude description and happily took the offered tray. He moved to sit back against a few propped pillows settled against the headboard and dug right in (meaning he was enjoying his bacon with relish, sucking on an end for the juice before crunching the well cooked meat between his perfect teeth. It was kind of touching that Harry already knew Draco liked his bacon nearly burned--extra crispy.)
Draco nodded again, swallowing his pride to admit it and wondering in the back of his mind why Potter had retired so young from the Auror corps--he was a surprisingly good detective.

Sincerely yours,
case, he'd jumped to an awful conclusion based entirely on the way Malfoy had treated him a decade ago, with no thought given to how Malfoy had been since then.

If a shag was all I wanted, I wouldn't have reason to be "pouty" (as you so eloquently termed my melancholy), now would I? You and I both know I have little difficulty securing high caliber company for an evening. Pining uselessly after the Saviour of the Wizarding World is another matter entirely.
"Yes," Draco hissed through gritted teeth. He kept his usual cool commentary to himself, lest he piss the girl off and have the connection closed in his face. "Which is why he's been careful with me."
Both arms had been forced around Harry's neck and he instinctively curved himself into the Auror to center his weight. In the mean time, and it was possibly quite a dumb move (especially considering his most recent request), Draco leaned in close to breathe gently on Harry's ear while nipping and licking the shell.

And a little boy crying in a cupboard.
Ron left with a parting wave and Harry returned to his arrest report, putting quill to parchment.
I heard some distinctly festive sounds coming out of your department when I strolled by yesterday. It made me happy. Here is a portable CD player of your own so you can listen wherever and whenever you want.
What kind of rare books? How many stacks are we talking here?
With Draco's cock now easily accessible, Harry circled his tongue around the pucker once more as his hands shifted from Draco's hips--at this angle he didn't mind if the man bucked on him while he played. One hand went to firmly grip Draco's cock and squeeze while the other he used to quickly conjure lube before joining the first. He drove his tongue inside Draco, thrusting it to its limit and wanking firmly as he did.

"Harry! This was sooner than expected... Miss me that much?" he teased as he held the door open in silent invitation.
It was intoxicating.
To achieve that end he must answer Potter's question. He chuffed thrice. He hadn't

It’s Christmas in July! In honor of this totally made up holiday, please enjoy this semi annual update 😅 If you are just reading this story for the first time, I’m sorry. If you have been following it for a while, I am sorrier still! You all have the patience of saints. As a check in, I fully intend to finish this fic but it should be obvious by now I have no idea when. The end is written and so are a few key scenes along the way, but I honestly don’t know what I want to do with the middle. So with that in mind, what are you hoping to see? I am open to ideas 😁 I probably won’t be able to incorporate them all, but I’m sure I will find all of them inspiring! As always, thank you for reading!
Harry was the Head Auror. He'd just gotten out of a long term relationship that had ended badly (to put it mildly). Not only was Draco a co-worker, but he was practically a stranger--they hadn't had a real conversation in more than a decade. They were in public. It could be a trap. Worse, Draco could be under the influence of a mind altering substance!
******
Luckily for me I only have paperwork today. My cock is practically throbbing it's so hard after that last letter. I'm afraid I still have at least an hour before I can skive off... Ron isn't working today or else I wouldn't be able to palm my hardened prick through these damn trousers. I'm squeezing tight thinking of you prepping yourself, slipping your fingers into that lovely chute. I'm going to fuck you so hard when I get home.
"I didn't know you could cook," he proclaimed, a hint of surprise in his tone.
It would have to be just 'Potter,' then. Like always.
I almost took this letter as sincere until you began to spout that nonsense about fancying me to distraction. I know that despite all that has happened, my looks have not diminished, but I also find it highly unlikely that anyone would see me as "attractive" anymore. One's ugly actions are more visible than one's appearance, and mine were particularly gruesome. So please leave me be. Insofar as I am able, I am not bothering anyone here.
On the other hand, he appreciated Draco taking the initiative since it reflected his level of investment. And the idea of dinner

He grinned and squeezed Harry's hands, rubbing his thumb against the bones of his wrist with no more pressure than a butterfly's touch.

A feelings talk. Draco wasn't expecting that, but he was pleasantly surprised.
--to make a dinner reservation without first checking with him. It so happened that he was free and interested in seeing the man again, but still.
Yours Forvever and Ever,
Dear Malfoy,
you have no idea how badly I need this."

"Third door on the right," he answered, indicating the hallway with a careless toss of his head. He stared a second too long at Malfoy's sockless feet and wondered if he'd ever found bare feet sexy before that moment. Those feet--long, narrow, pale, and with a very high arch--were unusually captivating.
Draco kept his left hand behind him for balance as his right teased the head of Harry's cock just under the hood.
"How many orgasms were you hoping to have today, then?" he asked, genuinely curious though he playfully waggled his brows.
Harry frowned. That didn't exactly sound like a rousing endorsement to him. He was miffed--Narcissa, of all people, should think more highly of him than, 'he'll do.' He'd kept the woman out of Azkaban, for Godrick's sake. But Draco seemed pleased (for some odd reason) so he bit his tongue.
He closed his eyes and feigned sleep.
"Or if you'd rather pull yourself off I wouldn't be one to argue..."
Draco tilted his head for better access as his eyes drooped until they were half-lid and staring down toward his cock where Harry continued to stroke and squeeze. His hands first grasped Harry's knees before sliding slowly up toward his thighs, past his hips, and gripped both the Auror's firm ass cheeks--holding them in a firm grip as he bucked first toward the hand that sought to bring him release and then back toward the flaccid cock teasing his cleft. Draco's back arched into the hand at his chest.
"I guess we both like it rough," Draco breathed a laugh at Harry's sudden, almost adorable eagerness.
*****
Hermione faltered. "Well, no," she admitted, "but--"
"I 'ate to tell ya, but those files are private. Ya'd need permission from the recipients or from the Malfoys themselves to get access. They're bank records, ya see."
"Who's easy now, Malfoy?" he taunted, leaning down to nip at Draco's pouty bottom lip.
"Grab a seat," he prompted, gesturing to the visitors' couch along one wall of the sparsely furnished office. He then opened the same drawer that formerly housed his calming draught and produced a silver flask--his best man gift from Ron. "I'd offer you some," he apologized, unscrewing the cap, "but you aren't supposed to mix potions and alcohol."

), the people he was with (Zabini and Parkinson), the hitch in his voice when he said 'misjudged,' the fact he'd saved the syringe with a mind for evidence but had never bothered reporting the incident--nothing was beneath his attention or care.
******
Potter was leaning against the brewing table, a casual hand on one hip and laugher in his eyes. "Mornin', sunshine," he drawled.
Hermione had cornered Harry two weeks ago over the fact she'd given him 'two whole weeks' to come to her about Draco and he still hadn't done so. She wasn't pleased, which had less to do with the fact he was dating Draco than that he hadn't had the good grace to tell his best friend about it. She wasn't thrilled to pieces, mind, but she was cautiously supportive and had taken an active interest in their dating life, which she deemed romantically insufficient thus far. Hence the fancy date.
Draco Malfoy, the bane of his adolescent existence (well, top 5, anyway), who'd just willingly and eagerly gone down on his knees to suck Harry off and now Harry was gladly working up a sweat to toss him off in return.
Patient folder secured a minute later, Harry seated himself at the desk to jot a few quick notes and check his schedule for the remainder of the day.
.....
"Draco," he said carefully, remaining where he stood, "I need you to promise me two things." His eyes bored into Draco's wide grey ones and he entreated, voice heavy with emotion, "Promise you won't use Occlumency to hide your feelings from me. And that you will never, ever do something against your will in an effort to appease me or keep me happy."
He found Harry at the table with a fresh cup of tea.
"Are you asking me to move in with you?" he croaked.
Harry
He leaned forward and licked along the crack of Draco's arse. His tongue dipped into the skin just above Draco's testicles first, then dragged upward to his ring, where he circled the pink, puckered skin. He lapped at Draco's entrance before pressing his mouth against the hole and sucking gently, pushing the tip of his tongue inside.
Malfoy wore his hair swept to the side, longish fringe hanging over one eye. Harry thought it had been done in an effort to obscure the asymmetry now present in what had once been Malfoy's arguably perfect Pureblood visage. The result of a mild-to-moderate deterioration in his craniofacial musculature, it was especially noticeable to someone who'd spent as much time looking at Malfoy as him. (Back when the Slytherin had been getting up to all that suspicious business in sixth year, of course; not for any other reasons.)
Squatting to remove the set of Velcro straps from Malfoy’s trainers, he couldn’t help but notice how much he’d missed the man’s proximity. He’d felt its lack like a physical ache (a feeling with which he was overly acquainted as it was). If he was honest, he’d always been drawn to Malfoy—he’d just channeled it into paranoia and enmity in school. But now, having very nearly chased him away for good, Harry found himself wanting to wrap his arms around Malfoy’s legs and not let go. And
Malfoy hummed with a skeptical squint but let the matter drop. His eyes seemed to linger on Harry's trousers, however. What was wrong with them? They weren't wrinkled--Harry'd ironed them. A quick visual inspection revealed that they didn't appear to be harbouring any renegade stains either. In fact, he couldn't determine a single possible cause for Malfoy's critical look, and yet...
Harry spluttered, becoming increasingly indignant. “In the context of therapy! Godric, Malfoy. You don’t go around asking doctors to drop their trousers just because they occasionally make you wear those awful gowns with your arse hanging out!”
"I will be at the chocolatier next door when you're finished," he called to Harry over his shoulder. "I need sustenance from a place that isn't trying to kill me."
Ugh, I can't even sleep, I itch so much. This is worse than chicken pox!
I have no idea what you would want from me, though. Except maybe to clean the flat the way you'd like it done. Other than that, you've already got everything money can buy. I can't make your probation any shorter (I tried).
Harry flashed Draco a grateful smile. He was trying, unlike some people in the room (Ron).
What it was he had thought to add disappeared as his eyes went wide until they were as round as saucers. He had been shuffling in place as his agitation vibrated down from his brain to his limbs in an unconscious self-soothing attempt, but all went still when something began to crawl into his trouser leg and wrap tight around his ankle up to his calf.
He pushed past Harry, none too gently.
"Aurors should be here any minute," he announced to Draco after triple checking the security of the bonds and stripping Parkinson and her men of their wands. Despite his calm, almost clinical tone, his heart hammered in his chest and blood rushed in his ears. "You okay?" he asked with genuine concern.
******
easy, mind you--Malfoy often looked like he was sucking lemons after letting one slip--but it happened more and more often as he gained confidence with the exercises Harry put him through.) The likelihood of a gibe also increased in direct proportion to how hard Harry pushed him.
Goyle's trial, at least, had been straightforward and quick. With his detailed confession and lack of defense, there was no contesting his sentence of six months in Azkaban followed by a lengthy probation and court-ordered Mind Healing.
"Are you going to just stare or you going to get naked?"
"Let's talk about that later," Harry hedged, glancing significantly at their audience. Draco nodded but his smirk told Harry the conversation was far from over.
Forgive me if I am not terribly moved by the woeful plight of the Golden Boy. That said, if you haven't solved your own problem by then, I could be persuaded to lend a hand (in a manner of speaking) when I return Friday.

Draco Malfoy stood just on the other side of the room with a cool drink in hand. He wore a white and silver half-mask that climbed down his pointed nose with matching suit (white with silver trimming and subtle stripes) that caused his already pale features to become nearly ghost-like under short robes. His hair, usually stroked back with fragrant gel, had been tossed to the side and swept forward into his face and over his right ear.
Harry started. Talking with Malfoy was like riding a broom through a gale given the speed with which he changed direction and the rapid cycling of his moods, and now he was peering directly into Harry's eyes and the silver of his own was striking. (They happened to be as bright as Harry remembered, but not as mean.) The whole exchange was disorienting and left him feeling out-of-balance.
then I am something you have to deal with," Lucius half-hissed the last of his words, but for the most part remained calm, casual--even professionally passive. "Now do you have feelings for my son or do you plan to toss him aside at some interval? The boy, as... impossible as it is... Has been in love with you nearly all his life. His mother informed me of his crush since the day you two met.
Increasing the tempo of his pumping and alternating between gentle circles and rough tugs on Draco's pebbled nipple, he sunk his teeth into Draco's trapezius for a branding lovebite.
******
I have longer hair now. Can't get a barber to come by that I trust. Just so you won't be surprised.
Draco leaned his head forward as Harry kissed his shoulder to nip at his ear and along his neck behind his squared jaw. His hands slipped into the back pockets of today's trousers and squeezed against the pert ass he found there before pulling Harry forward into his hips to press their clothed (one apron-ed) cocks together.
If only it were that easy.
"I was tryna help," Teddy offered meekly.
"Luckily for you, I think your guest has arrived. But as soon as we're alone again..."
"You can heal this one," he tapped the faint red lovebite from the park, "but I want this one," he dropped his mouth and sucked on the new mark, making Draco hiss, "to stay."

Nevertheless, she blew him a kiss and sauntered to the weight bench, chestnut brown ponytail bobbing behind her. After selecting the lightest set of dumbbells, she caught Harry's eyes in the mirror and gave him a saucy wink. He snorted. George Weasley in a sports bra, she was.
******
," he warned. That was the last thing he needed. The fact Draco had made it that long without writing an article about him was part of the reason they were still together to talk about it. (Fortunately, he was almost as protective of Harry's privacy as Harry himself, guarding it jealously and ensuring that his less-reputable coworkers--Rita Skeeter--no longer harassed Harry with the regularity they once had.)
I'm on my way, my Noble Knight.
The rules are simple: each department will receive a visit from a hat with the names of all unmatched Ministry workers inside. Whatever name you pick is the employee you must give (legal, non-threatening, prankless, well-intentioned) gifts to--one a day until our Christmas party, when you may reveal yourself and exchange the final gift! Until then each gift must be sent anonymously by inter-office owls. Whether you choose to give the last one in person or not is up to you, but no sneak peeks before then!
“All right, Potter,” was his eventual reply, (more breath than tone, at that).
"Shh," Harry soothed, working his finger slowly in and out as Draco began to relax the vise-like tension in his body. "We don't need to rush." He bent forward and kissed the inside of Draco's knee. "You can change your mind at any point," he murmured, gently stroking the bundle of nerves inside him. "For now, just focus on the feeling."
Ron and Hermione haven't set a date yet. They're both too busy right now--Ron's finishing up his Auror training and 'Mione is preparing to sit for her exams while interning with the Wizengamot. I'm happy for them. They're my best friends, you know. And their wedding has felt...I don't know,

*****
If he had been merciless before in stomping out the thrill he felt at Malfoy's compliment, he was downright savage to his eagerly responsive libido just then.
Can we agree to stop using the word "pining"? It sounds so pathetic. And is no longer relevant, I hope.
He wrapped his free hand around Draco's shin (up by his ear) and pumped his fingers in and out of the scorching, spasming chute, completely consumed by the utter necessity of giving Draco exactly what he needed.
******
Harry frowned. What Draco made light of sounded an awful lot like attempted sexual assault to him.
P.S. I wasn't kidding about not wanting foreign fluids on my desk, though. Absolutely no play anywhere on my side of the office.
Harry went to the window, the concerned expressions he'd received a moment ago too much to bear. He focused instead on purple patches of heather amidst an unkempt green lawn, dotted here and there with the artefacts of Arthur's obsession: a rusty lawnmower, a tipped-over watering can, a motor of some sort. The sun was just beginning to go down in the western sky. Its heat radiated through the smudged glass, warming his face.
"So... Wednesday. I assume you don't mean tomorrow but next week, yes? I suppose that would be an appropriate time. Maybe I'll wear that pair of leather trousers you like so much?"
"Fine," he answered gruffly. "When do we begin?"
"Hey, speaking of which," he said brightly, giving Ron raised brows and a toothy smile. "Would you be a mate and go down to the records room for me? I need the names of every Wizarding family that applied for reparations from the Malfoy fund and I've already had to see Gladys twice today." His lip curled involuntarily at the memory of her wholly inappropriate plunging neckline (and wrinkly cleavage). "Pretty, pretty please?"
Draco did as asked. As soon as Harry's fingers grazed his scalp, his grey-black eyes fell heavily shut on a deep, sexy groan. Harry smirked. (If he were being rewarded for good behavior, a simple blow job would be more than enough; he'd probably feel too awkward to enjoy it if Draco tried something like this on him.)
Teddy made a weak sound of protest. "I was just arranging it on the counter," he claimed, scuffing the toe of his shoe against the floor.
I'll be right over with fuzzy handcuffs and a camera.

Harry
Simultaneously grieving the loss of physical contact and sighing inwardly with relief, he righted his glasses and stretched the worst of the kinks out. (His unhelpful brain suggested a bed was a preferable location for cuddling and they should most definitely try that next time.) Malfoy’s hair was the disaster for once, especially the side that was both crushed flat and sticking in odd directions from where he’d been laying and Harry found it more than a little endearing.
"Not if the DMLE didn't want the public to know," Potter replied enigmatically, eyes sparkling.
Warmly,
to look its best, himself especially.
Except...
How many times have we gone over the protocol for avoiding contagions? Seven, at least. And yet you charged into danger without so much as a shield charm in place! You are lucky a serious cold is the worst of it, you thickheaded imbecile.

Whether or not it was, Draco slowly slid himself upwards from Harry's thighs until he was sitting firmly on his lubed cock. He ground down for a moment, both cheeks open and cradling the Gryffindor's heavy member.
12 Grimmauld Place
Draco gave an indignant snort but didn't move out from under from Potter's touch. It was comforting. As was his cheek, in a way.
Draco was rudely awakened from his dozing by a soggy bar rag. He sprung several inches off the desk, damp fur sticking in every direction, spitting bloody murder and whipping his head around to locate the soon-to-be-dead Gryffindor who was responsible.
Draco wrenched the door open, dragged Harry inside, and slammed his door--hard--before locking it back up.

"I look forward to your vengeance, pet. Or should I call you 'darling'? Should we involve pet names...?" Draco shook his head and turned to Harry with a spoonful of cake and syrup. "Want a little?"

Potter,
We are in the home stretch now!! At my current estimate, that means we have maybe ten more chapters (most likely
Prinn
"Nn, fuck... Touch me, Harry..."
He carefully slid from the bed and to the floor where some of his old laundry was. Dirty or not, he pulled on a pair of trousers and tied the laces in the front as quietly as possible.
"Did you ever stop to think that maybe it wasn't you they were looking for? Or are you too self-centred for the thought even to have occurred to you?"
He released Malfoy's hair so he could grip the hand kneading his thigh and move it to his arse instead.
"Does this mean you'll volunteer to do the main dish when Ron and Hermione are over next week?" he inquired, entirely tongue-in-cheek, as he popped the cap off the bottle. "Ron wants steak."
Draco huffed a laugh as he turned to look at Harry again. The man was rumpled and sweaty once more, but looked so casual, even as he sported a throbbing erection between his thick, hairy thighs. Draco lifted a hand and pushed it into Harry's chest, splaying his fingers across a firm, equally hairy pectoral.
For a moment Harry wondered if perhaps he really was as delirious as Draco claimed when he first saw his partner in that ridiculous get up. But, no, the compulsively fastidious wanker seemed to think he truly was on death's door.
I know you have Most Potente Potions already, but I'm pretty sure you don't own an original advance copy with Arsenius Jigger's handwritten notes inside. (Those are quite hard to come by.)
Taking the proffered kitchen tool, he went to work stirring with a sigh.
Potter opened the door and Draco scampered ahead to his workstation, noting the signs of chaos he'd missed earlier. (He had been too busy turning into a ruddy domesticated weasel to take proper stock.) Purple-black potion coated everything in a five-foot blast radius, his coat rack was overturned, several items on the prep table were knocked sideways, and a few littered the floor along with his discarded pile of clothes.
No one, not a single muggle, was out in the park where they settled so for the moment Draco felt safe about taking out his own pale wand and twirling it between his fingers. He moved to take his usual place on Harry's lap, electrified by the fire in Harry's brilliant green eyes.
If you didn't expect me to reciprocate, why tell me? I thought that perhaps I had been more obvious than I initially thought, which prompted the confession. Were you hoping to scare me away?
Draco was handling the news better than Harry expected.
It was a herculean task to gather his thoughts--putting to rest all notions of jumping anyone or fixating on absurdly pretty feet--but Harry managed. His notepad helped considerably.
"I'm sure you asked him to show you
Malfoy's cold expression went calculating. "
The chips weren't spicy. Not even a little. They had a dash of pepper, sure, but that hardly constituted
"Take a moment to think about the next words out of your mouth," he warned. "You have a dangerously Gryffindor-y glint to your eyes and I don't want you saying anything you'll regret in the morning."
He started not by bathing the Auror, but by kissing him: his neck, shoulders, and ears. Slowly. Teasingly. After he was certain Harry might snap (if his shaking form and heavy breathing were any indication), he lathered his hands and began to wash Harry's back--slipping his fingers in a soapy caress between his arsecheeks to see what kind of rise it would elicit.
Did Malfoy even know he’d called him by his first name? It wasn’t unusual for him to refer to Harry as ‘Henry’ at the Centre but this was different. Was it an accident? Would he do it again? How was he—
It was true that the ankle-length trench and wide-brimmed fedora hid Burnbridge's identity rather effectively, but the fact it was a balmy summer afternoon and the bleeding idiot was using a copy of the Daily Prophet (complete with moving photographs) to shield himself from the unforgiving sun was something of a giveaway.
Harry crossed his arms, smirking. "Do you mean to tell me you didn't research Mr. Collins ahead of time?"
Prat.
"You just want me talking more because you get off on it," he replied accusingly, eyes narrowed in mock suspicion. "I'm on to you."
"Ok," Teddy shrugged, apparently satisfied with the answer. "Now hurry up and eat so we can have cake! And do
Your mother has informed me that you are refusing the potion from St. Mungo's because you believe it to be poison.
"See something you like?" Harry asked cockily.
At any rate, that dare was a great deal easier than the one that followed it: letting Pansy have her wicked way with me for two minutes. Damn harpy left scratch marks. And now Nott is giving me the eye.
Draco grasped Harry's wrist and leaned down in order to kiss each abused knuckle gently. His free hand grasped his wand and pulled it free from its holster.
Draco hummed contentedly at the feeling of Potter's erection through the wispy fabric of the dress. "On. Definitely," he replied without hesitation. Whether there was to be a repeat performance or not, he was going to make the most of their evening together. It was not every day one had the opportunity to go down on the Saviour of the Wizarding World beneath his skirts...which was exactly what Draco was about to do.
Anyway, I just wanted you to know that not everyone at Hogwarts is out to get you. And maybe, hopefully chase that frown away, if only for a moment.

"The only people who can answer that for sure are Parkinson and Zabini," he replied philosophically when Draco trailed off, "but it seems like they both had their arses chapped when you declined to give them what they wanted. No offense, but entitlement runs high in Slytherin house. You've grown out of that. They haven't."

Draco smirked and Harry's thoughts scattered when he added a clever twist to his strokes. He was able to gather them with a bit of effort. Focusing on talking was helping to keep  his orgasm at bay.
*****
As for whether or not I want you, you have no idea how much I've longed to just be open about it and act, but that is beside the point. I refuse to be the cause of your misery--I have done quite enough of that already.
******
When he was finally ready to head downstairs, his hair was shiny and fluffed and his skin shimmered lightly with moisturizer. He wore the clothes Harry had left for him, though he did so with a frown.
Draco huffed and ate what was on his fork, purposely licking from stem to prongs with only the tip of his tongue, a sultry smile, and his eyes boring into Harry's with invitation. He slid the head between his lips once more before setting to work on the second dessert before he grew too full. Usually he would never be able to stomach so much, but he knew he'd need his energy for Harry's "revenge".
******
"Down the stairs?" Harry ventured.
"They're fine," he answered (without actually answering), tucking Draco's head into the crook of his neck and wrapping both arms around him tightly. He didn't know if the true nature of the spell would distress him further, given that Draco apparently couldn't let go of his feelings for a woman who hadn't truly been his friend for several years. The spell was better than they deserved, better than whatever they had planned for him.
While he liked the woman, Janine was a shameless flirt who spent far more time sticking her freckled nose into other people's business than focussing on her own healing.
"Shit, Draco. I'm so sorry!"
Later, when I began to suspect that you might have drawn me as well, I grew suspicious that something beyond luck may have been involved. The odds of that happening on its own are quite poor, you know, so I did a bit of digging. (I am an Auror, after all.)
It wasn't the most spectacular invitation to stay, but it was sincere.
Harry snorted. "Maybe don't try to give Ron a coronary at our first dinner together, yeah? Save it for the second one, at least."
Malfoy's head whipped up, shock writ clear on his expressive features. Sooner or later he was going to have to accept that Harry wasn't just masquerading as a therapist--he actually was good at his job.
Enjoy this treacle tart. Or not. I suppose I cannot force you to enjoy anything I send, but I have heard you moan like a high-priced rent boy trying to make a client feel extra special when they serve these in the canteen so it seemed like a promising option.
Two more days if I am lucky. I can't actually tell if I am getting any better, but apparently that's normal.

"I hope that's not the only reason you requested me as a partner," he said teasingly, getting into position all the same. His mouth watered at the sight of Potter's thick, swollen prick. A pearly drop of precome gathered at the slit and he leaned forward to lap it up.
He ran a hand through his hair to collect himself and left the other on Draco's foot (lest he start grinding on Harry's overly sensitive prick).
, he chided himself. One sort-of-date and a bit of fooling around were not the same thing as having someone move in. Even if someday (in the far distant future) the idea arose, he'd have to be sure he could put up with Draco's eccentricities. The man did not seem easy to live with. But he
He laughed heartily.
"I know it's my own fault, mind," his smirk returned. "Terribly sexy and all that. But I also admit it's hard to behave around you..."

"Mmm, you're so hard," he moaned, playing it up for effect, tightening and relaxing his fist on Draco's prick. "I bet you want to come. Do you, Draco?"

The woman ahead of them was herding the family to the door and caught Draco's eye as she passed. He offered a smile. She gasped when recognition dawned and gathered her brood around her like a protective hen. Her husband turned quickly at the sound and scowled pure menace at Draco, who had done literally nothing wrong. Anger rising, Harry stepped between them and forced the man's gaze to him. Surprise and then revulsion joined the hatred in his muddy brown eyes. He spat on the ground at their feet and stormed outside.
Draco pulled Harry forward into a hard kiss.
He was wearing an interesting combination of muggle and wizard attire: Nike trainers and his favourite Under Armour top with a pair of what looked to be black riding breeches, if Harry wasn’t mistaken. His hair was knotted in the back, the shorter strands already falling out to frame his face. Harry’s mouth practically watered at the sight. Thank Godric for the pretense of the session to give him something to do besides gape like he’d been Obliviated one too many times.
"Will you be kicking me out when you go to work or do you trust me to stay and sleep?"
“I’m sure you’d just love having all sorts of people bow down to you,” he retorted weakly, tossing the newly detached resistance bands behind him in the general direction of his bag.
The syringe had been the detail he hadn't been able to shake. It was just so odd. Few wizards would even know what one was to look at it, let alone consider using it as a weapon. And it didn't seem to be the sort of thing a pureblood like Malfoy would have had any exposure to. He'd considered the possibility Malfoy was lying, of course, but on the off-chance that he wasn't, he decided to follow his intuition and put his wondering to rest with this visit. That Malfoy had the thing in his possession was an unanticipated boon.
"Fun as this is," Draco interrupted, pushing his way out from behind Harry, "I think I shall leave you to it."
"Of course I know it's you, prat." Potter rolled his eyes. "I knew straight away. You're a rather distinctive ferret."
"Good," he replied with a half-smile and a nod, stepping back a pace to give Malfoy room to breathe. "I'm going to hold you to that. And it's
Dear Potter,
I know you regret the things you did. Even if the Prophet hadn't printed your statement to the Wizengamot at your trial, I can see it in your face and the way you interact with people. I watched you stop that group of snotty Slytherin fifth years from hassling that Hufflepuff third year just the other day. That was the thing that really got me thinking.
"You're... Either more experienced than I thought... Or... Or you're very adept at experimenting."
"I'm paying you back for this," he warned, peering at Draco (who was contentedly digging into the cheesecake without a care in the world) out one slitted eye. "With interest."
He let the trio suffer a few seconds longer than was perfectly ethical, then put the lot of them out of their misery with a tight succession of stunners, trading the rune's ropes for conventional ones while the would-be assailants sprawled unconscious on Draco's bedroom floor.
The statement was quiet. Sincere. But spoken with a wry twist at the corner of Malfoy’s mouth and something like humour in his fathomless grey eyes.
Merlin, he needed a minute to catch his breath. He didn't want Draco to know that that had almost been too much for him in his weakened state.
Which was, Harry'd learned, exactly why he had taken the job. He believed he could affect more positive change in the private sector than within the Ministry itself, and he seemed to be right. There had been a massive round of firings after his latest hard-hitting article and the Ministry was a better place for it...in Harry's unpopular opinion, at any rate. It turns out many folks don't like the boat to be rocked. As far as he was concerned, Draco should sink the whole bloody thing. A complete overhaul would do the country good.
Draco smiled to himself as he decided it suited the hero rather well to have such an...eclectic arrangement of furniture.
"Lube," he ordered, shifting his arse to the edge of the desk for easy access. His years of wank fantasies of the man were foreplay enough.
******
It was with gusto that he secured the warrant for Zabini's arrest and had him brought in.
"You're absolutely right," he replied, not trying to defend his behaviour. It was inexcusable.
Draco maintained eye contact with Harry the whole time he worked himself down his shaft and, Godrick, that alone was almost his undoing.
Your education in Slytherin seduction continues this evening! We'll make a proper pervert of you yet.
Draco held tight to Potter's hips and ground his cock against the Auror's ass with a growl of approval.
He gave Draco's foot a squeeze and deposited it on the ground so he could check on the soufflés--his wand was vibrating in his pocket to alert him to the time.
Waiting for you,
?" Draco queried, arching his brow skeptically.
"I'd rather wait," he asserted, finally gaining a semblance of control over his sudden bout of nerves.
It would soon become apparent he wasn't wearing anything underneath.
He was glad Harry didn't question the sudden change of subject (again). Perhaps he was getting used to how sharply Draco's mind turned? It would have made sense if he were a Legilimens, but luckily for Draco Harry could barely handle Occlumency...as far as he knew, anyway.
Draco's foot fell to the ground and he blinked at his dinner companion in surprise, his fork half-way to his mouth when be paused. He started momentarily at the confession... And then shrugged.
The four returned to room-temperature dinners. Thank Merlin for warming charms.
"Well? How do I look?"
Draco didn't seem to be of a mind to take things slowly that evening--not with the way he gripped Harry closer and urged him on--but he'd said he wanted their relationship to be based on something other than sex. And Harry hadn't even rightly said 'hullo.'
*****
Malfoy went tense and turned away. Harry wasn't sure what kind of reaction he had expected, but that wasn't it. It had been a simple(ish) question and he'd answered honestly, so why was Malfoy so distressed by the response?
"That you hit the jackpot in the boyfriend department," was Draco's arch retort. It was delivered with his trademark smirk--the one that always got Harry all hot and bothered--a moment before he fell on him for a furious open-mouthed snog.

Draco nearly howled at the idea of having to get up at such an ungodly hour... Until the last option. He considered it, shrugging eventually.
That wouldn't do.
Harry grinned as he followed Draco to the desk. Instead of leaning forward and draping himself over his partner like before, he dropped carefully to his knees between Draco's legs and moved to grip and spread his arse cheeks.
"Suit yourself," she shrugged, snickering, but Harry could see the wheels turning as she looked between him and Malfoy. Could be trouble: Janine had a decidedly

"First things first," he purred. "Preparation is key."

Draco was lulled to sleep with long, steady strokes and the whisper of breath above him.
******
And that fact alone was enough to ratchet up his anxiety to palm-sweat-inducing levels. Never mind what thinking too hard about the kinds of diabolical torments Malfoy might dream up for payback did to his nerves.
"You don't look half bad in full uniform, Potter. Nice boots," he nodded to the dragonhide on the Auror's feet that reached half-way up his calves.
"It's part of you and you are worth more than just some thing," Harry replied earnestly, squeezing Draco's shoulders. "Anyone who tells you otherwise doesn't deserve one iota of your time or energy. Take that from someone who's dealt with a lifetime of being treated like a commodity. I refuse to do that to someone else and I won't have you acting as if I would. Can you make those promises?"
"That should do it," he murmured to himself as the owl finished stuffing its beak. He blew gently on the ink to ensure it was dry before rolling the parchment and tying it back around the owl's leg. The arched window was securely locked after the bird's departure.
Nothing, hopefully...
"Yes, fine. I get it."
hope it happened
Draco held out a hand when asked and quickly made work of the door, pushing it open. His arm returned to its place around Harry neck as his eyes roamed about the room. It was far more impressive than Draco would have guessed, despite the place being an ancestral home (after all, the man had mismatched furniture in his sitting room and apparently no matching silverware either.)
Draco turned to Harry, seething.
Dear Potter,
*****
Draco immediately stopped rocking, heaving a regretful sigh. He stared hard at Harry.
So he stopped saying it altogether until such a time as he figured out what love was like in a romantic context. He loved his family, that was certain. But that love didn't have the complication of sexual attraction.
It had taken the better part of the day, but they were able to track down the culprit--the victim's own brother, who'd developed a nasty (and expensive) potions habit and was desperate enough for his next fix to risk his brother's life to get it. It was depressing.
Feeling equal parts victorious and relieved, Harry sat on a rolling stool across from him, resting on his thighs the pale blue new patient folder he carried. 'M. Billingsley' read the neat black type on the label--meaning Harry wasn't the only one using a false name there. For the sake of their tenuous truce, he refrained from comment.
"Says the man who orders everything with butter or cream sauce and thinks chocolate is a food group," Harry scoffed, grinning. He took another bite of his cheeseburger before answering Draco's question. "You avoided the pickles when I brought you a ploughman's the other day. I figured it was a general disdain."
It was a small comfort that Burnbridge, at least, had made himself scarce, but guilt clawed at Harry unrelentingly.
Pansy, being a dear friend--and more than a little infatuated with me--was willing to assist me in maintaining the ruse as long as I wished.
It might just be the illness talking, and I'm pretty sure you were being your usual sarcastic self, but I am definitely not opposed to the idea of fucking you into a desk. Mine will do. I'm not picky.
If you
"Is this good for you, Harry? Do you want more? Faster? Harder still?"
He watched the tawny owl glide through the window and idly wondered if Malfoy would still be in his pyjamas when it arrived. He then gave himself a mental shake. He had no business thinking about Malfoy in his pyjamas...even if the penguins sliding on their bellies and having tiny snowball fights were kind of cute. And Malfoy without a shirt was--
"Yes," Harry answered enthusiastically, deliberately obtuse. "All of the above."
Malfoy gave a single, sharp nod.
Harry rose quickly to follow. Draco had turned his innocent (mostly innocent) suggestion into a game and his heart kicked up a pace in response, the way it used to before Quidditch.
"Then no more godchildren for you to spoil. Remember that!" Ron "warned" right back as they entered the kitchen. While they were gone, Hermione had made herself comfortable beside Draco, who seemed extra fidgetty from the unwanted additional attention.
Speaking of, there was their meal, waiting innocently at the table as it came into view. Draco eyed it with disdain as if it were poisoned... And it very well might be.
Draco groaned with appreciation as his head was licked and then swallowed. It didn't matter that Harry couldn't take all of him, his cock still twitched and his heart still thrummed. He was already painfully hard by the time Harry had decided to reciprocate--he wouldn't last long...
*****
"All right. I'm going to need both hands," Potter announced, gingerly placing Draco on the ground.
Draco kicked his trousers off after they were pulled down. He had no socks or shoes on, which made the undressing process much easier. He widened his legs just before his entrance was penetrated by one of his lover's rough fingers.
bed, but neither one of us is going anywhere," he asserted presumptuously. "Secondly, forgive me, but you're just not very tiger-like. The ferret suits you better--they're pretty and agile and clever. Besides," he added philosophically, dropping back down onto Draco's chest, "rodents are more useful animagi. They and birds are best for reconnaissance."
, but you definitely need a shower. And I refuse to remain sticky. So... What shall we do about this need for both of us to get clean?"
"Are you bloody serious??" Draco flipped up from the couch and walked to stand a scant inch or so from Harry. "You know what this development means? It means I am going to have to spend at least a day sorting out old memories to see what else I've been hiding in here! It means I..."
You're alive, for starters. That was touch and go for a lot of us for a while there.
were of the same persuasion. (And no, that excuse may be true but it is never particularly persuasive. Not in my experience, anyway.)
So settled, Harry resolved to ignore Malfoy's childish games and do whatever he damn well pleased, which, in this case, was to sit in the chair. He preferred to face an interviewee directly; it was easier to see the subtle nuances of body language that way.
"And that's why

Even so, he was looking forward to enjoying Draco's company over a nice meal. Their table at
"Right. Henry."

"Come on," he growled as his hand encircled Draco's cock tightly. He wouldn't last much longer, but he needed Draco to come first. "Come on..."
"If it helps," he added after they'd parted, "Ron is at least as uneasy as you. This is an excellent opportunity to surprise him with your wit and charm."
"Mm, I can smell lavender and hear piano... Just what have you got planned, my clever Auror?" Draco chuckled and nipped Harry's ear.
Luna went gracefully to the ground, assuming a lotus pose. She grinned at the two of them and gave them a thumbs up, tucking her white-blond hair behind one ear as she did so. She wore sequined green pickle earrings with a flouncy pale pink dress and knee-high stripy socks. Bless her queer little heart. At least Harry had one friend in his corner.
If Draco was being honest... Godrick. That could be a blessing as well as a curse. Harry was not ready for magic sex toys.
, by extension.
Malfoy released the silver wisp into the pensieve and made yet another confounding statement.
"Well, it was a while ago, I'm afraid. About two years. I was wearing gloves that night and I put it away in that case right after so my magical signature shouldn't be on it."
Draco gasped as Harry thrust and rutted against him like a needy animal. The heat between his legs and the noises Harry made (the pleading alone was so incredibly hot) had his prick considering to hardening again, but he knew nothing could come of it. Instead, he chuckled, sat up straight, and pressed his full weight onto Harry's cock like he had done before. This time, however, he merely held Harry's hips to anchor himself, content to let the Auror squirm and buck and finish himself off beneath Draco while he watched.
"Hm, that is tempting," Draco spoke with a sarcastic lilt, but the way he bit his lip and stared at the Auror's throbbing cock told a different story. He slid his hands over the interior of his knees and slowly down the length of his pale thighs.
Dragging a hand down his dripping face, Harry mentally prepared himself for the day ahead. If the last night and his subsequent rousing were any indication, it was going to be a long one.
*****
Harry knew the plaster wasn't particularly interesting, but a man was entitled to his pride, especially in so vulnerable a position. He waited quietly for his one-time nemesis to begin.
“Yes.”
First impression: Very Muggle.
But when Draco laid out on top of him, hot and pliant and pleased, and Harry remembered how incredibly sexy he'd been riding him like a Firebolt and how good it had felt leading up to the bittersweet orgasm, he decided that yes, he had enjoyed it. And he very much wanted to do it again.
"Who says it's foreplay?" Draco smirked up at Harry with an evil twinkle in his eye. "You denied me my chance to explore your body properly before, remember? Just be glad I'm not so cruel as to leave you waiting an hour while I poke," Draco pressed a finger against Harry's sphincter again, "and prod." His finger circled the hole as if to slip inside, but instead Draco slid the tip away and across the underside of the Auror's testicles.
There was nothing tentative in the kiss. No room for misgivings over the fact he was kissing a bloke while in full possession of his mental faculties. Harry knotted his fingers in the long, silky strands of Malfoy's hair and mapped the contours of his mouth with his tongue, tasting curry and onion and coconut and something earthier below those flavours that was all Malfoy.
"Nor do I reciprocate the offer by inviting someone out to a bar for a drink or bring them lunch and tea," Draco replied with a particularly tight downward thrust. "As for the outfit, well, I receive compliments from everyone everyday. How was I supposed to know different when it came to you? Some of us actually
Draco released the pillows in order to grab the slats of the headboard. With better leverage, he began to thrust in earnest against Harry's stocky digits. His right leg lifted to settle over Harry's shoulder, easing some of the strain building in the ligaments of his hip as his muscles began to tighten with imminent release.
*****
"He asked you out and you turned him down?" she guessed, sitting her prodigious, spandex-covered backside on the edge of the desk. "Why would you do that?"
Belying his complaint about the water temperature, Draco's fair skin began to pink almost immediately. His fine hair plastered to his skull--reminiscent of his adolescent style except in the length. Water dripped from his long eyelashes and the pointed tip of his nose and flowed down his body in rivulets that Harry wanted to follow with his tongue.
Draco squeezed a little tighter as his grip became slicker. The water from the shower and the heavy precum leaking from Harry's head proved to be effective lubricant, at least enough to allow firm, solid strokes without an unpleasant burn. His own cock stilled as he concentrated on Harry's, though the full length of it remained pressed from balls to head along the Auror's scalding crease.

Draco leaned forward with a wry grin.
For the first time in his career, he was taking a personal day.

"I'll do anything you want me to it you'll only spare my life," Draco replied in an overly dramatic tone. He grinned.

Draco cleared his throat awkwardly.
Draco ran his hands through his hair until the locks at least felt straight, acting as if he hadn't asked anything strange. He blinked when Potter finally responded and turned back to the blushing Auror with a grin that could rival the Cheshire Cat's.
"You're not as loose as I almost expected," Draco mentioned off-handedly as he began to thrust and grind his hands on Potter's insides--scooping and jabbing as he looked for the man's prostate. "I am going to enjoy this."
The first thing Harry noticed upon arriving at Diagon was Draco tugging his hand away. (

Harry watched the tailor work, focused on the task at hand. Once the measuring was done, he lowered his arms and turned his gaze back to Draco--just in time to see him deliberately fucking his hand, legs wide open, grey eyes smoldering. He quickly made his way to the couch while Gieves was busy adjusting the dress and pulled Draco's hands from his lap.

Harry crossed the room to Draco, both to offer comfort and to remove himself from the temptation of doing anything further to the unconscious individuals who had seriously pissed him off. He looked Draco over, noting the signs of shock and panic, and pulled him in for a bracing hug.
Malfoy. He's a manipulative git and I heard he's a whore to boot. You don't want to get your rocks off on that one--there's no telling what a Slytherin might be carrying, especially him."
Moving with the speed and grace that could only come from years of training, Harry snagged Draco's wrist and put an arm around his waist and tumbled him into bed.
all laid out and loose. Harry folded both hands tightly in his lap and focused on the important details of what the man had said.

of dating her and not the girl herself. She is my best friend's sister and would have been my ticket into the family I always wanted. But the fact I had no real feelings for her would have ruined us both sooner rather than later, even if I tried to fake my way through it. Which, I am not proud to admit, I considered.
Harry's face flamed.
Draco,
"I suppose I could live if you were to eat more than me," he began casually. "But only if you'll let me feed you dessert."
*****
******
"I'm actually glad to hear you say that," he admitted. "I thought--Pansy said something that made me think--" he reconsidered the wisdom of bringing up the ill-fated conversation real time. "Nevermind. It's not important. What is important is what we could do now." His voice dropped into the lower register. "At the table, or on the couch, or in the bed," he purred. "You mentioned having ideas earlier about 'making me sweaty all over again'? Anything in particular or did you plan to just... Wing it?"
In case you've forgotten, I don't give a witch's tit for what other people think I should be doing with my life. If I did, I'd be working for the Ministry right now rather than struggling through another one of McGonagall's brutal essays (you missed that assignment, by the way; I'll be in the library the rest of the night if you want help with it).
******
"Well, I feel somewhat avenged. How about you?" The question was casual as Draco planted his hands on the Auror's hips and squeezed.
"You're my hero," Draco drawled sardonically just before he was kissed. He wrapped his arms around Harry's thick neck and tossed him over the bed like an over-stuffed doll. Once the Auror was "helplessly" beneath him, Draco used his nude body to pin his lover (still covered by his towel) down into the mattress and grinned at him like a hungry predator. He held Harry's hands above his head.
Harry let that roll around in his skull for a minute. It still didn't sound all that complimentary to him, but he understood the weight of the statement a little better, at least. (And Merlin, it was a wonder Draco wasn't more screwed up with an upbringing like that.)
"Godrick,
Harry snorted, shaking his head in gentle protest. "I'm flattered, but I'm really not sure I deserve that vote of confidence. I have a very...Gryffindor approach to haircuts. It's sort of, 'trim first, ask questions later'."
He went to the counter, gathered up the remnants of his burger and the bag that contained Draco's and the large order of golden, curly fried potatoes, and brought the haul to the table.
******
*****
"Oh I was bluffing," Harry said with a shameless grin, earning a single dry chuckle for his honesty.
Draco shook his head and made his way down the hall. He had been to Grimmauld a few times before so he already knew the lay-out, as well as where the Gryffindor's room was.
It reminded him painfully of a young man sobbing in the loo.
"You didn't have any trouble in there, did you?" he asked.
," Draco panted in reply. "Fuck me like you mean it. Hard and deep. No stopping." He had to pause for breath between each phrase because Potter had complied immediately and it was glorious.
He'd never been with someone who got him so excited with words alone. But then, Draco'd been doing that for the last year without either of them realizing it with his books.
Harry gingerly set Draco on the nearest end of the long, polished table, detaching him from his ear in the process. He moved in between Draco's legs and took advantage of the fact he hadn't bothered re-buttoning his shirt. Harry pushed it aside and fixed his mouth on the side of Draco's neck, sucking hard to create a vibrant lovebite (in retaliation for the ones Draco had left on him).
On top of all the other miseries being sick brings (including that disgusting display you just

As for you, please come just as you are.
He was being modest. Some kinds of boasting were fine, but saying, 'I can easily hold my own against three skilled wizards,' seemed off-puttingly prideful (even if it was true).
"I'll be good," Harry vowed, nodding his head enthusiastically, comically eager. "Whatever that means to you, I'll do it. I'll hold your hand the whole time," he scooped it up to prove his commitment. "I'll eat your vegetables for you so you don't have to. Want me to hex somebody? Done. Front row tickets to the next Celestina Warbeck concert? They're yours."
He gave Harry's cheek a noisy kiss before letting him go in exchange for the Auror's hand. Draco winked.

But not terrible for a first try, he thought.
"Only a muggleborn or possibly a half blood with some kind of muggle medical background or connection would know that, though," he asserted, turning back to Ron. "Which should narrow down the list of possible suspects considerably but I haven't had any luck so far." He frowned. That meant another visit to Grabby Gladys.
Clothes off seemed like a brilliant idea and he was eager to comply, but doing so would mean a cessation of the really excellent dry humping that was happening just then, and that was a hard potion to swallow.

"Put your hackles down, Malfoy," Potter sighed exasperatedly.
As soon as Potter's brow twitched at his challenge Draco knew he had won. It was the man's tell, from as far back as second year. Apparently he had not figured it out yet. The fork fell to the plate and the happy screaming was back in full force in Draco's head. He remained silent and passive as Potter approached. A breathy "Harry" escaped into the Auror's mouth just as their lips connected. It was an awkward angle for the man, he knew, but an opportunity like this wasn't guaranteed to come again--he wouldn't waste it. Putting what experience he had and all the research and study he had done to good use (at last), he tilted his head into the sudden kiss to allow full access to his mouth, which parted with an intent for more. He licked the pink edge of Potter's lips in question.
I have made arrangements with your mum. I'll be by after work.
"They're married," he answered simply, picking the least loaded question out of the bunch. "And they have a baby. My goddaughter, Rose." He smiled briefly at the thought of the wee, chubby thing.

Harry placed a hand where he could tell Draco's head was and suddenly wished he were naked. It would have been nice to run his fingers through the man's soft hair and to tickle his nape, but it wasn't to be. (

"I appreciate your concern," he replied wryly, pushing his spectacles back up his nose from where they slid a bit. "I'm also mildly offended you still think I'm that dumb. This isn't my first time in a lab, you realize." He waggled his fingers in front of Draco and a shield charm materialized around them, pale and shimmering.
"Or maybe I should start with small steps and go frolicking out there like some love-sick Hufflepuff. Heh."
Harry needed a drink. The starched collar of his shirt was strangling him--he'd already stuffed its accomplice, the tie, into his suit pocket. He was roasting alive in the bloody jacket but Hermione told him he couldn't wear just a shirt and slacks to an evening wedding. Who came up with those asinine rules, anyway?

"That more to your liking?" he asked arrogantly.

The bigger surprise--except, not really--was his implication of Zabini as a willing accomplice and Parkinson as the brains behind the operation. Goyle fancied himself in love with the evil bint and she apparently carried a torch for Draco. Zabini, for reasons unknown, collaborated with the two of them to stage the attack as punishment for Draco's various sins, at least according to Goyle, who, in Harry's professional opinion, was more than half mad (and twice as dumb).
They managed to have a perfectly pleasant and generally appropriate exchange through the entirety of their meal. There were a couple of close calls when Draco employed his trademark double (or in some cases single) entendres and ate his meal just a tad more suggestively then was strictly prudent, but otherwise they were both on good behaviour. Which was important, because Harry was pretty sure at least one of the patrons who had been seated near them worked for the Prophet and was listening in on their conversation. (Even if Harry hadn't recognized the bloke, the fact that he was a single diner, only picked at his food occasionally, and happened to be taking copious notes at the table was a dead giveaway.)
As they made another turn about the dance floor, Harry began to find himself affected as well; heart thrumming in his throat for a reason wholly different from the physical exertion of the routine.
Harry was relieved (mostly) that Malfoy was putting aside the flirting at last. The sooner he could make real headway on this investigation, the sooner he could...think about the conflictual feelings and urges the man stirred up in him. Or something.
Malfoy smirked down at him but refrained from commenting. It seemed Harry’s willingness to indulge his whims had earned him at least a modicum of goodwill. It was a shame to cash it in so soon...but such was life.
" he sobbed.
"And I do plan to put the moves on you later, but we have to get through dinner first, so let's talk about something else." He cast about for a safe topic. It took more effort than it should have--his brain just kept supplying him with subjects that circled back to his desire to strip Draco down and put his hands and mouth all over him.
Harry was forced to admit, once again, that he didn't know Malfoy half as well as he thought he did.
He had finally looked away from Harry’s gruesome extremity to pierce him with his gaze, which Harry opted to take as tacit permission to re-dress. “It’s always worse when I’m thinking about it,” he replied, doing up his trousers while Malfoy watched. He neglected to mention the nausea that turned his stomach or the creeping dread that squeezed his chest vice-like or how the stench of his own burning flesh mixed with the acrid copper taste of blood in his mouth and the indescribable pain and sense of
He mused as he tried to recall the address Potter spoke into the Floo, but to no avail.
I admit that my own dream was to play Quidditch, at least for a few years, but with my current reputation that just won't be possible.
A fresh wave of guilt flooded through Harry.
"So good, so fucking good..." Draco let his head fall to his chest as he concentrated on keeping his balance--holding himself tight and taut for Harry.
Your turn: truth or dare.

And I meant "indulge" the same way I used the word "spoilt" about myself.

When he'd kissed the semi-permanent smirk right off Draco's face, he gingerly withdrew from his body to lay him on his back.

He hadn't ruled either Slytherin off his list of suspects or accomplices since they had conveniently disappeared right before the attack and were among the only people who knew about Draco's crush on him. His gut told him not to trust them (though, to be fair, it said that about most Slytherins--present company excluded).

Draco gave a nakedly adoring smile of his own but quickly smothered it with cocky attitude.

He placed the soufflés in the oven to bake while they ate.
"I'd like to go on at least one real date before we proceed," he finished earnestly, grateful to Harry for giving him the space to say so. "But make no mistake, I am very much looking forward to getting stuffed by you," he winked, attempting to lessen the impact of Harry's visible disappointment with the comedically crass declaration.
Malfoy crossed his arms. "What will you do if I say no?"
Secondly, it can't be
He peered closely at Malfoy, conveying as much seriousness as he could muster in his expression. "I hope you have enough respect for the work I do not to blab about it to the press," he said (the statement half-plea, half-threat).
Draco rolled his eyes. "You are not. That would have gone to press the moment you submitted your forms. Imbecile."
"Hey, princess," he called out, wadding up Draco's cone--chips and all. When Draco turned to look, Harry threw the rubbish ball at him. "I'm not your house-elf. You can clean up after yourself."
"We're headed to
Malfoy led Harry through the labyrinthine interior of the Manor to one of many large and lavishly decorated rooms within the ancient house. A huge unlit fireplace dominated one wall, with pink and cream marble for both the mantelpiece and the hearth. An oriental rug the size of a cave troll covered most of the floor, which was a polished stone of indeterminate origin (and extraordinary cost, he was sure). A dark pink velvet settee, rose-papered walls, delicate gold filigree on the oil lamps, and a series of watercolour paintings depicting idyllic gardens in full bloom lent the space a decidedly feminine air.

I admit, I did hate you in school, but that was a sentiment born of jealousy. And, really, jealousy is just an ugly version of admiration, isn't it? You are courageous, loyal, selfless and self-possessed. Everything I lacked. And you had the adoration and acclaim I so desperately wanted, which I had been raised to believe I was entitled to. I have done a good deal of growing up since then.
The amount of semen that actually came out of him was relatively small, but his entire body heaved and quaked as the climax ripped through him, triggered like an avalanche by the pain-pleasure jolt of Draco twisting both of his nipples and rocking hard onto his aching prick.
Wow. I wasn't expecting that. Okay, tell me a secret you haven't told anyone else. Not your fear of fire--I know that one already. I've seen you flinch around it too many times.
*****
Draco tilted his head and widened his legs to give Harry better access. He smirked and thought with amusement,
Ron didn't miss a beat. "Malfoy," he stated matter-of-factly, plopping down into the ancient sofa and looking to Harry for details. "Who started it then?" he asked around a mouthful of pastry.

******
Well then.
That was right. He did mention that, didn't he? Of course Potter wouldn't have actually kept up with his activities, that would have indicated he might have wondered where he was--and why would he? With a deep, heaving sigh Draco nodded and let it go, despite the odd sting of disappointment.
Harry's orgasm caught him by surprise--both in its suddenness and its intensity. Seemingly every muscle in his body tensed at once and he came on a silent scream, the pleasure exploding outward from his belly rather than his prick. Draco drew up, but not off, swallowing every last drop as Harry's bollocks emptied themselves, triggering another blinding spasm and a choked sob. By the time the aftershocks began to subside, his breath rattled in his lungs and spots danced before his vision.
******
"It was," Draco breathed as if he were trying to find some silver lining in his cloud of snark, but then smiled, "surprisingly edible."
Wild magic. The thought had occurred to him. It seemed as good an explanation as any but he hadn’t ever known wild magic to behave like that. But then it was capable of some rather odd things. Turning Aunt Marge into a balloon came to mind...

Draco smirked, rather smugly, as he was kissed and watched as his angry Auror dropped rather than set Weasley's plate before him, which nearly caused the red-head's precious red meat to skitter off. Draco took up his own fork and knife to slice apart the steak and openly ignore Weasley.
Draco continued to press against the special button that made Harry spasm as he slowly slipped off his cock and began to lick the head like a delicious lolly--lapping with the broad end of his tongue and probing the slit with the stiffened tip.
"Mm... For a man who doesn't know how to use a comb, you are certainly talented at shampooing."

"Ohhh... You mean who knew I was gay for that one heroing arsehole I used to know back in school? Only a few. Vincent, Gregory, Pansy, Blaise, and Severus."
*****
Venturing forth to seek help from a most unwelcome source, Draco made it all of five paces--foolish-looking bounding leaps, really--before encountering his first obstacle. The door to his lab was shut and locked tight. (He did not like to be interrupted while he was working). At least he discovered a silver lining to the detestable body in which he was trapped--he was able to squeeze under the narrow opening at the bottom with little difficulty. Apparently he was made of fluff and whimsy because he was able to contort himself into highly improbable positions to do so. It was...unseemly.
Everyone at the wedding seemed to be staring at them and whispering under their breaths. Normally this would alarm or annoy the Slytherin, but he found dancing with Harry Potter (though less than perfect) was actually enjoyable. The idea of allowing his former rival to lead him around the dance floor all night was becoming a more and more welcome idea. They were no longer chest to chest, as that would have made it difficult to move, and one of Draco's hands had slipped into Harry's to assume an appropriate stance.

"I'm not a fan of the position myself," he answered truthfully once outside his entryway. "It's too distracting. Someone's liable to injure their bits at some point trying it. But I'm willing to give it a go with you." (It certainly wasn't

"Well, if you hadn't stopped me that wouldn't have been an issue for much longer," Harry muttered as his grin went crooked. He licked between his teeth as he openly eyed Draco's ruffled looks.
*****
It was apparent how much of the world Malfoy missed as a shut in, though. He kept up with the major goings on through the papers, but he was perceptibly out-of-touch to Harry (now that he'd keyed in to that fact). He hoped that Malfoy would feel safe enough to begin venturing out again once his attacker was behind bars. All the more reason to solve the case quickly.
Gieves was a willowy man. Mid-50s. Sandy blond hair styled impeccably, with robes to match. He wore small, square wire-framed spectacles, which he peered over most of the time. He did so then to note the other person in the room, bent over with his naked arse in the air to retrieve the towering stilettos Pansy had paired with the gown. His face didn't so much as flicker, not even when Potter turned around with a cheeky grin, revealing himself to be the Saviour of Wizarding World.

"You don't think very highly of my intelligence, do you?" Potter continued, grimly cynical. (In point of fact, no, but Draco wasn't about to say as much to the man who held his fate in his hands and was a good deal more vindictive than he'd previously given him credit for.)
Hermione sighed, the fight gone out of her.
"Let's go, before I change my mind about making you a needy mess during our date and just fuck you."
"Are you ready?"
"I look better than fine and you know it," he retorted haughtily, thumbing the crisp edge of his lapel and tilting his head to its best angle, "but you are more than welcome to divest yourself of your pauper's garb before the tailor's arrival. I wouldn't object to being rid of the eyesore."
*****
He levered out of the overly plush chair, stole a final glance at Malfoy's room (which, he now realized, had been heavily glamoured), and went to walk out the door when he remembered the books on the mantle. Doubling back, he peered close enough to read the spines and was surprised to discover that they comprised the entire Morias collection.
making pleasant, if disorienting and raunchy, conversation. And his company was...otherwise enjoyable.
Draco jumped as the book was suddenly tossed at him, eyes wide with surprise, but his old Seeker's reflexes kicked in just in time to catch the thing mid-air-toward-face. He set it aside on the coffee table and grinned.
Draco's bare toes were curling against the tiled floor. His skin began to perspire as his body grew hotter and hotter with every passing moment. The growl Potter produced wasn't helping matters. He gripped onto the Auror for dear life with one hand on his thigh as their tongues battled for dominance--Draco's stabbing and caressing as he tried to win back control. Potter's muscular stomach was like an inferno against his free hand, which splayed across the man's lower abdomen and slowly ascended onto his chest. He gripped the tight pectoral he found and flicked his thumb against what he imagined would be a dusky nipple. The tip of his thumb circled the areola and he vaguely measured its diameter to about an inch, maybe an inch and a half. It shrank under his ministrations until its peak stood upright, prompting him to pinch and tug.
I myself am overjoyed that my sentence is almost complete. I will probably cast spells for an hour before leaving the house. I miss my wand terribly.
Harry dropped his head against the seat back with an agonized groan.
Hey Malfoy,
"What's the break through?"
He summoned a pillow from the bed to make kneeling more comfortable and got into position behind Draco's head. "Wet your hair for me, please," he requested, pouring shampoo into his hands and working up a rich lather.
If I could trust that the exchange would remain between us, I would be more than happy to write.
He thought about drawing things out, teasing Draco in retribution for all his torment earlier, but Harry was just too impatient for revenge. He traded his middle finger for his thumb and pressed the tip inside. Draco wasn't wet enough for thrusting, but he lodged his finger in place and stroked the perimeter of Draco's prostate while wanking his prick with quick, rough pulls.
"I am not in the habit of sleeping with individuals who are part of an ongoing investigation," he answered, fixing Malfoy with a serious expression. He was reminding himself just as much as the irrepressible tease, however. "Nor would I take advantage of someone who is emotionally compromised or under the influence of a potion. If you aren't in the mood to discuss your case, you can apparate or Floo home from here. In the meantime, I will continue trying to do my job."

I would be very interested in the Black family heirlooms. My mother, I'm sure, would wish quite strongly (if she were still here and not off galavanting about France) to regain much of what was lost.

Draco chuffed in response. He considered walking to the Dungeons under his own power, but it was a
Draco chuckled quietly at the moniker. It had been applied to him before, but never with the hint of a smile Potter sported when he'd said it. That small, novel alteration had Draco quickening his motions, almost without noticing.
*****
Some 30 minutes later, a sad, soggy owl landed on his desk with a wet plop and a baleful glare. He gave it an extra treat for the trouble of being sent out in the rain and scanned the parchment it bore to discover that Malfoy had agreed to the visit but sounded to be in a right snit over being awakened so early (which was patently ridiculous because Harry had sent the owl at 10:30 that morning).
--when he finally managed to balance on one leg on the unstable surface, a feat that had taken him three weeks to accomplish. Harry was so overcome with the immediate and powerful urge to snog him senseless over that smile that he'd done the only thing he could think of to distract himself--throwing a heavy medicine ball directly at Malfoy's chest, his only warning being a hastily called, "Catch!"
Draco abandoned the task before his thirst was fully slaked to groom himself into a semblance of tidiness. Potter set the dish on the low table and reclined back into the cushions of the sofa, propping an ankle over his knee and twisting the cap off his beverage. He looked like he wanted to say something but was interrupted by the sudden
"Why don't you tell me more about your mum, for starters?" he prompted. "I didn't realize it was such good news, even though you'd said so. Honestly, it didn't sound that great to me."
"Granger came up with this?" Draco asked with surprise, but after a second he chuckled and squeezed Harry's hand. "I should have known. I'll have to send her something nice later."
Draco was in a snit. If he frowned any harder he might sprain something.
"For the love," Draco exclaimed, rolling his eyes at Potter's theatrics. He stood from the settee (allowing his robes to fall away completely) and crossed the room to where the Chosen One gasped and wheezed like a landed carp. Turning him round, he deftly untied Gieves' precision bow and loosened the bodice, to Potter's exaggerated relief. He left the lacing tight enough to support the gown without restricting Potter's airway overmuch.
Harry bobbed a few times more, spurred on by Draco's commentary, but he was becoming overly hot rather quickly (and, if he was being honest with himself, a tad woozy from the exertion).
The case is resolved. It was as straightforward as it appeared, unfortunately. Man gets mad. Man attacks wife. Man is sentenced to parole and mandatory visits with a Mind Healer. I have filed all the necessary paperwork.
He was only sort of joking.

Draco had set the bag down on the counter and was grabbing plates as Harry spoke. He flinched and frowned at Harry's thoughtless ranting, but said nothing. It had definitely sent his mood falling a few spikes down. With a deep breath, Draco pulled out... Orange, fried curls. He recognized them as chips, but they were shaped like springs. Draco lifted one to examine.
******
Draco easily fell into the hug. It was a relief--such a simple note of affection was what really convinced the blonde that his lover wasn't angry. He squeezed Harry around his neck and let loose a sigh.
Harry knew this was coming. Draco had been silently and impatiently willing him to hurry up and finish for the last several minutes so they could move on to the afters he had planned, but Harry was not going to rush his dessert. It was too good for that--it deserved to be savoured.
Was it really any surprise Malfoy didn’t want the intimate details of his disability discussed with someone else? Particularly Hermione, given Malfoy’s complicated history with Harry and his friends.
"Vanilla? It's nice."
Please send me more of your fantastic potion. I would be most grateful. The hospital stuff smells like death and leaves a weirdly sticky film.
Harry cleared his throat. Had he somehow found himself in one of Draco's torrid stories? It was beginning to seem plausible.
Draco stuck out his tongue.
"I love you," he whispered as his body desperately tried to calm itself. "I'm such an idiot... There was so much going on and too many things on my mind and my Occlumency hadn't been utilized as often... These are all just excuses, but the point is I screwed up and put you in danger. Again."
*****
He rubbed his palms on Draco's outer thighs and wondered if he was brave enough to ask for what he wanted. Deciding the worst that could happen was Draco saying no (well, he
The trip to the loo was short. It didn't take long to arrive and finish his business, so with what he considered to be plenty of time left for one to be reasonably gone for the toilet, he decided to have a quick look around.The water closet often spoke volumes about a person, almost as much as the bedroom, after all.
Though she was a clever witch--nearly sorted Ravenclaw, he'd learned during his first year as her colleague--he would rather Minerva not hear of the incident if it could be avoided. She might restrict his lab privileges. Flitwick, of course, enjoyed a good riddle, but he was off visiting family for the holiday. The other professors were obvious no's--
“All right. Wanker,” was Harry’s reply. (Never let it be said he lacked a poet’s wit.)
"If punishment is what you want to give," Draco whispered back as he slowly licked his lips. He smirked, his eyes slightly hooded as he stared down his pointed nose. "Especially if it involves more of this."
He knew for a fact that was the case. Witch Weekly had taken to referring to Malfoy as
"Thanks," Harry said sheepishly, catching a wayward drop of water at the corner of his mouth. His voice remained hoarse even after the thoughtful drink.
He promptly forgot the lesson he'd learned not five minutes earlier--his heart clenched in sympathy. And the roaring lion within him (which demanded justice for all and championed the plight of the downtrodden) pawed and paced on Malfoy's behalf.

good in the sack or did you finally hit your head one too many times? Seriously, Harry. He's a Malfoy.
He apparated them both to doorstep of his flat. There was no chance of Draco getting splinched with as tightly as he'd wrapped himself around Harry--he began taking Harry's trousers off before they even got inside.
Harry shuddered and spasmed as he came deep into Draco's ready throat. He stopped bobbing to suckle on the head and greedily devour the seed that spilled forth--like a man in the desert without water. Once he knew for certain Harry was emptied, Draco pulled off and sat back on his haunches with a smug smirk--lips red and eyes glazed.
All laughter left immediately after the Auror began stroking him again and was replaced by gasping moans. "

Given that Harry was already maximally embarrassed, it was a little late for that. But he could spare Malfoy, at least.
a normal incarcerous."
"And this date had been going so well," he huffed. "Now I'm sticky with sweat, hungry, craving chocolate more than ever, and someone out there is trying to hurt you or me or both...Though," he paused mid-step and turned to Harry. "No one knew I was bringing you. Hell, no one knows we're dating, do they?"
He didn't often pull out all the stops when he was cooking for one. If anything, he just ate store bought biscuits or ice cream straight from the container. It was nice having the excuse to get a little creative in the kitchen.
He put the nub of his quill between his teeth absently and flicked the tip with his tongue.
His immediate thoughts were consumed with the removal of the scalding substance from his person. He didn't have time to worry about the fact a good portion had gotten into his eyes and mouth. That is, not until the bone-twisting, stomach-churning pain of transformation set in, erasing all petty concern for things like ruined robes and superficial burns. He clutched his stomach and doubled over in agony, dangerously close to sicking up on his Oxfords. The room spun dizzily and suddenly he was falling.
"Now where were we," he segued back to the task at hand, rolling his hips as he said it to remind Draco exactly what they had been up to.
"Would you mind finishing up without me? I'd like to use your Floo to call Pansy, if I may. I don't have one, lest Blaise come through to try and molest me in my sleep (as he did on more than one occasion at Hogwarts). He once attempted sneaking to my room at the Manor when he was staying over during the summer after fourth year, but I anticipated him and had traps waiting. I awoke to see him hanging upside down in a magical net looking right cross."
Salazar's saggy undergarments, of course he did!
"And this is exactly why I want to take things slow... Despite my libido demanding otherwise," he chuckled. "Nice metaphor, by the way," he added as an aside. "Since when are you so clever?"
"Don't believe the rumours," he muttered. "And for the love of Merlin, don't stop."

Although the number and variety of levers and switches therein was daunting, Harry was eventually able to get the water on and set to the highest pressure and temperature and billowing steam soon filled the room. He fiddled with another knob and the refreshing scent of jasmine began to mask his own unpleasant odour. He stepped inside, sucking in a hissing breath as the needle-like droplets stung his skin, but he relished in the feeling. Unlike the others, this was a pain that he chose. It was one of the only things that reliably allowed him to clear his mind. With all his chaotic thoughts stilled for the moment, he methodically scrubbed the layers of sweat and grime from his person. He’d remember soon enough that he was washing up for dinner with Malfoy.

Warmest regards,
No matter who Harry had been with, he'd always taken a certain pride in making his partners climax. Draco was no exception. And, Circe's circlet, he came spectacularly--it was a full body orgasm, with whimpers and swears and moans and groans and spurt after spurt of hot, sticky come coating his hand as he milked Draco dry.
"I have been known... To leave an impression..."
"The idea certainly has merit," he replied circumspectly, clinging to Potter for balance though he felt secure in his hold, "but I am reluctant to pass up an opportunity to have that sweet arse of yours while you're wearing the gown. Just think of the different angles those heels will make possible for us," he reasoned, tone laden with suggestion.

wine. Of course the one good tradition had been thrown. Luckily, there was a punch bowl (which seemed a little pedestrian, but there was no accounting for taste) and even luckier was the vodka Draco had a feeling he would need carefully stashed away inside his cloak. He casually cast a Notice-Me-Not and poured half the glass bottle into the defenseless strawberry and cherry sparkling whatever with a sneer of glee. After, he stole the vodka away into the pocket from whence it came and scooped a generous amount for himself into a delicate, flower shaped glass.
Draco felt comforted by the affection, but couldn't speak. He hadn't expected it to hurt after all their experimenting (and his own), but it did. It stung after Harry popped in and even more so the further inside he pushed. However, Draco merely nodded at the question--unable to answer and to hopefully avoid alarm in the Auror. Draco took a deep breath to help loosen his muscles.

"I remember some things from Hogwarts. Like your insane love for Treacle Tart," Draco shook his head out like a dog for a second, further mussing up his once perfect locks. "Mother is in town. I'm staying at the Manor for now until she leaves next week. She wanted to go on a shopping spree and I demanded we go somewhere no one knows us, especially me... So, Russia. She also cut my hair. What do you think?"
You had better not extend my stay! I know you could do it if you bribed the right people.
"Incredible and earth shattering?" Harry repeated with a shit-eating grin. "You do know how to stroke my ego. ...Among other things." (He couldn't resist.) He propped himself up on his elbows to see Draco's face, thinking about his answer with the seconds he bought.
"Well, I can at least get this place cleaned up so Hermione won't have to wait to brew after she's cracked your barmy code," Potter announced, more to himself than Draco, it seemed.

"Pain and discomfort are always worse when you're not in direct control of them," he explained patiently, withdrawing until just the head of his prick remained between Draco's arsecheeks. That was a principle he'd learned formally in Auror training, but which had been deeply ingrained in him years earlier. "So take control, Draco. Tell me when and how you want me to move. I'll do exactly as you say."
Though your terms are as simple as I might expect from you, your wisdom about getting to know one another is sound. I would hate to think you are only interested in me because I am gay and available.
Draco leaned forward into the embrace and lazily licked and sucked at Harry's invading tongue. He moaned softly as his cock was taken.
“Those are hardly sterling examples of—” Draco interrupted but Harry continued undeterred.
"I like denims," Harry replied simply with another shrug of indifference. "Besides, it's all coming off later, so what does it matter what I'm wearing now? I might as well be naked, for all intents and purposes." It took a great deal of effort not to smirk as he said it.

Draco took Harry's wand that had fallen to the bed and tossed it carefully across the room to his full hamper, where it landed quite harmlessly. Draco's own wand followed soon after.
He took the seat across from Draco and put his forearms on the table, decorum be damned. He leaned forward on to them in order to be closer to his date when he proclaimed, "I think you just like being difficult."
Draco's estimation of Potter as a lover rose several degrees in response to the man's skillful and unhesitating tongue. He bit his lip against the sounds that wanted to escape; a single needy whimper made it through. Potter had effectively knocked the smirk off Draco's face, which was not easily done.
