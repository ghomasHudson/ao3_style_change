It’s just that everyone experiments sometimes. That’s how the best (and most deadly) potions were created after all. It didn’t mean anything.
“Is he... I mean, are they…”
“No. Well, technically right now I am, but I haven’t been alone for long.” Draco paused. “And before you ask, yes, my previous partner happened to be a man. But I didn’t want myself outed on that pathetic thing you call a radio show.”
He felt Potter’s question, the cool, minty breath on his cheek, more than heard it. He blinked, centering his gaze, and when he opened his eyes, they were filled with green instead of gold.
“It was four and a half, Potter,” Malfoy added with a wink.
Neville hummed in agreement. “But there are other ways to trigger those endorphins.” Pulling out his wand, Neville tapped the item in his palm. It began to buzz, vibrating against Neville’s skin. “The endorphins are what send our partners into Subspace, so if we can’t utilize spanking, flogging, or crops, we have to induce a stressful situation another way.”
He heard a gasp from his left, Melody or Abbott, he wasn’t sure. Either way, no one was stopping him. Not now.
Harry paused, still gripping Draco’s wrist and holding him to his burgeoning erection. “What did you say?”
“An Occamy! It was as big as a dragon, but then Mr Rolf made it shrink into a tea kettle! You’ve got to come and see it!” Teddy tugged at the sleeve of Potter’s shirt, and finally, he tore his eyes away from Draco.
Draco was positive his face was contorted in confusion as Potter continued. “I never left. I just… transferred to another class.”
Potter placed his finger to his lips, motioning for Draco to be quiet, as he studied the limbs of the trees. After a moment, Potter raised his hand to point towards one of the uppermost branches.
Neville starts teaching, and he's got a special guest to help him.
“But he doesn’t,” Draco said it as a statement, thinking back to his fantasy in the tub.
Draco would return from the shower, fully dressed and none-the-wiser, and Harry would have a half-hard cock and a stupid grin on his face, before kissing his husband goodbye and watching him floo off to work.
Potter wasn’t in their room when he finally made it back from his classes. Instead, there was a note quilled to his door.
“I just call ‘em like I see ‘em. Which is better than you see the Snitch, I dare say.”
Harry clicked off his mic and kicked his chair backwards. Rolling his shoulders, he stretched before standing up out of his chair. Sometimes, especially when the Cannons were playing, Harry really loved this excuse of a job.
“Oh gods, what is that?” he asked, pinching his nose.
That was why he was bared naked in their playroom after all. He'd asked to be blindfolded. He knew by the end of the night, he would beg for release.
“Neville’s girlfriend. Neville lives with me.”
“We’re...not expecting guests for dinner, are we? If it’s Weasley, I need to double my recipe completely.”
Harry shuddered at the praise and focused on staying still, staying silent until his next command. Finally, he could hear the distinct tapping of his Master’s hand on his leg.
“Do what,” Draco begrudgingly mumbled into his pillow.
Already vibrating with need, it only took a few more pulls and one final twist of his wrist before he was coming, hot and hard. With a loud whine, Draco spilled all over his palm as he crested into his orgasm.
There was no denying it now. That was definitely the breathy moan of Potter.
Draco tugged open the heavy wooden door to the pub, already able to taste darkened ale on his tongue, when he stopped suddenly in his tracks.
“I said, why not, Malfoy?” Potter said. He was demanding an answer, Draco knew. He also knew he needed to be honest. With Potter, and with himself.
Thank you to my incredible beta, pomponia, and terrific consistency reader, crow! I appreciate you both!
He didn’t mind the absence of one of his senses. It heightened all of his other ones.
“For what?”
As Neville and Draco turned past a bunch of Burst-Not Bouncing Bubbles and a herd of children chasing after them across the grass, he spotted the witch who could only be his Aunt Andromeda. Draco’s stomach tightened even more as they headed in her direction.
He wondered if those hands were coarse, if they’d feel rough as they ran down Draco’s sides. Would they be strong as they gripped onto his hips. Would they leave little purple bruises from pressing into his delicate skin too hard.
“We could go back to mine?” Potter said, out of breath. “Luna will take Teddy home.”
“Don’t pretend you knew him, Potter.”
“You may come,” his Sir commanded, and Harry finally let himself tip over the mountain he had been climbing for the past half-hour, for the past week. His orgasm overcame him, and Harry could feel his body convulse in pleasure.
Draco gasped inadvertently as Neville’s hands continued to tease Theo, his mouth working his way back up to Theo’s throat, to the metal band that cinched tightly around his neck. He clutched the globes of Theo’s arse and began to knead them, exposing the tiniest of glimpses of a furled pink hole.
Whew, that last chap was rough. Here's a soothing balm of soft goodness for you.
“Do let Alexsander know,” he said as he crossed the threshold. “Poor fellow was in a tizzy with worry.”
That small glimpse of Potter’s cock, ridged in another man's hand as he trailed bites down Potter’s bared throat had been enough to completely fuck up Draco’s world.
Theo was one of the few Slytherins Draco thought he’d keep in touch with. They gave it a real shot for a bit, meeting at taverns and the occasional party they would be dragged to attend. However, when Draco began his apprenticeship, they lost touch. His time was stretched thin between classes and practicums and required dinners with his parents that Draco just hadn’t had time for much else. Perhaps that was how he also missed Pansy’s breakdown. He really needed to thank Ginny one day for helping her through that.
His cock was hard. He knew it, just as easily as he knew Potter was hard, breathing hard as well, even as he continued to stand stock still in Draco’s snarl. He didn’t want to stop, didn’t want this feeling to go away. He heard Longbottom’s growl over his shoulder, a warning surely, but he wouldn’t quit.
Draco scoffed. He could sleep as long as he craved,
“I’ll take care of you.” Draco murmured it to himself, to the image of Potter on his cock.
He figured Potter would have grabbed a towel as well, but instead he just cocked his head and gave Draco an approving nod before saying, “Looking good, Malfoy.”
the witches wanted between their legs, and instead switched over to his favourite topic.
Neville paused. “Your limits are your limits, Draco. But if you’re curious about something, we can talk about it.”
Draco gasped, and his face instantly turned bright red at his audible response. In all of his years, he had never heard of someone doing something
Raising her thinly manicured eyebrows, Pansy asked, “Elvish wine or scotch?”
Nevertheless, he was more than curious about how to properly ‘prep’ and not rush like Ernie had with Theo. If that situation came along for him, he wanted to be ready. A Malfoy was always prepared.
“Ten with my palm,” he said, and Harry felt the smooth pads of his fingers dance across his naked bottom until they cupped his skin roughly. “And then ten with my belt.”
Harry clenched his arse again, trying to hold onto his Master’s finger even as it withdrew. “Yes, please, anything,” Harry babbled. He wanted, needed everything, anything, whatever he could get.
Of course it wasn’t about Potter. He just hadn’t seen the arsehat since that day when everything crumbled apart, towers falling and curses flying and Potter wilted and cold in Hagrid’s arms. He had fled with his parents, not knowing and no longer caring how the war would end. So much had already been lost; so many.
Convincing yourself of things is truly an art, much like mixing the finest potions; one must be confident in one's ability to track the moon and pierce the skin and dice the ingredients into the exact proportions as precisely as one must be to create such a grand tale that they don’t question their own thought process.
Neville continued to pump his hips, sliding his length in and out of Theo’s mouth so slowly and reverently, his hands squeezing Theo’s in syncopation. Theo’s eyes were closed, his lashes fluttering as he was reduced to just taking, swallowing down what he could, at Neville’s mercy.
Draco had shaken the water out of his hair, trying to rid the image of someone else claiming Potter. No. That would not do.
Until the next morning.
The grounds were decorated in a combination of Gryffindor red and gold side by side with Hufflepuff canary and black, punctuated by streamers that magically hung and twisted above their heads, and large plush badgers bristled excitedly from the corners while balloon lions growled and tugged on their weighted strings.
“Not true,” Potter spat back as their surroundings became filled with wet witches and wizards scrambling for cover.
“Everyone is different, like all the plants at my shop, and we tend to them differently as well.” Neville held the vibrator between his finger and thumb. “Since Theo doesn’t like my hand, I use one of these instead.”
Draco arched, pushing his shoulder blades into the wall as his hips canted forward into his waiting hands. It should have felt like it normally did, when he pulled himself off in the confines of his four-poster, silencing charms blocking off the noise from his surrounding mates.
I finally had the courage to ask
“Well, on that note, let’s hear a bit of music! Here’s
“If you insist.” Potter smiled before wrapping his arms around Draco and pulling him into a toe-curling kiss.
A chosen knight on a borrowed broom
Soaring through your fears
Looking from side to side, and finding that most of the surrounding attention was on the couple on the bed and not Draco himself, he quickly tugged his belt out of its loops, lowered his trousers, and grasped at his cock through his pants.
Draco didn’t want to answer that. Instead, he stood up out of the circle and fled.
Draco didn’t acknowledge his statement, nor his apology, his hands aimlessly folding napkin squares into origami swans as he continued to dress the table. Harry had no choice but to continue.
” Harry pressed a few buttons, and thought he heard the sounds of guitars strumming the intro to the popular rock song. He turned his chair and pulled Malfoy into his lap.
If you skipped the last chap, Neville taught a class and it brought up some not great feelings/memories for Draco. However, Neville being the excellent Dom/friend he is, took him home (as a friend!) and helped him process. Then he invited Draco to Teddy's birthday party. And here we are!
“Oh,” she chuckled, “please, call me Andy. Everyone does.” She gave him one more squeeze before releasing his hands from her gentle grasp. She wiped a tear away from her eye before giving him a grin. “Now, it’s almost time for cake! Would you both gather everyone together, and I’ll round up the birthday boy?”
“It’s not the same, is it?”
"He did," Draco nodded, leaving out the part where he didn't understand half the words. What were
Theres a bit of daddy kink here (Nev/Theo)
When he returned the next night, Neville showed Draco how to check his Submissive’s blood circulation, to see if a muscle or tendon was being stretched too taut. They used realistic dummy’s again, and Draco wondered if Neville ever played with anyone else to explore his own green kinks that didn’t overlap with Theo’s.
Notes about this chapter: spanking is involved, also mentions of spousal physical abuse (slapping across ones face) and family abuse, Draco remembers some unpleasant family memories and has to recover from that.
“They snogged, sure. A long, long time ago. Potter felt like he had something to prove.”
“If you have a match, you need to kiss!” Pansy’s giddy voice filled the room. “With tongue!”
He had run away from those walls, like a coward after everything he had done to destroy the place he had affectionately thought of as a second home for seven years.
“Malfoy, come on, it’s pouring.” Potter’s eyes were now staring at his wrist, cuffed by Draco’s fingers.
Thank you so much for all the love on the last chapter. Draco appreciated it as well.
A big thank you to everyone who is continuing on this journey! We have ten chapters to go, and I'm so excited for the wonderful stories that are yet to come.
Draco has a fun night, both at the club and in his bedroom.
Whispering the password at the lamppost, Draco hurried down the stairs. “Hello, Oli!” he said to the wixen at the front.
“Besides, your lists may change as you immerse yourself deeper into this lifestyle and you push your limits and boundaries.”
“No demands,” Draco shook his head vigorously. “No orders or stipulations. I am providing an option to salvage our evening or to end it. The choice is yours.”
Draco gulped as he took in Neville’s fully exposed form. Those cardigans really hid the bulk of Neville’s shoulders, and the muscles on his forearms were bigger than any Draco had seen, even in some of his favourite Quidditch magazines. He watched as Neville’s hand dipped under the hem of Theo’s pants, rubbing the bulge that hid under the thin fabric.
“Ginny!” Harry cried out the second his foot was over the threshold.
He wanted,
Potter hadn’t failed though. He did what he was supposed to do, and unlike cowering Draco, he succeeded.
“I could be.”
On their date.
Deep down, he knew he’d made his amends and that there would always be those that hated him, or blamed him, or didn’t want to know the new Draco. He just really hoped that his aunt, or even his cousin, wouldn’t be one of those people.
“No, it’s fine because It’s not a date,” Draco spluttered. “At least, I don’t… exactly know if it is or isn’t.” His cheeks were getting flushed, and his hands were gripping his glass tightly.
“Now?” Draco panicked. He hadn’t kissed anyone since, well since Pansy and that was four years ago and this was Potter and he was so...and Draco was-
Malfoy’s face paled. “So you’ve heard,” he snarled. “Want to poke more fun at my sex life, do you?”
Honey. He could still smell honey.
Thank you again to pomponia for the beta, and to crow for the consistency check!
As was Draco, frozen in place and bare as a baby. He wanted to gather up his robes and slither out of the showers, but he found he was frozen in place.
“Perfect, you’re here. I cannot
“Kiss before I leave?” Draco said, arching his eyebrow in curiosity at Harry, trying to lean casually backwards on their dresser. “Or do you have more reorganising to do?”
“Okay, is this because you kissed me back?”
“The match with the Dementors.”
“Maybe I do,” Harry said. Maybe he just wanted Malfoy to keep talking.
Wasn’t that the rub. Doing everything you could to please others, and still falling short. Still finding, at the end of the day, that you’re a failure.
“It’s like a weight, resting right between my shoulder-blades. And, when we play, Ginny lifts it. I...can’t describe it any other way. I can only focus on her, not on all the other distractions.” She smiled, her eyes drifting off to that blank space on the wall again. “It’s freeing.”
“I must be off.” Draco chanced a glance at Potter.
He didn’t go back to the Manor, though. Instead, he checked into the Leaky, shut the curtains and shut out the world.
“Your fucking gorgeous chest,” Draco murmured as he let his hands grip the sides of Potter, the sharp angles right above his trousers. His shirt was made of cotton, and Draco relished the texture, softness against the heat radiating beneath the thin cloth. Potter just stared back, hands at his sides, his breath uneven, his eyes glassy, licking his lips uncontrollably.
“We have two choices. One, I order takeaway and we have a lovely evening over Chinese dumplings, or two, you both leave.”
“Pants at Quidditch, did you see that fumble last week? Cost the Arrows the game.”
He tried to pretend to be asleep again, but Potter wasn’t buying it.
They met in the Charms classroom again that night.
to a dirty post in the middle of Diagon Alley. When he walked through reception, the same kind wixen directed him ‘down the hall, first door on the left, love’.”
“Rules?” Draco interjected.
He blinked, then closed his eyes and slowly opened them. No, Potter was still staring. Directly at him. With his beautiful green eyes.
Draco wanted to reach out, hug his friend and hold her tight and tell her that it was all going to be okay. But it wasn’t. Her parents barely spoke to her, in the same clipped tones his own parents used. He didn’t know how to comfort her, in the same way he didn’t know how to comfort himself. Instead, he usually lashed out, panicking, letting his magic running rampant out his veins.
She shrugged. “Why do you think my hands are so warm when I come back in?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Haven’t flown in a while,” Draco said, his voice barely audible. It was the truth, but it also didn’t matter what he said, he just wanted to keep talking. To hear Potter talk in that low whisper, to have their faces so close that he could just lean, only a little, blame it on the wind, or —
Thanks as always to my alpha, EvA-Eleanore and my cheerleader, Thunder of Dragons. And Dom!Daddy!Neville.
“You too,” Draco said, still eyeing him suspiciously, but eventually turned and headed out.
Theo departed quickly down the hallway from Neville’s orders. In all the years he’d known Theo, he didn’t think he’d ever seen him move so fast. Neville leaned back into the sofa, taking a few more sips of his water.
Like what the fuck precious, perfect Potter was doing in a kink establishment.
“Potter.”
Things were going great. Draco had successfully finished his apprenticeship and secured employment at the finest potionery in Diagon; his small, but solid grouping of friends were a grateful stability in his life; his father rested underground where he could no longer scar Draco with his words; he visited his mother every Sunday between 4 and 7pm, enough time to share pleasantries but not long enough to sour an awkward supper.
“So,” Neville continued, “there are three types of play we’re going to discuss in a power exchange like a Dominant to a Submissive.” He motioned toward Theo. “The first, being demonstrated here, is a glance at preference training.” Neville paused, licked his lips, and commanded. “Position two, please.”
“You don’t want to hear about my gay panic.”
“If you’d accept me for wearing them,” Draco huffed out. “I don’t wear them for you, after all.”
Sliding the comb back into its wooden drawer, Draco glanced at his appearance once again. Not a hair out of place, robes freshly pressed, collar sharp against his pale neck. No one would guess what he was hiding underneath his clothes; underneath his skin. Even he avoided thinking about it most of the time.
Draco squinted into the tree and subsequently into the magicked sun that beat down on the exhibit. He thought he saw, but no. It couldn’t be.
If Draco could play with a Submissive and have a relationship outside of the club. Was that allowed, and if so, would he want that? Deep down in his heart, he didn’t think so; he wanted a partner in play and in life.
He’d worry about that tomorrow, drawing his attention instead to his old friend, who was currently nestled on the floor, knees pressed into the tips of Longbottom’s sturdy black boots. His chest was bare, his breathing ragged and his head bowed, his hands already clasped tight behind his back.
“Only that he’s a prick.” Harry scrunched up his nose. “And that he’s been torturing you all season. Is that why you haven’t been playing well?”
“Oh gods,” Theo moaned as he bounced up and down. “Oh fuck, yes Daddy.”
Ginny sighed. “Well, then you’ll just have to go and find out. If I know Harry, he’ll make sure you know one way or another.” She stood and set her glass down on the nearby table, before turning and holding out her hand to Pansy. “And now, I’m going to show you how asking for what you want works in your favour.” Pansy took her hand as Ginny pulled her off of the couch. “Let’s go see Oli for some Sober-Up, and then I want you naked, bound and desperate for my mouth before my tea gets cold.”
“He knew mine too. Do you always think you’re special?”
That morning, he watched as Draco left their room, arms full of clothes as he headed to the shower. Harry practically dove out of bed the second the door shut, wondering if he could get a quick wank out while holding the frilly fabric and rubbing his thumb over the soft green ribbon that weaved its way across the top. But when he reached into the drawer, his hand came back empty.
“Everything else disappears.”
“That bad, hmm?” Pansy pulled two tumblers out of her cupboard before pouring a finger of scotch and a splash of water into both. She handed one to Draco, and took a seat next to him at the table. “Talk to me. Parents?”
Applause broke out around them, and Draco felt a drop of rain on his cheek. He sneered, then shouted again over the clapping. “Just couldn’t be in a class with me, then.”
“I think Ginny was just-”
Did he want this? Did Potter want this?
“Less than a foot?” Malfoy growled out of the phone and directly into the speaker where all of Harry’s listeners could clearly hear him. “More like a yard, and you failed to mention the sheets of rain that kept falling out of the sky.”
Thanks again, y'all, for reading along, for warming my heart with your kind words, for keeping me motivated and supporting me when I lagged behind on my posting schedule. It means so much to me. I hope you all enjoyed.
Screamed into the face of flames
“I’ll take care of you,” Neville groaned.
It became a habit. Draco would head into the shower, and Harry would head to the drawer, reaching his hands in deep until they touched the stockings. His heart would race, and he’d want to yank them out and pull them over Draco’s creamy thighs, make him twirl and strut, and then return to Harry’s lap for a good fucking.
“Ah, that’ll be John. Not his real name, I don’t think, but he tends to like the redheads. He’s always asking Gin about Ronnykins.”
Draco cast a Tempus and growled inadvertently at his cursed wand with its cursed time. He was late. And he hadn’t prepared a single thing for his parents’ monthly dinner.
“Mr Malfoy, don’t you look nice tonight,” Oli grinned. “Mr Longbottom is waiting in the training room,” they said before pointing down the hall.
“But… as his date…” Pansy mused.
“So, you’re my godfather's cousin,” Potter responded, flashing a smile. Draco trained his eyes away from that gorgeous grin and instead focused on the shock of blue being chased by a swarm of red-heads.
“Ron!” Harry shouted.
A familiar voice to his right cut through the singers. Draco turned to his right, spotting familiar green eyes across the crowd.
One chap left! I have a whole series planned for next year (incl. scening at the club for all three couples, relationship goals *cough* collaring *cough* and very naughty play/dirty talk which was intended to get into this story but...Draco is a precious bean and needed to take his sweet ass time. Please subscribe to the series and stay tuned!
With that, Draco walked into his bedroom and threw himself across his cardigan-covered sheets, not knowing if he’d rather walk back into company or into an empty kitchen. He yanked off his button down and stepped out of his trousers, choosing instead to replace them with a comfortable cotton jersey from Hogwarts, that proudly reads
“You chose our rooms?”
Draco let his own hands, slick with lubricant, caress his throat. He imagined it was Harry’s hand there, pressing into his neck, holding him still as he stared deep into his eyes. How that hand, his hand, would feel. If it would be constricting, or the opposite; controlled, strong, possessive.
“Actually, name’s Harry Potter,” Harry said, before giving Draco a small chuckle and flying back towards the ground. Draco watched, stuck in the air, as Potter walked back to the castle, broom in one hand, and his snitch in the other.
Draco clutched at the knot in his silk tie, black stripes with the tiniest glint of silver. Alexsander said it brought out his eyes, and with that thought, Draco opened his own.
At its core, it was similar to learning Potions. A single mistake could destroy a potion, but if brewed correctly, it could help. It could save lives.
Draco felt the urge to flee again, but kept himself rooted to the spot. The safety measures and elements he had learned throughout the week flooded his mind, and he steadied himself in Neville’s steady gaze.
You won't get your knuckles bloody for me
Draco watched with bated breath as Theo positioned himself on the bed, one knee on either side of Neville’s thighs. He watched Theo slowly lower himself down, piercing himself with every thick inch of Neville’s cock, Neville’s hands gripping his waist, keeping him steady and connected and safe.
How Potter would look, chest broad and hair sticking to the nape of his neck as he rode Draco’s own cock, his eyes closed and eyelashes fluttering with a green and black collar knotted around his own neck. How Draco would reach up, and pull Potter down by his collar and kiss him, breathe him in as Potter wriggled on top of him.
“Communication is important, of course, but having some insight into both your partner and yourself will help make your play even more impactful.” Neville glanced across the five students crowded around him. “Let’s try an example, shall we? Consider it a warm up.”
With his own moan, Draco came, spilling his seed as he rutted into his fist. His entire body jerked with his orgasm, flooding his senses with pleasure, but also with realisation.
“Potter,” his Master drawled in his posh voice that always gave Harry chills. Even when they were younger, the way he said Harry’s surname made his cock twitch deliciously.
The room was dark. To Harry, at least. He knew, somewhere in the back of his mind, that the room was dimly lit with flickering candles, but the blindfold across his eyes blocked out any remnant of light.
He heard Potter enter their room, but he pretended to be asleep. Even when Potter “accidentally” lit the torches in their room, Draco didn’t stir. He couldn’t.
Potter shrugged. “Dying wasn’t my favorite part.”
Theo moaned before eagerly nodding, and Draco clenched his own fist around his needy cock. Neville pulled Theo off of the bed and laid down himself, back to the mattress and feet planted firmly to the floor.
Maybe if I hadn’t turned in your stupid Army
Harry couldn’t wait any longer. He grabbed one of Draco’s hands, forcing him to drop a butter knife he was clinging to, and pushed his long fingers against the front of his trousers. He needed Draco to see, to understand just how the thought of him in those stockings affected him.
Below the hanging streamers were what must have been at least a hundred partygoers. Following Neville through the crowd, Draco saw no less than ten heads topped with copper hair and wondered for a brief moment if Gin and Pansy were in attendance. He also noticed Ron, full plate in hand, a sauce-shaped mustache staining his face. His wife, Hermione, was only steps behind, holding hands with their youngest.
“What would you call it, then?” Draco asked.
“No!” Harry yelped. “I didn’t mean...I just meant that he’s a dick is all.”
Theo nodded, his head still hooked to the floor.
Chosen to save us all
“Stand up,” Sir commanded, and Harry snapped open his eyes, still only seeing darkness. He pushed up on his palms, manoeuvered to his feet as quickly as possible, and stood.
“Trust me, you don’t.” Malfoy paused, and Harry was hopeful for a minute that he’d continue. Instead, he just said, “Goodnight, Potter.”
“Pl-please,
Potter let go of Draco’s wrist but didn’t break eye contact while he spoke to his godson. “What’d you see, Teddy?” Harry asked, smiling even wider.
“If it’ll help?”
“It was supposed to be curry,” Ginny said, holding up a burnt pan. “An apology dinner.”
“Nervous about your date?” Pansy asked, taking a sip of her own drink. “Ginny won’t be back for an hour or so, but I can owl her?”
Draco started to panic. He knew he had two choices; either stay like a coward in the shower stall until Potter left, or pull his towel back around his waist and strut out like he hadn’t a care in the world.
Was Potter staring directly at him?
“I said you’re homophobic, Potter. Going around and calling out others based on their sexual preference, on public Wireless no less.”
“I think he’s easy on the eyes,” Pansy shrugged.
. One made his heart ache.
You’ll be made of ashes too
“Thwas thddd yhhh,” Potter mumbled something, but Draco couldn’t hear it over the rain. He leaned in, pressing himself closer. Just to hear better, of course. The rain outside of his shield continued to pelt away, but inside it was dry. Warm.
“No, Sir.” Theo let out, more breathy than Draco was expecting.
“Your throat is so warm, and
“Well it’s not—” Draco started to defend himself, but paused. “Fine, it is Potter, but not for the reasons you think.”
The fingers inside of him sped up, plunging in and out of his tight entrance as they teased him closer and closer to the edge. Harry could only whine, crying out in desperation, hoping he could hold out until he heard
“You don’t do that, you know.”
and find out.”
Draco froze. He recognized that voice, having spent the previous night hearing it over and over in his dreams. However, he was very, very much awake, very close to to the yearning sound, and yet he still couldn’t believe that it was-
Harry blinked, taking a moment to process the question. Wings? Oh. “Just a dream I had, over Christmas.”
“I’m an Angel!” he said, slowly enunciating every syllable.
He was watching a pair of fluffy white wings on the Grimmauld staircase, confusion falling over him like a blanket...
Draco moved to the side catching the spell on the inside of his wing and tossing it towards Sirius on the rebound.
Snape was opposite, his eye twitching from obvious annoyance.
He looked around, wrinkling his nose at the amount of dust collected on the shelves. A moment later Sirius followed him, patting his clothes down to remove soot.
“I hope you know where we are,” Draco said.
By the time he’d dug himself out of the hole of bad thoughts and looked back at his Professor, Snape was pulling strands of silvery stuff from his own head with his wand and putting them into the pensieve. He moved the pensieve out of the way without any explanation and stared at Harry.
Potter, Weasel and Granger, standing like some sort of fucked-up family as McGonagall separated them into their rooms. Not by house, no, but by random selection. Zabini was shoved with Longbottom and Thomas, which Draco knew he would enjoy. He’d been eye-fucking Longbottom’s bottom since they got off the train. Quite the glow-up, he admitted to himself.
“What do you want,” Malfoy asked as he approached Harry at the bar of the Leaky.
“Spanking, flogging, paddles, all marked yellow.”
Except, when he finally opened his eyes, he didn’t feel great. In fact, he felt quite disgusting, bloated, and sore from sleeping all night pressed against the straight back of what used to be his favorite chair. His head was pounding, his window was open, and his peacock, Talulah, was missing from her perch, probably out to get the Saturday issue of the Daily Prophet. As he picked up his glass from the hardwood floor, Draco noticed his fingers were covered in smudged ink; a quick Scorgify removed the black stain as well as cleaned the glass before he Accioed it carefully to the shelf. A shower would do, Draco thought to himself. Yes, a shower would make him right as rain.
“And we’re back to
“Sure you don’t want to play tonight?” Pansy asked, peering over at Ginny like she was the only one in the room.
“I would never!”
slowly.”
“Well,” Malfoy started, “a lot of practice with a very accomplished Quidditch player, and quite a bit of cardio workouts.”
“Doubtful,” Malfoy scoffed. “You have no idea what it’s like to live in the closet, Potter.”
So close to his birthday, tucked behind jumpers and tattered shirts, this was a surprise, and one that already had his heart racing and his cock thickening.
“Clever,” Draco said, glancing from his black and cream parchment to the colour-coded one.
“Ready?”
He’d never seen a Golden Snidget before, outside of
Pansy looked at Draco, and then nodded. “You can just let go.”
Potter shrugged. “McGonagall let Neville and I choose as a reward for putting the castle back together this summer.”
“You’ve been so good for me,” Sir spoke, and Harry’s skin broke out in goosebumps at that sultry voice. “Asking me to punish you.”
The slick slap of Neville burying himself into Theo’s hole filled Draco’s ears as he imagined filling Potter’s hole, ramming himself into that wet heat over and over, being the reason Potter was crying out his name in pleasure.
“Potter?”
“Feel free to return it whenever you like.”
“You do.”
“You wouldn’t even care if it was just my finger, would you?” his Sir teased, pushing one in just to pull it right back out. “You’d be grateful for anything I give you.”
He thought he saw the slightest tilt, the almost nod of Potter’s head, his hair frazzled as if he had already been fucked, as if it had already been gripped and twisted and
He opened his eyes, feeling calmer and more sure of himself than he had in so long. With a steady voice, Draco looked at his parents.
across the back, and an old pair of joggers. The combination would make his father cringe, and he grinned as he walked out of his bedroom.
Longbottom’s owl had appeared only moments after he left the shower, flying in the open window gracefully, it’s talons gripping to the mahogany footboard at the end of Draco’s bed.
Most of the time, he spent his days uninterrupted. He’d hear murmuring outside his door when it was lunchtime, the other apprentices heading out for some crisps and a bap, but Draco stayed. He’d much rather eat while keeping a firm eye on his potions than make awkward conversations with his colleagues.
“I was not staring at Krum’s arse!”
She grinned. “Oh, yes. How sensitive I get, how much I beg and cry for her.” Pansy sat up straight in her chair. “I used to get so embarrassed at the sounds I’d make, but Ginny loves them.”
Potter glared. “Didn’t quit.”
So many had died there.
“Goodnight, Potter.”
Draco paused. “He’s...acceptable at Quidditch.”
This was exactly what he wanted.
Potter grinned, then nodded. Draco gave him a smile before turning and practically running to the nearest Apparition point outside of the zoo.
Harry chuckled. “I’ll consider your apology accepted if you don’t make me eat that.”
“One, Two, Three!”
He whispered something then, and whatever it was had Theo gasping as he stood and turned in between Neville’s thighs. They brought their lips together again as Neville worked off the remainder of Theo’s shirt from his shoulders.
Draco couldn’t remember the last time he woke up with such a need to come, his body working on instinct to bring him the pleasure he seemingly craved. But now that he had, he felt like he could breathe just a bit better, like he was lighter somehow.
“Absolute failure on a broom.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I don’t want to know.”
“Merlin,” Draco sighed in a hard exhale of bated breath.
“No, I— I really have to go. Previous plans.” Draco said through gritted teeth. “Owl me, Potter. If you want,” he added, hopefully. “I’d, uh, love to hear about that train.”
“Couldn’t agree more,” Draco said, throwing back the rest of his drink. “Well, now that precious Potter knows what I like in bed, I’m sure everyone will hear it on your next segment.”
Harry groaned again, something muffled, and Draco let his body tilt into his touch as his hands slid down his chest. His cock was aching to be touched, and instead of Draco’s own palm wrapping itself around his burgeoning erection, he let himself imagine it was Harry’s.
Draco couldn’t pull his eyes away from the pair of them, Neville’s hand moving torturously slowly as he teased Theo. He looked so relaxed, his entire body melting into Neville’s touch, as his hand moved from twisting Theo’s metal collar tight around his neck to cupping his chin softly as they kissed.
“Criticise? I was complimenting you!”
Draco had quickly folded the letter and tucked it deep in his pocket. Even though he lived alone, he cringed at the idea that anyone was to see the scroll. It seemed dirty still, the whole idea of the club, the whole idea of needing something to
Neville also reveals a moment where he was not a great Dom, so keep that in mind.
Her eyes went wide as she redirected her attention to Draco. “Right. So you didn’t see anyone?”
“I - I think I better head out, Pans.” Draco muttered, climbing out of the comfy couch. “Things to do.”
“Gorgeous,” Sir growled as he scraped his fingernails across Harry’s sensitive arse cheeks, sending ripples of sensation and pleasure throughout his entire body. His arse flexed, wanting to buck back into his Master’s touch, but he couldn’t. Harry focused on staying still as Sir continued to caress his heated skin.
Draco didn’t want to count. He wanted to leave, tear up his list, and never look back. But a part of him, the cold underneath the fire, reminded himself of how much he’d already overcome. So he closed his eyes and counted.
“That’s all our time today!” Harry quickly interjected. “Thank you for listening, and until next week, Potter on!”
was easier. The cold brass knob still clutched in his hand, the black button at his collar.
Draco bit his lip. “He invited me back. To the club.”
He pressed his palm into his erection, hoping not only to stave off any impending pleasure, but also to make sure it was reasonably hidden from the others that were joining to watch the show. The last thing he needed was his own inexperience to be exposed in the dim lights.
“Draco,” a voice called in warning from behind him, clipped and short. He immediately ignored it. He wouldn’t let go of this power, this control, not of his own volition. He continued.
If he
“Coward,” Draco practically snarled, stepping closer to Potter until they were chest to chest. They were generally equal in height, but Draco leaned forward onto his toes, giving him just enough height so he could glower down at Potter. “Couldn’t stand me showing you up, being better than you even after all these years.”
“A good time.”
Finally, Neville stepped backwards, removing his fingers from Theo’s entrance and his cock from Theo’s mouth. He wrapped one of his hands around Theo’s metal collar, pulling it taut as his head dropped and his mouth met Theo’s once more.
His hand was instantly filled with a glass of merlot as soon as he walked through the Floo. He settled at the end of Pansy’s lemon-coloured sofa, crossing his ankles below him as he took the first calming sip of wine. It went down easily, way easier than whisky.
“Let’s go,” Draco said, his voice low as if not to carry, even though the bar was so loud he’d have to scream to be heard.
“I bet your mouth would look so pretty wrapped around my cock, Potter,” Draco continued, ignoring Neville’s now audible warnings from across the room. “You talk all day, but you never get to use that throat of yours, do you? Every word you say is for them, but every noise you make is for me, isn’t it?”
Yes, Potter was easy enough on the eyes to elicit weeks of wanking material. He had tried to push it to the back of his mind, the thought of the Chosen One against the wall, or on his blessed knees, his mouth gasping, his throat arched, his cock hard and wanton.
my voice into the mic, and everyone with a Wireless can hear me?” Harry had asked incredulously just three months before. Of course he had a vague idea of how the Wizarding Wireless Network ran, but when Lee had contacted him out of the blue to run his own show, Harry was rightfully confused.
Draco huffed, before inhaling again. Yes, he definitely smelled honey. “So maybe I noticed you earlier.”
bleeding through the pain
“Because I’m fucking freezing?” Pansy spat out before she began to giggle. “I thought it was some sort of warming potion. And besides, you don’t always tie me up,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes.
“Once,” Draco said, the volume of his voice dropping once again into a whisper.
“Welcome back to
“Are you hurt?” his mother asked, and while the question sounded like she was concerned, he instead could feel her eyes scanning his frumpled shirt, his rolled-up sleeves, his tight, black trousers. “Did you really go out in public like that?”
Not as much of a glow-up as Potter, though. The last time Draco had seen Scarhead, he was dirty and thin, his hair matted and his face puffy and destroyed by that horrible hex. Draco could barely recognize him, except for his eyes.
Draco tried holding his breath as well, wondering how Theo was keeping such control as Neville stoppered his air. Just when Draco was growing concerned, and having to release his own breath, Neville pulled out, giving Theo a brief reprieve before delving his cock back into the warm, wet heat of Theo’s mouth.
Potter had died there.
“Does anyone else see them?” Draco asked, suddenly nervous about being judged on his greens, on his reds.
Draco and Harry move forward
, he thought as he focused on his hearing. The buzzing of the vibrator, still cupped in Neville’s hands. Neville’s own breath, heavier than usual. The barest of hums of the temperature charms running through the room.
“Darling, you already know I like to crawl around with a ball gag in my mouth. What’s more personal than that?”
Safeword discussion, as well as past relationships, and a scene involving a dom caning a sub (not any HP characters). Draco has a bit of panic, and a discussion about needs.
That night, he laid back on their bed, anxious to see Draco strut in those damnable fishnets he couldn’t get out of his head, and hopefully nothing else. Well, a black lace thong would also be nice, but he wasn’t going to get his hopes up that much.
If you don't want to read it, I totally understand. It's 100% okay to skip it, you will not miss any of the plot going forward. Take care of yourself first and foremost.
“No.”
Eighth year had started like any other; the train picked them up at Kings Cross at the same platform, all of the students wearing black robes and pushing their carts and carrying their pets. The train wound its way through the mountains and over the rivers and finally made its destination. The castle lit up the sky as the first-years got on boats and the rest of the classes got into their Thestral-drawn carriages.
“Well it wasn’t funny! To say that I was...and he...and I’m not…”
“Down in the old Charms classroom. Come join us.”
What sacrifices were made to win
Especially not once Theo started to rock.
Harry knew the longer he drew out his intro, the angrier his caller would get.
Potter had just asked him on a date, right?
Luckily, Pansy didn’t seem offended. “My
“He outed Malfoy to the entire team?” Harry couldn’t believe it. “Why would he do that?”
His husband’s eyes were still focused on the floor, but Harry could see a faint flush begin to colour his cheeks. It encouraged him to continue. “The lace, the perfect green bow, would rest right at the top of your thigh, so milky white against the black lace, and you’d look so utterly delicious.” He palmed his swollen cock. “I’d take you just like that and throw you onto the bed, kiss every inch of fishnet I could.”
The last thing he expected to read was:
Draco processes what he just saw.
Free.
“I don’t know if it’s as his date, or as a friend, or Teddy’s cousin, or just to torment him on a Sunday afternoon.”
, closing the distance.
On the field, in the classroom
Draco didn’t tell anyone about his run-in with Potter the previous evening. Secrets were like currency in Slytherin House, and Draco wasn’t about to let everyone know how many Galleons he was holding with that one.
Pansy shrugged. “Ever since Fifth, it’s been either parents or Potter. Process of elimination, really.”
“I seem to remember a match during Third Year where I was in a storm AND faced Dementors.” He cracked his knuckles. “Don’t remember you cutting me any slack.”
You wouldn’t even take my hand
How Potter had looked, his hair absolutely destroyed, his eyes glossy, his chest covered in…
“Date?” Pansy asked.
Finally, his Tempus slipped one arm past five, and he was able to hang his dragonhide gloves on the hook for the day. He quickly switched into more casual clothes, a grey jumper and softly pleated trousers before heading across the alley to the Leaky. It had become a bit of a tradition to share a pint with Pansy before she trouped off to her variety of lovers and Draco slunk back to his flat, empty except for his owl and the occasional dust bunny.
“Training your Submissive can be a play in itself.” Neville added. “Just make sure that you’re clear with your objectives. Otherwise, you could end up having to inflict a punishment where you may or may not have wanted to.”
don’t care if all I’m talking about is Quidditch, or what I ate for breakfast?”
“Are you alone, Malfoy?” Harry asked, suddenly finding himself curious who Malfoy might be spending his nights with.
“You’ve got it all wrong, you git,” Potter said, and Draco couldn’t help but look at his face. He had expected bewilderment, or even anger. The smile stretched across his face took Draco completely by surprise.
“More like…guidelines, or boundaries we set together.” Pansy shook her head and took another sip out of her glass. “I’m not explaining this right.”
Honestly, I thought about not posting today. There's just so much going on around the world that an emotional chapter like this just didn't seem helpful. But I reread it, and reminded myself of the tools Neville teaches Draco, and thought maybe someone else could use that reminder this week.
Neville was seated when Draco walked in, and as promised, he was alone. “Prompt as always,” he smiled in greeting. “And looking quite handsome. Sit down. I thought we’d talk before trying anything out tonight.”
“It’s not the Gryffindor thing.”
“I just
on watching his two friends in such private positions, but he couldn’t help it.
He knew he’d see Longbottom, his calming smile and his strong exterior, but who he wasn’t ready to see was-
His Master withdrew his fingers and ran them lightly up and down Harry’s thighs. “Perfect, perfect Potter,” he praised, before casting a Cleansing Charm on his hands.
“So how was the club?” Pansy asked, settling herself on the other end of the couch. The chair next to her was covered in layers of cloth, several sewing needles weaving in and out as they combined different colours of silk to tulle.
“Send Neville my love, will you?” She said with a smile, before Draco drifted through the Floo and back to his own flat.
All of his tensions spilled out of him as Harry cried out in relief, his whole body focused on his Master’s touch, his fingers, his thighs. He felt so safe and adored as he was fulfilled with pleasure.
“A plug that doubles as a vibrator.” Neville stopped the buzzing and placed the tiny sphere back in the box. “This plug, or really an egg, sits right against Theo’s prostate, stimulating him.”
After all, what happened earlier was nothing. Some stupid game that went horribly wrong. He hadn’t meant to look at Potter. It had been an accident.
It wasn’t that Malfoy was bad; in fact, if Harry was being honest, he was a fantastic seeker. Lithe on a broom, incredibly fast, and laser-focused. Last season, he had crushed the competition, and Harry had been delighted to watch him catch the Snitch week after week. But something seemed to be holding him back lately, and it showed in his matches.
“A drink?” Harry said. “Was my owl not clear?”
I'll be posting the last chapter next Monday, the 19th!
Potter laughed. He fucking laughed in the same hallway that his friends had died in.
Want to read another Drarry with Nev giving out Plant Advice? Might I recommend
Neville goes to the club, Draco at his heels. What will they find there?
“He benched you?” Harry shook his head. “But you came so close to catching the Snitch!”
Draco’s cheeks darkened to an almost-crimson when he finally whispered, “Yes.”
“Well, you know what happened, don’t you?” Ron asked, his mouth full of rice.
“No,” Pansy chuckled. “Got Mum to write a note for Hooch during mandatory lessons. But I would imagine, the first few feet off the ground can be scary.”
“Draco, where have you been?” his father bellowed, standing up from his chair. “It’s extremely inconsiderate to be late, especially when you’re the host.” His glare cut into Draco before he could even shut his front door behind him.
“Could’ve used that one when we played Hufflepuff.”
“We fight non-stop on air.”
“That’s it. Class is over.” Neville closed his eyes and cleared his throat. “Draco, my office. Harry, please sit down and wait for me. As for the rest of you, class is dismissed. I’ll owl you with your individual schedules tomorrow.”
“That’s all the time we have, friends. Join me next week, where we’ll be discussing how Malfoy lost against the Holyhead Harpies. Potter on!”
“You tell me, teach,” Draco snarled. His hands were shaking, and his cock was hard, harder than it had been in his previous memories. Harder than he thought he had ever been in his entire life.
When Harry asked Saturday morning if Draco was finished, his boyfriend thought about it and then nodded. They agreed on adding things down the line anyway so it was just a rough draft anyway.
Then he opened it. There was the ticket slip inside and a short sentence on the card they got for Ron:
He struggled with a lot of things in the magical world, but that was the worst. He got the obvious element, thanks to his temper – Fire.
He drank it while he wandered back to the boutique. Diagon Alley was not really bustling with people, but there were a few mingling. It was nice and calm, just like Harry wanted it. A nice young lady was holding up a basket filled with roses. Maybe he should...?
The sun rose even higher and Harry could forget his nagging and screaming wife for a bit. Not for too long though, but long enough.
A white spell rushed past him and hit the table, immediately dosing the flames. Another dark green one hit the table and it vanished. Harry gulped. It seemed that his husband-to-be was home. He turned around slowly, sheepishly smiling.
Harry kissed him on the cheek and grinned, "But now we can make wonderful tea with the hot water. Thank you for that."
Ron nodded, "I swear it will be like that."
Oh god, well, yes indeed. A fucking god!
And with that the woman left the altar room and Draco was all alone. They would now start to sing the songs of the god, chanting and begging him to come down and feast upon their offering. If Draco was rejected, the priestess would skin him for not being able to please the god and drain his blood to feed the altars magic. So either way he would die, most probably.
"I have only a handful of things noted. So yeah. Uhm."
Draco cursed and ran to the sink to let cold water run over it. Harry came from outside – he was with their lovely hen's to collect fresh eggs – and saw the red hand immediately.
Malfoy's face smoothed out and he shook his head, "Anyway, how could you not know that? I am your neighbor." Malfoy pointed at the mansion right next to their significantly smaller house.
He wrote a quick note himself and bottled it up in the same glass bottle he received his note. He promised himself he would throw it in the sea later that day.
He just needed to get Hermione involved since she was too smart for her own good.
Harry and Draco loved to go hike. Well, Harry loved it. Draco just tagged along to not be alone at home. Sometimes they were accompanied by Ron and Hermione but not this time. The couple couldn't get a babysitter for their kids and so the Potter-Malfoy's went out alone.
And yes, Harry was very rewarded that night. And the next as well, when they finished shopping. It was almost worth it in Harry's eyes, almost.
Harry grinned and pocketed the tip. He would give it to Ron and Hermione. Ron would definitely share it with this family. That was a nice way of giving them back what they gave him in all those years. They didn't give him money, but love and acceptance. Even Ron welcomed Draco. Not warmly but for Harry's sake, he welcomed him. Molly even knitted a Christmas sweater for Draco. It was a green one with a cute snake on. Draco wore it almost every day when it was cold outside. It was adorable.
That clumsiness and the pain didn't deter Draco from trying again and again though. He was persistent. That was one of the things Harry loved about Draco. It didn't make it easy though.
Both grimaced at the mention of the slander 'newspaper'. It did not deserve the name newspaper anymore. So many fake 'news' and horrible fantasy novels were written there, it was not even funny anymore. Someone had a field day publishing lie after lie after lie.
But now Harry had a big ass problem. The fire on the table. Yes, another table was going to burn to a crisp. Harry whimpered. Draco loved this table. He freaking loved it so much that he promised to hurt Harry's balls and dick if he dared to scar it.
Hands in the pockets, Harry strolled to the ice-parlor without any worry. It didn't take long and then he held up a wonderful big iced latte with pumpkin spice and treacle tart flavor. It was wonderful. Draco would hate it, but Harry loved it.
"Oh Draco, babe, oh no!" Harry placed the wicker basket to the side and rushed to his boyfriend. He pulled out his wand and murmured the spell, "Episkey."
Harry sighed. He had a lot of trouble coming his way. Couldn't his life be quiet for like a decade or so?
Harry whirled around; the shells fell back into the sand as the man looked at his old school-nemesis.
Draco was clumsy and sometimes forgetful. Not at potions making, not at dueling and not when he was treating a patient. But he was so clumsy when it came to household chores and especially cooking. Harry couldn't count the cute, blisters and small burns he treated when his sweet boyfriend came to him, holding out his hands.

"Draco, that makes no sense. Just say it and then we can talk about mine."
Neat, it was, tidy it was, but homely? It was not.
And a lot more. Those were just the top six. They were making a bucket list. Why? Because they wanted to. To visualize what they wanted to do before they turned forty. It was a simple thing helping them to see what would follow down the road.
The man was visible confused until he looked at the slip of Gringrotts. Harry and Draco (with the big help of Hermione of course) already transferred the money into Ron's and Hermione's joint vaults.
They went in the cave and Draco pulled his wand almost immediately to make some light
Draco smiled and spread his legs, showing off how little he wore underneath. Indeed, it would not be a night of abstinence again.
The black haired man scoffed. He only raided the Malfoy Manor over ten times personally because he had no, not because he wanted to. The first few times, the Malfoys were enraged, trying to resist, but after the fifth time, they simply opened the door and went back to their tea room.
Draco wore. The demon quite liked it. The lace, the soft look, hm, he had to get his pet more than just the one. It would not survive the night.
They ventured further, deeper into the cave. Draco was busy playing with the mushrooms while Harry looked around. At one side there was a softly shimmering wall. He knew what that meant. It was an illusion.
Draco was going to die on that marble table and nothing would happen. The god was thirsty for blood and one sacrifice would not be enough.
But alas, when he opened the door, it was still dark inside. No crowd waiting for him, shouting "SURPRISE!" nothing. Well, that was strange. The shoes of his boyfriend were missing so he was not home yet.
The smell was pine-y, mossy, clear and so uniquely 'forest'. Harry loved the smell! Draco as not the biggest fan of it but he endured. Birds were flying around them, high up in the trees, and Harry whistled a matching tune to the birds which answered.
That was apparently not the case.
"I hear only 'yes'. I promise to be good for you tonight."
The chanting now could be heard inside the temple as well. He never knew the woman could be so loud and... UAGH! Something touched his naked leg! Draco whipped his head around but remembered he couldn't see a thing. Except the calloused warm hand on his body. Oh god was that the god or was it some disgusting filth that hid in the inner heart of the temple?
Filling the sieve with freshly ground coffee, screwing the upper part on and pouring the hot boiling water on top. The rest did the dripper itself. But somehow, somehow his lovely boyfriend got the hot water all over himself! Well, his left hand to be specific.
Being together for five years didn't sound long for some people. But they knew each other for over twenty years now.
playing at?
They were preparing breakfast together and Draco wanted to make coffee for the afternoon – their favorite cold brew coffee. They had a drip-coffee maker, which was very easy to use.
When he reached the bedroom he sighed before opening it. But against all odds, it was empty as well. Draco looked around and then he saw it. A single red rose on the nightstand with a letter in front of it. Harry did give him more than a 'happy birthday' and a kiss!
Draco pushed open the door of their cute little house and was overwhelmed with the scent of rose. Stunned, he looked around and saw the entrance hall covered in deep red roses. He went further in and their living room, dining room, kitchen and everything else was covered in an abundance of big rose bouquets. What...?
He took a deep breath while both of his friends looked expectantly and frightened at him. Well, it wasn't wrong of them to assume the worst; Harry knew it. So he took another deep breath.
Harry pressed a kiss on Draco's cheek, ignoring the murmur "Stop that you whore, I will bite you!", and slapped Draco on the butt, "Come on, let's go inside. I want my lovely lover on the lovely sheet, making lovely love."
The rippling of the sea, the cawing of the seagulls and the foamy, coldish water on his naked feet immediately calmed Harry down. The crunching of the sand underneath his feet as he strolled along the beach was in such a stark contrast to the screaming at home. His wife Ginny – wife, not mate – was getting more and more aggressive the more years rolled by. Thankfully they didn't have any children as of yet.
Yes, Draco was clumsy. Yes, Draco forgot sometimes the simplest thing. But Harry still loved him to the moon and back. Nothing would ever change that.
"SURPRISE, Happy birthday," the whole lot screamed. Draco laughed and kissed Harry. What a surprise!
He got more and more disgruntled as he opened box after box and found another box inside which got smaller and smaller. Until he reached the last box, opened it and saw an envelope in it.

So he put one knee on the bed and looked up and down at the delicious treat.
Harry had never seen his friend like that but then again, his friend didn't get 20 million pounds, or over 4 million Galleons, as a gift every day. When they left, Harry still had the tear stains on his shirt.
Draco was instantly bored. He tried the potion a week before when his beloved was not in his house, so he knew it didn't hurt him nor had any side effects shown up. So he was safe. Now was the time to use it!
Yes, a teeny tiny part of him wanted to stay that powerful but the really damning thing was that Draco more or less fell in love with the demon.
It took them roughly three days to finish it. They worked on it on-and-off, between work and relaxing.
"Oh, that. Yeah, well. I have no clue. How much is it in Galleons anyway?"
So... what should they do with the money? They didn't need it! Harry sighed and looked at his husband. They had everything they wanted. An just putting it in their vaults was stupid, right?
“The club?” Harry said, looking confused in the warm sunlight. “You mean Sugarquill?”
“Did I mention the bottle was charmed?” Pansy added. “It only lands where you want it to.”
In a blink, Harry transformed Draco’s pristine trousers into an almost too-short pleated black skirt, complete with green hem. All at once, the stockings that he had admired for so long were finally on display.
Neville and Draco chat at a bar like two new friends
Authors notes: We really delve into Draco's anxiety in this chapter. Advanced warning of a pretty bad anxiety attack, so please only read if you're in the right headspace. It gets better by the end, because Neville is...Neville.
“If you do, make sure to go see—”
“That’s a good boy,” Neville moaned as he lifted his hips and fucked into Theo’s entrance. “I’ll take care of your hole, baby.”
Draco thought back to the night before, to the room through the looking glass. “I wouldn’t call a fully strapped Dominant beating the shit out of some redhead no one.”
Neville continued to show Draco multiple ways to safeword if someone couldn’t be vocal; whether they were gagged, or under a speech restriction, or any other element that might hinder sound, a secondary hand motion or signal could be exhibited to end the scene.
“Right,” Draco said, before narrowing his eyes at Harry. “Okay?”
Choosing the stall directly next to Potter had happened almost instinctively. Sharing a corridor with all of the eighth years had seemed torturous, but at least each previous house still had their own rooms. He didn’t have to bunk with a Hufflepuff, or gods forbid, a Gryffindor, but they still all shared the bank of showers, the cubbies of loos. He’d seen his fair share of fellow students barely clad in nothing but a towel and house slippers, but whenever Zacharias Smith or Ernie MacMillan were in the bathroom, Draco was able to steer clear.
On a side note, OMG I was so tickled to see the reaction from everyone on the last chap! I thought I put SO MANY SPOILERS in there about it, and to see everyone so surprised was AMAZING!!! Thank you ALL for reading along, your comments get me through the week, and I really appreciate your patience while I post these last few chaps. They're all written, so it should be a smooth posting going forward, every two weeks on Monday.
His smile immediately left his face, when he noticed the dining room was empty, cold and dark. Both of his parents were gone, disappearing as quickly as a flicker of fire in his Floo.
“No one does, darling. Except maybe Granger.”
Neville smiled. “I like to give Theo time to acclimate. Get into the right headspace.”
Draco watched, wide-eyed, as Neville’s cock filled Theo’s open, hungry mouth. His fingers dug into the soft skin of Theo’s forearms when he leaned forward, pushing himself farther and farther down Theo’s throat. At first he thought the motion was to hold Theo immobile while he was forced to take it, but then Draco noticed Theo’s hands.
“Quite the opposite, actually. I was train—”
If I’m on fire
“And Bondage.” Neville smiled softly. “I’m glad to see that one. I think it will help you to know when someone can or cannot touch you.”
Draco watches what Harry has learned.
Draco followed Ginny and Pansy down the hall, until they turned left towards the front desk. Definitely not wanting to see their playtime, Draco turned in the opposite direction and found himself in front of a clear glass wall etched with a two.
“Fuck,” Harry gasped when a slicked finger teased his entrance. His body quivered as the tension of holding his body and the anticipation of his release overcame him, until all he could focus on was that touch against his need, his desperation making him whine.
“Punished?” Pansy asked, staring at the ceiling in thought. “More times than I would like.”
“Look at you,” Neville said, taking his time to admire Theo’s newly revealed skin. His lips dropped down to Theo’s chest, mouthing at each of his nipples, his hands grabbing at his waist. He lowered Theo’s pants just barely below his arse, exposing each cheek nicely to the clear glass wall.
Draco and Harry attempt to scene.
“Thought we were playing? Gods, it’s been so long since I’ve played.”
Harry rolled his eyes before Vanishing the platter straight to the fridge. “I’d rather he tell me himself.”
Draco fought his instinctual urge to blush. “I did,” he answered curtly.
Before he could overanalyze the situation, Potter was cradling Dracos neck with one hand and caressing Draco’s cheek with the other. Their lips touched, soft and tentative at first, and then harder, passionate.
Draco’s eyes snapped open and they flitted over to the closest window. There, a large barn owl hovered, peering through the frosted glass.
Draco didn’t know if he could read anymore. The pathetic drolling of Drunk Draco was too much for him to relive. However, the letter dreadfully continued.
War changes all of us, I suppose
“What would make you happy?”
Draco had spent a lifetime convincing himself: That he was better than everyone; that his family was royalty; that he could defeat whomever he wanted and bully whomever he wanted and that he would get married to a woman and have children that were better than everyone else, and that he definitely wasn’t…
instead of Master or Neville, and he confessed his urge to call me Daddy quickly into our relationship. So we added it to the list of preferred pronouns.” Neville looked down and ruffled a hand through Theo’s dark hair, tugging slightly on the ends when he released the strands.
“I think that’s why I kept it so long,” Potter responded, disregarding Draco’s plea. “It was like holding onto a part of you.” He pushed off of the corner of Draco’s bed and headed to his trunk. Draco recognized his wand instantly, taking a moment to acknowledge how well it had been taken care of. His hawthorn wand was polished to a state where it looked practically new.
Draco couldn’t help but feel surprised as he took his aunt’s hand for the first time in his life. She was so warm and welcoming, so different from Aunt Bella and even his mother. His mother, who he apparently looked like. He’d always been compared to his father, from the colour of his slicked-back hair to the steely arch of his eyebrows, all the way down to the sharp angle of his nose.
“We could go get dinner?” Potter suggested with a shrug.
Neville nodded. “You will review your Submissive’s whenever you play. It’s imperative we adhere to each other’s RACK, or risk-aware consensual kink. For instance,” he continued, magically sticking the checklist to the wall and expanding it so it was easier to read, “you have watersports as a hard limit. Therefore, even if your Submissive enjoyed that element of play, it wouldn’t be incorporated into a scene with you.”
“My dear Draco!” she called, extending her hands out in his direction. “Neville owled to say you might be popping by, but I didn’t want to get my hopes up.” Her eyes watered as she looked Draco up and down. “So tall! And so handsome. My, you look just like Narcissa.”
“You’ve said it yourself on your little wireless show,” Malfoy spat through the phone. “I’ve been distracted.”
“How dare you criticise that dive! You’d never have the balls to do it!”
Suddenly, he heard the tap turn off, and quickly packed all of the clothing back into the drawer, slamming it shut as soon as Draco entered the room.
“No.” Harry paused, putting down his fork.
It felt like the first time he held a wand, his wand.
He saw something flicker across Draco’s face before the stone mask that he so often wore at work and around the Ministry took over. “I-” Draco started, before busying himself with more silverware. “I do not know what you are talking about, Harry. It’s nowhere near Christmas.”
Harry closed his eyes and took in a deep breath, trying to calm the pounding of his heart in his chest. He was not going to let himself get confused; he was not going to easily drop this. He needed this too much. “You...you know what stockings I’m talking about, Draco.”
. Like he was buzzing. It was similar and yet so different to how it was when his magic spilled wild, when he broke the china, or ruined the furniture. Instead, it was as if he buzzed under his skin, contained, controlled.
Malfoy nodded. “Talking about plants while I’ve got you in my mouth, down my throat, my tongue-”
Draco paid Alexsander for the plush clothing, promising to give Pansy a glowing review on his behalf, and made his way through the bricks and back into Diagon with minutes to spare.
“Thank me for spanking you, Potter,” his Master ordered. “You may speak.”
“Oh, perfect timing, love.” Neville grinned widely. “Everyone, this is my partner, Theodore Nott. He’s going to be helping me with today’s lesson.”
EVERYTHING GETS MORE FUN AFTER THIS I PROMISE, but sometimes we need these downs to build ourselves back up!
Taking his time in the shower, Draco tried to wash the previous night off of his skin. The dirt of the club, but also what he saw, the filth, the depravity. He scrubbed his scalp harder than he ever remembered before, filling the bathroom with smells of lavender and orange, but even his favourite scents didn’t calm his nerves.
“Take care of my hole,” Theo moaned, and Draco tried to imagine what Potter might say. Would he beg for Draco to go harder, or faster?  Would he whine so beautifully as Draco teased his slit? Would he thrust his own cock into Draco’s lubed palm as Draco pounded into him over and over and over again?
You weren’t the man I remembered
“Could we not do this here?” Potter said, making a motion to follow the disappearing crowd and head indoors. Quickly, Draco grabbed his wrist, holding him still.
Draco had never been kissed like that. His kisses with Pansy were always quick and satisfactory, but never…
“Why are they helpful?” the girl in the middle asked, her voice high-pitched and a bit jarring on Draco’s ears.
With the cabinet? The locket? The book?
“Not the roast, them!” Harry repeated, his eyes wide. He was sure he looked crazy.
“If I’d like them?” Harry asked with such surprise. How could he not?
He could barely crawl out of bed in the morning, and when he went to take a shower, he found every single one except the last stall occupied. He slid the curtain back, focusing on releasing his robes when he discovered he was indeed wrong. As his robe dropped, his gaze rose until it met with one Harry James Potter, glistening wet and as stark as the day he was born.
“What?” Ron said, swallowing hard. “Aren’t you into some weird stuff too?”
Dom Draco/Sub Harry (angry sex):
“But once you’re in the air, it’s like—”
Draco tried to think of the last time he even saw Potter. It wasn’t at school, but it wasn’t long after. A glance down an alley after attending some ridiculous soiree his mother had dragged him to, a last minute effort to salvage the Malfoy name. That glance had provided more of Potter than he had even seen before Seventh, his throat tilted upward, exposed in the pale moonlight. That same luminescence had trickled down Potter’s chest, revealing the piece of Potter even the paper hadn’t uncovered.
“You’re right. I didn’t. But he knew my mother.”
Pansy reached out and put her hand on his thigh, giving it a squeeze. “Hey,” she said softly. “It’s you and me. What’s going on?”
He half-expected his heart to race, his magic to flair. He closed his eyes, anticipating that he’d have to start counting down. The sound of his shoes, angrily tapping on the hardwood floor. A door slamming shut in the next flat over. Tap, tap, tap of an owl’s beak against his window.
“No, Sir.” Harry bent his fingers, wishing he had something to clutch against the hard concrete.
“You’re a pureblood. A Parkinson. And you more than casually visit a sex dungeon.” He didn't want to sound judgemental, but he was having trouble wrapping his head around the whole thing. Taking control, giving control, possibly having sex, it was all too confusing. Draco lived in a world of certainty. The exact ingredients, the perfect temperature, always lead to the same results. No power play, only facts.
“Why?”
“Doesn’t have to be, we could just go as—as fri—”
Draco dreamed that night of playing Quidditch; flying high above the Hogwarts grounds, chasing the Snitch, chasing Potter. How happy he felt, soaring through the clouds, Potter’s laugh as warm as the sunlight on his back as they played.
Sir,” Harry begged, hoping his Master could hear the desperation in his voice, how close he was to coming. How much he needed his release. His eyes were wide open behind his blindfold, and Harry itched to see anything, the grey concrete, the black of his Master’s shoe, the golden buckle of his belt where it was cast to the floor.
“Did I give you permission to move?”
He ventured down and entered the room just as Pansy was making her grand announcement.
But he couldn’t do any of that. Not just because they were in public, at a children’s zoo where his cousin was who knows where, but because Potter didn’t want that. He had left the club. He had left the lifestyle that Draco found to be his anchor.
(See the end of the chapter for
“...Dear Teddddyyyyyyy…”
He quickly found a spot between Zabini and Thomas, smirking when he realized Zabini was positioned directly across from his roommate, Longbottom. And right next to him…
“The other day at the, erm, club...you said the second task, the lake, was the first time you noticed me. During Fourth.”
He knew he could pull his curtains closed, send up some privacy charms and pull at his length to relieve the pressure. He’d surely come in an instant, his mind still full and his hand steady. Instead, he gathered his towel and pressed it against his morning hard-on before marching to the showers.
, properly. Never dad, and certainly not daddy. Yet, when he uttered the word, instead of tightening as Draco surely would have done, Theo seemed to relax further into the floor, his fingers splayed across his skin in an easy fashion.
Only Pansy, Zabini and Draco remained, taking up half the space in a tiny train cart.
“Or I can take a hint,” Neville laughed. “Besides, I have my boy waiting for me.” He stood, and as he was passing Draco, he placed a solid hand on his shoulder. “We’re playing in room two. Glass wall if you want to take a peek.” He gave Draco a wink. “Could be helpful, if you’re curious.”
He Vanished his own clothes, along with Draco’s shirt and tie, and fell to his knees. “You’re the prettiest man I’ve ever been lucky enough to fall in love with,” Harry said, before pulling the lace thong to the side and thrusting his tongue into Draco’s needy hole.
Draco groaned and finally sat up. “What do you want?” he asked, wincing at his voice. He was hoping to come off dismissive, but instead it came across as, ugh, curious. As if he actually cared.
“Good boy.”
“What the fuck was that, Potter? Implying that I’m gay? That I’m throwing the match to stare at some coach’s arse?”
“Yes, but…” His own eyes got wide as he tilted his head toward Neville. “We can talk about it later.”
“Pain, maybe, but it’s not the same as a cut or a bruise. It makes everything more sensitive; your body focuses on that one source.”
Hello! So this chapter is v. dark and can be quite triggering. Please protect yourself first and foremost. I'm going to put the triggers in the end notes so you don't have to read if you don't want to. The next chap will have a brief summary of this one, so if you don't want to read it, I'll catch you up next time so you can keep reading along!
“And Ginny likes it?”
“I understand,” Harry gulped.
Pansy simply smiled, mostly to herself as she had another sip of wine. “Ask Longbottom.”
Whew, we made it to the end of this journey! As of today, this is a completed fic, but it is nowhere near the end of these boys future. I have lots more planned, and I hope you stay tuned!
He countered his mother’s grimace with a smile. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to change before eating. If you’re still here when I get back, I’ll take that as your decision.”
“I don’t see why that’s necessary.”
She looked so much like Aunt Bella that Draco would have sworn he saw a ghost. As he weaved his way through the masses of people, however, he started to notice the differences: her hair was lighter, more brown than black, her curls loose rather than tight and springy. It was her face where Draco noticed it most of all. Her curious brown eyes were so strikingly different from the horrid black scowl he was used to seeing. As soon as they connected with Draco, her entire face lit up, a smile spreading from cheek to cheek.
“Knowing my Theo Bear’s background allows me to understand him better,” Neville continued, giving Theo’s shoulder another squeeze. “For instance, I do not punish my boy in the traditional BDSM sense. Instead, we talk about his naughty behaviour, which leads to better communication between the two of us.”
“And run the risk of making a fool of himself?”
“Yes.”
“Know him well?” Draco asked as they started wandering around the grounds. He wished he didn’t sound so damn curious about his own cousin, but he couldn’t help it. This was a side of his family he had never known, a side of the family that had somehow escaped the hard path of being a Pure-Blood.
“Neville’s what?”
“Oh god, Malfoy.”
Quidditch was something he was always good at. Not great, but good enough to make his father proud. He knew the Eighth Years wouldn’t have a Quidditch team, but that didn’t stop him from sending off a golden snitch and scouring the field for its tiny wings.
“But you know that I’m here to take care of you.”
“It wasn’t great,” Harry shrugged. “As awful as he was to us in school, he doesn’t deserve to be yanked out of the closet.”
You didn’t hesitate
Draco nodded numbly, glancing down at their joined hands. “I’m sure she sends her best, Aunt Andromeda.”
He certainly wasn’t trying to imagine how all of that spunk got there in the first place. Whether Potter had wanked himself raw, coating his chest multiple times with his own pleasure. Or whether it was someone else’s, holding him still as they painted his muscled chest with their own seed.
“What the fuck was that?” Neville gasped as soon as he led Draco into his office. He slammed the door the second Draco stepped over the threshold, blocking out the bland hallway and locking them into the cedar-walled room.
echoed in Draco’s memory.
“Sometimes,” Pansy nodded. “At the beginning, or if I broke one of our rules.”
And it landed on Draco.
And it still was fine. Great, of course it was great. Didn’t matter that he hadn’t seen Potter since the day that he died, only to find the git sitting perfectly fine and content and very much alive. A little older, yes, glasses still broken in the middle (he knew he was the most powerful fucking wizard around, didn’t he?), just casually talking to a
of all people as if he didn’t care who saw him. As if he didn’t care if Draco saw him.
Draco and Harry wake up in the same bed.
“Like heaven,” Pansy grinned. “Sometimes, like hell, too, but it’s what I crave. It’s what I need, and after, when Ginny’s holding me...” she trailed off with a soft smile. “I’ve never felt so safe.”
“And what would that be?” Draco asked, raising his eyebrows as Teddy scurried away after Luna and Rolf.
. Potter here, how are you pottering on today?”
“I noticed you. Just... not... not like that.”
Draco decided to take a chance. “If they all knew how eager you were to get on your knees.”
“Ungghh,” Harry moaned, fully aware that he was panting, his palms slick with sweat as he held his contorted body at his Master’s mercy. Sir inserted another finger, and Harry keened, no longer able to stop his hips from rutting against the silk trousers of Sir’s thigh.
and their latest hit,
The door burst open and Lee walked in, shielding his eyes.
“If you caught the match between the Appleby Arrows and the Chudley Cannons, you know we were all gifted with yet another fumble by Arrows seeker, Draco Malfoy! Yes, once again, Malfoy failed to catch the Snitch, even though it was less than a foot from his own face.”
“Your magic is pulsing faster than your heart, Draco.”
It was then that Draco realised the room was not just filled with Potter. There were three other people gathered in an awkward semi-circle around Longbottom. He didn’t know the other gentleman - he was older, with bits of grey sprinkled into his dark beard - but Draco vaguely recognized one of the women to his left. Abbott, he thought, although he couldn’t quite place her first name. Anna or Helen or something like that. He had no idea who the last student was, nor did he care, because he definitely recognized the new person that just walked in.
Draco reminded himself. He was still having a bit of trouble wrapping his head around cardigan-wearing, plant loving Neville Longbottom in leather chaps.
“If one were to invite someone else out to a children’s outing with animals and other atrocities, could that be construed as a…”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“I don’t want to think about it.”
“Is that—” he started, but his words stuck in his throat. They were all of a sudden close, so close that instead of the smell of walnut and grass, Draco could only smell honey, could only smell Potter. If Potter just turned his head, only slightly, they’d be face to face, close enough that Draco could just lean a bit more and—
“You’ve got me so hard,” Theo moaned as Neville leaned forward and playfully bit on his lip. Neville only hummed in response as he dragged his tongue downward, mouthing at Theo’s throat, before latching on to the drop of his ear.
“What if I’m already hard?” Harry shifted in his seat, pressing his hips up so that Malfoy could feel just what his words were doing to him.
She shrugged and then downed her drink. Pansy Accioed over the bottle before answering. “It depends. There’s always a motive behind it.” After pouring herself another glass, Pansy offered the bottle to Draco.
“Sounds great.”
“I thought you were going to be there.”
“Similar to your fight or flight instincts,” Draco added. He had read about how serotonin and epinephrine were often produced during scenes.
“You’re so good at taking it, my baby bear.” Neville praised as his fingers continued to open Theo up. The position looked uncomfortable, but Theo still seemed so relaxed, as if the opportunity to have Neville’s cock down his throat was more pleasurable than air itself.
“Yes, you oaf.” Draco’s eyes had found their way to the floor again. “I didn’t- I wasn’t sure if-”
He loved his employment and had tirelessly worked his way through his apprenticeship. Draco was still on the bottom rung of the brewmasters, destined to stir and slice, chop and divy, until he had so many mending charms on his fingerprints that his skin sparked against the sharp, silver-tipped knife.
“Good boy,” Neville said, and Draco watched with anticipation as once again Theo shuddered at those words. “Now, Theo is my Submissive. He is also my boyfriend, my partner, and has graciously volunteered to show the class how good of a Submissive he can be.”
I will say, that 25 chaps is a lot to write, but is not simply long enough for me. That being said, I went ahead and created a Series for this, so if you want to find out this groups next round of adventures, please subscribe to the Series (or if you're feeling frisky, to me as an author!)
Well, that was something he was absolutely positive he’d never heard Theo say, especially out loud. They both referred to their parents as
Draco doesn't want to be a virgin anymore.
“Precious Potter and his precious show, I don’t give a fuck. You come on week after week and -”
“Gross.” Draco frowned.
There were perks to running his own Wireless show, after all. And one of those perks was messing with his old nemesis.
Pansy wiped a tear away from her eye and took a deep breath. “When we’re at the club though, when I’m with Ginny, she takes all that pressure from me. She takes it off my shoulders. All of it.”
Not that there were that many left. Three from Slytherin, no more than five from Hufflepuff. At least thirteen from Ravenclaw; they would return to school no matter how many years they added on. And, of course, five from Gryffindor.
It was barely noticeable, but Harry was sure he saw a smile before Malfoy said, “Goodnight Potter.”
He heard his Master folding his belt in half before he felt the lush leather rubbing across his sensitive backside.
“Not everything is about Potter, Pansy.”
Your eyes so fierce and dark
“Well, who knew I could spend 40 minutes talking about Neville and his Venomous Tentacula—which is quite large I might add—so now a quick word from our sponsors.
- maybe exerting oneself? I mean Harry already came that night (from another dom) and now he's playing again? Boy needs some better aftercare!
he exhaled and listened. The wind blowing against the door, his mother’s heel as she tapped her foot, the whir of his refrigerator.
. It made something in Draco pulse with need, the urge to push Potter to the ground throbbing beneath his skin.
Draco and Harry hang out at the zoo.
“You won’t find them,” Draco said, his voice stern, his arms crossed.
He winced, not surprised to see that the phone light was already blinking.
six inches of meat have never been so satisfying.” Harry closed his eyes and concentrated on not laughing. Damnit, Lee; he had to be doing this to him on purpose.
The fair haired man took a shower and stood in the bathroom, naked as the day he was born, the flacon in hand and staring at it. Would his beloved even react to it? Well, that was a good question since his beloved was not a human.
You are making (filtered) coffee for you and your boyfriend. Somehow, you manage to spill it everywhere and burn yourself on your left hand
Words: 434
Also it was super romantic. Maybe Harry could pop the big question now? Yes, they were already married, but Harry wanted a child. Maybe that way he could ask for it? Sadly, Draco blocked that so far. But maybe being in a super romantic setting he would cave or at least listen? Harry had hope.
"My firstborn?"
Harry just laughed and kicked open the bedroom. It was time for some adult lewd fun now!
Draco shook his head. He told a lot of stupid things but that was really the worst. If the demon left him, his magical abilities would return to their original state – not the tenfold it was now. Before he could worry too much, a cold shiver ran down his back and Draco knew this instant that his lover was with him. Hastily he draped himself on the bed. The thought about him begging for sex like a common whore was instantly crushed. He did that for power!
"Indeed you are. Indeed."
The blond man rolled his eyes and brushed the grabby hands off of him; he was annoyed and did not want anything from that heathen now! Harry and his lovely, but whorish, butt should simmer in hell!
Once you turn twenty-one, you get another thing added from the magic around you: Element power. At seventeen you are an adult and at twenty-one you get your main element.
Harry sat on the recliner as Draco stood in front of the big whiteboard. That way they could make the list and erase it easily. Draco had a nicely leather bound book in his hand and stared at his list. Thankfully he was not as expressionless as in the beginning. Still, he was far away from wearing his emotions on his face. But Draco tried and Harry appreciated it.
Draco prided himself to not just take the bottle and bathe in the extremely expensive potion for the maximum effect and put on the sheer babydoll nightgown he purchased for this exact moment. The hallway was silent as was the other rooms but that was nothing out of the ordinary. Harry moved quickly and silently.
The plan was hatched and now he needed to get to work!
Words: 1612
Ron gulped. Was that why Harry rejected Ginny? Because he knew he would die young? Because being mid-thirty was not old per se.
Draco was not happy at all, his face said it all.
Then his boyfriend blinked again and furrowed his brows while looking at Harry, "Who are you?"
Instead, he sighed again and reached out to grab it. Harry got him the rose so maybe it was not the fancy party he imagined but it was at least a token of Harry's love.
The magician opened the door to the bedroom and strolled towards the bed where he laid down suggestively. Now it was time to wait. And Draco hated waiting with passion!
The redness slowly faded and the swelling was reduced. Harry murmured a couple more times and gently healed Draco.
The worst of all, if they didn't know what ailed Harry, they couldn't help. But for now the pesky healers were gone and left Harry in a sterile, uncomfortable environment. At least Ron was there to help him. Well, as best as he could which was not a lot.
Their friend shook his head, "I am sorry. I only know I will die within this week. Can you both do me a favor? Please just put me in the grave next to my parents. Nothing fancy, only you and your family - the Weasleys. I don't want to have a big funeral."
Draco gulped. That was not going according to plan. Well, nothing really went ever according to plan. But the sad truth was that he needed the demon to accomplish everything he was sent out to do. He couldn't say no; he didn't have the luxury. And so he nodded and hoped it wouldn't hurt so much.
"If you sigh like that, one would never think you are happy, Potter."
"Not interesting. Oh no, I don't devour babies. Too sickly sweet," the shadow crept closer, wisps of the ice cold shadow flicked over the body bound and presented in front of him, "What else can you trade?"
"I got it today, after we met. I swear it's a coincidence. I didn't fake it. I didn't even know you were in the same blood bank and..." Draco stopped blabbling when the alpha held up his hand.
A knock was heard on the door and it was opened. A bushy head was stuck in and his wife, Hermione, slipped inside. She was also very worried. She took a stand on the other side of the bed and took Harry's other hand. The man was sleeping now thanks to all the potions the healers told him to drink.
Harry slowly crawled up, following the long legs with his eyes, hands and then with his mouth. And the human couldn't believe the potion actually worked!
"What do you mean?"
It was amazing, cool, absolutely awesome and Harry simply hated it.
Ron choked on his spit while Hermione had tears in her eyes. They assumed the worst but this was even worse. She hiccupped and wiped over her eyes but now tears were rolling over her cheeks, "Why," she whispered. Why didn't Harry tell them this?
To his utter surprise, Ginny was nowhere to be seen. She was probably tired of waiting for him and had gone out by herself. It suited him just fine.
"Oh? How so?"
Around noon a knock was on his door. Ginny was still not home and he doubted she would come before it was dark. She loved to drag him to go shopping after breakfast, have lunch in an expensive restaurant and then shop some more before going to dinner in a very high class restaurant again. Now he was all by himself and Harry noticed he didn't even mind one bit. He was getting up from the couch he was lazing on and opened the door. To his surprise it was Draco. What did the omega want?
Like his boyfriend, who was wandering right next to him. If someone told him ten years ago that he would willingly hold hands with a former Death Eater and even do more than that... Harry wouldn't have believed him. If someone told it was
Well, that was a surprise for Harry. He had a lot more on his own list. Did Draco have no other goals than three? That was curious to him. Draco never held back from speaking his mind.
That let his husbands head turn around and he perked up, "Maybe I find the flowering pink dotted redhead mushroom in there! Wonderful thinking Harry, let's go!"
The boyfriend (could someone call him that?) in question was out and about, doing god-knows-what, and living pretty abstinent the last few weeks. Which irritated Draco to the max. He wanted to have his night filled with moaning and groaning, blinding light exploding behind his eyelids, filled with passion and the lewd sound of skin slapping against skin and not a chaste kiss on the forehead and an empty bed when he woke up. But this would change tonight!
Draco fiddled with his page, took a deep breath and looked up at Harry again.
20 fucking Million fucking pounds.
Note: not a continuation of another prompt!
) and the couple left the cute boutique.
He lifted his gaze to meet Draco's nervous one.
Harry ran o Draco and hugged him, "Happy birthday love."
After the war - where the coven 'sacrificed' Draco to a demon to gain more power to eradicate the enemies – was over, the magicians returned to his house in the woods to peacefully life on. With his demon hubby of course since the contract was 'power in exchange for the body'. And while Draco thought he would die the first time they were together, everything worked out pretty well.
Draco was.
"Uhm... no?"
"M-my soul?"
Needlessly to say, Harry slept on the couch for three weeks but could keep his precious family jewels. But he had to buy another table, a very, very expensive table. It was worth it though.
His friends, family and all others were standing in a bunch, holding up a sign
They bought the ticket on Friday when they were drunk from too much butterbeer and firewhiskey in the leaky cauldron. They were on their way home to celebrate Draco's promotion privately (meaning: lots of fucking like rabbits) and they thought it was funny if they tried out that lotto thing. Not that either of them needed to money. Harry got his parents funds which were immense, and Draco got his own fortune to live off. Also they made a pretty penny with Harry being a teacher at Hogwarts and Draco was now the head of the Slytherin house.
Draco was not an easy person to be around. He knew that. But he prided himself in being very organized and structural. He was affectionate to Harry – or so he told himself – and he was very generous with his
Harry smiled and knocked against the stone. It easily gave way. He turned his head to Draco and smirked, "Are you ready for an adventure?"
Harry nodded, happy not to have a stinging hex on his back, and together they continued Harry's leisurely stroll. They talked about nothing and everything, but mostly they were silent.
Draco was clad in a scandalous outfit to appeal to the god. It was a see-through peplos for women and more of a nothing than an actual article of clothing. It was seemingly tradition to clad the 'offer' in nothing apparently. Draco grit his teeth as he stared daggers at the woman of the temple who was bowing to him. They accompanied him through the village for the people to say their thanks and goodbyes at the same time.
To his utter surprise the couple turned around and walked the few steps and was out of his sight. And how - fucking - dare was Harry?! To have a mistress just because he was occupied with some really life-changing decisions if Lily was better dressed in purple or dark pink? How dare Harry! The fair haired man huffed again, this time he even stepped back so the clerk also noticed something was wrong. Before he could make his way angrily out of the store, his
It only took him five brisk steps to reach the scarheaded git. “Didn’t think you were a quitter,” he snarled. He had to scream the last word over the crowd of singers.
Draco stared into green, letting his mind fill with the memory of the last time he saw those eyes, fluttering with pleasure in the back of a darkened alley, desperate and longing and raw.
“Thought you’d love a bit of competition.”
And yet, he could see Neville’s eyes close as he continued to lick and suck at Theo’s most private area. His cock hung heavy between his own thighs, and he appeared to be more in bliss than in horror.
Deft hands cinched him at the waist and helped him bend himself over the sturdy thighs of his Master. He leaned forward, letting gravity take hold until his body rested against the silk fabric of trousers and his fingers lay flat against the concrete floor.
“Nonsense. I know how to handle my libations.”
“McLaggen.”
“As well as speech and eye contact restrictions, rituals, and collars.”
Not when you had a piece of him
He woke, sudden and hard the next morning, resentful of the boys around him snoring and breathing, at peace, without the images of Potter covered in sticky substances running through their minds.
And so he did what any reasonable person would have done; he fled.
“Is this because I kissed you?”
Draco and Harry talk.
With that, he turned and headed down the hallway, his walk bright and springy, his head bopping from side to side as if he were listening to some funky beat.
Draco glared, raising his eyebrows as his hair began to cling to his jawline. Potter held his stare, his eyelashes fluttering as tiny droplets of rain clumped against them. Draco almost thought he looked distant, despite their bodies being so close, but before he could consider it further, a flash of lightning lit up the sky.
“So don’t be Frank. Be Harry. That’s all we want you to be.”
Harry found them in the back of the drawer. It’s not like he was snooping, but his Gryffindor tie was missing again, and Draco had a habit of taking it with him when he went away on long trips.
He found himself so captivated staring at Theo’s expanse of toned skin, he barely noticed Neville had joined him. He had nestled Theo between his thighs, just like they had been sitting on the sofa, but this time Neville was not wearing one of his signature cardigans. In fact, he wasn’t wearing anything at all.
Draco’s face flushed further, and he licked his lips. Harry knew his words were affecting him, no matter how hard he wanted to hide it. “If I knew where they were hiding, Draco,” Harry tried to say in his strongest, most commanding voice, “I’d strip you right here in the kitchen, pull those stockings as high up your long, beautiful legs as they would go, and bend you over our table. Fuck you so hard our plates would break when they crash to the floor.”
Theo was also in complete pleasure as Neville licked his hole. His eyes were still closed, but his body arched backwards, his own hands reaching around to hold his cheeks apart as Neville continued to ravage him. Draco knew from some of his own experimentation how good some slight teasing around his entrance with the hard pad of his finger could feel, but he’d never thought about how it could be like that; how it could be wet.
“And there’s another preference,” Neville chuckled. “I’ve instructed Theo to call me
Harry shrugged, even though Malfoy couldn’t see him. “I think I’m a good listener.”
“Being roommates with that snake wasn’t mine.”
Draco blinked, thinking the dim lights in the dungeon were playing tricks on him. No way was Scarhead in a seedy club. He was a fucking Auror, Head Auror at that. Surely
“And what would that be?” Harry said, waggling his eyebrows.
“Do I look pretty?” Draco asked, his voice still tempered with nerves. He arched his spine, accentuating the long lines of his body, and Harry couldn’t wait any longer.
“Third year,” Potter said again, and Draco thought he could smell mint and something sweet, like honey.
“Interesting,” Pansy smirked. “So, Longbottom-”
“I’d love to be left alone!” Draco yelled, louder than the distance required.
A bit of Harry had always been envious about how Malfoy thrived in the limelight. It was always a space Harry was thrust into, not out of want, but out of necessity. Malfoy usually commanded it, brightening under its power. The Malfoy in front of him now, however, was more like a wallflower than a sunbeam.
“I didn’t-”
Neville moved one hand back to Theo’s shoulders, the other one resting securely on his belt as he surveyed the room.
“Yes, Sir,” he responded after a beat, and Draco couldn’t help but draw in a breath. Seeing the reaction, hearing the tone, how different it sounded from the Theo he’d seen so many years ago. This Theo, even though he was grovelling on the floor, sounded stronger. He sounded
“I’m taking him to the zoo next week. Come with me, and you can ask him all those questions yourself.” And with that, Potter ducked under Draco’s charm and was instantly soaked as he headed towards the warm house filled with his family and friends.
If he had been less distracted by the rain, by the scent of Potter’s mouth, he might have thought of a half-decent retort. Instead, he had blankly shown his cards, practically told Potter he had started wanking to him as soon as he knew what wanking was. Shameful Slytherin move.
But there were more pressing issues at hand.
With a gulp, Draco admitted to himself, and said out loud, “I’d like to learn more about impact play.”
“Dear Potter-”
Draco tried to instantly divert. “So, you’re my cousin’s godfather.” Not the most subtle transition.
Longing, stolen stares
As soon as Harry clicked off the show, Malfoy shouted in his ear.
When he opened his eyes, he saw Theo arch his back, baring his cock for Neville’s firm grip. When Neville grasped and pulled, Theo threw his head back in pleasure. “I’m coming, Daddy!” he cried as he began to paint Neville’s chest with thick stripes of his pleasure.
“She loves when I let go,” Pansy said confidently. “She loves that she’s helping me, and I love that she’s strong enough for the both of us when I need her to be.”
So was Potter controlling the bottle? Or was Draco?
Pansy’s laugh surprised Draco. “Seconds? Potter’s more into cock than he’s into twats. Didn’t you know?”
“Krum wasn’t at your match.”
I hope you all enjoyed reading this chap as much as I enjoyed writing it! Only 6 chaps left, can you believe it? Thank you all for coming along on this ride with me!
to tell you what Marjorie said.” He heard Pansy’s voice behind him, and he wanted to move, to at least get out of the bloody doorway where the setting sun was lighting him up like a fucking beacon. No, he needed to slam the door, back up into the anonymity of evening air and crowded passerbys. It was so stuffy in the bar, that was all. Stuffy, and loud, and smelling horribly of darkened ale and ex-whatevers.
If you had asked Draco that morning if he’d be visiting that lamppost again, with confidence he would have spat a hearty ‘No’.
Bad practices include:
Not that Draco mentioned any of this to anyone, including Pansy. Especially how much Potter being queer had awoken something deep inside him. Something, after weeks of wanking, he couldn’t quite admit, but he couldn’t quite ignore.
Draco looked at Neville skeptically. “And how do you do that?”
That night he had wanked himself raw, thinking of wrapping Potter’s wrists around his wrought iron bed posts, knotting his ankles as well so all his body could do was twist and beg, crying for Draco’s touch, his hand, his mouth, his cock.
“He handles a broom well, I’d say.”
“It was pouring.”
He was also surprised that even though they had clearly reached their destination, Potter did not let go of his hand. Instead, he threaded his fingers through Draco’s as he led him to the closest black walnut.
Draco had kissed someone before, but it had been Pansy, practically like kissing his sister, and it had felt so horribly wrong. This, though, felt so incredibly right. Draco leaned into Potter, crowding him even further into the tree, and even though the bark must have been rough on his back, Potter was soft in his arms, pliant and willing and so very sweet.
Then Neville did something Draco had imagined in one of his fantasies. He held Theo’s arms tightly at his sides, and began to feed him his cock.
“Thank you, Sir,” Harry released from his previously clenched teeth.
Draco shrugged. “As I’ve mentioned before, I didn’t mind seeing you soaking wet.” He spared a glance at Potter’s collarbone, where the first droplets of rain had pooled. He cursed his instinct to lick it and instead tried to think of something immediately less sexy than some dirty rain gathered at the nape of Potter’s neck. He scrunched his nose. “The falling to your death after the Dementors bit, I could have done without.”
“As we all know by now, Ginevra Weasley absolutely dominated the game against the Arrows yesterday. I spoke to this brilliant seeker just before we came on the air, who had the following to share:” Harry cleared his throat as he picked up the scribbled note Ginny had left on their table that morning.
“Hey.” Neville tentatively put a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “How about for the rest of the week we focus on the other Greens and Yellows on your list, and we’ll come back to that one.” He gave Draco’s shoulder a squeeze. “Would that be alright?”
Draco unsheathed his wand, and with a quick mutter and a swish of his wrist, he cast
was literally underground because it wasn’t the most legal establishment. And yet -
“So I know what you can do in four minutes, but what about three?” Harry said, wrapping his arms around Malfoy’s waist.
Instead, he sat on the edge of Draco’s bed, waiting patiently no matter how much Draco snored.
I have literally been waiting since last October to share the next chapter with you. Stay tuned until next Monday!
“If I was straight…” Pansy grinned, opening up her door. “You’re a stunner in that outfit.”
“Well we certainly can’t drink Italian plonk before dinner.”
Draco could only describe his first week back at Hogwarts as a living hell. While the castle looked perfectly fine, every one of his classrooms was in a different spot. He had somehow brought the wrong textbook to Herbology, and he couldn’t even find the strength to enter his Potions classrooms.
Harry focused on the smallest of sounds, the slight shuffle of leather boots against the concrete, the heaviness of his own breath as the anticipation built. He waited, unmoving, until he was told exactly what to do.
“A very good time,” Malfoy smirked.
He took in a breath before thinking,
A few weeks later, Harry sat in the studio, mic at the ready.
“What do you mean?”
“It’s okay, Draco. It’s alright to feel scared or confused.” Neville placed his hands behind his back but continued to block the door. “I want you to breathe. Three, two, one, remember?”
No one could, I guess
“Woman,” Draco said before clearing his throat. “Do stay focused.”
He wouldn’t.
“Like killing that blasted snake.”
“I want to know why you ran off,” Potter said, his eyes soft and open and honest.
Draco watched in awe as Theo visibly shuddered, eyes focused laser-sharp on the floor, a smile curling his lips.
Yes, Draco nodded to himself as he combed his hair in front of his gold-encrusted mirror. Things were going great.
“Wingardium Leviosa,” he said, not feeling the need to shout his spells like Sirius did. He directed his magic to a chair close to him in the corner of the room and fired it towards Sirius with “Depulso.”
Draco snapped his book shut with a sigh. “When you said you’d think about it I thought you were going to come back with more curses to throw at my wings… Why do you even want to go shopping? Finally going to buy me some designer robes?”
Draco just stared at the idiot. “What do you mean we’re lost?”
Remus had left for three days, on an ‘Order Mission’. Although Draco had no idea what that could possibly be, he could hear Sirius pacing around the house. He didn’t simply pace in one room, no, that would be too simple. Instead he walked all the way up the stairs, back down again, back up, into a room, around the room, back into the hallway, back up the stairs.
So he was understandably surprised when the house they called home was empty when he came home from a tiring day at work on his birthday. He double checked the date but yes, nothing was to be seen. Maybe a surprise was waiting for him inside? Draco chuckled and put the clock back into his waistcoat. He sure hoped so!
He blinked, that didn't sound so bad, except he hated going shopping with a passion.
It was disgusting how rich they were. So what to do with the money? Maybe really donating. Maybe to a family in need?
Draco looked up and grinned, "Always."
affection in private. He didn't need declarations of love, shouted proudly from the rooftops for all worlds to hear (even though he wouldn't object to it too much) or presents every day (even though he would very much like that). He was loyal to his boyfriend and lover and he would never cheat on him. So while he was taking care of the families appearance (hey, getting clothes for himself and the kids was not easy!) and tried his best, why, oh why did Harry do such a
He was a noble, so why was he the sacrifice?! Draco didn't understand. This was an outrage! But it was decided. His mother cried and was held up barely by the servants. His father had a stony face, grim looking ahead. He didn't meet Draco's eyes once since the announcement.
And now: It was too late. His poor dick would get frozen and broken off. He simply had to be faster than that. Draco was out, having a nice tea party with his mother or some shit, so Harry just had to be quicker than him.
He knew, he absolutely knew, he should not have done it. He should have not made it spicy in the first place, but he also shouldn't have eaten it without Draco present. It was not as simple as charming an 'Aguamenti' that would kill off the fire, oh no. It was a very hot fire, since it came directly from his core. 'Aguamenti' would not cut it - by far.
Except ... except the little annoying thing called 'sudden abstinence'! Did Harry have another lover he showered in attention? He really hoped not, otherwise Draco would be screwed – and not in a way he wanted. He bragged too much in the last coming together of the covens. He babbled that he alone made the demon demure and timid and that he was now the master of the demon and...
"You are a horrible gremlin," Harry laughed and slapped Draco's butt which caused the man to laugh, "Maybe, but I am your gremlin."
"Well, one point is... Uhm, visiting my father's grave. Which is probably not on your list anyway so..." Harry chuckled. That was what Draco was nervous about? He shook his head, "Actually it's on my list as well. Well, 'visiting Malfoy Manor'. So we can maybe drink some tea with your mother as well."
The god leaned over the bound defenseless human and traced the lush lips. He would have a lot of fun playing with this one. Oh yes, he totally would.
So now he was here, on the sandy beach of France, just enjoying nature while watching the sunrise. Ginny was either still asleep or didn't come to bother him since they were staying together at the beach house he bought a year ago on Ginny's insistence. She wanted a house 'at the ready when they want to spend some time elsewhere'. The keyword was 'they'. Harry didn't want that at all. He didn't even like France! But now he bought a house with his money in a country he didn't even like. He sighed.
And then the name of the suitable match:
Because two of the three Harry would not support. Maybe giving Ron a sick-pill or something that would be acceptable, but not outright killing him.
"Draco, love," Harry shook his hand and charmed bandages around the hand, "Love, it's a cold brew. You don't fill it with hot water, but rather a cold one."
Draco licked over his lips. It was kind of ... depressing?
Draco was still huffy and Harry chuckled, knowing fully well what was going on. He slid his hand on the waist and pulled the demanding man close to his heart before they apparated home. Because Harry was a sly fox he got them in front of their home, not inside. Also because he wanted to surprise his lovely boyfriend.
Draco started to sweat. The cloth in his mouth was to prevent him from talking so he could nod or shake his head. Anything else was kind of hard to interpret. He mouthed something and one hand disappeared on his thigh and appeared on his cheek, gently stroking it, "
"Visiting your parents' grave together."
While it was an honor to be chosen usually, Draco knew why he was 'receiving the honor'. He shouldn't have played with the priestess daughter! Dammit, sticking his dick in the virgin, making her unable to hear the god's voice, was the biggest mistake in his entire life! And now he was paying for it dearly. (On that note: It was not even good, so it definitely wasn't worth it!)
Well, that was high. Ginny and he didn't do a compatibility test before marrying. That was one thing more he regretted.
After the eight times, they weren't even there, leaving the doors wide open. Harry was not in the raid party every time; he had other priorities as well. But from the stack of papers and the thick folder he knew that Malfoy Manor was raided over thirty times already. It was insane. No wonder, the Malfoys moved away. The only thing missing were family pictures and personal clothes. The rest stayed where it was. A lot of treasures were 'accidentally' broken and after the first few tries, which were blocked brutally, they didn't even fight for compensation.
Slowly Harry blinked his eyes open and looked at his two best friends. He tried to smile, but failed. Another rush of pain went through him.
His dearest husband scoffed, "That is not even worth opening a vault for. I don't care what you do with the money. Donate it for all I care. We don't need it."
Not that Harry knew such a mushroom even existed but sure, he would roll with that. Whatever made his husband happy was a good thing in his eyes.
And Harry did.
His friend gripped the hand tighter without hurting the frail man and nodded, "Everything Harry. I promise I won't."

But it was worth a try! So Draco generously put the potion everywhere the bottle mentioned and then some more. He wanted a night filled with passion and lust, not some quickie.
He looked at his boyfriend and now understood why he was never invited into his bedroom. It was miserable and killed the entire mood. Harry's smile looked forced and Draco knew that Harry knew that this was not normal. Having a minimal lifestyle was one thing, having simply nothing was very unusual.
"Uhm, and well, we are now at the end of my list now."
"Thank you, dear."
Harry breathed out, now smiling genuinely, "Thank you."
Words: 672
"Draco, what should we do with it?"
The truth was that he was not ready to part ways yet. (If he ever was that is) He wanted to still stay by Harry's side (or have the demon beside him). He abused his lower lip, not hearing the door of the bedroom open and a tall, black clad person entering. He felt the chill however and turned his wide grey eyes to his lover. Instantly he smiled gently and sprawled his limbs.

"Tomorrow we will go shopping!"
It seemed that he had to talk to his wife, annul his marriage, marry and mate Draco and have a bunch of kids with him. Harry sighed again and leaned back on the couch. Maybe he should just move far, far away where no one would ever bother him.
That made Harry smile wider. Ron was too good of a friend, honestly. He eyed Hermione and she nodded as well.
Well, that was secretive. Harry pocketed the note and took the empty bottle home.
"Marriage? Like, I know; I understand if you don't; but I really want and ..." Harry jumped up and flung his papers to the side. Nothing mattered now. He engulfed his boyfriend in a hug and kissed him on the raw bitten lips.
They continued the narrow path, just enjoying the nature. They would stop occasionally since Draco wanted to pick some of the herbs and plants he needed for his potion shop. That was something Draco enjoyed and Harry went along with it. They saved money like that and Draco could choose the best quality for himself.
The hope in Ron's eyes was something Harry would probably never forget. Together with Hermione and of course Draco they packed the tiny slip in an envelope and put that in a box. And another and another and another, rinse and repeat until Ron had to open twenty boxes.
Spell breaking was his job so Harry immediately knew it was just an illusion to repel muggles and keep out ignorant wizards and witches. So he stepped closer. It was a beautifully woven spell; Harry took his time to admire it. Someone from the 'old generation' wove it. It was tight and old; very, very old. With a few incantations and a flourish sigil the illusion faded. It was not broken but rather put aside. When Harry revoked the sigil everything would be back into place.
Well, that was not really a thing to look forward to, right? He just hoped it would be quick and painless.
Harry quickly converted the pounds and sighed, "4 million 16 thousand and 64 galleons, 5 sickels and 10 knuts."
Well that sounded promising and that was why he bought it. The tiny little text underneath was almost not visible. It was the manual for it.
Draco fucking Malfoy.
A soft light brightened the cave as Draco looked at the walls, roof and ground for the mushroom. A happy giggle came over his lips as he darted to a mushroom and carefully extracted it with the soil. Harry let his husband be, just drawing his own wand to look at the walls. It was a pretty boring cave so far. Although a mysterious hue was around it at the first glance.
"Same here."
Life was full of surprises.
In stark contrast Draco looked like an ethereal being with his perfectly tailored shirt, tight bottoms and shoes. The hair was bound back in a perfect ponytail giving him a sleek and kept appearance. And Harry looked like a hobo who crawled out of a dumpster. The omega was too pretty and Harry couldn't help himself and sighed.

They had a relaxed breakfast and then went to the living room to talk about the list and then hopefully reach an agreement on what they wanted to do first.
Words: 777
Draco took one look around again and smiled at his boyfriend, "Well, it needs a helping hand but is not a complete failure."
Harry had a list out and was writing stuff on it:
As he went back to his own house he noticed a bottle in the sand. He picked it up and a rolled up note was in there. Harry smiled. A message in a bottle! Grinning, he pulled the note out. It was a very simple note, it read:
Draco just laughed and threw his arms around his taller boyfriend's neck and pressed a kiss on those lush lips, "Yes, darling. We will make it a home, not a place where you sleep." An evil glint sneaked into his eyes and Harry had a bad feeling about it.
"Also, just for your information, the potion didn't do anything for me. Next time just ask."
They hit the lotto jackpot.
"Thanks?" Harry was unsure. Draco was so quiet. A quiet Draco was never a good sign. Maybe he shouldn't have invited Draco but rather go to him again. They met up almost exclusively at Draco's flat in Diagon Alley, not in the homely little house in Godric's Hollow where Harry lived.
"What a nice surprise."
They had a nice pond in midst their yard and Harry aimed for that. The goldfish would probably scream in horror and surprise and most definitely for their lives if they could because a burning hot thing was thrown into their living room. Well, better than his own, Harry concluded.
"Oh Harry, don't move," Hermione pleaded, gently wiping over the sweaty forehead. Harry weakly smiled at her and looked at his two best friends. They were so kind, so wonderful and they didn't deserve what he did. Not one bit. But he had to do it.
The instructions on the flacon were not hard to understand. You had to open the bottle and dot the liquid on both sides of your neck, one dot on your forehead, one dot on each of the inner side of the wrist and knee. If you were really, really daring you would out one dot on the pelvis area, right underneath the belly button. That was for the fun afterwards.
The blond man blinked confused again and then smiled. So he didn't do everything wrong. He looked up at his boyfriend and kissed him on the lips. Harry reciprocated and then kissed him on the forehead.
As suddenly as everything began, it stopped. His world was plunged into the darkness immediately and it didn't matter if he opened his eyes or not – that was the only thing he could actually do. Otherwise his body was magically bound to the glowing runes and circle – everything was dark around him.
Harry and Draco looked at the lotto ticket and then at each other.
"What... no?!"
But while Draco could smoothly lie to his peers and superiors, he wasn't that good at lying to himself.
A second hand appeared on Draco's body, squeezing gently the thighs he spread so obscenely for the god.
It was March, 1st and they were gathering around Ron to give them their presents.
"Hello sexy," he whispered, eyes focused on Harry's face. The demon raised one eyebrow and looked around. Instantly he smelled what Draco did. Hm, someone was desperate it seemed. The demon grinned and snapped his fingers. All clothing vanished, except the little see-through
He felt his body hovering and being moved gently until two golden-green eyes opened in front of him. They were big and terrible and Draco shivered. If he survived that, he would never do an ancient ritual again! Never ever!
But here he was, at the ripe age of
and held hands with the second love of his life. Ginny was nice and all and in the end they divorced after James and Lily were born. It was better that way. The kids were stored away at Molly, who adored his kids and of course Scorpius, the boy which Draco had fathered, so they could enjoy a calm charming walk through Diagon Alley to shop for the kids. It was almost Christmas and Draco wanted to have a new robe (or ten, he was not going to judge either way) so they went to a fancy boutique Harry never went inside before. This would be the utmost fun for Draco; not so much for Harry. It always took ages for his lovely boyfriend to decide on the color of the robe and the lining, then the cut, the length and so on and so forth. Therefore, Harry sat on a very comfy chesterfield chair while his boyfriend and the salesperson were in a mildly heated discussion about the newest cuts and trends and what-not. The hero of the wizarding world leaned back and sipped his coffee while his gaze wandered over all the different stacks and rows of fabrics and the few mannequins that were showing the latest trend colors of robes. Harry had simply no idea what was so great about it but his boyfriend was happy when he could buy things like that. And so Harry immediately pushed the responsibility of clothing of the family in Draco's trustworthy hands. He had to admit, he would never chose things that Draco chose for him, but he looked very well-dressed now. Draco said it was 'hot' and he was 'always so bothered and throbbing and couldn't wait to rip these perfectly fitted robes off of him' while Ron and Hermione just simply complimented him. Draco took great pride in what he wore and how his family was dressed so it was no surprise that Harry was a willing victim of this. James and Lily were also dressed sharply all the time. Lily adored the ruffled and lace trimmed dressed; she said 'it made her feel like a lady'. Draco just nodded when he heard that. It was adorable.
“For instance, Theo here wants to be good.” Neville leaned down and planted a kiss on the top of Theo’s head, his hand still rubbing into his skin. “His father was not a good man, and his mother died too young to truly look after him.”
How good Potter would look in his own House colours, accentuating the gorgeous green in his eyes as Draco tied him to a chair and teased his cock with his tongue.
He tried to stare Draco down, tried to get him to answer the question that hung in the air, but Draco kept averting his eyes. Finally, Harry had to verbally say what he wanted. “Where are they, Draco?”
that he barely ended a show without it. Now, every Friday, like clockwork, Harry would finish his two-hour block listening to Malfoy whine. It fueled him for the rest of the weekend, and almost made him look forward to heading back into the studio.
“Harry! Draco! There you are!” Teddy came bursting through the exhibit with Luna and Rolf on his heels. “You’ll never believe what I saw!”
Draco stared at her, perplexed. “Please, just...keep trying.”
“Oh, did Harry invite you to the zoo with Teddy? That’s so cute!” Ginny clapped her hands in excitement.
“Always observant, Potter,” Draco responded curtly, trying to combat the blush that was rising to his cheeks.
Neville looked down at Theo, before placing his hand on his shoulder. He gave his boy a squeeze, rubbing into his shoulders with the tips of his fingers. “Do you mind if I tell our new friends a bit about your past, baby boy?”
His body was shaking as he leaned against the tile wall of the shower. Had all of that really just happened? Had he just pulled himself off to the sounds of Chosen Harry Potter, beating his own broomstick with Draco’s name on his lips?
When Draco looked down, he saw Potter’s fingers firmly clasped around him, pressing gently into his Dark Mark.
“Is that...” Draco began to say.
But you didn’t save me
His nails then dug into the sensitive heat of his backside, clawing until Harry cried out in pain.  “However, you moved without permission and dirtied my favourite trousers. I think a real punishment is in order, don’t you?”
Draco quickly ducked out of sight before Neville could see him. So many questions were running through his mind, and he knew he could ask Neville if he wanted. But first, he needed to go home and process everything he just witnessed.
“You don’t have to if you don’t want to,” Potter said across the circle.
“Why didn’t you owl me if you were back in town?” Potter continued to read, his voice whinging slightly. “Why did you meet up with that ugly slag instead of me? Do you not like-”
Neville’s hands continued to dip in and out, caressing Theo’s hardening length below the thin cotton of his pants while his other hand twisted on the chain around Theo’s neck, pulling it taut.
Draco couldn’t say much else before Neville was shoving him out the door, emptying him once again into the bland hallway. The door disappeared in a blink, and in another moment Neville was gone as well, turning in a flourish and heading back down to the training classroom.
“Great question, Melody. And, class, feel free to ask questions as we go,” Neville nodded towards the girl and gave her a warm smile. “Positions, names, collars or even wardrobe can be important to set the scene. Not everyone wants to be a Submissive at all times. So getting into the mindset can be imperative. Simple commands that are practiced and structured can provide an easy path toward entering the right headspace.”
But they had been together for more than a decade, married for a year, and Harry knew Draco better than the jagged scar above his eyebrow.
His thighs were burning, positioned so far above his head, as he struggled to keep his balance across his Master’s thighs, but the strain only heightened his pleasure, his want for release. He arched his feet, hooking his toes around the back of the chair for added stability as he felt the smooth pads of his master’s fingers begin to circle his hole.
“Thank you.” Neville squeezed his shoulder one more time, and then relocated his hand to the base of Theo’s neck. Draco watched as he rubbed tiny circles into his nape as he continued to address the room.
“What do you want?” she yelled from the kitchen. Harry stomped through their living room and found himself suddenly surrounded by a horrid smell.
He could feel his magic burning under his skin, ready to ignite with the tiniest of sparks. Draco stood, angry that the feeling had returned, angry that he was facing his demons yet again. He rushed to the exit, but Neville got to the door before he could.
He eyed the basket; it was still full to the brim. There were at least fifty or maybe more. He grinned. That would be a very nice surprise.
The sum was written on the slip and at that point, Ron's eyes were so big, Harry feared they would pop out. Thankfully they didn't but he started wailing and crying like a baby. Harry was pulled in a bone crushing hug and even Draco could escape that fate.
