There’s the other option of waking him up and just asking, but Harry suspects that whatever caused the severe injuries Paper Dracon’s sporting would have him on edge. Waking up to see a hero he hated would just serve as icing on whatever shit cake Dracon’s already eaten. He'd probably attack Harry on sight and agitate his wounds in the process.
Harry catches the bloke trying to ferret off with an older woman’s purse and nabs him in the alley he bolts down. “Really? You’re actually purse-snatching now?”
As they exit the meeting room and head down a flight to the evidence room, all the young heroes chatter together about what it could be while Alpha Bee takes the lead. Despite the somewhat strained relationship between the Hero Order and law enforcement as of late, the two organizations will occasionally share case details if the evidence starts to point toward a situation best handled by the opposing agency.
Hermione nods. “Good way to look at it.” She stands and brushes herself off. “I’ll pass your suggestion of shifting the patrolling schedule around to
“Hmm, well, there is a time limit.” Harry brought his arms behind his back and started circling Draco. “So, best we get to that Seekers’ game.
A hollow chuckle comes from Dracon. “Why do you think the price for having one’s identity revealed is so high? What else could the useless pawn offer his enemies in exchange for mercy but information?”
The next thirty seconds consist of a silent conversation between the three of them with just glances.
She waves Alpha Bee off. “I heard that they’re at it again. That we might be on the verge of catching—”
the one who’s lost the plot. Did it really matter in the long run that Fire had given him some sort of lead in return if this lead turns into nothing but a dud?
. That could be read as an underhanded slight at Potter’s current condition, and they’ve been getting on
Debate rages about how complicit in a crime a group of underage people can be when powerful adults compel and encourage the behavior. What truly throws a wrench into these debates are the particular cases involving the young Supervillains known as Blaizing Fire and Paper Dracon.
“Yes, but . . . this all started because I-I felt bad for him. And it turns out, I really shouldn’t have felt anything at all.”
Justin sucks his lips into his mouth while he thinks. “I believe . . . there were . . . two? Masked fellows in the room.”
Finally, he decides that he should try to locate the villains maintaining the fire devouring the Hero Order’s headquarters. That should eliminate the source of light that everyone is fighting by, as well as potentially save the lives of people still inside the building.
As Harry floated along in his search for Draco, he steadily became aware of creatures and sounds unfamiliar to him in Malfoy’s garden. Ghost birds trilled their screams from the canopy, deer thin as any Thestral galloped among the foliage, and insects without names hummed from leaves like the sound of falling rain. Sending a glance skyward revealed a variety of ghosts and ghouls traversing a highway of travel along the ley line bisecting Manor grounds. Beyond them, the stars were voids in an expanse of cloud-white.
Beneath the glass lies a mechanical, grey, skeletal arm, two of its fingers twisted together to appear as though they’re crossed for good luck. Two of the other fingers have been decapitated at the knuckles, and the thumb’s detached entirely—it has been placed next to the hand. The detailed mechanical wiring flows down from its exposed point in the hand under some protective plaiting starting at the wrist that continues to the elbow. From that joint, a new set of plaiting begins that cuts off where the arm had been detached from the body, ending in a cluster of frayed wiring and jagged metal. Additional holes and slits along the protective armor suggest more damage to the machine. Within these damage points, Harry can see flashes of cut wiring, little white bits, and cog-like machinery—particularly at the joints.
The villain’s head turning partially in Harry’s direction is all the confirmation he gives. “Had his identity been revealed, he’d have become a liability to the Agency. The only thing worse than failure in the Agency’s eyes.” His hand ghosts over the broken leg.
“. . . No. At least not directly, and probably not on purpose. Mostly it was just collateral from his fight with the robot.”
The villain lifts the note and reads it as Harry pulls the two masks over his own head—the copy under-mask Hermione made having dissolved when
Potter ducks his head, moving the scarf for better eye-slits, and swaps the pairs of glasses, shoving his usual pair in his robe pocket. “Maybe.”
“You can have some time to think it over the next few days. I won’t rush you on it.” Draco re-brandishes the paperwork he brought with him (consent forms, advice pamphlets, and so on) and makes a show of placing it on the floor before retreating through the attic trapdoor.
The two of them watch as the Aurors clear out the line-up except for the gentleman second to last on the far-right end. A table and set of chairs is summoned from the ground below and suddenly the line-up room becomes transformed into an interrogation room. Magical manacles identical to the ones used in Wizengamot hearings latch onto the suspect and pin him to his chair.
Shaking himself from his stupor, Draco takes the opportunity to create a sketch of the suspected bartender. He uses his Ministry-allocated Swift Sketch Quill to draft as accurate an image as possible to the one Ms. Adams describes.
He shifts his gaze from the building but can’t seem to spot the pyro-powered people responsible for maintaining the blaze. Instead, he makes out a dozen backlit figures clashing with one another. He recognizes the work of some heroes’ powers, like Cho clearly taking advantage of the rainfall or the flurry of bats swarming different figures at the behest of
“What would a new villain have told us? We already have one, and we barely got anything out of him. Another one would have just been a complication. Or another reason for the Villain Agency to start picking off our hero—”
“That’s not pathetic.” Cho keeps her head facing the sky, jaw working. “That sounds like the nature of a hero. To care when no one else will.”
Ron sighs. “Look, mate. I know you’ve been feeling really strange about him, lately, after you found out about his involvement in the kidnapping-turned-murder case, but—”
Draco laughs as he stares up at the drywall ceiling and ignores the wet tracks running down his face and his neck. “It’s
“How in the hell did you manage to throw a car at us?” Ron’s stalling—Harry knows this and tries to angle himself better.
Uncontrolled strikes of lightning zap aimlessly out into the room, and everyone standing ducks for cover.
Potter crosses his arms as he seems to take the stare as a challenge, even if the other man can’t see them.
“Enough of it. I—” he paused. “I held some resentment towards them, my parents. For what they did during the war. For what they raised me into. It was... nice, hearing her apologize, even if she only half understood why she should.”
Harry looked back down at the three mini-graves just ahead of where he still crouched. “Yeah, perhaps not.”
Feeling his whole body start to shake in low hysterical laughter, Harry braces a hand against the stone wall.
The devilish smirk from when Draco first informed Harry of his intent to haunt him reappeared. “Let’s get to it then.” And he released the Snitch which bolted up for the skies.
“All right,” Draco says at the same time one of the Aurors in the room says, “You sure?” Draco sends the man a withering glare.
“I-I don’t know. When I think back to being in that room, all I can call up is the terror I felt.” Justin shivers. “Even thinking of it now, I . . . .”
Several locks spring from their tumblers, and the door opens a crack. A brown eye stares out at the two of them, about the height of Draco’s sternum. Then the door shuts again, and the scurrying of feet can be heard before a melodic voice calls out, “Door’s unlocked. Come in.”
“You’ve felt guilty for so long over what happened to them, but Draco, they’ve been helping you this whole time! They’re trying to tell you it’s okay. It’s okay now. And, this is the last one—you must be close, so close, Draco.”
He’s placed a gloved hand over where his mouth would be underneath his mask, and, now that Harry’s paying attention to him, his wracking coughs can be heard where Harry’s stationed.
Harry goes to dig his nails into the table, but his gloved hands just slide uselessly against the surface.
As they drag Ron towards the dock shed’s exit, Harry looks back to where the villain had lain and only catches a glimpse of his cronies carrying him off—one even runs back for the dragon mask that must have fallen when they lifted him. Harry presumes they’re headed to the boat loaded with crates filled with cargo he’d never gotten to see.
Dracon cranes his head up, so Harry assumes the prick’s looking at him. “Which bit?” he asks thinly.
Heart pounding, he brushes aside some moss growing on the stone so that he can read the dates. He discovers that Kevin had been 17 when he died, and that the time of his passing had been earlier in April of the current year. Harry blinks and tries to remember when Mrs. Figg said Kevin had taken her boat.
“I meant about having you wait several days before my answer. It would’ve been sent sooner, but Kreacher was reluctant to fetch me an owl. You made a poor impression, apparently.”
Harry wants to ask about the argument, but figures there’s not enough time. “Bet he was real happy ‘bout that.”
Draco waves a dismissive hand. “Hardly. It’d be better luck catching him another day—which I will let you know about, should you want to tag along again.”
“I suggest you stop whatever game you’re playing at,” Hermione says. “You’re forgetting who has the power here to make your stay uncomfortable.”
“While we wait for answers to come to us, heroes wait for attacks on themselves—or did you think no one here would notice it’s all the younger heroes here tonight?”
The doors screech loudly on their wheeled hinges as Harry pushes them open and screech again when he shuts them behind him.
The scattered remains of the mechanical arm are in a box in the third drawer from the floor. He lifts it from out of the drawer and takes the lid off. To get a closer look, he brings the box under the closest light overhead.
Ron’s arm starts to shake where he holds it aloft, and he brings up his other hand to brace it against the strain.
“I wanted some ice cream, Potter, just as anyone who’d spent their childhood begging by the window would. Stop overanalysing it, could you?” Draco takes a scoopful and shoves it in his mouth, his eyes fluttering shut. When he opens them a few seconds later, Potter still hasn’t touched his. “Like I said, it was a stressful day for both of us. Overwhelming at times. We both deserve a treat to unwind, all right?”
Harry glanced around, his stomach sinking. He, too, only counted two peachicks fluttering about. Despite all his better judgement, Harry rushed to Draco’s side, crouching down beside him where the ghost had sunk to his knees. He moved his hands against the outline of Draco’s back, swallowing his cry against the biting cold radiating from the incorporeal spirit. “Hey, hey. It’s okay. It probably got left behind at the flat. You know, like last time you did some Ghost Disapparation. We’ll find it, okay?”
sensation. It was as if my soul was being ripped from my body. Ced must have felt it too, but he wrapped his arms around me and bore the brunt of—
As Harry heads over, he realizes Dracon is putting on the rest of his costume. When he almost reaches him, Harry hears a distinct
Instead, he strides into the room, bent on getting a glimpse through the window. As soon as he knows Blaizing Fire’s all right, he’ll head back to the medical ward, the soreness in his limbs and his growing headache agreeing.
Throughout this process, Paper Dracon has been directing from the bottom of the staircase. Even now, his hands still hover like a maestro. When all the color has faded from his giant serpent, Dracon waves his hands away from one another like the movement of arms in the Breaststroke.
If Dracon’s startled that Harry has become aware of what happened the night he found him in a ditch by North Circular Road, he doesn’t show it. “That night—I had been pestering the older villains for a while to be more involved in professional work. In a way, I got my wish . . . .”
The Supervillain remains slouched against the wall. “Though, gotta say, that’s a cute little speech you made there. Talking about choices like they matter, when just before you were talking about how
He gets up and is nearly within Alpha Bee’s outstretched arm before he turns back toward the table. “But what about—?”
“Potter,” Draco says again, this time with his hands placed in front of himself in a placating gesture.
Closing his eyes, Potter takes a moment to consider. “No,” he breathes. “Or not as much. I—meeting Ms. Adams and Mr. Park... that helped, I think. All of us. Feel less alone in this. And—and being here...” His lips turn upward as he opens his eyes to look around the room and then stops them on Draco. “You came here for me?”
He sighs. “Fear-Near showed up to my flat—rented out for me by my . . . Prancing Peacock—with a list of people they wanted ‘captured.’ Though, ‘abducted’ would be a more accurate word.” Dracon stops limping forward and massages his leg with one hand. “I . . . was eager to please on what felt like a step up the Agency chain. I abducted half the people he wanted and brought them, bound and unconscious, to him. You know, I never asked
“Then we’ll have to get it ourselves, won’t we?” Ron noticeably shifts his head in Harry’s direction. “Won’t necessarily be confidential information if we get it straight from the source, eh, mate?”
With care and great precision, she removed three cloth bundles from her night-robe pocket and laid them out on the grass side by side. “For you, my sweet,” she whispered. Then she unraveled the bundles and revealed three Dark Marks.
He turns his gaze away from the fight below. His eyes take a few moments to adjust to looking in the darkness surrounding him rather than at the brightly glowing blaze. Slowly, he depletes the amount of electricity running through his system to zero. Now that he’s stopped glowing, he strides to the left until he stands at the corner edge of the roof.
As he speculates just how to climb the stack of three boxes, movement in his periphery draws his attention. A giant, flapping paper swan is flying towards him, and, swift as he can blink, Harry yanks the electricity from one of the few hanging lights and strikes it down.
While a villain is more likely, completely dismissing other options would be remiss of Harry. A hero or unknown vigilante still could've been involved.
Now, considering his distraction and the fact that he is technically out on patrol, it wouldn’t be fair to say he’s out looking for Paper Dracon. But he finds him anyway.
“You sure did a bang up job helping me when you blasted me—” he takes a breath that sounds like it hurts “—and stomped my hand.”
I’m an Auror in-training, and I couldn’t even tell my date was a vampire! Not by any of the other interactions we had. Nothing!”
In his other hand, Dracon grips his dragon skull mask, black shirt, and black dress trousers. “As long as we don’t attack or threaten that thing, it won’t throw actual attacks at us.”
Harry gathers together the pieces he finds, careful not to actually touch any more than the one caught in his hand. They barely amount to a handful, but, even as he sits there analyzing them, another piece flutters by his head.
Harry winces. He’d been out cold when she’d evidently stormed to the medical ward to let him have a piece of her mind. Thankfully, Poppy Petal has a policy of not allowing in visitors who aren't privy to her patients' true identities. But as soon as he gets discharged, he knows he will have to face her. “So, any news for today?”
The group throws more questions Harry’s way, but Harry cannot answer without giving his identity away. He dodges as one of them throws a blow at him, and he waves his arms frantically in front of himself. Then he makes a writing motion on his palm.
“Ah-hum. Y-yes . . . yes.” Several beads of sweat glide down the side of the MP’s face as he quickly looks behind him at the Palace. “What you’re looking for is at the House of Lords. A group of villains burst through the ceiling in the midst of our session.”
The sun has completely set, and now Harry only has the light from the streetlamp trickling into the alleyway and his own electrical glow to see what he’s doing. Even so, just slightly feeling the leg causes his stomach to turn.
A sizzling sound can be heard as his power strikes. Then a thrumming noise starts up as the current catches on and heats the graphite, making the lightning bird glow.
“That’s... odd.” Vampires tend to be quite distinct from what Draco knows of them from his schooling and work in his current department. Skin with the grey tinge of death, eyes bloodshot red—no reflection, no heartbeat. The smell of blood clinging like cologne. “Surely there were some kind of signs—”
One of the Aurors’ hair changes from black to a salt and pepper grey while another Auror has age lines crossing her face where before it was smooth. The Auror who cast the spell loses an inch of height and ragged patches in his red Auror robe suddenly stick out in sharp relief.
Mrs. Figg is prattling on about how the organization could at least have brought him flowers to put on his grave, but maybe that’s too much to expect out of bad people.
The set of her shoulders declares she’s not pleased that Harry is not resting like he’s supposed to, but she’s dealt with him long enough to know he won’t when he’s this stressed about a situation. “Even after
The limited range of motion provided by the tux had prompted Harry to take the more traveled ways of transport, a mixture of bus rides and walking—which led to his run-in with the boat lady from last night.
“Every choice we make determines who we are.” He starts to wonder if holding the fabric too tightly would result in new rips and loosens his hold a little more. “I mean, come on. Haven’t you ever had a dream? Something to strive for that’s different from where you’re at? Something to prove everyone else wrong about? What keeps you going every day?”
. Pieces torn from the cloth that had covered it stick in its mechanical joints, making it look like a creature dressed in rags.
away from here,” Harry said, pocketing his wand and sinking into the seat vacated by the void-ghost. Considering that ghost had freaked Harry out the most, he was doing a piss poor job of convincing himself his seating choice wasn’t a calculated move of dominance.
His shoes splash a little in the wet puddles forming in the divets of the street, his Umbrella Charm faltering slightly as he fights to get the scrap of parchment out of his pocket. A giant drop slips through and smears the second
Impossibly, Paper Dracon’s laughter heads up an octave, and he hunches over his legs in a way that has to hurt. “Oh! You’re too much. Too much, hero. Keep this up, and I might even learn your name.”
“And on that note,” Alpha Bee breaks in, “I say we take a look at what the law enforcement detectives have dropped off for us to examine.”
Potter’s eyes narrow and his foot starts tapping. Even more annoying, the staccato beat isn't even set to the rhythm of the music coming from the sitting room.
When Malfoy bent down to reattach one of his big toes, he asked the floorboards, “Why put up with me?”
Then he heads back inside and, instead of wrangling someone to head back out into the corridor with him, holds out his hand for someone to choose to take. Regardless, fearful muttering breaks out amongst the group, speculating about why he went out into the corridor again only to come right back, as well as the odd shift in treatment. Some worry the change in behavior indicates a particularly horrendous experiment. Still, Harry waits, even as more precious time ticks away.
From his position on the street, Harry can see almost directly into the flats affected. The front door to the complex stands wide open, and movement is visible inside.
Fire scoffs, waving a hand in the air. “If you’d managed to capture him, I doubt you’d be in here with
He reaches in, feels for it, and then presses the button down three times. The first for check-in, the second for location honing, and the third for “now!”
Their desperation turns the kiss messy. All their angles are off, and Draco cuts his lips against Harry’s fangs more than once. Hands fly from gripping at hips and tearing at backs to tangling in hair and back again in seconds. It’s needy and rushed and very much the best kiss of Draco’s life. Not that he has many to compare it to.
“Okay.” Another moment passes with Hermione standing in front of the pair before she jumps at them and throws her arms around them both. “It’ll be all right, Harry.”
“Hmm, yes. Partly.” Her breath ghosts before her face before dispersing in the air. “You see, it’s my fault he died."
“You asked me to.” He curses himself for the honest answer and thinks quickly on how best to undercut it. “I mean, come on. Who wouldn’t be curious to receive such a message from an enemy and it not be some sort of ransom note or threat?”
“One,” they breathed. The two of them shot up from the ground at the same time and cleared the trees in a matter of seconds.
And Draco’s suddenly aware of the small space they’re in—the side alley’s so narrow—and while Potter is still too far away to touch Draco, he’s closer than he’s ever been since being bitten. Draco’s head starts swimming when he feels the intensity of Potter’s attention, all zeroed in on Draco, and their Hogwarts days seem just a fistful of robe away—except Draco hasn’t needed to say anything horrible this time around.
Harry hums in thought and rocks on his feet. “Guilty. Hey, have you ever heard about this cartoon they had over in the States?
Hands twitching at his sides, Harry decides to cut his losses. “See you around, Nurse Tonks. Nurse Moody.”
“Now,” he continues, “I say we move on to the next stage of your punishment for betraying us. Just outside this room, we have an object everyone in the Agency has grown familiar with—”
Harry fiddles with the cuff-link on Blaizing Fire’s outer coat. Steeling himself, he first removes the flame-red identification mask, and then he takes off the under-mask.
“For not even a minute did I think you were some lesser hero—for losing your partner and disappearing for so many years. Can’t imagine anyone else would, either."
. Sorry. You—I didn’t expect—” He clears his throat into his fist. “Ah, um. I’m preparing some Kimchi for Wednesday, so that's the base for the paste boiling there—the other ingredients are prepared on the counter. My daughter will be coming home for the holiday, and I thought surprising her with her favourite dish would be, well, um. Good. A good fatherly thing to do. Yes.”
“Where is he?!” Ron shouts as the horse slows its momentum so it can turn around and charge them again. “Where’s that bastard hiding?!”
“I know you don’t like me,” Harry says into the stillness. “That’s fine. I think I understand why. You feel like I’m putting my own desires before everyone else—”
The door swings open, and he’s face to face with Potter. Or as face to face as one can be when the other person is wearing six different layers and a scarf wrapped around their head.
Harry immediately sobered; nothing was really funny about this situation. The familiar banter had crafted a careless forgetting. “Sorry. That was over the—”
Draco’s stuttering breath is loud to his ears, and he tries not to think how loud it likely is to Potter. “S’fine,” he chokes out. Then he leads Potter the rest of the way to the last victim’s house, painfully aware of his own jerking steps.
According to the witness, not everyone in the hostage group made it out. Dead bodies are still inside.
Draco shook his head, his hand rippling against the invisible barrier that kept him trapped. “I know.”
Dracon twists his head so he faces forward again and away from Harry. “What’s this about wrapping my leg?”
Harry turns over several more times before giving up on sleeping. Reaching over to his nightstand, he nabs the current novel he’s reading and flicks on the lamp. His bookmark falls onto his chest as he opens to his saved page. He twirls the worn paper with
Blaizing Fire lifts his head from its perch on his hand as he evidently watches Harry shuffle the deck and deal to them both. “Not really up to it this time either. Find yourself a different playmate.”
“I know, Hermione.” He finally shifts his eyes toward her, his hazel meeting her brown ones. “Don’t you think I want to be out on patrol, too, instead of staying in here, taking forever to recuperate?”
Not having to be told twice, Harry gathers his electricity to his fingertips. Then he shoots nearly everything he has at the paper bird.
For one heart-stopping second, Draco thinks Potter will refuse, and what will he do then? But then Potter’s hand moves until the tips of his gloved fingers latch onto the edges of Draco’s robe.
anything to you. I-it's so stupid—But every time you’d call me ‘hero’—even derisively—you’d . . .” His heart’s in his throat, and why—
“He had stopped laughing after the colleague started attacking the machine. I think he was yelling? I couldn’t see if he was doing more than that, though.”
Harry knows he certainly doesn’t like the way Voldemort eyes Harry now. A kind of chilling recognition.
Shadows shift on Potter’s face as he winces, a small fang flashing in the candlelight, and Draco can feel his face reflecting the expression back. “Invited them into my flat. Turned my back to get the drinks. Was pinned to a wall. Stomach to wall; hands on my hands, fangs—” Potter’s hand presses to the left side of his neck as though stemming the flow from an open wound.
When Harry makes his way to the rain-slicked rooves again, curtains of water descend upon London. He debates heading home now when an odd orange glow in the distance catches his attention.
Once Draco’s department knows what to look for, it’s not too long before they locate several victims that match well enough to the description Potter gave; being much more recent attacks, a greater likelihood exists that the vampire hasn’t shifted in appearance—which means better chances of tracking the creature down. And true to his own word, Draco contacts Potter about it.
stumble outside of the Palace’s hall. Then, to top things off, he hears the unmistakable grinding sound of GarGoyle taking full advantage of Ron’s distracted state.
“Hah. Not in Villain Strip Poker.” He winks. “Though, if you want to bet your trousers in exchange, I won’t complain.”
“Think I fig-ured it out,” Draco says. Knowing he needs to be careful with his words here, he stuffs his free hand in his robe pocket, grasps his wand, and quickly whispers a sloppy Sobering Charm. It does the trick to take the edge off his haze. He blinks at Potter with clearer eyes. “Who—or rather, the
Draco had discovered shortly after his passing that his family hadn’t only trafficked in albino peacocks, but had helped sponsor—or perhaps run—Quidditch games in the game’s earlier stages of development. The flock of Golden Snidgets that resided deep in the garden were more than happy to put on a show in the moonlight. For the right price.
“Remember when I was seven, Father, and I went to plug in that battle simulator when the power surged, and I got zapped? It was like that. Sudden, overwhelming, thrilling, and over way too fast to have been real."
Hermione sputters for a moment. “The usage of special outfits during the plague is plenty interesting!”
The glass awning entrance of Whittington Hospital comes into view, and Harry drops down from the house roof. Looking both ways, he crosses the street and strides across the cobbled entryway, passing the wall with “Whittington Health” embossed on its surface.
“—erations, mind you—that’s a nice playground for my cats?” Mrs. Figg’s foot taps as she watches him.
“Well, it’s bad but probably not that bad, right? I mean, if you work at being a hero now, you might shave off a few years. It would mean one less enemy to worry about for us. Plus, heroes and villains learn one another’s true identities all the time. Yeah, it adds a little more danger to the mix, but overall, it’s something people learn to handle. I doubt the Villain Agency has anything groundbreaking planned on that front.”
It’s said casually enough that Harry has no doubt he’s their prime suspect. “Of course.” He pauses for a long, drawn-out moment. “Sir.”
Her tone chilled him, as though her words pulled him into the hollowness in her eyes, and the empty void inside was frigid with the warmth of loving another person snuffed out.
“Blaise—Blaizing Fire—” Paper Dracon’s voice is so soft that Harry nearly misses it. “—told me about what you did. How you kept to the Code, even for him.”
“How?” Fire scoffs. “Only had to set the underside of it on fire at the right angle. Made a nice little explosion too. But you’d hardly notice with the fuss the common folk are m—Are you trying to attack me?!”
“. . . Yes,” Harry says. “But before I passed out, I remember some letters on the side of the arm lighting up. They were
Harry stands out on the balcony overlooking the local park, glass of champagne dangling from his electrically charged fingertips. He came out for some fresh air, the party below getting too stuffy for him. Handling crowds of people for long periods of time has never been his strong suit. Though, seeing all the happy heroes—Ron dancing with Hermione, Luna and Ginny snogging in a corner, and Cho giggling with Lavender, Parvati, and Padma—reminds Harry of how far they've come since worrying over the threat posed by the Villain Agency.
She sighs, her slouched posture suggesting surrender. “If it truly is the Villain Agency, then it’s very likely that the attack on Mad-Eye was for intimidation.”
So, Harry consented, if only so that Malfoy might stop his skulking. Later in the week, Harry confronted him with the plan, and to Harry’s surprise, Malfoy agreed.
“As long as you’re sure...” Hermione gave a final counter-clockwise turn and the potion settled from midnight blue to cerulean with silver shot through. “The potion’s ready.”
Lifting the envelope, Harry turns it around in his hands. The note is sealed, and the envelope is blank on all sides. He waits until Ron sits down on the bed, facing him. “Who’s it from?”
Ron’s cheeks turn a light pink. “Er . . . . I didn’t pry it open or anything. But I may have held it up to a streetlight to see if I could see inside.”
The villain straightens the best he can before Harry with his broken leg. “So, he was captured, then?”
’ve forgiven me for my transgressions. Yet for all they know, I haven’t changed a bit! Merlin, people are more sycophantic than they were before the whole Dark Lord business—trying to pull me back into society’s good graces before I’ve even
Part of what grates on Harry about his interactions with constabulary while wearing his suit—a clear indicator to all who see him of his hero status—is the disregard and dismissal his law enforcement counterparts display for him. Although, he knows run-ins could turn much worse.
As Harry lies on the couch in the Weasley drawing room, he mulls over those options as well as the other thoughts that had been kept at bay for over a week. Pushing away the confusing thoughts about Paper Dracon and Cho, he thinks about the unsolved kidnapping-turned-murder case, and how the patients admitted to the hospital have most likely been discharged.
“I’m not sure about whether I saw this the night I went into the building. Everything seemed to be on fire, and smoke was everywhere. And my main focus was on finding survivors of the explosion,” Harry says, feeling like he’s managed to let his fellow heroes down once again.
After extracting himself from his friends’ embrace, Harry sat down on the chaise, taking in the sweeping gaze of the moon as the shifting clouds in the sky broadened its touch on the gardens. When Hermione handed Harry a vial of the cerulean liquid, he wondered over how his friends had only asked him if he was sure and not whether he was afraid. But perhaps, unlike the countless fans that asked for his autograph or fawned over the idea of him, they actually knew the answer. He spared them both a final glance before returning his focus to the sprawl of trees beyond the window and downed the whole vial in a single gulp.
They continue their search in silence for a while. Finally, Ron asks, “Where exactly do you think it is?”
“Yeah. They were placed in a way that you’d almost they think were eyes.” He rubs at his chin. “I don’t remember much of what it did. But, I guess, underneath the fear, I felt really cold. No that’s not quite right. More like my body was going numb—though, that still might have been from the terror.”
The fingers Potter has pressed against his neck curl, tugging at the skin there. His head’s angled in such a way that the candlelight reflects a glare off his glasses, shielding the expression in his eyes from Draco. “I think... I remember. They whispered—they wanted me to call for help. Before I was bitten.”
Thoughts of a bubble-bath surrounded by cinnamon-scented candles after dinner dash from Harry’s mind when he catches the glint of a familiar-looking mask out of the corner of his eye. He immediately jumps down from the rooftop—taking some unfortunate shingles with him—and into the shadows cast by the darkened building.
“Your plan seems to hinge on this villain letting important information slip—or even capitulating so far as to knowingly provide it.” Alpha Bee tugs at his beard. “Yet there is no indication thus far that Paper Dracon would even do so.”
Dracon is just as Harry remembers him, wearing the same many-pocketed black outfit, paired with two sets of masks.
“Respectfully, Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry said from behind clenched teeth, “back-handed compliments aren’t compliments, and that kind of attitude is what started this whole mess in the first place. If you actually regret what happened with your son—not just his death, but even the involvement with a group like Voldemort’s, you’d work on ridding yourself of that thinking. Prove that your love for your son is greater than the hate that’s festered in you and your family for so long.”
Cho jabs her pointer finger in Harry’s direction. “That still doesn’t make sense. He barely had reason to trust you to help his wound, but then he lets you
When he slides the key into the lock of the mystery door, it fits perfectly. Bracing himself for what he might find, Harry shoves the door inward.
model—” He lifts the sheet up enough to reveal the lower shelf “—I’m sure you’ll recognize your Agency costume. Blaise, I know what you’re thinking—”
This one’s different from the rest. For one, he’s wearing a pearly white dragon skull mask, its mouth open in a snarl, the pupils of its eyes slit wide so that the wearer can see, and two horns arch out on either side of the face from the forehead. For another, he’s striding with too much swagger in his step to be a mere henchman.
He stands in the empty kitchen downing shots of Firewhiskey while everyone else stays in the sitting room, finally breaching the forbidden topics simmering beneath the surface. At some point, voices start to raise above the sound of the Wireless playing, and Draco turns on the sink, rinsing out his glass seven times despite knowing he’ll soon refill it again.
Narcissa Malfoy was also not to be found anywhere at the Malfoy estate, despite her recent return to England.
Making a triumphant sound, Dracon moves to release the origami piece in his fist, when Harry says, “What do you mean? ‘After torturing’ Fire?”
A pink splotch appears on his neck, however his lips twitch as if he’s about to grin. “How unfortunate. They’ve just had to rush him down to Intensive Care.”
Tension leaves Dracon’s shoulders, and he starts to turn around again to leave. Before he can get very far, Harry holds out the dragon skull mask to him. “Here”
Unbidden, a spark of suspicion rose within Harry. How long had Draco known about what the peachicks actually were? But as he took in the hollow horror on Draco’s face as he stared down at his palm, Harry recalled how distraught he’d been with each missing baby peacock. If Draco had known, he’d have never uttered the words “I wish.”
“Harry?” Just as ghostly as ever and with his last peachick tucked in his chest hole, Draco seemed more real than anything else Harry had seen thus far, floating several meters away.
“You’re probably right to feel the way you do—because, today, I realized I am. In a way, at least.” Harry releases a breath, and it fogs the air in front of him. “After knocking out the Supervillains maintaining the fire on headquarters, I ran into that villain again. The one I kept letting get away from me. He gave me this, by the way.” Harry lifts a hand to pat at the bandage around his head. “The concussion, I mean. Not the wrap.”
Confused muttering breaks out among the villains standing. Blazing Fire tilts back a little before Harry feels that same sensation of being studied.
Caught up as he is by his own thoughts, it’s hard to miss the sound of the door opening and closing. Deciding that tailing the person who just left makes for better use of his time than tormenting himself with his regrets, Harry slides out of bed and sneaks out after them. In the dim light of the hallway, he catches a glimpse of a bare foot heading up the stairs to the roof. Wrapping his blanket tighter around himself, Harry follows.
“Harry!” Hermione nabs the plate she’s prepared him and places it at his spot. Then she puts one down for Ron.
Wasting no time, Dracon drags Harry over to the wall where a medium-sized, latched door resides. He yanks it open and shoves Harry through.
The third and final victim on their sheet lives in a house just outside of Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley. They have to cross through Knockturn in order to reach it, and, for the first time, Potter draws closer to Draco during their walk. Whether it’s from protectiveness over Draco, or a desire to feel protected by Draco, Draco’s pounding heart hardly cares. He can only hope Potter’s too distracted by the shifty characters passing them in the Alley to take note over what Draco’s heart is doing.
Mr. Hendricks sighs and rolls his eyes. “If you’re asking me if I attacked those two, my answer is I don’t know.”
The rest of the time Harry spends fixing up the break site is spent in silence. When he’s done all he can do, Harry stands back up and helps Dracon to his feet.  “Well, that’s it. I recommend you go see a professional, though. What I did won’t hold for as long as that needs to heal. Plus, you need to think about the possibilities of infection and—”
“Well, there you go,” Ron says. “That’s what you get, trying to assist a villain. We’re on polar opposite ends of the spectrum. And, you don’t have to feel guilty because he clearly wasn’t
A frightfully ancient House Elf answers the door. Its eyes are narrowed on Draco before it seems to recognise him. “To what does Kreacher owe such wondrous surprise?” he asks with a deep bow.
With a kind of reverence, he takes the bundle out of its hollow and unties the knot keeping the stack bound. Harry catches the papers that try to scatter about the floor. Taking them over to the dresser, he lays them down and sorts through the stack. A bunch of them are letters of orders given from the Agency; others are pictures of Kevin with other masked members; one looks like early schematics for the
“Eh, the thing is . . . I mostly just relied on my powers to control the lighting. I never learned how to handle the machinery. And they were in the middle of an important production—one that could put them on the film industry map. They couldn’t really afford to keep on an amateur lighting technician—especially one that already had to be part-time due to school.”
He stares at the entrance for longer than he would like to admit. It’s only the brisk wind cutting through his costume that finally spurs him into action.
Alpha Bee says, “Besides what I already mentioned, the detectives have found that the arm is made from an odd type of metal. It’s rare in the sense that they haven’t encountered it before and have no leads on where it originated. However, from our analysis, it appears to be a metal called Acromium. Used to be common with Super families for acclimating well to different power sets. However, its deleterious effects resulted in the EU putting a ban on its continued use and trade around 1975.”
“And I said that’s dangerous! So, you shouldn’t be running anywhere on your own. And especially not to face him alone.”
And Draco’s suddenly not drunk enough for this conversation, but his luck’s run out alongside the Firewhiskey in his bottle. “’Whyyy’?”
you understood their pain, Potter. And—and you left the room because you got overwhelmed, didn’t you? Now, and back then, too—at the victims’ homes.”
Not exactly like Harry had planned to have a good portion of his time taken up with the boat-hunting job from last night, but he didn’t wait to be told again.
Harry hums in agreement and then tunes out the rest of the conversation as it veers towards Acromium and the many questions Hermione has about the metal.
Harry paces in the narrow path empty of junk and storage boxes. Finally, he stops and says, “So, you know how I went to talk to the witness today?”
The nurse on shift eyes Harry up and down. He fixates on Harry’s mask, just below the point where Harry’s eye lenses are located. “And you would be?”
, is that while you’ll go home and take all that off once your play time’s over, I’ll still be here doing this. I’ve trained for this chance my entire life, and some weak little nobody isn’t about to–Ack—!”
Draco sits straight in his chair, plants his feet to prevent any rocking, and turns his full attention to Ms. Adams. “Good afternoon, Ms. Adams. Thank you for coming to our department on this matter and for agreeing to meet in person, though I wish our meeting could have been for a happier occasion.” He gives her a small, apologetic smile. “If you would, ma’am, please expand more on the incident. While the details you gave the Ministry were helpful, if we hope to catch the vampire, we’ll need as much detail as you’re willing to provide.”
There’s a boy and girl who both look roughly his age and have equally flaming red hair. They wear citizen fare. They're not heroes come to help him. Unfortunate.
Memories and images crowd Harry’s brain, but now he has an idea of how he’s come to be where he is and . . . .
Harry finds himself drawing closer to Dracon, hands hovering a good meter above his legs. “But you’ll get a permanent limp that way!”
“Yeesh. You’re jumpy today, aren’t you?” Dracon’s sigh is loud in the stillness of the building. “No, I don’t plan to shove you off.”
As GarGoyle and Paper Dracon dismount from the swan’s back, Harry can’t bite his tongue fast enough. “Feeling better, I see.”
Everyone in the room sets their gazes upon him with a turn of their heads—even Blaizing Fire, whose faster breathing lets everyone know he’s given up the pretense of being calm.
Thanking her profusely while she leads him up the stairs, Harry walks through Kevin’s room—dusty from months of disuse. It’s mostly cleaned-out—probably from when his parents came to collect his items after his death.
Harry winces. “But I think you’ll all maybe understand in a moment. See, I think that there’s something particularly strange going on in the Villain Agency. Especially with Paper Dracon. Like, maybe a rift of some kind.”
It only clicks for Harry when the air surrounding them all turns hazy, yet all the people continue standing out in stark relief.
“I’m—” The smoke’s too rough in his throat, and Harry turns away his head in a coughing fit. “I’m a Superhero. New one.” Though, he probably doesn’t look or sound much like one at the moment.
Harry shook his head and walked into Draco’s space, catching his other hand that was fluttering about in a nervous gesture. “I’ve run from death for a long time, outpacing it more than anyone really has a right to. Remember how I mentioned that before? Technically, Voldemort killed me with that second Killing Curse in the Forbidden Forest, only I traded the death of part of his soul for a return to life for mine. Death is but an old friend of mine who was quite kind the last time we met.”
Harry only finds out about that, though, because the officer shouts it to the cop interrogating Harry before dashing inside the building with night stick raised.
Everybody looks to the newcomer leaning against the other side of the stairway, opposite the way Cho came from.
“Oh, yes, a vampire victim would be out and about during—” Draco bites his tongue. He doesn’t need to turn around or for Potter to uncover himself in order to
Hermione offers her hand, and Cho takes it. Together, they head back to the observation room with Ron trailing behind them.
Through what sounds like clenched teeth, he says, “Break it again. So it can be reset and heal properly.”
His bird’s eye view gives him the advantage of being able to see most of the individuals out on the battlefield, as well as not having the people fighting backlit from the fire. He counts more heroes out fighting than when he could only rely on identifying their powers, but the villains still outnumber them a good three to one.
“Proper villain?” Harry mumbles, voice cracking slightly from puberty. He’s spent most of the last three years following the adventures of the Superhero duo Cho & Ced before their sudden retirement from the hero scene this year; compared to the Supervillains those two faced, the only thing about this bloke that measures up is his costume. Although, that’s one thing the villain has on Harry—a proper costume.
Just as promised, he doesn’t fully close the cell door. Harry pockets the key rather than running it back to the laboratory; now, at least, if a villain stumbles upon the unsealed door, they won’t be able to lock it again.
James’s Control over Wind helped them tour the entire country fighting crime—not just in London. Lily’s Control over Sound gave the pair amazing stealth, perfect for hostage situations and gaining the upper hand on foes. The two of them made waves in the Super community—and probably that was why Voldemort (Moldy Wart, as he's called by the Order), the head Supervillain at the Villain Agency at the time, personally tracked them down.
He rubs the side of his nose, picks at a scab, and flicks the head away. “Sorry, mate. Tha’s confidential.”
If at any time beyond this point you have difficulty keeping track of who's who regarding Hero Aliases, or you forget which alias belongs to which person, you can hover your mouse over the alias in question for character clarification if you're reading on a desktop or laptop.
“I thought we ‘heard you out’ the last time.” Cho's glare pierces Harry through the eye holes in her mask.
Leave it to Hermione to discover she has better command over the results of her abilities by writing down the changes to reality she wants and aiming her hand at the page, rather than waving her hands around her, thinking of the vague changes she wants, and getting mixed outcomes. The results have been a marked improvement since Harry and Ron first met her taking on a base of Agency Villains by herself years ago. But even then, her Control over Reality had been a rough power to combat.
“No, I suppose you wouldn’t. In fact, most of society had written him off as having run away. Why else would it have taken so long to find his body on the grounds of his own home?” Her eyes were hard, her voice cold, and her expression rigid. “But, I should thank you—you and your companion. Ill-bred as you both are, you actually bothered to look for him.”
But even as Harry joked, he felt the way the ghostly world around him rippled. He watched as a Veil right from the Department of Mysteries stitched itself together between two trees behind Draco as if to say
Harry hesitates. As he silently stares into Nurse Tonks’s eyes through his lenses, her face falls. “It—That’s not quite it. I . . . .” He looks down to see his hands have balled into tight fists on the desk’s surface. Loosening his fingers, Harry settles on drumming them on the tabletop instead before glancing back up at the stationed nurses. “Each—Each hero . . . tends to have their own way of . . . protecting their real identity. The most commonly known way is, of course, wearing a mask of some variety—”
Harry felt tears gather at the edges of his eyes, and he tightened his grip in Draco’s as the ground raced up to meet them, shattering their perfect, crystalline moment of harmony.
“What?” Harry shouted, afraid Draco couldn’t hear him, afraid to look away because every second with him counted.
Hermione sighed while Ron made an exaggerated gagging sound in the background followed by a muffled “Though, good for you, mate—I guess.”
With a put-upon sigh, Draco takes out his wand and transfigures a nearby broken cobblestone into a pair of shades. “Here, Potter. If you don’t want to be recognised being out and about with me so badly, you might want to try these. Bumble and stumble about like that in Diagon Alley, and folks are sure to know it’s you.”
“It’s good to be courteous if we expect curtesy in return.” Alpha Bee has not removed his gaze from their prisoner.
“Er, I don’t know if that’s actually the case. While Blaizing Fire might have given us the rendezvous point for him and Paper Dracon, I still don’t know how to characterize their relationship,” Harry says. “I mean, Dracon continued looking for him even after he didn’t show up at the exact location—which Dracon himself admitted being a mistake after I caught him.”
Forty-five minutes into the endeavor, Harry sat down on the pavement, merely watching Hermione going at it winding him. During one of the few breaks she took, Malfoy cautiously approached the gate.
—until he reaches a long stone corridor at their bottom. The lights already shine in this underground lair and cast shadows along the walls.
Not receiving a zap, Ron commences in earnest to tug the sharp utensils from where they’re embedded in the wall. “You got
Movement now comes with surprising ease, and Harry uses it to roll onto his hands and knees. His memory falls back into place in bits and pieces. The dock. The henchmen. The pro-villain and the bystanders. Helplessness, then a rush of power that threatened to overflow. Then it did overflow.
When Paper Dracon speaks, the venom’s been replaced by exhaustion. “How about we quit playing around.” He turns to face Harry, dragon skull mask on, and lifts his arms, wrists up and hands clenched. “We both know this’s to arrest me.”
“Sorry. You caught me preparing my dinner. I’d turn it off, but then the noodles will become too saturated.” He gestures at the kitchen table chairs. “Sit. Sit. I’ll put some tea on for you.”
But he stays. He stays as Potter’s still-gloved hands hover about Ms. Adams as he shows her a part of himself he’s hidden from Draco. He stays as Potter whispers words to her that Draco’s ears are ringing too loud to hear. And he stays as Potter quietly excuses himself, swaying a bit on his feet as he stands from his crouch and walks into another section of the flat. Distantly, Draco gathers that he went to the loo.
“Hey, hey, hey! The guy may have changed his behavior around you, but I wasn’t just going to hand you an envelope without knowing what’s in it! He could've stuffed some kind of poison in there!”
Draco files that information away and tries not to analyse it too hard. At least, not right now—not when they have to spend the next several hours together.
“Say . . . .” The man’s not looking at Harry when he twists around to face him. “Are you really a hero?”
“Why, we haven’t seen you around here in forever and a day. We were starting to think you’d forgotten about this Hospital. Isn’t that right, Alastor?”
“More like a good name for myself.” A few seconds pass in silence before Harry realizes what he said.
“Hmm . . . . Well, it certainly is an interesting tactic. And you’re certain that bringing him in will yield the same lack of results as with Blaizing Fire?”
As Harry positioned himself to do the same, his hand, braced against the ground, touched where Draco had been moments before. He nearly yanked his hand back in shock as he found the ground completely dry. Ice flooded Harry’s veins and caused his bones to ache at the realization that, dead as Draco was, the living world no longer felt the imprint of his soul. That some truth lay in the claim that Draco no longer belonged here.
“Hey.” His voice sounds soft and strained to Draco’s ears. “Hey.” His hands hover in front of her, not reaching out to touch.
“What? I—” He involuntarily looks over at the pot on the hob’s back burner instead of the salted cabbage off to its right on the counter, then back at Draco. “I mean, that was
He lifts his hands in a placating gesture as she latches onto the front of his hero costume, evidently unphased by whatever shock she received for doing so. “S-sorry—”
As they dive for Harry and Ron, Harry attempts to shoot them with some of his lightning. Yet the birds remain as dexterous as their living forms, dodging each of Harry’s strikes with ease. Although, to be fair, Harry’s aim has never been that great with his own electrical energy. Still, he feels like he’s failed some kind of test when the birds reach him and Ron, driving sharp scrapes into the exposed skin on their faces.
Harry laughs because it’s true. “So, you got your book, then?” He asks as Hermione—dressed in her violet, full-body spandex costume with a giant
Harry glances down, eyeing the long, jagged, washed-out scars crisscrossing his dark skin. They stretch down his whole body—fingers, toes, and all—from the source scar marring his forehead. By the time he wakes in the morning, they’ll have receded until nothing but the original remains. They’ll stay away until the next time he calls on his power—which would very likely be tomorrow’s patrol.
“It was still something.” He deftly pries off a few of the cards that statically stick to his dealing hand. “Even if it could have turned out to be a trap.”
Everyone back at the Hero Order’s headquarters is less impressed than last time to hear he let Paper Dracon get away from him for a third time. Even Luna expresses her disappointment in him by not inquiring whether he came across the fairies that grant people powers like she normally does after a bout through London.
. Harry opens his eyes again to see Blaizing Fire standing over the prone forms of the three other villains.
He skips over the next door in the corridor as its similar design to the other ballroom door speaks for itself.
However, when Dracon makes a choking noise and collapses to the floor, Harry bolts back to his feet.
again. “We only knew it had been the right one because the doors closed behind us, and metal grating fell down to cover the windows." She wraps her arms around herself. "It was so dark. Only multiple pairs of red lights greeted us. I tried using my powers to yank water in from outside or to bust down the doors, but it was as if we were insulated.” Her chest rises and falls with a shaky breath. “My ability was useless, and Ced had been relying on me since it’s a rarity to find earth at the docks.”
Harry can’t quite place the tone in Dracon’s voice, but he knows it makes him uneasy. He opens his mouth to say that he keeps his eye on most villains he faces off with on a weekly to monthly basis, but Dracon beats him to the punch.
On stiff legs, Harry goes to wheel the trolley into the chamber. His hands shake a little as he enters and sees two figures in his periphery. He’s willing to bet anything that Paper Dracon is unmasked, and, therefore, Harry can’t even look his way to see how he fares.
“Simply brilliant, Mr. Fortescue! My associate and I thank you very much!” Draco grabs the two ice creams and a pair of spoons before Potter can stick his foot in the generous offer any further. He selects a table near the back.
In the distance, he hears Big Ben chiming ten o’clock and, cursing below his breath, wonders how long he’s sat here deliberating. As the night wears on, the temperature will only continue to drop, and then it won’t matter what Harry does with the corpse.
Draco pulled himself out from under Harry, his eyes not leaving his face the entire time. “Whyever would you do that?”
“Department of Creature Incidents. We’re here to collect your statements.” Draco waits an interval of three minutes before knocking again. “Please, open up.”
Harry can hear her swallowing. He wonders if he should put a hand on her arm like he did for Ginny ages ago. Thinking of the shaky ground on which their current relationship stands, he decides against it.
“Oh, like I’m going to take a threat from heroes seriously. What my lot would do to me if I said anything’s guaranteed to be worse.”
“I hope so too.” Harry places a smile on his face that doesn’t reach his eyes behind his mask. “What are you doing nowadays, since you’re discharged from the hospital?”
Harry recognizes Paper Dracon’s humorless laugh. “No. I’m under no illusions. If I was, I might I have tried to go with him.” A loud coughing fit halts his words, and, when he next speaks, his voice comes out hoarse. “But I . . . . I did this for myself. A lifetime of having my future, my actions, and my path, planned, coerced, and laid out for me—For once in my life, I made a decision that felt like a choice.”
The sound of his voice seems to break some kind of spell as Paper Dracon finally turns his head away. With eye slits facing the far wall, the villain’s chest rises and falls in an erratic fashion.
“Just not the testimony?” His nose scrunches as he thinks it over. “But if it’s truly relevant to your investigation, why wouldn’t they give it over to you?”
Taking a leap of Gryffindor faith in his Slytherin instincts, Draco shutters his own expression to mirror Potter’s, and he juts his chin out haughtily. “You’ve been worried you’d attack someone, haven’t you?”
what’s been happening to them!” Harry reached out a hand to touch the newly minted Silver Snitch, but Draco curled his fingers as though to shield the Snitch from another’s touch.
Paper Dracon is lying on his back with his left leg splayed far out—while his right bends his heel toward his body. His right arm stretches above his head as though reaching out for the dragon skull mask several meters away, but the hand stays limp. His left arm remains on his chest, hand twisted in the black fabric over his heart—which Harry hopes still beats.
Following Blaizing Fire’s directions, he strides to the end of the current hallway and turns down the adjacent one. Harry counts the doors until he reaches the third one. Collecting his courage, he gently twists the knob and pushes it open.
While Ron works on the last few troublesome knives, Harry focuses on taking in the damage he’s caused. Multiple scorch marks where the lightning struck litter the red carpeting and the seats. Vice-Net’s on the floor like Fear-Near, groaning. His mask—which resembles an open pair of scissors with the handles being the eye holes and the blades resemble a sharp mustache that extends beyond the mask itself—lies cracked on the floor beside him. All that’s left covering his face is the Venom-like under-mask.
The two of them stay there like that, facing one another on opposite sides of the same crate until Harry’s legs start to ache. Finally, Paper Dracon turns away and sits down, legs dangling over the side of the container at the knees.
Ron clicks his tongue. “Don’t feel too beat up about it, mate. The guy’s always been a tosser. Not really on you for hoping any different.”
“I’m a Slytherin. And a coward. Do you really think that if there was any doubt in my mind you wouldn’t bite me, I’d let you this close? That I’d
Finch-Fletchley nods and visibly suppresses a shudder. “Anyway, I think the masked person yelled out, ‘stop it!’ really loudly—or at least, something to that effect.”
Refocusing back on the conversation, Harry realizes he’s been lost in thought for more time than he’d thought.
That would put forward the notion that they'd done so before. Yet Harry doesn’t remember coming across any dead people with similar marks.
Unfortunately, considering the room is filled to the brim with containers full of steel, Harry knows he can’t quite let his guard down despite the warehouse seeming to be empty. Villains could be hiding anywhere in the maze of crates, counting down to an ambush.
Potter stands up, turning his back on Draco, and lets out a hollow laugh. “Merlin, it’s so funny, isn’t it?" Abruptly, he swivels around to face Draco again, one hand covering his mouth. "All this—this entire time, we’ve been tracking—he’s not—” He cuts himself off and starts pacing again. “God, there’s something wrong with me. I mean, truly—and you’d know, too, wouldn’t you, Malfoy? You’ve always liked to point out the things that’re wrong with me. So, you must’ve noticed.”
On the landing, he nearly jumps out of his skin as he spots Kreacher staring up at him, gnarled hands curled round the stair railing to the attic.
With a sigh, Malfoy sank back down beside his chair, though refused to take it again. “It’s not really about
“Oh,” Harry says, a flash of embarrassment coursing through him. “I only knew your name because you were conscious at the time I rescued you. The others? Not so much.”
The first thing that he sees is the white dragon skull mask, visible like a beacon in the moonlight. He has to strain his eyes to make out the form clad in black sprawled out in the ditch. But when he does, he jolts to his feet and powers up again in a flash. Lightning dances on his fingertips as he prepares for an attack that never comes.
When he’d woken up an hour before noon, his breakfast and a note had been waiting for him in the kitchen. The note inscribed with Hermione’s handwriting claimed she and Ron had left for The British Library, but that Ron had made him breakfast. Beneath Hermione’s signature, in Ron’s scrawl, was a post-script that told Harry Hermione'd brought up the topic of the bookstore again. He said he’d agreed and mentioned Harry’s tentative agreement the night before.
Buying a bouquet of flowers, he takes the bus down to The City of London Cemetery and Crematorium where his parents are buried. It’s a pretty nice place, as far as cemeteries go. Pretty architecture, delightful ponds, beautiful flowers in the warmer months. Still, as he passes different gravestones until he reaches the ones belonging to his parents, Harry can’t help but feel like this place is just like every other burial ground filled with lost loved ones.
Letting out a breath, Harry rakes a hand across his head and ends at the back of his neck. “Tossed me accusatory looks the whole time. Didn’t give me any information in exchange for mine. And I wasn’t allowed back in the building to see the people I couldn’t save.”
Draco hesitates before his drunk brain makes a sudden decision. He reaches out to Potter, holding off long enough for Potter to pull away, before latching onto his robe sleeve. Then he tugs Potter along to the sitting room—which, to his surprise, is empty. Though, a glance at the clock on the wall explains the family's absence as it’s well into the early hours of Christmas Day. When the pair enter the room, the music coming from the Wireless becomes more audible, and Draco realises it's not even Christmas music playing.
“Is that—” Potter moves his head to squint a bit at Draco. “Is that enough? Information, I mean. It all seemed to come out vague—”
Harry automatically goes to speak but realizes what he’s doing at the last second. He shrugs instead. Then he gestures around her toward the window.
Harry motions at the crate and holds up a single finger, the smoke too thick to be talking without wasting time coughing. Then he’s scrambling for the crate. In his excitement, he jams his face into the hole and jolts when he’s met by darkness. Cursing himself for a fool, he pulls away enough that light from the fire peeks through.
Before Harry could open his mouth, Malfoy was snarling from the gates, “So that’s it, then? Giving up after one little snag? You got what you came for, and you’re just going to leave me here?!”
Reluctantly, Harry pulls himself away from the hole in the crate and takes back his position with Ginny.  Even as they leave the building, he finds himself looking back. Particularly when he hears the unmistakable sounds of an engine revving.
“Everyone’s out,” she tells Harry. “Unfortunately, we would all be a hindrance to those fighting. So we’ll hang around the perimeter of the property for one of the Order to escort us out—”
Opening his eyes, it’s still a few moments before they uncross themselves. When they finally do refocus, the tall stature of Paper Dracon comes into view perched on the walled edge of the rooftop.
Harry turns to go, but whips around at the jangle of handcuffs, the scrape of a chair, and a hoarse, “Wait!”
“Oh, plenty!” Malfoy rose from his seat and started floating toward the ceiling. “Lots of plotting to do now that you’ve narrowed my haunting options. Lots of opportunities too. I wonder if I can somehow clog your sink and toilet.”
Slowly, Hermione crosses one leg over the other and glances briefly at Ron. “Okay. If you say so, Harry.”
“Oh, you heard about the interrogation?” She pats at her neon pink hair and darts a quick glance at the window. “Or did you want to ask him a few questions?”
, the hero who saw hope in him when many others wrote him and Blaizing Fire off, sends him letters every week for the next three years. In addition, he advocates for a rehabilitation program to be offered to the other young villains during their sentences to see if they could change for the better too, given the right opportunities.
Harry’s startled to find his electricity stuttering off. Feeling warm under the collar, he prays Dracon didn’t notice, but he knows how unrealistic that would be, particularly given that Harry’s the main light source in the alleyway.
As he walks down the road, contemplating which bus he should catch to Shoreditch, he eyes the cloth in his hand. It feels sturdy to the touch, but its frayed ends display its vulnerability. If this had been worn by someone while the hostage situation occurred, Harry figures that having Hermione analyze it under a microscope would reveal a bloodstain too dark to see with the naked eye on the black fabric.
Potter’s gaze flicks back to Draco’s face, and his look becomes calculating. “I can feel your heartbeat, you know.”
The two of them drag him back into the drawing room. GarGoyle lets go of Harry to slam the door behind them. Vice-Net brings Harry to the center of the room.
An image of Paper Dracon playing with Blaizing Fire and the other young villains flashes through his mind. Harry fumbles the deck in his hand and has to reshuffle the cards. “That’s not what I meant. More like a wager. If I win, you tell me all that you know about the Villain Agency’s plans about the stolen identities and—”
Turning his head, he watches as she seats herself on the bed next to his. Sleepily, he thinks her golden bird mask made to resemble the garb plague-time doctors wore makes her look like a ferryman to the afterlife, particularly with the dim candlelight casting half the mask in shadow. He knows the kindhearted medical hero would likely resent such a thought; so, he keeps it to himself.
Stepping out into the pouring rain once more sets a chill deep into his marrow, and he’s nearly overcome with the desire to step back inside. He shakes the feeling off and creeps on his hands and knees to the left side of the roof.
For once, Draco is fine letting Potter be the center of attention, and not just because that was the entire reason for bringing Potter here. No, Draco’s more than fine being a wallflower because he gets to watch as Potter unwinds more than he has in days—likely weeks. As the night wears on, Potter loses more and more of his layered clothing, until he finally reveals his face to the people he considers family.
“Actually, it’s probably more about my misery than yours.” Draco feels a grimace flit across his face before he can suppress it. “My supervisors are less than fond of me. They’re aware of our history enough that I would probably be the best choice for you, but you’d be the worst choice for me—out of the other available cases, that is.”
The Hero Order had decided to throw a celebration for Draco filling in his hero application papers and for Blaise having his papers approved.
“Oh, well—there were some patients that were brought in from an incident that happened about two miles from here. From the flat explosion? Anyway, I only really know the name of the guy who was conscious, but I’d like to see them all any—”
And that’s definitely not like Theo at all, and Draco feels so lightheaded that he can’t think straight—not that he ever really has—not with Potter looking at him with his burning eyes. Draco decides if Potter really did bite him and that this is some hallucinatory fever dream before death, he’ll take it. “Oh?" His voice comes out thin and shaky, but he presses on. "You’d prefer that over biting, then?”
Harry dodges as Paper Dracon flings some of his paper cranes at Harry. They tilt off course, so Harry doesn’t have to work too hard.
Roughly ten minutes later, he and Ron get split up when Ron has to handle a drunk driver that nearly smashes through a family’s sitting room. At first, they both thought that this was the event they had been waiting for, but it soon became clear it had been a regular DUI case. Harry tells Ron to handle the incident and that he’d be fine on his own for a while.
“Because I always wanted to be one.” His eyes blink rapidly behind his mask’s tinted lenses. “And I knew . . . no matter how anyone viewed me or treated me . . . my actions would define whether I was a hero or not. Eventually, I made Superhero friends who acknowledged who I am. Damn good ones. Still—”
A part of Harry wants to stay and argue, but time is short. Plus, he’s already trusted Fire’s judgement more than once. He’ll have to trust the guy can take care of himself. Nodding once, Harry pockets the notepad and pen, and he heads out the door.
Snatching back up the hand that was incessantly massaging Draco’s chest, Harry said, “I know, but I’ll go with you. That way you don’t have to be afraid.”
Harry ticked them off, “No more bothering me in the shower. No misdeeds that could potentially cause harm to other people—like getting me to drop gardening shears on them from a height. No more ‘eating’ my food. Oh, and could you quit with the decay along the walls? I’d like to have guests of my own over at some point without them thinking I live with Mildew Maggots and Doxies.”
Biting the inside of his cheek, Harry raises his arm above him and feels for the unrest in the atmosphere. When his fingers finally catch on something a thousand meters above his hand, he starts swirling it around, collecting more molecules. Harry can’t see what he’s created, but he can feel its power where he stands.
Malfoy stalled his ascent with the top of his head brushing the concrete ceiling. “Sort of,” he hedged.
here.” Potter sounds farther away than before, as if he’s retreating more to his side of the attic. He backs up far enough that a sliver of light coming from a crack in the roof glances briefly across his face.
As much as he’s tempted to take stock of how the heroes are holding up against their opponents, Harry knows he has to focus on his self-assigned task. From his view on the roof, he casts his gaze about for any figure that looks to be directing their attention to the burning building. A few different suspects catch his eye, some standing apart from the other figures while the others blend in the crowds of people clashing. While Harry thinks it would be a somewhat smart stance for the villains to cloak the perpetrators of the arson in the groups attacking the heroes, he also believes that would make them too vulnerable to being taken out by accident. He doubts the Villain Agency would take such a risk considering how cautiously they’ve behaved thus far. That said, this whole attack would appear to spit in the face of their cautious behavior.
“You should consider yourself lucky that you had fellow heroes surrounding you at the time. Had they not severed your connection when they did, I reckon you’d be out for more than just a day and a half.”
“Well, it’s a bit like this—you’re walking along with someone you think you know, feel you trust. Maybe along the street, in an empty building, or down the hall to your own flat. One moment they’re beside you and the next they’re not.” By the faster rising and falling of his chest, Mr. Hendricks’ breathing seems to quicken. “No, they’re behind you, shoving you against the nearest wall. Next thing you know, her hands are pinning yours above your head, her breath and teeth at the back of your neck. And she whispers and dares you to call out—for anyone. Anyone to-to—”
With speed, Potter ducks away before she can put her arms around him and holds his hands up in a warding-off position.
Harry jolts upright on the couch, adrenaline spiking in his veins. He had forgotten about the odd lettering he had seen on the arm before passing out.
“You had to have tortured him.” His voice rises until he’s shouting. “There’s no way in hell he’d give it up otherwise.”
“Assuming the Polyjuice theory, since Elf magic should be able to track down just about anyone and anything, I’ll forgo asking much about what the vampire looked like when they were with you since looks can be changed in the magical world. And enough time has passed that they could have cycled through several other appearances." He tries not to dwell on the lost time between now and when Potter was bitten nearly six months ago. There have been cases with much longer delays of years and even decades before victims came to Draco's department. "Rather, I think we’ll focus on the description of behavior.”
Being awash in the other half of Ron’s power is a lot like being submerged in a hot bath—if hot baths also had the possibility of exploding on you. But Harry believes he’s been drained enough today by the
“Me,” Harry says in return. He takes off the fiery skull mask since he doesn’t like the sound his electricity’s making against its surface.
Turning back around, Harry sees Dracon in almost the same position he’d left him in. Only the tense set of the villain’s shoulders betray how much those two words must have cost him.
Not the set of circumstances in which Draco wanted to hear that last sentence from Potter, Draco thinks in a distant way. Still, his mouth says, “Sure,” before he really thinks of the consequences. But by the time his mind actually catches up, it’s already been said, and Potter seems to relax against the door jam. And if it means he can leave Potter somewhat content after this rough meeting, then he really couldn’t give much of a damn about rules and consequences.
Lord, he’s so tired he can’t think straight. By the sound of Ron’s laboured breathing next to him, Harry’s willing to bet he’s just as exhausted. They can’t deal with two more Supervillains. But running away would leave them too vulnerable.
Resolutely, both he and Cho return to the makeshift “non-poisoned residents” medical ward. Harry is put under strict orders to not enter a lighted room or think for too long. That second order from Poppy is so impossible for Harry to follow, considering all the different events and information swirling about in his brain, that Poppy is forced to knock him out for several hours at a time. For Harry, the unconscious state is better than all the thoughts crowding for his attention.
Taking several calming breaths, Harry carefully begins powering up, willing the flow to be weak enough that it doesn’t tear into the gown.
Potter pulls back but not entirely away from Draco, and his face isn’t closed off or twisting in disgust or— “Malfoy, I’d like to kiss you.”
Harry’s so floored by the willing admission that he only realizes he’s been staring blankly at the place Dracon stood only after he fled—again.
Numbness floods Harry’s senses. Distantly, he thinks he can hear Dracon’s voice calling out to him, saying something unintelligible.
!” Dracon has lifted himself onto one knee and is waving his arms about again. All the paper cranes that collapsed along with their director come back to life. He summons them into a swarm above his head. When all the cranes settle into their places, they form a giant hammerkop.
, someone he grew up with, someone he’s spent hours memorizing every feature of—it all feels real in a way it hasn’t before. And Draco, coward that he’s always been, wants to
Since the attack, while spread even thinner than before, the uninjured heroes—both new and old—have taken up the patrols of the city.
While Harry knows he’s probably not the kind of hero his parents expected him to be, he still hopes that they would think he’s a good one.
With vigor, she set into her spellwork, aiming at the drive’s threshold, the gates, the hedges, and the ground. Over the next hour and a half, Hermione tried a variety of charms, hexes, counter-curses, and jinxes in relative silence apart from occasionally requesting Draco to “try crossing now.”
Draco stomps down the childish part of him that wants to snap back. “Just because something presents a... challenge doesn’t mean I hate it.”
all right?” He’s brought a hand up under his mask, presumably to rub at his face. His shoulders still shake. “Ah-
Harry nods along as he listens, slipping on his hero mask. It’s strange pulling it on after already being charged up. He actually has to tug strands that stick to the inside with static out the opening at the top of his pullover mask. Normally, he’d unknot the string in the back, but he doesn’t trust how steady his hands are at the moment.
Creeping his way to the front of the warehouse, he peers around the edge to see Hermione and Ron—along with the younger heroes they brought for backup—losing a fight with the gathered Agency villains. He spots enough veteran villains to know the Agency isn’t playing around with this ambush.
Draco’s breath leaves him—which is good because otherwise he might sob. And Potter’s not touching him, not really, but it’s close enough. “Hold tight and brace yourself, Potter.”
“Not until you get treatment.” Harry notes how Dracon’s back tenses more and wonders when it tensed in the first place.
; we should try to talk to the witnesses again. Unless . . . the police gave us what information they have on the arm already?”
It’s starting to crowd a bit around them as other customers become curious over the commotion. Some even call out their own greetings to Draco. The smile Draco plasters on his face feels more like a grimace the longer they stand there. But if his high society breeding is good for anything, it’s that it ingrained in Draco an ability to bullshit politeness.
She stops and turns her head towards him, the decorative blue feathers on her blue butterfly face mask swaying. “Alpha Bee, I wasn’t aware that the new generation of heroes knew of me.”
Pacing the room one last time, Harry discovers a particularly squeaky floorboard. He rocks on it, then taps it with his foot. Beneath it is some kind of hollow.
Harry cuts off the thought as he realizes that Paper Dracon doing so would be more of a threat than a sign of relaxation. He wonders if Dracon is purposefully keeping his hands away from his pockets to ease Harry, before cursing himself for thinking it.
is not happy to find out the both of them have been out of bed. She lectures Harry and Cho about how she doesn’t have the time to re-heal them if they exacerbate their conditions. Considering Cho is dealing with burn wounds while Harry handles a concussion, Poppy spends an extra five minutes warning Harry about the dangers of too much light hurting him.
As he hears what Harry says, the muscles in the villain’s arms and legs do an odd, twitchy spasm, disrupting his preening pose. “I beg your pardon?” Now, he shifts so that his hands are placed on his hips and he leans toward Harry.
“Well,” he says, twisting the paper between his fingers, “I haven’t really run into you during your patrols since the—”
Dracon continues as if Harry had never spoken. “Take my alias, for example. Obviously, people know what Paper Dracon would represent! Paper and dragon—that’s me, the paper controlling dragon.”
As much as Harry wants to bust down the door, he knows he stands no chance against two professional Supervillains. His goal is to figure out a way to get Dracon out alive, not get the both of them killed.
Harry takes the villain up on the offer and tracks Dracon’s gloved hand as it withdraws the flat square piece.
Hermione answers the door in jeans and a pink jumper, her deep twist crochet braids tied up in a ponytail. “Harry! Where’ve you been? It’s over an hour since you should’ve been back.”
“Sorry you didn’t do it yourself?” He brought his hands behind his back and stalked towards Harry. “I mean, you did give it a good go in Sixth Year.”
Poppy Petal’s Control over Herbs allows her to speed up the healing process once they enter the body of her patients, as well as amplify their effects. Once she’s finished, Harry feels much more relaxed and less like his appendages want to fall off.
“I know you’re in pain, but I’m still handling your bad leg. You sure you want to get smart with me?”
“That’s what it sounds like.” Hermione says, “Do you think they have anything to do with why they stole the hero identities and have started capturing different Superheroes?”
Harry has a nice cut of his own on his right arm and can feel at least one broken rib from the car’s point of impact. “Bloody brilliant.”
The voice comes right next to his ear. “You may strut around all of London like you’re somebody. But in the eyes of the law? Barely even a child playing dress-up.”
“Well, he seems to have re-entered the fold nicely.” Harry uses his head to gesture toward the building Blaizing Fire and his cohorts had stood upon.
Peeking above the wall lining the roof’s edge, Harry can see the three figures much better, and he’s certain that they are the ones maintaining the fire. Even if the three of them hadn’t had their arms raised in the Hero Order’s direction, Blaizing Fire’s mask would have been a dead giveaway.
“Oh, right. You probably got the worst of it after Ron. He threw himself on top of me, you know. To shield me from the blast. How stupid.”
He lifts a gloved hand. “It’s stopped raining.” Shifting his attention to the battlefield below, Dracon stuffs a hand in one of his pockets. “It’s been real fun, hero. But villain duty calls.”
Sighing, Poppy Petal grabs the water for him. She helps him sit up in bed and presses the glass into his hands.
“I know!” Hermione’s voice sounds further away than it should. Suddenly, both the fog and smoke blow away with a harsh wind.
When she tugs the door open until it catches on the chain, he finds himself shocked by her bravery. Out of the crack, a small sliver of her face peeks through. “Can I help you?”
“I—I know, Draco. Believe me, I know.” He glanced at Ron, helpless, before turning back to Draco. “Are you sure you don’t know how you were able to—?”
“Think nothing of it. After all, I do owe you my life, and you were involved that night. Least I could do is give you some kind of explanation.”  He stands up and clasps Harry’s gloved hand. “Though, I hope after this, I get to go ahead with forgetting this whole incident.”
“Where’d you get this address from?” Potter could probably see Draco’s flinch at the sudden sound of his voice too. “It’s under Fidelius.”
“Then we just have to wait until they’re discharged, which shouldn’t be too long, now—it’s been over two weeks.”
“I was at m’usual pub. Not the Leaky but a Muggle one—the Red Lion. They had this new bartender—quite the lovely one. I tried chatting ‘em up almost every time I went. And one day, the bartender... not exactly chatted me up right back, but offered to help me out of the bar when some of the other drunkards started getting handsy. We were out the back entrance and—” Ms. Adams’ hands tighten against the fabric of her robes.
“Yes. I don’t know why you’re so surprised. You let that thing suck on your energy like a child does a juice box. And—lay back down! I just got you recovered to the point that you've awoken.” She firmly guides Harry back into the bed. “Don’t go overexerting yourself.”
Harry’s voice cracks the first time he opens his mouth to use it, so he tries again. “Did we get them all back? Or are there files missing?”
“Quite the rough night. And you’re sure you saw no other instances of the accomplice in the flat after that? Or indications that he escaped?”
Ron’s arms drop for a second as he cries out, then rise up again to swat at the bird buzzing about his head.
He tells them he arrived after the explosion, rescued the remaining victims, and saw little else in the debris and smoke. Aside from the brief tidbit the injured teenager gave Harry, he has nothing else to provide the police.
“So... why don’t you tell us why you’re sweating so much. Please. We’re here to help you and the vampire’s other victims. Withholding important information could hinder that.”
“I-I-I didn’t—Please! You don’t trust me, and you shouldn’t—but . . . . Come on. They’ve probably surrounded the warehouse by now!”
says, “Please! Forgive his insolent tongue, Voldemort, sir. He’s been in isolation for four days and no doubt has grown restless.”
“New one I’ve been saving up—but fuck it.” He uncurls his hand to reveal a miniature paper swan. As the swan sits on his gloved palm, it starts to shake until its wings beat, and it flies right off the villain’s hand. Only, the bird doesn’t remain small. Instead it grows with each flap.
“Strange? How have I been strange? It was strange for me to be acting the way I was for the last month!” The letter shakes in his hand as he goes to pick it up. Frustrated, he drops it again onto his textbook. “I needed the reminder that he’s a villain.”
Mr. Park hesitates in the doorway when he’s ushered inside and keeps his eyes cast down as he shuffles over to Draco. When it seems apparent Mr. Park is having trouble finding the courage to lift his head and view the line-up, Draco pats his arm reassuringly.
He takes it and moves to affix it in place on his head over the under-mask. “I don’t know why you’d help me. Or why you’d risk Voldemort’s ire. You’re either incredibly daft, or you’re barking. Haven’t figured out which, yet.”
“You could say that,” Harry says. “Though, I was hoping you might be able to enlighten me about something as well. May I come in?”
Harry and Dracon are near enough to the spacious cell to watch it open and a crowd of beaten-down Superheroes come out.
“Er . . . I don’t really know, Ron.” His friend’s stress is starting to bleed over into Harry. Thinking fast, he says, “How about, instead of looking at the way the villains might be using some kind of similar technique for evil purposes, how ‘bout we look at how you use yours.”
He swallows as Potter makes eye contact. “You didn’t have control over what happened to you, but you control what happens next, Potter. So, who do you consent to becoming?”
Harry thinks back to all Paper Dracon’s said about what it means to be a villain. “You really don’t have to, you know.”
Harry settled on focusing on his eyes, which still sparked with the life of malice, instead of the giant hole at the center of Malfoy’s chest that remained a dark void. “You’re really dead then? S’not some illusionary trick?”
Before they forget he’s even there, Harry waves his hands to get their attention. “Also, one more thing.”
Tracey takes one of the hands away from her face to wave it dismissively at Harry without looking at him. “They threatened me the day they took it. I saw them out the window as they carted it off, saying they’d ‘know’ if I ever talked. Tried to recruit me since. I-I knew Kevin—was a year below him in school. I-If they could get to him, then . . . .”
Paper Dracon laughs in that wicked way that worms its way under Harry’s skin. “What? That’s all? Your big idea after torturing the rendezvous point out of Blaizing Fire is to just
“Look, I know this is difficult for you, but the best thing for us to do right now is to head back to the base and see what aid we can get,” Hermione says. “We can’t afford to lose any more heroes right now.”
Coughing into his fist, Harry scrambles for what to say. “Yes, but, uh, I didn’t injure him and leave him in a ditch to die. I think it’s a little different.”
The air surrounding the complex is oppressive on Harry’s lungs when he arrives on the scene. Not wasting any time, Harry searches out for sparks of life and, upon pinpointing three weak pulses, rushes inside.
“Well, he didn’t come in after us to help his mates, did he?” Ron scratches his chin. “Maybe a policeman got him.”
“She believes a few more days of bed rest and not using my powers should bring me back to my normal self.”
Er . . . Uh. No. No, I didn’t look for anyone else. Figured they’d be long gone. And, uh, his injuries were far too generic.”
Draco tears his eyes away from the display only when he hears a choked noise beside him. He just catches sight of the edge of Potter’s cloak as it slips through the door. Glancing back at the interrogation room reveals the Aurors trying to placate Mr. Hendricks while he blinks around at them in confusion, the glazed look in his eyes growing dimmer.
They follow him in as he walks over to his kitchen where steam puffs out from under several pot lids.
and mimics her pose. “You probably wouldn’t be the great hero you are if you didn’t feel regret over the people you couldn't save.”
Steeling himself one last time, Draco slips up the steps and pushes the trap door open. With the overcast sky outside, the attic is coated in darkness. A few precious seconds pass while his eyes adjust; he’d cast
“I knew I couldn’t stay here in Britain after that.” Her other hand rises to rest atop his. “I let my grief guide me away. Traveled a lot with my family and stayed in touch with friends. I tried to move on. Took me three years to realize I hadn't. Being back feels worse, but I can't keep running.”
After an eternity, Paper Dracon shrugs it off and waves a beckoning hand at Harry. “Well, come on then.”
“Did you go along with the plan to lure him to the ambush site so as to curry his favor by letting him go? Were you hoping to ingratiate yourself with him? Maybe see for yourself what it’s like to play hero?” The hissing voice pauses. “Did you think you could escape what you are? Do you honestly believe that when that hero looks at you, he could see anything more than a villain?”
“Mister Malfoy is always welcome in the most Noble and Ancient House of Black.” Kreacher steps aside, gesturing to the rest of the house in welcome.
With respect to this, Draco keeps his voice low. “I said it’d be an uncomfortable situation that involves being around other people.”
hurls more scissors, and even a pocket knife, their way. However, instead of clattering against the wall uselessly like last time, the sharp objects curve as they pass over the pew. The pair has to dodge again as the blades skewer the seating from the back.
or with Potter's condition. By the time they arrive, Draco still isn’t any closer to fitting the pieces together.
The villain’s face is turned slightly towards the arm reaching out, so Harry can see that the black under-mask he wears is as severely damaged as the rest of his suit. Normally, the under-mask functions as a generic coverall. All the Villain Agency members wear them. They cover the entire head like a ski mask with no mouth hole and the eye holes done up with white fabric. Harry remembers calling him Venom the first time he saw it, and Paper Dracon sputtering comically before sending a particularly nasty barrage of attacks at Harry. Since then, Harry has learned that Paper Dracon wears the dragon skull face mask for identification.
“But that’s the nature of a hero, right?" Harry says, thinking back to what Cho said earlier. "To care even when it hurts like hell.”
“Ah, yes, well... Nothing that a good Warming Charm can’t solve.” Draco’s eyes slowly adjust to the dim lighting, and he realises that Potter’s made the room brighter than the attic—though that isn’t all that high a standard. As the moments tick by, he may actually get a better feel for Potter’s condition than he could during their last encounter. For right now, though, he catches Potter pursing his lips like he’s swallowed a lemon before the expression smooths out.
Harry had arrived at the mansion after dark, feeling exposed wearing only a carbon copy of the Villain Agency henchman standard black jumper, tan trousers, Venom under-mask, and all. Even worse, if he hopes to remain unrecognized, he can’t afford to power up. And in the event he
His villainous rival needs medical attention, no doubt about that. This would be Harry’s prime opportunity to finally put the wanted criminal behind bars if he was certain the police would provide him with the necessary treatment.
Harry spun on his heel and bore witness to Narcissa Malfoy standing in all her evanescent elegance at the edge of the grove, her Slytherin-silver night robe wrapped around her and her left hand clutching the two ends closed at the throat. “I, er.” He looked around him; Draco had disappeared.
“I believe so,” Hermione says. “Lavender knows her girlfriend well enough to know what to say. Plus, Mr. Patil told me he, Mrs. Patil, and Padma spent the last several days shoving everything remotely metallic out the door. And yes, Harry, it’s still working fine. Your quick-fix should hold until he can get an appointment at the repair shop.”
Placing a gentle hand on one of Harry’s arms, Apha Bee’s face turns serious even as parts of his beard begin to rise up from electricity. “All right,
Harry didn’t like the way the moonlight reflected in her eyes, like she was so empty inside that the light easily filled her up and pooled in her irises. Unbidden, he recalled how she had lied to a mass murderer solely to find her son, how she could be capable of anything with him ripped away from this world. He suppressed a shudder under her razor gaze.
Feeling hot under the collar, Harry says, “Actually, I reset the bone. After Dracon let me re-break it.”
Nurse Moody’s gaze hardens. “But he’s still not allowed in like that. We gotta watch our backs, too, after all. And the backs of our patients.”
“Still doesn’t explain why he’s able to move as fast as he does.  Even after nearly collapsing, he can make a quick getaway—”
Fighting off the urge to smile, Harry says, “Taking in the view. Why’re you out here? It’s your party, isn’t it?”
Hermione shoots a glare towards Ron. “I’ve been thinking—if the Villain Agency keeps up its tactic of picking off the older heroes, would they really need to steal our identities in the end? Think about it. If all the people who are left to defend London and the rest of Britain are the younger heroes, defeating us should be much easier for them. Compared to the older heroes, we’re much less experienced when it comes to using our powers, and there would be less of us out there to stand against the might of the entire Villain Agency—new and old villains.”
Plopping in the chair, Harry locks his gaze onto the white eye patches of the villain’s under-mask. “So . . . . How’re you?” He didn’t really expect an answer to the question and is therefore unsurprised by Fire’s continued silence. “I actually came to ask a few follow-up questions, if you don’t mind.”
Harry walked up to her and laid a bracing hand on her arm. “I’m sure, Hermione. As long as it works as intended.”
Starting to understand what the villain is getting at, Harry works to remove his own Agency-standard trousers in exchange for Fire’s more distinct ones—careful to move the communicator over to Fire’s trousers pocket. He goes to hand Blaizing Fire the clothing he wore, but the second they leave Harry’s body, Hermione’s copy of an Agency uniform dissolves into thin air.
As the group enters, Harry finds it’s not hard to spot the new evidence as it lies on the center table as though awaiting dissection.
“T-thanks.” He takes a minute to regain his composure. “Paper Dracon was involved in the kidnapping case.”
It’s not like Harry can complain, either. This was his idea. Or at least part of it. Hermione had been the one to suggest temporary contacts that make his eyes itch instead of wearing glasses that could easily fall off and blind him. (“They’re not attached to your head, Harry, like the tinted lenses on your mask!”) Of course, Harry had asked why not add a pair to the mask’s design like she had the time he impersonated Blaizing Fire, to which she’d said that it would be too dangerous to alter the design of the under-mask without the identification mask covering it.
“My heartbeat? Why wouldn’t you—” Understanding enters Potter’s eyes and floods his face full of hope. “Y-you do?”
That jolts Harry wide awake. Mad-Eye is considered one of the top professional heroes in London. His Control over Sight makes him nearly impossible to sneak up on, as well as makes him the top-line pick for any security detail.
“Yeah?” Without Harry keeping him at bay, Ron comes within ten centimeters of Blaizing Fire’s masked face. “Want to elaborate on that?”
He takes pressure off the hand under his foot, and it gets whisked from underneath him. Replacing his foot atop the mask, Harry watches as the villain cradles the hand close to his chest. Now that he’s this near, Harry can hear the ragged, stuttered breaths coming from the villain.
Harry turns over in bed after the door closes behind them. If his powers had any latent self-healing ability, now would be a good time for him to discover it.
Harry knows the bastard’s enough of a prick to rub a dog the wrong way, so it’s not really a matter of whose shit list he’s on. Rather, it’s a matter of who’s ballsy or skilled enough to challenge him and cause serious damage.
No doubt he’s already in the warehouse somewhere, waiting for Harry to show. To trap or to talk to him, Harry still doesn’t know. Part of him doesn’t want to find out, but an even larger part tells him to just rip the bandage off and be done with it.
we’ve hurt each other before that I knew. I’ve seen the worst of you, Harry—dragged it out of you, even. Just as you’ve seen the worst from me. And I know you’ll punch, kick, insult, hex a person—but you’d never choose to do something like
Falling back to the ground hurt, but Harry is getting used to ignoring the pain. “What’s happening down there?” he asks Paper Dracon’s back.
They stay embraced like that for a while. Only when a particularly nasty explosion occurs do Harry and Dracon break apart.
Carefully, he moves his right hand into the box and takes out one of the little bits. Feeling it between his thumb and pointer finger, he confirms that the material is paper.
“What’s . . . ?” Her grip tightens around the sheet of paper, and she glances sharply back up at Harry. “Who . . . ?”
“Yes.” The beat is slow and too small to be normal for a human, but it’s there. A smile spreads across Draco’s face as he runs the back of his free hand down Potter’s cheek. “Probably for the best. You make a terrible vampire.”
When they landed, Draco cleared his throat, shuffled his feet, and started pulling his hand away. Having none of that, Harry leveraged his hold on Draco’s hand to yank him closer.
Paper Dracon hops down from the roof, a dozen paper cranes lightening his fall. He limps toward Harry, stopping just before reaching the lamplight. “Bit quiet this evening.”
“Ah!! Customers!” Mr. Fortescue toddles out from the back, cheeks filling with delighted colour. “Not even this dreadful weather’s enough to chill your young hearts, eh?”
was! I want to go out without feeling like people are staring at me, or like there are eyes burning holes into my back. I’m tired of thinking that—that
That plan worked until they reached the Manor gates at the end of the drive where Malfoy’s form rippled as he tried to cross into the street, like a dog getting shocked by an electric collar.
“I’m willing to bet this whole thing starts and ends with him.” Without waiting for more of a reply, Harry wades into the crowd of jostling bodies battling it out.
“Oh.” She pulls away and looks down a moment. Then, clasping her hands, Hermione looks up at them with wide eyes. “Don’t wanna wait in line by m’self.”
He had attacked and killed the two heroes in their home just outside of London, just like he did with all heroes he goes after. The only hiccup occurred when he tried to snuff out the life of Lily and James’s son, a child one year old. Rumor has it that Voldemort’s villain power is quite terrible and is nearly insurmountable in battle—hence why all heroes would lose against him.
He arrives at the covered dock shed where the Agency’s villains appear to be stacking a large cruiser with sealed crates—most of them wearing indistinguishable black from head to toe. Harry creeps along the outer edge of the shed until he reaches the entryway and waits for an opening to sneak inside.
Draco sighs, the air pushing through his teeth in a hiss, and turns fully to face Potter. “Do you really think I couldn’t have a job where my employer doesn’t hold resentment for my past? Because they’re a Knut a dozen. You saw those witches and wizards back in the Owl Emporium; all of them were practically falling over themselves to flatter me, touch me, assure me that
Draco takes another step forward, and they’re suddenly so close! With hesitant and halting movements, Draco leans his head down to Harry’s upturned, masked face. He hovers just before his lips touch the cheek of the dragon skull mask, waiting for Harry to pull away.
With a light tread, Harry makes his way across the container until he’s beside Dracon. He stares down at the motionless villain, checking for any sleight of hand or sign of cheap tricks. When he finds none, Harry slowly levers himself down until his legs run parallel with Dracon’s down the container’s side.
When Malfoy righted himself, he interlocked his fingers over the tabletop, his face a mask of stone. “So. Ground rules?”
Mouth suddenly dry, Harry says, “W-well—I, uh, treated . . . .” He coughs into his hand again, and the other hand fiddles with the back of his mask. “I set it in a splint.”
“They’re up there, aren’t they?” Mr. Hendricks lifts his blue eyes to the one-way glass. “The person who ‘identified’ me?”
Shrugging, Harry shuffles the deck and sets up a game of solitaire. “Why did you give me your rendezvous point with Paper Dracon?”
“What?” He yanks his arm out of the villain’s grip. Sure, he had expected as much. But the sting from the admission blindsides him.
As Harry turns back around with Dracon’s costume ensemble cradled in his arms, he keeps his head facing the wall next to him. All the while, he feels like his skin is on fire from Dracon’s gaze.
All three of them sit there in silence for a little longer before Ron turns to Harry. “Did Poppy Petal tell you when you’ll be discharged?”
He-he’s gotta get out of here. There has to be a way out of here. The walls are closing in. Small, so small. God, is that him panting?
When Westminster Palace comes into view, people are still scattered in the streets as they try to run from whatever danger Harry and Ron are about to head towards. Harry recognizes a Member of Parliament as he dashes by the side street they came down. Without thought, he grabs the man by the sleeve. “What’s going—”
It’s faded and hazy around the edges in comparison to Draco’s sharply focused one peering over Potter’s shoulder, but it’s there. From the bright green eyes to the jagged lightning scar, the unkempt black hair to the round glasses, it’s Potter. Even with the grey-tinged skin and hollowed cheeks—softened by the lighting and the evening among friends—it’s Potter.
The slight shift in Blaizing Fire’s head provides Harry the only indication that he even glances at the deck.
He tumbled through the air and stopped a hair’s breadth from the ground which now glittered about him as though covered in morning frost. Upon righting himself, he came face to face with the garden in much the same state as the grass. As he walked into the trees and shrubbery, he discovered that despite the fantastical shine from afar, the vegetation had a thin look to it, like cobwebs were stretched over the real deal underneath and Harry could just reach out to brush them away.
Still, after fifteen minutes pass over the time Potter said to meet him, Draco knocks on the wood and calls out, “You ready, or what, Potter? Should I just g—”
Draco raises his hand to knock, then pauses. “Aren’t you going to take those off? You might scare her off, dressed like that.”
The world outside the smoking dock shed greets the three of them with fresh air, an ambulance, a fire engine, and several police cars. Harry and Ginny are wrapped in blankets as the paramedics check them over for serious injuries while Ron gets loaded in the ambulance.
“To be honest, I don’t really blame him for jumping out of the way of those attacks. He’d already been taking loads of hits.”
Supposedly, when he tried to use his powers to kill the child, the distressed baby, in return, had used his underdeveloped powers for a deadly mix. The child, Harry, had evidently called lightning down from the sky and into the house, striking both himself and Voldemort.
“Hmm,” Narcissa hummed, a small smirk on her face. When she finally stood and started her walk back toward the Manor, she stopped at the grove’s edge. “Mr. Potter?”
Harry gets startled by the sting of disappointment that goes through him. Whether that disappointment is aimed at Blaizing Fire or himself, Harry does not know. What he does know is that he has to make up for whatever he helped cause—right now.
The door swings open, and Harry comes face to mask with the Supervillain who killed his parents and tried to kill him a decade and a half ago. It takes a few stunned seconds for Harry to take in the bald, gnarled, and splotched head of Voldemort who turns red eyes on him.
“From what I know of Ced, I think he wouldn’t want you to think that of yourself. In the end, he chose the path of someone who loves you, putting your life before his own.” Harry stares up at the half-moon. “You shouldn’t feel guilty over a fate he chose himself.”
Harry turns his head to get a better look at the newcomers, some of their conversation washing out due to a combination of his panting breaths and the ringing in his ears and the villain groaning next to him.
With Dracon’s coat in hand, and, without looking, Harry feels with his free hand for where Paper Dracon’s face would be. He gets as far as touching what must be the joint between shoulder and neck before Dracon yanks away from Harry’s touch. But he now has a good enough estimate.
“I dunno. Do you really think he would go to the trouble of handing me the letter if his plan was to trap you there?  I mean, it was very likely that I would have looked at the letter myself, so it’s not like I wouldn’t know where you were.”
One of them asks him to play a round of football with them. The goal posts consist of a knocked-over fruit stand and the mouth of an alleyway with fishnet stretched across it.
He was rewarded by a small smile from Draco. “Yeah. Right, then,” Draco said. “Ready to get your arse kicked, Potter?”
The vampire tilts his head, considering. Then he gives them that same charming look from earlier, only now the fangs twist it into something sinister. “All right. I’d be up for it.”
Harry feels his jaw working as words fight one another for the right to come out. He stuffs his hands in his pockets. While he’s not made a habit of gambling, he’d bet the other two heard his teeth click together when he forces himself to swallow his words.
They both dash toward the Palace to investigate as well as dodge another blow from Richard. Upon reaching the first smashed gargoyle, Harry and Ron wonder no longer.
“Yeah.” Harry darts a quick look at the three people on the other side of him, now holding one another. “And preferably before we get anyone near us injured.”
“But you have your whole life ahead of you! Fuck, Potter, you survived the Dark Lord. Don’t tell me you won’t survive me.”
He’s lucky that it catches the villain by surprise and sends him off balance. He’s unlucky that the villain grabs hold of Harry’s wrist and drags Harry with him off the crate. He’s even unluckier that the villain manages to shift their positions midair so that Harry’s the one that breaks the fall.
Once Harry reaches the girl, she looks up, startled—either because he was conscious or alive, Harry did not know.
“Scared, Potter?” Draco tilts his head back, and Potter’s eyes trace the curve of his neck. “I’m not.”
Ron runs a hand through his hair. “Well, you did have us quite worried for a little bit there, not knowing what was keeping you.” He shoves the dishes in the sink. “Hermione wanted to head out right at 11:20, but I wanted to wait and see. I mean, I know you can handle yourself, so I figured it'd only be something you’d need our help with if you weren’t home by midnight.”
A shout rings out in the alleyway as Harry reopens the break. Quickly, Harry re-aligns the bone properly. With one hand, he tugs open the first aid kit he left lying on the ground. Taking out a rail-thin piece of wood, he lines it up against the side of Dracon’s leg. “Hold that in place, would you?”
“There’re plenty of things that I want.” Harry watches Dracon’s shoulders hunch.  “But not in return for this.”
Harry arrives back at the Weasley household, and it’s more boisterous than he remembers it being for weeks on end. He grabs Ginny’s arm as she goes to pass him in the hall. “What’s going on?”
Without thought, he swings into the building, landing on an office floor. His trainers crunch the broken glass beneath him. Shaken from the experience, Harry takes precious time to collect himself.
—what the hell.” Dracon’s hands come up and scrabble at the articles shoved at his face. He goes to lower it once he gets a firm hold of the items, and Harry immediately looks away. “Okay, I get it. You don’t want to look at me for some reason.”
Fully out in the corridor, Harry pulls the door shut behind them. He tries the handle and finds it locked; vaguely, Harry can hear the
Glancing around him, Harry spots smaller stacks of crates. He nods to himself as he walks over to the smallest one, climbs up, and leaps to the next highest. Once Harry makes it to a stack that’s even with Dracon, he jumps over the stacks until he lands on the crate where the villain stands.
“The Aurors searched the Manor and its grounds when you failed to appear for your Wizengamot hearing. They would’ve found you,” Harry said.
He mentally slaps himself. Not what he needs to be focused on right now. And, he already knew by the gloves Paper Dracon wears all the time that he has slender fingers.
worked together and helped people inspired me to become a hero!” He glances down at his sparking hands. “Even though it’s difficult.”
“Not like we ask for permission before punching them, either. Certain things you expect when entering a fight. Besides,” Harry flashes back to the incident with the mechanical arm, “I’d say your ability acts as a way of restraining someone rather than causing any lasting harm. Don’t know where I’d be right now had you not cut off my connection with that mechanical arm.”
Excitement thrumming through Harry, he quickly thinks on how best to communicate what he wants. With care, he grasps Paper Dracon’s bare fingers with his gloved ones, squeezes once, then drags his hand down to touch the manacle. He does this twice more before gently shaking at the coat covering Dracon.
“—can’t believe it took me that long to realize you’d been bribing them,” Harry was saying two minutes before the world tilted on its axis again.
“Hmm . . . I say he might have the right idea not trusting anyone. Prolly not easy, what ya do. Always gotta watch your back.”
When it became clear Malfoy would add nothing more, Harry felt his right eye twitch. Then an idea struck him. “Wow, Draco. You died in the
The kitchen links to what appears to be a dining hall, elaborate with its long wooden table with intricate designs carved into its legs spanning most of the room and its Persian Rugs covering the buffed, wood floor. Heavily detailed paintings of forests and meadows line the walls, and two crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling.
Draco lets out a breathless laugh. “Not bad? Well, hopefully you’ll show me the ropes in the months to come.”
As they start to creep into the next half hour mark, Ron suddenly grows eerily calm. He taps a finger against the tabletop, staring down Blaizing Fire through both their masks. “You know what I think we should do?”
“Not with your shop, my good man. Rather with a tenant of yours.” Draco flashes the warrant he has, whipping it out from within his pocket. “If you’d be so kind as to show us the way.”
While Harry has been divulging what little he knows of the situation to the one officer, the other one has been asking the teenager more questions whilst a paramedic attends to his head injury.
“Okay,” Harry says, shutting his notepad. “Thank you for taking the time to go over that again for me. Couldn’t have been easy for you, all things considered.”
“I’m not a monster who attacked all those people. You’re all wasting your time here with me when the real one’s still out there—I mean, I don’t even
“Yeah.” Harry’s right foot taps the linoleum. “Except, just recently, Paper Dracon said he thought Blaizing Fire gave away the rendezvous point so we’d have Dracon and let Fire go free in exchange.”
By the angle of his head, Potter’s obviously staring at Draco’s held out hand and, just like First Year, doesn’t move to take it. But he doesn’t Disapparate away either. He straightens as Mrs. Weasley bears down upon them.
Ignoring the challenge entirely, Draco holds out the stack of paperwork he’s brought with him. “I’m here to track down the vampire that bit you.”
“Does it have something to do with the machine you got into a spat and blew up a bunch of flats with the night I found you in a ditch?”
The giant paper snake slithers the rest of the way up the stairs and curls around Voldemort, blocking his path in any direction. Hovering over the Supervillain, at Dracon’s orchestration from down below, the snake opens its mouth to reveal sharp paper fangs. Although its hiss is silent, the snake’s threat still makes Harry shudder a little from where he sits.
Harry takes his mask out of the hoodie pocket, and Ron retrieves his eye mask from a pocket on the inside of his jacket. A long, orange bandana with holes for his eyes, it wraps around and cover the top half of his head to tie neatly at the back of his neck, making Ron look a tad like Westley from
“Well, there were two explosion-related incidents—a botched robbery at some business and a kidnapping-turned-murder in the residential area—”
Harry feels split on the matter. He knows they can’t keep being sitting ducks, but just like Hermione had pointed out when the trio discussed the option together, taking such an action without quality information could lead to mutual destruction of both organizations.
“For the most part, it was pretty dark in that room—but after the explosion, I caught a good look at one of them.”
As he reaches the other side of the square, the hidden building fully materializes before his eyes. Draco gives himself credit for only hesitating two minutes before he gives the wood a resounding knock.
“I don’t really know. He was always a good boy.” Her hand drops from her face. “Or, well, good to me, at least.”
Harry manages to shove the MP out of the way, but as a result, he and Ron don’t escape the full brunt of the car. It flings both of them off their feet as they’re propelled backwards by the force of the blow.
“I was here to speak to Justin Finch-Fletchley. One of the victims I carried out last night.” Harry then waves a hand at the officer. “Your turn.”
However, just as he gets a view of the interrogation table’s far corner, a hero steps in his path. “Wotcher,
. Adrenaline pumping, he bolts forward into the ditch, and his foot catches Dracon’s hand as it closes on the mask.
Harry wonders if it’s because he’s realized how much it hurts to move in his state. He swings his legs out from their crossed position and over the edge of the ditch, idly kicking the dirt with his heels. “Rough night?”
Against the wood, he says, “I’ll tell you what I know about him. I know that he was dead and in the ground for at least three months before he ‘borrowed’ that boat.”
Harry nods along while he writes a quick note down and circles it. “And the other masked person in the room. The accomplice? The one who had been laughing. Could you tell what he was doing during all of this?”
They crowd around and are shocked to discover an encasement of glass separates their curious hands and the evidence. But none of them need to touch it—at least not yet. Its appearance speaks enough for itself.
“I’ll give it to them damn villains at the Agency; they sure know how to train their people to shut up tight.”
“Huh, you know what the strange thing is? It actually had me feeling less fear. Almost like the situation came into better perspective where, yeah, it was clearly bad? But it hadn’t been the mind-numbing fear I felt on first waking up.”
Still breathing heavily, Paper Dracon lifts a shaking hand and presses it against the wood piece. “Little rough with that, weren’t you?”
“Not even going to speak to me, Blaise?” Harry’s near enough to hear the tremble in his voice below the angry bravado.
As Harry begins falling through the rubbish chute, he latches onto Dracon’s retreating hand with one of his own. His heels catch on the ground as the rest of his body hovers over the gaping hole. “Wait! Why not go through with it? Isn’t this a betrayal of your organization?”
“Of course, I don’t really expect you to have kept up with my activities since leaving Hogwarts...” His right hand subconsciously adjusts his left cuff. “I work for a Ministry sub-division that handles attacks from Magical Creatures.”
By the tensing of Fire’s shoulders, he knows he let information unwittingly slip. Unfortunately for the heroes, this means that he holds his tongue again for a good hour, regardless of what they say around him.
They learn that the night the Villain Agency attacked the Hero Order headquarters, more than half the Order’s pro heroes had been preparing for attack in their homes, while most of the younger generation had been off on patrol. Truly, their headquarters had not been more vulnerable to attack than it had been on that night. It had been lucky that Harry had noticed the odd glow from the fire while he had been out on patrol.
Justin shuts the door behind Harry as he steps inside and gestures to the sitting room. They sit in seats opposite from one another—Justin on the couch and Harry on a stuffed chair.
Choosing which articles of clothing to wear in his costume’s stead had proven to be a half hour feat. At first, Harry’d debated just wearing plain clothes but knew he’d never be allowed into the places he was going today if he appeared as a civilian. His accessibility even as a Superhero had its doubts. Plus, his image as a professional who took his job seriously would be put into question.
Snow had been on the forecast for today, but so far, the sky remains overcast and empty of flakes. For at least a little while, his flowers will remain untouched by the frost as he lays the bouquet down before his parents’ joint grave. He kneels before them and tells them all that has passed since his last visit two months ago, including how his heroics have been going, the recent hard cases, and his mixed emotions about it all. As he does, he wonders aloud what they would have done in his stead and begs for their guidance.
Draco steps through first, and his eyes dart around the room, trying to locate their hostess. He finally finds her sitting on the far end of her couch at the flat’s center, knees drawn up to her chest and long hair obscuring her face.
“So, what, you’re out to make a good name for a creature this side of the Earth hasn’t really heard of?”
Malfoy glared, but continued, “I can’t travel there for... obvious reasons, but I know enough about how one gambles on your regrets. You don’t win body parts; you win the removal of a regret, the losers at the table taking on regrets of the winner.” His hand moved absently over the hole where the peachick still rested, and it pecked at his fingers. “How else could Ravenclaw’s Grey Lady look so immaculate, having died such a violent death, whilst the Bloody Baron is covered in blood and chains like a stuck pig hanging in a slaughterhouse?”
“Oh, young Draco. I certainly do hope you’re not holding out because you think this golden hero will come for you?” His voice grows further away from the door and drops an octave. “When has a hero ever wasted his time rescuing a villain? His enemy?”
“A good lot of cases come to us with victims associating garlic with their attack. That’s likely because garlic is rumoured to be an effective deterrent of vampires—which particularly amoral vampires use to convince their targets that they
Remembering he’s dressed as Blaizing Fire, Harry takes confident strides down the steps—going down, down,
“Yeah, plus helping out a villain?” Ron snorts. “I’m a hero myself, and I hardly believe that one. Couldn’t’ve expected
“With all due respect, Mr. Hendricks, we’ll be conducting the questions here,” one of the Aurors says.
Flummoxed as to what this gift could be, Harry stares up at Draco, hands sweating at his sides. “. . . All right.”
“...Yes.” Potter seems to realise the ferocity in his movements, glances over at Draco with a look foreign on his face, and sits gently back down in his seat. “I couldn’t stay in my flat after that. I don’t know if my
Likewise, a painful sensation started in his naval, a calling for his astral form to return to his body.
“Malfoy did not upset Master Harry, did he?” If the elf had not dropped the honorific, Draco might have been able to dismiss the accusatory light in Kreacher’s eyes as a trick of his paranoia. But of course, just because he’d been allowed easy entry to the home due to ancestral connections did not mean that Potter’s House Elf would not be overprotective. After all, Potter had just been through quite the ordeal.
Harry melted inside and could only wonder what soft expression was showing on his face just then. “That’s okay too. Let’s make it a game to remember, yeah?”
Experimentally, he ran his hands along the undergrowth, touching bushes and shrubs and tree bark. Swiping his hands through these things came with a similar mild resistance as when he flung himself through the window, and echoes of the livings’ essence clouded up behind his hands before realigning back into proper position.
Dracon’s breath comes out in a hiss, making Harry realize he’s probably putting pressure on what must be a broken rib since he tried his best to focus his electricity away from his hands to not zap him. After Harry lets off a little on the force he’s using, Paper Dracon huffs out a few more breaths before replying. “And yet, you forget we’re diametrically opposed, hero.”
Harry chuckles. “It’s perfectly fine if you don’t. I’ve certainly aided enough people in my three-year career to know how a lot of it just . . . runs together.”
Looking up to the top crate, Harry can make out a single figure standing in the dull lighting of the warehouse. “I hope that, unlike the first time we met, you don’t have any cronies crawling around.”
Ron grumbles beside Harry. “Wasn’t so helpful, that bloke, was he? For all we know, we’re chasing geese.”
“And I—I think,” Potter says slowly, his face twisting—as though he’s tasting the words in his mouth and finding them bitter, “I think we may be bite-mates, me and him. I mean, I don’t know enough about vampire attacks like you do, but you seemed to think it odd enough that a vampire would do that—attack from behind and without hypnosis. Not many fit that description. And—and he was... calling—calling for—"
“I can’t believe you bloody well lost to that prick,” Ron says for the eightieth time. “I mean, blimey, Harry. You couldn’t have waited until you were better to make that kind of challenge? Now we’ve lost a source of information—granted, he very well sucked at that, but, still.”
“Now.” Voldemort rubs his hands together. “You’re familiar, Draco, with what lies under this sheet. In addition to our upgraded
Paper Dracon pauses a moment. “And what’s more, who even goes around with an alias like that. What does 'Izulu' even mean? 'I'm a
“Most of ‘em tend to be loner-types. Lonely enough that they latch onto me. And what can I say? I have quite the comforting presence. So really, they pick me, you know.”
His new plan involves climbing atop one of the crates and lying flat on his stomach. He considers it a stroke of luck that most of the men are still preoccupied with stopping the dangling crate from plummeting into the Thames. Harry turns his attention to the one he’s perched upon and fiddles with the latch next to his stomach. He draws up short of opening the lid due to an old-fashioned dial lock holding the flaps in place.
Opening his eyes, Harry sees Fire moving to lie beside his unconscious comrades. For the second time that night, Harry finds himself impelled to speak to the villain. As he opens his mouth, however, Blaizing Fire brings a finger to his lips and darts a pointed glance at the body closest to him. Upon realizing that Fire
Ron grumbles a bit while they walk out into the street. “Fine. Whatever. Let’s see if we can find law enforcement around to take the villains inside into custody.”
“Pa—Actually . . . .” Her face scrunches up in thought. “It—would be . . . dangerous . . . for me to do so.”
“I wasn't here. I should have been. Or maybe I should have pressed him harder to come with me when I left.”
Scratch talking to Potter; Draco’s so not ready for this conversation. Still, this is the first thing Potter’s technically said to him that’s not directly about the case. “I don’t hate it.”
Their laughter echoed around the trees even after they crossed through the Veil, hand-in-hand, like a memory giving its last haunting whispers before quietly fading away.
Dracon makes a garbled sound and tries to jerk his hand from under Harry’s foot, but he holds it trapped between the mask and his sole.
“Say, mate,” Ron said. “You know how in Auror Training, we’re being expected to pick up a case to try to solve? Why not do Malfoy’s? Sure, it’s a bit of cheating, being able to ask him directly about it, but two birds, eh?”
Unfortunately for Voldemort, Cho already took out the last of the monstrous machines with the power from her own two hands.
Upon reaching the main floor of the house, Harry sees the crisp, clean elegance from earlier in shambles. Vases have fallen off their stands to shatter on the floor, crumbled bits of wall crowd the hallway, and dust scatters everywhere. Shouting comes from every direction of the house.
Draco glances back to see Potter standing on the threshold with a tilt to his head, door still open behind him. He gestures to Potter. “Well, come on, then. Order what you like.”
He looks around, but he doesn’t spot the odd villain anywhere. Harry does see, however, Cho fighting a small army of
The hole made by the explosion is smaller than one would have thought, given the amount of smoke that had billowed out last night. It only takes up three flats in width, and, lengthwise, the damage seems contained relatively to one level of flats, with the exception of parts of the flats above and below having gotten caught up in the chaos.
“Yeah, yikes. But he could never compel people to use their powers. According to my father—” he takes in a few breaths “—According to him, that always grated on Voldemort. With the
Harry takes a breath and focuses on the energy field surrounding the body, rather than the one circulating through it, and speeds it up a small fraction—
Draco’s mouth opened and closed, his pretension seemingly abandoning him at last. “Yet ending your life as you know it for something unknown—something unspeakably dangerous...”
“I just know how you tend to think.” Her legs swing against the bar stool rails. “What about the robot? Learn anything new about that?”
The two of them walk too far apart. They get knocked off their feet by a hoard of gargoyles diving in from the hole in the roof.
“While your sense of morality is commendable, my dear boy, Paper Dracon is still a villain wanted for crimes associated with the Villain Agency.”
Potter’s one shoulder does a weird spasm that’s probably supposed to be a shrug. “I thought I did. I mean, well...” His head falls into his hands. “I didn’t even know the person was a
Sighing, Malfoy stilled. “There have long been rumors I’d heard about the Underground Ghost-Gambling Goblin Market. Besides other types of bargaining, a lot of wheeling and dealing regarding souls go on there. Oh, don’t look at me like that, Potter. Ghosts of every kind of magical creature exist, though humans seem to outnumber the rest of the lot combined.”
Dracon’s hands bunch the fabric at Harry’s back, and it’s through his shaking that Harry realizes his ex-enemy is crying.
“We knew the red lights had something to do with it, but they always stayed out of our reach. Our only hope had been that some of them must have overheated due to whatever they had been doing to us. Most of them exploded during our time locked in with them."
did. In all your bull-headed, heroic, Gryffindor glory, you did. Merlin, it’s been so long since I’ve touched another
Prancing Peacock continues, “I still don’t understand. If you had no delusions about the matter . . . ?”
Ron’s nodding. “Pretty quiet night for me in West London. Caught some kids messing with people’s brake-lights in Kensington. Had to break up a domestic situation in Chelsea, though. Kind of hard to do with my power-set.” Ron shrugs. “But I was able to hold the situation down until the police showed up.”
Once he’s focusing on noises not involving the crackling of the flames or his own heartbeat, Harry can also hear other shouting in the distance. He suddenly recalls all the henchmen crawling the dock shed earlier.
Even though the dragon mask covers his face completely, Harry swears he can feel the sharp glare Dracon sends his way. “Piss off.” He tries again to extricate himself from the rubbish bin, but the strong static pull on his sleeve tugs him right back. “You did this, you prick.”
The guard had shielded the two MPs still on the floor, and, by his twitching, Harry guesses he received a zap as well. Harry winces.
“Eh.” He rubs a hand along the back of his neck. “The doctors didn’t go into details when I’d ask. But from what I did hear from them, they’ve recovered just fine.” His eyes return to Harry’s eye lenses. “Though, I’m guessing that’s not all you’re here to talk about?”
“I-I didn’t want to! Vol—They had found out about our . . . recent encounters. After the attack on the Hero Order. And they saw it as an opportunity to capture you,” he says quickly. “So, they had me invite you here and used me as a distraction for time.”

see Dracon has never ceased. But seeing him in this moment, just like he always was to Harry, is more than enough now.
The children jump and shield their eyes at first when he floods the darkened street with his electrical glow, but, upon recognizing his voice, they swarm him. “
Shrugging his shoulders, Harry reaches across the gap between them to pat him on the knee. “To be honest, I think you do deserve to face
The pull of Disapparation is jarring, but Draco’s enough of a veteran that he doesn’t lose his lunch. Potter retches a little beside Draco as they Apparate onto marshy ground.
Harry wonders if hallucinations are a part of being concussed. Before he can turn around and head inside, a voice calls out from behind him.
“Harry.” Draco’s tone was so soft, it was a wonder Harry heard him at all. “I’ve always wanted to hold your hand. And no wishes on peacocks gave that to me—
The crowd slows, but not by much. Eventually, they all figure out a vague order in which to exit, and their escape goes much more smoothly.
Draco’s up and almost out of the front door, cloak taken from the hall rack when Potter’s voice calls out to him.
When Dracon finally gets released in the Spring, three years later, Izulu is there to meet him. Hand in hand, they walk back to the new Hero Order headquarters, where Paper Dracon starts filling out paperwork to start hero work.
Almost like he’s afraid Harry will snatch the mask away should he move too fast, Paper Dracon slowly reaches out the hand cradled to his chest. Once Dracon’s fingers delicately wrap around the mask’s edge, he whips it back to himself, fast as any of Harry’s lightning bolts.
“Is this the way things are going to be from now on?” Ron asks. “All of us continuing our heroic duties while the Villain Agency picks us off one by one?”
“I know what you’re thinking, and, no, we don’t know who was behind the attack as the culprits struck after he left his house.”
gave him before heading back to the observation room. Taking the first item, the key, firmly in hand, Harry slips it into the lock and slides the door open, shielding the second item in his other hand.
Harry walks around the room, gaze wandering from one bare wall to the next, looking for clues—anything at all. The drawers are barren, and the space beneath the bed is bare. His hands run over the musty sheets and feels the pillow—nothing. He stares minutely up at the ceiling and counts the cracks—four.
“Sorry, Harry,” Hermione calls out from Harry’s other side. “Going back now would mean getting captured for sure. We’d be of no help to him like that.”
Harry heads upstairs to his room and drops the duffel bag with his costume and mask inside it onto his bed. It needs serious washing with all the rolling around in a ditch he did tonight. Changing back into his civilian clothes in a narrow alleyway where he’d dropped the costume’s arms into a puddle certainly didn’t help any.  But that is a problem for Well-Fed-Harry.
Hermione pats at Harry’s hands lying on the table top. “Paper Dracon’s probably getting treated at one of the Villain Agency hideouts. No need to stress any more about it tonight.”
Draco wants to say something, but he’s not entirely sure what about the situation set Potter off—what he could say to make him feel better. So for once in his life, he bites his tongue, and lets Potter talk.
Slowly, as if not to spook Harry away, Dracon takes a step forward and lifts a gloved hand until it hovers two centimeters from touching Harry’s cheek. Then his hand makes a stilted caressing motion, still careful not to touch Harry’s face. “You’re . . . .”
For their part, Potter and Draco get their share of wary looks—Draco for his history with Dark Arts and Potter for his unsettling attire. At least the two of them are less likely of getting jumped than Potter seems to fear.
“It doesn’t make sense for you to attempt a petty crime—unless the Villain Agency really does pay you shit wages.” He scans Dracon’s form, most of the tears in his suit from almost two weeks ago still there even if most of the injuries have healed. “Though if that’s the case, why not just work an honest job?”
“Can you really guarantee that, though? Yeah, say we get a look under his mask? A name doesn’t come attached with it. Then we’ll be focusing our energy on tracking down his name and address instead of what we should really be spending our time hunting down.” He looks around at his deflating teammates. “Besides, I’d still like to look the other heroes in the eye when we get their information back. And my own in the mirror.”
As Harry takes another cautious step towards them, his attention gets dragged to Paper Dracon when he cries out and collapses. Looking at the odd angle Dracon holds himself, Harry suddenly realizes what seemed off about him earlier. “Your leg . . . . It’s broken?”
“Not really. Like I said, I hadn’t exactly been focused on him, so he could have slipped away at any time or been blown out of the flat in the explosion.”
He chews on his lips while he thinks. “Probably down in that creepy lab they have. Down in their cellar.”
He releases his breath and takes the chair across from Blaizing Fire. He meets the white eye patches of the under-mask and thinks about what Paper Dracon looks like beneath his identical face-covering. That line of thinking makes his heart palpitate in his chest, and Harry wonders what the hell is wrong with him.
know that?” Her eyes roll skyward. “I just know that at the end of the last month, her nephew comes along and carts it away.”
“It’s just... not.” Harry had grown up with people telling him it wasn’t his fault his loved ones died because a madman wanted him dead, and he’d never been able to believe that. He never understood how it wasn’t his fault, but maybe if he did, he’d do better by Draco now.
Draco blinks, and Potter has retreated several paces back into the house. “Well, if you’re done prettying yourself up...”
Reaching up, he gives Dracon a one-armed hug. Then he pulls away and heads back up to his room so that he doesn’t have to see Draco leave.
But as he’s moved, Paper Dracon speaks barely above a whisper. “I should have known. The moment he didn’t show right at the meeting spot. I shouldn’t have looked for him.” As he’s set against the wall, his attention shifts to Harry. “Guess professionals make mistakes too, huh, hero?”
So that means they only lost the one hero, Charity’s Grace, the day after Blaizing Fire had been let go. She’d been ambushed on her walk home in her civilian regalia after a particularly grueling patrol. She’s been missing ever since. Looking back on that night, the heroes that had patrolled with her noted that the harsh night of crime fighting had most likely been orchestrated so that she had been too exhausted to fight back against the Agency kidnappers. The day after the incident, her civilian name had been splashed all over the papers, declaring the University Professor, Charity Burbage, missing.
remains silent for a moment. “Hard to say. We may be called the Hero Order, but it’s doubtful we know all the heroes registered in the city—and especially the heroes outside London.”
Alpha Bee smiles wide and holds his arms out to them—out of all the people here to meet them, he looks the friendliest. “Ah, good work. Good work, you three!”
He stops walking under a streetlamp and looks at his hands. The gloves don’t belong to him. Neither does the costume he wears, nor the two masks placed over-top his head. All of it, apart from the under-mask, belongs to Blaizing Fire. Hermione only had to duplicate the look of the under-mask, since Harry was free to wear the red skull identification mask without compromising Fire’s privacy. He did, however, leave Fire’s matches, lighter, and lighter fluid back at the base.
Approximately a week later, Harry stands outside a Waterstones Bookstore in the heart of London alongside Ron, Hermione, and a long line of strangers. Brisk air cuts through the crowd, and clouds form an overcast sky.
Harry clutches the piece he’s gathered, even as a corner of his mind tells him he’s trying to rationalize his actions. While he’s investigated crime scenes both before and after law enforcement has, he’s never done so in the midst of their examinations. But, really, it’s hardly all that different from gathering evidence while at a crime scene before law enforcement becomes involved.
“Hold on a second.” In his dazed state, Harry recognizes that voice as belonging to Blaizing Fire. “I think he’s saying he needs pen and paper to communicate.”
—a hero friend of mine introduced it to me a week ago. Gives me some cool ideas for my powers.” His smirk grows even more. “Besides, couldn’t have you pulling your Houdini act again after another crime.”
He helps Paper Dracon re-find his balance, and, since both of them are already at the point of stumbling around, Harry lifts Dracon’s arm and pulls it across his shoulders.
He hesitates. “You hold onto it. So, it’ll remind you that I’m maybe not just another person you managed to save.”
Unfortunately, if you're reading on a phone, tablet, or similar device, you won't be able to see a hero's true name by hovering over their alias. However, there is
Perhaps in his foolish hurry, Harry had forgotten to throw some spells at the floor or was in denial that Malfoy was a ghost now and didn’t need a door. Either way, the result was the same: Malfoy whispering “Potter” from behind Harry, and Harry nearly vacating his body.
“A little late to be raising that question, don’t you think, Hermione?” Ron asked from his position as Settee Spectator and Potions-Making Cheerleader. “I mean, you could have asked that from any point between Harry wondering if it’s possible, to you researching it, to you brewing the bloody thing.”
Ron’s fist clenches. “Then we’ll just have to find out what they’re planning.” He storms out the door to the corridor.
Harry asks, “But then why would there only be one attack per day? Isn’t that a little odd? If they auctioned off the hero identities they stole, wouldn’t it just be a whole bunch at once?”
While Harry scores three times, he lets each of the children steal it off him to score once each. After the fourth and final goal, Harry falls to his knees in the wet street and lifts his head to the grey sky. “Ack! You have defeated me!” Then he powers down and collapses onto his back, arms spread wide and water soaking in.
Ron’s face has gone red as Harry spoke. Finally, he takes the pillow from under his head and whacks Harry with it. “Enough of my problems. Let’s get back to your drama with your not-quite-mate-not-quite-enemy
The comforting section of the conversation had been going well after that until Hermione asked whether Harry had reported that Malfoy was no longer missing but dead.
“I hate to leave him here like that. Don’t want him to be getting up and joining forces with the other villains.”
“Okay, this way, Miss.” Draco’s supervisor shepherds Ms. Adams to the door opposite the one she came in, signaling to the other Auror in the room to bring in the next person from the corridor.
has stopped by a few times to check in on how the injured heroes are recovering. These rare instances allow for even rarer updates about what’s going on outside the world of the Weasley household.
