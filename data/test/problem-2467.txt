C) Granger might not
“Can I have one last fight? Just one, I promise, and then we can be done, then we can have our happy ending.” Potter looks so earnest, pleading with Draco as much as he himself pleaded earlier, asking to be understood and indulged.
“Let’s plan a dinner party.”
It’s nice, on a theoretical level, to be cared for. If Draco thinks about it, about all the effort Potter goes to for him, the work and attention he puts in to make sure everything is right, that it will please Draco—well, it’s a bit of an overwhelming thought, if he is honest. It’s a good thought, though, and Draco would do well to remember it.
Angela sat looking even more curious than she had when she arrived.
“I know just the place. It’s muggle, and I know you’ll love it.” Draco smirked and waved as he walked towards the apparition point.
Evan snorted, “Not surprising. Let me guess. She gets you to tell her everything about how you feel and what you want, but her own secrets are hers alone. Only to be revealed at a strategic time and place.” He sneered.
Evan smiled slightly. “That doesn’t sound so bad. I just have to smile and nod, right?”
“Come, sit. And….I’ll try to explain.” Evan said, gesturing to the seat beside him, “It’s kind of a long story.” He began rubbing the back of his neck.
Evan smiled weakly at him but said nothing. There was a knock on the door, and both men turned to see Ridley stroll into the room. Her pretty dark hair pulled up into a high ponytail, dark eyes sulky with the early hour.
“That… that’s what I want.” Draco said pointing to the ad.
“Not anymore. I’m Jamieson now. When I changed my name, I did it in both the muggle and Wizarding worlds. Remus made sure it held, and nobody could trace me back here. A version of the Fidelius. But once I reveal myself to someone, the spell is broken for that person.” Evan said, leaning back in his chair as he waited for the blonde to come to terms with his revelations.
“He is fit. Much better than I remember him being.” Evan felt compelled to say as he attached the note to the owl and let it out by the window.
Evan sighed and slumped against the counter.
“If you’re sure.” Scott pushed, still a little worried about the brunette.
There was a short silence during which Draco ordered coffee for himself, and Evan read the contract. Evan finished and asked Draco for a quill to sign the contract. The magic of the contract would only take if he used a quill.
After breakfast, Angela managed to corner Evan.
“Yes, Evan. I’ll explain.” Remus said, smiling fondly at the man who had become as much of a godson to him as to Sirius.
“Call me Evan; most people do. It’s a long story, but if you really want to know.” Evan began.
“It’s easier to forgive an enemy for their mistakes than it is to forgive friends for their betrayal,” Ridley said, nodding, and Evan nodded back.
“Um, no. It was supposed to be a stag. I guess I’ve changed so much since I last cast that spell, so it changed?” Evan said, making it a question at the end even as the bird flew gracefully around the room.
“Anyway. Let me know soon, alright. I don’t think he’s going to just let it go.” Angela said as she waved to them and left.
Now they were as close as brothers, the way they should have been growing up. Nobody understood their childhood the way they did. Harry had even brought himself to tell his cousin all about his adventures in Hogwarts, and the blonde boy had been by turns horrified that Harry had gone through all that and impressed that his cousin had survived at all.
“Good, good. That’s very good, Evan. Now tell me five things you can feel.” Scott said, pleased to note that his cousin’s breathing had started to steady a little.
“I’m fine.” Evan said, but at Scott’s snort, he sighed and added, “I’m fine now. I’ll be just fine. But I need to leave now. And don’t commit to anything with Malfoy and his firm, please. I’ll explain everything to you tomorrow?” He finished quizzically.
“You believe me? About magic?” Evan asked, gaping at her.
At the time, he had just packed up all his belongings and showed up at Harry’s door without the first clue about what he would do next. Harry had taken him in, and a few months later, neither Harry nor Dudley existed; instead, they were Evan and Scott Jamieson. These days, there was nothing left of the fat young bully who had dogged Harry’s childhood. Scott Jamieson was a respected therapist, and while big-boned, there wasn’t an ounce of fat left on his frame. Evan couldn’t be more proud of his cousin if he tried.
The song  in this chapter is Lose You To Love Me by Selena Gomez
“Oh, he is. Now I just need to get him to speak to me. And not have to go through his manager for everything.” Draco remarked, his eyes pensive as he formulated strategies.

Evan paled but straightened his spine, prepared to face this ghost of his past, as he didn’t seem to have a choice. George immediately rose to shield Evan from view, but Evan put a hand on his arm to stop him, shaking his head imperceptibly at the older man when George glanced at him.
“But your Firebolt is much better than this one. It’s faster.” Harry said confusedly.
“Too damn close.” Evan agreed, “I can’t afford any of those crazies finding me. Ever. There was a reason I ran away, and one of those reasons is that prat’s partner.” He muttered.
Evan smiled back, “Dinner then? This weekend?” he asked.
As it flew into his hand, he heard them gasp and started to grin. It was quite nice to show off a little.
The song could have been about a lover, but to him, it seemed like the singer was talking about his relationship with his father and the way he had felt used and misused during the time Voldemort had been staying in his house. The next song was even worse.
“Me,” Evan answered evenly. His faked calm only skin-deep.
“So. What does he look like?” She prodded, pushing his feet off the desk.
“It’s still very beautiful. Is it the same spell you used to save us from the Dementors?” Scott asked, watching the heron.
There was a tune that had been haunting him for a while now. He played a few notes, going back and forth as he wished until he was satisfied. Noting the tune in his notepad as he went. He played it out, again and again, adding more as he went along. The lyrics just came to him as he worked. Almost as if they had just been right there at the forefront of his mind, waiting for him to notice them.
“He wants jewellery?” He asked uncertainly.
“What else did he say?” She asked turning away from the display.
“Is there someone here who can act as our bonder?” The blonde asked, trying to stall as his mind raced to figure out what he was missing. The man was familiar, but he just couldn’t put his finger on it. He was probably wearing a glamour at any rate.
Silence falls, carried on heaving breaths and the absence of struggle, the world still around them, shocked. They are close again, no anger separating them, both worse for wear and dishevelled but back where they were, back where Potter wanted to kiss him.
And this is what people go crazy over? What they call fireworks and proclaim not only the symbol of love but also its proof?
If only it didn’t look like the game is winning the fight for Potter’s attention. That hurts a bit. It’s fine, though, because Draco knows his team is going to win—
! Nothing would be worse than marrying you and I didn't even ask you, so you can leave now." Harry has the feeling he just made a big mistake. Malfoy narrows his eyes at him, something hard falling over his face that wasn't there a moment before. Well, Harry won't be cowed just because Malfoy knows how to look soulless.
, Potter, I’m rather certain that qualifies as knowing someone.” Draco doesn’t understand where this hare-brained idea comes from, why Potter is this insistent that Draco ‘meet his friends’.
“If you didn’t what?” Interrogation it is, then — study the new life form, like an insect, caught and observed before being pinned and dissected. Draco doesn’t answer. What is there to say?
with his dirty peasant blood and lifestyle that would make every pure-blood spin in their grave.
Where Harry draws the line though, deal or not, is Sirius’s room. Malfoy won’t set a foot in there, not out of idle curiosity and especially not to transfer everything into rubbish bags to build himself a study or something equally pretentious. Harry won’t let him, under no circumstances.
And if Potter put up a protest before, that means it’s still in there, somewhere, accessible if only you knew the way.
Seamus and Dean are laying on the ground, toppled onto each other and laughing, the cause of their fall unclear but apparently nothing drastic. Which means Harry can throw his popcorn onto them without feeling too bad about exploiting their unfortunate circumstances. With a blood curling war cry everyone resumes their attack.
to hold on to. Potter bites, then, bites into the skin just under his jaw and Draco shouts, tilts his head back to give Potter better access.
Draco stutters a bit in his rant as Harry pulls him close to eliminate the last bit of distance between them, and then, Harry abruptly remembers that this is fake, that they are pretending for Narcissa's sake. Harry is about to get up with some vague excuse, give Draco some space, and sit back down far away — because exploiting this situation is
This might sound presumptuous, but Draco is sure Potter’s sanctuary likes him. It took a while for the shop to warm up to him, but several weeks in, Draco is very confident in proclaiming it (even if it did earn him a few dirty looks with his colleagues). There is a thrumming in the store, connecting the instruments and Potter and flowing through everything, woven into the wards and anchored in the ground, welcoming Draco and his gifts as soon as he steps through the door.
Draco is, honestly, not sure how to handle Potter in this moment. Tough love was perhaps not the best idea.
“I want Potter to talk Granger and Weasley into going out with me.”
“But Potter didn’t want the owl because it reminded him too much of his last one?” Blaise, never a fan of animals, doesn’t understand the concept. “They look nothing at all alike.”
If Draco wants to prove to her that he changed, that he is
Sure, Ron and Hermione did pressure him into making this meeting happen, no questions about that. He might have overstated their enthusiasm, though. Ron and Hermione looked forward to meeting again about as much as Draco did, which is to say not at all. Of course they had seen each other again since Draco moved in — kind of difficult to avoid with Draco skulking about the house and them hanging around so much to make sure Harry doesn’t get another evil scar by some totally unexplainable accident — but that was mostly in passing and with the mutual understanding to not acknowledge each other.
He wants to kiss Potter again, softer, reassuring him that it’s okay.
“Hmm,” said Phineas Nigellus, who was actually in his portrait for once.  “You should do something about that Albus.”
Before Adrian could even say a word to him, Miles turned on his heel and marched off the field.  Adrian took a moment to recover and then said, “Okay, it looks like we’ll be needing a new Keeper, too,” then turning to Lane he said, “I’m sorry Mr. Waters, but you need to be at least a second-year to tryout for the Quidditch team.”

A bright white light shot out of the tip of Harry’s wand and zoomed across the room to hit a scared looking Colin right in the face.  Moments later, he coughed and a soap bubble escaped his mouth.  The bubble floated for awhile before popping, and suddenly a loud voice said, “Colin is a virgin.”
“So can Atlanteans breathe underwater like the merpeople?”  Justin asked.
"I'll take that as a yes," Draco said as he positioned himself and then pushed forward into the warm, tight confines of Blaise's ass.
“Yes, but you also said that it was allowed if the student was seventeen, and Nick’s seventeenth birthday is a week from tomorrow.”
The silence of the room was soon broken by the sound of his cell door opening and he realized that his captor was coming for his daily visit. For awhile, the boy tried to get a handle on how long he'd been here by counting the number of times his captor came to visit him. He lost track quite awhile ago though and was never sure if it was really a very accurate measure of time, because while he thought his captor only visited once a day, he couldn't be sure, as he had no clue whether it was night or day.
Blaise and I have decided to officially end our relationship as lovers. Of course, we don’t really have much choice, because it would be a bit hard to continue having sex now that we’re back at school. True, it is possible to put a silencing charm on one’s bed curtains and to make them imperturbable, but after talking about it, Blaise and I both agree that it’s time our liaisons end. We both want to find love, after all.
“Well, how does Hades’ Helm of Invisibility sound?”  Asheera asked.  “I happen to know that it’s stored in the vaults next door at the Gates of Hades.  I can also arrange for the High Priest of Ares to allow you to use Ares’ sword and shield.  I can also get you the magical bow of Apollo and his Mirror of Truth.”
Ryan grinned at Anthony.  He was tempted to ask if he was going to spend any time with Seamus Finnegan over the holidays, but after being outed himself by the
“What do you mean by ‘current state of things’?”  Rowena asked as she again raised her eyebrow.
Unlike Aarik Potter and Zacharias Smith, there are actually two heirs of Rowena Ravenclaw currently at Hogwarts.  The other heir is Kyrian’s cousin, Matthew William Cromwell, 20, who teaches an extra-curricular Music class to all interested Hogwarts students.  It is reported that Matthew is gay and engaged to Oliver Tristan Wood, 20.  In addition to teaching an extra-curricular Art class at Hogwarts, Mr. Wood is perhaps best known for his job as Reserve Keeper for the Puddlemere United Quidditch team.
“Yeah,” Justin said.  “I’ve never seen the professors decorate quite so elaborately.  Even for the Yule Ball, during fourth year, and the decorations then were quite spectacular.  You could tell that you were still in the Great Hall though, where as tonight, it looks like a totally different room.”
“I just wanted to make sure that Draco was okay,” Harry said.  “I was in the Headmaster’s office when Professor Lasinius appeared in the Floo to tell Professor Dumbledore about Draco’s injuries and I was worried.”
“Thank you, Headmaster,” Alaric said with a smile.
Harry was almost out the door when he heard Draco quietly say, “Harry, wait.” It was said so quietly that Harry wasn’t even sure if he had heard it properly. He turned to face Draco and said, “What did you say?”
“I’m a Malfoy, Pansy,” Draco drawled.  “Malfoys don’t give in to demands, they make them.  Now, I demand that you shut your mouth and leave me alone with my boyfriend.”
“Ah, Mr. Potter, Mr. Smith,” Dumbledore said.  “Glad you could make it.”
“True,” Draco said with a smile.  “And not just any Gryffindor, either.  You’re actually descended from Godric Gryffindor.”
“Ron I haven’t decided what I’ll do with mine, but as for the other one, I’m going to stop at the hospital wing on my way to Herbology.”
"Three of the four people who need new wands need them because their old wands most likely have bad cases of wood rot by now, having been interred with them in their caskets."
“Dumbledore told me not to tell a single living soul,” Bill clarified. “That, obviously, includes you, Harry.”
“I don’t care, Ronald!  In case you haven’t noticed, Draco is not the same person he was last year.”
"Oh Gods, NO!" Ryan exclaimed as he dashed from the living room and bolted up the stairs with Frances following close behind. Arriving in Lucinda's bedroom, it was just as Frances had said. Lucinda was lying on the bed, eyes closed, and as Ryan sat down next to her and grabbed her hand, he realized that she was indeed dead, as her hand was ice cold. Having always been very close to his grandmother, as she was the only mother he'd ever known, he threw himself down on her chest and began sobbing.
“Hmm, well, I think we should get the spell started as soon as possible, so, Harry could you check your map?  See if any of our friends are around?”
“It was Weasley,” Harry said, knowing that Draco was probably referring to Ron and he just wanted to torture him for a few seconds.  He wasn’t lying after all, because he had lost his virginity to a Weasley, just not the Weasley that Draco was thinking of.
Chapter Twenty-Seven:
“Nothing is wrong with you, Ryan,” Corelian answered immediately.  “You mustn’t think that I left because I didn’t want you, because I did.  You were all I had left of your mother and I cherished you more then I can say, but the choice of staying was not mine to make.”
“The worst?”  Corelian asked.  “If even one of the artifacts was left unguarded for even a short period of time, the Kingdom of Atlantis could be completely destroyed and if one of these artifacts fell into the wrong hands, it would be disastrous.  We’re talking about extremely powerful shield artifacts created by Poseidon himself.  Currently, they serve the purpose they were created for: shielding Atlantis from the ocean.  In the wrong hands, however, their immense shielding power could be used for much more nefarious purposes.  If Voldemort got his hands on even one of the artifacts, he could use its power to shield his armies against harm.  The war would be lost, because the only power that would stand a chance against the shielding would be that of one of the Olympians, and then only Zeus or Amphitrite.”
Ask me back when you are ready. Until then, don’t you dare sacrifice yourself to the ills of the world when I’m too far away to stop your stupid, noble mind.
“Well, it’s not about what
They can’t stay here forever, they have stories to tell and boxes to pack, but just for a moment, Draco can allow Harry, too, to hide from the world.
“Because you didn’t want to fuck Potter in his sleep? No, darling, that’s… well, perhaps not
“Well, you aren’t getting one.” Potter gestures as if to shoo Draco away, like he is a mangy street cat. Well, they are tougher than Potter thinks; Draco won’t be scared away this easily.

You remember loving him.
Malfoy’s room is almost oppressively warm after the chill that settled deep into Harry’s room, a stark contrast that shocks Harry into momentary standstill. He was right, Malfoy is curled up on the bed like a cat, blankets wrapped around him and looking so heavenly
Pansy doesn’t protest, blinking innocently up at him from where she is most ungracefully slumped into herself, chin supported in the palm of her hand, arm crudely smashed into the table. Their mothers would be horrified at her posture and Draco is half tempted to call her out on it; anything to get her mind off the insipid idea that Draco cares anything at all about Potter and his ailments. Unfortunately, betrayal comes swift and out of an unexpected direction.
—can be treacherous when scared.
were the one owing a favour.” Draco is mostly teasing, they all know he is, but Pansy doesn’t appreciate it and glares at him. Draco gifts her his most blinding smile.
Draco would have politely asked Harry to wait outside while he packed up some stuff to take with them and then he would have pressed all his most treasured secrets into Harry’s arms, protected by a thin but inscrutable layer of cardboard.
Draco doesn’t know where he is when he wakes again. He’s alone, first and foremost, Potter once more vanished during their fall. Draco doesn’t appreciate it.
Draco understands it now. He wants to share them with Potter, these moments, even when Potter is blind from hurt. Who knows, perhaps a nice sunset would have been exactly what Potter needed to see.
Suddenly Potter wakes up, hands flying to Draco’s hips to grab him tightly as he kisses him back, pressing him against the wall with its force. Draco’s head hurts at the impact and he yelps in shock, something Potter takes an invitation to slip his tongue into Draco’s mouth.
? That can’t be good. Harry is too tired to pay it much attention, but there is something else there, something nagging at the back of his mind and calling for him to connect the dots.
“Surprised to see you here. What, did Parkinson throw you to the side to make more space for Ron and Hermione?” Harry isn’t bitter, he might sound it but he
Draco is a reasonable man, though—no really, don’t laugh—and he settled a price so simple, Granger almost didn’t accept for fear of it being a trap. A favour, that’s all Draco asked for, a favour from Potter. Weasley had grit his teeth and muttered about devious snakes and debts Draco allegedly owed, but Granger agreed and here Draco stands, staring at Potter’s frail body laying in a bed too big for him.
Careful to project his movement and intentions, Draco gently disentangles his fingers from his hair. Harry doesn’t protest, blinks at Draco and lets him guide his hands down, smiles when Draco gives them a slight squeeze. Draco would do far more than bear a little discomfort to be allowed to make him smile like that.
?” Draco follows the silent debate unfolding, both of them angry but neither of them addressing that anger towards him. That is probably best, things could get ugly if they tried accusing Draco, a favour promised or not.
Draco doesn’t know much about wolves, knows them to be a Muggle predator with shaggy fur and sharp teeth, but what his mind clings to are werewolves, their scornful laughter and the screamed agony of transformation. These aren’t werewolves, of that Draco is sure, but he would be stupid to underestimate anything in this harsh environment. It’s eat or be eaten in the winter, and the wolves know this.
“Not even to go back to that aerial silks place you liked?” Draco tries, after a few minutes have passed with nothing but his nervous humming and Potter laying on the table, dead to the world.
“About your very dramatic escape through the window because you thought Hermione was the Balrog. You deserved to be dropped for robbing me of that moment.” Weasley, also as usual, doesn’t make sense.

his worst dinner, not even because it’s potentially his last.
“Malfoy,” Potter says, the name punched out of him.
Potter frowns at him, work forgotten as he looks at Draco, forehead in wrinkles and bushy eyebrows forced close together.
Praying the beanbag won’t give under his hand, Draco levers himself up and out of his hiding space against Harry’s neck. The ground holds firm and Harry’s hands only clench on him for a short moment before letting Draco go and then suddenly, Draco is looking into Harry’s eyes. Harry’s impossibly green eyes, wide and vulnerable and scared.
to eat that.
Potter, who is barely Potter anymore, freezes. It’s not how he would have reacted before the war, eager for any excuse to jump at Draco's throat and tell him in excessive detail why he is a terrible person and how he made the right choice not taking Draco’s hand in first year. (Yes, Draco is still bitter about that, so what?)
Draco’s point exactly, they forced a complicated relationship into simplified terms and it left giant holes to their plan. Not that it seems to bother Potter, who didn’t yet understand that if
Malfoy, either not as horrified by the prospect or better at pretending, rolls his eyes and — who would have expected that — sneers. Really, how the expression isn’t
It’s an unsettling thought, the idea that Potter might be breathing his last breaths while Draco stands here, outside of his mind and useless in any fights that Potter might be fighting. Draco is tempted to make some dig against Weasley (he knows what he would say, too: he would—very innocently—assume that they are all familiar with the complex and highly theoretical process and the incantations needed, make Weasley look like a fool when he has to admit that he is the only one who doesn’t know, who needs to be told) just to get his footing back. But Granger already warned him once and they had this weird and intimate moment of understanding—Draco can’t abuse him like that after they agreed to focus on Potter.
Hoping to hide his burgeoning smirk behind the mug he quickly takes it when Malfoy offers, taking a gulp of coffee and pulling Malfoy closer — unsuspecting and smug as he is, he is easy to move once you get past the shocked flailing — to hold him against himself and press a kiss onto his mouth, graciously sharing his coffee with him.
“We are planning our campaign for the rights of magical creatures, if you must know. In particular, those who cannot speak up for themselves and are thus discarded as undeserving by most of wizarding kind. Pansy has brilliant ideas! Today, we are going to contact potential allies and draft a PSA, Pansy wanted —” Granger cuts herself off, realising she went from answering the question to marvelling at her girlfriend (Draco is convinced they finally got it together enough to make their affection official, as that would explain Pansy's silence on the topic, eager to hoard the details all for herself until she makes a grand announcement). “Do you know where she is or not?”

Instead of charmed and grateful Draco is grumpy. He has been waiting for what feels like eons, nothing to do but listen to Potter move. The thrill was lost rather quickly.
to say more to that. He pointed out that there is a difference and that he won’t tolerate Harry misnaming his dragon, he doesn’t need to share the details on the name. But Draco doesn’t want to only take from Harry, to use him like he has been used all his life. Harry deserves better than that, and Draco does have more to give him.
Then Potter

That might be true. Or it might be completely useless, because Harry only wants Draco back and to be
“Something moved,” Harry whispers, eyes making their way around the room again when his first search doesn’t find anything.
Then Potter blinks, eyes on Draco and his approach, and the image he presents changes. He sits up, spine straight and shoulders squared, gaze awake and alert. His clothes still don’t fit and his hair would make any decent barber cry in despair, but Potter is
it, doesn’t have the slightest idea what Potter is thinking, but should something drastically change Draco will notice. Which is all he has in terms of comfort at the moment.
to hurt, either. You drink the potion.
Harry can almost see it now, their life exactly as it is now but without having to suppress his urges and desires. He could just shut Malfoy up when he is talking shit, could kiss him quiet and give him something else to do. He could channel his frustrations with the brat into something more pleasant than banging his fists against the wall and instead bang
“Ron, not that I don’t appreciate having the bloodstream in my hand cut off, but I can’t move it at all.” Ron smirks at him. Oh no.
Harry hopes Draco won’t be so spooked as to insist on separated beds again; Harry rather likes sleeping with Draco at his side. Most mornings, he even enjoys waking up to the git.
“Seriously, Malfoy, again? It’s
Draco didn’t even notice it, too consumed by Potter, but nothing could have prepared him for it
It only makes sense, and if anything Draco should be shocked at the timing, not the fact. They might have been sharing a bed, sleeping ever closer and entwined with each other, but Harry didn’t … do anything, didn’t cross any boundaries Draco would have preferred they stay far away from. It was unsettling at first, Draco constantly on edge and waiting for the other shoe to drop, but things remained pleasantly un-marital. Draco had begun to relax into it, to let go of the constant worry of what things might progress into. And now he pays the price for his carelessness.
“I have a letter for you. From Harry. I will not deliver this letter unless you tell me where Pansy is.” That is… unexpected.
“Isn’t that what you said? That you waited for

Harry nods, not up to talking, as Ron guessed, and takes a sip of his tea. It’s hot enough to burn his entire mouth, fire spreading down his throat and leaving a burning trail. Harry relishes in the feeling and takes another sip.
Potter’s scowl softens, his arms opening to reach for Draco and he is about to say something, when the noise around them begins to swell, growing into rhythm and melody and winding around them, intrusive even in its gentleness.
Logically, locking them away here is the only thing that betrays how immensely precious these things are to Draco. If he wanted to hide them, it would be smarter to mix them under his normal things, conceal them under the cover of triviality where no one would think to look for them. Draco had a lengthy debate with Theo about that one day, after Theo proved his system inadequate by finding the hidden room and Draco’s most private secrets. Secrets Draco already willingly shared because he is a trusting fool when it comes to his friends, but he thought to at least keep their location safe.
“Yes, I did notice,” Harry said.  “Something in your tone seems softer and less venom-laced; and then there’s the look in your eyes.”
The young man's eyes quickly looked around the room and seeing nobody there he asked, "Who's there?"
“What kind of developments, Valen?”
The head made a noise, as if clearing its’ throat, before a low, raspy voice said, “I believe you would know me as the Dullahan.”
“Welcome to Advanced Potions, sixth-years,” he said. “I am Professor Weasley.  Now, before we begin, I just want to make a few things perfectly clear.  I don’t want any of you to think that you can get away with any misbehavior in my class simply because I am younger than your other teachers.  I also want to make it crystal clear, that I will be treating each and every one of you the same, regardless of any personal or familial relationships that I may have with you.”
I realize I've gotten slightly off track here, but I've found this journal to be very therapeutic. So, even if I sit down intending to write about one subject, I've found that it's best to just lose myself in writing and write whatever comes to mind. In terms of Ryan and Nicolas visiting, I've gotten to know them both a bit better over the last few days since we met on Diagon Alley. They're both really nice guys and even Ron seems to like them and isn't holding the fact that Nicolas was sorted into Slytherin against him. Of course, considering that Nicolas loves Quidditch and chess about as much as Ron does, it was really only a matter of time before they struck up a friendship, regardless of his house.
“There’s nothing so-called about me, madam,” Corelian answered.  “I truly am from Atlantis and whether you believe that or not, is not my problem.”
“Pansy, for the last time, I have no desire to kiss you because I don’t like you.  I’m gay.”
“Professor Dumbledore, I take it?”  Rowena asked.  “Allow me to introduce myself, I am Rowena Ravenclaw.”
“No need?”  Adrian asked as he turned on his fellow Chaser.  “You were at the game today!  You saw what happened and you’re saying there’s no need?”
Raising his scepter, a four-foot shaft carved from a solid ruby, Asmodeus mumbled a few words under his breath and prepared to force Voldemort’s return to his native layer of Hell, Phlegethos. It was then that he realized that he would be unable to do it, for as soon as he finished the first part of his spell, long tendrils of red light, normally invisible to the naked eye, emerged from Voldemort’s body and connected him to all of his Death Eaters.
“I’m positive,” answered Draco.
Draco just smiled as he sat down beside Harry and said, “Okay, I admit, I’ve always thought that most of the rules that my sire has drilled into my brain since I was born were totally stupid.  I just never said anything because...”
"Not even the Atlanteans?"  Tonks asked.  "I thought I'd heard that they were very long-lived."
Seeing that Andrew looked like he was going to try again, Harry pointed his wand and said, “Expelliarmus!”
“Helga, if you could please go to the guest quarters and get my father, I would really appreciate it.  Tell him to meet us at the gargoyle.”
"Well, I was about to tell you something that not even Ron and Hermione know. They've been my best friends since first year and I haven't even told them yet," as Harry thought, 'Of course, I was about to tell Ryan and Nicolas about Bill. Ron and Hermione don't even know I'm gay yet, let alone anything about Bill. Speaking of things they don't know about yet, I also haven't told them about the prophecy either. I think I'll hold off on telling them about that for now.'

ALEXANDRA FIONA CROMWELL, born 09-03-1956, died 21-04-1980, age 24
Cuddling up together under the covers, Matt whispered softly, "I love you, Olli."
“A magic filter,” Queen Calliara answered.  “It allows only the water and this lift to pass through it.  Prepare for a breathtaking sight.  We’re almost there.”
By J.C. Vascardi
"I'm going to go out on a limb here," Hermione said, "and venture a guess that you mean that you've slept with one of Ron's brothers, am I right Harry?"
“Sure,” Harry said as he took out his wand and tapped the parchment.  “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
“I’m warning you, Peeves!”  Madam Pomfrey exclaimed.  “Get out before I call the Headmaster!”
“Zach, I would never kid around about something as serious as death.  I know some people might like to kid around about it, but having actually experienced it, I’ve lost any desire to do so.”

Looking at the clock on the fireplace mantle, Oliver said, “Well, we have half-an-hour now, we should probably be going.”
“I always run a few laps around the lake in the morning,” Bill answered.  “Shortly after Nick turned seventeen, he started joining me for my morning run, and we started talking about our lives and getting to know one another.  We both had already been attracted to one another when we’d first met in Diagon Alley before school started and we decided to start dating.”
“Sorry about that, call of nature,” Corelian lied, as the others just nodded.  Ryan knew that his father was lying, but Matthew and Oliver had no reason to suspect Corelian of any duplicity.
“I won’t take no for an answer, Hermione,” Draco said.  “So, we can stand here and argue about it until the shop closes, but you’re not going to change my mind.”
“Yes, that would make sense,” Professor Lasinius agreed.  “Now, I’m not really sure what to do with you, Mr. Cromwell.  Your ability outweighs most of the other students and I’m not sure I’ll be able to partner you with anyone who would be an appropriate challenge.”
“You’re from Atlantis?”  Dumbledore asked.
A grunt from his father caught Draco's attention and he looked up to see that his father's face had hardened into a cold sneer.  Even at the tender age of six, Draco knew that look meant that Lucius was extremely displeased with him.
“Finished?” Harry asked. “Or would you like to wait and see if it’s going to jump up and dance?”
“My dead godfather,” Harry said.  “Last year, there was a battle in the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic, and during the course of that battle, Sirius was dueling with a Death Eater and he fell through a veil in what is known as the Death Room.”
“Can’t say the same for you,” Cedric said with a grin.  “You’re taller then I remember and I see you got out of that awkward stage.”
Just as Draco had suspected, it wasn’t long after Blaise arrived in his bedroom at Malfoy Manor, that he found himself casting powerful locking and silencing charms on his room, before setting his wand on the nightstand and looking over at Blaise. “Nice to be pure-blood sometimes isn’t it?”
“No,” Aarik said with no hesitation.  “Honestly, I don’t care how old you are.  I went fifteen years without you and I’ll be damned if I’m going to go another second without you just because you didn’t age while you were dead.”
“Well, even if he isn’t related to me directly, I’d still like to meet him.  I’ve been so lonely over the last millennium that I very much relish the thought of talking to people again.”
With a quick swish and flick, Narcissa conjured up a crystal wine goblet, before another swish and flick caused a jet of red wine to shoot from the tip of the wand to fill it.
“Damn, that must have hurt considering how he, well, you know.”
After a few minutes, Barin came out of the kitchen, levitating a large silver tray behind him. After it was levitated up to the table, Ryan could see a plate of toast, a silver tea service, a cup and a saucer, and a few small dishes of various fruit preserves. Barin bowed and then asked, "Does Master Ryan need anything else?"
“Yes, so could I,” Justin said.  “You think we can just move in here?”
“These optional earrings,” Corelian said, “are what most Atlanteans use concealment charms on.  It’s illegal to conceal the rings and while you can conceal the bracelet, clothing generally covers it, so few wear a concealment charm on it.  The earrings, however, can be concealed if you don’t want others to know that you opted to use the optional jewelry.  For those who do use the optional jewelry, they can choose to perform that part of the ceremony in the privacy of a back room, so that only the couple and officiate knows that the optional jewelry was used.  At which point the concealments charms would be used.  For those who don’t care if other people know about it, they can do it in front of the wedding guests, although they can still use the concealment charms if they don’t want people who were not invited to the wedding to know.  As I mentioned earlier, vanity may also play a part and people will conceal the earrings simply because they don’t like wearing jewelry.”
“That would be very useful in this war,” Dumbledore said.  “I wonder if Godric’s armory can produce mythril.  I’ll have to ask him.”
Later that afternoon in the sixth-year Ravenclaw boys’ dorm, Ryan was at a loss.  He had come up to his room to get his Charms book from his trunk and when he did, he realized that the small book of invisibility charms that his grandmother had given him was missing.  He searched through his trunk, twice, and was unable to find it.  Not understanding what could have happened, he quickly checked the small shelf above the headboard of his four-poster with no luck, before searching through the drawer of his bedside table, again, with no luck.
“Father, I’ve come to ask you to please allow Corelian to return to England.”
“Same with Helga,” Zach said.  “She’s furious with Godric and I know that he’s supposed to be known for his bravery, but I’m not sure all the bravery in the world is going to help Godric when Rowena and Helga get to him.”
“You would not be going unprepared, Draco,” Asheera said.  “I realize that it’s very dangerous and I’m not about to suggest that you travel to Tartarus without equipment geared to helping you succeed.”
“Oh excuse me for not just standing here silently while you talk about me like I’m not even here.”
"I'm not going to hurt the puppy, Draco," Lucius said.  "You're going to hurt the puppy.  Actually, you're going to kill it."
“Yeah, that’s true, you do very well in my class,” Bill agreed as he returned the gesture. “What time is it?”
“It’s a long story,” Harry said.  “The short version is that Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me the night he killed my parents, including his ability to speak Parseltongue.”
The three of them watched as King Tyriand sat upon his throne, looking as if he was patiently waiting for something to happen.  Soon enough, the doors of the throne room opened and Corelian walked into the room.  Ryan and Justin could see that Corelian did not look the slightest bit pleased as he bowed to his King.
“Snog you senseless,” Aarik answered.
The last may cause some to be concerned.
After leading the gathered priestesses in a few prayers to Persephone for her continued grace and blessings, Asheera said, “Leave us, my sisters.  I have much to discuss with my guest and very little time in which to do it.”
Severus bowed and said, “It is an honor to meet you.”
“I don’t understand,” Ryan said.
Kevin and Stephen changed into the different robes and then Stephen asked, “Happy now?”
“You mean?”
The War Hits Close to Home, Part Three
I'm still in a state of shock, as I'm sure many people in this house are. I invited all of the Weasleys to spend the night here tonight, seeing as Grimmauld Place was part of my inheritance from Sirius. I don't know what I had really been expecting, but I honestly didn't realize that Sirius was as well off as he was. I thought that since his mother had blasted him off the Black family tree, he wouldn't inherit all of the family holdings. As it would turn out though, Wizarding law favors the male heir when determining who gets what when the deceased doesn't have a will. Sirius' parents got the notion into their heads that wills were Muggle documents and hence refused to have them drafted. So, without wills to dictate who got what, Sirius inherited the majority of the Black holdings since he was the last remaining male heir at the time of his parents' deaths.
“See that you keep it that way, Valen.”
“Brendan Ravenclaw?”  Ryan asked.  “Are you Rowena’s son?”
“Care to put your money where your mouth is?” Justin asked with a sly grin, which looked a bit out of place on a Hufflepuff.
“So, you did get it,” James said.  “I’m glad.  I left it to Albus in my will, with the request that he keep it safe and give it to you when you started Hogwarts.”
“Yes, that’s because I am the current Master of the Cosmos sphere,” Corelian revealed.  “A position I inherited from my father ten years ago when he died.  He was still quite young by Atlantean standards, but despite our long life spans, we are still, nonetheless, mortal.  It is the main difference between us and our Elven ancestors, who like the Gods of Olympus, are immortal.”
“Well, Aarik, being brave does not mean that you can’t be afraid,” Godric said.  “It is, however, a testament to the character of anyone who can do what must be done, even when they are afraid.”
To be continued.

After breakfast, Harry, Ron, and Hermione did as their new professor instructed and went to the Defense against the Dark Arts classroom, instead of the normal potions classroom in the dungeon.  When they arrived, they found that the room was now suited more to Potions class, than Defense.  Several cauldrons of various potions were displayed on a long table at the front of the room and Bill was sitting at his desk.
As for me, like Ron, I was pretty surprised with my results. I'd expected to get an Outstanding in Defense, but the rest of my results really shocked me. I have to thank Hermione profusely I guess, because she's probably the reason that Ron and I didn't do as badly as we'd expected. I expected the Dreadful in Divinations, because, quite frankly, I hate that stupid class. I got an Acceptable in Astronomy and History of Magic, which I'd say is pretty good, especially in History considering I can never stay awake in Binns' class. I got an Exceeds Expectations in Herbology and Transfiguration and Outstanding in Charms and Magical Creatures.
“Pucey, we can all take care of ourselves,” Draco said.  “We’re all in Dumbledore’s Defense Arts class and we’ve all mastered the Patronus Charm.  At the very least we should send our Patronusses out to help drive the Dementors off.”
“Well, of all the books you could have loaned me, you somehow managed to give me my mum’s old book.”
Bill left the room with Malfoy in tow and Harry then turned back to the potion and began to work on it himself.  Ten minutes later, Harry had added the valerian root, asphodel powder, and wormwood, and his potion resembled the ‘smooth, black currant-colored liquid’ mentioned as the ideal halfway stage, but the sopophorous beans were giving him trouble.  The book said to cut them open and pour their juice into the potion, but they were very tough and resistant to Harry’s knife.  Almost ready to give up, Harry squinted at the scribbles of the past owner of the book and noticed that they had apparently taken issue with many of the instructions and had written down their own suggestions.  Looking at the book, Harry noticed that they had written down a note in reference to the sopophorous beans.
“Well, I mean no offense,” Corelian said, “but you short-lived humans can be rather short-sighted at times.  You tend to live in the moment, without really considering the ramifications of your actions.  I’m not trying to say that Atlanteans are superior, because we certainly have our shortcomings, but our long life spans do force us to look at the big picture a bit more often.”
-o-0-o-
Harry looked at Colin and pointed at the entrance to Godric’s quarters, knowing that the room’s magic would not recognize the non-verbal request as him giving Colin permission to enter the room.
“The war with Voldemort claimed Charles,” Corelian said with a look of sadness on his face.  Corelian hadn’t seen Charles in sixteen years, but his loss had hit him hard, as Charles was almost his brother-in-law.  “So, I went to the Ministry to petition the Office of Family Services for guardianship of Kyrian until he reaches his age of majority in Britain, which is 17, next year.  Anyway, the security wizard wanted to arrest me because the machine they use to weigh wands couldn’t determine how long my wand has been in use or what the core is.  I’m told that it’s illegal to bring unknown magical items into the Ministry, punishable, apparently, by time in Azkaban Prison.”
“I certainly agree,” Angelique said.  “The question is how do we go about rescuing him?  Do we even have any idea where he is?”
The really shocking grade though — an OUTSTANDING in POTIONS!!! I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw it. At first I was upset about that because it meant that I'd have to take Snape's class again, but then I thought, 'Maybe I'll get extremely lucky and Snape will be so shocked to see my name on his class register that he'll drop dead and we'll get a new teacher.' Wishful thinking I know, and I should probably cut him some slack because of the danger he puts himself in for the Order's sake, but it's hard to put the way he's treated me for the last five years out of my mind.
Queen Calliara never answered, because at that moment, a burst of wind blew threw the room and a rumble of thunder sounded as a bolt of lightning struck the floor about ten feet away from King Erevan and Queen Calliara’s thrones.  From the inferno of flames, blue this time instead of green, two people emerged.  One the royal couple recognized, the other, they did not.
Matthew produced his wand first and the security wizard dropped it onto a strange device that looked like a set of scales, except it only had one dish.
“I thank you for the offer, Matthew, but I’m quite certain. Good evening,” Professor Lasinius said, before he turned and headed down the hall to his own quarters.
"Yes, sir," Barin answered as he disappeared, only to return moments later through the door, accompanied by a tall, black haired man in flowing black robes.
The driver turned his body to face the professors, before raising his right hand, which was holding his severed head by the hair.  The skin was the color and texture of moldy cheese.  A hideous grin split the face from ear to ear and the small black eyes looked like malignant flies.  The entire head glowed with the phosphorescence of decaying matter.
Harry looked in the window and the only things he saw that might interest Draco was a beautiful winter cloak in Draco’s favourite shade of green. The only other things in the window were for women and a set of wedding robes that Harry brushed off as impossible.
“Hey, babe. See who I brought home with me.” George said as he pushed open the door.
“Hmm, maybe we can ask them to come by, and they can do the show part of the show and tell,” Evan answered wryly. “But, no. This is my responsibility. I can’t chance the Granger know-it-all figuring out who I am. And I’m pretty sure she will. So there’s no way I can do business with them. Malfoy on his own shouldn’t be too bad. He’s changed a lot, Tonks was saying. She’s his cousin, and he’s been visiting with them lately, she said.” Evan said with a shrug.
Evan sat up, straighter and rubbed his hands down his face to wipe off his tears. He smiled at Scott. It was a small wry thing, but it was a smile.
Angel - Sarah McLachlan
Draco smirked back at him, relaxing just a touch more since Evan clearly hadn’t taken offence. There was a certain tension in the air around them, but he wasn’t sure if it was all his or if Po-Evan was feeling it too.
“Oh, no. I came early. Needed a bit of a walk to wake me up.” Evan said, shrugging and smiling at the blonde.
Evan just grimaced, “More like nightmares wouldn’t let me sleep, so I stayed up working on my music instead of sleeping.” He replied but waved away the concern he could see in the blonde’s eyes, “But never mind that. You have the contract?” he asked, changing the subject quickly.
She started and focused on him, her eyes so full of concern and love that Evan sighed in relief.
“I…I was running away from it all. The magic, the magical world. I only used enough so I could keep my magic under control. I even only got in touch with anyone from the magical world properly what…three years after I met you all. After nearly three years of therapy.” Evan answered, holding out his hands in front of him pleadingly.
“If you will take the vow now, then I can explain it better.” Evan pointed out.
“Sure. I’ll pick you up at seven?”
“I’ve been thinking about asking him for a while now. Just wasn’t sure how to do it. Christmas morning sounds perfect actually.” Harry said smiling broadly.
Everyone started getting up from their seats and moving towards the dining room, leaving Evan alone with Ryan.
“I didn’t say anything.” Evan protested, still smirking at his cousin. Angela just gave them both a knowing look and didn’t say anything more, and both men grinned back unrepentantly. She just shook her head at them fondly.
“I don’t think there’s anything you could tell me that would change the way we care about you, young man.” She said, and Evan could see the others nodding as he ducked his head.
“I’ve been good, mate.  The shop is doing great. Angie and I ended up getting married a few years back, and we’re partners in the shop as well as at home now. We have a couple of sprogs now, Fred jr. and Roxanne.” George said, pride radiating from his every feature as he spoke of his family, “What about you, mate? What have you been doing all these years? Where have you been hiding yourself?” he asked, turning the conversation back on Evan.
“You-you fucked off to who knows where. Now, what are you doing back here? Or is it that you only kept in contact with George and not me, your supposed best friend?” Ron asked belligerently, swaying a little as he took a step towards Evan.
“Yes, now go, shoo. I have plotting to do.” Draco said playfully, shooing her out of his office with a small grin on his face, eyes distant already.
“Oh, um, what would you like to see?” Evan asked, stumped and trying hard to blink away his tears. He held out his hand and summoned his wand from his bedroom, where he had left it.
“What is it, love? Are you alright? You look a little pale?” She asked, concern bright in her eyes as she examined him critically.
Evan looked around and saw that Ridley was looking at him, eyebrows raised in curiosity. Ryan seemed slightly worried, and Jemima just looked fond.
“I know. Thanks though. I think I’ll be fine.” Evan said, smiling fondly up at his cousin. He gave a wry chuckle and shook his head when Scott looked at him quizzically, “If the younger us could see us now, they wouldn’t believe it.” Evan answered.
“I don’t know, Ang. I suppose it would be nice to increase my audience, but I’m not sure we could keep my identity a secret if we did. And I really don’t want them knowing where Harry Potter disappeared to all these years. I’ll think about it. Let you know by Monday?” Evan said, resigned that he would be pushing his boundaries one way or another.
They stopped in front of a jewellery store and Harry turned to look quizzically at Hermione.
As he downed a hangover potion and got ready for work, he found himself playing that song on repeat. He was still humming that song to himself as he walked into work, a small smile on his face. He would find a way to get to know the man. He was Draco Malfoy, and he always got what he wanted, he mused when his partner’s voice cut through his thoughts.
“Elder wood.” Harry replied just as quietly, “Is this what you wanted for Christmas, my love?” he asked.
Scott slung a companionable arm around Evan’s shoulders, and the two men walked into the room to be greeted by Angela Linton, Evan’s manager/agent. She had been the one who discovered him all those years ago and paid for music lessons and cosmetic surgery to correct his eyesight and get rid of the ‘horrendous’, according to her, glasses he used to wear. Without those, plus the mild glamour that changed and softened some of his features and hid his scar Evan was sure that nobody from his former life would ever recognise him. Evan owed her a lot for basically taking care of him and making sure that nobody in the music industry took advantage of him.
“So, Malfoy. There’s a couple of things I will require from you if you are going to be my lawyer.” Evan began watching as Malfoy’s head came up, the beginnings of recognition in his eyes.
“I sure hope so,” Draco answered, a smirk firmly in place on his pale, pointed face.
“Oh, yeah, sure,” Evan said, pulling the amulet out from under his shirt and pulling it off his neck. “As you can see, not really all that different. Just a change in eye colour, some softening of my features and no scar. Believe me, it's enough to throw most people off. I was known for my glasses, green eyes and scar—only someone who really knew me, like Granger maybe, could tell it was me. And even then, I think I’ve changed a lot in the last twelve years. I’m at least not the scrawny underfed boy I was then.” Evan continued as they gasped and looked at his new features.
Evan winced slightly at the choice of wording but smiled gamely and replied.
“Wh-what’s his name?”
“Later. First, we celebrate the fact that you actually got my hints. Frankly, I was beginning to despair.” Draco teased.
“You can owl me with the details, and we can meet here or somewhere else, in the muggle world,” Evan said, holding out his hand to shake Draco’s.
Scott rubbed Evan’s arm gently, up and down.
“Don’t worry. They’re family. They’ll understand. You’re not going to lose them over this.” Scott assured him, rubbing his shoulder comfortingly.
Evan sighed and relaxed into the hug. They would be alright, he thought as he felt Ryan relax as well. Together the two men went in to breakfast.
“There you go. That’s Evan Jamieson. Gorgeous and talented, with an absolutely delicious voice. And you know how I feel about a man with a lovely deep voice.” Draco said, sighing over the image of the newest object of his lust playing the piano on the front of the CD. He wouldn’t admit it to himself, but he thought to himself that the only thing that would make the man better would be if he had green eyes instead of blue. Although those blue eyes had an intensity to them when they focused on you that could take his breath away, he was sure. Too bad they had been focused on his agent and not Draco himself.
“You know! You’ve figured it out, haven’t you?” Harry exclaimed, “ Tell me? Please?” he begged.
“What? I can’t even drop by to see my brother now?” Ron asked belligerently, not bothering to answer her question. Then his eyes fell on Evan, and he stopped, stared and flushed violently. “You!” He exclaimed, glaring at the singer.
George shot him a mock, hurt look for this even as his wife glared at him, and Evan sniggered at him.
Evan could see the disbelief on their faces, but he was glad that they were at least listening without interruptions. Evan picked up the story again and told of his eleventh birthday and Hagrid; he glossed over the numerous owls and his uncle dragging them all over creation to avoid them; he also omitted the pigs’ tail, for which Scott threw him a grateful glance. He continued with the Diagon alley shopping trip and mentioned his first meeting with Malfoy and saw the recognition in Angela’s eyes.
From the moment he heard those first lyrics to the song Draco Malfoy knew he was lost. There was no going back. He would have to meet the man behind those heartstopping words. Those words, those fucking lyrics, just seemed to rip his heart out and bare it for everyone to see.
“In a minute. We’re waiting for Angela.” He replied. He had decided not to involve the Lupins as it might be better if it was just family. The Lupins were also family in a way, but they weren’t as close to Harry, and Teddy only knew Evan as his godfather and knew nothing of Evan’s previous life as Harry Potter.
Evan quickly showered and changed into another suit, this time with a black and silver brocade vest. After some debate, he decided to forgo the jacket. These brocade vests had become his signature look for his shows, and he found he quite liked them. He walked out of his dressing room and braced himself to go out but then relaxed as he felt an arm come up around his shoulder. Evan turned around and smiled tiredly at his cousin. Formerly Dudley Dursley, now Scott Jamieson grinned down at him.
The songs in this are not mine. taken from
Evan unfurled the parchment and read the letter from Malfoy as he suspected.
“You, I understand, but why would he? He’s a muggle if I’m not mistaken.” Draco had to ask.
Draco couldn’t think where he had heard that voice before, saying his name in just that way, but there was really something about it that he knew. He pushed it aside and focused on his new client. It seemed like this was going to be one of those demanding ones. He hadn’t even signed on yet and was already making demands.
“Then marry me, love, and make me the happiest man on this planet,” Harry said taking the ring from his Draco and putting it on his finger.
“Enough of that now. So tell us. What is such a big secret?” Jemima asked, her curiosity rising the more Evan stalled.
That had been when Harry had gotten back in contact with Remus and Tonks, so they could make sure that the name change took on the magical side and to make sure that nobody would connect Harry James Potter with Evan Jamieson. Since then, the Jenkins twins and Mama Jem, along with Scott, had become Harry’s family; with their help and encouragement, he had had music lessons, and when his talent had blown them away, he had started going to open mic nights, and Angela had found him there. The rest was history. And she had joined their little family. So he was understandably nervous about telling them he had kept so much of himself a secret for all these years.
“I take it, that wasn’t what you were expecting to happen?” Scott asked, seeing the look on Evan’s face.
give the Lupins a call tonight so they can be there in the morning.” Evan mused aloud, and Scott agreed with him.
He hummed along softly with the song. The songs, the music flowed over him, bringing up memories and soothing old hurts until he felt wrung out by the time the concert was over. With difficulty, he brought himself back to the present and shook off his mood. He was on his way to meet Evan Jamieson. There was someone he needed to meet, someone he wanted to impress. If things went well, he would have a new client for his and Hermione’s firm. For once, he was glad he hadn’t brought a date with him to this concert. If things went better than expected, he might even have more than just a client. Draco didn’t make a habit of sleeping with his clients, but he would certainly make an exception for this man. He straightened his tie, fixed his cuffs and made his way backstage, flashed his VIP pass at the stage crew and was waved through.
“I’m not sure about his, Asheera,” Draco said.  “Could I have a few days to think about it?”
Bill walked over quickly and seeing what happened, he took Malfoy’s hand, pulled out his wand, and cast a charm on it to stop the blood.
“Hmm, well, the all-boy part doesn’t sound bad, if you ask me,” Oliver said with a grin.
Everyone who knew the full truth about the real threat to the Wizarding world were among those anxiously awaiting the end of the school day.  Professor Dumbledore took over teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts for the day so that Professor Snape could spend his time down in Salazar’s lab brewing the potion, which would be ready shortly after classes ended for the day.
Stephen and Tracey sat at the indicated desk, and Bill then motioned towards the table behind them and said, “Ryan Cromwell and Nicolas Delaney; Kevin Entwhistle and Hermione Granger behind them.”
“That is correct, Hat,” Rowena said.  “And yes, you have been lying for many, many years now.  I don’t blame you though, because it must have been Godric who changed your memories after the other founders and I passed away, but all these years you’ve been making Salazar Slytherin out to be a Muggle-hating monster, when in reality nothing could be further from the truth.”
‘Oh Ron,’ Hermione thought.  ‘I’m sure he thinks it a given that I’ll be going to the dance with him.  Of course, what he doesn’t know, is that’s still very much up in the air depending on whether or not he’s willing to start talking to Harry again.  This silence between them has gone on quite long enough if you ask me and I intend to a put a stop to it.’
“What was that noise?” Voldemort asked. He knew the crunching noise was probably one of his prisoner’s bones breaking for the umpteenth time, but a clanging noise? That didn’t make any sense.
“Professor, you remember that book I borrowed yesterday?”
“Bloody hell, Hermione, don’t tell me you’re under the bloody ferret’s spell too.”
“You can call me Harry.  Or Aarik, I suppose.”
“Lord Corelian Laitannen,” Corelian said.  “I’m the biological father of one of the wizards that was in Auror Cromwell’s care and I’ve come to petition Family Services to name me his legal guardian.”
Hermione blushed as Ryan flipped the page and she came face to face with a picture of a wizard who looked to be in his mid-twenties wearing a set of Quidditch robes and a smile.  That probably wouldn’t have been so bad, if it wasn’t for the fact that the robes were open and there was nothing under them, thus bearing the subject’s attributes for all to see.
“Some interesting information has come to light,” Nick answered, as he relayed everything that Alaric had told them.
“Your motives don’t matter,” Asmodeus said. “I am King of the Hells, and if I decide that you are to be punished, you will be. Now, what would be a fitting punishment for you, hmm? There’s no ice in Phlegethos, so I can’t very well imprison you in an iceberg like I did to Levistus. And as amusing as Baazlebul’s transformation into a giant slug that trails garbage and feces wherever he goes was, I think something different is in order.”
“Because they think that Fleur is my girlfriend,” Bill answered.  “Until a few months ago, Fleur was convinced that I was her mate and she was using her powers on me almost every second of the day to make me fawn all over her like I was completely head over heels in love with her.  I probably would have ended up having sex with her if it wasn’t for the fact that her parents insisted that all the proper tests were done first to ensure that I actually was her mate.”

It has come to our attention that the most recent ship carrying prisoners bound for Azkaban Fortress has been attacked.  The ship arrived at the prison late yesterday afternoon with all the prisoners gone and the crew and Aurors aboard the ship all dead.  Ministry officials have confirmed that it appears that You-Know-Who sent a large team of Dementors to attack the vessel.
“Actually, I don’t,” Draco drawled.  “You are the last person in the world I would ever want to ask out on a date.”
"So, what is the afterlife like?"  Elphias asked.
“Success?”  Adrian asked.  “You call torturing and murdering hundreds of innocent people to be a successful route to anything?  The end does not justify the means, Vaisey, and even then I do not believe for a second that the Wizarding world would be better off by keeping all the bloodlines pure.  Actually, I think it’s causing more problems than its solving.”
Now it was Belial’s turn to gulp. “Almost 200 years, my lord?”
“I called him Draco.”
Blaise, Draco, and Pansy followed Adrian into his private room, at which point he locked the door and cast a silencing charm so that nobody outside would hear the conversation.
Cedric and Zach hugged each other tightly.  They may have been born two years apart, but they shared a birthday and had always been very close; much more like brothers than cousins.
“He’s not lying, Dad,” Cedric said as the door to the adjoining room opened and Cedric stepped into the room.  “As you can see, I’m not dead.  I was, but I’m not anymore.”
“What’s up, Hermione?  You and Ryan find anything tonight?”
"Isn't as evil as some of the others?"  Severus asked, clearly annoyed with Angelique's choice of words.
Harry then explained to Blaise about everything that had been going on recently.  He made sure to leave out any mention of what had been learned about Voldemort and Tom Riddle, or about Sirius being in the Hells.  Upon finishing his tale, Madame Pomfrey walked over and startled all three boys when she spoke.
"Well, I do have a friend," Harry said, "that I've, well that I've, um, slept with on numerous occasions. We've talked about it though and we both agree that we're better off as very good friends then we would be as a couple."
“Well, if I find anything, I’ll let you know.”
*	*	*
"I was wrong, Molly," Dumbledore admitted.  "It's recently come to my attention that this young man has been held in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor, being tortured by Voldemort himself, for over fifty years now."
“I know, Erevan, I know.”
“Am I the only one in the room who finds this entire conversation strange?”  Ron asked.
Daily Prophet
“Snapped his wand?” Dumbledore asked in a grave tone, not liking the direction Snape’s tale was going in one bit.  Normally, he might have been overjoyed at the thought of Voldemort snapping his wand and giving up wizardry, as if that would ever happen, but knowing what Voldemort really was, the fact that he’d snapped his wand had dire repercussions that Dumbledore didn’t like to contemplate.
“Yes, Blaise, I do,” Draco said.  “Why did you have to tell him that?”
“Good idea, Bill,” Matthew said as he stood up.  “I’m going to go up to the Owlery.  You two stay here and have fun at the Ball, I’ll be back soon.”
The Heirs must help us unite inside her,
“Hi Hermione,” Harry said weakly.
Draco followed as Asheera walked up the stairs and entered the temple.  Upon entering, Draco was again in awe as he took in the decadent elegance of the room.  The walls and floors were highly polished white marble, accented by black marble pillars.  The center of the room was dominated by a ten-foot tall statue of Persephone, which like the statues Draco had seen at a distance on the palace, was painted to show the goddess in full-color.
"That fact is the only reason I haven't killed you yet!"  Lucius exclaimed.
Draco's knees gave way, and he collapsed to the ground in immense pain.  He tried for several minutes not to cry out, but as the pain coursing through his body continued to worsen, he just couldn't stand it anymore and began screaming in agony.  Lucius laughed as Draco screamed and writhed around on the floor.  Draco was screaming so loudly that Lucius didn't hear the sound of footsteps running up the stairs.  Narcissa Malfoy ran into the room and took in the sight before her with a horrified expression on her face.  Having come running the second she heard Draco cry out, she hadn't even grabbed her wand in her haste to come see what was wrong with her beloved son.  Despite that, she couldn't allow this to continue, and was thankful for the time she had spent learning how to perform some spells without a wand.  Striding forward, she pointed at Draco and said, "Finite Incantatem!"
*	*	*
At this point, Ollivander turned back to his task and began trying to find the appropriate wand for James.  After trying a couple that didn't work, he finally found one that was just right.  An 11 1/4 inch mahogany wand that was almost identical to the first wand that Ollivander had sold to him when he was eleven.  The only difference being that this one was a fourth of an inch longer and had a phoenix feather core, whereas the first wand had a dragon heartstring from a Swedish Short-Snout.  To test his new wand, and to perhaps prove that he was still a Marauder at heart, he did a bit of complicated Transfiguration, turning Dumbledore's desk into a stag.
“What does he have to do with anything?”  Slytherin asked.
“They look like,” Hermione said, “but they can’t be, they’re dead.”
“Because the Malfoy family solicitors will only take orders from Lucius until I come of age,” Draco answered.  “If I was of age, I’d be suing you for everything your worth for libel and invasion of privacy.”
Nick nodded, went over to the cabinet and hissed at it in Parseltongue.  The door glowed green for a moment before popping open to reveal a large volume bound in black dragonhide resting inside.  Picking up the book, Nick brought it over to a nearby bookstand and noticing that it was locked, and he had seen no key, Nick hissed at the book, as Salazar just smiled and said, “You’re catching on, Nicholas.  The potion you want is on page 239.”
A jet of red light shot forth from Charles' wand and hit Lucius, causing him to fall to the floor next to Narcissa's corpse, stunned.  Charles then knelt beside Draco "It's okay, Draco.  You're safe now."
"Good, good," Ollivander said, as he handed the goblet back to Narcissa, who sipped some of its contents herself, before allowing Lily, Dumbledore, and James to sample her handiwork - all of whom agreed it was delicious.  "Now, gentleman, please present your wand arms."
“I always thought you were a weak little bastard, Malfoy,” the voice said.  “Finding you here crying your eyes out only proves I was right.”
Ryan rolled his eyes and said, “Well, just above his name there’s a listing for an Ariana Merope Riddle, born June 26, 1925.  It doesn’t list a death date and goes on to list her age as 71, so I guess whoever this Ariana is, she’s still alive.”
“You know, Creevey, you’re very lucky that I’m only sixteen,” Draco drawled.
“What nonsense is this?”  Snape asked.
Dumbledore paused to conjure himself a cup of tea and took a sip before continuing.  "Now, let’s get back to the subject of sorting.  Each house has qualities that it holds in high regard, and the Sorting Hat will determine which house it thinks you belong in based on those qualities.  For example, Gryffindor values bravery, so if the hat judges someone to be exceptionally brave, they will likely find themselves in Gryffindor.  Ravenclaw values intelligence, Hufflepuff values loyalty, and Slytherin values cunning.  Now, Minerva, if you would be so kind as to place the hat on Mr. Cromwell's head, we will begin."
"My condolences," Nicolas said.
Oliver handed over his wand.
*	*	*
“Okay, fine, I was crying. I swear, Potter, if you tell anyone, I’ll...”
“First off, call me Zach,” Zacharias said.  “Secondly, I agree, the cup wasn’t useless junk, that would have been something my family would have treasured.  However, from what my grandfather told my dad, with the exception of a few trinkets, most of Hepzibah’s collection was useless junk that most people would never even give a second glance, let alone waste money to buy it.”
"What have I told you about using that filthy name?"  Lucius admonished. "I demand you show me the proper respect and call me 'Father'!"
“Well, you’re a good friend,” Harry said, “so, I’m going to tell you this but it can’t leave this room.  I also found out that my name isn’t really Harry.  Turns out it’s just a nickname born from a misunderstanding on Hagrid’s part.  My name is actually Aarik.”
"Say what?" Ryan asked.
“I don’t care!”  Pansy shouted.  “Draco is worth it!  Besides, why do I care if I don’t get any of my family’s money?  Draco’s family is loaded and he’s the only heir.”
“That’s correct. Now, tell me, Mr. Potter, what is its use?”
“Yes, well, what can I say?”  Rowena asked.  “Just because I’m an intellectual doesn’t mean that I am not a woman.  I still love to look my best and the presence of gray hair on my head was just not something I was ready to face at that point in time.”
Rufus stood silently for a moment, before he lowered his wand, and put it into a pocket on his robes.  “This tour had better be convincing.  If it isn’t, I’m afraid I will have no choice but to order Mr. Laitannen’s arrest and I will see that he spends the next several years in Azkaban.  The Dementors might have abandoned the prison, but it still is not a pleasant place to spend one’s time.”
“You saw the Prophet this morning,” Aarik grinned.  “It says we’re dating.”
‘Maybe Ryan could use some help,’ Harry thought as he donned his cloak, activated the map and headed for Ravenclaw territory.
“What do you mean?”  Harry asked as he looked up at Hermione again.
“Wow, where did you get it?”
“Why don’t you two sit down on the bed?”  Adrian asked as he pushed his desk chair over so that he could sit right in front of them.
“Take Charms,” McGonagall said, “and I shall make sure to send an owl to Augusta reminding her that the subject isn’t totally useless just because she failed her Charms O.W.L.”
“Yes, Ginny, there is,” Harry responded, as he relayed the information that had recently become known about Voldemort and Tom Riddle.
Draco and Blaise nodded before they sat down on Adrian’s bed, as Adrian uncorked the Veritaserum and carefully put three drops of the potion into both Draco and Blaise’s mouths.  With Adrian standing in front of him, Pansy didn’t see the look that Draco gave Adrian, but Adrian caught it and understood the silent question that the younger boy was asking.
To be continued.
“I take it that you and Harry were together at some point, Bill?”  Valen asked.
“What in Merlin’s name is that?”  Sinistra asked.
“You mean that Ariana Merope Riddle is my grandmother?”
“Yes,” Matthew said.
“Well, at least you two remember to use silencing charms,” Ryan commented.  “Unlike a certain two professors I know.”
Colin smiled at Andrew and was about to thank him for stopping the bubbles when another floated out of his mouth, popped and said, “Colin sleeps naked.”
“Oh where are my manners?”  Corelian asked.  “Corelian Anilus Laitannen, Supreme Lord of the Circle of Atlantis at your service.  And this is my wife, Lady Asheera Liana Lasinius-Laitannen.”
“Yes, Draco Malfoy.  The night that Ryan found out he was an heir, Rowena told him and a small group of students how to cast the Mass-Book Restoration charm on her collection.  Draco was one of them, who then spent the night in Rowena’s quarters that night.  I’ve become an early riser because of our morning runs, so I’m now usually the first one awake in the mornings.  I saw that Draco’s bed wasn’t slept in, so since nobody else was awake yet, I messed up the bedding to make it look like it had been slept in.”
“His father is alive?”
“Prepare to eat your words,” Justin said as Ryan reached up to the wall and traced the letters ‘R.F.R’ on one of the bricks.  The three letters immediately started glowing bright blue and the now familiar blue line emerged from the top of the ‘F’ to trace the shape of a door.  Matthew and Oliver just stood there with shocked expressions as the door opened and Ryan said, “Welcome to the private quarters of Rowena Fiona Ravenclaw, Matthew and Oliver.  Please come in.”
Harry isn’t on the other side of the door.  He is out there, hiding. That is the only chance he has left, to hide from the light and what it does to him. To hide from the teeth and the claws and the eyes, the eyes that are everywhere and see everything.
But then, it had always been easy for Pansy. Pansy isn’t afraid of defying all the rules, doing whatever she wants with whoever she wants without consideration for traditional values. Pansy claims it allows her to breathe, free and rebellious and learning all life has to offer, learning all
“The stars, I never got the stars,” Potter admits, though he doesn’t sound like is aware of the confession he is making.
(Himself, possibly, and if that doesn’t garner him at least some pity, he might as well get drunk, sad and pathetic on his own.)
Thus, Draco concludes Potter did a bit of cleaning up. The dragon isn’t there anymore because it’s defeated, no longer important and nothing more to it.
Movie night at Seamus’ and Deans place was always a bad idea. They are too many people to fit into their small living room comfortably, which meant half of them were forced to sit on the floor (Harry’s excuse of ‘I died for all of you’ didn’t even hold a month before he, too, was cruelly pushed onto the floor so Ginny could claim his spot on the couch) and there was absolutely no concept of personal space, which Harry has to admit isn’t too bad.
had been the one cheerfully reminding them that this is a
“Children, of course. Keep up, Malfoy. See, I don’t think either of us really has the hips for childbearing but I think I could make the pregnant look work for me. What do you think?” Potter looks at him with all seriousness, honestly expecting an answer to his ridiculous question.
“Because, Pansy, brilliant as you might be, you cannot read my mind. I didn’t tell you of my aversion and so you gave your advice based on not even half of the facts I was sure of, at that point. That is
To get up, though, he needs to pull himself up with nothing to hold on to but the hair. Potter’s hair, right, Draco still doesn’t comprehend this, with just the hair out here and no sign of Potter.
Weasley is more complicated to read, possibly because Draco actively avoided ever learning. It's true, they tell you to know your enemies and keep them close and all, but Draco would really prefer not to. Plus, in the end, it has always been more Potter than Weasley who warranted that treatment. Now Draco wishes he had maybe paid a little more attention, perhaps he could read something out of the chaos on Weasley’s face then.
Potter jerks back as if Draco slapped him.
10 minutes later, and Harry succeeded in his quest, if you look at it in the right light. He got Draco to laugh, even! Unfortunately, Harry strongly suspects that has more to do with his grumpy face than any allusions to having tickled Draco into recognising Harry’s superior skills.
Something scratches at the windows. It blocks out the light of the moon entirely, and Draco stifles a whimper against his palm.
how bad it was. Draco can’t say why he doesn’t rip Potter’s non-existent cooking abilities to shreds, why he doesn’t point out any of the numerous problems and instead says nothing at all. He blames it on the food affecting his brain and decides not to dwell on it. He can rub Potter’s face in his own inferiority later.
The entire scene is set up like a courtroom, to intimidate and imitate what Hermione knows and feels comfortable with. There is Harry, partly still bandaged from his involuntary fall (it’s not necessary, he is healed and wasn’t all that grievously injured to begin with, but Ron had smirked at him when he wrapped the cloths around his head, told him he would have to look as hurt as possible if they want to properly exploit the
“Now I don’t
“Weasley, is that you?” Draco is hoping for it, though Granger would be more useful. It’s about time Weasley gets catapulted into something he doesn’t eagerly indulge.
, but he also can’t profess complete ignorance on Harry’s sensitivity concerning that couch. Harry fought tooth and nail to keep it when Draco went through the house, marking what would need to go and what could stay, either until their new furniture arrived or permanently. They finally agreed to mark the couch to be kept temporarily, until they could renegotiate.
high strung, no idea he could fall this deep.
Draco doesn’t expect the attack, not when they are being adult and well-mannered and impressing his mother, and he splutters, coughing up tea and spilling most of the cup’s contents over his lap. Harry doesn’t bother hiding his smirk. After all, it’s not

“What do you want?” Weasley shouts from inside, not bothering to come out and face Draco, setting an aggressive tone. Draco supposes that is alright for
Draco screams as his opponent throws himself at him, ducks out of the way only barely, looses his balance in the process and has to cling to the murderous stranger so as not to fall. He lets go quickly, pushing himself away and stumbling backwards, towards Potter and away from the man.
Draco, unaware of the doom quickly approaching to announce the end of movie nights, heaves a long suffering sigh.
is what Grimmauld demands.” Potter pauses, looking at Draco as he contemplates something. Draco doesn't want to know what more he could have to say, more of the previous probably, but he also doesn't know how to stop him and if Draco doesn't have a brilliant idea soon —
Before Draco can make up his mind on that one (whether it would be horribly cowardly and if he cares even if it is), Potter saunters into the kitchen as if he owns it. Which, technically, he does. But it was
to him, to the body sitting here covered in ferrets. Now though, now Harry is acutely aware. Draco, who makes horrible coffee and obsesses over his plans, who wrinkles his nose at the books Harry reads and tries so hard not to pull a grimace at his cooking, who gives astonishingly good hugs and whose hair is unfairly shiny, Draco is haunted by the war the same way Harry is.
It’s also not all simple, however, and Draco is naturally inclined to take the other route and deny there is something wrong. With enough imagination, you can fool yourself into believing anything.
Draco knows that he is hurting for Harry and the things he must be giving up by being with Draco, hurting for a future when he won’t settle for crumbs — not anymore.
he hurts, but it does give Draco something to do, a way to sort through and categorise the pain. Draco feels more comfortable once he’s done that, once he knows what he is dealing with.
“Do I
Surprise splashes over Potter, the smile breaking open into something wider, amused and flattered and above all inviting. Potter leans closer, barely enough to make a suggestion, the gentlest of pushes.
In rare instance of mercy, being aware actually does make it easier to handle. Usually knowing you are being baited doesn't help at all.
Weasley, because he is as bad as Potter and resistant to the grave nature of their mission, is dancing to Potter’s horrible singing, moving steadily closer to Potter’s makeshift stage. And then, because loosing Weasley’s insight into the workings of Potter’s mind isn’t bad enough yet, he starts singing, too. (He is, it has to be said, marginally better than Potter at it, but just as loud and enthusiastic.)
“You invited Blaise?”
So then he fucked Malfoy and it was amazing. Not the best he ever had, sure, but pretty decent nonetheless. Especially considering Malfoy was a virgin, even when he didn’t admit to it in so many words. He didn't need to say it anyway, Harry could have told alone form the way he kissed. There was something hesitant about all of Malfoy’s movements, something unsure and pliant, only too happy to follow Harry’s lead. And lead he did, gentle and careful, because he might not like the git but no one deserves painful sex (unless it’s been agreed upon before and everyone consented). Malfoy barely consented to the fairly tame basics Harry kept them to, first skittish like a young foal and then suddenly almost impassive. That’s alright though, Harry will coax him out of his shell, they are only just beginning.
that!” Potter strokes the book like it’s one of the monster things they had to buy in Third Year, soothing it like Draco upset it with this honest review of its condition. “It’s perfectly fine, a very good book. See, there are recipes to delicious cakes inside—it performs just as a fancier book would.”
in Malfoy’s voice, no scorn or derision.
Potter is saved. Falling through the air, sure, but Draco won’t let anything happen to him.
Potter turns around, startled, as Draco enters his shop, falling through the door like there is a hoard of vengeful centaurs hunting him. There are not, Draco is pretty sure, though he wouldn’t have noticed, too focused on getting to Potter.
With Plan B (appoint ally to talk to and include Draco) failed so spectacularly before it even fully started, there is only Plan A to return to.
Granger is shocked by his eager compliance, as well, considering Draco and trying to judge if he gave her wrong directions to mess with her. Draco didn’t, didn’t even think of it until it was too late. But she does throw him the letter, so, whatever Not Negotiating they did here, Draco is alright with it.

“What are you doing, Malfoy?” Potter looks at the violin like he never saw it before, looks at Draco like he is the one responsible for his disbelief (which he is, kind of).
Potter sighs, almost heavy enough to hide the smile. But Draco sees it, files it away as another piece adding up to the mystery of what became of Potter. Full of contractions, that man; that at least hasn’t changed.
lights up like someone told him the Chudley Cannons won the World Cup. Harry immediately feels less desolate. Ron grew up with the twins as his brothers and can hold his own as well as can be expected, there is no one Harry would have rather on his side in a war against his petty house and even more petty (… husband? Ew.)

Draco opens his eyes to glare at him, to remember that there is more than the galaxy of stars exploding under Potter’s fingers, but he looses his breath to Potter’s smirk, the satisfied and confident way Potter handles him.

it’s going to eat him alive — they will do it on Ron’s terms.
They have become horribly dull and domestic in what they fight about, whose turn it is to do the dishes and whether they can get rid of the ferrets yet (that one is purely for appearance sake, Draco has gotten used to having one of the sneaky little buggers to pet and teach how to do tricks, he wouldn’t give them up even if Potter suddenly changed his mind and agreed to return them). They argue about the decorations Draco planned as if Potter actually gets any say in them. Ever now and they even find things they can both complain about, Grimmauld forcing them together when they both already had separate plans for the evening, their friends being stupid and intrusive and making pointed remarks about their relationship as if they know anything about it.
and if Draco managed to convince him of anything, he hopes it’s that.
Harry grins at him, much broader than Draco thought him capable so early in the morning. “Yeah, I’d like that.”
and on everyone, and before Harry knows what is happening, he is wildly picking up all the crumbs he can grab to hurl them at anyone who stands unmoving for too long in the sudden chaos. He flings the stuff with both hands, snatches as many as he can out of the air and tries to ignore the other ones pelting down onto him.
“I think you will find that I
(This is purely a mourning of his prospective career, that’s nothing to do with Potter.)
Ron doesn’t seem to know what to answer to that, or perhaps he is giving Harry time to process what he said, but Harry appreciates the following silence in either case. He has a lot to think about.
It is still night and cold when Draco is back and as he blinks awake, nearly loosing his footing in his stumbling for some sense of his surrounding. It’s a rooftop, the beam Draco is standing on very thin and the potential drop very steep.

at Harry, before he realises how utterly inappropriate that is and dims it down a few suns. Harry narrows his eyes at him. What is going on?
So, keep Pansy away from his hair and don’t join another vile group of grumbling morons—Draco can learn from the past to make a better future! He totally can. This is why he came to Blaise in his newest time of need, because his other friends have proven themselves incapable and Weasley might have been surprisingly helpful, but Draco would rather not lose yet another game of chess to the smug ginger. (Very smug, very ginger—best not to repeat that experience.)

“Blaise, my dear, you are a genius.” Draco grins at him, slightly manic in his enthusiasm.
“Potter, if you can’t keep quiet I will leave you behind.” Draco wouldn’t, but threatening Harry into silence is far more efficient than laying out his reasoning. It also seems far more appropriate to their crouched position behind the Manors hedges.
On one hand, there are only so many ways Draco can tell Pansy to stop worrying and not take blame for things that aren’t her fault (it’s not usually a problem, Pansy is very skilled in slipping responsibility for the things she
Blaise and Theo don’t even have the good grace to feign shame, heads bend back over their scribbles, both of them whispering furiously and gesticulating widely.
“I’m apologise, I was under the impression that you both occupy Grimmauld Place 12, The Ancient and Most Noble House of Black,” Narcissa says, one eyebrow raised in what could be either a harmless request for clarification or a polite murder threat. Harry is very familiar with that expression — Draco quirks his eyebrows the same way.
This is where Draco loved to return to every summer.
Potter doesn’t look convinced. He is biting his lips, which means he is at least thinking about what Draco said. That’s good, there is no talking about Potter returning if he isn’t prepared to deal with the press that will haunt him, more vicious now that there actually is something to report on.
Potter makes a muffled noise against the table, head resting on the unforgiving surface, hair thrown around him like a black halo, one arm laid out on the table like he is reaching for Draco.
, either.)
panicked and Harry has no idea what he did to provoke that kind of reaction but whatever, Malfoy leaving the bed to him means he doesn’t have to share, anything else can wait until tomorrow. If only because Malfoy is already out of the door, so he would have to get up and run after him and try to convince Malfoy to stay and really, that just isn’t worth the effort.
“Potter, I told you we have a tight schedule today. Move out of the way.” Malfoy looks like he is mere inches away from simply

It’s nice, better than mindlessly hurling around words or whatever is close enough to reach in an attempt to burn the energy racing through his veins. Harry doesn’t know how Malfoy does it, standing rooted to the spot should be the opposite of helpful, but Malfoy’s concern feels like a soft blanket wrapped around him, comfort sinking through Harry’s tense muscles and warming him to his core. Malfoy’s movements are careful, tender, sliding over Harry’s head and draining him of the itching of his restless nerves.

Thankfully, this kind of information doesn't require a response (at least there is nothing
“Personally, I always thought you fell somewhere on the Asexuality spectrum.”
They developed an unexpectedly intimate relationship, considering they don’t have a conversation outside of Potter’s flowers, but Draco has taken to buying three cups of tea: one for Potter, one for Mary, and one for himself. Out of the two of them, Mary is far more appreciative of Draco’s attention, laughing as he flatters her and wistfully talking about the grand life they could have, if she were 20 years younger and Draco more interested in women. Draco didn’t anticipate this, but he
Harry sorts his world similarly, though Draco never realised it before. It’s the hero complex mixed in, the burden of surviving his parents and his godfather and his mentor, of surviving the curse that killed everyone else unlucky enough to have it directed at them. Harry might not
Draco is oddly calm about that realisation. He remembers the Manor, when he would spring upright in bed at the creak of a floorboard outside his door, much more aware of who could be out there and how very much he doesn’t want them to come in than he was of the heavy protection spells and wards he wrought for exactly that reason. Draco feels the same fear now, the sense of danger settling over him and making his hair stand on edge, but it’s dulled, far away. Mostly, he feels Harry, the beating of his heart and the rhythm of his breathing, feels his calm and surety, his determination.
Right, that explains the embarrassment. Though Harry didn’t expect Malfoy to be such a prude. He’s half tempted to play dumb, ask Malfoy to clarify because his poor uncultured brain doesn’t understand his fancy and proper awkwardness. He also does want to get out of here today, and he suspects hearing Malfoy talk about sex might not only take up more time than he is willing to spare, but also make up for the revolting personality in Harry’s skewed calculations on his objective attractiveness.
They must look insane, sitting on the floor and laughing with tears in their eyes, but Grimmauld doesn’t seem to mind and, honestly, Harry doesn’t know what it would have to do to break the moment. Laughter is a powerful ally.
should just stop naming her; it’s not like we have all that many owls between ourselves that they would need great distinction.
“You sure you know how to do this, Potter?” he asks, because a flustered Potter is the most fun to tease.
“I know I said it wasn’t worth the way, stupidly far away, but I remember you loving hanging with your feet up.” That was a good day, actually, Potter swirling in the silks and completely ignoring their fussing instructor, hanging from the ceiling like a bat, laughing breathlessly and only his hair grazing the floor. “I know you enjoyed yourself.”
Malfoy, arrogant git, looks far too pleased with himself, going as far as to

and moved in together, and Grimmauld was rather pushy for a stuffy old house — it shouldn’t came as a surprise that they had gotten closer in the process. The crying and the hugging was unexpected, as was the laughter, but looking back, Draco doesn’t see how it could have been different. He doesn’t
Draco watches in astonishment. That is not like Potter at all, choosing to preserve his dignity and leaving before he can embarrass himself. Draco doesn’t like this development. He doesn’t like not knowing. He’ll have to keep an eye on that. For now Draco has workers to command, and with Potter gone he can finally concentrate on his task.
For the first time, Harry is actively grateful that Ron only gave him a pitying look when everyone was out buying furniture and appliances for their new place and Harry suggested getting

But jealousy doesn’t listen to reason, and Harry doesn't try to fight it as he glares at Parkinson. Fighting it is as successful as ignoring it, after all, and in the end all you can do with jealousy is drown it and spit it out like vitriol, lest it borrows deep inside of you to nest and fester. It’s an ugly emotion, without a doubt, but that is the thing with ugly emotions, they stick, and they take, and there is no getting rid of them, no

Pansy doesn’t possess enough decency to do the polite thing and pretend she didn’t do it on purpose, laughing at him and once again playing with the ferret.

if he weren't. He could have avoided this whole crisis, could have used his time better than questioning and wondering and reading seedy books to understand what he is supposed to be feeling. Instead, Draco is lost, floating in that new term and all its variations and shades, trying to form an opinion.

“Are you sure you want to marry me?” Draco has made it a habit of asking Harry if he is sure, if this is honestly what he wants, and if he is serious when he says Draco can plan whatever he wants as long as they are married at the end of the day.

thinking about it. They can do whatever they want, Harry won’t judge, but he doesn’t need to know.
“You know I want you to, don’t you?” Potter asks, lips wrapping around the words and presenting them like a gift, permission and plead wrapped in one. “I want it too, Draco, everything.”
“I don’t know, Harry. You should really ask Malfoy all of this, it’s just a theory.” Right,
Potter is wearing a ball gown, the colour a rich and vibrant yellow, shinning and shimmering in the light. The colour is warm like the sun, beautiful on Potter’s brown skin and strong in a way his other dresses weren’t. It clings to Potter’s torso, floating out into a wide skirt at his waist, moving in great waves with every step he takes. There are complicated patterns on the skirt, things Draco can only marvel at because he doesn’t know their name, doesn’t know how to properly describe them. He doesn’t have too much time to figure it out, eyes drawn back to Potter’s face, to his hair and the simple gold jewellery holding it out of his face, to his radiant smile.
doesn’t take too kindly to being told what to do (or to being pointed at, Harry had a lot of fun with that one when he first realised back in Third Year) and he doesn’t like to rely on Muggles—or anyone, for that matter; though Harry supposes them being Muggles doesn’t help—for his defence.
not weird. Maybe… it does seem rather weird, doesn’t it? But it’s
— but usually it’s considered polite to do introductions first. That also would have ensured Harry treat Draco’s beloved dragon with the appropriate care and reverence, but the veiled warning isn’t necessary. Good for Harry, things would not have ended well for him otherwise.
“No, This hurt unfairly much considering we fell into the only chair you have here and it could have been much worse.” Harry doesn’t sound too good, clenching his teeth against the ache.
He hates Harry, kind and patient and
“You wouldn’t say that if you knew the pain I am in. Excruciating, Potter, excruciating pain.” Draco isn’t sure, but he thinks Potter might be laughing at him. That’s alright, he is very considerate and quiet in it.
Unfortunately, there is no way out of it. None that Draco can see at least, and he looked very thoroughly. Draco even considered admitting to his deceit and receiving Harry’s anger without the agony of humiliating himself first, but ultimately decided against it. It would be the right thing to do, of that he is sure, not dragging this out until the last possible second and doing Harry the courtesy of confessing, but Draco has never been a brave man. Owning up to your mistakes, holding your head high and looking them in the eyes when you say that yes, you did something wrong? That takes a good chunk more courage than could be safely contained inside of Draco.
She doesn’t believe him, far too accustomed to sniffing out lies to fall for his stumbling efforts. If Draco is lucky, she will decide to let it go, to let him make his own mistakes and learn the lesson the only way that ever seems to stick with him: falling on his face under great pains and humiliation.
“Hello Godric,” Harry said, “this is Ginny Weasley, a fellow Gryffindor.  She’s a fifth year and a good friend.”
Just last night, Harry had a chat with Ryan who informed him that he was dating Justin Finch-Fletchley now and that Draco had caught them snogging in a broom cupboard on the third floor the previous night.  Harry was frankly surprised that the news wasn’t all over the school now and that Draco didn’t take any points or attempt to get Ryan and Justin in trouble.  Harry knew that Justin was a prefect now, so he knew that Draco couldn’t take points from him, but that doesn’t mean he couldn’t take points from Ryan.  They were family, yes, but Harry never would have believed that fact alone would stop Draco from getting anyone in trouble.
“So, you mean to say it’s different in the wizarding world?”  Harry asked, very curious.
*	*	*
“You’re on, Matt,” Ryan said. “I hope you’re prepared to lose. Care to make a wager, Oliver?”
“Mr. Malfoy, will you please grow up and act your age?”  Madam Pomfrey said.  “Honestly, all of this carrying on about a broken toe!  If you don’t stop it right now, I’ll just leave your toe broken and you really won’t be able to walk tomorrow.”
“You know him?”  Oliver asked.
*	*	*
"Well, they didn't actually tell me," Ryan said as he walked over. "I put it together on my own after I um, well, suffice it to say that Matthew and Oliver really need to learn to use a silencing charm when engaging in certain activities."
“Were any of the Death Eaters caught?”  Harry asked.
"I'm not surprised, Draco," Charles said. "Your family disowned my mother. They had never seen eye to eye on anything and they were furious when she was sorted into Ravenclaw, instead of Slytherin. The last straw came when she had two brief romances with people that they did not agree with, followed by her marriage to my father, William Cromwell, whom they also didn't agree with."
“Yeah, same here,” Stephen said as he took Kevin’s hand in his and they prepared to leave the dorm.  “Happy Christmas, guys, and we’ll see you next year.”
“What?”  Draco asked as he turned to look at Harry, fear clearly showing in his eyes.  Fear that he had just lost Harry as a friend.
“Somebody is breaching the wards,” Dumbledore said.
Harry Potter offered me his hand.  I still can’t believe it to be honest.  Of course, I haven’t told him, but I wish it had been offering me his hand in marriage instead of friendship.  This, my dear journal, is something that you already know, but nobody else does as I’ve kept it well hidden: I’ve had a major crush on Harry since fourth year.  A crush which I’m sure has developed into love; well, I’m not totally sure, because I don’t have much experience with romantic love, but I do know that my feelings for Harry are something which I’ve never felt for anyone else.
“Professor Snape, Potter,” McGonagall admonished, stressing the Professor.
Taking a few minutes to make it seem like he had gone to use the restroom, Corelian returned to the dining room and sat back down.
“Using that infernal stick of wood these people at Hogwarts call a wand,” Valen answered.  “I realize that they aren’t as magically advanced as our society, but I can’t believe that they haven’t realized that their infernal wands are actually limiting their powers.”
Well, at any rate, I can be thankful that Hogwarts starts soon and I can get out of this house. Hopefully I'll be lucky enough for Lucius not to arrive home from his business trip until after I've left for school. That's probably asking for too much, but one can hope, right? Oh well, one of the house-elves just came to tell me that Blaise has arrived. I'm sure he told my mother that he just wanted to welcome me home and ask how the trip was, but knowing him as well as I do, I'm sure he has other reasons for coming as well; reasons which will have us naked in my bed before he leaves. Not that I'm complaining or anything.
“The Temple District,” Asheera answered.  “More precisely, our destination is the Temple of Persephone.”
"Well, most of my family has been in Ravenclaw for generations," Ryan thought.  "So, I think I'd prefer to follow in that tradition if possible.  While I'm sure that Slytherin is nice, and I'll be the first to admit that I can be cunning when I want to be, I've always thought of my intelligence as my best trait."
I’m still in a state of shock, to be perfectly honest.  I knew that each of the four Hogwarts founders had an heir in the school, but I never expected to be related to one of them.  I knew that I wasn’t an heir because if the Malfoy family had been related to any of the founders, Lucius would have made a point of mentioning it at some point, well, at least if we were related to Slytherin or maybe Ravenclaw.  If we had been related to Gryffindor or Hufflepuff, Lucius would have hid the fact and probably killed anyone who found out.
"Hmm, Mr. Delaney, where shall I put you?  You seem to possess many of the traits that all four houses value.  You are intelligent, which would suggest Ravenclaw.  You are also brave and loyal, which would suggest Gryffindor or Hufflepuff.  I also see a certain amount of cunning in your personality, which would suggest Slytherin.  Hmm, let's see here, you also appear to have quite a bit of ambition and that coupled with your cunning makes me think that you would do best in…  SLYTHERIN!"
“Now, the Time Suspension charm can be used during dueling and depending on the power the caster chooses to put into casting it, the charm freezes time for thirty seconds to a minute, allowing them time to cast other spells without interruption.”
“Well, that is actually Sirius and Hagrid’s fault,” Remus replied.  “Sirius always used to call you Ari for short, and Hagrid misunderstood and thought he was saying Harry.  After that, the nickname caught on and even James started using it, much to Lily’s displeasure.”
“Well, that’s good to know, actually,” Bill said.  “Dumbledore asked all the professors to try and put out some feelers to try and determine the loyalties of all the students, so he’ll be pleased to know that there are at least some Slytherin students who don’t support You-Know-Who.  Anyway, let’s get you back to your dorm now.”
*	*	*
Godric remained silent for awhile and then said, “You’ve given me quite a bit to think about, Aarik.  If you’ll excuse me, I’d like to be alone now.”
So, standing up, Harry hugged Hermione and said, “Thanks for the help.  You’re a good friend.”
“Well, I’ve had a thought,” Harry said.  “I was thinking I could call in a life debt that one of the Death Eaters owes me.  We could then make him look like Tom with Polyjuice Potion and transfer the charm from Tom to the Death Eater.”
The War Hits Close to Home, Part One
“Yes, you’re right,” Godric said.  “Aarik, perhaps you can find a use for my private armory and training room.  The armory is charmed to have any weapon or armor you could ever want.  The training room is charmed so that nobody can get hurt in the room, whether it is from a weapon or by spell.  Even the Unforgivables can’t harm anyone in my training room.”
Before Dumbledore could reach the newcomers, Professor Valen Lasinius was standing in front of them with his hands on his hips and said in a voice that was easily heard throughout the quiet Hall, “Corelian, you old fool, you always did have a flair for the dramatic.”
'Better make sure it's all clear,' Ryan thought as he pulled a small silver chain, which caused two small circular holes to open in the wall. The holes actually allowed a person in the passageway to look into the room through the eyes of the portrait hanging above the fireplace. Since Matt's mother had been a Muggle, most of the portraits were all normal Muggle portraits that didn't move. The only rooms in the house that had wizard portraits were Charles' study, the library, and a large gallery on the third floor. Ryan looked through the small holes and saw that the room appeared to be empty. He did however notice that the bathroom door was closed and that light and steam were coming from underneath it.
"I'm Hermione Granger, by the way," the girl said as she held out her hand.
“You should also know that he’s been dating.”
"Clear the dishes," said the same voice that had called him.
“Quite right, Remus,” Dumbledore said with a smile.  “The reason I asked all of you to come here today has to do with something that young Mr. Draco Malfoy did earlier today with the assistance of Lady Asheera.  This may come as a bit of shock and I’m sure you’ll think that I’m both crazy and lying, but Narcissa Malfoy, Cedric Diggory, and James and Lily Potter are no longer dead.”
Striding across the room to where his prisoner lay on the ground, Voldemort cast a spell to violently pull the boy to his feet. Looking into the boy’s eyes, Voldemort saw that he looked like Tom Riddle, but something was obviously wrong. Taking a step back, Voldemort pointed his wand at the boy’s left hand and muttered an incantation which caused a jet of acid to shoot from the tip of his wand. The boy screamed as the acid ate away at his flesh, but instead of bones, there was instead a hand made of solid silver under the flesh. Voldemort now understand what the clanging noise had been – Wormtail’s silver hand hitting the stone wall.
“Well, Ryan, you know why we didn’t get together before now,” Nick said.  “Once school started and Bill was revealed as our Potions professor, I figured I couldn’t date him.”
Chapter Two
“What does that have to do with anything?”  Susan asked as she looked at her housemate with a look of total confusion on her face.
“You are truly insane if you think that I’m going to believe any of this.  Nobody can live to be as old you claim to be, let alone as old as you claim these Tyriand and Isulus people were.”
"When is your birthday anyway?" Ryan asked. "Mine is April Twenty-First."
Storming into the Slytherin common room, Adrian marched over to where Crabbe and Goyle were sitting and yelled, “What the bloody hell do you buffoons think you were doing?”
“I can’t even begin to tell you how many times I’ve dreamt of hearing those words, Ryan.  You’ve never left my thoughts over the last sixteen years and I’ll always feel bad that I wasn’t there for you, but I’m glad that you understand why I wasn’t.”
“Lena, dear, I hope you realize just how silly that worry was.  I never wanted to leave you, I loved you more then life itself, but even if I had wanted to, you know I couldn’t.  We were bonded, in case you forgot, which made going our separate ways impossible.”
"Um, yes." The elf nodded and Ryan could see that the elf desperately wanted to punish itself, but it didn't because Ryan distinctly remembered his grandmother telling him that she had long time ago forbidden the house-elves to punish themselves. "But not this. No, no, not this. Master Matthew insisted. Threatened Barin and other elves, sir. Said he'd give us clothes if we told!"
Lost in his thoughts, he didn’t notice when the guard walked up to him, until the guard cleared his throat and said, “Excuse me, my Lordship, but His Majesty will see you now.”
Percy pushed the lever and soon the sound of gears grinding into action could be heard.  The lift jolted upward a bit and then settled into a leisurely speed as it climbed higher and higher.
“Why?  Surely you have your own copy.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Voldemort is planning a raid on Inverness this weekend,” Snape said.  “He made it obvious that he intended to lead this raid himself, as he has been angry that the last few raids have been thwarted.”
“Possibly,” Godric said, “I never tried it or did any research on infusing clothing with the protections, so I can’t give a definite answer.”
Harry Potter and the Return of the Heirs
As if Dumbledore had read Harry’s mind, he said, “Now, I’m sure many of you are wondering who will be teaching Potions now that Professor Snape is no longer filling that position. Potions will now be taught by a person who is on loan to us from Gringott’s Wizarding Bank, where he works as one of their curse-breakers: Professor Weasley!”
"I don't recall father ever mentioning an Aunt Lucinda."
“You’re breaking up with me!?”
“Hello Potter,” the newcomer to the Hospital Wing said as he pulled a chair over and sat down next to Harry.
Ryan, Justin, Nick, Bill, Zach, and Hermione entered the room and the fireplace in the Gryffindor common room moved back into place, hiding the archway from sight.
Everyone in the room was silent for several minutes, until finally Alaric spoke again, “I’m ashamed of the way both of you acted.  You loved each other so much and then I died and you were so caught up in anger over my death that you both did atrocious things.  Unfortunately, Dad, your actions have brought forth an even worse evil then you intended.”
Lily smiled at the old wandmaker and said, "I'm sure none of us would blame you, if you did.  One definitely does not expect to ever see people who have died return from the grave."
“I don’t think so, Your Majesty,” Corelian said.  “The woman I love, the woman I intended to marry, just died giving me a son.  And instead of being where I belong, with my newborn son, I’m here.”
“You’ve been talking to Harry, haven’t you?”
“Gods, no,” Valen said quickly.  “I’m much too young and carefree to take on such a responsibility.”
“Professor Weasley told him to give it to him, Ron,” Hermione said in defense of Harry. “He is only doing what any student should do when asked to do something by a professor.  You’re a prefect, Ron, you should know that.”
“You are wasting your time, son of mine,” King Tyriand said.  “Corelian will stay here in Atlantis.”
“What of the students?”
Harry grinned at Seamus, sat down, and then said, “Let this serve as a lesson to everyone that this is what will happen to the next person who decides that I have no right to a private life.  Although, if there is a next time, I’ll make sure to cast it during dinner in the Great Hall, so the entire school can hear everything.”
Lucius' wand flew from his hand and he spun quickly on his heel to see who had disarmed him.  Recognizing the lone man standing in the doorway of Draco's bedroom, he exclaimed, "You!"
“As we told you in Professor Dumbledore’s office,” Asheera said, “pureblood Atlanteans often live an average of 750 plus years.  Half-Atlanteans generally tend to live an average of 500 plus years, rarely ever reaching the 600th year.  Although like pureblood Atlanteans, Half-Atlanteans are still eternally youthful.”
“What?”
“I know how you feel, Helga,” Rowena said.  “I couldn’t believe it myself.  With all the curtains drawn, I never was able to keep track of time, but I could hardly believe it when Ryan and Harry came to my quarters that first night and told me that it was 1996.”
Slytherin Quidditch Team Try-Outs
All eyes rose to look at the Slytherin hourglass.  Under each hourglass, a magically charmed scrap of parchment showed the points total and it automatically updated the total every time points were given or taken.  The parchment soon went from saying 147 to -853, as all the emeralds dropped out of the top half of the hourglass.
“Grandmother, did you know that you were adopted?”
At this point, Hannah started to hug Cedric again and started to kiss him all over his face, prompting him to groan and say, “Mum, I’m happy to be back, but please stop it, you’re embarrassing me.”
“Other, unrelated matters?” Belial asked.
*	*	*
*	*	*
“Wow, this is a lot to take in,” Ginny said.
“Well, some of them yes,” the woman agreed.  “However, I still fail to see the necessity of changing your hair and eye colors.  I’m sure there are plenty of people at Hogwarts with blond hair and green eyes.”
Harry was probably better then he had been at the Yule Ball, but he was sure that he was still bad enough that he’d look like an idiot at the ball without help.
“Well, first off, Dobby, have you heard the news?”
Draco had always enjoyed spending time alone with his mother, because when he was alone with her, he didn't have to put on the act that he put on in front of everyone else, especially his father. Lucius was insistent that Draco not show his emotions, saying that showing one's emotions was a sign of weakness and that Malfoys, especially Malfoy men, must never, ever be weak. If Draco showed emotion in front of Lucius, he'd be liable to be placed under the Cruciatus Curse for several minutes as punishment. With Narcissa, however, it was totally different, because she encouraged her son to show emotion and to not be the stuck-up spoiled brat that her husband tried to make him.
NATHAN MATTHEW POTTER, born 09-02-1870, died 10-06-1979, age 109
Managing Editor, Daily Prophet
“Honestly, madam, I have no idea,” Godric said.
Yes, my Lord, you read that last name correctly. Cedric Diggory is alive and back at Hogwarts. From what I overheard, it seems that Asheera Laitannen helped Draco Malfoy to journey to Tartarus and challenge Death for four souls. Cedric Diggory was one of them. The others were Narcissa Malfoy, James Potter, and Lily Potter.
“So you’re saying that your ancestors were powerful enough to sink a continent and have it survive at the bottom of the ocean?”  Rufus asked.  “Forgive me if I find that hard to believe.”
Hermione leaned over to Harry and whispered urgently, “The Prophet knows that you’re Gryffindor’s heir.”
“Yes and no,” a male voice that nobody recognized said.
“Ryan Cromwell is Ravenclaw’s heir, Zacharias Smith is Hufflepuff’s heir, Harry Potter is Gryffindor’s heir, and I am Slytherin’s heir,” Nick answered.
“That is a good reason, Pansy,” Draco said, “because in case you’ve missed it the other million times I’ve said it, I’m gay!”
“No,” Colin answered.
“I realize that, Mr. Pucey,” Snape drawled.  “However, I am a professor, as well as your Head of House.  In this house, what I say goes, and I say that you will not be kicking them off the team.  They’re four of Slytherin’s best players.  Getting rid of them will kill Slytherin’s chances of winning the Quidditch Cup back from Gryffindor.”
“It’s basically the same as a human ceremony,” Corelian answered.  “There are a few differences of course, the biggest being the jewelry involved.  There’s more jewelry involved then a human ceremony, but it is acceptable for those who prefer not to wear much jewelry to use concealment charms to hide it from sight.”
The gathered students all began to file out of the entry hall and began to go back to what they were doing.
“Morning, Ry, Nick.  Where are you two off to?”
“Not to mention the fact that he’s also The-Boy-Who-Refused-to-Die-Like-He-Was-Supposed-To,” Damien added.
“I know the feeling.  I remember that by the time I was almost seventeen, I was so excited about it that I couldn’t contain myself.  Mum was a little hurt because she thought I was happy that I’d be able to move out on my own soon, but that wasn’t the case, as she soon learned when I stayed on at home for another year before I finally went off to Egypt for the first time.”
"Okay, so how are we getting to Hogwarts?"
Tom arrived in the Hogwarts bell tower, so upset that he felt impervious to the chilled winds blowing around him and did not bother to cast a Warming Charm.  Suddenly, unable to breath, he dropped to his knees.  His chest felt like a stampede of elephants was running over it and the hot sting of tears burned his eyes.  He soon buried his face in his hands and allowed the waves of heartache to consume him.
for which students who had them could be acquired.
“Correct, again. Five points to Gryffindor.”
“You certainly know how to build up my curiosity,” Draco said.  “Exactly what kind of gift are you talking about?”
“Names and business?”  The welcome witch asked.
“Okay, you’re a girl!”  Draco exclaimed.
Deciding to take a chance that the previous owner was right, Harry reached over and borrowed Malfoy’s abandoned silver dagger and crushed the bean with the flat side of it.  Almost instantly, a large amount of juice came out of the bean and Harry realized that maybe it wasn’t such a bad thing that the previous owner had felt it necessary to correct Libatius Borage’s instructions.  Adding the sopophorous juice to the potion, Harry was pleased to see it immediately turn the exact shade of lilac described by the textbook.
*	*	*
Reaching for his wand, Draco waved his wand over Blaise’s abdomen and muttered the incantation for the cleaning charm that was suggested be used prior to anal intercourse in the book, ‘A Wizard’s Guide to Sex with other Wizards.’ Draco and Blaise were quite glad that they took the time to read it before their first time, because it offered many tips on what to do and want not to do that made the whole process a lot easier and less painful for both of them. Draco waved his wand again to cast a lubrication charm, before he returned his wand to the nightstand.
“I’m not that popular,” Harry said.  “A few girls did ask, but I wasn’t interested.”
The look on Draco’s face clearly said that he couldn’t believe his ears.
“Sure thing, Ry,” Harry said with a smile.
Harry knew that this would likely not include him, and shortly thereafter that suspicion was made quite clear when Dudley said, "You're not invited."
“Oh yeah,” Harry said immediately.  “There are several portraits of the past Headmasters and Headmistresses of Hogwarts.  I never counted how many exactly, but there’s a ton of them.  I’d guess about a hundred at least.”
Molly, Narcissa and Lily laughed when Cedric said that and then Molly said, “That’s part of a mother’s job description, Cedric, sorry.”
A popping noise startled both Justin and Ryan as they looked over and noticed Dobby standing at the foot of the bed.
Dumbledore nodded.  “And now?”
“What is it, mate?” Ron asked. “Who did it belong to?”
“Creevey how dare you take pictures of me in the shower!”  Draco exclaimed.  “I should hex you for that.”
“I do not suffer fools easily, madam,” Snape said, “and right now, I think you are the biggest fool I’ve ever met.”
“Narcissa told me it had something to do with the Malfoy Code of Conduct,” Bellatrix said, before moaning in pleasure.
Usually the Great Hall was not very busy for breakfast on Sunday mornings, but as it was a particularly cold November morning, most of the students were in the Great Hall, rather than grabbing some food and going outside to eat it, as many students did when it was warmer outside.
“Yes, grandmother,” Nick said.  “How did you know that?”
“So, Bill is dating Nicolas Delaney?”  Ginny asked.
“How?”  Ryan asked as he looked at the book that Hermione had just set in front of him.
“If I remember correctly, the book will write each heir’s name in a color corresponding to the founder from whom they are descended.  I believe Godric’s heirs would be written in gold ink, Salazar’s in silver ink, Helga’s in black ink, and mine in blue ink.  As the restoration charm does its work, it’s possible that the names will become clearer, though you may only be able to read first names until the full restoration period has passed.”
"Yes, well, I think under the circumstances, he should show you a little compassion."
“Mr. Filch,” Hermione said as he neared, “you can’t do anything to Justin and me for being out of bed.”
“Is this true, Dumbledore?”  Scrimgeour demanded.  “Is your Potions professor dating a student and you have done nothing to stop it?”
"I knew I'd seen you somewhere before," Ryan said. "Must have been in a Quidditch magazine. Having been born here, I still followed the British Quidditch circuit despite living in the States. I have subscriptions to a few of the British magazines and must have seen an article about your signing."
To be continued.
“You know, it’s a good thing I’m not the jealous type,” Nick said as he playfully punched Harry in the shoulder.  “Otherwise, I’d be extremely jealous of you Harry, considering that you’ve not only kissed my boyfriend on multiple occasions, but also had sex with him.”
“Godric, I cannot even begin to count the times,” Helga said, “that Rowena and I tried to get this through your thick skull in life.  Alaric’s death was an accident!  Salazar did not intend for it to happen and he felt horrible about Alaric’s death.  Then, instead of comforting him, the man you claimed to love, you turned on him and blamed him for something that was not his fault.”
“Of course,” Corelian said and he proceeded to spell his name.
"However, for the last five years you have consistently been the second best student in your year.  I might consider not being quite as angry if you were being beaten by a pureblood, but a filthy mudblood?!"
“From the Sorting Hat,” Harry answered.  “It’s mentioned several times in it’s songs that Salazar thought Hogwarts should only accept purebloods and that when the other founders refused to see his way he got mad and left the school.”
“My late grandmother dated Tom for a brief period when they were in school together,” Ryan revealed.  “So, going to school with my grandmother’s ex-boyfriend should be plenty strange.”
“So your family owns a relic of one of the founders?”  Hermione asked.
“Who are you and how do you know my name?”
Voldemort laughed cruelly and said, “I should have done this sooner.  Watching you suffer is so entertaining!”
“I’ll tell you exactly what you did, Dad,” Alaric said.  “You summoned the devil Voldemort out of the pits of the Hells to help you breed a basilisk and keep it alive until your heir found it.  The only thing you didn’t count on was that Voldemort would cast extra charms that would allow him to return, without the binding charms you placed to control him and force him to do your bidding.
“Well, no, I didn’t,” Ryan said.  “I guess I should check though.”
Among the escaped was Lucius Malfoy, who was only just recaptured a few days ago after he was arrested for using the Killing Curse on his wife, Narcissa Black Malfoy, and for using the Cruciatus Curse, on their son, Draco Malfoy.  In addition to Mr. Malfoy, fifteen other known Death Eaters were aboard the vessel and all of them are now unaccounted for.
Blaise nodded and said, “Precisely.  So, what brings you here, Potter?”
“Thank you.”
Anyway, I've realized that nervousness may have played a small part, but it certainly wasn't the reason that the kiss went as badly as it did. On Cho's part, I think she would much rather have been kissing Cedric, and I've come to realize that I would much rather have been kissing a guy. I think the whole reason I ever started going out with Cho in the first place was because somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew I was gay and I was determined not to admit it, so I managed to convince myself that I wanted Cho.
"Father, I did get Outstanding on all of my O.W.L.s," Draco whined.
Harry Potter and the Return of the Heirs
So, from now on Hogwarts Castle will actually have two Rooms of Requirement.  Rowena, Helga, and Dumbledore are the only ones who know of that development though and Dumbledore is keeping it a secret under the Fidelius.  It may seem a bit odd, but Dumbledore feels its best that it doesn’t become public knowledge because it could provide a big advantage if the war with Voldemort ever comes to Hogwarts.  It would be much easier to get all the students locked away safely in the Great Hall then to get them upstairs to the Room of Requirement, so Dumbledore didn’t want to take any chances that anyone on Voldemort’s side found out.  The students and professors will still be able to enter the Great Hall as they always could, they just won’t be able to find out that it’s a second Room of Requirement unless Dumbledore tells them and that’ll only be on a very strict need to know basis.
“Yes, Anarra, he is indeed human,” confirmed Asheera.  “That does not change the fact, however, that I think him to be pure enough of heart to deserve the rare boon of using the Tree of Life’s fruit.  Draco and his boyfriend, Aarik, are both good friends of my step-son, Kyrian.  I expect that at some point, Kyrian will decide to sponsor Draco and Aarik in taking the Atlantean marriage vows.  Not that it really matters, as the ancient scrolls make no mention of our beloved goddess saying that only Atlanteans could use the fruit that she so lovingly cultivated.”
"Come in, John," Dumbledore called out, after a moment, when the wards informed him that his guest had just reached the top of the stairs outside his office door.
“Wake up, you pathetic little wretch!” Voldemort screamed at the prone boy. When the boy didn’t move, Voldemort raised his wand and shouted, “Crucio!”
“From the Weasley twins in my third year,” Harry answered.  “My dad and his friends actually made it when they were students.”
“You would claim four human souls and return to the Land of the Living yourself?”  Valshar asked and Draco nodded.  “That shall not be an easy task, mortal.  The crypt doors do not open easily; allow me to think for a moment of an appropriate task.”
