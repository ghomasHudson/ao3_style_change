Wanda sat her doughnuts down. “I wasn’t here for all the craziness yesterday. But the morning crew says there’s no little girl in Ward Q. There’s two serious cases of flu-toxia, a comatose teen, and a little boy in forced suppression.”
For all his training, Harry didn’t have the skill for such synchronized maneuvers. But he could still think on his feet. When knocking the bludger from their monopoly seemed impossible, he shot ten meters ahead of the ball’s path and dove towards impact. This gave him an advantage of, instead of chasing the ball down or waiting for it to come to him, he met it head-on, all judging on his timing. The danger lay in a mistimed blow that could’ve sent him off his broom, or the bludger turning him into roadkill in the air. It was a stunt move, and it didn’t work. Harry was able to knock the ball out of their control, but he sent it straight into Greg’s broom, spinning the man one way and his broom another. Greg’s bat splintered into a spray of exploding wooden shards that gashed both of them with superficial cuts.
“Stop lying. You’re doing this because you need Snape, she doesn’t. Snape died in your arms and then you found out he loved you from the get go. That he treated you like shit because he couldn’t let on how much was riding on you. You want to give your fucking life to Snape, admit it. You’re chasing after a ghost that you idolize. You’re hanging all your hopes on him, with nothing to go on. Look at her, she’s awake. She’s playing, there’s no more danger now that she has the bracelet. She could live the rest of her life this way, but you still want to drag Snape into this. Well go find him. I can’t stop you and I’m tired of trying. Just admit that you’re the one who needs him, not her. Stop using her as an excuse.”
“I spied on the doctor,” Harry confessed. “I had to know what’s wrong with him.”
“I want to see it.”
“We have to face the obvious. Something is wrong. I want to suggest counseling for him. Professional therapy.”
“But can you tell what it is?”
“Those are some fancy words for a person who couldn’t even pass his auror training and had to settle for being a night guard in his father’s Muggle Artifact Department.”
James was the first to get it. “Harry, is that Draco?”
They would never forget the breech of their establishment, the magic used against them, or the deaths of their own. In their stories, Griphook was forever cheated out of his rightful treasure, the Sword of Gryffindor. His intention to claim the treasured artifact had justified his actions. No one died until Harry's friends set lose the dragon. Their own dragon was used against them, and Voldemort's bare feet tracked the blood of Goblin corpses down the length of their polished floors. All for the sake of capturing the great Harry Potter.
He hung around the city, bought a beer and dinner from one of the mobile vendors, and strolled alongside the river, watching fireworks reflect in the water. It felt so good, he recognized a certain eagerness building in his stomach. Couples holding hands, passing him by, told him what was missing, what he was really looking for. Companionship. When you felt this alive, you wanted to share it. You wanted to shake someone and say, ‘Do you see this too?’ Who else could he tell about this dimension within a dimension?
“I know, it’s a necessary thing for some, but not for you. I know you’re not cruel, or Harry wouldn’t have anything to do with you. You think you’re protecting this child by not letting it come into your lives. You think things are so ruined and messy that all you can realistically do, is salvage what you’ve got. You think you don’t have enough energy for a second child, and that you’re barely hanging on with Iece, and in the face of so much against you. The kindest thing you can think of, is letting it go back to the source of love that it came from, instead of trying to survive in your terribly damaged world.
Harry sends Draco a half-hearted glare before he glances at his scaly companion, still at odds with himself. The words are at the tip of his tongue, a sound and a slur of a hiss waiting to be released. He knows that if he engages, half the battle will be lost. He feels Draco’s amused gaze on him, and he curses inwardly.
Harry almost smiles at the return of the familiar, sarcastic tone. “You wanted the truth.”
“Draco...” Harry started.
“I think you upset Artemis.”
There’s a sound of shattering glass but Harry can’t bring himself to care. Draco’s lips are soft, smooth velvet brushing against his own. He traces over the slope of it’s cupid’s bow with the tip of his tongue, before catching Draco’s upper lip in between his teeth. Draco’s mouth is hesitant against his but they open as Harry licks into it. The ever-present tightness in Harry’s chest uncoils as he sighs into the kiss.
“Her,” Draco corrects. “And of course it does; she’s our guest.”
Eyelids closing, he imagines how the press of Draco’s thumb against his lip would feel like if instead it brushes against his slit, probing, teasing. He groans as his thumb dips into it, and he jerks into his circle of fingers wishing that it was
Harry’s hands slide down the taut line of Draco’s back. “Not denying that.” His hands trace the slope of Draco’s hip and goes further, reaching the firm curve of his arse. They fill Harry’s hands perfectly and he squeezes, feeling the muscles jump and contract underneath his touch.
“Of course, I’m torn up about my husband. But as long as I’m stuck here, I might as well make the best of it.” She gave Lily a conspiring look and pulled her along to find the others.
The Lucius thing checked his watch. “It’s time for your punishment, Draco. Let’s get it over with.”
He tried to never show the audience things that were too terrible for anyone to see. Things that he was still recovering from, himself. It was Draco's idea to create an interactive book that would let anyone access appropriate information in the form of his memories.
Lily didn’t bother to correct her on her facts. The award was nothing close to the Nobel Prize, but it was a high honor. To the naked eye, her accepting nature was unruffled by Emerald’s excitement. To the more perceptive observers, like Petunia and Gamy, who stayed busy between the dining table and the kitchen, her gears were turning. They had all learned early on that a child like Emmy had to be kept busy.
Harry stood. “What the hell’s that supposed to mean?”
Arthur backed her up. “That’s right. You’re the one we’re hanging around for now. Couldn’t leave till we’ve had a hug. And a promise you’ll bring Draco and the little one by more often.”
Only Harry was falling in love. Right there on the spot, in front of everyone.
That's when he knew the Settlement was finally opening its secrets to him. He could either run, like any sane person. Or, he could stay and try to pass whatever initiation this was. He had come to Ireland after his failed second marriage, because it seemed like the last magical place on Earth. He'd just lost his home and his kids, and he needed healing isolation. He figured the loneliness would either kill him or force him to wake up from a lifetime of trying to make others happy. It simply could not be done. People were so immovably who they were. If full-grown adults had no idea how to live in happiness, what the hell made him think he could promise that to another? People didn't even know what it was. They only knew fleeting moments, and those didn't count. And don't get him started on the whole mythology of love. That was just another misunderstanding people got wrong on a daily basis.
Sirius swallowed bitterly. “What do you think we should do for her?”
That put a damper on his intentions, but it gave him time to down three beers faster than he could talk himself out of it. Greg and Jasper apparated in the parking lot where he agreed to meet them. All jeans, sporty nylon and leather jackets, and puffing like smoke stacks on gourmet cigarettes, they looked nothing like the professional quidditch players sponsored by an international agency of peace. They looked like young men on the hunt for trouble, and anyone who looked at them the wrong way was fair game.
"All thirty-one survived. They still don't know who attacked the train."
She'd told Ron and Draco afterwards, "He totally saw Harry in my mind. I couldn't stop him. But at the same time, I felt his alarm. I felt that he cared. It wasn't a lie, and I had to trust him."
The next words out of Harry's mouth never made it.
Lights were ambient and the crowd deceptively thin. He had enough experience to know that the manager ushered her customers from the lounge as quickly as possible, and that the rooms upstairs must’ve been bursting with festival spillover. Pretty girls working the bar were new to him, but the strawberry blonde pouring over calculations in her ledger, greeted him like an old friend. She was a classic, right down to letting just enough grey tell her age while she batted super black, false eyelashes at him and bit down on her cigarette holder. She held it between her teeth and asked him what he was in the mood for. Ash knew those things had gone out of fashion before she was born, but she was nothing if not retro, and wore the 60’s matte lipstick and hive to prove it. She’d told him once, she was all about giving people their fantasies, and she made a great living at it.
“Yes. He’s quite a different sort when you’re not around. Warmer. More human.”
“Did you two get any rest?” James directed his question at Harry, while studying Draco’s reaction. After it was out, he cringed at what it might’ve implied. Lily jumped at the chance to disregard it.
To his surprise, Foster stopped a foot away, stricken. “Congratulations. You have succeeded in astonishing me beyond my capacity to comprehend such face-saving arrogance. You would command the power to reach beyond the veil of life and death, and yet your only objective would be to disturb my sleep with your bothersome, spectral longing. I’m flattered, but your lack of ambition is the real tragedy in that scenario.”
Harry winced, and laughed in spite of himself. "I don't see it, but thanks for trying."
“Oooh. Tough break.” Sirius slapped his back. “Guess a lioness will do anything for her cub.”
Sirius, who was standing outside the room with James, yelled, “That dragon’s gone ape-shit. We’re in till that kid wakes up and sorts this out. It’s like some bloody curse. You check for that?”
His father, Lucius, had the same color hair, and it didn’t make Harry feel good. It made him feel unsafe. That a completely different mind could mimic the quality of something he loved, and not be the thing he loved. Sure, he hadn’t gotten along with Draco in the beginning. It takes time to get used to constantly being confronted with something you haven’t yet learned is vital to you, and that’s why it gets under your skin. You aren't sure that it's really yours and that you can have it. That’s why you can’t stop staring at it. That’s why you stalk it.
“And I’m going to be here for you.” He realized he was reassuring himself that he was going to come back home from whatever trouble he’d face once he went after Snape, because he had this to come back home to. She and Draco were his touchstone, his home beacon.
He's hardly caught his breath when he sees the orange glow. Out the window, a number of cars down, beautiful red-amber light obliterated all visibility. In its flash, tracks sprung into the air like broken pieces of noodles. Whole cars lifted and went their separate ways.
“I’m a male wizard. Just because it’s possible, doesn’t mean I should do it. I’m not a nurturer and the idea disgusts me. You try having a kid through all that emotional garbage. It’s not fair to the kid or to me. But it’s what they want, and my body is programmed to do it.”
“You’re tormented by the crimes against your body. It’s understandable. But as old as I am, with everything I’ve seen and done, to me, that’s like listening to a muggle lady wail over a stain on her gown. Her life is shattered over a flaw. She won’t fit in with all the other elites anymore. Oh dear. Ask Thella about fitting in, and how precious that ability is to wizards and muggles alike. She ruined her chances in the womb, and still has found the source of all peace. Stop relying on what others think of you. They don’t know what you’ve come to do. They don’t know your work.”
“Trying to feed you dinner?” Draco answers, as he slides into his seat. “Well, yes, that is quite obvious.”
He knows there’s no getting around Draco when he looks at him like this. They’re both stubborn to a fault, and this could go on for the entire night if they let it. Harry’s certain Draco wouldn’t appreciate that, and Harry’s coming to terms that Draco’s right even if Harry doesn’t really want to admit it. This isn’t something they should talk about in the middle of a dim corridor with alcohol strumming through their veins, making everything blurry and shaky.
Harry’s reaches for Draco’s hand anyway. His fingers are cold when they wrap around Harry’s, and when Draco shuffles closer, Harry doesn’t even bother hiding his shit-eating grin.
Harry blinks and tries to refocus. He shrugs.
He thinks the crash is inevitable anyway.
Draco casts him an impassive look. “You named our fish, Poseidon.”
“Normal people wouldn’t find either situation distressing,” Harry answers.
Different, but oh so similar.
Draco groans. "Kindly shut the fuck up, Potter."
“Shut up.”
the mess away) that Harry’s realized how Draco’s grown quiet. Harry has also realized that in the process of grooming Draco’s hair, he’s managed to shuffle closer and now, he finds that he can’t move away. Can’t or doesn’t want to, he hasn’t decided yet.
Because Draco making curry means that Harry’s probably (most likely) going to have to reason with him. And that he’s probably going to lose, if he’s being completely honest. Still, he’s not giving in without a fight. He’s already part-exasperated and part-curious as he makes his way across the sitting room.
“So what if he is hiding?” Neville pipes up.
“Yes, Harry,” Draco answers, just a bit petulant, and finally turns around to look at him. “I brought home a big great deadly snake just for the thrill of having to brew multiple anti-venom potions because I’ve nothing else to do all day.”
“It’s Friday,” Harry states, not really answering his question.
“I know what you’re going to say, but can we at least have dinner first?”
and Harry’s eyes fly open in surprise as he’s pushed down on the bed and Draco’s mouth crashes against his.
He tries not to cringe. There was something with the way that Poppy has said his name that had Harry feeling as though he is still a student, with no business getting injured or sick or getting partly transfigured into a squid.
There’s a soft sigh against his mouth as they break for a needed breath, and Harry chases Draco’s lips with a displeased grunt.
—and he really should know better than to walk around with his eyes closed in this household.
mess.
Of course, thinking about their trip to the Infirmary only triggered Harry’s thoughts to wander down dangerous paths. He could still feel the ghost of Draco’s warm hand on his waist, and the lean arm against his back, and he could still smell the scent of cinnamon and coffee that clung to his side, that was so distinctly
“Do you want to…?”
Draco can’t even reach for the energy to dispute that. It’s true after all.
“I’m serious,” Harry says, and Draco can practically hear the worried frown on his face. “Are you alright?”
tease right now. It’s not very endearing.”
“What’s my staircase ever done to you?” Harry grumbles and offers not much else in the way of argument. He’s grown almost fond of his moody staircase, even if it still tries to break his neck with a vanishing step from time to time. It’s a complicated, love-hate relationship.
Harry chokes on his curry, feeling his own face warm up, and before he can stop himself, the reply spews from his mouth in an intricate curl of sounds, like a slither of cool scales on his tongue:
“Still hiding?”
“I seriously hope that you’re not confusing me for Ron, Lav.”
“Can’t say it’s much of an improvement,” Draco mutters beside him, “But it’ll do.”
“I only want to talk.” Harry reasons.
dish, but it’s one of the few things he’s now comfortable with cooking. Once Draco got the correct proportion of spices down, he  immediately claimed the dish as his own. Even if it was Harry’s recipe to begin with. Not that Harry minded—he was too busy being pleased and insanely proud and stuffed with spoonfuls of spicy goodness.
His other hand slides down from his stomach, down the curve of his hip, past his groin, and reaches further down to play with his bollocks. He rolls one along his palm, gives it a light tug before he releases it, copies the same motions to the other, and makes sparks of pleasure zip up his spine.
“I do enjoy shutting you up.”
of said toy sounds from somewhere in the other room, and the pretty pink colour that blooms on Draco’s cheeks renders his rather impressive scowl ineffective. “It was perfectly reasonably priced, Potter!”
"You're exaggerating,"
Draco hears the sound of the stove coming to life, and the sound of slicing and liquid flowing only serves to heighten his curiosity. “You know,” Harry says, conversationally, as if they aren’t a room apart. “They say that Healers are the worst patients.”
Harry is thankful that his bitten-down nails are not long enough to sting where they are currently digging into his arms. “Will you shred the roots tonight?”
Harry’s fingers slide from his temple down to the sides of his neck, and stretches along Draco’s shoulders, pushing and loosening knots that Draco doesn’t even know he has. Harry’s thumbs circle just below his nape and presses just
See, if he had stayed at home then he would not be in this mess in the first place. If he had stayed at home, then he would not have had to spend the remainder of the holidays in such close proximity with Draco and he would not have had to deal with all of these unfortunate circumstances.
“Can you imagine them shrieking while gyrating their hips?” Lavender wonders, picking at the foil of her half-eaten chocolate. “I don’t know if I find that more odd or arousing.”
how a bludger to head feels like. Maybe he should ask Harry.
Harry pulled the hand closer and felt a warm glow when Draco leaned slightly on his arm.
Harry whipped around at the sound of dragging footsteps, only to be greeted by an old, graying house elf. Kreacher bowed deeply, nose almost touching the floor, “Welcome, master.”
Considering how much Draco’s been to Harry’s own quarters, Harry can’t help but find it curious how he’s only ever been inside Draco’s room less than a handful of times before, and only to deposit Draco into his bed after he’s gone and gotten himself pissed as fuck. It’s never left him with much time to survey the interior but now that he’s given free reign to snoop around, he finds that he can’t focus on anything else but Draco.
No one had to ask any questions. The groundhogs knew who Draco’s choice would be. And no matter what ancient groans reverberated through the house, the only sound Lucius heard coming, was Harry and Draco.
“In essence, you’re going to create a dream that we can all see. But it will seem quite real to you. On the level of symbols, it will be real and have distinct effects. I will send you in, to help you create a dialogue with your committee, and therefore the contract itself. Stand here. Harry, behind him. I’m going to show you a series of lights. They’re actually more than that, but everyone here will see them as lights. You will look into each one and tell your community what you see.”
Sirius grinned, taking the criticism like a compliment. “Your orgasms hurt? I think I just heard the wolf call you a wimp. Yeah, I’m sure they hurt to a prim, understated, soft-spoken professor, like yourself. You’re always so reserved, ‘cause you’re protecting everyone from the wolf. But if you ran your body’s magic wide open more often you’d be more comfortable letting it shoot out of you. No apologies. That’s how I want to see you.”
In spite of his promises to lead them to Harry, Collin was not particularly valuable to them, but a show was made of the exchange. Once the vials were tested on captive subjects and deemed acceptable, Collin was left, wand broken, wrists tied, mouth gagged, and eyes bulging at Snape and the audacity of the group to drive away in their black Mercedes, leaving them alone in the tunnel.
That blond little bully has grown up to be such a willowy, pristine trophy husband. The distance he put between himself and those less "pure" has only made him soft and vulnerable against them. Harry becomes his "muscle" in many ways. But he isn't weak. When tested, he will strike and he's always got Harry's back. He becomes Harry's reward and triumph over all things pureblooded.
They would be all right.
Before Harry can think too much of pink-tinged cheeks and red-tipped ears, there's a clatter and a
With everything back in their proper place, Harry follows Draco to the other end of the room and pauses just in front of the door to his quarters. Draco looks back at him when he notices that he doesn’t follow. “Are you just going to stand there?”
“Are you?”
The staircases are kind to them, and even Harry’s temperamental one seems to have grasped that neither of them are in a playful mood, nor in the correct headspace to avoid vanishing steps or broken appendages.
Harry ignores how Draco’s gaze burns on the side of his face, focuses on the way the snake lifts her head and points her pink-red eyes at Harry curiously.
Harry takes a bite of his curry and almost moans in delight. The first bite is always a blast of flavour—the way the strong spices sit on his tongue, the pleasant sting of it lining a way down his throat. He knows that Draco likes having it spicier than Harry can handle—an explosion rather than a tentative tickle on his taste buds—but he’s always mindful and considerate of the amount and mixture of his spices, and the way Harry warms up has more to do with that fact than with the second or third spoonful of his scrumptious dinner.
He tucks a strand of hair behind Draco’s ear. “Then we should probably head back.”
-Malfoy-induced-turmoil warring with his good sense. If there is any good sense left in him at all, actually.
When they arrive, they are welcomed by the sight of Neville lounging on the massive bean bag just a little ways off the side of the fireplace. He’s munching on some crisps, and Lavender is already nursing a glass of Firewhisky on her designated spot on the plush rug. They insist that Harry and Draco take the couch as they always do and they insist that Harry and Draco are not late.
“There’s nothing wrong with my sweater,” Harry said, slightly indignant.
“Sure, sure.”
“No, that thing that you call a sweater is not perfectly fine and yes, you need this,” Draco said, eyebrow raised.
But then he looks at Harry and though his tone is all wry amusement and maybe disgust at the little, squiggly bundles on Harry’s head that makes him look like the evil sea witch, Harry thinks that he sees a flash of concern as grey eyes take him in from head to toe.
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Having been true to his word, Harry’s made good use of most of their morning in Draco’s room, and he’s now so well acquainted with Draco’s body that he thinks he can navigate it with eyes closed. Of course, such a meticulous task has made him and Draco miss breakfast, and Draco, who has a brewing Wolfsbane in his workroom, refused to leave to make up for lost time and worked well over lunch.
Harry gulps. He feels the heavy weight of Draco’s stare, making all his blood pool south.
Harry clears his throat. “I said, I was wondering the same thing.”
Harry lifted their entwined fingers and put a soft kiss on the back of Draco’s hand. “Thank you.”
“Must you?” Juicy fluids leak out while she cuts up her bloody steak and Harry watches with little fascination.
“Really, it’s not your fault that you find my leg, well, any part of me really, irresistible,” Draco smirks with a quick shrug of his shoulder.
need to smile more.
“I still say he’s gotten tangled up in his brewing again.” A small green tendril of plant life dangles precariously from the hair on Neville’s temple as he turns to face them. Harry wonders if all Herbology professors always have some sort of greenery dangling from their hair. “You know he usually passes by the greenhouses to collect the roots himself, but I got an owl this morning asking for some.”
. He gives himself a light squeeze and with his free hand he Summons the bottle of lube in his bedside table drawer, and tips a generous amount over the reddened head of his cock.
Harry snorts, eyebrows raised. “Sure it was.” Something smooth and soft brushes against Harry’s leg, and he spies Artemis’ white coat as she settles near the foot of Draco’s chair, curling contentedly by his side.
Harry blinked, startled at the abrupt change of tone. “Er, Draco?”
“What—?” Draco pulls away from the kiss and looks at the scene with an air of fond exasperation. “Oh for the love of—Artemis, Apollo, behave.”
Harry pushes off from the greenhouse door and moves closer. “To be honest, I wasn’t sure either.”
Draco catches where Harry’s looked and his eyes widen in comprehension.
Neville clears his throat, and the look he’s giving Harry is both kind and uncertain, if not a little amused. “If you’re suddenly the kissy kind of drunk, Harry, please, er, don’t.”
He knows what’s happened, of course. Knows it by the way his chest seems tighter, by the way his arms and legs are stiffer, by the way his vision is still a bit blurry even with his glasses on, by the way his body is giving little shivers that echo the earlier trembling that shook him from the tiny corners of his mind to the little nerves of his toes.
He felt Draco’s hands came up to cover his, and Harry allows himself to support Draco’s weight as he leans back against Harry’ chest. “Well, that’s a horribly pleasant thought,” Draco said.
Harry retorts, “She’s a bloody snake; she can’t even understand what we’re saying.”
Harry wants them to know. Wants them to see the brightness and brilliance and warmth he sees in Draco’s eyes even when they’re in the cover of shadows and night. Wants them to see that Draco glows brighter than the moon, twinkles brighter than the stars, shines brighter than the sun. For Harry. Because of Harry. Because of them,
He watched as Draco closed his eyes, and he saw how the stiff set of his shoulders melted away, how the blank, detached expression crumbled into a sorrow so deep that it pained Harry to look further. Suddenly, there were no words that could be said. Harry held out his hand in silent offering.
Draco shrugs, not even bothering to deny the accusation, the infuriating man. He scoops a good amount of the spicy dish onto Harry’s plate, and the scent of paprika and roux circles up in a current of rich flavour into Harry’s nose—fabricates a sharp burst of flavour on his tongue. “You like curry,” Draco states. “Are you complaining?”
Even as he came to that conclusion, he saw Harry taking off for Hogwarts as soon as they had that discussion. It would be permission for him to leave again. No strings. No attachments, because Draco was so good at taking care of Iece. And now there was Jipsy to help. Why should he hang around to raise his daughter? A kid he never wanted to begin with. It should fall to Draco. Most of the time, he was glad that it did. Only… only he could feel resentment growing in the bottom of his stomach, like a cancer, and wondered briefly if that was how such things started. That was a muggle disease and he had nothing to worry about. Only a few short weeks ago, he’d been pushing Harry out the door. Away from him. Now the thought of him traipsing off after other interests, had him confused at his own conflicting thoughts.
"Know you from where?"
Harry choked back the urge to turn her trait into a commentary on Malfoy greed, and spooned the sherbet into the glasses.
He took a moment to catch his breath. He made them think he was going to stand there and tell them everything. He made it look really hard to confess his screw up to them. But all of that was a distraction. It gave him the determination he needed to plot his get away and set his speed, just as Draco had done. Sirius and Remus blocked the door. He left them stumbling from the force of his impact, and everyone else gaping at him, when he shot through them to get downstairs. He willed his magic to give him what it took to get outside and find Draco.
“It’s as if this bloke has been ingesting needle-tip amounts of the world’s worst venom for decades. His blood is like fortified armor. We think we can save lives with it. We’re going to contact the authorities and make sure the criminal charges following this guy, redirects his arrest to one of our facilities. If we need you to identify him, can we count on that?”
“That’s not very lady-like.”
Jipsy looked troubled for a moment, then admitted, “Not death. Not then. Removed from the family.”
“You two, stop it!” His mother sounded like she’d had enough. “It’s not helping him.”
“But what made you change your mind? You always said you’d never let them marry you to anyone. You didn’t believe in it.”
Collin interpreted his lowered eyes as a lapse in vigilance. A softening of hope. He proceeded to wedge his foot in the door. “You were Voldemort’s closest confidant. I daresay, closer than Nagini.”
Through the layers of her bio-energies, she was having a storm of imbalances, but her magic was also learning as it dodged it’s own firestorm. Harry’s magic had shown a similar pattern when layers were peeled back to expose the circuitry that connected him to his wheels of life. Because of their genetic symbiosis, she was actually bearing some of his trauma, his panic, and helping him to dissipate it. A child that young had no business processing that kind of thick, dense energy. But her conscious mind was so light and empty of suffering, that she was too naive to fear it the way an adult would fear it.
Lucius took insult with Harry’s speculation. “That is absurd. My son has never engaged in any act that would necessitate such crass methods. And if he had, no muggle contraception is going to interfere with his magic.”
He was so thankful for the moment, the chance to speak his heart, that he lost all connection with Harry and Emerald. Beside him, Harry leaned in. “Draco, we need your dragon now. Call him.”
Harry shook it, robotically. He looked for his dad, who stood out in the hall. James let the door behind him, to Harry’s bedroom, hold him up. He propped there, arms folded, and winked at him.
Offense had Harry’s lips tightening and his hands shaking. Malfoy was a wizard. He must’ve known that Harry was also, for a while now. Harry swallowed, not sure what to do with his rage, and too stunned to take his eyes off the moving photo. A note fell out with it.
She hid her hurt feelings and smiled at him bravely. She was used to people underestimating her tastes. Some of those artists had excellent voices and their songs were really beautiful. Give her time. She conquered Harry, she’d conquer him.
The crime that Draco described, had Harry imagining the worst. This is where Draco’s voice dropped, as if he’d suddenly missed a step. All confidence gone. Harry had to strain his hearing, pressing the cartilage of his ear as flat as it would go against the door.
Lucius smiled, opening his eyes to sunlight encroaching into his study. He admitted who he had to thank for this influx of renewed vitality. That insane, reptilian control freak who'd cost him everything, but left him a daughter and maybe even a little more.
What if Snape were still alive? What would it really mean for all of them if Harry found him and brought him back? It would mean having to deal with all those bitter secrets that had pushed Harry, abusively, out of every room and every encounter, to prove a point. To prove how much Snape supposedly didn’t give a damn about him. Even if they survived the trial, Draco didn’t know if he could handle having that vaporous toxic cloud in his home, around his baby sister. And most of all, he didn’t think he could stomach watching Harry continue to chase after Snape’s approval. He’d always admired Snape’s courage among the ranks of the Death Eaters, and total self-control that came with his methodical silence. But he wanted the past to stay in the past, and Harry wanted to bring it home.
He kept his head down and willed himself not to throw up.
“I taught you better than that, Draco. Don’t let your emotions get the best of you. If I were evil, wouldn’t I have done this already? No, I’m nothing so predictable and common. I’m giving him a chance to make the most intelligent move he can make. The situation is unfortunate, but we do not grieve over what we can’t change. You have my offer. Persuade him to take it. If not, we will leave the world of courts and documents, and laws behind. You know what I did to bargain for your life. I will do as much for this child, and Harry will not like it. My rights are written in her blood, which comes from me, and Harry is bound to that as well. Let’s make an effort to play nice, shall we?”
“Enter in peace, Master of this ring. You entrusted it to me. It became more than I ever paid for it. The light inside belongs to you. It answers to you. Hear me now, and follow my call. I need you, friend. That is all.”
He gave them time to notice him, but kept clear of their splashing contest. When their looks clearly expected him to join in, he made it a point to not crack a smile and held to the firm indication that they were having fun all wrong. Pretending he wanted nothing to do with the spectacle before him, he turned his back on them and headed back through the doors. Harry saw through the act, and sent a splash arching over the side of the pool at him. It was borne on magic, and reached him at a volume that smacked him forward, drenching his whole body from behind.
They clung to each other a while longer before a giant shadow eclipsed their sunlight. Draco groaned, knowing what it was. Harry looked up at the creature, remembering how its size and scarred underbelly, never got old. At ground level, its thick scales resembled alligator hide more than they did plates. Its hide got thicker and more colorful as it went up. Looking the dragon in its snout, was a bit disconcerting, because if it caught you, it would lean its long neck down to peer back at you, as if to say, ‘How do you like being stared at?’
**Present Day**
It took sitting there, waking up slowly to the play of light and gentle breezes, to help him acclimate to the field around him. Wild flowers and birds casting shadows between him and the sun, accentuated that this was a place of peace. Of truce. Try as he might, he couldn’t remember how he got here. Feelings of the most delicious warmth, of kissing, and sensual contact, were pulled from his grip, and wafted like scented memories that he couldn’t place. Then he spotted the person hiding in the grass. Not hiding, but hidden. His white hair gave him away.
"Hopefully, we can let you get on with your plans. You'll be briefed on arrangements concerning necessary surveillance, but you're free to carry on with the tour."
"They are. All thirty-one show rapid tissue growth and traces of complex magic, though Harry's treatment is the most complete. It's as if the rest were treated in haste. The most life-threatening injuries were tended to, but secondary wounds were left alone. I don't want to underestimate the locals, but there's no registered wizard on record, within a hundred kilometers of the crash site, qualified to administer such treatment. On the other hand, the area is quite rural and cut off. Villagers are reputed to be self-reliant and very good at minding their own business. That usually means they still have ties to an old network of Pre-Christian Paganism. A skilled witch or wizard could make themselves useful among them."
As soon as Lily’s hand went away, she blurted, “Draco! That’s such a cool name. I can’t wait to meet him. I bet he’s awesome. Is his hair really that white? It looks so pretty. Harry is so lucky. He gets to brush it. I wonder if he’ll teach me to play piano. The paper said he’s nominated for the Magical Registry of World Contributions, for teaching people to play instruments faster than anybody. That’s like the Nobel Prize in the wizard world. I’ve always wanted to learn piano. Do you think he’ll play for us? Gamy’s upright is still in the basement and we haven’t had a party here in a long time.”
“I don’t like what you’re implying.”
“You’ll have to wait your turn.”
He played for his new family. Classics and modern Kpop that only Emerald truly appreciated. She pulled Dudley onto the dance floor and showed him moves that had him cringing, but his laughter infected everyone around them. She looked like a sixteen year old girl again. It was anyone’s guess when that would change.
He thought this was the pinnacle of his acceptance, of being the better wizard that Draco wasn’t expecting. But the next instance had him shuddering with regret.
Harry’s kiss has lasting effects.
“Because she’s sick,” Draco yelled at him. “Or didn’t you see how unstable all that effort to hide her appearance made her? I can’t believe I let you people do this to her.”
“It’s true,” he told her. “This guy scared the shit out me since I was eleven, then he ends up sacrificing everything to save my life. I can’t get over it. I can’t let him go. Now, I’m meeting his mother. I’m meeting him. It’s like I get to travel back in time, before I was even born, just to have this meeting. So weird and so amazing at the same time. I can’t thank you enough, Jipsy. I have to get a copy of this. And now I have to find out how exactly am I related to Snape?”
“Arthur and I value family more than anything else. My offer was simply an option. Yes, it’d be difficult, but nothing we can’t handle. If you let your little ones come to live with us, they’d be ours. They’d have four parents, not two. We could never do this half-way, just because she isn’t blood. All children require commitment. I would kill for your child the same as I would kill for my own, if anyone gave me a reason to. Yes, I’m still angry about Fred, but I don’t put the blame on you or your parents. There’s only one person who ordered that attack on a school full of children, and it wasn’t any of you. So put that out of your head right now. If me taking her upsets you so much, then give yourself more time to think about what you’re doing, before it can’t be undone. Give yourself more time and don’t make such a rash, irreversible decision based on fear. Nothing done out of fear ever works out. Ever.”
She palmed it and walked up to him. “I’m going to put all my faith in you, in a way that you won’t put in me. I’m doing this, and I’m gambling everything on your love and your forgiveness. Yes, he had a crush on me, even after we were married. But we were all teenagers and he was just beginning to realize that I was the wrong gender. He put me on a pedestal, so what. He left me there, for his books and his mastery. You’re the one I chose. You’re the one I’m going to curl up next to tonight. You’re the one whose son I carried. You won. Stop reliving the past. He’s a good man and a great wizard. But you’re far more. You’re the one I want. Trust that, and let me get these boys some help.”
“You’ve talked to Mrs. Weasley?”
“You’ve gone too far.” He braced himself over the table, staring at the white splotches in his hands that hinted of strained circulation. “What goes on between me and Harry isn’t any of your business.”
Harry clamped his mouth shut, lest words that were meant for Lucius come out. When Draco got through explaining the system and incantation, it was ingenious.
“I don’t know,” Lucius admitted. “These are not, perhaps, murderous, evil spirits we’re dealing with. They were approached in love and respect. They gave in that same vein. It’s not as if they deposited the perfect child into our home. They simply cleared away the medical issues preventing my wife from carrying to term. I don’t think the ghost mafia will be turning up to break our knee caps just because Draco can’t pay the exorbitant price I promised, any time soon.”
He looked up at Natasha. “Yes. I want him. Get me Kevan, your best guy.”
Jipsy’s eyes were sad and luminous. Harry knew what was coming. Her head went from side to side, as if she’d told him a dozen times. “The wards will not let me speak the names that you need. That doesn’t mean you can’t find them. And they have nothing to do with the Malfoys. Do not fear Lucius or his crimes. The magic in you conquered things like that long ago. Your daughter will help you let it go.”
“Not to worry, sir. She came to teach you.” She pointed at him. “Her magic is more like yours, than the one you fear. Her troubles are because her magic is good, not because it’s bad. It won’t take his pattern.”
Harry's public appearances had been aided by oversized jackets and the fact his male skeletal structure did not push his stomach out like a woman's. Male pelvises tilted back, allowing their abdomens to remain inconspicuous. His stomach remained mostly flat, which wasn't good for him or the child, who did not have enough room to grow without putting too much pressure and strain on Harry's heart and lungs. Professor Snape's last examination predicted she'd be premature and he instructed them where to go when the time came. He'd blasted Draco with a burst of severe and specific instructions on what to do immediately after she was born, as if he'd known it would fall to Draco to keep them safe. He'd certainly known that he wouldn't be there to help.
Lucius raised an eyebrow and looked incredulous at her. “Harry Potter was here? And nothing stopped him?”
“Snobs can’t believe that a pristine pureblood would actually commit to a sweaty jock, let alone a working boy. The working classes are impressed with Draco’s tastes. Everyone’s trying to dig up a reason for the match, as if simply being a young, attractive couple wasn’t enough. They’re going to focus on Harry’s magic. By nightfall, they’ll have done some research. Best to tell Harry not to talk to anyone, no matter how polite they seem. That’s how they sneak information out of you,” she pointed out.
Note:  I’m back! Thank you all for being patient with me. After writing non-stop for two years, I needed to rest. I can’t wait to give you more of this story. If all goes well, there will be a total of three updates today, including this one. :-)
“Shush, James. If we’re going to get past that dragon, we’ll need all the help we can get.”
"He has a big heart."
Portrait Snape held his stance.
Harry watched, horrified, as those creatures lifted Draco’s body and tossed him deeper into their fold. He had no wand. He had magic, but no idea how to use it against them. Draco’s scream disappeared into the throng of muscular fur and teeth. Harry saw his shirt leave his body, and the last of his skin fade from sight.
Foster's mouth went hard, then dour. "You can't." He began unbuttoning and removing his outermost shirt. "He needs my marrow."
“I’ve got all night.”
He dismissed it, but kept glancing at Draco’s lips. What if the dragon was pissed about the marriage for a different reason? There’s no telling what was in that contract. Lucius had specified a Consummation of Marriage. What if the dragon was waiting on them to honor their contractual duties, to make it real? What if everyone in this house was being held waiting, simply because they hadn’t taken that age-old step?
This should’ve released him from his prison, but it didn’t.
“I’ll just keep bossing you. When you tell me to fuck off, I’ll know you’re ready to hear what I have to say.”
It wasn’t even sex. Not really. What if he just wanted to sink into someone’s arms? If he had to put out, he’d make himself do it.
“Let me say it a different way. If I sign, my son’s virtue will be lost. It’s not about some superstitious Victorian etiquette. It’s about magical property. His body, his latent womb, has the ability to produce magic of the highest order, and none of us are getting any younger. He doesn’t have all the time in the world. The females of his mother’s line burn their magic hottest and brightest during their most fertile years. I would not have him dallying through the next five years, filled with romance, and not one child. He doesn’t have a lifetime to take chances. Biologically, the next ten years are not guaranteed to him. This is the reason why we only have one child, and have had to invest our every hope in him. And judging by your household, you’re no great producer of heirs, which causes me to think we should err on the side of caution where mating is concerned. Hence, Certainty of Consummation.”
“I’m not talking of estate affairs or finances. That’s business. This is family, and every time I attempt meaningful conversation with you, you put me in my place.” Her tone did not match the humility of her choice of words.
James couldn’t take another second. “Okay, that’s enough. We get it.”
“I’m not ready!”

Avi was right, but the blow to Harry's pride kept him reeling far beyond Avi's reach.
. He’d seen it before, but never so pronounced and dramatic.
Sometimes actors use subtext. David Thewlis knew what the hell he was doing. This is a sexual leer and no one can tell me any differently. It is David’s own joke, and completely out of the context of the moment. I’d look at Sev like that too. :-)Thanks, David!
“I know,” he admitted. He almost added, “but we have Jipsy.” Instead, he yielded. “Give us a few hours. Rest yourselves. We might need you…”
Draco was shaking. He looked down at the gown in his hands. “I want this.”
“But if she has anymore trouble, contact me right away. Her magic seems to be behaving itself for now. It’ll take at least a week of medication before she’s at levels that suppress it effectively enough. If she does well for a month, we’ll pull back gradually. The bracelet’s been scanned for its magical properties, but we’re still analyzing it. I’ve got her prescription worked out for a trial period, and that will keep the severest episodes away, but I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do about her body at the moment. I’m still trying to wrap my head around it. Keep an eye on her, make any notes of interest and report concerns to me, but other than that, she can rest and recover at home as long as her magic is no longer spontaneously active. I’m going to pop in on her and scan her myself over the next few weeks. You guys can schedule that with the nurse.”
Score. Me, Ash thought.
He saw Snape’s expression darken, and quickly corrected the assumption. “No, not what you think. It took a male of her own kind to do it. Backaals don’t have one specific mate for life. Why would they, since they live virtually forever? She was only able to accomplish this because she replicated human DNA and wore a body. She had to mate with her own kind, which are inherently neither gender until they acquire a body. But in the past, the body was just cosmetics, not really needed in order for them to function. Once she got a taste of Harry’s magic, her cosmetic body began to function biologically. It could make and carry a child because that’s what she wanted the magic to do.
The question wasn’t soft or reassuring. It was simply presented.
The idea of having restraining spells used against him, kept Harry calm. He had to keep his head. But he wanted them to know he hadn’t meant to trigger that kind of evidence, much less show it to a crowd of innocent people.
Harry accepted the handshake offered to him.
“Watch your language. Your disrespect will not be tolerated. What’s happened? This isn’t like you. What’s changed?”
“I haven’t heard any glass break, so I’m pretty sure you haven’t gone through the window.”
“Look, I love women. I just… there’s someone I been wanting to ask out, and I want to be sure it’s what I want.”
One tries not to hear.
, she seemed to speak into his mind.
More often than not, Harry got to brag that women were still appealing to him, and that he had the ability to perform on command. That world of adult women actually hitting on him, was entirely new and pretty amazing, even if his stomach soured at the thought of them using him as a trophy. To the seventeen year-old, pre-war version of him, it was cool as fuck and he wasn't going to miss out on it just because some reptile decided to shit on his whole life. Every time he tried it with a woman, he was telling Voldemort, and all the Death Eaters, to go fuck themselves. That was fun at first.
Passing from the dining room to the kitchen, he caught sight of the television. Reuse sat with her back to him, her skirted legs hanging off slightly. She must've felt his presence. She turned, her thin hand covering her mouth. "Isn't it awful? They don't expect to find all the bodies."
His face struggled with some decision. Harry dared to touch his arm. “You think it’s too soon form me to feel love for you, but it’s not. I wouldn’t demand so much, if I didn’t love you already.”
Todrick took two steps back, trained to put distance between himself and a client's treasure.
“How do you feel?”
"You get what you [emotionally] focus on". -Seth/Jane Roberts.
From Lucius’s remark, Draco’s perspective met with a troublesome rationale. Snape couldn’t kill Harry, because he loved him, not just because he was protecting him? He felt certain his father was wrong, or at least misunderstanding something. There was certainly too much illogical feelings behind their former teacher’s hostility towards Harry. There were things glistening in his silence, that didn’t add up. His eyes would burn into Harry’s back whenever Harry wasn’t looking.
“Look, you're making me crazy. I refuse to try to reason with you halfway across the room. Come lay beside me, calm down, and we’ll talk.”
Harry could hear his voice shaking. “Listen, all that nonsense about heirs and duty can get tossed out the window. None of it matters if it’s not what you want. I could pay someone to get knocked up for me. Muggles do it all the time. If this was just about bloodlines and property, you could sell your genetic material to me and some doctor would charge us a bloody fortune to whip up the perfect baby in a petri dish. You’ve got to realize that I don’t give a damn about what I can get from you in terms of power. The only thing I want from you right now, is your friendship. My parents became friends before they fell in love. They were stuck with each other, but they gave each other a shot. If you never have my kid, if we never like each other enough to feel close, give us a chance to be friends. No strings attached.”
But he did come right out and ask for information. “Don’t you think it’s time we talked? You’ve been here going on six months, and I still know almost nothing about you.”
He laughed, but he couldn’t quite make himself say it. “What would you think if I asked for something different?”
“It wasn’t intentional. I haven’t taken anything away from you. Not even your freedom. I’d still escort you out of here right now, if that’s what you wanted. I’d give you time to go home and think about it. You’re not being torn from your life.”
He let it unfold. Even when muggle authorities arrived, they were too confused by it all to stay caught up with it. They tried to tackle Harry, intent on separating him from his victim. But by the time they ran to the spot, Harry’s magic had already vaulted him and Lucius yards away. There was no telling what muggle cameras were recording. Backup arrived and teams of law enforcement tried circling the men to close in on them. They were interrupted by Ministry aurors, who flashed into view, ready to snatch both wizards from the sights of everyone. There were four of them, wands raised.
Harry glared. “I don’t know what I’m getting my family into. I would love to walk out of here. Let it be that simple. But I don’t know you. Not really, and I need to understand what I’m signing.”
Harry’s shower was actually a five minute rinse. He raced to put on dry clothes and oversee Draco’s move to an upstairs bed. Gamy made him eat a sandwich in front of her, before she let him go see Draco.
“We’re all here, Harry,” James tried to stroke his son’s hair. “This is normal. This has to happen. We’re here to help you both get through it.”
Today, he had to swallow his pride. He had to ask his first and second options to take Iece in if something happens to him and Harry. They were the only suitable witches he could think of, and the Universe wasn't exactly raining support and help down upon him. He'd lost touch with his friends after the trials, and he wasn't sure if they could ever look at his sister the way the other two had. It was too much to ask of anyone. But he had the right to ask the people Harry respected the most. And to hell with them, his sister was worth it and she needed looking after. Jipsy would be sent with her.
Nice, Potter. Generous to a fault.
Ahead at the gate, the little body stood still. He held a finger to his chin and grinned at them. His little gown blew in a wind that had nothing to do with physical weather.
“Hundreds of lives ago, you joined us. You were a woman then. We all initiate as women, before going on to male lives. It would only distract you to know about that. So I’m telling you, stop grieving yourself to death over what was taken from you as a man. As a woman, you’ve been through so much more, and that’s what your ordeal really means.
“Harry!”
It took some doing to reassure her. At no point and time did he hear her say she’d give Foster up, and he listened for it, but her display of regret over her lies was satisfying enough for the moment. He talked her into pulling back onto the road and trusting what was to come next. “Take the day off and enjoy yourself.”
Soaked and unconscious, both Harry and Draco lay next to each other on the floor. Harry, in his casual clothing, and Draco, in his pajamas. An effervescence hovered around them. It was such an inexplicable sight, no one wanted to move any closer to them.
“Yes.” He almost didn’t say it. Something in him wanted to jump in that bed and put his arms around the both of them.
Lucius. It had to be some Malfoy family scandal, paid off. They had the money. They had the power to hide blood they didn’t like. All of this had to be coming through him. He didn’t know who Draco’s ancestors were, but he knew they were prejudice. He could just see some girl cast out of everything she’d ever known, just because she picked the wrong boy to fall in love with. That story was as old as magic. If Jipsy had never been bound to serve them for life, would her name still be recorded in their family archives? Draco wouldn’t necessarily have known anything about her. Jipsy was before his time. Even before Lucius’ time. But she was trying to tell them what she knew. It was because of Lucius Malfoy’s blood, that his daughter was suffering the way she was. He’d gotten that much right.
Draco sends the pot of curry over to the table with a graceful wave of his wand. “Dinner first.”
But then again, Harry supposes he has his own issues on spending horrendous amounts of galleons on things that could have been bought at lower, more reasonable prices.
If he is going to waste time, best do it here. With Draco. Who is
, Harry is feeling so much better.
Harry wants them to know that Draco has a map of Harry’s body on his mouth, on his palms, on the tips of his fingers. That he knows all the routes to guide Harry into songs of praises and pleas and sighs and exaltation. That Draco frees Harry with his strong hands, pins him into calm surrender and release. That Draco gives Harry so much,
“Have you noticed anything that sets it off? Anything that aggravates the condition?”
“That won’t be necessary,” Draco announces, “I’ve got him.”
“It would have been a waste if I had to discard all of this just because of avoidable contamination.” Draco shifts beside him, bending forward slightly to reach for a new pair of gloves, and the powdered moonstone doesn’t seem as captivating. There’s a sliver of skin  peeping from underneath Draco’s shirt from the way that the top two buttons are undone, and though Harry’s seen this much skin from Draco before, it’s still a rare enough sight that it makes Harry’s stomach feel as if he’s just hurtled through the Floo.
“Exactly. It must be very confusing for her. Frightening even.”
Harry sighs. “Yeah, okay.”
Harry wishes they know who it is— who makes Harry shiver and tremble underneath questing hands, night after night, until the night bleeds light and the darkness gives way to the sigh of morning, of another day where they’d have to wait under the guise of moonlight to come together and come apart. Harry wants all of them to know how he chants Draco’s name like a prayer, a benediction of which Draco answers with prayers of his own.
Harry’s ears perk at the tirade of colorful words coming from where he thinks is the kitchen and a spot of curiosity starts to trickle in and thaw his limbs. When the noises continue and are now accompanied by overly-dramatic gagging (only interrupted by the occasional incantations of household spells), the urge to see what’s causing all the ruckus in his kitchen has grown from a low buzz of interest to almost irresistible curiosity.
He watches Draco’s eyes as they trail down his torso, follows the course of Draco’s gaze as he maps Harry’s body—the faded locket-shaped scar on the center of his chest, the jagged line running across his left flank and the discolored marks on his belly from his time with the Aurors… the lightning bolt cutting across his left pectoral, sitting on top of his heart. He sees the way grey eyes grow wide before they darken almost imperceptibly. He sees the way Draco’s tongue darts out to wet his mouth and the way he catches his bottom lip with his teeth.
“Are you asking me to hold your hand, Draco?” Harry’s mouth twitches.
The snake slithers across the floor, wraps around Harry and Draco almost excitedly.
The expression on Draco’s face is so open and inviting that it’s so bloody hard not to just give in to this constant urge to stare at it openly. Harry always has to convince himself that Draco doesn’t know what he’s doing to Harry’s insides, but sometimes it’s so difficult to believe that Draco doesn’t do it on purpose. Bloody prick.
“Oh, oh!” All three pairs of eyes swivel to Lavender’s left where Professor Flitwick waves his hand up merrily. “Three Galleons that Harry caves before Sunday.”
There’s a scuffling sound behind him and then a
“You are being a horrible,
“Name,” Harry repeats, his warm hand sliding under Draco’s shirt to rest against the flat plane of his stomach, and he soaks in the satisfying way Draco shivers against him. “She should have a name if we’re keeping her, shouldn’t she?”
Their breaths turn messy as they move against each other, breathing each other’s air, groins pressing
Draco snorts against Harry’s neck. “I don’t think I could even if I wanted to.” Draco’s fingers lace around Harry’s, and Harry wastes no time in fiddling with them, finally able to examine the sharp edges and slopes up close.
“I get cold easily, you know that,” Draco points out. Yes, Harry does know that. “And you are a perpetual bloody furnace in comparison.” Harry knows that, too.
It doesn't help that the classroom is stifling. Nor does it help that his Potions partner isn't letting him do any work to take his mind off the heat.
"The potion was supposed to be cerulean blue, Harry. Might I remind you of the shade of yellow you turned it into?"
Draco huffs, only mildly offended by being brushed off like that, and decides to ignore his… to ignore the git that’s stolen his kitchen for now. Anyway, the sounds of life coming from the other room are almost comforting— a stark contrast to his otherwise usually silent flat— and he lets the tinkling and clinking and sizzling quell his irritation for now. He doesn’t know when the ignoring has shifted to dozing off though, but the next thing he knows there’s a cool hand on his forehead again and the smell of something quite appetizing that’s assaulting his senses makes him blink his eyes open. His forehead is slightly damp and so is the rest of his body. His shirt is starting to cling to his skin, making him feel sticky and too warm and bloody uncomfortable and
Without another word they both set themselves to rights and all buttons and zips in order, with one last check that both Moonstone and Moon seed containers are sealed in their respective orbs, they lock the Greenhouse behind them. Their arms brush as they head back towards the castle, Moon Kit bobbing behind them. The urge to reach out is strong, but Harry manages to keep himself in check.
Draco throws him a half-grin, and Harry’s heart tumbles about behind his rib cage at the sight of it—the slow up-curl of one side of Draco’s lips, the way the corner of his eyes crinkle, the warm emotion just lurking behind his eyes as he draws Harry in. “You spoil him too much.” Underneath the table, Draco’s foot nudges at his and stays there.
“By ‘we’, does that include him?”
” Grey eyes slide over his shoulder and Draco cringes. “And that flitterbloom behind you is overly enthusiastic.”
In the space of a heartbeat, lips move against his, and Harry sighs against them in relief and elation. Draco’s lips are soft despite being wind-chapped, and even without drops of wine on them, they still taste just as sweet.
“Tell me she’s at least non-venomous,” Harry probes, hesitant to move or jostle the colourful reptile around his shoulders.
Harry slips into his seat with a sigh as their dinner guest moves down Draco’s shoulder. Artemis and Apollo give her a wide berth, but otherwise don’t look too alarmed by its—her presence. She bumps one of the legs on their table, then one leg of Harry’s chair and, body spread out like this, Harry can see the odd shape of her tail and the way one eye seems to be paler than the other, a thin, milky film overlying the already pale, pink-red hue.
Turning, he burrows his face into his soft, comfortable pillow and finally falls into a dreamless sleep.
“Mmm—” Draco can’t even find it in himself to keep up the scowl. Not when Harry’s fingers are weaving magic against his temples, against his forehead, diluting the pain— the steady, rhythmic motions making it something more bearable. “Good.”
“What is she saying?” The look on Draco’s face is intrigued, and there’s something in the way he peers at the both of them that Harry thinks he should explore later.
“Very well,” Poppy says in a clipped tone, “I shall transfigure you back to your proper pieces, Harry. But seeing as this is the fourth time this week, I insist that you stay until we work out just what is causing these bouts of... spell malfunction.”
“I thought you were never going to call it that?”
“I have long given up on trying to reason with you,” Draco sighed, “And this isn’t for me, you great big prat. It’s yours.”
“And you should probably clean up once we get back.”
“Ginevra—”
He already spies some new sprigs lined up in their clear glass containers, sitting on the second shelf, and there’s some pink and honey-tinted liquid corked in an expensive-looking vial on the top shelf that Harry’s sure wasn’t there the other day. He’s curious enough to want to inspect it more closely, except Draco’s still preparing his ingredients, and Draco doesn’t appreciate Harry poking about when he’s trying to concentrate. Harry learned that the hard way and he thinks neither of them wants a repeat of that unfortunate night.
. There are plenty of reasons for Draco’s absence, and Harry stubbornly refuses to think that the reason involves him.
The fingers—the mesmerizing fingers that Harry has watched weave magic into cauldrons and potions with rapt attention for months now—disappear completely and, extremely discontented, Harry pulls on Draco’s hair hard enough to earn a very satisfying yelp.
By the time Draco was finished, Harry had been so worked up from watching and helping him send ingredients flying all over the room and slicing and flicking and stirring that… well, they discovered that the tables in Draco’s workroom had their uses for things other than ingredient prep.
It’s fairly obvious that neither of you want to move. Even though inside is nicer. Warmer...
~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~
There’s a stream of coughing at his side as Neville chokes on his drink. Lavender waves her fork at him, bloody steak speared and all, and Harry’s just thankful that his lunch remains fluid-free despite the abundance of liquid sources coming from either side of him. “You do
deliciously slowly, inside.
It hasn’t been as bad as this morning for a while.
Fingers tightened around his. “It hurts,” Draco whispered, so soft that Harry almost missed it. The words themselves was a shock to him, and the manner of admission left him quite a bit shaken up.
Spurred by the prospect of having Draco’s heated skin against his, Harry snaps out of his daze. Harry’s fingers are shaking as they try to unbutton Draco’s shirt, but his sweat-slippery hold on the blasted things make his movements clumsy.
“Okay, that’s okay. Tell me what you’re thinking.” Maybe he could talk Draco down from that ledge.
“And you…
At eleven, their despisal of one another, was cute.
Holy fuck, that had sounded so crazy. He wasn't crazy. He'd been perfectly sane for putting himself in the closet, no matter what it looked like. Since Iece's fall, he'd been carrying a mountain of guilt. She wasn't hurt, but she could've been. He and Draco made it a point to spell her and everything in her immediate vicinity with protection.
“He’s never going to trust me.” Hermione groaned and drew her voice into a whine that took Draco by surprise. She’d ever been a beacon of maturity. Now, nestled in the bosom of her boyfriend and, apparently, her new best friend Ginny, she totally let her guard down and pouted.
should be leaving. We can get all the medical assistance my son needs if we could simply leave this place.”
He’d have to resign from the Ministry, of course. He was ready to do that, realizing that he’d only taken the job in an effort to cooperate with the legal system and patch his family’s reputation. Now it was time to focus on learning to run his company. He didn’t owe anyone else anything.
Kevin stood up. “You want to challenge me, little man? That’s your first real boyfriend. That’s cute. I get more ass a week, than you’ve seen your whole life. Let me tell ya something. If you’re lucky enough to get a piece of that,” he pointed at Draco, “You have me to thank for breaking him in for you. Remember that when you slide in there.”
"She won't even look you in the eye. You left my sister with her?"
Arthur looked like he’d only been waiting for him to speak up. “Of course, my boy. Right this way, we’ll escort you.” He swung his arm around Harry’s shoulder and stirred him down the hall.
Here, he almost said Harry’s name, but something in Snape’s stare stopped him. He went around it.
Harry threw down his money. “Don’t you ever do that again.” He turned and left.
“But she’s so old, she doesn’t need extra energy to feed off of at all. She stays youthful in appearance. About thirty-five, to look at her. And that’s only when she chooses to take human form. Apparently, there was a time when they could produce children, but no one ever remembers a human body being able to do so. When she took the sleeve, she had a way of squeezing Harry’s residual magic from it, in pure form. She inhaled it, and spoke of its quality. She said it was a new energy. For a time, she was magic. She didn’t do spells. She focused on the thing she wanted most. Procreation. Voldemort’s defeat proved her assessment of Harry to be accurate.
Pressure in his head felt like a hangover and everything from his chest down, hurt without him moving it. He knew he shouldn't blame it on the goblins, but his visit to them inspired exactly the residue from his childhood fears that had him fighting to wake up from a nightmare all night long. Hours and hours. It shouldn't even be possible to fight that long without waking up. The battle for his life had been real. He could've died expending that much energy, in that much pain, for that duration. Since he couldn't remember who he was fighting or what they'd done to him, he blamed it on the goblins. His anger didn't know where else to go.
Where there was life, there was hope. He tried to think through his pain. How to convince Snape to let him go? They had never been close while serving Voldemort. There was no such thing among the ranks of the Death Eaters, for one never knew when the Dark Lord would vent his rage by murdering on a whim, or worse, by testing your loyalty and demanding that you kill the wizard he could no longer tolerate in his army. It wasn’t wise to depend on friendship among them. But that’s not to say that there was no concern for each other. He watched Snape’s unique position as Voldemort’s favored spy for twenty years, and didn’t envy him. He could kill in an instant, but didn’t think he could do what had been required of Snape all those years.
– Your only goal is to use words that you hope will destroy the writer’s confidence. You are miffed that their stories keep popping up and fans keep liking them. You’re the Draco lying in wait to sabotage Harry anyway he can. He’d rather provoke Harry than be ignored. It might backfire, but at least, for one exquisite moment, he gets to be the center of Harry’s attention.
Snape extended his wand. “How do I undo it?”
Todrick's eyebrows went down, pointing his displeasure. Harry quickly added, "All I'm saying is, I have a reason to request it. Don't act like I don't. Snape was a powerful wizard. It's possible that he possessed something more valuable than gold that would get his information concealed for him."
“Is this the same spell used to make Grimauld look like the Malfoy Estate?”
“I’m sorry, I know this sucks. Something’s happening. Keep her safe, I’ll be right back, I promise.”
“The more Draco advances down the path provided,” He indicated the hologram, “the more he enters a realm of his own making, filled with things that are important to him. We will lose sight of him and Harry, as they enter the portal of Draco’s patronis. The dragon.”
“Hmm. Very enlightening,” Harry murmurs. “Come on, then.”
When Harry stumbled through the massive grate of 12 Grimmauld Place, he immediately knew that something was wrong. There was no whistling that alerted him that the kettle was on, no sound of turning pages from the sitting room, no sound of lithe footsteps in the bedroom— no sound of life, whatsoever.
Harry cries out.
“So have I. Well, me, and the rest of the staff,” Harry grumbles.
Draco shrugs, a small smile playing on his lips as he moves to stand. “You did a good job of it this morning. Afternoon. Whichever. If you want me to keep calling it that, you should probably keep at it.”
“Me neither,” Harry pauses, feeling the day’s exhaustion slowly creep up on him, making his eyes feel heavy. “I really hope you didn’t plan on kicking me out because I don’t think my legs want to cooperate.”
Draco nods absently. And regrets it. He shuts his eyes. Oh Merlin, his head is pounding.
“It’s not like we’ve been subtle.”
arrive, Draco would not have it any other way. It was only a matter of when they would start arriving.
To Poppy’s credit, her eyes widen only a fraction of a second before she descends on Harry with that all too familiar stern look on her face. “Three days. Why am I not surprised?”
“I could regale the fascinating tale of where my hands have been for the past twenty-four hours but as thrilling as that sounds...” Harry grins, watching Draco struggle with his plastic goggles. He’s not going to help him. The prat deserves to suffer. “I thought you didn’t want to be late.”
He cups Draco through his trousers and is awarded with a muffled something that Harry can’t decipher but he decides must be a good thing. A very good thing, Harry muses, as he rubs Draco’s erection and the sound makes a re-appearance. Harry sniggers. “Use your words, Draco.”
“I don’t know.”
Harry rocks into the touch, brows furrowed, as Draco palms his erection. “
Harry ambles into the room and deposits himself into the nearest, empty chair. There’s a mop swaying in the corner that’s repeatedly going back and forth a solitary stain that Harry knows has been a fixture there for as long as he can remember, but it looks like the old thing’s not going to give up without a fight. “I wasn’t expecting you home today.”
Harry feels Draco nuzzle against his neck and even with sleep slowly eating at his consciousness, Harry still feels ridiculously pleased at the attention. “I’ll hold you to that,” Draco murmurs.
There’s a shuffle by his side, a rustle of fabric, then the sound of footsteps receding, only to be followed by the clanking and clanging of what Draco can only assume as kitchenware in the next room. Draco frowns, even as he snuggles into the comfortable pillow by his side. “Why are you destroying my kitchen?”
Eyes that belonged to a different face that held a playful smirk and its own roguish beauty. Eyes that once shone with love for Harry, love that could have rivaled his mother and father’s.
“They all know.”
“Am I what?”
“Oh,” Harry breathed, worry filling his mind yet again, “Er, thanks.”
Harry wants them to know. Wants them to see the kisses he sears on Draco’s skin, wants his hands to leave glowing imprints of
Whatever Harry’s past qualms about Potions and brewing and questionable ingredients and annoying Slytherins (or one Slytherin, in particular), he most definitely finds them fascinating now.
“I don’t know what’s more distressing: that I’m so used to these things happening that it no longer surprises me, or that I know you well enough to believe you.”
There’s a bark and an unimpressed, almost irritable
“What are you two talking about?” Draco’s tone is bordering on irritation, and the foot that’s still trapped between Harry’s twitches.
Welcoming.
“Probably.”
By the time Poseidon’s colour-shifting lights circle back from yellow to green, Harry’s idly aware of how Draco’s humming has escalated into full-on singing. Poseidon’s peeping up at him again curiously, almost as if in askance, as Draco reaches the chorus of his odd, mixed-up song, and Harry decides that maybe it’s time for an intervention.
“Oh, shove off.” Harry smiles back. Draco’s cock is hard and heavy against his hip, and his leg wraps around Draco’s waist, foot slipping over the curve of his arse, and heel digging into the sweaty, soft skin of his arse. Harry uses his foot as leverage to bring them closer, and Draco groans, lowers his head to lick into Harry’s mouth.
Draco stands, and Harry can now see the bright orb surrounding the open mustard pot. Inside, the powdered moonstone glitters, and the sapphire lining casts a cool glow that turns the contents into a pretty pink-purple color.
They don’t have to worry about the full moon yet. The Wolfsbane will be ready by the time the moon waxes, as it always is, and then they will accompany Lavender to the Shrieking Shack before she transforms, calm, harmless, and not defenseless to her wolf-addled instincts. For now they have Firewhisky, and elf-made wine, and each other’s company, and Celestina’s tones trying to seduce someone to stir her cauldron.
Alright, maybe he isn’t
Draco seemed to consider this. He breathed out, having seemingly decided on something, and nodded. Then he looked down at the way their fingers entwined against Draco’s stomach, “Will you stay?”
Harry looks back at Draco, and forces him to meet his gaze— which is entirely too close that Harry tenses instinctively just to avoid backing off even slightly. Sometimes he thinks that the git is really hell bent on torturing him just for the heck of it. And he doesn’t even know that he’s doing it.
Harry didn’t know what he expected when he stepped foot into the large entrance hall. Maybe he expected drapes of black cloth, or a pavilion of flowers lining up the walls, maybe he expected house-elves scrambling back and forth trying to fix whatever needed fixing before other guests arrived. Because he knew other guests
, erections pressed together through what seems to be too many layers of clothing.
Harry’s breath hitches. He squirms in his place underneath Draco trying to push nearer. Wanting more friction. He draws Draco close until their chests and mouths and stomachs are flush against each other, making the air around them a current of heat and a ripple of static. “Gods— Draco— I want— I can’t—”
Harry tried to keep a frown off his face. It’s not like he didn’t appreciate it when Draco bought him things, because he did. Appreciate it, that is. But he didn’t need an expensive green sweater— not when he had a perfectly fine one upstairs. “Draco...”
Stops. Fucking headache. “I’m fine.”
“Tentacles,” Harry says as one, grey tentacle wraps itself around Draco’s leg, almost making the both of them fall over.
“I brought some treats for him,” Harry grins and raises a paper bag.
Harry tries not to laugh. He really does.
He sighs— warm breath welcome against the almost-arctic breeze. “Let them.”
be late if they don’t go now. Well, technically late.
“What is she saying?” Draco mutters, a steady, warm weight against Harry’s chest, a stark contrast to the cool, winding movement of their snake.
Draco gazed at it for a second, before allowing a small smile to appear on his lips. He reached for the hand and held it firmly. The two boys were silent for a while, fingers twined together, merely looking as Narcissa blinked down on them from her portrait. The slight tug of her lips was now so familiar to Harry— the way it was there one second and gone the next, the way it spoke of secrets shared between them, and the way it was always,
In the distance, he can spy the Whomping Willow looking as inconspicuous as ever, branches gently swaying along with the cool night breeze. It must be lonely for Lavender, Harry thinks, spending the night alone in that beat up old shack. Remus had his dad and Sirius and even Pettigrew. Lavender… well.
“You’re fond of
She’s never liked noisy places, and it is a testament of having grown up with Apollo that she merely lets him get on with the ruckus, sitting tall and pretty with a now calculated sort of disinterest. Up to this day, Harry wonders how this little beast is the same helpless, cuddly kitten Draco rescued on that very stormy night.
Draco looks at him, all narrowed eyes and surly, thin lips. He’s so properly riled up about Harry’s inattention that Harry has this probably-not-wise desire to draw it out.
It takes a moment but when Harry realizes it, he can only do so much about the fond exasperation that’s taking over his face. Of course Draco’s forgotten. Harry isn’t even surprised. He’s learned by now that if he were to shove a bunch of potion ingredients and a cauldron under Draco’s nose, he can pretty much get away with most anything.
as Harry’s fingers scratches and pets, obviously pleased with the affection he’s lavishing on her, and Harry’s irritation sizzles into nothing.
He nips at your neck and you reign in a shiver.
“How long has he been gone, Kreacher?”
“What’s that?”
tired? I was the one who did all the work.”
This close, Harry doesn’t need his glasses to see Draco’s face clearly. Even without them, he knows he’ll be able to see the exact same thing—long, pale lashes, flecks of blue and grey and wide-blown pupils trained on Harry’s own. Draco’s expression is so open and so different from last night, and even then, seeing the spark of desire that he’s certain is mirrored on his own face, Harry cannot move.
“He is saying nothing, sir. Is only asking Kreacher to give Master Harry this,” Kreacher said, handing a piece of parchment to Harry.
“I wouldn’t mind,” Lavender quips, with a smile that looks far too innocent to be anything
Harry grins. “Moon Kit? Really? Finally worn you out, have I?”
Draco paws at the things poking out of his hair in silent horror. Something nudges Harry's cheek as he rights the cauldron.
It’s odd how his Friday nights have morphed into this, but he’s comfortable and almost content, even if there’s a strange plant that’s been miserably failing to knot his shoelaces together for the past minute or so.
Draco cooking only means one thing, and Harry’s eyes dart across the sitting room, immediately on guard.
The last thing that Harry’s aware of is the gentle press of Draco’s lips against his shoulder before he lets himself get whisked away to dreams of pink and blue and purple and bright, glowing moons.
He’s drowning—he’s been drowning for a while now—and he has no desire to save himself, not when for the first time in what seems to be a long while, Harry can finally breathe again.
the snake echoes, trying the name out with a pleased sounding
There’s a slight twitch of Draco’s lips, and it’s ridiculous; it’s not been a whole day since he’s last seen the git, but there’s an ache in Harry’s chest at the sight of him all crouched and placing protective spells over the powdered moonstone’s container.
They sip their respective beverages, fingers still entwined, until the mop in the corner finally gives in and drops to the floor, defeated. Harry snorts into his mug, flicks a finger and rights the old thing against the wall. He's awarded with Draco's amused smile, and yes, Harry's feeling loads better.
Because this morning, this morning Harry had woken up feeling out of sorts and sluggish and downright awful— with a headache that had only steadily grown worse as the day progressed until it was an overactive bludger banging against his skull.
“Draco,” Harry sighs, eyeing the offending price tag as he hands over the lumpy green thing reluctantly. “You have a massive pile of sweaters. Do you really need another one? Another
“Tell me,” Harry draws back, shaky and chest pounding, “What you want. Tell me.”
Harry eyes his companion. He notes the faint crease on his forehead, and the way his lips are set in a thin line. Harry sighs, practically hearing the admonishing tone seep through that disapproving expression. “Just spit it out, Draco.”
Harry tilts his head up. Draco’s breath is a warm gust of air on Harry’s face and the smell of alcohol is almost concealed as Harry’s assaulted with Draco’s stronger scent of apples and citrus. The scent is overpowering in the best of ways, making Harry feel even more light-headed.
“Do you still have a stock of Hangover Potion? Because I will not take kindly to you banging down my door on a Saturday morning just because of a bloody headache.”
Helios echoes, sliding into a round heap just a few inches away from the playing pair.
It was only then that Harry looked at the portrait of the woman in front of him. It echoed the woman he remembered in the forest eight years ago— beautiful, harsh aristocratic features, eyes that flashed with grim determination. But he knew her better now, knew the kindness that made the cold color soften, knew the love that could make her entire face glow. And he couldn’t help but feel a twinge of sorrow as he looked into those stormy eyes and remembered a different set of eyes.
It’s better now though.
makes its way out of the fridge, Draco’s eyes widen in horror before he hurriedly bins the thing and casts an air-freshening charm to boot. The scent hits Harry’s nose like a tickling charm and he scrunches his nose before, unable to reign the blasted thing in, he sneezes.
One by one, each tentacle wraps around its wrestling partner, and in one quick motion, the daring flitterbloom tugs. Its neighbor is unearthed from its pot which hits the edge of a table with a resounding
She shrugs. “It’s not going to make it any less true even if I don’t say it, Harry. Besides, you’re thinking it anyway. I’m merely voicing it.”
...but infinitely more lonely. You don’t belong there.

They leave the hall as more Galleons change hands and really, Harry thinks as they make their way back to Draco’s work room to retrieve the Moon Kit, he has no problem doing that at all.
“I’m not sick,” Draco repeats stubbornly. It’s just a headache. Honestly.
It's cold.
“Alright, Potter, I like a bit of hair tugging as much as the next person but ouch?” Draco rubs at the spot, looking just a bit petulant.
Harry watches as Draco de-gloves, then he looks on, perplexed, when he starts to reach for another set, clearly planning on continuing with his ingredient prep. “Erm.”
Harry’s legs quiver and he feels Draco grin against his cheek. A wet, hot tongue darts out to tease at the lobe of his ear. “If you say so.” Draco’s wrist and fingers do
Harry blinks. “Why, did you want another go?”
Harry snorts into his glass.
It’s not like you’re against it, but it's both a relief and a conviction. Still, there’s comfort in the way his fingers glide across your skin.
“Careful there, Apollo.” Harry kneels and scratches him behind his good ear.
Draco bites Harry’s shoulder, making him yelp. “We’ve already talked about it. If you want to talk about it
"Come on." He takes your hand, and brings you inside.
“There we are, Harry. All back to normal,” Poppy's voice is an unwelcome intrusion to the little bubble Harry suddenly finds himself in.
“Bloody—oh for the love of— now that’s just

falls from his lips when he starts to feel more sticky than satisfied, and once the tingling sensation of the cleaning charm leaves him feeling less disgusting than a few seconds ago, he allows the heady state of well-being to consume him and chase all his doubts and uncertainties away, just for tonight.
He eyed the sweater that Draco left on the couch, picked it up, and ran his fingers along the stitches before trying it on. It was soft, and it felt marvelously warm and comfortable on him. He thought of the faded yellow jumper that Molly had sent him last Christmas and couldn’t help but feel a twinge of guilt. It

He gives in with a quiet sigh. “You are just like your father. We should have named you after him instead.”
This morning Harry did not have blanket shortage problems.
“Bit to the right, Harry.”
“Not cute.”
They resume their trek to Harry’s room.
“Don’t let go,” Draco murmured.
“I want to see you.”
“No, not tonight,” Draco answers while he inspects the moonstone for any impurities.
“You can’t feed a snake curry.” Draco chews slowly. Harry watches the bob of Draco’s throat as he swallows, lets the slight downturn of his mouth distract him from the
He hears Harry sigh as Draco stretches out on the couch, vision swimming as he attempts to open his eyes but only ends up scrunching them close again. Draco sinks into the soft pillows, grudgingly accepting that he‘s not going to be able to go anywhere tonight. Even as he’s trying to convince himself that it’s not the end of the world if he’s stuck on his couch on a Friday night with no one else but a flightless bird and his…
“Helios.”
the clothes... he could never wrap his head around why he needed so many and why they had to be so expen—
It's cold.
It was a bit puzzling at first, this budding interest in Potions, since Harry never had much interest in it when he was a student. When Harry tries to rationalize it, he thinks the disinterest was more to do with his association of the subject to a professor he strongly disliked and less to do with the actual subject itself. He’s discovering that brewing isn’t all that bad. If anything, it’s most intriguing.
It’s not like Harry isn’t used to Draco’s extended trips by now, and he knows that they’re a necessary and unavoidable part of his job, but that doesn’t mean he’ll ever get used to missing the sodding prat and wishing he’s there beside Harry and cuddling him to death—breathing against Harry’s neck, head slotted neatly in that little crook of shoulder and jaw as if the spot was carved especially for him, arms and legs thrown over Harry as if to make up for his tendency to hog the blankets.
“I wasn’t going to touch the stone,” Harry murmurs. He scowls at the floor and shifts into a more comfortable position on his designated stool. It’s still soft from the Cushioning Charm that Draco placed on it months ago but it’s still a pain in the arse when Harry sits on it for hours on end, waiting for Draco to finish his brewing. He’s only been sitting for a few minutes today, but his knee is already bouncing and he’s itching to stand and move around and examine the odd if not pretty new things in Draco’s inventory.
Harry’s still rubbing one side of his bum when Draco re-emerges from his room, hair neat and top all buttoned, shirtsleeves rolled back down without a crease in sight. The pink around his eyes has lightened enough that they’re almost unnoticeable, and Harry’s sure that by the time they arrive at Neville’s quarters, there will be no proof left of Draco having ever worn his brightly-colored goggles. It’s a bit disappointing, but Harry consoles himself with the fact that the full moon is approaching, and that means he has plenty of opportunities to see Draco’s glorious, post-brewing disheveled self.
Low, familiar humming diverts Harry’s attention, and he ends up brushing off any lingering soot on his lime-green robes with a soft huff of amusement. The tune is somewhat off-key but it still tugs at the corners of his mouth, at the happy-tired beat of his heart, and warms the cold stress he’s bottled up during his shift.
He feels warm, moist breath against the corner of his mouth as Draco grinds against him again and again.
avoiding him, or hiding.
you.”
he is
He supposes by now, he shouldn’t really be surprised.
Harry’s free hand brushes Draco’s hair back, allowing him an unhindered view of pale lashes and pale eyebrows, bright grey eyes piercing through his own, mirroring Harry’s need—the crackling currents of yearning prickling under his skin, sizzling in his stomach, building in his groin. He sees Draco’s expression, and he knows Draco wants Harry as much as Harry wants him. Harry sighs. “Loads better.”
