She rolled her eyes. “Kouroi, anybody with common sense would be able to figure it out. That being said, I don’t know how you’ve managed to keep it from your mother this long.”
out loud. He's too blissed out to care, though. The soup is just rich enough, with the tomatoey goodness and the spices and
As he sniffed the rose again, he faintly registered the coppery, cloying scent of blood on it. He exhaled wistfully at the smell. Aphrodite’s scent was still stubbornly stuck to it, even after all this time.*
Once he had grabbed a decent amount of food and at least three knives, he ran out of the kitchen into the main dining room. There were suits of armor guarding the room, but they were at the walls so he was able to dodge all their attempts to catch him. He pulled the door open and slipped out before they could hold him.
For the rest of the time, he chatted with his followers as he painted his nails light blue, fluffed his hair, and put on his black eyeliner. He put on a faux nose ring for good measure. Finally, thirty minutes before they were meant to meet up, Draco ended the live stream and got ready to leave. Even though he had a driver’s license, he was too nervous to drive today so he just asked Dobby to take him there.
“Figures. You don’t seem like the type to really care much for personal hygiene.” He smirked as Harry glowered at him in the mirror.
“You’re injured.” The beast hissed. It reached out and grasped both of Draco’s hands in one of its own.
Harry smiled down at Draco, who was half-delirious and murmuring desperately at Harry. Harry buried his face in his silky blond hair (that had now grown out to past his shoulders) as he and Draco lay down on Draco’s bed.
Draco stomped through the seemingly endless corridors, his magic ripping all the tapestries to shreds and even destroying some of the floating chandeliers.
He moaned again when Harry’s hand strayed down to his arse, kneading it and squeezing it gently. The other moved to his cock and started to pump it gently.
“Hello, Mr. Dumbledore.” He replied, dropping his basket to hug him. He smelt like parchment and ink, a familiar scent.
“It was nice hanging out with you.” Draco smiled. Impulsively, Harry placed a small peck on his cheek, grinning when it turned red.
“Where’s Father?” Draco asked, a sick feeling crawling into his gut. The horse nudged its head as if it wanted to take Draco somewhere.
His name was dracothegaynerd (quite a funny name in Harry’s opinion). Out of curiosity, Harry clicked on his username and got taken to his page. He had five million followers (‘Not bad,’ Harry thought) and the thumbnails of his videos looked interesting, from pranks to lip-syncing to transitions to showing off different kinds of outfits and basically lots of different kinds.
Harry sighed to himself as the soul in front of him begged and pleaded not to go to the Fields of Punishment despite the fact that he had murdered his entire family while they were sleeping. Even without the heinous crime on shoulders, Harry was already more than used to dealing with temper tantrums. He had been doing this for thousands of years, after all.
Also, just in case you're curious, Persephone did have several suitors, including Ares, Hephaestus, Hermes, Apollo and even Zeus himself. However, I removed Zeus because that would make the story even weirder than it already is :p
came in. He was about to shoot me, but then Draco begged him not to, and he actually listened to him. And then they ran away. And I- “
The comments were mixed, and Draco couldn’t tell which one people liked more. Finally, after minutes of tense deliberation and comment checking, he settled on 1.
“Mother.” He smiled, putting a mask of innocence on his face. If he was going to pretend, he needed to do it well. His mother was scarily good as smelling out lies.
.” Harry turned his head and saw a tall, muscular man standing a few feet away from him. He had a sword pointed at Harry’s throat.
As he rose up from Draco’s arse, he noticed that a good amount of precum had leaked from Draco’s rigid cock onto his skirt and the floor. He smirked.
“Dad-” He started. Before he could finish, Harry’s mother walked up to him and slapped him. Hard. The sound echoed throughout the house.
“That’s tough.” Harry said, blowing on Draco’s nails to make the base coat dry faster. “How about your mum?”
The golden doors were open, and he slipped inside. He stopped in his tracks for a moment, just taking in the scene in awe. There were brilliant rainbows raining down from the ceiling and several corners, lighting up the dark room and coloring everybody’s faces. There were hundreds of people; some at the wine table, some on the railing of the second floors, waving and chatting happily; some even flying and hanging from the chandeliers. Loud, jaunty music blared, most likely from the satyrs and the dancing faeries in the middle of the room. It was chaotic, and Draco absolutely-
Harry pushed the tip of his finger into Draco as he stroked Draco’s cock with his other hand, and Draco’s vision went white as he came.
“Harry,” he cried out weakly. When Harry continued to piston into him, he cleared his voice and called out to him louder. “
“Harry!” Harry jumped slightly in his seat, then scowled. Gods, he hated when she snuck up on him like that.
Harry pulled his cheeks open again and watched Draco’s hole clench right in front of his eyes. The sight of it almost made him come, just from how hot it was. He quickly reached down and pulled his erect cock out of his sweatpants, stroking it teasingly. He shuddered, before turning back to the lovely arse in front of him.
“Dray, I…” He trailed off as he took in what his husband was wearing, his mouth hanging open in shock.
“Wait!” He exclaimed. Harry had warned him about his stamina before, and it wasn’t his fault he was still hard. Draco was just being forgetful again. “It’s ok. You can keep going.”
Soon, he arrived at the fisherman’s stall. He was one of the kinder people in the kingdom and always reduced the price of his fish in return for Draco to help him get worms from the earth.
“Oh, Father.” His voice cracked. He reached into the pack he had brought with him and brought out a small canister of water and some clean bandages.
Draco knew that things were not perfect. The world could end anytime from then. There could be a giant war that wiped out the human race. Harry’s parents were still wary of them. He would never see his parents again. Robots could take over the world. Fuck, aliens could come and destroy the planet.
Kore snarled and moved in front of him again. He looked quite similar to an angel in his rage, with his glowing grey eyes, his long blond hair, his perfectly unblemished skin.
Draco leaned back into Harry’s chest, idly playing with the black hair that had started growing there in considerable amounts. Harry usually shaved his chest hair but had stopped at Draco’s request.
Harry grunted, but complied with Draco. They kept on repeating the exercises for several minutes until Draco saw Harry’s body relax.
“I’m alright, Mrs. Weasley.” He answered. Ginny hopped forward to the front of the cart, the tea in her cup sloshing around precariously.
Harry lazily fucked Draco’s arse as he came down from his high, making some of the come leak out of Draco’s loose hole with a loud squelching sound.
“Harry,” he pleaded weakly, collapsing onto the chair and onto his come. Harry continued for several seconds, before finally letting up. He hushed Draco’s small moans and dragged him into his lap, rubbing his back as the aftershocks of his orgasm slowly faded away.
“Hannah, I’m sorry, but logically you are the most suspicious person.” Hermione said, quietly. She usually didn’t talk much, but she hung around with Ronald Weasley a lot.
"It looks nice." Draco comments. Harry nods. "Let's order our coffee and snag the beanbags by the biggest window." Draco looks at the biggest window. It has a view of the town, and the sunset too. It looks spectacular.
He pushed the door open and walked up to the standing mirror in the middle of the room, framed with gold. On top, it read
The way it had all started was funny, really. Instead of becoming an Auror after graduating from Hogwarts, Harry had instead remained in Grimmauld Place to take care of Teddy. Andromeda had contracted a rare magical strain of polio, and while it hadn’t killed her, she had lost the use of her lower body. Harry had offered to take care of Teddy for the nest year while she was in motor rehabilitation; she agreed happily.
“I’d rather not have anyone drool over my car. Or smudge the glass.” Draco shuddered. Finger smudges were the absolute
Like how he was pounding into Draco, his nails digging into Draco’s pale skin and ignoring Draco’s weak pleas for him to
Ever since Nikolai Melnikof had invented the first EmotiBot in 2798, the world had changed drastically. Now, there were all
They linked arms and made their way back up the stairs. Throughout the walk, Draco could feel its eyes on him, which made him want to squirm.
Soon, he arrived at the sweets shop. He walked inside, moaning from relief as the delightfully warm air hit him. He looked around and noticed that the shop was a bit empty, with only a few people present. Cormac wasn’t there. He checked his watch. It was five minutes to eight, so he supposed that he was a bit early.
“Good morning dear.” Mrs. Weasley chirped back to it. Draco still wasn’t sure what object Mrs. Weasley was, or what any
It looked like a world from a fairytale. Everything was so... nature-y. The were strange purple-leaved trees that were literally miles wide, each of them serving as a block of apartments. The houses were actually grown out straight from the ground, and the roofs were covered in leaves.
“Hermione, I really don’t need a lecture now. Please.” He added as he saw her open her mouth to start ranting again.
They both sat back down at the table. Draco looked at all the delicacies, trying to decide what to eat first. He was
. The man was an angel, sitting in his heaven and Harry was the forbidden snake, the poisoned apple that the man would bite into and fall into evil, into the darkness, into
"Coming right up. You guys just get your seats and I'll bring your order to you." She disappears into the back room.
Harry sat in the Gryffindor Lunch Hall, munching on his pizza slice quietly. He had a Forensic Science paper to read (he already had homework on the first day of college; ugh) later in the day, but for now he was-
“Right! Draco, the girl in all black is Pansy. Luna’s the one with blond hair and Neville’s the last bloke. Luna, Pansy and Neville, this is Draco. He’s not from around here.”
“I...” He trailed off, unable to continue his sentence. Harry cupped his face and kissed him softly on the mouth.
“That you are a selfish and arrogant fellow!” She shouted, causing everybody to turn their heads towards them.
“Kouroi!” He jumped and spun around. Standing behind him, in her ethereal glory, was his mother. Her cacao eyes blazed with godly fury, and her skin was starting to glow a bit. Draco tsked in his mind. She always was quick to her temper.
Harry sneered at the dead body as he pulled his diamond-encrusted dagger out of its chest. The blood had managed to stain everywhere, including his new trousers, and he was rather annoyed by that.
Potter turned to look at him with infuriatingly bright, green eyes and a lopsided grin that could only mean trouble. “Isn’t it obvious? I’m getting ready for class.”
Harry’s office was quite large, it had been Professor Lupins office when he taught here and it held fond memories for Harry. There was a small bedroom to one side that served him well during the week, and he quite quickly settled back in.
“So,” said Potter eventually, “I was thinking of going to The Three Brooms,” he sighed slightly, “but I don’t want to go alone.” He glanced self-consciously at Draco, then back to the desk in front of him.
Draco rolled his eyes, playfully, “Of course I have, I’m a potions master,” He smiled at her, “But for students it does pose a challenge. So,” he raised his copy of the textbook into the air, and spoke loudly, for emphasis, “read up on it. Study it. Do your research before the next class. I shall know if you haven’t done it when you inevitably produce a shoddy mess.” he smiled and motioned to the students to pack up their things.
Alexandre glanced longingly at Harry, and then slumped off towards the backstage door. Harry frowned at Draco, with frustration growing inside him. The glare that Draco directed at Alexandre, however, was intimidating enough that Harry thought twice about calling him out on his behaviour. He restrained himself from firing a scathing comment his way - Alexandre was supposed to be working, and Draco was good friends with the owner. Harry convinced himself to not look into it, he was probably just trying to make sure that Blaise’s employees didn’t cross the line.
He had changed since Harry had seen him that morning. He was wearing a much more casual, though still suave outfit and Harry most certainly noticed. He still wore his black hooded cloak with a snake clasp, but underneath he wore the Slytherin green checked suit trousers and a grey pullover. Harry could see a grey collar peeking through the top of the jumper. Draco rolled his sleeves up and he joined Harry.
“We do have…” he cut himself off as Draco’s tongue teased his neck again, “We do have a house… we could go to…” he managed to pant out.
Draco considered things for a second or two, “I think it can,” he paused, “I’ll just have to figure out why I’m feeling the way I do. I wonder if I could just be happy?” he mused.
Every so often, Draco would look across the room and smile; it made Harry wonder how long it had been since he experienced a true family Christmas – or if he ever had.
Draco’s heart flipped: Potter had been speaking about him to his friends. He felt the faint flutter of butterflies in his stomach but he soon suppressed them, “Yes, well. I’ve been on the right track for quite some time, I’d just still been having a hard time with everything.” Draco explained.
McGonagall leaned forwards eagerly in her chair, “Have a biscuit, Potter,” she pushed a plate towards him, “and tell me all about it.”
“Now, before you ask,” he carried on, aware that he had been speaking for a while, “I destroyed the wand,” a groan of disappointment went through the class, “and I did not use these curses lightly,” he explained, “you really do have to have a strong enough desire to cast them. Now…” he said, “can I get back to teaching you please?” he added with a smile.
He heard Harry’s characteristic heavy but quick footsteps and jumped away from Potters desk, focusing instead on the evidence board.
“That’s highly admirable, Draco.” Harry put the vial back into the box and leaned back onto the desk.
“Shall I get us some drinks, Potter?” Malfoy asked, whipping off his charmed snake cloak in one swift movement.
As they walked to the stands Harry felt Draco's hand bump up against his a few times. With a fond smile, and quite a few nerves, he bit the bullet and grasped Draco's hand in his own. A small gasp escaped Malfoys lips, and Harry found himself looking - he knew what those lips could do, what they tasted like, what reaction they could provoke - and yet right now the smile that emerged was beautifully naive and sweet. A flush crept up onto his cheeks so Harry squeezed his hand, just to see the blush grow even more.
“I barely see anyone from Hogwarts now,” Malfoy said, “Well, until I got this job, I suppose.” He flashed a smile at Harry.
Harry smirked to himself, and carried on filling in the forms and things in front of him, “Thank you, Malfoy.” he smiled, his voice light and sarcastic. He could feel rather than see Malfoy glaring at him.
Draco sat on his bed, still in his shirt from the night before with his sleeves rolled up to his elbow. It had only been Malfoy.
Draco nodded, “That’s not so dissimilar to what happened to me. God, we’ve both been through it, huh?”
“Oh… Oh my god,” Draco whimpered into the duvet, gripping the material with his fists and bucking back into Harry's face.
Harry and Draco walked back to the castle, energised by their night out. Draco had his arm around Harry, supporting the drunk wizard as he walked back to the castle.
Draco broke the moment, sure now that his limbs would respond if he told them to, “How does a pot of tea and a cigarette before bed sound?” His voice was quiet, hoarse; heavy with the implication that Harry may stay the night.
He felt Draco slip a hand under his boxers and he slid them off. Harry felt exposed, but he liked it. He felt Draco’s hot, shaky breath on his thighs, and a soft kiss on his hip. He held his breath as all of a sudden Draco took him entirely into his mouth.
Draco smiled again, how typical of Potter to try and make other people feel better when he was suffering the most, “Thank you, Neville,” Draco was genuinely glad to have someone like Neville on his side, he knew that he would stick up for him if there was any hassle, “I appreciate your thinking of me, I might come around for a butterbeer or two.”
He tried the door – it was open. He entered the room and it was empty. The door to Potters office was closed. He knocked on this door, and heard a shuffling around inside.
“Pans, I don’t fancy Harry Potter,” he stroked her leg absentmindedly, “We work together and he’s being annoying.”
“I like it,” Harry said, his voice already sleepy, “It reminds me of the Gryffindor common room,” he leant forwards and picked up a glass of firewhiskey, “maybe that’s why you don’t like it all that much - you’re used to the cold dungeons.” He mirrored Malfoys remark from earlier and smiled.
“You know, Ron,” Harry grinned, “I think you’re the only person to get more eloquent when they drink,”
Harry nodded, “I was just telling Hermione something. I’ll tell you all about it later, if you fancy having tea in my room tonight?”
“It’s alright, love.” Harry murmured into the blond’s hair, ignoring the way he squirmed and tried to free himself from Harry’s tight grasp.
“Tia. How are you?” He smiled, squeezing her hand fondly. Out of all of his horrible siblings, she was the only one that he genuinely liked. She was kind, beautiful and all together a wonderful person to be around. A much better person than
He closed the bag, promising to save the rest for later, and made his way to the Gate of Clouds. However, only two of the
Later that evening, Draco got ready for his date with Cormac. He pulled on a simple black button up with jeans and his Chelsea boots. He grabbed his black overcoat from the rack next to the door.
“I guess it’s just us now.” Draco sighed. He turned back to Harry, who was holding his hand and looking at him oddly.
He quickly lifted Draco up and pulled out of him for a moment, before flipping him around and pushing back in. He hungrily took in Draco’s flushed chest, his peaked nipples and his pink, blushing face. He looked beautiful in a way that Harry couldn’t put in words.
He walked up to Cormac and yanked his collar aside. There, on his neck, were several purpling hickeys. And his breath-
“Awake, are you?’ He turned to see the beast lounging on a sofa nearby, flicking lazily through the pages of a small novel. Draco wondered how its claws didn’t tear the delicate pages.
Draco sighs as he and Harry get down. People are still staring. He walks briskly into the cafe, which is called Jade’s Java. It has a homey feel to it, which Draco likes. There are tables and chairs, but there are also teal beanbags next to the windows and folded blue blankets on the carpeted floor. In one corner, there are bookshelves filled with books and magazines. It looks bohemian and avant-garde.
“Here you go, and make sure you get back before your mother finds you. You spend an awful amount of time down there.”
After their initial encounter, the two of them had just clicked, for some reason. They remained great friends for the next few months, and Harry had quickly developed feelings for the blond. When he told his best mates, Ron and Hermione had been skeptical, not because of who Draco was but because Harry had refused to see a Mind-Healer after the War.
Harry’s grin turned dark. “It’s something I’ve been working on recently. I call it the Cruciatus Curse.”
“Fuck, you were so good, love,” Harry sighed into Draco’s hair. Draco clutched onto Harry’s shoulders tightly, panting heavily as he felt the last of the aftershocks ravage his body.
“Hey Draco!” He looked up and saw Harry walking towards him with a tall, freckled ginger and a shorter girl with extremely bushy hair. It looked strangely attractive in a nerdy way. If Draco was into girls, he would have blushed a little.
“If it is an invitation to a party, tell Lady Aphrodite that I will not be able to attend any gatherings for some time. I am quite busy with my duties and I cannot ignore them.”
Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t respond. Before the beast could speak up, a cart rolled in through the large open doors at top speed, screeching to a halt at Draco’s bedside. As he squinted, he realized that Mrs. Weasley and the other people (well,
“I don’t want to even look at them.” He growled. Draco pouted, and slid a hand down his bare chest suggestively.
“There goes poor little Malfoy!” Draco groaned and turned around to face Seamus Finnegan and Dean Thomas. They liked to taunt him about his family’s poverty and lack of status.
“What do you want?” Draco asked, bravely. The monster laughed, its deep metallic voice booming around the castle.
Draco ran inside the house to fasten his cloak and was met by his pale mother in the kitchen. She was leaning heavily on the wall, clutching the windowsill to support herself.
His mother would probably just wear the formal, yellow robes she always wore for parties. Draco wished that she would let him style her outfit at least
He walked under the overbearing iron gateway and took several random turns until he was sure that he was lost in the blooming rose hedges and the pointed iron poles poking out of them. The path was wide enough for several people to stand in it side-by-side, which was just what Harry needed. The only thing that illuminated his path was the twinkling stars and the full moon in the indigo sky, as well as the flashing lights from Aphrodite’s palace.
They soon got to the boisterous pub, which had a warm glow coming out of it. Harry led him to a set of tables in the back, where there were lots of people Draco had seen before. He only recognized Harry, Ron, Hermione and Cormac.
“Hey muffin.” Draco smiled as Harry sat next to him on the couch and pulled Draco onto his lap, nuzzling his nose into Draco’s neck. Harry was very affectionate, just one of the many things Draco loved about him. It didn’t hurt that he called Draco ‘muffin’ either.
He quickly pulled one of his older chitons that had faded over the centuries. There was no way in Hades he would ever go frisking about in his new clothes. His mother would kill him if she ever found out.
“Merlin, Potter, have you never heard of body lotion? I’m certain that I would be able to hear you and your dreadful noise from at least a mile away.”
"No, don't! ARGH!" He screams as he launches his giant tub of popcorn at the TV. Harry's looking scared now.
He paused for a moment, just long enough to make Draco squirm impatiently. Then, he pulled Draco’s pale arse cheeks apart and licked a long stripe up his arse crack.
“Draco!” He turned to see Cormac stumble in, out of breath. Draco crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow.
“Gods, you’re so hot.” Harry groaned. He dropped to his knees (of course, after he wandlessly cast another cushioning charm for his knees) and gripped Draco’s arse tight enough to leave red marks behind.
, Draco.” Harry groaned, bucking wildly into Draco’s mouth. Draco let Harry hold his head in place and fuck his mouth, still placing licks and small hums whenever he could.
“Don’t come yet, love.” Draco let out an anguished sob that sent sharp prickles of pleasure straight to Harry’s cock.
more organized with him in charge. But Harry was not honest at all, and there was no way in Tartarus he would even say that to anybody.
Narcissa Malfoy looked imperious even in death, something that Harry had to admire. It seemed that the old Malfoy matriarch never let go of her pride, even if it cost her her own life.
“Until I met you. You captured my eye since I first saw you that day. And I truly love you. I could never murder you.”
As the light faded from his eyes, the last thing he saw was a pair of piercing green eyes that seemed to stare directly into his soul.
“Just set them up on a date.” Draco laughed. The sight of Harry ranting in a bathrobe and a hot pink face mask was quite funny. It didn’t help that his hair was wrapped in a towel, or that he was wearing fluffy bunny slippers.
He barely had time to run into the bathroom before he threw up into the toilet, crying and heaving into the white porcelain.
“Lord Hades?” Harry’s eyes snapped open to see the three kings staring at him. “Your vote, my Lord?”
Harry spent the rest of his afternoon watching his -Draco’s; what a strange name- videos and soon gathered that the blond was rich, snobbish in a funny way and very,
Now, all the ground was made of plated metal sheets, with a few clumps of green grass peeking out of the cracks here and there. Animals had been kept in zoos and laboratories, bred at an inhumane rate just to satisfy the hunger of the human race. Plants were kept in reservoirs and preserving parks. Everything now was cold, metallic and emotionless.
The atmosphere had changed since Draco had left. Harry hadn’t even realized how much life the blond had brought until he left. Now, everyone was preparing for the curse to finally become permanent. Nobody had any reason to smile anymore.
He had arrived in the town a few days ago, shaking and trying to convince the villagers that Draco, the little angel, had been kidnapped by a beast who he claimed was Harry Potter himself. It wasn’t hard to convince the town that he was a senile old coot.
Cedric smirked to himself as he fastened his cloak onto his broad shoulders. Really, it wasn’t hard to convince the mental asylum warden to lock up the old Malfoy patriarch (not without a bribe, of course).
would also like an explanation is he was suddenly kidnapped and trapped far away from his home. Well, not that anyone
“Oh no.” He placed a shaky hand over his mouth. He watched as Cedric led the villagers out of the town square and to the direction of the forest.
Harry’s pace quickened, and the tears in Draco’s shiny eyes began to spill over onto his face. His hard cock bounced up and down as Harry kept on pounding into him like a wild animal, not even slowing down or stopping at all. He looked absolutely debauched, and Harry reveled in the thought that only
I just can't really find any inspiration for it anymore. And also, I need to work on my commitment problems (!in writing!)
He abruptly sat up, making Draco take a small step back. “You know what? I’ve heard a lot about you, Doc.”
Ten excruciating minutes later, Draco finally arrived at the hospital. The nurses took one look at the bandaged man and sprang into action, gently ushering into the nearest room.
“If you wanted to tell them, you would have already. Don’t think you can play games with me, Doctor.”
Draco couldn’t think of anything but how Harry’s warm breath felt against his ear and how much he smelled of Old Spice.
psychiatrist. He was only an intern, and I have no idea how he even got the job. But anyway, he was very fascinated at first. He used to talk about him all the time, and sometimes I was concerned, but I didn’t really say anything.”
“Gods, Harry, I love you too.” Draco sobbed, clutching Harry’s hand tighter. Harry smiled softly, and his eyes started to close.
But what if it wasn’t enough? The glass was cracking even faster than before, and Harry guessed that he had roughly a month left before the curse became permanent. If he didn't win Draco over soon, there was no hope for him.
Some time later (Rufus couldn’t tell how long it was) Malfoy stumbled into the room. His red and black bodysuit was half torn off his body, and there were several angry red bite marks and bruises all over him. His eyes had a sort of glazed look in them, even more than Rufus usually noticed in them whenever they encountered. Clearly, he hadn’t even bothered to clean up after his and Potter’s…
To his annoyance, Granger simply laughed. “Anyway, how is your shift schedule? The admin just changed the number of patients I have in a week, and I’m so annoyed! I’ve complained to them and they aren’t even…”
“I’ll be in my room.” He says, the hint of a smirk on his face. Before Harry can comment, though, he turns on his heel is walks away smoothly down the hall.
And at that moment, the last piece of glass on the Mirror of Erised fell to the floor and shattered.
“Yeah. Let me take you there.” They both got up and dusted themselves off. Harry led Draco into the house, which was as impressive on the inside as it was on the outside. There were floating bots, and lots of sleek edges. It was mostly white and pristine, compared to the outside world.
“Harry! Aren’t you going to introduce your roommate to us?” One of the strangers asked. She had short black hair, and she wore a black tube top with black ripped jeans and Doc Martens. She had heavy eyeliner on, and matte black lipstick. All in all, she looked like a very intimidating gothic kind or person.
The interviewer, a quite boisterous man named Seamus Finnegan, laughs loudly, and grips the handle of his chair tightly.
Harry regrets saying that on Seamus’ show. The show had aired only a few days ago, and both his public
Honestly, Harry is rather sexy, he wasn’t going to deny it. But the fact that he's sexy is going to make it hard for Draco to live with him.
With a small burst of green light in the air, the curtains ripped themselves off the wall and fluttered gently to the ground as Draco stormed out of the room, his billowing white robes flying after him.
She groaned and went after him, leaving Harry alone next to one of the numerous wine tables in the room. He grabbed one of the glasses and downed it without a second thought. It was a mix of Dionysus’s signature wine and a hint of nectar, making it sweeter.
was the one who got us into this in the first place, and now-” Harry’s voice cut off as a choked sob wracked through his body. He put his head in his hands, trying to fight back the tears.
The lady instantly tried to backtrack, but Draco pushed past her and stormed out the way she had come in.
“You heard me. You can take him. I’ve given you permission as his father and the head of his family.”
Cedric waved his hand dismissively. “Don’t worry about him; we’re friends. He’s just like that sometimes.”
Soon, other couples joined them on the dance floor. First, it was Ron and Hermione (who had become inseparable the moment they transformed back), then Molly and Arthur and even Fred and George joined them. After a while, almost everybody was on the dance floor.
After spending the evening in Harry’s room talking, one thing led to another and they had soon started making out in Harry’s bed.
“Nice to meet you too, Harry.” He replies smoothly. Harry adores the way he makes an ordinary name like
“Draco?” He looked up to see Cedric looking down at him with a surprised look on his face. Some of his cronies were behind him.
anyone try to kidnap him? And no matter who it was in the Underworld (although he had quite a hulking suspicion on who it was), how
Granger started heading off without him as he lingered in front of Potter’s cell, and her rather loud voice trailed off the farther away she got.
He delicately placed his bare feet on the smooth black floor, wincing as the warmth of it startles him. It was… pleasant, but startling. He cautiously put them on the tiles again, forcing himself to relax. The pulsing heat made him sigh involuntarily.
Because that’s who was waiting for Draco. It only made sense and Draco silently berated himself for not realizing it sooner as he rushed through the darkened hallways. If Harry was the flower sender, it explained why he wanted to befriend Draco. It explained Harry and Pansy’s rendezvous: who else would tell him about old pureblood courtship customs?
) up at Draco when he had finished. He had still not moved away. Forgetting this crucial detail, Draco, whose brain was already severely lacking in oxygen, took in another gulp of Potter and almost fainted.
At the sound of owls swooping into the Great Hall with the mail, Draco searched with bated breath for his mother’s owl and grinned at the sight of the letter clutched in its claws. It was the only form of communication he had with his mother and he hadn’t heard from her in weeks. Secretly he was always scared that someone a little too zealous would choose to exact their revenge against the Malfoys. Salazar knew how many people they had wronged.
Draco was walking through the deserted courtyard, still grinning like an idiot at the flower in his hand, when he heard familiar voices coming from behind a wall. As he drew nearer, the voices became clear enough to place: Pansy and Potter. He went to speak up but the cutting tone of their conversation made him draw up short.
When Draco finally entered his dorm after a day of dodging the Two Who Must Not Be Named (too soon?), he faceplanted bonelessly onto his bed, narrowly missing the delicate hyacinth laid carefully on his sheets. He scrambled up and cradled the flower in his hands.
Draco began making his way up the steps of the tower, steeling himself for what lay ahead. When he reached the top of the shadowed stairs, he paused a final time, reliving the night everything had fallen apart. Then he straightened his back and made his way into the soft moonlight. Immediately, his eyes fell on the silhouette standing by the railing. At the sound of Draco’s footsteps, the figure turned and green met grey.
“No, crushing them will bring the juices out better. Here-” And before Draco could protest, Potter was in his space. The top of his head only came up to Draco’s chin and, like an idiot, Draco inhaled a lungful of Potter’s scent (sunshine and treacle). It was very distracting. It was so distracting, in fact, that Draco didn’t even notice when Potter pulled the silver knife out of his limp fingers and began to press the flat of the blade on top of a bean. Draco watched dumbly as Potter (expertly!?) drained the beans of their juices without a single errant bean flying away hazardously. He was vaguely aware that his jaw had dropped open at some point and noted that Potter’s sudden closeness was not doing any good for the functioning of his brain. Potter set the knife down and grinned (
in Dark Magic because you housed a megalomaniac blood supremacist murderer who fancied killing Muggleborns on your dining room table.”
It was late in the morning when Draco emerged from behind his curtains the next day. Eyes bloodshot and chest ragged, he avoided his roommates’ questioning glances as he pulled himself together. Dreading the confrontation that would inevitably happen as soon as he arrived at the Great Hall, Draco made an effort to take as much time as humanly possible to get ready. By the time he arrived at the Great Hall, most of the students had already left for their classes.
He glanced at the other boy pointedly, “Well, are you going to just stand around like a buffoon, or are you going to actually accomplish something productive?”
He dropped the parchment onto the bed and leapt to his feet. Heart pounding in his ears, he took off running out of the dungeon, ignoring his housemates’ bewilderment. His heart pounded in his ears as he made his way to the place he vowed he would never enter again for anyone or anything.
Draco’s heart sank into his stomach. A joke. This all had to be some kind of cruel joke. Some Gryffindor thought it would be funny if lonely, evil Draco thought someone actually wanted him. Feeling unexpected tears stinging his eyes, Draco tried to push down the hurt and betrayal filling his chest and rushed into his dorm, ignoring everyone in the common room.
Draco couldn’t even work up the spite to send her a sneer. Instead, he said, “Why you presume that my mood has anything to do with Potter or this elusive sender is beyond me. And it wasn’t a date.”
Draco was snapped out of his thoughts by the jingle of the bell signaling customers at the doorway of Scrivenshaft’s. At the register was a short, balding man who didn’t seem to give the two new arrivals a second glance. Draco mentally exhaled a sigh of relief. Maybe he would make it through this trip relatively unscathed. He tugged at Potter’s arm and pulled him toward the back of the shop where he knew his favorite quills were stocked. While Draco browsed the collections of quills, Harry wandered through the shelves poking at various stationery. Draco stifled a snort when Potter narrowly escaped the wrath of a tad bit aggressive inkpot, directing a sheepish smiled at Draco.
“Yes, well even if that is remotely true, I think it’s been good for you. You actually seem like a living human being today.”
into his cauldron, his potion promptly exploded. Fortunately, Draco’d had the foresight to put up the appropriate protective charms—back when he was still a functioning human being, that is—in the unlikely event that something like this would happen.
On the other side of the wall, Draco seethed as the pieces came together. Draco had been so pitiful that Pansy just had to recruit the Golden Boy to
“Am I so pitiful that you had to go behind my back?” Pansy flinched almost imperceptibly, sorrow filling her eyes. “Well, you won’t have to deal with me anymore.” He didn’t wait to see her reaction.
Draco stuffed the flowers into his bag, pivoted on his heel, and hurried away. Draco could vaguely hear the boy shouting after him but his voice was quickly drowned out by the chaos reigning in Draco’s head.
“How do you know all of that off the top of your head?” Potter chuckled. “Some pureblood tradition, I suppose, learning all the meanings of flowers.”
at that and his mouth stretched into (yet another) impossibly wide grin that left Draco’s stomach fluttering confusingly.
Pansy glared at him but it fell weakly. “I’ve left the dorms.” She tsked, dismissively. “It doesn’t matter. Anyway, I’m glad to see you happier.”
Draco raised a single eyebrow in his direction as he continued inspecting quills. “Potter, I think my actions during the past couple of years have made it abundantly clear that bravery is not one of my strong suits. This is all just one big, cruel joke that-”
. Draco had enough time to grab an apple before he left for his first class. Potions. With the Gryffindors. Fantastic.
“Sorry, I’m late. Almost forgot to bring a Snitch.” He flashed the golden ball in his hand and skidded to stop in front of Draco. He glared at him but turned back and mounted his broom. Potter scrambled to follow as Draco kicked off the ground and rose into the air.
“If the shoe fits…” But, Draco had already switched his attention back to his own work, decidedly ignoring the staring he felt coming from his side. He wondered absently how long it would take before the simmering cauldron of never-shuts-up that was Potter would finally boil over.
“Yes. He belongs in the mental asylum, the bugger. Going off about hideous beasts and the Crown Prince himself.” He said with a cruel smirk on his face.
Draco scowled when he caught himself standing and made his way back to his office with quite a lot on his mind.
“That would be nice.” Draco said gratefully, rolling back the sleeves of the jacket so he could actually see his hands again.
“I’m sure Dr. Granger would love to know that you’ve been out of your cell, Mr. Potter.” Well, Draco didn’t have any intention of telling anybody about the incident
,” Draco breathed, pushing back onto Harry’s tongue and making his arse cheeks jiggle. Harry slapped them again and squeezed them tightly for good measure.
had been in charge of the mission to reclaim Earth and the git didn’t even bother to tell him. Needless to say,
Harry grinned into his neck as he nipped sharply. “All the better to pull you back with while I fuck you into the mattress.”
Now, in the year 3264, things were as advanced as ever, with robots now outnumbering humans on the globe. The population of humans was slowly declining, and Draco knew that extinction wasn’t too far off. They had gone from a massive ten billion in 2050 to a meager fifty million now. A couple more centuries and they would be gone.
Draco winced and clutched at his middle. He watched helplessly as the man licked at the stab wound, which somehow closed the skin over it. Once he was done, he turned to Draco.
As the party slowly started to draw to an end, Draco found himself being dragged back to the house by his irate mother.
She shrugged and pushed back her short, lead-colored hair. “I’ve been alright, although I’ve been meaning to come here for a while. It’s been a while since I’ve sold any ambrosia cakes this season.”
With a wave of his hand, the woman fell silent. Harry raised an eyebrow at her. Well, at least there was
Now he was walking briskly in the chilly weather, hugging himself tightly. Their flat was only a five minute walk from Hogwarts, so he decided to just go by foot. Now, he was regretting passing up the option of a warm, toasty car.
“It’s either that or ‘love.’” Apollo smirked. Draco sighed and resisted the urge to rub a hand down his face. It would ruin his look, and he was not re-applying his face cosmetics all over again because of a little flirting.
Thankfully, Zeus got the cue. He winked at Harry and vanished into thin air, leaving his throne behind to disintegrate into small particles of light.
Draco woke up in a soft bed. It took him a moment to realize where he was, and the events of the previous night.
“Here you go, lad!” He turned and saw Mr. Ollivander holding three giant fishes. He gratefully put the fish into his basket.
Draco left the basket in the kitchen and made his way to his parents’ small bedroom. Lying on the large bed was his mother, looking particularly frail and ill.
However, in most of his videos now, people were asking him to duet other TikTokers, especially one in particular.
He continued this for the next hour until he finally finished. Harry’s hair was still a bit tangled, but in a far better shape than it was before.
“I-um-uh,” Draco spluttered, trying to find something to say. He certainly hadn’t anticipated Harry flirting so openly with him.
“Come for me.” Harry whispered into his mouth. With a scream that reverberated around the small room, Draco came.
“I think we should make him suffer for a while, love,” Malfoy grinned. “He’s been annoying me ever since he came in.”
Ten minutes and four multicolored peacocks later, Draco skipped into the house happily. Most of the people in the comments seemed quite amused and laughed out.
Draco Malfoy weaved his way through the market stalls with a large basket in his hand. As he passed by, some people stopped to stare and whisper, but he ignored them. He had more important things on his mind.
Cedric lifted his burning torch higher as he led the horde of angry villagers through the dark forest. Their chants carried loudly through the silence, scaring away all the wood creatures and monsters.
Draco bit his lip and read the note over again. He had no idea how it had gotten into the bathroom, but all he cared about was that Potter actually
He frantically reached for the vial of vanilla oil on the bedside table and grabbed it quickly. He dipped his finger inside and massaged Draco’s winking, red hole.
When the moon started to wane in the slowly-brightening sky, Draco sighed bitterly. It was time to go back already. If he had his way, Draco would choose to remain in the fields for eternity, simply picking flowers and watching the sky fade and morph into bright, beautiful colors. Alas, that wasn’t the case, and he didn’t have a choice in his situation.
Most of the other prostitutes were quiet, which was fine with Draco. He wasn’t one for talking anyways. He knew their names, but that was about it (Hermione, Ron, Pansy, Justin, Blaise and lots of other people he couldn’t bother to think about now.)
Harry smiled and led Draco into the room. He sat Draco down and started to dish out the food- coq au vin with boiled white rice and roasted greens, along with a glass of sparkling rosé.
Harry grins and picks up the next flash card from the small box in front of him. At first, he was a bit reluctant to join the live show, but Seamus is truly an amazing host. Not to mention that answering his fans' questions is actually quite fun, especially the silly ones.
By the time he slipped on his robe, it was already time for the party to start. Of course, he would arrive fashionably late, like he always did. He needed to make sure that there were enough people to witness his grand entrance.
Well, he wasn’t exactly a Death Eater. It was revealed during the Battle of Hogwarts that Draco had actually been a spy for the Order since the Triwizard Tournament, something that even Harry himself hadn’t known. Only Dumbledore and the adults of the Order had known, something that annoyed Harry greatly. Draco had been released of all charges and praised as a war hero, and Harry had no choice but to acknowledge the hardships the blond must have gone through to act as a spy.
*Check out the myths about how Aphrodite created the red rose, and how Astraea was immortalized as a flower and the Virgo constellation.
He sighed and put down his fork onto his plate. “Harry Potter is very interesting, to say the least.”
When Draco woke up, he realized that something was off. For one, he wasn't in the Manor in his mother, but in a strange room that had only a bed, a dresser and a mirror in it. It was large, but sparsely furnished. There were two doors, one of which was open, and Draco could see the toilet and the sink inside it.
Draco sighed to himself as he chewed on his tasteless meal cube. It was cheaper to provide the workers with pure nutrients than to give them actual meals all the time. He didn’t hold any resentment towards the bosses, but he
“If I may ask, why did you decide to come and work here, out of all places? From what I’ve heard, your grades were stellar, and you could have done
Slowly, Harry guided Draco through the steps until Draco only stepped on his toes every once in a while. The music was as soft and melodic as ever, and Draco found that he was actually
“Hello, Harry.” She smiled softly. She looked beautiful, even though she was only wearing a modest chiton, a veil on her auburn hair and brown sandals.
Zeus rolled his eyes. He summoned a small throne, just like Harry had, and sat down on it with a big
Draco and Hermione were in the break room when the alarm sounded, and they had both stared at each other in shock before Hermione sprang into action, locking the doors and closing all the windows. Draco sat in shock before she tapped his arm impatiently.
“Who’s driving?” Draco would have suggested his car, but driving a Ferrari had already caused enough ruckus around the small town. He didn’t want people putting smudges on his new car.
“Where am I?” He wondered to himself quietly. He needed to find his way back quickly so he could find his way home.
However, he started to protest weakly as Harry flipped him over, so he was facing the headboard, and pushed into his sore arse again.
He sighed to himself and placed the glass back on the table. He was already getting tired of staying in the spotlight, even though it had barely been a few hours since he arrived.
“Is that a Ferrari?!” Harry exclaims. He runs towards Draco’s car, and admires it fervently. Draco appreciates that he doesn’t actually touch it. “Holy shit. I wonder who it’s for.”
Draco scrambled upwards and started to run away, but a large hand suddenly grasped his upper arm and yanked him backwards, and into the chariot.
“What do you want Cedric?” He asked, exasperated. Cedric was always running after him and didn’t seem to get the hint that Draco wasn’t interested in him. His ego was probably too big for him to notice.
“I missed you.” Harry whispered into his ear. He gripped Draco’s bare thighs and hoisted him up, making Draco quickly wrap his legs around Harry’s waist.
The Malfoys had been very rich, but when Draco was still a toddler, a great wind had destroyed all their ships, leaving them with almost nothing. Now, with the cargo recovered, they could afford a proper doctor for his mother and afford to live a better life.
horses) rose out of the ground. The only person in it was a large figure, covered completely in black iron armor.
In a trance, he walked into the garden, marveling the beautiful flora and plants. He was so fixated, he didn’t realize his patron standing behind him.
Harry hated the stares that he was getting. He knew that him coming out of the Underworld was very strange, not to talk about the fact that it was for a mere
“Do you recognize me now?” She gleamed, wickedly. With a snap of her fingers, she transformed into the old hag the Prince had seen earlier that day.
He felt another small blush grace his cheeks. Fuck. His first day hadn’t even ended yet, and Harry Potter was already leaving him notes and roses in his office.
“Thank you, sir.” Draco smiled. He paid him quickly, and with a wave, was off to his family’s small cottage on the edge of the town.
?” Draco gave him a murderous glare, but that was ruined completely when Harry reached down to massage Draco’s slightly swollen rim, making even more come leak out of it. He slipped a finger inside, relishing in Draco’s loud moan.
“Why, only you, my dear.” Cedric smiled, sliding a muscular arm around Draco’s slender waist and pulling him close to his chest.
The folded strap of his ivory chiton had slipped off of his shoulder, revealing his pale chest to the world. His long hair was already coming out of the braid he had put it in earlier that day. He had taken off his leather sandals and placed them on the ground to dry when the sun was still high in the mid-afternoon sky (he had gone to explore some nearby ponds a few hours before). His sacred crown, made of interwoven laurel leaves and cloudberry stems, had been thrown haphazardly to the ground beside him – he hated wearing it, but his mother insisted. Despite the fact that he was less than presentable at the moment, Draco had never felt happier.
“It’s your prostate.” Harry smiled as he rubbed down on the spot relentlessly, making Draco quiver and gasp.
Harry could only watch in shock as Draco came up to him and sat on his lap, effectively pushing him away from the paper-ridden desk. Not that Harry minded. His hands automatically came up to grip Draco’s hips tightly.
“Coming right up.” Mr. Ollivander disappeared into his shop to get the fish. As Draco waited, he felt a presence behind him. He turned around and met the broad chest of Cedric Diggory. He groaned.
As he approached the grand doors, he smirked as he sensed several heads turning to watch him in awe. Even though they were all drunk on godly wine, the movement still flattered him. Now, as long as none of them tried any funny business, he would be fine.
Draco’s frown suddenly changed into a sly smirk, momentarily throwing Harry off. His nimble fingers tip-toed their way from the table to Harry’s bearded jaw, playing with the stubble that had grown there over the past few days. Harry bit his lip.
Cho Chang is on a mission to inspect the vitals on the base station on Planet Polus. She meets two strange people there.
“Then you may kiss the groom!” The crowd cheered as Harry cradled Draco’s face and kissed him with all the love in his heart. Draco responded just as eagerly.
“Do you guys have classes now? We could all hang out together. We could invite other people too.” Cormac asked, smiling.
, Harry! You can’t stop me from going to Pansy’s!” Draco yelled at Harry, his usually pale face flushed and red. Harry thought he looked beautiful.
He didn't move as the beast cleaned the blood off of his palms and wrapped his hands in a sterile white bandage, pinning it together with an iron clip.
Potter stepped into the room, and Rufus felt his blood chill. He looked exactly the same as he always did–messy green hair, bloody red grin, purple suit, and trousers–but the way he stared at Rufus made him fear for his life even more.
However, after a few seconds, the black magic sunk into her flesh, with nothing happening after that. The kings, who were waiting in excitement (clearly, Harry’s bloodthirst had rubbed off on them), frowned when nothing happened to the woman.
When Draco stepped out of the room (fully dressed and cleaned up, of course) the first thing he noticed was that Granger was standing not five feet away, crossing her arms and leaning against the wall.
Harry hums quietly to himself as he starts moving his things into his new room. It is a quite pretty room, with a full-body mirror next to a bathroom. The bathroom leads to his roommate’s room on the other side.
So like, I've finally updated. I'm sorry to all of you guys for the long wait, and thank you Marie for reminding me about this.
Harry led Draco up the elevator (it was very fast, compared the ones Draco had been in; it only took a second to get up three floors) and into a spacious room. It had a big white technobed, with white tables and wardrobes and basically white everything.
“Why the hell would I do that? That’s almost as unlikely as your chances of coming out of here alive, Chief. That is, if you keep on asking me these stupid- “
Draco could also see himself in the mirror. He was smiling happily and laughing. He was holding somebody’s hand, but the other half of the mirror was gone so he couldn’t see who it was.
As Potter recounted the story of his childhood, Draco felt the sickening feeling in his stomach become bigger and bigger. When he finally finished, he looked expectantly at Draco.
Draco knew that he should be more worried about how Potter got into his office–and even tell somebody about it–but instead he tucked the note into his pocket and took one last sniff of the rose before leaving his office once again.
Cedric walked up to Draco and tilted his chin up, his grin cruel. His hand slipped into Draco’s pocket and brought out the mirror.
They both watched silently as all of the remaining crew members argued. They finally settled on Pansy as the most likely suspect.
“They can’t stop me now, my love.” Harry murmured to his lover, relishing in the muffled sob it brought out from Draco.
Harry was quiet for a moment. “I think you should, just to see if he really means it.” His tone was odd.
Harry was sucking on his lower lip and slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth and cradling his head carefully and
Great. he had managed to break his ankle and he wasn’t even far yet. He could still see the top of the castle above the trees.
.” Draco gasped. Harry slowly pulled out of him until only the tip remained inside, before pushing in quickly. Draco yelped.
He huffed exasperatedly and stalled his escape if only to rid himself of his extremely determined tail. The boy skidded after him, nearly running him over in his haste to catch up and bent over, panting.
Reaching the potions classroom, Draco slipped into the back of the class where he had taken to hiding, hopefully entering unnoticed. He settled behind the bench, dropping his bag on the floor beside him, and began to prepare his workspace for class. At the sound of a book bag being dropped on the floor, Draco lifted his head to find Potter ungracefully plonking himself down on the seat beside him. He began to extract his quill and books from his bag and casually arrange them on the workbench as if he hadn’t completely lost his mind. Because that was the only reason that could even remotely begin to explain why The-Boy-Who-Lived-To-Annoy had decided it was normal to sit next to Draco in potions.
him. This entire time, Potter was only getting close to him because of his incessant Gryffindor chivalry. Draco had been a fool. He stepped into view as his heart cracked.
And when he finally spoke, Draco knew he wouldn’t have been able to lie if he tried. “Because I wanted you to win.”
“No, I’m reviewing. One can never be too prepared.” Draco intoned solemnly and began to prepare the Sopophorous beans.
, Draco was quickly regretting stopping for whatever this boy wanted to give him. He began to turn on his heel and make his escape while the boy was still (for some reason) catching his breath from his 2-meter sprint when he noticed the brightly colored flowers clutched in one of the boy’s hands. His heart leaped at the sight of them, even while Draco tried to contain his elation.
Pansy sighed. “Fine. He looks like he’s getting better anyway so whatever you’re doing seems to be working.”
Higher and higher, Draco flew, feeling the chilling wind like whips across his cheeks. It had been a long time since he’d been on a broom. Quitting the Quidditch team in 6th year had been agony and his one other time on a broom had been… less than pleasant. Draco grimaced as he remembered the feeling of raging fire at his back. He felt movement to his right and glanced to the side to see that Potter had finally caught up. Staring at his back, Draco flushed as he remembered the way he had clung so pathetically to Potter.
“Who is it that’s got you so happy? Was it Potter on your little date to Hogsmeade or has your secret flower connoisseur struck again?”
“I just-” Harry took another step closer and reached out a hesitant hand. For the first time since entering the tower, Draco noticed that Harry was holding something between his fingers as his hand came into the soft moonlight. A single red rose, petals in full bloom. “I just want you to know, you’re not my charity case. I never meant to hurt you. I just wanted to be with you. Draco, I- I really like you.”
“Had a nice time with Potter?” The question was posed casually enough but it made Draco jerk in surprise and knock over his tea. When he turned to Pansy, he caught the beginnings of a knowing smirk making its way onto her face and eyes glinting with amusement.
He couldn’t understand why. Potter had no obligation to speak to him. But, he seemed to be striking up a one-sided conversation any chance he got and made a habit of inviting Draco on outings into Hogsmeade despite Draco’s baffled refusals. What perplexed him more was that Granger and the Weasel had barely even blinked at Potter’s persistence. Draco had briefly considered the notion that his chattiness was part of some convoluted revenge plot to drive Draco insane, but he admitted that Potter probably had better things to do than think about Draco’s mental state (which was honestly questionable even without additional torment). Besides, he doubted it was a very Gryffindor thing to do.
Wrapped around the stem of the hyacinth was a small piece of parchment. Draco unraveled it with trembling fingers and hope blooming in his chest.
“No need, Potter. I think it’s pretty clear I’ve no desire to be your little charity case.” Draco sneered at Potter’s distraught expression even though he felt like crying. He turned to Pansy who was gazing at him cooly, the red creeping up her neck the only sign of her guilt.
“Alright, we can go warm up at Honeydukes after and get some sweets,” Potter said cheerfully. Draco hummed in agreement as they made their way toward Scrivenshaft’s. As they got closer, Draco grew more nervous. He hadn’t been to Hogsmeade after his sentencing and doubted he would be received warmly. He resolved to avoid Hogs Head where Madame Rosmerta would undoubtedly be. While he had sent an extensive apology letter to her during his time under house arrest and had received a lukewarm but forgiving reply, it was mostly perfunctory and Draco wasn’t quite ready to face those demons in person yet, especially not with Potter in tow.
After the Seekers’ game, Draco felt as though he had been placed under a tracking spell by the sheer number of times Potter had found him in the halls. It was not for lack of trying to hide, but it didn’t matter: Potter seemed to be able to find him anywhere. Soon, Draco resigned himself to his fate. At the moment, Potter had just found Draco sitting in a reclusive alcove of the library that he had discovered at the start of term. Draco sighed and, as he had learned to do, scooted over to make room. Potter eased into the alcove and laid his books on the ground. They sat in the companionable silence that Draco had begun to become accustomed to until Harry spoke up.
“Who told you to give those to me?” Draco leaned forward and took the offered flowers. Now that he was looking a bit closer, he realized that he recognized the boy from the Gryffindor Quidditch tryouts that he’d caught a glimpse of on his way across the field. Potter had spoken highly of his maneuvering on a broom. He’d had his eye on the burgeoning Chaser for some time.
“Please just hear me out first. I want you to know the whole story.” Harry looked at him with those earnest eyes and Draco found himself nodding.
“I hadn’t been on a broom since… the Room of Requirement,” Draco whispered. Potter stayed quiet, waiting. Draco sat up and wrapped his arms around his legs, pulling his knees close to his chest.
As Harry groaned with Draco’s effort, a salacious sound that would have filled the room without the protective charms, there was a rap at the door. Draco instinctively stopped moving, though still grasped Harry’s hair tightly in one hand. Harry clasped a hand over his mouth, both seeming to forget about Draco’s precautions around them.
Their office was dingy and cluttered from work. Harry’s desk sat facing the door and the internal windows, looking out over the constantly busy bullpen; Draco’s desk sat under these internal windows, facing Harry’s, meaning that Harry had to look at Malfoy’s ugly mug all day. One of the walls was full of books, casefiles, paperwork, awards, trinkets, and whatnot; the other blank wall was their evidence board - currently full of conjured red string and all the notes they had on the case they were to start. Malfoy, Harry learned, was very visual, he figured things out through sticking them to the board and staring at them for hours on end. This annoyed Harry to no end, as he preferred to have things all over the place until they fit together and provided an answer. It amused Harry, however, when he learned that Malfoy was just as messy as he was: their office was a harmonised chaos of work.
Evening all! If you're wondering I've had a wonderful day and I hope you have too - the gods know we deserve it at the moment.
A cry of celebration rang out from Draco's right, surprising him, and he turned to look: he didn’t realise that there was quidditch practice today. He recognised the flyer straight away, and took a moment to observe their smooth dives and elegant turns. It was always something truly marvellous to behold, a good broomsman. Without warning, the person flew toward Draco, flying close overhead. Draco watched as the person flew low over the lake, almost skimming the water. His breath left him as he watched the dexterity of the person flying, it left him in thick mists fogging up the cold air in front of him.
Harry chewed his lip – maybe he’d done the wrong thing? “Yes?” he said tentatively, “Only while we’re at Hogwarts, there’s no obligation to move anywhere together permanently” he added quickly.
Neville sighed, “I’ve tried. He won’t listen to any of us - Ron, Hermione, and all the Weasleys have tried to encourage him to stop feeling like he has to hide, but he’s not ready yet, I guess.”
He was pulled from his considerations by Kreacher, who had appeared at the side of his bed. Harry raised an eyebrow at the elf and smiled. Kreacher held a teapot in his hand and put it on Harry’s bedside table.
At the very bottom off the pile, was a golden envelope with Harry’s name on. It shone bright in the candle light, and as he took it into his hands Neville and Hannah came forwards. Harry looked up, confused, but opened the envelope eagerly. It was a letter.
“We do have wands you know, Potter?” He waved his wand and the books put themselves away, even the ones that had been in Harry’s hands.
“Have you even looked at the latest case?” Draco huffed, running a hand through his loose blonde hair - a tell-tale sign of his stress.
“Where the fuck was Malfoy?” Ron's voice was small, “it took me a while to trust that slimy git but he has always protected Harry as partners. Why wasn't he there?” A stifled sob escaped his lips and he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand, he took a deep breath to try and steady himself but the fact that this was Harry - his best friend, brother, partner in crime - could not be ignored. They had grown up together, fought a war together, nearly died together. To think that Harry had nearly died without Ron there made him regret not joining the aurors.
.” Harry tried hard not to lose his temper. The scratching sound of his quill maintained throughout the room, not ceasing as he spoke.
Draco waved his wand and the radio playing Christmas music came flying through to the dining room. It filled the room with cheerful tunes and everybody started to eat. Molly and Harry sat at the ends of the long table, seemingly separated by a never-ending plateau of food. George, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Hannah all sat in the middle of the table, talking amongst themselves and laughing with one another. Kreacher and Draco sat next to Harry, and they sat in a relative silence; appreciating the family that surrounded them. There was no ceremony here – everyone talked and laughed and ate in a pyjama-clad ease.
The classroom hushed, and a few hands went down - it would seem that several people wanted to know. A few students nodded in agreement.
They somehow had stumbled back to the castle, the air between them charged and ready to snap at any second. Harry could barely restrain himself as they tripped their way into the corridors. They had to have a modicum of control – students were milling around now and they had to be ‘normal’. They walked, not touching, through the main corridor and it seemed that within a few minutes they had to actually act as if they were in charge. Students approached them and asked about things, or they had to dish out the discipline to unruly kids.
“It’s not illegal to feel, Mr Malfoy,” She rolled her eyes, “though you should maybe figure out what you’re feeling. It will clarify a few things.”
She shook her head in pity and laughed, “I think you’ll do just fine. Honestly though, how have you not decorated for Christmas yet?”
Phew... I should finally go back to work tomorrow after being off for a while. Hopefully that will mean an update every day again - can't wait to get this all up after writing it for so long! <3
“I wanted to make sure that you were okay,” Draco said sheepishly, “You worried me a bit.” He looked at the floor, not really comfortable with sharing his feelings so openly.
The potions classroom was empty, all except for Draco. He had been hunched over one of the work desks for hours and hours, surrounded by books and vials of ingredients. A cauldron bubbled to his left, and he had a recipe scribbled on a piece of parchment to his right. He jotted corrections on it, time and time again until he was finally happy with his design. He had tried the concoction for himself the day before, and he was pleasantly surprised with the results. He stirred the potion, and a cloud of deep purple steamed from the cauldron. The potion inside was a purple, silvery colour and he theorised that it was damn near perfect. He summoned a box of single dose vials, and began to fill them with his creation. He smiled with satisfaction as he put the now full vials into the box and wrapped it in a dark green bow. A wave of nervousness hit him – was this the right thing to do? Was this too much? He shook it off and put his nervousness down to the fact that this would be the biggest, most personal gesture he’d ever done for someone.
A grin spread across Neville’s face as he nodded. Everyone burst into clapping and congratulations for them both. Harry hugged Neville tightly, a big grin on his face, and then took Hannah in a warm embrace.
An awkward smile saw its way up to Draco’s lips, “What?” he asked, not entirely sure what Harry had said. He didn’t know what to think.
Draco heard Potter moving around in the other room and moved swiftly away from the bookcase, thinking that he wouldn’t appreciate him snooping around. He lifted the big kettle over the fire and pulled the tea set out. Draco smiled to himself; these teacups had been used a lot recently. Harry came into the office, still in his pyjamas.
Harry smiled, “You know what I mean,” He glanced at the door, “Do you… er, do you want a pot of tea?”
“What’s going on?” Harry asked and moved to an armchair that was closer to them. Ron turned to look at Harry, his mouth slightly open in shock.
Harry understood, it had been pure bliss living at Grimmauld Place with Draco. He initially thought that having Draco around all the time would be too much for him after living on his own for so long but it had felt so natural and easy to be with him. Harry squeezed Draco’s hand tighter. They passed the rest of the walk up to the castle in silence, appreciating the winter weather and each other’s company.
“I try to stay out of things now,” Harry said, extending a hand as a peace offering between the two, “but I’m glad to see that you’re here to keep me in check.”
He sighed and shrugged, “Not good,” he looked back over the dancefloor, it was still fun, but many people had paired off and left together, “you know, I want my money back,” he laughed, and the bartender laughed with him.
Harry held Draco close for a moment or two, his energy spent for the time being. Draco whispered in his ear, his breath tickling Harry’s neck, “Was that okay?”
Hey all! So I wrote a sequel... I added it as a chapter because I honestly see myself probably writing more and getting carried away like I usually do xD If you want more, as always, leave a comment and I'll oblige <3
Evening folks! I've had a shit of a day at work so there'll be two chapters up today... got to get it out of my system you know? This one is short and sweet and the next one is... well. Something.
Draco looked behind him, and Harry had indeed shown up. She must have invited him to join them. He wondered just how awkward this would be as he hadn’t spoken to Harry and had actively avoided him.
The only quidditch pitches that Harry had been to were the Hogwarts pitch, and the World Cup. Though the World Cup had been tinged with death eatery madness in his memory. He didn't know what to expect of a smaller league pitch, would it be as well kept? Is it smaller in size? He was excited to find out, and slowly his nerves turned to rippling anticipation and he found himself relaxing.
“I guess I got sick of people coming up to me all the time,” Harry’s voice broke slightly, betraying his emotions, “It sounds awful, but I just wanted everything to quieten down but I can’t even go for a casual drink unless its in a muggle bar. Every now and again I’ll bump into a witch or wizard that knows who I am and I feel so suffocated. I never wanted any of this,” Harry turned to look at Malfoy who was listening quietly, he seemed genuinely concerned, as if the mask had slipped for a second or two, “you know, I don’t really do anything anymore. I couldn’t tell you the last time I went to Diagon Alley and looked at brooms, or wondered around Flourish and Blotts. I get Kreacher to do a lot of stuff for me, or I just don’t do it at all.”
She led Ron by the arm and sat on a chair in the corridor. Ron had gone incredibly quiet, and Hermione knew that this was how his worry manifested itself, “he's got to be okay, ‘mione. He just has to be,” he whispered, “I couldn't take it if we lost him.”
Harry looked at himself, and saw that he had little splashes of paint on him, “Erm,” he smiled, “I’m redecorating.” He admired his handiwork on the front door – it was half green, half red.
Draco sat in Pansy’s living room, his feet perched on a plush leather footstool, “I really can’t believe that he didn’t just mock me. He’s been in a weird mood all day, Pans.”
Harry read it, his eyes growing wider with every sentence read, and eventually he turned to look his two friends. Everyone watched him with anticipation. Arthur, Ron and George leaned forwards on the settee, waiting to hear what it was.
The new potions master, it would seem, had had some kind of obligation to see to and so could not make it for the first feast of the year. It was assured, however, that they would be arriving soon.
Hermione turned to Harry and Draco, “Did you have a good Christmas?” she asked them. She stroked Ron’s messy ginger hair and cuddled into him.
Harry ran a hand through his wild hair as best he could, then noticed that his quill had been dripping ink all over a student’s essay. He looked around to make sure that nobody had seen him in a world of his own, then cleaned it off with a wave of his wand. He cleared his throat then carried on marking the work.
Students milled around the castle, lounging comfortably on benches, or playing gobstones on the floor. A group of fourth years poured over a
Harry stood up, and greeted Ron and Neville with an embrace, clapping them both loudly on their backs as he did. Ron looked a little worse for wear, and Neville seemed to be well on his way to being drunk. Ron grinned widely at Harry and took a seat in the booth. Harry had to guide Neville into a seat, and even then, Neville couldn’t quite balance on his own, he leaned onto Harry’s shoulder for stability and Ron laughed.
Harry hadn’t even thought that he would not want ‘Malfoy’ hanging around him. It tended to have negative connotations these days, “Of course, sorry… Draco.”
Nancy raised an eyebrow and dipped her hand into the pocket on her apron, “A letter came for you today from the Ministry. I was going to forward it on to you at Hogwarts, but as you’re here I may as well give it to you now.” She handed Draco the letter and went back down the stairs, sighing as she went.
Draco looked from Harry to the key, then to the door of the maisonette they were stood in front of, then back to Harry, “Are you asking me to move in with you?” he said in disbelief.
Harry’s stomach knotted, the adrenaline had worn off a bit and he wasn’t entirely sure what was going to happen. Harry stood awkwardly as Draco closed the curtains, lit the burner and charmed his candles around the place. He swung off his cloak in a single flourish and stood in the middle of the candles, looking at Harry.
“That’s a heavy question, Potter.” Draco mumbled, he wasn’t sure that he wanted to have this conversation with Harry, but it would seem that he didn’t have a choice.
He flicked his wand at a textbook and it opened to the right page, “Right, read up on the unforgivable curses, and then I’ll do a demonstration.” He sat behind his desk and watched the class working. The red teacup sat to his right, and as he looked at it the pattern parted:
Draco laughed darkly into Harry’s neck, withdrew his fingers and lined himself up with Harry’s entrance, “I know I’m sexy but there’s no need to call me God, Harry.”
“Is that where you learned to be such a useless, annoying part, then Potter? Being with all those Ravenclaws?” Malfoy asked, a smirk playing on his lips. Harry wasn’t in the mood; he’d had too much to drink and he wanted to go home. He was tired and worn out, and didn’t want to be reminded of the past - it was far too difficult for him to think about, even these years later.
Draco looked up, “Why?” he asked, his icy eyes burning fiercely. There was an edge to Draco’s voice that lead Harry to believe that Draco was, in fact, jealous; whether he wanted to admit it or not.
Draco folded the letter in and envelope and sighed – he had nothing to lose by asking for Grangers help.
He wrapped himself up in his robes, took a deep breath and walked through to the Courtyard. He hoped that Draco would not take too long. His breath escaped him in small clouds of mist, it was freezing outside, he pulled his cloak tighter around him and buried his mouth into his scarf. He exhaled to warm himself up and tried to relax a bit. He sat reading the book that Hermione had bought him for Christmas – and as much as he didn’t necessarily want to admit it, he was finding it very interesting.
The kettle whistled, and Draco poured the tea with a wave of his wand. Harry pulled a cup towards him and cradled it in his hands, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder, grateful for the friend he had found in an old enemy.
“Have you finished?” Harry nodded to the cup of tea and nearly extinguished cigarette, hoping that he wasn’t about to be kicked out, despite the earlier implications. The whole situation felt surreal, but calming, and he didn’t want to return to the chaos that was Harry Potter’s hectic life just yet.
Hermione put a consoling arm around Ron, her worry tangible on her tear soaked face, “can someone please explain to us what's happening?” she tried her hardest to maintain her composure, but it was beginning to crack. Her mind, like Ron's, was taken back to the battle of Hogwarts, and seeing Harry dead in front of her.
Harry nodded, wide eyed, “Where have these letters turned up?” he asked. He sipped his coffee, mildly intrigued with the case - he could see why Draco had been so eager to start, it seemed like a paper trail kind of case and he knew how much that would appeal to Malfoy.
“That’s what Hermione said,” Harry smiled at the idea that Draco and Hermione could have anything in common, “she also said to give it time.” He sipped his tea – even this was far more upmarket than anything Harry had.
“You broke into Gringotts?” A Ravenclaw pondered quietly to herself, Harry was sure that she meant to do it under her breath. He shot her a mischievous smile and nodded.
to kill Voldemort,” Harry’s eyes shot up, “You were not meant to have a normal life but nobody told you that. Of course that’s going to leave something behind.”
Harry was shocked. While he and Malfoy were on talking terms, he had not expected to have him as friendly company any time soon.
There seemed to be a unanimous agreement that that is what they wanted. The classroom seemed to be excited once more.
“Draco,” he shouted across to him, “I’m glad you could make it!” He pointed to the ground as a way of telling him to meet him there. Harry flew down to the ground, where the Quidditch chest was waiting to be opened. Draco joined him.
Harry, with no warning to Draco, planted a kiss on Draco’s lips and held him tightly, uncaring that everyone could see. Neville, Molly, and Hannah laughed loudly, George threw a cushion at them as the kiss deepened, and Arthur clapped his hands.
“Malfoy, that’s ridiculous,” Harry went to stand next to Malfoy, and looked down at the letters, a closer look showed that there was indeed very little that the spells had revealed, “Wait…” Harry thought aloud, “What?”
Harry approached him, and put his hand on Draco’s shoulder, “They are good people. They’re not going to hold you to account for your actions twelve years ago when you’ve been through so much yourself. They understand, Draco.”
“Aurors aren't always put on emergency duty together,” Hermione replied, “he probably wasn't rota’d,” she reasoned, knowing as well as Ron that Draco would lay his life down for Harry if needed. She ran her hand soothingly across Ron's shoulder, trying to provide comfort but not succeeding, she too was scared beyond reason for Harry. Much like Ron, Hermione was reminded of the hard times in the war, and also the fact that Harry wasn't indestructible; the boy-who-lived, maybe, but not the man-who-can’t-die.
Draco climbed on top of Harry, straddling him without a care in the world. Harry couldn’t help but watch as Malofy began to grind down on him, sending sparks through his entire body. Draco smiled, then leaned down to kiss Harry as he rode him.
Someone tapped Harry on the shoulder as he thought about how to make social conversation with Draco, and so he turned to face them: it was the blonde dancer. When he approached, Harry became certain that he was part Veela, there was an aura around him that was mesmerising even when he wasn’t dancing.
He fingered the expensive wool blanket that covered him and looked toward the window, past his plush curtains and rare, antique furniture. The sky was a cold shade of blue and threatened rain - those were Draco's favourite kind of days. He got out of bed, pulling on his soft leather slippers, and walked over to the small burner he had in his room to warm his hands.
in his own. He found himself running his thumb along Malfoys skin, just to get used to this new feeling. Harry flinched slightly when Malfoy did it back.
Draco silenced him with a stern look. Pansy’s expression matched that of Blaise, and Harry picked up on something uncommunicated between the two, like they knew something they shouldn’t - perhaps they teased Draco on a regular basis about ‘paradise’.
Harry woke up terrified. Again. He’d been at the Burrow with an army of death eaters swarming around him and his family – the Weasleys. He could hear Mrs Weasley crying so vividly in his mind, and he hated the sound. He wanted to hold her, tell her that everything was okay now – he was here to help. He noticed something holding him. Something was trying to soothe him. He mustered up the courage to open his eyes and was confronted with a dark mark in his face. He stood up in a flash, his wand automatically at the ready in front of him, ready to fight - as always.
They hadn’t been fully qualified Aurors for long, they were still getting used to being the ones making decisions and being responsible for things. They had been partnered together because of their performances during their training, and it was not a decision that they had really become comfortable with yet, even after a few months of working together. Harry, at first, had been so annoyed that they were tied with being the youngest Aurors ever, but now he found it amusing - they were absolutely clueless sometimes, other times, they were an amazing team despite their dislike for each other. Malfoy was clearly taking the situation worse than Harry was, he would often get agitated when Harry seemed to be more in control, calmer than he was. It wasn’t unheard of for Malfoy to have brief moments of what could maybe be described as panic. Luckily for Malfoy, Harry had become unusually responsible and level headed after the war, perhaps he had grown up quickly after all.
He remembered to breathe. Harry hadn’t told him that he was seeing anyone. Was this why he had suddenly been too busy to see Draco? Why did he
Draco watched Harry intently. Harry pressed his wand to the red cup, and within just a moment, the words that he thought faded onto the green cup, the pattern parting elegantly:
Harry picked up the other box, and opened it. Draco put the red cup down, and being more attracted to anything green, he picked up the cup meant for him. He examined it closely again and made another comment about the quality. Harry pulled out his wand, and Hermione looked on with an excited grin on her face.
” he muttered and picked up the paperwork, ordered it, and put it in the outbox on the wall. It disappeared with a quiet whooshing sound, straight to the records office.
“Now,” Harry said softly, “compose yourself, because we’ve got presents to open and then we have a whole lot of Treacle Tart to eat.” He added with a chuckle.
Harry chuckled softly, and smirked at the thought of Malfoy being so damn wise. He nodded and carried on drinking his tea, “Is everything sorted now? Can everything go back to how it was?” he asked.
“We’ve been discussing the Essence of Tranquillity, and what should be done with it,” Hermione beamed, as Harry pulled a chair up to the table, “and we were just about to catch up.”
“It’s been the best Christmas I could have asked for,” Harry said, “I’ve had all the people I love under one roof.”
He held his hand out, “Come on then,” Harry took it and followed him. Ever since they had had a long conversation one night about their blunders at the Yule Ball, and how much easier it would have been if they’d just gone together, their friendship had a lot fewer boundaries. They often danced together at clubs, until Harry found someone to pair off with, or until Ron wanted to go home. They had become very comfortable just expressing their admiration and platonic affection for each other, and they had no real qualms about any of it. It had been awkward at first, especially for Harry whose upbringing hadn’t exactly been full of expressed feelings and relaxed sentiments, but now they were closer friends than ever before.
Blaise looked down at Neville as he said this, “I’m sober,” he stated, “I’ll apparate you home and I’ll come back as quick as I can,” he and Neville stood up, though Blaise supported most of Neville's weight, “Pans, will you take over while I sort him out please?” he asked.
He disliked how much simpler the game was when one wasn’t dodging Bludgers and violent players to contend with. He heard Harry shouting below him. He turned to look at him, and saw him stood with his hand in the air. The bastard had caught it. Draco sighed to himself because their ‘game’ had gone quickly, but was ultimately still happy.
Draco looked at Harry from under his lashes and licked his lips slightly, “What do you want to do after this?” he asked, his voice still low.
“Alright Neville,” he nodded towards him, “Can I just have a butterbeer please? How’re you doing Potter?” he smiled down at Harry and raised an eyebrow.
Harry looked slyly at him, “No hard feelings, Malfoy, but I’m not going easy on you.” He smirked, and Draco felt the butterflies return slightly.
“Yeah, that’s the one,” Harry stumbled next to Draco, putting more weight on the wizard than he expected to, “How are you not as drunk as I am?”
Draco matched Harry’s smile, remembering how long it had been since he’d played, “Absolutely,” he enunciated, “Shall we say that we’ll meet on the pitch at one?”
Harry shrugged, “I imagine there’s someone out there willing to put up with you.” He smiled and started to laugh.
Potter had calmed somewhat upon Dracos entering the room. His screaming had stopped, but he sobbed. Draco suspected that he was waking up. He quietly set the kettle above the fire and summoned the tea set to him, ready to be filled.
“Morning,” he sighed, “I didn’t expect you to still be here.” He leaned against the archway and crossed his arms over his chest.
The sound of students filing out of classes could be heard in the corridor past the classroom, and Malfoy checked the clock on the wall. It seemed they still had some time to chat.
It had been some time since Harry had last seen Malfoy, and he was expecting things to be difficult. He had always said that he understood why Malfoy did the things he did, and was instrumental in making sure that Malfoy did not receive punishment for his actions, knowing full well that he was just as much of a victim as anyone else. Not that Malfoy knew that, of course.
Draco loitered in the hallway, pacing back and forth with his hands over his eyes. Harry stood near the door, not wanting to crowd Draco. He realised that he was crying, and Harry felt a pang of guilt – perhaps this had been too much for Draco to get used to. The sounds of laughter and music was still audible from the living room and Harry cursed himself for putting Draco in this position.
When he got back to his room after saying goodbye to Harry, he took a draught of peace to alleviate his symptoms.
They had barely landed at Draco’s flat before they were all over each other again, only now, Harry was more confident. This, he could do. This, he had done a million times before. He pushed Draco back until he fell onto the sofa, and lunged at him with a practiced hunger, a need that drove him, compelled him to take over.
Harry nodded his response, head still in his hands, taking slow purposeful breaths to calm his nerves. The old Elf had learned to deal with Harrys nightmares over the years. Harry stood, slowly, and followed Kreacher downstairs. As they walked, Kreacher waved his hands at the fireplaces and a warm orange glow filled the rich halls of the house as they shuffled towards the Kitchen.
“I, erm…” Draco hesitated, he wasn’t great at saying some things, “I’m sorry for the other morning.”
I hope you enjoy this instalment of what was once a oneshot xD Nothing explicit happens in this chapter, which I know is shocking, but I promise there will be more to come <3
All of a sudden, it was like Harry’s body had never danced before in his life. He just stood there, the weight of what was happening prevented him from moving. Draco, however, was practiced in the art of getting a reaction from Harry. He pulled him closer, his hand on the small of Harry's back, and began to move to the music that was playing.
The feast was mostly done, students and teachers alike had started to turn in for the night. As Harry and Draco turned to leave, Headmistress McGonagall turned to them with that reproving look that she used to cast down at Harry when he was a student. Her arms crossed over her chest and she had a slight smirk.
Harry pulled the dark green bow off with ease and inspected one of the silver/purple vials inside. He held it up to the light and watched it shimmer, “What is it?” he asked again.
Harry nodded, his face flushing and an excited smile breaching his face. He had missed Draco terribly over the Christmas break and he just couldn’t wait to see him again.
“I’m sorry, dear, it was a bit rushed,” Molly admitted, “I only found out that you and Harry were together yesterday,” she shot a glance at Ron who grinned sheepishly at her, “but it should fit all the same.”
Draco got up from the bed and walked, naked, to the burner. Harry admired the view as Draco put the small kettle on the top and warmed his hands. His pale skin looked warm and appealing in the orange glow of the candles and fire from the burner. Harry pulled himself off the bed and sighed: they would have to go out into the world for the rest of the afternoon. Draco stretched, and turned to smile at Harry, putting his arm around his shoulders in the process. He pulled Harry closer, and held him for a moment.
‘You must be thinking too loud then, prick. I can hear the cogs turning from here’, Draco thought to himself. Harry was still not the shiniest cauldron in the set but somehow, he got results.
Harry grew hungry for Draco’s touch; their moments separation felt like an eternity to Harry. He took Draco’s hands and pushed them onto the pillows. Draco broke the kiss, and looked at Harry with a flirty smile. His eyes were full of desire and it sent shivers all over Harry’s body. He pushed harder onto Draco’s hands and sat on top of him, straddling Draco’s long body.
The students filed out, one by one, and Draco looked around the room. They had been brewing Wiggenweld Potion, in preparation for their next class, and the classroom was quite a mess. Draco turned to his desk at the front of the room and made notes on his students' potions, his back to the door. Without warning, the classroom began to clean, despite no incantation being uttered. Draco whirled around, looking for whoever had done that.
As per your requests, here is another chapter :D I really appreciate all of your feedback, y'all are amazing <3
Harry rolled his eyes, “I literally didn’t say anything…” he snapped back, “I’m just doing paperwork.” Harry threw the casefile back at Malfoy and carried on doing the paperwork for their last case, working under the thin light of a lamp; the only source of illumination near Harry’s desk.
Draco chuckled, and moved closer to Harry. He let himself pull Harry close and graze his neck with his lips, “I must be formidable indeed,” he kissed his neck slowly and felt Harry wind his arms around Draco's waist, “To make
Harry chuckled softly, “Yeah something like that,” he put the now empty cup on the bedside table, “How are you feeling?”
They sat in silence for a while, and it was surprisingly not awkward. Harry was finding himself pleasantly surprised at how Malfoy had matured personality wise.
Harry heard Draco take a deep breath as Molly stood up. She looked at Draco and strode over to him. Draco braced himself for a tirade of abuse or a firm talking to. Instead, Molly wrapped her arms around him and held him tightly. Draco reciprocated and looked at Harry slightly surprised. When Molly released him, she planted a kiss on his cheek, “Welcome to the family, Draco.” She said and turned to go and sit down again.
He handed one to Harry, who already had his hands around a cup of tea, cradling it like it was the elixir of life.
“Yeah, the potion thing. That was good of him, it’s quite good to see you two getting on.” Neville dried some glasses and put them away. Harry thought it was odd seeing him work here when he was so used to seeing him in the greenhouses or milling around the grounds.
Harry protested, “Really, you don’t need to help me clean the entire house. Kreacher is more than capable and he’s working on it as we speak.”
Harry sat, shocked at what was being revealed to him, on Draco’s chaise longue, as Draco poured his heart out. The fire crackled intensely and Draco had charmed candles to float around the room as he often did. The heavy plush velvet curtains were drawn over the window and the rich furnishings were decadent but comfortable. Harry felt at home in this room – as extravagant and gothic as it was. He focused on the room for a moment and made sure that he was paying proper attention to Draco for his face was twisted into a painful expression and his hands wrung in front of him.
He heard someone coming up the stairs and was confronted by his faithful shop keeper, Nancy, “Oh,” she said, “it’s you. Why aren’t you at the school?” She asked. Draco looked at her and smiled briefly, she had clearly had a busy day. Her sleeves were rolled up to her elbows, her hair had hastily been tied up and she looked exhausted.
Pansy rolled her eyes, and Blaise laughed, “Mate you’ve been single for as long as I can remember,” he grinned widely, “You need
Malfoy began to chuckle, his throaty laugh again in Harry’s ear. He pulled Harry even closer, sliding his thigh between Harry's legs, holding him firm on his hips, “something you like?”
“However, I can make tea in my office?” Harry offered, wondering if simple tea would be good enough for someone like Malfoy.
Draco nodded, and flicked the cigarette end over the balcony wall, where it disappeared in a small flash. Wizarding cigarettes, Harry smiled to himself, designed to always vanish when discarded.
Harry shook his head. He didn’t like the tone that she took with him – was he in trouble? He hadn’t been in trouble for that long that he couldn’t really remember what it felt like.
Draco glided through the dense crowd of people, up to the dancer, and placed a few sickles on the stage with a wink. The elegance and grace that Malfoy handled himself with irritated Harry. Had it been anyone else that moved that way, he would have found it endearing, but on Draco he found it arrogant, self-aggrandising - the result of having an aristocratic upbringing. Harry watched as Draco flashed the dancer a sultry smile and felt a stab of something - anger, perhaps. He took a sip of his drink and cast his gaze down to the floor.
Draco nodded, “I think it will be our own little slice of heaven,” he said, “I’ll pack my things and meet you back here?” he asked, and turned to face Harry, who still held him around the waist.
wearing his favourite outfit, that was true, and he knew that he looked good. His wild, curly hair was pulled back at the nape of his neck, his stubble was now a short beard, and he wore a dark red, three-piece, velvet suit with a black shirt. His shoulder holster for his wand was firmly fixed underneath and even though he had felt ridiculous with it at first - he happened to now feel naked without it. Draco continued to really look at him and a satisfied smile settled onto his face. Harry tried to not to react to this but he must have done a bad job because Draco turned his head quickly away. Harry smirked.

Neville passed him another drink and he clinked glasses with Harry. Neville was still smirking, probably at his efforts with Hannah that morning. Harry turned to look at the door and in came Draco.
He turned to Harry, “Now…” he sighed, “where were we?” He cupped his hands around Harry’s face and kissed him deeply. Harry smiled under the kisses and brought his arms around Draco. The tender kisses soon turned into a frenzy, and before they knew it, they were under the duvet.
Afternoon! The final chapter is upon us :( I really appreciate all of your support and feedback throughout this fic, it has been wonderful and y'all are amazing <3
Hey Hey.... regrettably we are nearing the end of our journey together :( It's been a hoot and a half, and as I've mentioned before I do have another Drarry fic on the back burner that I'll hopefully finish xD
Ron nodded, “Oh yeah, it was so different. We all had one common room,” he plucked an olive from a bowl on the tray and popped it into his mouth, “There was only about 15 of us, so they shoved us all together. We - Harry and I - shared a dormitory with a bunch of Ravenclaws. It was so much fun.” He elbowed Harry, who had been staring at his drink, not doing anything.
Harry laid there stark naked, his mind blank with post-orgasmic bliss, waiting for his breathing to go back to normal. To say that that was much needed would have been an understatement. He glanced over to Draco, who had fallen beside him, and smiled to himself. He had been expecting something spectacular but that was something else entirely. He basked in the silence for a minute or two, listening to the whoosh of his heartbeat in his ears and the breathing of the naked man next to him and waited for the usual wash of fatigue to come over him.
Sunday came and Harry woke up early. He’d had yet another peaceful night’s sleep thanks to Draco’s Essence of Tranquillity. He really relished the well-rested feeling that he had in a morning now, and was grateful for having a friend in Draco. The settee was still at the end of his bed, he had been too lazy to move it back to his office. He glanced at it and remembered a drunk Draco smiling at Harry as he decided to sleep there. He laid awake in bed, blankets pulled up to his chest, reading a copy of the Daily Prophet. There was little of interest in the papers these days but it made for something to do on a Sunday morning. Harry considered Draco’s comments from the night before and relived them.
It was raining outside, so Draco cast an Impervious Charm across them both, and they walked contentedly through the grounds of Hogwarts. The leaves had almost completely fallen off the trees now, they piled up on the sides of the pathway, lining the way for him and Potter. The rain made the grounds seem impossibly serene, and empty, Draco was sure that he’d never seen the grounds so bare in his life. They walked, through this serenity, towards Hogsmeade.
Harry took the drink and looked up at Draco, his eyes were full of concern and guilt. Harry wished that he hadn’t reacted like that, but was grateful that Draco had been there. He nodded at Draco, “Yeah, I’m alright. I’m just exhausted.”
The dancer blushed, “Alexandre.” he replied, and seemed to come across quite shy as Harry turned his full attention to him. Harry could tell that the man was only attracted to him for his fame, but that didn’t stop Harry from being attracted to him. Alexandre dropped his head, gazing coyly toward the floor.
“Alright mate?” Ron said, pulling Harry into a tight hug. Hermione watched them with a smile and then pulled Harry into yet another hug. She took her coat and scarf off and hung them on the rail. Ron had already thrown his jacket on the stairs and draped his scarf over the bannister.
“Harry?” He said quietly, and knelt at the side of his bed, not wanting to startle Potter, but needing to wake him up, “Harry, come on, it’s alright.” He put his hand on Potters shoulder, and his eyes burst open. Full of tears and fear, he stared at Draco, his green eyes wide with shock at seeing him in his room. He took a moment to calm his breathing and then slumped back onto his sweat soaked pillow with a sigh. His breathing steadied, and Draco kept his distance for a bit. Harry eventually wiped his face with his sleeve and sat up in his bed.
Draco nodded and Harry took his hand from Draco’s shoulder. He checked the time, “We’ve got time for breakfast, do you want to eat in the Hall today, Potter?”
“Oh… Oh, Draco,” he panted, and Draco pulled harder on his wild hair, “Oh Draco, don’t you dare stop.” He looked at Draco over his shoulder the best he could and forbid him to stop with his eyes.
Harry finished the painting on the door and smiled at his handiwork – it wasn’t too bad. He cast a drying spell over it and went inside. His hands were red from the cold so he held them over the fire.
He did not tell them of the nightmares that he still had, or of the emotional scars that his life had left on him.
Harry sat behind his desk again, and wrote a quick memo to Hermione asking her to swing by. The paper memo flew off with a flourish, and Malfoy glared at Harry from across the room. A knock at the door startled Malfoy. It was Auror Anderson and he was holding a letter.
Harry frowned, “Malfoy, I’ve not worn glasses in ages,” Ron looked at Harry, clearly amused that it took Draco so long to realise, “I stopped wearing them in like, September.”
They went through the courtyard, down into the corridor and then to a part of the castle that Draco had never seen before. Draco looked at Harry questioningly.
Harry interrupted him before he could carry on, “Merlin, shut up Ron.” He ditched his glass on the table and stormed off.
Harry’s spirits lifted when he saw them, and realised that inviting them over might spur conversation on, though the timing was curious - had Malfoy perhaps invited them? Ron and Neville approached, as did Blaise and Pansy.
She stood outside her office, talking to Ursula – one of Harry’s sixth year students. Harry assumed that this must be something about her and so he waited his turn.
“Erm, no. He couldn’t make it.” Harry replied. Kreacher came through with tea on a tray and then shuffled around the house lighting fires and cleaning the odd thing.
“We’re going to get it properly tested by the Ministry, then if everything goes through okay we decided that the best thing to do would be to let St Mungo’s and the Ministry do with it what they wish.” Hermione explained. Harry smiled, there was a hint of pride in his eyes. Potter was about to say something when Draco got up, walked to the counter and ordered a drink.
“Crush them.” Draco looked up to find Potter staring intently at Draco’s knife hovering over the squirming beans.
After a lengthy period of silence, Potter seemed to have remembered their previous subject matter and asked, “So… someone’s trying to say hello, then?”
Suddenly, Potter spun and zoomed in Draco’s direction. Bewildered, Draco swiveled his head searching for the Snitch until he spotted it hovering near the stands. Draco whipped his broom into motion and sped off like a fiend, eyes locked onto the glinting gold in the distance. From the corner of his eye, he could tell Potter was gaining on him.
Even Draco had to admit Potter had grown into his scrawny build and untamable hair, but since when did he think of Potter as anything other than annoying. It really didn’t help matters when Potter was looking at him so earnestly through long, sooty eyelashes and gorgeous emerald... When Potter’s expression began to morph into one of inquiry, Draco realized he had been quiet for too long. He opened his mouth to protest and hopefully send the confusing boy back to his usual place beside Weasley, but suddenly Slughorn signaled for the class to settle down and began the lesson.
It was Saturday by the time Draco realized he had made a huge mistake. The day after his flower revelation, he had sought out Potter and agreed to a trip to Hogsmeade. Potter’s obvious shock was quickly replaced with glee as he told Draco to meet him by the entrance. So now Draco was shivering in the cold, bundled in three layers of robes and winter garments, waiting for one perpetually tardy Potter. Just as he decided to go on without him, he turned to see a harried (heh) Potter stumbling down the path, Griffindor scarf whipping in the wind and hair hidden by an obnoxiously red knit cap.
Harry didn’t even flinch. “Yes, well, it’s hard to break away from the world and ideas you’ve been taught to believe your whole life.”
Draco was silent for some moments, debating whether or not he should tell Potter the truth,  before replying, “I don’t know. I found them in my bag.”
“I mean, I didn’t like you before because you were a massive git- no you can’t deny that. But I could see you were trying. And I was furious that you were just taking all those attacks from the other students quietly. So, I started following you to throw off a jinx or counter a hex. I wanted to get closer, but I just didn’t know how. You were pretty clear you wouldn’t welcome my attempts at friendship, forget anything more.” Draco’s heart skittered at that.
Three months into the term, Draco decided he had close to mastered the art of avoiding Tripping Jinxes. Not that they were very cleverly placed or particularly effective, but it was getting annoying having to heal the bruises Draco acquired in the process of becoming thoroughly acquainted with Hogwarts’ cold stone floors. He had learned to attune himself to the quiet snickers that preceded some bitter third year’s attempt at revenge. Draco didn’t deny that he deserved them but Malfoys were NOT doormats… at least not anymore.
“Brilliant! I’ll see you on the pitch. 6 o’clock.” After that, Potter stayed true to his word and thankfully didn’t try to bother Draco again for the rest of the class, blissfully unaware of Draco’s inner turmoil.
Draco spluttered and took a bite of his toast to avoid having to respond while Pansy tittered beside him. As he turned his attention away from her, his gaze inevitably landed on the Gryffindor table. Potter was with his Golden Trio, as usual, talking about some inane subject, as usual, when he caught Draco’s eyes. He gave a small smile and a wave. Heart leaping in his chest, Draco responded with a nod. Next to Potter, Weasely inexplicably directed a knowing grin in his direction. Draco turned away slightly discomfited and utterly confused.
"C’mon, Malfoy, I'm not asking you to marry me. And you live in Shadwell, so I know you know about Muggle bars and restaurants. We'd go to one of those, not because I'd be hiding that we were out together, but because who wants the press hounding them on a first date? I wouldn't take anyone to a restaurant in the Wizarding district with me, not until we were actually in a relationship." Harry breathed. He hoped.
Draco sat up straighter. “You saw the ring?,” he asked sharply. “You received a letter that wasn’t for you, about a ring you hadn’t bought, and instead of just letting them know they made a mistake, you asked to see the bloody ring?” He was getting angry.
“Couldn’t sleep,” he answered as he stubbed his cigarette out in the ashtray on the floor next to the bed. He rolled over to face her, leaned his forehead against hers, stroked his hand up and down her side.
Harry shrugged as best he could with two large cups of coffee in his hands. “Wanted to see if I could still get in.”
