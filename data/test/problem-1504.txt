The hall went silent as everyone waited to hear her answer. She shrugged and answered, “magic.” The hall roared in laughter.
The smile returned but it seemed more awkward than before. Luna patted her hand and told her, “After dinner we can come back and check it out. I appreciate the thought. I’m hungry.” She led her down to the Great Hall for dinner.
I love her.
“Agreed,” Adrian said. He looked her in the eye and said, “go on to bed, let us worry about this for now.”
He said, “I would like that. None of my family know I’m here. We weren’t allowed to talk to anyone outside of work before the tournament. We were supposed to leave today but that isn’t going to happen.”
It was quite the dilemma. Ginny had gained back enough confidence to say that if it was her then she would take whoever she wanted and not care what anyone thought. Luna and Arlene were different. Luna was already ostracized for her quirks and beliefs. Arlene fell into the same boat because they spent so much time together. Being found as gay on top of that would unleash the assholes on Hogwarts on them. There was only so much she could do to fight them off.
The next morning Arlene woke up to Adrian putting his shoes on. It only took her a second to remember they were in Egypt. She sat up and he said, “good morning. We’ll be leaving soon. I’ve already brushed my teeth so the bathroom is all yours.” She stretched and began the process of getting ready. When she was finished they left the hotel room.
The last three hours had been focused on mass producing sleeping potion. The standard cauldron was half a gallon. She needed two gallons. She had to make the potion four times and get it right every time.
Arlene reached a hand out for a scepter. Pain shot from the roots of her hair. Her head was jerked back as someone pulled on her hair. Anger filled her as she turned and saw Rusu trying to pull her back. The Durmstrang girl snarled at her, “I won’t you steal my victory.”
“What?” It was so sudden it confused her. “I don’t know how,” was all she could say.
Luna told her, “I agree with her. Their thinking is clearly been warped by wrackspurts.” She shook her head as if it was a tragedy.
She nodded. What he had said was true but it didn’t kill her motivation. “I’ll find out sooner or later. There has to be something out there.”
She smiled back and said, “well, if they’re dead already and it’s just the father’s name then I guess it can’t hurt.” She went back for a few seconds. She came back and told him, “we only had one Tom Riddle with a muggle father by the name of the same name. Tom Riddle sr.”
“Tom Riddle sr.” Adrian kept acting tired as if he had been busy over the last few days. He would never be good enough for the films but he could convince the average person.
Luna nodded and said, “I want to dance with you. That will make me happy.” Arlene took a deep breath and lead her down to the Great Hall where the champions were meeting up.
She nodded. “After the last two years I was expecting something quiet this year. It shouldn’t effect either of us at all. Neither of us are even old enough to get in.” She grabbed Luna’s hand under the table. “I’ve got my treasure already. Not to mention more money than I could ever spend.”
The fire was slowly dying, the coals and last few flames only giving off a small heat. He needed that heat. The dungeons were easily the coldest place in the school. He would get sick without the extra heat.
After they talked with the kids they had both gone to his bedroom and gotten drunk. They figured might as well start easing the stress off now before they had to be sober to deal with whatever crap this tournament threw at them. In the privacy of his room they weren’t worried about being bad influences or getting caught. As long as no students found out then it wasn’t a problem.
About a week later the third years and above gathered in the courtyard for the trip down to Hogsmeade. Arlene had for the first time in her life had trouble choosing what to wear. This is not a problem she had. Arlene Connery did not ever have trouble choosing what to wear. She grabbed what she wanted and didn’t care who didn’t like it.
The necklace was made from a simple string that had been looped though the caps of Butterbeer bottles. A hole had been drilled in each cap with the string going into it. It was such a simple gift that actually spoke a lot about them. Obviously, Luna paid attention to her. Most people who knew her also knew that she liked Butterbeer. It was also sweet that it was homemade. Luna had done all this herself. Spending obnoxious amounts of money on someone was one thing but putting something together and crafting it from spare parts was something entirely different.
He smiled at her as he said, “your guardian, Adrian, was a big help with rounding up the death eaters.” A jolt ran through her heart and it must’ve shown. He raised a hand and reassured her, “He’s fine. He should be on his way here soon.”
Hermione suggested, “We could try a sleeping charm on it? It’ll take a while to work on a dragon but it is something.”
Arlene threw her arms out in disbelief and said, “all the Gryffindors have to do is remember a password? They don’t need to figure out a riddle just to get to bed?” She set her arms down and shook her head. “Why Rowena? Why do you hate your students?”
Joan stood up as Hagrid sat down, “I’m going to be fully honest and say this is a terrible idea. The Triwizard tournament was cancelled for a reason. Several actually. It is too much of a risk to the students. Not to mention that with all the excitement of the past few years it might be better if we had a normal school year to settle things down.”
She laughed and commented, “that last one is actually a good idea. I’ll do that.” She hesitated for a moment before saying, “I’ve never had someone to call a mom. I never got the chance to know my real mom. No one has ever shown me what one could be. Until I met you.” Arlene took Joan’s hand. “I know you’re not the motherly type but you’ve been the closest thing I’ve had to a mom.”
She received various forms of positive assurance that the house elves were fine. A large boar was wheeled out. Dobby was there to explain, “the boar has a charm that will keep it fresh until the night after the second trial.” Arlene proceeded to pour all her sleeping potions in the mouth. As the house elves sew it shut she realized just how big it was. The hog was bigger than she was. Would it be too big for the dragon? She brushed the idea away. She had no time left to worry. The trial was tomorrow. This was the only plan she had. It was this or nothing.
He stopped her by asking, “Miss Connery, do you anything about Legilimency?”
Arlene told them, “we don’t know the location. The only thing I can think of in the air to hurt it with is an oxygen explosion. That will have no control and could light half the audience on fire. Not to mention the dragon will be so fire resistant that it will only make it angry.” She leaned against the desk and said, “unless I get lucky like with the first trial and just stumble on some good elements to use.”
Joan blinked in surprise and responded, “Adrian Barnes was able to read a girl. Stop the presses.” The she furrowed her brows at him and went on, “that has to be the worst pick up line I’ve ever heard.” She smacked the door frame and said, “you know what a real pick up line is? Hey, want to have sex?”
She fell to the ground begging, “please, I’m too young to die. I’ll do anything.”
refences to bullying within this chapter.
A second that time didn’t move in held her. Then she threw herself into his chest. He held her as she sobbed, “yes, please. Please call me that. I’ll call you dad.”
Bastion was still in reach of the beast as it lunged towards him. He ran as fast as he could but he just wasn’t fast enough. He turned to cast a spell at the dragon but didn’t get the chance. The dragon’s jaws closed on his leg.
After picking up a steak, Luna told her, “I haven’t seen anything about tonight.” They both started eating at a normal pace while they could. Just a few bites in though and screams rent the air. Bangs and flashes came from the direction Adrian had gone. This was followed by gunfire.
Another helping thing was while on the way to the library she ran into Fred and George. She was walking down the hallway when the two of them swooped from nowhere and greeted her in unison, “hello Arlene.”
Life at Hogwarts had changed. Life in general had changed. After the night that Ron Weasley died the world would never be the same.
She slapped a hand to the table making Arlene flinch. “That’s the thing. I can’t find anything on it. Not a single reference to house elves in Hogwarts, A History.”
“NO!” three voices cried out at once.
They were both bigger on the inside.
A snake the size of the basilisk that was made entirely of fire slithered by. One death eater was crushed in its jaws while another was trapped between it and a mausoleum. Both were dead quickly.
After Arlen and Luna finished their food Joan said to them, “we have to leave soon. Luna your father really wants to see you. We’ve reassured him that you’re fine but I’m sure he wants to see you.”
How could she marry James Potter of all people? His tormentor for years.
Ginny backed her up, “she’s right. Most boys are just walking around staring at the girls they want to ask.” He nodded in agreement. His face lightened up some. Ginny didn’t think that bad of Neville. He wasn’t the most handsome or the best talker but he was a good person at heart. Really he wasn’t ugly either. “Neville, you want to go to the ball with me instead?” Wait, what?
Normally he didn’t dream much. Tonight he did and they started strange and got weirder as the night went on. He was dreaming of a home in a field. The only thing around was two children playing in the dirt in front of the house. He walked toward them and scolded, “get out of the dirt you’ll get dirty.”
“That tells me you enjoyed it,” Joan reassured him. They held each other for a while. Adrian napped for an hour then they got up and got dressed. It was almost noon now. They went to the Great Hall for lunch. Professor McGonagall commented to him, “I didn’t see you at breakfast.”
Adrian sat back down on his spot in the stadium. There was one more champion to face their dragon. He couldn’t get him mind off what had just happened. Arlene had somehow shown dominance over the dragon and convinced it to give up the golden egg. Of all the weird and strange things he had seen in his time that was strangest. He couldn’t rationalize it no matter what angle he thought about it from.
Instead Harry talked to him. “When my parents died I was forced to live with my aunt and uncle. Some of the worst people to ever exist. I spent most of my young life being ignored in favor of my cousin. I lived under a staircase in a cupboard. He got two bedrooms. As soon as I was old enough I was cooking most of the food. He was eating most of it. They hated me and for eleven years I didn’t even know why. For so long I was afraid to just be alive in the house I lived in. Then Hagrid came to my house and brought me to Hogwarts. I thought the nightmare was finally over.” Harry’s fists clenched with anger. “Then that…fucking Dumbledore made me go back. After everything I did for him. He just sent me back to be starved, beaten and hurt more. He spouted some bullshit about blood protection.”
She spat back, “you won’t have to overwork your brain to beat me then huh?”
Her face lit up and her hands went to her mouth. Not even that could hide her smile though. Then a thought occurred to her. Arlene asked, “Luna, did you know my answer?”
Adrian couldn’t deny them this. James and Lily had been their friends after all. He set the vial back down and said, “alright but humor me about the remote location. Please. I’ll tell you when I find a good location.”
The gate in front of Arlene opened so suddenly she didn’t know what to do at first. Then she just started running forward. The dirt was unstable and shifted around. She stumbled but did not fall down.
“About one to two hours I think. Don’t travel by broom much. Won’t be much longer than that. We’ll stop for a break if we need to.” He seemed calm about the whole thing.
Ginny wanted her friends to be happy and not have to hide who they were. She thought anyone who hated gays were full of it and should be shunned away. Not the other way around. Her spoon tapping wasn’t to fill the silence, it was out of restless anger.
“Ha!” Adrian clapped his hands together and cheered, “I figured this one out! It’s a picture! She shot a picture of him, held it underwater in a dark room and hung it up. Then they had dinner.” He crossed his arms with a smug look on his face. “Normally I suck at riddles. I figured this one out easily though.”
Warning for light gore in this chapter.
Her body trembled, she couldn’t stop herself from falling to her hands and knees. She had just performed a ridiculously difficult act of magic. Two pairs of arms lifter her up. Ron and Harry were at her sides helping her to stand up. Ron asked, “blimey, how did you do that?”
Arlene scanned the table and saw that she was right. There was an empty chair where the Defense against the dark arts professor sat. Arlene frowned. “You’re right. What if they couldn’t find anyone?” She couldn’t take the class but she still wanted it to be available for Luna and Ginny.
He scowled and snatched Ginny’s pastry away. He walked away and took a bite from it. A bang went off and it exploded in his face. The plate fell and shattered to the floor as he squealed in surprise. He ran out of the Great Hall.
All he knew was that he had failed. A student had died while under his protection.
“What?” Severus said. The wind picked up. Leaves blew through the forest. He felt himself being pushed away.
Ginny pov.
He shrugged and suggested, “her office? I think she had some tests to grade.”
“You’re welcome,” he responded, “now get some sleep.”
The next day at breakfast Hermione came over to them holding an opened purple envelope. She told them, “this is a letter from the ministry.”
Arlene Pov
Skeeter fumbled for her wand but he easily disarmed her. He walked to her as he said, “I thought you’d be smarter than this Rita. After all I’m a psychotic baby killer aren’t I?” He shot ropes the photographer to keep him out of the way. “I mean according to you I murdered my own wife and daughter.” He raised his wand at her. His voice dropped to a growl. “How did you word it? A crazed animal that needs to be locked up? A monster?” Tears were running down her face now. He pressed the wand into her neck and told her, “Rita, you wanted a monster so bad, you got one right in front of you.”
She knocked on the door to his office. There was silence. She was about to walk away when she felt something brush against her consciousness. It was hard to describe what she was feeling but it felt like someone was trying to get inside her mind. In reflex she pushed against it and it went away. She also heard a crash inside the office. After a few seconds she heard, “come in.”
She held onto him as they apparated away. After a few seconds of the unpleasant experience they reappeared in a bright, dry, and hot environment. The sun blinded her for a second. Her eyes adjusted but she still had to squint. Something plastic tapped her hand. She looked down to see a pair of sunglasses being handed to her. “I should’ve given you these before we left. I apologize for that.”
Arlene Pov.
This was the normal testing. The homework had been to combine a flower with an inorganic material to make it nearly indestructible without detracting from the qualities of a flower. Everyone had passed but at least one of the tests had effected it in some way. Until Arlene’s that was.
Adrian didn’t hear Arlene scream in terror. He didn’t hear Harry’s cry of anguish. He didn’t hear Remus calling for them to retreat. Adrian only heard the voices in his head telling him one word, “kill, kill, kill.”
They went back to the castle and to the common room. Luna had to ask to let them in. The knocker had been giving Arlene hard riddles all year so far and she didn’t feel like thinking too hard on it now. It was still early in the day. Most of the second and first years were on the grounds outside or in the library studying. They enjoyed the little time alone they could before going to bed early. Just sitting and talking with each other. They were both happy and content. Their lives were good.
Snape lowered his wand and snarled, “put your arms down. How dare you? I thought you were a noble member of the Malfoy household. Not some kind of…Potter lover.” He crossed his arms. His tone turned condescending. “I could tolerate you being gay. To think you went and fell in love with Potter. So distasteful.”
Aaaaand book 3 is done. If you enjoyed it then please leave a kudos, maybe leave a comment saying what was liked and what was hated. I accept constructive criticism.
Arlene realized the how monumental the task ahead was. “There’s going to be a ton of families named Connery from Ireland.” Knowing that staving it off would get them nowhere, she and Adrian got started.
She went on with the story, “we did what we could to slow down the fires. The ministry came in and told us we had to leave. They pretty much forced us to go to the hospital.” She gestured to her friend, “he spent most of the time there insisting he was fine until one of the healers put him to sleep. The he woke up and tried to drink Phoenix tears.”
Harry found his chest and sat on the chair by it. He tried to calm his nerves as he put on his gear. There were fingerless gloves, leather bracers, leather shin guards, and a leather cap with a string to tie it on your head. It all seemed pathetically frail against a dragon.
Sirius interrupted him, “alright, that I see a correlation with. He did look more snake-like.” He shook his head. “I don’t see how this helps us try to get answers out of him.”
In this moment Joan Winters understood how Adrian felt when Arlene got chosen by the goblet. She knew because she was going to commit a crime when she got to Skeeter. If all she saw was a monster then that’s what she’ll get. There was no way she was going to let that bitch near her daughter.
He held up a finger, “I’m getting there.” He turned toward the back of the book. Before he started reading he said, “if he was using Horcruxes then this details how to restore the physical form.” Then he began to read, “one of his minions we captured detailed to us the means of his resurrection. After many hours of torment he relented that bone of a parent, blood of the enemy, and flesh of the servant were aspects needed to restore the Horcrux user to full power.” He stopped reading. “There are smaller details but those are the major points.”
The explosion spell takes a heavy toll on the user’s magical reserve. The fifth time Adrian cast it the spell failed and he fell to his knees. He felt a hand on his shoulder then a second later he was whisked away by a portkey.
Joan met with Arlene down the corridor and away from the crowd. The two of them ducked into a different classroom. Joan closed the door behind them. They pulled two chairs out and sat in them. Arlene asked, “Joan, since I can’t use my wand what am I supposed to do about the first task. I’ll fail it sure but what if I’m in danger? What if someone else is in danger? I can’t risk exposing my magic but I can’t just not act in a situation like that.”
Jules Bastion would live. Thanks to the excellent work of Madam Pomfrey he would also retain the full use of his leg. It had been reattached with no complications. Madam Pomfrey had worked through the night to make it happen. After all the other patients had been stabilized she went to scream at Dumbledore.
Arlene tried to explain, “no, I can pay for it. I have enough money. I have more than enough.” I could probably buy the company that made them. She didn’t want to say that and brag too much.
He stayed far away from any boats and dropped near to the surface of the ocean. They were a few meters from the surface before he leveled out and cast the invisibility spell on them. Then they approached the city from the ocean.
The fire changed purple. A smoldering scrap of parchment shot out. He snatched it from the air and read out, “the first champion from Beauxbatons is Fleur Delacour.” All the students in blue robes clapped and cheered as a blonde girl stood up. She approached the headmaster and shook his hand. He directed her to the backroom where the champions would wait for further instruction.
Ron slapped his hands to the desk and said, “Hagrid, he wants to raise one he has to know how to calm it or something.” He looked at their expressions of doubt. They all knew Hagrid wanted a dragon but they didn’t think he would know how to calm one. It was better than anything they had found yet. He tried to explain, “I think we should at least try it. Rather than do nothing.”
He stepped out and pointed his wand at the death eaters. He cast the explosion spell. Then he did it again. And again.
Harry got the most vicious one. The Hungarian Horntail. He looked at his card with his heart beating fast. Of course he got the worst one.
George held a hand out to Harry and said, “now you promised. Didn’t he Freddie?” Harry handed him a small stack of Galleons. He stood up straighter and said, “pleasure doing business with you.” Him and George left the room and closed the door after them.
They glanced at each other. Fred told his twin, “she’s clever. More clever than we give her credit for.”
After she finished with her classes she headed for her dormitories and got out her books. In the hours of searching she had found three books from the billions in the Library of Alexandria. These three were the only ones that held any mention of her family history. This was from either the table of contents or the index as they did not have time to actually even skim through all the books that held information on families named Connery from Ireland.
Hagrid sat at a table by himself. Until Arlene and Luna came and remedied that. They walked up to the table and Luna asked, “Hagrid, do you mind if we sit with you?”
Ginny asked, “when did you learn to dance?”
I just need to say that I mean no offense to anyone by writing this chapter. If I did something wrong or offensive by accident please let me know so I can fix it. As always I am open to feedback and constructive criticism.
“Mr. Weasley did I hear you right? I thought I heard you say nesting mother dragons?” Adrian was growing more nervous about this scenario by the second. Grubbly-Plank and Joan arrived by them.
Harry’s tear filled eyes stared at him in confusion. Joan pushed him off Harry and ran over to Arlene. She gently lifted her to her feet and escorted her out of the area. Joan asked her, “Arlene, if you can tell me what happened then I might be able to help. I’ll understand if you can’t talk about it.”
Seconds later ministry workers levitated a stretcher through the tent. Krum lay on it with his face clenched in a grimace of pain. He held his egg in the crook of his arm. His left leg had three massive gashes in it.
All over the pages about wars between goblins and wizards lay black ink covering entire paragraphs at a time. Over half of the history was hidden. She had a strong feeling that it was her history hidden. Of course sloppy work like this could be done with Professor Binns because he wouldn’t notice if Hogwarts exploded.
She went to the backroom and saw the other champions there. The room was mostly empty now. In the Great Hall she could hear another speech being made but not the words. A fireplace was blazing away on the other side of the room. The other champions were milling about. Harry and Ron were talking. They seemed oddly calm. Harry even laughed about something.
She looked behind her to see the other monster following her. She still had the other half of her magnesium. She threw it with her magically strengthened arm and followed it with a jet of blue flames. The bundle of ribbons bounced off the troll’s face and ignited. Arlene turned just in time to avoid being blinded.
He responded with a wave, “you’re welcome. Meet me in the entrance hall.” He walked away as the door swung shut.
They reached the hut to find Professor Grubbly-Plank in front of it. She appeared to be blocking the way almost. She stared them down, focusing on the boys with her glare, until they reached the hut. She lashed out at them, “go away. We are on busy ministry business right now.”
Arlene snarled and swiped her wand hand at her but used her own magic to disturb the dirt under her. She fell and slid down the slope further than Arlene had. She crawled up the slope and was able to stand up. As she left she yelled back, “clumsy yourself!”
He aimed his wand at the snake who retreated to the other side of the room in a carefree manner. He walked to see if anything was in the chair then inhaled sharply when he did see what was in it.
She still held one of her hands. “That was incredible,” Arlene breathed.
The clerk nodded and asked, “does this friend have a name?”
Arlene smiled in a calm manner as she told him, “we’re friends. We spend a lot of time together.”
He cocked his head to the side in confusion then understanding dawned on his face. “Oh,” he said then a smile showed. Arlene knew that he wasn’t going to hate her for her preferences. “The rules don’t say anything about that. It is legal in the magical community.” He put a hand to his chest. “I have nothing against it.” He lowered his hand and leaned forward. “I’ll support you but I can’t guarantee others will. Give it some thought. It is a bold statement in times like this.” He sat back and said, “I wish it wasn’t like this. I don’t want others to hate you over something that you can’t choose but it is the world we live in for the time being.”
Skeeter huffed and began walking out while saying, “this is ridiculous. Dumbledore is of course to blame for this whole disaster. I can’t believe you would look to blame an innocent reporter.” She smirked at Joan, “perhaps you’re just looking for an outlet for all your crazy. Since you can’t kill children for fun anymore.”
He sprinted to Bastion. He lay on the ground awake and screaming in pain. Adrian pointed his wand at the leg to stop the bleeding. His stomach turned when he saw the leg was severed at the knee.
Arlene got up and told them all, “thank you for having my back. I helps so much knowing that I have people backing me up on this.” She waved and said, “goodnight everyone.” They waved back at her as she left.
What she was asking her to do didn’t make any sense. The mind couldn’t extend or enter another. It was a construct within the brain. Then again most magic didn’t make sense. She closed her eyes and focused on herself. She let out a breath and her mind exploded out.
At that moment Victor Krum ran by and said, “excuse me, have either of you Hermione Granger.” Except he mispronounced Hermione’s name. He was still close enough for them to know what he meant.
Ginny began to mutter under her breath. Luna leaned over and whispered, “in the next few minutes.”
He went straight to the help desk for the department of orphanage affairs. He hit another lucky strike. The girl working today always liked flirting with him. If he smiled and stayed polite and he could get almost any record he could want.
Luna pointed to her book and said, “the dragon will recover too fast for two wizards to overcome it. No matter how many stunning spells you throw at it. It would take at least five or six to bring it down.” She gave Harry a nod of the head. “Nice idea though.”
It dawned on Arlene what she did mean: sex. She flinched and explained with a fake giggle, “ah, I’m not quite ready for that. I mean I don’t even know how to do that with a girl.” Her face burned with embarrassment. She could feel it glowing red with her blush. “uh, maybe we should just go back to the dorms. I don’t feel like going to the room of requirement now.” She took Luna’s hands in her own. “Not that I’m upset at you.”
It was in the moment that he realized that he couldn’t keep Lily all to himself. Then he immediately rejected that idea. She belonged to him. She was supposed to be his.
Hermione interrupted her, “I wasn’t planning to hit that hard just yet.” She sighed. “That adds a strong argument to our side. I’ll stand by that.”
She asked, “will there be anything in the maze?”
He moved the bag over to Fleur who got a Chinese fireball.
I'm dropping this one a day early because I won't be able to do it tomorrow. Next week's schedule should be better than this week's.
She was down with the crowd now waiting for Luna to show up. She ended up wearing jeans and a bright blue shirt with a thin, dark jacket over it. A chill had entered the air in the last week. A sign of the coming of fall.
“How?” Sirius was confused on the idea.
Adrian, Sirius, and Remus stood at Tom Riddle Sr.’s grave. They had just finished performing the final checks on the cage and the ritual. Sirius said, “we’re ready to do it. The moon is full. It’s now or never.”
She had gone pale and her breathing increased. After what they had just witnessed neither Bastion nor Arlene blamed her for being scared. Still she put on a brave face and went out.
He smiled back at her sweetly. “No, I guess not. I have a lot of room for improvement still.” She got an idea and sat on his hips. He raised his hands and pleaded, “a few more minutes. I need a little rest down there.”
Some of the meaner students would look at them as if they wanted to say something. The moment they saw Luna burning letters they looked away, usually with frightened looks on their faces.
If she meant so much to him why did he join the cult trying to kill her kind?
She smiled and said, “thank you.” They went up to the dormitories and went to bed.
“Just hoping I don’t get injured this year,” he said in a tired voice. “First year here I got almost bit in half and loaded with poison. Second year I got stabbed twice and fell over two hundred meters. I was hoping this year would be normal. Or at least I wouldn’t get injured.”
Then the second champion for Hogwarts was Ronald Weasley.
The book went on to cover more history that she knew. She read on through things that she knew already. Then she came on something new:
Mr. Crouch tested her wand and confirmed what she said. He was able to tell them, “she did as she said. This was recent. Recent enough to have been done on the walk over here. I don’t have the ability to tell if a spell was performed before that.” He gave her an empty look and commented, “how very lucky for you.”
He nodded. All he had to do was make it past this trial then Ron had a straight shot to the top. All he knew was that it had something to do with dragons. Other than that he didn’t know what to do.
“Like Hell you are.” Sirius wasn’t having any of it. He told him, “this is who killed our friends. We want answers. We can fight too. We knew it was dangerous.”
The professor’s eyes narrowed but he didn’t immediately question it. Seconds passed like hours. His face relaxed for a second then it twisted into rage. “WHY HIM?”
Mr. Bagman snatched up Harry and shook him roughly as he barked in his face, “what the hell happened?”
He didn’t stop brushing his teeth. He had already thought on this over the summer and knew his answer. He spat out some foam and said, “it’s been thirteen years almost and I finally realized I need to grow up and move on. My family would want me to be happy.” He brushed some more and spat into the sink. “I guess part of that is getting into a relationship. I’m still young enough to date.” He rinsed his mouth out and put down his brush. “Are you asking because you want to be in a relationship with me?”
Arlene was completely convinced that she was going to have to use her unique magic just to get out of it alive. They were all in the library whispering ideas to each other.
Ginny sat at the Gryffindor table with Luna across from her. She tapped the table with a spoon as she listened to Luna whisper to her about the problem of the Yule ball. She wanted to go with Arlene but didn’t want the homophobes of Hogwarts to target them.
They had just left dinner. Ginny looked at her funny while Luna tried to make her feel better, “you don’t know that. You just have a bad feeling about it.”
She ran forward towards the scepters. The troll was too blind to even notice. Lee was screaming, “Connery made a flare from a rock! She’s blinded the troll! What a genius! The other troll is on her now!”
Double doors set into the side of the Great Hall led into it. All through the day decorations were being added to the hall. The doors to the ballroom remained closed.
Lee yelled, “Delacour takes the lead!”
Arlene pov.
He slapped his desk and spat, “I didn’t push her away.” He realized he was talking to an empty room.
The world around them stayed beautiful and serene. The sun setting over the mountains. Birds gliding into the forests to return to their nests. Under the surface of the lake the giant squid swam lazily around. The world around them kept going, devoid of the notion that something beautiful had occurred between two young boys growing into men. The world carried on as normal. Except for those two. For them everything had become more wonderful and beautiful than ever before.
She took one from the tin. “Thank you again Professor.” She left the office and was left to ponder her decision.
Tears flowed from his eyes again. He went to bed. Unhappy with how his train of thought had went. He still hadn’t put another log on the fire.
He drew his wand and moved towards the house. It probably didn’t concern him. If someone had seen him at the grave then he wanted to know who it was. Besides the house was supposed to be abandoned.
He tapped her on the shoulder and told her, “he’s calling for someone to help us. He said we can take a seat here.” He pointed to some benches that gave an excellent view of the library. “He also said my Arabic isn’t too bad for an Englishman.” He seemed a little smug over that.
The stranger grabbed his arm and insisted, “this isn’t a joke. We need everyone in the ministry we can get.” He glanced at the children before leaning in a whispering in a quieter tone, “the minister is considering this an act of terrorism.”
Bastion’s face paled in fear. Ministry workers sprinted past them to get to the stadium. They could hear more screams of horror from the stadium and the barking of orders between wizards. Then another round of fresh screams along with the faint yelling of a man in pain. It wasn’t Krum’s voice.
Luna smiled and said, “I agree. It would be nice to have a normal year for once.” A loud bang sounded off in the distance. “They really are enjoying those fireworks.”
Ginny’s eyebrows raised. Then she whispered, “like romantic love? Or just like a friend love?”
She felt another pair of arms grab her and pale blonde hair fell on her. Luna had joined the group hug. Arlene said, “I’m glad you two are safe. I heard you ended up in the hospital.”
They showed up just in time to hear Charlie say, “you heard right. I don’t know why but they wanted nesting mothers.”
He shook his head and responded, “I need to get my family to safety. My department has nothing to do with this incident.” He carried on walking.
He opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out. He managed to say, “I just asked Hermione to the ball but she said no. She said she had someone to go with already. I understand that but it is a little upsetting.”
That night she and Luna talked it over. They never reached a conclusion. They loved each other and wanted to go together. The idea of seeing two girls dancing together might be too much for some of the more narrow minded students and staff. The idea of taking a stand was bold but to actually do it was dangerous.
“No,” he shook his head, “you don’t need to do that. It’s my gift.” His mouth hung open slightly as if he was appalled at the idea of making someone pay for something he offered.
His hands tightened. She heard his voice crack as he told her, “thank you. Thank you, my daughter.”
Arlene asked, “do you know where mom is?”
As always, i mean no offense so if i did something offensive please let me know so i can fix it.
The sun was out. Just enough cloud cover to keep it from being uncomfortable. Not a rain cloud in sight. Birds flew and chirped in the air. The world around them had cooled just enough for someone who wasn’t nervous to be comfortable. A gentle breeze pushed small ripples across the surface of the lake. As they neared it a single tentacle from the giant squid could be seen as it dived.
Ginny still didn’t know why she had asked him to go to the ball with her. It had just popped out of her mouth. It had been a surprise to both of them. They had ended up going together. She didn’t expect much to happen that night. She didn’t expect to have much of a good time.
As cheers went up his hearing faded. There was no way he heard that right. His heart fell to one of his feet. He watched her stand up. A strong sense of disappointment and heartbreak filled him. Then she said to the whole hall, “but I didn’t put my name in. I don’t want to be a champion.”
Three days later she got a letter saying that their article would be in the next print of the Quibbler.
She let go of Ginny only for Luna to pull her into another rib breaking hug. Ginny gasped but hugged her back. When Ginny was released she sucked in some air then told them, “I have something important to talk to you guys about. We need somewhere private.”
PAGE BREAK
Arlene rolled her eyes and asked, “okay, so what else did your visions show you?”
The two seconds that Harry took to look at his friends’ shrugs stretched on for an eternity. They all shared a glance. Their expressions and shrugs told him they didn’t mind. This did little to ease his nerves. Harry said, “sure.” He stood up.
Joan’s Pov.
She answered, “as much as I can.” She grabbed some pudding. If she was going to get hurt tomorrow then she wanted to enjoy some food before then. Her nerves did get in the way of that though. She tried her best to eat but she only got halfway through her plate before giving up.
Luna responded, “That was my first kiss. I’m glad I could give it to you.”
She was following him with her head. He came up with a plan. He heavily feigned to one side then dove to the other. The dragon fell for it. She went to one side then had to change direction mid-attack. Harry was lighter and faster. He swooped around her back. She followed him leaving her eggs exposed for a second. He finished his circle and dived at the eggs. He snatched up the golden one without stopping and sped away as fast as he could.
Professor Moody arrived and glared at the students. He said, “I know you’ve got a lot of detention already. You want me to take these two?”
She stopped when both Ginny and Luna grabbed her. Ginny told her, “Arlene. Your power is freaking out.”
The door opened but Arlene felt she might’ve gone too far. A hand gripped one of hers. She glanced over to see Luna was holding her hand. She reassured her, “don’t worry, I’ll help you get into the tower.” In that moment she looked really beautiful.
It would be better if no one had been the betrayer though. Better if she was alive. Why didn’t she just move aside to let the Dark Lord murder that baby? She was more important than him. Didn’t she realize how much she meant to him?
He could only nod and faced the entrance to the stadium. Professor Dumbledore put a comforting hand on his shoulder and said, “good luck Harry. Head on out.”
He was still trying to wrap his head around what she was saying but he couldn’t deny that she had made valid points. He faced her and said, “so just to clear it up. We’re dating after this? Boyfriend and girlfriend?”
Luna had to go join Ginny in the stands. Between the seats and the entrance to the maze stood a massive glass pane. Arlene knew this is where the maze would be displayed along with their locations. This would add some excitement to what would’ve been a terrible spectator event. Despite that Arlene didn’t see watching this as being very exciting. This was done for the parents of the champions who had been invited to show up.
The hospital wing was flooded with staff and ministry workers then. Three more stretchers came in with Charlie holding his arm but standing. Four had been injured when the dragon’s tail raked the front row. None of them were as bad as Bastion so Madam Pomfrey focused on him.
Before that could happen Luna and Ginny found her and Luna said, “we should visit Hagrid.” They agreed and made their way to his hut. The day was hot as summer had made its way to the area. Not a cloud could be seen in the sky.
The knocker seemed almost smug as it asked, “I have no houses but I have cities. I have no trees but I have mountains. I have no fish but I have water. What am I?”
A week before the final task Ginny brought a flyer to them in the corridor after class. Arlene and Luna had been heading to the library but Ginny stopped them with the flyer she had brought. She handed it to Arlene while telling her, “are you interested?”
The doors slammed shut after her and chatter returned to the room. Arlene picked up her spoon from where she dropped it on the plate. She resumed eating her lunch as Luna commented, “I like her. She has the right idea.”
Adrian took cover as the spot he had been standing in was filled with hostile spells. A hand touched him. He swung his wand towards whoever touched him to find himself looking at Arlene and Ron. He put his wand down and said, “I told you to get out of here! What are you two doing?”
“Yeah, me too.” She didn’t add anything else to that.
Then it was time. He had on his gear. He had his wand. He had a plan. He took two deep breaths and walked towards the curtain. He pushed it aside and walked the last twenty feet into the stadium.
McGonagall sputtered indignantly and asked, “are you trying to insinuate something Severus?”
She put on a weak smile and said, “hey. How are you two doing?”
It was a few seconds before they passed the tops of the pyramids. He took them higher in the air and then leveled out. She was behind him and had her arms wrapped around his waist. “Hold on,” he told her. She tightened her arms around him and he sped off.
He saw it in her face that they both became aware of the position they were in at the same time. Him lying on his back. She straddling him while pinning him down. She let him up. He coughed and said, “I need to plan my first few lessons.”
They ate lunch and Luna went to Defense against the dark arts class. She had mixed feelings about Professor Moody. He was too paranoid for her to be fully comfortable in the class but she understood why he was that way and didn’t judge him.
Arlene loved it just for the fact that it was homemade. That Luna had made it with her own hands instead of just buying something. She suddenly felt as if her gift to Luna was inadequate.
Arlene gave a fierce smile and said, “I’m in full support of you Ginny. I never liked that creepy old man anyway. Let’s get your freedom.”
“And a something,” George added.
sorry about the late update. Yesterday was a really long day at my day job.
Harry breathed out, “Tom? Voldemort?”
They were at breakfast when a letter was dropped in front of Arlene. There was no sender labeled on it. She picked it up and looked it over. She didn’t want to open it, something about the letter gave her a bad feeling.
A normal dragon was a terrifying creature that was only rivaled by basilisks and giants. A thirty to forty foot or nine to twelve meter fire breathing beast that could fly and had a nearly insatiable appetite was terrifying enough. He had massive respect for people like Charlie Weasley who would brave beasts like that.
Dumbledore interrupted him to ask, “did you say Voldemort was attacking you?”
It wasn’t a dragon but Arlene could understand the confusion. It was a house sized carriage pulled by multiple massive winged horses. It pulled up and landed with the thunder of hooves and wheels slamming into the ground. It pulled up too close and many of the front row students retreated. Professor McGonagall demanded, “stay in line!”
“I slept well. It was rather quiet actually. I didn’t expect that.” She answered while standing up.
She sat down and he explained, “On Christmas day there will be a ball taking place which is traditionally part of the Triwizard tournament. As a champion you are required to attend in dress robes or a dress.” He rolled his eyes, “this should’ve been explained to you at the beginning of the year. Before someone put your name in.” She nodded but didn’t say anything. Professor Flitwick went on, “you only have to be here for Christmas but you will need a partner.”
“You almost got me, Professor.” He turned to her and said, “tell you what, she writes anything bad about one of my kids and I’ll ask you about that private meeting.”
They stood in London but it was on fire. He could hear hostile spells being cast. Muggle gunfire was going off somewhere he couldn’t see. He looked down and screamed again. He was standing on skulls. Hundreds of them. He looked back to Dumbledore and then he knew what fear was. Dumbledore had aged ten years and his eyes had gone black. A mad smile split his face as he said, “look what we made Severus. The world will be cleansed of all the dirty ones. We will rule as we were always meant to.”
“I hate this fucking place,” she muttered under her breath as she marched yet another student who had gotten in a duel with Potter. Ever since the champions had been announced a week ago it felt like every student who put their name in but didn’t get chosen wanted to harass or duel him over it. Weasley didn’t have this problem. Everyone seemed to hate Potter for it because he was already famous.
Arlene shrugged. “To be honest, after the second one I think they’ll tone things down. It’s just a maze. I don’t even have to win this one.” She smiled. “I’m not worried about it at all.”
Over the summer he had made good on his promise to take her a trip. Using his money. He had taken her to see a brand new movie in America. Then went out to Spain to eat at what boasted to be one of the best restaurants in the world according to his research. The final event of the night was a fireworks show. The whole time they had been traveling he had only thought of her as a friend. When he looked at her during that night he head truly seen how beautiful she was. Then she had looked at him with such wonder in her eyes. Then they somehow ended up holding each other. For those few minutes he didn’t know what their relationship was. He didn’t care either.
Arlene let them lead her down the new corridor. Then another. They were leading her someone in particular but they wouldn’t tell. “Just tell me,” she demanded.
Ron held up his hand. He leaned forward and said, “Me and my family have been barely getting by for years. I want us to be at least a little better off. The ten thousand will pay off what we have left on the house. With that bill gone there’ll be more money for the house from my dad’s paycheck. I really need to win.” He looked down and wiped at his eyes.
“Egypt,” Ginny told him as they walked in. The hut looked like it had been freshly cleaned. There was a noticeable lack in the usual dust The floor was clear of any straw or dirt. She commented, “Hagrid, you’ve been cleaning. What’s the occasion?”
He snatched it away as she reached for it. She pleaded with him, “Professor, it makes more sense for me to hold on to it. You could get fired.”
He was almost to the common room when a voice called out to him from the shadows. “Mr. Malfoy, what are you doing out so late?” He tensed up for a second until Professor Snape glided from the shadows and into his wand light. He wore an emotionless expression.
She shrugged and answered, “I’m just good like that. Now, I’m sorry but I have to get my stuff ready for the ball tonight. Adrian better be doing the same. I want him to look good.” She looked at their confused looks and explained, “we’re dancing together tonight. Arlene, I didn’t tell you that we’re romantic now?”
Severus asked, “Sir, is there a way we could host this at a different school? We could just send some students of age to act as potential champions. The ones not chosen could remain as envoys to spread good news about the school.” He shrugged and added, “perhaps from my own house? They do so love this school professor.” He looked pointedly at McGonagall. “They are also well behaved. Unlike some members of other houses.”
“No, something is wrong. Get back to the cup, now!”
Adrian raised an eyebrow as he drew his wand. He introduced himself, “Adrian Barnes, alchemy master of Hogwarts.”
He told her, “most of these will either put a person to sleep or nearly kill them. For the strongest effect you might want to use the Draught of living death. For a fully grown dragon you might need five doses. It is difficult to brew and whatever potion you choose to brew I will make you do it.” He switched tactics, “the two potions at the bottom are to be taken by you. If you need me to explain what Fire protection potion does I’m going to kick you out of this office. You should note that it does not protect your clothes.” Professor Snape leaned forward, “Felix Felicis is the world’s strongest luck potion. If you take it then your chances of success increase a substantial amount.” He raised a finger. “That does not mean you will be invincible.” Arlene looked over her options. The potions master asked, “tell me when you have made your decision. I will only provide the ingredients and recipe. It is up to you to brew it.”
Sirius and Remus were returning fire from behind headstones as the figures came towards them. Adrian took cover behind the tall headstone. Harry called out, “Sirius, what are you doing here?”
He nodded and answered, “Professor Flitwick told me you wanted to go. I’ve never been but I can figure it out.” He looked at the knocker and ordered it, “open up. She needs her things.”
Even when the operatic music was traded for the muggle knock-off band Neville still ruled the dance floor. Others cleared the way to watch him move in ways they didn’t think was possible.
Author grunted and remarked, “Not like Lucius to walk away from a chance to boast.”
The librarian took the check and the books away for a few minutes. Then he came back with three books in fresh binding. She knew the copying would be done with magic but she was still impressed with the short amount of time it took. The librarian handed her the books and she thanked him. He nodded in answer.
Arlene was sitting at lunch when Madam Pomfrey burst through the doors to the Great Hall. She marched up to Dumbledore and screamed, “CANCEL THE TOURNAMENT! I JUST STAYED UP ALL NIGHT REATTACHING SOMEONE’S  LEG!” Her tone lowered but the same amount of rage burst from it. “Half the hospital wing is filled with injured people from your little games! I’m not having this again!” She walked away from the table and left the room. Dumbledore never even stopped eating.
Tom Riddle.
Ginny went on, “you didn’t even want to enter a few days ago and now you’re all excited about it? You were supposed to flop out of the first trial and then not die in it.” She spread her hands and shook in indignation.
Felix Felicis.
The invisibility spell wore off but they were nearly a kilometer in the air according to Adrian. No one would see something as small as them from the ground. The spells on them protected them from the wind chill and any particles that came near them. The charmed seat made the ride more comfortable than a normal broom by far. His new broom was the latest model of Firebolt so speed wasn’t a problem. The charms on the broom even allowed them to hear each other talk.
“Now you’re exaggerating the story,” he tried to defend himself.
She gasped and opened her eyes. Her mind withdrew back to her own conscience.
Arlene planted a foot on her stomach. Grabbed her hair and pushed Rusu away with her magically enhanced leg. Rusu’s hands slipped off her hair easily and flew several feet away.
Arlene told him, “I won’t put my name in. I’ve had enough excitement for a lifetime.”
Joan held up a finger and said, “I have a suggestion.” She took one of Arlene’s hands and said, “each tournament eliminates one champion from each school. Just flunk the first tournament and you don’t have to do anymore.” She sighed and added, “that’s only if we don’t find a way to get you out of this another way. I’m going to get a hold of this rule book and comb it page to page to find a way to get you out of it.” She rubbed her hands in a motherly way. She smiled at her, “I know you don’t like this. We’ll help you.”
Hagrid was impressed. Luna had the serene look that she maintained at most times. Hagrid said, “I see you really like butterbeer. I can get you some for my house so you have a better supply closer.”
She opened her eyes to see Luna looking at her with concern. She patted Luna on the shoulder and said, “I’m fine. Little shocking is all.” The girl behind her giggled at her but she ignored it.
He fell to the ground and the jar rolled away. He wasn’t paralyzed but he felt extremely confused. Almost like he was drunk. His vision was fuzzy around the edges. He asked, “did you just discombobulate me?” he couldn’t remember the charm that she might’ve used on him.
“Connery takes the lead but is followed closely by Delacour. All of the champions have reached the wall. Ah! Krum has reached the top!”
For the next week she would go down to Hagrid’s at least once a day and knock on his door. She didn’t get a response any of those times. After another week of researching she felt like she had read every book in the library on dragons. She still had no way of defeating one without using her own magic.
Malfoy immediately marched in front of him and demanded, “excuse me? Did you just insult me? My father will hear about this.”
Voldemort looked at him. Their eyes locked. He said only, “I did not kill Lily and James Potter. Dumbledore did, then he killed me. Every act of terror I did was under his control. Dumbledore is the enemy.” Then he turned and charged at the death eaters with his wand raised.
His glare wasn’t the one he wore when planning murder. This was a much toned down version. He seemed to just be mildly angry over it. She tried to explain but Joan interrupted with, “Arlene, that was pure genius. I can’t even do alchemy that cool!” Then her face went to a mild glare and she asked, “so care to explain the coming in first thing?”
Hermione huffed but didn’t argue with her logic. The biggest question was: why was the ministry getting involved at all?
Hermione brought her head up and suggested, “you can bring in an element though. You can just bring one to the trial. What do you think could hurt a dragon?” She looked at the others for ideas.
The day of the first trial arrived. All the champions were gathered in a large tent next to the Quidditch field. They angle they had approached from made the field hidden from them by the tent. Professor McGonagall had been the one to lead them to the field. This was done intentionally to prevent them from seeing what the trial would be ahead of time. Inside the tent were special robes for them.
Dizziness draught.
There was a different spirit demon in that goblet. He had a feeling it was a weaker kind. He couldn’t know for sure. He had purged Abaddon from his mind in the monastery so he couldn’t ask for his advice. Not that he wanted to. He had only ever used that power on fighting Michael but the demon remained with him for years. Until the monks of the monastery helped him purge it from his body and mind. It was his secret that he had only ever told the monks. Not even the others at the camp knew. He didn’t want to go around telling people that he had made a deal with a demon.
Arlene yelled, “I don’t want to be part of this stupid game!”
Over the next few days Arlene, Luna, and Ginny didn’t get bothered anymore by bullies. Arlene became everyone’s favorite champion. The whole school loved the idea that someone with no use of magic could make it to the second trial of the Triwizard tournament. Everyone was eager to ask how she managed to use fire in the first but she always said something mysterious or refused to answer.
“Hagrid you might be excited to hear that dragons will be part of the first trial.” Dumbledore told him. A smirk was on his face as if this would convince the groundskeeper. Adrian was completely aghast. He sat in the chair repetitively putting his head in his hands and lifting it up. It was a desperate attempt to understand the logic behind this.
Ginny was just happy to see that her friend wasn’t going to get ridiculed for something she couldn’t control. Also that this had just blown up in Skeeter’s face.
“This is it. We’re in for it now,” commented Remus.
He actually smiled. “Your Mister Bagman has promised me that I’ll get the ten thousand Galleons even though I’m technically disqualified.” He closed his eyes. “I got what I wanted. With the money I can help my family. We don’t have much but with this we can have a better life for a little while at least.” He smiled. “I have to rest now. Thank you, Connery.” He was sleeping within seconds.
Luna asked, “is it asking about the Nargles?”
“I mean have you noticed we swear like ten times more than all the others combined? I heard McGonagall do it the other day and I thought I was having a nightmare.” She felt his lips brush the top of her head and he went on, “I know what you mean. We’ve had hard lives. Most of our youth was spent learning to solve our problems with extreme violence. I think I’m still trying to unlearn that.”
She gently slapped his abs and told him, “no, I want to ask if those monks ever taught you some stuff about meditation or some shit.”
They went back to the roof and Adrian had her get on the broom. He recast the invisibility spell and told her, “hold on. Next stop is the library of Alexandria.” The broom rose in the air and they sped off to the lighthouse. He landed them behind a stone pillar and made them visible again.
Joan asked her, “why don’t you tell us what happened there? Why did you cast a spell from under your jacket? Why did your photographer cast a spell from under his jacket?”
Ron shook his head and told her, “Hermione, we haven’t even started sleeping charms yet. Besides the first loud noise the crowd makes and it’ll wake right back up.”
Ron tried to get them to tell him if he was okay but they didn’t stop. Which was a good thing he supposed. Better to get him to some medical care than worry about what his friend thought.
They went to Care of magical creatures. This was the first elective class they would have. It would be different than what they were used to but based on what happened last year it might be less exciting than they were expecting. Arlene asked Luna, “do you think Hagrid will try to keep things simple because of Draco’s accident last year?”
Arlene fell into the grass of the Quidditch pitch. For a second there was silence. Then horrible cheering filled the air around her. Tears of confusion and shock had begun to fall from her face. The cheering stopped when a heart broken scream rent the air, “NO!”
The furrow in his eyebrows deepened. Everyone else had already gone up. Most flowers survived but blackened with fire contact. Others went limp from the cutting attempt. A few didn’t feel like real flowers or didn’t come apart like normal ones.
Adrian ran back towards the clearing while yelling at the students, “get back to the cup! That’s an order!” He cleared a tall gravestone just in time to be blinded. He squinted and shielded his eyes. A massive beam of light had shot from the cauldron. It faded as soon as it had appeared. His breath caught as he saw the cage had been broken by the beam of light. Smoke hid the inside of the cage so he didn’t know what was happening in it.
After seeing Harry’s condition his fear was in full alert. He focused on his plan and walked out into the stadium. He walked out and immediately saw the massive green dragon guarding her eggs.
Her gaze hardened. She turned to him and glared into his eyes, “I’ll never be your lover, Severus. I’m dead. You were supposed to be my best friend but you could never accept that.” She leaned forward. “Now, start moving on and living your life because Dumbledore is going to kill everyone on the planet in a few years.”
Joan pulled her into a hug which she accepted and returned. “I think you just recovered a big piece of your family’s heritage. You should be proud. I know I am and your parents would be.”
He patted his chest and responded, “I know. I know. I get them too. J-, I mean Winters does too. It’s a weird week if we don’t get called murderers that week. I know it’s hard. Stand up to them Hagrid. The sensible people here still care about you.”
Once she got there she found Ginny and Luna sitting at a table in a corner. She sat with them and told them, “I’m going to make it to the third trial.”
He could still hear Lily as she told him, “be nicer to my son. He’s not James. Don’t trust Dumbledore. Life your life Severus, don’t let me hold you back.”
BEFORE YOU READ!!!!!!!!!
The house elf shook his head sadly. “No one knows. We do wish we did though. We do know that the ministry has used your absence to put more and more harsh restrictions on house elves and other beasts.”
In his mind there was no doubt about it. They were being watched. Someone knew what he was planning. A former Death Eater or someone working for Dumbledore? They couldn’t do the spell here. It had to be in a remote location. Adrian would now have to hoard all the components for himself. It was too dangerous to bring in Sirius and Remus.
Madame Maxine huffed at her and muttered under her breath, “stupid Englishwoman.”
Things went on like this until Monday. On Monday right before Joan was about to go to sleep early she was set upon by a third year Gryffindor named Colin Creevey. “Professor. I have to tell you something. Your adoptee is getting interviewed by Rita Skeeter!”
She shrugged and presented her wand. She told him, “this is ridiculous. The last spell I did was to clean off my shoes.”
Her mouth was full of food so she could only smile and nod. After they were finished the food vanished. Dumbledore stood back up and began speaking. “I now hope that everyone is well nourished and watered. Now to the main event of the night. Bring out the Goblet of Fire.” A coffin was brought out from a side room by what appeared to be a ministry worker. It was polished and well maintained but the sight of a coffin being levitated in front of the staff table was odd. The coffin was set down in front of Dumbledore.
She opened the door and found Professor Snape straightening his office with magic. He sneered at her, “what do you want?”
After an eternity of Professor Binns droning about goblin wars they left class. She had been temporarily distracted by the thought that her ancestors should’ve stopped those wars. Of course they weren’t mentioned. They were about to head to lunch which meant that Professor Binns would be back in his office.
They all obliged and went into the home. There was still little talking as they drank the tea. It did have a calming effect on them and within minutes they were all tired. Mrs. Weasley laid out spots for Luna and Arlene and they all went to bed.
Especially to Arlene, she had seen one of her closest friends in the muggle world beaten for something similar. The woman from the foster home had seen her friend hanging out with another girl and had gone crazy and started hitting her. Arlene had been the only one able to stop her.
As young and athletic as she was, running up and down stairs was taking a toll on her. She soon found herself panting and sweating. She stopped to lean against the wall when she remembered the bathroom that no one ever used. The girl’s bathroom on the second floor. Because of moaning Myrtle.
Ginny danced with Neville several more times than she had planned. To everyone’s surprise he was actually an excellent dancer. This was surprising for many reasons. Neville had always been considered one of the clumsiest students at Hogwarts. He had no balance, no proper posture and no coordination. Ever since his first day at Hogwarts he had been the embarrassing one or the brunt of most jokes.
Wand based spells shot over her shoulders to hit the spider. They bounced off the hardened armor that was its body. She turned to see Harry and Ron had joined her fight against the monster.
“Yeah, today feels like a rest day but maybe save the drinking for later. I’d like to have a clear head for the first half of the day at least.” He stood up and stretched.
Screams of terror and pain came from the death eaters. The survivors fled towards the manor. Those not as lucky moaned and screamed as they were burned or blown apart.
Several minutes later he left the room to find Hermione Granger walking by. She stopped to say, “Professor, I have something strange to ask.” He stopped to listen and she asked, “is there a way we can prove if Rita Skeeter is an animagus?”
She held up a hand and raised a finger, “we’ve been on a stupid expensive date.” She raised another. “I’ve been living in your house for over a year now.” She raised a third finger. “You left me with seven kids in your house for a whole summer and didn’t even call.” She raised a forth. “I haven’t been laid in damn near three years and I want some good dick.”
“All of his notes are covered in black ink. Entire paragraphs had been blanked out.” She had to breathe deeply to keep calm.
Luna said, “we can come with you.” Ginny shrugged and nodded in agreement. The trio set off to Adrian’s office. Luna got to it first and knocked on it. “Professor Barnes, your daughter is here to see you.”
Fred and George, pranksters at heart, had allowed him to buy several of their creations. Particularly the ones that made a lot of noise and smoke.
They both stood there with arms crossed. In the back of her mind she realized this was the first time she ever had parental figures team up on her. It was also the first time she didn’t have a good answer for them. “Uh…” was all that came out.
Arlene Pov.
Arlene gripped her tighter and said, “I will, I’m sorry.”
She moved forward. She left her boar behind. There was no need for it now. She told the dragon in her mind, “yes, you will be taken home if you give me the golden egg.”
“Freak!?” Arlene screamed. She moved towards him but Hagrid placed a massive hand to stop her. She took several deep breaths and backed up.
Sirius and Remus nodded. They had everything covered. Their plan was foolproof. So why did Adrian still feel like something was going to go wrong?
“Our hotel, we need a place to spend the nights.” He spun the broom around while searching. “It caters to traveling wizards so they’ll be able to tell us about the library as well.” He moved to the left and mumbled something. He moved to the left more and exclaimed, “ha! Found it.” He moved towards it and landed on the roof.
Harry looked around as if the answer lay around them. “I don’t know. We can’t go public about us,” his frown deepened, “as much as I want to.” He scratched at his head and answered, “We’ll discuss it later. We’ll have to find somewhere. Somewhere secret.”
Adrian felt his bloodlust rise. He held it down for now. It did no good now. Later it would be put to great use.
Arlene noted that and sat down across from her. She slide a box to Ginny and said, “this is a real gift.” She opened it and found another amulet like the one Luna had received. Arlene informed her of the protective charm on it.
He opened the door holding a box. “What a coincidence, I have a gift for my daughter.” He handed Arlene the box. She reached into her pockets and pulled out a slim box. He took it so she could open her box. Adrian got another protection amulet. Arlene pulled a pair of gloves from hers. “Dragonhide gloves, can stop a knife blade so you can wear them during potions or herbology. They’re also resistant to most forms of magic.”
Mr. Crouch raised a calming hand and said, “there’s no evidence. You have no proof.” He raised his wand. “Unless.” He walked up to Skeeter and demanded, “present your wand. We shall see what spell you cast last.”
He actually blushed and stammered some. He managed to say, “sometimes I just feel like cleaning up the place.” He looked out the window.
Ginny responded without looking up from her book, “that sounds right.” She then looked up at Arlene and asked, “are you mad?”
Bliss radiated from her lips. She went gently and caressed her lips with care. Their bodies pressed against each other as they embraced. Their contact was still soft and loving. No need for urgency, no rush to get anywhere. It lasted for what felt like hours. Then it ended so soon. They broke apart for air then rejoined for a shorter kiss.
Ginny Pov.
Arlene levitated her boar and pushed it out into the stadium. Her heart beat fast in her chest but the Felix was kicking in. It gave her a sense of confidence. Then a voice in her head told her to read the dragon’s mind. She decided to. It would do nothing but give her an edge over her. Maybe a warning if she decided to strike at Arlene.
“Yes,” Lucius answered. “He told Barnes something then turned on us. I did not hear their conversation.” His breath was bated. His body stiff. Lucius was nervous.
They had this class with Gryffindor. Ginny sat next to her and heard her say something. She leaned in and asked, “Did you say something?”
It was an impossible search.
Arlene didn’t know what to do but Professor Flitwick had been honest with her. He was right. Many in the magical community didn’t hate gays but some did. “Thank you Professor.”
Charlie laughed then winced in pain. He got his breathing under control and said, “that’s good to hear.” He rubbed his bandages, “I thought it was just a broken arm. Madam Pomfrey found a few broken ribs too. Hard to tell when most of the body is hurting. She won’t let me go until tonight.” He shook his head. “It’s strange being here again. I never thought I would end up back in Madam Pomfrey’s infirmary.”
In the nicer one the tent was split up into various rooms. In one room, in separate sleeping bags, slept Arlene Connery and Luna Lovegood. The thing was that these two sleeping bags had found their way next to each other during the night. The two residents remained deep in sleep as the sun rose over the world.
The boy from earlier yelled out, “Professor we need some new water. This one has loony in it now.” He along with his some of the other students laughed at Luna. Arlene scowled and helped Luna from the water trough.
They reentered the castle. Far too soon they had to separate to return to their own common rooms. Alone in the corridor they risked a quick hug. They separated and Draco asked, “when can we meet again?”
Draco began the long walk outside. Out the Great Hall and into the entrance hall. Every step of the way he was reciting and questioning the words he had chosen. It was too hot in his robes. Every step down the hall sounded louder than it ever had before.
Hermione slapped the table again and exclaimed, “you’ve been to the Library of Alexandria?” Her jaw dropped then snapped back up so she could say, “I’ve been wanting to go ever since I heard about it. Is it as great as the one here at Hogwarts?”
Luna gave her half smile and asked, “can you still be careful in the maze? Please? Something gives me an odd feeling about it.”
Professor McGonagall nodded and said, “I accept your apology. Thank you for being mature about your mistake.” She raised her eyebrows. “Believe me, I understand your emotions, I feel them too.”
He threw himself in the open, shielded himself from a spell. He fired a disintegration spell at a death eater’s head and removed it. “Diffindo!” He slashed at a death eater’s neck and slit it. He blocked more spells coming at him.
The tall woman spat at her, “don’t talk back to your betters, little girl.”
I do have bad news: I'm taking two weeks off. The first chapter of book 4, Truth, will be dropped on Feb. 8th. I'm taking this time to advance write book 4 to keep ahead of myself. Stay safe and enjoy yourselves!
He walked outside while responding to their goodbyes. Then he saw it. A flash of light that looked like a reflection. The paranoid part of his brain told him to check it out. The not-paranoid part told him it was just his imagination. He had just finished a conversation discussing resurrecting the worst dark wizard ever in plans to possibly kill one of the most beloved wizards alive.
“Thank you,” Adrian took a nearby seat and closed his eyes. He looked resting but he was actually practicing one of the mental exercises he had learned at the monastery. It was supposed to clear the mind of minor distractions so he could focus on the major task at hand. He had been good at it so he figured it was a good one to get restarted with.
He walked in the house to find Sirius and Remus holding each other. Sirius barked at him, “what was that!”
Many of the others paced or tightened bracers on their arms. Arlene grabbed a pair of the pieces of armor for her arms. They were leather pads that covered the outside of her forearms. They were flexible to move her wrist but would protect her from bruises and scrapes. Then she sat back on her bench and waited for the inevitable.
As she closed the book she began to realize what she wanted to see. All these books held information on world events that involved her family. The words would help a student doing a report or a historian learn more. There was something specific that she was searching for that she would never find in the pages of a book. She wanted to know her blood parents. She wanted to know who they were as people. Unless someone had taken the time to write a story about them then she would never get the chance to know them as people.
Arlene explained, “like holding hands and kissing without having to worry about anyone judging us. I just wanted us to have some privacy.”
They took a seat by the lake. The view over the water was picturesque. The most beautiful thing though was that Harry Potter didn’t hate him for his feelings. He hadn’t laughed him off or worse started screaming homosexual related slurs at him. The insult to his heart in a moment of openness would’ve been far too hurtful for him.
McGonagall asked an important question, “Professor, haven’t students died in the past from that tournament? Which is why it was cancelled?”
“Yes.” Luna replied cheerily. “I had a dream about a secret island of dragons. It was nice.”
Stairs came into view. He moved up them slowly. At the top was a room with the light on. He went into the room and scanned his surroundings. The only things that stood out were a chair in front of the fireplace and a giant snake on the ground.
His broom lost control and he rolled into the ground. His back hit the far wall of the stadium and pain roared through his body. He ripped off his robes to reveal his jeans and t-shirt underneath.
“You don’t want to know,” she breathed out. As they approached the podium her strength returned. She was able to walk on her own by the time they reached it. Arlene told Ron, “there it is, take it. We got you here so you could.”
He stood tall and proud. She could still see the nerves in him but he hid them well. He went outside and into the stadium.
They stopped in the entrance hall and he told her, “anywhere. Professor Winters is going to start at the astronomy tower and work her way to the Ravenclaw common room. I’m going down to the dungeons and working my way up. I suggest all the girl’s bathrooms in between. I can’t go in those.”
He stood back up and bolstered himself. There was only one way this could end. With him holding that egg.
Severus got up and walked around. Trying to get more blood flowing to his brain. He still didn’t put a log into the fire.
She stopped. Ginny tapped her shoulder and asked, “what did you say in class?”
Arlene smiled at her. They made their way to Ravenclaw tower. When they got there the raven asked, “Can you name three consecutive days without using the days of the week?”
Ministry workers dragged Harry in through the tent. His back was scorched and he could see second degree burns in the holes in his clothes. They took him right out the other side. Hopefully to the hospital wing. One of the workers carried his egg and his damaged broom with him.
They headed back to the camp buzzing with conversation about the game. Thousands of witches and wizards poured from the stadium. They went back to their tents and Adrian began cooking up some steaks on the fire.
Ginny had to appreciate her boldness but Luna and her followed Arlene to the Great Hall. She watched as Arlene walked up to the doorway and stood there with her arms crossed.
They both put their hands on her shoulders and steered her down a corridor she hadn’t been planning on going down. In unison, “we’re changing direction now.”
Adrian said, “I’m glad you two were brave enough to come out like this. It is cool.” He pointed to the open doors and added, “there’s decorations outside too if you want to see them.”
She knew that the Weasley’s were barely getting by even with their dad working a government job. She felt truly selfish now. She had enough money that ten thousand seemed like nothing to her. Yet to have all that and give none of it to her friend was the epitome of selfishness. She nodded, “okay, I’ll help you. I’ll help you win.” She knew it was about more than the money. She could give them ten thousand, hell, she could gift them twenty thousand and not even notice it. Getting Ron famous, getting him to be the next Triwizard champion would continue a steady influx of cash. Not to mention bring glory to the Weasley name. She nodded again and said louder, “I’ll help you win.”
Back when Adrian had been in the camp there was a day that he challenged Michael, his tormentor and ruler of the camp. He lost, he got lucky and was allowed to live but on the condition that he was sent into the woods to retrieve the head of a feral werewolf that he kept around the camp. If he tried to escape then Michael would hunt him down and kill him.
The now young looking Dumbledore told him, “it’s a shame that I’ll have to hide this improvement. You may go now. Find Voldemort.”
They spotted Victor Krum running around the lake. He passed them but gave a friendly wave. They waved back and Luna asked, “I thought you were a fan of him? Why don’t you ask for an autograph?”
Luna frowned and said, “Ginny, I don’t want you to have to fight people.”
The troll got the full brunt of it. She heard the footsteps moving away as the troll yelled in pain. Looking away from the fire made the light far less intense. It was only intense when staring right at it. Like the troll had been when it bounced off its face.
Arlene Pov.
About half an hour later the train lurched and the trip to Hogwarts began. They chatted on the way there and discussed theories about the next Defense against the dark arts professor. Arlene got them some candy from the trolley as it passed.
Dumbledore tapped his wand against the Goblet of Fire three times. Barty told him, “I will find him. I will not fail you.”
McGonagall leaned in closer and whispered, “I can get the two of you alone.”
“Romantic.”
“oh,” Arlene had forgotten to tell Ginny what she realized. Luna was distracted by the Weasley twins. “I’m in love with Luna.”
Arlene figured that she didn’t even have to try for this one. She had done her part and gotten Ron to the final task. There was still competition to their plan. If someone not from Hogwarts reached the end of the maze first then all her effort would be for nothing. She would have to try to win unless Ron got close enough to beat her to it.
Joan set a reassuring hand on her shoulder. There was no easy answer. She put her hand on her shoulder to buy a few seconds to think. She looked at her. Arlene so smart but still so young and scared. The world would converge on her without a care for the slightest bit of interest. Joan knew in that instant that she would never let that happen. An unreasonable expectation to fight the whole world but she would try it for Arlene.
Remus smiled and said, “Dumbledore told us his real name was Tom Riddle. He came from a muggle orphanage but we don’t know the name of the orphanage.”
In the seconds after Ron’s death Arlene had put her hands on Ron and her dad, Adrian. Harry had put his hands on Ron and summoned the cup to them so they could get out of there. Remus and Sirius apparated away. Tom Riddle, Voldemort, or whatever his name was, was nowhere to be seen.
“Connery is doing some kind of Alchemy. Either she’s gone mad or is up to something spectacular!”
He couldn’t see her expression but Joan did sit next to him and hold him. He would’ve understood if she was angry with him. She probably should’ve been.
He blushed and responded, “oh, I was my pleasure. Thank you for asking me. If you hadn’t then I don’t think I would’ve come.” They went to bed shortly afterwards.
She had a point. Arlene packed for five days and hugged Luna. She hugged her back and told her, “I’ll come down and ask how long you’ll be gone.” The two of them went down to the entrance hall and found Adrian there. Luna spoke to him first, “hello Professor, I was wondering how long the two of you will be gone.”
Madam Pince showed up at that moment and scolded them in a whisper, “get out, you are being way too loud.” Ginny huffed but they got up and had to leave. It was almost dinner time they made their way to the Great Hall.
They turned to Hagrid who said, “Arlene, I didn’t know you knew Madam Rosmerta. How did you two meet?”
The six of them left the library and headed for Hagrid’s hut. When they got outside they saw ministry workers levitating loads of lumber, stone, and metal bars down into the forbidden forest. They had even cut a path into the trees that was visible from the door to the entrance hall.
Madame Maxine blurted out, “for goodness sake, why is this stupid girl trying to pass up the chance of a lifetime?”
Arlene shrugged. Luna was rarely wrong so they started walking to the Quidditch field. When it came into view they saw it had been changed again. An array of hedges had grown in the field and around the gaps in the stadium seats. Hagrid’s tall silhouette could be seen by a gap in the hedges. At this gap ministry workers could be seen moving stadium style seating near the entrance in a massive semi-circle.
In this moment she had an idea. The idea that the ministry had assassinated her family and left her in a muggle orphanage.
Arlene Pov.
Arlene put the final stir in her potion. It turned the right shade and she set her spoon aside with relief. Five hours she had been working. The first potion, Felix Felicis had been complex but she had managed it. To say that Professor Snape was impressed was an understatement. It was more like he was shocked into silence.
They appeared at the gates to begin the walk up to the castle. Their feet crunched in the snow. Arlene asked him a question, “Adrian, you had all the information in the world at your hands. You could’ve looked up anything. Why did you just want to leave?”
The snow was falling outside again. The stars shone brightly against the night sky. Ginny looked at Neville and told him, “I had a really great time Neville. Thank you for coming with me.”
George followed with, “that’s a fact.”
Arlene found them interesting. They didn’t seem to do much though. Maybe that would change. Hagrid began talking about them, “these beauties right here shed their own horns every three months. They grow back and come off without a problem. Fascinating.”
Hedgerows had been set up around the doorway into the school. A fountain with a unicorn statue in it dominated the center of attention. It was in between the hedges that they spotted Harry and Draco dancing out of view of everyone else. They couldn’t be as open as Arlene and Luna because of Draco’s dad. At least they got to spend some time together. Maybe what Arlene and Luna did would push the world to be more accepting.
The house elves finished with the boar. She held her wand but used her own magic to lift the boar. She levitated it to her dormitories and put a sheet over it. She had already talked about it to her dorm members and they didn’t mind. They were smart enough to know that it wouldn’t smell. Bugs also couldn’t get into the dorms or common rooms of Hogwarts.
George looked at her and told her, “there’s a staircase that leads down from the Great Hall. Looking into the hall it is to the left.”
He walked past it, skirting the fence that surrounded it. Over the crest of the hill stretched a large graveyard. As he looked over it part of him regretted not asking for the man’s help. He walked down into it and began looking over the headstones. He wanted a sense of order to it but there were no paths to it. The graves weren’t arranged all that well either.
Arlene lay in the other bed and told him, “thank you for bringing me out here.”
She looked out the window hoping some scenery would calm her. The grassy fields and the forest beyond did some for her nerves. Not as much as she would’ve liked.
Arlene relented, “alright. I’m looking forward to it Hagrid.” They made small talk for another hour or so. Arlene drank three more butterbeers. After some time Hagrid got up and told them he was going to stretch his legs for a while.
They went to the nearest empty classroom. Once they closed the door Ginny told them, “this is hard to swallow so I’ll explain it as best as I can.” She told them about the agreement between her family and Dumbledore. When she had gotten deathly sick but her family couldn’t afford the treatment. Dumbledore had offered to cover it if they agreed to enter Ginny into a marriage contract with Harry Potter. Then Ginny told them that she didn’t love Harry. It was all an act.
Her heart dropped a little but she knew it was the truth. Arlene nodded and peeked out of the curtains to make sure the coast was clear. They left the bed and got ready for sleep. They went to bed in their own beds. Arlene slept fitfully as she didn’t know what to expect from the next few days.
McGonagall backed him up, “good idea Diggory.” She looked to Dumbledore but he was already shaking his head.
This one was strong. He was good at choking at least. He was having a hard time breathing. Adrian flipped his wand around in his hand and jabbed it backwards. He felt it dig into the death eater’s side. Doing the wand motion backwards was hard and something he hadn’t practiced in years. He still pulled it off. “Stupefy!”
When she woke up the next morning the first thing she did was go down to breakfast to find Arlene and Luna. She didn’t find them there but she had gotten up later than usual. She went up to the staff table and asked Professor Barnes, “Professor, have you seen Arlene or Luna?”
He shook his head. “It wouldn’t matter. There’s not much she could do that wouldn’t kill everyone in the stadium as well.”
The whole school had a new favorite champion, Arlene. So it was surprising when she told Ginny at the start of term, “I’m going to fail the second trial.”
Arlene closed her eyes and placed her hands on the back of her head. There was nothing she could do about it now. There was no solution at hand. It was impossible for now to figure out who did it and why. She shook her head and said, “Let’s go to lunch. I can’t do anything about it now.”
Yeah Ginny, really? She wasn’t sure what made her say that. She had no intention of saying that. There was no turning back now. She had been planning on going anyway and why not go with someone instead of by herself? “Yes, really. Now tell me.”
Hagrid nodded. “Oh yes, many beasts and whatnot.” He caught her look and amended, “but nothing that will be too dangerous. I can’t say what will be in there but it won’t be anything too exciting.” They all knew what Hagrid’s idea of exciting was. Arlene was actually happy to hear that nothing exciting would be in the maze. There had been enough excitement in the past two and half years for a lifetime.
The sun rose over a field of tents. Warmth flooded the grass and removed the dew from the grass. A massive stadium rose in the background. It was taller than any other stadium in the world. The early risers were up in front of their tents. Using magic fires to cook breakfast or simply conjuring it. Two tents contradicted one another. One was shabby and heavily used. It had been poorly set up. Several patch jobs had been done on it. The other was new and had been set up well. It had zippers and a rain cover.
Arlene held up a hand to calm him. “It’s fine Hagrid. I wasn’t trying to get the news spread out all that well. I really wanted to forget about it.” The butterbeers arrived. Madam Rosmerta had to leave to see to another table so they couldn’t talk to her. Arlene took a drink and fell in love with it all over again.
He told her, “I’m fine. I wanted to thank you for helping me. I think the Felix potion really helped.” Arlene didn’t even attempt to hide her confusion. His leg had been bitten off and he had been flung around like a rag doll. Now he considered himself lucky. He explained, “I thought about it all night. It could’ve easily been my head that got bit off. My ribcage could’ve been crushed. My leg could’ve been swallowed and never retrieved.” He patted his thigh. “Instead I will be able to walk in two days. The healer wants me to do some exercise to ensure it really healed. That might take another two days. At the end of it I will be back to normal.”
Three of them searched through almost every book on dragons. They were joined halfway through the month by Hermione, Harry, and Ron. They had worked out their scepters as well and now worked on ways for Harry and Ron to get past dragons.
She nodded and said, “we will. I’ll stick by but don’t bring any attention to yourself. Especially not around Skeeter.” Joan squeezed her shoulder reassuringly then moved to the other side of the room for a better vantage.
I just need to say that I mean no offense to anyone by writing this chapter. If I did something wrong or offensive by accident please let me know so I can fix it. As always I am open to feedback and constructive criticism.
Then he kneeled in the snow. He placed both his hands on her shoulders. The tired Professor explained, “I know what you want to say. Ever since I first saw you standing on those stairs in your normal clothes you’ve reminded me of someone who I never got to know properly. Someone I hold very close to my heart. You now lie next to that spot.” Tears filled his eyes but they didn’t fall. “Arlene Connery, we’re not related by blood, but after everything we’ve been through together I would consider it an honor for you to let me call you daughter.”
It was the same writing. Adrian began saying, “I don’t see it. Are we in the right place?” She pulled on his sleeve and pointed to it. He followed her finger and saw it. “Oh, good job. Let’s go.”
Arlene Pov
Madam Pomfrey approached them saying, “all my patients need immediate attention.” Then she saw Bastion’s condition. Her face paled but she went into action. He pulled the stretcher to a bed and set him down on it.
Remus lifted his head and said, “Dumbledore knew about our plan from the beginning.”
Adrian Barnes woke up with a massive headache. He groaned as he sat up, the world swimming around him. He reached for the water he had set up last night and a potion guaranteed to remove a hangover. He drank both and hammers stopped pounding the inside of his skull. He summoned more water and sipped at it.
They changed the subject quickly. “Mom, what’s for breakfast?” Fred asked.
She told him, “Thank you for escorting us, Mr. Lupin.”
Dumbledore straightened up and he held in his hands an ornate goblet. He set it on the podium and stared at it. Every eye in the room was fixated on it. Arlene still felt nervous about it for some reason. Then fire burst into existence.
Joan opened his door. He flinched and asked, “knock?”
Arlene smiled at her and asked, “are you enjoying yourself?”
Her adoptive parents strolled by and Joan said, “I didn’t know you two were dating. That’s cool.”
He explained, “I’m checking for hidden spells and stuff. I don’t know what the former tenants might’ve left.” He checked for more things then shut the door and added some protection spells to it.
Adrian nodded and they went inside. They both sat at a circular dining table. He pulled out a large book. It was old and damaged. Adrian explained, “This book details the history of the dark wizard who claims to have invented the Horcrux.” He opened it to a set tab and read, “When we lay the killing curse on Gregory his body became as dust. The apparition of a face fled, screaming, from the scene.” He looked to Sirius and asked, “No one ever found Voldemort’s body? Almost as if it turned to dust?”
Arlene landed on a grassy field. The smell of smoke was still there but much less then what it had been. She sat up and looked over. She saw the field of tents but from far away. Columns of smoke and fire rose in the air. Author explained, “Most of the portkeys were destroyed. They had to emergency make some. This was the farthest they could take us.”
She grabbed his quill and circled the fire protection, Felix, and the standard sleep potion. Professor Snape looked at her choices and said, “Felix Felicis is an extremely difficult potion to brew. You’ll need almost ten doses of the standard sleeping potion to put down a dragon. That amount of ingredients will require compensation to the school.”
He hovered on top of her panting with his eyes closed. Joan stroked his body. He rolled off her and to cuddle with her. They pulled each other close and she kissed his chest. He started stroking her hair.
Minutes later they were inside and walking towards the great hall. Arlene and Luna had to part from Ginny to go to Ravenclaw table. As they went through the sorting of the first years Luna noticed something. “There’s no Defense against the dark arts teacher.”
Remus asked, “how did you convince them to let you adopt all of them with your…” he didn’t want to finish the sentence.
She took his hand and looked him in the eyes, “now kiss me and stop being awkward about it.”
Author got an excited look on his face and reached for the little device. He stared at it while trying to figure it out. He spun the striker but nothing happened except for sparks.
He moved around a tall gravestone to see the last thing he expected: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Arlene Connery sitting around the Triwizard cup.
Fred commented, “seems like those sleeping potions really got to your head.” They laughed while Adrian repeated Fred’s words in a mocking voice.
Ginny ran down to the twins and asked, “how?”
Ginny only realized now what this meant for her. If Harry Potter was gay then she would never ever be able to seduce him. No matter how much money or power or fear Dumbledore used Harry would never love her in a romantic way. This was good since she didn’t love Harry that way either.
He took off his shoes and told her, “the staff told me how to get to the library. We go to the lighthouse and find a door only visible to magical people that will be labeled as the entrance.” He pulled a scrap of paper from the notepad on a desk between the beds and wrote Arabic letters on it. He handed it to her and said, “it will read as this. I’ll be with you but just in case you see it first you can spot it out to me.”
“The muggle one did,” he explained, “the wizarding one survived and has remained hidden.” The map focused on a cleared area right on the coast. “You might be able to visit over Christmas break. I do recommend that you go with someone who has been before. The library is quite massive but hard to find.” He pointed to a light house that was sitting on a spit of land stretching into the Mediterranean sea. “The entrance is near here. I’ve never actually been inside it. I’m not sure of anyone here who has.”
He pulled away only to reappear in a different location. This one seemed peaceful. It was a dark forest. He walked forward until he found a clearing. In this clearing was a beautiful pond with a doe sitting by it. Petting the doe was Lily.
Ginny was liking where this was going. She said, “we just have to show the whole school that you can do magic with a wand.”
A massive roar sounded from outside. She heard Harry breath out, “troll.”
He told them, “for the third trial of course. It’s a maze.” He patted a hedge lovingly. They were currently at his shoulder but still had a whole week to grow. “They’ll be much taller by the time the trial comes around.” He didn’t mean for it to be intimidating but the idea of being trapped between massive walls of plant life did intimidate Arlene.
Arlene told them, “thank you for helping me. I’m going to go find him now.” She waved bye to them and left for the dungeons. The last class of the day had passed but she hoped Professor Snape would still be in his office. She also hoped that he felt like being nice today. She had a feeling he would tell her to just go away but she had to try.
“Fine, some professional you are.” Before she could respond. He leaped at her. They wrestled around for a bit. She was the better hand to hand fighter though. He landed on his back with her over him.
“Thank you Miss Lovegood,” said Hagrid as they came to a clearing at the edge of the forest. A fence stood between them and the creatures beyond. They were similar to pictures of cows Arlene had seen before. The only major difference was they had four horns on their heads. Still in the same general area and shape.
She returned to the table and told them, “the knocker wouldn’t let me in. I was going to grab a book I got from the Library of Alexandria.”
The headmaster finished his speech and sat down. Arlene and Luna went to go get packed up. They filled their suitcases. Luna told her, “we’re going to have to do something special for Ginny later in the summer. It’s not easy to recover from losing a close family member.” For an uncomfortable moment Arlene remembered that Luna knew exactly what that was like. Luna didn’t lose her cheeriness. “She will get better. Having friends to help her is just what she needs.”
Hagrid greeted the man, “Hello Charlie, how are you doing?”
Luna kept her cool to be able to respond, “how would you like me to help with it, Hermione?”
Arlene rolled her eyes and pulled out the scepter from the first trial. It was different now. She showed it to Ginny. At the top was no longer an orb but a mini statue of a dragon guarding an egg. She explained, “the judges said the scepter is the clue to the second trial. There’s a dragon at the top of the scepter. What do you think Ginny?”
Adrian Pov.
“Oh,” Arlene said as what she actually meant settled in. Once she understood what she was asking she responded, “Absolutely. I like that idea. Just the two of us. That sounds nice.”
Her eyes darted away and she said, “I wanted to hear it for myself. Sometimes my visions are wrong.” Her smile had shrunk to a smug little grin.
“Excited for the new year?” Joan shocked him from his reverie. He looked to see her looking at him. She had a familiar look in her eye.
Joan and him ran all way to the castle. The stretcher floated along them. They reached the hospital wing panting and sweating. Joan was able to call out, “critical condition. Critical condition. Needs immediate attention.”
For probably the first time she had ever seen, Fred and George acted serious about something. Fred said, “Let’s keep moving.” George didn’t say anything. Just helped them along.
He had a good point. She set off into the crowd to look for Luna and Ginny. Ginny would be easy to find. There would be a gaggle of redheads possibly surrounded by people ogling at Harry Potter. Her theory proved true. Harry had come in with them but had already found the Weasleys. She made her way through the onlookers and found a gaggle of redheads in the middle.
Barty smiled in a not-fully-sane manner. He nodded and the two of them left out the front door to search for Tom Riddle. Not to return him to Dumbledore’s control but to begin the war against the old madman. Both sides were right in saying that a war was coming but no one knew the truth of why yet.
Arlene walked up to his bed. He bore a resemblance to Mr. Weasley. She said, “yes. My name’s Arlene.”
Then he thought, what if Lily loved Potter the same way Severus loved her? He wanted to be mad at the idea. Deep inside he knew it to be true. Deep inside he knew it to be true. There was a pain in his chest. In that moment he realized that Lily and Potter had loved each other the same way he loved her.
She fought to keep her breath steady. It had already been dark out even with the full moon tonight. The towering walls only made that worse. She could barely make out the walls of the maze. She focused her magic to her eyes and the world in front of her became clearer.
Luna countered, “is it about the dragons?”
He stayed standing with his wand trained on her. “Then you have the audacity to call my new daughter a squib. I really hate that word.”
She jumped but recovered fast. “Good morning Arlene. Are you hungry?”
Arlene flinched as an image burned itself into her mind. A floating skull with horns and it was on fire.
They left the common room to meet up with Ginny. She was waiting in the Great Hall for them with a single custard on a dish in front of her. As soon as they walked up she warned them, “don’t eat that custard. That was my gift from Fred and George and I don’t trust it.”
Luna had already opened her gift. It was not homemade and it was definitely store bought. She had received another necklace. This one had a silver coated chain with a sapphire the size of the pad of Luna’s thumb. It was obviously magical just from the touch of it. As she pulled it from the box Luna’s eyes went wide with happiness.
He smiled but answered, “Professor, you don’t want to be an accessory to a battery now do you?”
Dumbledore looked him in the eyes and said, “see that you don’t.” He lifted the Goblet of Fire to his lips and drank the flames from it. The fire disappeared behind his lips. He grimaced. A change came over Dumbledore.
She made her way through the maze, doing her best to keep going towards the center. At one point she rounded a corner and saw the edges of the Quidditch goal posts over the hedges. From those she could determine she was near the center but still closer to the side she started from.
Luna nodded and got up to hug her. She returned it. They kept hugging as the others passed but none of them said anything. Arlene didn’t know what to say. She felt like she had failed Luna somehow. Luna patted her back and whispered to her, “I still love you. Whatever you do please be safe and remember those who love you.”
To everyone’s surprise, Voldemort began attacking the death eaters. One of them exclaimed, “my lord why?” He died under a green flash.
She focused and, with no signs, used her magic to increase the strength in her legs. She began running faster with ease. She leaped over a mud pit that stretched nearly seven feet with ease.
She asked him, “how long will the ride be?”
He raised an eyebrow and said, “I pay mine more than you make. Mine could buy out your house.” Then he walked away leaving a speechless Hermione. She had genuine points to make. She just talked to the one wizard who did pay his elves better than some wizards got paid.
She looked up and saw him. She smiled and said, “of course, anything.”
Luna didn’t respond to that but Draco and Harry showed up at that point. Ginny had noticed that they had been spending more and more time together. Her guess was that they had grown to like each other more now that they weren’t rivals.
In ten years the monks had taught him plenty and expunged a spirit demon from him. They forced him to retain the knowledge of languages he had gained from the camp. They taught him what felt like every meditation in existence. They did plenty of healing to him. He would be forever grateful to them.
Ron told them, “I don’t care. We all grab it at once. We all risked our lives for this. They can say there was more than one winner. That’s up to them.” He raised his hand but didn’t grab it. Arlene raised her hand. Harry raised his. Ron began a count down, “on three. One, two, three!” They all grabbed it at once and were whisked away via a portkey.
Luna responded, “I think it’s a nice way to celebrate Christmas. I just wish that there wasn’t so much trouble with it. People always complicate nice things. I just want to be with my friends.” She looked at the ground with a sad expression.
This time no one was there. Harry was the first one to reach the door. First he knocked politely. When that didn’t work he slammed his fist in the door and yelled, “Hagrid open this door! We need to talk with you! It’s urgent.”
Joan said, “you resurrected a terrorist to prove a theory? You put the world at risk to see if you were right or not?” She hissed, “you arrogant bastard.” He didn’t argue against it. “At least you were right. Now what do we do about Dumbledore?”
Arlene didn’t want the ten thousand Galleons. She had no need for money. She knew that would motivate many of the students. There were many wizarding families who could use the money. There were a lot of students who would do risky things for that money.
Adrian nodded and told him, “I guess they’re bringing them in today.” They walked into the forbidden forest. Grubbly-Plank led the way.
He had the information he needed. “Thank you. See you soon. I have to get back to work now. They’ll get mad if I’m gone for too long.”
On her way out, Joan pushed against Skeeter hard enough to make her stumble and told her, “watch it.” It was a mean thing to do but after all the lives Skeeter has ruined she deserved far worse. Skeeter scowled at her then recognized her. She smiled a gross smile as her green quill flew out on its own. She opened her mouth to speak until Joan snatched the quill and broke it in half with one hand. Skeeter faltered and looked down to the ground.
Four days later Luna’s article appeared in the Quibbler. The next day all hell broke loose.
Harry offered, “likely Professor Karkaroff will cry to Professor Dumbledore about it.” He smirked at his small attempt at humor.
Mr. Crouch said, “what may have started as a prank is now a chance for destiny. The rules are final. Whatever names come out of the Goblet of Fire will participate in the tournament.”
All that set up just for that? Arlene told him, “well, good news for you, I plan on flopping the first trial.”
“Don’t worry Adrian, she told me she’ll fail the first trial on purpose,” Adrian was quoting Joan in a mocking tone. “She’ll get out of the tournament and be all safe and sound. She’ll be fine. Now fuck me.” He viciously kicked a pile of sand.
She scowled at the knocker and responded, “I’d love to but the knocker won’t let me in.” She turned to him and asked, “are you taking me to that library?”
He threw out some smoke bombs and stink bombs. Then he threw out several chattering teeth that had been enchanted to run from anyone chasing them.
He held up a bag and said, “now, each one of you will pull a card from this bag to figure out which dragon you will be facing. It also determines the order of you going.” He held out the bag to Ron. He reached in a pulled out a card with a green dragon on it. “The Welsh Green,” Mr. Bagman told him.
Luna made a scrunched up face and said, “it was nice but I prefer my own dances. Some of them drive Nargles away.” She reached towards the table and grabbed a slice of pudding.
Even through that they managed. With the combined efforts of Mrs. Weasley and Adrian lunch was prepared. Meanwhile, Joan helped cheer everyone up by telling them what happened to her and Adrian at St. Mungo’s. She started out with what happened when she found Adrian. “So, I found him laying around as usual.”
Then Dumbledore stood up and announced, “it has been twenty four hours since the Goblet of Fire has been lit. Now it is time to choose the champions.” He walked around the table and approached the goblet. He held a hand out to it and seemed to will it to do something. He squinted at it. Was it possible that Dumbledore knew what was in there?
Professor Dumbledore shrugged and said, “I couldn’t control the outcome of that. If you want to tell me how I might have then I’m welcome to ideas.” He didn’t seem phased by the results at all.
Thunder clapped and the doors to the hall burst open. A scarred and limping man walking using a large staff. Every other step he took a loud clomp of wood sounded throughout the room. One of his eyes was clearly a fake as it was large and had a harness holding it in place. He scanned the room as if searching for enemies.
“Sir?” Adrian opened his eyes and looked over at the clerk. “I found your friend.” He stood up and walked over to the desk. “The only cemetery in a village in Little Hangleton.”
She spotted Joan and Adrian. Joan was talking with Professor Sprout while Adrian looked like he was fighting a headache.
Then she did something rather odd. In all the books she had read on dragon behavior she had picked up some things. When threatened dragons will rear up and spread their wings. A natural attempt to look bigger and more intimidating. When a dragon does the opposite and surrenders it lowers its body to look less like a threat. This dragon did the latter. She lowered her body to the ground and looked at her with a nonthreatening demeanor.
Harry left to go find Draco. Ginny couldn’t exactly cheer about her sudden revelation. Luna wasn’t in the mood for that. She was still trying to figure out what to do about the ball. Ginny wanted to help her and blow off some of her newfound energy. She suggested, “Luna, do you want to take a walk around the lake with me?”
Draco smiled. One of the biggest smiles he had ever had. Warmth blossomed from his heart and filled every corner of his being. He squeezed Harry’s hand gently and responded, “thank you. Thank you so much for taking a chance with me. I’ll do my best to make you happy.”
“The goblet has made the selection. There is no other way. Miss Connery step forward.” He was adamant that the goblet’s choice be respected.
Arlene asked, “Professor, we just need to ask Hagrid a question.”
Arlene leaned in too and responded, “After class.”
She spat back, “I know and I’d rather have you alive. My stupid brother and Harry already tried throwing this mess at me.” She took Arlene’s hand and told her, “I don’t want you to risk it because it’s not worth dying over.”
“Ever since that day I saw you in that robe shop. I felt something. Like you were important to me.” He fumbled around trying to find the right words. “I’ve never wanted to be with a girl. I’ve always preferred boys. I can’t come out to the public like that. If my dad ever found out…” He had to stop. The idea of how his father would react scared him. His father was so old fashioned and carried a deep sense of hatred for anything that didn’t fit into his idea of a perfect life. Before Harry could stop him he blurted out, “I love you Harry. I didn’t know how to show it back then. I was young and scared. I’ll understand if you don’t feel the same. I needed to let you know. I couldn’t hold it in any longer.”
Adrian seemed to realize what he had said, “oh, I guess I did say that.” He looked at the ground as if searching for the answer down there. “I don’t know of any other word for what we are.”
An older man with grey hairs met with Dumbledore and again they couldn’t hear what was said. The students with the furs walked in and they followed them in. As they walked whispers sprang up. Mostly about Victor Krum who some claimed to have seen in the Durmstrang students. Arlene didn’t see him so she didn’t believe the rumors.
Adrian yelled at him, “get back to the cup and get out of here!” He fired two spells at the attackers. Arlene and Ron had followed him over too. He grabbed Arlene by the shoulders and told her, “I need you out of here. Things are about to become dangerous. This isn’t part of the trial. Something has gone horribly wrong.”
On the other hand she couldn’t help but notice how pretty Luna was. She loved her beautiful hair. The look in her eyes when she was happy. The way she smiled at the smallest things.
Arlene Pov.
“I’ve decided that I will break the marriage contract. I don’t want to marry Harry. Ron was also being used by Dumbledore to keep an eye on Harry. In the summer before this year we both agreed to break free from him.” She stood tall and proud. The confidence radiating from her was inspiring to Arlene. “Ron was going to use the money from the winnings to break away from Dumbledore. In the time he had known Harry he had grown to like him as a person and not a job. I’m not going to let his death be in vain.” Her voice trembled but she stood tall as an ancient oak tree. “I won’t be used like a whore to pay off a debt. I will be my own person. We both should’ve been. He was denied that by Dumbledore but he won’t get me.”
Another crispy scrap of parchment shot out. Dumbledore caught it and announced, “the first champion from Durmstrang is Victor Krum.” The Durmstrang students stood up and cheered for him. Adrian supposed they were extra proud of him since he was already in a professional Quidditch league.
In unison, “boring! Let’s go do something fun.”
The thirtieth of October was when the visiting schools were scheduled to arrive. Arlene had slightly larger concerns as she placed her homework in front of Professor Barnes.
Adrian answered, “I added sound dampening to the list of spells.” He drank some water from a canteen. “Small sounds like snores and bugs chirping wouldn’t get through.”
Draco relaxed and answered, “I’m sorry Professor. I was in the library studying. I’ve been trying to catch up from the summer break. I need to keep ahead after all.” He delivered his lie calm and well. Years of lying to his family made him great at it.
The school left the room. Luna whispered to Arlene, “Professor Moody used to be an Auror, wizard cop. He was really famous for catching most of the death eaters out there. Also my father says he can use his fake eye to see wrackspurts.”
That night at the end of year feast the air was solemn. The banners that were normally the colors of the house with the most points had been changed to black. Conversation was quiet and reserved. Arlene ate what she could but her appetite wasn’t what it was usually.
Give back to the muggle communities and donate blood. Each donation will earn ten points to the student’s house and ten Galleons. Do some good and donate today.
Luna smiled. She took a hold of Arlene’s hands and hopped as she said, “Thank you so much! I’m looking forward to it now. Let’s go eat.”
Daniel nodded and asked, “you need any help finding them?”
He put the bag away and said, “very well. Very exciting.” He waited for a response but none of them were excited enough to respond. “Alright, Mr. Potter you are first.” His heart dropped down to his feet.
Fred backed him up, “you seem to be right. Our sister is here and where else do we belong but by her side?”
Adrian looked up at the big house on the hill. It was still far away as he had just passed the outskirts of town. He couldn’t see many details from where he was now. He had stopped to admire it before he could move towards it again a voice spoke to him, “bad way about that house.”
Adrian responded, “I’m not sure.” He moved the steaks off the fire and told them, “We should eat up. Probably some idiot with his wand.” This was followed by another loud bang and some screams. It could’ve been screams of joy or screams of terror. She couldn’t tell. Adrian squinted in the direction of the noises. He picked up a steak and took a bite of it. He swallowed and said, “Mine.”
Mrs. Weasley removed the letters and began handing them out to everyone. Even Arlene, Luna, Harry, and Hermione got their Hogwarts letters. Dumbledore seemed to be excellent at tracking people. Arlene didn’t like that fact.
The rest of the professors came running down. In the lead was Professor Barnes. He scooped her up in a hug and exclaimed, “that was one of the best uses of field alchemy I have ever seen!” This was immediately followed by him glaring at her and asking, “now why did you come in first when you were planning on flopping?”
Arlene watched as she put it on. She told her, “I got it mailed here a week ago. It has protective charms put on it so it will keep you safe from small dangers.” Arlene put on her new necklace and told her, “I love this so much. You did this all yourself and you did a great job of it.”
Adrian’s breathing normalized and he stood up. He wiped the sweat off his brow. He saw Ludo Bagman trying to leave the room with a scared look on his face. He grabbed the man by his collar and spun him. He barked at him, “no, you look. This is what you wanted. This is what you made.” He roughly shoved at him.
Joan’s gift to her was a pair of dragonhide boots. She had a strong suspicion that Joan and Adrian had worked together on their gifts. She told her, “thank you. These are just my size too. How did you know?”
Adrian Pov.
The fire stopped as he hands shook. Sweat formed on her forehead. She tried to swallow but her mouth was dry. She gritted her teeth and gathered her magic. With a scream she threw a fist of wind at the spider. It slammed into a front leg with enough force to break the exoskeleton. It screeched and limped backwards.
With that settled Adrian left again and apparated to the Ministry of Magic. He popped into the atrium and checked in at the desk. This time he didn’t get a funny look from the clerk. He took that as a good sign. It was a fifty/fifty chance on getting an odd look or not when his name came up. If someone recognized that they were talking to an ex-professional murderer.
Arlene stood up and said, “hold on, I might be able to help.” She left and went back up to Ravenclaw tower. She reached the knocker alone.
When they reached the Great Hall Ginny asked her, “do you feel like talking about what you said in class?”
Ginny rolled her eyes and said, “We need to get lined up guys. McGonagall is throwing a fit about us being presentable.”
“Nice one dad.” Fred said from inside the tent. The twins came out and greeted everyone together, “Good morning everyone.” Everyone greeted them back but Joan went inside the tent. She still didn’t like their synchronization.
She kept that face and said, “they showed me that you close your eyes and something magical happens.”
One of the boys wined, “bicorns? Why not something actually interesting?”
Barty told him, “Tom got free of Dumbledore’s control. We need to find him before Lucius does. Dumbledore still doesn’t know that we’re working against him. We know the truth of Tom Riddle but not many others do. He’ll be hiding. He might try to find Harry Potter to get the truth to him.”
As they stood there Luna began talking to her. “Arlene, can I ask you an odd question?” Arlene was confused and simply nodded. “If you care about it all would you prefer a boyfriend or girlfriend? I won’t judge you either way.”
Luna was the first to say anything. “I would love to. I’ve never had the chance to give blood. It sounds like something nice to do.” She looked at the flyer and went on, “it’s tomorrow. We can go in the afternoon after we get our homework done.”
Luna giggled and said, “I know. We should do it again. This time you kiss me.”
Arlene raised an eyebrow. “You could fit the Great Hall in the lobby of it. It has billions of books.” She didn’t mean to sound so snobby about it but she was being honest.
Surprised, Adrian told them, “that’s more information than I was expecting. I have a real name to work with. I can track that.”
In the end the game had a surprising twist. Victor Krum, Bulgaria’s seeker, caught the snitch but the Irish had scored so much they had over a hundred and fifty point lead. The game ended on Bulgaria’s terms but the Irish won.
The three of them managed to make small talk and laughed. Ginny even sat with them at the Ravenclaw table through dinner. Many Gryffindors and Ravenclaws looked on them oddly for this. Then Fred and George came over.
Ron shook his head. “I can’t now. We all worked too hard to get here. We should all win. What will they say if we all grab it at once?”
They began walking around the clearing looking for anything. It was obvious that there was nothing that would stop a rampaging dragon. Only trees surrounded them. Thick and old trees but not thick enough to stop a multi-ton beast. They would be enough to stop fire blasts though. He could jump up to the higher branches to get off spell from up high. Jumping high and falls weren’t a concern as long as he could cast the right spell.
Adrian responded first, “Meh, it was mostly a check-up. Nothing major.” Joan sputtered but didn’t contradict him. She got the feeling that he wasn’t being entirely honest about his injuries but as long as he was alive and safe she didn’t mind.
He turned to see an old man standing next to him. He remained where he was and asked, “what makes you say that?” He nodded towards him and introduced himself with a fake name, “Evan.”
He answered, “after my first paycheck! I had been trapped in one place my whole life so I wanted to go see the world. Of course the pyramids were on the list.” They reached the gate and passed outside of Hogwarts grounds. He took her hand and said, “hold on to me tightly.” He caught the broom he had summoned.
“Weasley twins do something while I was gone?”
Lee Jordan was doing the commentary and he called out, “Harry Potter has just performed a summoning charm! He wants his broom. Perhaps he wants to outmaneuver the dragon.”
For the rest of the day he sat in his office and graded essays, wrote tests, and took a shot of fire whiskey with Joan before dinner. They went to the Halloween feast that was also the choosing of the champions. The feast was the usual as far as feasts at Hogwarts went.
“Adrian, where these built by slaves?” She wasn’t sure if she wanted to know.
So, I feel weird about chapter six, so in case no one likes it I'll post chapter seven now.
He put away the radio and asked her, “please tell me why you feel the desire to fight one of the strongest apex predators on the planet?” He leaned back but she could tell he was tense.
She got an annoyed look on her face but answered, “yes, you’re the only person that I want to date. I want it to be serious too.”
From behind him Harry asked, “I think we’re alone now. What did you want to talk about?”
“Believe me professor, I wish the same thing.” Despite having a unique form of magic but it would be nice to able to use her wand. It did choose her for some reason after all. It would be nice to know why her wand had bothered choosing someone who couldn’t even use it. There had to be something behind it.
George added, “great thing about being us is that most people will listen to us. And so, we have influenced the public to our favor.”
Arlene’s heart rate spiked up. A cold sweat broke on her hands. She had to fight to keep her breathing steady. Either something absolutely fantastic was about to happen or something terribly horrible. She had no clues to either one. Her mouth went dry as she forced out, “do you feel like telling?”
Arlene Pov.
The rest of lunch went uneventfully but by the end of it almost everyone felt much better. Conversation had picked back up. Fred and George were cracking jokes again. Everyone was laughing and for a few hours they forgot about the World Cup.
A fist connected with Skeeter’s jaw. She crumpled to the ground like a rag doll as Joan screamed, “I’VE NEVER KILLED A CHILD YOU FUCKING BITCH! FUCK YOU!” McGonagall and Bagman held her back. She didn’t escape them even though she could’ve easily.
She turned to Adrian and asked him, “is there anything you wanted to look at?”
Bastion’s voice called to her, “Connery, can we talk please?”
He winced and ran away. They all noted that he did not have a partner. The Slytherin girl Malfoy was partnered with gave an impressed nod as to how he had handled the situation. They turned and headed back towards the dance floor. She couldn't help, but notice him glance at Harry.
As the day went on more and more people got up and began showing their support for one team or another. The game was Bulgaria versus Ireland. The majority were for Ireland but many also loved Bulgaria’s seeker, Victor Krum. Ron was especially infatuated with him.
He spat water everywhere with panic controlling him. He burst out, “after we what?!” He calmed down when he saw Joan laughing so hard she had to lean against the doorway. He wiped the water from his bare chest and commented, “hilarious. I was afraid I had gotten laid for the first time in two and a half years and not remembered.”
In her mind there should be concern over what happened at the game last night. On the outside everything was calm and peaceful. It was a strange combination. At least if someone else was awake then there would be someone to talk to.
All the students exited the Hall except for those that Adrian had adopted and their close friends. Two of them had graduated and move out last year. Harry now lived with Remus and Sirius so it was just four now. They gathered in a circle around him and Joan and he asked, “do any of you have any desire to participate in this thing?” Arlene kept her hand down. Only one of them raised their hand. Adrian responded, “if I give you ten thousand galleons will you not put your name in the Goblet?”
She still wasn’t sure if she should fail on purpose or try to pass. Then again she might not be able to pass even if she wanted to. She had her own magic. There were some spells she could do subtly but most of the stronger ones would be obvious. She could try to pass it off to her wand but someone with a good eye might see it not come from the tip.
“She helped me and Professor Barnes fight off some crazy guy. I guess I made myself memorable.” Arlene had thought that she would want to forget the whole ordeal. It did get her a free drink so she didn’t mind that much that she remembered. The kidnapping she could’ve done without.
He knew he was a muggle and that meant his burial was a muggle affair. So he would have to check the muggle records. He apparated to the closest to that office he had ever been. It was a short walk to the office. He went in and went to the first desk he saw.
Arlene simply raised her hand but didn’t say anything.
It was the day after the first trial and he had taken the day off to visit his island. Specifically the spot where Sirius and Remus were preparing the spell to resurrect Voldemort. In his pocket he held a vial of his own blood. Blood of the enemy. He mentally considered Voldemort his enemy for being a threat to Harry and Ginny. It had literally been part of Voldemort’s soul that had possessed Ginny in his first year at Hogwarts. So now he didn’t like him and wanted answers. Specifically two: was Dumbledore a threat to his kids? And did Voldemort have anything to do with murdering his wife and daughter?
“Wow! An incredible jump from Connery! No one expected that one!” There’s a lot you won’t see coming from me! She leaped at a rock outcrop just avoiding a jet of fire. The rock was horizontal enough for her to run along it and use it to jump from. She launched herself at another rock and landed on it. A gasp ran through the crowd.
“I am going to high five her multiple times in the face with extreme force,” He said as he directed her towards the exit of the Great Hall. Ginny loved that idea but knew it was important to find Arlene right now. “Professor Winters is searching for her as well.” They left the Great Hall.
When Luna and she walked into the Great Hall they found the other champions waiting. Professor McGonagall was there fussing over all the details. Krum was with Hermione as his partner. Harry stood next to Parvati and Ron had Padma but he kept looking at Hermione. The two champions from Beauxbatons had yet to arrive.
Ginny was surprised to hear clapping and cheering. She peeked around the corner to see everyone clapping for Arlene. She was confused and saw that Arlene was too. Then her two brothers, Fred and George stood up and explained to the three of them, “we’re all happy to see the girl who’s so talented that she can make it to the second round of the Triwizard tournament without using a wand!”
Two sets of feet came down the stairs as Fred and George came down the stairs. They sat next to Arlene and chorused, “hello Arlene.”
Please be me, please be me, please be me.
Protests and shouts of outrage range across the room, mostly from Gryffindor house, as students grew angry from the age restriction.
“As much as I could,” she answered and sat with him. He pushed a cup of coffee towards her. “Thanks,” she told him. It was still warm but she could tell it had been sitting out for a while.
Arlene began the long climb up the stairs. She reached the top of the astronomy tower and found Joan waiting at the top. Professor Winters waved at her and said, “hey, how was your first day back?”
What Barty did understand was that he had just seen something intimidating. As a Dumbledore who looked fifty years younger now stood before him. He didn’t even think it was possible to literally drink from the Goblet of Fire. He hid his surprise well. He had hidden many things from people over the years.
Perfect copies of himself split from his body and spread out. Ten of them with the real Bastion making eleven. Adrian knew the spell. They were just illusions. They couldn’t cast spells or interact with the physical world. The copies could distract a dragon though.
Mother nesting dragons scared normal dragons.
Barty Crouch Jr. Pov
They got in and rode the elevator to the surface. When they got to the top they did the process to get in but in reverse. Leave shed, go behind column, turn invisible, fly away on broom, return to hotel roof. They got their suitcases and Adrian apparated them to the beach house so she could drop off the restricted book. Then he apparated them to Hogwarts.
That was the first time anyone had ever used the word ‘perchance’ on her. She shrugged it off. “My name is Arlene Connery and I have a favor to ask.”
“It went well. I did some light meditation,” he told her. “I see the school hasn’t fallen apart.”
They did leave to go outside and see the outside decorations. On their way out the door they almost ran into Rita Skeeter but she was intercepted by Adrian. He zoomed past them and got into her face while saying, “no, turn your lying ass around and get off my school grounds.” The photographer tried to take a picture of him but he snatched the camera away and slammed it to the ground. It shattered into pieces and he spat at the creepy man, “bill me.” Rita turned around and ran from him.
Arlene sighed at the new mystery but this confirmed that her family was connected to dragons. It also confirmed that someone who had known her mother was alive. Even if they weren’t human. “Thank you. I will tell them to be careful. They don’t mean to be cruel. They are scared and deluded.” Thera understood. She turned to the handlers and told them, “be gentle with her. Take good care of her eggs.” Then she left the stadium.
She shrugged and answered, honestly, “I have no idea.”
She smiled. Luna’s smiles were always so pretty. “Yes, I’ll be fine. Go learn more about your magic.” Luna skipped off to her next class.
Adrian was still partially in shock. Sirius’s words rocked him from it. He was able to answer, “someone set us up. The Triwizard cup is a portkey that was supposed to take the winner back to the entrance to the maze. Someone tampered with it so it would take them to us. That same someone told the death eaters where to find us and when to show up.”
He didn’t answer at first. Then he puffed out his chest and announced proudly, “Madame Maxine is coming over for tea. She’s walking over now.” He looked back out the window and said, “I’m sorry but I’m going to have to ask for some privacy between us.”
Adrian had no patience left. He came out from behind the grave and flung two explosion spells at the approaching figures. They were close enough for him to see they were wearing masks.
Adrian explained, “the door can only be opened by magical peoples. It is a public library so security isn’t that big of an issue that I can see.”
George responded, “yeah, so are we.”
small, light sex scene, literally three paragraphs, it is marked with PAGE BREAK at beginning and end for those not interested. You will not miss any plot by skipping it.
The twins said, “so are we.”
Arlene asked, “are you worried about anything?”
The worry and fear that had rooted him in place stayed on the ground. He rose in the air far above the highest seats of the stadium. Once there he surveyed the scene before him. The dragon was right over her eggs. He was going to have to get her to move.
There was a man in a uniform waiting for them. He extended a hand and said something in a language she didn’t understand. Adrian said some words to him in the same language and the uniformed man led them to a door on the roof. He opened the door for them and it opened to the ground floor lobby. She could tell it was the ground floor from the windows on the other side that gave a view of the street.
