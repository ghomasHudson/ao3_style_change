The more politically acute have watched Britain’s broader population have debates over whether magicals should be considered ‘the same’ as ‘normal’ folk for months now. And while any attempts to start reducing magicals to second-class citizens have not taken root so far, for all that none of the more objectionable policies have actually been passed, the ones amongst wizards who have kept an eye on things on the muggle side, still heard the mentions of registration acts and publicly worn identifiers. And they certainly haven’t forgotten how crimes committed against theirs almost always seem to go unpunished.
It’s only after things start admittedly going a little downhill in their country amongst the general population, too many attacks levied at the magical citizens, the leeway given to the normal people in their country apparently having sent the wrong signal to some of them, that the balance shifts a little.
They have done their due diligence, they prepared for this, figured out a couple of weak spots – if only for leverage’s sake – to apply pressure to if needed, and made sure they know enough about the other’s strengths to not be taken off guard.
Harry knows better. He knows that, magical or muggle, people are just people. Including all the good and all the bad that is inherent to that particular denominator.
Thus, their intel might have been correct about Magical Britain being absolutely unwilling to start another war. But. They only realize now that, concurrently, Magical Britain is perfectly prepared to
A consensus about how they got lucky, how they have it comparatively easy where dealing with their magical counterpart is concerned.
The point is, when the news of the muggles finding out reached Magical Britain, quite a number of people promptly got in contact with Harry, just to let him know that they’ve taken note of the new development and are available in case something happens that Harry might need a couple of extra sets of hands for.
So, considering all those facts, they are rather certain of their capability to make the magicals fold exactly as they need them to, certain that the wizards will be so very intent on peace that they’ll sooner concede to any demands made of them, than they’d willingly risk another war.
But, in the end, only the children survive. After having held out against all odds for fear of what might be done to their children if they were no longer available to perform the magic demanded of them, the parents hold out just long enough to see their children once more safe in wizarding hands. Before giving in, following Death’s soothing call beckoning for them.
However, when planning for this meeting, their side had expected diplomacy and willingness to compromise, especially from the wizarding representatives.
Draco Malfoy, presiding over the Wizengamot for several years running now, voted into position mere years after he took up his family seats, the first to abolish voting by ‘party affiliations’, ensuring voting by issues instead of voting by loyalties.
So, while some of them might be a little uncomfortable with the idea of having to deal with the two not-so-human members of the council – a goblin and a vampire, they are told – they also do not really worry.
Regrettably, the bomb that was supposed to take out the Leaky Cauldron still goes off. However, as the new wards hold, the only damage done is to the non-magical side of things.
Mind you, it’s not like they have… spies in the British Ministry of Magic as such, not really. But there are numerous relatives of magicals who heard all of the stories excitedly told by children coming home from their magical school, happy to share the information now that the Statute of Secrecy no longer promises punishments for doing so. Which isn’t even mentioning the squibs, some of whom even having grown up in the magical world, all of them at least slightly resentful at having been driven from the magical world when they were children, more often than not simply left to fend for themselves in a world without magic which they knew nothing about. There are even a few muggleborn wizards who, when approached by the government, were happy enough to find themselves drawn into ‘special task forces’ for their ‘expertise’, helping them better ‘understand’ each other.
Their counter offer which is effectively a council of several people, designed to only act during times of conflict, to be mostly useless in peace times but to supersede even the Minister’s office itself, in times of war, only remaining answerable to the Wizengamot itself.
, Harry thinks to himself somewhat sardonically as Magical Britain continues on with their day-to-day as though nothing at all has changed, undeterred by the world shifting under their very feet and all around them.
If the last war taught Magical Britain anything, it’s to draw the line sooner rather than later, not to wait until you have started losing rights and freedoms you were never prepared to let go of, when your home has already turned into a caricature of itself. They know to keep the opposing side from ever gaining any leverage to exploit, to protect your weak spots, to bring everything you care about to safety with you.
If they have no choice, if they are going to be forced into yet another war no matter their preferences to the contrary, if only to protect the peace they themselves created, then they’ll make sure to wage it
Because they remember the terror brought about by one of their own just a few years ago, remember the many deaths, the constant fear holding an entire nation in its grip. They remember and they can accept that even muggles might need a bit of an adjustment period after finding out about magic, after having their worldview shifted so brutally and unexpectedly.
Ron Weasley and Susan Bones, Aurors working his way up the ranks, already having made Squad Leaders years ago, the youngest Aurors to ever do so, if only because the higher-ups quickly realized that any of the newer recruits, anyone of the ‘Golden Generation’ – as they tend to be called in the press – and especially those who might ever have been part of ‘Dumbledore’s army’ or its offshoots, will always follow one of their Generals’ commands than anything their actual superiors might ever order them to do.
Even Harry is somewhat surprised at how far the muggles are willing to go and how quickly they got to that point.
The fact that their country’s magical side only just fought a war and that they now want peace more than anything else. So, negotiating with them, making them concede wherever needed or preferred, should be
So, as he makes his way towards the not-so-accessible parts of the Ministry of Magic – the Department of Mysteries that he, as non-Ministry personnel, should not have access to but by value of being who he is still does – for his usual afternoon tea with Hermione, Harry thinks almost absently about potential future fallout and possible consequences, runs through a couple worst-case scenarios in his head, the horrors he knows people – wizards and muggles alike – to be capable of.
Because, while nothing really changes for magical societies anywhere, all of them of course having always been aware of the non-magical side of the world, the same isn’t true for muggles. And it doesn’t take long for the first more radical factions to form amongst the non-magical portion of their world. Radical, on both sides of the spectrum.
Turns out, the ordinary citizens of Great Britain already managed to use up any good-will the magicals might have been willing to bring to the table.
Because, Harry Potter might have chosen not to join the Ministry officially, against all expectations not joining the Auror corps and instead becoming some sort of curse-breaker – though the general population still hasn’t quite figured out just
It’s designed for maximum devastation, a bomb deliberately planted right at the entrance to one of the busiest wizarding districts in Europe, its location having been leaked by some government official at some point, enough explosives to take a good chunk of Diagon Alley with it.
Beneath their feet, magic rumbles, an ever-increasing growling roll of thunder building as Albion’s ancient fury rises at the affront, at the crimes done to some of hers.
Because, at least in this, for once the magical governments are actually a little ahead of their muggle counterparts. In that there are laws with the sole purpose of protecting muggles from whatever dangers might reach for them from the magical world, laws that forbid anyone with magic to go after muggles, one of the foundations of the ICW for any member nations to adhere to.
There are no protections provided to wizards in the muggle world. And once the wrong sort of muggles realize as much, the fallout is devastating.
They may want to keep the peace they only gained so recently. But, if it comes down to it, if given no other choice, they are more than willing to go to war in order to defend the peace they fought so hard for.
They got jobs, most of them in the Ministry itself, but quite a few also in a variety of relevant but unconnected fields, all of them intent on
All of the more popular wizarding locations within Britain have already been warded with this exact ward scheme and the goblins are still making the rounds to any private wizarding residences, handsomely compensated by the Ministry to do so ‘free of charge’ for the residents.
The ‘Council of Five’ as it quickly becomes known, made up of three wizards and/or witches, one goblin representative, and one magical creature representative, be they werewolf, veela, vampire, centaur or anything along those lines, to be voted into office by their own people respectively.
Admittedly, Harry knows that his view point is also somewhat unique, his knowledge of both worlds, his equally-not-so-great experiences in the magical and the muggle world, his childhood full of getting to see the very worst in people on both sides, the knowledge that, magical or muggle, people are still fundamentally the same, still mostly looking out for themselves and theirs, capable of endless kindness and self-sacrificial love for family and friends, but so easily steered by their fears of the unknown, and purely apathetic towards those they’d call strangers.
The peace they fought so hard for and lost so much for is barely a few years in the making, not a full decade yet since the Light won and then spent another few years struggling with itself while trying to find a balance between victory and oppression, a balance between Light and Dark for once that would not see either side as
In the first couple of weeks after the Uncovering, he has a number of heated arguments about the willful devaluating of entire swaths of what are just normal people for no other reason than due to their lack of magic, not only with friends and colleagues but also in his own home. Then again, he has always found the heated arguments and the just-as-heated reconciliations are one of his favorite parts about his relationship. Lest his life ever get even close to boring.
There are also some countries that get entirely stuck between the two factions of their citizens, no willingness to compromise on either side and thus no progress being made whatsoever.
And as weaknesses of wizarding folk and magical creatures alike are blared around the muggle world, sometimes honest, scientific discussions driven by simple curiosity, sometimes religious zeal or envious hatred swelling below. But always the wrong sort of muggles taking note.
Even most muggles are aghast at everything that particular investigation turns up, but their sudden sympathy changes nothing at that point.
However, especially Magical Britain, with its recent war and years of infighting and barely having attained the peace they now live in, can accept that those scattered attacks against wizards and witches that start popping around the world cannot be blamed on muggles as a whole. They even accept that the muggles’ fear is somewhat understandable, accept that no law enforcement or regent in the world can control each and every single one of their subjects.
Hannah Abbot, having reformed the entire Department of Magical Creatures even before being voted in as its Minister, the youngest leader of a Ministry Department in Magical Britain’s history. Her department is now one of cooperation instead one of regulation.
It’s reassuring. More than. It makes them confident that, even in case of an actual conflict, their side would still have the upper hand over the magicals.
You can’t just decide that someone is your political leader without at least asking their opinion on the matter.
The first couple of meetings with the Minister of Magic on one side and their group of experts and politicians and representatives on the other go rather smoothly, a few assurances made, but nothing really set into stone. At least not on their own side. Just as they prefer it.
They don’t want another war. But they certainly won’t hand over their hard-won peace to anyone else either.
Blaise, Hannah, and Draco share a sly sort of grin at their success, finally seeing their efforts to get some of the other magical races at least somewhat represented in their Ministry bearing fruit.
, just like most others around him, that his fears of how bad things might get would prove over-the-top, just post-war paranoia once more making itself known. It’s disappointing to find all of his fears confirmed. Then again, he is all the more glad at the knowledge that his group prepared for the worst-case scenario anyway, despite their willingness to hope, to believe in the good of humanity.
Harry, of course, absolutely agrees with the idea of the mixed council. Though, he isn’t particularly enthused to find himself promptly elected the leader of what is effectively a war council after all. The vote is almost unanimous and thus he hesitates to refuse the position right then and there, considering that they are in rather turbulent times at the moment, the conflict with the muggles ever-brewing on the horizon.
Not that they actually manage to fulfill any of those promises they made, their politicians far too worried about losing voters if they were to be seen to be on the magicals’ side instead of that of their normal citizens, any bills suggested for discussion promptly shot down by those opposing any sort of compromise with the magical side of their country.
Blaise Zabini and Daphne Greengrass, somehow already Undersecretaries to the Minister of International Magical Cooperation, and, if rumors are to be believed, already far more entrenched in any international political behind-closed-doors negotiations than the current Minister of the department himself or even than the last couple of Ministers in that position ever managed.
He finds his fears confirmed once the muggles start figuring out some of the general magical population’s weaknesses. Things like their dependency on wands, the fact that even a trained wizard is comparatively helpless without one, or the fact that, while adult wizards and witches are not only hard to catch out as magical but even more difficult to then keep a hold of, the same isn’t true for children. Children who don’t have their magic under control, don’t know how to fight back, and are so easily driven into accidental magic, unwillingly giving their family away as magical.
The point is, those of Harry’s generation are used to working together, whether they may agree on any of the potentially raised issues or not. They will not repeat the mistakes of their parents’ and break their society clean in half based on what ultimately amounts to simple political opinions and cultural understanding.
They are certain that it will be easy to make the wizards bow to their demands if they need to go the slightly more oppressive route in order to placate their non-magical voters.
So, Magical Britain looks at its current Minister and decides that, while decent enough in peace times, they’d much prefer to have someone who has proven themselves willing to fight for Magical Britain as a whole in that position, someone whose motives they do not need question, who will fight for anyone no matter their race, background, or political allegiances.
As much as they might be willing to try for a compromise, them simply giving in, simply accepting whatever another group of people might want to do to them and theirs, them
So, with their intel gathered and their certainty of being able to make the wizards fold if needed, they reassure their voters, make promises as to what they will get the magical side to agree to. Because it’s important for the normal citizens of their country to know that it won’t be them who’ll be paying the necessary price for a compromise between the two factions in their country.
So, he watches. And waits for the fallout that he knows is coming for them, as much as he might hope otherwise.
Then there are countries like Japan, where belief in the supernatural has always been part of normal life, so-called superstition never having been something to be ridiculed, belief systems where the existence of something beyond that which normal people can perceive has always been simply assumed, and thus the ‘revelation’ of magic being part of their world garnering little more than a vague shrug and an agreeing hum and nothing really beyond a few debates on the issue from their citizens. That, however, seems to only apply to their own people, the entirety of Japan turning perfectly isolationist, refusing to permit even a single magical being from anywhere else into their country.
No one on their side entirely knows how to feel about the sudden change. Alas, while their country’s magicals might be subjects of the Crown, they have also always had complete autonomy in how they run their side of the government. So, they simply have no right to interfere.
, working their way up the ladder and wasting no time in working on overhauling the Ministry as they went, pushing through reform after reform after reform, until their ruling body had turned into something that all of them – no matter which side of the supposed-to-be-opposed Light and Dark factions they grew up on or maybe chose along the way – can live with.
But old habits die hard and he was their leader – even if a mostly absent one due to circumstances that had him chasing various tidbits of Voldemort around their country – during the war and they all seem to generally live by the rule of ‘when in doubt, see what Harry is planning’.
He likes working independently, likes the way it afforded him the luxury of traveling the world for months at a time for a few years when he felt like getting away from Britain. Likes how his independence now lends itself rather well to family planning, as he’s recently been considering more and more often…
The muggle black market for magical goods – mostly for the trade of magical plants and items, but also quite a few magical creatures and even, to everyone’s horror,
A… sort-of-interlude? But also plot? Kind of? I just really of wanted to write something about the non-magical side of things, so here you go :D Also, the derisive tone and definitely-not-pc phrasing at certain points of this is very much on purpose to help set the tone of the interactions. Still, hope those bits weren’t too off-putting to read...
Neville Longbottom, the youngest Deputy Headmaster in Hogwarts’ history, pushing through the addition of just as many new subjects and classes to the Hogwarts curriculum as he insists on reinstating some of the more traditional ones that have been abolished over the years.
He is still absolutely determined to knock some sense into Magical Britain’s general population at the first opportunity.
The world is holding its breath, waiting for the fallout, but at least in the beginning the various magical and non-magical nations continue to tiptoe around each other, neither one wanting to alienate the other side entirely if they can help it. Everyone is still trying to feel each other out, trying to come to terms with this new state of the world for all that it’s only the muggles who have to adjust to the ‘revelation’ at all, have to get used to the sudden knowledge of the long-established balance of their societies, a balance that has existed for centuries but just outside of what muggles perceive of the world.
Not that he himself actually joined the Ministry in any fashion, instead choosing to go the independent curse-breaker route, no interest whatsoever in spending years of denying everyone’s hassling him to take on the seat of Minister of Magic, as he is sure things would have turned out if he had followed his original, childhood plan of becoming an Auror. No, he is good right where he is. More than, actually.
Harry stares at the Daily Prophet spread out on the breakfast table in front of him, the headline mocking him.
The rest of the population falls somewhere in between, reactions ranging from uncaring to curious. But barely anyone seems to be giving thought to a potential
Quite a few representatives from other countries have grumbled at them about how they envy the UK for how easy they’ll have it to reign in their magical citizens, how comparatively simple their task of integrating the magical side of their country with the non-magical side will be, how they’ll likely face little if any resistance if they are forceful enough about their demands.
Even the broader wizarding population agrees with that, no matter which side of the war they might have originally been on, by the end of it, everyone had been equally desperate to put an end to the endless fighting.
Hermione Granger and Luna Lovegood, lead researchers in the Department of Mysteries, forever pushing boundaries with their inventions, just as happy to delve into archaic magics as they are to integrate muggle science with magic itself, or even coming up with something entirely new, bending reality towards things that even by wizarding understanding shouldn’t be possible, the two, so contrasting in mindset, witches working together, leading to a surplus of inventions, additions of new magics the likes of which Magical Britain hasn’t seen in centuries.
They suggest compromises, most of them very much along the lines of the policies Britain’s Ministry of Magic has been trying to get them to agree to for weeks now.
been people in the UK’s Ministry who have known about magic, the Crown has seen to that, keeping the right people in the right places informed, even if those on the outside and not-in-the-know never quite realized what those specific departments might have been actually for.
With the Magical World showing its far more uncompromising side, their muggle counterpart suddenly seems far more eager to invest into upholding any kind of balance between their worlds. Instead of solely catering to their muggle voters as most muggle politicians have been doing up until that point.
compromise. And who is currently surrounded by four individuals, all of whom seem more than happy to ensure that he will not have to.
It snowballs. Far too quickly for the magical governments of the world to get a handle on. By the time they realize the snowballing uncovering of their world to the eyes of the broader non-magical side of the populations, it’s far too late to do anything about it..
Add to that, the fact that magicals can be easily corralled just by taking their wands away, more or less rendering them incapable of using magic in any directed manner, and the fact that there are rather harsh laws on the side of the magical government against ever using any sort of magic against normal people…
Ahead of this particular meeting, their own side had already decided to focus most of their efforts on making the wizarding side of the council bend to their will, if only because they are ones who fought the last war and they also have the majority on this council and, thus, they are clearly the easiest and most effective lever to try and apply pressure to.
But sharing this newest invention of theirs costs them nothing and it’s always good to have a couple of allies, especially considering how things might yet develop between the magical and muggle world around the globe.
He agrees, to the surprise of no one, his own friends knowing him too well to think he'd ever refuse and the general population never even having considered he might deny them something they want. One day Harry is going to learn how to say no. Surely.
By that time, certain groups within Britain’s Ministry of Magic has already started laying down the groundwork for various just-in-case contingency plans, Harry’s generation once more closing ranks. Because, they see their hard-won peace being threatened from the outside, and that is unacceptable to all of them, no matter their political allegiances.
"Oh come on," Harry laughed. He knew by now that it all had to be a joke. Seamus snorted and burst into laughter.
Lucius travels to London to take care of some business and to try to track down his amulet that he suspects Draco has sold to fund his studies, and he promises he'll try to find out what really happened with the Amortentia while he's there. He's too proud to confront Draco about it personally, but Narcissa doesn't blame him. The war took so much from him, his son not among the least valuable things.
“Don’t tell me you’re having Malfoy do interrogations with you now?” Theodore scoffed. “I don’t want to imagine your methods, if that’s the case.”
Eventually he decided to just write "passed out" and find the appropriate treatment. He was flipping through pages of his course material (a thick, black book that almost resembled the Bible in its compact shape and thin pages) when the word "amortentia" flashed briefly in his eyesight. He flipped back a couple of pages and found a chapter called "Treating Patients Under the Influence of Love Potions". He read a couple sentences here and there, trying to find the bit about Amortentia.
It was already towards the end of the lecture when Harry remembered the conversation he had had with Neville the previous night.
Malfoy didn’t answer. He was giving Harry a once-over, and Harry quickly looked down to check his fly wasn’t open or something.
“You did just call him Draco," Hermione pointed out. “So you don’t want Ron to know that you want to be friends with Draco?”
"I think the words you're looking for are 'thank you', not 'I'm sorry'. Apologizing makes it sound like, as if - it's fucking frustrating because of course you're going to get a fucking panic attack after being in the mirror, you know? It's not as if you did something wrong."
"It isn't." Draco's face remained neutral and Harry was grateful for it, because at that moment, at least privately Harry was a blushing mess of restlessness and fidgeting. He couldn't quite put a finger on why he was at a loss for words all of a sudden - that sort of thing didn't happen to him often.
“We got a whole parliament,” George said, but only his wife chuckled. “You know, a flock of owls is called… Ah, nevermind.”
“Actually," Harry said as the idea hit him, “we have to write a paper where we interview someone we consider a hero.”
“Certainly,” Theodore said. “Yes, I have nothing but time to stand around here waiting for you to finish wanking each other so you might question me about the murder. I wonder what your supervisor would say if he knew?”
"It's a yes," Draco said. "But it's… it wouldn't be easy. We'd get hurt, we'd both get hurt. And we'll hurt other people."
Draco felt unease taking over him as he realized the situation. He hadn't really given it much thought before, but now... It would never be over for Harry. Being in danger, sacrificing himself for everyone. Being a hero. What an absolute idiot, Draco thought. Worry made a wrinkle on the bridge of his nose.
Harry, Neville and Hermione spend a rainy Saturday indoors. How will Hermione react when Harry finally works up the courage to bring up the topic of Draco Malfoy?
“Yes,” Neville said. “She said she had always heard great things about the Hogwarts greenhouses, so she wanted to visit them before leaving. She said nothing grows from where she’s from, not even in greenhouses. So I showed her around, and she was very impressed with my Knotgrass.”
Careful not to wake Draco up, Harry rolled over and reached for his glasses as well as  Remus’ letter that still lay on the floor from the previous night. Harry had forgotten all about it when Draco had showed up, but now he was already anxious to read it. As per usual, he had promised to write to Remus and Tonks often and then forgotten all about it as the term had started getting more intense. Well, this time for different reasons than before, but still. After slowly, slowly ripping open the envelope, trying to make as little noise as possible, Harry pulled out the letter and unfolded it.
“And you," Harry said, raising his wand at the animagus, “if you ever blabber about my business to him again-”
“Then, my lad, I suppose you will just have to come up with a large enough amount of pumpkin tarts to bribe me with. The same works for surprisingly many Dark Arts practitioners, I’ve noticed… If you ask me, the only reason we have all these goons lurking about these days is that there is that people have started to worry about eating too much sugar. What a ghastly existence…” One of professor Toadsworth’s assistants coughed politely and interrupted the professor’s trail of thought. “Oh, yes. Of course - let’s begin, shall we?”
“Not for this potion, usually, but… Well, to me it would only make sense. Just the smell is making me feel better.”
For a moment, it was quiet. Draco's heart sank as he realized the situation, and just like he always did when he was taken aback, he started stumbling over his words.
"Isn't… Wasn't Tonks' mother Draco's mother's sister?" Aware of how incoherent he sounded, Harry tried again. "What I meant is-"
“I know what it says,” Harry interrupted and took the clipping. “There’s more to it. Do you know who the new heir is?”
Harry realized people were staring at them. He let go of Draco’s hand, unaware that he had still been holding onto it.
One day in the early summer of 2001 Lucius tells Narcissa about his plan and at first, she doesn't like it. Lucius promises to not go through with it, at least not yet. Narcissa won't admit it, but she still hopes they won't have to intervene. That her son won't return to Darthorn for his second year, that he will return to them on his own after having suffered enough. She knows it's not right for a mother to wish that, but she can't help it. She misses her son and knows he must be lonely without his family, without his old friends. And Narcissa is angry with him, of course she is - for stealing from Lucius, for disrespecting him so blatantly, and even for leaving when Lucius told him to in the fit of his anger. Draco should have known better, he should have shown more loyalty to his family, if not to his father then at least to Narcissa.
In that way, Draco was still the same. He wasn’t particularly fond of children, he wore carefully chosen black turtlenecks and the same swept-back haircut he had sported for years, he was reserved, easily jealous and enjoyed life most when he had a good book in one hand and Harry pressed against his side. It was work papers instead of comic books that Harry read now, but this habit of reading together was one they had managed to hold onto over the years.
Draco leaned his face onto his palm. Harry found out not longer than a few seconds later that as he had said that, Draco had met eyes with Seamus Finnigan who had been in the middle of sneaking out of the dormitory.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” Draco said as he noticed Harry staring. “I’m gonna put the due date for Wednesday. That’s not too suspicious.”
Perhaps that was why it felt so impossible for Draco to leave without a single book. In the end, he chose a worn-down copy of Flowers for Algernon, which Draco had enchanted to also contain some Murakami short stories and a collection of cheap crime novels. He would have called the latter a guilty pleasure if he hadn’t decided to discontinue feeling guilty for trivial things a few years back. It had been a champagne-drunk pact he had made with Hermione, and secretly he had kept it.
“Looks like these people have better things to do," Draco muttered. “Let’s go to a library instead. Muggles have libraries, right?”
“I just realized," Harry said, barely containing his smile, “that when you go, Neville will be the only straight guy left in the dorm.”
“Ah, but that’s old news now, isn’t it," Ron said, giving a grin. “No but seriously - I don’t want to end up an old geezer who keeps boring his grandkids to death by telling the same story over and over, about how he once did something important in a war like a hundred years ago.”
"No. And he's made sure no one else in my family will either," Draco said, fiddling with his sleeve. "Not that I'd want anything to do with them, anyway."
"Something like that," Draco said. "It's not as good as it sounds, believe me. If I had known better, I would have destroyed it when I had the chance."
“Might pass this class after all," he said. “Seriously, Harry, thanks for helping me. I would rather drop out than go ask Hermione to help me again.”
“What a shame," Draco said, leaning back in his chair nonchalantly. “Tell me, where did you drag mum this time? Russia? Cold there this time of year, as far as I can remember. But it’s not like the likes of you have much of a choice when it comes to picking out hiding places, is it?”
“Just the code for ‘gay as fuck’ in the gay agenda," Seamus said as he returned with an amused- looking Dean.
“Yeah. He always tried telling me I had a choice though. Only made me hate him more at the time because I knew he was right.”
“Oi, this is a sex positive dormitory”, Seamus stated. “Sit down. I’m sure Hermione wouldn’t mind you knowing a lube spell or two.”
“I believe a less forceful approach may be of the essence in this case. Something, how would one say…” The professor tilted her head, inspecting Draco with her piercing gaze. “Gentle. Yes?”
After spending about an hour with Draco on the rooftop of the dorms building, Harry returned downstairs to his dorm. He was in a good mood from the amount of laughter that had taken place, but also a little confused. In awe was maybe a better word for it. He frankly hadn’t expected Draco to be so fun to be around. Especially the way he seemed to have gotten genuinely angry for Harry, when Harry had told him about the articles the Prophet had written about him during his stay at St Mungo’s, had made Harry feel oddly warm and fuzzy inside. Not that Ron and Hermione’s reaction had been significantly different, but something about the way Draco had called the reporters cretins made Harry smile every time he thought about it.
"Yeah. So... I guess I'll try to make some new friends this year," Neville said and shrugged. Harry watched as he went into his room, walking as if he was scared to make a lot of noise.
“Yes, well... We’ll see,” Harry said. “Did you notice anyone suspicious in the people who were here at the time of the murder?”
Harry now discovered that had been standing in the middle of his room for a while, fiddling mindlessly with a lock of hair that was just long enough for him to press it in between his lips. He wondered if anyone was home - he didn’t remember seeing anyone when he had walked in. He desperately wanted to talk to someone about - not necessarily about Draco in specific, but… Actually, yes, specifically about Draco, Harry realized as he sat down on his bed. But what was there to talk about? Well, besides the way, the way he was. What he was like, and how Harry hadn’t realized it before, and how Harry sometimes got this burning feeling in his chest whenever Draco did that thing where he, he didn’t chew on pencils like Harry did, but just kind of gently held the end of one between his teeth, or dragged it on his lower lip, before all of a sudden deciding on a word and continuing writing.
Something about Larry’s tone of voice made Harry a little worried, but he didn’t have time to think more on it. He needed to find Hermione and see the postcard for himself.
This sparked a liquid fire to pool in Harry's abdomen and now unable to control himself with what he realized was Draco's erection pressing against him, he pushed Draco onto his back on the bed, mirroring the position they had started out in except now Draco's legs were on his either side from having previously straddled him.
"Do you have something," Harry breathed as they frantically undressed as much as was necessary, all the while lost in a kiss that never seemed to fail to get more intense. Draco reached for his wand that lay on the floor next to the bed, said something that Harry had trouble understanding but that was apparently some kind of lube spell - a small pool of translucent
Come midnight, Harry was still doing homework. Ron was in his room too, with his homework spread on the bed along with a bag of crisps that rustled whenever Ron reached his hand inside. It had become a habit for the two to do homework together at night. Harry had found he could concentrate better when his friends weren't having fun in the next room and Ron... Well, he never seemed to remember about homework before it was already dark outside.
“It was only a moment after I had interviewed Mr. Scamander, whom I had also invited here that day. He left my office and ran back in a few minutes later, pale as a ghost. He said he had found Toadsworth laying in the corridor, lifeless.”
“It’s my supervisor telling me to stay away from the Malfoy case,” Harry said. They stood in front of the fireplace and he took a handful of Floo powder. “Arthur has a portkey prepared for us. Ready?”
“It’s kind of a long story… I’ll borrow you some comics," Harry said and turned to look at the wall again.
They practically fell out of the closet, stumbled to their feet and started to awkwardly straighten their clothes.
Harry frowned. Had Draco been lying when he said he wasn’t dating Pansy? But why would he have lied about something like that? Besides, together or not, it wasn’t like Malfoy to swoon after someone like that. Or at least, it didn’t seem like him to Harry.
came back”, Harry said hoarsely, battling the itch in his throat. “How the hell does Seamus already know what I was doing?”
know how to knock," Draco said. He wasn't hiding very well the fact that he was still, despite getting closer to Harry, not terribly fond of Ron.
“What was I supposed to do, just leave you on the street, wailing because you couldn't find Pansy? In case you didn’t know, I don’t have the password to your dorm, so I couldn’t take you there. Or would you have liked that, Draco? Your Slytherin friends seeing me haul you to your room?”
The owl tilted its head. For some reason, though it was normally indifferent towards humans, it wouldn’t stop staring at Draco.
“Like studying. Or like, when Harry came looking for me in the library, I was writing my article on Amortentia for the Daily Prophet”, Granger said. “Listen, I’ve known Harry and Ron for ten years now and it’s pretty much established at this point that they fight no matter what I do.”
“It must’ve been awful. To do what you did, to walk out on your family after everything… I hope they don’t-”
“And I’m - I’m proud of you. It’s one thing to be brave and stupid like those boys upstairs, but admitting you were wrong, that’s… That’s something I want to get better at. In case I’m ever wrong.” Granger smiled.
"See, it turned out all wonky again!" Seamus crumpled up the piece of parchment, now decorated with something that could best be described as a stick figure during an earthquake, and tossed it over his shoulder into a pile of crinkled paper that was apparently the result of several hours of work.
Harry and Draco looked around frantically, but the room was painfully lacking of places to hide. Then Draco nodded at the closet.
together or anything, but... Was the idea of it alone so strange that they could be seen holding hands and people would just, ignore it rather than address it?
As they walked around the classroom, looking under tables and chairs to find the snakes, Draco started talking.
"Year... two..." Harry said as he wrote. "Right. Broken arm, a couple Bludgers to the head, Umbridge's black quill... That's about everything that matters, right?"
"Jump for me," Harry said instead, and the room hummed in a white heat of possibility. Who was to say they weren't innocent?
"Young master remembers old Ksenia's name," the elf said, still continuing in English with a cooing tone.
“Nasty business, that Toadsworth thing,” Neville said as Draco closed the greenhouse door behind him. The air inside was very thick and moist, and the scent of wet dirt took Draco right back to Herbology lessons.
“Crummy place to die, wouldn’t it have been? Under my bed”, Draco said and looked at Harry, whose insides fluttered as imaginary butterflies came to be within them. “I was going to take it outside once I was here, but…” Draco lifted his hand to pet Hugo, and the owl happily snuggled against his arm. “I guess this bugger needed it more. What’s its name?”
Draco found professor Toads-whatever-her-name-was sitting on a chair in front of the broom cupboard that led to the quidditch field. Draco recognized her from the ridiculous amount of layers of robes and furs. She was reading a magazine, cross-legged, looking more like a homeless person than a professor.
“I think you know full well,” Harry started, pausing only to try and catch his breath, “that coming up with sentences is damn near impossible when someone is buried to the hilt inside of you.”
Draco walked over, quickly glancing at Russia from the window before unrolling the parchment. The documents were already written out for him in both Russian and English.
Harry wasn't sure when he had started to softly grind against Draco but he had, and Draco's fingers were digging into his back, encouraging him, and Harry was so dazed in arousal that he was surprised he didn't come right there and then when Draco's hand reached down for him, fingers curling around the shape of his cock, stroking at it through the fabric. This time Harry wasn't so successful in holding back his moan. Harry felt Draco smile against his lips, swirling his tongue around Harry's, and Harry's chest fluttered when he realized Draco liked hearing him.
“Harry?” Draco said as softly as he could. There was no answer, but Draco could hear movement. It sounded like Harry was in the far corner of the room. Draco remembered the window, and though he didn’t think Harry was in that kind of state of mind, he started to worry about it. He placed his hand on the door handle.
“Oh?” Draco said and sat down next to Harry. He wasn’t sure why, but his first reaction had been to think that Harry would now proceed to tell him he’d rather kiss a Dementor than be friends with him.
“My therapist once said something interesting to me,” he said. “She said we can’t save people. That we can only love them.”
“I don’t know," Harry said, shrugging. “I just have a feeling he would be kind of a dick about it, you know? And I don’t want to get into a whole argument about it, at least not yet. It’s not like Draco and I are
“Draco, I’m not going to obliviate my friend over something like that," Harry laughed and shook his head. “Merlin, you really are a Slytherin.”
"It's an ancient Egyptian amulet," Draco said. "It's the next best thing there is to a Philosopher's Stone."
“The leeches are the worst part," Draco said. “And I had to touch four of them! Merlin, they make me sick.” Draco pulled out a notebook from his bag. “I swear, if it doesn’t work again I’ll dump the leech tank into the Thames so at least they’ll have to find replacements before the professor can bother me about it again.”
Draco could only manage half a smile. He was somewhat used to the company of Harry's friends by now, but it was still strange to be at Weasley's house.
"He tagged along when I left the greenhouse. I was so worried someone would kill him! Thanks, guys."
“Ah, it’s always the forbidden fruit, isn’t it," Seamus said, a smug smile on his face. “Don’t you worry on it, lads. Your secret’s safe with me. Well, I’ll tell Dean of course," he said as he walked to the portrait, “but that’s it. No one important at least. Not the press, definitely. Unless they ask me, that is. A couple galleons for a scoop doesn't sound bad when you're dating an artist, just saying...”
Just as it was getting a little too hot under the blanket, there was a knock on the door. That immediately informed Draco it wasn't Weasley, and for that he was relieved. It was enough humiliation for the week that Draco had lost a game of chess to him.
"My father got the worst of it though. He hasn't walked properly since… it's really no wonder he didn't want me around his house. I just remind him of everything that went wrong."
Bill's voice was interrupted by a loud clanger from the kitchen, followed by children yelling over each other.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, dropping his bag at the door and went to sit next to Ron, wrapping him up in a hug before he had time to answer. “Did something happen with Hermione?”
"No they didn't," Ron blurted. "I mean, I was surprised alright. You'd be bloody surprised too if you walked in on Harry and I doing - doing that..."
“Unofficially, yes. His office got a report last Tuesday that a Russian man has been walking about Knockturn Alley, asking questions about a Wadjet.”
That was the memory Draco desperately held on to as Harry knocked on the Weasleys' door. Their house was called the Burrow, and it was fairly obvious why - it looked like it could have easily been the home of some fairy tale rabbits with little hats and aprons. Thinking about it like that made him feel a little less nervous, but only a little. He had procrastinated with the packing for days, and even picked up the habit of biting at the skin surrounding his fingernails, which he had never done before. Whether Harry knew it or not, this was the closest Draco could ever get to meeting his family. And they already most certainly didn’t like him, nor did they have a reason to. The closest memory Draco had of Mr.Weasley was from eleven years ago from a certain fist fight at Flourish and Blotts, and knowing that was probably the least problematic thing to have happened between the two families didn’t provide much comfort.
“No," Draco said when he noticed Harry's breath growing frantic again, “no you didn’t. It was a dream. Tell me about Spider-Man - where does he live?”
“Hi," Granger said and, though Draco couldn’t even begin to understand why she bothered, forced a little smile. She was holding a stack of folders and notebooks and looked like she was on her way to do homework.
"I won't come home," the man says. "But whenever you want to visit me, you'll be welcome. I'll write you back. Maybe one day I'll come to see you. But this is the life I'm choosing and if you won't accept it, there's nothing I can do."
“Anything interesting at the Ministry?” Harry asked and started to search his shoulder bag for a snack bar. He only found the empty wrapper and realized he had already eaten it during the lecture.
“No," Harry said. “No, I don’t think I will. Now if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll just go and be gay somewhere else.”
Harry flipped the pages until he found the spread for the current Magical Injury class. First listed were the grades for their first homework assignment. A sophisticated, cursive number eight was marked next to both Harry’s and Draco’s names.
“Well, I - I used to read about Muggles sometimes in the library at Hogwarts. Never told anyone about that, actually.”
Some of you may have noticed Harry saying to Draco he now has PTSD as a result of everything that happened during the war. As someone who struggles with PTSD, I'm not sure how much of Harry's symptoms I'll have the energy to write into the story without it affecting my own mental health negatively. I generally like to keep my stories light-hearted, but I still felt it was important to stress that I didn't just throw the word 'PTSD' in there as a token without any real intent to follow through with it. (Looking at you, certain relevant-to-this-context author with a nasty habit of queer baiting...) After everything that has happened to Harry, I think it's realistic to assume he would have it.
“Because I’m a selfish bastard, that's why. I felt so guilty I couldn’t sleep and I couldn’t come up with anything else that would make it better. I’m sorry.”
Harry fumbled for his wand but clearly it had rolled under the bed again, because he could manage nothing more but a poor attempt to hide behind Draco when the bug came around again.
“No, he… He’s probably the least likely of them all to tell anyone. Ron would’ve told Hermione and Dean would’ve told Seamus but Neville… I don’t think he’s going to.”
A moment of eye contact. Draco let Harry hang in there for a while, taking in the visual of Auror Potter on his knees, and then said:
“Ugh, I don’t know," Ron said and leaned back in his chair, relaxing a little. “There isn’t really any other programme that interests me.”
The giraffe animagus in the portrait knows of a secret and can't keep the information to himself any longer. One can only hope he will tell the right people about what happened...
"You should've seen his face," Seamus wheezed, "I think he really thought, for a second he really thought…"
"Yes. Thank you," Harry said after swallowing down a "if it's not too much trouble". Draco's influence was starting to wear off on him.
Narcissa gathers her hem, crossing her legs as the toddler sitting next to her bumps against her as the train changes tracks. Narcissa looks down to her right and sees a head full of blonde hair pulled in two pigtails. The girl looks up at her - she has huge, blue eyes - and giggles. Narcissa notices the girl's mother smiling at her and quickly looks away. Her gaze glued to the houses passing by, she thinks of the little sister Draco almost had. She only ever told one person about her, and that person took the secret to her grave. It's too soon to tell them, she thought, and not the right time. Lucius was stressed, Draco was stressed - Narcissa suspects it was the stress that took her baby, too. She tries to push back the thought, but she fails and she wonders how different life would be now. Vela, her evening star, would have been four years old. Narcissa hates herself for having chosen a name already, because now she can't stop referring to what had come out of her that night as anything else. Draco would have made a wonderful big brother. If Vela had been born, would Draco have left? Or would his love for his little sister convinced him to stay? Foolish thoughts, Narcissa scolds herself, but one more comes to her before the train stops. If Vela had been born, she wouldn't be all alone if Draco didn't come home.
to have Mr. Potter join them. I am merely trying to make sure he knows what he is getting himself into.”
“Murdered,” George said. “They found her this morning in the courtyard. Poor bugger… The killing curse by the looks of it, from what I hear. It was Rolf Scamander that found her.”
The pile of laundry on the chair looked like it had been tossed there by someone who was so lazy that they kept moving the pile from the chair to the bed in an effort to avoid dealing with it.
Ron, Harry and the two other AT students in their year (the fifth had dropped out a month into the first year) were standing in line in the middle of Darthorn’s quidditch field that somehow managed to exist both inside one of the school’s broom closets but also very noticeably outdoors. It was dark outside, and so cold that Harry wouldn’t have been surprised to see snowflakes floating down from the sky. Although, Harry still wasn’t quite sure whether the sky was real or just charmed into place like the ceiling in the Great Hall at Hogwarts. Either way, right now the sky felt painfully real as it hung above them as a formless, black void that made the already freezing students look even more miserable.
for each other, it made me feel so empty inside because I knew I was missing out on something I wasn’t even capable of.”
Draco envied Harry, who out of well-formed habit had thrown his Gryffindor Quidditch Team duffel bag onto the bed and filled it quickly, not hesitating a single item. He had taken some clothes, but not enough to indicate a long absence; he had taken his toothbrush, a journal where he kept track of his cases, two or three potions and not much else. Harry, of course, was used to this sort of thing, having spent a considerable amount of his life on the run either from his aunt and uncle or snatchers or Voldemort, or all of them, not to mention the numerous work-related trips he had to go on.
And so Narcissa tells Lucius to go through with the plan and contact the Parkinson girl. Just to get it over with. Just to bring an end to this madness, this postponed and all the more stubborn teenage rebellion of her son, to bring him home. Narcissa expects a couple months at the house will bring him to his senses. Narcissa's mother-in-law, for once in her life, agrees with her and complains that is it cruel to let her die of old age without seeing her only grandson for the last time. That's what Lucius translates her words into, anyway. There's a coldness in the old woman's eyes whenever she looks at Narcissa, and sometimes she suspects she's ridiculing her when Lucius insists she's complaining about the weather. The worst thing is, Narcissa can't disagree with her. She has done something wrong in raising her son, otherwise the situation would be different. Has she spoiled him too much with gentle words when discipline was needed? Probably. But Lucius was always stern with him, sometimes even giving him a slap across the face if he was being disrespectful, and Narcissa couldn't bring herself to do the same. After all, Draco was only a boy. Well, man now, wasn't he? He would never seem that way to Narcissa, though. One day he would have wrinkles around his eyes and sunken-in cheekbones like his father and Narcissa would only see the face of a curious young boy who wanted to climb every tree and jump in every puddle. But all that was so long ago.
Harry and Draco stared at each other as they listened to professor Skepperus walk down the hallway and into the staircase.
Harry felt a certain desperation take over him about the whole situation as he walked to Draco’s dorm, the folded newspaper sandwiched between his arm and his side. It was becoming painfully obvious that he and Draco would never do anything without everyone talking about it, everyone having an opinion. And it wasn’t just because Harry was who he was - Draco’s family was very well known, not necessarily for their positive influence on the world, but still, the name Malfoy meant something. A lot, most of the time. And so did Potter, and it was as if Draco and Harry were trapped somewhere between the two, unable to escape.
“There’s one thing I don’t understand though," Harry said after his friends had scattered and it was only him, Ron and Hermione left in the kitchen. “When Rita Skeeter saw Hermione hug me during the Tournament…”
is the time you won’t make it out of it alive, you have to let me be there for you. And even when you or I fail to do all of that we have to work it out, no matter how hard it is, because that’s what friends do.”
“I know. I know that’s how you see it, but you don’t know the whole story. You don’t know what he went through.”
It wasn’t as if Draco hadn’t changed, too. He had become nothing short of best friends with Hermione Granger over the years, and these days he was proud to say he was more than tolerant of even Ron, who often asked Draco to be his practice opponent before important tournaments. Naturally, these games were played on Ron’s chess board that had once belonged to his grandfather. Draco had told him to get himself a new one for years, but Ron didn’t want to hear it. In fact, it was Draco who had given him the idea of going into Wizard’s Chess more seriously, and it was Draco his mother sent tarts to every time Ron moved up a rank in the national - or international - listings. At his current rank, the winning rewards were enough that he had been able to quit his part-time job at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and throw himself into chess completely. Over time, he had become esteemed enough as a player that he had even given a few inspirational lectures at Hogwarts at McGonagall’s request. For this, no one was more excited than Hermione. For her, seeing Ron so committed to something that he was willing to read books with barely any pictures in them, had apparently awakened such a deep attraction to the man that she had had no choice but to have a baby with him.
The Weasleys were there in the living room waiting for them, too many of them to list. Hermione and Fleur with her and Bill’s three children were there, and Angelina (George’s wife, along with their two children, Fred and Roxanne), Percy’s wife Audrey and their two children, Molly and Lucy, and really, due to the number of children and people running around after them, Christmas was slowly starting to resemble the Quidditch World Cup. The mood, at least, was one of equal anticipation. The silence that fell when Harry and Draco arrived revealed that their situation had been the main topic of discussion before their arrival.
“I don’t care what people think," Harry said. “Hey, look at me - I’ve been treated like I’m some kind of public property my whole life. No matter what I do, someone’s going to have a problem with it.”
"Bending over for me are we," Harry said, his grin spilling over the corners of his mouth. "How generous of you."
“I’m not gay," Harry said, frustration building up inside him. “And don’t you bring Ginny into this. What happened between us is none of your-”
Harry found himself surprisingly reluctant to walk into the mirror. Something, something he couldn’t really point out, was very eerie about the whole thing. But he had beaten Voldemort. And at least a hundred dementors, and several Death Eaters, he reminded himself. Walking into danger simply was what he
Draco closed the door as Harry looked up at the pictures on the walls. There was an old man drinking coffee, a dead pigeon, some swans…
"Why is Adrik locked up?" He asked as grandmother Yana read over the documents and then sent Ksenia to fetch the owls.
“I’m sure Spencer would be very amused to hear whatever you have to say after you all but blackmailed your supervisor into giving you that promotion last year,” Harry said. He didn’t seem overjoyed to see Theodore, but nor was he as agonized by his very existence as he had been during their Darthorn years. Now, more than anything, Harry seemed uninterested in his opinions.
“What would we know of normal, Draco?” He said. “We children of the war. We do as we must, and if we find a moment of contentment somewhere, then I say we’ve been the lucky ones.”
“Not that much they don’t," Ron huffed. “He called Hermione a mudblood, Harry, he - he broke your nose, he tried to kill Dumbledore! He almost killed me with that poisoned mead! I can’t believe I have to explain this to you - you can’t just pretend that never happened. He’s vicious!”
Draco ventured outside and behind the castle, grateful for the fresh air and the absence of people. He let his eyes rest on the familiar landscape; the tall silhouette of the Owlery within the mist; the faint light glimmering in the window of the groundskeeper's hut; and on his right, the Great Lake, though most of it disappeared into the fog. Seeing this place didn’t cause as much dread as he had expected. Perhaps enough time had finally passed since his school years, perhaps enough of those memories filled with panic and torment had been replaced with good ones.
Draco shifts his weight from one foot to the other, and Narcissa reads this as promising hesitation.
Draco and Harry stared in silence as Seamus closed the door behind him. They heard his whistling echo in the staircase.
What happens when Lucius is in London shakes both of them to their core. It's much worse than they ever thought. Not only is Draco associating with the wrong sort, but with the Potter boy. And the article says Draco is apologetic towards him about the past and when Narcissa reads that, she feels despair pool in her insides - she wants to hold Draco and tell him he has done nothing wrong, and whoever has convinced him - and now her despair turns to tingling anger, because of course that's what happened. Too much time alone surrounded by the wrong people. Of course Draco had tried to fit in among them, and of course they had treated him like a war criminal, made him feel even more alone. And so he had turned to the only person who could redeem him. Narcissa is now convinced this is what has happened.
“Listen mate, you can do whatever you want but if you ask me, kissing that nut job is a thought you maybe would’ve been better off keeping to yourself.”
Harry swallowed down and nodded, delirious from how much he wanted to do it. He probably would've begged if Draco had made him, but instead Draco gave a smirk.
The thought of Draco’s father being called that silenced him for a bit, and it seemed to have the same effect on the others.
If you're so horny, he often asked himself, why don't you just make a move? It wasn't as if he didn't have the balls to do it. He wasn't insecure, not around Harry anyway. It was just… He had wanted Harry for so long and had expected to gain some sort of control over it, eventually. To not feel so
All of a sudden Harry realized the nickname wasn't derived from the first letter of Dean's name. He immediately decided it was urgent to go see if anyone was in the living room.
“You know, it’s funny,” Harry said while he slid out of his coat, “I always thought you didn’t like me in my work clothes, but judging by your reaction to all this…”
"I was going to write to you", Harry said after it became clear that Remus and Draco were both starting to run out things to talk about. "I was never going to keep this a secret."
“The misuse of Amortentia," Hermione said. “Healers have been saying for years now that it should be made illegal but no one at the Ministry is listening. It’s pretty unbelievable when you think about it - it’s practically designed for sexual assault and they teach
Harry slipped his hand under Draco's hoodie and the shirt he was wearing underneath, his fingers wandering on the impossibly velvety skin. It was getting hot and without breaking the kiss, Draco sat up, Harry following him as they both, hands trembling with long unseen need, helped each other out of their hoodies. Draco wore a black T-shirt underneath, Harry noticed, and soon his hands were already both under it, claiming every new inch of bare skin as Harry reached for Draco's neck, lips brushing past his ear.
“Perhaps,” McGonagall said, “but if she thought teaching at this school would feel leisurely in comparison, I’m afraid she was mistaken.”
“Yeah, alright," Harry said. “Let me think.” Last Saturday. The thunderstorm… That’s what must have taken Neville so long in the Owlery! He had seen the postcard and panicked because he had promised not to tell anyone about the time Malfoy had spent the night in Harry’s room. But who had he told?
- and then stopped giving him any friction whatsoever. At this point Draco was starting to be delirious enough that he might have actually started begging, but then, luckily, Harry took him in his mouth again. Only, now he pressed his lips tight around the tip for a while, rolling his tongue over and back, and then stopped again, raising his brows at Draco like presenting a challenge.
Remus’ owl - Harry had now settled on the name Howard - flew to Draco’s knee, making him flinch in surprise. Looking suspicious, Draco offered it a hand. The bird nudged against it.
Draco did as he had asked, though at this point any word out of Harry, any fracture of a movement would have been enough to send him tumbling over the edge.
“Don’t try to calm me down like I’m some scared pup.” Draco backed off a little as Potter sat up, stretching his back with a couple painful-sounding cracks.
Harry climbed onto the bed and laid down next to Draco, leaning his head on Draco’s chest. They shifted, looking for a comfortable position until their limbs were snuggly intertwined.
"It'll be long enough soon to make a lovely little bun," he had said. Harry had laughed, but secretly he wasn't planning on cutting his hair just yet. He had noticed that he looked quite a bit like Sirius when he let his hair, moustache and beard grow out a little bit, and he wasn't quite ready to let go of that. Not yet, at least.
They held their breaths and listened. Whoever was walking in the hallway stopped in front of professor Skepperus’ office.
Harry was already trying to come up with excuses in his head for when Skepperus would open the closet and find two students inside. But why would he need to fetch robes in the middle of the night?
“If only the odds were in my favour like that," Draco said. The awkwardness in the air only grew thicker as they passed the station.
“She was very short and observant,” McGonagall said. “I hadn’t expected her to have such a thick foreign accent after having taught in London for so long, but other than that…”
Harry remembered how relieved Ron had been when Dean had once said to him it was pretty obvious he was straight.
"Baby," Harry blurted out and pulled Draco tightly against himself. "Of course not. I'll beat up anyone who hates you."
“Why, of course it is," Larry chuckled. “So, as I was saying - I heard Miss Granger and Mr. Longbottom talking about you two.”
“Because I think you are," Harry said and realized he really did. “You just weren’t given a choice. Just like I wasn’t. I never had the choice to think about myself - I could have, but then people would’ve died, and it’s not really a choice if the options are your own death and letting people suffer, is it? Both are equally torturous. You just picked one. I picked the other. And we both made the right choice.”
“It went fine,” Theodore repeated, looked quickly at Draco’s eyes and then down again, as if the eye contact had been simply insufferable to him. What on Earth could have made him so angry? “And you can piss off, for all I care.” And with that, he stormed out through the main entrance.
Neville turned to look at a big potted plant with spotty leaves, perhaps to help Draco feel more at ease with the subject of discussion.
Draco crouched in front of the grave, stuffed his gloves inside the pockets of his coat and started brushing away the wet sand. It got under his fingernails and under the cuffs of his shirt, and as the rain pounded against his face, he felt Harry’s presence behind him and was taken over by an unexplainable fit of annoyance.
“You’re soaking wet”, Harry said as he closed the window behind Draco. “Why didn’t you come through the door?”
“You look a little dazed is all," Harry said, and he wasn’t wrong. Draco kept staring at the same place without blinking for unnerving amounts of time.
Draco stood there, staring at Harry’s door. The portrait gave a long creak as Weasley left the dorm. Draco lifted his hand, but hesitated and lowered it again. What Weasley had described to him earlier about the way Harry had acted sounded like a panic attack, and having been through several of them himself, Draco was painfully aware of how almost everything seemed to make it worse. Especially attempts to help. He feared he was just going to upset Harry more by trying to help, but leaving him alone… That was even worse of an option.
“It’s Harry," Weasley said, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, looking deeply uneasy. “He… It’s kind of a long story, but he’s not doing very well, and I-”
Harry looked at Draco, and from his expression Draco realized there was really starting to be no choice left.
“My, goodness me," the woman chuckled. “Tell you what - I’ll take care of this paperwork and meet you on the sixth floor in a bit. We can go to the staff room, it’ll be nice and calm there.”
"I guess you do have that Quidditch and beer straight guy look," Dean said, "but no, I can tell because you've been with Hermione for three years. That would be a long time to pretend to like boobs."
“No," Draco said and looked at Harry. “No. You don’t get to pretend it was all okay, because it wasn’t. And I’m sorry.”
"When Malfoy broke your nose. You should write that down and see how much Skepperus likes him after that."
“How can one tell them apart from regular candles?” Draco made up as he spoke. He could see from the corner of his eye that Potter was looking at him.
“Don’t come yet,” Harry said before going down again, swallowing around Draco in a way that roused something between a yelp and a moan from him. The inside of Harry’s mouth was so hot, and the back of his throat, whenever he grazed it, so tight, that Draco thought he might lose it if he couldn’t come, and he leaned his head back, covering his eyes with his hands as he groaned.
"You're going too far," she says. "Darthorn I could have accepted, but this… You're acting like a fool, Draco. He- his kind, they killed
"Then you'll join the circus or become a carpenter," Remus said. "Or whatever you want. You're the only one who's holding you up to all these expectations."
Harry smiled. It felt like a small forever had passed since they had been stuck in that elevator together at St.Mary’s. The memory made Harry think about what Draco had said about his leather jacket when he had been high on Amortentia. Harry pushed the thought away and started going through his bag, trying to find a book or a paper or something that had to do with the exam.
walking - he was still high, delirious from having kissed Harry. Something in Draco’s mind tried to convince him it hadn’t really happened. Draco ran his fingers along the rough bark of the tree and thought of Harry’s hair. He had actually touched Harry’s hair after thinking about it for all those years. He remembered thinking that getting it out of his system would probably somehow help, but now he knew better. Draco’s fingers were floating aimlessly in the air, looking. And now they had gotten a taste of what they were searching for.
“Nothing much there to be afraid of if you ask me. He just stood there and gawked for a second looking like a proper git and then left.”
Harry couldn’t help but smile at the fact that he was in the middle of a conversation that had caused Dean to admirably casually say “bum stuff”.
"You mean you're hoping my talent will rub off on you," Dean said. Although it made both Seamus and him smile, it was an unfortunate choice of words considering Ron had just decided to face his prejudices and walk back into the living room. An odd sound escaped his throat, and he caughed awkwardly in an effort to cover it up.
Harry Potter was sleeping in class. Draco kept glancing at him when the other students were being loud and when the token, distant scream that no one ever got any explanation for, echoed in the hallway. No noise seemed to be obnoxious enough to disturb Potter’s sleep, though. He had crossed his arms on the table and was resting his head on them, his face completely hidden within the mane of hair that he sometimes wore in a rather endearing looking bun.
Harry handed Draco the handful of snakes he had picked up. Their hands briefly touched and Harry saw Draco flinch a little bit.
Then someone opened the door and looking up, Harry saw a blurry figure with ginger hair disappear into the corridor.
“So you do agree?” Granger said, her eyes lighting up a little. She started looking through her folders and handed Draco a slip of paper. “Then tell me, what do you think?”
“People have gone insane from what they saw in that mirror," Draco snarled, holding himself back from raising his wand at the professor. “Why would you make Potter go in there?”
"He's worried about himself," said Draco, who had been informed of his father's letter to Remus only moments ago. "His only son holding hands with The Boy Who Lived doesn't exactly help him regain a position within his… circle."
Draco frowned and stared at Harry, his eyes full of questions that Harry didn’t have answers for. A second of excruciating silence went by. Harry heard the humming of his own bloodflow in his ears. Draco had frozen still, and looked like he was about to say something but decided against it at the last minute. Harry was fairly certain Malfoy was about to storm out any second now, but then Draco grabbed his face and kissed him. Harry felt his knees go weak and kissed back, and then the Auror Handbook fell on the floor with a thump. Draco pulled back and stared at Harry. Neither of them said anything, but Harry knew what Draco was thinking. Are we really doing this?
"What if I don't do it?" He said as hesitation hit him. What did the old hag gain from all this, anyway?
“I should’ve realized," Harry said when Draco put the paper down. “I should’ve warned you it would be like this.”
Draco was sitting by the table in the very furthest corner next to the window. Harry handed him the coffee along with the change and sat down. Draco held the mug between his palms, and his fingers started to slowly change colours from what looked like frostbite, to a more healthy-looking tone.
Harry had been right - it was cold outside to the extent where it almost felt disgusting, especially to Harry who was still a bit groggy from being woken up in the middle of the night. Harry saw Draco standing under a lamp post with his arms crossed, his hands tucked under the armpits as if to preserve some warmth. As Harry walked up to him, he noticed Draco’s cheeks and nose were flushed.
Harry sat up straight and lifted his arm, and Draco leaned onto his shoulder, letting Harry run his fingers through his hair as they sat in silence.
Dean and Seamus were looking at him with more anticipation than Harry had ever been subjected to in his life.
Draco recognized the ceiling he was now looking at - ornate panelling in amber wood -  and groaned. He felt seasick. Rubbing his lower back, now sore from the impact, he sat up, reaching for his wand. It wasn't there. He searched again after hastily scrambling to his feet.
“I say," Skepperus said and started slowly turning away. “How to tell them apart…” He looked as if he had gotten lost inside his thoughts as he wandered to the front of the class.
As Harry pushed open the heavy door that guarded the exit to the roof, the two felt a welcome, cool breeze greeting them. It was one of those days where it was sunny one minute and cloudy the next, and shadows of clouds passing by were calmly floating across the roof. It was apparent that the charms that made Darthorn suitable to wizard tastes didn’t extend to this place, as it looked like it was made out of nothing but concrete and gray metal, two very essential features when it came to Muggle architecture, Draco had noticed. He didn’t understand nor enjoy it, but over the years he had gotten a little more interested in who he was with as opposed to where he was.
His new name sounding odd in his ears, Draco nodded and said absently, his mind already scanning for places where Harry could have gone:
The class wasn’t the only thing Harry would have liked to talk about with Draco. He was dying to know why Pansy had tricked him into drinking Amortentia if the two weren’t even friends anymore. The whole situation just seemed so strange, and since Harry had been the one to help Draco - had he liked it or not -, he felt too invested to just let the whole thing slide.
Draco smiled too, but let it melt into a deathly calm expression as he tilted his head and dragged his thumb over Harry’s bottom lip.
hand though," Harry said. Surely he had known where that sort of thing would lead. It was inevitable. He was Harry Potter, and if they dated, sooner or later everyone would know.
“I think a lot of it is just in his head too," Harry said. “He keeps talking about how all his brothers are better than him and how he never gets attention and - right, I know I’m not  the best person to say this, but who ever said he has to be more famous and successful than his brothers?”
“And I won’t deny it, you did some of the meanest, pettiest things I’ve ever seen in my life," Harry continued. “But when I first met you at Madam Malkin’s ten years ago, you tried to make conversation. Sure you sounded like a prick, but I mean… You were trying your best.”
The professor turned to look at Draco, not visibly impressed but obviously more intrigued by the conversation than she had been a few seconds ago.
stop thinking about that person. To be honest, it scared me at first because that person… Well, I was pretty confident he didn't like me back."
Narcissa sees in her son's eyes that he  wishes he could have done more, that he still regrets the times he hesitated.
A witch called Juno Toadsworth was head instructor for the Auror Training programme. She was a retired Auror who spoke with a strange, vaguely Nordic accent and was about as tall as Harry had been at twelve years old. She was a brilliant teacher and a particularly good storyteller, but much to Harry’s disappointment, he wouldn’t have many of her classes before third year. Toadsworth was, however, always present during exams, and this morning was no exception.
“No," Draco said, giving a little chuckle and turning to look at Harry. “There’s usually much more pressing things to worry about.”
He opened the door just as Ron Weasley, who was standing on the other side of it, was about to slam his fist onto it again.
"You could have a great future in Russia," she continues excitedly and lowers her voice. "They think highly of us for what we did. And what
“Right,” Harry said. “The murderer could still be in the castle,” he continued, lowering his voice. “Or someone else. It wouldn’t be the first time someone broke in.”
“Green apples," Draco said without hesitation. “And- and, the way the air smells when it thunders, you know that, that heavy, electric smell that’s also kind of ominous… And…” Draco looked around, as if he was looking for something.  “It’s something different…”
“He thought Draco’s name sounded stupid," Hermione sighed, clearly embarrassed for her boyfriend's behalf. “So it was really Ron who started it.”
“I can handle him," Draco said. “Besides, he isn’t here much and when he is, he’s usually in his room wanking so he doesn’t give me much trouble.”
"Yeah. That it wasn't a car accident after all. Obviously the nutter's finally gone off the deep end. No wonder really when you think of his background. Used to be a Death Eater, did you know that?"
Draco was wearing the clothes from when he had left to visit a Muggle hospital with Potter, where… Draco rubbed his forehead. He could distantly remember a Muggle in a strange, blue outfit, but every time he tried to grasp the memory to figure out what had happened, it blurred and escaped him. He remembered sitting on the floor somewhere with Potter. Draco frowned. It wasn’t like him to sit on the floor, especially in that company. He must’ve remembered it wrong.
Each time, there was a moment when the energy shifted, when the playing and bantering suddenly turned urgent, wanton, non-negotiable. This time, that moment came precisely now as with a small nod, Draco told Harry to sit up, stripping his upper body rather unceremoniously, letting the clothes fall over the edge of the bed to a space that at the moment, no longer existed to either of them. More removing of clothes with fumbling hands followed, and then a spell (Draco used
“Right," Draco said. “You’re mental, you know that? And what exactly about a skinny, bratty bloke who’s a foot taller than you makes you go, ‘oh, cute’?”
Harry was not sitting up straight, nor was he unbothered by the situation. His hair was all over the place, his now-boyfriend (the thought made Harry's heart beat so fast he thought it might jump out of his chest at any minute to do riverdance in between the cereal boxes) was sitting next to him looking unfairly put together considering he had woken up after Harry, and across the table, snickering at him was Remus Lupin, his… Uncle? Not through blood of course, but still, such was their relationship these days - and he looked as if a flood of all kinds of clever comments would burst out of him any second now.
Draco and Harry glanced at each other. They both knew it was Skepperus. They heard the soft thumps of his short footsteps come inside.
“Hey, I’m not that thick, okay? Here’s the facts: Harry and I were in his room, on his bed, Harry on top of me, we’re making out, door closed, right?”
Harry turned to look at him. It was the first time he had seen Draco laugh like that, not out of mischief. It was nice. His laugh was nice, and... Wait, what?
“Oh, I don’t think so," Draco said, now turning to look at his father. “See, I’m in kind of in the middle of something.”
Harry pulled a journal from the breast pocket of his uniform coat, and clicked the end of the ballpoint pen which he used to write in it. The click made McGonagall flinch slightly, as it was likely she had never seen such an object before.
“Really?” Harry said. He was leaning back in his chair, balancing on its back legs in that position where it was inevitable that he would either continue to look cool and unbothered or fall over any second now.
Narcissa's stomach drops when her thoughts are confirmed. It's not that she didn't know Draco was gay, of course. She had even promised him he could be with whoever he wanted as soon as he would produce an heir, but this… How dare he? That her own son would betray her like this is beyond her.
“No, I won’t,” Harry said, and there was now a coldness in his voice that Draco hadn’t heard in a long time. “I need your help.”
“It’s more comfortable”, Dean said, crossing his arms. “That isn’t the point. The point is, people are always being nosey, wanting to know who’s who in a gay relationship, but it isn’t that simple.”
The war ended with broken people with broken tools and broken hearts. On the brink of irreparable but with no tools or skills to fix it. A mask of cheerfulness at the outcome slipping away revealing the horrors they have faced underneath. A strong will can only hold so much and the wound only bleeds more as the stitching crumbles with a crudely made needle.
The war ended with cripples and heart breaking truths of the cries of children finding their parents no longer breathing. Children not separated by spoken alliances, lines drawn on the floor. All sharing in the same earth shattering reality that those who walked out the door that morning would never again walk back in.
Looking at the lake again with the reflection of starlight he saw in his lover's eyes he made his choice.
From across the lake you can see a man aged beyond his years, a smile wrinkling his face as he breathes in the air, the scent of the flowers blooming by the lake, the way the starlight shines against the dark blanket of night, settling in the embrace of his lover around him.
Dealing with it was the corresponding equivalent of ripping open half scabbed wounds still bright red and bleeding from countless tales of pain. Gouging out flesh and letting the crimson liquid trickle and gush out along with the poison left by the memories.
He was no longer able to feel the sunlight beneath his face, stare at his couch without imagining his lover there waiting for him to come home; he was no longer able to breathe knowing that his lover, his Draco, would never draw breath underneath the same starlit sky as him again.
The war ended with the subdued realization that no matter the outcome the anguish of those dragged into a losing battle by blood and ties would never heal.
Victory is hollow and the path to it built on sacrifices. A banner of triumph covering the bodies and empty eyed children underneath.
He ate each day staring at the empty chair across from him and his taste buds seemed to dull as he remembered the back and forth conversation of old friends who were more than that. Who were more than their past. Who looked toward their future.
The war ended, yes, but the price was not something he would have wished on his greatest enemy. The price collecting its pay in screams of agony in the middle of the night and the eyes hollowed with inexplicable despair at the empty seat around the dining table.
That thought jolted him awake. More awake than he’d been in years. Looking up, at the starlight that reminded him of eyes he could drown in forever, one particular one caught his eyes.
From across the lake you can see a young man, a body marred from grief and eyes holding inexplicable years of longing and sorrow. Longing for a life that was never destined for him, the sorrow of growing up too fast. A chance of life cruelly snached by death himself when happiness was finally in reach.
He bore witness to all this from the confines of his own mind. He sat up screaming at night at a man long dead. When reality finally separated itself from the webs of his unconscious mind, he stilled, and the crushing weight of he who no longer held him in these times of pain, who no longer stared at him with those eyes, those eyes filled with starlight and hopes of a future, of understanding as he too woke up screaming on nights the same as this. Nothing left but a cold spot where only a whisper of him remained.
No one was spared. Not the fighters, not the lovers, not the innocent who had no right to bear witness to so many deaths. The dead may be resting, but at what cost? The cost of a life cut short, the journey to their next stop fashioned from the grief and suffering of those they had to leave behind.
The war had snached many things from him. His childhood, his destiny, his purpose for living had all been dedicated to him from the day his mother's love spared him to a lifetime of expectations.
The price of war paying itself in the unfixable strain of living with death himself for so many years.
Draco glanced over his shoulder, the corners of his mouth turning downwards like they always did when he was disgusted by something.
After Draco had left, Harry walked Remus back to the main building where there were fireplaces for Flooing. They were taking the long way, strolling slowly and reluctantly as there seemed to be too little time and too much to talk about. Tonks was covering evening shifts that week so Remus would have to be back home early.
Narcissa smiles wearily. Draco still sees things like a boy. Bad people, good people… if only it was that simple.
it," Granger said, “but not drink it. Don’t you see? You’re allergic to knotgrass! The itching and the rash, it was obviously an allergic reaction. That's why the potion doesn't work - your body rejects it instead of reacting with the magical properties."
"Of course," he said, leaning back in his chair as if giving space to Draco. "You know, I once knew someone in your situation. Someone who was from a family not a lot unlike yours, and who rebelled against them and picked his own path in life… Of course, it's a kind of pain that never quite leaves a person, even when they find new people that become their family."
“I don’t know what else you expected to achieve,” Harry said as he worked open the buttons on Draco’s trousers, one by one. Draco opened his mouth to say something, but his eyes followed Harry’s actions. The man’s every movement burned, dripping straight into Draco’s erection which was now separated from Harry’s fingers only by the fabric of his boxers.
“What do you think?” Draco said as they walked the corridors, heading towards the library. They passed by several Aurors and other officials from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, recognizable by a badge they all wore with the letters “DMLE” embossed on it. They all nodded to Harry and he nodded back, but didn’t respond to their attempts at small-talk. Draco wasn’t sure if he was just imagining it, but it felt like many of the officials and Aurors were surprised to see him with Harry. It was unthinkable they wouldn’t have known about Harry’s marriage, as someone had leaked that information to none other than Rita Skeeter a mere few months ago. The headlines had been most imaginative, but they paled in comparison to the articles themselves, which described elaborate (and expensive) celebrations in vivid detail, none of which had actually taken place. Draco doubted their Magistrate counter-wedding could have been twisted to look so grand, even if by some miracle both of their families would have attended.
"It's not as good as it sounds," Draco said. "If you get stabbed while wearing this, you still get stabbed. You still bleed out, you still feel the pain, you just never die."
And when the ruthlessly hot August comes and reminds Narcissa of a summer she spent in Vladivostok with Lucius, the sun blazing her skin and long dresses flowing against her legs in the wind, only to be hiked up by wandering hands in the cool hours of the evening, she receives word that Draco has indeed returned to Darthorn. Narcissa doesn't know where her son has spent the summer, and it seems none one of the letters where she practically begged him to join them at their Moscow home have changed his mind about going back to live with Muggles and the most common and uncivilized of wizarding folk.
“Must’ve been last Saturday," Larry said. “It was that day there was that awful thunderstorm! Just two days before you and Mr. Malfoy sneaked out in the middle of the night to Merlin knows where-”
“Harold?” Draco said, frowning. Harry nodded towards the owl that was half-asleep on Harry’s bookshelf. “You said his name was Hector.”
“I suppose Scamander would have noticed the body on the way in, if Toadsworth had been killed just as she had left your office.”
“Oh… Sorry to hear that,” Neville said, wheeling around. “It’s freezing out here. Want to chat inside? That way we’ll be safe from any murderer, too, I reckon.”
Malfoy had been avoiding Harry since the Amortentia incident. Harry was sure of this, as he had been without a pair in two Magical Injury classes already. The task of coming up with an excuse for professor Skepperus as to why they hadn’t completed the previous assignment had also been forced on Harry. He had figured professor Skepperus would just give them a little more time and they could try again, but to his horror Skepperus had given them a whole new assignment instead. Harry was anxious to talk about it to Draco in fear that they would both soon fail the class, but Draco was nowhere to be found. Harry had even spent a whole afternoon reading in the courtyard the previous week, hoping that Draco would pass through. He hadn’t.
Later, after Draco had convinced Harry that he could handle Theodore Nott, Harry followed Draco to the door, not really knowing how they would manage a parting with Remus waiting in the kitchen, pretending to be very interested in the ceiling.
“Nah mate, nothing like that. I can do it to you if you want - don’t even have to touch you or anything.”
“Um - okay," Harry said. He heard the distant creak of the front door being opened and could tell from the humming that it was Dean. The guy had a habit of constantly bobbing his head and mouthing lyrics of songs, as if there was always a wrock concert going on inside his dead.
Harry stopped and just stood there for a while, staring at orange leaves that had been plastered against the pavement by neverending showers of water and wind. Although he was already looking forward to getting started on homework, he felt a little absent-minded. He thought about the spare bedroom in Remus and Tonks' house, and the comforting noise that came to be when raindrops pounded against its window. The wallpaper had a wolfsbane pattern. Harry wondered where he would sleep if Remus and Tonks had another baby. Maybe he would just visit and spend the nights at Grimmauld Place?
As if on cue, Neville, or at least Harry assumed it was Neville who was carrying a large, potted plant that looked like it had a green head of hair instead of leaves, almost tripped on the doorstep. Harry took a few steps in an attempt to catch the plant, were it to fall, but somehow Neville managed to keep his balance.
“I don’t know," Draco huffed. “Professor Abboud said it could be that I was using a copper cauldron, but even she couldn’t be sure.”
"I had a panic attack again," Harry said, his nervousness peeking through his tone. "I was the only one who didn't pass. What if…" Harry stopped walking, restlessly shifting his weight from one foot to the other. "What if I just haven't got what it takes? To be an Auror."
“And yet look what you have!” Malfoy shouted and gestured at some imaginary people on his left. “You have the friends you grew up with, galleons in the bank and the whole wizarding world at your feet, ready to greet the great Auror Potter whenever he deems it suitable to let the commoners bask in his glory.”
“Is it just me,” Draco said, stepping closer to Harry, “or is Mr. Potter feeling just a tiny bit jealous today?”
again to figure out where he was. He found himself crouching inside a very familiar - and very unpleasant - cupboard under a staircase. The place was so frequently featured in his nightmares that Harry had to stop and think on whether he had actually woken up that morning. He then remembered his foolproof method for checking if he was dreaming and looked at his watch twice - it showed 8.30 in the morning both times. Not a dream. Harry wondered if the mirror could have sent him into the past, but quickly decided against it. There was something surreal and claustrophobia-inducing about the space, something subtly but obviously different from the actual memories Harry had of the place.
They walked in an awkward silence. Harry didn’t know what to say - he couldn’t tell Draco why he had been crying without ruining everything and Draco would definitely see through any excuse he tried to make.
“I didn’t know her. I extended an offering to three persons I found eligible for the position, and she was the only one that was willing. It surprised me, I must say. Professor Abboud from Darthorn, who is an old student of mine, told me Toadsworth had been planning her retirement for years, and that not much could be expected from her.”
"No, you're right," Draco said. "You're right, we… I never hit him like father did but I wasn't nice to him. I was everything but nice to him."
"The symbol is much older than Tales of Beedle the Bard. See, somehow the ancient Egyptians managed to enchant this amulet so that while you wear it, you can't die."
Harry and Draco break into professor Skepperus' office, but not everything goes according to plan. When it comes to the past, are Harry and Draco really just two sides of the same coin?
Draco attacked before Harry could brace himself. They wrestled and played like neither of them had ever had the chance to do as kids, laughing themselves silly before eventually falling asleep in a tangled mess of hairy legs and arms.
“You were?” Harry said. He wasn’t exactly sure what the alternative would’ve been - the only way to get past the door was to talk to Larry.
“That bastard Theo was lurking in the dorm. Said he’d jinx me as soon as I showed my face. Obviously the git wanted to get back at me for what happened earlier”, Draco said as he cumbersomely pulled off the drenched hoodie that had plastered itself onto his arms. “So, I thought I’d come here and ask if I could maybe stay for tonight, but considering all the trouble I just went through, I don’t think I’m taking no for an answer.” Draco sat down on Harry’s bed and started to untie his shoes.
“I said, do you like that,” he repeated, and regretted that his own pleasure was leaking through the words and eating at the assertion.
"Then they won't be able to move from sun to shade when they want to... I don't have the heart to do it. And anyway, they feel like friends now. Had them like this all summer when I was at Cuddlebogs," Neville said.
“Yeah, but that’s just because of Charlie," Ron said. “I want to have something of my own, you know? I don’t want to be just ‘Charlie Weasley’s little brother who also became a dragonologist’ or ‘The Weasley Twins’ little brother who sometimes sweeps the floors’.”
“Careful, Potter," Draco laughed as he helped Harry stand up straight. “It’d be pretty lame of you to smash your head on the floor and die after surviving the killing curse twice, don’t you think?”
“Forget I said that," Harry said as he realized there was no way Draco could have known about Paddington Bear.
Ron smiled and felt the top of his head. He had recently gotten a buzz cut (mainly because most of his hair had burned off when he had been helping Seamus, Fred and George with testing out the new fireworks), and still wasn’t quite used to it.
“It would seem that Mr. Longbottom received a letter from someone," Larry whispered. “The letter also contained a postcard addressed to you and Mr. Malfoy. I saw Miss Granger read it and put it in that little purse she carries everywhere with her! What do you make of that?”
Potter mumbled something incomprehensible and rolled over. Draco huffed impatiently and pushed him again, harder this time.
"I don't look that bad, do I?" Harry said and gladly abandoned the chore of folding his clothes that he had, as usual, stuffed into his trunk only when he had already been a little late for the train. "I know I need a haircut."
The sun had already risen when Harry woke up. Draco was snuggled up against him, the hair on the back of his head tickling Harry’s nose. Judging by Draco’s breathing, he was still asleep. Harry had a hard time imagining Draco suffering from insomnia like he had said he did - every time Harry saw him sleep, he seemed to fall asleep enviably quickly and stay asleep until further notice. An ungodly amount of time, that is.
"So Lucius was not wrong to worry," Remus then said, placing down his mug. "Harry really has corrupted his son."
“Is that the face of regret I’m looking at?” Draco said when they heard the front door close in the first floor.
“I don’t know what you expect. This is what you keep choosing for us - and you know, I’ll help you through all the breakdowns that you need to have, but you’d think that at some point,” Draco pinched his eyes together, knowing he was letting his frustration out more than had been his intention, “you’d think that maybe at some point you’d stop trying not to disappoint everyone at work and be more worried about disappointing me.”
Draco looked at Harry with an expression that should have been reserved for looking at Quidditch accidents as they happened.
“Don’t be so dramatic," Granger laughed. “We’re not kids anymore. Besides - Harry talks about you a lot. About how you’ve changed, and I don't think the way we were as teenagers should determine the rest of our lives, do you?"
“Can I hold you?” Draco asked. Harry stared back at him, trembling. He nodded, and Draco carefully moved closer and wrapped his arms around Harry.
The way Draco pronounced the author’s name made Harry think about their conversation with Lucius, and how Draco had asked him if he had taken Narcissa to Russia.
“That’s not true," Harry said. “You passed Logic and Strategy with the best grades in the programme, remember?”
"So, how long have you two been going out?" Harry asked, making effort to sound casual and also to ignore what had just happened.
"Teddy is Draco's first cousin, once removed," Remus confirmed, nodding. "Given the circumstances, I think it might be wise for you to reconnect with some of the forgotten branches in your family," he said, directing his words to Draco. "I hope you'll let Harry bring you to meet Teddy some day."
“So the heir knows I stole it from father,” Draco said. “He needs it to save Adrik… He assumes I sold it, so now he’s looking for it...”
“If you had let Voldemort kill you," Harry said, “there would’ve been no one at the manor to lie to Bellatrix that it wasn’t me.”
An amused huff escaped into the bottom of Draco’s now empty glass. How many cases ago had this been? It must have been a year already since they had come to Fort William, so six months from the wedding. Draco leaned back in the chair, content despite everything, still in disbelief that they had managed to get the house. Not that they didn’t have the funds - though the same couldn’t have been said for Draco’s work brewing Headache Potions at a small clinic nearby, Harry’s work was well paid for. It was just the nature of his work that the loan negotiator at Gringotts hadn’t found most reassuring. According to him, Aurors were twice as likely as anyone else to get killed on duty, and even worse, not be able to pay back their loans. To this, Draco and Harry had glanced at each other and shared a smile. They had agreed not to tell the goblin at Gringotts that as soon as they had secured the house, Harry was going to quit.
“Right?” Hermione said, her eyes wide. She sighed, and her shoulders fell a bit. “Someone understands at least," she said. “I talked about it to Ron, but he thinks making it downright illegal would be overreacting.”
“Something just happened to me where I didn’t really feel like myself anymore," Harry then continued, fiddling restlessly with his pencil. “I was panicking all the time for no reason and didn’t really sleep until they put me on Calming Draughts at the hospital.”
“To tell you, my asshat friend, that he was offered a promotion to Head of the Department last October. They gave him until New Year’s to consider.”
“She didn’t look me in the eyes many times,” McGonagall said. “I didn’t pay much attention to it, as I’m under the impression it is not customary in many Nordic societies. She studied everything else in my office very carefully, to the point I sometimes felt she was hardly listening to what I was saying. I thought that she was perhaps prone to daydreaming.”
After a couple more hours of restless sleep, Harry got up, got dressed and went to have breakfast with his flatmates. He found himself zoning out constantly, sinking into strange thoughts that made his friends, though they were sitting right there, seem distant and foreign.
“Agreed”, Harry said. “We did use one. A spell, I mean. Well, Draco did, but I didn’t… Exactly pay attention.”
“That means it’s got to be one of those”, Draco said and turned to look at the shelves that towered over them from each wall.
When Draco didn't say anything to reply, she continued and turned to the window with heavy, mustard-coloured velvet curtains hanging on its sides. Her eyes reflected the white of the frozen landscape outside.
“Yeah," Harry said. He glanced around the room. Everyone was staring at him. “Does someone have a problem with that?”
“Oh?” Draco said, taking a deep breath of fresh air before stepping inside the other greenhouse. The cold current still stung his lungs, but he already felt better. “She was here, then? Before she was…”
"We're not going to get that far if you keep talking like that," Harry muttered as Draco freed his hand from where Harry was holding it down, beginning to unbuckle Harry's belt as Harry hooked his thumb under the waistbands of both Draco's joggers and the boxers he wore underneath, pulling them down.
“I’m pretty sure everyone remembers that Howler… All the Slytherins thought it was fucking cool though.”
“And how is it supposed to look?” He asked and then felt unable to continue thinking any longer. He took off his glasses.
Draco frowned, and his heart beat faster, whispering things of war and murder and awful things that couldn't be avoided.
"It's just a bee. They don't do anything if you don't swing your arms at them. Anyway, it's good that you've found him."
“A lot of stuff," Harry said. “About what happened during the war and what he’s been up to since then… He’s really changed, you know.”
“Well, I suppose you mean without lighting them and seeing if the fumes they produce are toxic," Skepperus said and scratched the top of his head.
"Did Voldemort torture you for it?" Remus asked, and Harry was a little taken aback by his forwardness. Even so, he couldn't help but look at Draco with an earnest passion to know, because he too had wondered the same thing.
“No," Harry said. Despite the hours and hours he had talked (and snogged, to be fair) with Draco the previous night, Draco hadn’t mentioned anything about Hermione. “When?”
Draco wandered in between the greenhouses. The glass walls were lifeless, and the gray weather had brought about an eerie atmosphere to the place. It didn’t bother Draco - that is, until he saw movement inside one of the greenhouses. His fingers curled around the wand in the pocket of his coat, although it was most likely just Professor Sprout tending to some plants. Draco stared at the figure, and before long he realized the person inside was far too tall to be Sprout, and had broad shoulders. A man, if Draco’s eyes didn’t betray him. Could it be Neville? Draco knew he had begun teaching alongside Sprout some years ago, but it still seemed strange that he would stay at Hogwarts for the holidays. The figure moved and Draco crouched, but too late - the person inside turned around and saw him. But Draco saw him too, and realized there was nothing to be afraid of.
“Take off your glasses," Draco said. Harry did and placed them in Draco’s hand that was already held out, waiting. Draco placed the glasses on the writing desk and then turned his attention back to Harry. His gaze brushed past Harry’s mouth again, and only that was enough to create an anticipating shudder in him. What was taking him so long?
“So you saw someone, anyway? In Hogsmeade? I’m asking because that would be a very good thing. You would have an alibi.”
The two stared at each other for a few seconds. Weasley, as usual, looked reluctant to exist on the same plane as Draco, and Draco had a feeling he hadn't come to see him voluntarily.
“Ah, you’re not Neville after all,” the woman said with a wide smile on her face. She was quite young, and she had a dark complexion that made her skin glow like satin. She wore her hair up, wrapped in a patterned scarf, and her robes were very colourful.
"I'm not going near that thing," Draco huffed and decided to take his chance while the bee was still at the other end of the room. "Move over."
Harry didn't answer, which alone was answer enough. He wrapped his arms tightly around Draco, though Draco could tell from the weight of his arms that he was exhausted. Harry smelled like himself. Harry Potter's Auror Adventures, and coffee. Dark magic and alleyways. An ugly world filled with vendetta that Draco had once lived in, but had had no intention of returning to. Except, perhaps, if it was to save his future from being clouded by the muddy waters of his past. A past that, admittedly, he had been too eager to leave behind and think it wouldn't come back to haunt him.
“Ordering your little assistant around like that,” Draco continued, keeping his voice low and dragging. “Come now. That won’t do, will it? Gwen’s a good girl. I know one when I see one. And it’s not her fault I’m good-looking.”
Harry thought about how much he feared losing Ron, and for a moment he felt sorry for Pansy. That was, until he remembered about the Amortentia. Merlin knew how long she could have kept giving it to Draco without anyone knowing…
"I'm not killing it," Draco announced, ducking his head at the insect even though it had now flown two feet above his head. "Fuck no."
"Fuck, fuck I'm gonna-" Draco whimpered as he came, his orgasm causing his whole body to jerk and Harry's throbbing cock to twitch inside him as his muscles tightened around it. The way Draco pulsed in waves left Harry powerless, delirious, he couldn't stop fucking him through it, and Draco was trembling under him, his release teasing, dragging itself out.
Harry wasn't sure why, but what he had initially found amusing about Ron's reaction now started to annoy him a little. Wasn't this a little too dramatic?
A silence filled with rainfall, a flash of lightning and a thunderclap followed. Harry hesitated. His chest felt tight with nervousness, but there was really no better time than the present, right? It was just him and Hermione, at least for a short moment still before Neville would return from the Owlery.
The Alchemy Lab was a set of three classrooms, all connected by the hallway in which Harry was now standing. He had never been inside, but he knew where to go as only the last classroom had light shining through the closed door. He took off his shoes and managed to get to the door without making a single sound. He pressed his ear against it, but heard nothing except little clinks and clanks of glass dishes and instruments being moved from one place to the other. Harry listened for quite a while, and soon he was sure that Malfoy was inside alone. Two students brewing something would have made more noise, and even if the other one had just been sitting there, surely they would have at least talked to each other. Harry wasn’t quite sure how to proceed. This was the perfect opportunity to talk to Malfoy but he didn’t want to make it seem like he had stalked him or something. Even though he kind of had, hadn’t he?
It was already dark when Harry heard a quiet clink from his window. He thought he had imagined it, but then he heard it again. Harry put down the comic he had been reading, got up and saw a small paper crane poking at his window while flapping its wings frantically. Harry quickly opened the window to let it in, and the crane fluttered onto Harry's bed before going limp. Harry took it into his hands and noticed it was all damp from the rain. He carefully unfolded it, trying not to tear the paper. There was something written on it.
"What?" Harry felt worried all of a sudden. That didn't sound like Luna at all. "Out of Magizoology? Why? I mean, she's so good at it."
“Sorry. This place is a mess," Harry said as he picked up the pile of clothes that was covering his only chair, and threw them into the corner of the room where his trunk was.
And by the time the first snow arrives, she has made her decision. Draco has gone too far for her to reach now, but there is someone who has saved his son before, someone who can be guilted into saving him again with words of family he never had, and loyalty he has too much of. A portkey is made and Narcissa travels to meet Harry Potter.
“Oh, definitely not, not after I had to resort to some, well, alternative means to look like anything next to that git. I don’t know him, you say? Then explain to me why he hasn’t yet declined the offer. If he really planned to retire, he would’ve done that as soon as-”
“Many people are pale,” Harry said, “but that doesn’t mean they’re incapable of murder. Of course, there’s no pointing fingers before I’ve mapped out who else was in the castle.”
”. Harry tried not to make much of a mental note of it but couldn’t really help himself. By the time they got to Draco’s room he had already repeated it in his thoughts so many times he knew he was never going to forget it.
It's snowing in London. A rare sight even in December, and Narcissa takes it in as she stares out the window and tries to ignore the Muggle woman with a squirming little toddler who sits next to her. She has missed England and it saddens her that there's nothing for her here anymore. She knows Lucius isn't planning on coming back, and she thinks him wise for that, because in Russia he is what he once was in England, if not more. Everyone knows him and he knows everyone, and they admire him for having served the Dark Lord personally. He has started to invite people over for dinner and Narcissa enjoys it because it reminds her of the way things used to be. But Draco is missing and she doesn't understand what people are saying and she hates it. Well, she
"A lot of other days too," Harry said, staring at the pile of sand that now hid within it a 5000-year-old amulet worth more than twelve million galleons.
“I’m not sure if I should tell you," Granger said, her shoulders dropping. “But I haven’t seen Harry like this in a long time, so I-”
“A Muggle gets hurt," Harry corrected. “And then write down how we would heal him using Muggle techniques.”
“Amortentia? And who… what gave you that idea?” Draco couldn’t help but feel a little betrayed that Harry had told her.
Never missing a chance to assert his equal dominance, Draco stroked Harry's cock, his fingers gliding over the tip, teasing as they pressed it against his entrance.
“Because then I would’ve looked like a massive git, that’s why," Draco huffed. “Why did you give me an eight, anyway?”
“Yeah," Harry sighed. “It honestly seems like he’s only doing it to try and make his parents proud.”
“Not anything out of the ordinary," Hermione said wearily. “Honestly, I don’t know how anything gets done in this country with the way decisions are made. It’s like watching Ents talk.”
now? So you actually fancy him? And, and you’re expecting me to just say, ‘oh okay Harry, you know what, love who you love’?”
“Positively," Larry said. “Mr. Longbottom looked most distressed over the matter! I even heard him say, ‘Harry is going to kill me if he finds out’.”
“What’s there to cram?” Draco asked, ignoring Skepperus and the sounds of chairs being moved as the class was dismissed. “You know how to defend yourself.”
“Yeah… Guess he kind of needed you around.” Draco let out a faint sigh. “Although, he didn’t expel me either when… when I tried to…”
Draco looked at Remus, and Harry couldn't quite tell what he was thinking. Something vaguely melancholic and also grateful, judging by the way his lips pursed together in not quite a smile but not not-a-smile either. He nodded.
On Saturday morning, after a late breakfast with Neville, Harry started doing some reading for one of his independent courses. Its name, A Closer Look at the B-6 Class of Ministry of Magic Forms Currently in Official Use, was an omen of how mind-numbingly boring the reading materials were. They were written in an overflowingly formal style that was practically begging to come across as pretentious. The text was abundant with complicated words that no one actually used in real life, and Harry found himself reading a sentence and forgetting what it was about by the time he got to the end. When this started happening with every sentence, he tossed the book onto his bed and decided to work on something more practical.
“Eff off”, Seamus laughed. “Me and the fella figured we ought to make sure you’re playing it safe, if you know what I mean.”
"Are you alright?" Neville asked. He was holding one of his ceramic pots, its little feet dangling in the air. Judging by the state of Neville's hands he had once again been digging for soil in the courtyard.
Harry woke up on Monday morning at 4AM to another paper crane behind his window. He turned on the light, got out of bed, fairly sure he was dreaming it all, and opened the window. The crane crashed into the floor and flopped there like a fish on dry ground until Harry picked it up. He unfolded it and squinted at the blurred lines. He then realized he wasn’t wearing his glasses. After finding them on his desk and putting them on, he could read the note.
After the lecture Ron and Harry ran into Hermione, who had just come back from another of the numerous visits to the Ministry of Magic that were part of her programme.
“-which is precisely why you must go,” Arthur said. “It will be suspicious if you refuse now, it will seem like you know something you're not supposed to.”
“I always see it in the papers,” Neville said while he gently inspected the leaves of the plant. “Case after case after case… It doesn’t surprise me anymore. Harry has always been someone who has to sacrifice a lot to feel worthy, but I had hoped…”
"Piss off, the lot of you," Seamus said and held the paper in front of him. "The resemblance is uncanny."
“I’m not," Harry said. He tried to, but he just couldn't look Ron in the eyes. He was still trying to process the fact that he had kissed Draco and Draco had kissed him back instead of jinxing him.
In my defense, he thought, surprised that he was still able to do so while being intertwined in a kiss with Harry on top of him, who could blame me for not wanting to part with him? A rhetorical question, of course, for the queue for such an event would have been long and impatient. Which in turn, made flipping Harry around and pinning him down on the bed and freely and admittedly, possessively grabbing his thighs and pulling him closer, much more exciting. Harry’s lips parted a little in surprise, but as was typical to him, he quickly adjusted. He was a simple man at heart, Draco had noticed - as long as there was making out and eventually ejaculation involved, he didn’t seem to mind what Draco did to him.
“It is not a word I use to belittle someone, Mr. Malfoy. In fact, the opposite is true - I feel Mr. Potter has done more for our cause than perhaps any other wizard of the past, present or future can ever hope to achieve. I would see him live a peaceful life somewhere, planting potatoes, were it up to me.”
“Do you remember professor Toadsworth?” Ron said. He crossed his arms and stepped forward from the ranks of his siblings. He was wearing a knitted jumper with a checkered pattern that looked like a great prompt for an instant headache. I was most likely an early Christmas present from Molly.
“Would you just shut up for two seconds and listen?” Granger exclaimed. Draco suddenly remembered a certain slap in the face he had received a few years ago. He shut up.
“What?” Draco said. He leaned in and murmured against Harry’s ear. “You wish you could fuck me right here against the wall, huh?”
“Exactly," Hermione said. “Kings and queens have been buried with their same-sex lovers for millenia and yet in history books it is always described how 'they must have had a wonderful friendship'.”
“Lastly, as you’ve without a doubt been told before, these challenges have been chosen for each of you based on your weakest points in last year’s final exams. You’ve had the summer to improve on these areas, and I trust you will all prove to me that you have done so. Now," she said, clapping her hands together, “any questions?”
“Did you try the smudge-removing charm?” Harry said before Draco had time to verbally question the strange atmosphere. In a small gesture, he shook his head.
Harry skipped down the stairs and into the courtyard, but Malfoy wasn't there. Harry turned around, preparing to climb back to the seventh floor when he saw Malfoy coming down the stairs. He was wearing slacks and a green jumper with a white collar peeking out of the neckline, and was drinking something out of a black thermos mug. Pansy Parkinson followed him all the way down before stopping at the last step.
“Mr. Malfoy and yourself?” Larry said. He grinned. “My lips are sealed, Mr. Potter. You can count on me.”
Harry ignored Theodore's cursing - it didn't sound as bad considering his voice was becoming squeakier by the second - and watched as he turned into a duck. The duck stared at him for a moment and quacked.
"Don't be a fool, Draco. A sick goat is buried, not eaten. I don't wish to see any children from you."
“Uh," Harry said and started to feel restless as he realized all the questions he had for Malfoy had escaped him. “Why haven’t you been in class?” That seemed like a safe one to start with.
“It’s," Malfoy started, and Harry wasn’t sure if he had imagined it, but for a moment he looked a little flushed as he quickly turned to look away from Harry, “it’s your hair. It always sticks straight up after you’ve slept.”
“Merlin, Draco," he said, “it’s like, what, five in the morning? A little early to pounce on me, don’t you think?”
Everyone’s eyes were on Draco and Harry, and now Draco turned to look at Harry too. Apparently the owl
When Harry returned to the dorm, he found Ron sobbing at the kitchen table. The man startled at the sound of the door opening and started to hurriedly wipe his face.
"Doesn't feel very manly being swept off my feet like this," Harry noted as he landed on top of Draco.
Harry smiled and his eyes met Hermione's. Clearly she had had the same idea about trying to cheer Neville up.
Harry nearly choked on his tea. It was no news that word got around fast in his friend group, but the thing was, he had only left Draco’s dorm ten minutes ago. And no one knew what had happened, except maybe Theodore Nott, provided Draco’s charm on the door had worn off at some point.
"Mmh, you coming for me Draco? Fuck, you're so- oh fuck... do it, do it, come for me Draco, fuck..."
"Poor old bugger... Last time I interviewed him must've been three years ago. Other foot in the grave already back then if you ask me."
“Scars," Draco said and turned to look at the notebook. “Which date should we put as the new due date?”
“On the first day at Magical Injury," Draco said, realizing he had forgotten to give Harry any kind of context as to what he was talking about.
Harry felt the pleasure spill over - he came, incoherently begging for Draco's name, his orgasm rippling fire and absolute bliss into his every cell and his vision momentarily fading to white from the exploding release.
They stumbled to it in the darkness, their steps muffled by the thick rug that covered the floor, and opened the doors. It was obvious they wouldn’t fit inside very well.
“I see your friend is not with you tonight. I hope he isn’t ill anymore", Larry said, and then the door swung open. Harry frowned as he walked inside. Was Draco his friend now?
“Trying to," said Ron and started to tickle Hermione who started to simultaneously giggle and complain that her stomach was hurting.
Then began the ritual that had taken place after every Magical Injury class for the past two weeks. Harry and Draco would walk out of the classroom after everyone had already left, talking about something and then kind of awkwardly linger in the hallway, unaware of where the other one was planning to go and if it was in the same direction of the other’s destination, or perhaps if they would go somewhere together.
“Sounds kind of creepy," Ron said. “I mean, imagine if the Whomping Willow could talk! Would’ve woken up the whole bloody school when Harry and I crashed into it.”
“I’ve already threatened to graffiti over every single one of his portraits," a voice said behind Harry. Harry turned around and saw Draco sitting on the stairs leading up to the next floor. They looked at each other in silence as Theodore Nott from Draco’s dorm skipped down the stairs past them.
Harry tried to keep a straight face as he pretended to read Malfoy's homework. He was just waiting for Malfoy to get to the good part.
The words hit Draco hard, and for a moment it felt like everything he had been bottling up would burst out of him any second now. His eyes wandered the floor.
Draco frowned and sunk deeper into the uncomfortable feeling that he hadn’t the faintest idea of what was going on. Potter’s hair was pointing out in all different directions, and Draco couldn’t help but wonder how the strands had the strength to stand up on their own like that despite being so long.
turn back as much as he did now, but the people, the press, everything… Everything was buzzing and prickling and moving and Harry just wanted it to be still. He wanted it to be quiet and empty and just Draco and him. Out of context.
“Yeah, I noticed,” Draco murmured against Harry’s neck, brushing a hand against the heat of his arousal, “tell me, what else makes you go hard?”
Harry and Draco go out on a date, and the aftermath makes Harry wonder if Draco knew what he signed up for.
“I know about STDs”, Harry said, although now he was feeling like a right fool for not having remembered such a thing existed. “I just didn’t… It just kind of happened.”
“The Prophet is publishing my essay!” Hermione said and looked like she was about to burst in excitement.
Harry looked at Draco and then turned his gaze to the window. It was so dark outside he could only see his reflection from it.
Seamus Finnigan didn't study at Darthorn - he had recently gone to work with the Weasley twins on product development for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Something to do with fireworks, if Harry remembered correctly. Either way, it made sense that he would have come to visit - after all, Paddington wasn't too far away from Diagon Alley and several of his friends, including Dean Thomas, Neville, Ron and Harry all lived in the same dormitory.
, ready to stupefy anyone else in the tent. He lowered his wand a little when he realized he was alone. He wasn’t really surprised he hadn't been chosen for duelling as it always been one of his strong suits, but as someone had once - or actually, plenty of times - told him, there was rarely any harm in constant vigilance. Harry looked around the tent, expecting to find a cursed object waiting for him on a table somewhere, but the whole space was stripped of furniture. The only thing
“If only you still had that Time-Turner," Ron said. He raised his arm in an invitation, and Hermione scooted closer, cuddling up next to him so that Harry could barely see her face from behind her massive scarf.
“It’s just my complexion, I’m sure,” Draco said and gave a formal nod. “I’ll be off then, professor Wataida.”
Hands in his pockets, Harry stepped a little closer to the wall to read what sentence was underlined on one of the book pages.
It's only now that Narcissa notices the kiss mark on Draco's neck that he's very obviously trying to hide with his hand. She glances at Potter, who is still waiting for Draco in the freezing cold. Her mind starts to piece it all together - the article, them holding hands, and then her memory takes her back. Draco had never stopped talking about Harry Potter, had he… But she always thought - surely it should have been unthinkable that he would...
"So, I- I'll see you later," Draco said. "And good. That, that you like the book, I mean. Or love it, whatever. I mean, not whatever, but - fuck." Draco looked as surprised as Harry by his sudden stuttering. "I'm going now, okay?"
“Yeah," Draco said. He seemed really tense, and Harry imagined it was because of the whole speech he had held about being there for each other and shit at the coffee shop that one night. In that moment Harry wished he hadn’t said things like that.
“She’s so different from other girls," Draco said dreamily. “I don’t know why I didn’t notice it before - she even made me coffee this morning! Just for me.”
"Neville is learning how to knit," Hermione explained without raising her eyes from the book. "His legged pots kept him awake all night."
“Harry, I’m failing Charms again," Ron said, his voice muffled against Harry’s uniform jacket. “I’m never going to be an Auror, am I?”
The Parkinson girl fails in giving Draco Amortentia, and Narcissa can't help but think she did so on purpose. Either way, it's surprising. Narcissa never expected the girl's loyalty to be greater towards Draco than her parents who were both doing time in Azkaban - and who Lucius had promised to help in exchange for the girl's trouble.
Before Draco could finish stuttering, Mrs. Weasley’s expression changed, and she squeezed both Harry and Draco by the shoulder. She started guiding them into the house and smiled so that it became visible where the happy wrinkles around her eyes had come from.
Out of curiosity, Harry tried checking out the “no” as well. Another text appeared, overlapping the previous one.
Harry didn't know what to say. He would have wanted to say that Draco didn't know better, that things were different now, but the words felt empty before they had even left Harry's mouth.
“You might have a point," Harry said, but they didn’t get the chance to make a decision before a nurse approached them.
"I- I guess so," Harry said. "I guess it depends on the master. Of the house elf, I mean. Dobby told me he got beat up a lot. At least I didn't have it
"Yeah?" The Triwizard Tournament came to mind, but Harry knew that probably wasn't what Draco was talking about.
“Shut up, will you? You don’t know him. Besides, why do you even care? You’re not in his department.”
"It's just… Are you sure about this? If we have the Wadjet on us, we'll be in far greater danger. If word gets out about such a thing being in the country, who knows who will try to-"
“Yes we do," Harry said. “Draco, I swear I didn’t know what that spell was. I had read it in a stupid book-”
“Notice the tip of the tail is shaped like an arrow. Charming, yes, but not the most pleasant to be slapped in the face with.”
“Good one," Harry laughed. “But yeah, just found out yesterday that Ron and I are having a Practical Examination in a few days with the AT group. So, yeah, I was cramming.”
“I rather think that's up to the people who are stupid enough to do things that can be used against them,” Theodore said. His gaze fixed on Draco, and he smirked. “Why so serious, Malfoy? Potter got your tongue?”
“I feel dizzy," Draco said and hugged his knees, rocking back and forth restlessly. “I wanna see Pansy.”
“You guard his dorm too, don’t you?” Harry said, his eyes widening in realization. “That forest behind you - it’s the same forest as in the portrait on the seventh floor, isn’t it?”
Harry could tell from the way Draco turned around and started to search through drawers for something, that he had let more of his thoughts come out than had been his intention.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat, and he glanced at Draco who had now started to shift, sure to wake up any moment now.
Theodore Nott noticed Harry as he passed through the common area to reach Draco’s door. The boy - well, man now - snickered at him. He still, in Harry’s opinion, resembled a piece of string cheese. He had light hair and even lighter eyebrows that, along with his teeth, gave him a rabbity look.
"The mirror," Draco said, feeling his patience starting to run on mere steam, "is the mirror from Knockturn Alley?"
“Uh- yeah," Harry said and felt a sudden need to talk to someone about everything that had happened with Draco Malfoy.
Narcissa struggles to understand what has happened to her son who, what seems like until only yesterday, was glued to her side, babbling endlessly about Quidditch and books he had read and what that insufferable Potter boy had done at school. Draco has always been such a clever boy, but after the war he has gotten all kinds of twisted ideas into his head. It was as if Lucius, in Draco's eyes, is as cruel as the Dark Lord himself was. Narcissa doesn't know why it's so hard for Draco, who rarely has trouble reading into and understanding even the most subtle of shifts in facial expressions and tones of voices, to realize that all leaders start to abuse their power at some point. It's natural, it's how the world works, and just because they do so, doesn't mean what they originally stood for was incorrect. But with everything that has happened - with all the torture and death Draco has had to both witness and experience, Narcissa fears it's already too late to stop the stain of those memories spreading and tainting all that had once been beautiful about their little family.
"I've got the explosive part covered," Seamus explained, leaning forward on the couch, his left hand nonchalantly resting on Dean's thigh, "but Fred said the visuals could use some work. So, since I happen to know an artist," and now Seamus' hand patted where it had previously rested, "I thought I'd give the course a try."
“What’s this Wadjet business, anyway?” George said, ignoring Harry’s attempt at departure. “Why so much fuss over a necklace?"
“There’s something you should know," the man said and stretched his neck as if trying to see if there was anyone else around. “Are you alone?”
“There’s all these stereotypes about what bottoms are like and what tops are like and so on”, Dean continued, “but they’re really not true most of the time. If they were, then every top would be tall and dominant and masculine.”
"What," Harry breathed even though he knew what Draco meant. It wasn't as if he could do anything before he said it.
“Not long ago," he started, still throwing glances behind his shoulders (as if there was anyone else in the painting), “I overheard Mr. Longbottom and Miss Granger talking, not far from where you’re standing now.”
The article went on to describe how Lucius had shown up and argued with Draco, although the source apparently hadn’t heard any of the conversation. A Gringott’s employee had gone anonymous to reveal that Draco’s rights to the family funds had been discontinued over a year ago.
Harry had taken part in many awkward and tense breakfasts in his lifetime, but this… this was something else. Remus was sitting across the table from Harry and Draco, one leg crossed over the other, a mug of tea in his hands. He kept giving Harry these glances where he looked like he was about to say something, but then he pressed his lips together as if holding back laughter.
“It’s not so bad," Harry said, his finger tracing nonsense words in cursive onto the table. “He’s actually a lot nicer these days.”
“Leech”, Draco said, his nose twitching in disgust as he pulled it out from the bag. “I found it under my bed just before Theo started casting
“Yeah," Harry said. “Lame.” There was a wisp of hair in front of Draco's eyes, and Harry could tell from his breathing that he had managed to catch him purely because of adrenaline. Harry noticed Draco’s bottom lip was a little chapped near the corners of his mouth.
Draco, who seemed surprisingly unbothered by the situation once he had gotten over the initial shock of waking up to his old Defence Against the Dark Arts professor barging into the room (perhaps because he didn't know Remus personally), was sitting up with admirable posture, Harry's lended jumper loosely draping over his form. Neither Draco or Harry had remembered to hang up Draco's soaked hoodie for the night, so by the time they had rushed to get dressed, it had still been damp from the rain that had poured down the previous evening. In Harry's opinion Draco looked very good in his jumper, and not only because it had the Gryffindor lion embroidered on it, which provided for delicious contrast when taking in account the circumstances; but it also felt strangely satisfactory to see Draco in his clothes, as if what was Draco and what was Harry had been fraying at the edges, dissolving into something much more exciting than what they were separately.
"Draco," Narcissa says, holding a hand to Draco's cheek. "You did your best. And you were just a boy. You mustn't blame yourself."
Seamus was the same as before, Harry noticed, despite the recent - or not so recent, who knew - development of events. He was still the same, cheerful guy with a charming accent.
Harry was then called to the kitchen to help with some plates, and probably to catch up in private because Merlin knew Harry couldn't reach the top shelves any more Mrs. Weasley could, and Draco was left in the living room alone with Ron.
“Fair point. I suppose I’ve been talking to the Mandrakes too much… Why are you here, anyway? It’s Christmas.”
want to kiss Draco. And now it was too late to pretend he didn't. Ron would never look at him the same ever again, would he? They wouldn’t laugh together or do homework or go see Quidditch games or spend weekends at the Burrow.
And yet despite this, Draco was secretly relieved and even a little excited to finally have someone to talk to. He had spent the first year pretty much in his dorm, studying and failing miserably whenever he tried to cook something for himself, only coming out for classes and occasionally at night to brew himself Calming Drought when he couldn’t sleep. He hadn’t expected his second year at Darthorn to be any different, and it was actually kind of baffling how fast things had changed. Just because of a small coincidence - hadn’t Draco been late that first morning, he wouldn’t have been assigned a seat next to Potter, and none of this would have happened.
"I have enough to last me for another six months. After that, I'll get a job." Draco turned back to look at Harry, a sly smile on his face. "I heard they're looking for cleaners at the Ministry."
“Some of it. At one point I was on a boat with my father - we were in a forest, travelling down a still stream. There was mist on top of the water and I was leaning over the edge of the boat to see where we were going, and then… Then I saw a rotting elk carcass in the water. It drifted past us very slowly and that's all that happened. I’d never really thought about death before and after seeing that I... I changed. So much so that my father wanted me looked at. I started walking with my head down because I was afraid I'd step on a bug if I wasn't careful. Then one time I saw Crabbe and Goyle torturing a spider and had a panic attack in the bathroom.”
"How are you, professor?" Draco said once the silence had lingered for an unsettling amount of time.
" scribbled next to it), Harry hadn't come up with much yet. He wasn't sure where to draw the line - did his scar count as an injury? It wasn't as if there was a protocol on how to treat people who had survived the killing curse. And what about all the times he had passed out? Should he list them all individually?
The woman unsteadily walked to a desk that stood in front of a window and pulled out a roll of parchment from the drawer. She nodded to Draco.
"Ah, you noticed," Seamus said and patted on Dean's thigh again, "you should've seen Ron's face when he found out a few minutes ago!" Seamus laughed.
Harry felt his insides curl up a little bit. He hadn't expected to see Malfoy here. And he hadn't expected him to look so different. Harry remembered him always looking put together at Hogwarts, never mind the pasty, anxious complexion and the bags that had appeared under his eyes around year seven. Now he looked well rested - in fact, it was as if he had rolled out of bed no longer than fifteen minutes ago. His hair was messy, he wasn't wearing the tie that was a part of the Darthorn uniform, and besides, he was late. He carried a shoulder bag that looked like crumpled up papers were going to pour out at any second. It didn't seem like him at all.
“Yeah. Write something like, ‘someone might even put it in an unsuspecting ex-boyfriend’s coffee in an effort to win them back’.”
“Hilarious," Lucious said, dragging his words in a posh accent like he always did. He glanced at Harry, his nostrils twitching. “Perhaps we’ll have a word somewhere more… private.”
“Merlin," she said after calming down a bit, “it’s only the second week and I’m already so tired I could fall asleep right here.”
"We just need to get one thing straight," Ron then said and glanced around the room before stepping a little closer. Draco was fairly certain he was about to get clocked when Ron continued:
“If he did, he didn’t tell me," Ron said. “I reckon they were talking about us.” Ron gave a quick, lopsided smile.
“What makes you so sure?” Hermione asked, leaning forward on the sofa. She had a smug smile in the corner of her mouth. “What do you do when you don’t like someone, Harry?”
Ron and Harry make up just in time for their Practical Evaluation. However, the exam proves to be particularly challenging for one of them...
“You writing a book about what it’s like to be married to the Chosen One?” Theodore said. Draco smiled at him, though the expression contained no good intent.
“Then Weasley just - barges in, just like that, without knocking or anything. So I panic and pretty much throw Harry on the bed, he starts fumbling for his glasses and I get the fuck out of there. I came here, Harry and Weasley are still up there - that’s what happened.”
Harry slid down from his chair, and sitting cross-legged on the floor, started to sort through the pile of papers, chewed-up pencils and erasers that he had poked full of little graphite-coloured dots. Harry flinched as he thought he had seen a spider in between some papers - then, as he noticed it wasn’t moving, he picked it up and in a mixed state of fascination and disgust, tried to figure out what it was. A tiny bezoar? Or maybe a dried-up grape. So, technically a raisin, right?
"Maybe so. But that's not really my problem, is it?" A familiar ice flashed in Draco's eyes and in his tone and Harry started to get worried, but Remus didn't seem to mind.
“What I’m saying is, if they knew, they would send you to a safe house all alone while they tried to work the situation out. Which would take a while, especially since it’s technically unethical to let Harry interfere with a case concerning his father-in-law’s family.”
"He isn't my friend," Draco says. He tilts his head and studies Narcissa with his eyes in that all too familiar way.
Draco doubted it would work, but the wind was howling in his ears so loudly he couldn’t bother to overpower it with his opinion.
Desperate to turn the attention away from his own arousal before it would spill over, Harry reached down for Draco's hand and pinned it against the mattress beside them to keep it from tormenting him at least for a moment, and reached back down with his other hand to tease Draco, gently running his fingers over his crotch where his trousers were pulled taut before lapping his palm over it. The problem was, Harry knew exactly how good it felt, and his blood scorched in his veins in reaction as Draco's back arched and he murmured something incomprehensible against Harry's mouth.
"Father kept all kinds of magical artifacts around the house," Draco said. "He collected and sold them for a living, and when he kicked me out I stole most of what he had left. That's how I've been paying for the tuition."
Draco’s hand moved to the same pace as Harry’s hips, and soon both of them were panting and moaning as quietly as possible. Harry felt in a strange daze, as though his entire body was grounded by the slow pounding of Draco’s prick in his arse, yet his mind drifted and swayed gently in a breeze. Perhaps it was some lingering effects from the gillyweed, blossoming through his blood like moonlit flowers.
, and Harry cried. At some point, he realized, the well in his chest had begun to repair itself. Perhaps he would finally learn what it felt like to be
Before Harry could obey, however, he felt his shirt and waistcoat come off. He leaned forward and nearly lost his balance when rope slithered along his arms and came together above his head. He was effectively bending at the waist with his arms pulled taut above his head. His weight rested on his knees and the rope that tied somewhere off into the distance. A small whimper slipped out when he readjusted his position. Malfoy used Legilimency again, this time showing Harry an image of what exactly he looked like. Harry shivered; it was an awfully humiliating position, his legs spread and his body left helpless.
“Harry, you feel so good, so good for me,” Sir groaned behind him, slamming his prick into Harry with a hunger that melted Harry’s insides.
“His cousin doesn’t live here anymore. He’s got kids now, both wixes.” Millie stretched her arms and fell into a position to stretch her hamstrings. “I read the files. They tried to make him give them up.”
Harry didn’t know when his lover had stopped thrusting, but as Draco pulled out of him, thick dribbles of come leaked down his thighs. He laughed, his voice hoarse, and after a few slow breaths, the ropes around his arms came off. The blindfold went next, and Harry kept his eyes closed. He remained in a kneeling position for a few moments, knowing Draco would take care of him once everything was ready. Sir always took care of him.
, needy, little toy. Aren’t you, Potter?” Sir gripped his chin and lifted his face upward, even though Harry couldn’t see anything.
“When I’m pissed, I look up all kinds of ways to make a man’s prick fall off or disappear or shrink into nothing. Let me treat you to one of my most fascinating finds,” she drawled.
“Mm, good boy,” Sir purred in Harry’s ear. Teeth danced along the rim of his ear and bit gently at the lobe. It almost felt out of place, in this dungeon where Harry would get beaten up to a pulp, but they were no strangers to tender affection. If anything, it made his spine feel like molten golden.
“Mm,” Harry hummed with a loose smile. The fog in his head was clearing slowly, and with it went his energy. He would nap here for a bit, as he always did, with Draco’s fingers lovingly carding through his hair. Sometimes he shivered and wanted to sob for no reason, but not tonight.
Despite his best intentions, despite how deep into submission he was, Harry felt a smirk curl his lips. This was one of their code words. Harry knew what
lecherous chuckle resonating in his head quickly made his blood pool downward. As if simply being here hadn’t aroused him enough. It was a good thing he was well-practiced in self-restraint, else his hands might have found themselves relieving the pressure in his trousers.
“It is my pleasure, Harry,” his lover said. “Your devotion is invaluable. Thank you.” With the utmost care in the world, Draco pulled Harry against him now that he was done with washing and soothing Harry’s bruises. “You were wonderful tonight, I’m so lucky to have a good boy like you.”
He manoeuvred Draco’s prick to his entrance, and slowly let gravity do its job. When he was flush against Draco’s pelvis, Harry began rocking his hips. It was a slow, languorous rhythm. Just enough so it felt brilliant and didn’t wake Draco up. Harry readjusted his knees and leaned forward, his breath hitched with pleasure.
A sickly green wisp flew from his stick and wrapped around her husband’s midsection. His purple face suddenly blanched and his body convulsed a few times. The blond eyed Petunia and cast the curse to her as well. The sickly green wound tightly around her, sinking into her flesh. It
Before Harry could react to the image Malfoy sent him of his pink bum, a series of loud and open-palm spanks stole what little breath he had left. He moaned and arched his back as best he could in this position. The warm presence next to him disappeared for a brief moment, and when it came back Malfoy was right behind him. Harry quivered as he felt Malfoy’s breath along the crease of his arse. They were both breathing heavily, and Harry could feel a pearl of pre-come dribble down his prick. It was absolute torture.
Draco took a deep breath. He’d left Harry with Luna tonight. Today had been a bad day, and this was better than indulging him in joining them. Harry’s reaction to their little vigilante intervention was unexpected. He’d asked to
Petunia isn’t sure how the rest of it went, her mind awake but the fire in her veins trying so desperately to shield her. It wasn’t enough, never enough, she was never
Malfoy stilled Harry’s hips with a firm grip, his fingers bruising the tender flesh. His hot, wet lips travelled down Harry’s spine, tongue tracing the natural lines and definitions of his muscles.
and instead, necessitated a good cleaning the Muggle way. Harry let his eyes linger on the various wooden paddles, the leather restraints, and especially the spanking bench. He licked his dry lips at the thought of what was to come.
Before her eyes, Vernon’s clothes disappeared and fine, papercut-like slashes appeared on his feet. While not much blood appeared, Petunia could tell those tiny cuts burned. Vernon struggled and Petunia tried to look away, only to meet the eyes of one of the freaks. The tight-bun woman lifted her stick in warning; Petunia failed to swallow a sob and returned her eyes to the spectacle of her husband being tortured.
The establishment in question was rather recent, but Harry had been a member from its early days. The Velvet Snare was chic in pureblood fashion, all dark wood and dark reds and blues and golds. Stepping into the lobby, Harry noticed the public playroom was full and vibrating with sexual energy. It was dizzying. He inhaled deeply, both to calm himself and release his nervous energy, and to let the musky scent of the club overwhelm his senses.
When her husband's body stiffened and nothing but unseemly sounds came out of him, she turned her head. A string had appeared out of nowhere and threaded itself through Vernon's lips, effectively sewing them shut. Rivulets of blood ran down his chin and into his moustache as he shook his head furiously. Petunia hadn't realized she was screaming at the top of her lungs until a numbing pain scattered across her own mouth. Frantically, she brought her hands to her face and felt light-headed when they came back red with blood.
The pace of Harry’s hips increased and soon he was panting. He straightened and ran his hands up Draco’s chest, tweaking the nipples on his way. His lover moaned and gave a jerk upwards with his hips, hands immediately clamping onto Harry’s thighs. Stormy grey eyes, the most emotive eyes Harry had ever seen, opened and fixed on Harry’s own prick. Draco chuckled and moved to grab Harry’s hips to guide him in a different cadence.
In horror, Petunia watched his body being pulled upwards by a rope. Stringed up like a hulking piece of meat in the back of a butcher’s shop. Her whole body shook and she turned pleading eyes to their assailants, but it was a useless endeavour. Petunia found herself equally strung and dangling from the ceiling. She felt so helpless, so vulnerable, so
Harry always looked forward to Friday nights. Tonight was no exception. Every five minutes, he checked his watch, impatient and itchy for the hands to reach nine o’clock. He’d made the mistake in the past of arriving at the rendezvous too early, and the wait there was even more painful. On Fridays, he drank a glass of wine (something his partner had selected, of course), ate some food that he couldn’t taste, and changed into something more appropriate for the night’s activities. If it was up to him, Harry would wear his jeans, t-shirt, and hoodie. But no—that was awfully
Malfoy ran his tongue from Harry’s bollocks all the way to his hole. Harry breathed heavily and bit his lip to hold back a whimper of need. “Yes Sir, please.” Harry tried to spread his legs wider, but his knees were trapped by his trousers and pants. He only just realized he’d forgotten to be cheeky, but it hardly mattered. Malfoy was driving him mad.
. The Russian Death Eater was vicious, had always been. He loved torturing, raping, killing Muggles and Muggleborns alike. He revelled in their screams and pleas for their lives, recounting every retching detail to his Death Eater friends. Draco had heard more than he’d ever wanted, and some days he worried Dolohov would barge down his bedroom door and violate him too. He’d made it known he had no preferences, after all. Only that they had to be screaming.
“Green, Sir. Please, Sir, please I beg you, I need… I need you,” Harry whimpered. The words spilled out without his permission, but that was alright. Malfoy was used to bringing Harry to the brink of brokenness. The sweet fog that swirled around his mind was ambrosia, a familiar thrill only Draco Malfoy could bring him. Harry would drink and worship Sir’s ambrosia for all of the parched beings in the world. “Please—!”
“Mm, good boy.” He kissed Harry’s cheek, who lifted his head to intercept the kiss—unsuccessfully. He only received another laugh in return. It sent electrifying shivers all the way down his spine and right into his prick.
This time, the riding crop slapped hard and fast against his inner thigh, just a few inches from his crotch. Harry gasped and moaned, and when he said nothing, Malfoy slapped his inner thigh again and again. Each hit hurt more than the one that came before, and Harry could feel his skin begin to bruise. It was a delicious sensation, and it made him leak into his pants.
“Look at you, an obedient little toy, perfectly primed and ready to be used. Too bad this toy is a cheeky slag, I’ll have to show it who’s in control.” Malfoy drawled into his ear again with his perfect posh accent, his lips brushing against Harry while his hand slowly clawed down his chest. When Harry groaned, Malfoy laughed in that beautifully haughty way of his. “Oh, you like that now, do you?”
“Mm, yes Sir, you know I’m just a—aah, mm!” Harry was interrupted by the tip of a second finger pushing inside him. It was dizzying, he wasn’t sure how much more he could take before all this caused him to become undone. “I’m just a mindless slag for you, Sir!”
