Both Harry and Hermionie look stunned for a moment until Hermionie takes her own wand and fixes the stain and her blouse. Harry looks suspiciously down at his wand.
“In here!” Harry replies, Followed by Theo’s footsteps tramping down the hallway towards the living room.
Harry never brought it up again, he’s fine listening on his own, it’s relaxing, it’s not like he’s lonely or anything.
“He’s different! I can understand how he’s no longer a death eater, fine! But he’s still a prick, he’s never done anything to me to prove that he’s changed. He’s wronged me plenty, and I haven’t gotten an apology!”
“Yup. Come to think of it, I’ve had pretty shit luck when it comes to dating haven’t I?” Harry inquires.
He had thought it best to introduce himself. That way, at least he would no longer be a complete stranger, but the child seemed to have other things on his mind.
He gave her a reassuring smile and nodded, touching her arm to comfort her. She relaxed some, but he could still feel the nervousness emanating from her.
"Come on," Harry whispered, grabbing the child's hand and quickly making off in the opposite direction.
The boy didn't look too convinced. They continued to stare at each other until Harry began to feel very self-conscious and uncomfortable. He was about to say something when voices sounded around the corner. The blond snapped his head around, looking panicked.
"Go back to bed," he told her, when she looked like she wanted to say something else. Whether it was his expression or his tone of voice, or whatever else, she simply nodded and moved towards the door.
As they made their way back to their living quarters, the quiet of the night permeated Draco's muddled emotions, taking him back to another memory.
He was seated beside two witches who, from having eavesdropped on their conversation, turned out to be friends of the older couple that had been abducted. One had just returned from a purported trip to the ladies room, her eyes shining with newly acquired gossip.
"I was wondering whether you knew the way when you strode out of the lift so confidently, but I see that I was right in assuming that you didn't."
But if that were true, they would be doing something more drastic, like overturning her hotel room or leaving a threatening message behind, not stealing a piece of parchment. So, either Lisa was lying, or she had actually misplaced the blueprint and was just being paranoid, or there was a missing piece to this puzzle that Harry had every intention of finding. Whatever the case, now that he was looking for some answers, Harry wasn't going to stop until he found them—whether Lisa was willing to talk or not.
"I never thought I'd come back here. Not like this, at least," Potter said finally. "It feels… weird, you know? Like I'm trespassing. Like I'm disrespecting the dead."
Harry didn't really understand the logic fully but nodded anyway. "Speaking of your patients, Mr—Draco," he said, the word feeling foreign on his tongue. "Did any of them know your son, personally or otherwise?"
"Alcohol before dinner?" he asked, although he pushed his mug forward and let her pour a generous amount into it.
Three months had passed since he had returned to the dreaded school, and Draco was unhappy, to say the least.
"After the war, it took us a while to regain stability and peace of mind. Even then, our respective careers had tumultuous starts. The Harpies weren't doing too well in official matches, practice sessions were hard, and Ginny came home injured every other day. The same went for me: my superiors and seniors didn't think I was all that despite having defeated a Dark Lord, and they made Neville, Ron and my lives miserable. Neville eventually left to take up the Herbology Professor position at Hogwarts, and that was the wakeup call Ron and I needed to fight back and create change."
I close my eyes and breathe deeply, revelling in the warmth of the setting sun caressing my face with its gentle, waning touch just as a soft breeze rustles through my hair, carrying with it the pungent scents and smells of the food and flowers around us. I sigh, allowing myself to drink in this moment of pure, unadulterated tranquility, and I'm suddenly grateful for everything that has happened so far, irrespective of the bumps and dips along the road. I find myself smiling, despite my previous moment of reflection.
"Won't cry," he said stubbornly, although he sniffed. James came up and clapped Albus on the shoulder, giving Ginny a weird half-smile, half-grimace.
Harry looked up to see Audrey make a beeline towards the table he was sitting at, and he rose to his feet just as she reached him.
All the kids groaned unanimously but said half-hearted goodnights anyway and trudged up the stairs without argument. Harry held Lily's hand as they followed behind James and Albus. It had been decided that the boys would sleep in Fred and George's old room and Lily would sleep with Fleur in Ginny's old room, when the kids had arrived two days ago, and Harry was to spend the night in Percy's old room.
She stayed for a while longer to ask about the specifics of the bouquet's arrangement and the flowers he would use, looked around the shop for said flowers—all the while keeping up a steady stream of high-spirited chatter—and finally left when he pointedly looked at his watch to remind her she had other chores to do.
Lily giggled, and James slung an arm over Danny's shoulders before saying, "Danny's uncle was inside too! Did you meet him?"
"Bollocks," Buxley muttered as he stared down at the sheet with a confused expression. "What's this? Nothing written on here is anything that we don't already know."
"K-Killed?" he whispered, placing a clammy hand on Harry's and clutching tight. "What… what are you saying?"
Harry jerked backwards and had to throw his arm out to steady himself as the kids exclaimed happily and threw themselves at Ginny.
"The auction's happening in their ballroom. It starts at nine, but I suppose we'll have to be there around four or earlier to get your vase sorted out. Is that alright?"
He tried to pretend like Albus wasn't jumping on top of him and screaming for all of twenty seconds before deciding that waking up was a better form of torture.
furious. It reminded Harry of when he used to be an Auror in training and Buxley was his direct superior.
Draco snapped his book shut with a nod and stood. They headed out of their shared living quarters, appearing from the outside as a small camping tent but magically enlarged on the inside to fit six single beds and lockers.
"You must be loaded to own a house in this part of town. A two-storeyed one, to boot!" Harry shuffles inside, his eyes wide and shining as he surveys the interior, looking the most sober then than he had all evening. "I mean, I live in a shoebox, compared to this place."
Buxley looked like he wanted to argue, but Harry didn't give him the chance. He strode over to his deputy. "Buxley, I refuse to let another innocent man be convicted for a crime he did not commit. And say what you will, but I
"Why in heavens were these buried in our garden?" she asked breathlessly, her hand hovering over the pictures as though she was too afraid to touch them.
Harry slowly rose from the ground and trudged to the bathroom. Tossing his soiled clothes into the hamper, he stood under the shower. The scalding water didn't comfort him in the slightest. He brushed his teeth, shaved, combed his hair, and stepped out.
Harry grinned, coming around the desk and clapping Neville on the shoulder. "So, how's Hannah doing?"
"Tough luck, mate." Harry clapped Neville on the back. He pulled his coat on, smoothed down his hair, and walked up to where his unit was waiting for him.
He wondered if he should pretend like it wasn't just to tease her but decided against it. Knowing Hermione, she'd probably make a new batch and force him to stay till they were done so he could taste-test them for her. "It's amazing! Who knew, huh?"
"He apologises for what he did and decided that, since the ones that needed to be behind bars—aka me—were never going to pay for their sins, he was done suffering for his father's crimes?" Draco looked up at Harry with stormy eyes. "This man abducted four innocent people and thinks
Harry snapped his head up to see a young witch, who looked to be no older than twenty, standing awkwardly at his door. He rose to his feet and motioned to the chair opposite him. She nodded, shut the door, and shuffled closer. She stood beside the chair and offered him a small smile.
He bit back a sigh and looked around the living room, clueless on what to do, when his eyes fell on Ginny's suitcases. A jolt ran through him, and he looked down at his daughter, watching as she fiddled with her doll.
One of them was undoubtedly Malfoy's, and the other one was a woman's voice he didn't quite recognise but found vaguely familiar. Not wanting to eavesdrop on another private conversation, he was about to shut the door, but the woman suddenly raised her voice, startling him.
he was so angry but he just was. Everything was just too much for him, and the fact that Ginny was right—that he couldn't even deal with simple things without her—just added to his frustrations even more. He didn't want to entertain the monsters in the back of his mind that poked and prodded at his conscience and whispered about what a bad father and husband he was, and everything was just
Buxley clicked his tongue but had the sensibility to looked chastised, and knowing the man had meant well, Harry motioned to the file his deputy was holding. "What've you got there?"
The volunteers rushed off in different directions to look for Scorpius, the mousy man himself wandering off, leaving Astoria and Draco to turn to each other. Despite her calm tone when she was relaying instructions, he could see the worry in her eyes. Scorpius was her pride and joy—the love of her life—and Draco knew better than anyone that she wouldn't survive it if anything were to happen to him. Astoria, who could stand strong through any adversity, could only be shaken up by her son.
"Are you here to take me away?" the child asked again, and Harry was taken aback by how clear and fearless his voice was.
Three shots rang out, followed by multiple shouts. An Auror beside Lestrange fell to his knees, and the Auror directly in front of him also crumpled to the ground—along with Lestrange.
"How much longer do I have to hold this up for?" he called when she left the room, muttering to herself.
"It's really not as big as it looks," I say, somewhat embarrassed at having my family's wealth thrown in my face—something I was used to flaunting, up until I moved to this humble little town.
Harry felt a lump form in his throat and he smiled gently. "It's alright. Think of this as an early Christmas present."
"Yes, again, for the same reasons as I just mentioned, we have to follow strict protocol through the course of the introduction. So that, if you were to decide to walk away, you can do so without any complications or consequences."
Mason took the scrunched up Muggle money from Buxley's hand and Disapparated. Harry rolled his eyes. "I'm your boss, you know. Not your son."
He had hated working part-time at the shop, mostly because of the "curse" he bore, where he could see various designs tattooed on people's skin. He had eventually figured out it was something that was reserved only for one's soulmate, yet there he was, trespassing on grounds he had no business being on, tarnishing something that was meant to be precious, and realising what it meant: that he would never be able to tell if ever there was someone meant only for him out there. He hated seeing tattoos appear or disappear on customer's skins, hated watching their loved ones caress it with tender affection, hated knowing he was the only one who could never share that secret bond.
At least, as peacefully as a depressed, mentally tortured, emotionally deprived, lifeless man who was shot to death, could.
"I'm so glad Rosie lost all her milk teeth. I never want to go through that again," she said in a low voice as James and Lily began to narrate the story of the tricycle breaking in loud voices.
He smiled as he kissed her softly, ignoring the retching and gagging sounds James and Albus were making.
"Good night," he replied, turning away from her and watching the sliver of moonlight that shone through a crack in the drapes until sleep overcame him. When he dreamed, he dreamed of another memory.
Harry stared at her as she took off the scarf and placed it in her bag. In all honesty, he was still stunned that the person who'd responded to his letter was this very attractive blonde instead of the rather lumpy, balding, ordinary looking wizard he had imagined her to be. She had signed the letter as
"That's still a week away from now," Harry replied, his voice strained. "Isn't the tournament ending this weekend? Why d'you have to stay until Wednesday?"
She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him, and when she pulled back, her eyes looked somewhat moist.
But now… although everyone was attempting to smile in the pictures, it physically pained him to see how hard they were trying to get over what had just happened. It had been painful, the war, more so for those who hadn't fought in it but had lost loved ones and the survivors because of how many casualties the wizarding world had sustained from it. It was painful.
Astoria had come up behind them just then, her eyes full of hope, and Draco steeled himself as he asked Harry, "How're we going to do that?"
and waiting for something to jump out at him. A shiver ran down his spine, and he felt like there was something in the shadows, but before he could check, a stair creaked. He snapped around, wand brandished, only to come face to face with a bewildered Fleur.
"I can't say for sure, Professor. We've been rather busy preparing for the exhibition, you see," the mousy man said, motioning to the stalls and volunteers.
"Yeah. Thanks. Anyway, there's a couple things I need to handle right away, so I'll see you around dinner time?"
After a long moment, she mumbled something into his chest, and Harry leant down but couldn't hear her. "What's that?" he asked, and she finally pulled back, wiping her cheeks. "Lily, baby, come on, don't cry. You know Daddy hates seeing his baby cry. Come on, tell me what's upset you so much. Daddy'll fix it."
Teddy stayed behind Andromeda’s leg, peeking around the folds of her skirt. He was six and still tended to be shy around strangers
Malfoy shook his head, “Well… how about, they tried to buy something with galleons instead of pounds.”
Smith grabbed a heavy wooden stamper, the rubber greying and faintly cracked with age, smacked it into a very sad looking ink pad and then thumped it onto the form. All formality seen to, the form folded itself up into a paper aeroplane and sailed off to the filing department.
Malfoy signed the bottom of the form and handed it back to Harry. He turned the key, and the engine roared to life. He gripped the steering wheel with both hands, looking through the windshield as he said, “I appreciate your cooperation, Auror Potter. I might even look forward to working with you again.”
Harry slowly weaved his way through the crowd. He stepped in front of Draco and casting his patronus as the boggart changed into a dementor and was quickly banished back into the chest where it was locked away with a silent flick.
Draco put down his pestle and titled his head towards the door, ears straining after the faint sound of footsteps, like someone was pacing.
Malfoy met him outside the house, and pulled him along, walking down the street and way from the twin houses of horror, “You did not just give the dog back, I take it? The man looked properly terrified by the end.”
All thought left Harry’s head as Draco kissed Harry. His lips were soft and warm, Draco smelled sweetly of bergamot and cedar, and Harry could feel his fingers curling into the fabric of his uniform. All sound seemed to fade into static, the world around him losing its focus-
But a further perusal of the cupboards found them mostly empty. Harry went to the table and began looking through the mess of papers, then began organising them. Newspapers in one pile, Business in another and letters from Narcissa, on periwinkle blue paper with curling perfect cursive script, in a different pile. Stacks of books took up one end.
against using a lumos to light his way. He just hoped his cloak would hide him well enough that he would have time to hide if he stumbled upon a paroling professor of prefect.
Harry blinked at him, all the concentration he had been desperately trying to gather was smacked away from him once more.
“I wasn’t going to…” Harry felt himself start to blush and took a step back, “I’m just going to go back to my desk.”
“-which was perfect, because then I could do whatever I liked and no one could accuse me of being too severe,” Draco scooted further back, idly swinging his legs, “I then said, ‘in
Harry tried the door, and it swung open easily. The office inside was about as small as Malfoy’s newer office. There was a bookshelf stuffed full of medical books, and some shelves, empty except for a few rolls of bandages. The biggest pieces of furniture in the room was a massive, mostly empty, locked cabinet holding a few shelves of potions and a narrow bed for people to rest on. For someone in green robes to sleep on now, apparently.
They stepped through the floo into Andromeda’s living room, carefully spelling the ash off themselves before daring to take a single step off the hearth.
the house elves strike. The very same wizengamot may very well remove me from my position as Headmistress if I show open support for them.”
Draco dug through his bag looking for his quill and found Pansy's list crumpled at the bottom. He impulsively picked one of the conversation suggestions, "Do you think it's going to snow soon?" he asked as neutrally as possible.
he could stand, Teddy leaned up, hugging Draco round the neck, his hair turning a fine flaxen white-blond, “Come
Malfoy blinked. “Not quite,” he said blandly, “I am not allowed to remove my wand or use it outside the wards of my home.”
Harry didn’t ask for the quill, he had concerns about what it had been through, instead pulling out the fancy fountain pen Hermione had given him when he had been promoted to regular Auror.
Malfoy said nothing, his expression solemn. He took out his wand and set their clothes right, smooth and wrinkle-free. Only the two of them would know what they had been doing in the close space.
Asbestos snapped her fingers, apparating away and returning about thirty seconds later with a sleek racing broom.
Malfoy tilted his head slightly, and there was something almost sinister about the look on his face, “If I suspected you might in danger of death or hurting yourself or someone else I would be obligated to make sure no harm came to you. Mr Dickson.”
like he’s not afraid of himself and what he could do, but what he’s done and how his younger self would react to what he’s become.
“It’s- Well…”Harry felt himself relenting and felt annoyed. “Fine. But I’ll be watching you. If you try anything I’ll-”
“We don’t want to fall down the stairs again do we?” Andromeda said, straightening the lapels of the small burgundy auror uniform jacket.
Last night…. Last night they had apparated into Malfoy’s house, dark and too shadowed to see much detail as they stumbled into his bedroom, their clothing discarded haphazardly along the way. And fell onto the massive king-sized bed, the soft bedding and piles of feather pillows sinking them toward one another and covering them in warmth, the scent of lavender and the faint lingering smell of Draco’s shampoo. In that moment, Harry had wanted to spend the rest of his life memorising Draco’s kiss.
Ron- Hermione definitely would have heard about Malfoy. There was no way Malfoy would be working at the Ministry, and Harry wouldn’t have learned about it.
Harry helped him get his arms through and pull it down. Draco’s fine hair stood up in a halo of static around his head and made Harry nearly laugh himself sick.
golly I love you guys and your comments and your wonderful, wonderfulness. I have comments from this story favorited in my email so I can re-read them because they're just the best. hugs and kisses
down at the ground, trying to call up the terrifying sensation of falling. But there was nothing there, not even a
“No,” Malfoy said flatly. He flipped open the notebook, “According to the briefing I received this was a single muggle exposure, correct?”
Harry took a deep breath, and they disappeared in a pop, reappearing on the cold, damp streets of Hogsmeade. The smell of frost was on the air. He shivered as Draco lead the way first down the well lit main road and down the more narrow lanes of homes, light receding behind them, “Where are we going?”
There was an empty bowl set out for Harry along with the three boxes of cereal. They were bright and colourful and looked like the sort of thing Dudley would have loved, and Harry would’ve never been allowed to have. He picked lucky charms because it had little marshmallows in it.
seemed a bit dazed by his response, “Uhh. Okay. I was actually- I was wondering, if I could see the plant, in real life. Sort of, visit, maybe?”
“It is,”  Malfoy’s smile grew, looking very much like a cat that has just pushed something off a table and was incredibly pleased with itself, “Good day, Mr Dickson.”
Remus slowly opened the door and eased it closed behind him, placing the keys in the cheap plastic bowl by the door. He hung up his coat on the rack, toeing off his shoes and tiptoeing into the room. He froze when he saw a figure sitting on the couch, backlit by the kitchen behind him.
Draco opened the cloak with his free hand, and Potter rushed to him, grabbed his wrist and pulling him to the wall, in the shadow of a suit of armour. He pinned the edges of the cloak between the wall and his back, hiding them both inside. The small box Draco in hands was the only thing separating them from one another.
Harry fought down a yawn. Next to him, the two newest junior aurors were holding onto either side of the suspect, both standing impossible straight and trying very hard to look like they’d done this before. Harry
- “Even I like to go out sometimes, Auror Potter. Have a bit of fun once and a while. Don’t be so prudish.”
Shunter smiled ruefully, “I’m not sure they would have let you. There’s a lot of pressure to have you succeed, Potter.”
“Harry and Draco?” Teddy with more interest, squinting as he walked closer, “You look kinda like them.”
,” George introduced himself with a chuckle and conspiratorial wink, “Go on ‘an have a laugh, I know I do. Hated the name as a tyke but it gives me quite a chuckle now. My Edith never found it all that funny, but now she’s not here to chide me about it.”
Pansy glared at him again then pushed past him, tucking her hair behind her ears before leaning into the memory.
“Good,” Shunter said, handing a copy of the ticket to him, “I hope to never see you again, Mr Hickenbotham.” She shoved her notebook into her pocket, “Now please return to your home-”
The portrait swung open revealing a round opening. Draco frowned, what was wrong with just having a door shaped hole- and the bottom of the hole was a foot off the ground. It was ridiculous. He had to wonder how many Gryffindor’s tripped and fell on their arse just trying to get in and out of their own dorm.
The crash of the chest bursting open made the small round room go silent. All eyes turned, everyone looked as the boggart emerged from the dusty trunk.
Draco ignored him in favour of putting both hands on either side of Harry’s head and ruffling his hair, “You’re such an adorable mess! Look at you!”
the end of class, and Harry had to carry him to the hospital wing. What if that was happening again?
its silence. He couldn't tell if she believed him for not and he was far too afraid of the answer to ask.
Harry sighed and tried again. It took three tries before the little spot of light vanished into nothing.
“I should warn you, you’re probably going to end up in the paper,” Harry said, bouncing his knee uneasily.
“Then, from now on, you should only let your dog out on a leash or on a tether. Or invest in a bit of fencing,” Harry said.
“We’re not waltzing,” Draco nodding towards the bonfire and the spinning jumping, pure delight of dance.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow, almost looking amused with him, “No. I do not, in fact, live in the middle of the street, Auror Potter.”
“Auror’s aren’t allowed to discuss ongoing investigations outside of the aurors they’re working with,” Shunter said.
Potter shifted his weight again, looking down at his scuffed trainers, “I know it’s not-” he shook his head, “I don’t know how you- or why you- put up with it. The things they yell when you come on the field, whether you win or lose. It’s awful.”
Shunter sniffed, “I’ve heard…let’s say rumours, that the intention of those… more qualified, are planning to promote you to Head Auror by the time you’re twenty-five or six. It would make you the youngest Head Auror in the history of the department.”
It felt like they were finding one another for the first time, holding each other like it was the last time, lingering like it was forever. Harry took his time learning every curve and jutting bone of Draco’s body. He could touch and kiss every inch of Draco’s skin, and coax new sounds of desire and wanting from both of them as they fumbled and tangled together. There was a feeling of giddy newness in this space of lost time where hours passed without their notice until they were sated.
when he heard Malfoy laughing behind him and felt himself relax. “It’s been pretty great, actually.”
The sheet, never quite tucked in, had been lost to the floor. Harry traced the line of Draco’s shoulder as he lay against Harry’s chest, the sweat slowly cooling on their skins. His fingers slid over the plane and down the ridge of Draco’s shoulder blade, his skin sweat soft under his touch. He could feel Draco’s heartbeat pressed close to his, gradually slowing as they finally caught their breath, and he hoped his heart kept time.
“All aurors should carry a pen or ever-inking quill on their person at all times for taking statements and notes,” Shunter said more like a reflex than with any actual thinking involved.
Harry took a deep breath, his heart beating a little too hard in his chest from the surge of adrenaline.
Draco's had the great misfortune to be paired off with Potter in a project and working with the git in the library is an absolute torture.
“What kind is it?” Harry asked, feeling silly and yet still wanting to keep Malfoy from leaving as long as possible, so he understood, that was it. He just had so many questions.
“I’m ever so glad you could find it in your heart to allow me Sunday off,” Harry said sarcastically.
Draco eyes went wide and the room was silent, afraid it would be Voldemort, Nagini or Crazy Bellatrix. Who else would Malfoy be afraid of? They held their breath, afraid to move, or speak as the boggart changed and became a boy. A boy with blond white hair that stood up in the back from a prominent cowlick, wearing shorts with grass stained knees and grey eyes that almost seemed too big for his face.
Harry watched Malfoy look around again, and realised that he was probably looking for the owner, Mr Dickson.
Draco rolled his eyes mockingly back, “My parents had banquets and balls for Halloween, which I wasn’t allowed to attend when I was young, and they were so interminably boring I wished I wasn’t when I was.”
Draco stiffly drifted down into the chair. He clutched his knees with both hands, “If you weren’t part of the bet what were you doing?”
is what my taxes pay for? Harassing innocent wizards? I’m going to tell the Wizengamont about this! You’ll see-!”
Harry plucked the cigarette from Draco’s fingers and breathed in the last bit of smoke before it burned down to the filter.
Draco slowly uncrossed his arms and leaned forward off the goal post, “I needed to understand your intentions.”
Malfoy shrugged, “You seemed like such a stiff when we first met again. All rules and protocols and ugly uniforms.”
After that was, of course, dessert. Which is how Harry found himself standing in the middle of a gelato shop that was so fancy and minimalistic it could be mistaken for being an empty room someone had managed to drag a counter and freezer into. The menu board, a large blackboard covered in white rounded writing, only made the shop look marginally more occupied.
More people were starting to gather and a few ran to their rooms or sent patronus' to tell their friends. Draco went pale for a second and swallowed hard then lifted his chin and went on like this was exactly what he was expecting. He opened box after box and slowly the table in front of him began to fill with chocolate frog cards and every single one of them was Harry Potter.
“Why not?” Malfoy said. He turned away from Harry, looking up the street, “My life is a joke. People have been laughing at it for years, being good didn’t stop them, being angry only made it worse. I might as well have a laugh myself. It really is quite funny when I look at it from an outside perspective.”
“I’d wonder how Smith keeps his job, but he does a stellar job holding that desk down,” Shunter said.
Harry was pretty sure no one should have ever listened to Malfoy, but that hadn’t stopped the Prophet from reporting the things Malfoy had told them in the past. Even now, they could call him an anonymous source, the paper was brimming with anonymous sources full of shite and photos taken entirely out of context.
Harry glanced over with a smile, “Which is to say, taking care of people is sort of how I show I care.”
The door swung open, and a man in a white suit stepped out, straightening his jacket and impeccable tie. He was tall and lean and had a dark blue shirt and black tie under the pure white of the suit jacket. He pulled off a pair of sunglasses, slipping them into his pocket, as the sun glinted off his white-blond head and he gave Harry a perfectly calculated smirk.
“-I was talking about this,” Malfoy stopped abruptly and grabbed Harry’s hand. He held it up, pulling Harry’s fingers open and exposing the teeth marks on his palm right between this thumb and forefinger. It would have been mostly superficial if it had been a quick bite, but with all of Princess’ weight hanging from her tiny sharp teeth, she had ended up breaking the skin.
Harry had to laugh at that, “True. I probably would have stayed, but Ron and Hermione sat me down and forced me to talk it through. And I realised that I was sort of only doing it because I felt like I had to.”
“I’m surprised you have a suspect,” Malfoy said, “it seems to me you would just sell the coins and move on.”
“Potter...” Draco said reproachfully. But when Harry only held him tighter, he raised a careful hand and brushed it through Harry’s hair, damp curls clinging to his fingers.
“A concussion?” Harry said, drinking the potion quickly and shivering as the pain in his head faded.
He patted his pockets and pulled out the folded stack of forms he always kept on him, “I think I have that one…”
Additional tags: Eighth year, friends to lovers, fluff, flirting by being idiots, a bit of peripheral Romione
blinked, “Tulip... oh, like a house elf? That would explain the finger in half the pictures. I thought they were a bit odd looking.”
“We’ve received multiple complaints about a dog loose in the neighbourhood as well as direct complaints from your neighbours about your dog being allowed to roam freely outside the home without a leash or supervision,” Harry said channelling his official auror voice.
Once Shunter had apparated back to the ministry, Harry checked the wards along the perimeter before pulling a wad of blank mission report forms out of his pocket. He found the right one and shoved the rest back, holding the paper up against the window as he pulled the lid off his fountain pen with his teeth and quickly began filling it out.
“Excellent,” Malfoy said, looking chipper again, “Go stand by the door and try to look intimidating, would you?”
Harry didn’t rise to the bait, finishing writing down the names she had given him, “Your cooperation is appreciated. I’d avoid making any other betting pools in the future if I were you.”
stepping outside. His breath came out in great white clouds as he went down a few steps, his feet sinking into the whisper of snow as he looked up at the sky
Malfoy or, maybe, yeah, Draco really was better, stopped abruptly. He took a breath, composing himself before looking back, “Yes?”
Harry wants to take his relationship with Draco to the next level, like the actually having one level.
he was young, it was so easy to think his father was great. He had his moments; he was a good husband and a good father- most of the time, but not a great man.
Draco grinned, scooting to the edge of his chair and held the box out and opened it with a theatrical flourish. The chocolate frog jumped out and Blaise snatched it out of the air, popping it into his mouth with satisfaction. Draco plucked the card from the bottom of the box with two fingers and held it up with a smug grin. It was a Harry Potter card.
only by a fitted sheet worn thin from repeated cleaning spells. Draco wasn't sure where his pillow had got to. He must have left it at Elle's.
Draco frowned suspiciously, tearing open the top and pulling out five copies of the Quibbler, with a photo of himself on the
Seamus stepping up behind his shoulder, “I want the frog,” he said as he lobbed another box along with Dean's.
Harry blinked, eyes focusing on the stick, following it up to where Draco was holding the other end. He spared Harry a glance before looking around the room to make sure no one else was trying to ambush him.
Draco could feel the thrumming heat filling his hands, his hands changing into talons, tearing through the fifth-years robe like tissue paper. The fifth-year’s free hand clawed
Sorry this update took so long, I needed a bit of a break. Thank you so much for waiting and for reading. I hope you like it♡
Harry licked his lips, “My dad was brilliant at quidditch and transfiguration. He was smart, the worst kind of smart that always got him in trouble, Sirius was the same way. They were like Fred and George, tricksters, always causing trouble.  Sirius was… he acted tough and had a temper and sometimes…he could be cruel without realising it, or maybe he did, but he always tried to do right by his friends.”
“What in the world is going on in a field at ten at night?” Harry asked, trying and failing to squash his annoyance.
lately-" Potters voice rose with every word, "-the being friendly and saying nice things and even though I
“If a dog isn't in an enclosed yard they must be on a leash or on an appropriate tether,” Harry said.
Harry had to force himself to hold his tongue. He knew he couldn’t push too much, not with how careful Draco was. He had never wanted anything more in his life than this, just being beside him.
This chapter deals with some of Harry's abusive childhood and might be upsetting for some. Please read with care♡
“Well you’ve managed so far,” Remus said. He yawned and headed back to the kitchen, “Try not to wake me up when you get back.”
Harry sighed, looking at his hand, “You’re right, I guess. But my healing charms leave scars half the time anyway.”
That was the most Malfoy thing he had said all afternoon, and it very, very slightly righted the world in Harry’s mind.
Harry threw his leg over the broom and pushed his toe on the ground, instantly sending the broom flying up into the tree. He pulled it to a stop, overcorrected, re-corrected, a tree branch slapped over his face and then finally managed to get it to hover. It figured Malfoy would have one of those overly sensitive, annoying ‘high performance’ brooms.
Thank you so much for your patience. I don't know why this chapter was so bloody hard to write. Some of them are just like that, I suppose.
Hogwarts castle has merged Harry and Draco's room and won't let them out. It seems to be waiting for something, but what?
“I don’t believe that’s how champagne works,” Draco said. He held out his hand, and Harry passed him the bottle without question.
“Just return the dog,” Malfoy repeated slowly. “Our poor muggle is going to wake up on his settee, having had a terrible nightmare about his dog running away. It was strange but dreams rarely make sense.”
The Mediwitch’s office was located on level one with the Minister of Magic’s Office and all the various staff and researchers that worked for him. It took a few minutes of searching to find the right office, an unassuming door off to the side only marked by a plaque that read Heath and Healing. It looked like there had been a few names underneath the plaque, but now there was only one.
Harry looked around the rowdy crowd of students moving down Hogsmeade's main street until he spotted Ron's shock of red hair floating above it all and waved him over.
may be a good fit.” She squeezed her hands around his outstretched hand, “I must get back to work. Take care, Draco
Teddy ran up to the first house, decorated with jack-o-lanterns and fake spiderwebs dotted with large plastic spiders, turning around in front of the stairs, “Okay, so first you knock and then when they open the door you say ‘trick or treat!’ and take a candy, only one unless they say you can have more and then say thank you!” he sucked in a deep breath and said quietly, “the thank you is very important because if you don’t say it Gran gets mad.”
Granger rolled her eyes, handing Weasley the stack of books, "Your mum is great, Ron. Return these for me, would you?"
“And quite frankly I am surprised she hasn’t been stolen. She’s wandering free, a cute little dog with no owner around.”
Draco nodded, pulling open a small chest in the centre of the room and charming the contents to  float around them like they might hang on a wall for display.
Harry watched the bloke fumble through the stack of trays on his desk. Eventually, he found the right form and set it in front of himself. Overhead a faulty lumos spell occasionally flickered, shifting the shadows on the stone walls that, unlike the rest of the Ministry had no windows, false or otherwise.
Harry cleared his throat, feeling far too hot in his own skin, “You, uh, you have some ice-cream,” he gestured to his own mouth.
Back at the Ministry, Harry had to ask the front desk where to go. He had always been either injured enough to have to go to Mungo’s or just slap a plaster on and call it good.
“It’s- Princess just goes out for a tinkle. She comes right back in. She’s a good girl,” George said.
"I still do, a bit," Draco shrugged helplessly, "After the war... I couldn't hate him anymore but I couldn't stop thinking about him either. And then we came back to school and I saw him everywhere... and he seemed so lost..."
Asbestos bit a chunk off her ice cream and then held it out. Harry took it without thinking, which seemed to be the right response because she grabbed Harry and Malfoy at the knees, a handful of fabric in both hands and apparated them away.
“I, well, y-yes,” George said shakily, drawing himself up, “I- I can’t imagine us losing our Princess. Oh, it would break Edith’s heart. I wouldn’t risk it.”
Huddles. They watched him with suspicion. Lulu gave his sleeve on more tug before running back to join the other house elves.
Harry didn’t move. He wasn’t ready to go back out there, out to the bright lights and even brighter saccharine smiles. Here, in these stolen moments with Draco, Harry felt like he could breathe. He wasn’t ready to let go.
Harry stopped and considered his options. He could reverse the transfiguration here, but the dog might fall out of the tree. Or he could put the animal in a body bind but again, risked it falling out of the tree. The smart thing would be to levitated it down to the ground and let the others reverse the transfiguration, but he was rather shit at controlled levitation when it came to light things. Heavy things he was brilliant at, he could levitate a person no problem, but something as little as the cat-dog-squirrel might end up on a rather erratic rollercoaster ride at best.
Harry's hoody has gone missing again, there's only one person who could have taken it, Draco Malfoy.
“Teddy, these two young men are your godfather Harry and cousin Draco. They’ve taken a potion to make themselves younger for just a little while, and they would like to go trick or treating with you tonight,” Andromeda said, stepping away from the stairs and giving Teddy nowhere to hide.
Harry headed to the front step of the house. Malfoy joined the aurors on the edge of the road, and a moment later, all the wards and magic in the area was dispelled, the aurors apparating away a second later leaving only Malfoy standing on the pavement.
invisibility cloak. He knelt down, pulling the silvery cloth off of a rectangle of plaster, which showed a line of animal prints...a dog? No. Draco stretched out his hand over the clearest paw print, finger to palm, they were the same size. Not a dog.
Draco dropped the robe onto the hook, “It’s plenty.” He grabbed the towel from Harry’s waist and hung that up as well, “I need my towel.”
“No. Return to the office, and make sure you drop off your reports to Auror Shunter before the end of the day, or you’ll never hear the end of it.”
Draco let out a huge breath in relief, “Perfect. We have a half an hour to pick out our costumes before we’re due to floo over to Andromeda’s house.”
his fingers closed around cold glass. He took the other pepper-up potion and dropped back onto his pillow with a shudder.
This is why I never promised weekly chapters I suppose. it's nearly two chapters in one so no loss but time really. I just needed to the two parts connected. The first part took me a more than a week and a half to write, all told, I'm still not sure it's as good as it could be.  also hope part two was alright, it's been years- more than I'm willing to admit- since I've written smut of any kind.
Someone swept by leaving the scent bergamot and cedar in their wake that immediately made Harry look up. Draco headed to the head desk, a stack of papers in one hand and a long stick in the other.
Harry turned back to Malfoy, who was rubbing his nose with a sulky expression. He sighed and said, “Sorry. About your face.”
against her chin theatrically, “What would you say to the boy you were if he was right in front of you?”
Princess responded with an almost explosive amount of excited tail wagging and further slobbery kisses.
Draco grabbed his arm and Harry tried to pull away, the two of them tangling and pulling and giggling as they tumbled onto the floor in a heap.
“I bought it as soon as the trials were over,” Draco said, speaking into his bowl and oh so carefully not looking at Harry, “I couldn’t step foot back in the Manor.”
The kettle whistled shrilly, and Harry went back to it, filling two mugs with hot water and the only tea he could find. After a few minutes, Harry fished out the tea bags and added sugar to his cup. He put the other under stasis for Draco to fix as he preferred.
Draco looked up at the array and finally picked a knight costume made of fake pleathery leather and silvery chain mail cloth, “I want to be a knight, like Sir Galahad or Sir Percival.” He transfigured the thin cloth doublet to a dark green emblazoned with King Arthur’s crest, three gold crowns on an azure shield.
Draco slipped off the end of his bed and pulled open one of the four empty wardrobes he had stored his small personal pensive in, a silvery memory already pooled in the bottom, "Take a look for yourself."
stopped his horrid tickling. They stayed locked together, trying to catch their breath, both waiting for the other to speak first.
Mediwitch Bedlum cocked her head, a growing smile on her face, “A healing charm would do well enough on such an injury.”
Harry shivered and his arms relaxed as tears began shining in his eyes, “And Lupin, he was more book smart and quiet but… good. He was good to the core and never wanted to burden anyone especially the ones he cared about. They were all as close as brothers. Mum… Mum was smart and had to work twice as hard because she was muggleborn. There was so much hatred for muggleborns before the first war, but she was still kind. She never let anyone push her around, though, she gave as good as she got. She only fell for my dad when he learned how to be a good person first and-”
Someone found it. Someone put it in the eighth year common room. Someone probably thought it would be funny. Especially, when someone opened the chest. They never found out who that someone was because it wasn’t funny. It wasn’t funny at all.
Malfoy huffed in amusement, “We’re all children Auror Potter. We just pretend to be adults. The longer we do it, the better we get at it, but it doesn’t change the fact that we’re all whiny sticky little monsters underneath it all.”
Malfoy snorted derisively which made the dog tilt its head in confusion, “He wouldn’t lay a hand on me if that’s what you mean. He’s always preferred a cutting word to the lash, but words don’t work as well anymore so he’ll look for anything he can use to leverage power over me. It’s all about power...”
Potter turned and leaned forward, going into a steep dive. Draco held his breath as Potter got closer and closer to the ground. He had seen Potter do the wronski feint before, he had followed him in the dive during games, but it seemed more certain and far less terrifying than it did now as a spectator. A second before he would have been paste on the ground, Potter pulled out into a beautiful corkscrew that skimmed along the base of the stands.
Harry hurried over to Thomas, throwing him over his shoulder, and retracing his steps back to the road hoping- He heard the paws crunching through snow, the snapping of branches and that horrible whining howl coming closer-
Draco’s face was relaxed in a way Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever seen. Every memory he carried of Draco in his mind, he held tension between his brows and in the uncertain persistent frown on the edge of his mouth. Even when they were young.
“It saved me some trouble in the long run since the Manor was seized a few months later,” Draco said.
“Can anyone corroborate your claim?” Harry asked, grabbing his notebook and writing Windershin’s name down.
Sirius leaned closer to Remus, “We had spaghetti for dinner, I left a plate under stasis on the counter.”
Harry stayed close, their noses touching, watching Draco’s eyes, and the contrast of his slightly darker lashes against his pale skin.
Pansy wrinkled her nose, “But you always hated how he rushed in, getting involved in things that didn’t involve him to
let go of Harry’s robe, “Better to have an impossible dream than to ever think I was good enough to be with you only to-”
Draco nodded laying back on half the pillow, using his wand to turn off all the lamps except the one above his bed, dimming it to a glow. He was glad Harry had never asked him to turn all the lights out, he didn't do well in the dark.
“I smell like an ashtray,” Draco said sourly, “God it’s the worst smell in the world. I’ll have to stay in the guest room.”
The organiser summoned an unopened champagne bottle from the back and pushed it into Harry’s arms with a well-meaning pat on the back. Harry managed a tight smile and excused himself, stepping outside into the cool night air.
“That’s alright then,” he said roughly and cleared his throat. He held out his hand, “…Yeh finished yer tea?”
“If you’ll assist me rather than interrogate me, I can show you,” Malfoy said. He pushed himself away from the car with an unfair amount of grace.
Draco watched the small figure high in the air execute a slow loop, using a sloth grip to stay on as if it were the easiest thing in the world and not something it had taken Draco months to master. He pressed his back into the goal ring post, crossing his arms over his chest and grabbing hold of his forearms so he wouldn’t fidget.
“I prefer to think things aren’t quite so bleak,” Shunter said with a sour smile. “Now shall we actually get some work done?”
“Quite a shock when you suddenly quit the auror’s,” Draco interrupted, plainly done talking about his family, “I think everyone was surprised, they all thought you’d stay in the job until you made head auror and died.”
“It’s important-” Andromeda’s voice said right behind them, “-because you’re thankful for being given free candy and want to express your gratitude like a good member of our society.”
Junior aurors were often passed around to whichever auror needed the most assistance, and Harry had ended up working under her quite a bit. He had been impatient with her at first, but he had come to admire her work. Shunter wasn’t flashy or impulsive. She always went into a situation with a cool head, and because of that, she resolved things with less destruction and less death and injury on both sides. Rumour was she never fudged evidence or lied either unlike one or two other senior aurors.
Harry grimaced as he touched down, holding his arm out with a dog-cat hanging from it. Its expression was remarkably placid, as if it had found peace in the certainty that it had seen enemy, bit the enemy and defeated it, a rare novelty in its often frenetic confusing life.
Draco hoped he could convince whoever it was he was sick and let him go to the hospital wing unimpeded.
Harry watched Draco sip from the bottle, eyes closed and contemplative as more ash slowly drifted down from his cigarette.
Draco braced his hands on the edge of the counter, sliding himself back onto it, biting his lip with a shy smile.
Draco flicked the end of the cigarette, dislodging a clump of ash that bounced off his immaculate black boots before drifting down to the stone pavers, “I don’t. I hate the taste and the smell.”
Malfoy sighed, “You don’t understand. If my father thought he could hurt me by hurting my dog, he would.”
“Too bad your beau didn’t see you jump, I imagine he would have enjoyed it,” Bedlum said, grabbing Harry’s forgotten hand and pulling it up, “Hold still.”
Draco finally looked back. He seemed nervous, almost shy. Harry took a deep breath, the cool night air sticking in his lungs.
Draco looked around the room and grinned in satisfaction as Longbottom almost tripped on the portrait entrance as he came in.
The clerk nodded and shot to the back of the shop, returning a few moments later with a grumpy witch in her twenties with short brown hair and an exceptional number of piercings in her ears.
brushing the far corner of the table. He jerked away from the feeling, it was strangely disturbing to touch something with his fingertips that was halfway across the room.
Draco gave a pie to Harry nudging him until he took it they both ate one pie and one cake, leaving the rest on the table.
Harry turned back to the costumes and randomly picked out a rather tacky zombie costume and raised his eyebrow.
Harry hesitated, opening his mouth to say something and failing. He chewed on his poor bottom lip and tried again, “I- I want
Croft : believed to be derived from under croft, a croft is where the majority of house elves live. Crofts are typically located underground with no physical exits. They take advantage of wizarding family and general anti-apparition wards so as to only accessible via house elf apparition.
Malfoy swiped his tongue up the side of his gelato, pink and purple melting over his tongue into a pastel cream. He tsked and frowned at his black cone, “This isn’t gelato. This is just ice cream. Gelato is much richer and denser than this.”
Harry nodded and went to touch the brim of his police hat before remembering it wasn’t there. “Good. Well… I hope to never have to see you again, Mr Hickenbottom.”
Harry frowned a bit and finally asked, “How is your mother? I haven’t heard anything about her since the trials.”
“Of course, it makes far more sense than his neighbour actually being a wizard and turning his dog into a squirrel, doesn’t it?” Malfoy grinned, “That sounds like utter nonsense to me.”
The fire threw up a gout of sparks into the dark sky, and a few of the younger people began dancing, swirling around the bonfire in groups, pairs and alone, clapping and shouting with the music.
Draco ate the rest of the knickerbocker while watching the rest of the table slowly descend into drunkenness. It involved a lot of rude songs, shouted
“Neighbourhood dispute,” Harry said, “Usually two neighbours that have snapped and ended up fighting, except one of them has magic, so that’s where we come in.”
Shunter frowned, “I know you’ve been frustrated with the work you’ve done as an Auror, but everyone has to go through it. Juniors work with Seniors to learn the basics. Aurors work basic cases and walk patrols in Diagon and Hogsmeade, and Senior Auror’s work the big cases. You have to learn every aspect of the job.”
Draco rocked backward, all the air pulled from his lungs in one fell swoop as that small, innocent face looked up at him and began to flush with tears.
Harry’s automatic retort didn’t come out like he expected, seeing as it didn’t come out at all. Malfoy putting on his glasses, something about it had made him feel profoundly uncertain.
Draco quickly shook his head, “If the first disastrous eight years we knew one another couldn’t manage it, do you really think you could get rid of me now?”
“Are you sure?” Malfoy asked again, and somehow the repeated question had gone from annoying to having the hint of threat.
!” thick ropes binding around the wolf's body but not stopping its momentum as the thing slammed into him with all its weight, throwing Harry back against a tree with a vicious thud, everything going black.
Hullo♡ I've been going through this story from the beginning to edit it a bit and realised I accidentally left out a part from the original story. So if you want, chapter 9 has a new part, the very first section.
They went from door to door, bags filling and the two hours passing so fast that all three of them groaned when Andromeda told them it was time to go back.
They all turned and grinned for the camera, Teddy in the middle and Harry and Draco on the other side.
Draco shrugged one shoulder, “They had to do something. They let my parents off without even a slap on the wrist last time, but just throwing my father in Azkaban wasn’t enough.”
Additional tags: auror!Harry, potions consultant!Draco, mud, swearing and bitching, so, so much bitching.
When he finally left the Ministry it was dark, he headed for the Leaky, getting a pint and sitting at one of the small round tables in the back of the bar.
“I didn’t say she was strange, just that she would prefer it,” Malfoy said, turning away from the glass for a second to look at him, “You have to admit that she’s a bit odd though.”
Harry like washing dishes by hand. It felt good, getting everything clean one by one. His mind went quiet with the simple repetitive task, thinking only of what he was doing. He used a spell to dry them, mostly because he couldn’t find another dish towel. But he would have preferred to hand dry them as well.
“What?” Harry frowned. Malfoy tapped the front of the display where the flavours were labelled, including a banana pudding flavour. He ignored the glare of the posh-looking young man behind the case, “It seems more her character to prefer something strange.”
Draco clumsily tangled their fingers together, squeezing Harry’s hand. He leaned forward and brushed his lips over Harry’s, slowly deepening the kiss.
The first couple times he thought it was a coincidence. The next couple times he thought it was just weird. After it happened ten more times it was annoying. So he bought an entire box, a wrapped straight from the factory box, and
. Harry and Draco high-fiving each other after making a dad joke while their kids collectively groan.
Malfoy blinked and only managed to half reopen them, sleep starting to relax his face, “only been two and…before I wasn’t eating enough… And wasn’t sleeping well and it was… harder.” he let his eyes close, “feel stronger this time…”
It was nearly dark when Draco finally returned, coming through the front door and closing it slowly, the click muffled by his sigh. Harry had only turned on the kitchen lights and he heard Draco’s footsteps drawn toward him, stopping just inside the room.
There was a smudge of ice cream on Malfoy’s lip, and Harry found himself raising his hand to wipe it off before the confused, half-smile on Malfoy’s face made him stop.
“Malfoy, what are you doing here?” Potter asked when he was only a few meters away, swinging off his broom and slinging it over his shoulder as he walked over.
Draco pulled back, still close enough Harry could feel the heat of his breath, “The soup is boiling over.”
“And you’ve never held Crookshanks before.” Harry looked up. This close he could see flecks of blue in the centre of Malfoy’s iris’. His eyes followed down Malfoy’s narrow nose to his lips. And Malfoy smiled that little half-confused smile that made Harry’s heart race and made him very much want to kiss him.
The silence of the moment shattered and everyone found their breath again. The common room quickly emptied as the students there found other things to do, anything to take them away from that moment.
“You weren’t part of the betting?” Draco asked faintly, the tops of his cheeks flushing a pretty pink.
Malfoy waved him off, tapping a finger against his lips in thought as he turned on his heel looking for more clues.
“Pansy’s family always had crups, and Theo’s mum had half a dozen little dogs at any time.” Malfoy said absently, “I wanted one, but Father wouldn’t allow it. He hated mess.”
working on a transfiguration paper and found it welcomed as Potter eased his own weight back against him. After that, each touch Draco made was a
took the box apart, apparently not interested in plates. In Draco's opinion, food tended to taste better when it was eaten unconventionally and he heartily approved.
“Well, I don’t know any doctors very well, but my parents have always had cats. And since the illness infected something like a horse and a sort-of-wolf as well as people, it’s easier. I mean, provided the illness is one of the few that effects muggles as well as wizards.” Hermione said. "Either way it will let us check off some possible illnesses."
“Malfoy doesn’t hit anyone with it, just keep them at a distance. He’s done a good job too, it’s been a week now,” Ron said.
Harry fought down as sigh as he filled out the incident report for what started as a squabble about snow globes and ended with four damaged storefronts, two destroyed carts, fifteen minor injuries, three significant injuries and one old woman transfigured into a chicken. Last Harry knew she was still in the spell damage ward trying to peck people to death.
Harry looked down at the dog who looked at him with beatific ignorance and licked Harry’s chin. He supposed Malfoy was right. It was the easiest solution. But, if the neighbour was always letting their dog run loose, something like this was bound to happen again. “Alright,” he said reluctantly.
Draco squeezed Harry’s hand tight, “So they would build a bonfire to burn the night through and keep away evil spirits and the fair folk.”
hair was a dirty blond that caught the lamplight strangely so it looked slightly brighter, slightly golden. Harry was trying very
“Uh, err…” Harry thought furiously, “Oh! Paperwork! I need um, the obliviators would fill out form AD 45-O. The case can’t be closed out without it.”
Harry smiled and held up the full bottle of champagne from the organiser. He charmed the cork out from the bottle, sitting beside Draco, drinking from the bottle and coughing at the burn of bubbles and alcohol.
Draco's breath caught in his throat and he forgot he was hiding, leaning past the edge of the shelf to try and see how Potter would react.
As it grew late, people began to drift home until only a few remained. Harry walked through the fallen decorations scattered across the floor, streamers charmed into vines and flower petals, illusions of lightning bugs still spiralled in the air overhead.
“No, he allowed me to, the little monster. I don’t know what I do wrong that he hates me giving him a bath half the time. He used to love it back when- back with Prongs-” Sirius flinched, squeezing his eyes shut.
“Potter is... He’s not nearly as full of himself as I always thought and probably a bit cleverer. He can be quite brave even if it's rather stupid most of the time
“I can only smoke when I’m inebriated. If I didn’t hate everything about it I would probably be a smoker,” Draco said. He hesitated and then held it out to Harry.
Malfoy sighed and rolled his eyes, “You’re likeable. People like you, they trust you. It’s infuriating, but at least it’s useful for this sort of thing. ...And your outfit is more approachable.”
“It’s my first…” Malfoy looked uncertain for the first time since he had arrived, “case? Is that what you’d call it, a case?”
Harry felt his skin crawl just remembering it, “I remember how Remus looked when he changed and… that thing in the forest looked wrong. It didn’t look fully wolf or human, like it was starting to turn back and just stopped.”

Draco leaned close, wiggling his hand into the crook of Harry’s elbow, “Tell me about them, your family, not what happened to them, tell me who they were.”
He glanced outside at the darkening sky and was reminded he hadn’t eaten anything since this morning. Knowing that the fridge downstairs only had juice and leftover takeaway, Harry grabbed his wand and apparated to Diagon to do some shopping.
“You can't tell me if we didn't come with you whenever something went wrong over the years, you wouldn't have just tried to do
“I won’t. I’ve held Hermione’s cat before,” Harry said, staring down. The dog was looking between them in confusion, but all Harry could see was where he and Malfoy were touching and the warmth of him against his skin.
Blaise flipped open his bag and Pansy groaned, “Oh, don't! He's just mumping for free chocolate or attention,” she frowned slightly, “or both, more likely.”
Harry cut him off, “And someone speeding down the street might hit her in the road, might be cruel enough to hit her on purpose.”
“I think, I prefer the memories I have of it when I was young to seeing it now,” Draco shivered and squeezed his eyes shut for a moment, “It affects me quite badly.”
Harry blinked in surprise, but Draco just smirked and gave Harry another cheeky look over before closing the shower and turning the water on.
Longbottom blinked hard a few times when he saw Draco like he was imagining him, before walking over, “Malfoy?”
“If it was me and the lads down at the pub and it was over at the end of the night, then it would be all in good fun,” Harry snapped, his hand curling into a fist, “This is the entire department being arseholes.”
He swore loudly and flicked his wand, casting an Imperturbable Charm on the door. "Try and be a little louder, why don't you," he said as he flopped down in his chair.
An awkward tangle of limbs is followed by a flurry of sweet-smelling somethings raining down on us, and as I regain my balance, I find myself looking into startling green eyes as my own aghast expression is reflected in the man's square spectacles.
"Alright, alright. Let Daddy come in, first." He put Lily down and ruffled Albus's hair. "Where's Jamie?" he asked, looking around when he didn't spot the older boy.
Draco looked up from the book he was reading as Hermione stormed into the room, slammed the door shut, shrugged off her coat, kicked off her boots, and collapsed on her bed.
"Morning," Harry greeted his mother-in-law as she made her way to the kitchen. "Is it too late for breakfast?"
Quelling the wave of nausea that swept over him, he turned right and hastened down the hallway, wondering why the hell there weren't any doors in sight. Agitated by this sudden bout of weakness, he leant against the wall for a moment and tried to get his breathing under control. He unfocused his gaze as he concentrated on breathing in through his nose and breathing out through his mouth, and just as he was able to breathe easier, the opposite wall slid open quietly. Before he could react, someone rushed out and down the way he had come. He stared at the wall as it slid back into place, heart hammering away in his chest.
Harry reckoned he was Ryan, and with a clap on the fellow's shoulder, he wished him good luck and walked down the corridor. He knew Buxley would be seething and sulking for as long as he was hospitalised, but he knew better than anyone that the man understood the position he was in.
"The Drarry couple's finally here!" Ginny said as they walked into the small flat, throwing her arms around Harry and kissing him on the cheek. She was wearing a weird, colourful hat that had
"Alright, where's it broken?" Harry asked, putting Lily down and squatting beside what looked like a rather large, lopsided yellow tricycle. He frowned. "Jamie, where did you get this?"
He tossed the file on the desk and stood staring at it. After a moment, he picked up his Self-Inking Quill and circled Hertzfeld's name multiple times. Placing his palms on either side of the file, he leaned all his weight on his hands as he racked his brains, trying to find the missing piece of the puzzle.
He spun on his heel and stalked away, leaving Granger looking from one to the other with a torn look. Harry sighed and waved his hand for her to go after Weasley, and Granger gave him a quick hug before running after her boyfriend.
, the volume of her shrill wails rivalling that of James' angry shouts. Rising from his desk, he trudged downstairs, rubbing his eyes.
Harry sighed as went through Buxley's notes for the dozenth time. The frustration of not having found any new leads coupled with the fact that he was unable to piece what information they did have together was making him agitated. There was a knock, and he looked up to find his deputy standing in the doorway, holding up a file.
She hugged him one last time before walking away, looking over her shoulder and waving when she reached the corner. He waved back before stuffing his hands in his pockets, watching the place where she'd disappeared for a long moment before getting into the car.
Astoria nodded, her smile patient. "Yes, of course; I understand. Thank you for your hard work." She looked around as the man gushed and said, "Is it possible to ask the volunteers if they happened to see him?"
Draco let out a shaky laugh. "You saved me from a mad evil wizard and from rotting away in Azkaban for the rest of my life. Of course I trust you."
She didn't answer for a long moment and finally raised her head and kissed his cheek. "Everything's fine."
The door was shut quietly and whoever it was made their way to his desk without announcing themselves. Finally deciding to acknowledge the person, he looked up, and had to bite his tongue to keep himself from exclaiming in surprise.
"We're unsure, but the parents claim that the boy went through the Floo before Mr Malfoy did but never arrived at the destination."
He struggled to push himself to his feet, every inch of his body screaming in pain, but he persevered nevertheless, hobbling out of the parking lot. Sighing, he heard someone from team one of the backup unit say that the perps were heading in the direction of team two.
Harry smiled, nodding with reassurance at the man, but, somehow, Draco's trust felt more like an added weight than relief.
"Right, sorry." He cleared his throat as he shut the car's door. "You OK? Or do you want me to go with you till the train?"
His mind blank, he focused all his senses on the circular movements of Malfoy's fingertips, the feel of the cool silk against his skin, and the mild scent of the blond's cologne mixed in with the soothing air-freshener in the room. After what seemed like an inordinately long time, the pressure disappeared, leaving Harry feeling a sense of loss as Malfoy moved away, the silk robes brushing against Harry's fingertips one last time as he flexed his fingers.
"This isn't going to work," Draco insisted even as a loud clatter echoed through the room. "We may end up in limbo once again, and without one of us in reality, we may be trapped there forever."
As it turned out, the fist fight had been more of a prediction on Granger's part than anything—much to Draco's relief—because they arrived to stop Weasley just before he flung himself at Harry.
"Don't use the bags, lean over the rail. You know the drill." Harry sat down on a crate and began checking off names on the list included in the file Hermione had given him.
Harry picked up his own cup and sipped, feeling a sense of calm settle over him as the warmth of the tea passed through him. "That happens, when you someone for the first time after over a decade," he replied, more to himself than to Malfoy.
He looked up from the file cabinet and instantly broke into a grin, moving around his desk as Kingsley walked into the office.
"Yes, definitely," Arthur said with a sad shake of his heads. "Those were such terrible times, Harry, the wars, and nobody came out unscathed, whichever side they were on."
Harry shrugged and Summoned his self-inking quill. "I'll send a letter to Buxley and tell him I'll be late. It's going to be more paperwork for me, anyway."
Harry stared after the blond, nonplussed, until he disappeared around the corner. The owner had stepped out just then, screaming about dirty thieves and boys who weren't punished properly.
“Should do, should do,” Bedlum said, pressing her wand against the cabinet lock and unlocking it with a faint click. Even though the shelves were mostly empty, she took her time checking every single bottle and jar.
minutes late so you can stay ten minutes long to make it up. We can talk more about elves at another time.”
Draco braced his arm on Robards’ desk, leaning over, his perfectly tailored trousers hugging his perfectly-
up the book and smoothing out an old piece of parchment, the copy of the house elf treaty of eleven hundred and four, “You
"Miss Audrey has been informed of your arrival," the young witch said with a little bow, motioning to the door. "This way, please."
"Nothing. I've got Buxley looking into it to find out how true her little story about the stolen vase is, but beyond that, I've got nothing that could indicate that the vase even belonged to the Blacks, let alone that it was taken from Grimmauld Place and is a memento from the war."
"Good afternoon, my love," her cheery voice said in his ear, and he couldn't help but smile, glad she was in a good mood.
Harry waved off her apology, but she continued without waiting for him to speak. "I presumed you overheard my argument with Draco yesterday, and so I decided that it would be best for me to clear the air in order to make it easier for you to reach the decision of whether or not you would like to continue with me as your Healer."
"You do?" Malfoy asked, looking stupefied. Harry didn't blame him. Anybody would have expected him to reject the very idea of spilling all of his deepest, darkest secrets to someone who had been his nemesis for the longest time.
"Oh, nothing, I saw your messages so I thought I'd call you. What's with all the noise?" he said loudly, shooting an apologetic look towards the owner of the shop, who was standing by the door, watching the rain, as she glared at him.
"Morning, Dyers," Harry greeted the man as he took his coat off and made his way around the desk. "What brings you to my office today?"
Harry sat back in his seat and inhaled deeply before answering. "Well, although the Harpies lost before the semis, they're still going to stay back for the after-party and leave on Saturday morning as planned. Ginny's supposed to leave at the same time, but she's not returning home with them. She's got some more work to take care of, apparently, but I'm planning to catch her right after the finals tomorrow afternoon and spend the evening with her before she leaves."
He had been under the impression that Ginny's weird behaviour had more to do with the fact that he had been tense and moody of late, or the stress from her work, and after their previous conversation, Angelina's birthday, for some odd reason, but the way she was acting was far too suspicious. Grinding his teeth, he turned back to his unfinished paperwork, pushing Ginny and their troubled relationship aside for the morning.
In that moment, Draco groaned, his knees buckling under him as he lost consciousness, and Harry lunged to the side, catching him just before he hit the ground.
She paused, her cyan eyes having taken on a deep, brooding look, the smile no longer gracing her painted lips. Heart hammering in his chest, Harry waited with bated breath, anticipating what she was going to say next.
Harry had half a mind to simply Disapparate back home and go to work and pretend none of this had ever happened, but something in the back of his mind was telling him Malfoy might be able to help. Or, rather, that he needed help and Malfoy was offering it to give it to him, so why would he refuse? Besides, if there was anyone in the world who could understand the trauma he was going through, it had to be Malfoy, being the only other person the same age as Harry to have been directly affected by Voldemort and his madness. Maybe he had suffered through nightmares, too, like Harry had after the war. And although Malfoy had made his life miserable throughout his years at Hogwarts, Harry was quite sure he'd done the same for the man. If the blond wizard was actually the one to have founded Antares for the sole purpose of helping people like Harry, then what harm could there be in taking the opportunity presented before him?
He cleared his throat and pushed his headache out of his mind for now. From the looks of it, he had bigger things to worry about. The way Angelina was acting was suspicious… or, rather, it was as though she was suspicious of something.
Until, one fine day, the worries I thought would last only for a few bus stops had suddenly appeared in front of me, within the four walls of my very own shop, cornering me into paying him my full attention.
"What—did you do to me?" he gasped, the aches and pains of his wounds, the bright colours of the flowers, and the shrill birdsong suddenly overwhelming.
"After a point, I think it was when Ginny was pregnant, they stopped altogether. I used to stay awake some nights, just waiting for them to come, but they never did, and I would just lay there staring at the ceiling and feeling restless."
"Vase, please," the goblin said as they entered the vault. Harry dutifully handed over the vase and watched as the goblin went over to the farthest wall and placed it on the stone ledge, beside the other artefacts Harry had collected over the years. The goblin then touched the ledge, and the stone above and below the vase warped itself to encase the vase. He tapped the stone cube twice, and it cracked and crumbled away to reveal a transparent glass-like encasement beneath.
They'd reached the other end of the corridor, which led to a room that was mostly empty, except for a backboard on the wall opposite the door with three rows of benches in front of it; it had the feel of a common room. Audrey walked over to the wall on the left and knocked on it, causing a small, child-sized bed to spring out and stretch itself out.
Draco expected her to shut down his claim instantly, but instead she crossed her arms and asked, "Why would he do that? I can't imagine why he would want to sneak past me without being seen."
"That… makes a lot of sense," Harry said thoughtfully. "Then all the times I've drunk it, it may have never actually worked but I just
"Lils," Harry said softly, pulling her away and wiping her cheeks. "Here." Rummaging in his coat, he pulled out a toffee he'd picked up from the restaurant they'd eaten lunch at.
Someone cleared their throat, and Draco opened his eyes to see Harry awkwardly standing a little away. Pulling away from Astoria, Draco wiped his tears and, with a few comforting words, sat her down on a nearby armchair before walking over to Harry.
Malfoy looked up from reading what the quill had written and gave Harry an endearing sort of look. "It will take a little more time and a few more details from your end to figure that out. But, it seems as though the return of your nightmares may not be as sudden as you thought them to be."
"Oh, just shut up and kiss me," Draco snapped, grabbing Harry by the back of his neck and crushing their mouths together.
"This is why Mum said she couldn't live with you anymore," Scorpius said under his breath. When Draco paused mid-stride to turn to the boy with a set jaw, a raised brow, and pursed lips, Scorpius shook his head, eyes wide, aware of his error in judgement. "I didn't mean that; I'm sorry. I just meant I'm more like Mum when it comes to planning and stuff; I just can't help myself!"
Harry grabbed her arm and gave her a pointed look. "I hope you remember that I told you this in confidence."
Leaning over his desk, Harry clicked on the button connected to Buxley's buzzer multiple times, his mind racing at the same speed as his heart. His deputy threw open the door thirty seconds later, wand at the ready as he looked around the room. Finding only Harry standing in the middle of the office with a wide grin on his face, Buxley made a confused gesture and put away his wand.
asked her to explain herself, so she couldn't call him out for being unreasonable. Finally, she said, "There's a whole bunch of post-match interviews I need to do, plus the after parties—and the girls want to celebrate their win. Besides Ang—"
Draco laughed despite himself, shaking his head and swiping a tear from his eye. "Merlin's beard, Harry was right."
Buxley is incapacitated, so someone needs to take charge of the vandals case; Harry receives a call from Ron saying Harry's kids are at his place and they seem homesick; Harry drops by Silver Sprigs Pre-school to have a chat with Audrey; and Ginny and him can't seem to have a conversation without it turning into a row.
“Wild dog attacks local children?” he read, motioning to the paper. “What does that have to do with me?”
He inhaled deeply, expanding like an unwound spring ready to snap. Before he could speak, however, his mother added, "Your school robes and trunk are by the door. I'm sure you're capable of getting yourself to the station? Have a house-elf accompany you to carry your luggage."
Harry watched as they walked to the far side of the room. Malfoy's back was towards him, but from his rigid posture and his tense shoulders, Harry could tell that he was agitated. Camilla, on the other hand, seemed to be enthusiastically trying to get the blond to see the appeal in her suggestion.
"That's more convenient for you because it's right in the middle of Diagon. Ron can check in on them anytime he wants. It's not as close for Ginny and me.* I've already told you this."
What alarmed Harry the most, however, was the final line that contained Draco's name in it. It was about how Harry had testified on the Malfoys' behalf in their trial, helping them avoid being sentenced to Azkaban, and this was highlighted multiple times, so vigorously that the page had ripped.
"Bye, Danny!" the trio chorused. As they made their way out of Gringotts, Harry glanced back at the boy, a persistent nagging in the back of his mind telling him that he was overlooking something important.
Harry groaned, and she shushed him as she continued with her ministrations. After about ten minutes, she went away, and when he thought she wouldn't return, she bustled back in.
And just like that, he was gone, leaving me standing in the middle of the entryway, feeling like an uninvited guest in my own home.

He grinned at that and watched as his sons finished their plates, raced to the sink, climbed up on to the stools placed in front of the counter, and rinsed their plates clean.
"All of you have been given a standard set of instructions that need to be followed throughout the course of this operation," Harry began, crossing his hands behind his back and striding down the length of the boat. "These instructions are to be followed to the last letter, and I don't want to see even a hair out of place. Am I clear?"
He hadn't meant to come off sounding like he was accusing her of something, but he had, and there was a pregnant pause from the other end of the phone.
Camilla had a sort of smug smile on her face, as though she was secretly proud that he had asked, and said, "Well, to be honest, nobody's ever asked me that. So I'm not entirely sure if I'm breaching protocol by telling you this, but I guess it doesn't matter either way—the parchment you're asked to sign on is enchanted so that it remembers your magical signature. Once each step has been completed, the form changes to that of the next step, hence recording what can be considered a "magical imprint" of sorts at every turn. This is a fool-proof method that hasn't failed us yet, if I say so myself."
Draco watched the goings on from his armchair in the corner of the room. The protective shield Potter—
"No, I was just thinking—it only seems like yesterday that the lot of us were running around Hogwarts, and now, look at us… sitting and complaining about what toys
Harry blinked rapidly, stepping back from Malfoy and nearly running into the shop door. “Nothing’s wrong with the hat,” he snapped, ignoring the fact that he hated the hat himself. He wiped his cheek on his shoulder, feeling unexpectedly warm.
Draco frowned whether he thought Harry was wasteful or simply stupid, Harry didn’t know. “It’s too sweet,” he laughed. “Do you want it?”
Draco nodded, “Getting to dress up, loads of free chocolate, and no responsibilities whatsoever? Absolutely.”
Potter had his book open and was reading the instructions as closely as Draco had ever seen from him. Then again, Potter's brewing proficiency in sixth year had apparently been a fluke and he needed all the help he could get.
