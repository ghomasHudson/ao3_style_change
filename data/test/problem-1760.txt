He summoned a quill to write his response.

You win.
Epilogue: Years Later
"Funny you bring up that particular memory," Draco murmured with a small, cautious softening of his frown. He placed a hand over the one settled on his chest and squeezed. "Well, I was going to Curse you with something pretty nasty myself. I'll admit you had to defend yourself, though really--you can't bother to do a little research on a spell before using it? Very Potter-like, but I do hope you learned a thing or two about being less idiotic with unknown spells."
Malfoy's expression said clearly there would be no hollering of any kind from his quarter.
Once settled in his chair and with fork in hand did he consider Harry's question.
Thus persuaded, Harry exhaled audibly as he screwed up his courage and levered himself up from the couch. Merlin save him from half-cocked notions of penance and Slytherins with no compunction about abuse of power. Malfoy, to his credit, allowed but the briefest victory grin before arranging his face into a coolly detached expression.
He hooked his ankles behind Draco's back to pull him in closer, moaning at the sensation of Draco's hard cock dragging against his own.
It was also the reason Draco had eliminated Amortentia from his Newt-level curriculum. (What he'd told Minerva was that the potion was too dangerous in the hands of hormone-addled adolescents, which was factually accurate.)
Draco seethed. "There is no way in hell I am letting you touch my hair after last time, you harpy. Now shut up and listen! You owe me for making me read that four page letter about Donald last week."

Malfoy held Harry's stare for the span of several heartbeats (more beats than usual in the present circumstances).
I dare you to write something embarrassing somewhere on your body. You may decide what and where. You won't have to show me--I trust your sense of honour to compel your follow through.
"Glad you approve," Harry replied with a chuckle as he slowly pulled back out (rubbing against his best approximation of Draco's prostate). He wanted to push Draco into begging for more. He continued with the teasingly, torturously slow thrust and drag of his cock, his hands gripping Draco tightly.
*****
"I have a dinner to finish," he said simply. With that, he took Draco by the arm and apparated them home.
Anyway, so right after the war I went to the nearest pub I could find to get absolutely shitfaced--disguised, of course. Everyone was celebrating, but I was mourning. I didn't have much time for it before then, you realise. A German man approached me who looked scarily like a young Sirius and I decided to go home with him. Never saw him again. He had no clue who I really was, but I knew then why it always made me uncomfortable when a bird looked at me with lust in her eyes and why I was always breathless when Sirius looked at me with so much love--platonic, mind--or happiness.)
Draco widened his stance and stretched his spine into an even more pronounced arch to spread his arsecheeks since Potter's hands were otherwise occupied. The Gryffindor used that opportunity to increase the tempo and depth of his tongue-fucking and Draco became nearly incoherent with lust.
I have changed in a great many ways--and generally for the better, I believe--but I am still a Slytherin at heart. You can't give me ammunition like that and expect me not to use it. I will make no promises about my outfit. I am most assuredly planning to cheat.
******
If you're planning on letting Knott have his way with you, you're going to need more than just some wine (which I assume you're drinking, being a right ponce.) Try straight whiskey or bourbon. Though, who knew a Malfoy's standards could drop so low?
Harry grabbed Draco's wrist to stop him just as Miss Perfect Timing appeared to ask if they wanted dessert menus. Harry put in their order and turned to scold the irrepressible tease as soon as their server left.
When Malfoy arrived for his appointment--at 3:00
At this point, my grades can't get any worse, and it's possible might even improve.

Draco turned to look at his lover with a smirk, which disappeared into a concerned frown a second later. Despite the Gryffindor's bravado, it was obvious he was exhausted. The blonde crawled over his partner's lap until he firmly straddled him--their cocks rubbing together with casual friction.
Draco chose not to mention the fact that the tub could be charmed to be larger (or that he meant he had wanted to use Harry as a pillow for his back) and instead chose to enjoy the excellent rub his head was receiving. He grinned and closed his eyes as Harry worked.
Harry was conflicted. Excruciatingly so. (Or, wait, maybe that was his hard on.)
The elf gave a brief nod as if this was the first sensible thing Harry had said all night. His many wrinkles multiplied around a deep frown when Harry continued, however--
"Would you take a breath before you get hysterical?" Draco snapped, irritated. "I'm calling because I need advice, not a tirade!"
"Let's play it by ear," Harry replied pragmatically, electing not to comment on the fact Draco was holding his hand so tightly he could feel his bones grinding against each other.
Potter's sweet smile was more dangerous than an Imperio. Draco wiped it off his face by grabbing two handfuls of his firm arse and writhing beneath him.
Harry thought about continuing as though he hadn't heard the git--he was obviously being sarcastic, anyway. (Malfoy must be as bored as him and had probably decided that a bit of Gryffindor baiting sounded more fun than standing around drinking or tampering with the refreshments.)
Realizing that two seconds too many had ticked by without a response from his quarter and Malfoy’s expression had turned from pleasantly open to curious and guarded, Harry hastily cleared his throat.
, at least, was innocent in all this.
I am writing to you on behalf of my best friend and formerly betrothed, Draco Malfoy, who seems to be content pining away for you from a respectable distance without making his feelings known...like a pathetic, spineless twat. (He knows where I stand on the matter.)
After, they enjoyed dessert, or everyone but Weasley did. Though he said he was full that was just another excuse Draco was certain was a lie. Considering their history, Weasley probably suspected poison.
Draco draped his legs around Harry's thighs and wrapped his arms around the Auror's neck, hugging him tight and suckling on his lips for a long second.
They needed to get out, and fast. But first:
," he was forced to complain as breathing became impossible (partly due to the sudden increase in his blood pressure). A telltale jutting became more and more obvious beneath the thin fabric of the skirt with each bit of flesh Draco revealed.
******
"I need the loo," he announced to his friends, hopeful Draco would hear him and take the bait.
Draco took a serving that was more crust this time, but didn't immediately stuff it away. Instead, he left it hovering as he considered Harry's words.
Dear Harry Potter,
Janine scoffed. "Tell me something I don't know."
And for your information, I happen to think your hair would look better down than gelled back, that's all.)
"Potter," he began in a desperate voice. "Harry... Stop. We can't. Not yet."
"For that admission, I'm just about willing to give you anything you want."
With a crushing sense of dread, Draco placed his forepaws on the black lacquered frame and pulled himself up for a look.
It was fortunate he kept detailed notes of all of his experiments: any halfway decent potions student should be able to create an antidote with a bit of time and study of his process.

"Oh nothing," Hermione answered sarcastically from her end of the lopsided triangle they now formed. "Just Harry falsely accusing and offending one of his patients. A highly vulnerable one, I might add." Though she was speaking to Ron, she speared Harry with a punishing glare for that last bit.
He was here to make amends. He had known going in that that would involve his suffering and embarrassment and he’d deemed it a fair price to pay for what he had put Malfoy through with his false accusations and inexcusable behaviour. If this was the worst of Malfoy’s schemes to level the playing field, it wasn’t so bad. His years in quidditch meant he was no stranger to a locker room; this wasn’t all that different, really. And there was a certain poetic justice to it: Harry had wounded Malfoy by throwing his most shameful failings in his face, and now he was be asked to bare his own shame in response. It was fitting in a way.
******
Thanks for the magazines, but considering where I am and the condition I am in, they are virtually useless. Teasing, even. But that was your real intention, wasn't it?
Given that Draco was the last thing on his mind before falling asleep, probably not.
Draco ran his hands through his hair to straighten his locks from his face as he reemerged and leaned back against the tub. He couldn't remember the last time he felt so relaxed (his last massage was when he had still been going to Hogwarts) and somehow he knew quite well how rare an occurrence such a thing would be from Harry. He smirked and turned his head to kiss Harry's hand as it roamed the pressure points of his shoulder.
Draco licked his lips, which tingled pleasantly from what he assumed to be spearmint toothpaste. He certainly was telling the truth about having just brushed before Draco came over. He shook his head to regain his composure and huffed at the other Auror indignantly.
*****
******
Well, he certainly acted bashful like Potter did when there was a chance the man was mistaken. But what if he was on polyjuice? It was strictly forbidden to use another employee's hair (or any hairs outside of under cover jobs) especially for this sort of circumstance, but that didn't mean he wasn't a very determined snoop.
"When did you start wearing it so long, by the way?" he inquired, pouring the finished batter into buttered ramekins (and sneaking a taste from the bowl).
He pressed their foreheads together and licked the Auror's nose.
She can have free reign in the Manor's libraries...
Gripping the far side of the writing desk for leverage, he arched his back, pressing his chest and forearms into its smooth surface and his arse more firmly against Potter's mouth. His prick hung unattended between his legs and the desk; he wondered how well Potter could multitask and if he would take the initiative on his own.
There were perks to dating an insatiable sex fiend.

"It does smell good," Hermione responded kindly--if somewhat stiltedly--and Harry expanded his smile to include her.
“You don’t keep it on you?” he asked incredulously.
If Draco kept that up, Harry wouldn't be able to defy his order if he tried. Sweet Merlin, he hoped he wouldn't stop. Harry'd had his fair share of blowjobs and, in his opinion, there was almost no such thing as a bad one (provided the person doing it followed basic etiquette and safety protocol). But Draco's enthusiasm, his wholehearted commitment to the task and seemingly genuine enjoyment of doing it, combined with the sensations radiating from deep inside, put this blowjob in a class all its own.
"Let's lower the chair. It folds out," Draco purred, already pushing Harry up, though it meant losing the wonderful friction.
Harry barked a laugh and kissed his godson square on the forehead, making Teddy grimace exaggeratedly, then giggle like a maniac at his own joke. If only it could be so easy with the rest...
“Did you know you were capable of blushing on the back of your neck?” Malfoy asked conversationally, deceptively innocent.
He briefly considered Malfoy's offer of visiting that evening but he was already home for the day. They would have to wait until tomorrow morning...or afternoon given the man's demanding sleep schedule.
Harry could very nearly die a happy man.
Potter looked closely at him, seeking clues to the source of his distress since none were forthcoming. From that distance Draco could see the flecks of jade and topaz in his striking emerald eyes. Precious and powerful stones, the lot of them. Everyone always said they were his mother's eyes but that wasn't a muggle colour--they sparkled and shone with pure magic. They may as well be Merlin's eyes, filled with concern for Draco's wellbeing.

He kicked Malfoy's stance wider with the edge of his shoe and pulled him forward--nearly causing him to stumble--until their chests were flush. He then placed a possessive hand on either side of Malfoy's narrow hips and leaned to whisper in his ear, "Is this
He turned his right hand palm up on the table, extending physical comfort to Draco if he wanted it. "I don't yet know if I'd enjoy you feeding me or me going down on you or, Godrick, any number of things we might do together. Right now I'm still getting used to the idea of a lot of them. Others I already know have the potential to become my favourite." He deliberately leered for a second to let Draco know just what he meant before returning to earnestness.

Harry wanted to yell.
Draco was still as a statue, not even breathing as far as Harry could tell. "'m really sorry about that," he added earnestly. "Never rightly said so before."
"Some apology. Bang me against your desk, of course."
"Come on then," Potter offered, picking him up to cradle in the crook of his arm. Draco allowed it. He was feeling generous. "Are you

Harry was overcome with sympathy but he kept a lid on it, knowing intuitively it would put Malfoy's hackles up.
Draco bypassed the spatula and leaned in to whisper in Harry's ear with one hand on the Auror's hip.
Some of Malfoy's tension loosened at that and he looked as though he considered returning Harry's smile before he thought better of it.
, and your last missive isn't cutting it (though it does have a certain appeal). This whole ridiculous affair has cost me a great deal of pride. How are you going to make it up to me?
Harry let Draco kiss him soundly, but only for a couple of seconds. They had an audience and he really wasn't one for PDA (though snogging Draco was always nice).
Everything went dark.
"You're going to chaffe, you idiot," Draco chided, taking a second to toss the lube over to Harry, who was witlessly abusing his tender shaft.
He set down his spoon with composure that impressed even him and picked up his glass for a long drink of water. His heart had lodged itself somewhere around his Adam's apple and made swallowing difficult. It thudded like a jungle drum.
Draco and Potter leapt apart as if stung (and Draco immediately kicked himself for the blatantly obvious admission of guilt). Granger cocked an amused brow at the both of them and strode into the room.
there was something he might interpret incorrectly? What did that mean for the other things, then? There could be no telling until he saw the memory.
Regarding the claiming of superiority: I can and I will.
Twat.
One hand cradled the back of Draco's skull, threading through his fine, silky hair, and the other went to his own aching cock to gather what lube he could. Thrusting his tongue against Draco's and tracing the ridges of the roof of his mouth, relishing in the warm, honeyed taste of him (and the remnants of his afternoon tea), he reached behind Draco and nudged his hand out of the way.

He strode over to Draco and stood before him, unable to sit just yet with his nervous system still primed to fight.

him. The idea of dinner with his closest friends alone was a bit nerve wracking, especially considering their pasts, but the fact that Harry wanted Draco in his inner-circle meant quite a lot.
"Yes and no. I did cook it all, but I had to use recipes. Nothing here is technically all my doing."
"This way you can relax and I can watch for the girl. Just make sure you don't make too much noise."
Harry's hackles went up. He hadn't done anything wrong...except possibly not telling them about Draco yet. But
Draco turned back from the sink once he knew the burn in his cheeks was well controlled. He grinned sheepishly at the skillet, even offering a shrug. "Whoops! Knew I forgot something." (There was no real apology in his voice.)
Draco nodded as Harry pushed him away, smirking at the ink stain that had transferred to Harry's cheek. He decided it would be best if Harry found out on his own that his face was now a mess, so instead of informing him Draco merely shrugged.
Yes, quite. But Draco wasn't eager to drink out of a dish--there was no way to do so with decorum. With a sinking feeling, he realized dinner was going to pose the same problem, only magnified.
With those tasks complete, he turned his attention to the large stack of files that had appeared on his desk sometime after he left yesterday.
He rolled off Draco and scooted to the edge of the table. (Someone whined when the contact was broken, but he honestly wasn't sure who.) His prick lay heavy and full against his lower abdomen. He took it in hand and leered at Draco, giving it a long, languid stroke.
Thank you for your constant support, patience, and all the kind commentary. I did not mean to leave you guys hanging for the last chapter for so long, but I am in college and between Mid-Terms, Finals, theater productions (my minor, formerly my Main), a wedding, and a multitude of health issues (stomach viruses suck) I have been prevented. Don't get me started on the things holding up Playout! I'm not complaining, mind--life is good for both of us. I just mean it's hard to slow down while you're enjoying the roller coaster.
"Mhm."

“Yeah! Of course not. No problem!” he promised hastily.
Godrick, he was approaching his third orgasm of the night and he was already thinking about the next. It was madness. It wasn't even about the climax, just having (wanting,
It was moments like that Harry wished he was better with words. Draco deserved sonnets, love songs. Harry'd tried once, in a letter. It was rubbish. So he made do with his hands, worshiping Draco's body--and the man it contained--inside and out. He nudged Draco's prostate insistently with his finger and pulled his weeping prick with his other hand, watching everything with firey lust and awe (and softer, fonder feelings). Draco was in a hurry, practically begging him to fold him in two and fuck him into the cushion.
It seemed that their interactions would forever balance on a set of scales, with irritation on one side and endearment on the other.
He dropped the basket on Harry's desk and fell heavily into his own chair.
Unable to resist the temptation any longer, he began to stroke himself in time with Draco's thrusts, imagining the slick, tight heat of his channel on his prick. It was somewhat difficult for him to wrap his mind around, but Draco seemed to be having a jolly good time without so much as touching his own weeping member--he bit his bottom lip on a whine and his eyelids fluttered closed until he forced them open again to return his stunning gaze to Harry.
!--and you land yourself in
Draco's pulse skittered a moment before he wrapped himself in calm. He took a nearly-silent, steadying breath as Mipsy opened the door for their guest. He couldn't help but chuckle at Potter's bedraggled appearance as the man cautiously made his way into the foyer and appraised his surroundings with a practiced sweep (like the good little Auror he was). It took him nearly four seconds to locate Draco on the landing--during which time Draco held his well-practiced pose with exquisite precision. When he did, Potter's luminous eyes lit up behind their frames and he flashed a brilliant, somewhat cocky smile.
Malfoy studied the wall.
Not that he didn't find the erotic parts stimulating. Or even that he'd never fooled around with a bloke before. But stuff that happened when one was three sheets to the wind didn't count, right? That's what he kept telling himself anyway.

Harry wasn’t sure what he had been expecting from the washroom, but it certainly wasn’t the opulent white-and-gold monstrosity to which he’d been led. The interior decorator was almost certainly the same as for the Rose Room—Narcissa? he wondered—and neither space had the oppressively dark and dreary motif that seemed to make up the rest of the Manor. Gilded sconces glowed brightly above white-painted wainscoting. A huge slab of creamy white marble punctuated with four separate sink basins made up the vanity. Two crushed velvet settees in dark gold were arranged artfully around a rich mahogany side table (for all the Malfoys’ loo-based get togethers, apparently). The room had a ruddy

The blonde leaned back into his seat with his glass firmly in hand and his legs crossed. He chuckled as he sipped a bit more wine, determined to be less of a slosh (high tolerance or no, vast amounts of alcohol consumption witnessed by a potential life-mate was
Harry chuckled. "That can be arranged," he replied, shifting the heavy bag of takeaway he carried to his other hand (the plastic of the handles had started biting uncomfortably into his palm). "Now hurry up and let me in, I'm starving."
Malfoy apparently took his silence for encouragement. Harry noted absently that his posh accent went harder on the consonants when his dander was up. "My sudden departure from the public eye has been a favoured topic of conversation among the town gossips, the current leading theory being that I've developed a rather nasty drug habit." Here he paused, perhaps waiting to see if Harry would accuse him of the same. (Harry was angry, but he wasn't suicidal; he said nothing.) Malfoy went on, "Features about spoilt playboy millionaires with too much time on their hands and questionable morals sell papers. You are rather well acquainted with this notion, are you not?" he quipped.
Little by little, Malfoy's strength was returning, and with it a...not quite
He would have to think on that later. For now he scowled and said through his teeth, "What is it that you want, Malfoy?"
No, he must have been mistaken.
"To your knowledge, do any of them have connections to the field of muggle medicine?" he pressed.
He brushed his lips in a feather-light kiss to the back of Draco's neck making him gasp and flinch. Smirking, Harry filed that information away for later and returned to the task at hand.
Draco pulled Harry's head into the crook of his neck and hugged him tightly. He nuzzled his temple and sighed contentedly to himself.
Surprising everyone, Harry included, it was Draco who spoke first, facing down a literal den of lions. "I can assure you all this isn't how we intended to inform you of our relationship," he answered calmly, matching Arthur's tone. Harry nodded emphatically.
oo00oo00oo
*****
Frankly, he got a little overwhelmed.
He was just about to say as much when a familiar patronus glided in through the wall. The otter splashed about his head in phantom waves and Hermione's worried voice came through, "Harry, I don't know where you are, but we've just learned someone spiked the punch. It's a lust potion. If you're with someone else please, for the love of Merlin, keep your pants on and report to the first aid station so we can get you the antidote."
"Suck me while you do it," he prompted.
His thoughts had taken on a somewhat breathy quality as his heart skittered excitedly.
Harry grinned against Draco's arse. He prided himself on his cunilingus; he was glad to learn that eating arse wasn't so different from fanny. Draco's heels dug into his back but he didn't mind--the noises he was making more than made up for the discomfort.
Harry bucked up hard, unseating Draco and flipping him onto his back.
Harry nodded. "Yeah. I imagine it would."

Unless perhaps he was a snake, he thought hopefully. His body did feel long and sinuous. Maybe he was a lovely emerald tree boa or a fearsome black mamba.
As for Pansy, wow. Though I thought you were gay? That's a rough go, either way.
Frowning, Harry adjusted the strap of his satchel so it rested more comfortably on his shoulder and considered just what it was about Malfoy that got under his skin. A dog barked madly somewhere in the distance but he took no notice of it. His thoughts were elsewhere.
Whether it was a slip or not, it left him feeling inordinately gratified. He trilled about it (quite without his permission) and then attended to a suddenly very interesting invisible speck on his left foreleg to avoid doing something more embarrassing.
The shopgirl was smirking slightly when he went to pay but there was nothing mean in the expression. She handed Draco the cone and waved Harry's sickles away. "I don't know what you are to each other," she explained, "and it's not my business to ask, but whatever it is, it makes me happy. This one's on the house."

Lucius didn't move to comply, only arched a brow and frowned minutely up at him. Harry fought to maintain the tenuous hold he had on the reins of his fury.

"An hour," he replied with a sympathetic smile.

Harry grinned, lips stretched around Draco's prick, and drew off with a hard suck. He gave the head a final lick with the tip of his tongue and resumed his ascent up Draco's body.
?“ he drawled.
"I don't know about you," he said after a minute, "but I'm starving. Literally, I think. You can stay in here as long as you like but I'm going to get out to start working on dinner."
He reached out and curled his fingers tightly around the shaft--comparable in girth to his own but looking thicker on Draco's slim frame--and tugged, stretching the velvety skin up and down an inch or so rather than sliding over the top of it.
"Remember earlier when you asked how you were going to give me inappropriate public hard ons?" Harry said archly when Draco resettled in his chair. "You're doing just fine, even with your limitations."
*****
You learn something new every day.
He shuddered when Draco pulled out--far too soon for his tastes--but smiled at the sweet, soft kiss he was treated to afterwards. He wouldn't have pegged the Slytherin for being such a softie. Wrapping still-shaky legs around Draco's waist (ignoring the twinge of pain in his hips at the gesture) and holding his face in both hands, he thrust his tongue inside Draco's mouth to kiss him hungrily.
Bumping his glasses up and palming the back of his stiff neck, Harry surveyed the options before him. At this point, sleep seemed to be the best course of action. Fortunately, years with Hermione had taught him to plan (and pack) for every possible scenario.
He knew what Harry had meant before, but he also knew the well-intentioned Gryffindor had no idea what he was doing. But now that Draco so incredibly sensitized, he had an impossibly small likelihood of failure.
I sincerely hope that you will read this letter and not reject it outright like the three my secretary has attempted sending you. I promise you that neither she nor I (nor my organization as a whole) harbors you any ill will. I have but a simple request:
Any chance you could sneak in a treacle tart, as well?
"I'm better at baking than any strenuous cooking I dare say, but I wouldn't mind. One never knows when the urge for a good steak might creep up, after all."
"No thanks to you," Draco drawled, closing the distance between them and resisting the urge to preen under Potter's halfhearted compliment.

Harry held tightly and moved into the house. He wasn't going to attempt stairs with his burden, so he made a beeline for the formal dining room, which Draco had yet to see. (Harry didn't use it except for the rare occasion he hosted a family get together; still, it was a fair sight nicer than it had been in the days of the Order.)
That wasn't something he had said out loud before. He peered sideways at his boyfriend and caught the glimmer of a small, pleased smile before the Malfoy mask fell back into place.
Without knocking, the blonde waved the doors open with his wand and walked inside the little office shared between Harry and Weasley.
"Street food? As in food we find on the street? I thought your cupboards were full. If you were having that bad a time with money, I could have bought--"
of all people. "I've been in practice for five years, with three years of training before that and my own personal experience with occupational therapy besides. I am fully certified to practice."
He took his pacing to the other side of the room in a fruitless attempt to avoid her censure.
Harry was being pulled in equally strong, polar opposite directions. He was simultaneously furious with Ron for his inability to keep his fat mouth shut about things that didn't bear discussing at the dinner table and incredibly proud of Draco for being the bigger person and ignoring the idiot.
"Not here, you bloody tease," he answered gruffly. "Just let me get these things situated, then we can go. I have to swing by my flat first, though."

At least five children, by the way? Good heavens. I know the Weasleys are your adoptive family but that doesn't mean you have to model yours after them exactly. And if you do go to surrogacy route, five may strain the generosity of your female friends.
It had been a month. A whole damn month and Harry hadn't made any progress on Draco's case. Slytherins were crafty and Parkinson and Zabini particularly so. They'd covered their tracks well and their solicitors had buried him and Ron in a mountain of paperwork.
He was out of breath by the time they made it to his room (but that had more to do with his anticipation than his exertion). He vanished Draco's clothes--having decided ahead of time that was entirely fair--and herded him with nudges and kisses until he tumbled backwards onto the bed.
It is I, Prinn! I come forth to once again reprise my role as Editer and Updater as Playout will unfortunately be unable to do so for an undetermined amount if time. Fear not! She will still be working on her own stuff and we have a list of works yet unveiled for you to enjoy.
"I'm going to suck you so hard you'll forget your name," Draco promised in a low, dark voice before sliding his tongue down Harry's length again and engulfing the head once he arrived.
Draco still wasn't sure, and nearly pulled off, until Harry's hips caused the still pulsing erection inside him to dig in even deeper. He rolled his eyes at the ravenette.

Harry made a show of considering Draco's plate. "Well I guess since you ate most of it..." He drew out the words as if reluctant and stood to retrieve the French vanilla ice cream from the freezer.
Harry laughed from deep in his belly about the idea of Lucius dropping dead over the books. Malfoy looked him over with obvious appreciation in his gaze, making Harry flush.
" Harry exhaled on a sigh of relief, just before he came with a deep, appreciative groan. "

Draco sat with a pout. Not because he was displeased with the ambiance, the staff, or even the other patrons (there appeared to be another male couple there sitting close together, but whether it was for business or a date could not be determined--and it wasn't his business anyway.) No, he pouted because at the angle they were forced to sit he couldn't conduct his favorite game: play-footsy-with-Harry's-cock.
Dear Harry Potter,

Harry watched as his dinner companion set to his meal with dainty reserve--he was ready for seconds before Draco had even finished half his first. He didn't know if it was because Draco didn't care for the food or if it was just the way he ate. He supposed (with a private smile and a tiny flutter of...something...in his belly) that they'd have to have more meals together in order for him to find out.
He'd mentioned during dinner the possibility of Draco spending the night, but Draco hadn't commented one way or another. Probably too distracted by 15 different simultaneous thoughts at the time, he surmised.
Do. Not. Scratch.
Harry was about to say he didn't need to when Arthur spoke up. "Do you think that perhaps treating your relationship like a dirty secret might...influence the way others perceive it?"
"Is it too tight?" he asked solicitously. "Your wand doesn't respond to me quite as well as my own, of course."
"Hermione gave me one as a joke," he explained, stirring the curry with a wooden spoon. "She always gives me a book for my birthday because I once said they make terrible gifts. She goes out of her way to find the most ridiculous ones she can. That's why I own Gardening the Muggle Way, Breeding Dangerous and Deadly Creatures--An Illustrated Guide, Skeeter's autobiography, and

Draco's smirk widened to a predatory grin, sharp and hungry. "As a matter of fact, no," he answered, tugging playfully on Potter's zipper. "Why should they? Yours would hardly be the first nudity they've ever been exposed to.
"What's wrong?" he asked worriedly. "Are you not feeling well?"
He pulled at the tie of his apron, figuring his part was done. He slid the neck over his head and tossed it half-hazardly back into the drawer.
While his complexion was rough and dark, with equally dark hair sprouting on his legs, forearms, chest, and abdomen (narrowing and becoming more dense the lower it trailed), Draco's skin was soft and porcelain, and it looked virtually hairless below his neck except for the small patches of dark blond in his armpits and at the base of his prick.
"So...uh...did you just want to get started now or...?" he interjected lamely, unwilling to voice the 'or do something else' he'd almost uttered. Although the question was more or less directed at the contents of his bag, he figured Malfoy could get the gist of it well enough. He was clever like that.
"I knew he was lying the next day when I saw my private doctor and asked him to look. I was fine. Blaise apologized, bought me lots of sweets, and never tried it again so I let it go... But he did try to grab me a few times, annoyed me until I would watch him have sex, and climbed into my bed naked a few times... Considering how the whole house was, I thought it was normal. Everyone was fucking someone and usually with someone else."
Merlin, why hadn't he considered the possibility?
But he was also resilient. Hard-working and determined. Surprisingly humble in spite of his upbringing. Charming even, on rare occasions.
You are frequently wrong.
?" she shrewdly inquired after a brief study of the contents.

For all that he had been giving Potter a hard time earlier about his stamina, between the hand on his prick, the one on his bollocks, and the tongue in his arsehole, Draco was rapidly hurtling toward orgasm.

"I'm not going to last," he warned, breaking the kiss to bask in the glory of Draco moaning and writhing beneath him, chanting his name like a prayer. It was a beautiful thing.
"Right," Malfoy snapped, bracing himself on the doorjamb. "Because I have nothing better to do than,
My Secret Santa has given me some rather excellent gifts--I hope that mine to you have been as well received. I've put a lot of thought into them, you know.
He did some hasty straightening on his way to the kitchen to fetch tea. He wasn't going to give Malfoy the grand tour or anything, but neither did the man need to see his pants laying on the ground.
"C'mere," Harry replied with a chuckle, drawing Draco against him. "I happen to like the way you're dressed. The lack of clean trousers was all part of my clever plan to keep you starkers." He groped Draco's pert little arse and appreciated the results of his not-at-all-intentional deviousness. "As for those denims," he kissed along the top of Draco's shoulder, "they're comfortable. You just have no appreciation for the process of breaking a pair in. A few small holes aren't justification to turn one's back on all that hard work."
"No, thank you," Harry replied, relieved. "I'd rather let them misconstrue my actions and fill their pages with baseless speculation than twist my actual words. I can laugh the former off much easier than the latter."

Draco,
"There was mention of a special show if I did as you asked..." he prompted slyly.
*****
But he had contacted Malfoy as an Auror, he reminded himself with a stern shake of his head. He would be strictly professional--brief and by-the-books--when he visited that afternoon.

Once they stopped, Draco turned to face Harry directly. He quirked a fine, silver-blonde brow at the Gryffindor.
That sounds acceptable and good for practice. I play Quidditch with my godkids, and Ron and his team sometimes (he still plays for the Chudley Cannons.)
Auror Potter,
He was going to enjoy this.
Draco stepped into Harry's personal space with a grin and tugged gently at his blazer. He looked back up to catch Harry's eye and his grin grew even wider.

"Want me to touch it, Harry?" he teased in a deep, husky voice. His free hand joined the other, curling around Harry's hip and down his thigh. "Want me to give you a tight hole to fuck?"
He watched Potter closely, his countenance a little too innocent now. He waited until Potter brought a spoonful of curry to his lips before slipping a bare foot between his legs and petting his calf through his trousers.
"Where was this concern for Draco's well being when you invited a psychopath and his murderous cronies into your home?" he sneered disdainfully. "Not much of a future there, as it turns out."
"I do believe I am traumatized now," he breathed with a bright smile. "I'll have nightmares for weeks, I'm certain..."
It was eerie. Lonely.
Malfoy,

Meet me in my room and I'll show you rather than tell you.
"This looks great, Harry," Hermione said (with obvious intent to set a better tone for the meal). She handed him a glass of wine and passed the salad bowl to Draco--a leafy green peace offering. Draco took it with thanks and complimented her politely on the colorful assortment of vegetables it contained.

the one who said you'd quit the party scene last night," he said hastily, defensively. "I simply put two and two together. That is rather what I do when not actively engaging Dark Wizards."
"Heh. Not all the time," he clarified, relaxing somewhat and offering a half smile. "But I can be available during the day as long as you run plans by me first. And you've made a compelling case for me to keep my evenings open."
"I'll do more than just wrinkle them," Harry muttered darkly as Draco rolled him off, practically dumping him to the floor. He had been so mindlessly focused he hadn't thought to prepare himself for a quick rejection. However, he grinned as he lifted himself to sit with his legs wide open and his hands flat on the floor.
Stupid fate.
An Unexpected Reunion
He swayed on his feet, no longer furious, but drained.
Harry,
"We were just...uh...waiting for you," Potter said defensively, tugging at his fringe as he did so. Even without the tell, it was woefully unconvincing. His prevarication was so bad, in fact, that it probably had the opposite effect and made Granger think they had been up to something decidedly less innocent than a bit of play.
"Are you certain you're ready?" Despite asking, Draco lifted one hand to Harry's lips and pressed two of his fingers there. "Suck."
"You did well, Auror Potter. Who knew you had taste?" Draco chuckled, picking up a pair of complimentary opera glasses sat upon a golden stem. He looked at the contraption curiously. He recognized what they were, of course, but they were bent into the stem. A moment or two of experimenting finally released the binoculars and he snapped them into place properly. Draco held them up with a triumphant grin.

He withdrew his hands and faced the hob to give the curry a final stir and begin to ladle it over the now-fluffy couscous. "And then there's Damien. He's smart, he's snarky, he's not afraid to challenge Leopold, and he knows how to
So far things were going a fair sight better than they could have. For example, he hadn’t even been hexed yet. Malfoy was being downright magnanimous. It seemed like everything was going exactly to plan and Harry had nothing to worry about...
"Hold up, Potter," Savage interrupted, sounding mildly surprised. "Where're you going with the victim?"
"Bloody hell!" Ron exclaimed from the doorway, having apparently just arrived. He looked like he was torn between sicking up and punching something.

You Gryffindors are such obstinate prudes. Do you really think no one has ever wanked in St. Mungo's before? And if word of it did get out, what would the headline be, "Harry Potter Has A Sex Drive! And Other Facts That Should Surprise Abolutely No One"?
Good man.
He didn't want to talk about it any more than was necessary. Lucius' appearance had been a bad omen: the day that started off so well ended with a frustratingly anti-climactic attempt to arrest Parkinson, who'd apparently gone to ground after they brought Zabini in. Supposedly no one had seen her since the day previous and the search of her home suggested that she'd packed up for a long trip (empty wardrobe, missing toiletries in the bathroom). He wasn't going to tell Draco, though. Not yet, anyway. He didn't want to worry him any more than was necessary--he dealt with enough anxiety already.

Harry smirked but declined to comment. Draco took a few more bites of dinner--to be polite and because it really wasn't so bad--before he chose to speak again.
Besides, once we're through with our "meeting" I doubt you’ll let me leave.
He took a steadying breath and went for it. "I love you."
Though Draco was plenty receptive, and Gieves known for his discretion (the tailor would have to be with
Harry snorted. "Something special, hm?" He twined a bit of Draco's hair around a (clean) finger and tugged playfully. "And how should I position myself for this 'something special'?"
"Whatever," Draco held his hand up in a submissive fashion as Potter jerked away before wrapping it over his own waist. There was a sardonic smile playing at his thin lips. "I was going to offer to soften it for you, but I suppose you always did prefer things
The manager ignored Draco completely (the bastard!) and focused entirely on the commanding presence of the Hero. He nodded, bowed, and practically sobbed--far too dramatically for it to be sincere--his apologies. By the end of it, nearly a half-hour later, Draco was rolling his eyes and huffing angrily, as if he could breathe fire like his namesake.

Harry's head snapped up from the files he was reading on his way into the exam room, instantly recognizing that voice but disbelieving it still.
"Hm? Oh... Well, about half a second after--"
He bent forward to take Draco's lips in a biting kiss and ground their pelvises together.
But really you have a lot to be happy about!
Draco gasped as he was thrust into. He bit Harry's ear in retaliation and thrust back--hard. He pressed Harry's chest into the shower wall as he grasped his hip tight to keep him place while his right hand gripped the Auror's hard, swollen cock; his own hard length slid between Harry's crease.
"I would have done anyway," Harry replied, deftly untying the apron's knots. "That's just good manners."
*****
Draco had turned back to stare among the party goers as he spoke; upon the word "forced" he seemed to lose his smile in favor of a grimace. Though, with a small pique if satisfaction, he did note a small number of curious on-lookers. Some turned away at being noticed while others just held their chins higher.

"Uh oh!" he teased. "Looks like the Auror is losing his touch, being topped so easily."

"Extenuating circumstances," Harry countered cheekily, tipping the bottle into Draco's glass and filling it to the brim.

They meant different things.
Draco snorted, unabashed.
Thus settled, he pushed off the wall, intent to return to the birthday festivities...when Draco pushed him right back to claim a greedy snog and grope. Harry yelped when his arse was rudely pinched.
"You didn't ask," he fired back.
Despite his haughty tone, his eyes were rings of mercury around pupils blown wide with lust.
By "then some", do you mean that after I rip your clothes off, I get to suck you dry and shag you all night?
Draco continued to slice the vegetables with an especially smug smirk. The sound of the sizzling meat filled the momentary silence as Potter put out cups and flatware.
The girl is safe. She is home with her mother who wisely turned the lout out on his ear. They, too, will be seeing Mind Healers to deal with the trauma. I think they will be all right, though. They both send their thanks to you for your heroic assistance.

; actively resisted in sly, subtle ways, aided by his Godfather before Snape's untimely end. He'd been found out, of course. A person could only undermine one of the world's most accomplished Legillimens for so long before something gave. Harry guessed that would have been the beginning of Malfoy's current struggles, but he'd never ask. Some things were best left unspoken.
"So bossy," he admonished playfully as he grabbed his necessary tools and went to work. "Just remember demands are not one of my turn-ons. Not unless they are delivered in a sexy growl."
******
But then why would he be standing there with a hand outstretched, mischief on his face and challenge in his laughing eyes?
Harry chuckled heartily as Draco panted against his neck. He let his lube--and come-covered hand fall to the side but left the other under Draco's jumper to lightly pet at his waist, riding high on a wave of euphoria that felt bigger than the orgasm alone could account for.
Malfoy relented on a sigh and said, more to himself than to Harry, "I always knew you were a nutter. I tried convincing everyone in school but for some reason they wouldn't believe me."
Draco was inclined to agree.
Malfoy bid him goodnight with a depressingly chaste brush of lips and apparated home from Grimmauld's doorstep.

“Fine,” he relented tersely, tone making it clear he was deeply put out. Which was pretty much par for the course with anything Harry directed him to do in a therapeutic context. “Wait here.”
"He said we have two minutes," Draco answered, grinning like a fox, before diving for Harry's nethers once again.

"Harry," Draco moaned between panted breaths and whines. "So close... Just--there! Fuck me there!"

Your concern is truly touching.
"Well of course I couldn't have known that this is where you two would end up," she replied, casual as you please, "but I certainly thought it was possible. Why else would I have given you his book?"
Harry snorted. That sounded like Malfoy.
(Do you realize you called me "beautiful," or was that an accident?)
Draco leaned back against the mantle as prompted. He smiled at Potter from his position next to the fire, with his arms crossed loosely over his stomach as he watched the Auror work the floo.
Draco wasn't sure he liked the gleam in Potter's eyes--the man was definitely plotting something. He arched a brow and licked kiss-tender lips, eyeing the magnificently hard prick prominently and unabashedly on display.
Unsure what the safe, wise, or appropriate response to a loaded statement like that could be, Harry simply made a non-committal sound.
*****
...Except, perhaps, the angry banging at the shed door.
Is that your way of inviting me over? And do I also get to strip you down?

"I got distracted," he replied, kissing his way up Draco's flat, smooth stomach to the hollow of his throat, which he flicked with his tongue.
Ron vehemently shook his head.
He glanced at the cover of Swept Away (pirate captain with a heart of gold--so cliched, but so good, anyway) and noted Morias's first name for the first time in a long while: Drachontas. The first time he'd seen it, he'd made fun of it for sounding like the Disney princess until Hermione set him straight about the pronunciation. It was Drac--
But what he should do about it.
It was fortunate for Harry he had experience managing a hungover Ron when it came time to wake Draco in the morning. Draco hadn't cursed or spat or tried to throw hexes, luckily, but he did make a concerted effort to burrow deeper into the covers and sleep through Harry's gentler attempts at waking him.
The temperature inside was perfectly pleasant and the air fragrant without being cloying. An artificial stream burbled merrily along one side. The table set in the middle of it all was pretty, but not overwrought. Honestly, the food could be rubbish and he'd still probably have a decent enough time just looking at everything.
Harry snapped, well past the limits of his patience.
Draco,
Er...except that...no. They did not.

"Well, I did try to tell you," Harry insisted with a few panted breaths before his lips were reclaimed.
Harry hadn't realized how nice such a trivial kindness would feel until experiencing such a striking lack of it.
"Did you tell him about the first time we drank together at your place? Stole some of his dad's good stuff. Of course, Draco hogged most of it. Good thing for me! I posed him naked on his bed and made him think we actually did it for a week! Stupid boy acted like such a cry baby about it that I told him the truth, but what a jerk, right? As if having sex with me would be
"He wants me to stay the night and wants to work out a relationship, and before you make any snide remarks about how he'll dump me the next morning... You know Gryffindors--they're a noble lot," he said, all in one breath.
Harry's skin prickled, his breathing shallowed, and he became literally hot under the collar as his temper rose. Seven years since he'd last seen the smug bastard, yet Malfoy knew how to press his buttons as well as when they'd been kids.
"I'd offer to give it a trim," Harry replied archly, "but you and I both know how well that would go." He pointed at his unruly mop of hair with a self-deprecating grin and then popped a tender snap pea into his mouth.

Malfoy nodded. "I don't expect Mother to return from her 'holiday' anytime soon. It's been eight years."

"You really like the dress thing, huh?" Harry said with a chuckle as he affectionately pet his lover's bony hips. He returned the kiss a second later (though his was more a quick peck and nuzzle).
He cleared his throat and rubbed the back of his neck, uncomfortable. He and Ron didn't usually have 'feelings talks.'
to meet you," Pansy's half distracted, taunting speech practically oozed with arrogance. He could just imagine her casually observing her nails with a victorious sneer while letting the cronies do as they please. "I assume Potter has long since taken that precious arse you've been saving, so it shouldn't be too rough to handle. And I'm certain the Savior would have no qualms with it. After all, aren't Gryffindors all about sharing?"
he thought irritably, annoyed at both Malfoy for the preposterous display and himself for being affected by it.
Draco,
"Hey, don't get mad at me about it! I wasn't the git who let Death Eaters into the school!" Weasley seemed to immediately regret his outburst, though it made it quite apparent he was going to have issues with his resentment... As to be expected, Draco supposed. Weasley instantly snapped a hand to his mouth.

Dear Potter,
Imagine that.
The best news of the afternoon came when Robards announced the Hit Wizards had taken Goyle into custody. He'd been hiding out with family in the Welsh countryside, keeping a low profile and tending sheep. Once the Unspeakables had isolated his magical signature from the syringe, it wasn't hard to find him.
wasn't a whore, but there was no way Harry could explain how he knew that without telling secrets that weren't his to tell.) "He's all right."
He nudged Draco's foot with his own. "Take this with a grain of salt because it's coming from a Gryffindor, but I don't think it's stupid to want to believe the best of someone." He smiled softly.
"You're not an idiot," Harry countered, tone gentle but unyielding. "You made a mistake."
Malfoy swallowed and gave it a go. After a few overly-cautious, ungainly steps, he got the hang of it--as Harry knew he would--and set to climbing an invisible tower, a frown of concentration of his face. (The man, Harry was learning, had a great many frowns, but at least he was game to try.) He leaned heavily on the arm bars for support--not because his legs couldn't take the whole of his weight, but because he was no longer sure on his feet.
******
Harry wondered how different that was from the boy he had known in school. (Not the bit about the looks. He'd always been too pretty for Harry's comfort. But the personality…)
"You should at least consider having some of mine. You're going to need your strength if we're to keep up the ambitious level of shagging you have planned," he smirked, then added, "

Anyway, if you had been there, you would have dealt with the girl and probably been fine since you've had Dragon Pox before. Not to mention you never discussed this particular illness with me, Mister Protocol. Part of the reason you were assigned as my partner was for things like this (and because no one else wanted you, so it was either me or boring desk work unless someone else volunteered, but mainly the whole "keep Potter out of the hospital" thing).
At least the desk is clean now, which I do appreciate. I've been meaning to do that for a year. I usually clean it during Spring but I was caught up with work.
He remained on the sofa while Draco trudged upstairs, feeling lazy enough to consider casting a cleaning charm on himself (but they just weren't as reliable as good old fashioned soap and water). Forcing himself up with great effort, he made his way to the loo, thinking he'd have a look around while he was in there.
Malfoy smirked and crossed his arms loosely before him, looking for all the world like a kneazle with a mouse between its paws.
"This is a terrible idea," he broke away to gasp, unfastening Potter's denims and shoving them down his hips as he spoke.

This could be Harry's opportunity to find out how much of that was fiction contrived to sell books to randy housewives and how much of it was...Malfoy.
Harry tried to think of a clever response but his thoughts were muddled—it would be so much easier to simply hex the git and be done with it.
Draco rolled his eyes but the small smile he sported remained. He ran his hands over Harry's shoulders and arms as he awaited his answer, and as soon as he got it he grinned wide.
If you're having trouble thinking up an appropriate way to show your undying gratitude, a weekend at the spa will suffice. It is almost enough just to see you happy. (Almost.)
Draco was...
Soon enough, Malfoy approached--wearing an overly-warm coat and a hunted expression. Harry nodded in greeting and waved Malfoy on past the station (he'd already signed him in as an approved visitor and arranged for him to be able to keep his wand, thinking that would help him to feel more secure). He fell into step beside the unusually quiet man and silently offered him a brown paper bag--containing one chocolate chunk biscuit from the cafe, as requested--and a paper cup steaming with strong black tea (because he was feeling generous) and led them to the Lifts.
Knowing his fingers were thicker than Draco's and really not wanting to hurt him, Harry pressed the two already poised over his entrance into the burning, clutching, impossibly tight heat.
Zabini's head flew backwards, the punch nearly sending him sprawling, but he managed to retain his footing. Harry shook his stinging hand out while Zabini's potion-blond date shrieked vitriol at him and Draco. The sharp pain blessed him with a bolt of mental clarity--
One hand moved from Harry's hip as the other doubled its steadying efforts. With the one now free, Draco tentatively slid his fingers down Harry's testicles (brushing against them only a moment) before dipping his hand to the patch of skin just below. He made a fist and massaged two knuckles firmly into Harry's perineum.
An idea began taking shape as he was speaking that made his heart rate pick up and his prick twitch in his pants. "Or better yet, maybe we should reenact it. You can tell me what I'm supposed to do."
******
It was also obvious that this wasn't Malfoy's first quidditch match--he would expect sex at some point. Which was fine: Harry would, too, of course. But if Malfoy expected it to be like the sex he wrote about--intense and passionate and earth-shattering--well, that might be a bit of a disappointment. He'd never had sex like that before. His experience with shagging was that it was slightly more interesting than wanking; a novel way to get his rocks off. It had never been the kind of spine-tingling, toe-curling, soul-rending lovemaking Malfoy described (in vivid detail).
With skill like that, he could be teaching more than just Flying, that much was certain. Perhaps he would take over for Flitwick when the Charms instructor finally retired. Or there was always Defense. Bilburry had held the post the last two years, meaning the so-called curse--if there ever truly was one--was broken, but the rate of turnover for the position remained unusually high.
Draco dispelled the glamour on Harry's neck. The tip of his wand tickled a bruise for just a second before slowly traveling down to the hollow of his throat--down, down to the superficial cleft of his bosom before traveling back up to the Auror's lips.
," he choked out, "you don't need to. I'll be fine in a couple minutes."
“We both know you’ve never been much of a gentleman,” Harry supplied instead, earning himself a reluctant chuckle.
he thought as he took a generous swig and leaned back against the ivory column just to the left of the drinks. It was covered in swirls of white and silver ivy that coincidentally matched his suit.
"Father always wanted me to help restore our name by acting 'like a proper Malfoy', which may have helped spur my hermitage."

was the one in control.
In the meantime, he grasped Draco's hand, determined to make a better show of holding it on the walk back. Draco hadn't challenged him as such, but his snide commentary was as good as one.
"Nope. Nuh uh. No way," Harry shoved himself into a seated position, scooted to the edge of the table nearest Draco, and reeled him in. Unless he'd wanked himself to completion while taking care of Harry (which a quick visual inspection revealed was not the case), Harry was not going to let him leave without having had his turn. That resolve cut through his post-orgasm languor and gave him the boost he needed to shake the cobwebs out of his head.
"That's fine. We can take it slow," he said reassuringly. "I've dated, but I've never had sex so it'll be a learning experience for both of us."
Apparently the salacious rumors about Slytherin house were true. That was a disturbing thought. And of course Malfoy had waited until Harry'd taken another bite before saying all of that. It would be his luck to meet his end choking on a carrot because of the man's lack of filter and preponderance of cheek.
He had to be sure.
Draco sighed into Harry shoulder and closed his eyes, giving way to sensation as his body was loosened. He kissed the flesh he met there before slowly sitting up right once again. When asked, Draco smirked devilishly and shoved the sick man back onto the bed.
first kiss, Mister Snog-Meister
Draco groaned deeply as Potter entered him, head dropping between his arms and eyes falling shut. Potter went slowly but without pause, which was fine by Draco. He was consumed by the sensation of his body stretching to accommodate Potter's girth. It was a satisfying feeling of fullness and warmth and he reveled in it. (What a sight they must make with Potter in his ball gown and Draco spread wantonly before him; it was fortunate the house-elves didn't trouble themselves with such things.)
Now to find a comb...
The size is correct. I checked.
Dean leaned forward, brown eyes flashing. "How long have you been...'dating'?" he asked, the word pregnant with suggestion.
," he grumbled, elbowing the boneless git in the side. (He was heavier than he looked!) Potter mumbled an unintelligible protest but complied. He rolled off Draco, pulling him along until their positions were reversed, chest-to-chest this time. Draco straddled his legs and deigned to give him a sweet, slow kiss in thanks for a fuck well done.
Of course, he knew quite well what the Auror referred too. He just wanted to see if he could get Potter to voice it for him.
Harry was feeling right chuffed as Malfoy departed the candy floss coloured room once more.
--and Draco promptly shut it with the fingers of his free hand.
I should also point out that ONE post from Playout is missing. One. Let's see if anyone could tell where it was?
My portkey activates at 3:00. I will be waiting by the dining room table when you return home from work.
Draco thought as he noticed how quickly (and almost enthusiastically) he had gained Potter's attentions. Perhaps he was just being hopeful? As Head Auror it was his job to be polite and attentive at functions such as these, was it not?
Draco rolled his eyes again, much more pronounced this time at her acid tone, as he considered what he would tell her. Harry might not appreciate being outed, especially to Pansy, and even more so with Draco's name attached.
The Gryffindor tossed his head back with a strangled cry, his ligaments and muscles taut and straining, the hand in his arse stilling while the one on his cock jerked unsteadily. Ropy strands of come painted the wall and Draco whimpered--his creature brain and human mind clashing fiercely over what he should do.
He was jarred from his thoughts by a sudden sound like the crack of a whip.
"Godrick, yes!" he choked, mindless with lust.
Draco sighed and shrugged, already knowing he had been rejected. Harry's job required that he remain cool and unreadable, but every now and then Draco caught certain nuances in his appearances that made it easy for him to figure out the reticent man. Like the way his lips wouldn't quite lift in his smile or his eyes would flash with something related to irritation or concern.

...On second thought, it wasn't all that surprising.
He let go of Harry's cock and sat up to grab for his bag, the one left at the foot of the bed. He had to crawl away for a moment to reach, dig inside, and then assume his place back on Harry's lap--making sure to grind their pelvises together as he moved to get comfortable. In one hand he held a blue bottle with a cork stopper, in the other he grasped Harry's firm pectorals and pet his perfect (and slightly furred) abdominals.

"...Now what about your clothes?"
? Really?"
"Which one was your... favorite?"

"I set my recovery back at least three months because of my stupid pride," Harry answered frankly, holding Malfoy's thoughtful gaze. "I hope you can learn from my mistakes and not repeat them. I guarantee it'll save you some hardship. And if your medical professional tells you to do something," here he pointed unabashedly at himself, "you should do it."
Was that first smile even meant for him? Maybe not.

be your fault. You might be a terrible kisser.)
Harry waved off Draco's unnecessary defense. "It's all right. I know you didn't put him up to it. Though he was right unpleasant, he didn't do anything but grill me on my intentions with you. And maybe also try to bribe me into breaking up with you. I wasn't entirely clear on that part."

was a direction Harry would follow to the letter. No qualms or conditions.
Harry took up Draco's hand. Though he felt a twinge of discomfort about doing so in his workplace--which happened to employ half of Wizarding Britain--it was late enough (early enough?) that few people would be around to see them. And if someone did, so what? It's not like their relationship was a secret.
"I decided to ask around to see if perhaps he might be using the situation to get close to you--since he did have that obsession with you back in the day--and I heard some pretty interesting stuff."

After filling his own plate more generously than Harry would have expected given the other man’s slender frame, Malfoy remarked, “I find myself rather more peckish than usual. Is that true for you, as well?” He eyed Harry’s obscene plate. “You always did have a...

snooping," he scolded petulantly, holding the novel defensively to his chest. "You are such an entitled, infuriating prat! This is the thanks I get for letting you into my home? Ugh!"
Harry briefly entertained the idea of feeling embarrassed by the observation but decided to cram a forkful of food into his mouth instead. The combination of salt and fat was a great comfort to him.
"What changed your mind about him? And do you mean to tell me that you want to
I also had no idea that's what your home life was like. Between yours and mine, I don't know which I would've hated more. Probably still mine (you have a mother who loves you, at least), but that's not so cut and dry as I once thought.
Harry panted and shook. They weren't going to make it to dinner at this rate.
"Where are we eating tonight, my personal Sex Auror? Judging by your clothes... Some place nice but also casual?"
"I insulted him," he elaborated, hoping to get the conversation done with as quickly as possible. And with a minimum of bloodshed.
He dropped into his chair across from Ron and leaned forward with his arms braced on his thighs. "Cold-cocking Zabini wasn't directly related," he answered with a self-satisfied smirk, "but it felt damn good. He was being an unrepentant arsehole. But that's neither here nor there. The important thing is his date--the very same witch who'd served me and Draco at the Garden Room!"
But he attempted to turn the tides of Draco's ire one last time. (If this one didn't work, he was just going home...and taking his dinner with him.)
"I believe it is time for me to take my leave, Malfoy," he said as the dance came to an end. "Fun as this has been," he added sardonically, releasing his unusual dance partner and bowing with his forearm braced across his stomach, according to the custom.
, Harry decided, mind turning furiously through possible scenarios.
It was brilliant for them that they were still so wonderfully in love, but he wasn't exactly in the mood to be witness to it. Not so soon after Ian. And definitely not at another bloody Ministry function he was forced to attend against his will. (He still wanted to know where in the Head Auror's handbook did it say he'd have to attend ruddy
He wanked Draco with long, sure strokes, using the same grip he liked on himself (made easier in virtue of their position).
He summoned the discarded wad of newspaper from where it lay and handed it to Draco. "Rubbish doesn't belong on the ground," he teased, parroting Draco's words from earlier as he deposited the stunned man onto the ground. "I'll make sure we find a bin on our walk," he added cheekily, standing and dusting himself off. He made sure Draco's wand was safely stowed in his pocket and not anywhere it could be used against him.
At Draco's prompting, he entered the restaurant with his dinner companion close on his heels. He looked around the space as they were escorted through it and came to feel underdressed and out of place--as far as he could tell, he was the only person not wearing hand-tailored robes. Rather than making him embarrassed, however, it only served to heighten his level of indignation.
Of course I want you! I have for so long. How could you not know that already? You're intelligent, incredibly fit, exacting, funny (sometimes), and, Godrick, everything I have ever wanted in a man. You even see past the celebrity crap I can't stand. You stand up to me, you're always yourself, and I really, really enjoyed kissing you. A lot. I've wanted to do it again every minute of every day since it happened, but I thought you thought it was a terrible mistake and wanted to pretend it never took place.
What changed?

"I guess I'll be going, as well," Neville spoke after a beat, breaking the awkward tension that threatened.

He sniffed, appraising Potter closely, carefully.
He summoned his patronus to deliver the message. The brilliant white stag had the good grace--and a bit of cheek--to bow regally to Draco, who looked somewhat taken aback to be that close to the imposing construct. It turned its ghostly eyes to Harry, awaiting his instruction. "Tell Hermione: I'm safe. Shagging Malfoy. Neither one of us is dosed (I checked). Send help if you haven't heard from me by Tuesday."

But the events of the last few minutes had left him with a sour stomach and sorely disappointed. His unlikely partnership with Potter had been so much more positive and productive than he could have hoped that by the time Granger arrived and displayed her famous wit, he'd begun to believe he might be cured by nightfall.
He smirked to himself, intending fully to call Potter's bluff. It was a win-win scenario for him: either he would be treated to more of Potter squirming or he'd have an opportunity to outdo Blaise in the category of shameless sexcapades--a distinct accomplishment, to be sure.
Harry stayed up for another several hours, writing owls to be sent first thing in the morning and compiling case notes. He concluded the night with a short wank and a long shower.
For the span of a half dozen panicked heartbeats, Harry thought Malfoy was going to kiss him. He'd raised himself up onto his arms and stared down at him with a mischievous glint to his eyes, and Harry, for all that he was determined not to take advantage, couldn't find it in himself to breathe one word of protest. It was with an unsettling mix of relief and disappointment that he got up after Malfoy finally released him.
"Merlin, Draco," Harry breathed a deep sigh of relief. "I was worried about you. I'm fine." He took in Draco's disheveled appearance--the man looked like he'd been in a fight with a rabid quill. "What in the world have you been up to?"
