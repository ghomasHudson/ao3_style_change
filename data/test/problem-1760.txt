Tiny lights dot the ceiling, fading from warm white in the bedroom area to gold and green where Draco’s low-slung sofa and chairs crouch around a round coffee table, and silvery bright around the gleaming sink and counters, glinting off an array of kitchen utensils and pans that Harry finds rather stunning, both in their appearance and the fact that Draco possesses them at all.
Harry looks down at his saturated clothes and the puddle growing around his feet and shivers violently. Forcing his cold-numbed fingers to work, he retrieves his wand and dries himself with a fierce spell. It’s not as good as Ginny’s, but he is no longer dripping, and that will do.
“My mother gave me the Black inheritance early,” Draco continues, reaching out and combing snow from Juno’s fur with his fingers. “I used it to buy the bus, and here we are. It’s ironic, really… Mother had her community service taking care of old people. Now she’s living on a commune in Belgium with people half her age, and I’m here, driving the biddy club around the British bloody Isles.”
“Harry Potter ain’t going to have a wife, Ida,” Corrie says before Harry can respond. “He’s a ho-mo-sexual.”
“Yes, you will,” Draco says, grinning and leaning in for the briefest moment before hurrying into the darkness, leaving Harry feeling shaken but wonderful, alive with anticipation and arousal, and the scent of lemons everywhere.
“You can catch the next one,” he says, wishing he hadn’t left his wand in the cabin. A stinging hex or two would be very well-placed about now.
“That’s right,” Eilish says. “On Thursdays she has her lunch at the Leaky Cauldron and then her son takes her to do her food shopping in Diagon Alley.”
“Yeah, well, don’t get comfortable, I’m starving. Let’s go back to the shop and firecall Hermione and then get some lunch,” Harry says.
“Let’s hope that’s not too soon,” Harry says, mostly to himself, wondering just which factor influences Draco’s behaviour most strongly—the need to protect his adopted family or the pure desire to break the rules and get one over on an authority figure.
“Yeah,” Harry says, bringing his hand to his face and pressing it to his hot skin. “I think I’d better go.”
“Have you come to buy something?” Potter asks, ignoring his comment and not bothering to look up from his task of cleaning out a Puffskein enclosure.
Molly says nothing but hugs him tightly, face pressed into his chest. When she steps back, her eyes are brimming and Harry’s jumper is slightly damp. Deciding not to draw attention to it, he sits down and allows her to resume buttering large, floury bread rolls.
“I promise,” Harry says, already thinking about splitting open some of Molly’s scones and filling them with butter and crispy bacon.
“Again?” Ron repeats, attempting to sit up straight and sending Harry sliding almost all the way off the sofa. “You know, Fred, the Auror Department does have a reputation to protect.”
“Trust him to be able to look like that in a pair of bloody pyjamas,” Deb mutters to Luna as she climbs into the bus and finds her seat.
“It’s only a mouse. Will it really do much damage if we just leave it alone?” Harry asks. He can see the light reflecting on the tiny creature’s beady black eyes. It seems to regard him appealingly, whiskers trembling and breathing rapid.
“I didn’t lie to her as a child and I don’t lie to her now,” Draco says with a grin. “She would know.”
When one of the teachers sticks her head out of a classroom and tells them all to SHUSH because her students are still taking a test, the younger children look at each other and exchange little ‘oooh’ sounds, and Luna hushes them with a smile still tugging at her face.
Face heating with shame, Harry pauses to take a deep breath and thank anyone who might be listening that Hermione had not decided to send a Howler.
Harry says goodbye to Daraja and wanders on, past two little boys having their faces painted like gargoyles, past the smiley lady at the sweet stall, and back towards Borteg’s. The shop is packed, and Mr Borteg has no time to comment when Harry breezes in and spends a good half an hour selecting the perfect whisky for Molly and Arthur’s Christmas present. He does, however, apply a heavy discount at the till and treat Harry to a smile that is festive and brilliantly macabre all at once.
Ignoring his protests, he puts it on Draco’s head and stands back to admire his profile. Draco arches an eyebrow.
“Is that right?” Mary Ann asks. “Well, I don’t know, but it takes pictures when you press this button—look, that’s my breakfast!”
“I’m not trying to do anything like that,” Harry insists, wanting to grab the string out of Draco’s hands and stuff it into his mouth. “But you can’t keep—”
“That sounds brilliant,” Harry sighs, imagining this flavour combination alongside the crackleballs he has already experienced and knowing it will be incredible.
She heads back to her partner and Harry darts one last glance at Daraja, who is now beaming and matching her customers with their Orishas. Something pulls at the pocket of his jeans and he looks down to see Needle, who has been miraculously quiet throughout the whole incident.
Harry laughs along with everyone in the room but Draco, who is still regarding the whole ritual with deep confusion.
Draco says nothing. He has no idea what he could possibly say to make this alright for Harry, and right now, that is all he can think about doing. The parrot takes off rather suddenly, startling Harry and making him lean against Draco. The heat of his body presses insistently against Draco’s side, and when his hand flies out to steady himself, his fingers wrap around Draco’s wrist.
“Of course,” Harry says, and in the face of bewilderment, he opts to carry on. “So, anyway, Angelina’s treating the whole lead up to the wedding as some kind of training exercise, and there’s no way George would get away with a night out anywhere close to the day, so we decided…” Harry falls silent as a large dark shape swishes through the curtain that separates the driver’s area from the rest of the bottom deck. “What on earth is that?”
“Shh,” Harry whispers, and then lets out a snort of laughter that draws a very severe look from Rose.
“Ah,” Harry says, nodding. It hurts. “I’d just burst in there, all ‘friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!’ and we’d have a crack team of Aurors down here in five minutes flat?”
The squid peers down at them, shifting one enormous eye and then the other. With a sigh of air that lifts Draco’s hair from his forehead, it extends one tentacle to the edge of the lake, forming a bridge that Stanley scuttles over quite happily. He jumps and tacks to be picked up, and Draco grabs him the moment he manages to wade out of the water.
“Isn’t he lovely?” Grace says, pointing at Harry with a box of assorted crackleballs. “Wouldn’t you swap your husband for one like that?”
“Possibly, but the bristle beetle is native to Scotland,” Harry says. “It’s unusual to find a whole family group out in the open, though.”
Draco says nothing. He just stares at Brenda, who may be small for her species but is still a good five feet long from snout to tail and is covered in an impressive light brown armour plating. She turns slowly and regards Draco with inscrutable dark eyes, opening her mouth casually as the rain starts to hammer down around them and displaying pointed yellow teeth.
“Harry, neither of us has enemies on this street,” Draco says, dropping into a crouch against the wall and stroking Needle’s feathers. “I hope I don’t have any at all… not any more.”
“You bought all that whisky and couldn’t try any of it, so I gave this bottle to Mr Borteg and asked him to take the alcohol out of it,” Harry explains, suddenly feeling nervous. “It should still taste the same, but there won’t be any of that spinny feeling that you don’t like.”
“What’s he talking about, two hours?” he asks Montague, who merely yawns and settles down with his nose in the crook of Harry’s arm. “We’ve only been here a few minutes.”
Potter glances up, green eyes flickering with amusement. “You need a replacement filter cube for your tubeworm farm?” he asks, lifting an eyebrow.
“It doesn’t need to be,” Draco mutters. He picks his way through the lights and addresses the bus from next to his leather chair. “Will you stop that? White lights? Red ones? I haven’t got any purple ones,” he sighs, pushing his hair out of his face in irritation.
Not that any amount of wondering is about to stop him hailing the Knight Bus and settling in the spring-loaded seat before five minutes have passed.
“I don’t know,” he whispers. “I know he likes eating plants and biting people’s clothes… I also know that mute swans aren’t mute because Rose told me. I don’t know what they weigh.”
“Sadly, I can’t remember,” Draco says, pulling him in for a kiss and a moment of delicious closeness before drawing back and staring between them with a look of quiet horror. “Good grief, it’s everywhere.”
“This is my mother’s favourite drink. We don’t have a celebration in our house without it. Perhaps you and your wife-to-be can celebrate with it, too,” she says, flushing gently and hurrying to present Mr Borteg with her money bag.
He wonders what Draco would make of all of this, how he’d deal with a sick, fussy child and a messy kitchen. And then he thinks of Ida, of all of them, and the Draco who had risked a nurse’s wrath just to see his friend for five minutes and make sure she was okay. A wave of painful warmth spirals through him and he closes his eyes, holding on to Hugo tightly.
“Lister,” she supplies, eyes flicking around the shop and settling on Needle, who peers at her for a moment and then tucks his head under his wing. Not for the first time, Harry feels rather envious of this ability.
“I don’t think Draco is a casual sort of bloke,” Ron says thoughtfully. “He’s… you know… intense and a bit weird, but I think if you check the label on that coat of his, it’ll say… ‘commitment’.”
At the door, Harry watches as each of them in turn tries knocking and yelling through the letterbox. He has a go himself, though he doubts it will make a difference, and sure enough, there is no response from Ida.
The next day, Harry is still nowhere to be seen, and Draco’s behaviour remains... unusual. He still seems tired and anxious, but more than that, his glimmer is fierce and bright, flowing around him in a way that is completely at odds with his expression. Luna is puzzled, even more so when she realises that he hasn’t mentioned Harry even once since they seemed so close at the weekend.
Harry nods. “We’ve made you a copy of all our notes, and if you want to come back to my shop—that’s Borteg’s, at the top of the alley—I think we can…” Harry pauses as someone comes barrelling across the cobbles and almost knocks them over. “Sophie? Are you okay?”
“Okay,” Ginny says, slashing her wand at the midges again. She looks down at the stream, expression intense and silvery glimmer rippling. “But imagine this: next Saturday, there’s going to be a solar eclipse.”
Harry dashes across the cobbles and into the restaurant, only slipping once on the icy ground. The dining room is impressively tidy considering the previous day’s celebrations, and several tables are already occupied by people with newspapers and steaming cups of coffee. The waiting staff smile at Harry as he walks through to the kitchen and the chefs look up from their chopping and stirring to acknowledge him with friendly nods.
Harry stands up straight and folds his arms. His most recent scratches and burns are healing nicely, Draco notes to himself.
As she speaks, the bus splutters loudly, engine protesting so violently that the whole bottom deck seems to shiver. After a moment, it settles back down into its usual vibrating hum.
The woman smiles at him and takes the bag, and just for a moment, Harry feels wonderful. The morning sunlight is warm on his face, he’s just made an excellent sale, and a customer has surprised him in the most delightful way. It’s just possible that today is going to be a very good day.
Harry pretends to zip his lips. Phillippe floats the half-done toast to the counter, where he arranges the ingredients in such a way that the most wonderful smell begins to spiral into the air and Harry’s stomach grumbles loudly. With the toasties assembled, Phillippe returns them to the range, where he sends them turning slowly over the flames with a swish of his wand.
“I can’t,” Harry whispers against his lips, resting his hands on Draco’s waist and seeking out warm skin under cold cotton.
“Let’s sweep the steps of Gringotts,” she says, laughing as Benny immediately hunches down and mimics the sour expression of a goblin as he makes energetic brushing motions to the beat.
Next to Eliza, Draco is spinning slowly on one foot in perfect time to the sweeping music, his other leg trailing almost carelessly behind him as though connected by invisible strings to his raised arms. He seems to be oblivious to his audience, expression serene as he leans forward deeply for Eliza’s hands and lowers his upper body almost to the floor, trailing leg now extended beautifully behind him. For long seconds he balances there and then rights himself, turning slowly to regard the others with the resigned flush of someone who has just realised he is being watched.
By midday, he has cleaned everything in sight, filled the house with the scent of beeswax and cleaning charms, and washed every item of clothes he owns, including the ones that were probably already clean.
After all, it’s just possible that Harry and Draco are afraid of each other, at least a little bit. Not in the way that they used to be, and not in the way that makes people hate one another, but in the unknown sort of way, the ‘who are you now?’ sort of way, and the sort of way that makes a heart race in its chest.
The stall is surrounded by the shimmer of magic, as, Harry now realises, is the bonfire. He can see the lights of a small town in the near distance, and it is odd to think that the occupants cannot see him. They have no idea that this strange event, about which he still has many questions, is even taking place, and there is something about the whole thing that makes him suspect that it has been taking place for many years.
“Nice to have a bit of excitement in our lives,” Ron says, emptying the rest of the wine into their glasses.
“Draco,” Harry says softly, and then stops, cut off by an almost deafening rumble of water and rock.
“She has a way with birds,” Draco says, shrugging. “They never go for her. She’s the only person I know who can make a falcon look sorry.”
Harry leans against the cold stone of Sage’s shopfront. “This is making less and less sense. Why two in one night?”
“No time,” he says, holding up his hands and hurrying away from her, and it’s not completely untrue.
Harry glances at Draco, anxiety only increasing when their fingers brush together for a fraction of a second. He takes a deep breath and forces himself to focus.
“I might be completely losing my marbles here, Harry, but aren’t we supposed to wait for the bride for this part?” Draco whispers, leaning close enough to make Harry’s skin heat.
Illness and injury do not take a holiday, but the bustling foyer of St Mungo’s is resisting that fact as hard as it can. Tinsel decks the walls and the ceiling, while every Floo point has been draped in flashing multicoloured lights, and nurses with glitter in their hair scurry back and forth to the sound of rousing Christmas carols.
“This doesn’t concern you,” Draco calls, scowling, and after a moment, the eye begins to retract out of sight.
Irritated, he drops back against his chair and releases the telescope. He wants to know where Potter is going, and even more than that, wants to know what has made him so angry. Draco hasn’t seen that expression of rage on his face since... well, since things were very different, and there is something unsettling about seeing it now. He picks up the Eye and trains it on the most distant part of Diagon Alley in his line of sight. There isn’t much up there of interest, only a few clothes shops, the Prophet offices, and, if he remembers correctly, a shop selling handmade furniture.
“This,” he says, voice louder than he wants it to be as he stands, grabs Ginny’s paper and holds it up. He points at the photograph. “This is true. This is real. This—” He stabs at the headline with one finger. “This is bullshit. Leave it alone. Leave Draco alone. I don’t know who did this, but... just... stop.”
“Juno…” Harry sighs, wincing when the heavy cat once more leaps onto his lap, ears twitching furiously.
Harry runs his hand savagely over the top of the nearest cage, creating a rough scraping sound that makes Draco cringe. “What happened? You’re telling me you don’t believe that Hermione attacked a reporter and photographer for no reason?”
Draco ignores the comments and looks at the pictures. Potter has a button missing on his coat. Potter’s jeans have a hole in them at the knee. Potter’s hair looks just how Potter’s hair has always looked, like he’s been ruffling his fingers through it without even noticing. Potter wears the same outfit twice in one week. This, according to the creator of the article, is the worst ‘style sin’ of all, and Draco can’t help the twinge of sympathy and irritation that passes through him.
He lets himself in at the back door. When Hermione sees the bunch of carrots, she beams and hugs him, treating him to a mouthful of hair and a wet spatula to the side of the face.
Puzzled, Luna turns to see what she has been looking at, but all she sees is Harry, leaning on George’s stall and gazing up at the sky. She squints in the darkness but she can’t see anything unusual.
When they start to sing, everyone falls silent. Esmee emerges first, radiant in sunshine yellow. She clutches her bouquet and holds her father’s arm as she walks, looking ageless and beautiful. Like Esmee, her father is tall, but the similarities end there. He is broad and almost as pale-skinned as Mr Borteg, with fine silvery hair that falls to his shoulders and a proud grin that seems to spread to everyone who sees it. Harry notices that she is wearing one of the amber earrings, and he wonders what happened to the other one until he sees Shan, approaching from the other direction on the arm of a delighted-looking Florean.
“Harry James?” Draco says as Harry sets the note aside to dry and tears out a fresh sheet of paper for the letter to McGonagall. “Fancy.”
Draco shakes his head. “No… she’s more like one of those Muggle devices with the wires and the scribbly bits. I’ve seen them on the television but I can’t remember their name.”
Draco’s fingers slide on the slick ceramic as Harry enters him and Harry encloses him in his arms, threading their hands together and dropping his mouth to Draco’s shoulder. The water pounds down around them, pummelling Harry’s aching muscles and collecting hot and sweet on his tongue as he moves in a frenzy of brand new energy, pulling his hand away from Draco’s to stroke him into incoherence.
Something about her reminds Harry sharply of McGonagall and he feels a twinge of guilt, knowing that she will inevitably, some time soon, realise they are missing, but then he remembers Trelawney and the Slytherins and the
“Harry, do we have to talk about this right now?” Draco asks, eyes flitting nervously around the kitchen.
Montague jumps into his lap and licks his hands until he allows them to relax. Slowly, he strokes the silky coat and lets his breath out in a messy rush. He looks around at them all, at their kind eyes and wrinkled faces and knows there are no words good enough.
Rose giggles as Ron produces a small ornament and passes it to Harry. He’s not quite sure what to say, but has to admit that the brief has been fulfilled. The ornament, carved from wood and sitting on a lacquered slice of log, seems to be an elf, at least the Muggle version of one, wearing a felt santa hat and crouching on a tiny toilet. His expression is caught between grimace and smirk, and the whole thing would be disturbing enough without a generous coating of glitter.
Harry glances at Draco, silently daring him to pick up Mr Borteg on his use of the word ‘robberies’. When he says nothing, Harry doesn’t know whether to be amused or disappointed.
“Your mother,” Harry mumbles, and then his conversation with Narcissa comes flooding back and indignation twists itself into the mess swishing around inside him. “Yes. I did speak to her.”
to drift away on intriguing little tangents, much less ignore anyone as wonderful as Professor McGonagall… it just happens.
“I think the right answer would be, ‘Neville, my love, I adore your Yorkshire accent and I would never swap you for a Frenchman’,” Luna says. She looks at Harry sharply. “Didn’t you bring Draco?”
He sits at the edge of his duck pond until the light has completely faded from the sky. His fingers turn cold and numb and he just tucks them underneath himself, ignoring his shivers and staring at the water. The ducks flock around him, curious at first, but eventually lose interest and retreat into clumps of rushes to settle for the night. They never really took to the fancy house he bought from Harry. It stands there, empty and overpriced and ridiculous in the moonlight and Draco scowls at it. It’s so clear now that all of this insanity has been an excuse to spend time with Harry, and he hates it.
“I’m not sure Watson ever wore a fez,” he says, pretending he doesn’t notice how pink his face looks.
Potter laughs, and the sound of it startles Draco. On the end of her harness, Brenda closes her mouth and swishes her tail over the wet cobbles.
“Of course,” says a pretty, dark-haired woman in a white apron. She comes to stand at the counter and smiles at all of them. “Hello, Needle, you’re looking very handsome today.”
“Lunchtime. At least,” Sam says, picking up a tin of sweets and banging it on the edge of his desk. “Order!”
Mr Fortuna touches his wand to his temple, and with a grunt, extracts a silvery strand of memory. He traps it in the vial and passes it to Harry.
That night, she Apparates into the long grasses and walks down to the stream. The light is fading for the day, leaving behind streaks of pink and gold that shimmer over the water. Mr Abernathy calls to her from a low branch and she calls back to him, imitating his greeting and hoping she hasn’t accidentally said something offensive.
“Fine,” he says, imitating her careless tone. “And you won’t think about Nipple-Eye not owling you back.”
Draco holds out a hand to pull him up and Harry takes it, leaving the worn softness of the chair behind and standing slowly. He doesn’t let go of Draco’s hand, and Draco doesn’t pull it away. Instead, they stare at each other in silence, Harry’s heart beating so loud in his chest that he thinks the biddies must be able to hear it over the sound of their card game.
“Dad likes music you can dance to,” Luna says, gently prodding Mr Abernathy away from the package when he appears from nowhere and starts to pull at the string.
“I bet Professor McGonagall will know what to do with you,” the girl says suddenly, and she tucks Stanley under her arm and starts walking.
After the best part of an hour, Draco finally stops the bus. Something about the glint in his eyes makes Harry wonder if he has deliberately chosen a circuitous route in order to prolong the suspense, but he decides to claim the higher ground by not mentioning it.
“Breathe,” he murmurs, and Harry exhales messily. Draco points at the shimmering spell. “What does this mean?”
It’s at least the fourth one so far, though Harry is beginning to lose count. Still, it’s fine, because George
“Well, yes, I did say that, but maybe that’s not what I really meant,” Draco hisses, turning now to meet his eyes.
The second goat is similarly intrigued by Harry’s offer of food and proceeds happily, if rather more slowly than the first, up to the barn. Buoyed with success, Harry opens the door and ushers her inside. He is just attempting a cautious pat to the goat’s warm, soft neck when Draco’s voice floats in from outside the barn.
“By whom,” Draco mumbles, and then covers his face with his hands. “I don’t know where that came from.”
Hot water is now pouring into the copper bath and Draco is peering out of the window, nakedness just about covered by the condensation.
Harry chews slowly and raises an eyebrow. “Oh, really?” he mumbles, and then covers a yawn with his hand.
A little bit of fear can be helpful—it can push a person to greatness—but Luna thinks both Harry and Draco have experienced quite a bit of both fear and greatness already. What they both need, at this point, is happiness, and she thinks she knows exactly what she needs to do.
Harry flings himself into a chair, fully expecting it to slide across the floor the moment the bus turns a corner. To his astonishment, though, he stays put, and so does all the rest of the furniture. Only the chandelier seems to be affected by the bus’s movement, swaying and clinking above their heads like a lamp in a hurricane.
“Tell her… tell her I think she’s beautiful as well,” says tiny Eliza, hauling herself up onto the nearby sofa with what looks like a massive effort.
Harry listens to the splutters and rasps of the engine, the uneven rhythm of Draco’s breathing and the tapping of his fingers on the wheel. There is a distinct discomfiture that connects the bus and its driver, and he can’t help wondering how much truth there is in Ida’s supposition that the two of them are magically linked. Of course, if that’s true, the question is: who started the cycle? Is Draco unsettled because the bus is unsettled, or did his presence here unnerve Draco, who in turn is causing the bus to misbehave?
“Isn’t Draco coming?” Molly asks, rattling a tin of roast potatoes. “I’ve done one for him as well. It’s got a cat as well as a bus.”
Unfortunately, his attempt at explaining as much just seems to make the ragged man crosser, and Stanley flees before the broom, clacky shoes echoing on the stone. He runs around the little room three times in panic before the door swings open and he scuttles to freedom. Out in the corridor, he runs until his legs are aching and the tinsel is slipping from his shell and tripping him up with every step. Finally, tired and feeling very sorry for himself, he tucks himself into the skirting under a wooden bench and crouches there, wondering if the tree has its sparkles yet and wishing he had never run away from home.
“If he’s biting my dress, he’s not biting my best pencil crayons,” Rose says, continuing to draw what looks a lot like a picture of Mr Borteg.
“Me neither,” Harry says, looking up from his notes. “I don’t see why we can’t have both things—make sure the thefts stop and try to find out who did it.”
“... garden’s a state, ye know... needs a firm hand... and there’s a hole in the roof that’s in dire need of some attention. Two strong lads like yourselves should no have a problem. I’ll make sure youse are fed, ye ken,” she says, regarding them shrewdly. “Proper hot meals at the Trout, none of your junky rubbish.”
“You’re listening to the breakfast show with Pansy Parkinson and... oh, here he is,” she says, looking up and eyeing him speculatively. “Draco has arrived at last...”
Puzzled but hopeful, she turns to see Sam, who is fixing her with a lovely crooked smile, and Mary Ann, now free of all traces of anxiety.
about today’s effort, and he has the feeling that his digestive system is going to be furious with him for the rest of the night.
“Yes, but I didn’t think the big ones…” Draco trails off as Otis enters the room, pushing Benny like a wheelbarrow.
By the time he wakes up on Tuesday morning, Harry’s blithe, go-with-the-flow attitude has deserted him completely. He lies flat on his back, breathing hard, sheets and insides in knots as the last threads of his dreams slither over him and pin him to the mattress.
“Show off,” adds Mrs Purley, but she is still smiling and she hasn’t yet taken her eyes from the glittering new stalls.
“I thought I ought to rescue you,” Draco says, ushering Needle out of the restaurant and closing the door behind them. “There seemed to be an atmosphere.”
By the time Harry breaks the silence, it’s become so comfortable that he almost doesn’t want to ruin it. But he does, because sitting next to someone without exchanging a word is all very well, but when it’s stretching into its second week, there’s a high potential for weirdness. Not that his and Draco Malfoy’s relationship has ever been particularly normal, but there’s a first time for everything, and besides, Harry is intrigued. Draco is quiet and fragile and oddly fierce, like a coiled snake, and yet here he is, arranging pebbles into gradients of colour by the light of a pale summer moon.
“Really, Harry? I’ve heard it’s marvellous. Count me in…. that’s if, er, what do you think, Molly, love?”
Following a ride in a floating chair and a short trip home on the Knight Bus, Ida is installed in her most comfortable armchair, with Montague on her lap and her friends fussing around her, delighted to have something to do at last. Eilish builds and charms an enormous fire in the grate, while Corrie arranges Ida’s pillows and blankets and Danica bustles around in the vast kitchen, putting together a tea tray for a table that plans to stay put.
“Only a couple of days a week and only if you want to,” Harry says, crossing his fingers under the table. “They just need somewhere to gossip and do their crafts and things, and they’d love it here. You can absolutely say no, I just thought it was worth asking.”
By the time he has finished and Draco has dropped off the last of the ladies at home, Harry is covered in animal hairs and quite ready for a good sit down on something that isn’t moving. He fishes out a vanilla slice from the patisserie box that is now almost empty and drops into his conductor’s seat to enjoy it. Ida has, at last, had her rose macaron, and she hadn’t seemed in the least disturbed that every bite had been watched at close range by a covetous Juno.
“I’m sorry I didn’t notice,” he says, stretching out one leg and resting his ankle against Draco’s. “You can be very… distracting. In a good way. And I think it’s brilliant. My own chair! Thank you.”
“I’m just saying,” Hermione insists. “I haven’t seen the two of you together in a long time and you seem very close.”
“And what part is that exactly? The ‘I do’ part? The food part? The part where we all sit around and watch the groom stepping on the bride’s foot for three excruciating minutes?”
“It will be easier when everyone just knows,” Harry sighs, gently pulling away and resting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Harry, it’s really good to meet you,” he says, and there’s just the slightest hint of a Scottish accent.
“As you know, we’ve been asking a lot of questions recently. We’ve also been looking at the scenes and the evidence and trying to fit it all together.” Harry looks at Shan and Esmee, back from their break and glowing with happiness, and he hesitates, heavy with the impact of what he is about to say.
“The front door, I think,” Jean says, scowling. “I put a better locking spell on it but those things have never been my strong point.” She brightens. “He didn’t get into my till, though, did he?”
Draco joins him at the door, slipping an arm around his waist. “My mother has gone to bed. She asked me to wish you goodnight.”
“No,” Harry says quickly and then stops. “You know what? Yeah, I’ll take Watson. He’s clever, he’s brave, he’s a doctor
“Yes, and Grace saw you waving as well. It was really nice,” Rose says happily. “Ooh, Uncle George!” she cries, eyes drifting over Harry’s shoulder and he relinquishes her.
“When I was their age, I would never have been able to say the word ‘tit’ without collapsing into giggles.”
Without another word, Phillippe pulls the toasties from the fire and expertly throws them into paper bags, which he hands to Draco before picking up his clipboard and disappearing into the pantry.
Harry sighs, heart sore. “Thank you so much, Eilish, and I’d love to come, but I’ve already promised my family.”
“It was just a bit of basic ballet, for heaven’s sake,” Draco mutters, but Harry has never been one to give in easily.
“Not to worry,” Harry says. “We like a mystery around here. Tell me what you know and we’ll find it.”
“Aha, the good luck has arrived,” Shan laughs. “Thanks, Harry. Now, leave everything on the counter and go away.”
“You’re right,” Draco says at last, trying to at least stand up straight. “They’re not mine, and I didn’t mean to put them on. I’m sure you’ve worked out that Professor Potter and I are…” He hesitates.
“I’ve lived in Strath Kinna for seventy-eight years,” she says, staring pointedly at each of them in turn until they pick up the towels and begin to rub obediently at their hair. “I see things. I’ve never seen either of youse before and there’s no good reason to come here unless youse are come to fish. We ken well enough there’s nothing to see here. And youse’ve no come to fish,” she finishes flatly.
“Please can I be your helper, Mr Fortescue?” she asks, holding on tightly to her unopened pencil case. “I love ice cream and if I get messy, my grandma knows all the cleaning spells.”
Ginny grins, silvery glimmer surging around her. “I’ll hold you to that. Hey... look at Slughorn and your dad!”
“Relationships between… people… are far from my area of expertise, Harry,” Mr Borteg says, offering him a fountain pen made from gleaming onyx. “In this case, however, I imagine that a conversation or two would benefit both parties.”
“No, sharks!” Caroline counters, crouching and holding both hands on top of her head in the shape of a pointed fin.
“Me neither,” Harry says with a snort. “From what I’ve heard, the teacher in charge is one of those ‘it’s not funny because I say so’ types.”
“That’s right,” Jean says, poking her head around the door, too. “No men allowed. Rose can come up if she wants to, but you can bugger off.”
Unlike most things that involve Harry, this process has been a slow one. She hadn’t noticed it at first, and she doesn’t think many of her colleagues really notice it now. They have always made a game of embarrassing Harry, ever since he started his Wednesday afternoons as part of his Healer training—partly because they just enjoy making people squirm and partly because with Harry, it’s just so easy. He might be brave and fearless and uninhibited when it comes to matters of life and death, but a simple word or two about matters personal and he blushes and fumbles and dissembles better than anyone Luna has ever met. Even Neville is more confident these days; he’s still a little on the shy side, but next to Harry, he’s practically Casanova.
“Harry... is this real?” Ginny whispers, and he loves her for trying to keep her voice down, but the Hall is now so silent that she might as well have yelled her question.
“She is a very unusual lady,” Draco says thoughtfully. After a moment, he shrugs and opens the basket. “Ooh, sausage rolls!”
“What are you doing?” Harry asks, but the ladies just grin at him, stepping behind the pillar one by one and apparently disappearing.
“I’ve seen loads of films since my dad got the tape machine,” Ginny says, flopping onto her back and gazing up at the sky. “He likes the ones where everyone is running around more than the ones with songs.”
“You know I would, but…” Sam stares at her, forehead furrowed and pale, weary glimmer brightening with something like interest… or possibly suspicion.
“What a load of rubbish,” the man says again. “All this African mumbo-jumbo, it’s not right. Does nobody else think it’s interesting that all these crimes started happening right after she got here?”
He doesn’t sound as though he believes Draco, and Draco doesn’t blame him, because ‘nothing is the matter’ is the biggest lie he has told in a long time. Something is very much the matter because he is pretty sure that somehow, he has fallen for Harry, and he has no idea what to do about it. It’s not his fault, he supposes; Harry is surprisingly easy to love. Startlingly easy, in fact. He is just as stubborn and unpredictable as Draco always knew, but he is also warm and funny and kind. He treats every strange creature in this strange place with equal respect and care, and Draco is certain that every last snake and beetle and rabbit and parrot adores him completely.
“I’d had the same thought,” he confides, emptying everything he can find into the box with a satisfying clink. “Let me know if there’s anything I can do.”
That sigh sits heavily in the very pit of his stomach, taking root there and seeming to stretch out soft, aching tendrils to wrap around his heart, spine, and thighs. Closing his eyes, Harry splays himself on the sheets in an indolent sprawl, arching his back and almost vibrating with a jittery blend of frustration and warm anticipation.
Draco straightens up and meets his eyes. “No, that was me, although you did mention swans at one point. I mean when you said... you said you loved me. Was that real or just... talking shit?”
“Neither did I,” Harry says, watching the now whispered exchange between the driver and the old man, after which Mr Barleycorn creaks off to bed.
“This is for the bus as well as you, I suppose,” Harry says, chewing anxiously on his lip as Draco unwraps his gift. “It’s a bit scratched. I tried all sorts of removal charms but it wouldn’t go. I got it from this dodgy-looking bloke on a market stall…” He pauses, scrubbing at his hair, but Draco is staring at the object with wide eyes. “Yeah, okay, I’m, not really selling it, am I? It’s just… when I saw it, I couldn’t resist.”
“Don’t say that, Caroline,” says Otis, looking scandalised as he often does. “Why don’t you want to go to Hogwarts?”
The other ladies laugh uproariously and it’s all Harry can do not to sink into his seat with hot, prickly embarrassment.
Stanley clicks and dangles nicely in her tight grip. He thinks he might be ready to go home, but he no longer has any idea where he is. The castle is big and so quiet at night, and without his friends, it’s hard to know which way to go.
“What’s happened to you?” she asks, looking so concerned that Stanley cycles his little legs in the air and tacks quietly to comfort her. “I should probably take you to Professor Malfoy, but… here’s a secret between me and you… I’m a bit frightened of him.”
“Something like that,” Pansy says, putting on a new record and reclaiming her chair. “Potter hasn’t got any parents to infuriate, though, has he?”
Draco opens his mouth to protest—at what, he’s not quite sure—but Potter is already stomping back down the street with his small-not-small crocodile in tow. He watches them until they are out of sight but he doesn’t follow. Instead, he rubs at his wet face with cold, numb hands and sighs before Apparating back to the Manor in search of warm, dry clothes and a distraction. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to matter what he tries, all he can think about is Potter and his stupid crocodile. He flops back onto his bed and stares at the ceiling, letting out all his breath in a messy rush. He knows when he’s beaten these days, and he’s more than that. He’s completely fucked.
“This is Needle, and he has had his breakfast,” Draco says. “He is sorry for trying to eat your wreath.”
She clicks off air and skitters a paper bag across the desk towards him. Draco opens it and draws out an apricot Danish. It’s his favourite breakfast treat, and the only way Pansy knows how to apologise.
Draco laughs. He leans beside Harry on the wall of the bridge. “I’m not sure where even to start with that,” he admits. “A man about town?”
Draco sighs and curls up, half beside him and half on top of him, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder.
Drowning in sensation, Harry forgets all about going slowly and pushes into Draco with abandon, leaning down to kiss him and almost losing control when Draco gasps and stares up at him and comes hotly between them with an urgent, rhythmic whisper of Harry’s name.
“Are you sure?” Draco asks, lifting an eyebrow and making Harry want to reach for him all over again.
“I’ll be with you in a moment!” he shouts, voice tinged with irritation, and Draco follows the sound behind the counter and into the back room, where he finds Harry crouching in front of a dilapidated old fireplace.
The dog wakes instantly and Harry holds his breath, waiting for some sort of horrible carnage to unfold, but the moment Montague lays eyes on the mouse, he lets out a terrified whimper and pelts out from under the table, tail down and ears flapping. Harry has never seen him move so quickly; within two seconds he is through the curtain with the mouse now in hot pursuit.
“Maybe I’ll get it out of them, then,” Harry says, allowing his eyes to stray to the back of the bus, where Audrey is now sitting in his chair and Eilish has set up an easel, upon which she seems to be painting a rather impressionistic picture of Juno.
The editor frowns. He glances at Draco as though he will have the sense to grab Harry and drag him out of the office, but Draco stays exactly where he is. Now that they’re here, now that they’ve got what they came for, he doesn’t see why Harry shouldn’t ask a few questions of his own, or at least enjoy himself a little bit. They owe him that much.
“Draco, I know what it’s like to want to have control over what people think of you,” Harry says. “You want to have things on your terms, I get it. But the thing is… it just doesn’t work like that, at least not around here. You have to learn to… I don’t know… give less of a shit.”
“It’s nine-thirty in the morning, of course I’m not,” Draco says, but he indicates the immaculate garment bag draped over the chair next to him. “I’ll be ready. By twelve o’clock. Not ten past,” he adds, quirking half a smile in Deb’s direction.
“I forgive you for being an idiot,” Draco says, and then they are leaning close, lips brushing, and then Harry is jerked backwards and almost falls off the bench.
Harry sighs, gulping his tea and pulling his feet up onto the chair in an attempt to make himself as small as possible. He watches the rain hammering against the window, feeling like a tiny island in the middle of the vast kitchen. He won’t be on his own for long, though. Bill, Neville, Ron, and Lee will have to drag themselves out of bed for work soon, and the others are unlikely to hang around for long after breakfast. Everyone has responsibilities, and no amount of Dragon Spirit will put off schedules and meetings and children.
“Right, well, thanks for that,” Harry mumbles, getting to his feet and heading for the door. Just before he opens it, curiosity snags him. “What is my true path, then?”
Draco stares at him, mouth slightly open, and Harry wonders if he’s finally lost for words. When the grey eyes shift somewhere to Harry’s right, though, he turns, and isn’t as surprised as he thinks he should be to see the brass eye hovering on its long stalk and rising up through the stairwell.
Draco is leaning against his favourite bit of counter, holding bits of greenery out for Needle, who stretches to grab them. When he sees Harry, he smiles easily and turns to address a harassed-looking man with a clipboard.
Harry turns to look at him and is immediately caught by the way his hair gleams almost golden in the lamplight. Shivering, he finally finds his voice.
“Here I am,” she says, smiling back, and his glimmer soars. She holds out the button stolen from him by Mr Abernathy. “Is this yours?”
He hands it to Draco and lets the smile out. Draco stares at him, and then at the swan. For the briefest moment Harry can see the pure panic etched across his face, and then the Malfoy shutters come down and Draco nods.
“That’s hardly fair,” Harry protests, but Draco seizes him by the shoulders and propels him up the street with surprising strength.
Harry smiles. The night is cold but clear, and he stares up at the sky for so long that he almost falls over his own feet. At the water’s edge, he sits on the large rock and tips his head back, drinking in black velvet littered with millions of stars.
Harry is in no mood to rush, and by the time he steps back from the finished project, the sun is beginning to rise. He rubs at the patches of skin where the tree has scratched him, dusts glitter from his hands, and surveys his work. It’s a little chaotic, but he wouldn’t really want it any other way. Satisfied, he goes to the kitchen, picks up the kettle and puts it back down. Tea’s no good for this job, he thinks, instead rummaging through his cupboards for cocoa, milk, and a whisk.
Potter shakes his head and sweeps past him into the next aisle. “Right. Let me know if I can help you with something.”
“Everyone, this is Derek,” he says to the other ducks that night as they crowd around the newcomer. “Derek, this is... everyone. Please play nicely.”
He takes one from the plate, biting into it and showering his jumper with crumbs. The biscuit is short and buttery with orange peel, chunks of cranberry and a mix of spices that is, Ida has assured him, completely top secret.
She follows him to the staff room, watching his glimmer with satisfaction. Today is a good day, she thinks; the light around him is soft and gentle but steady, reflecting the sort of calm that has only been possible in recent months. Inside the office, they sink into scuffed but comfortable armchairs with steaming hot coffee and discuss the afternoon ahead.
“That looked like fun,” Harry says eventually, stowing his ball of robes on the counter and stuffing his hands into his pockets.
For what could be a long time or no time at all, they lie tangled, caught up in slow, maddening kisses, each brush of lips settling in the pit of Harry’s stomach and leaving him breathless with need. When he can’t take another second, he pushes Draco onto his back, slipping his leather braces from his shoulder and unbuttoning his shirt with numb, clumsy fingers. Draco’s skin is pale and beautiful in the soft blue light, and he stares up into Harry, helping him to shrug the shirt onto the floor. He reaches up to draw Harry back into the kiss, closing his eyes when Harry traces the shape of the faded mark with his fingertips.
“All sorts,” the woman says. “Mainly gospel stuff and a few Christmas songs. That’s what they’ve asked for. Oh! You know them, don’t you? Are you going up there now?”
“They’ll be in the antique shops,” Draco says, unconcerned. “And the charity shops, and the pet shop. Essentially, they will be buying things they don’t need.”
“This is horrible, but at least there will be no more stealing,” Daraja says, allowing the snake to flick his tongue over her hand and then returning to her task of cleaning beetles, dunking each one in water and then drying them with her wand.
“So, you’ll probably think I’m mad, but I wrote to her,” Ginny says, tucking her feet up underneath herself and fiddling with the stem of her glass.
Harry flashes her a grateful smile and dumps his purchases on the counter. He begins another loop of the shop, picking up boxes and putting them back down. On the last shelf by the door, he spots a shiny red object and picks it up. There’s a slot for coins and an empty glass-fronted section.
It’s all very well trying to make her friends happy, but maybe it will be best in future to leave their romantic lives well alone. Her stomach twists guiltily. It’s possible, of course, that it won’t be too late for Harry and Draco. She might not yet have ruined everything; she’ll just have to wait and see. In the meantime, she can go home, make sure her father eats something and write a letter to Ron about his peanut butter biscuits.
“He does,” Ginny agrees, smiling. “Hermione says Angie’s so nervous she looks like she’s going to be sick.”
“You’ve done an incredible job,” he says, reaching for Draco’s hand and threading their fingers together. “All of you.”
“Be thankful it’s not a great tit,” Corrie says loudly, and in the row in front of them, several people giggle.
Draco stares at the strange object and then at Harry, eyes wild. “Why is everyone here obsessed with fucking fish?!”
“Indeed. I’m afraid I sleep rather heavily. I had no idea that anything was wrong until Draco started pounding at my door and telling me that… how did he put it? Ah, yes. My window ‘didn’t look right.’”
“I think he might have been dead quite a while by then,” Hermione says, but she writes it down anyway.
“It will be if you don’t eat properly,” she says darkly, looking oddly lost as she sends the little containers back to their places and stares at him, hands on hips.
“Yeah,” he says after a moment, attempting nonchalance and almost falling through someone’s hedge. “I meant to do that.”
To her delight, Draco’s impromptu performance is the number one subject of conversation in the home for the rest of the day. Despite both Harry and Luna being sworn to secrecy, the news passes around the children like a case of dragon pox, catching up those who had not been lucky enough to witness the event in person and looping back around those that had, so many excitable times that when it finally reaches the office, it has made somewhat of a departure from the truth.
Harry smiles but says nothing, suspecting they are motivated at least as strongly by the urge to mother as they are by their concern for Draco and their own curiosity.
“I couldn’t have kept it from her if I tried. We had a long talk and it ended with me on one knee,” Shan says. “Well, it ended with me resting up on the sofa with a salve on my knee because I’d gone down on the dodgy one, but that’s just the old woman bit of the story.”
Perhaps it’s like her mother’s fear of tubeworms, and the therapist she had seen, who had made her sit in a bathtub full of them until she couldn’t scream any more. At the time, Luna hadn’t thought it a very nice thing to do, but it had worked. And yes, her friends’ feelings are a lot more complicated than a straightforward, primal sort of terror, but she imagines that the logic is sound all the same.
Luna waits, because she knows, and so does Sam, who shoots her a glance that clearly conveys the message, ‘don’t say a word’. She mimes pulling a zip across her mouth and he does the same, but it doesn’t matter, because a split second later, Draco’s glimmer is sputtering and his fingers are gripping the sheet of paper a little too tight.
“I’m going to take him home and measure him and then set him free in the back garden,” Rose says. “But I probably won’t tell Daddy until I’ve already done it.”
By the time the NEWT results are posted, they are back in Strath Kinna. Two weeks of odd jobs, excellent chips and perfect peace lie ahead of them before they have promised to meet Ron and Hermione at the Burrow, and Draco is doing an almost faultless job of pretending he is not at all anxious about the prospect. When two large Hogwarts owls swoop down to the water’s edge, he leaps to his feet, leaving Harry stretched out in the sunshine by himself.
“Here’s where we’re going to be in case you need us,” Hermione says, shoving a leaflet into Harry’s hands and rummaging through her handbag. “Rose, are you ready?”
Mr Abernathy pokes his beak into the spine of her book and she looks up, startled to realise that the sky is almost completely dark. Out here the stars are clearly visible and she tips back her head, scanning for the constellations and naming them out loud. Finally, she tucks her notebook away and heads for the house. It isn’t until halfway through dinner that she realises she has forgotten all about her plans for Harry and Draco.
“I don’t think any of these are mine,” Reuben says, frowning. “I definitely didn’t have any fancy ribbons like those.”
Something about the man’s earnest expression tickles Harry and he has to turn away for a moment. Behind the bar, Tom is grinning like a loon and not helping one bit.
They stop outside the restaurant and Draco pulls gently at the ivy that spills around both windows and climbs all the way up to the gutters in a glossy green blanket.
“You could wear some of these,” Ron says, lifting his foot to show off a woolly pair of red and white argyles. With a grin, he presses the topmost stripe and the socks begin to emit an off-kilter rendition of ‘White Christmas’.
“That’s right,” Felicity says, smiling properly now. “There’s nothing newer than a flower that’s just opened, and these are a brand new variety of winter rose. I bred them myself.”
As it turns out, things have only just begun. By Sunday, Draco has been sent to Coventry by the entirety of Slytherin house. Not only are his housemates refusing to speak to him, but they have begun pretending that he doesn’t exist. At mealtimes, they cluster around one end of the table so that Draco sits alone, a one-man island in a sea of polished oak. Harry thinks he might invite him to sit at the Gryffindor table if he didn’t think that the hostility level would be just as high. His own housemates do not tend towards passive aggression as the Slytherins do, but overt rage, and, on balance, he thinks Draco is better off where he is.
“Aren’t you odd?” Draco murmurs. He picks up his cup of tea from the dashboard and sips it thoughtfully.
“I didn’t realise the bus had its own magic,” Harry says, scanning Corrie’s patchwork and Eilish’s dusky pink velvet. Each of the chairs seems to fit its owner perfectly in everything from size to style and individual fabric.
Impulsively, she turns on the spot and Disapparates, landing on the pavement outside Harry’s tall, beautiful old house. Ginny says she thinks the place is creepy, even though Harry has cleaned it up and purged it of dark magic, but Luna likes it. It’s the sort of place where she imagines the most wonderful stories to take place. She runs up the steps and knocks loudly on the door.
“Or you are,” Mary Ann says, nudging him with her elbow. “It’s for the kids. They’re going to love it. It doesn’t matter if we make idiots of ourselves.”
“I’m offended because I dislike the idea of my purpose in life being reduced to ‘funny wireless man’,” he says irritably.
His sadness at leaving behind the loch and the cabin turn to anxiety as they slip the key through the letterbox of the pub, along with a short thank you note and promise to return, and head for the quiet wooded area they have chosen for Disapparation. For leaving behind this little bit of stillness and leaping back into the real world—their real world—where everything is noisy and messy and complicated.
Draco’s eyes slide down the street to Jennings’ Quills, where the windows are still thick with soot.
“Barnsley Boulderstone,” he says, stepping into the snow just as the rushed protective charms on his boots begin to wear off. He grimaces. “Twenty-five. Liked to wear a kilt… in fact, often wore nothing
Realising that he is blocking the shelves, he walks slowly around the shop, inspecting beautifully boxed chocolates, shiny bags of treats for children’s Christmas stockings, and a collection of hand-moulded animals so realistic that he almost expects them to move. On the next shelf over, he finds a range of treats that do move. They are new, and he spends several minutes poking them with his wand as instructed by the neatly-written sign and watching cogs spin and gears click. It seems almost impossible that any of it can be made of chocolate, or that anyone could bear to eat it.
, he seems to say, flapping his tail for good measure and then retreating into the depths, his sheer bulk creating an underwater wave that causes Harry to hop from one foot to the other.
That being said, Draco isn’t here now, and the morning ahead is looking very solitary indeed. He’ll spend his Saturday alone, perhaps in Diagon Alley or cleaning the basement or swooping around on the Yorkshire moors on a broomstick, and he’s not looking forward to it at all. He thinks he’s supposed to be thrilled for a chance to do his own thing, to plan his day however he wants, but the trouble is, that’s what he does every Saturday already, and he does it with Draco, and none of it will be the same without the arch commentary on everything they do, the fierce kisses stolen for no reason at all, the little smiles over mugs and the warm, familiar body stretched out at his side.
In the end, there had been too many of them to count, the castle and lawns a dizzying mass of vivid, angry colours and then sickening wisps of milky light, swirling out from every corner of the grounds. Once or twice she had managed to throw herself at a friend or ally, knocking them to the ground and restoring their colours to bright, fighting red or green or orange. More often, her split-second advantage had simply not been enough, and the fall came anyway.
Harry laughs. He can’t help it. Around him, his family continue to discuss his need for a young man, nice or otherwise, who is classy and respects his mother. Resignedly, he eats his roast potatoes and pretends he can’t hear them.
Harry wraps his hand around Draco’s bare ankle and strokes his skin, deciding not to point out the fact that
“You know, if you tell me what you’re up to, I’ll probably leave you alone,” Draco says when he finds himself in the way of Potter’s broom for the third time in as many minutes.
“Don’t ask,” Harry advises, and William says no more on the subject, but he is still grinning when they reach the farm.
Just at that moment, he meets Draco’s eyes. He grins, and Harry immediately feels the flush creeping up the back of his neck.
Draco shrugs. “I like it here. I like to sit here and enjoy the atmosphere and just be. I’m not the only one—haven’t you noticed how quiet everyone is?”
“These are just from this morning. You’ll have to forgive the handwriting, it’s bad enough when he’s not being over-caffeinated.”
“Yeah… yeah, okay,” he sighs. “I don’t even know what he’s doing in there, that’s the problem. He’s gone all quiet and it’s just weird. Plus, we’re supposed to be interviewing people together and I suppose I just thought he might have a bit more urgency about him.”
Just ahead is the sprawling patch of grassy land where George and Angelina will be married in three days’ time. The marquee lies folded flat in a halo of protective magic, and beside it, stacks and stacks of wooden chairs that he knows Ron is planning to turn orange. Amused, Harry turns back to the house, wondering what Molly is up to with the wedding so close.
“This stays off for the rest of the day,” he says, and even the small smile on his face does not stop the children from nodding solemnly.
“He was having his flat cleansed,” Ron says, folding his arms. “There was a spirit trapped in the… you know all of this already. Anyway, I thought you liked Avi.”
Danica whips a spell at the closed curtain and fixes him with a motherly eye. “Just a bit of a silencer. He doesn’t need to know that we’re talking about him.”
“Did she tell you to tell me that part?” Harry asks, unable to decide if he’s amused or exasperated.
“It really is lovely,” he says, already fighting disappointment. “Mrs Malfoy really wants to meet you properly, and Draco says—”
“Oddly enough, I have. Shan asked me for something old… I told her she was barking up the wrong tree, being that I’m eternally youthful, but she insisted,” George says. “And then I remembered I found these Knuts in the cellar. They don’t make them like this any more, look—they’ve got little dragons on them.”
There is a mumble of satisfaction from the group, and, without a word, they move as one to surround the chair by the fire, leaning this way and that to allow Horace to make his way through. He sits with care, tucking his outer robe around himself fastidiously, and then looks up at Luna with a silent question.
“This one does work. My daughter got it for me,” Mary Ann says proudly. “I don’t know who she thinks I’m going to bring up but it’s very nice…”
“You look lovely,” he promises, and she seems to glow with pride as she looks around at her dining companions.
“There you are,” Draco says, stepping out into the courtyard with a cup of coffee and a persistent little frown between his eyebrows. “Are you alright? You dashed out of the office like something was chasing you.”
“I’m not a bird, I’m a bat,” she tells him, flapping her fabric wings and dropping her lunchbox on the pavement.
“He’s a swan,” Draco says quietly, and when Harry looks at him, his expression is caught somewhere between amusement and despair.
“The girls will be so pleased that you two have worked things out,” Danica says loudly, reminding Harry of her presence and ensuring that he suddenly feels more awkward than he is really able to cope with at this time in the morning.
Of course, it’s entirely possible that Draco isn’t fine, his mind offers, taking his moment of relaxation and twisting it out of shape. Perhaps he isn’t fine at all. Perhaps he’s hurt, lost in an endless desert with no shelter and nothing but swirling sands all around him. Perhaps he’s been attacked by travellers, seeing the Gringotts insignia on his luggage and taking their chances. Perhaps… Harry screws his eyes tightly closed, fighting the tide of images but finding his exhausted mind no match for its own horrors.
“Upstairs,” Eilish says, pointing. “He knew it was only you, so he went up to fetch some string for us.”
Horrified with himself, he nods to Potter and walks out into the sunshine.  Five minutes later, he’s back at the Manor, sitting out on his favourite balcony with a decent cup of coffee and wondering exactly what possessed him to do... well, any of that. He should probably just blame Potter. There’s something about him that makes Draco forget to be cautious. There always has been. But that’s not important. What’s important is that he won’t be doing it again, and what’s even more important is that Pansy does not hear about it. Ever.
As the lights fade in and out, dappling the ice with beautiful blurred colours, they glide together in a dance that fills Harry with fresh, cold life and sweeps him clean of everything but
“It seems so fucking obvious now,” he sighs. “All this time, we’ve been looking for a stranger. We’ve asked people to pass on information about suspicious people. People who stand out. And who did they see? No one. Why? Because there was no one unusual. Just the people they expected to see. The people they see every day.”
“Good morning,” he says, smiling at Rose and then drawing close to the counter. “I don’t suppose,” he continues, dropping his voice to the barest mumble, “you’ve had a chance to look at those notes yet?”
He wakes to a dark sky and a room softly illuminated by the lights on his Christmas tree. Feeling restored, he checks the time and then runs himself a bath, stretching out in the hot, fragrant water and scrubbing at his nails with a brush until even Draco couldn’t find fault with them. Conscious of Molly’s worries about formal dress, he avoids his sparse collection of smart clothes and chooses plain dark trousers and a fine-knit red sweater without any holes. He puts on his coat and gazes at his reflection with vague dissatisfaction. His hair is waving and spiking all over the place and he’s never going to look stylish, but maybe it doesn’t matter. Maybe Draco can take care of that end of things and he can… well, he can do something, he tells himself, forcing himself out into the cold night before he can think himself into a corner.
“Harry, that’s exactly what he wants you to think,” Seamus argues, gesturing with his fork. “Isn’t that right?” he says, nudging Dean.
Heart thudding, Harry kisses him slowly, tasting the salt on his skin and stroking his hair back from his eyes. He’s still hard, still aching, still deep inside Draco, but he doesn’t move.
“I think it’s time for everyone to clean themselves up and get some rest,” Florean says. “That means you, too, Harry.”
“That sounds sensible,” Harry says, feeling a pang of loss as they part and he slumps into his conductor’s chair. As Ida’s house fades from view, he finds himself wondering about Christmas with Draco and the biddies and just what he might be missing out on. “I’m sorry I won’t be there tomorrow,” he says at last.
Five minutes later, Harry leaves Cherish with several bags, the heaviest containing a chocolate-dispensing money box stuffed to the brim with crackleballs. Realising that he is absolutely ravenous, he starts to walk back down to the market and then stops, remembering Phillippe’s cheese toasties. He hesitates, letting the snowflakes settle on his skin and coat. There’s every chance that Narcissa will be there and he doesn’t think he is her favourite person right now… but then again…
“I’ll leave her here, then—I can tie her up next to your desk,” Harry says, and Draco’s heart races at the sound of his voice.
“I saw Harry Potter buy two bottles of wine yesterday,” Harry reads. “I did, but I split them with Ron and Hermione. If you ask me, his recent behaviour is a result of... something alcoholism.”
“I need the green ones to go with my jumper,” Rose protests, but Hermione, lost in a whirl of organisation, doesn’t seem to hear her.
“Fine,” Draco sighs as if Harry has spoken. “I’ll admit it. I may have been wrong about this place.”
, Harry thinks, but he doesn’t say so. “So you all… come and ride on the bus and Draco just drives you around?”
Despite his best efforts to push the lot of it away, he barely tastes his breakfast and manages to wash his hair three times in a row before he realises that once probably would have been enough. Irritated, he brushes his teeth with more vigour than necessary and throws on the first jumper and pair of jeans he sees without bothering to dry himself. Finally, with very clean hair, sore gums and an all-over feeling of damp discomfort, he stands in the middle of his bedroom, folds his arms, and scowls.
“Florean, you’re a clever man,” he mumbles to himself, fishing out some coins to throw into the nearest donation tin.
She kisses Hugo and buttons herself into a red wool coat that clashes brilliantly with Ron and Rose’s hair. With one last look around the kitchen, she slings her bag onto her shoulder and nods to her family.
He has just squeezed into his seat beside Draco and accidentally-on-purpose let their cold fingers fall together in the gap between their chairs when Hermione is turning and gesturing for him to come over. Glancing at the clock, he hurries to the front and crouches beside Hermione’s seat.
Draco sighs. “So, what is it you do?” he mumbles, tapping his fingers on the wheel. “Let me guess. Do you… run the Ministry? No… still too young. Are you an Auror?” Draco glances at him, eyes narrowed. “No. What about some extremely impressive… charity work?”
Draco smiles at the steering wheel and pulls away from the kerb, taking it slowly for several seconds before putting his foot down and sending the bus whizzing along the quiet streets at breakneck pace.
He tips his head back and lets out a long, rough cry, shuddering at the feeling of Draco’s hot mouth against his neck as he jerks and spills, hot and needy over Draco’s fingers. For long seconds, he keeps moving, fist slicked with Harry’s release, keeping up a slow, teasing rhythm until Harry’s body begins to tremble.
“Really, Juno?” Draco sighs, glancing at them crossly before turning back to the road. “Potter, now that you’ve quite finished showing me up, is there somewhere I can drop you off? It’s not that I’m not thrilled to have you on board and it’s not that I’m not dying to hear more of your fascinating stories, but I have real passengers to transport and I haven’t had a single Knut out of you.”
He opens his mouth to speak and finds that not only has it turned completely dry, but that he has forgotten everything he wanted to say.
“Hermione, it’s freezing out here,” he complains, immediately starting to shiver, but she just indicates for him to keep walking.
Draco watches wearily as the beetle knocks over an open ink pot, sending dark green ink flowing in spidery tributaries all over a stack of empty parchments.
“Erm… I think perhaps I should go,” Marius says, and they all whip around to see him standing awkwardly on the patio.
“It was very nice of you to stay with her, George,” Molly says, patting him on the shoulder. “I’m sorry I shouted at you.”
“There we go,” Sophie shouts, jumping down from the top of Daraja’s stall and tucking her wand into her waistband. “Lights are on and Mr Jennings can go and screw himself.”
“Right,” he says after a minute or two of uncomfortably charged silence. “Let’s do something about this.”
“Okay,” Harry says, knowing he should stay and brazen it out but wanting nothing more than to run away before he explodes from the intensity of her attention.
Harry shoots her a dark look but continues to flounder, crossing his arms and looking, with his hair everywhere and his eyes on the ground, a lot like a sullen teenager. Draco, meanwhile, watches him covertly from his chair, colours pulsing rapidly.
falls out. Puzzled, Harry bends over and picks it up, and several more drop to the floor, followed by a cascade of others. By the time the compartment seems to be empty, Harry is ankle deep in newspapers and Draco is standing at the doors, coated in grime and glitter and wearing an expression of utter horror.
He crunches Molly’s crisp, herby roast potatoes and nods while Hermione tells him an MLE story that he doesn’t understand but is happy to hear nonetheless. When Arthur offers him a glass of sherry, he drinks it and then remembers, just like he does every year, that it tastes disgusting. He wears his paper cracker hat and spends the best part of an hour trying to guess which famous person’s name Fred has written on it during the lull between turkey and pudding. Percy grills him at length about his Irish campaign and all the while, his mind is helpfully flashing images of Draco on an endless loop; kisses on frozen riverbanks, pale limbs stretched out and trembling, a real smile in a haze of scented steam.
Draco glances at his omnivox to see that it is in fact turned on and that everyone listening to the WWN is sharing in his aggravation.
“Nobody is bringing any beetles onto this bus,” Draco says, raising his voice above the increasingly noisy protestations of the engine.
“Well, that’s what I told her,” Ron says airily, scratching at his nose and doing an excellent job at letting Harry know that he’s lying through his teeth. “You know ’Mione, though… she enjoys it.”
Halfway through a messy sort of spin, the magic relaxes its grip on Harry and he stumbles, arms flailing, until he ends up on his backside, flushed and breathing hard.
“Bye, Stanley,” they call after him several minutes later when he clatters out of the Great Hall and into yet another corridor.
The corridor is cold and empty and the windows are dark, but elsewhere in the castle there are fires and lights and adventures. He takes the stone floor at a scuttle, throwing himself up the stairs with the joy of exploration and, when he tumbles to the bottom, simply starting again until he makes it to the top.
He wouldn’t say so in as many words to Draco, but he thinks they are becoming friends of a sort, and in that moment the realisation is so surprising that he fails to notice Fred and George emerging from behind the curtain in their formal robes.
“That’s meaningless! Ridiculous!” he insists, leaning away from Needle. “That bloody thing hisses all the time!”
“Ah, that’s just convention!” Fred says. He slings an arm around George and grins. “Blood is thicker than… um… is it still water if you’re married?”
Draco shrugs, rising from his crouch and standing unsteadily on his skates. He has chosen black, and looks so perfectly coordinated that Harry feels sure he will be just fine on the ice.
“HAPPY BIRTHDAY, LUNA!” she yells, sending a ripple of laughter around the assembled group. “SORRY I COUDLN’T BE AT YOUR PARTY, BUT ME AND THE KIDS ARE MAKING YOU A CAKE THIS EVENING. I’M SURE IT’S GOING TO BE INTERESTING! HAVE A WONDERFUL EVENING, YOU DESERVE IT, AND—HEY, WHO THREW THAT? I THINK THERE’S A PIECE OF CAULIFLOWER DOWN MY SHIRT... SORRY, LUNA... ENJOY YOURSELF! SAVE ME SOME CAKE! LOTS OF LOVE, DEB.”
The bus, having behaved nicely for over a week, is becoming fractious again. The engine is running smoothly but the internal systems and fixtures are going haywire: the chandelier is spinning like a glittery, clanking top above the heads of the biddies, the steering wheel is flashing hot and cold in Draco’s hands, and fruit is being flung out of every secret compartment.
“I’ve seen weirder things,” Ron says, shrugging. “I’ve seen you doing weirder things. Remember that time you, me, Hermione and that Ferdinand bloke went to—”
Oscar Fortuna is definitely a rather eccentric man. It takes them several minutes to persuade him to answer the door, and when he does, he brandishes his wand and refuses to let them take one step over the threshold. He is a large man, towering over Harry and Draco, and even dressed in what appears to be his bathrobe, he is a vast, intimidating presence. The moment Harry begins to talk about the reporters, however, he pockets his wand and nods along sternly.
“Right, morning schedules, everyone,” he says, raising his voice to ensure their attention. “This meeting of the eclipse pyjama party committee has been postponed.”
Inside, they find Florean buffing at his marble counter while keeping half an eye on his customers. When he sees Harry, Draco and Timothy, he smiles, turning serious when he notices their grim expressions.
“I know,” Hermione says, picking up the bowl of cheese and hugging it to her chest. “It’s just that when you do something like that I feel all…” She shrugs wordlessly.
Gertie lets out a cackle and startles Harry by ruffling his hair. “The gardening tools are in the big chest near the trees,” she says. “Do a good job and I’ll bring youse some lunch.”
“Yes, Draco,” Harry says calmly. He sets Stanley on the carpet and prods him gently with his foot in the direction of the table. “Why don’t you go and help?”
“Back for more crackleballs already?” Shan laughs, and it takes Harry a moment to realise that Draco has wandered into the shop without him.
“Please can you measure him in centimetres as well as inches?” she asks, fishing a tiny notebook and pencil from the front pocket of her dungarees.
He has a pretty good idea already, but just in case, he summons an atlas from the bookshelf. It lands on the hearthrug with a thump and he flicks through the pages until he finds it, and there it is, a small country in the north-east of Africa. Thousands of miles away from London, from the chaotic route of the Knight Bus, and from Draco.
“It isn’t,” Harry says fiercely. “I said it because I was mad with you but I actually think what you do is pretty amazing.”
Cold to the bone, they trudge up to the top deck and fill the copper bath with water so hot that it turns their skin pink. In a haze of delicious-smelling steam, they trade lazy kisses and slow strokes until, finally returned to a comfortable temperature, they retreat to the bed, splashing footprints on the floor and flinging big white towels over the bedclothes.
“We should probably keep it quiet—no one seems to have noticed it yet, and if they don’t, Draco might be able to move it before it bites someone,” he says in a whisper.
Harry smiles sleepily, letting his eyes drift around the room. They settle on the door to the living room and he freezes.
Unfortunately, Trelawney appears to be feeling uncharacteristically tenacious, and just before lunch on Monday, she catches him in the Entrance Hall, swooping out from behind a suit of armour and seizing his wrist in her jewel-decked hand.
“Stills, Harry,” Mr Borteg says, almost in a whisper. “The character of the spirit is a mere hostage to the decision of a quarter of an inch this way or that.”
He can’t say he minds, though, when Pansy breezes into the studio in her beautiful evening clothes, earrings sparkling and lips painted blood red, bearing shiny little bags containing artisan chocolates or tiny bottles of champagne. He also tends to get first refusal of anything she determines to be a ‘gentleman’s item’, and as such, hasn’t paid for cologne or cufflinks in months.
Feeling rather exposed, he throws caution to the wind and dashes into the loch, gasping when the cold water hits his skin and forcing himself to keep wading until he is up to his shoulders.
“Well, that’s the best idea I’ve heard all day,” she says, and before anyone can reply, she is stumping off across the beach in the direction of the steps.
“I’ll adapt,” he says, leaning against Harry for a moment and then getting to his feet. “Would anyone like a ride?”
“He’s French,” Draco sighs, and then glances at Harry. “But that’s not what you really want to ask, is it?”
As the comforting smells of roasted meat, herbs, and gravy fill the kitchen, the family mills around happily, sharing news over hot cups, helping where they are permitted, and searching out bits of gossip for trade. Harry doesn’t like the way Ron, Hermione and George keep looking over at him and then whispering, so he does the mature thing and pretends they aren’t there. He sits at the table beside Rose, who is beavering away at some extra work for her maths club, which Hermione proudly tells him is completely her own choice. Like mother, like daughter, Harry supposes. Then again, he has watched Rose work many a time with her tongue poking out of the corner of her mouth, just like Ron when he’s filling in forms.
“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Harry assures, just as the back door swings open and Ginny hurries inside.
Without looking away from his eyes, Draco draws his wand and sends the window flying open on its hinges. Harry jumps slightly at the sound but sags in relief when cool air spills into the bedroom and skates over his irritated skin.
“We’d better be off,” Harry says, ushering Rose out of the pub before Tom can ask him about the most recent crimes.
, he thinks, picturing the sweeping lettering that adorns next door’s glossy red awning, proudly announcing their most famous and delicious creation.
When Mr Jennings walks in, followed by Sophie, Needle hisses loudly and Draco feeds him a grassy treat under the table. He sits down with his horrible toffee-tomato sundae and looks around with such calm curiosity that Harry wants to get up and tip the cold slimy mess over his head. Fortunately, Florean takes that moment to tap his long spoon against his knickerbocker glory and call the meeting to order.
Potter stares at him for a moment, and then: “If you must know, they’re busy. They have lives, Draco. Ron spends almost all of his time at the Ministry and Hermione is taking care of their child and trying to run her own business at the same time. Rose is driving them mad because she’s dying to start school and she doesn’t want to wait until September, she also has chicken pox, and for some reason, they are trying to have another baby.”
Amused, Harry lifts the tablecloth, and sure enough, there is Juno, curled around Ida’s legs and gazing up at him calmly with serene green eyes.
Mr Borteg leads a small round of applause and Needle, roused by the sound, gets up and rushes straight for Rose’s shoelaces. Beaming, she strokes his feathers and his naughty little head.
This is not Harry’s first visit, but Felicity’s shop is a little different every time, and there is always something new to see. As Draco shows her the fabric sample, Harry boots Needle gently away from a tub of ornamental grasses and jumps when something snakes over his shoulder and taps him on the nose.
“I was very upset until I realised that all my owls were alright,” Jean says. “Besides, they did take something—all those lovely presents for the kiddies and all the ornaments I had left, apart from the ones they smashed, the horrible buggers.”
“It’s very unsociable to have it closed two days in a row,” Danica says briskly, and before Harry knows what’s happening, she is pulling at his arm and propelling him towards the rest of the group. She is, he notices with resignation, at least three inches taller than him and doesn’t seem to have any problem pulling out a chair and pushing him into it.
When the doors open at last, he is startled to hear the sound of laughter and the clinking of ceramic emanating from within. He cannot see through the steamed-up windows to identify the source of the sound, but the bus is definitely not empty. When he leans in slightly, he is hit by a waft of heat and a drifting scent of roses, and he almost forgets about the driver until he clears his throat and speaks.
In a magically-created alcove sits an enormous copper bathtub that seems to glow in the soft light from a single, hanging gas lamp, and above it, a shelf stocked with potions every colour of the rainbow draws Harry’s eyes effortlessly.
“You really thought that making your shop bigger would fix everything?” Reuben says. “If a business is struggling, the last thing you need do is expand.”
“I’m going to go and get you another drink,” Ron says, picking up their empty glasses. “Whatever it is you’re thinking about, stop it. Your only job is to guess the weight of the swan… which would be a very interesting stall at the village fete.”
“Where do you think I got the idea?” Draco says, mouth twitching as he takes the coin back and drops it into his pocket.
what you said,” he mumbles, setting his spoon down in apparent triumph. “You said ‘I like this snake, let’s put it through the car wash.’”
“Well, let them look,” he says eventually. He rests his head against Harry’s, breathing in the warm scent of his hair. “What you have to realise is that these people are mad.”
“There’s been another one,” Esmee says, leaning on the display cabinet and picking at her patterned sleeve. “The Apothecary.”
He can’t ignore this feeling for another second, and when Draco looks up and smiles at him, it’s all he can do to hold back an ill-advised confession.
Luna frowns, puzzled. “At the home, of course. Otherwise the children won’t be able to laugh at us, and I think that’s sort of the point.”
Harry stares at her, stomach tipping. “He… but he bought those from me. He was looking for the perfect whisky. I don’t understand.”
“Needle, come here,” Draco mutters, waving a bunch of his favourite grass until he grabs it and settles down at their feet.
The editor inclines his head, laces his fingers together. “And you are hoping that I accept it as evidence that two of my employees have engaged in some sort of defamation of Ms Granger’s character?”
“Oh, yeah, she’s in the shed with Dad,” George puts in. “He wanted her to look at the hole in the roof.”
“No, not really,” Harry sighs. “If Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are going out together, the world may be about to end. This is not intended to be mean-spirited but merely refers to a prediction I made in nineteen eighty-six, which I will forward to you via owl post... why does everyone think the world is about to end?”
“Thank you for joining us. I’ll try to keep this to the point: Harry, Draco, and Officer Kettleworth have made a major breakthrough in their investigation of our recent crime spree,” he says, pausing as everyone seems to murmur to the person next to them. “I’d like to pass this meeting over to them. Gentlemen, whenever you are ready.”
Draco laughs too, releasing clouds of white breath into the night. The black sky is already lit by streetlamps and shop windows, but when they turn the corner and into a narrow lane, Harry is pleasantly startled by a riot of decorations. In the distance, a vast Christmas tree towers above them, draped in soft blue lights and topped with a flashing star, while strung over their heads is a network of tiny white bulbs, interspersed with the twinkling shapes of presents and snowflakes and reindeer. The whole street is aglow, filling Harry with festive spirit and a warmth that almost makes up for the fact that he can barely feel his fingers.
He holds Stanley still and looks around, waiting for inspiration to hit him. His eyes settle on Draco’s inkpots and he smiles. Putting a finger to his lips, he reaches for his wand and slides lower in his chair, letting his arm drop and casting as carefully as he can. He holds his breath, waiting for Draco to look up and ask him what the actual fuck he is doing, but as the lids slowly unscrew themselves from the pots, his eyes don’t leave his marking.
Holding onto his remaining grapes for dear life, Harry attempts to steady himself, anchoring his racing heartbeat to the throbbing vibration of the floor and reminding himself firmly that nothing is going to happen. However often those eyes might drift in his direction, Draco had pulled away from him and said that their kiss was a mistake. Well, Harry concedes, he had said that he didn’t know what he really meant, so he might as well not have said anything at all.
Harry’s mouth tries to tug into a smile, but he fights it down. “He’s new but he’s pretty bright and he really wants to help us,” he says. “Haven’t you ever felt like a liquorice wand?”
By the time they reach the Hogwarts gates, Harry’s heart is pounding and Draco’s palm is damp against his. He squeezes tightly, dragging in a deep breath and tasting the familiar tang of forest and woodsmoke and magic.
Wednesday morning finds Borteg’s swamped with customers, as though everyone and his dog has noticed the approach of Christmas at exactly the same moment. Harry and Mr Borteg work side by side in order to keep up, both pulled all over the little shop by requests for specific bottles, last-minute bulk orders and more than one customer in the midst of an anxiety attack over a gift for a boss or relative for whom nothing is ever good enough.
Harry grins, balancing himself on one hand and reaching out gently with the other. There, illuminated in the bus’s headlights, is a whole family of bristle beetles, scuttling around like little black nail brushes, cutting the tips from the frozen grass with shiny pincers and leaping, crackling, into the air to impress one another. Harry stays as still as he can, and his patience is rewarded when a large male crawls onto the palm of his hand. Slowly, he gets to his feet and shows the beetle to Draco.
That said, he’s not about to upset the balance. Everything about this is brand new and not new at all. Draco isn’t just a man who has admired him from afar, wants to get him into bed, and happens to know Ron or Hermione. He’s been there from the start, and the fact that it has taken them the best part of two decades to get to this point only makes Harry more certain. In one way or another, they have always belonged to each other, and now, finally, he loves and desperately needs this strange man with his strange bus more than anything.
Draco sighs. “No, you don’t. They are working because they all care deeply for their community, of that I have no doubt. But they’re pulling together like this because
“Maybe you could diversify,” he says, thinking out loud. “You could sell art supplies. Rose loves all that stuff.”
Potter, bloody Potter, is infuriating. Draco thinks he should be happy now that he has an explanation for fewer than usual Potter-related-inquiries, but for some reason, he just feels agitated. Not because he suddenly cares about Potter’s mental health or, indeed, whether or not he really has decided to become a hermit, just... just for reasons. And, alright, if he’s honest, he doesn’t believe for a moment that Potter has suddenly become even less sociable than himself. He’s up to something, and Draco wonders... and then Draco hears himself wondering and stops, instead folding his arms across his chest and glaring at Pansy.
Harry says nothing, opting to enjoy a moment of stillness before the hard work really begins. He watches the sleek, black and white creatures as they pick their way through the water, bending to drink or capering this way and that for no real reason other than pure enjoyment. One or two of them raise their long faces to regard the interlopers for a second or two before returning to their play. If the first two have spread news of the operation at hand to their friends, none of them seem particularly worried about it.
“I don’t think mine works,” Draco says, wrinkling his nose. “I tried to ask it for help a couple of times and it just showed me…”
“Carmella had her kittens,” he says, breathing hard. “I couldn’t leave her until I made sure they were all out alright. I’m so sorry. You both look beautiful.”
The man stares at him, mouth pressed into a thin line. “Ninety-eight Galleons? That’s not even what I want! Were you even listening?”
Amused, Draco lifts his other hand and trails his fingers over the hot, damp skin. His fingertips drag over the points of new stubble and trace Harry’s wonderfully stubborn, if slightly sticky jawline. He’s a beautiful man, all rough edges and electric energy, and the fact that Draco is allowed to touch him any time he wants to remains almost uncomfortably thrilling. Harry sighs softly and Draco kisses him, ignoring the heat and leaning close, threading fingers into damp hair. A feeble wisp of a breeze sneaks in through the window, bringing with it the heavy scent of the brewing storm, and all at once, Draco’s head is full of white sheets and rain-damp hands and the palpable relief of a man who could not open his mouth to explain that he was hot and uncomfortable and fed up with the world.
“It’s just my mother,” Draco says, unwrapping what appears to be a small notebook and smiling to himself. “She sends me these once in a while.”
“I suppose,” Pansy will say grandly, as she always does. “I suppose I should be grateful that you deigned to join me when you could be at home shagging your ducks.”
“Well, nothing for a while. I’d almost given up. But yesterday...” Ginny shifts on the bench and pulls out a letter that looks like it has been read and folded and re-read many, many times. “She wrote back! She said she’d looked me up and asked me if I’d like to fly with them during training next week.”
Today, she hums to herself as she lines up jelly babies on the desk, arranging and rearranging them in an order only she understands. Harry hangs up his coat and stands behind the counter, hoping he might be offered one once the ritual is over. There’s something about the chunky little buggers with their starchy coating that reminds him of being seven years old and Mr Branning, who used to offer those very same treats as a reward for quiet, obedient behaviour, something at which Harry was rather practised.
“It’s the first time I’ve ever seen any evidence of it,” Draco says, but he withdraws his hand and turns, leaning with his back against the wall of the bridge and his elbows resting on top.
“Stop it,” Harry says, stuffing the rest of the vanilla slice into his mouth, just for something to do. “You’re trying to embarrass me. And it’s working.”
“Okay,” she agrees as he turns to leave, but he has stalked out of the office before the word has completely left her lips.
“Hello, Harry. I’m sorry, I thought you were Shan coming to check up on me again. I know she means well but I don’t need her to come and stare at me every fifteen minutes.”
“Ah! That… that is very clever,” Luna’s father agrees, grabbing a fork and clanging it against the metal tea tray. “You’re saying… ‘look what a noise we can make without real instruments… imagine the infernal racket we could make if we had them’!”
Now that he has started to adjust to the speed, he looks around the bottom deck and is interested to see that, apart from the heavy duty sticking charms obviously at work, very little else has changed. The bus still smells warm and slightly musty, like a bag of lavender left forgotten at the bottom of a drawer. It’s a strange smell, but not unpleasant, sending Harry back to his teenage years in an instant.
Harry suspects he is altering the protective magic on the cash drawer, and he can’t say he blames him. He’s heard about all sorts of new security measures from the customers this afternoon, and it’s likely that by tomorrow, Diagon Alley will be armed to the teeth.
“Not really, sir, no,” Timothy says, but he casts a beautiful charm that flies through the air and shackles Mr Jennings’ hands behind his back. “Time to go.”
He swallows. “Quite right, Rosie, sorry about that.” He turns to Hermione. “That’s different. We’re an Auror
Feeling motivated at last, he throws on some old jeans and his favourite red jumper with the hole in it before heading down to the kitchen. Too many days of working late and buying chips on the way home have left the place looking rather neglected, but he throws open the back door, rolls up his sleeves and gets to work, and before long, the crisp breeze has whisked away the staleness and all the cups, plates, and pans are sitting in a clean, glistening pile on the draining board. Harry meanders around the kitchen, chopping and stirring and humming to himself until he has assembled a chicken curry with extra hidden vegetables, an enormous batch of pizza dough, and a plate of bacon, toast and tomatoes, which he eats at his newly-scrubbed table in contented silence.
“My daughter studies rare magical artefacts,” Eilish says, breaking the silence. “She travels all over the world. One day she said to me, ‘Mum, I’m going to come home so I can look after you’ and I said, ‘Flora, if you do that, I will never forgive you’.”
“I can understand how it looked like a great idea,” he says, hating how the words stick. “I made myself obvious, I can see that now, and there it was, the solution to your problem. Well, good luck with the rest of your rebellion. I don’t want to be a part of it.”
“I’m going, I’m going,” he mutters, returning to the driver’s seat, and though there is studied ennui in every step, he is smiling almost as broadly as Eilish.
Harry pauses, feeling unsteady, and then starts walking again. “You do know. The rest of it doesn’t matter, because I love you.”
“No. She only likes them when they’re frozen,” Draco says. “In the summer she brings me berries and little stones. What she really likes is snow—I suppose it’s in her genes. She’s a Norwegian Forest cat.”
Just as Harry opens his mouth to respond, the sky seems to darken in an instant and cold, hard raindrops begin to hammer down, bouncing off the surface of the loch and stinging their bare skin. Without a word, they gather their dirty clothes and William’s crate and dash for the cabin, locking the door behind them and standing side by side at the window for long minutes, just watching the downpour.
He nods and turns to go. Harry gestures for Ron and Hermione to stay put and hurries to see him out.
“What about that lady who came to us yesterday?” Reuben asks. “She seemed to know what she was doing.”
They’d managed just fine for years as fellow business owners who didn’t really need to interact until Draco had sidled up to him at last year’s ice cream social-slash-winter shopkeepers’ meeting and started making inquiries about Borteg’s supplying spirits for his bloody restaurant. Then there had been the consultation, the tasting, discussions about meal pairings that had delighted Mr Borteg and made Harry feel like his head was going to explode.
“I’m not sure about brilliant, but we got the job done,” he says to his living room, and then frowns at his reflection in the mirror.
“Harry, you kicked Ralph out well over a year ago and you were with him for what… six months?” Hermione challenges.
It’s too hot for this, he knows that, but he doesn’t care, and his entire body is heavy with wanting it. He groans when Harry touches him and kisses him harder, and then the bumping from the next room is suddenly replaced by a loud crash and the sound of six scuttling feet. Slowly, they disentangle themselves and stare at each other.
At five minutes to twelve, everyone begins to pile onto the old bus, Sam at the wheel and Deb sitting beside him with a clipboard, checking off the name of each child as they board. Eliza has so many ribbons in her hair that Luna cannot count them all. Gareth is wearing his dressing gown backwards. Several of the little ones have swapped parts of their pyjama sets to create multiple mismatching ensembles, and Luna cannot help but admire their creativity.
“You see… he looked at the wall, and then he looked at me, and… well, there was something in his eyes,” he says, glancing at the swan as though it might be able to contradict his version of events. “I felt like he was saying ‘I need to go through there and you’d better get on with it’, you know?”
He elbows Draco aside with surprising force and leans into the tank, mumbling under his breath as he counts the scuttling beetles.
With spells of helping customers interspersed with distillery detective time, the afternoon passes quickly, and when Harry goes behind the counter to retrieve more parchment, he is startled to realise that all the shops around Borteg’s have closed.
“Oddly enough, Ron, those things rely on two very different skill sets,” Harry says, emerging from behind his fingers and reaching for his wine glass.
As is customary with Molly’s knitting, the jumper is a little on the large side and Harry imagines that, with a bit of wriggling, they could both fit into it at once, but Draco doesn’t seem to mind at all. He rubs the soft wool between his fingers and smiles, turning to Juno and gazing at her expectantly.
Harry turns slowly to look through the curtain, and there is Danica, sitting at the table and apparently teaching Harry the mouse to jump for treats.
Finally, after almost eighteen minutes have elapsed, George steps back from the completed tent, breathless and red-faced.
Thursday races by in a flurry of festive activity, with the biddies hunched over Christmas cards and Draco adding yet more decorations to the bus in between picking up flung fruit and shoving it into any compartment he can reach. Harry is quickly assigned a variety of tasks including, but not restricted to, tea-making, keeping the idling engine warm, and attaching tinsel to the wriggling forms of Juno and Montague.
“I’m pretty sure you’re still an idiot,” Harry says, and Draco swerves the bus so that he has to hang onto his seat in order to avoid falling off. Several strawberries shoot out of the newspaper compartment and pelt into his glasses.
“Perhaps it’s all about the excitement,” Draco suggests. “Perhaps everything we’ve thought of so far is irrelevant and this is just someone who wants to create as much havoc as possible.”
“It’s alright, Mum, I know you were just worried for your favourite son,” George says, basking in the groans from his siblings. “I haven’t missed lunch, have I?”
“We’re making a wreath,” Ida adds, and for the first time, Harry notices that the table is covered in bits of greenery.
With the benefit of hindsight, of course, he realises that he should never have tried to hide something so important from his best friends. Apart from anything else, they seem to know him better than he knows himself. He wanders back into the dark bedroom, puts on his glasses and finds that for once, it actually is the middle of the night; at least, it’s four o’clock in the morning and that’s close enough.
“Nowhere special,” Draco says, nudging the bus in front of a large coach. “Just the usual evening out—fire, alligators, that sort of thing.”
Draco looks at him, scandalised, and the two of them exchange significant glances. On the settle, Harry and Maurice roll their eyes at almost exactly the same moment, and Harry feels rather like he belongs.
“I don’t think I could find one that covered this, don’t worry,” Harry admits, unable to keep the smile off his face. “Does it… do that often?”
“I brought it from Sage,” Draco objects, ruffling the pages of his pilfered newspaper. “It was very good coffee. Why don’t you have a kettle in this godforsaken place?”
As he tries to remember the words to the next verse, the bus comes to a halt and Draco pushes the curtain aside, standing and staring at them all with Montague at his heels.
“It was. I found out I’m a father to a swan and I also learned that Christmas wishes aren’t as simple as they seem,” Harry laughs, suspecting that there’s a lot of Hermione in Rose’s ‘nothing good comes without hard work’ philosophy.
Harry’s insides squirm. “Yeah, I should probably…” He pauses, looking around for something else to say and his eyes settle on the lilies. “Good idea, those… you know, re-using the whisky bottles as vases. I think all of those came from Borteg’s, didn’t they? How did Draco enjoy them?”
He looks dreadful, exhausted and pale with half-closed eyes and a rough mask of stubble. He yawns and looks at his sofa with its soft cushions and piles of warm blankets, resisting for only a moment before flopping down and closing his eyes.
This whole thing is ridiculous, of course. He’s an excellent sleeper, always has been. Draco has always been fascinated by the way he climbs into bed, closes his eyes, and is gone until it’s time to wake up. He still has the nightmares occasionally, vivid flashes of red and green light, people tumbling and screams in dark corners, but they are few and far between now, and he has found that a cool hand through his hair and a whispered ‘it’s alright’ go a long way towards melting them away completely. It’s surprising, but then he supposes that everything to do with Draco is surprising. Harry hadn’t ever thought he wanted calm domesticity, cups of tea in the garden and walks in the park and long, long weekend mornings in bed. He hadn’t thought he wanted a Draco, but he’d been wrong.
“Officer Kettleworth… Timothy,” the man offers, sounding as though he’s not quite sure. “Good to meet you. I’ve been told you can brief me on what’s happened here so far?”
Harry stares at him in astonishment but Mr Borteg merely holds out his spindly arms and waits. Of course, it now seems obvious that he should have taken Hugo to the Burrow, but, as usual, he just jumped into action without thinking and now there’s work to be done, as well as a baffled toddler and a very strange man who genuinely wants to help. Still, he’s a strange man that Harry trusts completely, and perhaps holding a wriggling child will take his mind off things, too.
“Er… not really, no.” Ron sighs. “Listen, I’m not going to push you. If you want to do something weird, it’s your own business.”
“We have discussed this. You’ll see when we get there,” Draco says, eyeing the box with interest. “Is one of those for me?”
“Of course not,” Harry says loudly, staring into the man with the hat until he slinks away. “I took him to the park where he could be with the other swans. That’s all, I promise.”
Harry glances at Draco, who looks far more amused than is really necessary. He has no idea what to think, but the option of making a run for it and Apparating back to Hogsmeade is becoming more and more attractive by the minute. When he turns his attention back to the old woman, she is in full flow once again.
Luna shivers despite the bright morning sunshine and quickens her pace, grounding herself with each step through the long grasses that line the stream. The soil and moss are cool and soft against her bare feet and she sticks out one arm to trail through the rushes as she walks, the other curled tightly around a fat patchwork notebook. The corners are a little bent these days, many of the pages dog-eared, and the little press-stud fastener will no longer hold the book closed because so many bits of paper and photographs have been stuffed inside, but it doesn’t matter. Inside this book are her friends, and there is nothing more important.
“Thank you, this is brilliant,” he says, pulling the jumper over his head and turning this way and that to allow everyone to view it properly.
“I don’t suppose they’re also ‘something new’ are they?” Harry asks, wondering if he can collect the whole set.
Daraja laughs. “Elegua is wise, but he is also strong willed. I wonder if your friend has also asked the Orisha for guidance.”
For what seems like a long time, Draco says nothing, and Harry hopes to disappear into the secret compartment full of fruit, never to be seen again.
“Thank you, Fred,” George says, inclining his head so far that his antlers fall down around his neck. “First of all, no sucking at my party. Things will get awkward. Secondly, Ronniekins, you would look most fetching in a dress. Thirdly… is that a word? Oh, well. Thirdly, Harry, if you think you’ve seen the Malfoy, then of course you have. For we all know, that like the spirits of old, Malfoy is everywhere. He is with us in our times of trouble. He is with us in our times of joy…”
Harry leaves him with a great sense of reluctance and goes to find the bathroom. Here, the lamps light automatically and pour soft light over a small, neat room with a waxed wooden floor and a shower cubicle that is definitely big enough for two. Grinning, he turns to the sink and scrubs at his face and hands with lemon-scented soap until he almost looks like himself again. A shower in the morning should fix the rest, and could very well be a lot of fun.
Harry nods, thinking that Hermione would probably have loved one, even as a young child. He looks around the shop at the quills and bottles of ink and neat rolls of parchment.
“Are you supposed to be on there?” he asks, but Juno merely flicks her large ears and gazes at him calmly. “It does look like a nice chair…”
“It can’t be that bad,” Harry laughs, moving his arms around in a way that reminds Luna strongly of the Giant Squid that lives in the lake at Hogwarts.
“Since fuck you, that’s when,” Harry mutters, but hurries to join him. “I thought we agreed we might need something a bit more substantial for chasing goats around?”
“We have noticed, you know,” Audrey says, grinning. “You should get on with it before you get old like us!”
Harry fixes his attention on the cube, feeling his heart race and his breath catch at the thought of what those unhelpful things could be. With a deep, cleansing breath, he attempts to clear his mind, this time edging Draco out to the edges of his consciousness with ease and concentrating on the image of Diagon Alley, and of the crime scenes, one after another, over and over until the warmth from the cube travels right into his chest and the glass burns against his palms.
“That’s the lot,” he says, stepping back and dusting off his hands. “I appreciate it, Draco. Just drop them off at Cherish, the ladies will know what to do with them.”
“How nice to see you in good spirits,” Mr Borteg says, mournful voice suggesting that it is anything but. “How is our victim of crime?”
Reuben and his young staff team are already occupying one large table, Mr Pike is chatting to Mr Jennings, who is clutching his collection box, and Draco is at the counter, yawning into his sleeve. Harry’s stomach swoops at the sight of him and he pushes the feeling away, telling himself firmly that it’s fine to be pleased that the idiot is alright, but there’s no need to get carried away.
To Harry’s astonishment, he shakes Ron’s hand and stalks into the kitchen. Five seconds later, the back door clicks shut and Ron and Harry stare at each other.
“It means he likes us,” Harry says, and for a moment he slings one arm around Draco’s shoulders, causing the sea green glimmer to effervesce beautifully.
“There’s nothing surprising about us,” Eilish says, combing through her silver grey hair with a gnarled, ring-decked hand. “We’re here every day.”
“Juice,” Hugo announces, handing his plastic cup to Harry and then grabbing it back with such force that the whole thing slips out of his reach and bounces onto the table, where the lid comes loose and allows purple liquid to spread out over Rose’s artwork.
“I would like a copy,” Mr Borteg announces. “After hearing of his perilous journey, I find myself rather impressed by him.”
“Yeah. And she’s not going to be the only one.” Harry frowns. “I wonder what he’s done with all those Christmas presents.”
Feeling as though he has taken leave of his senses, Harry steps onto the bus. The moment he is aboard, Draco puts his foot down and sends them barrelling through traffic, darting between cars and leaving Harry stumbling. In desperation, he reaches for something solid, fingers closing around a piece of smooth metal which immediately springs out of his grip, sending him into a chaotic spin that ends when he is deposited without ceremony on a cold, hard seat attached to the wall opposite the driver’s chair.
“Well, that was more violent than I expected,” he says, staggering off the ice and tacking along the cobbles on his skates.
As they exchange vows and rings, the snow continues to fall, spiralling down in bigger and bigger flakes until several of the guests have to produce a magical shield just so that the couple remain visible. Angelina’s dark skin and hair are soon dotted with flakes as lacy as her dress, and when George attempts to put the ring on her finger, his numb hands fumble it and only the quick actions of the officiant prevent it from being lost in the snow.
“Get into that, laddies, you’ve a good wee bit of gardening ahead of ye,” she advises, clattering down the plates without ceremony and returning moments later with two fresh pints of beer.
Draco lets out a humourless snort. He unwinds a section of string, wrapping it around his hands and pulling tight until his fingers turn white.
Pansy clicks off and drops the needle onto a frenetic, bouncy song with an infectious beat. Draco taps his fingers on the desk as he flips through the leftover listeners’ messages. Finding nothing of interest, he wheels over to the Eye in the Sky and looks up and down Diagon Alley. The street is still sleeping, lying peacefully under a blanket of soft, grey clouds. Without really thinking about it, Draco swings the telescope around to point at the Magical Menagerie. The shop is, unsurprisingly, closed, but he lingers, examining the bright exterior paintwork and the shadowy movements of the birds in the rafters, just visible through the tops of the windows.
Harry supposes he shouldn’t be surprised. Jean has been taking care of the owls at Eeylops for donkey’s years; she isn’t about to tolerate any funny business from a stroppy swan.
He closes his eyes and stretches, easing the ache in his back. As he does, Hermione’s voice drifts into his head as though she’s standing right behind him with her hands on her hips.
To hell with it, he’s getting too old to be a slave to fashion. Then again, Pansy wouldn’t be Pansy if she could let this sort of thing lie. Draco leans towards the omnivox.
“I don’t think swans are. Needle is. He’s an individual, aren’t you?” Draco murmurs, gazing down at the swan in a way that Ron would definitely describe as ‘clucky’.
Feeling slightly sick, Harry closes his eyes. Ida is a sweet, eccentric old woman and he can’t comprehend how her family could be so cold. All he does know is that when he sees Molly tomorrow, he’s going to hug her until she makes him stop. When he opens his eyes, Corrie, Eilish, and Danica are peering at him, faces creased in concern. He smiles at them and they seem to relax, sipping their horrible tea and watching the nurses and Healers hurry by. They are sitting so patiently, despite the uncomfortable chairs and the crowds, waiting for news of their friend, and perhaps, Harry thinks, that’s the point.
Harry gazes around at the kitchen full of Weasley men, steaming drinks and freshly-pressed dress robes in all colours of the rainbow. He squeezes Draco’s shoulder.
“You’re supposed to be eating this, mate,” Harry whispers, placing the potato back in front of Hugo. “This represents the high point of your mother’s culinary expertise.”
“You have no evidence,” she repeats, picking up her quill and scratching at a piece of parchment. “I have work to do. Please see yourselves out.”
Draco gives him such a withering look that he continues smiling all the way to the shop, and when the door clicks shut behind him, he realises that his dark mood has all but dissolved. Humming to himself, he polishes his Orisha cube with his sleeve and arranges it on the counter so that the glass gleams attractively in the light.
Amused, Harry runs his fingers through the patch of snow atop the wall where Juno has left neat, if rather large, pawprints.
“I don’t know,” the officer sighs. “Just thought it might be something. Let’s go back to the beginning—I need to get it straight in my head.”
“I wouldn’t dream of it,” says Harry, who hasn’t written anything; Jean hasn’t yet told him anything he doesn’t already know.
His new chair is a thing of beauty. It is compact and unfussy but perfect in every way, made of a dark, chocolate brown leather that contrasts warmly with the lighter driver’s seat. When he sits down this time, the cushioned frame hugs him perfectly, and the back is set at exactly the right height for him to lean back and rest his head. The whole thing also smells fantastic, fits inexplicably into the same little space as the tiny flip-up seat, and is quite possibly the best chair Harry has ever had the pleasure of sitting in.
Harry feels Draco’s frustration billowing around him like a cloud. He hangs back for a moment, folding the red velvet between his fingers, but when Juno jumps down and trots after Eilish too, he decides to leave him to it.
Minutes later, the bus comes to a stop, tyres crunching on gravel and engine coughing. Draco opens the doors and the ladies pile out, chattering excitedly. Harry follows and pauses at the door, appearing to notice at the same time as Draco that Danica has left her mouse cage on the table.
“I bet you’d look lovely in tights,” Mary Ann says absently and then turns bright red when everyone except Draco bursts into laughter.
“Draco,” she’ll declare, curling into his side with her stiletto heels tucked up onto yet another velvet banquette, “you’ll never find anyone to fuck if you sit there looking like you’ve forgotten which drawer you keep your balls in.”
Harry is weak. Draco’s hair, dishevelled into soft waves, hangs over one eye, while the other fixes on Harry with gut-wrenching intensity.
She doesn’t care. It’s loud and ridiculous and it’s wonderful. People can’t help but hear, which means they have to look, and when they look, they see the children in their little pyjamas and the staff in their determined, brazening-it-out embarrassment, and they smile. They smile and they get out their money bags and purses and wallets. They drop heavy coins into Luna’s bucket that land with a satisfying thud. They drop coins into all the buckets, adding words of encouragement and offers of help and, “What a bloody awful noise, can I hire you to play outside my mother-in-law’s house?”
Friday morning is cold and frosty with a wind that seems to sweep Diagon Alley clean. Harry strides over the cobbles towards Borteg’s and allows it to blow through him, snatching away his anxiety and suffusing him with a new sense of purpose. Yes, he tells himself, all but flinging his arms out like a mad person, bad things have happened, but today is a day for action. He can feel it, and he is ready to come back strong and set to work. There is no use sitting around feeling betrayed, and there is certainly no time to mope about how he has buggered things up with Draco. Again.
“I don’t want to confuse him,” Rose says, pressing her fingertips to the glass as the spider attempts to climb the inside of the jar. “But I don’t want to let him go and let Needle eat him.”
Eyes fixed on the driver, he drifts out of the conversation around him and waits. After a moment, the bus grinds to a halt in the middle of a quiet residential street and the shadowy figure climbs out of his seat, wand drawn. Carefully, he traces a spell across the purple ceiling, making the air ripple around the chandelier and forming a shimmering barrier across the opening that leads to the stairs. He scrutinises his work for a moment and then lowers his wand, glancing around the bottom deck and meeting Harry’s eyes.
“I’m sure he’ll be pleased he was invited,” Harry says, touched and bewildered by how easily his family and Draco seem to have accepted each other.
“This,” Draco says, and then he’s sliding into Harry into one, long stroke. He pauses, taking a shuddering breath, and when he speaks again, his voice is rough and halting. “The oil is made with scents that… fuck… remind me of you.”
“Ginny’s the thief,” he mumbles, staring at Draco. “Ginny’s the thief and Louis is everyone else and the shops are the gravy boat. This is all about the gravy boat.”
“I’m looking for a good strong firewhisky,” he says with a friendly smile, and then glances around. “I heard this place had a nasty—”
“Oh, good,” comes a familiar voice, and when Harry turns around, Florean is nowhere to be seen and Draco is standing right behind him wearing a long green scarf and a weary expression. “An enormous snowman made of ice cream, do you think? A lake of strawberry sauce?”
“We may have rewrapped a few of them,” Draco admits. “They were a little bit worse for wear when we found them.”
“Don’t interfere with my bus, Harry,” Draco says, and though his voice is stern, there is a flicker of humour in his eyes that both confuses and intrigues Harry.
“Are you getting on?” Draco asks, and there’s a tone of nonchalance in his voice that Harry doesn’t quite believe. His fingers grip the wheel tightly and his posture, usually relaxed when in command of his bus, is rigid and uncertain.
He takes his paper bag and moves on, winding through the crowd to inspect the second stall. Rose, he is pretty sure, would enjoy this one, too. With the help of a dazzling orb of magical light, a pair of artists with gloriously rainbow coloured hair are painting designs onto the faces, arms and hands of adults and children alike. Mr Pike from the Magical Menagerie waves to Harry and the female artist chides him gently, pulling his arm back into position and rendering a startlingly realistic lizard’s face with what seems to be a single flick of the wrist. Beside her, her male counterpart is painting gleaming icicles onto the face of a little girl just about Rose’s age.
“Ah,” he says at last, eyes snapping open. “I need to order some straw for the duck house. The stuff I ordered last time is too... erm, scratchy.”
“Oh, don’t tell him off,” Miss Lister says, slipping her bracelet back on and bending to stroke Needle. “He didn’t mean any harm, did you?”
“No, thank you.” Draco chops the basil and throws it into the pan with a flourish. “You can make the next one.”
Harry eyes the bath with interest. His temperature seems to be dropping rapidly, and besides, there’s plenty of room in there for… all sorts of things.
“Really… though I might have a way to make it even better,” Ginny says, and when she smiles, Luna doesn’t know whether to be excited or apprehensive.
“Of course,” Draco says, tone suddenly smooth and polite. When the nurse leaves, he turns back to the group. “We aren’t allowed to go in.”
A vast slice of chicken and mushroom pie takes up much of the plate, and it smells delicious. Also fighting for position are mounds of very well boiled peas and carrots, and a pile of home-made chips. After adding salt and vinegar, he tries one, and silently declares it to be the best he has ever had.
“MLE should be all over this,” Mr Pike says crossly. “Diagon Alley is the centre of the wizarding community, and it’s coming up to Christmas.”
Draco glances at him, eyebrows knitted. “Do you really think they don’t mind giving away five extra tickets?”
“Have you any proof of this... story?” she asks, steepling her hands under her baggy chin and gazing up at them without a hint of interest.
“Your mother bought me those bloody boxers,” Harry mutters, but Draco is laughing so hard that he opts to cover his eyes and quietly die with shame.
“Clever Needle,” Draco murmurs. “I knew he sensed something that night. He’s probably known about this for weeks.”
“You know what I mean,” Draco interrupts, wishing he’d through to cast an umbrella charm as rivulets of rainwater begin to run from the ends of his hair and into his mouth. He could cast one now, of course, but he doesn’t want to give Potter the satisfaction. “I’m fully aware of how ridiculous this sounds coming from me, but... are you alright?”
“What’s an Orisha?” Harry asks, turning the sphere in his hands and startling when the green flame licks at his skin and a ripple of warmth and contentment spreads out from his fingertips.
“Flattery will get you… well, it’ll certainly get you a free crackleball or two,” Shan says, and then turns to Draco. “We’re hoping to drag a few people back to yours afterwards… tea, cakes, that sort of thing. Do you think you’ll have a space?”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Would you like to come over and try telling her that? She says it’s my birthright, but I don’t want it and neither does she. She doesn’t always make sense, but she’s my mother.”
When Ron retreats from the fire, leaving a soot-spattered hearth behind him, Harry discovers that it’s already half past nine and decides that he ought to get moving if he wants to spend some time with his new friends before lunch at the Burrow. Molly’s roasts are legendary, and though he can cook well enough for himself, he lacks the enthusiasm to create anything elaborate when he knows he’s going to be eating it alone, and he knows that her vast portions and tubs of leftovers will see him through half of the week.
Harry pretends to pull several levers in turn, swinging the wheel around and throwing himself with it as though the whole bus is pelting around corners at top speed, stamping his feet into the floor in front of the pedals and reaching out for the handbrake. He makes a soft screeching sound under his breath, and Juno digs her claws into his shoulder, apparently as caught up in his game as he is.
“It was your idea to get away!” Harry interrupts, riled by the accusing tone in Draco’s voice. “‘We could leave’, you said. ‘We could just leave’. This is as much your fault as it is mine!”
“Thank you,” Draco says gravely. He glances at Harry. “Perhaps you could retrieve that… package from Florean by yourself.”
Harry is a part of that now, as much as he is a part of the madness at the Burrow and the lives of his best friends, both of whom might just actually need him more than he has previously understood. His eyes are drawn to a picture on the mantelpiece, in which he, Ron and Hermione cling to each other in a fit of giggles. Rose had taken it by accident with her granddad’s camera when Hugo was only a twinkle in someone’s eye, and Harry has always loved it.
Draco closes his eyes and yanks the handbrake into position. Harry coughs and gets to his feet, flapping his coat at the smoke and hurrying to check on the ladies, who are still sitting calmly at their table in a little pocket of clear air.
“The beer’s under the eggs, ye ken? Not a word to Gertie,” he mumbles under his breath, smiling at the old woman and then retreating with a wave.
“Merry Christmas, mate,” Ron says, clinking his glass against Harry’s and setting off a chain reaction of clinks and festive wishes. “You know, Hermione talks in her sleep, too.”
, at which point he sits down at the kitchen table with his head in his hands until the last of his sanity prevails.
Draco grants Harry a ruinous little smile and then follows him into the distillery. He sits in his chair and strokes Needle’s head with an elegant forefinger.
“Aak!” he offers, and then flaps into the air, swooping down to retrieve his cherry from the floor and then spiralling over to Luna’s desk, where he drops the cherry and punts it with his beak until it flies through the air and out of the window.
She turns back to the others just in time to see her father gathering her friends and attempting to teach them the steps of a set dance. Horace gamely joins in, Hermione drags Ron up to have a go, and Blaise loops the little dog’s lead over a fencepost so that he can throw himself around with the others. When the band leader nods to the others and kicks the music up a notch, the party seems to take off and fly. Everyone sheds their cardigans, outer robes, high heels and inhibitions, laughing as they attempt to follow instructions and laughing harder when they end up in a tangle on the grass.
When they have finished, she brings out another plate, this one containing a large steaming fruit dumpling and a jug of sauce that smells strongly of whisky. Harry gazes at it, impressed by its sheer size. They have never been offered dessert before, and neither does Gertie usually stand there while they eat, but tonight she doesn’t budge, bright blue eyes fixed on them as they exchange glances and then pour on the sauce before trying the dumpling.
“When my father died, I signed it all over to the Ministry,” he says, catching Harry’s look of astonishment. “No, I’m still not their biggest fan but I made them sign a contract promising that they would use the money for useful things, not for pointless bureaucracy and certainly not for wars.”
“Some sort of tinctures that Shan and Esmee want to give to their wedding guests,” Draco says, peering into the topmost crate. “I only came down to wait for you but apparently my services are required as a packhorse.”
Just then, Angus breaches the surface in a spectacular jump, flinging his body through the air and almost slapping Harry across the face with his enormous tail. Harry stops and stares, treading water for a moment before he realises that he can now just about reach the bottom. Angus crashes back into the loch, but Harry has seen enough to guess that he is, in fact, a very large brown trout. He’s at least five feet long from head to tail, golden brown and gleaming with a pattern of dark spots and a huge, gaping mouth.
Harry turns to look at him. “Okay, but do you think she won’t just come down here? Banging on the door? Demanding to know what we think we’re playing at...?”
“The name is on account of the brown trout in the loch away there,” she continues, pointing over Harry’s shoulder with a wrinkled finger.
Harry opens his eyes now, waiting, motionless, for the jolts of pleasure and panic to fade away. Fine blond hair turned white in the early light that snakes through a gap in the curtains. A pale hand twisted into his dark robes. A rather pointed knee pressed into an uncomfortable place. Draco, too, is fully dressed, and now mumbles to himself as Harry lifts his free hand and threads it though soft, sun-warmed hair.
Harry gets up and hugs her, heart warm and full to bursting. “You are, in all the ways that matter. I know my Mum and Dad are really pleased that you and Arthur could take over for them.”
“I just don’t want this to happen to anyone else,” Mrs Purley says. “I don’t want to think I can’t trust the people that come into the café.”
“Do you think someone’s stealing the presents and carrying them off in a sack?” Timothy says, puzzled. “Like a horrible Father Christmas?”
The sight of it fortifies him and he stands up straight. “Right. Can I have a black cherry crackleball, please?”
“Scandalous,” Draco murmurs, and then falls silent as they remove their skates and lace up their shoes.
back where he found it and follows him into the shop, where they inform a dubious Mr Borteg that they need to run a brief, investigation-related errand.
“It’s not that kind of spa day,” Ginny says. “We’ve got to do an exercise class and then we’re getting wrapped up in Kelpie slime and then having lunch.”
When the warm-up is complete, Luna changes the record for something fast-paced with loud, sunshiny horns and a Spanish guitar. She spends the first couple of songs encouraging the kids to match the tempo of the music, moving any way they like to shake out their tension and worries, and she tries to do the same, imagining that all of her friends’ loneliness and anxiety is flowing out of her, right out to her fingertips and away. With the afternoon sunlight warm on her skin, she leads the class in a round of loud applause and then starts to call out suggestions to inspire their movement.
“There you go, darling,” she’ll says, poking the little boxes at him across the desk, and he’ll accept them, waiting for the inevitable critique of his fashion choices.
Flooded with sensation, Harry kisses back, heat rushing to every part of him as he pushes Draco back against the dashboard. Pulled tight together, mouths slipping in a desperate rush, Harry is dizzy and breathless, wanting more but feeling his knees turning to water beneath him. Everything inside him hammering and sparking, he presses close, tasting tea and humbugs on Draco’s tongue and wondering how any of this makes sense, or if he even wants it to.
“I’m sorry,” he says now, getting to his feet. “What I said just now, it came out all wrong, and I want you to know that… well, I know you didn’t want to do those things. I know you were protecting your family. I don’t know why I’ve never said any of this to you before but I feel pretty stupid and you can tell me to stop talking at any time.”
Humming to himself, he runs a bath, peeling off his dirty clothes and sinking into the hot water right up to his neck. He closes his eyes, inhaling sage-scented steam, and allows the problem to drift around him.
. The fact that he is clearly in the middle of telling a story to a sunblock-smeared Ivy is also to be expected, but the rather possessive hand on Fergus Quinlan’s knee and the presence of a Gryffindor-themed bracelet on his wrist is extremely interesting.
The ladies are oddly quiet as he takes his seat, but he is quickly lifted by their smiles, their immediate pouring of tea and the offer of home made cakes from a tin with a painted stag on the lid. He settles back into his chair, a solidly-made thing in soft, forest green fabric, and sips the fragrant liquid from his cup.
Ignoring it hasn’t made it go away. Ignoring things never makes them go away; the best one can hope for is a little more time, and now that time is up.
“In a state of emergency?” Malfoy asks, sipping his tea with a nonchalance that makes Harry want to leap onto the bus and strangle him.
Harry is already halfway down the stairs, stopping only when he steps into the shop and finds it empty apart from Shan and a lady in a green coat, both of whom are staring at something on the counter. At the sound of his footsteps, they turn as one to look at him.
Ginny emerges from the crowd, carrying two glasses of something sparkling. She hands one of them to Luna.
“We’ll wait,” Harry agrees, licking chocolate sauce from his cone and standing firm, even as the others begin to arrive and almost all of them demand to know why they have been dragged in early without an explanation.
“Okay.” He falls silent and leans back in his seat, taking advantage of his position directly facing Draco to study him as he drives.
“Nobody said anything about gallivanting, Draco,” Luna says. “You’ll be allowed to go at your own pace.”
“And do you?” Harry asks, delighted by the combination of those words and Mr Borteg’s funereal voice.
“No,” Harry says, giving Draco a look that he feels conveys all the derision he feels for that idea. “On this island... of tea and... and swans... and... the best Quidditch league in the whole damn... thing. You know.”
“Tell me something new,” Draco mutters, wincing as a pigeon misses the windscreen by a fraction of an inch.
“I did not,” Harry mutters, but he can feel himself flushing, and when Draco starts to laugh again, he can’t help but join in.
Harry looks down at his polka dot boxer shorts, his worn old Gryffindor t-shirt and his suspiciously new-looking pair of red slippers.
“It’s definitely a reconstruction spell and not a very good one,” Timothy says, drawing his wand over the area and producing an odd crackle of orange light. “The same on the other side.”
The heavy thing purrs loudly, leaning close enough to brush Harry’s nose with curious whiskers. He ignores it, shuffling closer to Draco and winding a possessive arm around his waist. This is a nice place. It’s a warm place, a soft place, and a place where Draco’s naked body is tangled comfortably with his, pale hair ruffled against his shoulder and fingers splayed over his belly, fractions of an inch from the ache of his morning hardness.
“You think you’re funny, don’t you?” Draco sighs, mouth tugging into a reluctant smile as the old man grins, displaying both rows of crooked teeth.
“I have to go back,” Draco says, and Harry is embarrassingly hard just from the briefest touch of his fingertips. “Soon.”
“What is it?” Harry asks, and he, too, is pretending. He’s pretending he doesn’t know why everyone is staring at him, and one does not need to be able to see glimmers to know that, because his face is bright red and his eyes are flicking all over the place.
“I’ll bring some round when we’re done,” Shan says, pleased with his enthusiasm. “You can put them in your Christmas hampers.”
Brightened by the prospect of a nice dinner with his friends, Harry heads for the shower. His legs are a little unsteady beneath him but he thinks he can fix that with coffee and a good breakfast, and by the time he has sluiced away all traces of sweat and Pepper-Up, he is feeling much more like himself.
Ron groans and drops his head onto his arms. “Where did you see him? Is he in the walls? Is he on the ceiling? Is he up my dress?”
Torn between exasperation and sympathy, Harry rests a hand on Draco’s arm and then pulls it back, seeing the surprise on Draco’s face. Irritated with himself, he focuses on Mr Jennings.
“Come on, Harry!” Ron calls, stumbling back to the front of the bus and dangling towards him from a metal pole. “Charlie’s got some of that Dragon Spirit and he says the last one to drink a shot has to drink two.”
“Can I have a lollipop, please?” she asks, glancing at Harry, and then whipping around as the fire artist throws a ring of flame into the air, creating a hissing sound as fire meets snowflakes. “Wow, Uncle Harry, look at that… and the swan’s back!”
. When the shimmering water comes into view and he finds Draco there, sitting cross-legged on the ground and sifting through pebbles, he isn’t all that surprised. He is, however, irritated, because this is his spot and he doesn’t want to share it. Especially not with an idiot like Malfoy.
“I don’t mind them. Anything’s better than a Malfoy Christmas.” Draco gazes into a brightly lit shop window as they pass and sighs. “Christmas day at the Manor was always very formal, as you can imagine. My father used to have the house decorated to perfection and then invite around anyone he wanted to impress. I can’t remember a year when it was just family for dinner.”
He grabs the black bread and stuffs it into his mouth, chewing rapidly with his eyes tightly shut until finally he swallows, holds his hand out for his mulled mead and performs a little bow. The room explodes into applause. Harry jumps when Ginny wolf-whistles right next to his ear. Bill abandons his sombre role momentarily to give his brother the thumbs-up.
Draco passes her the message and watches her nose wrinkle and her eyes grow wide. After a moment, she draws her wand and sets the piece of parchment on fire.
“So many people, all together,” he says wistfully, and she wonders if her next project should be to find him a friend. Not that she’s finished with her current project quite yet.
Back at number twelve, Harry turns the shower up as hot as he can stand and scrubs every inch of himself, sluicing his skin over and over until the water that runs into the drain is clear rather than grey. It takes three washes to cleanse the last of the sticky soot from his hair and he has to admit defeat on his fingernails but when he steps out of the shower, he finally feels clean. In the kitchen, he makes tea and crumpets and then settles in front of the fire to wrap his presents. With the charity parcels clear in his mind, he abandons his usual haphazard process and takes his time, using a combination of magic and careful folding to encase each gift in a neat layer of shiny paper. He conjures ribbons to suit each recipient, choosing raw silk for Hermione, red glitter for Rose, a floral print for Molly and a pattern of tiny swans for Draco.
Madam Malkin gazes at them in bewilderment as they disappear back into the fitting room. After a moment, she shakes her head and wanders off to straighten the window display, still muttering to herself about sleeves when Fred and George return, dressed in their usual jeans and pulling on coats and hats before they step out into the frozen street.
“Is that likely?” Harry asks, making a face at the window where the rain is now hammering against it with such force that the outside world is no longer visible.
Harry spins around and makes a grab for the second goat, but she is deceptively agile and easily evades his attempt at capture, performing an odd little jump before trotting off down the hill and out of sight. He turns back to Draco, who is biting down on a smile.
“Such a lovely Needle swan,” she mumbles, stroking his feathers and laughing when he reaches out and unfastens the strap of her dungarees.
“Draco,” she cries, springing to her feet with no sign of stiffness in her hip. “Oh, hello, Harry, dear,” she adds, beaming at him, but it is Draco who receives her fierce hug and Draco who returns it instantly, wrapping the tiny lady in his arms and mumbling to her fiercely.
“Don’t look at me like that,” Draco says weakly, even as he trails a hand up Harry’s thigh and over the stretched cotton of his underwear, missing his morning hardness by a fraction of an inch.
They head out into the corridor in silence, stopping whenever someone dashes by or tries to cross their path. After a few false starts, they find Ida’s room at the end of the corridor, check for hospital staff, and then slip inside. Eilish, Corrie and Danica dispel their charms and drop Montague onto the sheets.
Harry hugs her back, inhaling the warm smell of beeswax and rosemary and smiling against the top of her head. She has more than a few greys these days but compared to the ladies from the Knight Bus, she seems vigorous with youth and the realisation lifts him.
Harry sorts through the items in quiet disbelief, opening the topmost book to find Portkey passes and a note from Ida with tips on how to remember what their individual key will look like.
“Will you stop looking at me like that?” he whispers after a minute or two. “I’m trying to drive a very large bus.”
Harry turns, startled to see Draco standing behind him and to realise that the bus is now stationary, parked up beside a frosty, sun-dappled forest.
After a startlingly delicious breakfast and an even better morning soak in the copper tub, Harry heads home, with a great deal of reluctance, to change his clothes and ensure that number twelve has not crumbled in his absence. He finds an owl waiting on his living room windowsill with an official-looking letter, which he takes into the house and reads by the fire.
He hopes she’ll be pleased to see him, and then he stops and shakes that idea from his head. Molly is always pleased to see him; she’s delighted to welcome any guest into her home, and Harry is rather counting on that fact. Whether Draco sees the whole endeavour as helpful or unwanted interference is another matter, but he has to try, and he has to do it now, because the stile is cold and hard and he can no longer feel his backside.
“And I am,” Harry says, unable to stop himself imagining Molly’s reaction to finding a furious Draco in her fire at seven o’clock in the morning. “Will you just tell me what’s wrong?”
When something flies into the window and crashes with a damp thud, his eyes fly open and he is surprised to see Eilish beaming and getting to her feet.
Just a few pages on, there is the picture of Ginny with her Quidditch hero, Jayne Cavendish of Puddlemere United. That one had been a challenge, but Luna had been able to pull together an ‘accidental’ meeting between the two women with a little help from the
“How dare you?” George hisses, sticking his little finger out from his cup and slurping loudly. “I am a man of fine breeding and impeccable manners.”
“Right, well… perhaps I’ll just… just a misunderstanding,” he babbles, feeling around for the door handle. “I think I’ll come back when I’ve…”
Mrs Purley ducks behind the counter and grabs a sack. She spreads it out so he can see ‘Goodman’s Quality Cheeses’ stamped across the fabric in dark blue ink.
“Where?” Draco asks eventually, and Harry’s heart leaps until he remembers exactly what he’s asking.
George surrenders his wand with some ceremony, and then, against the backdrop of cheers, encouragement, and the occasional insult, he kneels on the stone flags and begins to erect his tent. He clearly hasn’t been practising, because within seconds he has managed to tangle the ridiculous sleeves of the Weasley jumper in the assorted tent poles, and when he finally manages to get the tent to stand up, it immediately collapses and he has to start again.
“Seven to dine, friendships align,” Molly says, looking around the table with a smile. “That’s an old Prewett family proverb. I suppose they didn’t realise I was going to have so many children.”
“I don’t like to be looked at,” Draco says, fiddling with a bunch of basil. “Not any more. It makes me feel exposed. When you do it… it’s different.”
The kitchen is warm, brightly lit, and filled with delicious, savoury smells, but Hermione stops only to grab a bottle of wine before propelling him out into the garden.
The first picture is of Montague, perching on Ida’s lap with his mouth open in an enormous yawn, while in the background, Corrie is pulling a similar face in order to get her teeth around one of Molly’s cupcakes. Harry grins and flicks through the others: there’s Danica, making Harry the mouse jump for a sunflower seed; Eilish and Ida gripping cups of tea and laughing; Juno on her back in the aisle, rolling around with all four feet in the air; Draco, caught by surprise, turning around in the driver’s seat as though someone has just called his name, and several fantastic snaps of all six of them wearing their hats, plus a close-up of Corrie and the tea cosy. There are pictures of him, too, and he almost doesn’t recognise himself in a single one of them.
Suddenly furious with himself, he takes a long, calming breath and settles on his side, stretching out his irritated muscles and laying his head carefully on his pillow. It’s dark, it’s quiet, he is a capable grown-up, and he can sleep. He exhales slowly and tenses then releases his shoulders. He’s fine. Everything’s fine. Draco’s fine. Of course he is. With one controlled breath and then another, Harry tunes out the discomfort in his head and allows himself to drift.
“You must heed this warning,” she insists, beads rattling as she sways from side to side, her eyes never leaving his. “This is not your path, Harry. The Inner Eye sees only destruction ahead, should you choose to ignore the wisdom of the spirits.”
“I do,” Fred booms, grabbing George by the shoulders and pushing him into the centre of the room. “Best of luck, favourite brother.”
By the time she hears the sound of mingled voices and footsteps that signify the children returning to their classes, she has filled several pages with her plans and suspects that, were she able to see her own glimmer, she would be glowing with excitement.
“Okay!” Louis says, standing and weaving his way through the chaos until he reaches the kitchen cupboards. “Le placard… oh.”
Harry catches, “Don’t you dare do anything like that again,” and then the rest is lost against silky white hair and hospital-issued robes. He leans against the doorframe and aches for both of them, and when Ida pulls away and asks after Montague, he can’t help smiling. She has already admitted to tripping over him on the stairs, but there’s no resentment; all she wants is to have him back by her side. He supposes that love can be funny like that.
Harry doesn’t mind. The shop is quiet, Mr Borteg is working away in his back room, and he has all the time in the world to hear about Shan and Esmee’s latest endeavour.
“Of course. My mind is completely under my control,” Draco says, striding over to Mr Borteg’s desk and rearranging his quills.
Harry says nothing, just presses his face to Draco’s neck and inhales the warm, Sunday afternoon scents of tea and lemons and lots and lots of ink. Never one to be excluded, Stanley clambers up and insinuates himself between them with a lot of contented tacking.
Before Harry can respond, he has drawn his wand and targeted the out-of-control bracken, snaring it in a web of white light and then obliterating it with a flick of his wrist.
Esmee, in contrast to her companion, is tall and stately and reminds Harry of nothing so much as a beautiful cappuccino, with her coffee-coloured skin, dusting of chocolate freckles and mass of frothy white curls, which are always held back by one of a vast collection of colourful scarves.
“Alright, alright, pull yourselves together or it’ll be Movement to Music for both of you,” Sam says.
“Oh, definitely,” Audrey agrees. “I never got my Apparition test, you know. All that determination and deliberation stuff… couldn’t stick it.”
“Thank you for that,” he says, feeling better than he has all day. “Would you like to help me choose a Christmas tree?”
“Teacher training day,” Harry explains, and she notices the absence of balled-up robes with interest.
“I can’t be quiet,” he murmurs, dragging Draco into another kiss and then another. “I’ve never been very good at following instructions.”
From that moment, a routine begins to fall into place. Draco finishes the show, having reported with Pansy on whatever bizarre new thing Potter happens to be up to, he walks to the deli or the pie shop or the market for lunch, and then he brings it to the Magical Menagerie, where Potter spends a varying amount of time looking at him as though he’s mad before giving in and eating whatever Draco has supplied. He serves customers and cleans out cages and frowns at his adding machine while Draco observes the animals, avoids the curious attentions of the enormous snake, and asks just about every question that pops into his head.
“I take a little break,” she says, shaking out her long red hair. “Please putting your donations in tins by stalls. Thank you.”
“That’s... more than I needed to know,” Draco says, wrinkling his nose as his brain forces him to imagine the logistics of such a thing, which leads inevitably to the vivid mental picture of a naked Ronald Weasley.
Draco shoots him an inquiring glance and he nods. Leaping to his feet, Draco casts a muttered Summoning Charm, causing several envelopes to fly out from a creaky drawer, and a battered notepad to wiggle itself free from under the leg of a table. In its absence, the table wobbles and sends all the items on its surface pitching to one side.
Harry grins, feeling rather touched. “That’s really nice of you, Danica, but don’t you think it might get a bit confusing?”
“I’ve made a couple of firecalls and sent an owl, but I’m not holding my breath,” Draco says, setting Montague down so that he can rest his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands. “Her step-children are the only ones still alive, and they’re… let’s just say they’re not very nice people.”
Draco snorts. “She brought both of them up from a very young age, but who knows. I don’t know what goes on in their heads and I don’t want to.”
“I don’t think so,” Draco says, and though it isn’t actually a lie, it might as well be, because he is quite certain that Derek is going to ‘need’ all manner of things over the coming weeks. The plan is, however, to spread them out in order to buy himself as much time as possible in the shop.
He looks away quickly but Harry has seen enough. He knows those eyes and he should always trust his instincts. Letting out a ragged breath and attempting to calm the tangle of eels in his stomach, he turns away from the driver and back to his friends, just as the bus launches itself back into motion.
Five minutes and three bites later, Harry is heading for the Leaky Cauldron, carrying a damp cardboard box containing a lightly stunned swan. Though clearly drowsy and a lot more compliant than before, the swan is still conscious and shifting around inside the box, causing Harry to pitch from side to side with the momentum of its massive bulk. People are looking, and of course they are. At best he looks pissed as a newt and at worst, like he’s completely lost his mind.
“Er, right. Well, let’s go, it’ll be starting in a few minutes,” he says, mildly surprised when all the biddies get to their feet and file past him to the door.
Harry grins and takes a messy bite, knowing that the pale green eyes are following him from the luggage rack.
“But they know what time Jean goes to the Leaky Cauldron for her nightcap,” Draco says, joining Harry at the map and touching the parchment with his fingertips. “I don’t know everyone’s security spells but I know a lot of them. We’ve always shared them so we can help each other out.”
“Not that one, I assure you. Phillippe is my restaurant manager and as well as making an excellent toastie, he possesses a full, working sense of humour.”
Draco’s bland expression flickers for the briefest of moments, but it’s enough, and Harry has to turn away to suppress a snort of laughter.
“Well, he followed me, like,” Patrick says, soft Irish accent so charming that the words seem almost plausible.
“No offence, mate,” Ron says, eyeing Needle with distrust, “but why did you come down here if you didn’t want to have a go?”
“Malfoys do not dance,” Draco says, and there is a note of amusement in his voice that intrigues Luna.
Draco nods and laces their fingers together. “Come on. There’s a little van up here that sells the strangest and most fantastic ice cream.”
“I didn’t think it would be her that would let the cat out of the bag,” Danica says, leaning back and sipping her tea calmly.
“Go on, then,” the nurse says, and everyone who is able makes their way to the trolley to poke and prod at the packages.
Draco brushes invisible specks from his coat. “Don’t get me wrong, I’ve tried some wonderful things from your shop recently but I thought perhaps I should have a signature whisky.”
She smiles at him and nudges Shan, who is picking up chocolates with silver tongs at the direction of a lady with an elaborate feathered hat.
“You’re frightening the kits,” he says mournfully. “Perhaps you should both go and discuss your swan somewhere else.”
“I don’t know,” Harry admits, picking up a stick of baked potato that Hugo has flung onto the table and returning it to him. “I think he just wore me down.”
“Brian’s supposed to wake up any day now,” says the man at the next bed. “We hoped he’d be awake for Christmas but… we’ll just make it even better next year.”
“When you’ve been around as long as I have, you start to find humour in the strangest places,” Lee says solemnly, before his stubbled old face once again breaks into a wide smile.
Luna sips her hot chocolate slowly, allowing the first threads of an idea to weave themselves into being. It would be wonderful for the children to have a piano, and she thinks she might just be able to help Harry and Draco at the same time.
Eilish regards the mouse in Harry’s hands with deep suspicion, but the others lean in to inspect it, touching its whiskers and little paws as it remains magically frozen.
Mr Borteg wanders in from the distillery to greet them, exchanging a significant glance with Harry before he approaches the desk and asks Rose what she’s planning to create today. He has been briefed along with Draco, and if everything goes to plan today, she won’t learn about anything that she doesn’t need to. Of course, that does mean that progress on the investigation itself is almost non-existent, and despite Harry’s attempts to run into the back room and stare at the charts for a little while every time Rose is particularly absorbed in something, by mid-morning he has achieved nothing but a slightly twisted ankle from tripping over an uneven flagstone.
Harry looks back at the fireplace, at his cup of tea, at the pan on the stove from which delicious savoury smells are emanating.
“No reason,” Harry lies again, looking at Draco’s dishevelled hair and cross expression and deciding to keep his smile and his fingers to himself. At least for now. “Is it really that bad?”
Once out on the street, he takes a moment to adjust to the bustle, hanging back against the façade of the Leaky and breathing in the familiar tang of exhaust fumes and fried everything. When the swan sticks out its neck and almost grabs a passing woman’s ponytail, he forces himself into action. The park is only a couple of hundred yards away and the cold wind in his face is rather bracing as he walks briskly against it, willing the swan to stay put for just a minute or two more. He reaches the tall, wrought iron gates and breaks into a jog, clinging to the box even as its rough edges begin to rub his fingers raw. The pond is in sight, and he can see them.
The words take some of the sting out of Harry’s bitten fingers and he tentatively offers Needle a small bunch of wild grasses. The swan snatches the food and then peers up at Harry, clearly attempting to decide whether or not to bite him again. Finally, he draws away and settles in the snow at Draco’s feet.
“Yes, it matters!” Harry snaps. “We’d already chosen loads of bottles to go with your menu. Why would you keep coming in and looking for really fucking specific things for yourself if you weren’t even going to drink them?”
She seems to weigh almost nothing, even with the additional mass of Montague, who insists on being scooped up along with her. They proceed back through the entrance hall and out to the bus, pressed together for stability. Draco locks the front door with his wand. When Ida is safely laid in a quickly-Transfigured armchair with her friends fussing over her, Draco starts up the bus.
“Oh, good grief,” Draco sighs, casting a murderous glance at the garden before ramming the key into the wooden door and pushing his way inside the tiny building.
Hermione gazes at her daughter. “Rosie, I’m not sure how to argue with that. Come on, we need to get home and have some lunch.” She smiles at Harry. “Thanks for having him. I’m sorry we have to rush off.”
“I understand,” Harry says, stretching his legs out in front of him and attracting the attention of Needle, who comes ambling over and settles himself heavily on his ankles. “Molly gets into a flap over the weirdest things but we all just sort of go with it.”
Harry looks at his half-finished ice cream cone, wondering whether to abandon it or carry on. In the end, deciding that any other course would be mortally offensive to Florean, he licks away the worst of the drips and addresses his audience.
“Pins and needles or interpretive dance?” Draco asks, stretching until his Christmas jumper rides up, exposing a flicker of pale abdomen.
Harry watches as Draco retrieves a little silk bag from his pocket and ties it loosely around Needle’s neck with a ribbon. The bag bounces against Needle’s breast as he reaches up to be stroked.
Someone knew that, and they also knew that Reuben always leaves the door open when he and his staff go to receive deliveries. He’s a trusting sort of man and Harry doubts it would even occur to him anyone might steal from them. He even puts up a little sign that says,
Harry strokes Juno and watches him, wondering whether he should be amused or alarmed by his quicksilver changes of mood. Worryingly, he thinks he might like to see more of them.
“That’s not true, Draco. I heard you complaining a lot,” Harry says, smiling apologetically at the disappointed stallholder and starting back up the alley.
Harry puts his finger to his lips and traces the word with his wand. Together they watch the ‘o’ and the ‘u’ change positions and share a secret grin.
“Oh… yes, right you are, Luna,” he says, face falling as he realises his absent-mindedness. “Well, I suppose you could play a record. You only need someone to carry the player and wind it up.”
Harry notices the way he is noticing the way the soft light makes Draco’s hair and skin glow. He shakes himself.
… but you could improvise!” She picks up more pencils and taps out an energetic beat against the table, her teacup, her empty plate.
He looks around, assuring himself that this part of the loch, at least, is hidden by the trees and that none of the locals will see anything they don’t want to. Once satisfied, he tugs his scratchy jumper over his head and flings it aside. The sun and the breeze are a caress against his prickly skin, and it isn’t long before the rest of his clothes join the tangle of wool on the ground.
