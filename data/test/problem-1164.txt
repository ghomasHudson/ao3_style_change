Trelawney pulled Draco closer. “Of course, dear. I could never ignore what the tea leaves say.”
The Duke of Malfoy had ordered him gone.
“What about my baby?”
“Because the duke wishes it.”
“Back again so soon?” he drawled.
“I don’t need you to tell me about my own damn life.”
“Fuck,” Harry said. “I don’t want you to die.”
Then the servant—
This made Draco think. “Well … it’s the only place I have even an ounce of power.”
He gulped, and tried not to count the steps in his head. “Okay, I think I can do this. I just can’t overthink it.”
Draco went back into the bedroom. He closed and locked the door behind him. On the settee, Harry was upright and carefully sipping tea.
“I want it.” Draco kneeled on the floor. He didn’t know if it was what Harry meant, but he wanted it this way.
Annoyed, the duke slapped his left hand with his riding crop. “I sent Charles out here to fetch you, but you turned him down. The poor boy nearly fainted when he told me of his failure.”
The man blinked several times. “Immediately?”
Malfoy gulped his tea, looking a bit ill. “I tried to … oh, hell. You’ll think I’m a slag.”
“Such a good boy,” Potter murmured, his eyes falling shut.
“It’s Christmas!” Parkinson cried. “Let’s play cards and be merry!”
Harry couldn’t take it anymore. He could no longer deny himself a night with the duke.
Draco leaned closer to Potter. “There are
“Wait! Where are you going?”
“Hello,” he said, sounding grumpy.
Oh, God,
Malfoy blew out air. He went a little tense. “Tell me if you want to stop,” he said, and began to work Harry’s cheek like a ball of dough. It was the sweetest of pains, and Harry felt his touch all the way up to his shoulder.
The things he was feeling … they weren’t nice. They were problematic. He wanted to track Malfoy down, punch his client in the face. He wanted to protect Malfoy, put him on a pedestal. But Malfoy was a person with ambition and pride. Harry had to respect Malfoy’s wishes, and if Malfoy wanted to continue working as a prostitute, then Harry had to accept it. He had to accept that Malfoy didn’t want to be on that pedestal.
“Look at me.”
“Good. Very good.”
Harry tightened his hold in his hair and snapped his hips forward. He was fucking the duke’s mouth, making him choke on his cock. His gaze was glued to the duke’s face. Watching such a powerful man suck his cock called up something savage in him.
“Jesus, Harry.”
“Oh,” Harry whimpered.
The lights went down, and the performance began. Draco tried, but it was impossible to focus on the singers. Instead he eyed Potter like a hawk. At one point, young Lady Greengrass wrapped her gloved hand around his, and Draco barely registered it.
“Mr Potter is studying the Classics. And he’s an assistant to the esteemed Professor Percy Weasley.”
“We all lost people in the war,” Draco said.
Malfoy released him. He took several steps back. He looked like the shell of the man he was before.
Draco slumped down on his settee, still holding his face. He couldn’t stop crying. It’d been months and months since Harry’s death; he thought he was healing; he thought he was beginning to move on. The pain was unbearable.
“That is unfortunate, Your Grace,” Harry said.
“It appears so, dear,” Trelawney answered. She was clear-eyed again. “You’re bleeding. Let’s get a mediwitch to look over you.”
Harry fell into a rhythm, fucking Draco steadily. They stared into each other’s eyes. Draco was mouthing something.
Theo reached across the table to brush his fingers against Draco’s cheek. “You’re the only one who really gets me.”
Harry quickened his steps. The nearest village couldn’t be that far, and if it was, well, he didn’t care.
“I’m not laughing,” Harry said, still grinning widely.
“I will protect you.”
Malfoy and the director left. Harry realised he wasn’t alone in the room. Goyle, Malfoy’s valet, hovered in a corner. He tipped his hat to Harry.
Harry gave her a reassuring smile. “I’m perfectly all right. Nothing’s the matter.”
“Gorgeous,” Draco said, and licked his throat. He reached down to wank Harry lazily. Harry moaned.
“I’m afraid I can’t greet you properly,” Harry said, then added a quick “Your Grace.”
“I’m afraid I don’t follow.”
“Yes, Your Grace.”
They found themselves in Potter’s bed again - starkers again. Draco twisted beneath him, needing more, needing so much more. Eye contact was a challenge.
“Yes,” Harry said slowly.
“That’s preposterous.”
“Other people want you. Let them love you.”
party, blocked bill after bill for poverty reform.
“Right there - oh, just like that.”
“I am not, Your Grace. I am a man.”
Draco was discomforted. He couldn’t stop thinking about the child. He imagined Harry as that child, scrubbing floors just to have a roof over his head. He imagined it and
Harry raised his eyebrows. “So … he supports what you’ve done?”
“Sometimes intent doesn’t matter.”
“Thank you, sir. You are very kind.” She placed the hat on her head and drew the coat around her. “This is very nice, sir. Such lovely fabric.”
“You lust for me. That’s all.”
Draco pulled back just a little. It was difficult to concentrate when Potter was stroking him. “You don’t want me to touch you?”
“There was a man in support of them? How interesting.”
He threw himself into work on his land. He visited Mr and Mrs Gibbs, made sure they had enough firewood and herbs. He spent hours speaking to his managers, asking them personal questions about how they got on with their jobs. It took some needling, but eventually his employees opened up to him.
“He would want you to sleep. He would want you to be healthy.”
They ate together in silence, Malfoy on the bed, Harry in an old chair by the window.
Malfoy gingerly touched his nose. “Perhaps it’s broken as well. It’s definitely swollen.”
Malfoy added a second finger, and it made Harry hiss. Harry wasn’t used to penetration, not like this, and he had been too damn busy with academics to indulge his body.
Malfoy left.
He frowned in embarrassment. “Of course people are talking about it.”
“Tell me you feel the same way.”
“I understand.”
She pressed on, ignoring him. “There’s another thing you must know. It’s the message that brought me here.”
Harry felt the duke’s warm stomach against his hands, felt his muscular back against his chest. The speed and velocity of their journey forced the duke back, his bottom pressed right up against Harry’s groin. There his shapely bottom stayed, virtually grinding against Harry as the horse galloped beneath them.
“BECAUSE I DON’T, POTTER. I’VE BEEN UTTERLY
Malfoy hit him playfully with his serviette. “Don’t speak with your mouth full, you naughty boy.”
“You’re not going to die.”
“Why should I believe you?” he said once he caught his breath.
Harry grasped his hands in front of himself and waited for Malfoy and the director to return. He didn’t have to wait that long. The director looked more harassed than before when he appeared through the double doors of his office.
The man stared at Harry just as intently. The man’s gaze slipped down to his mouth and hot desire sparked in his eyes. The man sucked in a breath.
“Yes,” Potter said, and then slid inside him.
“Just like that, love. Come for me, give me your spunk. You can trust me. Oh, Draco, just like that.
“Are you
Gasping for breath, Draco tried to get up; but Theo immobilized him with a quick
They were greeted by a musty little foyer and low, murmuring cries.
Harry opened and closed his mouth. He ran a hand over his face. He couldn’t explain it, not really, so he said nothing.
This sort of attraction
. It’s disgusting.”
“I don’t know, Potter. Let me ask my lungs and get back to you.”
and Theo yelled
Suddenly, Harry needed to get away. He needed to leave this place, do everything he could to get back to Oxford.
They sat in silence for another long moment. “I have a small present for you,” Potter said, still breathing hard.
“Please. Oh, please.”
Malfoy dragged a finger down Harry’s arm. “Your skin is darker. It’s nice.”
Harry rolled his eyes and ignored his desperate urge to kiss him.
Draco’s expression grew dark. “So it finally comes out. I knew I disgusted you. I
“What are you doing here?”
Draco worked his mouth, hot desire throbbing through him. “I will say anything if it means I can have you.”
“Yes, my love.”
“The instances of women suffering abuse are very small. Only a few instances happen each year. Most women are quite happy being under the control of men. They appreciate the protection.”
Malfoy curled up against him and rested his head on his shoulder. “Is this okay?” he asked quietly.
The man seemed to realise that he was still holding Harry. He released him quickly. All Harry could do was turn and watch the man walk away.
Longbottom poured him the wine. He winked. “It’s on the house.”
A stunned silence fell across the room. When the Parliament Members recovered, a chorus of boos erupted. Some even jumped to their feet and hissed at him. Harry clutched the wall half in front of him. He was terrified.
“I can help you look for a place, if you want.”
The duke was dressed for dinner, his jacket a pretty cerulean. It made his eyes look even stormier.
Then Harry took him deeper, sucking; he gagged when Draco brushed the back of his mouth, but he loved it. He bobbed his head, going fast, and Draco cried out.
“Yes, sir, I can do that for you. It’ll just be a moment.” The man disappeared behind a door.
, Draco just wanted to hold him again. He just wanted to … He’d felt Potter— he’d felt him against his bum on their journey back to the castle. Potter had gone just a little bit hard, and Draco had
“Wow,” Harry said. “Just wow.”
Harry pushed back, wanting his come, wanting his everything. When Malfoy had emptied himself, he thrust again, air escaping his clenched teeth. Harry felt his cock push out its own come.
“Yes.” Harry walked around in the nude, looking for the gown. He was gorgeous starkers, his skin tanned, his muscles well-used. His eyes looked too big until he slid on his glasses.
Draco turned his attention back to Potter. Potter looked barely coherent and his eyes grew wide every time his horse swayed.
“Wow. Were you close with your parents?”
“Yes, Granger,” Lady Parkinson said, continuing the conversation he hadn’t heard. “I do like your plan.”
“I fell ill over the holidays, that is all. The duke … it’s preposterous.”
Potted glanced at him briefly. “You know how much I care about you. Don’t pretend otherwise.”
Malfoy looked at him in surprise. “You called me by my first name.”
“Good morning,” Draco whispered, grinning like a fool.
. England has been good to you, hasn’t she? It is time for you to pay her back.”
Dinner was roasted chicken and veg. Draco sat close. He wanted to feed Harry, but he also didn’t want to go overboard with his care. He wrapped a blanket around Harry as Harry slowly ate some chicken.
“I am late for my morning walk, Your Grace,” Pansy said. She left quickly.
Harry watched him disappear upstairs. He wanted to go after him. He wanted to … fuck, he wanted to do a lot. But Harry didn’t trust himself not to muck it all up.
“Tell me you’re mine,” Malfoy whispered.
” Harry let him slide on the ring, then he pulled Draco into a brief, passionate kiss. “I want to go back to Oxford,” he whispered against his lips. “Please, take me away from this place.”
Malfoy took another step closer. His coat nearly brushed Harry’s. “You don’t want me to touch you?”
Snorting, the duke offered Harry his hand. Harry looked around for a groom or a stable boy. When he confirmed they were alone, he took the duke’s hand.
“You animal,” Potter whispered hotly, and Draco snarled and bit his neck. He pounded him so hard that the bed banged against the wall.
It was half past one when Malfoy stepped from the Floo. Malfoy looked a little rumpled, his face still a little flushed. Harry forced himself into a chair.
Ginny batted her hand at him. “You didn’t miss anything.”
Harry was once again late to a suffragist meeting. This meeting was important, however, and he wasn’t so sure Lady Granger wouldn’t go for his jugular.
The day was hot and sunny, and Harry sunbathed naked on the deck. He had never been so happy in all his life.
“A cup of tea would be nice,” Potter said once he realised Draco wasn’t going to say anything else. He looked Draco up and down, seemingly sizing him up.
“Harder,” Harry whispered.
She raised her eyebrows again. “I thought you were finally beyond that, Malfoy? I know your father left the dukedom in dire straits, but I didn’t think you were cash poor.”
“Do you want it?” Draco whispered hotly in his ear.
She wrapped her arm around his, pulling him close. She smelled intensely of violets. “Do you want to know a little secret?”
Potter pulled a sticky menu closer. “Are you hungry?”
Potter opened his mouth. “It’s not necessary. I’ve felt worse. I just—” Potter paused, his expression going vacant. He wavered in his seat.
Harry pulled out and collapsed on his chest. “Fuck,” he laughed. “That was brilliant.”
Potter shrugged. “We don’t even know each other.”
“No,” Draco said firmly.
The carriage came to a rolling stop. Goyle opened the door and helped them down. The street was chilled and silent. The elegant townhouses leered down at Harry.
Draco went very still. Potter had gone red, his gorgeous eyes still on the plate.
Draco looked up at him with wide, desperate eyes. Harry stroked him quicker, his thumb massaging over his head.
Malfoy moved away momentarily to retrieve a jar of lubrication from his bedside drawer. He slicked up his fingers generously, then pressed one to Harry’s hole.
Potter was obsessed with him; he was virtually
Draco wanted to die along with Father. He wanted to not feel anything. He wanted there to be no more pain.
Malfoy’s arms came around him protectively. “And I’ve missed you.”
But that coat told him it was real. It told him he hadn’t made it all up.
Overnight, Draco’s belly had grown. It was now big, very big; it looked like he was in his third trimester. It looked like he was about to give birth.
The duke began to prowl his room. “You live
Face flushed, Harry stood in front of him. He cupped Draco’s chin and kissed him deeply. Draco gazed up at him worshipfully.
“I’m thinking about power and privilege.”
The horse had dashed from the clearing. “We will mount yours,” Draco said roughly.
“Draco,” he whispered, as his cock filled Malfoy’s mouth with his hot spunk. He watched his cock ruin Malfoy’s mouth, thrusting in and out, some of his semen escaping his lips.
“Pardon?” Draco pulled at his necktie.
“How did you come to be in my house in the first place?” Draco’s voice was low, angry.
Draco gazed up at him with eyes full of love. He barked oh so softly.
“It’s my pleasure,” Parkinson answered. She stared into Granger’s eyes, a little smirk on her face.
Potter brushed his lips against Draco’s. “I choose you,” he murmured, and kissed Draco properly.
Harry blinked several times. He wasn’t sure why Lady Granger was speaking to him and he couldn’t read her expression. Granger had brown eyes and unruly hair, and she exuded an intractable iciness.
“Nott didn’t lie to save my life.”
About an hour later, Doctor Barwald arrived. The worry eased from Gibbs’ face as he escorted the doctor inside.
“Do you think I’m disgusting for letting men bugger me?”
Malfoy perked up. “Yes.”
Sighing, Potter walked across the room. Tension lined his shoulders. “I want more than that, Malfoy -
“Yes, thank you for that.” Dudley smiled widely at him. It wasn’t a nice smile. “You know, I’ve been wondering how you were managing to come up with that much money.”
For a moment Draco just gaped at him. Then he threw his head back and laughed. “What do you think happens when I go off to meet a man, Potter? You think we just drink milk and braid each other’s hair?”
“What is it?” Pansy asked anxiously.
Harry ground his teeth. “This shouldn’t have happened to you.”
“You want me to have a New Year’s Eve party? To find a wife?”
“They don’t hate each other, or I don’t think they do. It’s just that Granger is committed to her causes, and Pansy is committed to having a good time. There was also a point when Granger was engaged to a man … Pansy didn’t like that one bit.”
“It’s not for me. It’s for Mrs Gibbs, my tenant.”
“They are childhood friends,” Granger said coldly.
. He was in labour, that’s all.
Draco sucked in a breath. “Of course.”
“The election is close at hand,” she said in her stern voice. “We cannot wait around for the men in charge to give us freedom; we must take it.”
Potter gulped. “I see.”
A servant rushed from the room.
“Good.” She turned her attention to the rest of the group. “We need a plan. How should we go about gaining access to these gentlemen?”
Potter continued to pace. “It’s ridiculous, it truly is. Lady Granger asked me once again to talk to you about our movement, to try to get you to see life through the eyes of the powerless, but that’s impossible, isn’t it?”
Ginger Hagrid blinked several times. “Sorry?” he said stupidly.
Ginny and Miss Brown were embraced and crying. “I can’t believe it!” Ginny said.
“Hello, love.”
“Nonsense,” Malfoy said. “Absolutely not.”
Potter stopped to gaze at him. Potter’s expression was unreadable.
Draco rocked his hips against the bed as he sucked Potter, taking some of the pressure off his cock. He had never been so turned on.
, Draco thought darkly. He barked and wagged his tail, but Potter didn’t pay him any attention.
“Good,” Draco said, kissing his neck. “Go easy. We don’t want to upset your stomach.”
Draco promptly turned back into a man. “Um,” he said.
“Oh, it doesn’t matter. I’m just glad you’re here now.” He squeezed her hands. “Have you brought Miss Brown with you by chance?”
“Don’t forget
Draco laughed hotly. “Don’t tell me it’s a kink.”
“I believe so.” Draco threw aside the letter and pounced on Harry. Harry laughed, then moaned. Draco dragged his cock against his, rubbing, grinding.
, Draco thought, shivering.
Draco finally raised his head. He glared up at Potter. “Then what’s the problem?”
“I’m going to work tonight.”
He fucked him steadily, entranced, overwhelmed. Draco dug his short nails into his back and held on.
Granger’s gaze snapped to the woman. “Why yes, Miss Weasley. Exactly like dogs.”
Harry’s life, then marry Lady Parkinson, and walk away mostly unscathed.
“A little.”
“Loads of times. The house elves loved to sneak me sweets. One time Mother found biscuit crumbs hiding under the duvet. She wasn’t pleased.”
“Thank you for helping him,” Draco said.
“Oh, no. That’s not it at all. If you must know, it’s the dress. I’m not used to you wearing anything besides your spinster garb.”
It was the day before Christmas Eve, and the sun shined almost brightly through the castle windows. Draco sat at his study desk, a mountain of paperwork and correspondence in front of him. There was even a letter from the Queen waiting unanswered for him.
“You want me to be your whore.”
. He’s never coming back.”
Draco felt his heart tearing into two pieces. It made him turn cold, his facial expression turning glacial. When he was hurt, he pushed the whole world out.
“Christmas is less than a week away,” Ginny said.
As Mrs Gibbs went into further detail about her family, Draco escaped outside to find Mr Gibbs. “Go find Carter, the supplies manager. Tell him to give you a pile of good wood. My orders.”
“Too much?” Draco said. He was smirking but worry touched his tone.
—to touch anything in this room.
, he had argued on the floor of Parliament. It made him ashamed to remember.
He also knew this frustration wasn’t all about Malfoy. He
“Then say yes.” Draco poised the ring at Harry’s finger.
“You still have a whole life ahead of you. It might not feel like it now, but you will find someone else, fall in love again. You will be happy. I promise, Draco.”
Harry wrung his hands in his lap. His heart was beating fast. “I’m trying to make the right decision for both of us.”
He thrust and thrust, chasing his orgasm. Everything seemed bright and beautiful and safe. Draco reached around to touch his arsehole, and Harry cried out and went still. He orgasmed hard, almost violently, his teeth breaking the skin on his bottom lip to stop himself from making loud noise.
Smirking, Draco sucked him deeper, his tongue still moving. He felt Potter stiffen even more; it was the only warning he got before Potter came hard, his spunk filling Draco’s mouth.
“I’m doing it, Potter.” Malfoy’s tone had hardened.
matter, Malfoy. I’ve been petitioning the Wizengamot on your behalf.”
, Draco thought.
“Then why are you glaring at me?”
Potter dragged his lips up and down Draco’s neck. His hand was hesitant, shy, as it tugged him. Draco was quickly losing control.
“Christ, Malfoy!” Harry rubbed his face, still clutching his wand. “I don’t think your baby is going to die but I can’t be one hundred percent sure. I’m not a healer … I just read through some books, that’s all.”
“Of course.”
When Potter appeared in front of his cage, Draco popped up and rushed forward, his tail wagging something fierce. Potter melted at the sight of him.
“We will spend it on Scorpius.”
“There’s no buts! You deserve to rest, Harry. You can’t push yourself too much, you know.”
“St Mungo’s … they wanted to terminate my pregnancy.”
“Oh, wow,” Potter breathed. “I don’t think I’ve ever tasted something so good.”
“You noticed?”
Harry was stiff and leaking. He tugged himself desperately, his pink head fully emerged from his foreskin. Draco leaned in and stuck his tongue out. Harry’s gaze was hot, possessive. His breathing was strained, his teeth biting into his bottom lip.
Harry forced himself to move toward the door. “Follow me if you want that bath.”
“Yes,
In the corner, knitting needles clicked together. They were making a red and gold scarf, a Gryffindor scarf. For a long moment, Draco watched the needles weave the yarn together, his mind an empty cavern. Somehow Harry’s spell was still hard at work. It almost gave him a flicker of hope. Didn’t magic die with the wizard? If those needles were still clicking together, didn’t that mean Harry was still alive?
Harry couldn’t look away. His hand was so elegant, so refined; he stroked him again, his thumb sweeping over the head, gathering the wet there.
Rose perked up. “Oh, yes. It’s a treasure, it is. Follow me.”
Theo looked at him, eyes darker now. “The Ministry. The Aurors. Even … well, I won’t say.”
“Hello, Gibbs. Yes, it is a lovely day.” Draco motioned to Potter. “This is Mr Harry Potter. He’s accompanying me for a ride today.”
“Just like that,” he whispered.
“No.”
That had been yesterday, and Draco rode out with the dawning sun to check on the operations. The air felt like a sheet of ice against his cheeks.
“It reminds me of myself. I also have experience caring for land. My father made sure of it.”
Potter’s eyes fluttered. “The affair lasted six months. It was brilliant in the beginning, of course it was. I felt like I had died and gone to heaven. It was good even after I found out he was engaged to be married. I had no reason to think I could ever compete with a future wife … with a noblewoman who was pure and innocent … while I was just a dirty farm boy.”
“Then, I suppose it would be acceptable.”
When Harry was all the way inside, he captured Draco’s lips again, claiming him. “Yeah?” he breathed.
Trelawney remained in her chair. “I’m terribly sorry. Really, I am. But I cannot leave until I tell you the message. He won’t let me.”
“I don’t care,” Draco gasped. “I won’t let them take my baby!”
“You’re with that group, aren’t you?” said Lord Webbington.
“No, Your Grace.” Harry refused to drop his gaze.
Harry quickened his grinding; he felt Malfoy grow even harder inside him. “Draco,” he said again.
“Hello, Your Grace.”
He thought quickly. It was risky what he wanted to ask for, possibly offensive. “I’m worried about my tenants, ma’am. I know more than a few families will go hungry if I’m occupied elsewhere. This winter will be a tough one.”
A strange, brief expression came over Draco’s face. “Are you disappointed?” Draco said, giving him a slight smirk. “Expecting a hot date?”
Perhaps he could grow to love Weasley, but he didn’t care for Weasley now. That was what mattered.
“Fuck.”
Then Draco understood. Potter was still recovering from an affair, a betrayal.
“And the union would be platonic because they are such good mates and they could never see each other as proper husband and wife?”
? Of course I can do that. I wouldn’t have fetched Maddy Gibbs a doctor or those herbs if I didn’t.”
Harry gulped. He asked, “What do you think will happen to me?”
and it would be best to leave him be. Potter and Ginger Hagrid spent a few hours in the kitchen, drinking wine and murmuring, then they went up to bed. Draco made sure to stand by the doggie gate as Potter passed, staring at him forlornly.
“Truly?” Harry whispered.
“She just wasn’t what I wanted.”
“Oh, no,” she said, frowning deeply. “I’ve suddenly lost my train of thought … my memory’s so poor, sir.”
To please the Queen, Draco invited young Lady Astoria Greengrass. She was barely out of her teens, a pretty girl, but she seemed petrified in Draco’s presence.
“That’s not funny,” Harry said, yanking away. He shook all over. “That’s not funny at all.”
“I am safe.”
Arching an eyebrow, Malfoy said, “Oh, yes, Potter. I’m available. Please close the door and step inside. Lie down on the massage table. I’ve already cast the cushion charms on it.”
Mind decided, Draco leapt from his chair, startling Goyle who had been snoozing in a corner. “I’m going to the library,” Draco said, not bothering to say which one. “I’m going to the library, but I don’t expect to be there long. You should dress for the outdoors.”
“No bow this time?”
“Yes.” Theo dropped his hand and sighed. “They chucked us into Azkaban because of things our families made us do. They didn’t care about our well-being; they wanted us dead. They wanted us
offended you.”
“Yes, but perhaps that acquaintance is enough to get us close to Malfoy. Maybe Lady Parkinson could invite us to tea and involve a group of the MPs … it would serve as the perfect opportunity for us to plead our case.”
The common room in the ladies’ college, Lady Margaret Hall, would’ve been a perfect place to hold the meeting except for Harry’s presence. Men weren’t allowed in the college, especially not at political activism gatherings. Hence their need to meet at the Randolph Hotel.
She continued to study him. “Does it make you uncomfortable? I don’t want you to suffer. That’s not my intention. Tell me now, and I will call off the task.”
“And he didn’t keep the money, either.” Goyle rubbed at his nose. “Sounds to me like he’s being blackmailed.”
“You heard me,” Draco growled.
There was a four poster bed with emerald velvet curtains and an intricately woven carpet on the floor. There was a fireplace, and two comfy chairs. There was a writing desk that looked ancient but well-polished. He had absolutely no business sleeping in a room like this.
The ladies stared at one another. Harry crossed his arms and gazed up at the ceiling, thinking hard.
Draco advanced on him. He crowded him against the desk. He wanted to strangle Potter, he really did.
“Your garden is nice,” Malfoy said a moment later.
“If we ever make love, I want it to be because you really want it, not because you feel you must.”
Malfoy glanced over his shoulder. “His name is Goyle. I trust him with my life.”
“What is his name?” Harry asked, not sure if he could speak to the man directly.
, Harry thought to himself. In the west, the sky was aflame with the setting sun.
Harry hesitated. “Do you want to go to the Aurors about your attack?”
“Even though I’m pregnant?”
“Tell me what to do to make it right.”
“Chasteberries … chamomile … mugwort.”
“Yes,” Harry said truthfully.
“Would it be all right if we dropped in for a visit with Mrs Gibbs?” Potter asked. “Right now?”
Lady Granger and Ginny were nice enough to visit him. They had tea in the parlour, the servants barred from entering. Harry sipped his tea and avoided their eyes.
Harry looked over his shoulder. The road was dark now, the air even icier. The Duke of Malfoy was right: He wouldn’t make it to the nearest village before it started to snow.
Huffing, Dursley stuffed his hand into his pocket and shoved the contents at Draco. “Satisfied?”
“It’s not so different than shagging a girl.”
He seemed to be looking at Harry more, stealing glances when he thought Harry wasn’t paying attention. Harry wasn’t dumb; he knew what it meant when a man seemed unable to stop his gaze from trailing off to land on him.
“YOUR OFFICE!” Ronaldo dashed from the house, not even bothering to close the front door.
The side door banged open, revealing Goyle. Goyle’s face darkened when he saw the woman. She tried to run but he grabbed her.
“Make you?”
Malfoy worked along his left arm, then slipped to the other side to work down his right arm. Harry’s eyes fluttered. It felt so damn good.
The duke was drooling. He was making a mess, his aristocratic gaze half-closed and blissed-struck. Moaning again, he began to bob his head, going deeper on each downward glide of his mouth.
“You get lost before I turn your sorry arse into the police!”
“Thank you, ma’am.”
“I’m sure you are a scholarship man.”
She looked him up and down, and he knew her sharp gaze didn’t miss a single detail about his appearance. “Lady Granger and Miss Brown were just telling me how you dared to approach the Duke of Malfoy like he was a mere mortal.”
“Yeah … the whole establishment is Muggle, but it’s close to the Ministry so a lot of our kind come here.”
“She wants me to marry.”
“Yes.”
“Of course, Harry,” Dudley said. “I’m sure you’ve been working a great deal.”
, he wanted to say, but he couldn’t. She had too much power, and he couldn’t trust her to not be offended. He didn’t want to do anything that would embarrass the duke.
, Draco thought, frustrated. He tore off the duvet and licked his way down Potter’s stomach. Potter laughed and tried to push him away.
think I have a strange man hiding in my house?”
“What are you doing?” Harry murmured.
“The truth is I’m mortified,” he admitted.
Once everything was placed next to the tree, Draco ordered the servants out. One of them lingered.
Draco listened for the trailing footsteps while telling himself he was doing no such thing. Trelawney was full of shit; everyone knew that. She had been a terrible professor, a terrible seer. Everyone knew they couldn’t trust what she said.
Goyle gently touched his arm. “There are a million like that one, Your Grace. Please come along.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, “but you must go now. I insist.”
Carter had a small army of men counting out the bundles and wrapping them together with twine.
Draco kissed the Horcrux scar on his chest. “I can’t believe it took us this long to shag.”
The building was squat and blackened, its windows punched-out eyes. The entire place reeked of desperation.
“Wait,” Harry murmured. “I still need to see.”
Malfoy looked
him to leave.
“I want to have your baby,” Draco whispered hoarsely. Then he was also coming - writhing beneath Harry, his hands grasping desperately at his shoulders.
A golden bubble had appeared around Draco’s stomach. It pulsed like something living.
Sighing, Goyle looked at Draco. “I leave you alone for only a few minutes and you manage to lose your coat and hat. That must be a record.”
“Yeah ... the coffee is awful here but it’s close to where I work.” Theo put his hand on the empty chair.
“I have a message from Harry,” she said softly.
“Well, I appreciate you for much more than that.”
.” Dudley’s smile dimmed. “I told you not to get into funny business again.”
“Is it worse?” Malfoy asked softly.
Laughing, Potter said, “Oh, yes, I do. The way those people stared at me last night? It made my skin crawl.”
He tried not to think of Potter. He tried not to remember him—his smell, his laughter, his intelligence.
“Draco,” the duke murmured.
“Don’t you dare have a laugh at my expense,” Malfoy said.
“Yes,” Harry said, voice equally as quiet. He cleared his throat and forced himself to raise his head. He looked into the duke’s stormy gaze. “You shouldn’t have bought it for me. I—I don’t deserve something so nice.”
The Queen was still agitated. “Those women—those
Using another spell, they cooled down the meat mixture, then poured it into the prepared pastry. Then they topped it with the mashed potatoes, but Malfoy grabbed Harry’s wrist in the process and cried, “Wait! Too much potato ruins
Harry laughed and shook his head. “No, no. Couldn’t be. It would have been quite impossible to be engaged, if you know what I mean.”
), Potter looked up. A lovely pink tinted his cheeks. “I’m sorry, Your Grace.”
“Sort of.”
“All right,” Harry said, annoyed. “I shall stay for the Christmas holidays.”
Leaving his chair, Draco marched over to the desk. He wasn’t quiet about it. The man must’ve been exhausted not to wake up.
“Yes, of course,” Draco said gruffly, and forced himself to continue walking. His mind was reeling. Potter was here with another man—quite possibly a date. Draco ground his teeth.
Harry met Weasley’s eyes, and a private understanding passed between them. The look said,
A frown. “Because you are the bravest person I know.”
She reached out a hand to him. “I need you to touch me.”
“Because we are still strange to one another?”
Potter shared a look with Mr Gibbs. “She’s suffering from stomach pains—cramps. She said she has a history of terrible menstruation pain but this time it was quite worse.”
Draco sighed and set down his fork. “Why are we even doing this, Potter? This whole situation is useless.”
Then the duke did something astonishing: He removed his hat and lowered to a knee. He pressed his hat to his chest as he said, “I was wrong to order you to leave my home. I made an assumption, and that assumption was wrong. I had no idea you were a guest of Lady Parkinson’s. For all of it, I am deeply sorry.”
No, it wasn’t perversion. It was beautiful. It was …
Thankfully he was in the hallway just outside his room when this exchange happened (Harry had long ago removed all the paintings from his bedroom for this exact reason). He didn’t know what to do with himself and his room was entirely too small for all the emotions storming inside him.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”
Hot tears rolled down Draco’s cheeks. “That wasn’t our first date. That was just a … preliminary meeting.”
“Yes and no. When I was a very young man, there was a summer when I made it a habit of visiting, how should I say this, a house that lacked respectability. People found out, and I had my men quickly squash the story.”
“I suppose.”
“Ginny Weasley.” She took his hand, and he was relieved to feel calluses on her palm. He wasn’t the only one in the group used to hard manual work. “It’s bloody cold, isn’t it?”
Draco cried out—loud. Harry clapped a hand over his mouth. “We aren’t in your gigantic castle,” Harry whispered. “You must be very, very quiet for me, or you’ll alert the landlord.”
“Are you really dead?”
“Please,” Draco said, voice cracking. He would be begging Harry for the rest of his life, he knew it now.
They stopped in a small clearing to give their horses a break. Potter was distant, his smile now wiped clean off his face. He seemed to want to flinch when Draco moved too close.
“You looked like you were enjoying her company a great deal.”
They took a carriage to St Giles, the rain now coming down in blinding sheets. Draco could barely make out the murky buildings outside the window.
“I am here about Mr Potter,” Draco said coldly.
“I suppose so …” Harry turned his attention back to the clothes. “Now show me what I must wear.”
“Yes, Your Grace,” said the servants. With their help, Potter staggered to his feet.
The servant left. The man fell back against the wall, nearly becoming one with the shadows. It was rather odd how servants made themselves invisible around the duke.
“Hold tight,” said Malfoy.
After his terrible day, Harry slumped back on the bed, and closed his eyes. He felt bone tired, utterly exhausted. Sleep overwhelmed him, even though he lay defenceless in a duke’s bed, his wet cock left out for any servant to see.
Gibbs took off running.
“I’ve been working for it!”
Weasley looked up from his paperwork and smiled hesitantly. He had a nice smile. “I might have noticed that you are not eating …”
Draco dropped his gaze. “Isn’t it obvious? I’m his
“I want your hat.”
He was in love with Malfoy, that was the truth of it.
“For a man who the Queen highly trusts, you sure make terrible decisions.”
“Fine,” Draco said, fidgeting a little. He didn’t remember Longbottom being this attractive. “A mulled wine would be lovely.”
“Oh, hello,” Draco said. He didn’t look rumpled this time.
Ignoring the outrage, Draco persisted with his speech. “The women of Britain deserve a say in their future, in their country’s future. Too many are battered by the very men who should protect them. Too many fall into poverty because they married the wrong men. The women of Britain deserve equality; they deserve equity. The fight for women's suffrage has gone on for centuries, and today I announce my official support for the cause. The women of Britain will win this fight. I intend to help them. I therefore propose a bill to amend the Married Women’s Property Act of 1870.”
Potter’s face went pink again. His eyes went a bit lidded, too. “You know we can’t do this, don’t you?”
Harry opened his mouth eagerly. He couldn’t believe this was actually happening. Their tongues brushed together, and Draco tasted like grapes.
London had shaken off its chilly clouds and bright sunlight filled the streets. Spring was right around the corner.
“Peppermint ….” Potter said, voice full of disbelief.
Malfoy’s breath stuttered. “Turn over, my love,” he said, his voice pure gravel. Shivering, Harry did what he was told.
is what all these spells have been hiding,” Malfoy said, satisfied with himself.
“No - I’m - I don’t want you to see.”
them, if you will.”
“How may I help you, sir?” he repeated.
of him.
“Do you not want your bone tonight? Are you not hungry?” Potter cooed.
“Yeah, I did.”
The servant returned along with an enormous man with bulging biceps.
“Yes, Your Grace!” The housekeeper curtsied and rushed off.
“Tell me,” Malfoy said, voice trembling. “Was he locked up in a cell?”
“Brilliant,” he breathed, and drew him into a gentle kiss. It was a lovely first kiss.
“No, Goyle. Let’s head to St Giles. Perhaps we will have luck there.”
“It’s better than them outwardly disgracing you, is it not?”
“Are you paying?”
“What is it, boy?” Potter asked sleepily.
He was nearly giddy when he reached the library that held Potter. He threw open the doors, startling the young man just as he had startled poor Goyle.
Hours passed in a blur. Harry’s legs gave out and slumped on the cold, wet ground. He couldn’t fall asleep, or else he would wake up with no boots, no shirt, and no glasses. He would especially not wake up with a coat, but he needed his glasses more than the rest of the lot.
“Right,” he said, and headed for his steed.
“You know more about this place than I do. Most people do. I don’t want to do anything
Harry gulped. He looked down at his hands. “I should tell you that I’m not … I’m in the process of getting over someone.”
“Please, dear. Have a seat.”
The next night Malfoy asked if they could make supper together. Harry agreed. Earlier that day, Harry had popped over to Tesco for some groceries, and now they had everything to make steak and kidney pie.
“Lay down on the bed, will you?”
“Do you think we should stop?” Ginny said anxiously.
Harry saw a few men eyeing his nice coat. The fabric alone was worth a fortune, and he knew if he wasn’t careful he could get his throat cut for it.
“Did everything go all right?”
Draco and Goyle weaved their way down tight thoroughfares that were more rivers of mud and muck than streets. An awful stench clouded the air.
Draco stood. “Yes, you did. And all I’ve ever wanted was to pay you back.”
They twirled along with the other dance couples. Ginny’s dress had a lovely yellow skirt that whirled through the air like a sunbeam. Her brown eyes twinkled at him, and he smiled broadly.
Potter snorted. “Modesty doesn’t suit you, I don’t think.”
A week passed in darkness. One cold morning, Draco took his steed out for an exhilarating run. He pushed his steed hard, his mind hyperactive, his emotions overwhelming. He tried to outpace his heartbreak; but then his steed hit a few misplaced rocks on the ground, and Draco soared through the air.
“Yes,” Malfoy said quietly.
Harry looked at Granger for a moment. Granger was still stern, still serious; but she had a big heart. “Thank you, Lady Granger,” he said.
Draco rolled on top of Potter. He pinned his arms above his head. “Permission to blow your mind?”
“Good,” Malfoy said, his beautiful mouth curling in a smirk. Harry nearly fainted; that smirk was pure gorgeous filth.
“Sounds lovely,” Draco said. “We shall do it.”
Theo dropped to a knee next to him, entirely casual. Smiling, he brushed a bit of fringe from Draco’s forehead.
“Yes, Your Grace,” he said obediently, but he didn’t sound optimistic.
Draco stared blankly at him. If Potter had been any other man, Draco was sure he would have thrashed him. Several seconds passed before Draco could speak. “Why are you here?”
Swollen eyes blinked up at him. “Help me,” Malfoy said through bloodied lips.
“I suppose,” Malfoy said.
Draco sucked in a breath. “Your cousin?”
There was an awkward silence.
“He is,” Trelawney said, and she touched a bejeweled hand to her chest. “I felt him leave when Theodore died. He refused to cross over until he knew you were safe.”
Secretly Harry disagreed. Draco was more stunning than ever. He virtually glowed now, and the extra weight looked good on him. All those faceless clients were eager to shag Draco because Draco was drop dead gorgeous. He was
Malfoy worked his thumbs into Harry’s shoulders. Harry gasped loudly. “Just breathe,” Malfoy murmured.
?” Harry was barely awake, but he was still shocked. He sighed and reclined further against his pillows. “Yes, all right. How could I say no to the duke?”
“Potter wasn’t good for you anyway. He was a Gryffindor, remember. He was … he didn’t understand our kind.”
Draco tapped on the ceiling and the carriage came to a halt. He glowered at Dursley. “Give me your word you will leave Harry alone. No more blackmailing, no more allowance payments. If Harry wants to speak to you, he will initiate the contact.”
For a moment, Harry just gaped at him. Then he hurried to the bathroom to spell on the bathtub. When the water was ready, he hurried back to Draco.
“Yeah.”
Gently, Malfoy dotted Harry’s forehead with the warm flannel. It felt really nice. Harry sighed and relaxed against the pillow.
“Sit down, Harry. We are talking business.”
Theo laughed, and it was such a terrible sound. His footsteps crunched on broken glass; Draco could barely see his outline; it appeared Theo was posed in the hole in the window, ready to jump.
Dursley’s gaze was wide, searching, desperate. Big beads of sweat escaped his hat. After a long, tense moment, he cried, “Fine! Let me out! You won’t hear from me ever again!”
The small crowd in the room took their seats. Harry wished Malfoy were in front of him, not sitting in the same row. He would have to turn his head fully to the left to get a glimpse of him, and he definitely couldn’t do that. He heard the nobility behind him shuffle their feet, cough into their hands. He felt on display, even though he could not confirm if they were looking at him.
“Yes, Your Grace.” The servant turned her kind eyes to Harry. “Come along, sir. We will prepare your room now.”
“Please let me in,” she said in that distant voice. A bit of drool escaped her slack bottom lip.
“It was a heart attack. She never recovered after Father died in Azkaban.”
Stupidly, Harry felt tears burn his eyes. “I’m sorry, Your Grace.” He twisted his hands in his lap. “I shouldn’t have made myself a problem for you. I failed Lady Granger and the movement. Do they even know what became of me?”
“It’s right confusing, it is,” Goyle said, “but Mr Potter knows how to take care of himself.”
“You are no longer welcome in my home, Harry. You are a walking scandal … a walking deviant. I’m afraid to let you be around my children.”
The canteen served early dinner and Draco’s shift went until seven so he could help clean everything up. He called in sick just so he would be available at five.
They wrapped red and gold ribbons around the tree, their fingers brushing, Draco standing so close to Potter that his chest touched Potter’s back. Draco paused several times to breathe in the scent of Potter’s hair.
“How much do you want?”
Harry’s cheeks were burning. He dropped his head forward, trying to gather his wits. The truth was he was very, very smitten with the duke. The man had read him
“I can’t stay in bed. Too much to do.”
“Yes, but you are also the Duke of Malfoy! You—You—women want to
The plan was to march until they hit Parliament, then go inside to petition the lawmakers. As they moved closer, the police drew their weapons.
“Yes,” Malfoy said, his cheeks now a little pink. “It feels nice.”
“Everything hurts.”
Malfoy fell into a hard, pounding rhythm. Their flesh smacked together, and it sounded loud and filthy in the lavish room.
Harry ground his teeth. “
“You slept in hay?”
Weasley looked away. “I will be most grateful if you do find him. It is Harry’s choice, of course.”
Theo looked confused. “Pardon me?”
Draco’s kitchen was no bigger than a shoebox. He Summoned a bottle of wine - elven, made with elderberries - and poured each of them a serving.
“Why are you tied up like that?”
“They are your friends, your relatives.”
“We shouldn’t have done this,” Harry said. “Your clothes …”
On the other side of Harry was Miss Lavender Brown along with her matronly chaperone. The chaperone, Mrs Bleakman, looked quite unhappy to be at the meeting. Miss Brown gave him a warm smile.
Draco stood tall, his hands still behind his back. He raised his chin. “I don’t care.”
The bartender approached him. “What can I get you tonight?”
The clerk rang a bell and another set of guards hauled Harry from the chamber. They moved quickly, going deeper inside the penitentiary. The air became mustier, colder. Harry’s heart was pounding hard in his chest and cold sweat broke out along his skin. He was surely doomed.
He had only known glimpses of happiness. First, with the son of a viscount. Then here at Oxford and then in the arms of a duke. Mere seconds of bliss. He should feel fortunate to have even got a taste. People like him were born in darkness and died in darkness.
Potter and Ginger Hagrid emerged from the bedroom a moment later.
“Oh, wow. What else did he say?”
Miss Weasley rushed toward Harry. “Are you all right?”
“No,” Draco said weakly.
Malfoy lay back on the pillows. “Just leave me here. I’ll be all right.”
“I’m not - I like men, Malfoy.”
,” Draco whispered wetly. He shook all over. He wanted to race after him. He wanted to go with him.
“You made it back, Your Grace.”
It didn’t take them long to reach the poorhouse, but the walk felt like an eternity to Draco.
Harry peeked up at him. “Yeah?”
Harry had to blink several times. The question had come from a middle aged woman two seats down from him. Her hair was pinned back severely and a diamond necklace glittered menacingly around her neck.
Malfoy cracked his eyes open. “Not St Mungo’s. Good.” He slumped forward, his head resting on Harry’s shoulder.
“Mr Potter.”
“Please.” Draco couldn’t stop saying the word.
More gasps. Harry opened his mouth to continue, but the duke cut him off.
Draco let himself grind his teeth a little. “That will be nine sickles, sir.” Potter handed him the coins, their hands brushing. Draco ground his teeth harder.
It was a little while later when Harry heard another horse approach. By this time, Harry was shivering, his hands and nose chilled.
“Sort of.”
“Are you sure?” Draco said delicately.
The baton whacked him in the shoulder. It came down a second time, and Harry grabbed it in the air, forcing it down and away from his body. This caused the policeman to cry out in pain; a fist came soaring at Harry’s face, but he blocked it.
For a second, Draco allowed himself to think of the man. Raven-haired. Gorgeous green eyes. A lush mouth that looked desperate for a kiss, or something to suck.
Harry frowned. “Are you sacking me?”
Harry pulled almost all the way out, then he slammed back in. “Tell me you’re mine.”
“Thank you,” Draco said, blushing a little. “Have you been well these past couple of years, Longbottom?”
, Harry told himself sternly. He had no business having those thoughts, especially about a duke. The class difference alone made the thought utterly ridiculous.
Sniffling, she said, “You are too kind, sir. Too kind.”
“Yes,” Theo said, voice low. Without looking at him, Theo handed him a little scrap of parchment. “It’s my Floo coordinates. I hope you will fire-call me when you’re ready.”
Biting his lip (
“But he will want to be involved in our campaign?”
Laughing dully, Potter pulled away. “There. I’ve told you my truth. Now you know you should stay away from me.”
Shuddering, Draco did what he was told. Harry cast a lube spell, then brushed two fingers against his hole. His eyes fluttered: Draco was already prepped, already ready. He was even a little loose.
Before Harry’s brain could catch up, he thrust a leaflet at the man. “Amend the Married Women’s Property Act, sir?”
Harry could come from this if he stroked himself, but he remained obedient and left his poor cock untouched.
“And so it is,” Draco said. “Sit down next to me.”
“Sure,” Malfoy said, and it was obvious he was trying but failing to sound casual.
“Fine, we accept your invitation,” Granger said, looking angry and unsure. Miss Brown and Ginny grinned at each other.
In the hallway cupboard, knitting needles still clicked together. Every now and then, Draco opened the cupboard to find an explosion of newly-made Gryffindor scarves. He paid the subscription fee on the charm because he never wanted the needles to run out of gold and red yarn.
. He wore charcoal robes that clung to his lithe body. The robes were perfectly tailored with rows of shiny buttons down the sides. His hair was slicked back with his fringe left to fall delicately into his eyes. His cologne smelled of mahogany and apples, and it reached for Harry even from across the kitchen.
“Spit it out,” Malfoy said.
Malfoy shrugged.
“The cells here fall short of any standards set by the Home Office,” Malfoy growled. “Too filthy, too cold, and unacceptably crowded.”
“A spell,” Draco said, teeth gritted. He was very pale in the face.
Harry thought, stretching in his chair. He needed to close his eyes for a moment—just for a moment. He rested his head on his folded arms. He fell asleep.
He’d done enough cowering in Azkaban.
After about an hour, they stopped to drink some cool lemon-flavoured water. They sat in the soil with their backs against the garden wall, shoulders touching. Heat spilled off Malfoy’s work-warm skin.
Anyone calling Harry
Harry kissed him desperately, breathing his pants. “I’m close,” he whined.
Draco stiffened. The disappointment was almost unbearable. When he managed to speak, he said, “You shouldn’t be here. It’s not right. You deserve to be at peace.”
The duke was stronger than he looked for he easily hauled Harry onto the horse.
Ginny frowned. “Percy understands that one needs rest. And think of it this way—if you take the time to rest now, you will be strong enough to give my brother one hundred and ten percent once the new semester begins.”
Two other police grabbed Harry from behind, immobilising him. All the fight left his body, and Harry slumped forward as the officers cuffed him.
, he thought.
He knew now Malfoy was what he was looking for. He wanted Malfoy in a way he’d never wanted anyone. He would do anything to make Malfoy happy, to protect him. He would do anything to help him through this pregnancy.
, Draco thought. “I’m otherwise occupied, ma’am.”
“Then, yes,” Draco said carefully. “They were lovers years ago, when we were all still teenagers.”
“No barley or whiskey; definitely no cash. Do I make myself clear, Malfoy?”
“All right, come inside,” he said.
He groaned internally. “Yes, ma’am?”
“Good day, Your Grace,” he said cheerfully. “It’s Christmas.”
Unable to speak, Draco helped him into the bath. Harry moaned low in his throat as the water came up to his shoulders.
When they arrived at the conservatory, a thought occurred to Harry. He looked around suspiciously. “Where is your man who follows you about?”
Pansy smirked delightedly. “You gave him your coat to wear? The scandal!”
Draco needed to have
“I’m not used to lazing about in bed. I’m especially not used to being visited by a duke when I’m still in my bed clothes.”
“And?” Harry bit out.
“Yes,” Draco said, and captured his lips in a kiss. Harry moaned and opened his mouth; their tongues moved together. The sensation made Draco whimper in need.
Draco couldn’t believe they had finally slept together. He had lost hope that it would ever happen, especially after their conversation in the carriage. But the man loved him—Draco had seen it plainly last night. Harry loved him, even if he didn’t want to accept it.
From the outside, the conservatory looked like an elaborate goblet. Its walls and ceiling were made entirely out of reflective glass. A dome sat on its head like a crown.
“No. My mother died young and my father was a stupid man who made disastrous financial decisions.”
“I know that.”
Draco pressed closer again. “Tell me what he is to you.”
the right decision.”
“Right.”
Potter panted in his ear. “Malfoy.”
Groaning, Harry kissed him again and again. He retrieved his lube and slicked up his fingers. Staring into Draco’s eyes, he worked a digit inside him.
He would pack his things, then go down to the kitchen. There had to be hired chefs or servants who planned to leave once the party was over. If all went to plan, Harry would hitch a ride with them to Hawthorne, then he would take a carriage to the nearest train station. He was determined to get back to Oxford as soon as possible.
They didn’t make much progress. “We just need one,” Granger growled. “Just one … then the rest will fall, too.”
Draco gritted his teeth. Goyle was only confirming his worst fear. “Why do people come to London? The common man, I mean.”
For a moment, the duke looked at Harry as if he were a specter. His icy gaze was wide, his cruel lips parted.
“Send our dinner to my room,” Draco told the housekeeper. “Also make sure we have enough firewood to last through the night. I don’t want to be disturbed.”
“You don’t deserve to be in here,” Potter said.
“Of course you’re not,” Potter said. “Most people who do harm in this world aren’t.”
“You are the only person who thinks I deserve anything good in this world.”
He worked for some time before his eyesight began to fail him. He needed to move closer to the fire, or ask for a gas lamp to be lit. He rested his elbows on the desk and pushed up his glasses. He rubbed his eyes hard, cursing them. His eyes had always been poor and he knew he’d been straining them too much. Oxford didn’t care if your letted room had no window and was as dark as a cupboard.
But of course he would. Just yesterday, he had been snogged breathlessly by the duke. Just yesterday, they had almost torn off each other’s clothes in the wet and muddy snow.
“You were right,” Potter murmured. “I shouldn’t have tried to walk to Hawthorne.” His face was pale, sweaty; his eyes were now barely open.
Potter’s eyebrows were raised. “Do you have an experience like mine?”
“It doesn’t matter because he’s …” Draco couldn’t say it, his voice raw.
She laughed softly. “Did you really try to walk all the way to Hawthorne in a snowstorm?”
“I don’t understand your question.”
“You needn’t come ….”
“How did she …” Harry trailed off.
Harry shrugged. “It’s the birthplace of the Classics. I would love the opportunity to visit.”
They were properly cuddling now, and neither of them pointed it out. Harry moved his hand up and down Malfoy’s back, loving how he felt the heat of his skin through his shirt. He also loved how he felt Malfoy melt against him.
“I love you,” Malfoy said.
Draco had never had another man inside him, but he wanted Potter inside him. He wanted a commoner to bugger him until he didn’t know himself … until he didn’t know anything.
“I understand,” Barwald said. “Well, I’ll see what I can do for her. Have you given anything to her for the pain?”
“He wasn’t mistaken.”
Draco reached for his hand. “It hurts, Harry,” he whispered. “I feel the baby moving - it’s coming out.”
“No.”
“You’re so hard for me,” Harry said. This made Draco arched into him. Draco fucked himself on Harry’s cock, rocking his hips, and it felt utterly divine. It felt like his arse was made for Harry.
“Any change?” Harry said.
Potter had looked amazed, those gorgeous emerald eyes staring at Draco. Potter’s mouth had been pink from the bitter air, his whole body chilled. Draco wanted to take care of him. He wanted him to never be cold again.
Tears burned down Draco’s cheeks. “It was so difficult to let you in. I don’t know if I can do it for someone else.”
“It looks good,” Draco said to change the subject.
“I’m afraid not, Your Grace.” Gibbs thought for a moment. “I’ve got a piece of coal … a bit of newspaper. That should do.” He went inside to fetch these things and promptly came back.
Draco truly looked
“I’m going to come.”
“Please don’t tell me it’s something expensive. I couldn’t accept it.”
Harry frowned at her retreating back. Of course he wasn’t going to break items. He doubted he would have the nerve to even touch anything in here.
“Nothing but black wood and dark green fabrics,” Draco said seriously.
Gibbs nodded politely, fat beads of sweat dotting his forehead. “I’m pleased to meet you, sir. I don’t mean to rush or nothing, but it’s my Maddy, Your Grace. She’s not doing good, I’m afraid to say.”
. I won’t hear a single bad word said about him.”
He clutched his head, blocking out the sunlight. Harry couldn’t be gone … it wasn’t possible. He was meant to live forever; he was meant to always win. He was the hero in the story.
“Brilliant.” Harry found he couldn’t tear his gaze away from Malfoy’s face. “Do you need anything else?”
“No, I don’t want it.” Draco was already distracted. He spotted dirty stables at the corner. “Harry wasn’t a horse person, but perhaps … ?”
“Keats,” Harry breathed.
“I’m bringing up the subject in case you want help. I can draw you a bath, help you bathe.”
Grinning, Harry directed a plate to hover in Malfoy’s lap. He sent cutlery his way, too. “Dig in.”
“Your … Potter. He could have done something; he could have saved us all. He chose to just save you.”
Shuddering, Draco set down the glass. “I have no business being here.”
The duke was watching him. “What was it about the songs that moved you?”
Draco grinned down at him. “Good.”
Harry cast a shampoo spell, then worked the citrusy soap through Malfoy’s soft hair. Malfoy made a satisfied noise, so Harry massaged his head, then his neck. Malfoy’s mouth dropped open and he made a full on groan.
Again, what was he doing in the company of these people?
Harry hadn’t a clue where he intended this conversation to go. He was unsettled, and his strange questions proved it. He didn’t want the Duke of Malfoy to have a preference for him. He wanted the man to be utterly unattainable. He wanted to remain in the realm of safety.
Potter shook his head mutely.
“Get off the steps! Disperse immediately, or you will be arrested!”
Inhaling a shuddering breath, Draco forced himself to look at the stage. Right, they were there for an opera. Right, Draco was in
“You are as cold as ice. You’re
“Yes - a spell. It’s supposed to help with the birth.”
“They are beneath you. All those gentlemen are half the man you are.”
Encouraged, Draco fucked him quickly, desperately. He fucked him with absolutely no thought of stopping. All Potter could do was hold on and take it.
.” Lady Parkinson laughed behind him.
,” Potter said slowly, testing out the word.
“Yes.”
“God, no.”
He was blind to the street congestion. He didn’t even smell the horse shite on the ground. He couldn’t take Professor Weasley up on his offer, could he? It was unthinkable. He wasn’t the type of person to sleep with people to get ahead in life. If he had been that type, he would already be living in the duke’s townhouse, decked out in silk and drinking his weight in champagne.
Groaning, Draco pulled out a little and pushed back in. Harry was so tight, so warm. The pleasure made his vision blur.
“No.” Harry lifted his face to look deeply into his eyes. “You are so much better than any fool who can’t get past the Mark on your arm.”
“I insist.” The duke shouldered out of his coat and handed it to Harry. Very delicately, Harry put it on. A sweet mahogany scent engulfed him.
Humming, Harry moved to suck and bite the other one. “You may do whatever you want to me,” Harry whispered.
“Isn’t it strange His Grace remains single?”
“No.” Draco put his back to the window and stalked closer to the bed again. “Especially not when we are alone in your room.”
“It appears I am,” the duke said. He turned to Harry and rested a claiming hand on his shoulder. “I wish I could share a dance with you. I wish I could hold you close, breathe in your scent, listen to your voice, as we let the music pull us under its spell. All those people in there would see us, see my feelings for you, and they would know you are mine.”
“I have a cousin who has a history of blackmailing my lovers and you are a man with much to lose.”
Malfoy was watching him with great interest. “Tell me who it was.”
“Is it because he’s not a duke? Is it because you can be anonymous when you are with him?”
Once again, they had spent the day working in the garden, and Malfoy had a pink sunburn on his nose.
Unfortunately they were seated in direct eyesight of Potter and his date. Potter was looking around with interest, eyes bright, almost happy; then his gaze fell on Draco and he stiffened in his seat.
“I haven’t clue who that is,” Draco said, his nose in the air.
“Yes.” Harry struggled to his feet. Draco scooped him up into his arms. Huffing a laugh, Harry said, “I could get used to this.”
Harry shook his head, his eyes still closed. “I’m afraid,” he whispered.
“She will not do it,” Granger said flatly.
herbs, Your Grace,” Mrs Gibbs said. “They are for you and yours, not for me.”
Smirking, Malfoy said, “Yeah? What are you going to do if I don’t stop?”
“Oh, yes, Your Grace!” Carter looked excited. “The other men and I have done good work this last day. We’ve done even more work at home, trying to keep the surprise from our wives.”
Harry wanted to go straight to him, but he stopped himself. This was the duke’s party, and he had many, many guests to attend to. He didn’t need Harry hovering around him like a socially awkward ghost.
“Potter.” Malfoy was breathless now. Harry peeked up at him and found him flushed. There was obvious desire in his face.
. It’s a nice look for you.”
Draco nodded. He knew that Everton was a swindler. He looked at Potter. “Stay with Gibbs. I will return promptly.” He turned his steed and headed for the field over where he knew he’d locate one of his trusty managers. He would send the manager to Hawthorne with orders to bring Doctor Barwald to Maddy and John Gibbs’ house.
“I’ll teach you,” she said, and excitedly pulled him toward the dance floor.
Granger then looked at Harry. “You did a brave thing when you approached the Duke of Malfoy. Can you do it again?”
Snorting, Malfoy opened his eyes, lifted his head. He fished out a handful of Galleons from his pocket and set them on the table. “Take that. I’m paying you for letting me stay here.”
“A cracking good choice.” Draco wanted to touch Potter in goodbye but a handshake felt too formal. Draco forced himself to take a step back. “Tonight then?”
Weasley blinked at him again. Then understanding dawned on his face. “Are you … were you two—?”
They dined in the company of bobbing peonies. Their scent made Harry relaxed in his chair, let out a breath.
“What are you doing here?”
Malfoy blinked at him. He was teary-eyed. “Me too.”
Granger looked ready to attack; then Miss Brown spoke up. “It seems to me that Miss Weasley presents a sound plan. If we agree that Mr Potter should have another chance to convince the duke to support our cause, then Lady Parkinson would be the best person to manufacture that opportunity for us.”
you?”
“Your commentary is unnecessary,” Lady Granger told her.
“I’m awful at dancing. Truly.”
Harry opened and closed his mouth. He wanted to say,
“Oh.” Malfoy licked his lips again. His gaze had zeroed in on Harry’s cock.
Potter would be at that protest, and Draco had to find a way to protect him no matter the cost.
“What is a
“I don’t care. Take it.” He wearily got to his feet.
“Yes,” Granger said excitedly. “I will submit a permit request immediately.”
The guards threw him into a holding cell with a crowd of other men. The cell was large but space was limited. The air reeked of unwashed bodies. Harry crossed his arms, holding himself, and pressed his back against the wall.
Potter slammed his fist to the table. “Stop, Malfoy.”
“It’s obvious the lad wants you as well,” piped up Cyprus Orion Black.
Draco ground his teeth. “You and Mr Potter were close?”
“What are you thinking about?” the duke said.
Theo stuffed his hands in his pockets, turned his face to the side. The dying sun made his skin look golden, his dark eyes a warm brown. His brown curls blew in the breeze.
“I want to see everyone in your employment. Line them up against the wall.”
But tonight he’d hid in his bedroom, full of annoyed frustration, waiting until he heard the roar of the Floo before he went downstairs.
Marriage to a woman wouldn’t be intolerable. He would perform his husbandly duties with little problem. It would just be … lonely, empty. Deep down inside, Draco knew he could never love a woman like he wanted to love a man. Especially any of the society debutantes that would be pushed his way at the party. Daughters of the aristocracy were bred to mould themselves into whatever their husbands wanted them to be. They could barely speak around Draco. They
“Dudley what? Tell me, Harry.”
“Hunting them?” Ginny looked quite confused.
Harry nodded.
Draco focussed on his breakfast. He was thinking about Mr Potter, replaying what he’d felt like in his arms, when Draco looked up and found Potter standing in the doorway.
Harry laughed in surprise.
“Of course it’s all right.”
Screaming, Ronaldo dashed from the room. Draco took the opportunity to quickly untie himself, put away his props, and Disapparate back to the lounge. Ronaldo’s screams muffled the crack of his magic.
Goyle took a few minutes to review the note and look over his map. “I’d say he’s either in Saffron Hill or St Giles. Those reports mention a black haired bloke who was new to town and looking for work. That sounds like it could be Mr Potter, couldn’t it?”
For a few beats of Harry’s heart, they stayed close together, breathing each other’s air. Harry saw the challenge in Malfoy’s expression - his grey eyes glittered like steel. But then Harry remembered he was still healing - he remembered his unborn baby. Too much was at stake for Harry to take any risks.
Mrs Gibbs began to cry. “We can’t afford a doctor. I wanted to have a proper Christmas, but now we will have nothing left over.”
“The bail is set at fifty pounds, sir.”
, Harry thought.
“You seem happy enough working there.”
For some reason, Harry didn’t like hearing that. His hands fisted in his lap. “Go on.”
Gaping, Draco said, “You will only be with me if I give up my title?”
“Won’t you look at me?”
will be my proper family. And one day you will have a career and you will have your own esteem. I promise you, Harry.”
The duke left the drawing room without looking at any of them.
Harry turned, and caught his breath. The duke stood tall in a shadowy archway, his grey eyes glinting in the dark. Harry couldn’t make out his face, not really, but he saw the pulse of his jaw, the white flesh of his neck. The duke’s mahogany scent reached for him.
“It’s the day before Christmas Eve! We both deserve a spot of fun, don’t we?”
“Very good, sir.” The servant disappeared for a moment, then the duke strode into the room.
“It only feels that way now. It will get better.”
“Thank you, sir!” The child dashed away.
“Tell me what you were going to say.”
They stood together near the fire, not speaking, just looking at one another.
Ginny clapped her hands excitedly. “
He snorted. “Of course.”
Draco was kneeling on the floor, clutching his stomach. He shook his head and muffled another gag. There was vomit all over the carpet.
). He dropped in on Weasley unannounced and found the man quite shaken up.
Draco lowered his wand. “You’re in the wrong place. Ceremony’s inside.”
“Oh, yes, your
Staring into his eyes, Harry opened his mouth. Malfoy carefully served him the broth. Some of it dribbled down his chin, and Malfoy, a bloody duke, cleaned his chin. Harry’s life was very strange indeed.
“This time you escaped but what about tomorrow? Or the day after? They need a good thrashing. All of them. Their demands are sinful, unnatural. I’m sure that man was only giving his public support because he intended to do something wicked to those women, something very wicked.”
, he thought desperately.
Weasley gave him a smile. “That’s perfectly all right. The correspondence can wait another day.”
“How are you doing?” Theo said.
Draco barked loudly.
“Are you sure you should be crawling around on your hands and knees?”
“Oh, Harry,” Malfoy said softly.
Potter moved closer. His gaze burned with feeling. “I want you. All of you.”
“I wanted to say something worse but stopped myself.”
Groaning, Malfoy lowered his blond head. He took Harry into his mouth, his thin lips wrapping around his shaft.
,” Harry whined, his hips jerking, his cock spurting so deep in his arse.
“How do you know?”
Malfoy blinked at him. “Do you not understand what a legal agreement entails?”
This time Malfoy raised both of his eyebrows. He looked at Harry, not saying anything. Harry hurried to fill the silence.
“Yes.”
Malfoy’s eyes burned into him. “And when we are alone?” he said softly.
,” he whispered, hands still pinned above his head.
“I’m yours?” Harry whispered.
Draco gave him a withering look. “Protection officers shouldn’t be in the streets, shoving just any stranger who dares speak to a secretary, or Duke for that matter. If I hear that you’ve accosted another stranger again, it will be your job.”
“It’s a plan.” Harry went to the door, then paused. He looked back at Malfoy. “There’s pyjamas in the wardrobe. They’re old but usable. Do you need help dressing?”
“You can have me, Harry.”
“Yes,” Malfoy said, voice still rough. “I sent word to Granger the moment I found out myself.”
The duke’s eyes glittered. “You are right,” he said softly, “the songs were about falling in love.”
Malfoy held up his soil-licked hands. “What does it look like I’m doing?”
Harry had only shagged one other man, and it’d been awkward and thrilling and depressing. Not many people in his life were gay like him. He didn’t know that many gay men. When he’d first realised his sexuality, he’d gone to gay bars just to see what he was missing. It’d been fun, he’d supposed. He’d had a few drunken snogs, wanked a few blokes in the toilets. One night he’d even gone home with a Muggle - Harry couldn’t even remember his name now. The sex had been
“With all due respect, we don’t know that,” said Miss Brown.
Harry licked his lips and nodded. Draco took up the flannel and soap, and began to wash the filth from Harry’s skin. Harry closed his eyes. Tears slipped down his cheeks.
“Draco, please.”
Potter tugged off his clothes, utterly casual. He slipped underneath the duvet, his glasses now on the bedside table. His eyes looked too big without his glasses. Sighing, he smoothed his hand down Draco’s side, over and over, petting him just like he did when Draco was in dog form. He scratched behind Draco’s ear.
“She asked me to put on a ball … a New Year’s Eve party. With
“That’s not the same as telling me.”
Harry opened his mouth to the pillow and arched into Malfoy’s thrusts. He let himself be taken, utterly taken, hot pleasure surging through him, his toes curling against the sheet.
“Is that what people are saying?” He looked at Lady Granger, then at Ginny, his heart thudding in his chest. Their bland expressions told him everything he needed to know. “I see,” he said softly.
They stood in silence for a long moment. The duke looked tired, his face lined with stress. Finally, the duke said, “You ran away.”
Draco felt as if Potter had just slapped him across the face. “I beg your pardon?”
Harry blinked at him. “But you can’t do anything. Don’t you see? For us to be together we would have to give up something very important to us. I don’t want to give up my self-respect, and you could never turn your back on the dukedom, on your party.”
Ignoring everyone, Granger added, “It will be worth our time to try to talk to the duke again. He is one of the most powerful men in the country and could sway the entire upcoming election if he set his mind to it.”
“Sorry - but you can’t leave. I mean, of course you can leave, I just don’t want you to.”
“I don’t care, do you understand me?” Draco leaned close, pinning Potter against the desk. He dragged his nose along Potter’s neck, smelling his aftershave. “At one point I did care, but now … You bewitch me.”
“We will take our leave now,” Draco said.
Smiling softly, Draco leaned up and kissed him.
“This has all been a misunderstanding,” said the duke coldly. His eyes bore into the director.
“Pardon me, but I must go!” Harry said as he rushed to follow Draco out. The visitor exit was different from the exit for the MPs. Harry raced through the halls of Parliament, looking desperately for Draco. He found him outside among the carriages.
Potter gritted his teeth and hissed. Draco raised his eyebrows.
“Are you hurt?” asked Malfoy quietly.
Draco’s stomach clenched pleasantly. “I shall go to him then.” He hesitated. Goyle was the one servant who he could trust with his secrets. “I want you to accompany me again.”
The broken window provided the perfect escape route. Especially if someone had cast an Anti-Disapparition jinx on his flat.
it, Potter. But you were too much of a shoe-licking Gryffindor to tell me the truth.”
Draco blinked. He shifted in his seat, uncomfortable. “Yes, I suppose so, if it’s all right with Gibbs.”
“Ah, I see.” Harry crouched down next to him. “What are you doing?”
“It doesn’t matter.” Harry waved his wand and opened the warded cabinet. “I haven’t spent a single Galleon you’ve given me. I don’t need it. I want you to have it all back.”
Harry scoffed and began walking again. He didn’t care what
Harry raced after him. “Wait! Where are you going?” Draco didn’t hear if Ronaldo responded.
“Not everyone.”
Draco tipped his head back and laughed. “The only woman who matters to me is Pansy.”
“Do you like it?” Malfoy asked quietly.
“Malfoy,” Potter moaned.
Harry leaned closer to examine his chest. Purple bruises were already appearing - a lattice of colour. He touched Malfoy’s side as gently as possible. “I think your ribs are broken.”
“No.”
Harry flinched, not understanding. “Sorry?”
“No,” Harry whispered.
“I can’t say. It’s my problem, not yours.”
He found Malfoy on the floor of the hallway. “Shit,” he said, and rushed to help him up. He wrapped Malfoy’s arm over his shoulder and together they staggered to the loo.
Malfoy hesitated. “You fear
Malfoy did what he was told; thankfully, his breathing didn’t sound wet. Harry noticed that his nipples were pink; they’d pebbled in the cool room.
Potter gave him a faint smile. “I’m a man of my word. I promised Lady Granger I would speak to you about amending the Act, and so I have.”
Gulping thickly, Harry followed the guard out of the cell.
Potter gave a strained, humourless laugh. “What year is it, I wonder? 1272?”
“Okay.” Harry kissed his forehead.
“Oh, right,” he said, terribly awkward. He removed the coat and gingerly gave it to a servant handling their tea. The servant looked at the coat, then looked at Harry. “Sorry, um. It belongs to the duke. He let me wear it. I didn’t nick it or anything.”
“Good, standard strategy. Not bad, but not forceful enough.”
Harry put a hand on his back. “You’re not an idiot.”
“Fuck, you’re going to make me come.”
They followed twisting and turning corridors until they entered a large bedroom filled with
“Of course,” said the servant, leaving Harry’s dinner on a trolley.
“Yes! That’s me!” Harry jumped to his feet. “What is it? Am I to be released?”
“No, I can’t! You live like a - a heathen!”
Finally, Malfoy stood. “Look at me,” he croaked.
“I need to find Goyle, ask him to fetch me another jacket,” Malfoy said, idly fingering the wet spots on his jacket’s fabric.
The night was chilly and snowy, but there were fires glowing along the balcony. Harry clutched the balustrade, the marble cold against his fingertips. He wished it was daytime, and he could gaze out at the sprawling beauty of the duke’s lands. His time at Malfoy Castle was coming to an end, and he wanted to cherish the exquisite scenery before he ventured back to Oxford.
Potter grabbed his hands. “
Harry reached out and smoothed a hand down his back. Malfoy looked so disappointed, and he just wanted to comfort him. Malfoy leaned a little into his touch.
“I admit it’s a bit self-serving.” Potter went to his favourite desk in the library and retrieved a handmade book. He gave it to Draco. “I’ve created a resource for you about women's suffrage.”
The waiter returned with their drinks. Draco took a sip of his little glass of wine. “Tastes like piss,” he said.
“Pardon me?”
Potter blinked. His eyes were so damn green. “I’m here because I want to be.”
“Just wait,” Draco said, his face hotter than he’d like. He took Potter into his mouth, whirling his tongue. Potter cried out; he grabbed Draco’s hair in a painful tug.
He took the empty chair next to Ginny and Miss Brown. He eagerly snatched up a crumpet and slathered on clotted cream. He hadn’t eaten all day; his pockets were empty and his days were filled with a marathon of classes and research and tutoring. He was lucky enough to have a few tutoring jobs, but they paid very little and sucked up his energy. His stomach growled loud enough for others to hear. He forced himself to slow down as he chewed.
The duke stiffened. “I beg your pardon.”
“If I weren’t with you, I’d be lazing about with Pansy in the parlour.”
“Sorry,” Harry muttered.
“Oh, Merlin.”
Goyle rapped on Potter’s door when they arrived. “Come in, please,” said Potter through the door.
Malfoy tonight. The thought was nearly unbearable.
Potter trembled in his arms. His hips bucked once, then twice. Every inch of him hummed with desire.
“It doesn’t seem like nothing to me!” Draco said, voice raised as well. “How about you grow some bollocks and just tell me you didn’t want me around tonight!”
“I don’t want to live without you,” Draco said, choking.
It didn’t matter what Granger or Ginny said. He couldn’t stay here for Christmas. It wasn’t possible the duke desired his presence over such an important holiday. At the very least, Harry would only be in the way.
Draco felt a thrill sizzle through him. Potter was growing more comfortable around him. It was a heady feeling.
Swallowing thickly, Draco whispered, “It’s my first time—please take care of me.”
“You have no proof! What you are inferring is ridiculous!”
Potter frowned. “You two mean a lot to one another. I don’t want her to think you are neglecting her.”
“You stupid arse!” Harry yelled. He grabbed Draco, wanting to pull him into an embrace, wanting to kiss him, but all he could do was shake him. “What is wrong with you?”
“The conditions in that horrid place … only people like me will have to experience it. Not people like you. Not the people who control the country, who think those conditions are acceptable.”
!” Green light shot above Draco’s face. He heard something heavy fall backward, breaking more glass. It was Theo, falling through the window. The killing curse had found its target.
Harry kissed the centre of his chest. “I love you.”
it flirting? It didn’t matter.)
London was gloomy, so gloomy. Draco’s life lacked colour now. It had been nearly three weeks since Potter had ordered him out of his room and out of his life.
“I mean, you are always worrying about other people’s needs. How about, just for today, you worry about what
“He needs to go straight to bed,” said the duke.
“You and Weasley. The sister, not the brother.”
“It doesn’t matter.” Malfoy’s gaze was still on the ceiling. “Maybe I’ll die before my baby is ready to come out.”
“This way,” Draco said as if Potter had a choice in the matter.
“I bloody understand perfectly!” Harry shouted. “I am not going to be your
“Because Dumbledore said so.”
Harry pulled out, then pushed back in. He worked him open, going slowly at first. Then he sped up.
“But -”
“It means that it came up in conversation, but we didn’t dwell on it. I don’t want the duke to think I’m trying to use him or something. I didn’t fall sick just so I could convince him to support amending the Married Women’s Property Act.”
He wanted to kiss Malfoy so softly. He wanted to hold him. He wanted to undress him gently. He wanted to kiss and lick and suck until Malfoy understood, until he was desperate. Then Harry would thrust so carefully into him; he would hold him and caress him; he would whisper to him that he was valuable, beautiful, perfect. Then, when Malfoy was ready, he’d fuck him so hard that even the boggarts in the attic would hear them.
The palace was cold and opulent, with long dead Kings and Queens frowning at him from their gilded frames. Draco was used to cold and opulent places; he lived in a few such places himself. But being here gave him a unique sense of dread.
The guards let him clean his face and hands, let him put on a clean pair of robes, before they led him into a visitation room.
“I will be right back,” he whispered to Lady Greengrass. He hastily followed Potter.
No matter what happened, no matter how long Draco remained under Theo’s control, Draco would find a way to kill him. He would find a way out, find a way to take his revenge, all he needed -
to him?”
,” Harry breathed.
Draco nodded and didn’t say anything. He stared around at the room in uncomfortable silence. “You have lovely curtains,” he said.
“It doesn’t matter if you own land if you can’t afford to maintain it.”
“I’m going to find him.”
“Walk away right now if any of this is coerced.”
“I think so.”
“You deserve so much more, Harry.”
In the courtyard, the horse veered left, presumably toward open land. Harry clung closer just as the duke turned his body to force the horse in the opposite direction. The movement made their faces connect—Harry felt the duke’s slightly bristled cheek against his own and their lips touched at the corners.
Potter and Ronaldo left the house to grab dinner at a pub. It gave Draco plenty of time to scheme.
The land was beautiful even on the cusp of winter. If his predicament had been different, he would have stopped to take in the rolling hills, the endless sky. The air felt like home.
They ascended the grand steps and entered a grand entrance hall that contained a domed glass ceiling. Harry tipped his head back to take in the soaring upper levels. Statues glowered down at him.
They were in the director’s office, and the director sat behind his desk. He wore a jacket, but it was open to reveal his pyjamas. The director had left bed just to address the problem that had brought the Duke of Malfoy to his penitentiary.
Malfoy wiped the corners of his mouth and moved away. When he came back, his face was expressionless.
He noticed that she didn’t call him sir. He must stick out like a sore thumb here. “Everything is … good.” He carefully stepped into his lavishly decorated room.
“And that includes helping me bathe?”
“You,” Draco said coldly.
“Come on, it won’t be terrible.”
Potter sucked in a breath and grabbed his hand. “You don’t have to do this.”
Draco worked his mouth, trying to find a way to explain. “Personally, I am not. But I know what a bad winter can do to worker morale, even in the country. It would cost me loads more in the long run if I don’t prepare now. Upheaval is never cheap.”
with Malfoy. He knew there were loads of things that Malfoy didn’t want to discuss. He just wished he could …
Draco pulled back to scrutinise Potter’s flushed features. “Don’t you think I deserve some explanation?”
Harry sighed. “I tell you I am wasting my time. His Grace utterly oozes privilege and wealth. I met a few of his tenants yesterday. Their house was nearly a hovel. Delightful people, they were, but they couldn’t even afford firewood. How is that fair?”
“But …”
He immediately stepped on her toe; she winced a little. Then he did it again, and her eyes widened.
Harry kept his head down and didn’t say anything for the rest of the night.
“I don’t think you’re a monster.”
“Happy Christmas, Your Grace!”
On most nights, sleep evaded him until the early hours of the morning. Draco was hard as rock during these dark hours, his mind filled to the brim with images of Harry writhing underneath him, of Harry’s cries of pleasure in his ear.
Draco stroked himself quicker. Potter was attracted to him, or at the very least, he was attracted to men. Draco could tell. They both possessed the same perversion.
“What a mess,” Potter murmured, running his hands through Draco’s white fur. “Do
Now that Potter had his strength, he spent his days closed up in the library, furiously working for that damn Professor Weasley. Of course Draco was jealous. It was ridiculous, a little obsessive, but Draco had asked around: Weasley was an unmarried man in his early thirties with a respectable job and a good reputation. Either he was very good at keeping his naughty deeds with women secret, or he was a lover of men. Something told Draco it was the latter. The next important question: Did Potter know?
Potter scrubbed his face. “You already know about my past. You know how I’ve been hurt. I went to Oxford to flee all that … to become someone new, someone in control of themselves. Then I met you, a
The last thought that went through his head before he hit the ground was how he would die and never see Harry again.
“I’m afraid not.”
“Mr Potter would like to be shown his room,” Lady Granger said. “He doesn’t mean to be rude, but he has much work to finish before his weekend can truly begin.”
to see. “Want me to do it right now? I will. I’ll crawl under the table and put my mouth on you, right in front of all these stupid Muggles ...”
Draco and Potter smiled at each other. One day Draco would have him. One day.
“I see.” Weasley removed his glasses to clean them. “I suppose it all makes sense now. There was no way I could compete with a duke.”
Malfoy bared his teeth. “You bring it out of me.”
believe in it, but the duke has complicated matters.”
“There’s no need,” Draco said awkwardly. This was why he avoided talking to commoners. They were always so careful around him. Of course he liked the respect, the deference, but he also yearned to have a real connection with people.
like ….
“Oh, Peppermint,” Potter moaned. He came a moment later, his cock painting their stomachs. Draco’s thrusts didn’t stop. He fucked into Potter over and over, until orgasm came over him without warning. He threw his head back and howled as he emptied himself inside Potter.
“It better not be about the election,” he said, and ripped open the letter. What he read made him turn cold.
Draco wanted to look away, hide himself; but he wanted Potter to see him. He wanted Potter to see how he was trying to change, trying to be good.
“I’m afraid I was thinking the same thing.”
Draco closed the space between them, pressing Harry into the wall. He framed Harry’s face with two gentle hands. “You want me?” he murmured.
here?”
“But I don’t have a boyfriend!” Potter said, sounding annoyed.
Draco rolled away from her. He stared at the empty wall. “I don’t know how I slept.”
“My back, my shoulders.”
“Something happened between you two, didn’t it?”
“Funny enough, Parliament votes on the Act today.” She checked her watch. “In an hour.”
. They had grown so close since Draco moved in with him, and they now cuddled on the sofa virtually every night. But it had been months and neither of them had made the first move.
“Well he was here! I don’t care what you say! I know what I saw!” Ginger Hagrid was on the verge of screaming again.
Malfoy emerged from the shadows. He wore his Magpie healer robes. “Hello, Potter. Congratulations.”
Potter remained by Mrs Gibbs’ side as they waited to see if the herbs eased her suffering. Draco didn’t know what to do with himself, and he could tell his presence stunted their conversation. He decided to go outside to check on his steed, perhaps discuss labour morale with Mr Gibbs.
It was quite possible the duke was using Harry as his plaything, as some lowly commoner only good for a laugh. Because it was so stupid that Harry would even
Harry was ashamed, mortified. He was furious. He spent the first leg of his journey muttering angrily to himself. How dare the duke speak to him like that! How dare he
Draco wavered on his feet. Potter caught him in his arms. “I need a sit ...” Draco said faintly.
Draco and Goyle stepped from the carriage. “Let’s get you an umbrella, Your Grace,” Goyle said.
“You need to stop trying to solve all my problems. I don’t want it.”
Malfoy pushed away his empty plate. “All right but cast that health spell on me first.”
Draco buried his hands in Potter’s pristine robes, wrinkling the material. He pulled him close so he could breathe in his face. “You want me to get a drink with you?”
The sun was almost blindingly bright as it glinted off the glittering snow. Their breaths steamed the air.
The last photograph was from a wintery holiday a year before Harry’s death. They had gone on a snowy hike to the top of a gorgeous mountain. Harry had called him over for the photograph, and their feet had been planted firmly on the slippery peak, their noses red and chilled.
. I’m nothing. I’m trying to make something of myself, but it will take time. I—I can’t be with you, not romantically, not as friends. We don’t
“You will find out that the Duke of Malfoy can be very, very naughty. Spread your legs for me, love. Yes, just like that.”
Sighing, Harry came back into the house. He went down the hall to his office and cursed loudly when he found an empty room.
he thought. “Have you heard of the Married Women’s Property act? I believe it should be amended.” He said this to the men around him.
The truth was this had never happened to Draco. Not really. Outside a few wild years when he was young, Draco had always had perfect self-control; it was one of the reasons why the Queen felt comfortable enough to give him important tasks.
Potter dropped his gaze, bit his lip. A throb went through Draco; he didn’t think he’d ever get over Potter’s bashful tendencies.
“Yes, I do,” Harry said in a small voice.
“Merry Christmas, sir!”
Draco shrugged again. “I didn’t say the man wasn’t mad.”
Draco drowned two tumblers of brandy. “I don’t want to be a member of the conservative party,” he slurred.
With Malfoy now floating about unseen, Harry left the alley and attempted to retrace his steps. He passed a small man with glowing eyes but the man pretended not to see Harry.
Draco touched his chin with two gentle fingers. He urged Potter to look up at him. “If anyone’s a slag, it’s me,” he said, smiling. Potter smiled back, blinking back tears.
Helping him into an old chair, Potter Summoned a glass and cast an
There was a heavy silence. Harry sensed Malfoy’s desire to ask him more questions, but he didn’t much feel like explaining at the moment.
Grinning, Theo sat down opposite him. Theo looked good, his eyes bright, his curls casually styled. Draco flushed, embarrassed. He’d barely combed his hair that morning.
The thing was - and this was really stupid - Harry had never actually told Draco that he was into men. Harry thought he’d been pretty obvious about it, especially with all the cuddling, but maybe he hadn’t been. Maybe Draco still had doubts.
“You can, I promise. It will be my Christmas present. You must know how I ache for you …”
Sighing, Potter went to the pasta bake. He ladled cheesy pasta onto two plates and brought them over to the table. “Can we eat now please?”
They tossed the kidney and steak in flour, then seared them in oil. Then they added some bacon for flavour, and the onion and mushrooms. For even more flavour, they added wine and broth, and let it all come to a simmer.
At the other end of the table sat Lady Parkinson and Lady Granger. They seemed to actually be talking to one another, not just nursing political arguments or chucking mean barbs at one another.
Sighing, Harry removed the top from the box. Inside lay the nicest green coat he had ever seen. “Surely there’s been a mistake …”
Potter. The realisation stole his breath. He’d spent years and years doing anything to rile Potter up, get under his skin. He’d spent years desperate to make him angry.
“I’m yours.”
you.”
Frowning, he sat down on his settee. She sat as well. She stared at him with her large, orb-like eyes.
Sighing, Draco motioned lazily to Goyle, and Goyle handed over a few pounds to the man.
“I don’t mean to push you away.”
Holding his hand, Harry helped Malfoy lower into the soothing water. Malfoy slumped back and closed his eyes.
The day after Trelawney’s barmy visit, Draco left his flat at his usual time. He liked to walk to work; it was a little
“Oh, Draco. Don’t say things like that.”
“No … our cause will take time. I must understand that.”
“I’m going to put my fingers in you now.”
“That will be our plan B,” Draco said. “First, I want to focus on finding Harry right away.”
Harry glanced at the duke again, and discovered his face in profile. The duke was listening to his neighbour, nodding at all the right places. He had a beautiful neck; it was definitely swan-like. His hair was the most fascinating shade of blond—it was nearly white, it was. His mouth was thin, angular; his lips were a desperate shade of pink. Harry bet his cock was pink; he bet it was long and heavy; he wanted to know what it
are the instigator here.”
“Why?” Draco was unnerved.
“No, I don’t,” Draco said softly, dragging his nose along Potter’s temple. For the first time in weeks, he breathed him in. Dear God, he had missed this man.
Sweating, Harry answered. The clerk wrote down the information, then beside his name, wrote
“I didn’t nick anything, if that’s what you’re thinking.”
Harry had a million questions for him; but he also didn’t want to bring up anything that he didn’t want to talk about.
“I’ve ruined you,” Harry said. He sounded pleased, a little frightened.
“You were always so moody when we were outdoors.”
“It can happen, you know. It happens to poufs who let men come so far up their arse that their magic mistakes them for women.”
“But …”
While Malfoy stirred the meat mixture, Harry got to work on the mashed potatoes. Making mashed potatoes was so much easier with magic, and in no time he had a bowl of fluffy, creamy potatoes.
More shouts and boos. Members jumped up and down, brandishing their fingers at him, their hats toppling off their heads.
All around them Aurors scrambled to preserve the crime scene. A few of them peered out the window, looking down. They nodded, satisfied.
“That was
Lady Parkinson waited for them at the castle’s entrance steps. “Welcome to the Duke of Malfoy’s home,” she said, eyes twinkling. She held out her hand to Lady Granger, who took it after a moment of hesitation.
“Yes,” Harry said, his manners kicking in before his brain could catch up. His room … it was an
was here.
“Do you want me to drop to my knees again? I will.”
Their yacht floated on the sapphire waters of the Mediterranean Sea. They were in a deserted spot and had the sea all to themselves.
“You think my name is funny, don’t you?”
an allowance for letting you go.”
“Oh?”
“Can you stand, or do you want me to use a spell?”
“That’s nice,” Malfoy sighed.
“There was no need to push that man earlier.”
Harry tried to pull his hands away, but Malfoy refused to let him go. “You shouldn’t be here. I made myself perfectly clear last time.”
“Okay,” Harry whispered.
Malfoy lifted his head just a little. “Why are you being so nice to me?”
“Because I want to get over you!”
“Yes,” Granger said carefully, a touch annoyed, “but that’s only because the Queen requested it of him. He doesn’t
), but seeing Potter’s felt different. Potter was defeator of the Dark Lord, the wizarding world’s savior, and now his cock was
It felt like a fantasy, like a daydream; what had occurred at Malfoy Castle couldn’t possibly be real.
“Yes, I do believe you are. The lower classes are
His dinner companions snorted into their wine.
“I sent that letter,” Draco said, clipped. He had a habit of turning chillingly civil when annoyed.
“Yes,” he whispered, and urged Potter onto his back. He dragged his mouth along Potter’s neck, tasting his pulse. “Yes.”
Draco grabbed his wrist, wanting to understand before they went any further. “Do you want to see my cock?”
Draco untied his horse from the tree, then mounted. He held his head up, his pointed chin in the air. He didn’t look at Potter.
He just couldn’t stay there any longer staring at Harry’s casket. He heard Pansy chase after him but he didn’t stop for her. She meant well, she really did, but he needed to be alone. He couldn’t handle her pity right now.
Potter looked at Goyle, frowning just a little.
“No.”
“I don’t want to live without him,” Draco said to the wall.
Harry smiled weakly, but then a shadow came over his face. “We shouldn’t be together, Your Grace! Dudley—”
“Shh,” Draco said, now tugging down Potter’s jeans. He fished Potter’s flaccid cock out of his Muggle underpants. He stroked him once, still not looking at him.
Now Dudley looked quite sad. “Kimberly and I are already struggling, you know. Life is difficult. It’s unfortunate, but you have made our lives even more difficult. If word ever got out that my cousin did
“Wow,” Potter muttered to himself.
“You’ve never shagged a bloke, have you?”
Draco cocked his head. “Are you sure, Potter? Because once you shag me, there’s no going back.”
“YOU SHAG OTHER MEN!”
Harry sneaked past him, and Malfoy closed the door behind him. The room was large with a roaring fire. The bed loomed large and intimidating, but its green duvet looked soft and inviting.
Malfoy’s expression cleared. “I will have my solicitor draw up a contract. You may have anything you want, absolutely anything. Obviously you understand my wealth, my resources. I’m capable of getting you out of this world.”
Harry did his best to breathe. Malfoy’s touch was both painful and euphoric. Malfoy worked his hands across Harry’s shoulders, his thumbs applying even, but persistent pressure.
“Please—don’t come close.”
They went to his bedroom and Potter pulled back the sheets for him, making Draco a nice comfy spot next to him. “Jump up here, boy. Yes, just like that.” Draco crawled into bed.
Malfoy growled. “Don’t call me that. Everyone in the world can call me that, but not you.”
“Don’t,” Malfoy growled.
Malfoy stood on the other side. His lips parted when he saw it was Harry. “Please come in,” he said softly, and opened the door wider.
“Oh, God,” Harry said, and reached down to stroke his cock.
“Don’t make me say it again.” He fidgeted in his seat.
Harry cleaned up their game and set the table as Malfoy cut them servings. Then they sat close at the table, shoulders brushing, as they tucked into their meal.
Malfoy didn’t respond so Harry gently turned them again and Apparated upstairs. The only clean guest room was right next to Harry’s.
They had wasted time flirting and bickering; Draco’s steed could be halfway to Hawthorne by now.
Potter spent long days at work, but when he got home, he always took Draco on a long walk. Draco made sure to be a menace during these walks; the neighbourhood cats fled the moment they heard the jingle of his leash.
Granger’s expression turned icy. “Hello, Lady Parkinson.” Her tone could cut glass.
Harry couldn’t deny that his current coat was … not very adequate.
“We are two men who come from vastly different worlds. I have my world, and you have yours.” Harry paused to gather his thoughts. “You ask why I ran away; I did it for you, and for me. I did it because I knew we would never work out.”
“No.” Malfoy reached out, tried to slide the ring on Harry’s finger.
“I know many men who are ruthless when it comes to women.”
“Get out of my way!” snarled the policeman.
“Do you live anywhere else?” Malfoy snarked back.
Malfoy’s eyes rolled up; he looked overcome by the pleasure, by the tight squeeze of Harry’s arse. Smirking, Harry leaned down to kiss him. Malfoy took the opportunity to press a finger to where his cock met Harry’s hole. He felt where they were connected.
“You—you are immoral! Let’s go to the police! I have things to tell them as well!” Dursley slapped his chest pocket.
“Stop lying,” said a skeletal old man next to him. “There’s no way you know a lick of German. You couldn’t have understood a word.”
“I see.” Draco put his hands behind his back so the man didn’t see how he wrung them. “I want you to leave the premises immediately.”
“Yes … his wife Kimberly had just given birth to a child, and they were desperate for money. Dudley knew exactly what to do to get that money.”
“Oh, Harry,” Draco said softly. It was the first time he had said his Christian name. It felt like something was breaking apart and reworking itself in his chest.
; being inside another man would never not be good; but it hadn’t been what Harry was looking for.
Dursley worked his mouth like a fish. “I’ve done nothing wrong!”
“Malfoy.” Potter’s voice dripped with pity. He stood to tug his jeans back up. His belt made a loud noise as he buckled it. “I didn’t ask you around to shag you.”
The winter had been better than expected, and famine stayed away. The Queen’s promised shipments of goods arrived in a timely manner. Sometimes Draco felt like he’d made the deal for no reason, but it made him happy to see his tenants benefit from the extra supplies.
Harry met his eyes and smiled. It was strange to make small talk with a man he wanted so thoroughly.
“It’s because I love him!”
“How could you possibly know that? You are not a woman.”
Potter looked unconvinced. “I confess it’s not my favourite thing to do. It’s why I ran away to Oxford.”
Draco squeezed his shoulders. “Please—
“The snow hadn’t started yet, but yes, I tried to outpace the storm. Obviously, I wasn’t successful.”
Potter took Ronaldo into his bedroom, closing the door on Draco. Draco whined and scratched, but Potter didn’t let him in. Then Draco heard Potter moan and he smelled the hot tang of sex, and he thought about Potter’s favourite pair of trainers by the door. Yes, that would teach him a lesson.
Malfoy fed him a bit more both. Harry tried not to slurp. His gaze went to the hidden manservant. Was this some sort of test? Perhaps it was against the law for a duke to feed a commoner? Was it all a mean joke?
Potter hesitated. He looked intimidated. Then he seemed to gather his courage and properly entered the room. He sat down in the chair on Draco’s right.
when he did that, and Draco wanted to fall all over him … he wanted to put his hands on him, pull him close.
“I’m not dating a blond man,” Potter said.
. The illustration right away caught Harry’s eye. It was of a man with a rounded stomach. The writing was in old English, and Harry strained to remember a translation spell. When the incantation finally came to him, he exclaimed in panicked relief, and cast the spell.
Draco would understand, wouldn’t he? He would understand that Harry needed help to save him and or the baby.
“Most.”
Weasley’s eyes glittered behind his glasses. Their handshake went on a second longer than necessary. “Take care, Harry. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.”
Draco poured his tea with a flick of his wand. He directed the cup to land neatly on the table in front of Potter.
,” Potter said, and twisted from his grasp. He took several steps away from Draco.
. There were servants close enough to hear!
The duke held court in the middle of the room. He wore a formal black suit with a top hat. A diamond pin glinted in the silk cravat tied around his elegant neck. Harry felt his mouth go dry. It felt almost sinful to look at the duke, especially when he was dressed so sharply.
“Yes, of course, Your Grace. The officers at the protest—they must have misremembered; they must have picked up the wrong man!”
“Come now,” Draco said, low and gentle.
Excited, Malfoy moved his chair even closer to the bed. The fire was bright and comforting, and it made Malfoy’s skin look like honey. The duke had beautiful eyes.
“Mm?” Draco dragged his hot mouth down the column of Harry’s throat.
“That took proper courage,” said Lady Granger, approaching from behind.
Dudley clicked his tongue. “People are saying you spent Christmas with the Duke of Malfoy. A
“None of these men are who I’m looking for,” Draco said.
Warm bag in hand, Draco wandered from the restaurant, enjoying the glow of the setting sun. London was always softer at twilight, the sounds somehow muted.
“His Grace is waiting in the corridor.”
at Draco, damaging his protection spell.
Draco waited in the dark alley for him. People passed the mouth of the alley, the road a buzz of activity. Draco was drenched, his top hat buckling under the rain’s weight.
, Malfoy.”
“No,” Harry said, face burning.
This made Theo frown. “He’d
“Maddy and I would be delighted to have His Grace in our home!” Gibbs cried.
“Why?”
“Did you ever fancy either of them?”
A few minutes later, Ronaldo emerged from the toilet. From the office doorway, Draco whispered, “
Potter’s frown deepened. “Think of myself? What do you mean?”
Relief washed through Harry. For the first time in years, he felt hopeful about his prospects.
Lady Parkinson pretended not to notice. Her eyes drifted back to Harry, who was busy preparing his second crumpet for consumption. “I’m not surprised Mr Potter made a splash with the duke.”
“Look - I’m not - I didn’t ask you to have a drink with me so you’d shag me.”
Ginny blushed but carried on. “She might be willing to help us. She is close friends with the Duke of Malfoy, isn’t she? And I thought you two knew each other ….”
But Draco wanted to trust him. He wanted him. He wanted him so much.
Once the pie was in the oven, Harry and Malfoy played Hang the Hag at the kitchen table. It was a card game like Go Fish but each card had a painted hag that yelled obscenities at you when she thought you were lying.
The problem was Draco didn’t give a fuck. Not anymore. All he knew was he would do anything to spend even a few more hours with Potter. The Queen herself could order Draco to banish Potter immediately and Draco would tell her
“I won’t have any money to give to you.”
Draco’s expression turned glacial. “
Then Draco began to move, and Potter melted beneath him. “Good boy,” he cried. “
“Potter?” Draco sneered. “You mean my
Harry reached out, wanting to finally feel Malfoy’s bare skin. Malfoy understood his intentions, and sat back to drag his shirt over his head. His pale chest gleamed in the moonlight. His nipples were pink, pebbled. There was a dusting of blond hair on his chest.
Harry just looked at him. “Were they lovers?”
“He deemed it important enough to contact me about it. It was terribly inconvenient for me, I must say. He popped out of nowhere when I was getting ready for bed. Truly a headache.”
“What?” called a weak voice.
Harry hesitated.
seen as assets, not as people.
This made Potter stop mid-stride. “Are my assumptions wrong?”
,” he said, voice so gentle, so low, and he pulled Harry’s straining cock from his trousers. “Oh.”
Harry opened his mouth, then closed it.
“I’ll leave you to it, then. Take care not to break anything.”
Draco sighed. “I’m sorry my dinner guests were so rude to you. I thought they would be harmless. I admit I misjudged the entire thing.”
. He wanted to raise children and volunteer at orphanages. Perhaps even foster some children. He wanted to be married to a man who loved him.
you.”
“Sure,” Parkinson said.
“How ingenious. They look lovely.”
“What are you doing out of bed then!”
Draco slowly, teasingly removed his clothes. He was hard and needy, and Harry stared hungrily at him.
“Yes, Your Grace.”
“Were you betrothed?”
Panic shot through him. It was stupid, but he was afraid for Malfoy. Malfoy was a grown person. He could do what he pleased; but Harry still felt protective over him.
“Yes.”
Living with Harry was good but also frustrating. They were still getting to know each other.
Under the table, Draco held his wand. He was ready for a fight. He wanted to hurt Theo; he wanted revengeance.
“Oh, yes. It’s a very nice hat, isn’t it?”
Harry laughed. “Sloth?”
With the fresh pine tree and the steaming cakes, the library suddenly smelled divine. Cinnamon and clove and nutmeg hung in the air.
together.”
“Yes, Your Grace.”
“Are you speaking of yourself?”
“Do you know what socialism is?”
Malfoy blinked. “Goyle? I told him to remain at the castle.”
“Yes, Your Grace.” The servant curtsied and hurried off.
Draco gave him a grim smile. “Thank you, Goyle. Is he open to visitors?”
“That’s how I got pregnant.”
“Who told you that?” Draco said, wanting to make Robards uncomfortable, wanting Robards’ answer to hurt him.
“I’m in love with you.”
Draco hesitated. “A sweetheart.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at him. “You don’t know anything about it.”
“You must understand that a woman’s entire life is in the hands of a husband, a father, a brother, etc. This gives them no options when they are in dire straits, when they face abuse. The Married Women’s Property Act must be amended.”
“It’s for weeding. Looks Muggle, doesn’t it? It probably is, which begs the question why old Mrs Black had it in her shed. We’re all full of contradictions, aren’t we?”
. And—now that Harry’s brain had finally caught up—he understood that the man had looked at him with
“Would you still talk to me if I called them Mud - well, you know?”
“That’s not true,” Potter said faintly.
They moved quickly through the bare trees. Draco peered in every direction, trying to spot his steed. Then he saw a set of fresh hoofprints.
The kitchen was just as dark and gloomy as the parlour. Potter lit more candles with his wand.
Lady Granger and Ginny accompanied him to Malfoy Castle. Miss Brown hadn’t been able to attend. Her chaperone had a cold.
Then Friday night came around and everything went to shit.
“Too far,” Draco growled. “Why in the world didn’t you tell me you’d invited bluestockings into my home?”
Harry grinned. “Thanks. Are you available?”
“Do you have pen and paper? I could write you a note.”
“I would do so if you deemed it necessary.” Harry felt his jaw pulse. He wasn’t a child, and under the law, he really didn’t need Dudley’s permission to attend Oxford. But Harry’s reputation was already in the gutter—had been since he was born—and the last thing he needed was Dudley making trouble and spreading rumours that would get Harry kicked out of Oxford, or worse.
“Good?”
“Yes, love. It takes enormous balls to strut around the canteen like you do, your head held high. It was one of the reasons why I couldn’t take my eyes off you. You were in the lion’s den and refused to back down.”
“Of course you were aware. Stop with such nonsense. No, it
“Good.”
Draco sighed a little once he situated himself. “Now go look for some answers in your spell books. I’ll be all right.”
Dudley’s expression fell. “I can’t send you money. We’re already strapped as it is. As I see it, you should be sending
He was terribly excited to see Potter.
There were gasps. “
Malfoy took several quick steps toward him, then stopped. The look on his face was barely suppressed possession.
“But he’s done it before … I don’t want to bring you down with me.”
“What are you doing?”
“Slytherins.”
Lady Parkinson threw her head back and laughed. “Have a seat and a cup of tea.”
Harry was in mid-stride when the Floo flared to life and Draco stepped out of the fireplace. Harry just blinked at him.
“Yeah … it’s now almost a honey colour. It’s nice.”
“Oh, Merlin.
There was a long, terrible silence.
Draco swore loudly, then fell into a muffled whimper. He grimaced in pain. “The baby’s coming. I can feel it.”
“Come up next weekend,” Parkinson said. “Like I said, I’m sure the duke would love to host all of you. Especially you, Mr Potter.”
“Yes,” Harry said, a smile tugging his lips. “Miss Weasley is brilliant company.”
“Why? Because I am a duke and you are a commoner? Do you want me to give up my title, become a male bluestocking like yourself?”
“I will speak to the necessary people. Your tenants will get their barley and whiskey; you will get your cash. But you will promise to take over as leadership of the campaign; and you
She rustled back to her chair, lowering herself with regal care. Draco and Sir Dullborne dutifully followed her. Beside her was a writing desk messy with correspondence. Draco vaguely wondered which letters were for her children and how much she intended to berate them. She was especially nasty to her daughters, or so Draco had heard.
“For saving me.”
“But you’re curious.”
“This is
“I won’t stop until I find him,” Draco said, voice full of possession. He glared down at Weasley. He hoped Weasley got his message loud and clear:
Potter shrugged, worried his bottom lip. “I dunno. I just like seeing you outside the canteen.”
“Mr Dudley Dursley in the carriage, Your Grace,” Goyle said.
Draco leaned closer to him, he couldn’t help it. “I wish we were back in the canteen. I wish I was your waiter. I know what to do when I’m only the waiter.”
“When we arrive you should go straight to your room and lie down. We don’t want your constitution to fail when you see the duke.”
Draco had a chuckle. “Brilliant, Carter, just brilliant. I hope your wives enjoy it. I do wish I could have given more …”
“Yes, but I can explain—”
“That was brilliant,” Potter sighed happily.
“Yes … we met in town, just on the street. We passed one another and our eyes met, and I just knew. It’s like that for our kind, isn’t it? It only takes the meeting of eyes.”
“Enough,” Draco murmured, “enough.”
Shaking his head, Potter whispered, “Don’t you see? I could
gossip when they found out.
Goyle nodded in approval. “Yes, Your Grace. Let me make the inquiries. I rather not empty your pockets just yet.”
Now Potter was frowning, too. He looked down at her in concern. “Mrs Gibbs, you are in severe pain. Those herbs would help you a great deal.”
“I don’t want comfort,” he said darkly.
Harry gave the women a faint smile. They were staring at him, and it was only then he remembered he still wore the duke’s coat.
. Draco gulped the water, his hand trembling.
Christmas was always a lovely time, and Draco secretly enjoyed it immensely. After his journey out to the fields, he stopped by his bedrooms for his clothes to be changed, his hair brushed, his nails buffed. He wanted to look his best for Potter.
On the opposite seat, Lady Granger frowned at him. “Are you feeling well, Mr Potter?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, and reached out to touch him. He could tell Malfoy was hard, but Malfoy stepped back. Harry sat up, his gaze never leaving Malfoy’s face. “What’s the meaning of this?”
“Oh, yes, Your Grace. I thought the duo were fantastic artists.”
“I’m not an idiot, Harry. I know your true nature.”
“Malfoy,” Potter murmured.
“I didn’t know you cooked,” Harry said, leaning against the counter and sipping his tea. Malfoy was flushed prettily, his hair combed neatly even though he was still in his pyjamas.
“Give it to me, love.”
“You are one of the bravest people I know, and that’s saying something.”
are you looking at me like that?”
“Hello Draco,” said Theo.
A whimper escaped from the darkness. Harry paused and raised his wand. The whimper had come from one of the alleys.
Malfoy arched an eyebrow. “Only man?”
That gorgeous man had been a
Draco smiled a little. “I do like it when I serve members of the Wizengamot. They tried to throw me into Azkaban, but now I’m serving them tea, utterly free.”
“I do believe you attempted to protect me.”
“Yeah.” Potter squirmed more.
“I’m not,” Draco whispered, vision blurred. “I’m worse. I’m
For a moment, Harry couldn’t comprehend. Was someone coming? Was he trying to hide? But then the duke began to undo Harry’s trousers, his hands shaking, and Harry’s thoughts shattered.
“Yes,” Draco said, trying to act casual but secretly quite pleased he had impressed Potter. “I want to make quite a few changes in how my tenants are treated.”
The man hesitated. “I was invited.”
“The clients usually buy me dinner.”
“I want to do it.”
“No, Your Grace. He has asked me to be his assistant, his companion. I have decided to accept his offer.”
“They are for everyone,” Draco said stiffly.
. He needed to be careful.
Malfoy might fancy blokes, or he might be entirely unaware of his flirting. (
“We would be together if I died,” Draco whispered.
“That sounds lovely,” Theo said.
When they were alone, Malfoy turned on him. “Harry.”
Now it was Harry’s turn to gape. “What?”
Harry swallowed. “I don’t care. I just want to help -”
Draco massaged the bridge of his nose. “Dear Lord.”
Draco glared at the other man. He had awful flaming red hair; it reminded him of someone. Oh, yes, that Miss Weasley. The man was probably Professor Percy Weasley, the same man whom Draco had written to about Potter’s illness. Draco wanted to jump to his feet and throttle the man.
Granger turned her sharp eyes on her. “Yes, hunt. Don’t let these men think it’s a game, or that we are too weak, too simple to achieve great things. We cannot be meek around them, or silent. We must demand an audience with them. Of course, we must remain polite, civil; but we shouldn’t take no for an answer.”
Weasley hesitated. “Was it serious?”
Ginny hovered by his bed, looking anxious. “We were worried about you, Harry. Is there anything you need?”
“It’s not, it’s not.”
Malfoy leaned over him, his light cologne filling the air around Harry. His hands slipped down to his back, his thumb and fingers feeling for the knots in his muscles. Harry had been rough on his body in preparation for the match. His muscles were tight all over.
Potter gulped his ale. “I would tell you to shut your mouth.”
—jeopardise his future again.
“Yes, Your Grace,” Carter said, reeling. The poor man looked about to faint.
The duke blinked. “The roads are still dangerous … it’s impossible.”
Yawning, Draco looked up at him. He was desperate for them to just go to bed. It was way past their bedtime.
They both stood to shake hands. “Harry, one last thing.” Dudley squeezed his hand hard. “Don’t you dare get into any
“Please,” Draco whispered.
He wanted to drag his mouth down Malfoy’s neck, taste his warm, clean skin. He wanted to reach beneath the water and wrap his hand around his …
“Also plan for a ball. I need concepts drawn up by next week.”
“Come on down now,” Draco said gently. “I’ve got you.”
“Because Theodore Nott wants you dead.”
Malfoy laughed. He leaned close, getting in Harry’s space. “You couldn’t do anything to me I wouldn’t like.”
He looked down at his desk, then out the window. It was such a lovely, winter day; it was a
“What risks?”
After a few bites, Harry set down his fork. He took up his teacup and drank deeply. Draco forced himself to eat as well.
He spent two lonely nights in the pound, curled up in a corner, shivering with cold, aching for company. Then the visitor door opened, and a man laughed his way into the room.
Harry’s mouth was hanging open. “He virtually lives in a shed! What do you expect?”
“As it turns out, my man Goyle is a proper investigator.”
“You’re gorgeous,” Potter breathed.
“No, I refuse to continue this madness any longer. You must forget about me, Your Grace. You must move on.”
“Your bottom, Potter. Can I massage your bottom?”
“Yes, well …” Potter trailed off, looking uncomfortable.
Harry gulped. Stupidly, he felt tears sting his eyes. What he needed to say to Malfoy was going to hurt them both.
Parkinson flapped her hand. “He’s changing. He’s hosting a New Year’s Eve party, did you hear?”
Potter backed up against the desk. He had gone pink in the face. He seemed to be always blushing around Draco. “An adventure, Your Grace?”
“No.” Draco shook his head vehemently.
“Please don’t run away,” Draco said. “Not this time.”
Draco stubbornly refused to look at the chimneypiece where three photographs waited to break his heart.
There were footsteps, and Harry hastily pulled up his trousers. Oh, God, how long had they had company out here?
Smirking, Draco picked up Harry again. Harry laughed and wrapped his arms around his neck. It was only a few steps to the bed. Draco gently lowered him to the soft duvet.
Harry grabbed him, too hard. Malfoy cried out.
Potter sucked in a breath. “I know.”
Her eyes narrowed at him. He was challenging her and they both knew it. “Pray tell, what would you need for you
Granger nearly rolled her eyes at him. “Come on, Harry. Surely you know that is utter tosh. His Grace has developed a preference for you.”
“I want you to be chief strategic advisor for the Tory party. As you know, the election is coming up, and I daresay they will need help.”
Finally, Harry gathered himself. He made sure he was all button up, then he smoothed down his hair, the fabric on his trousers. Luckily, he didn’t encounter any spunk stains.
Draco yanked away. “Go away, Pans.”
Malfoy cocked an eyebrow. “Are you still dating that Weasley girl?”
“Mr Potter?” called a guard.
She kicked his shin with a dainty foot. “Stop feeling so bad about yourself. She didn’t ask you to go to war, did she? She asked you to host a party, spend some money.”
“All right?” Harry gasped.
Malfoy just looked at him. “It still is my job.”
At the hotel the meeting was already underway. Lady Granger gave him a sharp look as he headed for the open chair next to Ginny.
“Malfoy - fuck.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. “I can’t help feeling that I should be doing more.”
Harry bit his lip. “I’m yours,” he said.
Servants rushed around to dim the gas lamps. The musical duo stepped onto the stage. They were larger women and utterly gorgeous. Harry was transfixed from the moment they began singing.
“Why in the world would you offend anyone?”
“Yes!” he answered indignantly.
“Can we talk about something else?”
“I spoke to the head of admissions,” Granger said gently. “He said you could have your spot back and begin fresh next semester.”
“One more thing,” she said slyly.
“I heard you gave all your tenants firewood,” Parkinson said, lounging on a settee.
Taking a deep breath, Harry turned back around. Malfoy’s expression was strained, his colour pale. He looked like a man on the brink of losing everything.
Harry’s knees went weak. “Yeah.”
Draco looked around the room at all the Muggles. “You do realise we’re in a Starbucks?”
It was obvious Draco had to offer a bit of himself to Potter to loosen him up. Potter had no idea, but Draco was slowly giving over his heart, piece by piece. It was necessary to get Potter to trust him. It was necessary, but utterly mad. Just another thing Draco couldn’t bring himself to care about.
“Stop and drop to your knees!” someone else yelled.
He stood under the shower until his skin pruned. He stared at the old tile, desperate to ignore the images that flooded his head. He saw Malfoy with them - the
“It’s lovely,” Potter said.
“Fuck, you’re sexy,” Harry said, and wrapped his hand around his hardening flesh. They watched as Harry worked his cock until its weight made it lean needily. “Lube?”
Potter worked his mouth. “I don’t know,” he said. “I want nothing.”
“You’re attractive, Malfoy.”
“I am very aware,” Draco purred.
“Yes. Now get out.”
“The only person who could’ve made it happen was you.”
“Well, that was exciting,” Granger said, eyes gleaming. “Very exciting.”
“Lady Greengrass,” drawled the duke, “I daresay your opinions are antiquated and have no place in my dining hall.”
Potter tipped his head back and laughed.
a funny name.”
He wished he could have stayed home, feigned a cough or a toothache, but no one refused a visit with Queen Victoria.
All Harry could do was stare at him in shock. “Malfoy,” he said roughly after a long moment.
“You need to protect yourself, Draco. I don’t understand his motives, but I do know that he wants to hurt you as well.”
Draco nearly jumped from joy.
Malfoy huffed. “Magic isn’t a cure all, you know.
Dursley’s mouth trembled. “I’m not afraid of you! You aren’t the first man of power Harry has ensnared and you won’t be the last! I know my rights!”
, Draco thought, and dashed into his lounge. Theo hurled a
“Potter,” Malfoy said. “Shut up.”
They reached the stables a few moments later. The duke jumped down and smoothed back the strands of hair that had escaped his hat.
“Let me show you Venus.”
“Who?”
“Yes, well.” Webbington fiddled with his cutlery.
“Yes, I did,” Granger said.
,” he hissed.
The officer was not Draco’s employee, but if he wanted to see someone lose their position, he had no problem making sure it happened.
“Oh, hello,” Harry said.
, he told himself. He knew enough about etiquette to survive a weekend here. Two days—it was perfectly reasonable.
“Do you feel - does anything else hurt?”
Potter leaned up and captured his lips in a kiss. Draco wrapped his arm around the small of his back and buried a hand in his unruly hair. He kissed Potter hungrily, commanding his mouth, urging him to submit.
Malfoy leaned closer to run the flannel down his neck, over his throat; Harry’s shirt had many buttons undone, and Malfoy smoothed the flannel over the little slice of his exposed chest.
Malfoy tried to close the space between them again, but Harry stumbled back.
Harry’s heart sped up. He would see the Duke of Malfoy again.
Harry didn’t look at his cock even though he was desperate to do so. Malfoy was already putting so much trust into him; he would only look if he knew Malfoy wanted him to look.
“Yes?”
Harry smiled a little. He knew Narcissa Malfoy was dead. “Did you ever try?”
“One of them was even a man. He made straight for the duke.”
still crowded the pavement. Harry’s stomach lurched when he imagined approaching any of these men. He understood why the Society had awarded him a scholarship that had traditionally gone to women: These men
“No.” Harry gently washed away the blood from Malfoy’s forehead, his cheeks. He focussed hard on his work. He didn’t notice when Malfoy’s eyes flickered open to watch him.
“What?”
“Your Grace?”
Gulping, Potter nodded slowly. He helped Draco tug off his shirt, then his jeans. Draco paused when they reached his underpants. He didn’t want to pressure or rush Potter.
Harry shifted in his seat. He’d rather be anywhere else than sitting next to Parkinson. He found the strange tension between Granger and Parkinson quite alarming. They were two women with a lot of power, playing an aristocratic game he didn’t understand.
“I should be elsewhere … locked up.”
“Lady Parkinson and the duke … they seem close, don’t they?”
Draco regretted his words. He regretted
“Oh, yes.” Potter grinned, and Draco’s heart fluttered. “I told my cousin all sorts of lies so I could come. Not that he has command over me or anything; I just ….”
“Of course it matters!”
She blinked. “No, I don’t.”
Smiling, Harry rolled on top of him. He dragged his mouth along the column of his neck. Together they removed each other’s clothes.
Malfoy blinked back tears. Harry cast the spell again to make sure he wasn’t missing any internal damage. The colour for internal bleeding was garnet.
“What do you mean!”
“Harry.”
Potter blinked at him. “Um … because you asked me.”
But no. He couldn’t do that. He already saw the curiosity in the servants’ eyes when he ordered them to assist Potter. He knew how the servants gossiped, how every pair of eyes were trained on him.
“Go on,” Draco said eagerly. “When was this? When was the last time you saw him?”
“But how is it coming?”
“Yes,” Potter said softly.
The kiss was nice. It was acceptable. Theo groaned in his throat and wrapped his arms around Draco.
“Deal,” Harry said.
,” Harry moaned, his eyelids fluttering. Malfoy was big and long, and all Harry could do was spread his thighs and just take it as his cock slid so carefully inside him.
“I don’t like it.”
“Don’t you understand, Harry?
“Do you need any more help?” Harry said.
“It’s not like that!”
“I want you to have a drink with me.”
Only a few days later, Malfoy left again to take another client. Harry made an excuse about tidying up his room so he didn’t have to see Malfoy beforehand in his skin-tight robes. Once Malfoy had gone, Harry spent another evening pacing through the house, muttering to himself. His antics even scared the portraits a little.
“Yes … no.” Harry yanked away as if Malfoy had held him in place. He paced along a line of colourful roses, sweat beading his forehead. “I don’t fear you; I fear your position. I fear the dukedom and all the eyes that watch us.”
“No.”
“I don’t think so.”
“Oh, yes.” Potter rubbed his hands together. “I’ve been researching for you.”
Malfoy sauntered closer. Harry stumbled back. He was intimidated all of a sudden.
Goyle helped Draco identify places where Harry could be hiding out. “He’s probably in a rookery,” Goyle said, tone mild.
Harry was already asleep.
“No way. I was just a kid … lost. Undisciplined.”
Malfoy blew out air like he was trying not to laugh. He moved his hands lower and lower until he reached Harry’s arse. “May I massage your gluteus maximus?”
“Well don’t look at me. I’m not marrying you.”
Daphne’s eyebrows shot up, and Draco narrowed his eyes at her. She dropped her head and hurried to unlock the cupboard.
His dinner companions turned to look at him. “I beg your pardon?” said Webbington.
“I don’t need to answer that question.”
“Do you regret moving in with me?”
He checked on Malfoy every hour. He quietly cracked the door to glance inside the guest bedroom. Malfoy had fallen asleep in his trousers, his long legs sprawled out on the bed. Malfoy’s white socks always caught his gaze. Seeing Malfoy in socks made him mortal.
“I am, sir.” Potter winced. “May I call you sir? I am unsure.”
“I’ll show you mine if you show me yours,” Draco purred.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, and moved away before their lips touched. “Truly, I am.”
“Please - get inside me. I
Harry didn’t know how he felt about it. Professor Weasley was no Malfoy, but nobody was. Weasley was attractive and nice; but he didn’t make Harry’s heart flutter. Harry didn’t grow heavy between the legs when Weasley got too close.
“Liar,” Malfoy hissed, and he closed the space between them. Harry stumbled back.
“Yes, Your Grace.”
Draco wrapped his arms around him, drawing him closer. The kiss turned hard, possessive. Potter panted.
He captured Potter’s lips again, grinding so hard against him.
“You think I do harm?”
“Yes,” Granger said.
! At first, I couldn’t believe it, but then I remembered that you had a taste for men of the aristocracy.”
Before Draco had the chance to run away, Potter yanked open his front door.
She slinked closer to him. Her hair was a dyed red and her cleavage bulged from her dress. She was obviously a sex worker. Her eyes lit up when she saw his clothes. “Are you lost, sir?”
They were on their honeymoon. A gold ring still glinted on his finger. No law recognised their marriage, but it didn’t matter. Their union was official to Draco and Harry.
“Strangers?”
Harry felt weak, a touch feverish. He wanted to have a sit but his trousers were dirty from the road. He was too filthy—too
“Yes,” Draco growled. It was dangerous to reveal this much of himself to Weasley, but it was necessary given the situation. Weasley needed to understand exactly who he was up against.
Harry stood before him, still in his scarlet Auror robes. The same robes he’d died in. Draco had forgotten how green Harry’s eyes were.
Harry dropped to the floor and hid his face in his arms.
Leaving Weasley’s office, Harry rushed outside to the street. The day was cold and his lousy coat did little to protect him. He raced for the Randolph Hotel.
“And the Dark Lord was stupid enough to think he was invincible.”
Draco had just left work at the Ministry. He was now one of Britain’s most revered potions’ experts. He specialised in the analysis of criminalised potions and equipment. He was a workaholic, and his expertise brought him confidence, self-esteem.
Malfoy thought for a moment. “Steak and kidney pie.”
Malfoy gaped at him. There was pain in his eyes, and anger. “You ran away because you are afraid!”
Harry bit the inside of his cheek. “Is it really necessary for me to attend this dinner? I don’t want to offend anyone.”
“Of course,” Parkinson said blandly, and motioned to one of the servants. “Rose, please show Mr Potter his room right away.”
“Yes. His name is … well, it doesn’t matter what his name is. He’s a little shorter than me. Black hair. Glasses.”
He was determined to put this madness behind him.
Harry stood up before Malfoy could respond. “Let’s get back to work, then.”
Potter sighed. “I’m attempting to have an honest conversation with you.”
“Yes.”
Once Ginger Hagrid was done screaming
Malfoy motioned to Goyle without taking his icy eyes off the director. “How much is the bail?”
Potter cupped his chin and stared sleepily into his eyes. “You are brilliant,” he murmured.
Mrs Gibbs shook her head. “You need to be careful, sir. My great uncle died just like that. He was drunk, of course. I hope you weren’t drunk. It’s sinful, you know.”
Lady Granger walked to the window. She stared out at the street, a frown on her face. “We appear poised to win the election, but I’m not so sure.”
“I don’t appreciate the task.”
“Come along,” the duke ordered.
Ducking his head, the man collected all his belongings and staggered to the doors. He paused before leaving. “I apologise for my presence, Your Grace. I meant no offence.”
Potter’s eyes went wide. “Surely the castle already has a tree?”
Potter got to his feet slowly. His gaze was hesitant behind his glasses. Draco framed his face and kissed him.
“My boy,” Draco said, cradling the baby to his chest. Harry hurriedly cut the umbilical cord. Once cut, the cord shrivelled up and disappeared.
“Why?” Draco tried to ignore the sour lurch in his stomach.
“I DON’T KNOW! THAT’S WHY I ASKED YOU TO HAVE A LOOK IN YOUR STUPID BOOKS.”
spot in his arse. It made pure hot pleasure pour through Harry. This felt right, so right, and it made Harry want to cry. The world didn’t understand. What was happening between them was beautiful; it was perfect. It didn’t matter what people thought.
In the carriage, Dursley huddled in a corner, sweaty, alarmed. His eyes went wide when Draco slid into the seat opposite him. Goyle took his place next to Dursley, close enough to harm him.
“Ah, but that wasn’t my intention.”
Harry blinked. “I work for you therefore I’m not entirely sure accepting your offer would be appropriate.”
A few minutes later, the man came in with a trail of employees following him. The men were sweaty, their clothes torn. None of them were Harry.
“Because I want
, he thought. Outwardly, he smiled.
Then Malfoy centred on his arsehole again, massaging it with his tongue, urging Harry to open for him. Moaning, Harry let himself relax, his back arching, his legs widening. Malfoy drilled into him with the tip of his tongue, and Harry gasped when he felt Malfoy successfully penetrate him.
“I don’t think it’s evil,” Harry said.
“Um.”
“Shut up, damn you.” Potter arched again, his body so warm, so hard against Draco.
“In fourth year. It made Viktor Krum so jealous, didn’t it?”
“There are books in the library - medical books,” Harry said, voice a touch rough. “I’ll have a look inside them, figure out how to cast a diagnosis spell. Does that sound good?”
“Potter,” Malfoy said, his voice sounding like a warning. Harry moaned again and again; Malfoy didn’t stop. He moved to his other cheek, adding even more pressure.
“I would like to know why you represent the conservative party.”
“Don’t you have managers for such things?”
Potter’s eyes went wide; he jerked back. “That’s not necessary, Your Grace. I can hold the glass.”
Granger’s eyes narrowed. “The duke doesn’t like guests. Everyone knows that.”
“Lean forward for me,” Harry said, voice gentle. Malfoy bit his lip and leaned forward, a bit of his blond fringe falling across his forehead. Harry washed his back, moving his hand in slow, soothing circles.
“Where am I?” he muttered. He smelled like dirt and blood.
“I couldn’t.”
Draco should’ve been the one who died, not Harry.
“Okay.” Harry turned his back to him. “Will you be hungry when you come back? I was thinking about ordering takeaway …”
“Oh, fuck,
“Hello?” Ronaldo said, turning on the office light. His mouth dropped open when he saw Draco.
Harry tilted his head up, and nearly gasped. The ceiling was the night sky painted in a dark sapphire. Hundreds of golden stars glimmered down at him. The stars formed a constellation but he couldn’t identify which one.
“I have a townhouse in London. If you wish, you can stay the night there and leave for Oxford in the morning.”
want to be involved.”
He had just been looking for a tasty milk bone, but then that damn Muggle dog catcher had caught him. He never thought he would lose to a bloody Muggle, especially not one who carried a big stupid net.
Malfoy cried out and surged forward. “Say it again.”
“I come from scandalised people. My parents … they were circus performers. Went all the way to America to find work. They were magicians. Wore cloaks and such. Before their death, they had no contact with my aunt and uncle and cousin. Of course there was no contact.”
When Malfoy was inside all the way, he gasped against Harry’s back, both of his hands now squeezing his hips.
Utterly numb, Harry looked Dudley in the eyes. “What do you want from me?”
Harry frowned. There it was again—an order. He didn’t like it all that much when Malfoy ordered him about.
“Who are you?” Ronaldo said, panicked.
“We were so worried about you!” she cried.
Potter blushed prettily. “Yeah … it helps with the stress of my job. I like keeping my hands busy.”
“Oh, Jesus.” Harry dropped to his knees next to the bathtub.
“Malfoy?” Harry whispered.
Draco thought about walking away. He really did. He was in no state to talk about someone else’s grief.
“I don’t understand.”
Draco noticed how the portraits gathered around to gawk at him. “You speak to them, don’t you?”
“Um … I didn’t read that far.”
. What a common name. It sounded utterly unremarkable.
, and all I do is make a fool of myself at every turn.”
“Yes,” Malfoy said carefully. He wasn’t looking at Harry, not really. “Like I told you before, it’s my job.”
“All right,” she sighed. She and Ginny both knew that he had fled back to Oxford before the ball had ended but they hadn’t pushed him for an explanation. He was grateful for that.
Draco motioned between them with an impatient flick of his riding crop. “You. Here.
“We will need to crush them, but they look good.” Potter gave him a shy smile. “Thank you, Your Grace.”
that the Duke of Malfoy was flirting with him.
“I really don’t think I’ll ever understand the wealthy.”
Malfoy fucked him with his tongue, urging his channel to submit to him, his saliva dripping down to his bollocks. Harry moaned continuously, unable to stop himself. Malfoy panted behind him.
“Yes, sir. It’s been about two years.”
“I’m afraid so.”
Malfoy grimaced. “Sounds revolting.” He plated their eggs and bacon, and Spelled it all to the table.
Theo gave him another smile. “Of course not, Draco. I was only trying to convey my condolences.”
“He did but ….”
“Yes.” Potter bit his lip.
“I see.” Potter scooted closer and sighed. “Surely you can’t stay in here all day with me?”
Sighing, Lady Granger took up the chair that was usually reserved for the duke. “I suppose you spoke to His Grace about the cause?”
He felt himself break apart. He wanted to cry but he was so tired. He had cried himself to sleep.
“Do you let him
“Just - run me a bath. I’ll be all right in a bath.”
“Yes, but … he’s a duke! I can’t … it wouldn’t be proper.”
Malfoy. He thought about it nearly constantly. He thought about it when he was alone in bed, unable to sleep. The truth was Malfoy made his cock throb. The truth was he made his heart flutter. Harry really didn’t know what to do about it.
“I understand, sir.”
“What?” He laughed.
—had left the man alone. In Draco’s library. Among the dukedom’s priceless antiques.
“Yes, sir,” Dursley said anxiously.
“Your Grace,” Goyle added quickly.
When he figured Malfoy was set, he went back down to the kitchen to resume cooking. He made a quick salad to go with the steak. He plated the food and went back upstairs to serve Malfoy his dinner.
“I feel guilty. There’s so many people out there who die in the streets, with no one around to care, and here I am, being saved by a duke ….”
“Read to me?”
Potter’s laugh was self-conscious. “Yeah, I do. But let’s go down to the kitchen. Dinner is waiting.” He grabbed Draco’s wrist and urged him to follow.
Potter was watching Draco. It was obvious he liked the way Draco moved, liked how Draco commanded the space.
“What tosh,” said the middle aged woman. “Lady Granger is
If they’d been alone, Draco would have pressed his hands to his face. Instead he made his expression go blank. “I was only concerned for his health. The man thought he could out-pace a snowstorm.”
“What are you doing here, cousin?”
It was utter madness, but Draco refused to do anything about it.
Malfoy twisted away. “I know that, Potter.”
Outside, the stench was only a little better. Draco still had the taste of blood in his mouth. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw how everyone was staring at him.
“There are options, my love. We needn’t come to ruin.”
“I never wanted this to be a transaction.”
Draco took a moment to look around before he went to the bed. The room was brighter than the rest of the house, less cobwebs, more lived-in. Potter’s clothes were strewn on the floor, because of course they were. A broom was propped up in a corner.
“It’s not too bad, I don’t think. I just heard two old ladies gossiping about it while sampling the caviar. Did you really grow up in a barn?”
“You are laughing at me.”
His stomach twisted. “I would be honoured.” He followed Parkinson to the front of the room. He felt people watching him. He ignored the urge to pull at his tie.
Harry ignored the reference to his oh so scandalous parents. Instead he nodded eagerly. “Yes, Dudley. I wouldn’t need much money, either. As I already said, I’ve managed to earn a scholarship.”
“A servant? I’d sack them on the spot.”
“I don’t care about the price,” he said. “Pay anything to acquire enough supplies.”
made him pause. Harry turned just as the horse halted near him. The rider was young, nearly a boy. He was obviously a servant.
“I approached the wrong man, that’s all. I didn’t think. I saw one of my clients in Knockturn and I was too desperate to think. I just walked up to him and told him I was pregnant. I -
“Yes, ma’am,” he said, pressing her hand lightly.
The pub was crowded when they arrived, but he was with Harry Potter, so a couple promptly jumped up and offered their table to them.
“We just want an afternoon with the duke,” Granger said, a little too coldly. She was almost glaring at Parkinson.
Potter came around the table, a frown between his brows. “Are you all right?”
“Yes, of course.”
“Yes,” Harry said, and snaked an arm around his back. He pulled Malfoy even closer, his nose now buried in his soft hair.
They took off in a hard gallop. Harry muffled a screech and clung to the other man. The cold air burned against Harry’s face.
“It’s the truth.”
“I heard you’re good at potions,” Robards said.
Harry turned, expecting another servant. He stumbled back when he saw the duke galloping toward him on a magnificent white steed.
“I might like to see that.”
Harry muttered fuck under his breath, then cast a levitating spell on Draco. Very gently, he guided Draco to the bathroom, then lowered him into the bathtub.
,” he snarled, his nose now nearly brushing Harry’s. “You accused me of making you feel like a whore? You would really be his whore if you became his companion. You would be with him only for what he could give you.”
“I am honoured to have you in my home,” Mrs Gibbs said.
“I can’t stop thinking about you,” Theo said.
Harry looked down at the table. He was frustrated but he didn’t want to acknowledge why. He shouldn’t feel this intensely about Malfoy. They didn’t even know each other - not really.
“I hate them. I hate every last one of them.”
“Yes, or have you laid your hands on anyone else today?”
“What are you doing?” Harry felt weightless, his thoughts sluggish. Being this close to the duke made him feel utterly lost to himself.
“No, I believe she means it this time.” He sighed heavily. “Pans, I don’t think I can escape my fate much longer.”
“You can leave anytime you wish. But I want your baby to be comfortable while you two live here.”
“I bloody hate you.”
“Draco.” He pressed his lips to Draco’s neck, breathing him in.
“I’m tired of telling myself no,” Harry said finally.
Draco was fascinated. “You made Muggle food?”
Malfoy came at him until he was pressed against the wall. He poked Harry in the chest hard, then dragged his finger down until it met his belt. “Merlin, Potter. You are such an innocent.”
“How may I help you, sir?” Draco said with zero emotion in his voice. His gaze burned into Potter’s.
Harry put his back to him. “I’m sorry, Your Grace. I want you to leave.”
Lady Parkinson came closer to get a look at him. “Yes, I agree. Next time tell someone before making a dramatic exit.”
Ginny fluffed the pillow behind his head, her palms lingering on its soft texture. “You must admit the accommodations are top notch.”
Draco thought, but outwardly he smiled.
Barwald grimaced. “Medieval remedies but I suppose they can be effective in their own way.”
“Why?” Then Draco saw what he meant: Harry was covered in scrapes and bruises. His knees were bloody. Draco felt a surge of protective rage. “Who did this to you?”
“Enough, Mr Potter,” he said quietly.
Draco sat in the living room of their flat. He was alone. The sun shined through the curtains, right on his face, blinding him. He hated the sun. He hated the birds chirping outside. The love of his life was dead, and the entire bloody world should stop and take notice.
He walked alone for a few minutes. Then he heard the duke’s voice behind him.
“Ma’am?” Draco said.
Draco caught his eye and wiggled his arse again. He barked excitedly.
He wanted to yank Potter from his seat, drag him to somewhere private. Then he would get on his knees for Potter again, show him what he was missing, show him just how dirty a duke could be. Because Draco wanted it; he wanted it so badly—his mouth filled with Potter’s throbbing cock. Potter had the perfect cock; it was thick and velvety and Draco wanted him in his body … he wanted to both be inside Potter and Potter to be inside him.
It was just Draco’s luck that Potter called him over. Draco sauntered across the canteen to the table where Potter and his minions were eating lunch.
Longbottom smiled. “How are you doing?”
“Please tell me he’s finally at peace,” Draco said, sipping a calming potion and ignoring his fresh tears.
“No, she didn’t!”
Draco laughed. “Oh, yes. Her Majesty calls on me for quite a lot.”
“Where are we going?”
“I am grateful to both of you,” Harry said.
Malfoy’s eyes were closed when Harry returned to the bedroom. He sat down on the edge of the bed and whispered a spell to wet the flannel. He massaged the soap with the flannel, then touched the flannel to Malfoy’s forehead.
Potter looked at him with wide eyes. “Is that true?”
“Malfoy.” Potter wrapped a trembling hand around Draco and tugged. They both made noise.
Goyle shrugged. “That is between you and His Grace, sir.”
Harry’s mouth dropped open. “You do that?”
“I don’t.”
The man shot up in his seat, the side of his face pink from resting on his arms. He blinked his big emerald eyes at Draco. Draco watched as the man’s expression cleared, then grew panicked.
Granger looked livid but Parkinson was smirking. She looked like a cat about to capture its prey. Granger cleared her throat and took a sip of her tea.
“God,” Harry muttered. Draco had left early that morning. He now knew it was because he had work to do in Parliament. Stomach in knots, Harry said, “We have to witness the vote.”
Harry couldn’t help it: He moaned.
“Harry needs to tell you something. He says it’s a matter of life and death.”
Harry drew closer. He’d memorised the spell he wanted to use. He tried to meet Malfoy’s gaze, reassure him; but Malfoy was no longer in the mood for eye contact.
In the locker rooms, he tore off his kit and guards, and stepped into a private shower. He stood for a long moment under the spray of the water, letting the heat relax his muscles. Noise was dulled. His thoughts were calming down.
“Let go of me!” Harry cried. “You do not know my heart!”
you make me? In my book, that is worth some risk.”
“Nonsense. Whatever tasks you have for the day can wait until you’ve regained your health.” Draco snapped his fingers. “Bring Mr Potter hot tea and whiskey. Be quick about it.”
The day was blindingly bright, the wind a hot caress against Harry’s cheek. The crowd was roaring. Harry grinned and held up the struggling Snitch. He just won the match for the Magpies. He was on a winning streak.
“Person, I mean.”
“Is someone there?” Harry whispered.
“Oh, this is lovely,” Malfoy murmured. His cheeks were already turning pink from the steam.
“Call me Harry,” he growled, and pulled Draco into another kiss. Now with more confidence, he tipped Draco’s head back, resting a finger under his chin. He wrapped his arm around Draco’s lower back, urging him to surrender. Their erections brushed, causing both of them to moan.
“Yes,” Draco said.
” Malfoy now sounded desperate.
“I live here because it feels like home.”
“I refuse to do it to you.”
“You got me out of Azkaban. It’s the least I could do.”
“Give me what’s in your pocket.”
Frowning, Harry closed his eyes. He snuggled closer, his nose pressed to Draco’s coat. Draco felt the tension slowly leave him.
He tipped his head back, eyes fluttering. His eyelashes were dark and long. His cheeks were stained.
“Jesus, Harry,” Draco said, voice breaking. He slicked himself up and got into position behind Harry. They were still on their sides. He dragged his mouth along his throat. “Ready?”
Harry muffled a surprised gasp. “Malfoy?” he whispered harshly.
, he thought savagely.
“Well don’t.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest, hugging himself.
As they approached the steps to Parliament, holding their banners, yelling their chants, the police began to hit them.
Harry found his voice. “I—she didn’t tell you?”
“Yes. For a while now.”
Harry shifted in his chair. “I won’t do it again if it makes you uncomfortable.”
“You know we can’t let St Mungo’s continue to treat pregnant men so ghastly,” Hermione said. “I fully intend to bring it up to the Wizengamot the next time they are in session.”
“You caught me,” said Harry.
“And that is why I appreciate your company.” He glanced past her and saw that the duke was being introduced to a pretty blond girl. Other people were watching too, and they murmured to themselves. Harry overheard that her name was Astoria Greengrass. Trying not to be jealous, Harry had to admit that Miss Greengrass looked perfect for the duke.
Malfoy pressed him against the wall and kissed him. “I wanted it,” he said again, more firmly. “I want
Draco closed his eyes and drifted away. Sometime later, he heard Pansy set a cup on his bedside table. Draco stared at the cup without moving.
