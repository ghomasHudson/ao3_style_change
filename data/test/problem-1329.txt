, things that are in
Smoothing the paper out he wrote 'anger' on the sheet and handed it back. "You can keep it." Then he left, marching out into the snow of an early December morning.
"I have tons of papers to grade. If you need anything else, I'll be right there."
"That's your parents Harry, Lily, and James." He pointed to each one like Hermione had done and waits for his reaction.
"That's Theodore." The blonde sat and recrossed his legs.
A little longer today!
"You were married twice then?" Draco looked perplexed. "You said you became a therapist for divorce when your marriage fell apart if you met Theodore in school," Harry paused while Draco nodded.
Holding the boy against his body, Harry slowly walked them back to the island and lifted him up sitting him on top.
Draco's smile was wide, making his eyes crinkle, "Yes, it is different isn't it, I help people get over their marriage while he breaks them apart."
"Is it raining?" Harry asks, the thoughts coming to him quickly. He really only has problems remembering the people now. His memory is there, just a little blurry around the edges.
You're Somebody Else- flora cash
Maybe tonight would be the night he confronted Harry. But on the same token, that thought also terrified him. Pulling his glass up to his lips, he took a long sip. Letting the warm liquid run down the back of his throat, he began rocking his chair back and forth, pondering what exactly was his favourite food.
"That's right." He picks up the next picture, and it's one of Harry and him. They're standing, arms around one another, smiling, looking right into the camera. There dressed nicely, very nice.
The blonde didn't say anything for a long moments, "Well, aren't you going to tell me what's wrong with? Now that I have no obligations, I will hurt virtually no one if they find out, why am I fine now?"
Draco was fussing over his pen and notepad while Harry took the chance to look the other man over. He was wearing a light blue two-piece today, with dark blue striping. That seemed to be something he liked, stripes. He wore the same dark colour blue button-down and a tie that matched the light blue. A small yellow flower was pinned to his lapel and he had a neatly folded yellow handkerchief in his pocket.
The next photo was one where Rose, Harry assumed, had just been born, she was covered in goo and Ron, and he was dressed in the blue protection needed for a newborn, Ron looks absolutely disgusted, and Harry is smiling, looking over the doctor's shoulder.
"I guess I can go to the Gala." He responded, tugging the covers with him as he sat up. Ron climbed from his bed and clattered over to where his clothes had been discarded earlier.
Drarryandmycat!
"Grading papers." Harry chuckled and leaned up, taking another sip of water.
Taking a deep breath he blows over the top of his glass. Taking a sip he pulls his wand from his pocket sending firewood aflame. Moving into the livingroom he pushed himself down into an overstuffed armchair.
"I think I would ask how this is going to end." Ackley bit his lip and Harry moved closer, really he shouldn't, he should stop now and go into the living room, sit down and turn on the telly.
Draco offered him a smile, "How are you, Harry?" Opening his notepad he flipped to the next available space. Writing something at the top he regarded Harry for a moment.
His pale skin was glowing in the moon making him look like an angel or a ghost, Draco tried smiling but it didn't quite reach his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
The boy nodded quickly and Harry slowly slid into him. Ackley winced making him stop, but was soon pushing Harry to begin to move again.
Draco nodded, "It must be tough, she has always been in the presence of children or friends." Draco was keeping his voice neutral and his eyes focused on Harry. "Did something happen?"
"Draco?" He looks at Harry and nods, "I know where this usually hangs in our house." Dracos' eyes light up, and he gets the most boyish grin on his face. He hands him another.
"Ron!" Harry moaned out but quickly stopped as another wave of pleasure ran through him. He grabbed at the sheets, balling them in his hands.
Draco thought about Percy then, about the day he had spent with him, and more importantly, the kiss. Right there at the end was like looking through stained glass. It sent butterflies spiralling as soon as the thought came.
Draco smiles and stomps over to her, "Now, Miss Granger, that was our secret!" For some reason, he had an old country drawl, like ones you see in old Western movies.
"Care for each other." Draco supplied.
Draco smiled and waited for the other man in the hall, "It was excellent," Percy and he fell into step together. "It really did remind me of Mollys!" Percy beamed at him.
Here we are! Another chapter! We're getting into the good stuff now! I hope you enjoy!
"See, that's you, me, Ron" She pointed to everyone in the picture, smiling. Harry smiled then moved to the next one. "This was taken a few months before we graduated." The month after the war, they didn't look quite as happy as they had in the other picture Hermione had shown him, but they were there.
"We would do a lot more than kissing Harry." Closing his eyes, he leaned slightly into Billion, the most Draco had touched him since his return was the night Harry had remembered Sirius. Now, even just a brush made Draco look down and move away.
Instead of a pen in between his fingers, a small tumbler was there, full of some unknown alcohol. His hair was styled tonight though, and it took Harry back to sixth year.
"Did the children enjoy being with you?" Draco finally asked, sitting his fountain pen down on the notepad. Harry shrugged and turned his attention to the bookshelf.
"Before making a telephone call, do you rehearse what you are going to say?" Harry narrowed his eyes.
"Content, melancholy, wistfulness, pleased, gratified," Draco paused and heaved a sigh, "These are just synonyms for the same word Harry."
Ackley worked Harry's shirt off and eventually his tee as well. Harry pushed the boy back against the counter and slowly took off his trousers. He pulled Ackley back up and held him against his body.
Draco rolled his head on his shoulders, trying to placate himself. "Alright, well, we'll try it again this week. Any emotion you have at all, whether it's from a coworker or a friend, a lover, write. it. down."
"I venture to say I didn't either, it just...happened." Draco gave him another smile.
"Well, there's a first for everything, is there not?" Draco smiled and moved beside him.
"Now," Draco pants, "the next time you let out one of our secrets." He paused for dramatic effect, still in a southern drawl, "The punishment with be an hour of tickling!" She giggles and runs over to her dad, letting him pick her up and kiss her head.
“You look pretty clean for someone that just escaped Azkaban.” Too clean.
“Because when it comes to you, I want it all.” Draco was ashamed that this display of possessiveness was warming his heart. Maybe it was the Slytherin in him.
“They won’t. Dementors don’t bother me. They didn’t touch me the whole time I was in Azkaban. Actually they kinda started away.” He chuckled.
“You do?” Harry said in excitement.
“Can I take you out?” said Harry.
He didn’t know what to say to Harry and he just wanted to go inside. He chose not to speak as he opened the door and went inside. Leaving Harry to finish his meal alone. Hopefully through their bond he could understand Draco’s needs right now.
“Yes.” He hissed.
“Explain, you fucking lunatic.”
“Why do I love you?” Draco whispered. More to himself, but it was heard.
Draco told him that he was dating other people and for him being exclusive came with perks. Harry didn’t seem upset hearing that, just asked what Draco wanted.
He did want to ask whenever Harry would shower and come to bed, or when he would go to bed alone and wake up with Harry in his kitchen feeding his owl or even on the night Harry proposed to him. It just didn’t feel right to ask and deep down he felt he didn’t want to know the answer.
“Remember all that biting?”
“If that was the case, why didn’t you escape sooner?”
“You know I like to chase after you. Like a dog sniffing out his treat.” His white shirt tightened, showing more of his pecs as he shrugged.
“Where the fuck did you learn that?”
WIthin an hour they were paid and he reimburse Draco for any bills he paid already. By the end of the week he took Draco to Paris, where they wine and dined and fucked on the balcony of their hotel room.
“So, why’d you stay away?”
“I know some werewolves.”
It was at Hugo’s first birthday party that Harry asked him out. Not having anything to lose, he said yes. The first date was a disaster honestly. He was dating two other people, so losing Harry wouldn’t be much of a blow to his ego, yet, the fool asked him out again and again and again, so much that Harry thought they were exclusive.
Draco stayed silent.
“So the murdering isn’t a turnoff?” Joked Harry. Sadly, it wasn’t a turnoff. As far as he knew, the Minister was Harry’s only murder.
After graduating Hogwarts and repeating their 8th year they didn’t hate each other, but neither put in effort to go farther than a wave in the hallway. They were cordial and were polite at Ministry functions for the following years. It wasn’t until Ron got Pansy pregnant during a one night stand that they had to be around one another more often.
“I don’t pay the mortgage, it’s already in my name. Just yearly taxes. I’ve been pulling overtime lately anyway so I have more than enough to take some time to get to spend some time with Draco’s family.”
Laney and Annabee giggled as Mama swooned under one of Mother’s arms. Leaning her body against her wife’s side. “You’re such a charmer Er-bear. Keep this up and maybe I’ll extend my break to go a little while longer when we get home…”
“I do.”
“I never would, you may actually have to worry about him hurting me-ah!” Hadrian smacked Draco’s bicep with a pout that dissolved into a grin. “See! Abuse! I’m in danger Uncle Sev!”
Not something he saw coming, but a nice outcome.
-Ministry is corrupt as hell
The snake huffed and stayed put, tongue flicking affectionately against Hadrian’s cheek.
He had plenty of that left to give.
In the same house, another pair of lovers were mutedly speaking. Tom rubbing his partner’s back soothingly as his partner weathered through the anxiety attack they both had known was coming after the reveal at the bank.
“Or you won’t touch this ass for a month.” For emphasis, Hadrian slapped his own ass and swayed his hips enticingly as the brunet sauntered to the kitchen. Draco gaped quietly before reaching out both his arms.
“Stop manipulating your brother Anna, we both know you have him wrapped around your finger.” Her cold eyes glanced toward the family sitting next to her kids and Hadrian felt the temperature in the room plummet at least fifty degrees. Immediately she and her wife were firmly planted between their kids and the other family. Sara was the first to speak, and even she’d lost her care free smile.
The blonde paused, green eyes flashing in his mind. It was April, Hadrian wouldn’t be expecting it, but he also had the landline if he wasn’t at the café. He had a home, technically, it was Hadrian’s home. He’d always said that Draco was always welcome. The key in his pocket felt heavier than lead. His uncle saw his hesitation.
After breakfast James would throw him into his room, Lily had warded the door against being locked by James.
Well, his parents had money to give him a nice funeral.
Even if it's not with the light.
Alex was sitting nearly six feet away from the other three and each time he tried to scoot closer Laney simply turned towards him spitting proverbial fire and glaring. Hadrian was laying on his back with the little one using his chest as a pillow and seemed more than happy to just lie there and let it happen. Severus had to bite his lip hard as Alex crept forward and Laney threw a pen at him while hissing viciously.
.” Draco thought it was a little unfortunate that Dragma (male Dragma? They would figure this out. Maybe middle names?) didn’t laugh again or continue talking with that deep rumbling voice. Alex seemed to stew angerly at the two basically ignoring his existence. Ron, a Weasley, stayed quiet and watched with confusion.
Was gonna wait to post! But I got too excited. I'm going to try and wait a few days between updates, but what harm can one early update really do?
Best case scenario, he sneaks out no problem.
“It’s a little small, but it will work.” Laney snorted.
Hadrian sighed and forced himself out of the covers. Suni hissing in displeasure, but refusing to release him from her fully body cradle. Her eyes did wander however briefly to the kitten dozing on his nightstand. He was watching Marissa for Laney for the night, apparently the tike didn’t like exploding snap and Draco was a bigger fan of chess. Therefore, he was playing babysitting Uncle for the evening. It helped that Suni was now more curious about the kit than predatory, letting the feline explore in her coils without Hadrian fearing for her safety. Suni was well behaved when he said no, so he hadn’t been too worried to begin with.
“Do you think Sirius would help us as Lord Black? He loved Harry, he’d be so happy to see him again. Perhaps he’d even come to see Alex again, he misses Padfoot and Moony quite a lot. It’d be nice to have us all home together again, like old times.” James frowned.
“Five years and I hadn’t heard a word about this?” Draco looked for help but found all three men sipped their tea and avoiding eye contact. Even Hadrian wasn’t paying real attention, instead looking intently at the snake that had slithered just beneath his crossed legs. Hadrian was obsessed with snakes and a Parseltongue, so Draco really wasn’t all surprised.
The blond was leaning against the tree with him. Their hands were intertwined and those grey eyes covered with some of the most uppity muggle sunglasses Hadrian had ever seen. Suni was splayed across his lap, her golden scales creating a contrast to the other boy’s porcelain skin. Hadrian glanced at the couples and groups around the garden and back to Draco’s hand, twisted so firmly in his own.
Finally when they were done, and Ackley was drying his hands off Harry answered.
Harry suspected the cardigan was probably sleeveless and made just for this outfit. The thing that caught Harry off guard was the fact that the man also had very expensive loafers on, that pulled the green colour back in. The deep cut made into the loafers left his ankle exposed and the milky flesh that lay under made Harry want to fully undress the other man, just to see his skin. The pale white colour reflecting the sunlight as Harry slowly removes each article of clothing from the other man.
Once they were in the car and out of the hospital parking lot, Draco began talking.
Draco's hand wavered a few inches away from Percy's front door. His coat hung limply from his thin wrist, and his wedding band shone dimly in the light.
Draco hated Harry, hated him for making him think that he actually cared for Draco, hated him and everything about him, but at the same time, loved everything about him.
When he made it to the front door, he carefully slid his hand from under the stack. Opening the door, he slowly walked in, the stack wobbling dangerously. Steadying it, he looked around the foyer, trying to figure out the best plan of attack.
(See the end of the chapter for

When had he become so focused on knowing what the blonde was wearing and how he sat? When had his mind hyper-focused on how he held his pen, and how he talked, how he wore his hair? When had he realized that he wanted to see the day when Draco's wedding band disappeared?
Much love and happy reading,
Harry was beginning to think of what would happen if he slept with the boy when Ackley came back into the small living-room. He had slung a travelling robe over his shoulders to keep from the wind.
Reopening his eyes, he looked down at his wedding band. How had he let it get this far? Taking a deep breath, he pushed off the wall, moving towards the back door, he opened it and slowly made his way into the garden.
"How are you since are our last visit." Harry offered for him to sit which Draco accepted, Harry realized then that when the other man sat, he ran his hands along the back of his legs as if he was wearing a dress.
Oh, and they’ll be here at the school again, but they might not see us.
The table startled again, Draco included this time. His love had looked like his lord already and now he was basically the man’s (slightly more handsome) clone. His lord, though shocked, looked very amused. Raising a hand and pointing to his partner.
Sara refocused her attention onto Lily, “What does your son have, an owl?”
It was a rather good day.
“Where did they get that?”
“Lo there I call to you, lo there I call to you, lo there you call to me. Lady Magic hear my plea! Cast me off from this tainted blood, for I feel no love in this home, no taste from its food, no warmth from its shelter and no kinship to its inhabitants. I am estranged within this blood and offer up my own to rid myself of that which binds me. Lady Magic I renounce the Potter Family for its negligence, for its abuse, and for the terror it inspires and the crimes against your gifts. With your blessing free me. So mote it be.” The circle glowed beneath him and he could feel hands. Curling around his core deep in his chest. The feeling was both heavenly and hellish, feeling eyes studying him like a bug under a microscope. It burned him from the inside out. Until it stopped and there was a tug and suddenly Hadrian felt a rush of relief.
-No worry about getting caught for underage magic
Silence, until of course like the pop-up book from hell, his sister bolted up right and whooped. Clapping loud and clear which egged on the rest of the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs to join as he let the female professor remove the cap and he smoothly walked to the empty seat between Laney and Draco. Ignoring the incredulous stares easily as he ignored the gaze of his brother borrowing into his back.
Severus paused, as far as he knew when the younger Potter went missing he had never gone to another family. Albus had said he was sent to live with a branch of relatives in the muggle world for better education and a better safer life. Seeing as the Dragma’s adoption began processing a couple weeks after Hadrian went missing from his aunt and uncle’s home; there was little chance he’d went to a bad foster home before the Dragma’s got hold of him.
“Come out on the balcony with me.” Hadrian didn’t fight or question it as he let Draco pull him up from the vanity and lead him to their small master patio. Hadrian’s herbs swayed softly in the brisk night wind, still blooming in the beginning spring. The stars shone brilliantly above them, making Hadrian smile with tired eyes. He’d never get sick of this view.
The headmaster’s office was cluttered and messy, it gave Hadrian hives and made him nearly twitch at Laney’s side. Even his more messy and excitable twin seemed a little discontent with the mess, and then she was downright murderous when she looked at the desk.
stood above them all, and easy smile and strong lean arms. Laney batted her eyes back and forth between the two of them.
Draco was more than pleased to escort his mate through the alley. His hand on Draco’s arm as they looked at all the sweet shops, the quidditch store, that stupid joke shop run by the Weasels that unfortunately Hadrian seemed to adore. Draco’s favorite was the apothecary, listening to his Uncle and his boyfriend bicker about the proper way to brew (potions for his uncle and elixirs for his boyfriend, the same thing really, but Hadrian insisted a few elixirs differed from potions) before they bound together to spout theories on how to improve each other’s concoctions. Their lord seemed pleased to visit the book store, where Narcissa, him, and Draco were arguing on the legality of Dark Arts textbooks versus Defense Against the Dark Arts.
And he was right. Alex glowered at him, but when he tried to get him into detention he got points removed for picking on his brother again. After all, it was well known that Alex tormented him and his sister. And it was ‘well known’ that Hadrian didn’t retaliate unless pushed and often did do in quiet harmless ways.
“We have to.” James mouth was set, and Lily didn’t try to change his mind.
“Mama!” The red-haired girl whined; Hadrian only gave a firm nod. His arm slung around his sister’s waist. “I swear, terrorize one elementary school and you’re called a trouble maker! Please! They were all amused and you know it!”
“I share a room with you. I
“Erin here is a little magic, she never tried to be an active part in the wizarding world however. She’s a high ranking officer in an international anti-bio-terrorism unit, but she was certain to bring both muggle and magic culture into the house when Harry joined our family. Also the books certainly helped us understand that our other two daughters were showing signs of accidental magic as well. I was wondering why the hell I kept losing the TV remote when it was time for bed.” Snape raised a brow. Erin answered.
James Potter would pay.
“I actually wanted to speak to you about something.” Hadrian looked up at him, those green eyes looked so familiar, it itched at Severus, but he still sat calmly in front of the boy. Reassured when he only sipped at his coffee calmly. “Draco says you have memory problems?”
, when Alex couldn’t even get a bloody wave. Cooing with a disgustingly sweet and devoted tone that didn’t match the apathetic boy he’d seen Harry twisted into.
“Now that we’re all awake, there is something I would like to talk to you about. I was brewing last night and I brewed a purging potion for you, this is all your choice however Hadrian. Only take it if you want to.” Severus placed the bottle onto the counter and the raven studied it. The color was a nearly clear blue and it smelled like a flower field, it wouldn’t taste nearly as pleasant however he knew.
It was like being in a house of over emotional toddlers. One didn’t understand basic human decency, one wanted everything to go her way, and one liked to hit. Hadrian was grateful Annabee’s tantrums were far and free between and that her biting phase was extremely short lived when he played the big brother card and told her how disappointed he was. Her little sobs had been heartbreaking when she’d realized how upset hitting made him, but she’d never bitten another kid at the farmer’s market again and Hadrian had showered her in kisses and cuddles after timeout.
“Nothing?!”
“You have my eyes. Just like I thought.” A warm smile broke out onto his face. “Looks like you have Severus dark hair though, and his cheeks.”
parents too?” Dumbledore’s smile became strained, the twinkle in his eye dimming.
“With the potion you’re making we might remember.” Severus sighed into his chest.
“Be a dear and take their coats.” Draco smirked.
Hadrian woke to a banging at the door, growling, Hadrian crawled out from under the bed. Glaring at the door angrily.
“He’s my-“
Hadrian almost felt bad.
“Then tell the aurors where Potter Manor is and let them check on the Potters, if they’ve done nothing wrong there is no harm in that?” Snape finished it was a satiric smile that had even Albus pausing nervously. They all looked extremely guilty. Severus was only one of many who were hounding him. The Potters were behind wards, he was in front and center at the school fielding Auror Inquiries and Howlers from many Lords and Ladies.
“I’m aware. I’m here to take both of you in. You’re wanted for kidnapping, disregarding a restraining order, and quite a few other things. Does Lily know truly what you’ve done? Or have you just pacified her with Dumbledore’s greater good argument?” James snarled at him and Sirius just looked his fill. Before James started flinging spells at him.
Both of them.
Shoving the pieces of his wand into his pocket, he darted out the door. The halls were dreary and oppressive, but the magic still enveloping him was intoxicating and left him feeling high. As if nothing could touch him. Whipping around a corner, he slammed into a small body. Sending them both careening to the floor. Alexander lay under him, shocked.
“No. no.nononono.” Hadrian froze beside him, obviously hearing the screaming coming from the office. Laney was gripping at his robes anxiously, even Draco looked nervous though he hid it quite well. Pressing Hadrian behind himself and throwing on his pureblood mask. Huddled into him like scared children. Snape paused.
Hadrian surveyed the room with a quick glance and sharp eyes. Four beds, a large bathroom. Cool with dark elegance, but no windows, no escape. It both soothed him and made him crawl up the wall. Laney’s nails dug into the back of his neck and he blinked back to reality, memories of cupboard neatly shoved back into a different corner of his mind for now. Draco looked around as well, a small frown on his lips.
“Lucius, be kind on the boy. That reminds me so much of my eighth year at Hogwarts, the way I would drool after my husband. Though he was more subtle with his teasing. Young love in times like these is… refreshing.” A few moments and they were all seated at their dining room table. A warm Cherrywood table that Draco knew Hadrian had seen him ogling when the brunet had jokingly dragged him to an ‘Ikea’.
Hadrian gagged as his twin laughed in his expense. Annabee stared confused before mirroring her brother’s look of disgust on instinct. His words were still bland, but they bounced with more cadence that Snape had heard yet when he spoke. “I love the both of you. Keep it in the bedroom and away from my eyes.”
Laney’s fist in his face certainly halted that in its tracks.
Sara hesitated slightly, but Severus was quick to understand why.
-Dead boys don’t go home
“He was dark! That scar on his forehead? A sign that the Dark Lord put a horocrux in him! A piece of his soul! As long as Harry is alive, You-Know-Who can come back again and again and Alex will never be safe. Is one boy’s life really worth the entirety of Britain?” James looked so pathetic suddenly, at his mercy. At wand point. So unlike the loyal boy he once knew and unlike his beautiful, beautiful godson. Who was so strong. Who suffered under this man’s hand.
was the one who liked treacle tart and she was the one obsessed with books on charms.
“Sirius?!”
“We need to get a picture for the moms. Mama would lose her god damn mind. This is just her aesthetic.”
Hadrian grinned at his Dad, “Now, since we have this all sorted out. How about you and Narcissa help me with wedding plans for after you all win that stupid British war against the old man? We have a lot of work if we’re going to win a war and pull off a marriage in a timely fashion!”
And he
There was a time crunch, but there was also no reason to rush like a Gryffindor. He’d sleep on it, look at the lists in the morning to see if he’d miss anything and a make a decision. The back up plan as always was to throw himself out the window and crawl to freedom in the dead of night. Hadrian sighed softly and got up, yanking off the duvet and pulling it under the bed with him as he crawled into the safe space.
He could hear James thundering footsteps getting closer as the front door flung itself open and Hadrian tore himself out of the wards. Momentarily stunning James as it shouldn’t have been possible with his Head of House Order. Shouldn’t have been possible if Hadrian were still a Potter.
Hadrian blinked as Draco tapped his cheek. “Eyes up. You look sharp. Your mothers are the kindest people to exist that I’m not even sure their real. Severus is on our side and respected as a no-nonsense man who’s rescued countless Slytherin’s from abusive home. Laney’s a good holy terror and attached to you like an STD. And my father’s the best lawyer that exists in this country and everything is going to be alright. Don’t you trust me?”
The sun was gloriously warm against his face, and his torso was also comfortable warm as Annabee slept sounding against his chest under the large tree. The sky was clear and a bright blue, not a cloud in sight in the garden of the Malfoy Manor.
Lucius shoved back any unease, he was a child and a perfectly sane and polite child who was simply powerful and upset for understandable reasons. Magic could be uncontrollable and spurred on by strong emotions, especially when untampered by age and experience. Draco talked about the boy as a treasure, quite infatuated with him honestly. The raven was good. Smiling gently and as calmingly as possible, he took Hadrian’s balled fists into his own grasp.
Dumbledore couldn’t participate in the proceedings in as a judge. It seemed he was working to be the Potter’s legal counsel, irregardless he still held a lot of personal and political sway as a witness. Hadrian’s skin crawled as he felt those blue eyes fixate on the side of his face. Alex’s gaze had less power than this one. Every time Alex’s eyes threatened to have him get a flashback to James, the memory of Snape dragging his ass like a misbehaving toddler dispersed the memories. Albus’ eyes were more dangerous. They made him feel like it was his fault, that he deserved everything he suffered.
“Tutoring. Eight o’clock Friday night Esmerelda. Piers, eloquently written. Twenty points to Slytherin for teamwork and correct answers. See me after class, both Dragmas.” Laney’s head dropped to the desk with a thud and Hadrian just nodded easily and continued taking his notes. Draco snickered quietly and later on in case Hadrian and Draco watched in awe at the complete failure Vince, Greg, and Laney were making of their potion. Their own was simmering and giving off a soft silver vapor. The other’s had black billowing smoke.
“Harry… we just want to be a family. I’m your mother! I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you, I want to be here for you now.” She tried to step closer, but Hadrian shuffled to keep the bed between them. James loomed behind her staring at something, Alex was looking at him beseechingly. Lily had enough sense to stop trying to get closer.
“Of course! Come on in, my name’s Laney! This is my brother, we’re both first years. What’s your name?” The three boys looked thrown off in the face that was Laney Dragma, but the blonde was the first to relax. Giving a brilliant smirk that caught Hadrian’s eye.
Dark and murky, the water beneath the ice swirled agitated and aggressively. Severus placed a foot on the edge, cracking the surface slightly and gasping as the memory washed over him.
"When I got married and it slowly fell apart I guess." Harry nodded and motioned to the picture of him and the other man he had just pushed down.
In seconds Harry's pace was erotic. Ackley's legs were wrapped around Harry, pushing him further into him. Harry held himself above the blonde and would every so often dip down and trail kisses down him or press one to his lips.
A warm smile sat on his face.
When Draco finally thinks she's been punished enough, he puts her down, hands behind his hips, leaning back on them, breathing hard.
Harry scoffed, "Of course! I'm still family, she still has three grandchildren by me, I mean, she's the only mum I got! She doesn't just love me because I married her daughter."
"We talk more now that the kids have decided what they want to do." Draco flashed him another smile but wiped it away quickly.
"Same time next week." He agreed. Percy smiled and began zipping up his coat.
"You're going to have to remind me of this question when we're do-" He was cut off by a bubbling moan pushing it's way to the surface.
If Molly only knew what Ron and Harry had done in their old room over their Yule break while staying with her. She would probably be upset with them both for the rest of their lives, what with Ron and Harry both being divorcees from two people she held very dear? ~ it wouldn't bode well with the family.
Draco smiles warmly and nods, sitting the pictures down on the sofa. Rosie runs over to Hermione, who is sitting by Harry's side.
"I'm swamped, actually. Apparently, they saved all the good cases until I got back." Draco nodded and flipped another page in his book.
"Nightmares again?" He turned and saw Draco standing at the entrance to the hall. "The only bad thing with remembering is like you're going threw it all again." Draco slid into the stool across from Harry and took a deep breath.
Harry smiled once more and leaned against the island, he watched as Ackley read through a page then, licked the tip of his finger, and flipped it.
"Um, no, not really. I didn't know that much about him. All I know is what you've told me." Draco responded, setting his mug down.
The other man didn't stop at Harry's neck, instead unbuttoning his uniform and kissing down his chest.
Happy reading and much love,
They were both dressed formally and seemed very happy. Suddenly Draco stood and moved over to his desk, pushing all of the pictures sitting there face down.
The gargoyle leaped out of his way as he swept up into the office. Portraits, ghosts, and Fawkes alike ignored the fact he was trespassing. Fawkes even helpfully taking the Headmasters visitor’s log and burning it to ashes to stop it from recording his entrance. Unfortunately from the look of the fireplace, all recent letters were burned as well. Severus growled.
“There’s memory loss. There isn’t a doubt about that, if it was due to any tampering either you or they covered any trace of it very well. Was your last blackout your school year?” A nod. “Then seeing as you’re out of school, I wouldn’t worry too much. If you have another blackout, let me know as soon as possible. As well as give me any people who might have been around you.”
“Me, so it was August first.”
“So, pesto is hate sauce?”
Hadrian blinked with mild surprise as the adults were already seated at the table, looking a little worse for wear. Tired and worn down. The man smiled at them gently and ducked past Tom, his father, to get into the kitchen. Pulling a box of pastries out of the fridge and tossing them on the counter for everyone to pick at. The pot of coffee was already brewed to Hadrian’s delight. Tom or Severus must have made coffee for them.
Alex was left gaping, his wand tightly grasped in his hand
“Think nothing of it. I’ll get your rooms ready. Draco, let’s leave them to relax for a moment. You’re going to be helping me.” Draco went to protest, but Hadrian only had to glance at him with a single brow raised before Draco was standing up. Abandoning his plate.
Draco remembered that one Christmas they’d shared. Their first one as mates.
“Merlin willing I have been waiting for this.” With that Hadrian brought his fist down and broke Alex’s nose in one swoop. Stopping his screaming abruptly as Hadrian hauled him up by his collar and hissed directly into his face. “Maybe this will give you some food for thought when you think its okay to watch your father kidnap and beat a child he lost custody of for a
Hadrian froze.
It almost looked like Alex’s room, or what little he saw of it that one time he snuck out of the attic.
“So, as I understand it, you’re Harry’s adoptive sister, yes?” The headmaster gave another grandfatherly smile as Laney scowled and Snape glided behind them.
. Literally anywhere else but here is
“Last night.”
Laney’s jaw was hanging out of her head as she stared, openly gawking before shutting her mouth and grabbing onto the side of his robes. Easily, he threw an arm over her shoulder. He’d gained a decent amount of height when he joined his real family. When a tap on his shoulder had him breaking his reverence to glance behind him. Breath freezing like ice in his throat.
“Imagine having such an ego that you take a losing case to court under the delusion you win and you muck it up so badly that you’ll be lucky to say a Most Noble House by the end of the PR nightmare that was just unearthed?” Laney gave him a confused look. “I’ll explain why later, it’ll help you understand why Sev is such a big deal to all of us here and why the Potters are going to lynched in the newspapers.”
And if he wasn’t damn right, puzzle it was. Ministry B.S. not letting him drop the last name because of some stupid heirship and voting seats.
The courtroom was already packed with the Lords and Ladies as they shuffled their way to the defendants area. Hadrian bit the inside of his cheek, glancing either way, paling a bit when he caught sight of the Headmaster.
“I didn’t remember him Tom. I thought the few memories I had were dreams, the dragon plushie in my vault. I don’t remember being pregnant, I don’t remember naming him, watching him grow or crawling for the first time. And that paper…” Severus shuddered in his arms. “Tom, do you even know was the Carotid Artery is?”
Snape rolled his eyes, “Hadrian’s familiar.”
After a minute his Uncle covered his mouth. The dark eyes, usually so calm and even were red and misty as he kept glancing from the parchment up to the boy beside him. Hadrian cocked his head curiously onto his shoulder as even his own father looked at the finished stack of paper and went sheet white, looking at Hadrian with a new reverence reserved for very few people. Severus’ hand-dipped low enough that with a squint Draco could read the scrawl on the top.
Hadrian felt a similar grin tug at his lips to read HAYDEN in bright pink crayon on an attached letter. Handing off their mother’s letter to Laney he decided to read his baby sister’s  letter first.
Hilariously enough, the killing blow didn’t even come from Lucius, but rather Dowager Longbottom, Neville’s grandmother. She was wearing a lace trimmed dress with a large hat as was her usual appearance. She had a stern frown on her face with disproval heavy in her eyes, Hadrian suddenly remembered that Neville had grown up suspected to be a squib until nearly age ten. Draco grinned beside him.
“Our room at home is half this size. Also, I’m pretty sure that is a bloody hot tub.”
“Anything else we should know about sweetheart?” Hadrian took a sip of his coffee, before letting a hand wander down to slip into Draco’s back pocket cheekily. Giving his parent’s a sly wink while Draco simultaneously wanted to grin like a loon and crawl into a hole and die before his fiancé’s parents murdered him and hid the body.
Tears were clearly visible as one of the twin’s mothers paced agitatedly, hands shaking and still muttering under her breath. Distressing the children further as he pushed them further behind himself. Hidden behind his robes.
And it was her fault.
“You corrupted him. He’s a lion like the rest of us Potters on the inside.” Laney rolled her eyes and pressed into Hadrian’s side as he struggled to breathe again. He sounded so much like James it was scaring him. Soft hands gently intertwined with his and squeezed.
“Erin works in the military, I take care of the kids and run a soap making business out of my home. I sell at the local farmer’s market as well, it works well because the kids play with the other children at the market while I sell. The other moms are more than happy to watch the playground for the merchants.”
The other boy seemed to falter when he caught sight of his biological twin, before he waved and made a motion for Hadrian to come closer. A small grin on his face and a light in his eyes that spoke of glee. Hadrian for his part gave a slow blink before turning his back to their other boy, face smooth and blank as glass.
The image of a happy baby with big green eyes. Not seeing him anymore as James pushed and pushed Alex at him. The last time he’d seen his godson was the image of Hadrian looking out from the window. Eyes obscured by the window panes, hair messy long waves and laying his head down on the windowsill. Next thing Sirius knew he was gone.
That, made sense. All his parents, legal and illegal.
Crammed under a bed, with hot tears beginning to stream down his cheeks. He never wanted his mother more than that moment now.
Obviously, the sight of a very bloody seven year old boy is off putting as the woman panics, pressing the baby into his gangly limbs in a rush to get a first aid kit and yelling for Laney to get some towels. It made Harry feel a muted warmth, a little fond at the concern of a woman who’s never even met him. But he was so far disassociated with the body tagged with his name he couldn’t fully comprehend it. Until a gurgle caught his attention.
The blonde fell to the ground, panting as the adults followed him. They all crowded into a small dark alley. Uncle Severus was bleeding from a small cut on his forehead, but overall, they were safe. For now.
NEW PROJECT IS UP!!! I added it to the collection named Contracted Death
“My parents bought us a house near base as a wedding gift. I make a decent income from my business, but Erin makes quite a bit of money from her job. 60,000 a year roughly, more if there is an attack and she’s deployed to get it under control. So our bills are rather low, her sec is international, so her superiors give us some money for housing as well. We have a decent savings and investments in both Gringotts and the muggle world. I also bought stock in Microsoft when it was founded in 1975,” Sara winked. “Sufficient to say in a few more years my net worth is going up.”
The dark haired boy didn’t even meet his gaze however, too busy staring at other people as the hat above him yelled Gryffindor and he was off to join Ron and wait eagerly for his brother as McGonagall continued to listen before yelling out with a small tone of confusion.
Alexander lit up as Hadrian’s gaze slid over to him. “Harry! Why have you been sitting with the snakes, come on. You should be with me don’t you think? We should be catching up, I haven’t seen you in years. Please?” Draco snorted.
“The same reason Fawkes hasn’t saved you. You both aren’t worth it. And because I need to protect my godson from the rot you seem insistent to spread. The press will kill him if James started spouting that shit. I’ll let the world burn before anyone touches Hadrian. Which is why you’re not going to remember any of this.”
His leg had healed amazingly after his ordeal and the ministry. The best part was Lucius insistence to replace his wand with a custom wand. He mourned his holly and phoenix feather wand near daily, however the Malfoy Senior had gotten his hand on a search warrant for the Potter Manor and found the feather his core was made out of in Potter’s office, in a warded desk drawer. In France, his new wand was born, a birch wand with his phoenix feather core responded more beautifully than his premade holly wand ever had.
“Nonsense. He’ll meet a variety of people in his life. This is good practice.”
He definitely saw where the Slytherin came from now.
Mooney was a quiet and kind man who was working with Severus to make sure Hadrian stayed up to speed with his schoolwork. The two men were ruthless of making sure Hadrian went above and beyond on his studies, until Padfoot interrupted to ‘save Hadrian’s brain from the book worms’. Watching the three bicker brought Hadrian a special joy and he rejoiced when Mama and Narcissa locked them in a closet together and they came out blushing and holding hands. All three of them.
Standing up straight. “The fuck do you mean?”
“No, no. A snake buddy of mine said he had friends that needed help.”
“You’re mine then.”
Draco told him he would never be opening his wallet in Harry’s presence and Harry needed to be paying all of his bills. Not batting an eye, Harry asked if that was it. He said yes.
“You still look good.” The first words in over five years. Looking his ex up and down, Harry looked good as well, but he wasn’t going to tell him that. His shaggy curls had gotten longer. Half of it was up and his chin was riddled with a dark five o’clock shadow.
Waving a hand at him. “I don’t date fugitives.”
He sighed. “Yeah, but I don’t trust you and you’re still a fugitive.”
“So you chose murder for eternal love?”
They sat in silence for a while. Watching the trees sway with the wind. He noticed Harry was staring at his hand. He honestly didn’t know what he would do if Harry reached for it. His trust with Harry was broken. There was a ritual on his soul without his permission and apparently snakes are besties with werewolves.
Another thing was in the last two years of their relationship, Harry started to bite him. Harry has always loved having his mouth on him, but in those two years, he wanted Draco to be bruised with his bite. Bites that drew blood. Draco had to limit him to once a week otherwise Harry would have done it at least once a day. The bites would usually happen during sex or affter Draco was sated from an orgasm. Harry would lick the bite and worship that spot, whispering words of adoration to Draco.
“Of course.” He said cheerfully. “The werewolves wanted the Minister dead in exchange for teaching me the ritual.”
“Since when?”
Harry has always been a bit of a lunatic, even saying a bit sound dumb to his own ears, but a lunatic none the less. They dated for five years while Harry was a Curse Breaker and he did freelance flying lessons to children.
“I won’t ask how you know where I was, so instead, I’ll ask why. Why are you here?”
Harry smiled. “Like I said. An old ritual. We are forever bonded. Any incarnation will be destined to reunite. I’ve heard past life memories may show up as well.”
Draco laughed. “Not until this month’s bills are paid.”
“Sorry. Guess that was too soon.”
“Fair.”
“Killing the Minister of Magic gets you some perks with magical creatures.” A bright smile on his face.
He began to notice more snakes around their home. He even caught Harry talking to one a few times. He always introduced Draco to the snake and would tell the snake how much he loved Draco and to make sure he was safe if he wasn’t around. He didn’t think anything of it. He was in love with an eccentric man and snakes weren't a new thing to him.
“Are you sleeping with the other men?”
“Harry…” Draco sighed.
“Is this related to the murder?”
“How did you even befriend them? Were they ever in our home?”
“We needed to be apart for a while.”
Grateful that Milly was in the barn, he didn’t want whoever this muggle might be to see something unnecessary.
The sight that met him upon opening the door wasn’t pleasant.
“The werewolves.”
Luckily Milly interrupted them and told them dinner was ready. He told Milly to bring them both a plate. After she did, Harry told her thank you as Draco stood up. Plate in hand.
Harry flinched. “Well, that was actually a part of an old ritual, that would ensure our souls would always meet and be connected.”
He yelled out that he would be there in a moment and quickly braided his hair into two plaits. He didn’t want to misplace himself. His hair needs a trim quite badly. His hair nearing waist length was full of maintenance.
"And that's Rons and I's wedding." The next picture she showed was the same day, and Harry had a bottle of some alcohol in one hand, and it was squirting everywhere, onto Ron and Draco and Ron's brothers, but they looked happy.
Drarryandmycat.
"I guess we never got around to it."

"So don't stop." He mumbled. Draco scoffed.
Sticking his key into the handle, he turned it and waited for the satisfying pop of it unlocking. Pushing it open, he slammed it behind him, wincing at the crashing sound that ran through the house.
Harry made quick work of taking Draco. When they were done Draco panted against the wall.
Harry shook his head, "No, why? What's happened?" This was the most alive Harry had felt in ages. Draco offered a smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You mentioned last time that you weren't sure how you should feel about all of this," Draco paused and took a deep breath, "Do you still feel uncertain?"
Some were framed, some were not. Some were small, some were big. Draco had a satchel around his shoulder, and little Rosie was clinging to it. Draco had on a navy raincoat, and Rosie had a pink one.
"That's when Draco met her the first time in the hospital. He brought his work with him so he could be there with us. You guys have a copy of this picture hanging in your hallway."
Draco didn't say anything and instead went back to his notepad. Sometimes Harry wondered what Draco was writing with so much rapt about. Harry peered at his watch.
Draco's ever-present smile was there. "Did you happen to work on my assignment?" He moved on carelessly, taking no time to turn the attention back to Harry.
"Why does it matter? We're not friends." Harry's voice came out a little harsher than he intended, but, after all, it was like he was dealing with a stranger.
"No, and I asked for his consent twice before we even began doing anything." Draco shrugged and pulled his notepad out.
"He doesn't come to these things, he doesn't like be surrounded by people who are totally different than him." Draco had married a muggle?
"I figured it was a good bit of change."
Soon enough, they had both came.
Kicking the door shut, he moved into the sitting room, dumping the papers in one of the tiny chairs. He took a deep breath. Harry leaned against the french doors to the living room, waiting to see how long it took his husband to say something to him.
I'm not going to try and explain the gap! But if you've stuck around~thank you so much! Here's another short one, I have this week off and I'm in a writing mood, so! Hopefully, more is to come. If you're new! Thanks for reading!
"Are you uncomfortable in my presence?" Draco asked, readying his pen.
His mouth fell open when he saw his husband's chest, "Harry, your, your chest!" Harry looked down at his chest. Deep red slashes laid there, swollen and bruising. Harry looked back up to Draco.
He could remember Billion and him laid out on Harry's desk, having just gotten done with each other. He could remember Lucius calling for Draco to join the Death Eaters.
When he finally came inside, Harry had already gone to bed. Draco was slightly tipsy and didn't really feel like lying down, so he began grading papers. A few hours later, Harry stumbled into the kitchen, rubbing his eyes.
Ridding himself of his satchel and coat he flipped on the lights. Pulling his wand from his holster he flicked his wrist, sending his tea kettle hurtling towards the stove.
"Do you realize you have a nervous habit of trying to dissect the life of whoever's company you're in?" Draco asked almost suddenly. Harry snorted and leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees.
He had on jeans, Harry noticed right away, he had never worn jeans before. A frumpy Slytherin green jumper hung off his thin frame making him seem bigger than he was.
Drarryandmycat!
Harry let his head fall back onto the pillow. How could he have forgotten that? It was a huge jump. "The doctors said you might never wake up-" Ron began but trailed off and threw his head back into his hands. Hermione was looking away from Harry like it was too painful to look at him.
"Um, I think the Avery family maybe, they were mostly sorted into Gryffindor. They ran ports and such before settling down into London, we were betrothed for a while until they snitched." Draco made a mirthful noise when he found a book about the different families.
"Harry, that's not something to be brushed aside. You probably need a check-up." Draco stood and moved over to Harry, reaching out, he went to check Harry's pulse. Harry pulled his arm away and smiled at Draco.
"How are the kids doing?" The blonde man had dressed warmly today. Wearing black trousers and a deep blue jumper that had black elbow patches. We still wore dress shoes though he had a heavy Inverness style coat hanging on his coat rack.
Another thing was Billion and Harry's relationship, this will have more elaboration as we go on, just as Harry's and Draco's, so don't jump to conclusions! Don't hate Billion just quite yet, give him some time!
Draco had still been awake when Harry had come in later that night.
Once they're gone, Draco grabs his pictures and bag, sitting next to Harry's bed.
I dearly hope nobody was harshly affected by my lack of tags and I am praying my writing isn't too confusing! Remember I'm here for you, and if I ever do something to offend or not to your liking please tell me and I will be happy to change it up for you!
"How are the children?" The blonde man asked, uncrossing and recrossing his legs.
"Oh," Ron panted out, "Hermione wanted to know if you're going to come to the Gala tomorrow." Harry closed his eyes and tried to think.
Drarryandmycat!
"Little did I know, keeping him in it was only hurting him more." Draco stopped. "When I had finally had enough we split, then two years later she died. It cut him deep, the death of his mother."
He had been standing the spray of the hot water, thinking of Percy for a long while before he felt hands encompass him.
Harry hummed, "Yes and no." Draco's grey eyes were pouring into Harry and the raven-haired man wondered what they were searching for.
Percy pulled away mere seconds into the kiss, though, and looked down at the ground.
"Why are you interested?" Harry held the book tightly under his arm.
Harry sighed, "Yes, why?"
"You may feel fine, but that doesn't mean you are. How many times did they Crucio you?" Harry shrugged and took another sip of water. Draco threw him a disbelieving look but dropped the matter nonetheless.
Harry sighed and leaned against the wall, making Draco lookup.
"Oh, hello, Percy, what a lovely surprise. Um, usually just Mr Malfoy." Percy's hands were buried in his trouser pockets, and he was perched on a desk facing Draco's. He nodded and smiled.
"How do you take it?" Draco smiled and took the glass from Percy to do it himself.
Draco sipped at his tea and thought about a good way to tell Percy his thoughts.
"Do you mind- could you lay with me for just one minute, then you can go and sign the papers?" Draco nodded and moved around the bed to lay down.
The red-head was soon beating into Harry quickly, sending only pleasure through him now.
-------------------------------------
"Mmm, maybe." Draco smiled again and wrote something else down. "Ron and I have been mates since, well, practically forever. We've played this cat and mouse game since we were old enough to desire each other sexually."
"I would like that." Harry smiled and told the boy to go pack.
After a few seconds of composure, Harry went to find Draco. Once he had scoured the whole house and had seen no sign of Draco, he went out into the garden, where he found Draco on his knees over a flowerbed full of different flowers.
Harry closed his eyes and leaned back in the chair, "You're not a horrible human being." Harry sat up and watched as Draco wrote things down on the sheet of paper.
"Blaise just left a few minutes ago. I was just winding down."
It was only moments like this when Draco wanted to take Harry into his arms and not say anything about Billion. Clearing his throat, he put his readers back on and began scratching at the sheet.
The clock on Draco's wall chimed at noon, signalling their session was over.
If he only knew that Harry would love to undress him and kiss all down his beautiful, freckled body.
"I do, but, I'm also anxiety-ridden and fear saying the wrong thing. I will also school my voice into different tones depending on who I'm talking with."
Kiss With a Fist- Florence + the Machine
"Hey, Draco, I'm sorry if I-" Draco cut him off by pressing his lips gently to Percy's. Percy made haste in kissing him back and pulling Draco closer.
When he looked down, however, the Red Champion Percy had given him lay in his hand.
Draco sighed, "Harry, plenty of people feel this, and they live on, with multiple people in their lives who they love and can see all the time, who their spouses know, and they get on." Draco pulled Harry in. "That's why I wish you'd told me, so I could help you understand all your feelings or find someone who did."
Draco shrugged and wrote something down, his legs still crossed neatly. "You just seem fidgety and distracted is all." Draco listed something, then flipped to a new page.
"Alright, Mr Malfoy, would you care to join me for lunch?" Draco smiled and looked at his watch.
Harry realized the pictures were still pushed faced down, Harry wondered if Draco had done that just for today's visit, to keep him from talking of personal things.
When the pot screeched its completeness Harry took it off the heat and poured the hot liquid into the mug. Pulling a teaspoon from his drawer he slowly stirs in his sugar.
He had brown Oxfords on and his hair was again, left in loose waves.
"I realized you missed your appointment." He also had boots on, warm fluffy boots, and his soft grey scarf was dangling from his neck haphazardly. His hair was slightly longer, giving him a more shabby look, his satchel also adorned his body, though he clutched it close. He liked Draco like this, Harry's mind supplied, more than he liked when he got really dressed up.
"No, Draco, hearing your screams on repeat forever and ever is worse, I can assure you. I have Hermione's screams, and Rons, and Cedrics and, and Luna and everyone, please, just tell me."
I would like to warn people of mentions of past rape in this chapter, I have changed the tags!
"Harry?" Ackley said, shock mingling with his tone. He was clad in his pyjamas and had glasses sitting on his nose.
(See the end of the chapter for
A gentle breeze blew around them, shaking the nearby tress and blowing Dracos coat tails up and into the wind. They only stopped kissing when they were both out of breath, and Draco immediately pulled away.
"Harry?" Harry shook his head, casting the memory of merely a few evenings ago from his mind.
Draco looked up into the sky and took a deep breath. Shaking his head, he closed his eyes. "I guess I had finally had enough. Neither one of us was living a life we wanted."
He sat them on the coffee table. "I'm going to go-" Draco rubbed a hand over his face and looked back to Harry, "Clean something." Then he was gone. Billion was back on Harry as soon as Draco's footsteps had faded.
Late into the night, after a long and hard conversation where Severus,
Green eyes shot open, blue skies were replaced with the smooth ivory ceiling of their dorm room. The covers were heavier than normal on his, which made sense when he felt a snoot nudging at his jaw from under the duvet. Hadrian let a hand reach up to massage Suni’s head, eyes still locked onto the seeing. Mind running and not really comprehending that real life existed for a moment.
Hadrian gave a sunny smile, sipping his coffee. “Sounds like a plan. Thank you.”
Albus was quick to try and do some damage control. “Now, we weren’t insinuating anything like that-“ Erin glared at him and Sara grinned.
“Boo-hoo.” A ghost of a smile fluttered on his lips when she tugged his ponytail with a swift tug in irritation at his bland attention. It was at least his full attention.
Draco soon shambled down the stairs. His parents following quickly behind him. The blonde looked relieved to plop himself down next to his paramour, stealing sips from the younger man’s mug. Hadrian didn’t bother chiding him, smiling indulgently. Lucius gratefully poured him and his wife some coffee and sat down at the table. Hadrian peeked around.
-Gives James time to ruin my family before he’s caught
Lily blinked but nodded, “Yes, we got him a snowy owl for his birthday this year. He named her Hedwig. Are snakes allowed?”
“Good, you’re so kind m’dear. And you?” Hadrian grinned.
Hell, if Hadrian hadn’t met Draco, he might have been ‘Potter’ full time. Slipping into whatever twisted role and mind-melding was forced on him. He’d never known his birth parents, maybe never even known his mate.
“Draco’s got Suni and Marissa! Let’s go!”
“Long day.” Smiling, Hadrian didn’t look up from where he was braiding his hair for bed. It was already near three in the morning and they were all exhausted. Nagini was slumped, sleeping blissfully on the charmed heated blanket she’d insisted having on one of their nightstands after she realized Hadrian was her ‘hatchling’. It seemed she felt as if she’d failed him and Tom, now determined not to fail once more. Draco stood behind him, they’re eyes meeting in the mirror, he didn’t even blink at the blonde’s nervousness. He knew his nerves were shot, but the… abuse he’d survived allowed him to outwardly brush most things off for later.
“She’s very high up in an international bioterrorism unit. Very influential and very powerful, she’s learned to have a firm hand and an even firmer scowl.” Sara shifted and brown curls tickled under his chin. “Thank you, for watching over my children. And tolerating me snotting all over your robes.”
“The bath?”
All of them were going to burn and he would watch and
“The Greater Good, you mean what suits you and your agenda rather than the law or the good of my traumatized godson. You will lose Albus, that court loss and this media circus is only for your loss. I hope losing everything reminds you what you’ve taken from me and the mothers you are so callously ignoring.” Severus finally relented, allowing Albus to scuttle towards the Great Hall. His glare following him the entire way until his frown melted into a smirk. Minerva should keep him busy enough. “Cockroach Clusters.”
Although he griped about wearing an uncomfortable glamour their lord was quickly swayed with the promise of a relaxing and
“What are you doing?!” Hadrian’s grin was manic on top of him and it was beginning to scare the ‘other’ Potter. “Aren’t you supposed to be grounded in your room?”
“Confringo!” His first tooth.
“Lily. Take Alex and go finish up lunch. We’ll be down in a minute.”
“Professor, do you know why we’re being called into the office?” Laney’s pout was at full force while still being respectful to their Head of House. Hadrian glanced back at Snape himself, the man stayed blank but did answer them in a bland voice.
“He’s doing great, Alex is annoying, but our classes are awesome! I’m getting tutored, but Hadrian’s curb stomping the rest of us in lessons.”
“Hadrian was really looking forward to Defense, but the teacher is a little dull.  I love potions! I’m not great at them though, it’s basically the same as chemistry! I was horrible at it, but it was still my favorite. Snape’s tutoring Greg, Victor, and I, but I think I just don’t have
Draco swallowed heavily, hands finding the brunet’s waist, careful about the snake still wound tightly around his lover’s body. He looked powerful and regal, his smile both made Draco’s heart race and his legs melt to useless jelly. Nagini hissed.
“Stupefy.”
“Your Metamorphagus traits will have stopped most physical changes, but you might notice a slight difference in your bone structure, eye color, and or skin tone. Maybe even hair color. This is to both clear any lasting compulsions, and possibly some of the memory charms and potions, and void out the blood adoption so that we can keep custody of you, should Wizarding Britain not recognize your foreign magical guardian. The last thing either of us want is you caught back into this war too. You had no place in it, you have no obligation to try and clean up the mess that Dumbledore caused.” Hadrian looked up at them, his parents.
Erin raised a single brow at her daughter and all whining stopped. “Yes Mother, Yes Mama.”
One was a monster, one was an ignorant coward, and one was a monster in progress.
“For you? His father? He should have been worth the world.” James glared and opened his mouth. But Sirius was tired of listening. “Avada Kedavra.”
“Hello Headmaster, it’s good to see you! What are they doing here? Did you call
Hadrian wasn’t there to ask for her.
A knock interrupted him from his thoughts. Hadrian’s head snapped to the door. His hands immediately reaching up to worry at his tie. The door knocked again and his throat constricted, instinctively Hadrian dropped down and crawled under the band. One hand clutching at his wand, the other grabbing one of the bed posts.
“Hadrian will kill you if you spew that violence in front of his baby. Both of them.”
Laney cursed, “Damn it, I wasn’t done plotting. Oh well, we only have double potions then we can do and hide out in the common room can’t we? Or grab Suni and use her to ward off any of the Gryffindor.”
Laney withdrew her hands revealing a tiny calico kitten blinking cutely around the room. Hadrian frowned at his familiar as Suni gave the tiny creature a speculative eye. Draco snapped back to himself. He was eleven, he would not be jumping the bones of a boy he just met.
“He skipped dinner, he won’t be skipping breakfast.” Well, actually Tippy had served him dinner. He’d simply avoided dining with his kidnappers. “I’m going in.”
But safe.
Scrambling, The raven grabbed the concrete walkway with both of his hands and dragged himself forward and squirmed until he was in the ward lines. He felt bad for bleeding all over the Malfoy’s nice walkway and leaving what were probably startling drag marks. But he was finally safe from any of the Potter nut heads. Though, he probably had some time before James or Albus came calling to the Malfoys either way.
Quickly he fixed a coffee for him and his beloved (his fiancé his mind grinned) before settling down at the table and grabbing a French curler as Draco stumbled down the stairs, Nagini nipped at his heels.
Hadrian’s went up the stairs with Draco hot on his heels, meeting the blonde’s parents and Uncles(?) had been nice. Even if it was a little tense and worried. He was glad that he finally got to meet them, seeing as Draco had already met his mentor a few times now. Hadrian grabbed his lover and shoved him into one of the guestrooms, Draco gaped at the fully clean and furnished room.
Even his father looked up with surprise before a pleased smile stretched across his face. His Lord and his Uncle stayed quiet as Lucius leaned over to shake Hadrian’s hand. Who looked absolutely delighted at the gesture. Shaking the older’s hand happily.
The long-haired brunet was smiling up at him with those sweet green eyes that would flash the most brilliant gold as he tumbled deeper into his thoughts. But, he didn’t grab for Draco’s full attention, he only relaxed under the blonde’s arm, smiling into the other’s chest and relaxing.
Oh f-
One bed. Which is what he was laying on. With a dresser and a desk it looked like. The window was shut and lined with burgundy drapes (they only had blinds at home, and there was no water. Definitely not the dorms). The whole room was ivory with dark wood, gold accents, and warm red fabrics.
TW: Divorce
"Did you have any luck with your feelings?" Draco chose his words carefully Harry noted while pulling a slightly larger slip from his pocket.
So far.
"Well, they choose to half it. Two weeks they're with me, the other two with Ginny, though usually, we don't do them right in a row, it's usually rotating." Harry grabbed his glass of forgotten liquor and offered some to Draco, he turned it down and instead settled with a sip from his tea.
"The body." Harry said right away, "Then I would be able to work as an Auror until I die." Ackley snorted and rolled his eyes.
"-so as you see, I hate creme!" Draco smiled and nodded, a slight chuckle leaving his lips. Percy smiled and sat back. "What's on your mind?" Percy asked.
Then she handed him the next picture. "That's you with all the Weasleys." She pointed to each and named them off. Harry smiled, making Hermione laugh.
"It was a long time ago, nothing anyone could have done about it." Draco smiled and kissed Harry lightly on the lips. "Might as well start getting ready."
ANOTHER?!?! IN ONE NIGHT!?!? Yes! Yes! Two! And more to come!
"You really like your job," He paused, "I would have to go with the mind," He paused again, "I think that is my winning quality," Harry smirked and turned back to stir the pot sitting on the stove.
Harry undid Draco's button-down and kissed down his chest and stomach. Soon his hands were undoing Draco's belt and trousers. Draco's hands worked on Harry's own, and soon they were both undressed, picking Draco up; he slowly slid into the blonde, knowing the pain it was going to cause. Draco bit down on Harry's shoulder as he moved them from the bathroom back into the bedroom.
Harry gently walked them back against the wall, placing Draco's body against it. He then pushed himself onto the man and kissed down his neck.
"I think mine would be my financial advisor." Harry laughed.
"Yes, you're right, I do know him." Draco smiled and nodded.
"What's your favourite food?" Percy asked as they walked down the giant front steps. Draco pondered this for a while. He had never really thought of it. Harry was usually the cook, so he would just eat whatever Harry made.
The boy, Scorpious, bid his farewell and then left, Harry closed the door after him.
"You're a perfectly fine human being who got caught up in the lust for a boy, it's fine, you're fine, everything is fine." Draco opened the pad.
Harry handed Draco the mug which he wrapped his hands tightly around, almost like a lifeline. He was wearing a slouchy blue jumper and dark grey trousers. His coat was a kakie colour and his grey scarf had been replaced by, what Harry guessed, was a hand-knit Slytherin scarf.
Draco wasn't responding, but he wasn't pulling away either, so Harry pushed on. Finally, Draco responded and pushed against Harry's lips with his own.

"You scared me!" Harry smiled.
"Is something the matter?" Harry shook his head and blundered over to Draco.
In the next picture, Ron, Hermione, Draco, and he were all standing in a kitchen with dinner on a stove and glasses of wine; Hermione looks very pregnant and doesn't have a drink. They all seemed relaxed.
Harry shrugged, "Then they'll come with me for the times she's gone." Draco smiled and wrote something down. "The next time I come, could you not smile?"
^*^*^*^*^*^*^
"That could be because I am." Harry watched Draco's left-hand trail notes and then, watched his wedding band hit the light. "You're dressed up today."
"You're about ten years too late." Harry stood then and grabbed the blonde's hips, pulling him close. He then hovered above his lips over the other mans. They stood like this for a minute before Draco finally surged forward and placed his lips on Harrys.
"I'm sorry for waking you, but, this is important." Ackley moved aside and Harry entered the house. A dwindling fire sat in his fireplace, logs sat stacked beside the brick structure. A few armchairs were spread about the room, and different dried plants hung from the ceiling.
"The war happened, you died and lived, and after we ran into each other, I guess we sparked then. Of course, Ron and Hermione married right after school, knowing their love for each, we dated for two years, then we got married as well."
"Remember, next time, it's your comfort food." Draco nodded, sitting down in his chair. "I look forward to it." Draco smiled widely and watched the man leave. A dull ache began to settle in his heart at the thought of having to wait until next week to see the man.
Draco offered him a small smile and began speaking, "Well this is definitely an approvement since the last time we spoke." Draco looked down and began writing things quickly.
"Yes, well, it feels as if I'm always grading papers." Harry smiled and placed a lingering kiss on Draco's cheek.
Once Hermione was done talking he rushed in the direction he had gone. Opening the large doors he found Draco making his way back inside.
"No, I have a dry mouth, is all." He pulled a glass from the cabinet and turned on the sink, filling it up. He took a seat next to Draco, slowly taking sips of his water.
Draco looked up, a slight expression of shock on his face. Then he composed himself and shook his head. "I actually have plans, sorry." Harry dismissed him.
Harry continued following him, admiring all of the flowers and plants. Once they were sitting in the shade, Harry allowed Draco to read quietly for a few moments before talking again.
"This is a great improvement Harry!" Draco remarked cheerfully. Harry smiled at the blonde and considered his praise.
"I was just thinking about how you've changed, is all." Percy smiled and nodded, sitting his tea glass down, he pondered openly for a moment.
Harry looked up and smiled, "I can remember this day, Ron didn't want to go in with you, but we forced him." Hermione's face lit up like Christmas.
"20 minutes should be fine." Draco smiled and slowly retrieved his raincoat, slipping it over his arms; Percy held the door as they left Draco's small classroom.
"What are you telling yourself then?" Harry asked, sitting back in the chair. Draco huffed and sat down his notepad, flaring out his evening jacket as he sat.
