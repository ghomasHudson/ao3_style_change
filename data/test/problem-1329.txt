“I was actually going to tell you that maybe you have a point about Teddy learning to sleep on his own.”
The class scrambled to their seats, hurriedly doing as requested as Professor Sprout took off on a run-through of what they were taught as first years. Draco however, held the paper open under the table he, Harry, Hermione, and Weasley had claimed.
“You hardly know him. You think a few hours here and there are enough for you to properly care for a living, breathing child day in and day out? It’ll be a miracle he doesn’t starve.”
Before long, the dungeon was filled with the sounds of potions brewing alongside the soft, repetitive thuds of slicing the enormous roots that the recipe called for. Harry had to hold it tight so that he could properly chop it into the thin slices needed without losing any fingers. When he finished, he pushed the pile over to Malfoy's side of the desk so that he could add them to the cauldron, but as Harry started to grind down some lavender, Harry realized that Malfoy hadn't moved to even look at the roots.
"Of course!" She sounded annoyed. "After those awful things Ron said to him...I can only imagine what kind of regrets Malfoy's having these days, and with what we know other students have been doing to him in between lessons and who knows what else...I didn't know how close to the truth Ron's words might have been for him."
Harry hardly has room to navigate to the kitchen area with Teddy and his bag. Toys, clothes, and random clutter covers the scuffed wood floors that are exposed around the crowding furniture. Harry’s foot clips the edge of a chair as he nears the counter, knocking Teddy’s booster onto the floor with a loud clatter.
‘Home’ is not designed for two people, however small one of those people might be. When Harry moved to London, he and Ron initially roomed together, but once Hermione graduated, Harry searched for his own place with mostly cost and location on his mind. With the demanding nature of the Auror program, he really only needed the flat as a place to sleep, shower, and eat. So he found a quiet wizarding complex that offered cheap rates and leased the first available unit, which happened to be an extraordinarily tiny one-bedroom on the fourth floor.
"Alright, the marks are in!" Slughorn called. "I'll call out those with the higher scores now, and you can lined up to the right on my desk. Those left over, you'll be on the left."
every fucking week while trying to maintain a level of stability to keep hold of the only thing I have left being taken away from me is causing me a fine bit of
Draco's heart was hammering in his chest, but he was breathing easy and felt no fear. Only raw victory and happiness clawed at his chest and he returned Harry's smile.
Harry groans. The last thing he needs is to deal with an unexpected guest before putting on a show of maturity for the Care-Seekers. Too, it’s going to take time away from his few minutes to relax. Sometimes it really feels as though he can never really win.
There was an uncomfortable pause as Harry tried to push aside the images stirring in his mind at the memory. Malfoy looked as though he had swallowed something foul.
Instead, he sneers, “You look dead on your feet. Your place is a mess. You’re obviously struggling. How’s all that Chosen One bravado working for you in parenthood?”
"Well, obviously we had to make sure that the building was fixed up, seeing a how the inmate will have their faculties about them without the dementors around." Mr. Weasley shuttered slightly. "Too, the Auror Department had to do an entire training and shift more than half their staff to maintain the place. I think a long-term solution is in the works now for an entirely new sub-department, but that's easily a year or more away from being absolute. They're worried for the safety of the prisoners in the meantime, though."
Harry felt his face flush. "No, no, no, it's not that! I know how they're made, I just...all I meant by that was how could gay couples use this potion? You said the donors have to add reproductive DNA, right? Which, by normal means, wouldn't make a baby."
Draco makes his way up the stairs, quickly finds himself on the fourth level and staring at Potter’s front door. Without allowing himself the chance to think better on it, Draco raps at the door, loud and insistent. A few moments pass without a response. Draco knocks again.
Draco sat next to Harry on the couch facing the two armchairs holding the Black women. Harry was determinedly friendly despite neither he nor Draco revealing just how close they were, wanting it to be apparent to both Andromeda and Narcissa that things were moving past old prejudices. He couldn't imagine that Draco had been entirely open with his mother about the extent of their relationship, but Harry knew that this was a good time to plant the seeds of trust in Narcissa.
"So today, as an opener, I'd like you all to concoct as best a sample of a simple Bliss Potion. Make sure you are brewing the Bliss Potion rather than the Biiss Potion, a rather nastily effective exfoliator." Slughorn chuckled. "We'll be testing your potions next week, and I shudder to think of what would happen to one who drinks an Exfoliating Potion."
"Uh..." Draco thought about facing the Great Hall, the angry stares, the furious whispers. Harry, sitting on the opposite side of the room, his back likely to him. "No, I don't think I will."
Pulling his eyes away from the baby, Draco turned to face his aunt and tried to smile. Her voice didn't completely match her words, but Draco could only assume that as early as a few months ago, Andromeda hadn't cared or even known that he existed. He extended his hand.
Draco lifted Teddy up off of him and tried to hug him, but Teddy only pushed away as his cries grew marginally louder. Desperate not to be found with a screaming child after being left alone with it, Draco flopped onto his back, tossing Teddy into the air above him and catching him only when he was within a few inches of crashing into Draco's face.
Draco tried to keep the foolish smile off his face as he entered the Great Hall. But upon entering, he felt it melt away on its own as dozens of heads whipped around to stare. Furious whispering broke out as Draco made his way to the Slytherin table. Nothing necessarily new, but there was a certain feeling of escalation in the glares and whispers. The renewed anger there was remarkably off-putting.
Although Draco’s ears feel hot and he can see Harry’s cheeks flush slightly, it’s all met with Mr. Cook bursting into laughter.
“Coming!” Harry calls, struggling to his feet on jelly legs with Teddy like a boulder in his arms. He hurries to the door, giving Teddy a little shake. “Teddy? Teddy, wake up. The Care-Seekers are here.”
Scowling with the same intensity that Harry remembers from Hogwarts, Draco’s ears flare pink as he goes through the motions of saying goodbye to Teddy.
He had spent all of Friday night and the entirety of Saturday at Malfoy's side in the hospital wing, watching anxiously as the bruising gradually faded from his face. Madam Pomfrey had been uncharacteristically patient with Harry's vigil, but when she had found Harry slumped over in his chair as the sun set Saturday evening, she had kicked him from the wing and insisted that he catch some sleep in his own dormitory.
"Okay, you're not going to be a bother, especially if you tell her why you need them." Harry glared at Malfoy's profile, sighing when the other didn't respond. "One of these days, I'm going to get it through that thick skull of yours that you
“You can cry all you want; as soon as you’re done, you’re going to say sorry to Fleur. Hopefully she’ll still sit with you during the wedding.”
“Oh, no worries,” Mr. Cook says as he stands and moves toward the armchair. “Most children his age are shy of strangers. It’s a good thing.” Sitting, he gestures to the couch while setting up a rather expensive-looking Quick-Notes Quill. “Please, gentlemen.”
"Ohh f-fuck," Harry moaned softly. Finally giving up on whatever his hands had been trying to do, he rested his hands on Draco's head, gently wrapping them in the hair there.
"Here is the potion I would like you all to start today. This one you will all attempt to make. Next lesson, however, each pair will be assigned something different to tend to in addition to this one. In the upcoming weeks, I will be leaving a key hidden in the doorframe to the classroom so that you may enter as needed to properly tend to your potions. Now, begin!"
“Teddy, you are going to eat this,” he says through clenched teeth. “Whether it’s tonight, breakfast tomorrow, lunch, dinner, I don’t care. You’re going to eat this.”
“Malfoy, you can’t feed Teddy a bunch of vegetarian nonsense just because that’s what you want,” Harry says, exasperated. “Kids need protein, iron, that sort of crap.”
Ron hums, following Harry as they make their way back into the bland conference room where most of their instruction on departmental policy takes place. Necessary though it is, it never ceases to be endlessly boring. Yet when their instructor, a thinning old wizard named Lawrence Planters, shuffles in, his words have every trainee sitting up marginally straighter.
But Draco couldn't listen to Harry begging him to stop, begging him to stay. Draco couldn't listen to Harry's voice as he grabbed his things from the table and finally listened to his body, listened to the panic. Pushing his way past Harry's outstretched arm and Weasley standing in the doorway, Draco bolted.
"I thought I heard you stirring," she said as she drew closer. She produced her wand and ran the tip gently over Draco's head, inspecting him. "You were incredibly lucky, Mr. Malfoy, incredibly lucky. Mr. Gregory either hasn't yet mastered that particular spell or his heart wasn't in it, but either way, the spell wasn't as strong as it ought to have been. Even the Minor Explosion Spell should have shattered your skull and sliced apart your brain, but it seems to have only caused you an incredibly severe concussion."
The letter didn't do Draco's torrent of emotion any justice, but he didn't want to waste anymore time than he already had by not reaching out to her the moment he had seen the article more than a week previous. Rolling the parchment as he ran, Draco hurried to the Owlery.
He ran his fingers through his hair, pulling at the strands until they stung his scalp. For the millionth time since stepping foot onto the grounds, Draco thought about what a foolish hope returning to Hogwarts had been. There was no way for things to actually get better, no matter what the Lovegood girl kept telling him.
Draco stepped into the nearest bathroom to clean himself up a bit. There wasn't as much blood as he had assumed, much to his relief, and though his nose didn't appear to be visibly broken, Draco was likely to have a wicked bruise on the bridge the following day. He splashed some water on his face and wiped the blood from his skin. His hands shook.
There’s warmth under his skin now. It’s a bit of a sore spot for Harry, his ongoing lack of a love life. Though things aren’t strained by any means, he and Ginny didn’t rekindle as they had both hoped after the war, and Harry hasn’t been terribly successful in dating since. Not that he’s exactly tried, but still.
Hermione nodded. "It is, as well as risky. If the surrogate isn't 100% willing, the potion can curdle in her body and cause serious infections if not caught in time. Otherwise, though, it's just as simple as a normal pregnancy and birth."
Regardless, the reception is easily more enjoyable. The men are able to undo the topmost clasps of their dress robes for easier breathing, and there’s food and drink to accompany the mingling that surrounds a frenzied dance floor. Although Teddy behaved well during the ceremony, Harry can tell that Fleur is ready for a break and relieves her. It has him spending most of the reception working to keep Teddy entertained and out from underfoot, keeping him close as Harry catches up with a few friends from Hogwarts and various Weasley relatives, including a second cousin of Ron’s that is frighteningly forward. She seems nice enough, but her hands are bold, roaming Harry’s chest the entire time they talk. It’s only when Teddy accidentally sets her shoes alight that Harry has an excuse to be rid of her.
"Better wipe that smug look off your face, Malfoy," one of the Slytherins hissed at him. "People will think you've gone back to your old ways and you'll just make us all look even worse than you already do."
"Come on, Harry, let's go!" Ron called as he walked past, his and Hermione's own vial in hand. "Malfoy leave you with the clean up?"
At first, Harry was incredibly stiff as he laid there, unsure of what to do with his limbs as he shared a bed with Malfoy. But when Malfoy rolled over and threw his arm across Harry's chest, snuggling into his side, Harry felt his body automatically relax. His mind was reeling at the sensation of Malfoy breathing on his exposed neck, legs tangling themselves with his own, hand lazily grabbing at his shirt.
"Alright, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy. Today I'd like you two to concoct a De-Aging Solution. You can find the ingredients in your textbook under Pellis Novis. Now hop to!"
Harry lifted up and threw his leg over Draco, climbing on top of him. Draco was absorbed in their lips and was taken completely by surprise when Harry carefully lowered his hips to Draco's and their bodies pressed together. Pleasure erupted in Draco's groin as Harry's own erection slid against Draco's through their bed clothes. A moan escaped him, mingling with Harry's own as they kissed. Instinctively, Draco thrust his hips up, seeking that friction.
Sighing somewhat, Draco forces himself to relax. Teddy is a relatively safe subject. “He’s doing well. Speaking more clearly and starting to use the first person more often. He’s growing up.”
"Take...off...these...blasted...boxers," Draco moaned between kisses. His hands reached down and began to tug at the fabric still keeping them apart, and Harry released his grip on Draco's cock to help.
“Ha-wee!” Teddy is already on Harry’s leg, squeezing tight to try and pull himself into a real embrace. Harry obliges, sniffing carefully to try and place the aroma around them. “Ha’ee birday!”
Harry wasn't sure who was more shocked - Draco or himself. He had let himself into Andromeda's house as she had requested in her letter from the day before, but nothing could have prepared him for walking in on his enemy-turned-boyfriend playing on the floor with his godson.
Walking as quickly as he can without looking too eager to bolt, Draco flees the building, ignoring Gemma’s sweet farewell as though it’s his job. The air always tastes fresh in his lungs after stepping through the magical barrier, and today Draco takes several deep, nearly gulping breaths before Disapparating home.
It had to be the kindest offer Draco had ever been given, especially given the seriousness of Harry's tone. No doubt lingered in those green eyes. Harry was truly prepared to do whatever it took to keep Draco from being uncomfortable. Draco took a deep breath, wanting nothing more than to lunge forward and make a rash decision, and nodded.
"What the-" Harry cut himself off, rubbing his eyes in frustration. "You can't be serious. Regularly? How are you not dead?"
"It's an invisibility cloak," Potter answered with a grin. "It was my dad's. You can wear this and walk beside me, and I'll lead you out. Fool proof."
"Harry, dear!" Andromeda cried, flinging open the kitchen door and sweeping into the room. She stooped over and wrapped Harry and Teddy into a tight hug, kissing each of Harry's cheeks. "You're a bit early! Wasn't expecting you for another hour, at least!"
“And now that Potter and I are...ah...'playing nice’ around him, I think Teddy’s exposure to negativity is all but extinguished. I can’t say for Potter when he’s over there, but I make sure not to let Teddy notice my personal stresses such as the finances or whatever.”
Pleasure flushed throughout Draco at that, and when Harry leaned down to kiss him again, Draco threw his arms around Harry's shoulders, pulling him against his chest. Draco deepened the kiss, pushing his face upward and seeming to catch Harry off guard. But he quickly adapted, placing one hand on the bed next to Draco's head, the other gripping at the base of his skull, fingers tangled in his hair. When Harry tentatively swiped his tongue across Draco's lips, Draco gasped softly, allowing Harry entrance.
Morning light tickled at the edge of Draco's consciousness, poking its way into his closed eyes and causing him to stir. He groaned inwardly at the slumber in his body that tried to fight his waking, finally cracking open an eye. Red surrounded him, a harsh change from the usual bottle green that met him in the mornings, and a mop of wild black hair sat at his shoulder, its owner breathing into his neck.
With a final slide down the length of Harry's cock, Draco pulled back with a quiet pop and looked up at Harry from his knees. That sight alone could do Harry in, and he was sure Draco and his sly smirk knew it.
Harry shove Ron good naturedly and moved to sit down as he walked away. He ought to read some of the catalysts, whatever those were.
When there’s no reply, Harry waves his wand to finish the dishes and makes his way back to the bedroom. Teddy isn’t there.
"But there's no possible way anyone could think she's done anything Dark!" Hermione said, sounding exasperated. "Not anyone who isn't some dim-witted gossip stirrer anyway."
"You're just trying to save me," Draco croaked after some time. "Aren't you? Just some pathetic former Death Eater queer that can't even stop himself from being blown up by a couple of kids. The perfect project."
Malfoy reaches over, runs a hand up and down Teddy’s back. “Everything’s alright, little one. No one’s angry with you.”
Not that time really mattered anymore. Ever since he and his mother had been acquitted by the Ministry for their parts in the war, Draco had taken to simply existing inside the manor, barely eating, scarcely sleeping, and never once stepping outside. It was a lonely and aching existence, but at least no one was hurt by inactions this time.
"I'd like to," he said. "I really would. But...I just can't stop reliving my worst memories. It's hardly even up to me."
The Great Hall was nearly exactly as he remembered it, though through the ceiling's enchantments, he could make out deep cracks in the stone that hadn't been entirely mended. Other than the sheer mass of students being larger than previous years, Harry felt almost as though he had taken a huge step back in time.
"Well, it's Karen," she said with a smile. It fell slightly, though, as she asked, "How come you haven't spoken to me since that first night? I've wave to you in the halls and I try to talk to you in the common room when you're actually there..."
Harry's stomach churned at the thought of Ginny. It had been weeks since they last spoke, but the memory of that last conversation still played uncomfortably in his mind when his memories clouded him too much to sleep at night.
"Yeah, but I was never asked to write any new laws." Harry shook his head, smiling. "You're really something, Hermione."
“No, but tucking him in with a few kind words and leaving him to fall asleep on his own teaches him independence. You’re coddling him.”
these allegations had anything to them that law enforcement would obviously want to check it out, but the author never said that these things were actually happening."
Potter cleared his throat. "They've gone now, but it used to happen a lot. Hermione noticed and said they're called panic attacks. She'd have to explain what they are exactly, but she...she gave me some tips to help...move them along." He swallowed. "I...er...did it help?"
It had been a rather beautiful wedding, even if all Harry had to go by was Bill and Fleur's wedding three years previous. They hadn't worried about a tent this time, Hermione wanting to be able to watch the sun set as she and Ron exchanged vows, so the ceremony easily transitioned into the outdoor party that was the current reception. Thanks to Charlie and George, and likely Mr. Weasley, who greatly approved of Hermione, the party was rather well stocked with alcohol. It made for a spectacularly loud and rambunctious occasion.
Harry looked down at the vials. Prohibis Spiritum, Baneberry, and Blood-duct. "Alright, easy enough, right?"
"Where've you-" Weasley began, but he stopped short when he caught Draco's eye. It would have been humorous, Weasley looking as though he had been struck over the head with a club, had Draco not been so worried about how badly the redhead would react. A tense silence blanketed the table.
“Because if you wet the couch, it’ll be harder to clean than your bed, that’s all,” Harry says gently. “You’re not in trouble.”
The tension in the room increased as Professor McGonagall spoke, and Draco kept his eyes trained on the table, careful not to look around the room. All eyes would be drifting to the Slytherin table.
Something in Harry's eyes must have deterred whatever question Ron had been about to ask, for he simply shrugged and said, "Alright. See you, then."
“What happened?” Harry asks as he grabs Teddy by the middle, hoisting him up. Teddy continues to fight wildly, enough so that Harry worries he might drop him.
That wasn't the reply Draco had been expecting. Those green eyes were set, completely void of any teasing or doubt. Draco blinked a few times, eyes feeling misty suddenly. It was late. He was tired. He didn't need to be having this conversation with this person at this hour.
"For today, I thought an easy lesson would do. Something to start the new era off with a bang without hurting our heads too much, how does that sound, hm?"
Draco hadn't lifted his eyes from the table during the Sorting Ceremony. His left eye wanted to water, but no tears came. He figured that even his physical body knew that he deserved the black eye that was now forming. It wasn't as though the ambush on the train had been much of a surprise. The train had been particularly full, seeing as there was essentially an extra year's worth of students attending that year, leaving Draco with little choice but to find a compartment that already had people in it. He at least had chosen one filled with Slytherins. Pansy had been among them, and though Draco grimaced with embarrassment at the memory of their last time seeing one another, he had slithered into the seat beside her. Thankfully, she had said nothing to him, and Draco had harbored the hope that he could go the entire train ride ignored.
Harry inched away, hoping her hand would just slip off of him if he did it carefully enough. "Just...I'm not hungry yet."
"I'm sure you don't sometimes," she said mildly. "But I hope you're not worried about being entertaining on my account. We needn't even talk if you'd prefer. I'd just like some company, Harry's request or not."
Before long, Harry was climbing the steps of the Astronomy Tower. He hadn't returned there since he had seen Malfoy there before, but tonight felt like a good night to go back.
A note fell from his cloak when he made to fold it. It was a torn scrap of parchment, no larger than his palm, and Draco recognized the untidy scrawl there.
A small girl beside him, a true first year no older than eleven by the looks of her, sniffled. Despite having died inside long ago, Draco's heart ached at the sound. He glanced over at her. Immensely tiny with a head of tight brown curls, the girl looked downright miserable. No matter what Professor McGonagall could say, all the younger students knew that Slytherin was the bad House, the House that produced more evil witches and wizards than any other, the House that the Dark Lord himself was sorted into while at Hogwarts, the House that didn't stay to defend the castle, the House that was now being eyed with suspicion.
"No he isn't, Harry." Granger's voice was as dreamy as Draco felt, and she returned his vague smile as she and Weasley drew nearer, bags over their shoulders.
“Of course not. But we had to start somewhere, and it worked. Maybe this week or next you could work on weaning him off the treats.”
“Well,” he says slowly, grudgingly, “it’s undeniable that he gives Teddy all the affection and support the boy craves. I...I suppose that is...more important than the fact that it’s coming from some arrogant toerag with no brains.” He pauses then as something crosses his mind. “Although growing up with a famous and influential wizard for a guardian can’t be a bad thing for Teddy.”
Between accidentally Apparating to the manor’s old plot almost daily, keeping up with his work at the Apothecary, and worrying about Teddy, Draco finds himself rapidly becoming an insomniac. The days following his brief meeting with Ms. Dribble have been excruciatingly endless. Time drags on and on in ways he never believed possible. How long is he expected to wait for Potter to miraculously grow a brain?
A deep sigh to his right putted Harry from his musings, and he turned to find Ron and Hermione smiling at one another, staring longingly into each other's eyes. It wasn't inappropriate by any means, but with most of the House already gone to bed, Harry definitely felt as though he were intruding.
And so, wrapped up tight in his scarf, cloak, hat, and mittens, Harry made his way through the brewing blizzard with Ron, Hermione, Neville, and several other old friends. The walk was brutal, nobody saying a word as they turned their faces down against the unrelenting wind. Harry kept glancing among the students trying to spot Malfoy but to no avail.
Though his voice is gentle, Mr. Cook’s question seems to spark hot electricity through Teddy, who jerks, shoving himself deeper into Harry’s chest, knocking most of the air out of his lungs. A grunt slips from them both, and Mr. Cook’s smile falters.
“Yeah, I-” Harry swallows past a dry mouth. “Yeah, Andromeda and Teddy moved in with the Malfoys after Lucius died. But did-”
Malfoy nods. “I can stand to agree with that. Then...well, then you can just sleep on the couch. It’s quite luxurious, I think you’ll find it comfortable enough. Besides, how much room does an Auror-in-training need? You’ll basically only need enough room to sleep, eat, and bathe however often you do.”
Teddy leaned in, stretching his neck, and tried to blow a raspberry in Draco's face. Mostly, though, he just blew baby drool all over the place. Draco's eyes shut instinctively as he pulled his head back. Teddy giggled.
Malfoy didn't react outside of pausing in his note-taking, and Harry tried to blindly take it as a good sign.
The old witch tuts, shaking her head slightly. “There is nothing that prohibits you from seeing Teddy as far as the laws go, no. But as Mr. Potter is now responsible for the boy, it is entirely up to him who has access to Teddy, myself and Jameson being the obvious exception.”
Harry reaches Teddy first, scooping him into a hug as Malfoy shuts the water off. Hugging Teddy tightly, Harry stands, shushing. “I’m sorry, Teddy.”
But he couldn't do that. Harry rubbed the heels of his hands into his eyes. In some sick way, he knew he owed it to the wizarding world that he had just saved to stay. To vanish now would be ungrateful to those who had stayed by his side all these years, supported him through thick and thin, loved him when he hadn't loved himself.
"They're Christmas cookies I baked for Andromeda." She showed him the wrapped parcel in her own arms. "And this is a gift for Teddy. It's not much, but I didn't think it proper to arrive empty-handed."
"I saw your wand drop," Potter continued, and Draco heard footfalls draw nearer. He didn't turn around, though. "I know you were scared. I know you didn't want what happened."
But there is no way Draco can attend. There is absolutely no way that he’s going to stride into the remembrance ceremony of a battle in which he very openly fought on the wrong side. It’s the epitome of a potential disaster. Everything he fears, hates, and actively represses, all rolled into one enormous, society-wide escapade that requires dress robes and a perfectly-molded somber face. Blood draining away into the shadowiest reaches of his soul, Draco’s hands shake as he unfolds the leaflet against his better judgement.
They stood there for a moment, Harry's fists pinning Malfoy against the stone wall, before Harry realized that Malfoy was shaking. He raised his eyes to meet Malfoy's, finding them closed tight as Malfoy bit his lip against some emotion that he was obviously fighting to keep down. Guilt replaced Harry's sudden anger quickly, and his fists unclenched but stayed wrapped in the fabric of Malfoy's cloak.
Fire Whiskey made the drinker honest, and Harry found himself mumbling, "I should just be expelled. I've caused enough trouble at Hogwarts to last a century, at least. I don't know why Dumbledore didn't do away with me in my first year. Wait," Harry rubbed at his eyes. "No, I know why. Needed me, didn't he?"
But with lessons over and the train due to take those returning home for the holidays to London the following morning, Harry felt less inclined to keep bundled as he pressed his bare chest against Draco's, fiercely kissing him against the bed below.
Luna cleared her throat, and Draco raised his eyes to meet hers. She wasn't smiling anymore, but Draco somehow felt that smiling just part of who she was, how she carried herself. He could
The complete constipation taking hold of Potter’s face as he grabs the paper is too much. Draco laughs.
Mrs. Weasley's eyes narrowed slightly. "Well, it'll be good to have a full education. I'm glad somebody could talk some sense into you."
“Uh...yes, I would say so.” When Chase doesn’t respond, Draco elaborates. “Now it’s not me supplementing what Andromeda and Mother are already doing, it’s...at least, when I have him, Teddy’s milestones feel like my own as well.”
“You know,” Ms. Dribble calls as she drifts from the bedroom to the bathroom, “chaos and unruliness is expected. The boy’s behavior is hardly a reflection of the new life you’re providing for him right now. So we expect honesty, Mr. Potter.”
And without so much as a glance back, Potter’s mop of disorganized black hair vanishes among the throngs pouring into the lifts.
Fred's old school trunk was much like Harry's own trunk had been. Dark, hard material, locks that were tattered after years of use, though several brightly colored sweets littered the bottom, much unlike Harry's had. Not sure if the sweets were innocent or unfinished prototypes of the joke shop, Harry reached into the depths of each corner, removing the bright candies and placing them atop the dusty nightstand.
Weasley slammed a fist on the table, shaking the mugs and drawing the rest of the pub's attention to their table. "Oh, quit being so high and mighty! If you weren't so stuck on being the poster boy of love and peace or whatever, you'd wish he'd just off himself, too!"
They move as quickly without haste, stripping Teddy and helping him into the warm water, moving fairly in sync to start washing him.
Draco locks the shop behind him, stepping onto the cobblestones of Diagon Alley. He makes his way through the district in the darkness punctured by the oil-lanterns that glow on metal stakes every several meters. Quaint as Diagon Alley is during the day, since his employment, Draco has taken a shine to the beauty the place reflects once the sun has disappeared.
But the voice seemed to understand. "You're in the hospital wing. I don't know if you remember, Madam Pomfrey said you might not, but...you were attacked. You're skull's all messed up from a badly performed spell."
It was Christmas morning. Draco had enjoyed a quiet coffee and muffin breakfast with his mother as the sun rose, but now they were preparing to go visit Andromeda and Teddy as it neared mid-morning. Draco figured that he ought to reply to Harry's letter and return the owl before they left.
"Okay, no one who matters," Harry amended. "No one in the pub, for sure. I wish you'd have stayed a bit longer. No one thought Ron was in line with...with what he said. So please...don't. Ever."
Harry stepped quietly around the corner that gave way to the Astronomy Tower steps. Professor Carraway, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, was on nighttime patrol that evening, and she apparently took her position far more seriously than the other teachers. She prowled without a lantern, keeping quiet as she crept around the school, making it hard to listen for her and avoid detection. Harry had seen her a corridor or two away and only just passed her without raising the alarm.
Malfoy stood still, hand cradled in Harry's, as the blood was removed. The shaking didn't stop as Harry dropped Malfoy's left hand and moved onto the right one to continue Vanishing the blood. When he had cleared it all away, Harry didn't let go and kept his eyes trained on their hands.
"You're not even listening to me, are you? You're being stupid. Just go back to being happy and eating and sleeping and not moping around all the time already."
Josh audibly gulped, and he looked to his friends for support, but they all looked at the floor instead. It was only then when Josh answered.
“Which is what I was meaning,” Chase says with a courteous nod. “You’ve been impressively good with your money almost from the start of your employment. I have many other clients that still struggle with how to manage their money. All that aside, you ought to ask Harry Potter for some help.”
"N-no!" Harry half-shouted, mortified. How had the conversation ended up here so quickly? "No, I'm not...I'm not having sex with Malfoy! Just because you and Ron-"
"But again, why would people choose that? Isn't...wouldn't making a baby the normal way just be way easier?"
Harry poured as much as he could into the kiss. He tried to tell Draco with his lips that he deserved every ounce of kindness he found, deserved every chance he was given, deserved
Draco tugged on Harry's hand, forcing the other to take a step closer. Draco leaned in to kiss Harry despite his words but the hand on his chest stopped him again.
"Why were you late, Harry?" Hermione asked as they found their way into a set of armchairs in the Gryffindor common room. "Didn't Ron wake you?"
Draco shrugged and stood beside the bed, careful not to bump the Frozen curtains as he began to dress. "Regardless, I'm hungry and desperately need a shower."
They fell to the bed finally, Harry quickly flipping them so that he could press himself fully against Draco, easily lining up their hips and grinding down. Draco bit at Harry's lip, their teeth clinking together with the force of their kiss as Harry grinded his hips against Draco's again, their erections straining at the contact.
“I guess. Give me a minute...” And with Teddy under his arm like a rolled up carpet, Harry slips into the nearby bedroom. He plops Teddy onto the bed and crouches in front of him. “Teddy, what in the world is going on with you? You never hit!”
“Oh, ‘arry, you worry too much,” she says, flipping her hair slightly. “Leetle Teddy was fine, as ‘e was all week. Now, ‘aven’t you an appointment zis afternoon?”
Oh, how very wrong she was, Draco thought. If anything, he owed it to the world to remain unhappy for the rest of his days.
After almost six weeks of of Teddy’s general inhabitance, the bedroom has transformed. On the walls now hang a multitude of toddler art; smeared paintings, scribbled drawing, attempts at cut-out shapes, and one memorable clay sculpture that sits atop a floating shelf. The bed is now adorned in basic sheets for Teddy’s naps, and the bookshelf is steadily filling, both with a fair amount of children’s books that Draco can't keep himself from buying and a couple baskets of assorted toys. There’s life in the room now, a life and space that’s all Teddy’s.
Ron grimaced. After Ron and Harry had decided to return to Hogwarts, Mrs. Weasley had been rather teary-eyed. With Bill and Fleur living away, Percy returning to his London flat (he had insisted that he couldn't break the lease just then, but he visited nearly every weekend), George back to living atop his shop in Diagon Alley, and Charlie due to return to Romania shortly after the Hogwarts Express left, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were facing a truly empty house for the first time since the war once Harry, Ron, and Ginny left. Seeing Mrs. Weasley wipe at her eyes every time he retrieved an item for his trunk from around the house had Harry reconsidering returning to Hogwarts on more than one occasion.
Draco had expected Potter to return the favor of seven years' worth of bullying with the whole of the wizarding world at his back. It would have been the most justified schoolyard vengeance likely in modern history. Instead, Draco was met with a Potter that asked if he was alright and took notes for him. Potter caring even remotely about Draco's black eye hurt almost as much as the actual punch had. He didn't deserve any shred of kindness, yet Potter of all people was there at his desk in two separate lessons, offering it. It was bewildering, even without the added breathing trouble and heavy heartbeat that seemed to accompany it.
A bit bewildered but pleased all the same, Harry twisted his finger, again hitting that spot deep inside Draco and eliciting another strangled cry of pleasure from his lover's lips. Draco's cock in Harry's hand twitched, and Harry decided to take things a step further.
“So...” Harry clears his throat, tries not to grin when Draco opens his eyes to glare at him. “Er, how did toilet training go?”
Not under these circumstances, but Draco was wanting to move out and on his own. He wanted his own flat, his own space, find his own new way in the revitalized world. But when his father was incarcerated, it felt harsh to leave his mother alone in the manor; and when his father was killed in Azkaban, the dream seemed to flatten into nonexistence in a blink. It wasn’t long after, however, that Draco’s mother and Andromeda rekindled what was left of their slaughtered relationship in shared grief, in deep-seeded hopes for making things right. Although Draco felt it was a touch forced, Andromeda and Teddy revived some of his selfish desire to finally venture out on his own. His mother would have company without ever having to leave the manor she loved so very much.
"What's going on?" Ron, who was following with Hermione and Neville, asked as they descended another staircase. "Why're we worried about Malfoy? He's a big boy, I bet you-"
"Not in the hospital wing. Before all this." Harry sighed and set down his fork, giving up on the eggs that sat like stones in his stomach. "I went for a walk after hours one night and found Malfoy in the Astronomy Tower. We talked. He thinks he deserves to be attacked regularly."
“I know what we’ll be doing is considered dangerous or whatever,” Ron mutters in Harry’s ear, “but I don’t fancy having to deal with
Teddy, the strange little Metamorphmagus that moved into Draco’s home, into his life, into his heart no more than a year previous. It’s Teddy that keeps Draco from falling into a grieving mess. Not that it’s his fault.
"What d'you mean, 'even if'?" Ron asked. "There's no way he's changed after all that Death Eater business."
"As much as everyone keeps trying to say that," Harry said firmly, his hands holding Draco's face. "I am not just trying to save you. I have better things to do than try to save someone I don't like or don't think deserves it."
sooOoOo, now that you've powered through some of what might've felt like filler, I hope the 'okay now're really actually starting to see each other differently' uphill is worth it. I still stand by thinking that how Harry and Draco interact with Teddy is crucial in how they end up developing from teenagers-with-issues-and-attitudes into more. So thanks to those who are sticking it out; sorry to those who are finding this droning
"No, I'm serious, Malfoy. You have got to get more sleep than that. Ask Madam Pomfrey for a Sleeping Draught or something."
Harry's hand found his, warm and comforting, but Draco ripped his hand away and quickly stood. It was just that sort of behavior that landed him in this position, landed his mother in danger, and he forced himself to look away from the hurt filling Harry's eyes.
Thankfully, Ron and Hermione had been prepared, it seemed, and they had booted each of these particular fans from the compartment without tact. Harry hadn't been able to properly articulate his gratitude, but he felt confident that they knew. When the train stopped and the trio had found a carriage, it had been an intoxicating relief to be among true friends.
Draco could fly with the ecstasy. Instead, he settles for arriving at the Ministry right at eleven o’clock, trying not to look too eager through his open contentedness.
“I know how much Teddy means to you,” she says. “And I feel awful about what I said about how another family might’ve been better suited to raise him. I...I don’t want to tell you what to do. I haven’t a clue as to what children really need; I’m so far from ready, and yet you are tackling the challenge head-on. Just like you always do.” She lets out a noise like the cross between a giggle and a scoff. “I believe you can do this all on your own, Harry, I truly do. I also know that you want what is in Teddy’s best interests. From everything you’ve told Ron and me...Malfoy is a part of that. Being closer to him can't be all that bad if Teddy's found so much worthwhile there, surely?”
"So they kept having you do it, over and over again, but when they eventually gave up on you, it was so much worse for her." Pure hate laced Josh's words, and Draco accepted every syllable of it. "They tortured her in front of us for nearly five minutes, never letting up. You remember her screams?"
"Don't be. They argued plenty before I decided to get too friendly with you." Harry grinned at him, but as their lesson drew to a close and their shrubs were collected, Draco felt increasingly guilty over the trouble he had caused by simply existing.
“Do stop worrying like some sort of old witch over it, will you? Teddy’s growing just fine. However,” Draco adds with a slight smirk, “if you’ve told him that he has to eat that food, you can’t toss it now.”
"Look," Harry said, and Draco forced himself to look into his eyes. "It's fine, really. We can stop, take it slow, whatever you want. Whatever you're comfortable with. I mean...I mean, this is still new territory for me, too. It wouldn't hurt us to slow down a bit."
Draco laughed at that. "I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure we actively hated each other for seven years."
The shiver Harry had been staving off finally took him, and he wished he had thought to grab his cloak. At least thus far, his seventh year at Hogwarts was more alive with personal drama than it was any actual danger. It was a nice change of pace, though Harry privately missed the straightforwardness of having a tangible enemy to confront. There wasn't anything he could do to ward off the unpleasant feeling of being a monster except to lie awake half the night wondering if there was something else he could have done.
Draco closed his eyes, not wanting to see the genuine worry in her eyes. Worry over his happiness. "It doesn't matter. I...I can't let myself be happy when it might be costing my mother her life and freedom."
“I see.” Ms. Dribble smiles then, though Harry feels it’s somehow a touch threatening. He attempts to return the gesture but mostly just purses his lips nervously. Not quite how he wants to give his farewell.
"Welcome, all, welcome," Professor McGonagall called, bringing the thundering Hall to silence in the span of a few seconds. She smiled down at them, a rather unusual look for the strict witch. "Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, though this is the first year in the school's history that so many students are actually being welcomed back.
With a shrug, Chase taps at his quill to make a manual note. “It would take a lot of strain off of you and, in turn, Teddy. It could also further a potential friendship with Harry Potter.”
Teddy is thrilled at having just a jam sandwich, usually a snack food, for dinner. And while Draco is calm as he eats, Harry just stares at the clock.
Though Harry had intentionally not given much thought to the fact that he had feelings for a man, it had crossed his mind at one point or another how he might feel about kissing one. Surely lips between men and women were different? But as pure pleasure exploded in his chest, pooling as a deep heat in his abdomen, at the feel of Draco's lips moving in time against his, slightly chapped but soft, Harry wasn't sure why he had ever thought kissing a man would be any different than when he had kissed Ginny or Cho.
The muscles in Draco's chest were far too tight. He couldn't move his chest enough to draw a full breath even if he hadn't already been struggling. Fear tickled at his consciousness, whispering in his ear that if he died right then and there, he'd be dying completely alone. No one would bat an eye at the sight. Many would probably cheer.
Admittedly, Draco hasn’t thought about Teddy’s lost parents as often as he maybe should. Lupin and his wife were hardly what would even be called acknowledged in his social circle before their deaths. Tonks was brought up as bait for Bellatrix and his mother, but otherwise, Teddy’s parents were simply names, a former teacher. Still, he knew the story of Teddy’s namesake; Andromeda was always quite proud, and it was the sole reason for her being singed from the family tree long before Draco was even born.
Harry had tried to talk to Draco despite Ron's message. But Draco must have known Harry would do just that and had done a spectacular job of avoiding Harry all week. But by Thursday, real panic and desperation had gripped Harry and he had managed to catch Draco in the corridor near the Slytherin common room, near the place where Draco had finally told Harry that he loved him.
"Now," Slughorn continued. "Today we're shifting away from all our work with poisons, antidotes, wards, and the like. We'll be taking a sharp turn in the other direction for the rest of the time that we have until Christmas and will be looking more closely at potions, draughts, and elixirs that alter the chemicals within us that dictate emotion."
"How about I chop and you stir?" Harry suggested. Malfoy nodded again, and Harry set to work on the butterfly wings while Malfoy opened the moss oil. At least Malfoy seemed to be feeling better, if his steadied breathing was anything to go by, making things considerably less uncomfortable.
Malfoy's arms didn't lift to return the embrace as Harry buried his head into the other's neck, arms tight against his back. Harry breathed in the soft pine that was embedded in Malfoy's clothing, trying to calm himself as the thought of what would have happened if he hadn't come out that night filled his head.
"No matter what you think," Potter said, "You are allowed a second chance. You were acquitted of your crimes, and I know you have to want things to change. And if you're willing to do it, then you deserve that second chance."
“You want me to prove just how inaccurate that is, Potter? Or can your overly-inflated ego handle it?”
Harry looks up at Draco, finds him cleaning the carpet with his wand and muttering murderously under his breath. Not wanting to catch the bad end of
Harry looks away first with a grunt, willing away the white-hot embarrassment coating him like slime as he stands, heads for the kitchen. “I’ll just toss the food."
Hermione scowls. “First of all, that was most definitely not an accident and you ought to have used that moment to teach Teddy not to pull on a cat’s tail.”
"Here," Potter said when they were dressed, offering Draco the cloak. He pulled it over his head and was surprised at the clarity of vision through the fabric. "Just...stick close to me."
"Well, I think I ought to catch some sleep," he said, quickly tossing his school things away and standing up. Neither Ron nor Hermione looked at him.
“Look,” Harry begins. “Everything is going perfect-” A very familiar shriek filters through the cracked door. “-ly.” He grimaces. “Dammit...I’m sorry, Ron.”
Herbology passed in a haze, Draco shifting between holding his head and stuttering out any breath he could, sure he was going to drop dead any second, to scratching random words from the blackboard onto his parchment. When the bell rang, he simply dropped his head onto the desk, feeling exhausted and wanting to sleep. At least his next period was a break, then lunch. So much time before he had to be anywhere.
"Well...if you're here and offering, it'd save me a hassle later if you could pick up some formula at the store down the road."
Draco had intended to accept Dumbledore's offer, make that decision for his family, keep them safe from the evil that resided in their own home. But Draco had hesitated, and those precious seconds had cost Dumbledore his life and Draco the last shreds of his innocence.
So much could have gone wrong. But rather than the bad Malfoy luck as of late, Draco had the best Christmas he'd had in years. He smiled foolishly to himself as he tossed beneath the cover, tangling himself against the cold that never seemed to seep from the manor. And Harry had told him, for a third time, that he loved him as they had said their goodbyes outside Andromeda's door. The women had been busied with making their own plans for the new year, and Harry had leaned into Draco's side and whispered it in his ear.
But admitting it to the Care-Seekers, who hold Teddy’s fate in their hands by judgement of Harry’s capabilities, doesn’t seem wise.
Neither have mentioned, talked about, even hinted at acknowledging Draco’s drunken night some four to five weeks ago, but ever since, Harry has noticed a distinct defensiveness anytime the subject of independence arises. Perhaps not exactly a sensitive subject; just an uncomfortable one.
Harry Apparates them to the only park he knows about in London, a muggle one that sits between his old flat and the grocers he used to frequent. It’s large and almost always busy, making it easy for him to conceal or hide any magic Teddy might let slip in the chaos. Harry hasn’t been back in a few weeks, as he and Teddy have been enjoying the open grassy area outside their building lately. They both take a deep inhale of the playground’s smells the moment they arrive, concealed partially by a large rosebush. Stepping from its safety, Teddy’s face lights up at the intricate, wooden structure with metal attachments, his entire body quivering with excitement at Harry’s side. He gives Teddy a nudge, releases his hand, then watches as he vanishes among the other children.
She quirked an eyebrow at him and took her notes back. "I suppose you could say that. Seeing as how no one was in any condition to do any work over the holidays, I took it upon myself to read the textbooks before term."
"Mostly the same," Ron said, breaking Harry's musings. "I reckon it'll be pretty rough tomorrow, saying good-bye, but once she calms down after we leave, she'll be fine. She's good like that."
"Well..." he began, then thought better of it. Understanding as Hermione could be, she may not have approved of him simply giving away his notes to Malfoy. "I guess I was just listening. Wanted to make sure I heard it all instead of worrying about writing it down."
Embarrassment scorched through Harry's body, burning his skin and making him want to crawl into a hole for the rest of eternity. But amidst that humiliation, Harry's mind was now involuntarily piecing together images of him and Malfoy, of skin and lips and-
"I'll order us another round of Butterbeers, shall I?" Granger offered after a moment. Weasley just continued to look between Draco and Potter.
"Just leave me alone, Potter," Draco said, trying to sound as scathing as possible. But even he could hear how downright terrified he sounded. His chest was constricting, and Draco suddenly felt like he couldn't get enough air. He gasped a little for breath, and Potter took another step forward, arm coming up.
Harry snorted and Draco shot him a glare. Harry cleared his throat. "Sorry. It just-you vomited on her? She that awful?"
Draco chuckled. "Relax, Harry, it was amazing. I'm just not going to be able to walk right for a week."
Malfoy was standing there, staring blankly at the contents of the bubbling cauldron, swaying back and forth slightly.
A soft moan left Draco's lips at Harry's touch. Encouraged, he lifted his hands to completely remove Draco's robes and shirt in one motion. They fell to the floor and Draco was left shirtless and against the wall, just as Harry needed him to be.
Not quite suppressing a smirk, Draco turns his attention back to Teddy. “Do you need to- Teddy, did you
"It's going well." And only because he thought it rude not to, he asked, "How's...uhm, how's Teddy been?"
Without thinking much more on it as his lips found Draco's again, Harry carefully slipped his finger inside.
They stepped out onto the street and a fierce wind slammed the door closed behind hem, whipping their cloaks into a frenzy. Draco pulled his hand from Potter's in a vain effort to keep himself warm, crossing his arms and bowing his head against the wind.
She took a long drink from her glass. "Oh, he apparently found out that you've been being attacked in the corridors between lessons." He shot her a wide-eyed look as she took a bite of cereal. "I would have told him that you could take care of yourself, but it really seemed that you can't if these attack are still happening. So, here I am. Granted, I probably would have sat with you this morning regardless, seeing as how rare it is that you come to meals, but Harry's concern had me planning on seeking you out after my cereal instead of hunting for dandelions."
Incredible weight crashes into Draco’s knees. The world rockets beneath him, reaches up and punches him in the back of his head. Did he sit down? It feels as if there’s a chair under him.
Potter led Draco to an empty classroom a couple corridors away, closing the door after waiting a couple seconds too long for Draco to enter. With a deep breath, Draco removed the cloak. Potter's eyes shot over to him as Draco emerged and handed over the cloak. Potter tucked it into his bag with a small smile.
"You keep using that word, 'deserve'." Potter said. "But what makes you think that you're the only one who knows what people deserve?"
Harry's hand on Draco's back slid further down, finally cupping the firm arse there and pressing their cocks together between them. Unintentionally, one of Harry's fingers slipped between Draco's cheeks, dragging gently across the entrance within.
Both Care-Seekers nod. Mr. Cook stands then, and Harry hastily follows suit. The rise is clumsy with Teddy still glued to him, and Harry strains not to look as out of sorts as he feels.
A soft laugh came through Draco's nose but he didn't answer. Not wanting to press the issue and possibly spoil the day, Harry pulled Draco toward the store.
Only their boxer briefs separated them, and Harry's chest burned as it slid against Draco's skin. A thin sheen of sweat covered them both as Harry kissed and licked Draco's mouth with every bit of passion he had. Fire connected them at every contact and it only seared when Harry grinded his hips against Draco's.
His hands slid up his forehead and tangled into his hair. No, no matter how much Harry wanted to disappear forever, he could never do it. Besides, as Hermione had gently mentioned, one more year at Hogwarts would guarantee his privacy from the general public, at least. Working for the Ministry, however, he would become public property again under the ever watchful eye of his fans.
A very pregnant pause followed Weasley's words. Draco couldn't bring himself to look up from staring at the table, not really seeing it. The thumb on his knee began to rub his leg softly, reassuring.
Draco looked over and found Harry taking slow, long blinks. He obviously wasn't much of a morning person.
They seemed to freeze in time, their hands not quite ready to release one another. The high of orgasm made Harry smile like a fool on Draco's lips as they both panted into each other, gulping for air.
in Teddy’s voice. He reaches his arms out for Malfoy, who hurries forward and brings Teddy into his arms, embraces him tightly. Harry struggles against a grimace of annoyance at the comfort he wishes he could have given Teddy.
A soft grunt twitched Harry's chest. Draco glanced down at the face on his shoulder. After a moment of slow squirming, Harry's eyes fluttered open, glazed over from sleep. He looked up at Draco and smiled lazily before leaning up and pressing a small kiss to Draco's lips.
“It’s a routine procedure with cases of adoption and similar scenarios. The child’s Care-Seekers make scheduled visits to the home to ask questions, evaluate, make observations. After a period, the guardian or guardians are either deemed fit or not.”
There was a somewhat blank look in Potter's eyes for a second, then he leaned over the edge of the bed and produced a bundle of flowing fabric that reminded Draco of liquid silver.
Hermione sighed as though hearing his thoughts. "All I'm saying is that if you persist this...let's call it a 'friendship' with Malfoy, it's going to draw attention. Just...be prepared for it to be taken either way."
“Fancy a quick birthday drink? Hermione said she’d duck out a bit early to join if I could convince you.”
Draco gasped slightly as he suppressed an unexpected sob. "No. It's...it's not right. It's impossible."
Draco took three sharp kicks to his sides before the laughter echoing off the empty corridor walls began to fade away, footfalls taking the boys around the corner and leaving Draco alone at last. When silence met his ears, Draco sat up, groaning, and inspected his arms. Dozens of tiny burns covered them, each a varying shade of shining red. They stung when Draco let his robes fall over his arm again.
It’s hard to see clearly for the midnight hues, but Harry manages to make out Malfoy sitting on his bed. His back is to Harry, his head is in his hands, his shoulders are bare, shirt discarded somewhere unseen. He’s quivering just enough in the dark for Harry to see, to notice.
Another hand gripped Draco's free arm, guiding him to sit down. The panic subsided ever so slightly, like the tide pulling out for a momentary lapse, and Draco lifted his eyes to Potter's.
"Still a git, mind you," Harry continued, and Draco saw a smile playing at his lips. "But definitely not evil. Besides, things were obviously different this year. Took barely a day to see that."
Draco tried to glare at her, hating Harry Potter. But he hadn't anything planned for the day anyway, and Draco found himself ten minutes later crouched over helping Luna Lovegood search for dandelions in the frosty grass.
"I only meant that I wish things weren't so hard on you," she said to his back. "We all made unfortunate decisions, but you were just a boy when all this started. You were hardly given a chance."
Draco's stomach twisted with regret. He had come an awfully long way in the past few months, but Draco still didn't feel entirely certain that he deserved the happiness that begin with Harry brought him. Was he really ready to commit more than he already had to dooming Harry to the reputation of being seen with a Malfoy? Already students at the castle whispered when they walked together in the corridors as friends. How much worse might it become if they actually crossed that line and showed the true nature of their relationship in the open?
For several seconds they simply stood there, Draco gasping for air and shaking pathetically against the corridor wall. Potter's hand remained on Draco's arm, holding him firm without being too tight.
The office isn’t but a couple blocks from the Leaky Cauldron. Despite firm, constant requests not to, Draco feels as if he’s earned a drink or two. Maybe more. Regardless of any simmering guilt, he steps into the bar a few minutes later.
"I think he's sinking back into a depression," Hermione said when she saw where Harry's eyes were. "How have you been doing lately?"
Harry’s mind immediately starts to wander, thinking of what the unprepared Ministry staff must be struggling to handle behind Azkaban’s new walls. It was just how Lucius Malfoy was murdered, riots in the prison led by those most devoted to Voldemort.
Harry about leapt out of his skin at the voice behind him. He spun around and found Malfoy, black eye long healed and gone, standing a few feet behind him in the empty corridor.
Potter’s voice filters over Draco like marching ants. “I still think you could be more affectionate, but...but I can work on teaching him how to fall asleep on his own. Be a little less-”
A rather knowing smile twists Ms. Dribble’s thin lips. “As, ah...chivalrous as that may be, Mr. Malfoy, I must stand firm. These cases are never easy, and there is always more than one person that feels to be on the losing end in the beginning. But keep in mind that Mr. Potter and Teddy will be checked on periodically. Should Jameson or I catch any whiff of unsuitability, there will be interventions.”
"Well, someone ought to, since you apparently think that this," Weasley again gestured furiously at Draco, "is anything but wrong."
The frigid November continued, carrying into a calmer December with skies that only seemed to wish to drown the castle in snow. Several feet blocked paths to and from the lessons that were usually held outdoors, keeping Herbology and Care for Magical Creatures in odd classrooms on the first floor as the Christmas holidays drew closer. The cold was absolute, keeping even the most adventurous of students wrapped tight in their cloaks and away from the drafty windows.
Half an hour later, after splashing the coldest water he can draw from the tap onto his face and pulling on a fresh pair of navy robes, Draco stands outside the derelict building that houses his weekly torture. It’s a St. Mungo’s affiliate for all the mental health services, where all the therapies and similar for the wizarding world are addressed. All one needs is their wand and they can walk directly through the barricaded doors and into the office.
"Look, I get it, you don't want anyone to die anymore, and no one said anything when you wanted to make sure he was alright." Weasley gestured sharply at Draco, not even bothering to look at him anymore. The neighboring table of Gryffindors stopped the bulk of their talking to watch as Weasley's voice grew louder, angrier. "But then you start hanging around him in between lessons, meeting up in the library, and you know what? Whatever. You want to keep playing hero and try to keep everyone happy and safe? Whatever. But you're taking it too far when you bring him around us on the weekends."
They were both still wearing their mittens, but a pleasant warmth still flowed through Harry at the contact. "Relax, I was only messing around. It's your first time here, then? Looking for something specific?"
Draco jerks in his chair to aim a furious scowl at Harry as he leaves the table. “I practically bribed this boy to eat old noodles because of you, and now you’re just letting him do exactly what I’ve always been allowing?”
Thankfully, Teddy comes without anymore argument than a pout, but he does refuse to sit in Draco’s lap once he’s settled into the chair next to Potter. Teddy instead wanders the little space behind them, examining the tables holding bowls of fake fruit.
A small hum of what could be taken as agreement comes from across the flat. Draco puts the last of the dishes back in the cabinets, then makes his way toward the second bedroom, certain that Teddy isn’t actually listening to him.
“Just just have to do as your told and not vomit for about half an hour, then it’s over. You can manage that.”
Andromeda had been kind, though. She allowed Harry a visit any time he requested, and when Harry had returned to Hogwarts, she had sent him monthly pictures without ever having been asked. It was a unique relationship, one that Harry had almost immediately taken to with ease.
“It’s in the boy’s best interest; a little more than a solid year of such consistency with two people he knows and trusts.”
It didn't warrant an answer, and Harry snatched Draco's hand back in his and led him out of the dungeons, Granger and Weasley at their heels. It was blissfully strange, Draco thought as the four skipped up the castle to the library to spend the remainder of time until lunch. The golden trio of their year, heroes of the wizarding world, walking happily alongside the teenage Death Eater that was practically the reason for Albus Dumbledore's murder. But Draco couldn't bring himself to stress over the details of the strangeness of their group as they filed into the library, quietly giggling among the shelves.
"Really! He's just a stupid Gryffindor with too much pride to actually apologize." Karen rolled her eyes, her arms coming uncrossed as she leaned closer to Draco. "But he is, and that's saying a lot. Not everyone is as backward as the
The walk to the Astronomy Tower took barely any time. His feet knew the way, his body prepared for all the possible routes to avoid detection. When he finally made it, Draco let the cold wind slap his face without flinching. He breathed a sigh, the cold air filling him up like a drink.
Even Draco could hear the foolishness in his words, feel the obvious escape in them. But his mother tactfully smiled and nodded at him, giving his arm a gentle pat. "Good night, honey. I will see you when you are more awake."
Though he didn't reply, Malfoy opened his eyes, looking overwhelmingly doubtful and scared. His eyes shifted forward to the board. His breathing hadn't eased any, and his hand shook terribly as he lifted his quill and attempted to write something.
The bread in Draco's mouth hurt when he swallowed much too soon. He could clearly hear Bellatrix's voice scathingly asking if he was going to babysit the 'cubs.' Draco could only assume that his mother was remembering the same comment, for she cleared her throat and shifted in her chair.
“Well, yes.” Harry rubs at the back of his neck. “So we have to get going pretty quick. You ready, Teddy?”
His ankles were snatched by an invisible force, ripping Draco from the ground and pulling him high into the air and smacking his head against the stone floor in the process. The little Ravenclaws laughed when Draco's robes fell around his face, casting him into darkness.
Right, Harry thought. He was at the Hog's Head with Aberforth. Shit, he really was in trouble if Professor McGonagall had found him there.
It was short, vague, and far from heartfelt, but it was all Draco could think to write in the time he had before his mother was calling him downstairs. He hastily rolled up the letter, strapped it to the tiny owl, and threw it out the window. It hooted gleefully and took off, leaving Draco with an anxious knot in the pit of his stomach. Nothing in between him and visiting Andromeda and Teddy now.
"I..." Harry swallowed, licking his lips. He dropped his gaze and pulled his hands from Draco's chest. The wind whipped at the warmth there, stealing it in an instant. Harry cleared his throat, and his voice was flat when he said, "I'm glad you're alright. I'll just...I'll leave you alone now."
"Oh, Mr. Potter, what excellent timing!" Madam Pomfrey cooed. "Come in, come in, I just about to discharge Mr. Malfoy here. I'd like you to see him to his common room, please."
Of course Teddy is terrified of him now, Draco thinks with a fresh wave of shame; Teddy has never seen Draco so much as raise his voice before. Seeing what was likely the bulk of Draco and Potter’s row, Teddy just witnessed one of his favorite people, one of the two only people in his life anymore turn into a monster before his very eyes.
"And, if you and everyone else just have to keep calling me a saving-everyone-person," Harry continued, sounding mildly annoyed, "then yes, in a way, I'm trying to save you. But honestly, my wanting to save you is far less noble and more selfish than anyone I've tried to save before."
As the rest of the class murmured their agreement, Draco kept his eyes down. He felt as though he were beginning to suffocate, but he didn't dare draw attention to himself by asking to be excused.
Panting as quietly as he could, Draco looked up at his name. Harry was still seated beside him, though it looked like the lesson was over. Students filed out of the greenhouse around them. Their whispers and their glares only made Draco shake even more.
"I know." Potter's face was serious, all traces of teasing gone. For a few seconds, Draco simply stood there and stared back at him, unsure of what to say. But when he realized that he was beginning to lean on his toes, chest leading him forward ever so slightly, Draco shook himself, stepped around Potter, and left without another word.
Harry already had the cork off the vial, making it simple work to dump the leaves into the cauldron. The potion's surface shimmered slightly at the addition, emanating a soft hiss as it turned a milky violet against Hermione's continued stirring.
Malfoy leaned over, reaching for Harry's open textbook across the desk. His arm grazed Harry's, and their sides pressed together briefly as Malfoy pulled the book closer. Several layers of clothing separated them from truly touching, but Harry felt the contact as though seared. An odd whooping sensation befell his stomach, and he could only blink, frozen, as Malfoy searched the textbook with his side still against Harry's.
At that, Draco stood. He really had overstayed his welcome in the busy common room, and he was so drained from everything that had happened in the past half hour that he hoped he might actually be able to sleep.
“Well, obviously, it would be in Teddy’s best interests not to home-hop, but he also needs a home that can provide a stable living environment filled with love and patience as he goes through this tough time.”
Hope, tentatively breaking through the raging waves of complete despair, peaked in Draco's eyes, and Harry found himself leaning into the short distance between them.
A warmth filled Draco's chest that had nothing to do with lust when Harry smiled at his words. He leaned over and pressed a tender kiss to Draco's forehead, then flopped onto his back on the mattress.
Biting his lip, Harry looked down at Malfoy, almost hoping he would wake up. But the blond slept on, his body inching closer to Harry the longer he sat there.
uncharacteristic, the understanding in Draco’s voice. “I have to think that raising a magical child in the heart of a predominately muggle city is probably just challenging. Was the other child hurt badly?”
The large clock in the lounge chimed, echoing faintly throughout the manor. Draco glanced at his own clock, hardly surprised that it was nearing one in the morning.
"All we have is each other. I ought to have at least pretended to grieve with her. But I let her do it alone."
Hermione gave a self-satisfied smirk. "Oh, yes. I think they overheard my name through Rita Skeeter, though it didn't work out the way she had probably thought it would. Instead, I helped write some of the new rules for publishing there and helped draft a few laws that will hopefully be in effect in the next few months about honesty in the press."
Harry watched her turn and storm from the bar. He was supposed to follow her, he was sure of it. Harry lifted a hand and waved to Aberforth.
Panic was mounting in Draco's chest, every instinct screaming for him to run, to bury himself in the darkness of his bed and never resurface. Nothing could save him from suffocating but the sanctuary of his room. Lightheadedness was fast approaching, and Draco bowed his head as he pressed his back against the wall for support.
Intrusive thoughts flashed across his mind. Pale skin, pale hair, pale eyes. A leg across his own. Skin beneath clothing that was just in the way-
"Yeah. I saw the owl on the grounds and thought it was pretty, so I went to pet it, and it had a letter with your name on it." Karen offered a rolled piece of parchment out to him.
"Harry? Malfoy?" Ron shouted through the thankfully locked door. "I know you're in there, and I know what you're doing is absolutely disgusting."
"I expect dinner to be finished soon," his mother said at his back. She stepped to the kitchen door, resting her hand on the handle. "Why don't you drop off your things in your room and I'll see to making us a couple of plates?"
requested a meeting with me to be a more permanent fixture in Teddy’s life,” he drawls, deliberate in his satisfaction. “I wouldn’t have missed a chance to have my name on the papers for the world.”
He didn't leave right away. Draco and Potter sat there for felt like ages, listening as Weasley moved about the room. Potter's hand slipped from Draco's mouth but the hand cradling the back of his head remained, fingers moving so subtly in his hair that Draco wasn't sure Potter even knew he was doing it. Weasley seemed to be taking his time on purpose, unwittingly leaving Draco and Potter to simply sit there in silence. In Potter's bed. Under the covers. Legs still mostly tangled together.
But Draco wasn't a complete fool. For all his avoidance of those that were desperately trying to tell him the truth, he knew that it was somewhat outrageous to think that the Department of Magical Law Enforcement was after his mother because he had made a friend in Harry Potter. It wasn't entirely plausible, though what Draco had told Hermione was the truth - he couldn't take the risk that his choices weren't affecting his mother the way the media had detailed. They were all each other had. Draco would be damned if he was going to cause her any more trouble.
Teddy falls back onto his bottom with a giggle. The smaller girl falls forward, though, and her chin smacks the wood with an audible pop before she slides the rest of the way down, crashing into Teddy with a tearful shout.
"You been practicing that spell a while now?" he sneered. "I'd be more impressed that you managed to trip me, but the ropes are far too loose to do much more than that."
Finally alone, with the last of his adrenaline that had been fueling him fading, Draco was hit with how weak he felt. After a few weeks of sleeping and eating almost properly, Draco's abrupt about-face back to skipping entire days' worth of meals and missing out on all but a few precious minutes of sleep each night had apparently decided to catch up with him. His knees shook and his vision clouded, graying around the edges as dizziness muddled his brain. He slammed into a pillar, leaning hard before sliding to the frozen earth below.
Harry pressed his forehead to Draco's as Carraway's footsteps began to fade down the corridor and out of earshot. When it seemed as though she had truly gone, Harry spoke, voice barely audible.
"At one point, I shared a mind with Voldemort." Draco snapped his eyes back to Harry. "Not all the time, but usually when I slept, I could see through his eyes. And more than once...I saw you. The look that was always on your face wasn't something you wear if you're thrilled about what's going on around you. I couldn't get that look out of my head. There was no way you were as evil as I always made you out to be."
“My word, you misunderstand me in your urgency to paint me as the villain in your boring little world.” Draco rolls his eyes. “You think I’m going to do a single thing that might remotely jeopardize my seeing Teddy? I knew you were an idiot, Potter, but
"It's a bit more than that, mate," Harry said, and Draco raised his eyebrows at him, vaguely surprised.
"But why are you here? Why are you doing this to me?" Draco finally turned then, finding Potter with his hands in his pockets and brows knitted in confusion.
Harry eases the door closed again. He tiptoes himself back to the couch, yanks the covers over him like a child scared of what the shadows might bring, of what his own memories might dredge from the past. There’s a lot about Malfoy that is predictable; sobbing alone in the middle of the night after arguing with Harry is not on the list of expecteds. And against everything in him that screams not to care, Harry finds himself listening too intently to the indistinct sounds of upset for a long time before being able to fall back asleep.
Harry knocks Teddy’s cup of water clear over, drenching the table. Draco drops his head into both hands.
Silence fell over them again. Draco made to quickly finish his food before something else could come up in conversation. Thanks only to Harry's forceful insistence, Draco had been able to eat more than a few bites at once, though it only took a turn in topic to spoil the roast in his mouth.
"Hey," Harry said, grabbing Draco's chin and tilting his face up until their eyes finally met. "It's...look, she's just-"
“Maybe because I’m not what you’ve always made me out to be!” Without meaning to, Draco’s voice falters. All the hours being forced to sift through his deepest emotions and memories and shortcomings creep out now, at the worst possible time, lacing through his words, soaking them with the thinly-veiled depression there. “Maybe I was just a bloody child caught on the wrong side of things! You think I wanted to end up where I did?”
Draco's mother had greeted him with a smile on the platform in London. It was a wonderful surprise to see her smiling again, and Draco hadn't hesitated in wrapping his arms around her when she threw herself into him. But as they left the station in search for a safe place to Disapparate home, somberness had befallen her once more, stealing that smile from him.
"We...well, we talked a bit," Ron said, looking uncomfortable. Harry's stomach churned in anticipation and his heart was already beginning to sink when Ron finally grimaced and took a deep breath. "Look, he...I'm sorry, Harry. He said that he just can't do this to his mum. He said that it's over."
he’s incapable of being unconditionally affectionate in the way Teddy deserves. He would love to blame the entire thing on Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, and yet Draco feels it with his very soul, the crushing weight of his inability to just
A needy groan erupted from Draco's throat as he bucked his hips both forward into Harry and backward into the finger there, vaguely surprising Harry. He pulled his tongue away from its dance with Draco's so he could ask, "Did...was that a good...did that feel good?"
Draco grabbed him by the shoulder and drug him over to the staircase entrance. Where Carraway was due to appear any second.
With a loud crack, Potter Apparates into existence, just at the other end of the couch. Squealing with delight, Teddy launches from Draco’s lap to tackle his godfather to the floor.
The manor was nearly just as he had left it - much too cold, far too dark, conspicuously void of anything that had once made it a
Draco groaned inwardly. It had been easily a year since he had actually spoken to Pansy, and for good reason, he had always told himself. But she was apparently still licking some wounds and trying to cause a scene as the common room continued to fill with students returning from dinner. Several paused to look over at them.
She seemed to take the tension with her. Light laughter followed her words, and soon overlapping conversations filled the Hall again as food appeared on the tables.
“It might take some time for you to gauge if he’s eaten enough,” Ms. Dribble speaks up, just behind Harry, who jumps. “Toddlers are strange and fickle creatures. They have odd eating habits and inconsistent stomachs.”
“So this is the Weasley family to which you’re referring?” Mr. Cook interrupts. Harry nods. “Well, we’ll see if we can arrange an interview with Mrs. Weasley in the next few weeks.”
“Well, right now, Harry is solely responsible for any financial needs Teddy requires.” Mr. Cook sits back in his chair. “This includes annual check ups with a Pediatric Healer, toiletry items, food, clothes, future education costs, any emergency services that come up, and so forth. That is all on Harry as the sole legal guardian. As you are legally, technically being regarded as a childcare entity of sorts, Mr. Malfoy, this document is requiring you to provide what any other such service would: should the need arise and Harry does not provide items you need for Teddy while he’s in your care, you are responsible to provide them, and Harry is bound to reimburse any amounts spent outside 25% of any given cost. This section here-” Sitting forward, he points. “-gives the specifics of this 25%.”
