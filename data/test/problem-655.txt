“But you still haven’t answered my question,” Draco pointed out.
Kellen greeted them as they stepped through the fireplace into the kitchen. She only spared a curious look at Amelia the orchid before launching into the new security precautions that had been put into place. Essentially, only DMLE staff with a certain security clearance could come through the Floo, and while Harry could make calls, no calls from outside the DMLE could come through. Only Harry and Draco could Apparate in and out, and even then only on the front doorstep. The previous wards Harry had put on the house had been strengthened, making it practically invisible to the outside world except to those Harry had shared the secret of the address with.
The Elves nodded, stoic expressions revealing no trace of fear or concern. The king nodded once, then turned back to Harry, who immediately rolled his shoulders back, doing his best imitation of Sirius’s power pose.
Harry looked over at the silver cat, who was sitting back on his haunches at attention, more alert than Harry had seen him in weeks. When Harry turned back to Kellen, it was to flickering green flames. Harry bit his lip, then strode out of the room, calling over his shoulder, “Stay here and keep an eye on the Floo, get me if anything happens.” He heard a distant chirp behind him as he ran up the stairs to the guest room.
“Yes,” Harry admitted, tousling Teddy’s hair, “he is.” He looked up at Andromeda, who raised her eyebrows at him. “I’ll explain later. But now, I think we should head in, alright?”
Draco frowned. “Shouldn’t I? I followed in his footsteps all those years. I approved of what he did before the war.”
Harry’s lips twitched into a smile. “I think you can call me Harry, now.”
. And trust me, next chance I get, I’m taking you to the cinemas.”
, Harry wanted to shout,
“Oooo, so original,” Harry teased. He nudged Draco’s shoulder, looking up at the other boy with twinkling eyes. Draco smiled back. The hopeful warmth in his grey eyes sent Harry’s stomach skittering in circles so that he had to press his lips together to ensure it didn’t come tumbling out of his mouth. Then Draco’s smile faded, and he looked away, shoving his hands into the pockets of his trousers. Harry’s shoulders slumped, crestfallen, as he frowned at his boots.
family. Harry, they were
“You hate it, don’t you,” Draco mumbled. He crossed his arms over his chest to hide it. Harry sat up and tugged Draco’s arms away.
Draco rubbed his face with his hands, his mind still catching up with reality. “Snake,” he managed, his hands now running through his hair as the nightmare replayed in his head. “Nagini. Wrapped around me. Was going to kill me. Bodies, everywhere, so much blood.” He jumped when he felt Harry’s hand on his back. When his hand began to rub gentle circles between Draco’s shoulder blades, Draco slowly relaxed into the touch. He slumped wearily. “It’s been so many years, but I can still hear him,” he murmured. Harry nodded.
“You can see me?” the man asked, his voice a quiet drawl. Harry cleared his throat and nodded.
Harry worked him open torturously slowly. A lubricant spell and three fingers later, Draco was pressing back against him, keening as each thrust brushed against his prostate.
Harry’s laughter caught in his throat, and he coughed, trying to clear it. “Oh, I am, trust me,” he managed to say. He took a deep a deep breath, but it came out ragged and unsteady. One of Draco’s hands slid up to his neck, his thumb brushing the sensitive skin below the angle of his jaw. Harry knew Draco was trying to reassure him, but his touch had the opposite effect. His heart thrummed in his chest as he dug his nails into his palms, trying desperately to resist the urge, no, the need to hold Draco, to be held by him, to lose himself in warm skin and the smell of cedar and pine.
“It’s okay, really,” he said. “We don’t have to, if you’re not ready.”
“As much as I love this…”
room. Draco tucked Teddy into bed as if he’d been doing it all his life. Harry kissed Teddy goodnight before following Draco out into the hallway.
A half hour later, Kellen had gotten all the information she needed. “We’ll need to come up with a proper witness protection plan with Robards,” she said as she gathered up her supplies. Harry nodded from where he sat at the end of the table, nibbling on a piece of toast he had nicked from Malfoy’s plate. Malfoy, however, frowned.
“Ron,” Hermione whispered, grabbing hold of her husband’s arm. He shook her off, his gaze still fixed on Harry. Harry, whose insides were warring between hot anger and icy hurt, chewed his lip and bowed his head, turning back in his seat. Draco glanced at him. Harry started at his knees, his hands shoved in the pockets of his scarlet Auror robes. More and more people filed into the gallery, relatives of the victims crowding onto the bench alongside Harry and Draco, some nodding at Draco while narrowing their eyes at Harry. In order to make room, Harry had to press up against Draco, shoulder to shoulder. Harry felt Draco’s hand slide into his pocket, fingers tangling with his. A risk, but worth it. Harry squeezed Draco’s hand tight, thumb brushing up and down against his soft skin. But then, George was brought in by some of the new Azkaban security guards that had replaced the Dementors, and Draco’s hand retreated back to his own lap.
“So, she sold Malfoy Manor to the Ministry, and now it’s a museum, apparently, all about both Wizarding Wars. I hear it’s quite nice. Haven’t been, obviously. I’ll probably never see it again, if I’m honest.”
Draco nodded to himself. He added sliced courgette to the pan before filling a pot with water and setting it on the back hob to boil. Harry got up, his knees a little stiff, and walked over to Draco, leaning his hip against the counter as he tried to catch the other man’s eye. Draco’s expression remained neutral as he chopped up some mushrooms before adding them to the pan as well.
“We’ll figure this out.”
He sighed. “Yeah?”
“I believe it was made for my father, King Lucius, third of his name,” the king said stiffly, as if adding formal titles would remind the man exactly whose presence he was in. He needn’t have bothered.
Neville raised his eyebrows. “If you say so,” he said, getting up and slinging his book bag over his shoulder. “If you ask me, it’s still weird to be sleeping in the same room as him, but if you want to be his friend, then that’s on you. Now come on, we’ve got Transfiguration in ten minutes.”
The years passed. From time to time, Harry would send him an owl, but his letters went unanswered. Draco read them over and over until he had them memorised, repeating Harry’s words to himself during long shifts at the hospital until their meanings unhinged. It took years, but Draco found himself in his work. He was good at Healing. He helped people, and in doing so discovered that he enjoyed it. In the end, he got a position as a Healer at St. Mungo’s working the Accidents and Emergencies room. The hours were long, the pay decent. He had the townhouse to himself since his mother had left to live with family in France, and he was happy alone. He was. After all, if you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth.
since he and Ginny had split. Thanks to Ron, however, apparently the whole department now knew he was dating Draco, who, as they all knew, was a man. Robards sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.
Harry stepped back, away from Draco. He pushed his glasses up the crooked bridge of his nose as he stared at the worn stone floor, the scraps of onion skin here and there. Draco hesitated, then turned back to his cooking as if nothing had happened. After a long pause, he murmured, “Dinner will be ready soon.” Harry nodded and mumbled that he needed to use the loo before walking hurriedly out of the room. He didn’t run, no, of course not. And he definitely didn’t collapse against the bathroom door, didn’t sink into a puddle on the floor as he buried his hands in his wild curls.
“I know,” Harry groaned. “I know.”
“Nothing. Everything.” Harry crossed his arms over his chest as he took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. “Last year… last year, after you told me, my scar started hurting, remember?” Draco nodded with a frown. “Well, when it did, I started… remembering. I saw everything. Everything that happened in your world, to your Harry Potter. And it was too much, I couldn’t handle it, and I’m sorry, I ran. I thought I would never be able to face you again. But in the end, I couldn’t stay away.” He met Draco’s gaze, his green eyes earnest as he searched Draco’s face. Draco shook his head and passed a hand over his face.
Harry nodded to himself, walking down the length of the room, officers scurrying out of his way as he took in the scene. A breakfast service, complete with toast racks and cafetieres, had been laid out on the gleaming oak table that spanned almost the entire room. The summer sun shone through the tall windows, warming the wood-panelled walls and glinting off the cutlery. Narcissa was at St. Mungo’s in a magically-induced coma, and Lucius’s body had been taken to the forensics lab, but the blood was still fresh on the golden wool carpet. There was a place setting at either end of the table, and there the blood lay thick over the china plates and remains of half-eaten breakfasts. There was, strangely, a third place setting at the middle of the table, facing the grand marble fireplace on the opposite wall.
There was silence for a bit. Draco’s anxiety spiked as he worried that he’d pissed Justin off by making assumptions.
“McGonagall said we could, he’s not breaking any rules by leaving,” Theo said, scratching his nose absently. “He twitchier than I remember, he doesn’t like sitting still you know... but it’s really up to him if he wants to skip classes. I still think he’ll do OK with the NEWTs. The little time he spends in our room, he’s always reading.”
Potter's intense expression broke into a big delighted smile. Draco’s stomach gave a lurch, and he suddenly felt nervous.
“Has anyone said anything about the article?” he asked.
It was the afternoon, and most students were in classes now so the corridors were blessedly quiet. He thought about that Gryffindor boy, who’s name he didn’t know, sitting in Transfiguration or something, probably feeling pretty good about life now he’d blasted an evil Death Eater down a flight of stairs and avenged his cousin. Draco felt sick.
He sighed. What had he let himself in for?
“Because no gay man has ever dated a woman before,” he scoffed.
Draco sighed. He turned to face Justin, wringing his hands a little.
“As you said, it’s your choice. Just be careful, and don’t get your hopes up.”
“Stop it,” he said bluntly as soon as they were out of earshot.
“What for?” Harry murmured, pressing his cheek to the top of Draco’s head. Draco gestured weakly at their embrace. “No, it’s okay. I get it.”
“Come in, Mr. Malfoy. I get the feeling that we’ll be missing lunch,” Dumbledore said as they crossed the room to his desk. “I’ll send for some sandwiches, shall I? Please, make yourselves comfortable while I let the kitchens know.” He stood as they sat, Draco perched on the edge of his seat while Harry leaned back in his. He shuffled over to one of the numerous portraits and spoke in a soft whisper to the inhabitant, a harried looking man with lavender robes. Draco still refused to let go of Harry’s hand.
“No,” Draco murmured. “He got married, just after the war, to his best friend’s sister.”
“This is the same cat who left a dead mouse in one of my exes Valentino shoes,” he said, half to himself. Harry snorted.
“It’s not like I’m inviting you over to Pansy’s house for New Year’s,” Draco argued, sinking lower into Harry’s chair, looking like a sulking child. Harry let out huff and stormed back towards his room. He stopped in the doorway and looked over at his shoulder at Draco. “Come on, then. Let’s call your friends. Might as well get it all over with.”
Draco pressed his lips together, torn between laughing at the thought of the Holy Head Harpies bumbling around like drunken bees on their brooms and concern at the bitter edge in Potter’s words. It was no secret the two were having problems, not that Potter would ever admit it. He had been just as surprised as Granger and Weasley when they announced their engagement last year, especially since he, Weasley and Longbottom had spent their share of nights talking Harry down after a fight with Ginny. Draco wondered why no one had told them to end it yet. Or maybe they had, but both of them were too bull-headed to listen.
“Oh.”
But Death was gone. Harry sighed and tucked the stone back into the pouch as he frowned up at the canopy above him. It was more of an answer than he usually got. Most times when he called on the stone, usually to ask for clarification on someone’s death, past or future, he got one-word answers.
Then there was the sound of the door to the flat opening and the thunder of Auror feet on the stairs. Harry jumped to his feet. Malfoy pulled his knees into his chest and returned to staring at the wall. The team crowded back into the empty room, Ivanovich bound and stumbling between them. Auror Dawkins bounced on the balls of his feet, his ruddy face beaming with victory.
They both looked at Ginny, confused. She wiped her eyes and raised her head, her chin wobbling only a little. “What you’re describing,” she said, her voice thick, “it sounds like soulmates.”
Malfoy laughed and shook his head. “Ah, the blessing of being an only child,” he said. “I think Mother had her hands full just raising me, I can’t imagine her having more.”
A week passed since the attack at Malfoy Manor. At Harry’s insistence, Robards let Kellen be the lead investigator on the case, so long as Harry continued to supervise her through her first case as lead. But even the two of them working together could not make head nor tail of the case.
“Someone’s been reading my government and law books,” Harry mumbled as he sat facing Draco, pulling his knees into his chest. “And besides, I’m not going back, I’m staying with Ron, where do you think I go during the winter hols?”
He arrived at the Manor through the drawing room Floo, after making a quick stop for coffee at the stand in the Ministry Atrium. He only had a moment to take in his surroundings – the rich furnishings, the marble floor, the memory of Hermione’s screams and a dagger hurtling through space – before the officers at the scene descended on him and carried him towards the dining room. Harry stood in the doorway for a moment, clutching his coffee, breathing deep to centre himself before the memories swept him away.
The woman raised a thin eyebrow. Harry ran a hand through his wild curls as he gave her a sheepish smile.
When he opened his eyes again, Harry was watching him, and he knew Harry remembered it all. “I tried to ignore it,” he continued, voice barely above a whisper, “but every time, all I wanted was you.”
Pansy looked up from the book she was reading on the sofa with a frown as Draco stormed into the living room of their shared flat. She raised an eyebrow as he threw his messenger bag into the empty armchair with a sharp flick of his arm, a rare display of force.
Draco scoffed. “Situation,” he muttered. He looked down at his lap, where he could just make out the faint outline of his hands, white against black. “You know, then,” he said, voice oddly nonchalant, as if remarking on the weather, “that my family supports the Dark Lord?”
“Oh, I tried to bake a cake,” said Harry. He pointed at the heap of dishes in the sink with his spoon. “But I burnt it. So no dessert, I’m afraid, just dinner.”
“Yeah?”
Harry turned away, leaving Jenkins a trembling mess behind him. He made his way over to the fireplace, where Kellen was conferring with one of the forensic staff. She dismissed the other man as Harry approached. He gave her a side-long look, and she smirked, a dimple forming in her cheek.
Potter chuckled and scrubbed a hand through his wild black curls. Draco’s heart pitter-pattered in that sickening way he hated as he tried not to track the movement, tried not to imagine what it would be like to run his own hands through Potter’s hair.
Harry smiled to himself. He got to his feet with a stretch. “Same as always,” he said, a strange look on his fire-lit face. “I thought of someone I love.”
Without another word, Draco strode off. His father called after him, shouting his name, but Draco never looked back.
Draco hesitated, but only for a moment. Harry’s hand was warm and calloused against his as he shook it. “Alright, then,” said Draco. “Hello. I’m Draco.”
“I love you, too.”
October 1999
“No,” Ron said flatly. “No, don’t tell me. You two aren’t….”
“Dumbledore… he and I were trying to find one of Voldemort’s Horcruxes, but we had failed, and he was weak… When he heard you coming, he made me put on the Cloak and cast a Full Body Bind on me. I saw everything, and I could do nothing to stop it.” Tears were slipping down Potter’s cheeks as he took in a shaking breath. “I’m sorry, Draco. I’m sorry for everything.”
“You know,” Harry said, his voice rough. He cleared his throat and continued, “At some point in time, we are going to have to talk about this.”
“Yep.”
knew I was here?”
“I don’t want to do this when you’re upset,” he said, his voice firm. “It’s not right.”
Draco nodded. Dumbledore lowered his hands into his lap, settling back into his seat.
Ron’s mouth twisted into a repressed scowl. “So you’ve slept with him, have you?” he asked.
As their lips met, Draco was pretty sure he could hear murmurs from the balcony above. For once, Draco didn’t care. It had been ten years since he’d known Harry’s touch, tasted him sweet on his tongue. Their kiss deepened, Harry’s hands at his hips, running up his back, pulling him closer, ever closer. Draco buried his hand in Harry’s curls, pulling just a little, just to hear that quiet moan. His other arm wrapped around Harry’s waist, holding him there, there.
“You can’t be serious,” Harry said, perplexed.
“Because.” Draco laughed, but it was hollow, empty and cold. “Because it’s not true, Harry. It’s not real.”
Harry laughed, and Draco couldn’t help but smile. He kissed the top of Harry’s head as he held him against his chest with both arms. “Fine,” he mumbled, “maybe I did.”
“You would have done something,” Malfoy snapped, lowering his hands to glare at Harry. “If you had been in my shoes, you would have done something, wouldn’t you? You never ran away from someone who’s trying to kill you.”
Harry shook his head, forcing himself to focus on the man in the silver throne on the raised dais. Behind the dais were tall glass windows, outside of which he could just make out the shadowy forms of tentacled creatures swimming through the cloudy water. But when he did lay eyes on the man, all thought of his surroundings was silenced. He knew elves were meant to be beautiful, but the word no longer held any meaning.
Draco finally broke away. He leaned his forehead against Harry’s as they both caught their breath. Draco looked up at him through his lashes, his grey eyes twinkling as he grinned. They didn’t know which one started giggling first, but once they started it was almost impossible to stop. Harry buried his face against Draco’s shoulder to smother his gasps of laughter while Draco rubbed his back with one hand, his own laughs bubbling out of him in surprised hiccups.
“I’m sorry I haven’t told them about you,” Harry said, reaching out and giving Draco’s hand a squeeze. “If you want, we can Floo Ron and Hermione together this evening. And if that goes well, would you at least consider coming to the Burrow on Christmas?”
Draco let out a huff but didn’t say anything.
“Harry?”
“Shoot,” said Harry as he wiped the back of his hand across his mouth. Draco’s eyes tracked the movement, lingering on Harry’s lips before looking away, a rosy blush on his high cheekbones as he sipped his whiskey.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, pulling the other man tight against him. “I’ll keep that in mind,” he murmured, tilting his chin up to meet Draco’s kiss half-way. “Happy Christmas, Draco.”
“Yes,” Draco said, drawing out the single syllable, “because mistakes are liable to happen if you don’t. Like spontaneously combusting curry.” Harry only shrugged again with a charming little smile, as if that wasn’t a big concern for him. “What’s smoking?” Draco asked hesitantly, worried he might not want to know the answer.
“You two aren’t high, are you?” she asked. “Because I swear to God -”
“Because I will not have a queer as a son!” Lucius bellowed, slamming his hands on the desk. Draco winced. Then he nodded once. His expression shrivelled as if he was swallowing acid. He stood, shoving the watch into his pocket.
Teddy let out a short laugh and bowed his head. “Yeah, yeah I know,” he said. Draco gave his godson’s knee a squeeze before pulling back, head turning towards the hall at the sound of his husband’s footsteps approaching. Harry came back into the kitchen, shaking his head.
“Thus the negligée?” Draco asked as he sipped his coffee. Pansy pointed at him with her half-eaten toast.
“Now, now, Piers, let’s check the foul language at the door, shall we? It is unnecessary.”
Harry scoffed. “Fantastic,” he said. He thought he heard Malfoy chuckle. For a moment, there was silence, just the sound of Harry doing his best to breathe deeply and settle the panic tightening in his gut.
happening, but I have a happy, healthy, consensual relationship with a man, and
When Malfoy returned, Harry was nowhere to be found, and a wall made up of their desks and bookshelves divided the room into two. There was a paper sign taped to the end of the makeshift wall. He stepped closer to read the scrawled handwriting, and chuckled.
“You really do like me?” he murmured. Harry turned his head and pressed a kiss into Draco’s palm. When he turned back, Draco’s beaming smile struck him like lightening, stopping his heart in his chest.
He stopped, pushing up his glasses to press the heels of his palms into his eyes. He took one breath, then another. He began to list the steps for proper broom maintenance inside his head. Slowly, the pain subsided, and his breathing evened out. He lowered his hands. When he looked up, Narcissa was watching him, her expression unreadable.
“The war is over, Ron!” Harry shouted. “We can’t just go around killing people in their homes. That’s murder!”
“Because I think I’m falling in love with you,” Harry whispered. Draco opened his eyes and turned his head to look at him in slight surprise. Harry worried that maybe he’d said the wrong thing, that maybe it was too soon – but then Draco’s smile broadened into a grin.
. “I don’t know if it’s for me anymore, you know?”
“I also couldn’t stop thinking about me this week.”
Harry chuckled. But then his expression grew serious again, and Draco’s brow furrowed. “So,” said Harry slowly. “Where do we go from here?”
The train doors closed. Harry sat down by the window, and watched the countryside pass him by. In the distance, he could just make out the dark ruins out in the valley, but within seconds, it was gone.
“Yes, I really am,” he said. “I love him.”
Harry shrugged with a bitter smile as he looked back up at Hermione’s face in the flames. “Oh, I just took offence to him telling me not to flaunt my lifestyle choices at work. I guess me having a boyfriend counts as flaunting, now.”
“Just a little longer, Teddy,” said Harry, raising his voice over the thunderous rain. Draco held up his wand, casting a small Impervious bubble around the four of them. “Goodbyes take time.”
“You deserved it, you toast stealer.”
Harry reached up to wrap his arms around Draco’s neck, pulling him down to rest his forehead against Draco’s. “I know,” he murmured. “Can we just… have this? Before we go our separate ways?”
, Hermione wrote.
“I did,” said Harry. “But I suspect there’s a
?” Ron spluttered. “That git? He’s a teacher? At Hogwarts?”
, he scrawled, trying to fit the words into the small bit of free space left. Hermione read this and frowned. She crossed her arms over her chest, her fingers tapping against her upper arm as she thought.
“Fuck me,” he swore.
“I’m a teacher, I have to like kids,” Draco mumbled as he swayed forward and melted into Harry’s embrace, his head on Harry’s shoulder as if it was meant to be there. Harry chuckled.
“So,” Harry snarled, “McKinnon can parade his mistresses in and out of the department while his
Harry waited until the flames had died down before he turned to Malfoy. “You obviously don’t have to stay here if you don’t want to,” he said softly. “When Robards gets here, we can arrange something else and…”
What else could Potter have to say to him?
“It doesn’t count as cheating if no one involved is in a relationship Ron,” said Potter.
When Zemo, Baron took off the hat to become the newest Ravenclaw, the feast could finally begin.
“I’m sure Pans. I can’t imagine your parents would be very happy to see me,” he replied, as he had every time she’d asked.
“What a merry Christmas that sounds,” he chuckled dryly, “Really Pans, I’ll be fine. What can happen to me here? I’ll just get my work done and take some time for myself. I’m looking forward to it.”
With a few hours left of the journey, Blaise put down his book and went for a wander along the train. Draco gazed out at the green countryside rushing past the window. He practised breathing and staying in the moment, the way his court mandated mind Healer had taught him. Pansy flicked through a magazine.
A sudden crash had them all looking around in alarm.
Potter paused to look over at Draco, as though he were checking that he was following and knew who he meant. Draco nodded jerkily. He knew who his own aunt was, in name only but still. He’d had no idea that Potter knew her well enough to receive early morning letters.
He wasn’t the only one to have noticed. Headmistress McGonagall was eyeing the Gryffindor table with a pinched frown.
He looked up at Draco with sad uncertainty.
“She... she wanted to know if my ‘behaviour’ was going to be a problem which could affect Teddy.”
“Well... they’re conservative so they aren’t thrilled, but they want me to be happy. It does help that I have three older brothers who seem more than willing to carry on the family name. My eldest brother Jeremy will be the future Lord Framlingham, and take Father’s seat in the House of Lords. It’s his children that will carry that on.
The mental image of his father reading that letter made Draco laugh so hard that tears formed in the corners of his eyes.
He gestured for her to lead the way.
“Is Hermione weeping over Harry’s delinquent behaviour again?” she asked, so softly it was almost inaudible.
From there his thoughts descended into darkness. He curled himself up tight and watched the flickering flames in the grate, his mind swirling though a sea of hopelessness.
Draco came back from dinner to find Finch-Fletchley in their room, knee deep in discarded clothes, the Spice Girls blaring in the background. He’d never seen the other boy so happy. Draco hadn’t even thought about dressing up for the party. Finch-Fletchley gleefully started flinging Draco’s clothes around the room as well as his own, when Draco asked for his help in picking an outfit.
Draco froze in panic, sure the Minister could think of a lot of reasons to arrest him, if he wanted to.
“He’s incredibly dense, and he doesn’t know us,” Draco replied, before covering his face with one hand to hide his own laughter as she started wiggling around obscenely in his lap.
“Pansy, she was just mesmerised by your tits, I’d say yes.”
“Would you all please gather at the Gryffindor table?” McGonagall asked as she stepped down from the dais the staff table was raised on.
He was still wearing his clothes from the night before, so he padded down to the bathroom to have a quick shower and get changed. His hand throbbed, and he finally remembered to heal himself before the cut could get infected.
“Late? Potter, you were supposed to be here eight hours ago. That’s not late, that’s just not turning up. AND you were late for our date...” Draco argued, clenching his fists in his blankets.
“The Daily Prophet has been reliably informed that Harry Potter, the war hero previously known as the Chosen One, has been engaging in multiple affairs with fellow male students while in his final year of Hogwarts, writes Daily Prophet correspondent Constance Cuffe. Our readers may be shocked to hear that Potter is now claiming to be a homosexual, especially after Potter’s well documented long term relationships with Miss Hermione Granger and Miss Ginevra Weasley.”
“Oh, and thank you!” he nearly slammed his face into the table when he heard the eagerness in his own voice.
They ended up bringing back two trays, one with everyone’s drink choices, and one that was loaded with shots. Blaise had been adamant. Hermione's eyes widened when she saw them.
“Apparently I’m triggered when arseholes are homophobic... you might remember that I have a bit of a short fuse.”
“Draco didn’t do anything wrong,” Pansy shrilly exclaimed from beside him. He squeezed her hand gratefully.
Weasley looked down and winced a little when she saw the angle Draco’s foot was at.
Longbottom went red and drank.
Blaise’s black-banded owl Nyx landed on the table at breakfast, with a letter from his mother and The Daily Prophet.
“Before I could even think about going back to sleep, an owl showed up at the window with a letter from Andromeda.”
“Oh, nothing,” he said airily. “Nothing for you to worry about Granger, just a misunderstanding.”
Draco thought that was an odd time to have a holiday, not that she didn’t deserve one.
Draco didn’t have a lot of time to care.
Justin had collapsed back on his bed, shaking with laughter.
When he realised what she meant, he laughed.
Pansy and Justin held him tightly as he shook. Pansy ran her fingers through his hair, and Justin rubbed his back, making soothing noises.
“NO! What? No, I mean...” he thought about it. Had he missed that?
“This spell is broken. Ecstasy isn’t serious,  it’s actually hilarious.” He reached to refill his glass.
“What’s so crazy about this year then?”
He squared his shoulders and met MacMillan’s gaze sheepishly.
“I’ll play.”
“What? I was just curious.”
Potter had the decency to look ashamed.
“Honestly? I don’t have a lot of options.”
“Draco, why won’t you call me Hermione?”
“I need to hear all about that Neville,” Finnigan wheezed.
Draco had to agree.
“You mean besides the fact that my boyfriend and my best friend haven’t spoken in months except to shout at each other, because they’re both stubborn arseholes, and I’m stuck in the middle feeling like I’m losing them both?”
“You are right, you cantankerous cow.”
Draco flushed.
“Do you really think I would do that to you?” she asked gently, reaching out to grasp his arm tightly.
“Umm... sure,” she replied, smiling uncertainly at Luna.
“Of course Finch-Fletchley,” he mumbled.
They carried on staring at him with identical confused expressions. He reached his hand up to comb through his hair nervously, when he realised he was sitting here with his hair still done in tiny plaits. They must think him a lunatic.
Draco was putting his height to good use, trying to track down Luna. He eventually spotted her white blonde head over by the windows.
Everyone was silent, processing this statement. Draco looked up, and noticed that a few people didn’t look very happy and Terry Boot looked furious. He was surprised, he thought Ravenclaws especially would like more freedom in their education.
“What happened Malfoy?” she demanded.
“Clumsy like clumsy Pans! I was reading while I was walking.”
“Cousin, that money was your monthly allowance. You’ll get that much every month until you turn 18, then you’ll have all of it,” he told her, smirking. “Believe me, you’ll be able to travel wherever you want, for as long as you want.”
“I’m sure you can, but I don’t mind.”
She looked relieved. His interest sharpened.
When it had been quiet a while Draco sat back up carefully. His chest was burning as he slowly took his shirt off. He didn’t want to look, but experience told him he had to.
“I need a drink,” Draco muttered to himself, turning back to Luna and Girl Weasley.
“I’m glad to have you as my family Draco,” she whispered.
He still hadn’t found her after 30 minutes of searching the crowd, and now he was dreadfully bored. He danced for a little bit, but it was no fun without his friends. He went to refill his drink, and spotted that over in the back corner one of the few remaining sofas was somehow magically empty. He made a beeline for it and claimed one of the cushions.
He let Justin assume what he wanted.
“I’m sorry I wasn’t there darling,” she mumbled into his jumper.
“You’ll just have to wait and see,” Draco said, grinning.
“It’s never too late. You three are bonded tighter than family. I know we can find a way to bring him back. He just needs help,” Luna replied soothingly.
Draco sighed and looked up at Blaise. He couldn’t help but take a second to admire the toned expanse of dark skin on display, with the dusting of black hair across his chest and trailing down from his belly button.
Weasley reached up to pat one of her hands reassuringly.
Pansy’s gleeful expression turned sour.
She came around the curtain, looking uncertain, but she paused when she saw the state he was in. Her eyes roamed over the mark left by the blasting spell, but also the smaller marks and scars which were visible on the exposed skin of his chest.
“You sort of did,” said Pansy casually.
Draco would murder Pansy.
“That doesn’t matter to them. I’ll always be a Death Eater in their eyes. Honestly, tell me why you think this crazy plan would work?”
He felt a swell of admiration for Justin, for how brave he was. He didn’t know what his face was doing, but Justin looked at him with raised eyebrows.
“Stop fretting. It was my own free choice to get involved in your lunacy. Potter didn’t coerce me somehow if that’s what you’ve been worrying about.”
“Is this ‘clumsy’ like my mother says she is after my father’s been drinking?”
Potter’s eyes were wide with horror, and he stumbled away a few steps.
Patil blinked and looked at him. Then her clouded expression cleared and panic flashed across her face.
She crawled off his lap into Potter’s vacated seat, grinning like the knarl that got the cream.
“Of course I have. That’s what I do.”
“Sit down. Both of you,” she commanded.
“I didn’t see anything,” Blaise clarified, “but it’s all anyone is talking about. Potter was spotted going into one of the toilets with Finch-Fletchley. They’ve been in there for half an hour.”
“Where can I find these new dorms Headmistress?”
Potter stood in the corridor, his hands in his pockets and panic in his eyes.
Draco was starting to panic. Potter had already been on a short fuse this evening, and this man was sparking a flame. Draco looked around for any sign of Hermione or the others, but there were too many people in the pub. They probably had no idea what was happening.
He rolled his eyes.
“Don’t be. I’m sure it’ll be... fun?”
“Your father had a secret sister?” Blaise asked, amazed. “How did we never know this? No one can keep secrets in pure blood society.”
He became engrossed in the book, content to wait, but when he looked up he realised another hour had gone past. There was still no sign of Potter. He frowned.
“I think... my leg is broken,” he said through gritted teeth.
I’d like you to join me in welcoming some new members of staff. Amelia Smith will be our new Muggle Studies professor,” McGonagall indicated the young witch with short blonde hair who smiled happily and gave a little wave out to the students. There were a few titters at this and a brief, polite round of clapping.
Draco was distracted, staring at the silver stars dangling from Potter’s ears, but he snorted when they all looked at him. Blaise had told him that he would be expected to pay for drinks, if he expected Blaise to hang out with his “intellectual friends". Blaise was incredibly smart, but he had no interest in making an effort, choosing instead to coast along relying on his natural talents. He said he found bookish people exhausting.
“Harry is the closest thing I have to a brother. I want to be responsible for him. I choose to be in his business, even though I know most of the time he wishes I wouldn’t. I just don’t know how to help him when he won’t listen to me.”
“What about you?” he asked quickly, before Potter could carry on.
Pansy was scrutinising Draco’s face with raised eyebrows, just as Draco realised he’d been staring.
The raspberry crème brûlée looked perfect. Potter picked up the spoon happily, before glancing over at Draco.
MacMillan was next and he gave Justin a hard look. Draco felt like revenge was coming. He pressed his side against Justin.
Pansy’s gaze was cutting when she turned to face him.
He’d thought he was the only eighth year with nowhere to go.
Finch-Fletchley’s tight, posh accent always caught Draco off guard. He had a way of speaking which was at once familiar and foreign to Draco, very similar to the way his father’s friends had spoken, but ever so slightly off. It was pompous yet jovial.
“This is bullshit Draco...” she started but he cut her off by grabbing her shoulders.
When he’d expressed this interest, his father had been horrified. He’d been forbidden. Nothing about muggles was acceptable to his father.
“I can’t. I would hate to make her feel uncomfortable! I don’t want to lose her as a friend.”
She looked disappointed in him. He hated it.
Potter’s outraged bellow rang in Draco’s ears, and he looked up to see Potter charging Howard again, his wand coming up in a dangerous arch.
Draco still felt apprehensive about the whole situation but Blaise’s blue stuff was deadly, and soon enough he found himself standing with Pansy, Brown, and Patil making bitchy comments about people’s outfit choices. Pansy had warmed slightly to the other girls after finding out that Parvati's thirst for gossip was almost as strong as her own.
“Fine you crazy woman! I’ll go, but it’s going to be a disaster.”
Potter’s eyes widened, then for some reason he looked angry, and a bit upset.
Potter looked at him again, startled and incredulous for some reason.
Potter chucked dryly.
“That’s not who I am Draco. I meant everything I’ve said to you. I want to leave the past in the past, and I know you do too.” She sounded earnest.
“Never have I ever known Parkinson was gay before now,” said Longbottom.
“Mr. Malfoy, why don’t you head back to your dorm,” she suggested, “Thank you for your insight.”
He looked at her steadily. Her blush deepened and she looked away.
“You look radiant Cousin,” he half shouted over the music when he finally reached her.
“You think?” she asked, raising her head finally to look at him, a glossy magazine page stuck to her cheek.
Draco stared at him. Was he asking Draco to join him for breakfast? He was smiling brightly but his eyes looks unsure, as though certain that Draco would never agree. Draco wasn’t sure what to do, he thought of Blaise and Pansy, but he didn’t think it would be a good idea to start rejecting an olive branch when it was offered. A year ago he would have viewed the offer as an insult, offended that Finch-Fletchley would think he needed assistance from the likes of him. Now he was self aware enough to realise that he really did need help. He was anxious about leaving this room without knowing that Blaise would be waiting for him, and knowing Blaise he probably wasn’t even up yet.
Draco shivered. It felt like a premonition.
Draco really wasn’t sure, but she had obviously thought it was an idea worth talking to him for.
The smile slid off Draco’s face and he turned to pick up his own clothes. He knew he’d let his guard down too much. Finch-Fletchley was just polite, and he’d tell Draco that he didn’t want to be his friend.
“I’m sorry,” he said softly.
“Well thanks Boot for bringing up the war and ruining the party atmosphere,” said Blaise frostily. “Probably time to call it a night.”
They were still giggling together when Blaise returned just in time for them to depart from the train.
Draco did worry about him though, and for a moment he wished Blaise wasn’t such an idiot.
Using the wall and Lovegood for support, Draco got up on his right leg, keeping his weight off his left side.
“Sounds like a wild night. I’ll think about it,” Pansy said, her voice carefully neutral, not looking at Hermione.
Draco smiled at her.
Draco realised, with a twist in his gut, that Potter was wasted.
He paused, rubbing a hand over his face. Draco was trying not to find it charming that he was so expressive with his hands when he got flustered. He sat down on the edge of Justin’s bed, and stared at his feet before he continued.
“You OK?” he asked quietly.
“Right you are Boss,” said Theo, nodding in agreement.
“You’re not ‘anyone’ Blaise” she said, grinning.
Draco reached out to clasp one of her hands. He felt cold. Another unreported loss of the war.
Weasley made a frustrated sound.
There was only one restaurant in Hogsmeade: The Hungry Horntail. They were meeting there at one o’clock. Draco hadn’t wanted to walk down to the village with Potter, because he was afraid it would be awkward. Well the whole thing was probably going to be awkward, and he wanted to limit that as much as possible. He’d told Hermione that he had errands to run in the village beforehand, as an excuse, so he’d need to leave a few hours early in case she checked.
She squinted at him, while he examined the jar, unscrewing the lid to sniff the contents.
“Oh. That.” Malfoy turned his attention back to his textbook – a thick biology textbook with type so small and dense Harry was surprised Malfoy didn’t go blind trying to read it. “Of course. Contrary to what you may think, I have more going on in my life than just being your archnemesis, Potter.”
Malfoy was sitting in the bed, his knees pulled into his chest, the lightweight coverlet tucked in around him, all the while staring at the dresser covering the fireplace. He startled when Harry came in, his hand flinching towards his wand besides him. Almost immediately, though, he relaxed, his shoulders slumping.
“But how do you prove that they’re soulmates?” Harry demanded, returning to his earlier point. “The way I see it, anyone could just say they’ve found their soulmate and get away with it.”
Draco nodded. He wrapped his arms around Harry and pulled him in close, burying his face against the top of Harry’s head. “Yeah,” he mumbled into Harry’s hair. “I’m okay.”
“No, no it hasn’t hurt in years. Not since the Battle.” He took a deep breath and lowered his hand. When he looked up again at Draco, his eyes were gentle, but haunted by a shadow flickering just beneath the surface. He reached out and traced his fingertips down Draco’s arm, a small frown tugging at his mouth as his fingers passed over the Mark. Then, he leaned down and brushed his lips against it. Draco tried to stifle a gasp. This close, Harry could see that the Mark was surrounded by a series of small scars, some darker than others. He glanced up at Draco. Draco bit his lip.
“And what if he does find out about Draco? What then? We can’t do anything to protect him if he’s discovered! We’d be sentencing him to die!” He didn’t know when he had gotten to his feet. Swept up in his anger, he paced back and forth in front of Dumbledore’s desk. “There’s got to be another way! Some way we can keep him safe!”
“­ – Alec Hallberg, and he’s part of Healer’s United. He’s a good man, Father. Why can’t you just be happy that I’ve found someone who loves me?”
“Harry?” said Draco. He raised his hands, palms facing Harry, reassuring him that there was nothing to fear. Once more, Harry’s eyes found the Dark Mark on Draco’s left arm. Draco, frowning, followed his gaze. His shoulders slumped when he realised. “Oh,” he breathed. “Shit.” He lowered his hands and looked back up at Harry, fighting to keep the hurt out of his expression. “Harry, can you tell me your full name?” he asked as calmly as he could.
“Oh, that reminds me.” Dean wove his way through the common room and, grabbing a pinch of Floo powder, tossed it into the flames. “Seamus!” he called. “You owe me, babe!”
Draco tried to school his features to hide the disappointment on his face. Not that Potter was looking at him, but just in case. He nodded, and mumbled, “Yeah, right, you’re right.” Without another word, they walked back together towards Gryffindor Tower. And if their shoulders brushed from time to time, if their fingers reached but never touched, no one would know.
“Good. Because listen, coming out as a raging homosexual did nothing for my good graces, I can’t imagine what the others would say if I was secretly a Gryffindor.” He smiled at Harry’s snort of laughter, looking for all the world ten years younger, like a yoke had been lifted from his neck. He pulled Harry in for a kiss, and when he deepened it, Harry did not object.
“Oh, I’m Malfoy again? That’s not what you were saying last night.”
Robards was not completely happy to lose Harry to bodyguard duty. He could not, however, argue that there was no safer place than 12 Grimmauld Place, nor a better bodyguard than the Boy Who Lived Twice. So they had a team come by to reinforce the wards, and while that was going on, it was time to go over to Malfoy’s flat to collect some of his things.
“You can say no, you know,” he told Draco. “I won’t be offended if you don’t want to come.”
Harry rolled his eyes and grinned. He rolled up onto the balls of his feet to press a lingering kiss to Draco’s lips, tasting his own mint toothpaste in Draco’s mouth. He tried to deepen the kiss, but Draco pulled away with a laugh.
“I’m not a child anymore,” Harry argued. “I’ll be twenty next month.”
“Maybe that’s how it started,” he said, his voice quiet but firm. “He needed help and he came to me. But he didn’t have to, you know that. He could have disappeared, gone anywhere. And you haven’t been with him this past month, you haven’t seen the things I have – ”
Harry rested his head on his hand, his elbow propped on the table, as he listened with a contented smile to his boyfriend talk. When Draco went to take another bite, the closest to a pause in the conversation Harry could find, he asked, “What about you?”
“Oh,” she said at last. “Huh. Did not expect that at all.”
“… which is why you haven’t really fully understood
“So you’re still with the ferret, then?” Ron demanded. Harry felt Draco flinch behind him. Harry reached back, tangling his fingers with Draco’s, holding his hand tight. Ron’s furious flush, which had begun to creep up from the collar of his short-sleeved button-down, flared up his neck and straight to his ears when he saw their joined hands. Harry could practically see smoke coming out of his fiery hair.
Harry made his way with one hand on the wall for guidance to the kitchen, where he had stashed some water bottles a while ago. He drank one, then opened another, sipping at it more cautiously. Luna’s words rolled through his head, connecting then falling apart only to connect again. How could she know all that, just from looking at his hand?
Draco frowned. “No,” he said. “Although that is up there.” He shot Harry a teasing smile, just to let him know he was joking. Harry smiled back, his stomach suddenly soaring back up, giving him a nauseous form of whiplash. Then Draco’s smile faded, and he turned back to stir the pasta. He let out a long sigh. “I was going to say so I can bury my parents,” he said at last. Harry’s heart clenched as his smile fell. Oh.
“No,” Harry said quickly, waving off their concern. Ron narrowed his eyes but said nothing. “No, it’s nothing bad – it’s good, actually.” Hermione relaxed with a sigh of, “That’s a relief,” but Ron still watched Harry like a hawk. Harry swallowed. “You see, um, we got a new Potions Master.”
Harry put his wand in his back pocket as Draco changed,
“Seriously?”
Harry stared at him in confusion. So Draco leaned forward and brought his face an inch away from Harry’s. Harry’s heart sped as he glanced from Draco’s storm dark eyes to his pink parted lips.
Often, on his way home, he would vow he would never return, that it was the last time. But week after week, summer after summer, his feet pulled him back to the small church in the clearing, where the yarrow and borage nodded and whispered behind their leaves.
Kellen raised her perfectly manicured eyebrows, shooting a mirth-filled glance over at Harry, who ignored her as he set the French press on the kitchen table with an extra mug. “Inconvenient?” she asked innocently. “How do you mean?”
“Professor?” he called through the ancient wood of the door. “It’s Harry.”
Harry leaned back against Draco as he thought. Draco, meanwhile, kept an eye on the pots, half-ready to pull out his wand and cast an extinguishing charm on everything.
“Potter.”
“I’m not going to let him hurt you,” Harry said firmly. Draco looked up with a hiccough, the skin around his eyes red and puffy from tears.
Draco watched him stroll off to the dormitory in stunned silence. Then, he shook his head.
“Potter.”
“What?’ Harry asked.
The priest chuckled. “In the spirit of confession, I will tell you,” he allowed, adding, “but it is not to be uttered outside of this confessional, mind. Again, I gave it up years ago, and just as your parents would not approve of you being here, I would not want my family finding me here, even though they gave me up years ago.”
“Don’t know what?” he was starting to feel anxious. He twisted the sheets in his fists, staring into Lovegood's calm silver eyes. Malfoy eyes.
“I’m really sorry,” was the first thing he said.
“I can hardly help my upbringing Potter. It is what it is,” he said tiredly.
Draco thought he might be blushing and tilted his head forwards so his hair swung forwards a little. Merlin, he was repressed if he was getting worked up about touching Potter’s feet.
Weasley glanced around the room, and then back at him with a cheeky grin.
“Certainly not, Mum was Pandora Malfoy, your father’s older sister.”
From the look on her face when she registered who it was she had just saved, it must have been a reflex, because she looked immediately suspicious.
It was growing, and seeing Potter return to school every year more beautiful than before. It was fear and horror, as his obsession shifted. It was longing and envy.
“I was there, yes,” Draco sighed, not sure where Potter was going.
“Language, Granger really,” he scolded mockingly.
“I’d rather not? Can’t you just fix my leg?”
“You’re stronger than they think Draco. You’re stronger than you think. People will see the change I see in you. You’re a good person.”
Draco frowned at the sudden change of topic.
“You never know,” Potter shot back, and Draco frowned. He really had no clue.
When they were all gone, and Blaise was sucking obnoxiously at the ice in the bottom of his glass, he looked pointedly at Draco. He sighed and got to his feet, making his way across the pub alone.
Draco had no idea what was happening but he rolled his eyes.
“Stop it Potter,” Draco said, as coldly as he could, “It’s not happening.”
“What? No!” said Draco sarcastically, while internally he was shocked. Those Ravenclaws had some balls to throw slurs at Harry Potter.
“It’s none of my business, Potter, you know that,” Robards said quietly. He lowered his hand and considered his next words carefully, crossing his legs as he frowned at his folded hands on his knee. “I should let you know that, while it is perfectly legal for you to have, er, homosexual relations – again, whatever you do in your private life is your business – I would, er, rather you not flaunt it about in the workplace, if you understand what I mean.”
Andromeda let out a wet laugh and dabbed at her eyes with the cuff of her black robes. “I doubt that,” she said, “but still, I would like to get to know you too, nephew.”
“Oh, really? Is that the excuse you’re going with?”
Draco blushed. “I know I tease you about your terrible taste in literature, but I found a copy of Tennyson in your bedside table when I was looking for batteries before the break. People don’t read Tennyson unless they really like poetry.”
Mistress Figg also couldn’t tell him about his parents, and would only grow tight-lipped and feed him stale fruitcake when she saw the welts and burns on his hands. When he asked about his scar, she would sigh and tell him that, “we simply do not speak of these things.”
Harry looked up.
“There’s nothing wrong with you.”
Harry blushed.
“You’re staying at the old Black house, then?”
Draco’s laugh was hollow and mirthless as the memory came back to him – he had gone, hoping that two years had been enough, that he could offer the olive branch, make amends, only for his father to ask him, after far too many glasses of wine for lunchtime, if Draco had come to his senses or if he was still ‘taking it up the arse’. That’s when the chandelier broke. He looked away from the pitying look in Hermione’s eyes and swallowed past the lump in his throat. “In any case,” he said, “my parents and I, we, er, don’t speak anymore. So. I imagine they still have house elves, but I don’t, probably never will, now that I’ve worked in food service.”
“What if you didn’t complete this task?”
“What is it?” he asked. She hesitated, then looked up.
Harry smirked. He rubbed the back of Draco’s neck, pushing his fingers through the short blond hair. “Hey. Don’t let them upset you this much.” When Draco raised an eyebrow at him, Harry gave him a crooked smile. “You use more contractions when you’re upset.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Why would anyone want to do that?” he asked with a small laugh.
Potter sighed. “Depends,” he said. “Sometimes Voldemort is back and everyone is dead.” His lips quirked up slightly at Draco’s flinch at the Dark Lord’s name, but it was gone so quickly that Draco might have imagined it. “Other times,” he continued, “I’m him. And everyone is dead because of me.”
Draco’s hand froze on Scorpius’s back. Scorpius thumped his tail once in displeasure. He forced himself to resume his long strokes along the cat’s flank. He swallowed hard and said, “I told you, I’d heard you were leaving and….”
Draco wasn’t back yet when Harry returned to school the Saturday after the winter holidays. It gave Harry time to do what he would never dare do if Draco was around: he went over to Draco’s side of the room and looked around.
Harry blinked and nodded. “Yes,” he said, “I believe it is.”
“I don’t need help,” Malfoy replied automatically. Without another word, he slipped past Harry and stalked off down the corridor towards the exit. Harry and Tonks watched him go.
Harry slapped Draco’s shoulder with a teasing scowl. Draco yelped but conceded. “Right, sorry. But… are you sure?”
The king considered him over the rim of his wine goblet. “Hogwarts. Yes. I’d almost forgotten.”
Harry face-palmed. Teddy giggled. Even Andromeda cracked a smile.
“You alright?” he asked. Harry only groaned in response. “You want to talk about it?” Another groan that sounded something like a ‘no.’ Draco chuckled. “Fine, fine. Gods, so needy,” he added with a small gasp of laughter as Harry began to kiss and mouth along the slope of his neck. He didn’t complain, however, when Harry walked him back up against the wall of the entryway, pinning him there as he proceeded to nuzzle against his neck, breathing in
“He’s my boyfriend, Dromeda,” said Harry. He looked up at her, his jaw set and a defiant look in his usually soft eyes.
“And what’s that?”
Harry pressed the open book against his mouth so Draco couldn’t see his jaw drop. Draco’s shoulders rose and fell with each heaving breath. The back of his neck was flushed, and he kept clenching and unclenching his fists. He stood there for several minutes, catching his breath. Harry closed his mouth, swallowed, and lowered his book.
Harry hummed. “We’ll just have to be ready, then,” he said flatly.
He and Harry were in the Weasley’s kitchen, Harry peeling carrots as Ron chopped parsnips for the Christmas roast. Since they had become friends, Harry spent every winter holiday with Ron and his family out on their farm in the countryside rather than with his aunt and uncle. The Dursleys didn’t want him around, anyway. He had spent most of his Christmases before meeting Ron alone in his room, aka the utility closet they had shoved a mattress into and called a bedroom. He much preferred helping Ron and his family with chores around the farm, not to mention having snowball fights with Ron and his six other red-headed siblings and eating the fudge Mrs. Weasley seemed to have in constant supply.
“You said. By the river,” Harry whispered. “You wanted to find out who you were without the war, and your parents, and…me.”
“I said that… to push you away. The truth is I – I have been going through a lot, these past ten years. It’s difficult to explain everything. But a lot of it, it’s been me trying to find myself.”
“This seemed easier,” he replied. “Besides, I might be shorter, but I am a heck of a lot stronger than you.”
The king, perhaps, didn’t help matters by addressing Harry first when he came into the room – “Ah, good, you’re here, excellent” – before turning to stand at the end of the council table and demanding, without preamble, to know why his councillors were keeping him in the dark. Harry smirked, crossing his arms and legs and sitting back in his chair as the councillors scrambled to reassure their king that of course they’ve been keeping him informed, where in the world had – was it this human, trying to turn the advisors against their king –
“Yes, but Harry obviously does,” she pointed out. “And honestly, we haven’t seem him this happy in ages. Let him have this, okay? And if Draco does try anything funny, I’ll let you hex him, okay?”
As Harry’s breathing returned to normal, his body began to tremble as the adrenaline wore off. He opened his eyes. As he did so, Draco’s forearm came into view as he continued to stroke Harry’s hair. The sight of the Dark Mark, faded now beneath the pale vulnerable skin, made the panic return hard and fast. Harry pushed his way out of Draco’s arms, scrambling to the far edge of the bed. The adrenaline rushed through his veins once more, as if he had just touched a live wire. He gasped and panted, his heartbeat thundering in his ears. He pressed himself up against the cold stone wall next to the bed. Draco stared at him in confused surprise. Propped up on his elbows, he rubbed the sleep from his eyes.
But then they heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs, and they leapt apart, flushed, lips slick and bruised from kisses. Eyes wide, they both grabbed their books and ran towards the boys’ dormitories, passing a bleary-eyed Neville and yawning Kevin on the steps as they went.
“Why are you telling me this?” he asked. Malfoy shrugged. His smile was crooked when he finally met Harry’s gaze.
“It was a
“Potter, it’s your house, you don’t have to knock.”
“God, no,” he said. “No, I haven’t told anyone besides you two.”
“I didn’t think you wanted the sordid details, Ron,” he said, smiling in disbelief. “But if you want to know, yes, we fucked long before I told you and Hermione we were dating.”
“No,” Harry laughed. “You’re doing better. You’re becoming a better Draco. That’s all I could ask for. No more apologies, okay?” He leaned in and gave Draco a quick peck on the lips, drawing back only to rest his forehead against Draco’s. “Just be here with me, okay?”
Draco wanted this. Right? He had daydreamed about it, imagined what it would be like,
would rip you apart if he found out.”
identify Potter? Why? Why would you betray us like this?”
, he thought firmly,
“How can I believe you?” Draco hissed. Tears began to spill, hot and fast, down his cheeks. He covered Harry’s hands with his, peeling them away from the sides of Draco’s head as he stepped back. Harry’s eyes were filling with tears now, sparkled mirrors. “How?
“Well he’s fucking dead, so it doesn’t matter, does it?”
“I’ve missed you, too,” he whispered. “I’m sorry it took me so long to come back.”
Draco glared at Harry, and nodded his head at Wilkins the house elf, as if to say, “Does this look threatening to you?” Harry ignored him, and stepped up next to Draco to shake the house elf’s hand. Wilkins looked like he could faint as Harry clasped his tiny hand.
Silence. Then,
Harry’s knuckles turned white as his grip on his book tightened. He heard Draco suck in a breath. The temperature in the room dropped several degrees in the space it took for Harry to hear him say over the roaring in his ears,
He heard the back door open and close. The soft shuffle of footsteps, a huff of breath as a body was lowered to sit on the step, then another long sigh. He opened his eyes, but kept his gaze up at the heavens, half willing them to open up and rain down on them to wash away their sins.
“Right. Good. Can you tell me five red things you see?”
Draco looked up at Harry with a frown. Harry, however, seemed equally perplexed. He pushed his glasses up his crooked nose and leaned closer to Teddy. “Run that by us one more time,” he said. “What do you mean, feel like a boy and a girl?”
“And of course, only the best for Malfoy,” said Harry with a crooked smile. Malfoy nodded.
“Oh yes,” he said. “I’ve been studying you for weeks now and I could only come to one conclusion – you are hopelessly in love with me.” He laughed as Harry slapped him – gently – on the shoulder, but when he turned his head back to Harry, his expression was no longer indecipherable. Soft and sweet, he looked at Harry as if he was offering him the world with both hands. “I only knew because I know the symptoms,” Draco said, his voice quiet in the still summer air. “Because I’ve been in love with you for years, since the day I met you.”
“I don’t know if I’ve ever heard you use my first name before,” he said. Harry blushed, and muttered into his glass, “that you know of.” Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up, and Harry realised that he must have heard him. Harry set his glass down on the mantle and strode forward to kneel in front of Malfoy. Tentatively, he took Malfoy’s glass from him and set it on the side table before taking Malfoy’s hands in his.
“We should go to Dumbledore.”
“Why did you come?” Harry asked, his voice hoarse.
She wiggled her hips and looked over her shoulder. “Nope,” she said, “just shut you up.” She cackled when Draco made a rude gesture in her direction and shut the door behind her.
“Uncle Draco?”
Draco gasped. He licked his lips, his eyes searching Harry’s face. “I – I thought…” He trailed off. One of his hands came up, fluttering near Harry’s cheek, wanting but afraid to touch. He swallowed, Adam’s apple bobbing as he tried again to form the words. “I didn’t realise you liked me,” he whispered. Harry frowned.
Harry laughed and tugged Draco along so that they could free up the fireplace for the next guest.
but since he had even seen Harry. Surely after all this time…
Harry looked up in surprise. He pushed up his glasses, a nervous habit Draco had noticed over the past week. “Why do you ask?”
A couple hours later, after he had showered and breakfasted, Kellen arrived in a swirl of green flames into Harry’s kitchen.
“That does not sound very encouraging.”
“Are you trying to climb me?” he asked, smiling against Harry’s mouth. Harry scowled.
Harry didn’t need any more encouragement after that. He leaned in for a chaste kiss, but Draco was having none of it. The hand holding Harry’s jaw slipped into his hair, thick and coarse between his fingers, while his other hand slipped around to press against his low back, pulling Harry flush against him. Harry gasped against Draco’s mouth. Draco eagerly licked at his lower lip, a question answered by Harry’s moan. Then it was Harry licking into Draco’s mouth, his hands roving over Draco’s body, pulling at Draco’s silky fine hair, palming along his side, desperately searching for more. Their kiss wasn’t just hungry, it was starving, as if they had never eaten before that night only to be given a feast.
Ron slammed his plate down on the table, making both Harry and Hermione jump. “What the bloody hell are you thinking?” he demanded. He braced his hands on his hips. In that moment, Harry could see him as a father to the baby growing in Hermione’s belly so easily that he thought someone had spun a Time Turner and landed him in the future. But no – Hermione was still pregnant, and Ron was pinning him down with a confused but furious glare.
with her. But he never stopped thinking about you.” Tears were streaming down his cheeks now, and he tried to wipe them away without dislodging his glasses. “Never. He cared about you, Draco, now and always. So when I say I love you, I mean it, from both of us. I love you.”
Draco’s scowl deepened as he returned to glaring at the fire. “Potter,” he mumbled. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Blaise roll his eyes. The other boy muttered something that sounded suspiciously like, “Of course.”
“What, no, of course not,” Draco spluttered. He turned fully in his desk chair to obstruct Harry’s view even as Harry tried to peer around him. “How is she? Hermione?”
“I’m sorry it took so long for me to come find you,” Draco replied.
Potter raised his eyebrows, but nodded all the same. Draco led him down though the grounds to a little-known side gate amongst the hedgerows. Only when they were on the towpath, fields rolling golden on one side, trees rustling their empty branches above them, did Draco speak.
“What?”
“No, you idiot. You are a good man. Thank you.”
“Merlin, Potter, knock next time,” Draco swore.
“The last one’s new,” Ron joked with a grin. Hermione elbowed him in the ribs, but even she was hiding a smirk. Harry rolled his eyes and shook his head.
Ron scoffed as he crossed his arms. “I doubt it, but fine. Why bring the git, then?”
Harry sobered his expression and nodded solemnly. “Yes, well, we do live with each other, so we get along just fine, you could say.”
It was a long time before they broke apart. Their breathing was ragged as they leaned their foreheads together, both trying to get their racing hearts under control. Draco left one last kiss on the top of Harry’s head before he stepped away. Harry reached for him, but Draco shook his head, biting back the tears that threatened in his stormy eyes as he backed away.
“Know what?” A prickle of unease ran down Draco’s spine at the shadows in Harry’s eyes. He recognised the emotions that flashed there – embarrassment, shame, fear, pain. They were the same emotions he felt when he looked at his Mark, even beneath the tattoos he had gotten to cover it.
“You can’t believe that,” said Harry. “Come on, Draco, we can figure this out!”
Harry jogged up to his side. With a sigh, Draco slowed his pace and allowed him to fall into step beside him. They walked in silence for a few breaths, both flushed and unable to look each other in the eye.
Hermione bit her lip, looking away, her eyes calculating.
His words dislodged a question in Draco’s brain that he’d been meaning to ask.
He had become so cautious about not changing in front of Justin in their room, that he was sure he was developing a complex. While Justin was constantly dancing around the dorm room half dressed, Draco only changed in the bathroom, in a shower stall.
Potter closed his eyes, his expression downcast.
“I would be, but her sister caught us and she got spooked and ran off.”
“It doesn’t matter what he said. By now you should have the emotional maturity to rise above what other people say,” McGonagall rebuked him.
Justin was over by the record player talking to Sally-Anne Perks, when Potter went over and slung an arm around the smaller boys shoulders, pulling him away from his conversation and over to the stack of records. They seemed to be arguing about music choices. Justin never talked about Potter, and Draco had no idea if anything had happened beyond their train hook up.
“Isn’t that what you just did?” Draco said stiffly.
Finch-Fletchley looked a lot more serious, and came to sit next to Draco.
“I’ll stay away from Potter if you admit that you’re jealous.”
Draco stared at him, a little taken aback.
He couldn’t though. He had plans with Potter after all. The brand on his arm stopped him too. He didn’t deserve the kindness of Justin’s family after everything he had been a part of. If his side had won the war, Justin’s life would have been ruined forever. He couldn’t bare to look his parents in the eyes knowing that.
Hermione seemed to know he wasn’t done though, because she wordlessly kept pace with him when they left the classroom.
He hadn’t even known that his mother had left the country.
MacMillan was a large, imposing boy. He was almost as tall as Draco, but much wider. He had a plump face and short dirty blonde hair. His eyes were a washed out blue and far apart which made him look a little vague, but Draco knew that was not the case. His excellent marks and past status as a Prefect notwithstanding, Draco knew MacMillan had been heavily involved in the student rebellion with Dumbledore's Army the previous year, and he’d been savvy enough to nearly be completely overlooked. It dawned on Draco then that the reason Finch-Fletchley had been more accepting of his presence was because he’d been absent for the pervious year. He hadn’t been there to witness first hand just how wide the divide between Slytherin and the rest of the student body had become. It had been naive of Draco to even hope that the other students would treat him with anything less than open hostility.
“Of course I like Justin, everybody likes Justin. We really should have gotten an emotional support Hufflepuff years ago.”
He slid his arms around her, the familiarity of her affection and the scent of her shampoo grounding him.
“There’s quite a gathering waiting to see how long they’ll be in there. I really don’t see what the fuss is about, but the way everyone is going on about it, he’s really put the kneazle amongst the pixies now. Their perfect poster boy just discarded his picket fence future to out himself.”
“I’m taking YOU to bed so you can SLEEP,” Draco huffed, forcing Potter through his bedroom door.
Draco shared a grin with Justin, before they both went back to watching the snow in mesmerised silence.
“Soooo, what are your plans for after Hogwarts Malfoy?” he asked casually.
“I prefer tea,” Potter sniffed, and Draco rolled his eyes.
A fight had broken out between two mean looking Ravenclaws and Potter, who had just been thrown backwards into one of the bookcases. It toppled and books came pouring off the shelves, raining down on a group of screaming girls who dived out of the way. Draco groaned.
Draco went back to his coffee, while Blaise shook out the newspaper.
Draco snuck into the quiet bedroom, holding his shoes in one hand. He could just make out the tangle of black hair poking out from under the covers. He set the shoes down by the door and began undressing as quickly and stealthily as he could. He slipped into the bed, wearing nothing but his pants, settling in behind the sleeping man. Harry whined.
“Blaise, dear, let Draco out, there’s someone he wants to see.”
“Really? Didn’t have anything to do with my great athletic talent?”
Silence fell again, but this time, Harry could practically feel the arctic chill that had descended inside. Then, one of the other boys said,
“Harry, dear,” Hermione whispered with a sigh, looking up from one of the massive tomes she had scattered around her. “I love you, you know that, but sometimes you can be so dense. You probably said something without realising it hurt him, and the best thing to do is just apologise.”
MY SIDE, PRAT’S SIDE
“I know,” he said again. “But that’s why you like me, right?”
Draco shrugged. He couldn’t bring himself to look the priest in the eye. He reminded him too much of someone else. Someone with bright green eyes and sun-kissed skin.
Draco’s glower grew murderous. Pansy ignored him.
“Are we going now?” he asked, pushing his wet hair out of his face. Andromeda rested her head on Harry’s shoulder.
Teddy remained unconvinced, not looking up from his knees. Harry got up and pulled his godson into a hug. Teddy leaned his head against Harry’s chest, his narrow shoulders shaking as he held back his sobs. Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco as if to say, ‘get over here, you git, your godson needs you.’ Draco rolled his eyes back, letting him know, ‘I’m getting there, I’m getting there, Merlin’s balls, just give me a second,’ before getting up himself and putting his arms around both Teddy and Harry. He rested his cheek against Teddy’s trembling shoulder as he murmured, “It’s okay, we love you, it’s okay.”
The old Black house had undergone major redecoration since Harry had moved in – gone was the dusty four-poster bed, the heavy velvet curtains, the peeling wallpaper. Instead, the room was painted a deep blue, the mahogany framed queen bed taking centre stage with its heather grey sheets, lit primarily by the tall window opposite the door. Draco only had a moment to take a look around before Harry pulled him back in, kissing him slow and deep. Nonetheless, he let Draco dictate the pace.
“No, I’m sorry, please just send Kellen through, it’s urgent.” His gut twisted at the thought of Ron helping with bringing his own brother in – no, he and the Weasleys had been through enough, and now…
“I’m his Godfather,” Potter explained.
He covered his face with his free hand, the backs of his eyes were getting hot and he choked back a sob.
“Oh well then, nothing at all. It’s all been very peaceful,” she shot back, laughing bitterly.
She flipped him off without raising her head.
In this chapter there is drinking, homophobic language and some violence... you know, like any party!
He looked up at her quickly, surprised by the offer. He had a particular interest in medical potions.
“Ergh OK,” Draco growled, “I don’t like it. I can’t control everybody else, but you’re one of my best friends. You should take pity on me.”
He weaved across the common room, dancing around people and sliding through gaps in the crowd. He spotted Luna and Girl Weasley dancing together, pressed close by the crush of people around them, and he grinned happily.
Draco reached out and gripped Potter’s arm desperately.
“Good morning Draco,” said Luna brightly when she reached the table. “Mind if I join your for breakfast?”
“Every time I see you I’m apologising,” Potter continued sheepishly. He looked Draco up and down, his expression softening.
“It’s my choice if I want to tell him,” he guessed that was Lovegood. He was surprised, he hadn’t realised she was still here.
“Never mind your questions Miss Weasley. Mr Malfoy needs medical attention,” the Matron interjected, for which Draco was immediately relieved.
“What’s that supposed to mean Malfoy?” Potter asked sharply, and Draco looked up in surprise.
“Good morning Longbottom! Malfoy and I are off for breakfast, see you down there.”
“Uh huh,” she didn’t look convinced.
Draco still didn’t know his mother’s opinion on everything that had happened.
“What’s this one for?” he asked, buying time.
“Oot for a lovely drink wit a Death Eater are we,” the man continued, his voice a mean mockery of cheer, “Well I dinnae think ye could stoop any lower after I read all aboot yer recent perverted life choices in the paper, but here ye are.”
Potter huffed, running a hand through his hair. It was getting longer on top, the silky black tufts sticking straight up in places.
The note he had received that morning felt heavy in his pocket. It was the first time his mother had replied to any of his letters this year. After telling her that he couldn’t come home for Christmas, Ulysses had proudly returned with a sealed envelope, and Draco had recognised Narcissa Malfoy’s customised stationery immediately. He’d felt a hopeful flutter in his stomach, before he’d opened the letter to see one single line, written in his mother’s impeccable calligraphy:
He was backed up by two Ravenclaw seventh years, but they hadn’t done anything but watch since they’d got Draco cornered. He’d been trying to take a shortcut to the library, thinking about an independent project he wanted to start in Potions. He was deciding which books he might need to begin his research, when he’d ducked behind a tapestry to take some back stairs down to the first floor, and there they were.
“When you’re feelin’ sad and low...” he sang along with the girls.
“What about our marriage of convenience to appease our homophobic families? Shall I cancel the caterer?”
Not many of the younger students came into the restaurant. It was mainly frequented by the residents of Hogsmeade, and some of the older Hogwarts students. Draco had only been here a handful of times before with Pansy, who liked to take a late lunch, gossip, and complain that the food was nowhere near as good as it was in Paris. Monsieur Scintille both adored and despised Pansy, and they’d had many arguments about the menu in loud, rapid French.
“... Fuck off!” echoed Pansy, still fast asleep.
Barely a moment had past since the fight began, before Finnigan, Weasley, and MacMillan all came barrelling through the crowd. They dragged the grappling boys apart. Finnigan had both arms around Potter’s torso, holding him back. Draco could see him talking quickly into Potter’s ear, as Weasley and MacMillan manhandled the Ravenclaws across the party and out of sight down the common room stairs.
Justin bounced onto his bed as he hollered, “Colours of the world!”
I’m sure you’re all anxious to get a good nights sleep ready for your classes tomorrow. You are all free to go, except Eighth years? Could you please remain in your seats for a moment longer. I wish to speak to you further.”
“Of course Malfoy, good to see you too old boy.”
“Yes, my foot is facing the correct way again thankfully,” he answered, before glancing away. “You didn’t have to stick around, Lovegood, you probably have much better things you could be doing.”
“You can speak French?” he asked, his voice a little hoarse.
Thomas, Weasley, Longbottom, Blaise, Tracey, and Pansy all drank.
Draco couldn’t imagine Justin having “strong words" with anyone and he smirked.
He heard Granger sniffling.
Granger looked up in surprise, taking in the two blondes towering over her.
Potter snorted.
“If they didn’t tell you about it, then it really isn’t,” said Thomas.
He shrugged.
Potter sauntered in with his hands in his pockets, as though the whole school hadn’t just heard him have a screaming match with his best friend. He glanced around, the ring through his eyebrow glinting. He didn’t head towards the eighth year table, but instead made a beeline for the Ravenclaw table. He sat down next to the Lovegood girl, bowing his head to speak to her. After a moment he slumped against her, his head on her shoulder, and she patted his hair like he was an oversized puppy.
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him suspiciously.
“I thought Harry and Ron would look after each other,” she continued, sniffing, “but by the time I got home everything had fallen apart. I shouldn’t have left.”
“You? Too dramatic? Don’t be ridiculous,” he poked her with his foot.
Draco sighed and scrubbed a hand over his face, clearing the sleep from his eyes.
“Are you sure my father was telling the truth?”
“You don’t understand! It’s like someone has thrown a broken possessed chainsaw down a well full of cats on fire!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Granger looked upset.
He stood alone in a bubble of calm, even in the crowds of the platform, and Draco wasn’t sure if the wide berth people were giving him was out of respect or something else. Potter had changed dramatically from the battle stained boy Draco had last seen. Potter looked, for want of a better word... dangerous.
Potter laughed again, lighter this time, and more genuine.
Now Justin understood the goal, he began to rifle through Draco’s wardrobe too. He held up shirts, before tossing them aside.
Weasley folded his arms. Potter pulled out his cigarette pack, stuck one between his lips, and lit it with the tip of his wand.
“It’s up to you what you do obviously, but you’ll never know if you don’t give it a shot.”
