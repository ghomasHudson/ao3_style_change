Harry bit his lip. He had a few answers to this question. The first, most automatic answer, was a resounding NO, and it came with a lot of outrage and embarrassment. Another was a YES that was flavoured with the reasonable fear of falling over. The third was a YES because Malfoy had very nice arms and Harry wouldn't mind holding on to one of them. Yesses won out.
He couldn’t face the Great Hall so he had the house elves bring him his meals in his chambers, and because he was a pathetic, hypocritical fool, he wished he and Malfoy weren’t fighting so that Malfoy would come and check on him. There was something steadying about his presence, something grounding, and Harry could have used that solidity. When his pain was this bad it made him feel half-severed from the world, like he existed somehow outside of it, outside of everyone he knew, outside of even himself.
The new cane made getting around so much easier that Harry regretted every single day he’d gone without it. He had not, however, anticipated the enormous fuss that using the cane would engender.
Harry was, in fact, wavering badly on his feet, and he propped his good hip against a stool, not willing to sit completely for fear he’d be stuck. The Patronus, which usually came so naturally to him, was slow to appear and when it did, the normally solid-looking stag was flickering like an old film. He banished it impatiently and re-focused until he’d conjured another that was much more up to snuff, then hastily recorded a message to Nimpkins and sent it galloping away.
"Yes," Malfoy said. His voice was steady. "I won't lie. That started it. But I also began to wake up, to grow up. I looked around and realized that everyone I knew -- everyone I loved, even -- was miserable and afraid. That's what hate does to people, it keeps them unhappy and terrified. If it had been you, that day with the fiend's fire... I wouldn't have saved you. I would've let you die."
"Relax, Potter, I didn't mean to disparage her. I've been following her career, for obvious reasons, and I've been quite impressed with some of the legislation she's written. You must be proud."
Normally, to get to the Great Hall, he took a specific set of winding wooden stairs that were valuable both for their sturdy railings and for the fact that almost no one else seemed to know about them, so it was less likely he'd humiliate himself in front of someone, especially a student. He felt that seeing your Defense Against the Dark Arts professor unable to Defend Against the Dark Stairs would make it hard to take him seriously.
It was a proper basement, cement walls, bare bulbs, but it was lit by hundreds of dripping candles, which the people crowded inside were trying to avoid. There were about a dozen of them, some in robes and some in casual Muggle garb, and Harry didn’t recognize anyone. They’d been chatting to one another when he’d come in, as if there wasn’t a half-naked beat-up man tied up in their midst, and they didn’t fully stop when Harry entered, though there was an ebb to the noise as they noticed him. They were all adults, he noticed, save for one person, a blond, spotty teenage girl in an extremely frothy white dress, who was standing near Draco’s chair and looking very nervous.
Harry felt his nostrils flare, and he clenched his jaw, both hands curling into fists. He'd had lots of truly shite days in his thirty-one years, but this one was really a contender for a top slot. "I asked Hanna to get Neville."
"Ha, ha. Let's see -- I have an American bourbon aged in unicorn horns; a Muggle scotch from Japan; and a local catnip whiskey, which is much nicer than it sounds."
"He's been living in France, hasn't he?" Hermione said. "I met a French Healer at a meeting last week who spoke so highly of him I had to repeat his name a few times to make sure we were talking of the same person."
Harry could not have been more surprised if she'd suddenly turned into a Hippogriff and flown away. "You've got to be joking." Oh, but it was all making sense, their stupid questions, the way they'd gone batty when he and Malfoy had spoken in the Great Hall... "Hanna," he said. "Er -- do me a favor, and tell them we're not?"
"Not about -- what happened to you on the stairs, but yeah, they know you've come to teach here and they know Hogwarts has a hundred staircases --"
been a prat; but he’d been a prat because he was – well, he was frightened. The way he felt about Draco… it did not feel casual. Couldn’t be casual, not with their history, not with the fact that they’d known each other twenty bloody years, and that was an intimidating thing to confront.
The day of the first Hogsmeade weekend was not exactly the bright, cheery morning that one might have hoped. It was grey and drizzling slightly and the grounds were slick with mud. This did absolutely nothing to dampen the students' excitement, especially the third years, for whom it was their first first visit -- and who were a particularly loud and excitable bunch anyway.
Malfoy released the bad arm and came around to Harry's good right side, and Harry let him take some of the weight from his bad leg. Good leg, bad leg, good arm, bad arm, who made these moralistic judgments on innocent limbs?
"I remembered pretty quickly after that," Malfoy said, still giggling, "and then -- then you woke up."
“Well, Evie will be able to heal that soon enough!” Lizzie turned over her shoulder to beam at him. They were in the kitchen now, a big, bright affair with lots of stainless steel, and Lizzie was marching directly across it and putting her hand on a door in the far corner. A pantry, Harry thought for a moment, but she opened it to reveal a set of stairs and a whiff of damp air, and the truth became horribly clear.
you. But anger was so familiar and easy – so much easier than any of the other feelings he might admit to.
“I didn’t even do that much,” Harry protested. “Just some walking around. And – well, a bit of fighting, but hardly any!”
Neville cleared his throat and did a fair approximation of Malfoy’s upper class drawl. “I won’t make it by ten – let’s say eleven? The Ragged Pony will do. Enclosed is the deposit you requested; I’ll pay the rest as soon as I’ve got the venom in hand. Thanks much. DM.”
“Excellent,” Harry said, finally feeling secure enough to reach for his cane again and slot his wand away. “Could I side-along with you?”
Harry let Malfoy manipulate his leg to his liking then gently cast the charm. It was better than Harry's own, he realized -- there was something warm and cushiony about it, where Harry's Locking charm felt like he'd strapped his knee to a piece of wood.
“I’ll keep an eye on him,” Draco said blandly, and put a careful hand on Harry’s back to guide him towards the fireplace. In a much quieter voice, as they picked their way across the pink rug, he said, “Are you sure you’re up for this?”
The most powerful wizard of his generation: ha! What use was power if he couldn't use it, couldn't control it? The last time he'd been this desperate, in pain, without his wand, he'd cracked something inside himself and exploded three people so completely that there'd been nothing left of them but teeth. He'd felt it before, the raw crackle of magic with no outlet, the kind of magic that only wizard children possessed and that everyone else grew out of, but Harry never quite had. Uncontrolled; dangerous. Dark. He could feel it in him now, roiling like the curse in his joints, and he was afraid.
“Oh, thanks,” Harry told it, and it hooted once before flapping away again. He lowered it into his lap and wedged it under his bad hand so he could tear open the flap, then read it quickly – and again, more slowly.
The smile was wiped off his face, however, when he saw the group of students clustered at the end of the bridge. It was Jacob and his third-year army. They had textbooks and parchment out and seemed to be studying in the fresh air, and he hoped maybe they’d be so serious and concentrated that they wouldn’t pay any mind to Harry and Malfoy passing through their little group – but this hope was dashed almost immediately. Jacob glanced up and saw them coming, and urgently began speaking to his friends. Even from nearly twenty feet away Harry could see them all look up like hunting dogs on the scent.
She took out her wand and accio'd a notebook and pen -- not a quill, he noticed -- and sat into a chair across from him. "Mind if I ask you a few questions? Other than the few questions I just asked you!"
"Excellent," Harry echoed. As Malfoy neared, Harry saw he had a tiny, winking diamond stud in one of his delicate nostrils, and for some reason this seemed the biggest change from Hogwarts as Harry had known it.
Harry squinted across the room, trying to figure out if he could break the locks without getting back to his feet, but he couldn’t suss them out from this distance so he pushed himself up again and made his way to where Neville was standing. He’d forgotten, in his first rush of panic over Malfoy, that this was Not a Good Day, but, as a friendly reminder, his knee was starting to tremble a little beneath him. He transferred all his weight to his good leg so he could let go of his cane and crack the wards on the filing cabinet, then leaned against the wall as Neville began opening drawers.
"I very much doubt that," Draco said. He was still gripping Harry's arm, as if worried -- or reluctant -- to let him go. "Well," he said, "I--"
Harry didn’t know how to answer that. He felt almost nothing except a deep, deep fatigue. Fatigue from the constant unreliability of his body, and fatigue from being looked at all the time, watched, scrutinized, questioned.
"Bravo, Professor!" roared the same boy in the back, and Harry decided to get very, very drunk that night.
up for this?” Harry said, suddenly worried. “You’ve had a worse day than I have and they’re going to ask you to relive it for your statement. I know what it’s like, to – to be tied up like that, and –”
"We used to go to these Muggle counseling sessions together," Malfoy said. He had a thin gold ring on his thumb that he was clanking nervously against his glass. "For people who'd grown up in -- in what the Muggles call hate groups. A lot of the people there were from very extreme religious organizations and the like, and Blaise and I mostly just listened. But it was good to be around people who... understood how deep such an upbringing goes. People who didn't spit on me when they saw the Dark Mark. Not," Malfoy said hastily, "that I'm asking for sympathy about that. Spit is far better than what most Death Eaters did to people they disagreed with."
Just a short one! It's schooltime now and oy, what a time suck, but the next chapter will be much longer. And happier haha.
"But then you wouldn't be able to come," Harry said. Then hastened to add, "I'd feel badly seeing your friend if you couldn't see her, too."
The Floo spit him in out in an old-fashioned fireplace in a hotel room that looked like it hadn’t been used for a century, save for a clean path in the dust leading from the Floo to the door. There was furniture but it was all covered with sheets, and the window had been boarded up save for a tiny sliver at the top, so the light inside was murky and grey. Harry moved forward carefully, wary as always of unknown spaces, wondering how exactly he was supposed to get
“Anything with a bit of spice to it,” Draco said. “Sometimes I think the Hogwarts house elves have never heard of pepper.”
“I don’t care what you did to them,” Negasi said fiercely. “I hope there’s a hell so they can rot in it. I just keep thinking… if it had been one of us, and
McGonagall had taken a step back, one hand going to her chest, and Harry realized he'd been yelling.
"And this ugly, messy black wig," said a very freckled boy. "Your real hair is much nicer, Professor."
And float he did, stretched out on his back, limbs loose, watching the clouds, feeling cool and light and cradled. Malfoy swam out, out, out, then back; out, out, out, then back. It was rare for Harry to watch this kind of physical prowess without feeling jealous, but for some reason, when he watched Malfoy he only felt content. Why had he not been swimming this whole time? What had he been thinking, sitting beside the lake but never getting into it? Soon it would be too cold. Harry had wasted so much time.
A moment later, Malfoy was laughing harder than Harry'd ever seen him do. "Of course," he gasped, "of course this is your idea of fun!"
A moment later, Harry's knee buckled. Malfoy caught him in surprisingly strong arms, holding him for long enough to right him, then reinstated the charm.
Harry couldn’t answer. He was suddenly so exhausted he couldn’t even find it in himself to lift his wand, and he sat there with a lapful of potatoes and chicken, trying to gather the energy to clean the mess and make a joke and get through the rest of the evening like a human being, but the energy wasn’t coming.
," she said, tossing her head as if her hair were more than an inch long, which it wasn't. "About... well, it started with the Floo network, don't ask me
Malfoy waited patiently to see if there was more, then said, "Do you want to yell about other invented slights? Or will you answer the question?"
"Here, put out your leg, I'll do it. Bend it just a bit, it'll feel better when you take the charm off later. Yes, like that."
“Ah,” said Negasi, as his spell flew up through the floorboards and paused above his wand. He and Harry both gaped at it.
“I hope so,” Harry said. “I don’t mind if everyone thinks I’m mad and paranoid, so long as Draco’s all right.”
“He’s fine,” Negasi said, “he’s – Harry, stop, lie down! Oh, bugger, someone go get – stop moving, damn it!”
“Give it to me,” Harry repeated. He put steel into his voice and although he was aware of other people’s eyes on them, he didn’t break his gaze from Malfoy’s. After a moment, Malfoy shrugged minutely and gave Harry that treacherously lovely envelope. Harry nodded and stowed it in his bag and Malfoy left, shoulders slightly hunched and squared against the stares of his students.
"Would it help if I talked to her, do you think?" Harry said. "If I -- Merlin, I don't know. If I tell her I don't blame her, I'm not angry with her?"
“Yeah, haha, definitely not. But don’t think I’ll forget you promised to come visit when Mona’s back in town. I already owled her and said I had a surprise, so you can’t go back on your word!”
“I don’t think so, no,” said Harry, and was saved from further awkwardness by Negasi’s reappearance, clattering down the side stairs.
"-- A hundred forty two staircases, and they got a few interviews with students saying they've seen how difficult it is for you, and --"
“And nice – what would one even call that monstrosity you’re wearing?” Draco plucked at Harry’s pink sleeve.
With Kevari’s assistance and a bit of swearing, Harry managed, finally, to get himself upright against the arm of the couch, and downed the Barley-thorn in one long gulp. Almost immediately, his sight began to blur and double -- but the relief was immediate, too, and he let out an involuntary sigh as his cramped hand began to relax, his fingers loosening from their tight curl, his shoulder unfreezing. His hip, which had been playing the part of a piece of wood, began to feel like a body part again, and his knee stopped feeling quite so much like a cup of hot lava.
There was a polite pause, and then replacement peas, mashed potatoes and gravy appeared on the table. Harry swallowed, raised his wand again, and sent the peas floating down the table to Malfoy -- as he should've done in the first place. He'd been too busy panicking about his arm to remember that he was a wizard.
"Oh," Hermione said, wringing her hands, "all right, I'm sorry. The students are lucky, Harry, I know you'll be brilliant."
Was it nice because he’d enjoyed the company, or just because it was a change from the Great Hall? Was he holding the door because it was a date-like thing to do, or because he was worried Harry did actually need the door held?
"Malfoy," Harry said. He leaned forward, good elbow on good knee. "Is there something I should know?"
"Had to run to the office but she'll be here shortly. Let's get you sitting down so you can hold this baby and I can fetch you a drink." Ron turned to the fellow at the next table. "Oy, give us your chair, would you?"
"Did I tell you what Ginny made me for dinner when I visited her in Oslo? While she was reporting on the Cup?"
Her eyes filled with tears and she hung her head, clearly trying not to cry. "You wouldn't be mad at me?" she said. "If I were sad about him?"
Harry looked down at himself. He’d forgotten he was wearing Hermione’s pink fleece, and he laughed. “It’s the Minister’s.”
“It’s your own health,” Kevari said. “And as Auror Roberts so astutely pointed out, you’re a grown man. No one can stop you doing foolish things.”
"Several ingredients have gone missing from my cupboards, including a highly narcotic and rigidly restricted form of Daddy Longlegs venom. I'm also missing sixty valuable diamond-plated vials that the school generously ordered for me to advance my own research."
“Bossy,” Draco said, but he did as he was told. Finally, his lips – those beautiful, sneering, perfect lips – touched Harry’s; gently at first, a careful warm press of skin on skin, but when Harry reached up to fist his good hand in Draco’s stupid sweatshirt to pull him closer, Draco deepened the kiss, his lips parting, tongue sweeping in to meet Harry’s, so hot and messy and good that Harry’s back arched of its own accord. Pain lanced through him but it mingled with the pleasure he felt at Draco’s touch and he didn’t mind, only tilted his head to get a better angle, wrapping his good arm around Draco’s neck and pulling him half on top of his own body, desperate for more contact as Draco sucked Harry’s lower lip into his mouth and bit down, hand tangling in Harry’s hair, lips on the stubble at his jaw, below his ear, down his neck, and –
"No," Harry agreed. "But -- it's okay to love him anyway, and to be sad he's gone. If it were my dad, I'd be very sad, no matter what."
Harry was distracted -- he'd strayed to a bookshelf and discovered a stack of antique magazines, their photos moving in that blurry, disjointed fashion old photos had, and they were unequivocally a 1920s version of gay pornography. He was absolutely too horny to handle looking at the photos for any longer than necessary, and too horny, also, to fully process the implications -- which seemed to decisively point, once and for all, to the fact that Malfoy was, indeed, interested in blokes.
“There are still three class periods left today,” McGonagall protested, and then, seeing his face, added very hastily, “which I will cover for you myself.”
"I had a group of students wanting to know how many Floos there are in the castle, total," she said. "It's a matter of public record, so I told them: Eleven."
"Holly?" she said. "About eleven inches? Ugh I love how you guys just randomly use inches for shit like wands and submarine sandwiches and then you're right back to centimeters like nothing happened."
"Hello, darlings!" she said. "Oh, Harry, it's lovely to see you! You're looking thin, aren't they feeding you?"
"You're bothering him, too," said Ron. "And in point of fact, 'Mione, you could do with a day of sitting about, as well. Harry's not the only one looking a bit ragged." He ducked, laughing, as Hermione threw a spoon at him. "Why don't you two working stiffs get comfortable in the living room, and I'll make breakfast before the baby's up from her nap."
Quite a long time later, maybe an hour, maybe two, maybe no more than ten minutes, Harry got his good arm beneath him and managed to sit up, dragging his stiff leg as he propped himself up against the wall. His hands were trembling uncontrollably from the pain but he managed to pat himself down and make sure nothing -- else -- had broken, which thank Merlin, it had not. All his working limbs were still working. All his non-functional limbs were still non-functional. His head was intact, his glasses were still on his face. To his deep shame, he'd only fallen about two steps.
“Yeah, I’ll be fine,” Harry said, and glanced guiltily at Kevari, feeling like he was betraying him. The Healer tossed up his hands, looking exasperated but not angry.
“I’m all right,” Harry said immediately, but even to his ears the lie rang false. Despite his best efforts at denial he was beginning to accept the fact that he was working under a dual timeframe: not only was he desperate to find Draco before anything irrevocable happened, but he was struggling against the ticking clock of his own body, whose hour hand was nearing closer and closer to midnight. He could feel it trying to shut down and this enraged him as much as it scared him. After all they’d been through together, he and his body, this could not be the moment their teamwork dissolved.
Malfoy grabbed his shoulder, the bad one, and Harry didn't feel a thing. "Potter, what don't you understand? The way you move will still have consequences on your body. I imagine you've wreaked enough havoc on it with whatever sludge you brewed up the other night, if you don't slow down you'll be recovering in bed for days, and I know you don't want that."
Phil turned out to be very tall and broad when he stood up and clomped over to look. “Hmm,” he said. “Oy, Craig. Take a look at this photo. You know this guy?”
“Right, that.” Draco nearly smiled. “I was… there were times I was frightened. But I kept calm, for the most part, because I hoped – not just hoped, but really believed – that you’d come for me. Not because you’re Harry Potter, but because you’re you.” He cleared his throat. “So what I meant to say, what I
“Yes, well, Draco shouldn’t do my job for me, but he’s right,” said Kevari. “Your shoulder affects your back and neck and we don’t want to let that get too bad, or you’ll really be in trouble down the road. I see you’ve used a Locking charm on your knee recently, do you do that often?”
“Yes,” said Harry, who’d been listening intently. He hadn’t expected the extra charmwork and he was both impressed with her skill and grateful for her foresight. She’d anticipated problems that hadn’t occurred to him.
Abigail relaxed and went back to smiling at him. “Oh good. Lizzie did promise Dougie would be the only Muggle, and he’s practically one of us, by this point.”
But he refused to get his hopes up. If the wand-function didn’t work, it wouldn’t matter how nice the cane itself was.
“I know,” Abigail said, leaning closer. “We’ll make history.” She touched his arm and he realized with a jolt that she was
“I did a preliminary examination,” Draco repeated, color high in his cheeks, “while he was unconscious, just to make sure nothing was broken. Or about to kill him, which I’m pleased to report nothing is – not internally, at any rate. If you wish, I’ll share the initial diagnostic.”
"How would you know?" Ron said, handing her an enormous plateful of eggs and sausage and pancakes. "We haven't been to a bloody show in ages. All we do anymore is stare at Rosie. Sit up, Harry, you'll choke if you try and eat like that."
Harry nodded grimly and took a deep breath. He stepped forward, then glanced back over his shoulder. Neville and Malfoy both made encouraging faces. He gripped the doorknob. He opened the door.
Malfoy looked genuinely pleased, even allowing himself a small smile, no hint of a sneer. "I'm glad it's worked out so far. I'll fiddle with it and try to find out what's inducing the narcolepsy, it might be the poppy..."
He ate his lunch mechanically, without making conversation, and though he did feel a bit better after he'd gotten some food down, he was counting the hours until his last class when he could take dinner in his chambers and not talk to anyone until the next morning. He did manage a, "Sorry, Neville, bit of a grump today," as Neville stood to leave, and was rewarded with a smile and a pat on the arm. Neville was blessedly difficult to offend.
“Good call,” Harry said. “I will, thanks.” He was grateful Neville had held back from fussing. “I feel all right for now,” he lied.
“You do need bed rest,” Kevari went on, “but not a week of it, I don’t think. A few hours a day should have you on the road to recovery. And lots of heat, as much of it as you can stand. Baths, hot compresses, warming charms… Your curse loves the cold, let’s not feed it. My main concern is your shoulder – did you hit it today?”
“Not really my concern at the moment,” Harry said. “But the doors’ll stay sealed the rest of the day and we can send a clean-up crew by nightfall.”
"I know this sounds quite unbelievable," Harry said. "You know me, I was ready to hate him as much as I ever had, but... I really do think he's done a lot to try and... change. He's broken with almost everyone in his past."
"Yes. If you're looking for exact numbers, for a -- a project, or something, the Headmistress may be able to tell you."
Malfoy gave him a rigid, courtly little bow that might've been mocking or might've just been part of Malfoy's wealthy, inbred, horrid upbringing, or maybe it was just Malfoy, oddly formal, oddly gracious, totally infuriating. He sank down onto the bench and watched Malfoy walk away, and noticed too late he wasn't the only one watching: there was a gaggle of sixth-year girls staring and giggling and whispering behind their hands. Probably incoherent from the sight of their handsome Potions professor in swim trunks. They were looking at Harry, too, and he gave them a tired little wave that set them all giggling again.
He grinned as he stepped through into his bedroom. Now, this was more like it. It looked almost exactly like the room he'd shared with Ron in Gryffindor, except with its own private bath and one bed in place of four. A bed which looked so comfortable Harry couldn't help but sit down with a groan of relief. He took out his wand and lowered the trunk to the floor, then flicked it open and accio'd one of his remaining pain potions, downing it in one go despite the atrocious flavor -- and despite the fact that he was supposed to take it with food. Well, it would be fine if he ate within the hour, and dinner was right around the corner.
McGonagall stopped in a quiet corner of the sixth floor and took out a key ring much bigger than was demanded by the two tiny brass keys hanging from it, and handed it ceremoniously to Harry.
“Lumos,” she said immediately. “I remember my sister coming home from Hogwarts and lighting up our bedroom late at night, and I was so jealous I could barely think.”
The new customer, a young woman with a Holyhead Harpies t-shirt and lots of very glittery jewelry, was starting to look impatient, so Draco and Harry took their leave and went back out into the crisp fall evening.
“I sent a Patronus to Ronald Weasley and to McGonagall while I was in the kitchen,” said Draco. “We’ll apparate to the Brighton Floo and then Floo to the Weasley-Granger cottage in Hogsmeade, then take a carriage back to the castle.”
Ron winced. "Hang on, darling!" he shouted, going over to the cupboard. "I'm going to whip you up a Hair of the Dog potion!"
She held up a hand. "You are forgiven. But in the future I'd kindly ask you to bring up any issues you may have
It took Harry a moment to realize this last was addressed to him. "Oh, I -- 180 centimeters, thereabouts."
"Gee, thanks," Harry said, spearing a baby-sized bite of pancake with his fork. "Appreciate the gesture, though."
In fact, Harry wanted nothing more than to get back to Hogwarts, draw a hot bath, pour himself a healthy glass of whiskey, and soak his aching body – and somewhere in there, maybe kiss Draco Malfoy a bit more. Or a lot more. On second thought, maybe sod the bath and whiskey and just kiss Draco, that sounded like a nice evening.
"But -- imagine being a child and looking at the news, and seeing your father's name plastered everywhere, called a villain, an evil madman, public enemy number one. Even if he deserved it, I imagine it would be... difficult."
Soon, much sooner than he'd expected considering how far Herbology was, he heard footsteps thudding quickly up the staircase -- not quite hurrying but not taking their time either. He knew immediately, with a deep sinking instinct, that it was not Neville. Neville's footsteps were intimately familiar to him, they were part of the soundtrack of his formative years, he'd know them anywhere, and this was not them.
"Ron," gasped Hermione, "Ron, tell Harry about the time -- the time Ginny made you -- ahahahaha -- made you --"
"Sorry," Malfoy muttered. "It's -- I've tried everything to get it off, but... Well, everyone regrets the tattoos of their youth, don't they?"
Smiling to himself, he took a few more steps, feeling lighter and lighter the deeper he went. When he was chest deep he took a breath and then submerged himself, holding his glasses with his good hand, bad arm positioned carefully against his side. It was so cool down here, so dark, so quiet, and Harry felt a little quiver of pure physical pleasure. A rarity, to feel suddenly so happy in his body. When he came back up, Malfoy was so close Harry could see the water droplets on his eyelashes, and he jumped in surprise.
A hand shot up so fast that Harry thought fondly of Hermione. "Yes, you in the red -- Maggie, is it?"
Gibson Ackley and the other two had not been trying to kill Harry. They'd been trying to destroy him. But Harry let this slide.
Harry began to stand, reveling at how easy it was even with his Locked leg, and Malfoy said sharply, "Careful! Careful. Is that a Locking charm? I'm going to take it off for a moment, just to demonstrate something, all right?"
"Well," Harry said. He moved to take a seat and then, remembering how uncomfortable the seat in question was, decided to lean on the back of it instead. "You seem like a man with a lot of nice things."
Harry gave him a pat on the shoulder. "I'm okay, Neville, only my bloody knee gave out. It doesn't even hurt that badly, just decided to skive off work with no warning. Hi, Professor McGonagall, I'm fine, please no one make a fuss."
“You don’t mind me kicking him out, do you?” said Kevari, settling himself in Draco’s vacated chair. “I seem to recall you’re not the biggest fan of… observers.”
"What about detention?" Galen demanded, outraged. "If Hanna here calls you a crippled berk, will we all go to detention with her?"
“My point’s not that we’re old,” Neville said, “it’s that I can tell by now when you’ve had a fight with someone. And…” He glanced at Harry with an expression that, on anyone other than Neville Longbottom, might have been almost sly. “I can tell when you’re feeling other things, too.”
"Sorry," Harry shouted above them, "Sorry, that's my rule!" A rule he was only just making up this very instant. "If one of you does well, you all do well! If one of you goes down, you all go down."
“Ditto,” said Draco drily, and Harry laughed. They sat quietly for a moment and then Draco said, “Look, today was… Not nice. I admit I was – well, I was a bit worried I might be…”
"There are canes with swords in them, and daggers, and probably other things," said Malfoy. "If you found a decent craftsperson, like Betsy at Chairs 'n' Chairs, I imagine she could find a way to put your wand in a cane and rig it with a quick release, so you could have it at the ready whenever you needed it."
fine,” Harry said, still riding that soothing wave of rage. “That’s bloody obvious to anyone who looks at me. Why you lot have to keep asking when you know the bloody answer…”
He'd woken early but it still took him twice as long as usual to get ready, even leaning on the wooden cane that had never left his chambers. Everything was blurry, hard to make out, and he'd smashed a jug of water before he realized he'd forgotten to put on his glasses for perhaps the first time ever. His leg was screaming at him for the hours he'd spent in bed ridding his body of that stupid bloody potion, and for the first time he seriously considered bringing the cane through the castle with him, even if it meant leaving his wand-hand occupied. But his reflexes and intuition were all he had, these days; what if today was the day something happened, and he wasn't fast enough? What if someone took his wand again in the time he spent dropping the cane to reach for it? What if an enemy broke into the castle and into the classroom and forced Harry to watch as his students were tortured in front of him?
Harry tapped his wand against the circle, once, twice, three times, and the wall faded away to reveal a short, dark hallway. Harry fit his wand back into the cane and stepped through the passage, and the wall closed up again behind him, leaving him in total darkness.
There he stayed for the next twelve hours. It was a deeply unpleasant night. The less said about it, the better.
“Your shoulder in particular will probably need to be immobilized for a while,” Draco said, and put a palm over the joint in question. His touch was careful, wary of causing more pain, but Harry thought he could feel the warmth of it even through the fleece. “And your wrist.” Gently, he smoothed his hand down Harry’s arm and wrapped his beautiful fingers briefly around Harry’s aching wrist. “Your fingers too, I’m afraid,” he added, and cradled Harry’s scarred hand in his own.
The sofa, which Harry now saw was not the green velvet one he'd come to know, sprang open like a book and the cushions rearranged themselves into pillows, blankets settling atop the mattress, from couch to bed in an instant. It was a beautiful piece of furniture, all gleaming bright wood and soft blue cushions. Harry tottered over, unLocked his knee, and fell backwards into it.
He put on his very best harmless Muggle face again and felt a flicker of hope when the man squinted at him, eyes sweeping from the cane to his pink jacket to his wet hair.
Harry’s patience was wearing thin. He wanted to find Draco and he wanted to sit down, in that order. “Maybe we should just start shouting so they show themselves.”
"This is your office, of course," she said. "Then, through that door and down a small passageway you'll find your chambers."
Harry had most of his weight on his good right leg but still the bad one had begun trembling uncontrollably, and he shoved the letter back into his pocket so he could take his wand from his mouth and Lock his knee. His mind was racing through this new information. In the owl he’d sent to the Aurors he’d told them to go to the Goyle estate, where Malfoy’s old friend Gregory lived, but he wondered suddenly if he should have asked them to check out Lizzie’s house instead. He’d discounted her from any real mischief because she was a Squib who’d married a Muggle, and nothing seemed like a clearer denunciation of her family’s Pureblood ideals, but now he was not so sure.
It tasted of licorice and salamanders, but it did the trick marvelously. His aching head stopped throbbing, his stomach settled, his slight mist of boozy sweat began to dry.
"This was excellent," Neville said cheerfully. "We should do this again. Next time I'll try to think less about plants when I open the door. And Harry, maybe you could think less about -- er -- about monsters."
Shit. Harry'd likely earned some innocent kid a year's worth of detention. What if it was a Quidditch player? What if Gryffindor lost the cup because of him? Merlin, what had he gotten himself into? He had to confess.
Ron put Rosie, shrieking, on a blanket on the floor, and came over to help Harry with the zipper. Then he dug the Floo map out of a drawer by the fireplace and handed it to Harry, peering over his shoulder. There were two public Floos in Brighton and Harry chose the one closest to the center of town, in a hidden room of an old hotel a few blocks from the marina. Once he arrived he’d ask someone where the Ragged Pony was and apparate there.
“You’re not still swimming in the mornings, are you?” Harry asked as they set out across the bridge.
“Erm, Maria, could I ask you to take this clipping back to the castle?” Neville said, neatly shooing her away.
Malfoy, for the first time, looked at Harry as if he were almost human. "Yes. I think it might help. If you felt -- if you feel you could."
I’m not – that isn’t me, I’m not Harry Potter.” Harry winced at Draco’s dubious expression and started again. “I mean, I am, obviously, I didn’t hit my head that hard, but I’m not – I didn’t come after you because I’m
Like a nightmare he saw himself pocketing his wand, then taking off his dirty robes, swapping them out for the clean ones. He'd swapped the robes; he had not swapped the contents of his pocket.
“Well, twelve,” said Negasi, motioning with his hand. “Aside from us three. But – twelve is still –”
Pockets and stomach full of potion and biscuits, Harry made his way to the faculty meeting just in time for the opening remarks, which were delivered in a monotone by Professor Soobs, who'd replaced Hagrid as Care of Magical Creatures professor when he'd retired to the mountains with his giant little brother. Neville nodded to him as he came in, and Harry took the seat next to him.
Harry didn’t know how to summarize it in a way that wouldn’t make him look like an idiot. “He was… hovering.”
"Thank you for introducing me to Betsy," Harry said. "If the cane comes through, you won't have to be hauling me through the streets anymore."
They perked up a bit, and as he went down the list they became more responsive, smiling, then laughing, then chiming in comments on their classmate's costumes. All was going well until Harry reached "Perkins, Timmy."
"Just like old times," Neville said happily, and bounded away down the staircase, with such ease that Harry had to turn away.
It took two tries to get Harry to his feet, but they managed eventually and Ron slung his arm around Harry's shoulders.
The next day, Harry was accosted by a group of Gryffindor third years in the Great Hall. It wasn't an ideal time to be accosted -- he was already late to lunch and he'd missed breakfast due to hangover, and was now both wildly hungry and a bit nauseous, a terrible combination he hoped to remedy with something greasy, like a grilled cheese. He could practically taste the buttered bread and the mild tang of cheese, but now all these students were standing in his way, demanding to know if it was true that he and Professor Malfoy had both been Seekers when they were at school.
Frustrated, Harry fell silent. Years of coaching from Hermione and still he could never find the right words to talk about his feelings. What
"Sorry," he said, rubbing his eyes beneath his glasses. "Sorry. I'm just --" a bitter washed-up git "--tired. Thank the students for the offer, Professor, and give them my apologies." He pushed back from the table and slapped a hand on Neville's shoulder, leveraging himself up with a forced smile. "I'm going to put myself to bed, I think."
"Question one." Malfoy leaned across his desk. "Why don't you use anything to help you get around? A cane, a walking stick, even a crutch? I've seen you in multiple situations where a simple cane would've solved quite a few of your problems."
“Yes,” Harry snapped. “You’d think people have only just noticed that I’m – that I’m not the most mobile person in the first place. I guess seeing tangible evidence of it is somehow distressing.”
“I’m afraid I must object,” said Kevari, stepping forward. “This boy needs rest, and lots of it, as soon as possible.”
The round-faced old man gave a cheeky little nod, black eyes twinkling as he came into the room. “And you, Healer Malfoy.”
"Where it -- goes?" Did they teach these children nothing? "It goes anywhere there's another Floo. You see, you enter when the flames are green and --"
It was a voice Harry had once thought snide but now found full of quiet humor; a voice that poured through his body like a tonic.
Harry put his head in his hand. This had to be a test, didn't it? Say yes, and he'd be giving Malfoy permission to poison him. The answer should be easy: get Longbottom. But Harry was in so much pain -- and had been for so long. The thought of even thirty minutes without it was a temptation greater than anything the Mirror of Erised could've shown him. Would he risk his life for it?
"Oh stop, oh don't, I'm going to vomit again," Hermione begged. She was shaking with laughter. "She always has sensible names for such horrors, what was she calling this?"
A very small barn owl was hopping up and down in front of Malfoy’s breakfast plate, a letter in its beak. Malfoy took the letter, frowning. It was a lovely envelope, cream-colored and embossed with a faint floral sheen – a wedding invitation, perhaps? Malfoy had already unsealed the flap before Harry saw a faint wisp of smoke and realized what was happening.
The next morning, Malfoy stopped him outside the Great Hall before breakfast. Harry looked at him blearily, a bit hungover from the half-bottle of firewhiskey he and Neville had drunk to celebrate – and commiserate -- their first day.
Why -- why -- why had he thought this was a good idea? Why hadn't he stayed home in his own spooky, horrible house with his spooky, horrible house elf, drunk off his arse by the fireplace, chugging pain potions til he couldn't see and living off his friend's good graces until they tired of him and he died impoverished and alone?
“When he came back from France, he got a job at St. Mungo’s – but in his first week alone, three people tried to kill him.”
Idly, Draco moved his thumb across Harry’s palm. “I suppose I was overdue for another appearance on the list,” he said.
She looked confused but willing. "We were wondering," she said, neatly unscrewing the lid and putting the bottle on his desk, "where your Floo goes?"
Draco be embarrassed to date him? Harry had felt lately as if Draco might, possibly, maybe be flirting, but suddenly he wondered if that was just ridiculous wish-fulfillment. Draco had been attentive lately, yes, and kind, and very watchful, and perhaps Harry had construed that as flirtation… but he’d somehow let himself forget that Draco was also a trained Healer. Of course he was watchful; to a Healer, Harry needed watching.
Any good mood Harry had been courting suddenly plummeted. "Love to," he said, trying to channel some of Malfoy's coolness, "but I can't fly."
As they began settling in their seats, a owl swooped into the classroom and fluttered around before alighting on Harry’s desk, an envelope in its beak.
Very gently, Draco set Harry’s glasses on his face, fingers barely brushing Harry’s cheeks. The rest of the pink room crystallized. “I’m fine,” Draco said. “Alive, thanks to you.”
Negasi blinked very rapidly and Harry was seized with the terrible thought that he might cry, but he didn’t, only pressed his lips together and nodded. “I’m really glad you are. And so’s Hanna.”
Malfoy suddenly dropped his gaze from Harry's face to the stack of parchment on his desk. He adjusted his quill in its inkpot and moved a jar of something green from the right side of the desk to the left. "I want to be clear," Malfoy said, addressing the jar of something green, "that -- that I'm sorry for what happened to you."
“But what if you swallow?” Harry said, and laughed delightedly at the look of absolute scandal Neville gave him. The student, thank Merlin, did not seem to get the joke.
"Oh. Yes. Sorry." He sat gingerly on his desk, stiff leg propped to one side. "As you can see, my knee's not working properly today, so I've frozen it in place with a Locking charm. This is a variation on which curse, do you think?"
, and that was one of the reasons Harry had always liked him – the man was always up for a laugh, game for a joke. “Well, no,” Roberts conceded, “you look a right mess. What I meant was, it’s very good to see you.”
“You’re impossible, you know that?” said Draco. “I’m holding your hand because – well, because I want to touch you, because I
"No, the Floo Network!" Neville said excitedly. "I wonder if we can set up Floo stations on each floor -- you've got a fireplace in your classroom, haven't you? And your office, too, I expect. You can't Floo in and out of Hogwarts, but I bet you can Floo within it!"
It was not a sex dungeon. It was not a dungeon at all. It was an elegant room with windows that looked out over the night sky, everything made of dark shining wood and velvet. To one side was a bar with three green high-backed velvet stools and what looked like a very well-stocked liquor cabinet; on the other side was an old-fashioned record player with an enormous stack of records. There were several plush couches, a bookshelf full of what looked like board games, and, in the center of the room, a billiards table with the balls already racked and ready.
He used his wand to pour and fill the vials he'd lifted from Malfoy, the only thing he was concerned might be noticed missing, since he'd taken 60 of them, enough for a month, but oh well, vials were easy to come by, he'd put in an order later so he wouldn't have to steal them next month. Then, with utmost care, he packed them into a bookbag, cleaned the potions classroom, and had a mostly pain-free staircase experience to his bedroom, where he fell into a lovely, pain-free sleep.
He was still having trouble getting over the fact that Draco Malfoy was about to be his colleague. The last time they'd seen each other had been the last day of the Battle of Hogwarts nearly thirteen years earlier, and Harry would have been perfectly content to leave it there for the rest of his life. He probably would've managed it, too, if he hadn't been for what had happened last year. Sometimes he still couldn't believe how quickly his life had changed. Just eighteen months ago he'd been the top Auror in the department and a rumored shoe-in to become the youngest-ever Head Auror when Roberts retired; he'd been fast, and strong, and still a holy terror on the Quidditch field. Now he was staring down the barrel of a pity position in academia and tiring from being on his feet for more than five bloody minutes.
Malfoy opened his mouth, then closed it. He looked a bit flushed. He opened his mouth again. Closed it again.
"You didn't," he assured her. And it was true, he wasn't offended. He was just -- sad. "Why not ask Mal - Professor Malfoy, he used to be quite a good Seeker back in the day."
Malfoy shrugged this off with the barest lift of his shoulder and matched his pace to Harry's as they started back up to the castle. It was lovely walk, through a small wood and then up the sloping green meadow, and the early evening sun was taking on a pinkish glow. For a while they walked in silence, each lost in their own thoughts, and then Malfoy said, "Look up."
He'd used to like billiards, and he let himself get a bit melancholy for a moment about all the things he'd used to like and couldn't do anymore, but then Malfoy said, "Potter, your turn."
Experimentally, Harry released her to reach for his glass. She gave another strong lurch and wriggle, but Ron was right: she was perfectly secure. For once, his accidental spellcasting had done something useful instead of destructive. "I'll keep her."
But someone was looking: Malfoy was looking. In fact, to Harry's horror, he was coming towards them, and the closer he got, the better-looking he became, which was truly an injustice.
“Could be. Haven’t seen another soul, but I’ve only just come through.” Negasi held up his wand. “Corpus Localis, you think?”
That was all Harry needed at the moment. He looked down at Negasi. “We need to find out where the Debs live and get there, fast. There’ll be an address somewhere around here, on a checkbook or on a document, but I’m – I’m not quite up to searching, so if you --?”
Harry stretched out his leg and resettled his bad arm in his lap, trying not to look directly at the deviously cute Cute Snailwort. “All right,” he said, “tell me why Malfoy quit Healing.”
“I go to trivia nights at the local,” the man said glumly. “Damn my luck, Mum’s going to murder me. I always manage to get myself hired by the baddies.”
They sat in the pub for nearly five hours, though Ron left briefly to bring Rosie home to where George had agreed to come by and put her to bed. They ordered food, and drinks, and then more food and drinks, until Harry was quite thoroughly sloshed and Hermione was sitting on Ron's lap and eating a plate of chips with the determination of the very drunk.
“I want you here,” Harry said, because part of his half-barmy paranoia was the fear that maybe this whole thing was an even bigger ruse to lure Harry away from his students so someone could attack them; a scenario even Harry had to admit was unlikely, but still, he felt better knowing Neville would be around. “I’m going to owl an old colleague at the Ministry, then get a carriage to Hogsmeade to use Ron and Hermione’s Floo.”
At first the man made no reply, but then, grudgingly, he shook his head. “No. ‘S a Muggle pub, I’m no Muggle.”
Now, he sat on that windowseat, halfway up, halfway down, unable to move in either direction. Every time he tried to get back up, his body protested so convincingly that he stopped. He could feel the black bile of the curse in his joints, seeping through his knee like viscous liquid and twisting up his thigh, settling in his hip and sending dark tendrils to coil in his shoulder and swollen fingers, a feeling like fire, if fire could hold a hammer and bang.
“We’re going to Hogsmeade,” Harry said. He did not want the students to get the wrong idea and think he and Malfoy were on some sort of romantic stroll – but the truth seemed to make things even worse.
“We’ve missed you, too,” Roberts said, his expression suddenly, and uncharacteristically, serious. “Quite a lot, in fact.”
"Yeah. Well." Harry took a drink. "I was in some counseling groups with other people who'd – who'd fought, in the war – and everyone was very keen to push this narrative about how sometimes it's hard to know when to
Just then, Harry heard a familiar tiny high-pitched scream, like a teakettle, and turned to find Jacob and his gaggle of third years staring at them. When Harry and Draco looked at them, they clutched each other and gasped and began laughing.
aratri!" Harry waved his wand so the ground swelled upwards into a chair and he was sitting more or less upright, and then, with another flick, the chair tipped forward to help him stand. He lowered his wand, and the ground flattened out again. "Like that," he said, self-conscious, and uncomfortably aware of his bare feet.
There were five stairs up to the professor's table, naturally, and Harry took them carefully, thankful for the pain potion that let him appear at least halfway normal for a few hours. He knew his limp was still noticeable, but at least he wasn't the shambling mess that had greeted Professor McGonagall less than an hour before.
“Hardly, I haven’t solved, like, world hunger, but yeah, to tell you the truth, I’m pretty proud of this design. And I haven’t even told you the best part yet.”
“Oh, sure,” she said, adjusting her umbrella so it covered both of them, a gesture Harry found rather touching. “You’ll want to go just down to the end of the road here, then you’ll want to take a right, then you’ll want to continue for a bit until you see a sign for Cresswell street, then you’ll want to take another right, then you’ll see it at the end of the lane, big orange sign with a horse on it. You’ll want to go on in.”
Several times someone had approached them with a tentative, "Hello, Minister, I was wanting to ask --", and each time, whoever was behind the bar flicked their wand and a blaring neon sign lit up above Hermione's head: "No one bothers the Minister while she's drinking, HOUSE RULES."
“I’m sorry,” Harry felt he had to say. “It was the sodding Floo system, they worked out that we’re the only ones who have private Floos, and… and you know, kids, they jump to conclusions, and…” He stopped talking, because Draco had gone very pink, and pink was a distractingly fetching color on him.
Harry laughed, delighted at the thought of the two of them corresponding in any manner, but his laughter died when Negasi appeared in the living room doorway. It wasn’t the sight of Negasi that dampened his spirits; it was the person flanking him. A tall, well-built older man with a clean-shaven face and grey hair pulled back in a ponytail.
Harry turned, grinning. He found he did not care if he was terrible -- he was glad just to be playing. And anyway, not all his shots were as bad as the first. They weren't nearly as good as they'd once been, but although he and Neville were sorely beaten by Malfoy, it was as much Neville's fault as his, and he sank enough balls to make it feel like he was getting somewhere.
“Well, she won’t be glad if we don’t bring her potions professor back safe and sound,” Harry said, trying to steer them back on track.
“On this particular occasion, I made a lot of people sing Centaur shanties with me, and then I – I think I got up on a table at some point – and was buying everyone drinks – and –” Draco put his head in his hand “—and I was sitting on a lot of laps, apparently, though I don’t recall most of this. There was a man there who was quite aggressively trying to take me home, and I was too drunk to properly object. All I remember is pushing someone away, someone with an awful, scratchy beard. Anyway, Betsy happened to be at the pub with her wife, Mona, you’ll like her a lot when you meet her… and bless them, they recognized a disaster when they saw one. They intervened, closed out my tab, and managed to get me back to their flat. They poured water down my throat and lay me out on their couch and next thing I knew I was waking up to the smell of coffee and the sound of Betsy talking a mile a minute.” He shrugged. “I ended up staying all day. Merlin knows why, but they took a shine to me and I to them.”
A woman emerged from the forest of wood, extremely tall and broad-shouldered with thick dark hair down to her waist, pale skin, and a pair of enormous, exquisite hazel eyes. She was wearing lots and lots of silver jewelry placed pretty much anywhere a person could put jewelry, and when she spoke again, Harry realized she was American.
They scampered out, still laughing incomprehensibly. Harry shook his head and glanced at his desk. At least his ink was open.
“I Stupefied the three blokes out there,” Harry said, jerking his head over his bad shoulder and wincing as it sent a jolt of pain down his back. “We’ve got to question them quick and then get to Lizzie Debs’ house.”
He sat down heavily in his chair, digging his fingers surreptitiously into his hip beneath cover of the table, and after a slightly stunned moment, the students began dutifully clapping. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy staring at him with quirked brows, and at his side Professor McGonagall muttered, "Let's hope you're a better teacher than you are an orator, Potter."
"Turned out all right, didn't he?" Neville said. "Come Valentines, all the students send him love notes and he gets horribly embarrassed, it's excellent."
"This is an emergency pain tonic," Malfoy said. "It's extremely powerful and extremely dangerous, so I need to explain it before I can administer it, and you need to give me verbal confirmation and consent that you understand. All right?"
They passed Ron and Hermione’s street and Harry felt a pang of guilt for not getting in touch with his friends to tell them he was down, but as he’d said to the students, they were here strictly on business, not pleasure.
"You're all right, come on, let's just get you up this last step. I can take more weight that that, Potter, go on. Good. Can you stand on your own? Do you need my arm?"
To Harry's delight, Neville was waiting for him outside the Great Hall, beaming in a swirling mass of students. Though he saw Neville regularly, he somehow always managed to forget how unnervingly good-looking he'd gotten, and had to take a moment to transpose the chubby-faced child from his memory onto this tall, handsome man.
Professor McGonagall -- crikey, was he supposed to call her Minerva, now? -- was waiting for him, as promised, on the seventh floor outside the Room of Requirement. Despite her age she looked as stern and stately as ever, peering at him through her spectacles, not-smiling in that smiling way she had, and Harry grinned at her despite himself.
Harry could not help but glance towards the Malfoy in question, and his heart leaped when he saw that Draco had dragged his head up and was staring at him. His expression, usually so controlled, broke open for a moment, and Harry saw all the things he himself was feeling: fear, relief, concern, desperation, connection. Then Draco’s face went blank again and his head slumped back down.
Harry watched him swim out, as graceful on water as he was on land, then turned to the matter of his own undressing. He'd process what Malfoy had said later; maybe. For now, he unzipped his jeans and then cast about for somewhere to sit, but the sandy beach was empty. He used his earth-shaping charm to swell some sand into a semblance of a seat, and managed to get his jeans off. Next was his shirt, and he looked to make sure Malfoy wouldn't see the unbuttoning charm he'd learned at St. Mungo's, all the buttons wriggling magically free of their holes as Harry waited. His shoulder always made this part difficult, but he struggled free of his shirt without too much hassle, then folded his wand in his clothes and stood. He was just in his red Gryffindor boxers, now, and he made his way through the shifting sand, careful not to lose his footing, careful not to look down at the mess of his leg.
"She was frightened and I was closest," Malfoy said. "Came whirling into my classroom like a banshee screaming for the dead."
Harry found the blue robes, and blinked. No wonder he hadn't spotted him. Malfoy was still pale, yes, still thin, still pointed, but he was also, unexpectedly, a man. Not a snivelling soot-covered teenager cowering at his mother's side, but a tall, broad-shouldered, strong-jawed, long-striding man.
And with that threatening sign-off, he turned and left. The room was mostly empty, finally, and Harry took a brief, staggering step that must've looked as bad as it felt, because Neville resumed staring at him anxiously.
Malfoy waited until they’d finished crossing the bridge, had made it down the small set of stairs, and were walking across the green towards Hogsmeade before he spoke.
It was his Healer’s voice, and Harry felt himself bristling out of instinct. But then, remembering their fight, their weeks without speaking because of his own stupid pride, he deflated.
“Draco,” said Kevari, still looking at Harry, “I’d be glad to administer a much-needed potion to your friend, but I’m afraid I can’t do it until you’re sat down safely in the kitchen being looked-over by Healer Seidman.”
Sorry again for the long delay! And for anyone worried that I'll abandon this story, I will not, I absolutely promise to finish it, just so you know. Only a couple chapters left now, I think...
Harry was already busy doing so, tapping his wand against the metal until the links shattered, and a moment later Negasi was climbing to his feet.
Getting dressed was always a bit trickier than getting undressed, but he managed it pretty smoothly, he thought. Malfoy didn't seem to notice how little he used his left arm and he didn't try to hide the buttoning charm, or the charm to tie his shoes; better Malfoy think he was lazy rather than secretive, because secretive implied secrets and secrets invited questions. He packed up his notebook and quills and the stack of essays he hadn't even touched and slung his bag over his good shoulder as Malfoy waited.
“No,” Harry said, thinking of being recognized by Betsy for his wand, then by the barkeep for his Patronus. “Not at first, anyway. People haven’t been. They get distracted by other things. A limp is quite a good disguise, turns out.”
“About fucking time,” Harry muttered, and finally, finally, finally, let himself sink into nothingness.
“Here, hang onto me,” Neville said, taking the cane off him so he could grab Neville’s arm with his good hand.
"I'm all right from here," Harry said. "No more stairs between me and my classroom. Good thing or I'd probably shout at the students, too. Merlin, why am I such a tosser?"
“I had a shite weekend,” Harry said cheerfully. “But I’m hoping the week will be better. Now, if you could all line yourself up according to height…”
“Shit,” Negasi said, putting out a hand to steady him. “You’ve looked better, Harry, I’ll be honest.”
"Can you blame me for wanting to keep one thing private? One tiny fucking tragic detail? Everybody knows I can't walk, they know I'm bleeding useless, is it really so unreasonable that I don't want it known I can't open sodding potions bottles?"
“Merlin, your faces,” he said, wiping his eyes. “No, Potter, of course we’re not going to arrest you. We need an official statement is all, you know the protocol. You too, Malfoy. Come along.”
Harry groaned and clapped his hands over his ears. "Lower your volume, Ron, please. My head can't take it."
Harry had not thought about vibes, but he was pretty sure he did not want either of the first two. "I would prefer it look... quite normal?"
"He'll be fine if you lot stop gawking at him," Malfoy said, and flung a pointer finger towards the door. "Go. I'm not joking, go on."
grading. I thought it was like -- their after-class hobby. They always seemed to so relish handing back the low marks."
"But Harry says, Harry says the students love him, and that says a lot about a person, I think," she said, then beamed in Harry's direction. "Neville told me in an owl that they also love you, Harry. He said you're a smash hit, those were his exact words! Oh, I adore Neville."
He had been touched so much lately, yet somehow felt more physically lonely than he’d ever done in his life. It made no sense.
But his knee, thank Merlin, was Locked. It was the only thing that kept him from pitching forward and falling down those dark stairs to his certain death. That, and the hand he’d flung out automatically to grab the doorframe, nearly dropping his cane. He tightened his grip, aghast at the thought of having come close to letting his wand go.
"Oh, basically fine? I told you Mona got that fellowship in Vancouver, right? Well, so she gets there and it turns out the guy who's supposed to be supervising her project straight up
"That curse died when I killed Voldemort," Harry said, and then winced. Really? Was he breaking out the big guns already? "And anyway, Baisley held the job for years."
"I don't!" she said fiercely. "If I hadn't come looking, you might've -- well, it wouldn't have been very nice for you, would it?"
“Oh shit –” the man said, but not in time to duck the Petrificus Totalis spell Harry had sent flying. The man went rigid and toppled over backwards into the house with a mighty thud, eyes rolling in panic. Harry set his jaw and, feeling both determined and rather villainous, he stepped around the man’s body and into the house.
Malfoy looked distinctly uncomfortable. "No. They asked me if -- if I had a Floo in my -- chambers."
“Good,” she said, and patted both their arms. “Next time you two come down, we can all have dinner together!”
“Yes, absolutely sozzled.” Draco was sitting very upright as he said this, the picture of a prim young gentleman.
“Er, right,” said Negasi, standing. “I’m going to – are you thirsty, Harry? I’ll get you a glass of water. Draco? Water? Yes. I’ll – I’ll go and do that.”
"If word gets out," Harry said, practically panting now, both with anger and because they were going up a rather steep hill, "If word gets out that it's not just my leg, it's my arm, too, it's half my sodding body, it'll just make it that much easier for anyone to take me down. They'll know all my weaknesses, they'll be able to plan, they'll come after me, and the next time that happens, it's over, I'm done for. I can't fight anymore, not like this."
Ron chewed his lip for a moment. “All right,” he said finally, “I’ll get you a coat. Should I – do you want me to come? I could bring Rosie to George, or if he can’t watch her, I could try –”
She didn’t go on, though; she made it to the bottom and then turned around to watch as he made his slow, lurching way down. He tried to detach himself from the difficulty of the task, the pain of it and the knowledge that once he was down he’d be trapped, unable to get back up quickly enough to escape; but detachment only sent him spinning back into that horrible memory, so he tried to focus on the present; but the present was so deeply unpleasant that he gave up on that and focused instead on the future. Just let Draco be at the bottom of these steps and let him be all right, and Harry could handle anything else that happened.
Fatigue from being cosseted and mollycoddled. He did not want Draco to butter his bread. He wanted Draco to fuck him senseless into next week.
He went into his empty classroom to use the Floo, but instead of stating "Harry Potter's Bedroom," he found himself requesting the fifth floor, and then, walking down the hallway, and then, somehow, standing in front of Draco Malfoy's office.
Merlin, but life was strange. Never in a thousand years could his school-age self have imagined that one day he’d be clinging to Draco fucking Malfoy and loving it.
Harry supposed that seeing double was better than the alternative, which was feeling like half his body was being smashed by trolls. “I might need a hand,” he admitted.
Harry was about to turn away when his eye caught on the framed liquor license posted above the fire extinguisher. He put a hand on the wall beside it to prop himself up and squinted at the text, searching for one detail in particular.
"All right," she said, "I'm going for help." She turned, then hesitated. "Here," she blurted, "my mum used to do this when I wasn't feeling well." She flicked her wand and suddenly the air was filled with huge, soapy bubbles, each of them containing a soft white glow, like starlight. Then she darted back down the stairs.
Feeling awkward with both Betsy and Draco watching him, Harry took the cane on a trip around the store, leaning very lightly on it at first and then more heavily, testing its limits. It was extraordinarily comfortable to hold, and he realized she’d carved the wood to fit his own hand – which explained the plateful of goo, and made it seem very worthwhile. The support itself was also excellent: he felt steadier with the cane in his hand, more balanced and less fearful of falling, and the weight it took off his bad hip and knee was enough to make a marked difference in his pain.
“Did you notice, Professor Malfoy?” the girl said, turning to Draco. “That it’s just the same color as his eyes?”
“You talked to Draco about me?” Harry said, torn between anger and wanting to know every single word of every single thing Draco had said.
Malfoy, however, was still laughing. "It's -- oh, Potter, you'll be the death of me -- it's an -- an obstacle course! And I'm sure it's absolutely filled with horrible, monstrous things we have to vanquish. Look, look there, lurking with the tropical flowers, it's a fucking
Malfoy's office hours were after lunch, which coincided with Harry's free period, so he gathered his courage and his energy and hauled himself up two flights of stairs to the Potions office. He was starting to get to know his students, and when they called out to him as they passed he was able to greet them mostly by name, which cheered him. He paused at the top of the second flight and took a moment to lean against a wall, catching his breath and calming his nerves and trying to let the stair-induced pain subside so he could tone down his limp and make a better entrance. He smoothed his robes, tucked his bad left hand casually into his pocket, and knocked on his office door.
“It’s often used for love potions,” she said. “And it’s integral in the potion to find a good accountant.”
“It’s just me,” hissed Negasi, slipping out from the living room. “I popped in through a back window.” He noticed the man on the floor. “Blimey, you don’t waste time, do you?”
"Okay so not to make any assumptions, but you're looking for a functional medical-grade assistive device, yeah? We're not talking like, ornamental walking cane 'cause it looks badass."
“Yeah,” he said. His threshold for chit-chat had been crossed. He let himself glance around and realized with some relief that this basement was a far cry from the one he’d been locked in. It smelled like a basement, yes, but it was carpeted and brightly-lit and there was a billiards table. Harry blinked at the table, confused.
Harry, because he did not know what else to do, took the support that Malfoy was offering and made his clunky way down the steps.
He knew it would be Hanna even before she raised her hand. "Some curses are cast to be unHealable, like, on purpose. It's illegal and it's mad difficult to get right, but some people do it anyway."
expecting to see Negasi Seid chained to a stove and making muffled grunts of panic through a Silencing charm.
The bell over the front door jingled as someone else came in, and Betsy glanced to her new customer with a bright smile. “Be right with you!” She turned back to Harry. “We just need to activate the security charm so no one can get that wand out except you. Okay so I’m gonna tap this with my wand, then you have to press the knot and remove and insert your wand three times, so it gets to know you, got it?”
“Er – I suppose I did notice,” said Malfoy, and even in his own torment Harry took pleasure from seeing prim and proper Malfoy grow discomfited. He did not, however, take pleasure in the wave of thrilled giggles this comment brought about. “Well, they’re an unusual color,” Malfoy continued, clearly trying to assert logic in the face of all this silliness. “Very green.”
Malfoy poured them both another knuckle of whiskey and leaned over the desk to clink his glass with Harry's.
Harry gave in. If Neville hadn't noticed by now that his arm was as buggered as his leg, well, no time like the present. He pushed himself back to his feet and took the cue in his good hand, moving round the table looking for the easiest shot. There -- the striped 9 was lined up pretty well for a corner pocket. He positioned his left hand gingerly on the table and, trying very hard to keep his balance, sank down as far as he could until his shoulder couldn't take it anymore, which wasn't very far at all, unfortunately. It didn't help that his one-legged stance was putting undue pressure on the joint to support him against the table.
“See you –” Negasi started, but the flames were already shooting up green and the two aurors were spinning and blurring and vanishing in a jet of smoke.
Once more, he tried to stand. Once more, he could not. Distantly he heard the clatter of people moving through hallways, students chattering, someone shouting. Another period had started. Second? Third? Fourth? Harry had lost all time. He made another effort at movement and bit his lip so hard blood began to run down his chin. He mopped it with his sleeve, staring at the wet stain on the black fabric.
Merlin, he was sorry she was seeing him like this. What a bloody nightmare. Would he be sacked for traumatizing students?
It was deeply uncharitable of Harry to think of any student as a twit, but he thought it anyway. "Yes," he said as patiently as he could, "and hopefully that's what we'll learn in this class. Moving on, please, and let's remember what I said about personal questions."
Startled, Harry started to say, “You do?”, and it was only years of training that had him reacting out of pure reflex when Craig, Phil and the bartender all reached for their pockets in tandem. He had his own wand out before any of them did (he really needed to find a way to repay Betsy) and was roaring “Expelliarmus!” just as the three wands came up to point at his face.
Finally, finally, finally, the meal was over, the students had been gathered by the prefects, the professors Harry didn't know had all shaken his hand and introduced themselves, and Harry at last was free to go. It was with some difficulty that he got to his feet, hip stiff as a board, and took an exploratory step before deciding it was for everyone's good if he waited til the room cleared a bit before he tackled those five stairs and the vast expanse of the Great Hall. He didn't even want to think about the five staircases that lay before him and his bed.
“Your coat is nice, Professor Potter,” said one of the girls. “It’s the same color as your eyes, did you know?”
It was unclear how long he lay there, gasping. Pure reflex had had him twisting in time to make sure he landed on his good side, which was the only mercy, and he curled up as small as he could go, as if that might give the pain less surface area to deal with. The pain stole every thought he had, it stole his very mind and turned him into nothing more than a body, a conduit for agony, like the Cruciatus but unrelenting because there was no one on the other side of it to lower their wand and grant him a reprieve. All he could do was try to keep breathing until it released him enough to be himself again.
"This is the biggest disappointment of my week," Ron said. "I was so looking forward to an hour of pure abuse, just like old times."
He had spent a pleasant few hours inventing an enchantment that let him manipulate the ground, sculpting it into little hills and ridges, and he was able to prop himself up perfectly to his comfort, his back and head pillowed by one grassy mound, another beneath his knees, another supporting his bad arm so he could prop his hand in his lap and hold his book down. An earthen recliner. There was a spot on the grounds he particularly liked even though it was a bit of a hike: thick, soft grass in a copse of trees, far from where the students tended to gather and with a perfect view of the vast, crystalline waters of the lake. There was a little sandy beach below where sometimes Harry saw footprints, though he'd yet to see another person.
Ye gods, apologies for the wait! I live in the US and I have done pretty much nothing for the past month except refresh the internet trying to make it promise me that Trump wouldn't win again, and GUESS WHAT! HE LOST! OH HAPPY DAY!!! What a fucking RELIEF y'all. Back to the things that really matter in life, like FAN FICTION.
He was chained to a bolted-down metal chair in the middle of the room, shirtless, his lower lip split and his blond hair bloodied, one eye badly swollen, and it was unclear whether or not he was conscious. His head was slumped forward against his bare chest, hands fastened behind him, legs strapped down. He was alive, though; Harry could tell immediately, could see him breathing, and he was flooded with a relief so intense that for a moment he felt no pain. The sight of Draco was a pain potion in and of itself, the curve of his strong shoulders, the sweep of his hair, the sight of his orange socks peeking from beneath his trouser hem. Harry allowed himself one single moment to look, to bask in a wave of pure solace.
Little gasps all around the table. Harry's blood went cold and he willed his face not to change. Aiming for pure nonchalance, he flicked his wand to pour himself a glass of water.
“Oh,” Harry said, disappointed. Maybe he’d go take that hot bath after all. “You expect he’ll be back by dinner?”
A second later, he nearly laughed. He recognized that style of lock -- he had one just like it in his own office. They were everywhere, generic charmed locks that were universally accessible by faculty and universally closed to students.
The class erupted into laughter, and Harry grinned. Was it possible he wouldn't be a total wash at this?
“I’m not,” said Harry, though to his surprise he found that the idea didn’t bother him nearly as much as it had two years ago. He’d gotten used to being watched. “Er, about that pain potion…?”
“Paranoid, that man,” said the woman, shaking her head. She gave Harry a sudden, warm smile. “Sorry, we haven’t even introduced ourselves. I’m Lizzie, of course; Evie’s mother. And you are – wait, no, don’t tell me. Are you Glen?”
Malfoy outright grinned at this. "Youngest Minister in wizarding history. Quite a title to live up to."
He wanted to rumple Draco’s perfect hair and wrinkle Draco’s lovely shirt and bite his smooth white neck. He wanted to bruise those prim lips with kisses. He wanted to undo everything proper about Draco and turn him into an absolutely delicious mess, and then he wanted to clean him up again.
"Has anyone else had any odd questions about the Floo system?" Harry asked his colleagues at dinner a few nights later. A third year boy called Jacob had hung back after class that morning and asked how many Floos there were in the castle, total.
“You’re a patient today, not a Healer,” said Kevari, but he was smiling, clearly no stranger to Draco’s character. “Yes, show me what you’ve got.”
Harry realized he was taking a very long time to answer, but Malfoy hadn't moved, was waiting patiently for Harry to sort out whatever the hell he was trying to sort out.
They stared at each other, Harry still half-in the fireplace, Draco with his back to the Great Hall, and Harry could see heads swiveling, could see students trying to catch a glimpse of them, no doubt spreading ridiculous rumors amongst themselves, which only made Harry angrier. That’s all they’d ever be: rumors.
"Right," Ron said, settling himself on the couch at Harry's feet. "Well, she did technically have pasta, only it was ramen noodles -- and she did technically have tomato sauce, only it was ketchup -- but what she
Finally, Malfoy turned. "Also," he said, "I don't know if you've heard, but my mother cut off all her hair, married a Muggle woman, and is now living in a lesbian commune in Greece, so -- there's also that."
Malfoy spoke from his seat, where he was draped casually, comfortably, quill behind an ear, the picture of professorial elegance.
“Oh, I don’t think so,” said Kevari. “This house hasn’t got a Floo, however, and he’s in no shape to apparate on his own, so he’ll need a chaperone getting back to Hogwarts. If you wouldn’t mind, I think it’s best if you –"
about it. We used to talk about it just to horrify ourselves, it was a lark, you know. But these kids seem… quite invested.”
He didn't know whether he was relieved or bereft when Neville let out an enormous snort and blinked awake, groggily checking his own watch.
The classroom began to feel a bit warmer, however, and Harry got on with the lesson well enough. He wasn’t up for a lecture so he broke the students into groups and gave them a jinx worksheet with enough problems that they’d keep themselves more or less occupied with little to no input from him, and so the first period went by without much trouble.
Harry cocked his head speculatively but Malfoy said, "Are you mad? If this one starts tromping around as if he's an elephant he'll never walk again."
“Er, I think so,” he said, wincing at a flashback of himself tackling the goon in the Ragged Pony and hitting the floor; then at another memory of having his arm wrenched brutally behind his back; then another memory of hitting the basement wall. “I certainly didn’t treat it kindly. Draco said he thought it’d have to be immobilized.”
With a fizzing sensation, the relentless throb of his leg suddenly faded to a much more manageable thrum, and Harry sighed with relief. Then he sat up, straightened his robes, and went back out to face the stairs.
Harry half-smiled. "Love it. Though to be honest, I'd trade it for not having shouted at McGonagall."
“That’s right,” Harry said, returning her smile and hoping his internal panic wasn’t showing. “Glen. How’d you guess?”
"Ah, she's upstairs crying over Rosie's crib," said George, when Ron asked. "You know how she gets when she's drunk. All right, Harry?"
“I did a preliminary examination on him,” started Draco, and Harry said “You did?” just as Kevari said, “Is that what the kids are calling it these days?”
"And everyone who suffered from his bigotry? Have they managed to put it behind them? Have Luna and Hermione forgotten being tortured in his house, do you think? Is Dobby going to pop back to life because Malfoy's suddenly feeling a bit sorry?"
“Hang on,” Draco said, and put an arm around Harry’s waist, pulling him close and holding him there decisively, and though Harry recognized a distraction when he felt one, it was a very effective distraction. Draco was strong and steady at his side, and even the rushing nausea of the Floo and the stabbing pain as they whipped through space wasn’t enough to take away from the pure pleasure of the physical contact.
Neville had the tact to remain silent on this point, and for a while they just stared at the Cute Snailwort and thought their own separate thoughts. Harry
"I feel as if I can't hold a baby and a pint at the same time," Harry said, twitching the useless fingers of his left hand in demonstration. "D'you mind--"
"I have a theory. I think you won't use anything because you're a paranoid bastard and you want to keep your wand-hand free. Just say yes or no, Potter."
He wasn't what you might call comfortable that morning, still wrung-out from his stupid adventure in self-medicating, and the knowledge that he had no relief to look forward to was distracting in and of itself. It was, he realized, the first day since he'd been injured that he'd have no medication whatsoever. He'd sent an owl to St. Mungo's begging them yet again to deliver the potions to him and had had an owl back with just three words: Give It Up! His options were getting narrow and narrower, and most of them rhymed with Baco Talfoy.
"Did you ever train together?" one boy asked, Jacob: the same who'd come to his office to ask about the Floo.
Harry winced. "I'm -- I wish you hadn't seen me like that in the first place. I feel terrible about it."
with him. It seemed patently mad that anyone would want to flirt with him when he felt so bloody terrible, but apparently his outsides were doing a good job concealing the wreck of his insides. How could she look past this pink fleece, though? Mystery upon mystery.
“Right. So, bad mood, feeling down, I snuck out to the Three Broomsticks to have a drink – just one drink, then right back to the castle.” Draco looked as if he were eating something unpleasant. “I did have one drink – but then I had another. And then another. And another. Perhaps you can see where this is going.”
As the students were leaving, Harry said, "Hanna, a word?" and when she came to his desk he said, "You seem sensible. Will you explain to me what is going on? The giggling, the screaming, the questions about the Floo... Am I out of my mind to feel they're related?"
It sang in him, seeking release, seeking a target, and Harry grit his teeth not only against the pain, now, but against his own magic, banging against the walls of his body like it might break through.
Harry had a keen sense-memory of climbing these bloody stairs day in and day out, and it wasn't hard to approximate his daily haul, leaning heavily on the banister, going up carefully step-by-step even though it felt ridiculous to try and accommodate a pain he didn't feel. Malfoy went behind him, not hovering exactly.
Instead of actually spending time with or speaking to Draco, Harry threw himself into the mystery of who’d been sending Draco’s Howlers. Alone in his office, he pulled out everything he’d learned in his decade as an Auror, examining the envelope from every magical angle.
"Right," Harry said, and risked releasing Neville's chair to push his glasses up his suddenly sweaty nose. Merlin, his leg was killing him. "Well, yes, I'm -- Professor Potter -- your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher -- I know, I know, no shite --" He met McGonagall's shocked eyes and realized that, obviously, he oughtn't to have said shite, but too late, carry on -- "-- and I'm looking forward to getting to know you all, and, and teaching you defensive magic, and -- I hope no one gets hurt. Thank you."
Harry did not like standing around being told how terrible he looked. “Tomorrow will be a hassle,” he said. “I’ll have to skive off work again, get down to Hogsmeade so I can get to the Ministry – no, now is best. I’m already up and about.”
It came up again, however, in his next class – “Professor Potter! Are you all right?” – and again in the next, and then all the rest of the day. By dinner time Harry was so sick of it he had half a mind to stow the cane in a closet and never bring it back out.
“Lumos,” he murmured, and Betsy’s excellent cane lit up like a torch. The passage was of brick, and it wasn’t far until he hit a door that opened into an alleyway. It was warmer here in Brighton than it had been in northern Scotland and was raining lightly, the sky bright white as if the sun were lurking just beyond the layer of clouds. The air smelled of brine, and Harry took a deep breath of it as he made his way onto the street to get his bearings. He felt a bit calmer now that he was here, taking action, though still he couldn’t fight the battery of images his treacherous brain kept supplying: Draco, tied up and bloody as he himself had once been; Draco, lifeless in a heap; Harry, too late to save him.
“Grab him,” he heard Gregory shout, and hands reached out towards him. Someone grabbed his bad arm and twisted it behind his back and he couldn’t help but shout, his good leg buckling, but his bad knee was still Locked rigid and he used it to keep himself upright as he aimed at Gregory and knocked him out just as he’d picked up his wand again. Gregory hit the floor hard and a woman screamed.
Harry followed their gaze and said, “Oh! No, nothing’s happened, it’s just – something to help me walk.” He looked at them incredulously. “Have you not noticed that I -- erm, limp a bit?”
Draco seemed a bit stiff – and oh Merlin, somewhere along the line Harry had accidentally begun thinking of him as Draco again. He was clacking his thumb ring against his water glass, a nervous habit Harry had recently begun noticing, and was very intently scrutinizing the menu rather than try and make conversation.
Harry glanced over and found Draco watching him at that very moment. So was he flirting right now? Or was he waiting for Harry to topple over?
The two men waited as the spell zipped around the house, searching out other humans, and though it only took three minutes it felt like an eternity. Anything might happen in three minutes; anything might happen to Draco while he, Harry, stood ineffectually in the foyer awaiting a little puff of blue fucking light. He leaned his good shoulder against a wall, trying to breathe through the thudding pain that threatened to split his body in two, then he glanced at Negasi. He wondered if this was how his Auror team had felt when they were searching for him – helpless, frightened, furious, determined.
“Hi,” he said to the person nearest him, a pretty dark-haired white woman in jeans and black cashmere, who was smiling at him in welcome. He tried not to look at Draco, though every instinct roared at him to act immediately, to knock out every one of these buggers and smash these chains and grab his friend and go. In practice he knew it would not be so simple. He smiled back down at the stranger. “I’m a bit late.”
