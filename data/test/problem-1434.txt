At some point he did fall asleep and was awakened by rays of sunlight falling through the magic window. Sleepily, he rubbed his eyes. Harry had slid closer to him in his sleep, his hand still clutched tightly. Even though the Slytherin would have liked to stay lying there, he knew they should get this conversation quickly over with. Without giving it any more thought, he gently stroked Harry's forehead before pulling his hand out of the other's. Harry stirred, rubbed his eyes and sat up.
"Very nice, you are recovering amazingly fast. You could leave as early as tonight," she said. At the same moment, Severus Snape entered the hospital wing.
"Single room, not bad," Blaise said and casually sat down on the chair that was next to the bed. The two young men looked at him, startled for a moment, then put the books aside. Harry immediately wanted to pull his hand out of Draco's, but Draco held him tightly.
"Yes, I know. I got you and Mr. Weasley off your feet, I couldn't have brought you all here inconspicuously any other way, and now follow me, but a warning, if you ever tell anyone about this, you're going to wish detention was the least of your problems, understand?" said Severus sternly, opening the secret door after all three students had nodded.
"Take care of her and ... Well, you'll manage," he whispered in his ear before detaching himself from him.
"Yes, very funny Luc. What are you wearing? Were the plain shirts sold out?", amused, Severus eyed his best friend, whose shirt was adorned with green palm fronds.
"Hey, so if you say so okay, but Harry ... falling in love is really not a bad thing?" he said, patting Harry on the shoulder and walking over to Hagrid.
"You must know that such abuse of one's soul, which even in the case of a murderer never remains unscathed by his evil deed, is considered such a terrible black magic spell that it has been completely taboo at Hogwarts since Dumbledore became headmaster here. The soul of the person who makes a Horcrux of himself is severely shaken and unstable. A Horcrux works in exactly the opposite way to a living human being: if the human being is killed, his body dies but the soul remains intact, whereas if a Horcrux is destroyed, the piece of soul it contains is killed and the body can remain intact. A Horcrux can only be destroyed by the few means that destroy something irretrievably, so that it cannot be repaired even by the most powerful magic. These include basilisk poison or the goblin-made weapons treated with it, as well as black magic-generated demon fire," Silence. The crackling of the fire was all that echoed in the room.
"Killed the Horcrux in you, but not you, not really. This is ... let's call it an in-between world."
"Potter, what have you done in your incompetence again?" thundered Snape immediately. Harry had no strength to argue with the man, but he didn't have to, Draco jumped in.
"I'll be careful," he then said softly and pushed a bit into Harry. He tensed, which was different from the fingers. Draco remembered Blaise's words and gently stroked Harry's chest and then his erection.
"We'll talk tomorrow Severus. I'll let Albus know and they'll be excused from class for the time being," McGonagall said.
"Yes, it is, but it was the right thing to do. This wedding was one of her last wishes," said the potions master.
"Harry I'm sorry, I really am. You have to believe me, please. I wanted to ... I don't know. I was just scared for you and ... when I showed Severus, I felt it was right, but now..."
"Me? But ... But this is the place Draco described to me. The sea, the seagulls and ... our children ...", Harry faltered and looked past Sirius into the distance. Children's laughter sounded against his ear. He couldn't quite make them out, but in the distance, two children were running across the sand, laughing.
"I have to go to breakfast. Dumbledore had her things brought here and told the students that you, me, had to stay here as a sort of punishment for the explosion, to help me sort all the potion ingredients," Snape said, rolling his eyes and handing Harry a letter.
"Where is he?", Ron wanted to know quietly, but at the same moment Blaise appeared out of breath at the top of the stairs.
"Shh ... try to breathe more calmly, I'm here," he murmured and kissed the other's neck. The latter took a deep breath and then turned in Draco's arm.
"Sure Harry, we are ... by the way, I never thought Snape lived like this, I thought it was .... er ... more gothic," Ron said, causing laughter among the others.
"Come on Potter! I have to go to the bathroom and we have to get to class," Draco urged. Harry nodded and stood up, eager to follow the Slytherin, who quickly disappeared into the bathroom.
"Have you heard of Horcruxes?" he began, and almost immediately Ron and Blaise looked at Hermione, who just shook her head.
"So, you promised me something! What were you going to tell me then, or rather Snape?" he asked. Draco turned his gaze to him and smiled.
"Headmaster, what's going on? Why are you so concerned about this? Once the bond is complete, Harry and Draco can move away from each other again and the lord will never know."
"Piertotum locomotor!" she shouted, and the stone guards of Hogwarts came alive, leaping from their battlements and ledges ready to take orders.
"You're welcome to come," said the young Malfoy, emptying his glass of pumpkin juice and looking at his godfather.
"What do you say when someone sees you like this, that is, in the fancy clothes?" the disembodied voice wanted to know from Harry.
"I know you blame yourself for all of this, but it's not your fault! You never had a choice and Draco probably didn't either, because the bond was always there, we're sure," she said and for a few moments the room remained silent.
"I don't have to," Voldemort said and laughed. Some of the Death Eaters laughed too, including Draco's Aunt Bellatrix. Draco himself couldn't see much behind Harry. He only felt the other's hand squeezing his and preventing him from coming forward again.
"What are those scars on your back?" the Slytherin wanted to know in horror and stepped a little closer.
"Someday I would want to, but right now I only want one thing - Draco. Without him, this makes no sense. It's not my in-between, it's ours," he said and Sirius smiled.
"Sir, I-I have a request," Harry said hesitantly. Snape narrowed his eyes, but said nothing in reply.
"Are you okay?" someone pulled him to his feet. Draco looked at him worriedly. Severus' godson had changed a lot since summer. He was quiet, withdrawn and rarely spoke. He hadn't even been to see him. Hard to believe he was obviously worried about Harry Potter.
"Hellebore wasn't in the recipe, what made you think of that?", Harry wanted to know. Draco jumped up and moved away, but immediately recollected himself when he heard Harry's gasp.
"It doesn't have to, because you know what? I know he'll be there, waiting for you and maybe that's the best comfort for me," Remus said, smiling sadly. Harry nodded and hugged the man as the door opened and Severus stepped into the room, cloak in hand.
"Kingsley, Arthur, are you coming?" he called and the two men broke free of their stiffness and followed the werewolf.
"Oh yeah right...", Harry stuttered and let go of the other's hand. Draco led the way while Harry didn't move. Halfway there, Draco turned around.
Teachers and Order members stood in a line and hardly anyone dared to look at the two boys. Only Professor McGonagall approached them and placed a hand on each of their cheeks.
"I don't know what to wish you either, or not, but ... well you'll be fine and if anything happens, call for help and the room will alert someone," Severus said now, looking at Harry and Draco worriedly.
"We'll be by your side as long as we can, and I'm really happy for you, so about the engagement," he said.
"YOU!" his aunt screamed, pointing her wand at the two boys. But before she could say anything, she was hit by a green light and fell to the ground like a felled tree, her eyes fixed on the sky. Draco looked up and saw his mother standing in front of him with her wand outstretched. Slowly she lowered it and now the last Death Eaters disappeared in panic. Narcissa and Lucius came to their senses and immediately knelt beside Draco, who was still lying over the unconscious Harry and sobbing.
"Potter! Get off your arse, or rather my arse, and come on!" said Snape, no longer dignifying the headmaster with a glance. Harry slumped his shoulders but followed him.
"Yes, and the rest shouldn't be a problem either, except for the unicorn thing and the apparating .... mhm ...", Remus said thoughtfully with the bucket list in his hand.
He startled awake again only a few hours later. Harry beside him was screaming and rolling from side to side. Draco was immediately wide awake, turned on the light and held the struggling Harry by the shoulders.
"Eight. I have to go to class in a minute," Severus said and sat down in the armchair facing the couch.
"Maybe I don't want to forget, though," Severus said, continuing to walk towards the werewolf. He heard Lucius' words echoing in his head,
"I know our relationship has been ... difficult and I'm really sorry. I never really saw how much you got from your mother after all. She would be so proud, I know that," Severus said, visibly dejected. Harry nodded with a smile and stepped hesitantly towards the man. He didn't think twice and embraced the boy.
"Yes, thank you," Draco said and the woman nodded before letting them continue. At the edge of the courtyard, Hagrid stood and sniffled audibly.
"You Miss Parkinson keep working and the next time you verbally attack fellow students you will meet the same fate," Snape hissed and turned back to his lessons.
"Go on, then. I'm turning around," Draco said unnervingly and closed the bathroom door. Harry nodded. He had no other choice. He quickly went to the bathroom and then undressed while Draco stood with his back to him, reading a book. The Slytherin's gaze went briefly to the mirror and he stared. He could see Harry's naked back before he put his shirt on, and it was covered in bruises, or had he just imagined it?
"Yeah, little Weasley's going to be pretty confused when Uncle Sev, gives her the brush-off," Draco said, laughing. Harry looked at him, confused.
"So Madame Pomfrey first or dinner first?" asked Draco as they stood outside the classroom. Harry groaned, he had suppressed the enquiry until just now.
"Er ... yes, thank you," Draco said, visibly embarrassed. Hagrid called them to an end and the Slytherin was glad of it.
"Yes, thank you and if you want you can go and see Mum. She would be pleased to be able to spoil the two of them again," Draco said and pulled Harry close to him.
"Why don't you sit down," Harry said, straightening up a little. The Slytherin looked around searchingly.
"No ... no, if my son has to die, then ... then I want to be with him when it happens," Narcissa said.
"I don't mind if you stay .... say, do you want to come with me tonight when I take the boys to Hogsmeade? We could have a drink in the 'Three Broomsticks' while we wait for them," the teacher asked, unusually nervous. Remus looked at him in surprise, but nodded.
"You can do it darling, do it for Harry," she murmured and then she saw a barely perceptible nod from Draco and it was the best thing she could imagine. Lucius came running to support his wife. The moment the latter pulled Narcissa up, Draco closed his fist around his wand, jumped up and yelled, "STUPOR!" the spell hit Voldemort squarely in the chest. The dark lord was flung through the air and crashed into a tree. Immediately he went down and did not move. Draco stood there breathing heavily, tears streaming down his face. The Death Eaters stared at him, none of them moved, only Bellatrix Lestrange ran to Voldemort and cried out loud immediately afterwards.
"Yes, in a way. You only know him as the strict teacher, but I grew up with him. He's like a second father to me," Draco said dejectedly. Harry slid closer again and rested his head on the other's chest. They intertwined their hands after Draco had turned out the light again.
"Yes, I do, but I'd like to hear it from you," Harry said and slid closer. Draco shook his head and closed the gap between them. Feeling Draco's lips on his was the best feeling Harry had ever felt.
"No, not all of it, but the most important part and ... well, it wasn't the prefect’s bathroom, but..."
"Good. Remus, have the Order help and get the students to safety. Gather them all in the Great Hall and then we'll take them to the dungeons and from there to the secret passages," Dumbledore said. Remus nodded, went to Severus and kissed him briefly.
"Leave it! I promise I won't say anything, but don't try to find an excuse," the watering master said and left the office without turning around again.
"What's worrying you?", Remus Lupin wanted to know and accepted the glass of wine from the waitress.
"Please say Narcissa you're part of the family now!" she said and stroked Harry's dark hair. The latter just couldn't help it, he put his arms around the woman and was now sobbing too. It took a while before he could calm down and then also greet Draco's father.
"I ... ever since we met, or rather, ever since we fell in love, that ... that's when I thought about it. Our bond would never let us be happy with anyone else and ... so ..." said Harry, fighting back tears. Draco stood up and put a hand on his friend's cheek.
"Thank you, then, for doing so much for us," Harry said then hesitantly. Severus took a step towards him and forced himself to smile. He reached out and put a hand on Harry's shoulder.
"Get in there!" he said and pushed the two young men into his flat unseen. Remus Lupin, who had been sitting at the kitchen table, jumped up.
"Severus, you must help me. He'll die otherwise," Madame Pomfrey said and the teacher nodded curtly. Draco lost all sense of time. At some point, Snape's muffled voice reached his ear.
"My dears, you will be working in teams of two today, which I will assign," Horace Slughorn voice switched through the Potions classroom. Everyone present groaned. The advanced course demanded everything of everyone, and Harry was at the top of the class thanks to the Potions book of the Half-Blood Prince that had fallen into his hands by chance, but he couldn't really concentrate here either. All too often, his thoughts drifted to Sirius and the fight in the Ministry.
"Daddy look," Sirius came running out of the kitchen, followed by a smiling Remus. Harry leaned over to his eldest.
"No, it's all right. Don't apologise for it. There is one comfort in all of this for me and that is you and the fact that they will not be alone. I know the Muggles believe in a God and no matter how you feel about it, I don't believe that death is the end. There is something and I hope that wherever that is, they will be happy," he said, brushing the last tears from Remus' cheek.
"Sirius?" gasped Harry, running towards the other. Sirius Black looked as young as Harry had ever seen him. He smiled and shook his head at the same time.
"There you are. Let's go, or we won't get anything to eat before we have to go to Defence," he said.
"Be careful, okay?" he said, then walked past Kingsley and Arthur, who looked confusedly at Severus.
"He's pretty relaxed, isn't he?" asked Blaise then and Draco took his eyes off Harry and looked to him.
"Word of honour," Sirius said, breaking away from Harry. He walked down the beach and took the two children by the hand, who now looked at Harry and waved.
"Yes...um yes I did, but I thought if I turned around now I'd never leave," Draco nodded and fell silent. A time passed when all that could be heard was the sound of the rushing water and the calls of the seagulls. At some point, as if out of nowhere, Draco knelt down and slid closer to Harry.
At the end of the lesson, Harry pushed through his back. The day was long and not yet over. They still had to go to "Ancient Runes". He already had great respect for Draco's workload. They climbed into the South Tower and Harry yawned heartily when they arrived at the classroom.
"Um...I've never seen anything more beautiful. It's great!" he said and looked down at the beach again.
"How much longer do you think it will take?", Harry wanted to know at one point and his friend looked up from his plate.
"No, it would be better if the two of them returned to their ... well, one of the houses," said Dumbledore.
"Sit down and be quiet," Hagrid said and hesitantly the students lowered themselves into the soft grass.
"Yes, we didn't know anything about it either until recently...", Draco said and began haltingly. Ron, Hermione and Blaise became paler and paler and at some point Hermione sobbed. Immediately Ron put an arm around her shoulder. Blaise, too, was visibly fighting tears.
"Although it will no longer matter, I give a thousand points each to Gryffindor and Slytherin for indescribable sacrifice," she said in a trembling voice. Harry had never seen the so tough tutor so fragile.
"Good, you can get dressed. I'll give you some ointments to help with the scars and some potions so we can get your weight under control," the medicine witch said, also looking uncomfortable in her skin. She looked helpfully at Severus, who nodded briefly and then sat down on the bed opposite the two boys while Madame Pomfrey left the room.
Two days passed and Harry and Draco's condition worsened. In the meantime, they had to maintain skin contact, for the pain could hardly be endured any other way. Severus and also Madame Pomfrey saw this with deep concern. Severus had asked the Malfoys for a talk the next day, even though he still had no idea how to make them understand that their son had to die next to Harry. For the last few days he had been looking for a way out, but had found none. He had even considered taking the boys away, but that would not stop Voldemort. So the Potions Master allowed himself to be seen very little in the hospital wing, for it was becoming increasingly difficult for him to look Harry and Draco in the eye. Nevertheless, he came here that evening, because Poppy had sent for him.
"Are you there?" he murmured and a tap against his shoulder was the answer. Quickly he climbed the stairs and turned left on the first floor. He stopped in front of a door and knocked three times. It only took a moment, then it was opened for him.
"I bribed Peeves. He's distracting Filch, we should have a clear path," Blaise said and led the way.
"Oh yes ... um, come on Harry," Draco said and stood up and Harry also rose and reached for his cloak.
"Harry, don't let it get you down!" said Dumbledore encouragingly. Harry nodded quickly before rushing after Snape.
"What are you doing?", Draco was there immediately and was about to pull him back down by the leg, but then he reconsidered, because he definitely didn't want to make a mistake right now.
"Potter? Poppy it's me, what happened?" asked Snape, sitting up in bed. His vision was still blurred and he rubbed his eyes.
"No, it's the last thing they want to do and even though they're both very young, we both know they won't grow old together," Severus said bitterly.
"Speaking of mortal danger. How's work?" Severus looked questioningly at Harry. The latter rolled his eyes.
"Sit down," he said now and pointed to the seating area in front of the fireplace. Hesitantly Remus followed and looked in wonder at the Slytherin and Gryffindor cloaks lying on the backrest. Severus followed his gaze and took the things.
"Yes, that counts," Draco said with a smile. Suddenly, something glowing could be seen moving between the trees. The boys stopped and then they saw it - a unicorn. The animal was barely five metres away and eyed the two intruders suspiciously. Neither of them dared to move when the animal suddenly came closer. Harry cautiously reached out his hand and the unicorn immediately nestled its head against it. Gently Harrys stroked it and immediately he felt a little lighter, less sad.
"Do you hear the rustling? It's almost like the rustling of the wind in the leaves of the Forbidden Forest, but it's louder, much louder. It splashes, thunders and the water slaps against the rocks. The wind carries the calls of seagulls far into the land. It smells of salt and seaweed. Your feet sink into the fine sand and the water runs over them. The waves pull at your feet, but you stop. The sun makes the sea glitter as if diamonds were floating on it. Children run up and down laughing, trying to catch the waves. We walk arm in arm behind them. The sun is slowly setting and all is well," he concluded. Harry in his arms had fallen asleep. Draco smiled sadly, kissed his husband's temple and pulled a blanket over them both.
"B-But why ... so I don't understand why one of them suffer pain when they are only a few metres apart."
"No, and I'm not going to tell them just yet. Draco has enough to suffer from being chained to Potter," Severus said dismissively.
"And you were already worried that they wouldn't be pleased," he said. Harry smiled and kissed Draco on the cheek.
"We're here!" the shout made everyone whirl around. In the doorway to the Great Hall, Draco and Harry stood hand in hand. They came closer and now stood in the middle of the huge hall, surrounded by teachers and students.
"Don't worry Harry, we'll fix it. Tell me, do you know where the mistake in your potion might have been?" Harry swallowed hard.
"A few liquorice snappers. Gellert always liked those, too. Well then, see you!" he then said and disappeared before the boys could say anything else in reply.
"Your heroism is appreciated, Potter, but it doesn't have to come to that. I understand that this situation is not easy, but ... but there might be a way that you two could at least move away from each other," Severus said, inwardly cursing himself for mentioning it, it would only complicate things.
"It's true, I didn't talk to anyone about it either, but I wasn't alone. I had a mother who loved me and helped me get over a lot. I never slept in a cupboard, I always had food to eat and clothes that fitted me. Yes, I didn't have an entirely beautiful childhood, but I had one."
"I know, but tell me, do you care a little about him after all these years?", Snape turned and glared angrily at the man.
"Soon, but let them bind first, their love may give them strength. It won't be long now. Two days ago the snake was killed and now Tom has nothing to lose."
"You do it," said the Gryffindor and his friend nodded. Together they walked up and down the wall three times and a door appeared. It was made of dark wood and Draco opened it smiling. Harry looked around the room in amazement. It was quite large, but somehow cosy. In the middle was a large four-poster bed made of dark wood. The walls were painted a soft grey and a fluffy carpet, also grey, lay in front of the bed. Two old-fashioned armchairs in Slytherin green stood in front of the burning fireplace. Posters of Quidditch teams hung on the walls and there was another door next to the bed.
"Let's get this over with!" he said, stepping onto one of the markers. Harry nodded in disappointment and stood on the other side of the Slytherin.
"I promise," he said and then looked at Draco, who now had tears running down his cheeks. Severus hugged him and now even the usually cool Potions Master was crying.
"Yeah yeah, but it's not a habit. I am not a hotel. So boys, no more pain?" the teacher wanted to know.
"Not yet!" the teacher said cynically and helped him up. Harry felt his body and breathed a sigh of relief.
"I bet you'll think of something," Remus grinned. Severus shook his head with a smile, reached for his shoes and leaned towards Remus once more.
"Yes, I'm Draco's godfather and I agree with him, it's not going to happen Mr. Potter. We don't know what would happen to Draco."
"Yes, all right, but I can show you the movement, that is the technique, and now come," Remus said, pointing to the table.
"Sure professor! All your fault Potter!" hissed Draco and disappeared from the room. Harry looked after him, aghast. He knew it was just an act, but it still stung him.
"All right, I won't say anything, but I will make sure it is discovered. I have a duty of care and I can't just ignore it," the teacher said. Draco sighed but nodded.
"It seems so. I can't explain it exactly, but the potion seems to have the effect that if Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter move more than two metres away from each other, they both suffer pain. Why they are so severe in one and only slight in the other, I cannot say. The fact is that Mr Potter could die from it if I interpret the readings he had earlier correctly," Madame Pomfrey concluded. Draco looked at Harry, stunned.
"What is it? You don't have to be ashamed or anything, there's nothing there that I haven't seen before," he said as nonchalantly as possible, even if he himself didn't feel one hundred percent comfortable.
"Certainly Mr. Malfoy," Severus said, waving his wand under the table. There was now a silence spell over them, but there were hardly any guests left in the inn anyway.
"Potter ... Harry, I messed up the potion, I alone and that's why we're sitting here, isn't it?", Harry sighed.
"Yes, I do. You know Dray, we're going to die together either way, no matter what we decide, but with the bond we might have another hundred wonderful years, but without ..." said Harry. Draco nodded with a smile, leaned forward and kissed him. Severus rose.
"I can't, because you won't believe this, but I'm in a lot of pain now too," Draco said and Harry turned to him. The other was pale and holding his stomach.
"What, why don't you tell us?", Draco wanted to know angrily, not bothering to use the formal ‚professor‘. Severus stood up and ran his hand through his hair.
"Hey Malfoy, I'm sure your children will be quite pretty. Blonde and bespectacled," another now called out and the Slytherin saw red. He ran towards the students but they hurried away and Draco gave chase, realising too late what he was doing. Only the burning and a scream from Neville made him stop. He must have been a good fifty metres from Harry. The Gryffindor was lying on the floor, writhing.
"Hey, we'll do it," he said, kissing the Gryffindor gently. The latter now nodded and let Draco pull him to his feet. Despite their holding hands, they both felt the slight pain. To move even half a metre away from each other was almost impossible. Outside the door, Severus waited for them and nodded.
"Get up, take a shower and eat something. Let's just live moment to moment, okay?", Draco held out his hand to Harry and he reached for it.
"I have to take care of the potion, the quicker we can escape this arrangement and you can do the assignments without having attended class," the teacher said, taking a bite of Harry's food.
They walked silently through the quiet corridors of the school. When they entered the hall, all eyes turned to them and silence fell. Harry realised that word had already spread around the school about what had happened. Hunching his shoulders, he followed Draco to the Slytherin table. He sat down next to Blaise, who had apparently saved them a seat. Draco gave everyone present a withering look and it seemed to work. Everyone returned to eating, but not without watching the two young men every now and then. Draco filled his plate while Harry, next to him, merely poured himself some water.
"Yes ... All right. Then come to school just before eight. Maybe you'll put an illusion on yourselves. There should be hardly any students in the corridors at that time, but better safe than sorry. The ceremony will take place in the Room of Requirement, I assume you know where that is," Severus said with a smile.
"I don't know, but maybe Sev ... er, Snape wants to bring the up to date," Harry said. They sat down at the Gryffindor table and Ron leaned towards his best friend.
"That was Mum, she wanted to kill us both and ... and that's when Mum killed her first. Don't look like that, she wasn't my aunt or Mum's sister for a long time, she was just mad. Anyway, they burnt both bodies and there was a lot going on here after that. Press, the ministry and stuff. The school closed for a fortnight and everyone left, well almost everyone. The teachers are still here and so are Hermione, Ron, Blaise and Remus. Oh, and so are my parents. None of them wanted to leave you here alone," Harry nodded, touched, and kissed Draco gently. Suddenly they heard a clearing of the throat behind them. Madame Pomfrey was standing by the bed in her dressing gown and smiling.
Severus walked through the empty and silent corridors of the school. It was curfew and no students were outside the common rooms. He turned two corners and then climbed the stairs to the hospital wing. When he entered, Harry and Draco were already sitting side by side on the edge of the bed.
"No, I have to eat with Professor Snape," he said curtly, turned and ran into the dungeons. Some of the Slytherins he met made snide comments. In his mind, Severus marked them for detention. As he turned the last corner, he suddenly tripped over a leg. He saw another laughing Crabbe running away and cursed.
"Oh yes! Can we blast something again then?" the boy exclaimed, hopping up onto the couch with Severus. Draco and Harry looked at the man, who smiled apologetically.
"We'll handle it. Stay with Harry," Lee Jordan said, addressing Hermione and Ron, whose job it actually was to lead the Gryffindors into the dungeons. Gratefully, they both nodded.
"Because her sister Bellatrix let herself be seduced by Tom Riddle and fell for him, and Mum wanted to save her. But since last year, since ... you know what happened to your godfather, she's very sorry about that and she realised that she couldn't save Bellatrix anymore or even wanted to because one thing the Malfoys and Blacks hold very dear is family and you don't kill or hurt members of that family and Sirius was family," Draco concluded. Harry didn't say anything for some time. The memory of Sirius pained him and he could hardly put into words his hatred for Bellatrix Lestrange, even though she was Draco's aunt.
"Do you remember the last time Draco slept by us?" asked Lucius in a whisper, turning out the light.
"Yes, that too, but not without risk, but I can't deny them that," Severus said. They were silent again for a while, only their footsteps on the sandy path could be heard. It was completely dark by now and they shone their wands. At some point Severus stopped and Remus turned around irritated and went back.
"I assume your legs look similar," Madame Pomfrey said gently. Harry was still staring at the floor, but nodded stiffly.
At breakfast, Harry sat at the Slytherin table again. He was not in the mood to argue with Draco and so he just waved at Ron and Hermione again. After all, they would see each other in class.
"All right, Potter's cloak of invisibility must be good for something. I'll bring them to you, but please go now," the teacher said. Lucius nodded and pulled his wife to her feet.
"I've never been more sure," he said and Draco nodded, blindly reaching beside him for the jar of oil again. Carefully he wet his erection with it and had to pull himself together hard not to come immediately.
"Thanks Mum," Draco said and Harry nodded. Severus meanwhile had the cloak of invisibility in his hand and threw it over the two of them.
"You wish!" said Harry, raising his wand in turn. Nothing happened. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't - couldn't hurt Draco.
"Okay, now I'm even more worried, what's going on?", Remus wanted to know. Severus sat down with a sigh and told everything that had happened in the last days and hours. At some point the werewolf had jumped up and was pacing restlessly up and down the flat. When Severus told him about the Horcrux and its aftermath, Remus turned paler than ever and slumped back on the couch.
"Draco, are you all right?" Severus wanted to know anxiously. The Slytherin nodded absently and stared at Harry, who was apparently unconscious, only a metre away from him.
"Don't be scared, okay?", Draco took his shirt and pulled it over as he looked worriedly at Harry, who still hadn't moved.
"Hey ...", he said, visibly embarrassed, and immediately found himself pressed against the sobbing Narcissa's chest.
"W-Why? Why shouldn't I just let it end here? I'll always be just the golden boy, always just the boy who survived and yet it would be better for everyone if I wasn't here anymore because then maybe Voldemort would stop killing everyone I've ever loved," Harry said and his despair, his pain was almost tangible with his bare hands. Draco shook his head and moved a little closer again and even though they were so close, the burning in his chest was ever-present.
"Don't worry, without the Lord they are like chickens without heads. They will flee faster than we can look," Severus said.
"Mhm ... the Malfoys are a very, very old magic family. Pure blood was always important to them. My father, however, always saw it differently. He was, or is, of the opinion that if we relied only on pure blood, there would soon be hardly any wizards and witches left. He could not express this in his family. That he joined the Dark Lord was sort of taken for granted. And then he met my mum, at Hogwarts. The Blacks were also a very old family, and their connection was more or less preordained, but they really loved and love each other. Mum has the views of the Blacks, just like .... like Sirius and Andromeda always despised, but unlike Sirius and her sister, she complied to do something in secret. Especially because ..."
"How are you?" Narcissa wanted to know and now sat down with her husband in one of the armchairs that stood in the room. Draco shrugged his shoulders helplessly.
"Come," he said, visibly tense, and the boys followed him. They walked silently through the silent corridors of the school and with every step Harry became more nervous. He felt the pressure of Draco's hand and yet he fought against the fear and nervousness. He didn't even notice how they stopped in front of the stone wall that hid the Room of Requirement.
"Poppy, the pains are getting worse. If they don't have skin contact, then they are always felt," Severus explained briefly. The medi-witch nodded, stepped over to Harry and Draco and let her wand wander over them.
"All right, but you don't have to rush into anything. Until then, you'll stay here in Poppy's care. We'll find you a ... a suitable room for you, but not today and not tomorrow, all right?"
"I don't know, but I have this unsure feeling that we should go to this detention urgently," Blaise said. Hermione nodded.
Harry didn't know why he had told about it. In reality, he was flooded with Snape's memories all day. Whenever he relaxed a little and tried not to think about anything. The more he tried to block out the memories, the more violently they came. Snape had not had a pleasant childhood and youth. His father was violent and drank. His mother loved Snape, but she was depressed and certainly seemed to withdraw more and more. They both died shortly after each other and Snape was alone. In addition, there was the harassment by the maruders and the loss of Lily as a friend. Harry also kept seeing Remus in front of him. It seemed Snape had a special relationship with the werewolf. Sighing, Harry skimmed Snape's notes from class and found that the teacher had been very thorough and so he had no problems completing the homework. He was tired and hoped Snape's offer was serious. He went into the bathroom and undressed. It was no use. He desperately needed a shower and resolved to get it over with quickly. After all, he had to admit that Snape was more well-trained than he had assumed. However, he didn't really know how to deal with the shoulder-length hair. Apparently Snape was always putting something in his hair, but Harry didn't know what, so he just let it dry without anything and thought it looked better anyway.
"So now go to bed. Breakfast will be here tomorrow. Good night," Severus said and turned away. Harry and Draco stepped into the room. It was small, but it was enough. The bed was even slightly bigger than the one in Draco and Blaise's room. Their trunks were already in a corner.
"What am I doing Fawkes? We can't just let two lives end like this, would it be worth it?", the bird tilted its head and let out a sad melody.
"The bathroom is there and otherwise, you know where to find me. I'll have something to eat brought to you and I'll check on you later. Severus, a word please," she said and left the room. The teacher nodded and then looked at Harry and Draco.
"Sir, we really didn't duel and ...," Blaise began when Snape had closed the door, but he raised his arm.
"It ... I don't know, I have to sort something out. They're in good hands here. I'll come in the morning!"
"You think you always have to do everything alone because you've always been alone, but you haven't been for a long time. Sirius didn't die because of you, he died for you and for the wizarding world. Do you think he would want you to just throw your life away now? Besides, it's not just your choice. Judging by the pain I was in earlier, I'm sure I'd die too if you died, so we might as well do it together!" said Draco firmly, yet with knees as soft as they'd ever been. He meant every word, but he only wanted one thing, for Harry to get off the wall.
Harry awoke to someone shaking him by the shoulder. Difficulty he opened his eyes and looked into Draco's stormy grey ones. For a moment he was paralysed before he realised that the other was talking to him.
When they came out of the bathroom half an hour later, there was breakfast on the table in the kitchen. It was late morning by now and Snape was in class, but there was a note on the table: "You stay in this rooms. Do your homework and eat, that's all. Harry, take the potions! I'll come around 5pm and we'll talk then! - Severus," Draco read out and rolled his eyes.
"That thing you said on the tower, t-that we ... that you had feelings for me, was that true?" he then wanted to know, barely audibly. Draco smiled, leaned forward and bridged the last few inches. The first kiss between them, felt like electricity suddenly coursing through their veins. It was as if they had always been made for each other. It took a while before they broke away. Both had red cheeks and just looked at each other.
"Sure and well who knows, maybe there's no other way," Draco said, looking around and reaching for Harry's hand. They both looked at each other almost simultaneously, completely dumbfounded.
"So let's go and feed our Blast-Ended Skrewt and be done with it," Hagrid now said quickly. Groaning, the students stood up and followed the half-giant back to the hut.
"This is between you and me Tom, so you do what you have to do, but you don't touch Draco!" he shouted in the face of the wand.
"I came right after you. When I got to the top, I thought I'd let you sort it out on your own. I wanted to intervene as soon as he was on the wall, but Minerva joined in and said it was too dangerous. It was only when he was about to climb down and then hesitated that we intervened."
"By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you one! You may kiss each other," Dumbledore said and even the usually strong headmaster had a single tear running down his cheek, surprising even himself. Draco closed his eyes and lowered his lips to Harry's. Here and now, only the two of them mattered. Only muffled did they perceive the clapping of the others and the clearly audible sobbing of Narcissa and also Hermione. They looked up and Dumbledore raised his wand. Suddenly a coloured stone appeared on each of their rings. On Harry's ring shone one in a storm grey, the same colour as Draco's eyes and on his was now a gemstone in emerald green, as green as Harry's eyes. The two smiled and kissed one more time. At some point they broke away from each other and were surrounded by their friends first.
"Of course, I treated him with potions after all, and I am very grateful that you seem to have taken quite good care of my body as well, only the hair..."
"Alright then, since this year, I see him differently. It's hard and so far only Blaise knows about it and...", Harry's mind raced. What was Draco trying to tell him? Was it what he thought it was? His heart suddenly leapt back into place.
"Do your timetables actually fit together?" wanted to know Pansy Parkinson, who was sitting opposite them. Neither Harry nor Draco had thought of that before. They almost attended the same N.E.W.T. classes, but only almost.
"Sit down there on the bed," he said, and the two of them did as they were told and immediately grabbed each other's hands again. Worried, Severus saw that they were breathing clearly, which meant that the pain was probably getting worse. It took a quarter of an hour before Madame Pomfrey came to them.
"You'd better not tell anyone," he said, then everything was quiet. Harry turned over as well and soon he was asleep.
"I think they're fine. Don't worry about it. Good night and you'll find everything you need in the cupboard in the bedroom," the potions master said, then he was gone. Remus sighed deeply, emptied his water glass, took off his worn jacket and went into the bathroom.
"He knew it, he knew it all along. He only raised the boy to die. I knew Dumbledore would stop at nothing, but that ... by Salazar he ... they're just children," Lucius said exhaustedly.
"Mhm ... you have my respect and Hermione too," Harry said and looked around. The class was quite empty and besides Draco and Hermione, there were only three Ravenclaws and two Slytherins sitting in the small room. Professor Babbling nodded briefly at Harry with a smile and then began the lesson. The Gryffindor hardly noticed anything, he didn't understand much anyway. While the students struggled through a translation, he began the homework. After all, there weren't many that day. After two hours, the lesson ended and so did the school day.
"We were talking about moving in together, so I was talking about moving in with him, and about taking Harry in for good, and about having children..., " Remus laughed bitterly, put down his glass and looked at Severus.
"DRACO!!!" screamed Neville as the others knelt beside Harry. Immediately Draco ran back and sank down on the floor beside Harry, panting. The latter was by now unconscious. Blood was running from his mouth and his breathing was shallow and rapid.
"He's dreaming," Draco said quickly as his uncle stepped up to the bed and now also made an effort to wake the young man.
"They are two lives, Headmaster. If you're already condemning them to death, then don't forget that," Severus said and stood up.
"Now, in the meantime, they can hardly be apart from each other without being in severe pain. Only through skin contact are they free of pain at all."
"All well?" he asked Harry, who nodded. The Slytherin walked on and was now standing at the door, much more than two metres away.
"So go slowly into the water until you are deep enough to lie on your back. Don't worry, I've got my hands under you, nothing will happen," Draco explained and led the way. Still hesitant, Harry followed him. The water was pleasantly warm in the small bay, but despite everything he had goose bumps. When he could just stand, Harry lay down on his back and spread his arms. Draco was right, the water was carrying him. He felt the other's hands on his back and enjoyed the feeling of weightlessness.
"Damn complicated this potion," he muttered more to himself than to Harry. Harry looked at his book and couldn't help but agree with Malfoy. There wasn't a line where the half-blood prince hadn't left a note, but how was he going to explain that to Malfoy? Harry decided to keep it to himself. He wouldn't risk the book because of a potion, because Malfoy would definitely betray him.
"Come on, talk to me," he asked. Harry looked up. He didn't know why, but suddenly he began to talk.
"Harry! Wake up, you're dreaming!" he said, shaking the other's shoulder. Draco tried more and more desperately to wake Harry, until he startled up and pressed his hand on the scar on his forehead.
"It was nice there and peaceful, but ... no I don't think so. I have friends and it wouldn't have been fair to any of them if I had stayed. Sometimes it might really be easier to give up instead of fighting, but not today."
"We are here today to marry two young people who were probably always meant for each other. Two people who found each other and give each other support in times when all hope seems lost. But is it? In every parting there is a piece of hope, hope for a way forward and that is why we stand here today. Harry and Draco have chosen to say their own vows," Dumbledore concluded, looking at the young men invitingly. They turned to each other and took each other's hands in theirs.
"Move away a few steps," Madame Pomfrey now instructed the young man. He did as he was told, while the medi-witch kept an eye on Harry. After Draco had walked a little more than two metres, Harry's pain began again. Immediately and without prompting, Draco ran back to the bed.
"All right, to the hospital wing first," said the Gryffindor. When they arrived there, Severus Snape seemed to have already been waiting for them. Harry looked at Draco, who just shrugged his shoulders, but was already feeling very uncomfortable.
"Are you really going to make him sleep on the floor?", Blaise wanted to know when they had all finished.
"Yes, you are right. If Voldemort finds out about this, he will do everything he can to separate the two and kill Harry that way. So what do you suggest?"
"Yes, I go to Madame Pomfrey's and come here every night after dinner. I haven't forgotten," Harry said. He hesitated briefly, but then went to the teacher again and gave him a quick hug.
"This between us, do you really want that or is it just an anchor right now?" asked Remus visibly uncomfortable. Severus tilted his head, understanding what Remus meant, and took a deep breath for a moment.
"We still don't know exactly how the soul band works. Maybe he'll live a while longer...", Lucius said.
"I need to tell you a little bit about you-know-who and I want you to just listen to me for now, all right?" asked Snape and Harry and Draco nodded.
"I knew you liked to keep things to yourself, but I didn't think you'd be so stupid as to keep something like this a secret," Harry heard his own voice say coldly. He quivered with anger, what did Snape know.
"No, it wasn't. The bond of ours has always been there, I know it, and I would have died too if you were, whether I knew it or not," he said, stroking Harry's cheek gently.
"BACK!" screamed Madame Pomfrey, but Draco could hardly move. Severus immediately grabbed him by the arm and literally threw him onto the bed next to Harry.
"Yes, that's right. Thanks Blaise," the Slytherin nodded, took another deep breath and then followed Ron and Hermione.
Draco had held Harry close to him. So they lay in bed together and were silent. Unconsciously, Draco kept stroking Harry's hand, which he held and pressed against his chest. He could feel his friend's fast heartbeat and even though he felt the same, he only wanted one thing - to calm Harry down.
"Take care of yourself," Harry growled, but the Ravenclaws kept going. Draco was seething with anger.
"Hey thanks guys, but I'll be fine. I ... I'll go ahead to Potions, see you in a minute," Harry said and stood up. His gaze briefly wandered over to Draco, who by now was also sitting at the Slytherin table, looking just as unhappy as he was. For a moment their eyes met and Harry's whole body tingled, but only for a moment, then Draco averted his eyes and Harry quickly ran out of the hall.
"So now you again," Draco said, handing his friend the quill. Harry thought about it and felt his heart beating against his ribs. There was one thing he wanted that seemed unattainable. Trembling, he set the quill down and wrote. Draco leaned forward and faltered as he read what it said.
"Hey, come to Grandpa Severus, Lily!", Severus took Lily in his arms again and strutted towards the dining room.
Soon the hall had emptied except for the few who remained behind. The Order made plans as to how they could most safely set up protection, not realising that it might not be necessary. Draco and Harry stood at the edge of the hall, along with Ron, Hermione, Blaise, Snape and Remus.
"It's about Potter and Draco ...", the latter said and summarised everything briefly. Dumbledore remained silent the entire time, then sighed and sat down behind his desk.
"We've been married since yesterday and if anyone here wants to turn my husband in, they'll have to get past me first," Draco now said, pulling Harry close to him.
"It's all right ... but it would be great if you could stop running away," Harry said, holding his stomach. Draco nodded and at the same moment Dumbledore and Madame Pomfrey entered the room, followed by Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape.
"Yeah, sure," Harry said, trying a weak smile. He looked over at Hermione and Ron, who waved encouragingly at him. Harry nodded and tried not to look quite so downcast.
"The first time I held you, your parents had just died and all I ever wanted to do was protect you. Yes, you were special and I was fascinated and too often I forgot that you were just a child looking for a place in life. You, uh... you have to believe that I was looking for a solution when I found out and maybe I should have said it earlier, but then..."
"I rather sank. It was all the gillyweed, if I hadn't pulled myself out of the water at the end by Dumbledore and Bagman, I would have drowned miserably. No one ever showed it to me," he tried to explain. Draco looked at him for a long moment, seeming to weigh up what to say. The fact that Harry had had a terrible childhood was hard for him to bear. He didn't want to believe it at first, didn't want to believe that the boy who had always seemed confident and strong to him had actually been a severely abused child.
"Oh ... mhm ... OK, I'll try. So when you're on top, you have to be careful above all and pay close attention to your partner's signals. It's not painless for this one, but if you're gentle, then the pain is soon forgotten. The important thing is preparation and lube."
"Thank you ... I know he'll be fine," he said, turning and leaving the lonely graveyard in Godric's Hollow.
"It's medicine, it's not supposed to taste," the healer said with a smile and let her wand wander over the young man.
"I'm sorry, I ... for Merlin’s sake Potter, I don't know either, I must have slipped or something," he said and sat down again.
"I've already thought about that, but it wouldn't change anything. Voldemort would plunge England into chaos and violence. It's not just about Harry anymore, it's about all our futures. The Lord knows nothing of this Horcrux, he has nothing to lose since the snake died. If he knew, he would hunt Harry to the end of the world and then lock him up. No, it has to end, no matter what ..." he had almost whispered the last sentence. Remus shook his head and tears ran down his cheeks. Severus hesitated briefly, but then put an arm around the werewolf's shoulder.
"Leave me, I can stand on my own," he growled and straightened up again. His gaze fell on the two young men lying on the ground.
"M-Make that again," he gasped. Draco grinned and did as he was told. Again Harry moaned indignantly, he had the feeling that his whole body was electrified. Without him noticing, Draco added a third finger and Harry could no longer think straight. Draco kissed him deeply, devouring every sound.
"Severus, we ... they can't wait any longer. Their bodies can't take much more of this. By now they are in slight pain despite the physical contact and without ... They can't go on like this. The pain potions aren't helping anymore," she said quietly. Severus ran his hand through his hair and nodded.
"Shhh ... quietly," said Hagrid. Very slowly both animals came closer and the mare touched each one briefly with her muzzle. She stopped in front of Harry for a long time and Hagrid smiled.
"Don't stare," Draco hissed at the surrounding students, grabbing Harry's upper arm rudely and dragging him towards the dungeons. Wordlessly, he pushed him into the Slytherin common room. Those present stared at them, but no one said anything.
"Because I asked him to. I knew nothing about the wizarding world. I only knew that all the black wizards so far were in Slytherin and the man who killed my parents. I'm sure you understand that I didn't really want to go to that house."
"I don't know. Not so great, but not really bad either. I'm sorry," Draco then said contritely and Harry looked at him in irritation.
"All right, but it doesn't solve the fundamental problem that the two are connected. How sure are you about the soul bond?" asked Dumbledore thoughtfully.
"Not better, but not much worse. However, without skin contact the pain is so strong that we can hardly ignore it anymore," the Slytherin said and Severus nodded with a sigh.
"All right. Potter there and Malfoy on the other side," she said and Ron led Harry to the bed. Shortly afterwards he was in a terrible state. His chest was burning, every bone ached. He gasped and felt like he was tearing up inside.
"Yes, but there's a reason for that," Draco said and then looked at Harry, who swallowed hard and then nodded.
"You've messed up again. What else could I have expected. It was a mistake to put you on the advanced course..."
"Yes, I thought something like that and of course, Narcissa and Lucius want to come to the wedding too."
"You confuse courage with the will to survive. I am not courageous. I had to be in order to survive, but I don't think it's necessarily in my nature."
"All right?" asked Hermione quietly as they were busy repotting some potent herbs. Draco, who was of course standing close to Harry, pretended not to be there and was talking to Blaise. Harry glanced at him briefly and then nodded.
"Maybe," Remus said, emptying his glass. Severus took it from him and brought them both into the kitchen, then leaned against the wall and looked at the other thoughtfully.
"That's behind us, okay? I don't want to think about it any more, just here and now," Harry said and Severus nodded.
"Strange, isn't it?" Harry wanted to know, now crawling onto the bed and leaning against the back wall. Draco also lay down and looked up at the ceiling.
"I don't know. Sometime between Sirius' death, the adoption and now. We spent so much time together last summer and then...then he threw himself in front of me in the fight against Voldemort. Whenever I think of him, everything pulls together, I miss him..."
"We're kind of trying to enjoy the time we have left," Harry said quietly, looking down at the floor.
Quietly, Severus Snape closed the door of the room. The boys had not noticed him, he had come in shortly after Draco had asked if Harry was afraid. Now he stood in front of the door again and leaned against the warm wood, sighing. Like Merlin, two sixteen year olds should be told they had to die, and involuntarily Severus now saw Lucius and Narcissa before him and knew that this conversation was going to be the hardest he had ever had. He pushed himself away from the door and set off to send an owl.
"Which Ravenclaws?" asked Harry with a smile, and immediately Ron, Hermione and Blaise turned around, but instead of the two students, Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy were now standing next to Snape and Remus.
"We meet again," the Gryffindor said, addressing the two men, and left the hall with Draco without turning around again.
Harry and Draco were lying arm in arm on a blanket in the soft grass. Stars were now moving along the ceiling and the leaves of the birch trees seemed to rustle softly.
"I know, but it would be dangerous for both of you otherwise. But yes I understand you, after all you are soul mates," Blaise whispered and stopped when he felt Slughorn's scrutinising gaze on him.
"Were those the Muggles?" he saw immediately from the look on Harry's face that he was right. The Gryffindor lowered himself to the floor and drew his knees up. Draco sat down in front of him.
"Yeah, well, if ... if my parents had asked for it. You have to know, in the old magic families traditions are held very high, but apparently my parents are cooler than I thought."
"Cissa, you can't do that today, it would completely confuse him. All right, come to Hogsmeade tomorrow evening and get a room at the 'Three Broomsticks'. I'll bring him to you ..."
"Why fight? He wants Potter, why don't we give him to him?", the call came from Pansy Parkinson, who was standing with the Slytherins.
"I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to yell at you. I know that's what your father used to do. I'm sorry," Harry said abruptly, but didn't dare look up. Severus stared at him.
They had just walked a few metres towards the castle when several seventh year Ravenclaw overtook them.
"Yes, I'm afraid that just makes it all the worse," Dumbledore said with a sigh, sinking back into his chair.
"We thought we'd take a trip. Dumbledore has given you both an extra two weeks off from classes and how about a few weeks at the seaside?" asked Lucius.
"On time, there you go. Follow me!" he said. Irritated, Harry and Draco looked at each other but ran after the man. Severus was still trying to collect himself and had decided he didn't want to have this conversation in the anonymous classroom. By now the corridors were also empty and only a few of the trust students were still on the move when they reached the dungeons.
"Listen carefully Potter, it may be that you think you're a hero or whatever, but this..." he pointed to the scar again. "...This is not something you can keep to yourself. This is torture and it's forbidden! Umbridge must be held accountable for this!"
"I don't know, but I think in the end it's up to the boys to decide, we can only try to stand by them," he said, feeling his wife's nod on his shoulder.
"Better, isn't it?" asked Harry, who could see perfectly well that Draco's pain must have subsided too.
"H-how many are there?" asked Harry and again the teacher sighed, looked at Remus and stood up to walk a few paces up and down the room.
"Yes, more or less. However, the lord only gets information from me that is not really decisive for the war."
"Remus, I know how I feel about you and yes, maybe it's an anchor right now too, but I don't plan on letting that 'anchor' go ever again," he said with a smile and breathed a kiss on the werewolf's lips.
"Um ... yes, Sirius left me the Black house, but ... I can't live there ... it ...", Harry faltered, trying to fight down the tears that were now falling non-stop. Draco bit his lips, it was tearing him apart to see Harry like this.
"Look at it as an opportunity. Maybe you can sort out your conflicts," he whispered to the teacher. The teacher rolled his eyes but said nothing.
"Y-Yes please," Draco said quickly and Severus climbed through the hidden entrance that connected his flat to the potions classroom. Since Slughorn taught here, he usually took the normal entrance, but this way he could get Blaise, Hermione and Ron into his flat with as little fuss as possible. He collected himself for a moment, then opened the classroom door and looked into the visibly worried faces of the two Gryffindors and Blaise.
"Hey," he said, smiling wanly. Draco shook his head, tears falling on Harry's chest. He leaned forward and kissed the Gryffindor. A kiss salty of tears and yet the best they could both imagine.
Draco found it hard to sleep. All this had taken more out of him than he would have thought at the beginning. His eyes kept wandering to Harry, who had not let go of his hand. The longer he held it, the longer Draco thought about everything, the more certain he was of his feelings for the other. If he was honest, he had kind of liked him from the beginning. He had liked the way he had countered him in the beginning, their little fights, the teasing, it had all been kind of fun too. Draco had only realised in the last year that he liked boys more than girls and now he was pretty sure that his feelings were not wrong. Yes, he loved Harry and his biggest fear was that he had already destroyed this love at the beginning with one stupid mistake.
"Well, then ... let's go," Draco said and reached for Harry's hand. Hermione sobbed and immediately Harry pulled her into his arms.
"Remus, I told you I don't hold a grudge against you, really! I ... I love you, I really do and your, my, our past doesn't matter anymore," for a moment Remus looked at the other in complete surprise, then he leaned forward and kissed Severus gently.
"Did you hear that Lily? Well, I think Grandpa Sev really needs detention again!" he said and the little girl grinned at him.
"So, when ... when are you going to do ... it," Ron asked, skipping Hermione's shake of the head. Harry grinned.
Severus and the boys walked back to Hogwarts in silence. Harry sensed his fiancé fighting his deep despair and the ever-present fear that this meeting might be the last with his parents. Gently, he stroked the back of his hand with his thumb as they followed the teacher, always staring down the path. Severus was also lost in thought. He hadn't spoken to Remus about it, but he was wondering if he should tell them that he and the werewolf were now a couple, or if they should keep it to themselves, because for now it should just be about Harry and Draco. So in thought, he had soon reached his flat.
"I nearly always have nightmares," he said softly and closed his eyes. Draco swallowed hard and automatically stroked the back of Harry's hand soothingly before he too fell asleep again.
"When Lily threw herself before Harry and gave her life for his, she created the ultimate protection ..."
"I didn't say anything, but Uncle Sev was worried about your nightmares. He could tell I knew more, so I ... I showed him your back," Draco said quietly. Harry shook his head, tears streaming down his cheeks, and he turned back to the parapet.
"Sleep well," he then said and went to his room. Sighing, Remus grabbed his things and moved onto the couch. But he knew he would hardly sleep.
"Yes, sir!" said Harry tonelessly. Snape regarded him with raised eyebrows. The boy was different from all the other years. He didn't talk back, complied and hardly stood out. He didn't really care, but Severus Snape's thoughts now revolved around Potter more often than he would have liked.
"We'll begin, everyone please sit down and Harry and Draco stay here under the arch," he instructed and so Severus, Remus, Narcissa, Lucius and the friends spread out on the chairs while Harry and Draco remained standing under the flower arch by Dumbledore. The Headmaster stepped in front of them and smiled, but his eyes looked strangely sad. Draco reached for Harry's hand again and nodded at him.
"Yes ... as you take it, but not here," Severus said seriously, threw a few coins on the table and emptied his glass.
"Professor Snape said that through the bond I can transfer some of my magic to you, it takes away the pain and makes you heal faster," he explained.
"Do your duty, protect the school! Occupy all the entrances!" the teacher said and the statues followed her call. The other teachers now raised their wands and pointed to the sky. They cast the most powerful protective spells they could think of, even though they knew they couldn't do much against Voldemort.
"Well, then ... I'll go and see him in a moment. You'll have dinner with Remus, please. I'll do my evening rounds and at nine we'll go to the village!" everyone present nodded. Severus grabbed his cloak again and disappeared from the flat.
"Can you feel the heartbeat?" she wanted to know. Draco closed his eyes and sure enough, there was the beating of Harry's heart, faint but there.
"Um ... could you make the bed bigger, Professor?" he asked. Severus raised an eyebrow sceptically, but took his wand and immediately the bed was twice as wide. Draco kicked off his shoes and sat down completely on the bed without letting go of Harry's hand for a second.
"Th-thank you ... how long have you been standing there?" he then wanted to know. Remus came closer and hugged him.
"Stay close to me. It's Sunday and there aren't many students out yet, but still," Severus asked, throwing the cloak over the two of them.
"All right, that might be the best solution. You could stay here in the hospital wing," McGonagall suggested.
"It's okay, I believe it. I think it would be better if Poppy had a closer look at the injuries, but I don't want to do that without talking to him."
"Yes, he always thinks he's doing the right thing, he's doing it for a greater good and even though I believe he regrets it, I don't think he's trying to see the situation through the boys' eyes," Severus said and now sat down too.
"Hey, don’t worry. Do you ... do you want to tell me what you're always dreaming about?" Draco asked hesitantly, but Harry just shook his head.
"Apparently, in certain situations, I can access Potter's memories and he...he can access mine," Severus explained.
"So Sev, what's going on. Did they bond? Are they all right? We just met Harry alone, so it seems to have worked," Narcissa began. Appeasingly, Severus raised his arms.
As he stepped out of the pub, the cold autumn wind blew around him. He had almost expected Remus to be gone, but he was leaning in the shadow of a house. Severus went to him.
"The burning? Yes," Harry said in a whisper, but before they could think about it further, they were standing outside Dumbledore's office.
"Mhm ... Yes, godfather. I've known him all my life. You know, he's... he's really okay. Here at school, it's different and towards you ... I don't know, he's really weird."
"Of course and I know what it is. Sirius and I loved each other, very much. He was my anchor and I was his in a way."
"Yes and? Harry I ... I love you and I don't want anything to happen to you," Harry stared at Draco in disbelief, then sat up a little and lowered his lips to the Slytherin's.
"You wish, Zabini," Draco hissed. At the same moment Remus and Severus entered the hospital wing and Hermione reached for Ron's hand.
"So far, no. W-we suspect that the potion has caused some kind of soul bond," Severus said haltingly, knowing immediately that his best friend understood what that meant. Sighing, Lucius slumped down on the couch.
"Well, since you prefer to sleep in my class instead of paying attention, you will brew today's potion again and you will not leave until it has succeeded, understand?"
"Who are these Ravenclaws?", Ron wanted to know in a whisper as they followed Dumbledore and the others.
"Draco and Potter's bond was forced, you can't compare that. Real soul mates don't suffer pain when they separate from the other, because the bond has to be sealed first and after ... so after the bond is sealed, they would die if the other dies, but suffer no pain if they are separated. They would be unhappy, but nothing more."
"All right ... um, may ... may we tell our friends about it. So me Blaise and Harry, Weasley and Hermione?", Harry looked at Draco in surprise. He too wished no more than to be allowed to let his friends in on it, and apparently the other felt the same way. Severus looked at his godson sceptically for a few moments, then nodded.
"It's all right, Mr Malfoy we heard everything," Minerva said. Severus bent down to Harry and lifted him up in his arms.
"We always have a choice in life, Harry. I know you are sometimes angry because James and Lily chose to fight rather than flee, but they chose that path and for them it was right. I know you blame yourself for my death, but I chose the path to save you and I would always choose that again. Draco chose you and he chose you long before you bonded, only he didn't know it then. Every choice we make in life has consequences. Harry, I've never known anyone as brave and selfless as you. It hurts to see you here, and yet I couldn't be happier and your parents feel the same way."
"That means that as soon as he comes here, the two of them are to ... sacrifice themselves?" Narcissa wanted to know.
Draco awoke with a jolt. For a moment he didn't know where he was, then it came back to him. It was dark in the hospital wing. Draco rubbed his eyes. Harry was lying next to him and moaning. He tossed and turned, muttering unintelligible words. The Slytherin quickly turned on the bedside lamp.
