“A proper one at the time,” Harry agreed. “I got a bedroom eventually. They were right scared of me once I implied that I could hex them half to hell.”
Jasmine gives him a pitying look. “This is horrible news.”
“Can’t say I did, no,” Draco replied tartly, slinking into the communal bathroom with tired eyes. He felt vaguely shell shocked into awakeness, but knew the crash was soon on the horizon. The problem was that he could convince himself during the night that he’d be okay in the morning but his sleeplessness always dragged him back down.
Draco looks up slowly, like he’s coming up from a dream. “I haven’t slept all night.”
58. When Ginny had been in danger and Harry had loved her, he’d sent her away. Draco would never have allowed it. Harry doesn’t know if this makes him feel better or worse.
“Only because everyone is thinking it,” Harry said, because he’d heard from Ginny, who was taking great mirth in his predicament, that most of the school had talked of nothing else since it had happened.
“Point.”
“Please,” Harry says, and exhales as Draco finally lets him go, leading him back into the austere little apartment to put the kettle on for tea.
“You never fail to impress,” Anthony said, hooking his arm in Harry’s. “Shall we? I think the air in here might be toxic.”
“Wasn’t sure you’d be able to make it. I found a few things,” Draco says, giving him a whisper of a smile and leading him over to a square table boasting a large, green table lamp.
Malfoy laughs, and it’s derisive but Harry isn’t completely sure it’s directed at him. “I’m not an idiot. What do you want out of this?”
Harry became vaguely aware of snakes circling around them, long bodies in the undergrowth coming in slow circles. He felt no fear, only the sure warmth of protection as they took laps around them like scaly sentinels.
Harry laughs, his eyes finding the pale skin of Draco’s cheek, slightly pink with what might be a blush. Harry can’t remember if his skin is always that color or if it's usually more washed out. He thinks Draco was pinker when he was younger, sallow when it all fell apart, and pink again in the aftermath. Harry doesn’t think too hard, he just wants, and then he reaches out to pause Draco’s chin, leaning in to press a lip print against his cheek. It shows up bright red and only slightly smudged against the darkening hue of Draco’s face.
He wandered through the woods, a path failing to present itself like she wasn’t guiding him this time, like she didn’t have magic greater than his and he had to choose his own way through the trees. The forest was dark without the phosphorescence of her leaves or the soft glow of bugs and Harry lit the way with his wand, feeling like he had come back to the beginning and back to the end. He wondered with a jolt of fear if Draco would even come or if Harry’d broken the illusion with his decision to leave.
“You’re the one who bloody conjured it,” Harry argued, wishing Malfoy was down in the lake as well so he could splash him for his trouble.
“That’ll be enough for now,” Draco said, and Harry felt the ‘for now’ ring deep in his bones but he kissed Draco so he wouldn’t have to think about it, kissed him so deep that he could pretend he was real, that he was the only thing that was.
The girl brightens up. “Can you tell me what all of my flowers mean?” She holds her hands out expectantly, and Draco laughs, startling Harry, who can’t remember that sound ever being genuine.
“Decaf for you, Harry?” Lee asks, leaning a lazy elbow on the back edge of Draco’s booth, the coffee pot in his hands. He has his dreads pulled back with a moon and stars handkerchief that Harry hasn’t seen before.
“I think she’s going to let them figure it out for themselves,” Draco replied, gritting his teeth as he tried to turn his table back into a turtle for another try. “You have to feel a little bad for them.”
Draco remembered being eleven and so terribly scared, felt the ghost of that fear hover at his shoulder and take haughty little breaths. He felt like telling it off as he trampled through the undergrowth and followed the winding, broken paths, but he soon became used to its presence behind him and didn’t mind so much. It was nice to have any company in the forest.
“Don’t harass Harry,” Dean said around his toothbrush, reaching out to poke Seamus in the side.
Harry opens his eyes, meeting Draco’s gaze. He’s doing that thing again, looking at Harry like he’s going to eat him alive, and it’s so much, especially as Draco leans in to kiss him, as slow and gentle as the hand he’s sliding up and down Harry’s cock.
They were slim books with faded covers and thick pages, and didn’t tell him much of anything. Most of what he learned was that the Forbidden Forest wasn’t to be understood, especially not by petty mortal men. There was a whole book about people who had wandered in and never wandered out, and it made Draco’s heart seize up. He wondered if he could get the forest to swallow him up too. He wouldn’t even have to die, he’d just live in the flickering forest forever.
“I knew you’d come back alive,” Hermione said as Harry climbed through the portrait hole at eight forty, her messy hair up in a ponytail. “How was it?”
“Research,” Ron replied, and she did some personal, cruel quirk of distaste just for him.
It was only because she could see into all the mysteriously labeled boxes inside him that she knew he was scared too.
He tugged Draco closer, trying to kiss him harder to see if he could find some place he might flicker out of existence, somewhere he wouldn’t ring so true. He hoped for that, some break in the illusion so he wouldn’t be able to delude himself into thinking it was real.
“Unfortunately, I know your greatest secret,” Harry said with a grin. “Draco Malfoy’s favorite color in the whole world is-”
“Okay,” Harry says. He knew this, but he can’t believe Draco would say it to him. “Okay, yeah.”
Draco pauses to spit on his hand and then realizes that he could have Harry suck on his fingers instead, at which point he kind of loses track of things as he first shimmies out of his trousers and then climbs on top of Harry, placing two fingers on Harry’s bottom lip. Harry, who has been watching the entire production with a gentle amusement, darts his tongue out to meet them.
“We can’t just be friends after everything,” Draco said, sounding like the words were hard to get out, her face deliberately facing the floor so she wouldn’t have to look at Harry.
69. “Do you believe they found him out?” Luna asks, sitting on the chair in the kitchen as Harry made a tomato sauce, their feet propped on the middle rung. They have an uncanny ability to ask the questions Harry needs someone to ask him, even though he can never figure out how to answer. Just the idea that they could be asked, instead of hidden, is a relief.
“Next time I’ll be more minty than you can believe,” Anthony replied.
She smelled like vanilla, like something comforting and beautiful. She dropped Harry’s hand only to wrap her arm around Harry’s neck and pull her in, shifting her legs over Harry’s so she was nearly in her lap.
Love Potions:
Harry drapes the blanket over them and watches Draco for any indication other than his quiet acceptance of the blanket that he cares about Harry’s presence. The plates are priced at four thousand pounds and Draco frowns even though he’s much closer than Harry would have been.
“Separate checks?” Lee asks, levitating their used dishes above his shoulder.
“Focus,” Draco said, tugging at Harry so she wouldn’t get sidetracked. “I’m sure we are. Probably worried we’re hatching some kind of depraved plan. We do make a rather terrible team.”
“Probably not,” Harry said, resting her forehead against the chilly glass and letting her breath fog up the window. “Still got time.”
“You really are much better,” Draco said after Harry completed a turn. “I haven’t really told you, but you are.”
“You have no idea,” Draco snipped, giving his tie an irritated tug into place. He cast a final longing glance at his bed, knowing that hiding under his covers forever wasn’t an option. He couldn’t just keep hiding, it wasn’t sustainable. Still, the idea of leaving his common room to face Harry, real and solid, made it impossible to breathe.
“Don’t speak so soon,” Harry replied, turning to find the source of the commotion.
Draco cracks one of his tinderbox smiles. “Of course you’d assume you know me better than I know myself.”
and has to fight down a laugh. “And how on earth did you end up an ABBA fan?”
“Yeah, he was telling me about my flowers,” Claudia replies. “Did you send flower code letters to Hermione and Ron?” She grins when she says the names, and Harry thinks he’s always going to be surprised by the way these kids say his friends names like they know them too.
“You go be the hero, Mione, I’ll take Blaise off of your hands,” Ron said, earning herself an elbow in the side from Hermione.
Harry pears at them “Harder, probably. That looks nice, I think. It’s really blue.”
“I haven’t known anyone you set out to charm who didn’t eventually come around,” Blaise said. “Remember when Durmstrang came to visit? I thought a few of those boys were going to transfer.”
Harry nods. “Give Jess good luck from me.”
“Hermione Granger got turned into a cat?” Delia asks, her eyes widening.
It was a small consolation that the rest of their classmates seemed to be having just as much trouble as they were, bumbling into each other and yelping as toes were stepped on.
His heavy heart stayed that way through breakfast, where he met Harry’s sleepy green eyes over bangers and mash. He looked less tired than he had at the beginning of the year and Draco wondered if that meant he was sleeping again. Harry probably had an army of Healers at his disposal to help him get to sleep, a thought that made some childish part of him twist with jealousy. All Draco had was a temperamental forest and a half assed hallucination of a boy he’d obsessed over long enough.
“It’s called proper posture,” Draco replied scathingly. “Stop getting distracted.”
“Is she going to come to the ball?” Harry asked. “I heard that everyone from our year who wants to can come back.”
“I would prefer not getting hurt,” Draco says finally, quiet like he has to force the words out. “I’m not interested in wanting you more than you want me. I’m not going to do that to myself.”
“Oh,” Harry said, trying not to stare and failing quite miserably as she stepped into the dance hold. “It’s really beautiful.”
“I can’t believe she let you all copy, you dirty cheats,” Draco says, scowling at him. Then, “that felt different, didn’t it. What did you do?”
“It doesn’t matter,” Harry said, because in the end Draco would never want him, because there wasn’t a place for them anywhere that wasn’t in dreams.
Harry fails to stifle a laugh. “They really aren’t.”
Draco goes to get his own tea. “I had a feeling. I don’t know why I know.” Draco kneels down in front of him, sliding his wand out of his sleeve. He makes every move like someone forming an origami crane, like it must be done precisely and perfectly the first time. “I’m going to heal your cuts, please don’t put up a fuss about it.”
It takes a month before Harry can work up the courage to go back, and he still doesn’t know entirely why he does. Malfoy has always felt a little like a shard of glass rubbing against his lungs, now more than ever, even after all of the truly complicated pieces have been mostly sanded out.
Draco glares at him for ten seconds, then delicately starts in on a piece of toast. “Well, aren’t you going to eat something?”
Draco acknowledges this with a tight nod, looking at Harry, himself, and the garden at large with displeasure. He seems in less immediate danger of murdering Harry or anyone else, which is a relief. “Couldn’t have given me anything more dignified than an enormous tangerine handkerchief, could you?”
“So I go rooting through your desks,” Ron confirms. “Great snack selection, Harry. I love your eternal devotion to chocolate frogs. You and every five year old I know. Did everyone know that Dara keeps fluffy, pink handcuffs in her desk? She does. So, not only do I find no mention of whatever case might have caused you to be quarantined, but I find no mention of a werewolf case, which I know to exist, if only because I am accompanied by said werewolf. And because you told me you were working on a werewolf case because you break your confidentiality agreement with me every goddamn day.”
Harry watched him burn. He wondered, if it was really happening, if Draco would have screamed or if he would have borne it silently. When Harry had died the first time he’d done it quietly. He hadn’t thought to scream.
Harry,
“Yes,” he says, holding his cushion quite protectively in his lap.
“Maybe her face is stuck like that?” Neville added, and both Ron and Harry nodded in very serious agreement.
“Any grand asking plans in your future?”
“Admittedly gorgeous detective work,” Dara says. “But why are we here?”
Draco stirred against him, cuddling closer to his body and Harry felt a sharp rush of guilt that almost read as pain. “I can feel your heartbeat,” Draco said, and it sounded more mildly concerned that anything else. He voice was stretched out and languid, stripped down in that moment. “You’re shaking.”
“Boyfriend,” Harry says firmly, even though he’s terrified, because he hates that Draco would ever doubt that he wants that.
“I thought you would have higher standards about this kind of thing,” Harry says, touching himself idly as Draco watches.
Draco dappled kisses along Harry’s jawline, trying to pull himself together. He couldn’t find the anger back, mostly because it had mostly been a protective kind of fear. Harry had kissed all of the anger out of him, and left behind a technicolor sadness that pulsed cyan behind his eyes.
“Yeah, I know,” Harry says, and it’s comforting, but it’s also a truth. Voldemort is gone but the scars aren’t. His hands tremble some mornings and he can’t always shake the feeling that he’s being followed, that Voldemort is going to come back even though he saw his body fall.
Potter,
“You’re allowed to smile,” Hermione said, not sounding as repentant as she could.
33. Draco gasped against Harry’s mouth and a wild desire licked up Harry’s throat. The brutal terror was still there as Draco’s hands slid over him, fevered and grasping. Harry was holding on for dear life, Draco was reaching his hands under Harry’s shirt and Harry was coming to pieces. He was realizing where the worst parts are, realizing that after the worst parts the world just goes deeper.
“No, I didn’t!” Draco says, not giving it enough energy to make it an outburst, only a frustrated exhale. “I didn’t want to know you were abused, no.”
Harry wants to laugh, but tamps it down. “I see what you mean.”
“What about Weaselette?” Draco asks, then seems to reconsider it, waving his hand dismissively even as he amends it. “Sorry, her name’s Ginny or something?”
“You could maybe orchestrate an injury?” Anthony suggested, earning himself points in Harry’s book for audacity.
“I think I know more than you’d like,” Harry said, because it sounded good in his head and he wanted to believe that. Wanted to believe that maybe he and Draco understood each other at this point.
Harry scowls. “Maybe I do.”
“Didn’t exactly have mine, did I?” Draco replies, and Harry flumps down on the couch next to him instead of arguing. “How was lads brunch?” He’s definitely making fun of it, but Harry isn’t going to reproach him.
“You’re kidding!” Hermione exclaimed, looking pleased.
“There, that’s fine then,” Pansy said, squeezing both his hands. She was using her business voice but her eyes were soft and concerned. She looked moments from scooping him up into her arms and carrying him off somewhere where she could take care of him and he wanted it a little bit. “What happened?”
When Hermione and Ron show up at his house with a bag of holiday trim, Harry is in the process of cleaning. Or rather, he’s watching a muggle crime show on the old tv and thinking about cleaning, which is nearly the same thing.
“This all sounds very exciting,” Anthony said, taking another calm sip of coffee. “I’m really impressed at the amount of shit you get yourself into with her. I don’t think I’m ever going to stop being impressed.”
“I’m doing nothing of the sort!” he protests, even as Harry beams. The front bell chimes and Belinda goes to get it, slipping out the front curtain as Draco casts a neat cleaning spell on the machine. “You can’t just expect to be good at everything, Saint Potter.”
“You’re so good for me,” Draco says, his voice impossibly gentle. Draco’s praise and clever hands have eroded any stamina he might have had, and Harry’s so close he can feel it building in the core of his body as Draco holds him out on the edge.
Draco is the one who says the horrible words first, trembling and like a mantra and even later, when the potion wears off and Harry is sick with embarrassment, he feels like maybe they both meant them.
“Sounds like a git,” Draco said, though as someone who had once stomped Harry’s nose in, he wasn’t sure he was in a place to comment.
“I know they are,” Harry says, dumping his effects onto the chair and winging his shirt in the direction of his bedroom, as it is at this point, quite gross. “And yet, I have a feeling that your friends are going to be even worse.”
“He was a Death Eater!” Harry replies, even though he knows better than that at this point. He feels like he’s doing something wrong, knows on some level that he is, but Draco doesn’t seem to mind.
Real life prowled with beady eyes in the darkness between the trees but Harry squeezed his eyes shut and tried to let himself just be, gave himself this moment and the feel of another body. Draco pressed him back against the ground, crawling on top of him with calculated insistence and there was nothing but that, only Draco pouring back into him.
“Oi!” Ron says, crossing his arms, chess game now entirely forgotten.
“It’s Ron’s.” Harry replies, positive that he’s hallucinating, that this is some bizarre dream and he’ll wake up in a cold sweat. It’s less awful than the ones he normally has, but what’s a new kind of psychosis at this point.
After Lee leaves, Draco is looking at him and he’s looking at Draco and he realizes that this is an insane thing for him to have done, all things considered. He’s never had a pleasant conversation with Draco, and the idea that he’s going to do so now feels patently absurd. He considers just punching Draco in the nose, yelling ‘jokes!’, and backflipping out of the diner, but decides its not worth the inevitable hassle.
“Well we can teach her if she’d like to learn. You too, Harry,” Luna said, squeezing Harry’s hand before drifting back to the anthropology section of the library like a wandering butterfly.
Harry tilts his head back, thinking about the way Draco moves, how everything he does is careful. “You’re so different, now.”
“Isn’t that just the Daily Prophet?” Harry asks, and Draco smirks.
Harry doesn’t understand how Merope could think that boy could love her, her drugged and fooled lover, how she could imagine that when she stopped poisoning him he would stay with her. He is glad that Dumbledore doesn’t have that memory to place into his hands, the one where Tom’s father finds out and leaves. Truthfully, he can picture it well enough.
“He really is dreadful,” Anthony said, glancing over to where Ernie was attempting to lead Draco around the dancefloor. No fighting had broken out and Draco seemed to be following, but even as they watched she paused to hiss something at Ernie when he tread on one of her toes.
“That sounds right,” Harry says, and wonders belatedly if he’s going to be able to stay up late enough to actually eat any of the pasta. “I’m balls at Occlumency.”
“Legilimens.” Draco casts before Harry can stop him and they’re flying through old memories, through Harry watching Cedric play Quidditch, yellow robes whipping out behind him, sun hot on the grass. The scene changes and it’s pouring, Harry’s hair slicked down around his ears, Cedric turning circles on the far edge of the pitch.
“Do you know?” Draco asks, narrowing his eyes at him like he’s puzzling something out.
Harry shrugs. “I just mean like, she seems put together. That’s more than some of us can say.” It’s an admission, but he hopes that maybe if he gives, Draco will too.
65. There’s a small pocket of ash left in the street. Harry doesn’t pocket any of it, doesn’t run his fingers through it. He doesn’t want to believe it’s Draco and so he doesn’t. It’s not Draco, he’d told Harry so. Draco is supposed to appear on Harry’s doorstep, hours later and when he doesn’t, Harry goes out and gardens for hours like a somnambulist, pulling weeds until there are none left.
The first six months of Auror training and the subsequent exams are group-focused. They’re reminded time after time that being an Auror is about people, about sharing information, and working as a team. When Harry arrives at Auror headquarters for the second session, he is given an envelope and is pointed by the receptionist towards a small room in an empty, well lit hallway.
“Awesome,” Harry says, remembering that part of the reason that he and Dara are such a good team is because she always, no matter what, has a plan and a can-do attitude. “What’s on the docket today?”
“Is that a ‘yes Harry I’ll wear emerald with you’?” Harry asked, trying to look pleading. “It’ll definitely look nice on you.”
“Do you think I’m wrong?” Draco lifts a single eyebrow, a move that Harry doesn’t remember him knowing how to do.
“No, you can ask them to start at a certain time like an alarm, they’re very polite,” Blaise said, looking quite pleased at the attention.
“Harry, exactly how many Weasleys have you kissed?” Ginny asks, turning the full force of her inquisition on Harry.
“According to Draco, probably not,” Harry replied, pulling a blanket down on top of her. “But she said I was better than Ernie.”
“Can I ask what made you draw that conclusion?” they ask, calmly enough that Harry can almost convince himself it’s not any weirder than talking about the weather or their most recent Quibbler articles.
The forest tried to breathe as hard as it could, let the air shake its roots and tremble the tops of the trees so Draco could feel it, because the forest was worried for him and wanted him to breathe more slowly, to let his heartbeat calm.
“You said you had something you wanted to tell us?” Pansy asks diplomatically, tapping her holiday green and red acrylics on the table. She looks just as put together and foreboding as she had back in the shop, her dark red lip stain closely resembling blood. He hopes it wasn’t anyone he knew.
“You look disheveled,” Luna says, following his line of sight and getting a pot out for him. “Spaghetti and meatballs?”
,” Draco says. “We’re both disasters, we never should have been paired, and we’re both going to give up and then blame each other. We might as well walk out now.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says. He hasn’t felt this small in years. He can feel the slide of the knife, expanding against all of his organs. He is nothing again, he is Harry Potter, he is nothing again. He was okay this morning, this morning Draco hadn’t set foot into his brain and he hadn’t remembered. It hits like a freight train, like the snap of a rubber band. “I’m sorry it’s not fun for you, like your fucking childhood. I’m sorry it’s ugly and that you have to deal with it like I had to deal with it for eleven years.”
“Harry.” They summon the angel hair pasta down from the cabinet and retrieve the meatballs from the freezer with another flick of their wand.
“I’d like to see you yell,” Hermione snapped, and Neville looked like she’d hit him, wilting under it. She turned her gaze to the rest of the table. “Sometimes I feel like I’m the only one who actually gives a fucking shit what happens. What are we even doing? Every god damn day nothing changes. It’s not your arses on the line if the Death Eaters really come back, is it? If muggle borns lose their rights? It’s mine.” She was clutching her arm, her arm with the word scarred across the skin. “Fuck all of you, honestly. Fuck!”
“Well she didn’t scream at Ernie,” Harry said morosely. “I don’t know what McGoggles thought she was doing.”
“They think they’re just superstitions,” Potter replies, and Draco counts the freckles on the bridge of his nose. Draco didn’t know he had freckles there. “Might as well be for the amount of good it did me.”
Maybe mirage Harry was queer too, he thought with a glimmer of dangerous hope in his chest. He thought it especially cruel of the forest to do something like that, dangle such a beautiful boy in front of him, but only let Draco have him in the magical softness of the forest. He wished that he could somehow unfeel Harry’s lips on his and go back to before he’d noticed the way Harry’s body moved. He had been left unable to separate the tangle of Harry’s hair and the sharpness of his jawline from things that he wanted to touch.
After wandering for a good while, he stopped, sitting down on a rock and nearly opening his mouth to ask a question. He’s not here, is he?
The letters arrived at breakfast the second week of November. They looked fairly inconspicuous as they landed on everyone’s plates, but Harry let out a long groan as soon as she got hers open.
ow it w
“Nothing,” Harry said firmly, slapping his hand over the bruise on his neck and cursing himself for not locking the door. He’d thought Ron would have been able to spell it off, hadn’t been so pessimistic as to think he’d be stuck with the biggest bruise known to man on his neck all day.
“It’s pretty shite to throw things at people,” he said, eyebrows raised, still holding onto the younger boy, who looked borderline petrified. “I know, you think it’s funny. It’s not. What’d he ever do to you?”
“Garbage,” she sneered, whenever she caught them with it open at the breakfast table, which was most days.
Draco shakes his head. He has an expression on his face that indicates that Harry is being even stupider than usual, which is an awful lot of heavy lifting for a look to do. “Do you know why I’m here?”
“Mmm. Why do I feel like you’re jerking me off right now because I beat you in that argument,” Harry says, arching his back as Draco strokes him.
He looks at Draco, and finds something familiar in his eyes, a gray intensity that he understands only because it’s how he feels. The tv slips from his fingers and crashes to the ground, the sound echoing in the narrow street.
“No hexing please,” Harry replies with a sigh as Ron grins at him.
Ron rolled over with a groan, blinking up at him with groggy eyes. “Why are you so chipper this morning?”
“How could we ever let each other forget,” Draco said, feeling a conspiratorial smile curl across his mouth without his permission.
Harry has been invited for low tea. Harry has been taken to Diagon Alley and fitted in a pair of nice dress robes because he literally doesn’t own anything that passes Draco’s inspection.
“I know,” Draco says. He looks a little sad. “I was wondering if we would talk about it.”
Harry laughs, the way he trailed Draco that year suddenly absurdly comical. “Heroic isn’t exactly how I remember any part of that situation.”
Dara catches his eye and grins, yelling something to Ron. Harry checks the position of the doors, he breathes in, and concentrates. “On three, drop the shield and get ready to run for the door,” Harry says, and then counts them off.
“Thank you,” Draco says, rather as if he wished he’d just taken his chances with the broken nose.
Islington, London
Draco nodded, kicking at the dirt by his feet in his expensive shoes, always the hypocrite.
“You haven’t asked where we’re going,” the snake said to him, its path slow and methodic.
I don’t like your new haircut. It’s foul. I don’t know if you’re trying to be a new person or whatever, but you never should have cut your hair off. It was beautiful. I wanted to touch it. Not that your ego needs to know. Whatever. Tell anyone I told you that and I’ll kill you. As if you’ll ever know.
Harry remembers the conversation from yesterday, the screaming and the taunts and is angry all over again. “But you’re just fine probing me for mine?”
“You’re not okay, are you?” Harry pressed, glancing over at Draco, who got up in a huff.
Draco walks over to the loveseat and sits, quiet like he’s trying not to make any noise, all of his former bravado and snark gone. Harry knows he uses them as armor and weapons and yet he’s always surprised by how quickly they fall away. Harry cautiously takes his hand, feeling the immediate pressure of Draco’s fingers squeezing his own.
“I didn’t want to,” Harry said. “I just thought it was wrong if the real you didn’t want me.”
Harry shakes his head. He’s never kept it a secret, but it was a part of him no one ever really wanted to know about. “Abusive childhoods are usually the backstories of the villain, not the hero.”
Luna holds very still. “I never would have thought.”
“We can,” Harry said, caught up by the way he had to tilt his head a little bit up to kiss him, the way he smelled herbal and like comfort. “I want to.”
“So you’re responsible for all the things that have happened to you?” Draco asks, a mean, nasal quality sneaking into his voice.
Draco is looking at him curiously again, and Harry kicks himself for bringing the curious look back, when they’d been having such a nice time. “I didn’t mind.”
She freezes when she enters, blinking rapidly at them and looking in serious danger of dropping the tea tray. Harry realizes with horror that she hadn’t known it was going to be him, but before he can jump up and run out with an apology, she rights herself, sweeping over to put the tray on the table and extending her hand to him.
Harry used to his wand to fling the paper into the fire, watching each letter catch alight. Maybe it was calming to watch all of the words dissolve, and maybe it hurt like hell. Harry didn’t know the difference.
Harry mumbled something, maybe a swear, maybe praise and Draco collapsed against him, a desperate half moan breaking from his lips as he kissed him, more slowly this time, their lips just brushing.
Teaching a Boy to Kiss:
“I’m not sure,” Harry leans over, curling so he can rest his forearms on his thighs and twiddle his thumbs. “I’m just exhausted.”
“He doesn’t play for your team, Jay,” Draco says, taking a very long sip of wine as Harry goes pink.
Harry began to find that in the aftermath of their forest encounters, real Draco became harder and harder to ignore. Not that Harry’d ever been particularly good at ignoring him anyway, but seeing him every night in the dreamscape of the forest made Draco feel a little like a specter that wouldn’t stop chasing Harry around.
“I’ll have you know that I have more dark magic in my pinkie finger than you’ve seen in your worst nightmares, and if you don’t let me in there, I’ll fucking skin you alive.”
“You should read it.”
He’s making a reference to all the nightmares he had after the war, but Draco raises his eyebrows like he’s assuming Harry is talking about the two times that Draco slept in his bed. Harry opens his mouth to correct him but realizes that will only make things worse.
Harry spits out the metal, moves quietly, kisses him, doesn’t stop, forgets how.
This is so, so far from how Draco expected this night to go. Draco had wanted Harry for so long and so abstractly, like a secret he fed and fed but never thought could ever be anything. It had ended up being so simple, just kissing him like he meant it, and now Harry is gasping underneath him, hard in Draco’s hand. It is appearing, very unexpectedly, like he may need to thank Pansy.
“Eavesdropping on me, what else is new,” Draco replies, but it feels like they’re sharing an inside joke more than anything else. “Claudia, you know Harry Potter right?”
“Nothing,” Draco shoots back, cutting into his crepe with a grim determination. The transformation has left him with a pallor to his skin and puffiness around the eyes, but he doesn’t look much less appealing in Harry’s jumper than he had at the Ministry charity functions right after the war. Harry wishes that Draco looking appealing wasn’t something he was aware of.
“I mean yeah, obviously,” Dara says, backing off. “Of course we’re still going to treat it as an emergency, I’m not saying we aren’t.”
“Experience
The water drew up over his knees as he walked through the shimmering lake and past the softly phosphorescent trees. The mangroves created twisting and winding canals for him to follow, leading him deeper and deeper inside.
“Not since then, no,” he says. “So what do you get up to? Are the nurses any fun?”
When his feet hit the floor he choked in a breath and knew without a doubt that the rest of the day would be like swimming upstream.
Harry watched her hands as they flew in front of her face, and tried not to think the word irreparable. He remembered Luna telling him that she didn’t ever want to be in a romantic relationship and wondered if maybe that’s what this feeling was. And yet, that didn’t quite ring true to him. It wasn’t that he didn’t want one, he wanted someone so badly it made his chest contract, he just couldn’t drum up feelings for anyone other than a fucking mirage.
Harry, as he trekked back into the forest, was slowly working himself around to a similar conclusion. He’d spent the entire day searching for a boy who never appeared, hoping to catch a glimpse of the real Draco so maybe the forest kiss would stop feeling so real. He’d touched his mouth so often that Hermione had asked him if he needed chapstick.
“Wouldn’t put it past them,” Harry said tiredly, thinking both of Draco and the forest. She had always been kind to him and he didn’t doubt that she wanted to make him happy, to heal him and keep him safe but she was mischievous in a way that made him nervous, even after he had come to trust her.
“I think it looks quite cool,” Dara says conciliatory.
“I did like him,” Draco said. “He was just a miserable prat too.”
“You’re not going to tell him.”
Draco leans down to wash his face and Harry watches him keep his eyes closed after he finishes, the water dripping from his nose and eyelashes back into the sink as he breathes.
Harry had a fair amount of confidence in Draco’s wards, but he’s still impressed by their complexity. No one has snuck into Draco’s shop without the wards knowing about it and if they did manage to break in, Harry can’t imagine how they’d avoid being stunned and hurled through the trap door.
“They don’t want McGonagall to hate them or they already have Slytherin partners,” Ernie said morosely. “And she likes you! Plus you’re like, you know, the hero of the wizarding world at all.”
3. That is always the first mistake.
Draco nods, sitting on Harry’s counter like he did the first night. “Fancy.”
“Sure,” Harry says, and Draco is moderately vindicated by the fact that Harry’s voice sounds at first like it’s not going to work.
“As touching as that is—and it was kind of touching actually, very nice, Neville—” Pansy turns her attention away from Neville, who looks markedly less nervous once everyone stops looking at him. “I have a few remaining questions. Blaise, what the fuck?”
The snake let out a little hiss which Draco felt as a low
“You’re not angry with me, are you?” Harry asked after a silence that itched at his hands.
“I’m aware,” Harry said grumpily.
“Sorry,” Harry replied, jerking in surprise as a hand curled around his wrist. Draco’s spidery fingers dug into his skin and felt under his shirtsleeve.
He wonders if he’d told her the other thing, if he would be dead for real.
Harry laughed and promised he would, his retort bleeding into Draco’s next question as the forest held them careful and loved in her arms, feeling like she’d finally shoved them together in the right way, finally found the places they hurt and stitched them up again.
“Who’s home early?”
of your bodywash or the
“Unless she’s not in or there’s something unusual with the order, that’s something she usually does,” Draco says, finally meeting Harry’s gaze. “I’ll take this month’s to see if I notice anything strange.”
Harry could practically feel the Quidditch practices she wouldn’t be able to make slipping from her fingers. Draco was emitting nearly palpable waves of anger, and Harry thought that her lack of a snarky comment was truly proof that they were in the danger zone.
They don’t move, held again in stalemate, until Harry looks up at the clock and realizes with a start that four hours have passed since they began. It might be lunch time but Harry can’t imagine eating, can barely connect to anything outside of this room and these failures and the hard set of Draco’s mouth.
Draco looks torn apart too, like he’s stumbled across a minefield, like he’d pick up all the pieces if he only knew what he’d broken.
“You’ll have to go home and get clothes,” Harry says. “I know you’ll never wear mine.”
Harry looks up, finding Draco looking pressed and neat in the green library light. He’s wearing a dark blue robe, one that means that Harry can see way more of his wrists than he's capable of handling. Harry can’t exactly pinpoint what is so upsetting to him about Draco’s wrists, but he thinks that the longer he looks at them the more upset he’s going to get, so he returns his gaze to firmly to the pile of newspapers. “I thought this was going to go better,” he says glumly, pushing a few towards Draco. “There’s no motive.”
They’re skidding around the night before, on warm pasta sauce on the table cloth and Luna walking their fingers up his arm. They stay in the warm kitchen for longer than Harry expects, and he hears the echo of Luna’s voice as they say the words “you wanted to know everything about Draco” and “inextricable” and then they’re sliding again.
Ron raises his eyebrows at him as he laces up his shoes. “When’d you start talking to yourself?”
It’s not that Harry doesn’t know what Draco’s done. It’s not like that at all. He knows, that’s the whole thing. On the nights they fuck they don’t speak about it, don’t say anything that sounds like it could be a declaration, like an argument, like a secret.
Draco is holding very tightly to Harry’s torso and seems very attached to burying his face in Harry’s neck, shuddering against him as Harry works him over. He keeps making breathy, pornographic little noises that Harry would accuse him of faking to be sexy if Draco didn’t seem so intent on trying to muffle them against Harry’s skin.
He worries that his mother’s protection is the only love he’ll ever have, the only love that can touch him, the only love that will ever bracket his whole soul.
“Oh,” Harry responds, feeling a little lost. Malfoy has a bemused expression on his face, like Harry is the most bizarre thing he’s come across in ages.
“You two are so boring,” Jay pouts. “Did you play sports? You have the body for it.”
Draco didn’t speak, just stood very still as Harry reached out to touch him, tracing his finger down from the hollow of his throat down to the waistband of his pants along the scar tissue. Draco’s ribs shuddered under the touch and Harry didn’t know if it was from fear or desire, and wasn’t sure how to ask.
1. Follow him around until his footsteps sound like your own
“End of the world then?” Ron asked, opening her own letter, which detailed exactly when and where all Hogwarts students would be taking obligatory dance lessons to prepare for the upcoming Yule Ball. “Ahh, worse than that, I see.”
“Draco,” Harry begins, but he’s cut off with a head shake.
Draco’s carrying tension in his shoulders and Harry wishes he knew what he was feeling if nothing else. “It’s Pansy’s, I’m borrowing it.”
“Maybe they’ll put you with a Hufflepuff,” Hermione replied.
The forest knew that Harry, unlike Draco, had always been intimately familiar with longing. Harry knew longing like a old war wound that pained him when it rained, knew loss like a shadow he couldn’t shake, knew that when he tried to fight himself he lost, so he tried to hold very still and hope that the agony would pass.
“I don’t think you should be surprised that Draco has some things he would rather keep from you,” Luna says, leaning over to smell their pots. Harry worries for their tangle of necklaces, but he’s sure they’re capable of keeping their necklaces out of danger all by themself. “It should be interesting to find out what those things are.”
“Raising hell at the Ministry,” Ron says. “Additional hell.
“You’re all talk,” Harry says. “Dinner next week?”
“I think Draco’s chickening out,” Blaise comments lightly to Millicent and Ron, which is just the last thing anyone needs. Draco may be a terrified coward, but he does so hate being reminded of it. He can be brave for ten seconds. There’s no reason he can’t be brave for ten measly seconds, and then afterwards he can return to his cowardly existence of eating all of the party snacks, only ever wearing cashmere, and reading a lot of saucy westerns.
He waits patiently in line, examining the now familiar walls and the ripped up armchair where he sat and watched the rain.
“Oh no, I have to pay you,” Blaise said, rubbing the mitten against his face, before leaning down to rub it against Draco’s, who squirmed away from him protesting that he’d mess up her makeup. “They’re nice mittens, it would be rude.”
Harry presses a soft kiss against the curve of Draco’s jaw. “Afraid someone will know you’re leaving lip marks on boys?”
“There are books at the library about muggles that you can check out if you want to know more about them,” Harry said, knowing that mirage Draco wouldn’t be able to, but still hoping the forest might play along with him. He felt the rainwater seep further into his collar and into his pants and was thankful for the warmth of the forest, even though given the season he should have been freezing.
Harry picks Draco up from work the next day, watching him through the window as he fills out a form. He’s smiling about something and bopping his head so his blonde hair flops into his face. He’s wearing one of his too big sweaters and Harry wants to cuddle him so badly. He wonders what Draco’s opinions on cuddling are, if he’d let Harry be the big spoon. He thinks probably not, but it would be worth a try.
Despite making it close to thirty pages in since dinner, he didn’t think he understood muggles any better. These muggles seemed awfully adventurous and obsessed with the sea, but he thought it might just be the book. He’d have to ask Harry, if he ever decided to show up.
Draco watched him imperiously, stroking the head of the snake with a deliberate sort of patience. “I do remember that. You tried to set one on me.”
“I’m actually trying to do my job. You may have heard of it? The Aurors?” Harry asks with perhaps a little more venom than is required, mostly because he had, successfully, brought Draco back to his flat, and now they’re here, in the rain, having this horrible conversation.
It flips and he’s watching Cedric across the dining hall with a languid kind of boredom. He’s just staring, watching him laugh and eat and mess with his hair. He doesn’t know why he thought to watch him like that, doesn’t know where the urge came from even though the memory drips with the echoes of it.
“The red one’s nice,” Harry says, feeling the odd weight of the shimmer against his eyelids. He wonders if he looks pretty, if the shine is as striking on him as it is on Draco.
“For what part?” Draco says, and Harry yearns for the bygone times that he could just throw hexes at any uncomfortable situation with Draco.
Harry, with moderate alarm, tries to think of Draco’s last documented instance of being a git and comes up with nothing. He wonders if deliberately speaking French in front of Harry counts, then decides it probably doesn’t. He wisely decides not to share this, and instead changes the subject.
“Can you fix it?” Harry asks, because he doesn’t know what a belt is in the first place.
During that night’s detention, Draco continued to snip at her and Harry continued to crack awful jokes, but it never crossed over into screaming and Harry thought maybe she could do this dancing thing. Harry didn’t bring up the crying and Draco seemed pleased to keep it that way, only correcting Harry’s posture every once in a while with gentle hands or a quick reprimand.
“She followed you in last night and I told her. We made nice,” Draco said, a little guarded.
“Good party too,” Harry said.
“We know, boys,” Pansy clarifies, smiling even wider when she registers their shocked expressions. “Or at least suspected.”
“I was mostly kidding,” Harry says. “Unless you think it’s hot.”
“Hello everyone,” McGonagall’s voice rang out across the Great Hall as she took her place at the podium, the sleeves of her dress robes glimmering sky blue in the light. “If you would take your seats at any one of the tables, dinner will be served shortly.”
“Then I don’t see why what anyone else thinks matters,” she replies with a delicate shrug, pulling her elaborate blue robes across her lap. “Although for the record I think it’s beyond time that you started using the energy between you two for something positive.”
“Thank you,” Dara says. “Can you tell us if you’ve seen anyone out of the ordinary visit Rob’s house in the last month or two? Anyone who doesn’t normally pay him a visit.”
“I’m Jay, it’s great to meet you,” he leans forward, like he’s imparting a secret. “Draco’s so tight lipped about school, I want to hear about what he was like. Adriene thinks he must have been even more posh at school but I don’t believe it.”
Harry did laugh this time, a little uncertain. “I’m not surprised, really. Kinda pretentious.”
“Draco Malfoy, will you be my stupid fucking friend?” Harry asked, digging her fingernails into her palms to keep herself from losing it.
He peers into the window, finding Draco at the counter in a navy blue jumper, a hint of a smile resting on his face. There’s something calming in his movements and Harry likes watching him organize the desk space and push his sleeves up when they fall down.
“I studied in Manhattan for a few years after Hogwarts,” Narcissa says pleasantly, taking a sip from her cup. The set is fine, all delicate gold handles and pretty flowers, but there’s a chip on the side of Narcissa’s dish and he wonders how old all of this is. “They have such a brusque way of casting spells. I think they lose some of the finesse, really.”
“Yes,” Draco said, giving him the beginnings of a teasing smile. Harry gave Draco’s hand a tug, pulling him closer, marveling that he could touch him. Draco let himself be pulled in, suddenly shy as their bodies bumped against each other.
“Still fantastic,” Harry says, shoveling the last few bites of potato into his mouth before Lee can take his plate away.
“Please don’t spread it around,” Harry said, lowering his hand with a sigh. “No one’s supposed to know.”
Harry wants to comfort him and doesn’t know how. Everything about the last hour and a half has been completely untenable, nothing has made sense since he found Draco lying in that petunia patch and they picked right back off where they left off. Even though Draco has said that he loves him (kind of), he can’t understand it as true. Draco is saying that Harry doesn’t love him, but that doesn’t seem true either. He’s staring again, at Draco, who he has always believed to be beautiful. Harry reaches out to brush his fingers across Draco’s cheek, finding the skin soft and cold and nearly damp.
Look at me you git, Harry thought as he took an irritated bite of scrambled eggs.
“Quit looking at me like that,” Draco says, his gaze fixed on the trees.
It was much closer to ‘I have feelings, they don’t even know its happening,’ but that was so impossible to explain that Draco just nodded.
The café Draco has brought him to is so perfect for casework that Harry is a little miffed he didn’t know about it before. It looks like any chintzy little tea parlour, but a combination of well placed walls, large vases and sculptures, and clever privacy spells means that once you’ve sat down, its nearly entirely impossible to see or hear any of the other diners. It’s nestled in one of the far corners of Diagon Alley between a bakery run by someone’s 900 year old gran and a Muggle tchotchke store alarmingly full of furbies. One glance in the window had been enough for Harry to know which ones he would be picking out for Dara and Ron.
She drew Harry closer to the place where Draco stood, giddy to see what they’d do this time, her two favorite boys lost in the forest. She knew they couldn’t do it forever but she wanted them to, to draw them back in each night and build new worlds for them to play in. She’d keep them, if they wanted, let them roam the paths forever, but some part of her knew that while they might have wanted that once, they would no longer stay.
The forest had never actually spoken to him with words and he was fairly positive that she couldn’t, but he thought she might speak the messy and inexact language of human emotion. There was something giddy about her, tempered only by a measured kind of ceremony, like she wanted things to be special.
“You’re good at this,” Harry manages, as Draco mends the cuts on his fingers, the skin smoothing.
“She’s going to be the minister one day, I’m telling you right now,” Ron tells Harry seriously, as Hermione swats at him with her magazine.
“I thought you might think it was hot,” Draco says, looking a little embarrassed.
“Thanks,” Draco said, looking a bit pleased with herself. She still seemed a bit tired, which made sense, given Ginny’s intel that the victory party had stretched on until five in the morning.
“The Weird Sisters’ first album,” Draco answered immediately.
“This is a fucking disaster,” Harry said instead of replying, leaning up against the sink with a grimace and squeezing his eyes shut. “Why isn’t the spell working?”
“Oh stellar,” Dara says, sliding down so she’s sitting almost-normally in the cracked armchair. “Best I’ve seen in toddler ballet since ’92.”
The handkerchief flashed against his breast like a rose. In Harry’s hands, the paper lit and burned itself to ash.
“You’re not listening to me at all,” Harry says. He has a feeling that Draco should understand, but maybe he’s too warped at this point, maybe there isn’t anything left in his mind except for pages and pages of incantations and instructions. “Why do you think we’re paired together? Like, really?”
“Thanks for trying to help, Ron,” Harry said as he trudged back into the sleeping area, sick with the suspicion that no matter how tightly he wound his scarf, everyone would know by lunchtime.
“Mind if I look too?” Harry asked, realizing only after she’d spoken that there were other windows she could have gone to, that just because they’d danced together didn’t mean that Draco wanted to be close to her even if she was crying. Maybe especially if.
Dara looks like she’s considering taking Harry’s face in her hands. “I take it back, we better not get Obliviated because I’m never having this stupid conversation with you ever again. You are worse than Jess, a toddler who is literally not yet developmentally able to have empathy for my suffering.”
“It’s not scary like this,” Draco said, leaning back against the tree trunk. “I can read her mind, so I know what she’ll do.”
“You can’t tell anyone,” Harry said, leaning up against the sink. “I can’t get it off, none of the spells are working.”
47. Draco has a fucked up idea of justice. He crawls into Harry’s bed smelling like smoke. He kisses like pulling a finger too far back. Sometimes when they fuck, all Harry can think about is dying, working his body mechanically, trying not to open his eyes unless he has to. Other times he can’t keep his mouth shut, can’t keep from going completely to pieces, can’t keep from whimpering like a dog or a child. Draco is so gentle with him and he’s so gone for it that the pleasure feels something like shame.
“Thanks for finding those clippings,” Harry says a little too loudly. The witch a table over glares at him over her enormous stacks of books and he brings his voice back down where it’s supposed to be. “I never make it over to the archives for cases, Hermione is always yelling at me about it. This could be really helpful information.”
“Come again?” Harry asked, as Draco gripped her hand harder.
Hermione beams, laying her hand gently on his. “You know that exact combination of words is my love language.”
“You get turned around in here,” Harry said in dulcet tones that cut under Draco’s high pitched diatribe. “It could happen to anyone.”
45. Draco won’t fake his own death no matter how many times Harry asks him to. Every night, Harry imagines the Death Eaters figuring out exactly where Draco sneaks off to, every night, he imagines him dead, or worse. Draco knows too many things about Harry, he always has. It’s no consolation that no one knows this, that no one would never know to ask Draco about Harry in the first place.
He’s trying not to stare at Draco and doing a horrible job of it. According to Harry’s personal narrative regarding the incident, he’d hooked up with Draco Malfoy for purely self-destructive reasons, or out of convenience, or by some unlucky accident. Looking at him, sprawled in the moonlight, Harry is devastated to recall that he’d hooked up with Draco Malfoy because he’s hot.
he grumbles internally. He grits his teeth, trying to drum up as much cheerfulness as he can as he steps out of the elevator. “Just stay out of trouble, please.”
“You haven’t bought your tie yet, have you?” Harry asked Anthony during breakfast, pausing at the Ravenclaw table on the way over to her own.
Draco doesn’t answer for a long moment. “I know a café we can go to. You’ve got to have a notebook in that thing, correct?” Harry rustles around his bag, handing Draco the self-inking quill and pad so he can scribble a name and address in his pointy handwriting. “Meet me at nine thirty?”
“So you’re still out for power?” Harry asks, feeling suddenly bare even though he’s the one who can’t leave Draco alone. He supposes he’d always wanted power too, loved the way magic gave him a way to be in control, gave him something to be other than the boy under the stairs. It’s different, but still the same.
“I made a scarf once,” Greg said, looking quite pleased with himself. “Gave it to my mum for Christmas.”
“Yeah, I can,” Harry said, in English, and the snake gave an irritated flick of its tongue. “I don’t know, I don’t think I can speak it.”
The Sordid Details:
“I could have a secret third eye,” Goyle remarked, rather lamely, in Harry’s opinion, though Draco did give him an approving smile.
Draco shrugs. “I’ve had practice.”
“Thanks,” Harry says, slurping from the tea Luna has poured and then making a face, both because it tastes strange and because he’s burned the feeling out of his tongue. “What even is this?”
“The underwater ship, it’s called a submarine. They’re real things, muggles use them all the time,” Harry replied, sounding like he wasn’t sure whether he wanted to laugh or cry.
“I’m not feeling that sad?” Harry says tentatively, at which Draco lets out a quiet snort-laugh.
Draco scoffs. “You commit, Chosen One. You gave up, what, twenty minutes ago? Don’t pretend its my fault you can’t get your mind to cooperate. You’re lying to yourself ten ways from Friday.”
“I’m not,” Harry protested. “She’s just, not completely vile.” It might have been lying by omission, because Draco wasn’t nice, but sometimes when she wasn’t being deliberately difficult or dramatic, she did know how to be sweet.
“She gets dressed up every time I come over and she does all the proper etiquette and wears her lipstick like we’re still at the manor,” he says, letting his head go to Harry’s shoulder. “Pansy and I are the only ones who come to see her anymore.”
Sitting in one of the boughs, as Harry somehow knew he would be, was Draco, draped in a lavender snake about as thick as Harry’s arm, wearing nothing but a tee shirt and pants.
39. In the Wizengamot one afternoon, Hermione breaks down in tears. There are muggleborns that never returned to the wizarding world after the war and so many people don’t think that that’s a problem, certainly not one they should waste resources on. Harry hasn’t been following it very closely. He finds all of this easier if he doesn’t get emotionally invested, if he doesn’t hope except when Hermione brings home a few bottles of wine and tells him there’s something to celebrate.
“Quite sure,” Draco replied, her words prim and crisp even though she smelled like grass and alcohol and ever so slightly of vanilla. “Harry, I have something to tell you.”
She frowned. “I just think that as professional healers they should have some alternative treatment. It’s horrible that they can’t fix it.” Harry knew for a fact that she often went to the library and researched sleeping potions for him and that nothing she tried worked, at least not for long.
Draco wouldn’t have noticed the way the forest breathed at all if he hadn’t stopped with heavy feet to press his hands against the side of a log and felt the slight tremor of an exhale slip up to his fingers.
“Oh yeah, I’ll just go to the Yule Ball in Slytherin colors, awesome advice Draco,” Harry said, something about the eyes comment making her feel a little bit warm.
“Sure,” Harry replies, because he doesn’t think he could say the name without throwing up. He’s an idiot for thinking this could work and that everyone would just be okay with it.
“Last suspect is Rob Spreckleroy.” Draco says. The wizard in the third picture looks like the plaster garden gnomes that Muggles have, but in greens and browns. “Halfbood and a long time supplier, so doesn’t seem likely that he’d do something like this, but who knows. He runs a wild frog sanctuary, which I’m not sure is strictly legal. I can’t imagine the climate charms he’s running to produce tropical conditions in rural England, but I don’t ask questions I don’t want to know the answers to.”
Draco fussed briefly with the fly of Harry’s trousers before giving up and palming his cock through the fabric, his fingers desperate and sure as Harry lost the ability to kiss him and bent his head to rest it on Draco’s shoulder instead.
“Fucking biscuits,” Dara says derisively. Harry rolls his wrists and neck, not sure if he should be more or less alarmed by the fact that they aren’t handcuffed. “We got totally stripped of weapons. They even got my emergency Peruvian Darkness Powder and Smoking Whizbangs. And those were hidden shockingly deep.”
“What are the radios for?” Hermione asks, running her hand over the knobs of the one in the front. “They look really old.”
Pansy is not doing her best job of looking uninterested. Draco suspects he isn’t either, but no one is really paying him any attention. “Hermione, please don’t tease me.”
“You won’t go too far,” Harry says. “No one will ever know.”
Harry’s feet began to hurt in his shoes and he regretted wearing only his pajamas as the chill of the forest began to creep in. He cast a warming charm and kept going, wondering how deep in the forest he was, wondering how long it would take him to get out.
The Diagon Alley Library, when he finally pushes through the wide double doors and into the glass-dome atrium, is quiet enough that he can hear the turning of pages and his footsteps as the door slips shut behind him. A few clouds passing overhead cast moving shadows on the lush, olive colored carpet and the endless stacks of books, and Harry scans the area for a familiar blond head as he walks over to the reception desk.
“Did you— How many people know?”
The second one is from Ron, it reads: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. just kidding. but haha. Hermione is telling me this is mean to send but look at your FACE. Anyway I’m mostly just writing to you at the breakfast table because Hermione is and I wanted to be included. Snogs Galore, Ronald
“You’re not as bad as Nagini,” he said, suppressing a shiver. “Don’t take that the wrong way, I think you’re beautiful but I never know what you’re going to do.” Oddly, he thought that why was why snakes made them such a good mascot, because they both had the same shifty eyes. It made sense, he was a snake, he was afraid of snakes, nothing there was out of the pattern.
Draco blinked at him, his lips growing whiter and whiter as he pressed them together, his breath coming fast through his nose. “I
“Can I help you?” He asked, shutting his book and holding it to his chest like he was protecting himself and also like he didn’t want Harry to see it.
The fact that Draco is in the throes of a disastrous, multi-year crush on Harry is the real free-radical in their newfound post-war inter-house unity. Harry had made overtures to him at the beginning: awkward, stilted conversations that seemed like they wanted to be apologies, and Draco had done similarly. As quickly as they could, they’d become the kind of friends who don’t say anything to each other directly, which is honestly great and fine and better than Draco ever could have expected, ill-advised crush non-withstanding.
“Awesome,” Harry replies, digging the muggle bills out of his wallet. “Thanks for fixing it.”
“If I let him lead, we don’t go anywhere,” Draco said, stepping away from Ernie with a rustle of her skirt and a frown. “I am a good dancer. I am good at following but not when he can’t lead!” Draco had developed an angry flush of pale pink on the apples of her cheeks and had crossed her arms rather aggressively over her chest.
Pansy blinks expectantly at him, her tapping nails increasing in volume.
“And did you push it? Into a hammer?” Malfoy replies, giving Harry a hard look. Harry wants to cross his arms over his chest and ask Malfoy why he can’t let him get away with anything, but he’s not willing to revert to childish antics just yet.
“He’s just saying that because I’m great at sucking dick and I threw a pig in a blanket at his head,” Draco clarifies, knowing that he’s flushed quite pink and is probably only going to get pinker.
Draco has always considered himself to be the kind of person who needs to be taken out to dinner and seduced. Turns out, as Harry presses his cock against Draco’s thigh, he’s apparently completely happy to be ravished against a random wall.
“I’ll be at the Burrow, it’s become quite an event. They’re going to have to put an addition on the house just for Christmas,” Harry says ruefully, thinking of last time, when they’d used engorgio on the table and still ended up having another group eat on the sofas in the living room.
“We have some ideas about motives,” Harry says forlornly. “But no
“Your neighbor is actually under investigation,” Dara says, using what Harry suddenly recognizes as one of the voices she uses when trying to talk her toddler Jess into something she already knows Jess won’t like. “We’re hoping that you might have some information that could help us.” Dara levels her gaze at Connie. “And once we clear that up we’d be happy to personally investigate your toad problem.”
“I’d rather it wasn’t you! I wish it wasn’t always fucking you!” Draco replied, taking off at a irritated pace around the room. “I though this year I could finally ignore you and what do you do? You volunteer to be my dance partner!”
“It’s not destroyed,” Draco said, scandalized that Harry would suggest that he’d desecrate a library book. “I’m not an animal. Books that are worn are well loved.”
When Harry entered, Draco was already perched on a desk, her skirt arranged artfully around her and her makeup still flawless despite the late hour. Draco made a point of not looking at her, instead inspecting her emerald hued nails with a casually disinterested expression.
Even worse than the forest was the look in Draco’s eyes when he’d stormed off by the lake, because that hurt had been real for both of them. He wanted to make it better somehow, but since he had no idea how to talk to Draco even if he could get him alone, it was a moot point.
Luna shakes her head at him, a strand of bright red hair falling from her bun. “I can tell something’s happening, your aura has gone all funny.”
Harry nods, sitting back up and waiting for Draco to cast. He does, more tentatively than before, and when Harry feels the first brush of presence in his head he tries to do what he’s supposed to. There’s no change, there’s still Draco in his mind and Draco in front of him and he can’t figure out how to press him out without the help of the sharp rush of panic.
“I do try,” Harry said, pouting a bit. “I just embarrass myself, so often.”
“Fucking nepotism,” Ron says, then reaches into his bag, bringing the tufty ponytail at the back of his head into Harry’s sightline. “Oh, I also have a letter for you, Harry”
“He’s different now,” Harry says, and is startled by how often he’s been in Dara’s position, trying to convince someone that Draco Malfoy is an evil git who generally sucks. He’s surprised by the vehemence with which he believes otherwise.
Harry nods the best he can without lifting his head. “I wish it wasn’t with Malfoy.”
Harry pauses, an unwrapped kraft single in his hand, a shock of fear rushing through him. “I already know your mother.”
She smiles, looking extraordinarily pleased with herself. “So who are they?”
Your son whimpers in his sleep, he tells her, and I wish I didn’t know that. I wish I knew what song he played when he tapped his fingers like that on my stomach.
After sipping his way through two cups of coffee and shoving down two slices of buttered toast, Draco made his way to the library with homework in mind. He truly tried to do work, but found himself browsing the few books about the Forbidden Forest the library had available.
“If you would explain it to me then maybe I’d understand!” Harry said, finding he had raised his voice in the chilly moonlight, unwilling to let himself believe, unable to keep himself from hoping.
“I kinda thought,” Harry begins. Draco thinks he’s quite brave for trying to start a sentence right now. “That you maybe didn’t like me very much? I think maybe that’s not true. I’ve been rethinking that. I think maybe you do like me?”
“Oh, okay, I guess,” Harry said, shifting so he was laying on his side, the book spread out on the leaves next to him. He read slowly, his voice tripping over the names of tropical fish and Draco crossed his legs, careful to keep his posture perfect as he listened.
“You’re supposed to be good at it,” Draco says, breathing hard and looking on edge, his cheeks flushed and a line of sweat at his hairline.
“The Patil twins were perfectly nice,” Hermione protested.
“I’m not coming in, you idiot,” Harry replies, sneaking a glance at the already running meter and gritting his teeth. “Whatever, we’ll go to mine, but if you’re pissed off in the morning that’s not my fault.”
Sunday, after sleeping in until one and running down to the Great Hall to catch the last ten minutes of breakfast, Harry helped Ron set up the library wide scavenger hunt she was using to ask Hermione to the Yule Ball.
and each time he repeats it, it shifts further from Draco’s voice into his own. Harry hates the way the floor on his anger and fear always gives out and leaves nothing but exhaustion. He wonders what it would be like if something were easy.
“Fair enough.”
“Oh,” Harry said, snatching his hand back with a shifty look to the ground. “What happened?”
“Why?” she asked, the furrow in her brow growing deeper the longer he talked, like it did in class when she didn’t understand the lesson just yet. There was an ironic amusement in finally being able to stump her. “Why are you apologizing?”
“This morning, evidently,” Harry replies, then grimaces. “Sorry, I fell asleep on the couch, I’m grumpy.”
The forest breathed a hello, a welcome back, and Hermione looked up at the trees, frowning like she almost understood. The forest rained flower petals on Hermione’s head and made a decision, almost laughing at the fun of it as she led Draco slowly towards her.
“So, what,” Draco hisses, something wild in his eyes. “You had a crush on him so you tried to get with his girlfriend? So you could fuck her and feel close to him? That’s sick, that’s fucking sick, Potter.”
“Harry?”
Andrienne Joseph, Secrets of Herbology
“Oh, it’s like that?” Draco asks, releasing Harry’s wrist to place his free hand on Harry’s neck in a way that feels mildly threatening and more than a little bit sexy. Draco has his thumb resting very deliberately against Harry’s Adam’s apple. “I think you could call me by my first name when I fuck you, don’t you?”
“It’s not that, Pans,” Draco replied, drumming up all of his quiet patience. He almost could have told her, except that speaking it out loud would have made it horribly real.
“Georgie’s missing you, Harry. Says you haven’t been in to test out the newest sweets in ages.” Lee gives a tragic shake of the head. “Too busy out with the new boyfriend to visit your old Gryffindor chums. Well, I say new boyfriend—”
“Date?” Draco asked, looking like she was trying very hard not to laugh.
“Draco?” Harry asked the wood, terror coppery in his mouth. He was ashamed of the fear in his voice, ashamed of the tremor of it. The trees shifted and shimmered in the breeze, the night folded over itself.
“I am okay,” Harry replies with a tired smile.
Harry thinks, through the steamy fog in his brain that if Draco’s skin is already so pink and pale, that he’ll have an easy time sucking very obvious bruises onto it, which is exactly what he’d like most. Draco hums a moan as Harry clutches him close and bites down on the fragile skin of his neck, sucking until the skin is red under his teeth.
“What? She’s not.”
“Oh Merlin,” is the first thing he says, snapping his eyes back shut like if he blinks, the situation will change. “Merlin, bugger, shite.”
“I mean, could use some work,” Anthony said. “But I like the sentiment.”
“So anyway, the assistant. You’re sure its not an act?” Hermione suggests.
“Not helping,” Draco replied grouchily, as Blaise continued to get ready, shoving a few quills in the outside pocket of his bag.
Harry splutters through his bite of donut and has to take a good twenty seconds to make sure he isn’t going to choke and die. “Why would you say that?”
Minutes stretched past and he memorized the patterns on the tiles and counted in his head and pushed reality into boxes so it wouldn’t run wild in his brain.
Luckily, Harry Potter doesn’t seem to be interested in talking to Draco either, which is a whole new pie graph, because there’s a small percentage of Draco that wants Potter to want to talk to him. If Potter tried to talk to him then he would know that Draco is just fine and perfectly adjusted and still charming.
Pansy laughed, tipping her head back and leaning into him. Draco wrapped his armor tighter around himself, letting himself be dragged into the Great Hall where Harry sat with all his friends, shame pooled deep in his stomach.
“Shut up.”
“But I know fuck all about Millence Filbin and his daddy issues, so we call in the expert.” Ron leaves a dramatic pause and Dara chimes in.
He feels Draco in his head but there’s no tunnel, only molasses, soupy and thick thoughts for a moment before the surprise registers and Draco shears through his mind again, latching onto a memory of them at school, Harry copying Hermione’s answers by the fire of the Gryffindor common room.
“Oh,” Draco said, like he hadn’t expected it.
“A lot of people made choices for me,” Harry replies, rubbing at the grease spot on the back of his hand. “And I was really lucky honestly.”
“Sounds terrifying,” Harry says, and Draco nods his agreement.
“We’ll see, won’t we?” Harry replied, letting Draco grab her hand and get her into position.
Draco pulls Harry back in with a guiding hand on his jaw, much more gently this time, their mouths soft when they meet. How Harry is so warm, Draco will never never know. Harry’s stubble is rough against Draco’s palm but his hair, when Draco slides a hand into it, is silky. He can’t even bring himself to be truly offended that it’s silky, because he’s touching it, and Harry is kissing Draco back. They both have their eyes open, which Draco had thought would be better somehow, but is so, so much worse. Harry’s eyes are a deep, vibrant green, and he looks like he’s concentrating very hard on the kissing, which makes Draco want to crawl on top of him and sexually destroy him.
“McGovern is her married name, or I would have noticed it earlier. While searching for information about her I found her marriage announcement. Her full name is Opal McGovern née Mulciber. Half of her family were Death Eaters and her sister, Aileen Mulciber, was turned during the war by Greyback. If you remember, he wanted to turn as many people as he could in order to complete a takeover.” Draco’s expression twists with disgust. “Aileen is in Azkaban for life, but it would be a motive.”
Harry didn’t answer for a moment because he hadn’t quite thought of anything to say. He watched the back of Draco’s head, almost hoping that Draco could feel the prickle of his eyes there. “I think you’re good company.”
Draco kisses Harry’s neck, his collarbone, his chest. “Don’t I look terrified now?”
When he returns to his flat, the tiny one near the place wizarding London meets muggle London, he places his new radio on the table next to the old one, muggle news rumbling from the tinny speakers until he falls asleep in his armchair.
Belinda cuts him off, setting the tv down at the table and waving her hands at him. “It’s not my business, just don’t get so distracted you forget what you’re supposed to be fixing.”
“So do you have any idea who Imperiused poor Rob?” Draco asks.
you out here and the
“Are you okay?” Harry said, watching the worry lines that appeared on the sides of Draco’s pursed mouth, the shiftiness in his eyes, the way his chest heaved even though he wasn’t moving. “Are you breathing alright?”
“That goes for you too, Malfoy,” Hermione adds crisply.
“I was bad at it,” Harry says, the sadness still swimming on the surface. “Do you know how to do it?”
Draco did feel something new in the winding forest paths that night but he couldn’t fathom what it was, could only follow the trails and run his fingers across the vines. He had the vague sense that the forest was brimming with something, maybe life and maybe love, and that she was just waiting to upend her secrets upon him.
Blaise hummed some tune Draco had heard him play on piano, Greg still snoring softly in the last full bed. Theo had left much earlier, always preferring to get homework done before breakfast, leaving only Draco and Blaise awake.
“I’m canning,” she says as he enters the kitchen, and Harry belatedly registers the sweet smell of cooking strawberries.
Harry doesn’t wait this time, relying on surprise, casting again with a fierceness that seems to come from a body that isn’t his. He scrounges for some thread to follow, but is pushed out again, harder and more angrily than before. This repeats, the anger and the fierceness and the rhythmic circle of casting, almost finding a foothold, and being shoved away.
“I’ve decided,” Draco begins, crossing his legs primly even as he perches on the countertop. “That I would like you to meet my mother. If we’re going to do this.”
“They’re very pretty really,” Draco says. “I quite like the roses.”
Harry fought a smile, following her in.
“Creative: Ravenclaw,” Goldstein replied with a smile. “Plus, I wouldn’t actually push you down a flight of stairs so I think it stays in Ravenclaw territory.”
“Could we have the heart to heart after I make you come?” Draco asks, and Harry nods very reasonably, reaching down to run his fingers through Draco’s hair. Harry’s hand feels very nice, and even nicer when Harry tugs a bit on his hair when Draco takes him back into his mouth.
“What?”
Draco laughs again, it seems like he’s doing a lot of that lately, and shakes his head like Harry has failed to surprise him once again. “Everyone always gets to that question. Apparently if you make a gay spectacle of yourself in Witch Weekly people want answers.”
Harry remembered the night their magic had spilled out of them and intertwined, the sensation of being overwhelmed and tangled up in Draco. The sensation of sinking into the essence of him, of being held so desperately. “Your magic felt so wild I thought you were just an extension of the forest.”
“Didn’t even have to properly touch you,” Draco whispered, sounding ragged. “Merlin.”
“I thought you could graduate to repeating ‘back side together, front side together’ under your breath for today,” Draco said, giving her an icy smile. “Think you can handle that?”
“I resent that, I love plenty of things and have many feelings. I just don’t whirl them about like kites,” Draco says airily. He wants to count all of Potter’s eyelashes but he’s been resisting. He feels like his insides are on fire in a good way and thinks if he touches Harry he might burst into flame.
“I’m not,” Draco says, leaning on the counter. It’s not the worst Harry’s seen him, nothing compared to the gaunt shell he was in sixth year, but his hair sticks up in the back and his cotton tee shirt is wrinkled. “Still haven’t found anything that needs fixing?”
“I’m tired of not being better,” Draco said, because he’d been healing for months and now he was hurting all over again. He thought for someone who’d lived through a war and held secrets from the Dark Lord himself, he should be better at keeping his heart safe, or at least that loving shouldn’t hurt so much.
The way it reads like poetry is distinctly unsettling. He’s reminded of Snape and wonders if all Legilimens are so fond of tangling words. He thinks wryly that if he can get the hang of it he’ll automatically be poncy and articulate too.
Harry goes pink. “Both.”
“Yeah, that makes sense,” Harry replies, even though reading solar activity is beyond him. She isn’t exactly wrong.
“Friendship?” Harry shrugs, a variety of situations making a whole lot more sense in hindsight. They do rather more candlelit dinners than anyone would expect of platonic friends, but Harry had assumed that was just their style.
Harry smiled, feeling like she was dancing on clouds, like her feet barely touched the ground as they moved. “You are a good teacher, I wasn’t kidding about that.”
“What?” Harry asked, wondering how there could still be anything that could surprise him.
The first time they dueled it was messy and beautiful.
“You are?” Harry asks, and Draco makes a face at him.
“Uh huh,” Parvati said knowingly. “No residual feelings there, got it.”
Draco shook his head frantically. “I thought he was a mirage until this morning, I promise. That’s what the bruise was about. I wanted to know for sure.”
Harry smiles, clues linking together in his mind. He is thrilled that his brain has chosen this moment to return, and hopes it continues to operate at such a success rate. “Right before I passed out, Connie said that someone had already made her an offer about her toads. The Ministry is in on this somehow, she gave us our answer after all.”
Draco nodded stiffly, afraid to say any of these thoughts in case it ruined the illusion. “I’ll consider it.”
Draco gives him a superior look. “This is my first investigation, Potter, and I think it’s suiting me splendidly. It’s just like those Hagatha Christie mysteries, I’m a regular Warlock Holmes.”
“Focus,” Draco murmurs, almost encourages, and Harry tries, so hard he can feel sweat at the back of his neck. “Stop thinking about the sweat on your neck. Think about nothing, think about me leaving your head. You hate it, remember? You hate that I’m in your head.”
Draco stills, his glittery finger paused in midair. “What?”
“You know what,” Draco replies, aloof as he leans against the wall. He’s untouchable and Harry wants to go back to their fluorescent sanctuary where things almost made sense.
Eternally Yours in
“It’s better how you usually do it,” Draco replies, and Harry resists the urge to grind his teeth.
She waited for a good place in the music and then moved forward, repeating “Back, side, together, front, side, together,” to Harry under her breath as they moved. When she’d danced with Anthony she’d mostly just let him move her around, and while they’d done the counts of three she didn’t think they’d been moving in a box.
“Naturally. Keep me apprised if you learn anything new.”
“Kinda,” Harry said. He couldn’t exactly come out and say what had actually been happening. There was no way he could phrase it without it sounding horrible. Probably because it was horrible, but somehow it was less so when he was the only one who knew. “It’s dumb.”
“About what?” Harry asked, screwing up her nose. “‘Oh hi Draco, it’s Harry, I was just wondering why you stopped trying to punch me in the face?’”
“What?” Harry asked, the book open in his hands, a strange look in his eyes.
“Which it is,” Ron offers. “So I’m minding my business, eating a sandwich, when Malfoy comes running into my office. Which, frankly, is a surprise.”
Ron quirked a grin at him, shoving his shoes on. “Love that girl to death,” he said, a flush creeping over his already pink cheeks.
“Could you just tell me why he kissed me?” Harry asked, feeling absurd talking to a forest. “Was it you? Or was it me?”
“Of course, how could I forget the age old adage of ‘fuck comfort I’m a slytherin’,” Harry replies, the entrance of a customer with an old radio the only thing stopping Draco from biting back a retort.
“Imperiused,” Dara says, when they finally Apparate back to the office. Harry is aware that they smell of damp and mud and wants nothing more than a hot shower, but they still have about an hour or two before it’s really fair for them to head home.
“You’re the most oblivious person I’ve ever met,” Draco says. “He started talking about your body and you started talking about football.”
“I think I just made friends with Gregory Goyle,” Hermione said, her forehead creased. “I think that he’s nice, when did he get nice?”
It seemed unlikely, mostly because mirage Harry had been so warm.
“I think one of your housemates may be able to help you in this regard,” McGonagall said, and Ernie gave a nearly audible sigh of relief. “In the meantime, I expect both of you to try your best. Ms. Malfoy, please do not terrorize Mr. Macmillan.”
He pulls the blanket over his head. There’s no moon. He remembers being under the invisibility cloak, believing that that night was the reckoning, believing that a reckoning was possible, that anyone’s death could mean anything other than death. He mouths the words as they trip through his brain and can’t parse meaning from them:
While it’s happening, it never occurs to either of them that it’s the potion. It feels hyper real, saturated and reeking. Harry imagines he can see every pore of Draco’s skin, every vein pushing up against skin, every healed over scar. It’s like they’ve always felt like this, like it will always feel like this.
Draco raises his eyebrows. “That’s generally how time works.”
that you say to me-” Here, he took a heaving breath, clenching his hands into fists. “The first thing you say is- Merlin, Potter I try to give you more credit than this!”
He didn’t ask, because he already knew the answer.
“Maybe it’s Weasley,” Pansy said with a nasty laugh. “Wouldn’t that be a trip.”
“You can make them sing?” Hermione asked, looking quite impressed. Harry glanced over at Ron, who looked very interested in the whole exchange. Harry poked Ron in the leg with her foot in an attempt to distract her.
Draco didn’t move, just stared down at her like she was trying to find something to say but didn’t have any of the right words.
“More importantly, who are you asking?” Ginny asked, elbowing her in the side.
“And on that note, may you all have a safe and wonderful night,” McGonagall finished, the quartet restarting their music with the soft lilt of the violin. Harry opened her eyes slowly, exchanging warm glances with her tablemates that somehow spoke of the strange horrors they’d all seen, seen and walked through, scarred but not broken.
“I was wondering about that,” Harry replies, gesturing at Draco’s hoodie, Slytherin green but decidedly muggle.
“I’m not just helping you, it’s a case,” Harry says, though he’d camped out in Head Auror Johnson’s office wheedling until he’d been assigned it, taking on two leadless robberies in the process. He’d convinced himself it was to protect Draco’s privacy, but he knew at the end of the day that other Aurors would have done that. It had just seemed like the right thing to do. “We can’t have sixty four werewolves out and about in London. You were enough.”
Harry hears the door chime and looks over at the blue curtain, feeling absurdly affronted that life would intrude on them. Draco heaves himself up from the wall and straightens his jumper, walking past Harry and through the blue curtain. On his way past, he runs his hand absently across Harry’s forearm like he’s trying to comfort him, and phantoms of the touch remain even after he’s in the front room.
35. “Do you remember, when you cursed me, how much water was on the floor? I thought I would float away, if not in the water, then in the blood,” Draco said, a fire going in the fireplace, everyone else long asleep.
“No,” Harry replied with narrowed eyes. “It said I was afraid of it?”
They lurch back into the real world before Harry can figure out how he’d leave.
Luna shakes her head, looking pensive. “When I was being held at Malfoy Manor during the war, I received a series of small packages. The house elves would bring them down wrapped in little handkerchiefs and they would have a few candies or pastries wrapped inside. I think a few times there were a few flowers too, which was beautiful. I don’t know for sure that it was Draco, but I sent him an owl after the war asking him to thank whoever it was and he replied with a very polite apology and a few candies wrapped in a handkerchief. It was very kind.”
“Doesn’t quite flow like the other one,” Ron said, and Harry mumbled his assent.
Draco is nodding, a hard, thoughtful look in his eyes. Harry can see him turning the problem over in his head, nodding slowly as he begins to unravel it. “I can do that,” he says slowly. “It shouldn’t take too long, provided my hunch is correct.”
“I didn’t say you had to care, I’m just saying you didn’t,” Draco said, and Harry didn’t know how they’d gotten here, why she felt so bad for not liking Goyle who’d been nothing but just as nasty as Malfoy. She thought she should have a better defense but nothing was coming to mind.
Harry, despite himself, giggles, earning himself the most withering of disparaging looks.
“And Hermione,” Harry says, even though that’s probably pushing it. If they’re tempting disaster there’s no point in doing it halfway.
They leave Delia’s room a few minutes later, making their way through a few more rooms, visiting a boy whose body keeps flickering in and out of existence and a girl in a full body cast, Draco quiet and regal but for a few errant laughs at things the kids say. Harry’s leaving the room of a girl with skin reminiscent of couch cushions when he realizes he’s lost track of Draco.
“I forgot how tiny teenagers are,” Harry says. “I thought, fifteen, that’s a person, right? Wrong! That’s a child! Tiny! Why did they let us try to defeat the greatest dark wizard of all time as literal infants?”
“Record players,” he responds, then takes a slow breath like he knows Harry is expecting more of an explanation. “This one needs more lubricant on the spindle.”
“What did you read?” Harry asked, feeling an uncomfortable twist at Draco’s words even though he suspected that he was trying.
The 5 Strangest Things That Have Been Lost In The Forbidden Forest
I hope you’re well. I really do. I’m quite worried for you, you really don’t seem to be taking any of this very well. I’m sure things will turn around for you, but I’m a bit perturbed that I’m not going to be around to complain about it.
Harry gaped at her, the frustrated tears gathering at the edges of her eyes and the defiant set of her shoulders and tried to fumble around for words. “You really want me to leave you alone?”
Draco has accidentally stayed for breakfast before, as they all have, passed out on various couches and armchairs if Apparating or Flooing home seems too terrible to bear. Usually, it results in a communal brunch usually featuring multiple fruits and breads.
“Oh,” Draco said, a small smile curling across his lips as he stared at Harry. “Of course, it’s the forest.”
He tried not to brood over it as he hurried from Defense Against The Dark Arts to History of Magic, thinking with reluctant amusement that even if he did really reek of pond water, that still probably wouldn’t be the lowest point for his personal hygiene.
“Fine, Professor Moody,” he says frostily. It’s the most like his old self he’s sounded all morning. “My assistant Jasmine has a key, but there’s no way she’s involved. She’s fifteen. I realize that by fifteen you had defeated the Dark Lord multiple times, but I’m not using you as an example of normal fifteen-year-old behavior.”
12 Grimmauld Place
Pansy lets out a screech as Harry, who is sprawled on the couch, leans his head back to look over at Hermione, who looks like she’s beginning to regret her honesty. “What ‘Ermione?”
“Is that a come on?” Harry asks, and then, when Draco just glares at him, “Yeah, after shifts a lot when I’m too wired to sleep. It’s weird enough here that no one pays me much attention.”
Did Weasley ever tell you about the time he made out with Blaise Zabini? I expect he really wouldn’t have, you two don’t seem like that kind of mates. He might not remember, I think all parties involved felt quite terribly about it. I almost wish I was sending this, I’d love to see Weasley’s face once it all came out. Well, suffice to say it was fifth year and Weasley shouldn’t drink at Ravenclaw parties if he’s going to let himself go like that. Shame you lot never came to the Slytherin parties, and doubly shameful that they petered out so much once everyone got so terribly involved in politics.
“Indeed,” Narcissa replies, a hint of amusement in her eyes. “A smart match though.”
A string quartet played soft music as students continued to file in, until nearly all of Hogwarts was mingling underneath the floating candles. Harry still hadn’t seen Draco yet, which was worrying, since she’d had to explain her dress to almost everyone and if Draco had reneged on her promise to wear pink Harry was going to step on her feet during the entire dance portion.
Her eyebrows goes up and she makes a happy noise of recognition. “Oh lovely!”
He sighs and when he answers it’s the closest thing he’s come to the truth. “I don’t think I do either.”
“Swot,” Jasmine says instantly, which is extra funny considering that Jasmine is the one who’d scored a magic summer internship brewing potions. Harry will admit that Draco is also kind of a swot, even though with Hermione as his long-time best friend, his standards for what constitutes as swottery are fairly high.
“And that hurts?” Harry asked, quieter, wondering if he could swim just a little closer.
“I was trying to help Ernie!” Harry protested, wishing she could hit something. It felt like she was trying to fight a tornado, like the both of them were hurricanes smashing into each other.
“What exactly does this hatred feel like?” Hermione asked slowly, her eyebrows high on her forehead.
“Not too into dating,” Anthony replied with a careful smile. “You know how it is.”
“I’m trying not to think about anything but your hands,” Draco said, the honesty scraping his throat raw. “It’s for the best.”
“While I would like to believe I have the power to turn straight men temporarily gay,” Draco begins quietly. “You sound like you’re making excuses”
“It is easy.” Harry brings his face down so their foreheads are pressed together so Draco has to meet his eyes. Because Draco likes him and he likes Draco back. “We don’t have to tell the press or anything. Just our friends.”
“Yeah, I know,” Draco replies, that almost smile lighting on his face. Harry has the strongest urge to hug him, to make him laugh again, to acknowledge that this is so much more than it is at this point. “Bye Harry.” He blinks as the name leaves his mouth, and disapparates before either of them can say anything about it.
“Do you think?” Harry asked, sneaking another glance and meeting gray eyes. The bags under Draco’s eyes were much less pronounced than normal and his hair was artfully arranged like he’d actually put some effort into it. Harry was used to the way it stuck up in the mornings and he was a little irritated that Draco’d had the audacity to style it. “He looks fucking serene. I could just hex him.”
One of them notices and makes him introduce himself, and he’s telling them about Mrs. Weasley’s infamous christmas jumpers within minutes. One of the girls comes by with the bottle of wine, topping their glasses off even though Harry wasn’t planning on getting drunk.
“You’re worse than Hermione,” Harry says.
“I’m back,” Draco said irritably, stepping into the clearing. He looked just as tired as he had at the beginning of the year, the circles under his eyes recarving themselves like they’d been waiting to creep back in.
“Harry, my mate who I treasure, would you happen to know if Malfoy is any better at mending broken bones that you are?” Ron asks, holding up his now extremely swollen and purple hand. “We have a bit of an ongoing issue.”
Draco smiles as he leans into the kiss and Harry can feel his heart beating in his ears, almost too nervous to do anything but close his eyes and let himself be touched. Draco’s lips are smooth against his and they tease his into compliance, hands curling up into his hair.
“So what do you suggest?”
Harry starts laughing, and for a good minute, doesn’t stop. “That’s the worst apology I’ve ever heard in my life, and that’s including every apology Ron or Hermione have ever given.”
“Maybe not forever,” Draco replies. “This shop is a safe place, always was. I want this.”
“It seems so strange to me that the same pureblood idiots who hate Muggleborns and Muggles would be okay turning people into werewolves,” Harry says, chewing on his lip and working through the problem as he talks. “I can’t wrap my head around it. Either you care about blood purity or you don’t, I don’t understand.”
“I’m a bit afraid of you,” he said to them, crafting it like an apology. “It’s a secret. Slytherins shouldn’t be afraid of snakes.”
“No,” Harry replies, and barely even feels sheepish anymore. He thinks if Draco didn’t want to play this game he would have sent him away a long time ago.
“What do you mean am I sure? Of course I’m sure,” Draco says, like he knows what Harry’s trying to figure out how to ask and is offended that he’s even thought such a thing. “It’s certainly been tampered with. I’ve never made an imperfect potion.” He takes another imperious bite of crepe, and then concedes to Harry’s counter-argument, which is just to give Draco a dubious look until he caves. “Alright, well I really have never made an imperfect potion, but even if I had, this one would still have been tampered with. Whoever did it altered it in such a way that it looked, smelled, and behaved just like the real thing. That’s no accident. Faulty ingredients create faulty potions, only sabotage would be so undetectable.”
“Are you sure you two were watching the game? Or were you too busy heckling?” Neville asked mildly, giving both of them a sly grin.
Harry cuts carefully through strawberries and thinks of Malfoy’s face swimming before him in training: stern and cold and, ever so occasionally, savage.
“Yeah,” Harry said, watching the way the snake slid back into place, almost three dimensional even though it couldn’t be.
“No,” Draco replied, even as Harry saw the tears staining her cheeks and the slow melting of her eyeliner under her eyes.
Draco nods reluctantly. “Losing my vital organs would be more of an indignity than one more side-along with you.”
Harry shrugs, trying to play it cool, like they didn’t go to a school for kids with magic, like he and Draco were anything like friends. “We learned mostly.”
“Yeah, oh yeah,” Harry says, stumbling over the words as he pushes the radio onto the counter. “It’s not playing.”
“Not entirely,” Harry said, looking over at the mirror to inspect the damage. He was worried about his scarf covering it, Draco had placed it irritatingly high. He had the feeling the forest hadn’t invented that bit, it seemed like the sort of irritating shite Real Draco would do too.
“Mines still as dark as ever,” Harry said, gesturing up to the lightning pattern on his forehead that skittered up to his hairline. “Kinda thought maybe it would disappear when he died.”
Harry shrugs. “It was perfectly innocent.” He doesn’t really want to defend himself against this, but he doesn’t really have a choice when Hermione looks like she’s close to strangling him with the garland.
“Only because we both equally want to kill each other,” Draco gripes, shifting in his chair to rest his chin on his hand. It’s not the ramrod posture he usually slips into and its unsettling to see him so unhinged.
42. Harry places the small metal piece under his tongue, the decoy. One causes you to go up in smoke for real, one appears that way. Blood runs thicker than water, fire burns hotter than blood.
“Bet I can solve it before you,” Harry says, spinning around in his office chair, rewinding through the details of the day. There has to be someone else implicated, someone else to question from the stew of people and places that Rob had run them through. Harry consults his notes, considering witches, wizards, and otherwise, returning finally to the first line he wrote: you know how toads are with cucumbers. He rolls back further, when they knocked on the door and and Rob appeared in his wellies and asked if they were there because of Connie.
He waited for an answer unlikely to come, eyes drifting across the opposite bank until they landed on a figure directly on the other side. Draco held as still as he could, watching the figure look across the lake. It didn’t seem to have seen him yet and he wondered what the forest meant by it, giving him someone but putting them so far away.
Harry tried to look properly sorry. “Just joking.”
Harry raises his eyebrows to let him know that he’s very much aware of the situation. An idea pricks at him and he entertains it, even though it’s not strictly protocol. He’s not sure this situation could get any stupider, which is a little liberating. “If I promise not to bring you in, can we at least get out of the rain?”
There was no response from Draco, who pushed her hair back and cast a spell on the old phonograph, producing the crackly tune they’d been using to practice.
“Maybe not,” Draco said.
“Kiss my wounds?” Draco asks, looking slightly pale. “Is that… Is that what you Gryffindors do?”
Hermione starts, fumbles in her overlarge purse and procures both Harry and Dara’s wands, as well as two bags of various and sundry items. Harry is pleased to see his Auror pack and his favorite quill among the mess. Dara retrieves her stuff, yawning rather performatively. “Well, time to go see Jess. Good work everyone, this has been really fun, see you soon for another boring day at the office.”
“How do you feel about teal?” Harry asked seriously. “I think it would like nice on both of us.”
Harry hears Draco swear, but Ron begins to laugh, flinging open the stairwell door. “Oh, they think that’ll work? No Ministry hack is going to stop us, we’re the good guys.”
“Are you?” Draco asks. “But you look so nice like this, seems a shame to rush.”
“How should I know?” Harry says, feeling timelessness in the room again. He would almost think it was a charm except that he can’t sense the murmur of any enchantments.
Harry stared at him, dumbfounded. “What am I supposed to do, get in fights with you?”
“Awful,” Potter says, eyes sharp in agreement and not pity and Draco feels a quiet sensation of the word
“I’d write Luna myself,” Draco says primly, his glance flicking down to his watch. “I should go, I have dinner plans with Pansy and her new beau. I’m to either give her my approval or send him away like the others.”
Draco Malfoy
“How could you let anyone else do it,” Harry babbles, angry and incoherent. “Anyone who wasn’t you.”
What they learned in basic training buzzes in the back of Harry’s brain like a florescent cue card: you will know your partner better than you know yourself. “Would you want to get that close to Malfoy?”
“That’s really complicated spellwork,” Ron said admiringly.
“I’m sure you’ll have fun with Greg,” Harry said. “I don’t really know him, honestly.”
Draco gives him a long look, tilting his long pointed nose up into the cool air. “What if I told you that I know I’m bad?”
They’d taken small steps forward, maybe. The glances were probably not the worst, and Draco had helped him after Harry had defended him in the hallway. Not that a few civil words put them anywhere near calm waters.
Harry scanned the Great Hall slowly, finding the empty places at all the benches like he sometimes did during breakfast, when he was too tired to stop himself from doing it. As he was examining the places where old friends had once sat, his eyes fell on the Slytherin table all the way on the other side.
Harry wondered if she was trying to fix things again. She seemed to go especially kind after they’d fucked things up, trying to push them gently back together. He passed through the warm fog, seeing no sign of the blonde head he’d become used to stumbling upon and hoped he wasn’t making all of it up.
“I might literally be a genius,” Draco insists, and Harry lets it go when the frontwoman of the next band starts the set. They’re called Tin Girl Machine and they play songs that remind Harry of summer.
Draco Malfoy
“Where did you learn?” Harry pressed, and Draco grit her teeth, her attitude finally wearing through her silence.
“Scrambled eggs are the best,” Harry replies by way of explanation, watching an old woman talk about her family heirloom. It looks like a set of shitty plates, but Harry doesn’t know anything about antiques.
“Do you really?” Luna asks, and Harry scowls, because anyone else would have just agreed.
“Stop throwing my pigs,” Ginny says. “I left for one second. How did you get here?”
“Okay,” Harry says, pressing the bread onto the griddle with a sizzle. “I’ll meet her, that’s fine.”
“So you do know?” Anthony pressed, and Harry stepped on one of his feet.
“Whatever,” Harry replies, biting back harsher admonishments.
The desire to visit Draco at the store flits idly through his head even though he doesn’t think he’d be welcome. He wonders if Draco is even there today or if he’s off with his mother, planning all of the complicated ceremonial things that come after death.
“Yes,” Harry says firmly, though he isn’t sure which one of them is being crazy. Maybe all of this stuff about being compatible is in his head, a way of making sense of the ways that Draco hurt him, the ways that he hurt Draco. Running into every sharp edge someone has doesn’t make you fated, doesn’t make you fit together.
He thinks briefly about texting Hermione, but she’s at work and texting her would make all of this real. He’s in a repair shop and Draco Malfoy is behind the counter and somehow that doesn’t surprise him as much as it should. He allows himself to consider that maybe he’s been waiting for this sort of thing to happen for the last three years.
“Would you like tea?” they ask, casting a spell on a kettle secreted away in the corner. “I think you need tea.”
“No, not really,” Ron says, bringing the messy stack of unread mail into the kitchen and glancing behind him like he’s making sure Harry is still following. “But how are you feeling?”
“Okay,” She said calmly, still holding his hands.
In the meantime though, and most pressingly, he’s going to shampoo Draco’s hair.
Without saying anything about it, Draco released her into a spin and Harry took it with a laugh, nearly tripping over feet but coming back into position with all the grace she could muster as Draco pulled her back into the steps.
He doesn’t know why he can’t stay away, doesn’t know why seeing Malfoy like this makes Harry want to comfort him, makes him need to be comforted. He looks at Pansy’s face, red and blotchy with anger and something more desperate, maybe love, looks at the sidewalk that gives him no answers and at the passerby pretending not to stare.
The next day, he continued his militant avoidance of Harry. He didn’t look at him during breakfast even though he imagined he could feel Harry’s eyes scraping across the top of his head.
“Nope, not a chance,” Harry said. “This will be so much less of a trainwreck. And besides, if either of us are seduced by beautiful witches at some point during the evening there will be no hard feelings.”
“Haven’t gone over that in class yet,” Harry said, smiling because it felt like the right thing to do.
“You are not intimidating,” Harry protests, his eyes catching on Draco’s wrists, which are so delicate he almost can’t stand to look at them too long.
Harry drops his wand, bracing for the spell as it flies towards him. It feels different this time, his mind jumbling back into place like an upended box. He feels Draco as he shoots through his grab bag of memories, back at the warm corridors of Hogwarts, back in his spiderwebbed cupboard, back in the freezing forest their 7th year, the forbidden forest together their first year, the graves of his parents, a flash of green light, a flash of red hair, a slice of brutal pain, a serrated laugh that seems to go on forever.
“You’re not even trying,” Draco replied delightedly, still grinning. It looked odd on his face, and if it was anyone else Harry might have been fooled into thinking it was untarnished joy. “Do you even remember how?”
“She knows who I am,” Draco says idly, like it doesn’t bother him, and Harry wonders if that’s an act.
Lee appears at their table with two steaming-hot plates hovering above his left shoulder, Draco’s milkshake in his hand. “Did I hear you say something about divine justice?” Lee asks, lowering their food in front of them. “It’s served.”
“See you Sunday morning,” Harry says, a raindrop catching the lens of his glasses, another on the tip of his nose.
Dara looks thoughtful. “All that time you spent with your damoiseau still hasn’t given you any strong leads?”
Connie, upon spotting Dara and Harry at her door, whisks them immediately into her house, which is dark and very tartan-heavy. The air is thick with the smell of potpourri, all the window shades drawn in favor of pink-tinted light from two rather hideous lamps. As someone whose taste in furniture has been called ‘eclectic’ in a clearly derogatory way, Harry feels comfortable describing the design scheme as heinous.
“I have to go,” Harry says, standing up on unsteady legs. He thinks Draco wants to be held too, but they aren’t the sort of friends who hold each other. They aren’t even friends. “I have to go now, goodnight, have a good night.”
They finish the bottle of wine and Harry realizes as he sends Draco back through the Floo, that once the case is over, they aren’t going to have any excuse to do this anymore. He thinks, with a fair bit of surprise, that he might even be a little bit sad about it.
“Fine,” Draco says, looking quite perturbed. Harry has to admit that the Auror’s werewolf procedure of ‘find, assist, support’ seems a little stranger when it’s applied to his old schoolmate/enemy/accidental-gay-tabloid-scandal.
Dara salutes and goes to find the bathroom, leaving the rest of them sprawled out in the living room, quite exhausted and fairly trampled.
The knife is floating over to him when Hermione clears her throat from the doorway, still in her pajamas. “No knives in the air, please.”
“Did you make any progress on the case?” Hermione prods, crossing her legs in neatly pressed trousers. They’re wedged into a corner in the busiest sit-down lunch place in Diagon Alley, one with so many politicians and minor celebrities crammed into its plush velvet booths that no one pays them any mind.
Maybe Draco genuinely wanted nothing to do with him. Maybe Draco didn’t carry the spark of their fights and history in the corner of his heart like Harry always had. Maybe Draco didn’t want Harry in his life and they would be better off ignoring each other. It seemed incomplete, like after everything, all the real things and everything in the forest that had only been Harry’s, they should have deserved more.
“You haven’t exactly extended the hand of friendship,” Draco says. “You’re a hypocrite, Potter.” The sharp consonants of his surname reminds Harry too clearly of the moment of weakness when Draco had spoken his first name in soft exasperation. He wishes he didn’t remember, he doesn’t like how those thoughts connect.
“You watch me over breakfast,” Draco said, looking pleased with himself.
It’s a windy Tuesday when Harry apparates back to the shop, another radio under his arm, this one only picking up static. He thinks he should talk to someone about this whole thing, maybe invite Hermione over to lunch and tell her that he’s consorting with the enemy, but he’s a little afraid she’d tell him to stop.
“Do you want company?” Draco asked, her hand alighting on Harry’s shoulder. “I saw you leave, you seemed a little off balance.”
Draco nods, looking overly prim. He swallows and Harry watches the movement of his neck and thinks he might finally be losing it. “Thank you for permitting me to come.”
To tell her that he was sorry he couldn’t stay away from him seemed like too large a confession but he needed to apologize for something, one of the infinite things that were still wrong between them.
Pansy asked what was wrong with him quite nearly on sight, which was a record, even for her.
Harry places a tentative hand on Draco’s forearm, and Draco curses his adoration for long sleeves. Then again, if Harry was touching his bare arm, he might faint. He realizes, slowly, that they have been kissing for perhaps too long and that Draco is far, far too into it. But how to stop? He doesn’t really know. Harry is so pliant and eager and his lips are so soft. Draco wants to reach a hand up under Harry’s T shirt so badly it’s almost painful, and he feels as if he is only one wrong move from ending up in Harry’s lap holding him by his shirt collar.
“Ernie, are you having trouble learning the steps?” McGonagall asked kindly, only making Ernie look even more like he wanted to flee the scene.
Harry shrugged, flopping onto Ron’s bed with a sigh. “I think I’m doing something stupid and I don’t know how to stop.”
“How about your radio?” She gestures to the cumbersome machine in his arms.
“Great,” Harry replies, suddenly overwhelmed by how ridiculous all of of this should be. In the store, it doesn’t quite seem real, but taking it into the real world means that people could see them together, means that maybe this is actually something.
Draco realizes with a little chagrin that this is not, in fact, the first of these parties in which he and Pansy have called each other names. Hermione has her eyebrows fully in her curls and seems very unsure whether or not they’re actually fighting. Harry, on the other hand, looks like he’s very amused but is trying his hardest to look serious.
“Oh, right, because Slytherins don’t have feelings,” Potter scoffs, and Draco smiles despite himself.
Harry,
“I can’t just turn my emotions off,” Harry says, narrowing his eyes. The nausea has faded but he can still feel the headache and knows it’s only a matter of time before the whole thing bubbles over. “Some people would say that’s a good thing.”
“Tired,” Draco replies, curling into his hoodie. He looks small, Harry is always caught off guard by how small he looks when his chin isn’t tilted so high. “Why aren’t you drunk?”
Draco smiles at her as he detaches from the wall, pausing to give Harry a quick glance. “Do you think you- If you don’t, you know, have any plans, I mean other than pasta- You’re definitely welcome?” He grimaces, sweeping his hair out of his eyes, and Harry can’t remember ever being so transfixed by anything. Draco has a funny pleading look in his eyes and it reminds him of the bathroom in sixth year and of the first time they locked eyes and Harry’s nodding desperately.
“Are you seducing me?” He asked the forest with a carefully raised eyebrow. He thought he felt the forest laughing, and she was.
Harry shrugs back. “Me too.”
19. “You don’t talk much,” Draco said one day. They were in the kitchen, Harry chopping rosemary from his garden with a steady hand. “You were more talkative in school.”
56. “I’m going to need you to stop asking me to be safe,” Draco says, as he puts on his coat the next morning to return to wherever he’s staying now, with some group of Death Eater sympathizers or another. Harry makes an effort not to learn their names. “I don’t know how much longer I can say no to you. Don’t ask me again.”
“I’ll always think you’re charming,” she said, and she didn’t really bother to make it a tease. They barely have it in them to guard their compliments anymore and it’s so Hufflepuff, but Draco can’t be arsed.
“You’ve never dated anyone?” Harry asks, trying to sound nonchalant. He doesn’t think he succeeds, but Draco doesn’t make any snide comments about it.
“I wouldn’t have told you then.” She turned back to the window, her hair falling into her face. “I was thinking about Vince. He was a horrible dancer. Worse than Greg, and something about how you turned and laughed even though you hadn’t done it right at all made me think about him.”
Harry found no such sleep that night, because the forest hadn’t called to him yet. Harry lay in his bed until the morning hours, picking at the skin on the edges of his fingernails until they bled the scarlet of his bedspread.
“She just is, naturally?” Harry asked, wondering if perhaps she should play nice. Then, she thought about the way Draco screwed up her nose when she was trying to be catty, and decided that her response was completely justified.
“Luna’s using they them now.” Harry searches for something to say, has no idea what Draco would even want to hear about them, the strange person who lives in his attic. “They were canning last night. Making jam. Strawberry, I think.”
“Awesome,” Harry replies, thankful that they’re still pretending this is about that.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I think you say that about rules you’ve made up.”
“He just threw his cup?” they ask idly, and he appreciates that they don’t look at him like Hermione does, with searching eyes.
Do you ever wonder if things could have been different between us? I expect not, you were always so busy saving the whole damn world. That’s not why I’m writing. I’m not sure why I’m writing. I just feel very alone. I think somehow that you would understand that.
Draco looked away and Harry did the same, each finding points in the distance so it wouldn’t be quite so serious. Harry watched the faces of her classmates whirl by, Ron almost messing up as she stopped to give Harry a wave.
“The Forbidden Forest, though known to have the natural equivalent of a temper, seems to also boast a strong mothering instinct. There have been instances of children lost in the Forbidden Forest who have turned up safe and sound on the outskirts of the forest. They often boast tales of softly glowing leaves and sweets that hang from the branches. It’s unclear what the Forbidden Forest’s motivation for these acts of protection are, except that it may be able to sense when someone is truly alone and in need.”
“I think-” Harry clears his throat, trying to draw himself back into reality. “I think I have a crush on you.”
“She just had to wait it out and eventually she turned back,” Harry says. “This was when we were at Hogwarts together.”
“Are you sure that’s-” Harry started, reduced to gasping as Draco bit down harder, before drawing back and kissing Harry on the mouth like an apology.
Pansy giggled, watching Ron and Harry confer with their books before having another go.
“She outdoes herself,” Hermione agrees. “I feel like every year she’s knitting for three more people.”
Best,
Friday evening, he finds himself at a secondhand store buying an old, broken radio. He wants to pretend that it isn’t a conscious choice, but it was out of his way and he knows he’s doing it for a reason. He doesn’t go to the repair shop immediately, waiting until Saturday morning to trudge through the bustling streets.
Draco is regarding him seriously. “There’s a lot of delusion involved. For example: would I have let werewolves run around my childhood home? Absolutely not. Would Lucius Malfoy prefer that werewolves run around my childhood home if it meant he never had to look at a Muggleborn again? Oh, certainly.” He delivers the last part with an impressive amount of bitterness. “None of it holds up upon scrutiny, it’s just baseless fear of the non-magic world and of anything different than you.”
“You owe me a secret.”
Dara squints at him, mulling it over. “Maybe. Since he’s not thrown in here, I doubt it.”
“Uh huh,” Pansy says. “We’ll return to you. Longbottom, how did you kiss Harry?”
“Yes,” Draco replies quickly, then seems to shrink back into himself. Harry glances over at Hermione, who he can’t remember ever looking less impressed with anything in her life.
“It is my sincere hope that I won’t hear about any more problems from any of you,” McGonagall said, the steel in her voice making it sound like a threat.
Harry stiffens, but there’s no malice in Draco’s words. Draco disappears behind the blue curtain and Harry looks up as an older man shuffles in. He’s always surprised to find other people in this sanctuary, even though logically he knows this is just a shop. It feels like more, he can’t explain it.
“Do you think that everyone who dies, dies for a reason?” Luna asks, and doesn’t wait for Harry to answer. “I suppose you would, that’s such a part of your personal myth. No one’s death serves any purpose, Harry. It’s no different than pulling Death in Tarot, as likely or unlikely as pulling an ace…” they trail off, their elbow on their desk and their editing forgotten.
For a moment, Harry doesn’t think he’s going to answer, but then he turns to Harry, and then he does. “You don’t actually like me, do you?” he asks, every part of him so contained, so quiet. “After the Prophet ran those pictures you wouldn’t even look at me for like two years, and that’s fine, whatever, I get it, I’m a Death Eater and an idiot and I don’t deserve you, but then all this, you keep looking at me like, I don’t know Harry, like you’re in love with me. But I know you’re not, I know I don’t deserve it. Do you just like knowing that I’m kind of in love with you? Because that’s not fucking fair. It’s not fair.” Draco deflates, face flushed, his hands twisting over each other. “Please, please just leave.”
“Well you were!” Hermione replied, spearing her sausage and putting on a bit of a show of being indignant.
“Part girl, part cat. She was horribly embarrassed about it, but it wasn’t all that bad,” Harry says, smiling at the way Delia hiccups a little when she laughs. There’s a noise from the doorway, and Harry glances over to find Draco watching them, eyes transfixed on Delia.
Draco cracked a smile at that, delighted that Harry wasn’t planning on ignoring him. He leaned across Pansy’s table to get closer, amused at how Harry looked both confused and irritated. “You’re never going to get your table anywhere past your knee if you keep crouching like that. You have to stand up to do it properly, the spell hinges on how tall you are. Did you even read the book?”
Harry looks down at his feet. He doesn’t have any plans, because Friday is Hermione and Ron’s date night, Luna won’t be back from her research trip for another day, and Neville is drowning in marking. He doesn’t really have anyone else. “Probably making pasta. For myself.”
“I do think it’s quite funny that the only two options are friendship or murder,” Ginny said, joining Hermione in laughter. “That’s so Harry and Draco, like, if someone said that to me I’d be like ‘Yeah, I bet that’s Potter and Malfoy doing some dumb shit again.’”
“Cheers, HP.” Dara gives him a swift nod. At least a third of her wild, dark curls have ended up in her face after their night galavanting and fighting crime. Together, they’re easily the set of Auror partners in possession of the most chaotic hair, which they both take personal pride in. “Didn’t know this one would be such a runner. How late did he keep us?”
charm earlier. Outside, the rain has picked up to a steady drizzle, and Harry registers that it almost doesn’t feel like time exists at all. “If you answer all my questions, we can go home sooner rather than later.”
Draco looks helplessly torn for a long moment. “So do I.” He breathes in and out like someone relearning how. “I’m here because I want people to think I’m good. I want to be good.”
“Dara, I’m telling you to fuck off.”
“It’s true,” Ron replies, rummaging through the bag. He’s letting Hermione spearhead the decorating job, which is probably wise. “Our home is fucking mint. Clean as hell.”
“But you, don’t you hate me?” Harry asked, his voice sounding stupid and alien even to his own ears.
“Why?” Harry asked, irritatingly stubborn. “And now you’re being standoffish and rude.”
Harry can’t think about it for too long without wanting to scream, so he does, in the backyard in front of the tomato patch and then feels stupid for doing so. He wants so many things to feel like relief, but none of them do.
“Ginny helped,” Ron replied jovially, handing Harry the paper that dictated where everything should be placed.
“You know how I take my tea,” Harry says.
“Weren’t you raised by wizards?” Harry asks, tapping on the counter and watching as Malfoy avoids his gaze. “Most pureblood families don’t teach courses in radio repair, or so I’ve been told.”
“Certainly something more debaucherous than this,” Draco replies offhandedly. “Although I think I get points for fraternizing with the enemy.”
“Right,” Harry says, processing. He realizes Draco has no idea that Dara knows, and doesn’t think he’ll be too happy to hear about it. “We can’t do this off the record. We won’t be able to prosecute anyone.”
Harry feels a rush of frustration, begins counting down the days in his head. They only have a month, less than now. He’s already wondering what they’ll have to do if they can’t figure it out in time, if there’s enough backlog of the potion to keep everyone safe, if this is all part of some larger, more sinister plot. “Draco, we have to solve it.”
“Some combination,” Draco says, as airily as he can while Harry wraps his lube-slick hand around Draco’s cock.
“It’s pretty easy,” Draco says. “Considering how much I used to suck. Not hard at all, actually.”
“What would you have done after the war?” Malfoy replies, and it’s a genuine question. “If you were me?”
“High praise,” Anthony said with a laugh. “And friends, really?”
“I suppose,” Draco says, slurping a little on his next sip in a way that Harry is sure is supposed to annoy him. Draco makes as if to raise his wand, but Harry shakes his head, feeling almost nervous.
She gives him a smile that communicates that she’s sorry but not very sorry. “Seems that way.”
“I know,” Draco replies, then turns to look at him. “She thinks if we can get dressed up and have tea then everything will be okay just like it used to be.”
“What can I do?” he asks after a long minute, holding the bowl awkwardly in front of him like a limb he’s lost feeling in.
“It’s not that I don’t care,” Harry said, disbelieving. “When would I have had time to get to know your friends? We weren’t friends, we didn’t even like each other!”
“So are we doing this, then?” Draco asked, their noses brushing as Draco slid an arm around Harry’s waist.
“You’re alright as long as you’re not being distracted,” Anthony said pointedly, and Harry felt the absurd urge to trample on his toes in retaliation.
“I’m not oblivious,” Harry protests, even though he knows he so often is, and is cut off by the appearance of Belinda pushing through the curtain with a television in her arms.
“I am!” Harry protested, even though it was the farthest thing from the truth.
“She’ll never go for it Ernie,” Harry said, trying to get through the crowded hallway. She was quite nearly late, and definitely didn’t have time to gently talk him down.
, Harry thinks vaguely, and looks pointedly away from the lean, muscular lines of Draco’s shoulders.
“Well don’t bother trying, it’s a losing game.” Draco said. “Although you might actually manage it. As you were so kind to mention, I’ve never had any luck killing much of anything.”
“That’s fucked up,” Draco replies, fixing him with a hard gray stare. Harry wants to press his fingers into the hollows of his collarbones.
“Pasta is great,” Harry replies, and almost misses the answering smile that flits across Draco’s lips.
“I’m not sure, it was mostly wishful thinking,” Ron replied.
he thinks crossly.
“No,” Harry tried, not moving his hand and attempting to look innocent. It was without a doubt, a losing game.
34. “Which do you want?” Luna asked him, as if they were enquiring after his preference for lunch. “Justice or revenge?”
“Ms. Malfoy, Ernie says that he has been practicing and I hope that you will find it in yourself to continue to be patient with him,” McGonagall said, her voice stern. Any student less pleased with herself would have cowered, but Malfoy only stared resolutely back, a muscle in her jaw twitching.
Harry shook his head at him, looking, of all things, disappointed. “You held my hand last night.”
What if I called you Harry? I think it would make you mad and for that reason I’m tempted to do so. I bet you’re wondering why I’m writing to you instead of anyone else. Ha! Or you would be, if you were receiving these letters. I think that’s why I’m doing it, because I know I’ll never send them, not even if I’m tempted. I bet you’d read them all out loud to your little band of revolutionaries and laugh.
“Have potions helped?” Draco asks, a wry smile ghosting across his face. He can feel the cigarette burning up and he ashes it again but he doesn’t want to turn away to take a drag.
“Malfoy’s a good teacher,” Harry said, mostly because she knew it would make Draco stumble, which it did. Draco stepped on her foot in retaliation, nearly sending Harry into a fit of giggles.
Draco doesn’t move, just takes another slow sip of his tea. “I’m not responsible for what you see.”
Harry has never chosen anything but pain always chooses him, never further away than his shadow. He would cry if he thought he could, he would scream if screaming had ever been a relief. Harry always walks into the forest to die, this is no different.
“No,” Draco chances, knowing already that it does not sound believable. He is dumb. He is so dumb. He may be the dumbest idiot to ever exist.
“Hey!” Harry protests. “It’s not my fault that I keep getting kissed.”
“Think I haven’t let dumb things get to me?” Ron said, and Harry could hear deprecating smile in his voice.
“Oddly enough, I also didn’t expect to be doing this and so all things considered I think I’m keeping it together rather well. And I don’t really care if your room is messy,” Draco says, which makes Harry smile. “Would you get on the bed for me?”
“But if I go emerald you will?” Harry asked, already penning the owl to Anthony in her head.
Harry laughs, then takes another look at Draco’s face, and laughs even harder. It is strange to have Draco in his house, and he doesn’t quite know what to do with the fact that it keeps happening. It occurs to Harry that maybe he should apologize for showing up at Draco’s flat the previous morning slightly tipsy and definitely bleeding. “I’m sorry about, you know, yesterday.” Draco’s smile shrinks a little, and Harry wonders which part was the part he did wrong. “I got your letter right as I got home from the pub and I just invited myself over.”
Harry thinks that when he dies, he’d rather just be turned to ashes and be done with it.
He pushes through the curtain as a balding man pushes a tv onto the counter, Draco scrawling something on a sticky note.
“I’ve always thought it was so cool when girls did that,” Harry says, feeling like he needs to say something, hoping it’s okay, no longer sure what they are and aren’t allowed to do in the unwritten rules they’re following.
Harry thought that last time that she had almost died had merely been a dress rehearsal for this moment, in which she was actually dying, properly and entirely.
“I am,” Harry said, scooting over so Draco could sit on the sill as well, their knees touching in the middle. “I’m just sad, kinda.”
The pause pulled and stretched between them, thick like the air and incomprehensibly heavy. Draco had nothing to say to him so he pulled his hand away extra slow, replacing his thumb with the soft pressure of his mouth because if he knew anything it was that if you were kissing you didn’t have to talk.
Draco’s fingers dig into his shoulder every time his lips make contact and Harry has the absurd desire to laugh as he buries his face in his neck.
Ginny said to him one night that she didn’t know who Hermione thought she was kidding and that was when Harry realized who shot all of those holes into the tin cans out by his garden.
Draco tilts his nose into the glass. “Mmm. The bouquet, so complex. I’m detecting… hmm. It must be grape.”
“I was in the middle of homework,” Hermione added, sounding irritated despite her initial feelings about the ball. “I still have three readings left to do.”
“Great, we just have some questions about the particulars of your deliveries, it’s a new procedure,” Dara says, procuring her notebook. Harry pulls out his own, preparing for the long haul.
Harry almost laughs, and Draco scowls. “It’s not funny, push me out. What if I pushed now? Then you’d be upset and it wouldn’t be funny at all. Damnit, Harry.”
“It’s fine,” Draco said with no lack of bitterness, leaving a silence only filled by the humidity and strange animal calls.
“Did you have other plans?”
“Was that really necessary? Ever heard of a nice, calm ascent?” Harry asks, leveling a glare at Draco, who is staring at him with wide eyes.
Love Potions:
,” Harry says. “But
“And how are we going to manage that?” Harry asked.
. And
“I could have helped you,” Harry says, and Draco laughs again.
“It is my job,” Malfoy replies, and Harry imagines that maybe there’s a glimmer of something other than resignation behind it.
“He was having trouble,” Malfoy said as she came to an abrupt stop, twirling her long blonde hair between her fingers as if her charms might have any effect on Mcgonagall’s unamused expression. “So I was demonstrating.”
When Harry finally pushes through the door, he’s greeted by a rush of pop music that Draco pauses almost guiltily as soon as he hears the bell ring. There’s a buzzing from the back and the occasional clank of metal and Harry wonders if Belinda is back there fixing something.
“Does that mean you’ve forgiven me for last night?” Harry asked cautiously, and Draco frowned at the mention of their fight, taking a bite of peach so he couch ponder his answer.
“Me too,” Harry said. “Maybe that’s it. We’re just supposed to sleep again.”
Draco purses his lips, nose stuck the smallest bit into the air. “Well you weren’t exactly pleasant to me earlier were you?”
“So what do we do?” Harry asked, staring at him.
“Draco! Shield us!” He yells, and a shield bubbles up to enclose them, muffling the disorder of the atrium so all he can hear is Draco gasping for air as they lean against each other. Harry doesn’t expect that he has more than ten seconds to cast, and he glances over at Dara and Ron to make sure they can see what he’s doing.
Harry pulls the door open and slides into the backseat, half afraid that the door will fall off when he slams it shut. It quivers a little but the car doesn’t combust, which he takes as a good sign.
“What was that?” Ginny asked, whirling on Harry as soon as they passed, looking as she’d just seen Christmas, New Year, and the end of days.
He lets his arms fall back to his sides, and can’t decide if he’s imagined how quickly Draco casts his eyes to the ground.
“You into that?” Harry asks with a teasing look, sitting down on his own bed with a bounce.
“Of course I want to give up,” Draco says. “Of course I do, but we can’t lose.”
Blaise nodded, beginning to brush his teeth and leaving well enough alone. If there was anything Draco appreciated about the Slytherins it was that they knew when to push and when to just stand there quietly. Sometimes the act of being there was more important than anything they actually did. It wasn’t like he could go spilling his guts about what had happened, even to them. As far as he was concerned, it was over, he just had to get his stupid brain on board.
“It wasn’t anything weird,” Harry replies grumpily, as Hermione giggles into her napkin.
Quietly, without pretense, a soft rustling announced to him the presence of first one tiny snake, and then a few more. Draco clutched his wand more tightly and watched them slither closer to him, wide glassy eyes staring up at him in the dark.
“Do you think that’s what happened?” Luna asks.
And Draco looks terrified and he holds Harry’s waist in his hands. “I’ve never really done it before.”
Draco slept fitfully in the months after the Dark Lord’s death. He would sleep when he found himself in bed, always through the night, but he never felt rested, never escaped from that thin lip of sleep haunted by snakes and callous laughter. He woke every morning to an aching body and the taste of venom thick in his mouth.
Harry lost track of what to do with his hands, the knife in his hand, the hands in front of him. Draco’s hands were out of sight. “I guess you would.”
Harry touches the skin left exposed by the tears in the knit, running his finger across the raw edge. “I noticed, I was so impressed.”
A Full and Sordid Description:
The first night he visited, Draco found nothing between the trees but more trees. When he looked up, he saw the shy flickering of stars above the branches, before the forest became too thick to let the sky through. Draco was good at noticing things, and he noticed as much as he could as he took the paths through the dark deep.
“Haven’t a clue,” Harry said, looking up at the slowly shifting branches above him. “Well, I guess I have a few theories.”
First, was the darkness. The kind that sucked all the air out of a space and laced his lungs with something heavy. Then, was the noise, and there were three: hissing, biting, and sliding. Then there was the snake, creeping up up behind him, or in front of him, or onto someone he loved.
“Next time I shove my tongue down your throat, just remember that it’s pretty much the equivalent of a punch in the face,” Draco says, a wicked grin on his face.
Draco, in a panic, picks D. “Too many people, not enough wine,” he drawls, taking a drag of his cigarette. He thinks his voice might've shaken a little. He thinks he can blame the cold.
Draco knows that he needs to ask Harry if its alright to kiss him, but the idea of saying the words is so heinous that he nearly stands back up and walks straight out the door. Against his better judgement, he takes two calming breaths and stays exactly where he is.
He wondered if he could pour everything into it, all of his fucked up desires into the press of his hands and the knife sharp need to be cared for into the drag of his bottom lip.
He wondered which Draco was the real one, what he would be without his layers. He thought maybe he’d be the boy who stuck out his hand without ever thinking it wouldn’t be taken, the boy who clutched the sink like it could save him, the boy who held Harry the same way as he pulled him out of the fire.
“Are you ashamed of me?” Draco asks petulantly.
“You’d really tell them?” Draco responds, pausing his work to look at Harry, who shrugs.
Something in the way that Draco looks at him makes Harry know it’s the wrong thing to say.
Anthony covered a snicker, as did the partially-dancing mostly-eavesdropping students around them.
Harry tossed another sock at him, mostly in jest, as he was reluctantly endeared by their post-war relationship. Unlike he and Ginny, Ron and Hermione had fallen into each other just like he’d hoped they would. It was sometimes a mess of course, as Hermione had a tendency to overthink things and Ron was a bit pig headed even after he’d grown into himself, but it was also sweet and made them both happy.
Harry glanced first at the forest and then at Draco, and then at the forest again, trying to calculate what was possible, what the truth was between the boy in front of him and the boy in the forest and the boy who was supposed to be asleep, who was supposed to hate him. He tried to calculate, slowly, muddily like he was rising from the bottom of a very deep and murky pond, how they could all be the same boy.
“You don’t think, you just feel,” Draco replies, the corner of his mouth quirking up. Harry can’t tell if he’s back to joking and doesn’t know which is scarier. Draco lifts Harry’s wrist up to his lips and presses a kiss against the soft brown skin on the inside of it, keeping it there and holding his gaze until Harry feels like he should know something more than he did before it. He’s not entire sure what it is but it feels weighty and significant and a little bit like old magic.
I should stop writing before I make up something really stupid.
how much he wants him
They smiled. “Oh no, Harry, not at all.”
“Yup,” Harry replies. He’s running a hand over Draco’s back in a way that reads as both extremely tender and mildly possessive, which, if it continues, is going to ruin Draco’s life completely.
“Yes,” Draco says. He’s feeling quite accomplished for not folding either item, like he’s passed a tiny test he’s made for himself. “And you’re a slob.”
“I think,” Draco says manfully. “It could be hot.”
He lets out a sigh, skimming the article, something about unknown causes, something about the toll dementors have on the body. Harry feels a sharp pang of sympathy for a man he never had any warmth for.
Draco shakes his head, turning to look at him. Harry feels like he’s been cornered and doesn’t know how to leave. “There, that’s exactly what I mean. You devalue it and that’s completely ridiculous because you do so much good? Volunteering at hospitals and helping kids cast spells is incredible.”
Harry shrugged, the leaves waving slowly above his head. His hair was messy but it had a bit of its old shine back, not sad and frizzed up above tired eyes. He looked better and Draco wondered if looking was all of it. Draco wanted to cut him down the middle and see if he looked better on the inside. “I guess I’ll know when I am.”
Draco nodded, a proud tilt to his chin as he curled his fingers around Harry’s wrist. Harry wished he knew how to read him better, both this Draco and all other versions. He’d begun to like the idea that this was the real Draco, swimming to the forest in dreams he’d forget in the morning, that if given the inclination and right situation he’d really be like this. Any other explanation threw into harsh reality the knowledge that he was trespassing on Draco’s body and pouring himself into a projection of a boy who didn’t do much more than stare at him over coffee.
Harry nodded, feeling the rush of now familiar magic wash over him.
“I can personally corroborate that you’ve looked like that since exactly eleven and probably earlier. Your ability to look grumpy is unmatched.”
Draco had wandered from one hell into another. He had the remains of the Slytherins but he didn’t have his family anymore, a ghost where his mother had been, nothing left of his father. His own body was a minefield of unkind reminders, and he wanted a new one. New hands that hadn’t drawn blood, new mouth that hadn’t said things quite so sharp, new chest that hadn’t been ripped open, new heart that knew how to work.
“Not sure how defeating one of the darkest wizards of our time makes you under qualified but okay,” Draco replies, kicking him in the shin to punctuate it.
“But you’re the one who kissed me,” Harry replied, feeling a grating irritation at how whiny his voice came out. He’d been thinking in circles the whole day, wondering what to do but never assuming that Draco would be so difficult. He realized, belatedly, that he’d never considered that Draco wouldn’t want to kiss him again, and then, more slowly, that he really did want to kiss him. Any person would, he reasoned, Draco was a mirage made for him.
“Shouldn’t you be at the Ravenclaw table?” Harry asked, watching as Luna tore her muffin into neat pieces, looking as if she’d been there the whole time even though she certainly hadn’t been when Harry had sat down. “Who’s pretending not to look?”
Around them, the crowd has devolved into chaos in the competing desires to see what’s going on and get as far away from the all spells and jinxes as possible. Harry is vaguely aware that the voice’s message has changed and has started to repeat something about imposters in the ministry. He and Draco move in a slow circle, their shoulder blades brushing as they move, Draco’s elbow knocking into his. Everything smells like blood and he knows that they’re not losing yet, but they might be.
“Be good,” Draco says, and Harry has to close his eyes and focus very hard on not being pushed over the edge. “You look gorgeous like this,” Draco says. He says it like it’s easy to say, like it’s true, and it makes Harry tremble. He wants to beg to hear it again, over and over, until he believes it.
“For someone who has been very keen on being in my business, you seem awfully ready for me to leave,” Draco replies, looking thoroughly unimpressed. He redirects his attention to Antiques Roadshow, frowning at the rug the experts are examining. “They’re far overpricing that. The manor had one in the drawing room that we bought for half.” He seems to be making an effort at being extra-belligerent this morning, and if he weren’t camped out in Harry’s living room, he’d be worried that Draco was truly upset with him.
“Didn’t Pansy say something about you not drinking?” Harry asks, rifling around his tea cabinet.
he thinks. He is not about to give Harry a mediocre kiss, especially not in front of everyone, especially when he would rather literally die than ever try to instigate something like this ever again.
“Quite,” Draco agrees, bopping his head to the music. “Hogwarts was a home to me, especially when things were less than ideal at the manor. If I had gone back I might not have... you know.”
The forest didn’t answer, just swirled more delicate indigo petals in the air.
He took the slow route around the lake, finally arriving to where Draco lay in the late afternoon sunlight. He stirred as Harry traipsed across the grass, passing near where he lay on the blanket, the smallest smile growing on Harry’s face when he felt Malfoy’s eyes on him.
“That’s not what...” Harry trailed off, his eyes closing so he could try and think. He knew what he wanted, but it was never going to be as simple as that. He thought Draco was trying to convince him that if it wasn’t real then it didn’t matter, even though that sat so wrong in his stomach. Just because they could be anything between the trees didn’t mean it wasn’t important, that it didn’t change him. Even in mirage it mattered to him.
Harry shrugs, taking a guilty sip of tea. He can’t imagine Ron’s reaction, but, considering he was the only one to be just as suspicious of Draco as Harry was, it probably won’t be pretty. It’s not like Harry has any justifications for his actions to persuade him. “I’ve been talking to Draco.”
“I personally like ‘The Boy Who Died Part 2,’” Ron suggested. “I think it has a nice ring to it.”
They’re a venn diagram with Draco in one circle and Potter in the other and they’ve spent their whole lives with too much overlap in the middle and now Potter’s doing it all over again.
“If by that you mean, ‘do I have detention’, the answer is yes,” Harry replied, shoving her book to the side and giving them a smile. “Why, do you have grand plans?”
Hermione and Ron were braced shoulder to shoulder by the sink, his arm tucked protectively around her waist as Hermione told Harry for the third time that she thought it was a trap. Harry couldn’t figure out how to believe her. Ron took that tone, somewhere between apologetic and condescending, and told Harry he’d always been weird about Malfoy. Harry didn’t think he’d been weird about Malfoy, he thought he’d always been right. Luna had said that both could be true and if it had been anyone else, Harry would have snapped at them. He kept his mouth in a thin line and felt guilty anyway.
McGonagall nodded. “Perhaps we can arrange for some separate lessons for you. I firmly believe that you are capable of leading Mr. Macmillan.”
“Because there’s literally no outcome that doesn’t mean...” Draco stood up as straight as he could, watching the top of the door so he wouldn’t have to look at Blaise. He didn’t know if he could say it, if it was too much to admit. “I get hurt no matter how it ends.”
The forest made no effort to respond and Harry wandered on, nearly tripping over stray branches, remembering the swinging light of the lantern the night of their detention, the real Draco small and terrified of the dark. They’d been together in the forest once and maybe it was poetic that some version of them was together in the forest again.
Harry wonders how much she’s heard, wonders how much even makes sense to her. He knows Draco probably hasn’t told her anything about himself but Harry thinks she might have the quiet perceptiveness gifted to many gray haired women.
Harry looked up at him for one slow moment, and then sat up in alarm, his hand clutching Draco’s even tighter as he reached blindly for his wand with his free hand, pointing it wildly at the forest. “What happened? Where are we? There was a snake and-”
Draco hushed her hastily. “No, we didn’t go skinny dipping, and we wouldn’t go without you even if we did.”
Draco nodded, clutching her hands and closing his eyes and trying to breathe like a normal person. He thought of Harry and his bloody fingers and the way he shook and his conviction that he couldn’t be loved and tried to find calm.
“Elbow up. It’s sagging. Again,” Draco criticized, her frustration apparently overriding her desire to freeze Harry out with silence.
“I don’t know if that’s encouraging or not,” Draco replies, straightening like he’s pulling himself out of the conversation.  “Let me get your radio, might as well pretend you’re here for a reason.”
Draco raises his faint eyebrows and Harry is relieved to find he looks somewhat mollified. He thinks that the Draco of their sixth year or even right after the war would have bolted by now. He still looks like he was recently dragged from a swamp, but he’s not going anywhere. Harry is still turning it over in his head, what it means that there’s a version of Draco that wants to do the right thing, even though it’s neither easy nor glamorous.
“I’m dreadfully upset with you,” he finally decided was an appropriate response. “And I think you’re awful and cruel and full of yourself.” But I think I missed talking to you and I was only mean to you last time because that’s the only way I’ve ever really talked to you. We could try something different, if you wanted. Draco swallowed the unspoken part down with peach juice.
“Anthony, have you found a date to the Yule Ball?” Harry asked, swerving the conversation out of Draco territory.
“Stuff?” Hermione asked, looking dubiously down her nose.
“Will you be back tomorrow?” Harry asked, trying to sound like he didn’t care, like it didn’t matter. If what mirage Draco had said was true, about things that weren’t real not mattering, then maybe real Harry wouldn’t have such a large pit in his stomach. As it was, he almost wanted to wrap his arms around Draco and not let him fade back into the trees.
“No,” Draco says, because he’s actually wiped his hand completely on Harry’s stomach and it’s really mostly clean now. Harry does some wandless cleaning magic on both of them that Draco is actually very impressed by, and then turns on his side so he can fling an arm across Draco’s waist, tugging him close.
“I like knitting,” Hermione repeated, though she was smiling. “Do you know how to make anything? Maybe we could do a trade?”
Never ask a boy about his skin.
I can’t sleep, I pretended to use the loo because I can’t sit in the drawing room with mother and father anymore. The air is still and we’ve run out of small talk. There is nothing to talk about when you’re on the lip of death.
“Potions aren’t miracles,” Ron said around a mouthful of mash. “No offense, Harry.”
Draco sneers at him, looking surprisingly threatening for someone essentially wearing a toga. “Potter, I will skin you.”
He does. Hermione makes them recount the epic rescue and looks appropriately scandalized by how messy it ended up being (“I had no idea they would actually try to
They kissed until they began to stumble, heads too clouded to continue. They clutched at each other so they wouldn’t fall, kept their eyes closed so they wouldn’t have to see.
Harry’s form was often sloppy and in the black heat of a fight he had trouble remembering all the new spells he should, but his magic made his body thrum with a brutal strength and he didn’t often lose. Magic was the only thing that always felt right on him, even if it didn’t always feel safe.
“Nice hickey,” he said, affecting something of his old swagger, trying to get Harry to play along with him, trying to forget that everything was so dire.
Harry pressed against him, rubbing his cock against Draco’s thigh as he jerked him off. He was vaguely worried they’d tumble over, neither of them in possession of enough of their faculties to stand.
“Hey.” Harry’s voice drifted through the forest and he turned, his breath hitching but not out of control. Harry appeared like he always did; in his ragged pajamas with his hair a mess, old sneakers on his feet. The bruise on his neck showed up sharp in the forest light and Draco felt a faint glimmer of pride in it.
“Pansy is terribly suspicious,” Draco says, flopping down on the couch and pulling the eggplant blanket over his legs. He looks pleased about the whole thing, and Harry has the paranoid suspicion that he’s enjoying this ‘secret relationship’ thing quite a bit. He thinks he might be having trouble with the idea that Draco is interested in him at all. “Apparently she tried to visit the manor the day I was at yours and none of the house elves knew where I was.”
“Hermione said I looked nice!” Harry had protested, and Draco had let out a pitying sigh and whisked him to The Well Dressed Wizard to pick out something he deemed suitable.
“Maybe.”
The room is vaguely familiar, something jarring in Harry’s memory as he stares at the at the trim, which has a distinct kind of flower pattern molded across the top, as if it was sloppily painted over when the room was made completely white.
“Sorry?” Harry asks, lifted out of a mental tangent involving duct taped chairs and an intangible feeling of safety.
He was very careful not to look up as he made his escape, but that didn’t stop Draco from staring him down with annoyance in his gaze. Draco gave the boy who had thrown the paper at his head a withering glare that he hoped communicated just how much he didn’t need saving from firsties by messy haired golden boys.
He was in the same foul mood when he made his way to the forest, after fielding conversations with Pansy and Blaise that involved pointed questions about Harry’s forays into hallway heroics.
“Something like that,” Harry replies, feeling sheepish. He doesn’t know why he always ends up spilling so much, why he keeps giving and giving in the hopes that Draco will give him something back.
“Wouldn’t that be so exciting,” Draco says, flashing the first hint of a mischievous smile Harry recognizes on his lips, but has never seen directed towards him.
“I don’t know,” Harry says. “When I said it- I don’t know, I did I guess.” He can barely speak by the end, too nervous and tongue tied. Calling it a crush makes all of the feelings he didn’t know how to label make sense, they’re an explanation he knows everyone will believe, and they open up a whole new vat of problems he can’t begin to handle.
“You really like working here, don’t you?” Harry asks, because a muggle repair shop has always seemed like an odd choice, but Draco has never expressed any desire to leave. “You could probably do something else at this point, you could even volunteer with me if you wanted.”
Harry watches the place he’s vacated with amusement and brings his fingertips up to his lips. When he pulls them back, they come away red.
Draco let out a long, irritated sigh, sliding off the desk. “Well I don’t suppose there’s anything better to do, is there?”
It was an unholy deluge like no rain he’d ever seen before, thick and pounding on the path until it ran around his bare feet in rivulets. He could barely see in front of him so he stood in the middle of the path and finished the peach, tilting his head up towards the sky and letting himself be clean. He listened to the pounding of the rain on dirt and paused only when he heard the sound of another person through the rainfall.
“I’m very aware,” Draco said, and Harry thought it was a good sign that she was being snide again instead of letting her emotions wash across her face. Harry was always open but Draco was tightly wound and only let the truth seep out when there was nothing left to hold it in.
He read them slowly, even their brief snippets reading in Draco’s high, clipped voice.
“Are you just making that up?” she asks accusatorially, and Draco shakes his head. “Ask one of the nurses to get you a flower code book, they’re all in there.” He pauses for a moment. “Harry, I know you’re out there.”
“I didn’t press when I first found out because I thought you had it under control,” she says slowly, leaning against the table and watching him. It’s an intervention and he wants out. “But Pansy wouldn’t owl me if she didn’t have a good reason and that worries me.”
Draco makes a sour face, setting the box down next to his cauldron and beginning to spell portions of the brew into the small, blue bottles. “The potion’s ready if anyone is interested.”
“I thought we both liked teal?” Anthony asked, squinting at her like she was speaking nonsense. In his favor, his coffee was fairly full and he had bags under his eyes.
Harry nods. The furrow he has between his eyebrows could not be more charming. He looks like he’s having a difficult time doing whatever he’s trying to do. It’s this more than anything that makes Draco positive that Harry is about to try and kiss him again.
“I know. Alabaster, really?” Draco says with a pinched expression. “
Harry tries to leave the repair shop behind, visits kids in St. Mungo’s and leads seminars about Defense Against the Dark Arts and searches for that fluorescent calm but doesn’t find it. Ron plays Bowie and The Rolling Stones on his record player, they drink cheap wine and talk about Hermione’s promotion.
“Don’t take this the wrong way, but is there any chance you might, maybe just a little, like her?” Hermione asked pointedly, startling a laugh out of Harry.
Harry tries to wiggle out of her piercing stare. “We’ll have a better idea of what we’re dealing with once he finishes up the potion test, then we can see how many other shops are affected and go from there. In the meantime, we still have to treat it as an emergency whether we trust his word or not.”
Draco takes another sip of tea, dabbing at his forehead with his sleeve. “You just can’t think anything except for ‘out.’ That has to be the only thing you feel. Your mind has to be empty.”
“You don’t sound like me, that was terrible,” Draco says, with a much softer delivery than he’d normally go for. He’s not sure how much longer he’s going to be able to sustain banter, which is usually the last thing to go for him.
If he’d told Hermione the truth, she might have drawn the sorts of conclusions that would have kept him from the forest, but he never mentioned anything about it even as she badgered him about his late night jaunts. Perhaps subconsciously he had his suspicions and didn’t really want to be kept away.
“I seem to remember you owning a lot of pink,” Harry said, recalling Draco flouncing around in a bright pink cloak in the winter of their first year. She’d been a bit jealous of it at the time, but in retrospect it was quite hilarious.
The band is setting up in the tiny front room and they’re both handed heavy glasses of wine and ushered towards the couch by a small girl with cornrows. Harry takes a tentative sip of wine, trying to steady himself as Draco sits down next to him, overly aware of how much their thighs touch.
“I’m reading the book,” Draco said, fumbling to pick it up, shoving it into Harry’s lap. “You told me to read muggle books.”
“It’s surprising how things come together.” Harry has the distinct feeling that Draco’s also talking about him.
Dara does a bit of a double take. “You trust him.”
“None of your business,” Draco replied, snatching the book from Harry’s hand on the last syllable. “Goodbye, Potter.”
However, he did suppose it was better than what many of the Slytherins faced. Some of the younger students, Gryffindors mostly, although Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws weren’t exempt, seemed to find a lot of joy in tossing insults and wads of paper at any Slytherins they passed. Harry wasn’t sure where they’d picked it up, since most of the returning students had elected to pretend the Slytherins didn’t exist. In fact, Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d spoken with any of them outside of class.
“Draco, don’t be mean to Harry,” Belinda says, coming over to get a screwdriver.
“I’m not exactly known for my bravery, there’s a reason I wasn’t in Gryffindor,” Draco replies with a half smile.
Malfoy’s eyebrows raise and he shrugs. “Well, that’s new.”
I didn’t even send that last letter, and yet I still manage to feel horrible about it. When I titled this letter Potter it felt really dramatic and angry but now it just looks stupid. I’m going to try again.
Eternally Yours in Hatred,
Harry re-briefs Jasmine on the case, taking down her versions of how each supplier hand-off had gone. She refers to Calypso as ‘bonkers as shit,’ Opal as ‘a space case’ and Rob as ‘Smells Like Frogs.” Harry almost asks what frogs smell like and then decides he doesn’t need to know. She corroborates most of the information they already have, but does mention that Rob had seemed out of it during the delivery, though she hadn’t thought anything of it at the time.
Harry blanches, words stuck in his throat and Malfoy laughs again.
She thought maybe she was doing an okay job of it, making an effort to correct her posture as Draco whirled her around the room, even shoving her elbow back level when it drifted down. Though Draco had an frustrated glint in her eye as she guided them, she said nothing even as Harry tripped over her own feet.
“Is it true then, that you died?” She asks, setting a plate of rather strange looking biscuits in front of them.
Harry,
Draco laughs. “Scared, Potter?”
“Of course it does,” Anthony replied with an eyeroll, and that time, Harry really did tread on his feet.
“Lee does some Wheezes stuff with Fred and George,” Harry says, smiling as the moon on his menu gives him a roguish wink. “He’s good with a charm.”
“Do I look pretty?” Harry asks cheekily as he meets Draco’s eyes, marveling at the way the lipstick changes the way his lips feel.
“You aren’t balls at anything, Harry,” Luna says, seeming to pull from their well of patience as they come over to walk their fingers gently up his arm. Their hands are stained berry red and their hair is up in a wildly printed scarf and they’re ethereally comforting.
“I didn’t mean anything by it, Malfoy,” Harry replied, growing tired of justifying himself to an apparition. “It’s like you want me to go back to being rude to you.”
“Flattered,” Harry says.
“I do know,” Harry says, glancing up when the waiter brings the check and throwing a few coins on the table before Hermione can reach for her purse. “Here, I’ve got lunch, thanks for letting me talk through the case. I’ll see you for dinner later this week?”
“I’m not sure I can do this,” Harry blurts out.
you! We did the right thing by getting you out of there before I went to the council.”) and is very impressed by everyone’s heroics. Draco even flushes pink instead of fussing when she exclaims about how brave he must have been, probably because Hermione is quite convincing about that kind of thing. Hermione then debriefs them about the finer points of the council showdown and her plans for tomorrow’s epic deposition, which, if the prologue is anything like the actual show, may cause the Filbins to wither and die on sight.
Harry nodded, squeezing Draco’s hand as she caught sight of Luna smiling in the candlelight, Ginny laughing at something her partner said, feeling the absence of darkness like nostalgia for something she’d never really had.
Harry, who really would prefer to be kissing Draco in warm water instead of against cold tile, summons his remaining self-control, takes Draco’s face between his hands, kisses him on the mouth, and says. “Be good for once in your life and let’s get in the shower.”
He feels the tug of the spell, the curious twisting sensation of leaving his body and entering the slipstream of Draco’s thoughts. He registers the moment Draco’s barrier goes up, and he finds himself back in his own skin after barely a moment.
“I wanted them to be afraid,” Draco said. “Like I was.”
“It’s alpaca,” Hermione clarified, handing over the finished mitten for him to try.
“I just like pretty things,” Greg said, chancing a glance at Draco - who was smiling at him - before smiling as well.
Draco rolled her eyes, a reluctant smile tugging at the edge of her mouth. “I think he’s even more excited than when he thought we were wearing plum.”
Harry doesn’t answer for a long moment. “Didn’t really manage, but I had a lot of people who cared for me. Molly, mostly. She’s been like my mum.”
“Why on Earth were you having a picnic?” Hermione asks.
Harry scrubs at the dishes, setting them in the drainer to dry. He knows they’ll sit there for at least another day before he bothers to put them away, but it’s a start. “Sunday is my cleaning day. It’s Saturday, so technically you’re here on the worst day.”
Draco’s lips quirked up at the memory, even as the other half of Blaise’s comment sank deep into the darkest parts of his heart. “And if only that first bit was true,” he said, picking up his bag with a huff. “Let’s go to breakfast before I give up and go back to bed.”
Draco nods. “We communicated with bouquets during the war. Mother thought we had a courtship, that was quite a surprise for her.” He pauses, sticking his hands in his pockets. “Begonias still make me feel ill.”
“He told me I looked like I played sports,” Harry protests, feeling a little ridiculous about the whole thing. Draco looks endlessly amused with him and Harry doesn’t know how to deal with that sort of thing. “That’s not like, secret code is it?”
“I didn’t know,” Harry repeated, the softness in Draco’s features making her nervous. She didn’t know Draco could be that soft, that her pointy features could look warm like that when talking about something she loved.
He’d never be able to face Draco again, not after the sounds he’d made, the way he’d clutched at his shirt and pulled him closer. He’d imagined all of that, had wanted it in some sick part of him. He knew it was wrong, knew Draco would be disgusted, perhaps even past the point of amusement and to a mere haughty up tilt of his nose and a sneer.
