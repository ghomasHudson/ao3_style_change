"They say that love is watching someone die."  He swallowed.  "They're all gone.  I've no parents.  Dumbledore's dead.  Hermione, Ron and Ginny, all gone."  He looked longingly at Draco.  "So, who is going to watch me die?"
Wolfwood harrumphed as if his family line had just been defamed. "Of course we can contain the parts of the artefact, Mr. Potter." Harry flinched, and as Wolfwood dove into explaining the exact detail on how the containment field was established and the specific spells used in its creation and maintenance, Harry's eyes glazed over.
"Are you all ready?" Margie, their waitress, asks.  She counts up the forty-some people in the banquet room and starts numbering her notepad.  "Separate checks I assume?"  She's done this before.
Remus nodded, smirking. "Okay. We'll set up a place for you tonight, Draco. Want me to take your bag?" Remus asked.
The snake remained motionless, and Harry sighed wearily.  He was so tired, heavy, like he'd just finished a marathon.  With resignation, he lay down on the ground again, his head resting on the cushion of his arm.  His mind felt foggy and grey, his eyes like lead, and in this moment, somewhere in the middle of a forest with a snake watching over him, all seemed at peace.
"Ah, yes." The man stood and turned to rummage about in a filing cabinet behind him. He pulled out a small piece of paper, hard like a Muggle business card. Written out in block letters: Mr. Argyle Popicon, Research in Antiquities and Relics.
He stood in the doorway and stared down at the resting man.  Harry's facial muscles were slack in sleep, completely free of all tension from work or the world.  A dark halo of hair surrounded his face on the white pillow giving him an air of something preternatural, otherworldly like the fae.
He loved that Potter was a screamer.  He reached for his wand and spelled a puddle of lubricant in the palm of his hand, and with eager, shaky hands, he dipped his finger into that tight hole.
Draco boosted himself up on his elbow and leaned forward to look at Harry's face.  The overhead light that lit their room hiding nothing of his own anguish.  Draco wanted to leave him.
"I have business to get to anyway. Thanks for coming in, it's always good to see you." The Chief Auror's tone rose in pitch, like someone trying to hold in a laugh, or maybe a sob. Harry finally darted a glance at the man.
With a new goal and the will and need to do something, Draco clambered down the length of the long cave.  Even with his specialized vision, the shadows and dark recesses still held majority within the cavern.  While he didn't have to check every one—his keen nose would tell him about the existence of water—he still searched those that looked like they might be large enough passages to branch off deeper into the mountain.  It could be an exit and he couldn't miss that chance.
"Hello!"
Harry swore he heard an exasperated sigh from the woman standing next to Draco. "You haven't eaten yet, sir," she said. "Perhaps an offer of dinner might cover any debt."
"You struggle. Your life is always a struggle."
When he finally came to, even with the pounding of a 10 tonne sledgehammer attacking his temples and warm liquid trickling down his face into his eyes, he felt lighter.  He almost laughed he felt so free.
Pressure settled on his chest, forcing the air from his lungs, stealing his breath away.
and there
"It is the gift of the Fae, silly wizardman.  Everyone here earns freedom."  The fairy flew down to land on Snape's nose, only to get kindly brushed aside.  "The snakeman was given the Freedom of Choice."
He only longed for a quiet life, away from urgent deeds like bad guy slaying, world saving, kitten rescuing.  Well, he didn't so much mind rescuing the kittens.  Though he preferred puppies.
But it wasn’t Arthur, or Kingsley, or anyone else he would have been happy to see.
It'd actually been an odd action, something he hadn't even put any thought to and almost admonished himself for doing something so foolish, when Sirius's form seemed to grow opaque. And then he sat on the bed.
"Potter, while we're here, shall I call your wife?"  He tried to sound snide, mean even, reminding the man of his responsibilities but then Tufts' ears shot up.
"So, can you fix me, doc?" Harry asked through a yawn.  This daily routine of examining Harry and then testing a potion or spell had become all too familiar, and Draco had become irresolute, not expecting anything new, anything promising.
"Thanks."  Something about Draco seemed lighter; he looked less sunken, less like the walking dead.
"You could say that." He took a sip from his glass and winced. It was terrible. He set the glass down on the scarred and scorched table. "What's new?"
"We're out of there," Harry said.  "We're free."
"'What ifs', we can't do much about those.  I trust you.  You won't drink too much.  I offer you this…me.  Please, take it."
“You ordered
A high keening of "Yes, oh God, right there, don't stop, Draco, my God, Draco," filled the air, urging Draco as his tongue danced across and within the relaxing entrance.  Ramming his face up against Lily's arse, he impaled him with his flexible muscle, dancing within that heat, dining and eating arse like he'd never done before.
"Fuck, Potter.  Why are you doing this?  It's me.  You
"From his last correspondence I think he has most of the theory worked out.  Now he just has to brew and test it."
"Hey, what…" Draco asked, his lips red and wet.
"He's a good friend, but that's all.  I realized, since MMAD has been hot on my heels," he chuckled and then his voice took on all seriousness, "that I miss the wizarding world."  He squeezed Draco's hand.  Draco squeezed back.
Draco'd become bad-tempered as the night drew on, and Harry realized he was probably hungry, guessing he hadn't gotten much feeding the night before since he'd been knocked out cold.
Harry stood before the full-length mirror, recently transfigured out of a smaller one that usually hung from his wall.  He pulled at a cuff and straightened the collar of his dress robes, deep burgundy with silver threading.
Taken aback, Draco sneered.  "Of course, you do, Potter.  We only went to school together for six years.  Lose a few cards from the Exploding Snap deck?"  Repeatedly squeezing his hands into fists, Draco switched his weight from one leg to the next.  There were too many people in the tiny office.
Harry nodded.
He heard the man gasp and pull out his finger only to slam in two.  Harry gulped, and thrust his cock against Severus' thigh.  The pressure inside and out was divine.
Harry stared up into the sky.  "It isn't my wand.  It's some dead guy's… a Death Eater's!"
He poked his head into the fire and called. "Hermione, are you there?" He waited for a few moments and upon hearing no reply he walked through.
"And neither can I."
"Wha—" His attempt to speak became nothing but pitiful squeaking through his dry, raw throat.  Malfoy, facing the corner, turned in slow motion towards him.  His blond hair was the color of sludge and fell across his face in stringy lengths that failed to hide the bruises forming over his left eye and bridge of his nose.
It took only a few exchanges before Draco realized something was more off than normal with his sidekick.
"Come look, everyone."
The agents Kingsley had sent contained the last of the underground wizard compound. Kogelmann was carted away, silent yet glaring daggers at Ron and the others. Harry, Draco, and Remus made their excuses after answering the agents' questions and returned to London together.
Some people sought out his kind to cheat death.  Maybe that was Malfoy's bent.
The dainty woman was slamming her heel into Snape's side where he was curled up tightly, and Rowle was leaning over Draco, who was sprawled across the man Harry'd brained.  The bastard leered at Draco,
And then he was man again, lying below Sirius, whose curious expression and cocked smile bubbled a delighted laugh from Remus. The sound echoed into forever.
men, Pansy.  I do one person…
"I was thinking of going down there." He watched Kingsley closely. "See if I can help him out."
.  One of them previously labeled Most Sought After Bachelor by
"I'm fine," he said into his pillow.
"Tell me what?"
He found himself outside of St. James Park, one he visited often. Stumbling on weary legs he wandered in and found a bench under a large evergreen tree, a fir he thought. It smelled clean and fresh. Everything smelled better out here. He sat, pulling his collar up around his chin, and quickly dozed off.
"I know, I know… just….  Use common sense.  I know
"Oh come off it; at every turn you do something stupid to piss off your father and his Ministry."  Pansy took a step closer to him, jabbing him in the chest with her sharp fingernail, so deep red in colour that Draco wondered if it was actual polish and not evidence of what happened to the last person who'd annoyed her.  "Gassing the Auror's training centre.  Casting the Imperius Curse on Ministry personnel.   Random bombings in populated areas where your father was speaking.  Torching your own home.  Were you even thinking?"  Her fingers wrapped around the linen of his shirt.  "Should you have been sorted into Hufflepuff?"
"No, not wrong," Harry said excitedly.  "Hermione seems to be doing a little better, actually.  I can feel her – you know, like how I told you – feel her magic.  It's stronger.  I brought in Crookshanks, not sure if he had anything to do with it or not, but I figure it couldn’t hurt.  But now I can feel her magic even more."  He grinned.
Harry waited as his murky thoughts and jumbled brain slowly realigned and began to work once more. He rose from bed and examined himself in the mirror. He looked like shite. Patting down his hair he went to talk to Draco, wondering exactly what had Draco in this brood.
"But… he is alive, then?" Harry asked, perched eagerly on the edge of his chair.
One fluffy cloud strolled across the pale blue sky.  It was mid-day.  A soft quack was responded to by another soft quack and the happy sounds of dabbling bills.  A sparrow sang from a bush long past its bloom season but now rotund with deep green leaves.
The staves boom and the smaller ship rocks under impact after impact.  Millicent growls at her boys, "Again, don't give 'em a second!"  And the staves roar off another volley of spit and mage-fire.  Flames of green and gold feast on the sails.
"Draco, what the hell are you doing?" he finally asked.
"How old were you when you first killed somebody, Draco?" Harry asked, oscillating his legs where they dangled over the edge of the examination table.  Forward, backward, forward, back.  The beat was steady and calming.
"Yeah, yeah, Malfoy.  Don't get your knickers in a twist," Potter said with a sigh.  "Sorry, Darren.  Nothing to worry about.  Just a … an old schoolmate," he finished, continuing to scratch the dogs and not meeting either of their eyes.
Huh?  His?  Draco almost laughed.  Harry wouldn't be up for
And then there was that surreal event at the Ministry Ball.  What did that mean?  He had mulled over the odd feeling of
"And it only lasts for a day?" Harry asked sadly.
"Mr. Malfoy."
With a bit of exploration Harry found this place in this dimension exactly like that of his own home, only nothing had been used.  The cabin was intact, there was food aplenty, the flowers in the garden were bright and cheerful.  There was no worn path to the stony outcrop that Harry liked to sit on, but he was doing his best at replacing it with his constant journeys to his sanctuary.
"Miss Anderson, that is a very good vase, lovely pattern of roses along the base.  However, as you can see from the instructions, you were supposed to Transfigure an urn.  Please, remember to stress the
He watched Severus leave and then turned his attention back to Harry, which was where it wanted to be anyway.  His breath caught at the untamable desire burning in those green eyes.  "My God," he moaned before he could stop those words.  Harry's own needy noise escaped in response.
Then he looked at Draco, who smirked.
They were free.
"You didn't know? Top of her class in wizarding school, studied Muggle math and science, co-destroyer of Voldemort, unparalleled researcher, spell developer, pinnacle of house elf rights…"
"What's wrong?" Harry asked.
"No," he mumbles.  Then the silence tears from him, "He hasn't done anything."
"Feels good," Sirius murmured into Remus' shoulder, leaning into his embrace. "Feels so good to touch you, Moony. God, I've wanted this for so long. Back in the shack and before…" Sirius' words died on his lips and he clung roughly onto Remus, holding on like something might tear him away from that embrace and bury him in an ocean of lost memories and despair.
"Are you cold?" Malfoy asked.
"Do you think…? What they did to us…"  Draco stopped and Harry waited.  It was the first time Draco had talked about back then… about their captivity, and Harry wanted to let him speak.  Finally, he continued in a very tiny voice.  "Do you think it twisted us?"
Ron smiled.  "Oh, nothing."  He waved his hand to brush the question aside.  "Thanks for coming over."  Ron's grin brightened, and Draco's gaze flittered from Ron to Harry.  Harry wordlessly held out the note.
The doll stopped nodding and looked away.  Harry hadn't figured out if it was charmed to move, or if it was Draco's subtle manipulations that gave it life.  Draco tilted his head, his ear aimed at the doll.  Harry's heart pounded.  That damned doll.  If only he could take the doll and hide it, toss it into an incinerator, then maybe, just maybe, Draco would pet him.
"Why can't he, Agent Savage?" Harry asked, none too pleased as he dusted off soot from his jeans and shirt.  "What is going on here?"
The Quaffle monster, as Harry unconsciously titled it, jumped into the air, flipped over and a bright blue light grew and blasted from the tiny wings.  "Draco!"  Harry yelled and tackled Draco from behind, taking the full blast of blue energy in his left shoulder.
The cottage had a thatched roof dusted with dry snow and a little brick chimney.  The robin's egg blue paint was peeling near a rectangular window and a small garden full of dead weeds and a bush full of twigs greeted them at the red door.  It was the most beautiful sight Harry had ever seen and the tears began flowing freely down his face, leaving tracks through the grime.
"Oh, please.  Call me Ginny."
When he woke he was clean and wrapped up in a very soft blanket.  It wasn't late, but the sky was lightening in the east.  Potter was snuggled up to his side, dropping kisses along the bare skin of his shoulders and neck.  The brush of his long fringe tickled against Draco's ear.
He pushed past the table, past fucking Malfoy and his taunts, pushing through the cafe door into the night, no colder than his own blood gone still in his veins.  That bastard.  What was his game?  Blackmail?
"Time for you to act, manwizard.  No more reacting."
"This way," Snape said, his clothing covered in blood, and they followed him onto a circular marking on the floor.  He reached out calmly, and Draco handed him his wand.  Then, with Snape's arms wrapped around them, they Disapparated.
"Harry, my Princess," Draco called him, and then leaned in to kiss away the pain.
"It is a personal matter between me and him, and I suggest you ask him if you wish an answer."  Draco smirked his most condescending smirk, one he'd learned long ago from Pansy—oh, she'd been the queen of smirks—and walked on.
"Severus," Draco said with a quiet voice, quiet yet lined with steel.  "I'm going to do it.  I'm going to try.  I don't want to die.  And… and I trust Harry.  There is no way he would abuse this.  He's too much the Gryffindor," he finished with a smirk.
"I did pretty well with it back in school, but really my main experience is in Defence, and I bet you know more than I do on that subject by now."  He smiled.  It was a warm smile, the type that Harry used to earn from Remus often, so many years ago.  Their time together watching over Hermione had drawn them close once more; at least they owed the curse that.  "Why?  And what dragged you out of St. Mungo's?"
He handed Draco a tumbler of scotch, their fingers brushing as he pulled his hand away.  Sparks.  Heat.  Power passed between them.  Images splashed though Harry's memory of Draco's chest, the feel of his lips on his own, the pleasure-pain whenever Draco bit him.  Their eyes met.  Draco smirked.
His entire length was wrapped, captured, and he pressed in until his groin hit buttocks and as he pumped his hips he bit flesh and tugged on hair and Draco felt so feral, like he was meant to be here, it was a biological imperative.  After each thrust a little more of his mind dissipated as more and more of his magic meshed with Lily's.  Below him he could hear a keening rise in the air, indistinguishable from his own cries, and without preamble his come shot from him as the muscles of that tight channel gripped and held him tight.  "Come Lily," he commanded.  "Come for me now," and a shudder ran through the body below him, wracked in the throws of orgasm.
"I know," Harry said into his hands.
"Well… Umm, Auror before beauty," Draco said quickly with an insensitive smile.
Neither man spoke, but as the seconds danced from one instant to the next they continued holding hands and smiling at each other as if their mere existence was something to cherish and delight in, and it was.
The bartender rolled his eyes at Draco and moved the bottles as he begin mixing a drink.
Suddenly, he became crisply aware that nothing ever stayed the same.
And memories of other men were erased.
Harry let himself be pulled down.
"Don't call me that!" Harry screamed; spit flying from his lips as he jumped to his feet, his wand as sturdy as ever in his fury.  "You bastard.  Think you can just come into my ordered life and fuck everything up, take over?  Well, I don't need you.  I don't need anyone.  Don't you think if I
Remus looked up at the painting, really studied it and saw within the artwork a grid and a series of ancient runes imbedded in the images.
Draco paused, then looked at the doll, then back up at Harry.  "Well… I don't think I should let you know yet, Potter.  Who knows, you could be in on the conspiracy."
"Mrs. Potter.  How can I help you?" he asked, his tone professional with just a touch of indifference.  This cat was Harry Potter, who had everything Draco wanted but didn't have.  This was Potter, fucking
"Water under the bridge, Harry.  You had a job to do.  Anyway, I
He gave the crowd, thinning now at this early hour, one last glance and his heart nearly stopped as the last person he ever expected to see at The Moon and Mars walked through the door.
But Draco ignored him, and began to devastate his orderly stacks in search for a clue.
Following a few moments to collect his thoughts, smell his breath, and cast a freshening charm, and finally rise to his unsteady feet, he wandered into the kitchen following enticing smells of eggs and bacon.
All the while, during the short trek from kitchen to living room Draco wondered how Harry could be pregnant.  They were not planning such a thing; sure they'd talked about it, but had decided it wasn't time.  To his knowledge, Harry wasn't taking any of the special potions, and none of the pregnancy charms required for a man to carry a child had been cast upon him.
The kiss, now that didn't come for some time.  First Draco recovered.  His broken bones and internal injuries completely healed within two weeks thanks to the marvels of wizarding medicine.  Next, he’d plotted endlessly, devising ways to get Harry to go on a date with him.  His plan would begin with assuring that Harry knew of his amazing assets: magical, financial, and physical.  He would lavish gifts on Harry, take him to the opera and expensive dinners—really drive home that Draco had everything to offer.  Then he would do something sweet.  Those emotional Gryffindors always liked a little romance; so Draco researched florists.  He was certain roses had to come into this story somehow.
"Lower the killick."  The capstan winds, the anchor drops, the grinding sound heralding their arrival to solid land as much as a little bell once caused a dog to drool in a Muggle training exercise.  The men ready themselves for a little R&R, eager to crack Jenny's tea cup as much as the dog was for a bit of kibble.
"I can’t do it."
The filmy veil shifted as if in a slight breeze, the hollow whispers sneaking out behind the soft fabric.
Now, he laid freezing under twin tombstones, one labeled "Naughty" in cursive script, the other "Nice" in block lettering.  Both grave inhabitants had died the same day.  He sappily hoped they'd died together.
A small trail of people followed behind him from a distance.
He flicked the wand hard, angrily shaking it until finally it glowed with a weak, pitiful light.
And now, he was quite aware he would always have Draco.
Like ghosts, they rise from the ocean brine, water sloughing off like it would from a selkie's skin.  Ropes shoot from their wands, digging into the hull as eager as the roots of spring flora.  As they prepare to climb, Draco lets himself consider the cost of this endeavor, the price of friendship, possibility… freedom.  He swallows, grabs the rope, and hauls himself up.
"Yeah, I'm here," Draco said, his voice warm. A cool cloth settled on his forehead. It felt like heaven. "Here, take your potion."
And the black world faded again.
Harry turned the faucet and filled his glass.  The water was clear, he could see through to the other side of the glass, a world in curved distortion.  He didn't hear Draco say anything so he turned to see the exchange.  Draco was looking at Harry.  Snape turned around in his chair and looked at Harry, too.
"Lots of 'em. But they all got it back. Though if rumor's right," Duncan looked nervous, "it ain't come back full."
"Not much," Draco said. Harry slid closer to him anyway, and Draco could feel the warmth radiate off the other wizard. Body heat and magic.
"Malfoy, Draco Malfoy."
With Harry's content expression, Draco struggled to steady those hidden desires he'd long kept in check.  Their empty glasses sat forgotten on the table.  Harry took up Draco's hand and led him from the manor to the outside grounds.  The air was crisp, Harry's fingers frigid.
With a sigh Draco drops his shoulders in a sign of surrender.  "Fine.  Why don't you just tell me why you kidnapped me so we don't have to waste time on witty repartee and guessing games.  I've a lecture I intend on making at Cambridge tomorrow morning."  It's a struggle to keep his expression passive.
"Thanks Plincher. So, team, we have another tip that there might be an exchange at Dzibal... ah, Dzibilchaltun. How is the even pronounced...” he quietly muttered, then continued. “It isn't far from Merida, nor is it the only exchange that has happened at some of the ruins. The Temple of the Dolls is the expected site for the exchange. This is a night mission…" Ron picked up a clipboard and flipped through the papers, colour coded with yellows, blues and reds signifying their contents. Landing on a yellow sheet Ron scanned over the names, already knowing exactly what he would find. "Abbott. Underhill. You guys are up for the next night surveillance."
"Kingsley, how are you?" Harry said with a forced smile.
spell and discovered it was 5:15 am. With the one hour time zone difference they had less than forty five minutes to get presentable, Apparate to San Jose and find Mr. Popicon's office. "He's not joking, Draco. You have twenty minutes."
The blond man sneered, and then winked.  Harry didn't know what to think.
"Stop, you'll push me out there," Draco said with a swat to Harry's head.  "They've got Severus.  Three of them surrounding him.  Another down."  He took a deep breath.  "Rowle is there."
"Well Harry, do tell.  Don't keep me in suspense."
Harry nodded.  "Thanks.  I'm hoping we can find him if we figure out how he was created, or if some unique aspect of his make-up can be traced."
The older man held up his hand as Harry prepared his barrage.  "Harry, I promise to keep you informed.  But even if you were still an Auror, I wouldn’t have you on this case, you're too close.  Go home.  She's being sent to St. Mungo’s; you can check on her there."
"It's as if you search for something your whole life and then you find it; you recognize that you're one of the lucky ones.  And then it's gone, taken away, and you're so lonely and lost, more broken than you were before it was taken away, because before you found it, you never knew you weren't whole."
"I wouldn't turn away potato soup.  And fresh bread," Snape added, looking past Harry, a thoughtful expression settled on his lips.  Harry shook his head.  He needed to stop staring at those lips.
"Good.  Come on."  Draco held out the half-used roll of Muggle masking tape and Tufts walked over and leaned to touch it with his neck.  Seconds passed and as the familiar tug took them away to Bulgaria, Draco realized Tufts hadn't once pined over parting from his wife.
"Shall we retire to the bedroom," Draco asked, his voice husky and sated, but promising more for the very near future.
Did Malfoy know how long he'd been here?  Harry knew he'd lost track of time.
"What?  What is it?" Draco demanded, standing there showing no indication that he was going to dress or move.  His pale, naked body caught Harry's attention, and he dropped his own armful of clothing in favor of an armful of Draco.
Remus examined his face as they drew closer; he noticed it wasn't so much a smile as a leer. He had a distinct feeling of uneasiness at the wicked amusement in the man's eyes. This man was a sadist; Remus knew this to the marrow in his bones.
Harry gasped.  Malfoy
—then, he wanted it done.  Plus, Fritz had been gone for ten days now, and he worried about the little construct.
Draco pulled out a chair, studying the small table where two plates were set out, a pitcher of pumpkin juice, coffee, toast, eggs, beans and rashers.  "You cook?"  Not only did it smell divine, it looked good.  The toast to a perfect golden brown, the rashers not too crispy.
Finally, Draco looks over at Laura.  Her hair has extra bounce today and she's grinning brilliantly.  Everyone here's a laughing fool.  Even himself, but he doesn't really care.
"Damn fish!" he yelled.  "Quit stealing my worm, already."  He tossed out his line again, this time from a large boulder and watched as fish came up to his hook and sucked off the worm.  "Fuckers," he cursed.
"Good. Then go." Shacklebolt nodded, then turned, and with a gesture gathered seven men with him. Together they trudged through the snow, disappearing around the edge of the building. The others gathered around Scrimgeour, ready for his next command.
From the corridor outside, Aurors were running towards the office at the Minister's cries.
Harry licked his lips again—they were swollen, he could tell—and opened his mouth, eyes never leaving the hard flesh in front of him.
"Potter!" Draco cried out as he leapt to Harry's side, wand brandished as he cataloged which spell he wanted to use against the vicious python.  Should he use a Slicing Spell, to cut those tight coils away from Harry's body, or just stun the beast and hope the effect would cause it to release the stupid oaf who'd gotten himself into such an imbecilic predicament?
Drip.  Drip.  Drip.  Precise.  Exact.
After an hour of more arguments, scathing insults and stiff moments of silence, the two settled down around Hermione's large desk, foraging through piles of scrolls, papers and parchments all covered with the enigmatic code.  Each hosting a simple algebraic equation in the bottom corner of the text.  After three more hours there emerged two piles: one pile, perhaps containing a dozen or so pieces, included the scrolls Draco could immediately translate, the other pile, enormous in proportion, remained unreadable.
Harry thought back to the poisoned Pepperup and the reason he'd come looking for Snape in the first place.  "And when can we do these things?  Now?  Just sing a song and take a dip and then we party and off we go?"
"I know… this is personal."
After he'd left, avoiding Snape's pointed scowl, he'd lain on a twin bed in a room that he was to share with Draco, one of only four rooms in the entire cottage.  Clothes had been waiting in a neat pile on a small chest of drawers, and he'd pulled them on as Draco looked away.  The sleeves of the shirt hung past his fingertips.  He tried to sleep, but he found he couldn't.  The bed was too soft, the room too dark, the air too warm.  He swore he could hear something, just… just beyond normal hearing.  Someone was out there.  Finally, after fitful tossing and turning, Draco'd gotten up and flicked on the light, then without a word, he crawled into bed next to Harry, back to back.
His anger flared and all he saw was red, red tinted sunlight, red tinted steel, a red tinted blond man looking down at him with worry. And then the red poofed away as the blond man kissed him frantically.
He continued his upward trek until he reached the landing and saw a long hallway with four rooms, two on either side.  All of the doors were closed, but something about the first one to his left sent shivers down his spine.  He didn't want to go there; he didn't want to look.
Remus woke up screaming, as he often did, from a dream he had no desire to remember, that his psyche had graciously tucked away to the wrinkled corners of his pickled brain.
The air was shiny.  The cabin had a half charred visage that shifted to pristine.  "Severus?" Harry whined nervously.  Fat honey bees buzzed past him, dancing around the purple lilac from flower to flower.  One minute they were solid, the next an illusion.
"Agh!"  Draco was yanked to the ground.  "Help, it's going to eat me!"  With surprising speed, Draco was dragged through shrubs and berry bushes, foot first, until he reached the bottom of a stately tree.
Shocked at the rumbling, yet quiet words, Remus still chuckled at the unassuming arrogance. He knew this kind of magic.
"Well, obviously you got bitten," Harry stated, and Draco was annoyed to hear that the man didn't sound very sympathetic.
A feeling not unlike blind terror wormed its way into Harry's veins, chilling them to ice, and he pulled the chains tight, straining and stiffening in anticipation of the first cut.  He could hear Hermione's shallow breathing, betraying her own apprehension, and he momentarily felt wrong forcing her to cut into his scar.  She shouldn’t have to face such horrors.
"Is there anything I can do?" he offered.
Remus knew those voices. Recognized them well. So well, he could not find the presence of mind to truly put the two together into what he would consider friendly banter.
It takes some time before Draco realizes he hasn't interpreted any of the rise and fall of lips as words and has only noticed the pinkness, the chapped scabbing, the joining and parting of motion.
"You're mine," Draco panted, and he pressed into the body below him, his voice cracking as he tried to memorize and analyze everything he felt, the touches, the heat, the utter welcome and acceptance by this total stranger.  "Lily," he groaned, pulling tight on those thick tresses, and he trust again, Lily's body below him pressing back and suddenly there was nothing but heat and welcome and a pounding force that drove him to thrust and thrust again, mindless and terrible and so utterly overwhelming.
Back in Ron's rented flat the three men gathered. It consisted of a single room stuffed with a queen sized lumpy mattress, two chairs, a tiny kitchen with one counter, sink, and constantly clicking refrigerator, and a desk that Ron had purchased at a bazaar three blocks away and lugged down the street on his own. The left, rear leg was a few inches shorter due to the sandpaper like affect cobbled streets had on wood. To Harry, it almost seemed homey, if it weren't for the constant scuttle of cockroaches running across the floorboards and rats running through the plaster walls.
"Yes, Harry… you want…?"  Draco panted as the air surrounding him suddenly lacked oxygen under that hungry gaze.  Harry leaned forward and kissed him again, this time everything but gentle, hands rubbing his chest, fingers exploring and finally tweaking a nipple, just once, and Draco pulled back, gasping.
"Well, let's get down to business, shall we?" the scholar said. Remus and Ron seemed to be hanging back, letting Harry do all the talking. Draco decided to follow suit and remained quiet.
Harry, scowling, followed.
"On these rocks?"  Harry said with a strained chuckle.  At the frightened look in Draco's eyes Harry opted for getting this over with as quickly as possible, and he lay down.
"This little plant is trying so hard to grow, so hard to live."  Harry was squatting next to the pot, dressed in shorts, a ratty T-shirt and fluffy socks as was usual for his lazy lifestyle, and he reached out to touch the green sprig emerging from the loose soil.
A slow drumbeat marched unsteadily.
Well, he would deal with that portkey when he came to it.
Since he and Draco had become so close, he kept a couple catchoo in the corral at the clinic.  The paperwork explained them away as research animals, but he secretly bled them for Draco's needs.  Their blood went a long way to feed a vampire, unlike that of most other creatures.  A couple sips of the bovine-like creature's blood and Draco would no longer hunger, while it might take a few pints of cow or even human blood to completely sate him.  Harry had asked him how it tasted, compared to other blood, and Draco just shrugged saying that some blood just tasted better and others just sustained and wouldn't elaborate on it any further.  Damned reticent bastard.
Draco stopped his petting and sat up.  "Nothing," he said with a cheeky grin, and the sight of that grin lifted Harry's burdens. "Let's eat."
"But, you are not going to die," Draco helpfully pointed out.
Draco warmed inside, and smiled.  "Good, because I enjoy touching my things, and I wouldn't want to be deprived of the simple pleasures in life."
Then he looked up and spotted Harry.  They looked at each other and in the space of three breaths, Snape donned a frown like a full set of clothes, slowly, methodically, like he'd been shocked to find he wasn't sneering and forgot how to put it back on.
"Well, that's sure fine and educational and all, but this doesn't help us much," muttered Ron.
Harry stared at Ron's flushed face through the hostel's Floo.  He knew he probably shouldn't have slipped off to America without telling Ron and Hermione his plans, but better to have them argue with him here where they couldn't physically tie him down than arguing with him at home and potentially convincing him to stay.
Harry shrugged and sat up.
"So, you have the desire to grovel?" Draco asked, unbelieving.
Draco, feeling very good indeed, decided on bravery and ordered something from the mystery curry list. He had no earthly clue what it was he ordered, but it promised to be spicy. Harry ordered a small portion of some sort of rice dish with eggs and beans.
He examined his eyes in the mirror.  His eyes.  He had left his eyes the same: bright green and full of something pure from his mother—a sense of what was right and a willingness to follow through with hard choices.  His hair was still black, a symbol of his brave father.  But that scar, only a shadow now that Voldemort was gone, he buried beneath a layer of foundation, burying that reminder of everything that had broken within him the day he saved the world.
As his animal fear subsided and his eternally fidgety blood hunger settled down like a favorite pet, Harry realized that he
"Ah, no."  He looked at Greg, amused.
He stepped back into the clearing and glanced at Harry, wondering where Snape had gone.  Then he noticed the large snake wrapped around Harry's body, twined between Harry's legs and a sudden spark of emotion flared in Draco's chest, causing his hands and legs to go numb.  Jealousy and desire and hope.  These emotions haunted him.  He turned away, lay down on his cloak and closed his eyes.
, he set the glass down on the table that in a previous life could have been the wood from an old barn door or wagon wheel, it was so scared and knotted.
"Damn," he mumbled into the stream of water.  Wasn't she gone yet?
The entire room sat as quiet as winter's first morning while new ideas popped into overtaxed brains.
It wasn't that Snape was his friend… but he wasn't his enemy either.  He was an incredible wizard and a brilliant man.  Harry just had no soft spot for him; he long ago realized he didn't want a soft spot for the man who would be his spy.  Harry knew that Snape had given up everything,
Draco nodded and leaned against the huge rock that stood about chest high.  He crouched low and braced his shoulder against the unyielding stone.  With a rather unattractive grunt he pushed.  It teetered and Harry yelled out in pain, but Draco didn't stop.  He took a step forward, continuing to push with such staunch intensity he feared for the integrity of his shoulder.  He blocked out Harry's muffled cries and gave one final heave until finally the boulder rolled off of Harry's crushed leg.
"And you, Harry?  Are you…?"
Sadness and longing and understanding.  Though, how Potter could understand, he wasn't quite sure.  But something else… something that eased all of the other tight emotions that were constricting his heart.  Damn if he couldn't name it.
"But, if you are done for today, why don't you come in and I'll show you my loom."
"What the hell? What is this place, a sick fun house?" Draco yelled at them. Even with the door shut the bird song was still as loud as before.
Harry's eyes zipped around the room: one man by the bar, one woman on the chaise, two others at a table to his left, goblets half full.  He could smell their age, their amusement.  Rosebuds and cinnamon.
"But he's needed."  Harry bounded to his feet and began pacing before Draco's desk, speaking as much with his hands as he did with his mouth.  "Michael Rosenbloom asked that I seek him out because they'd discovered a sickness that appears to be spread by the use of Pepperup potion.  They can't figure out if it is a bad supply of Pepperup, or if it's simply acting as a catalyst.  They need Snape and his potions expertise.  They've already got their best Potions Masters in the Ministry on it, but none of them have figured anything out."
Draco continued peering at him; his little doll began nodding too.
"Ah, look at the two lovebirds."
Harry shuddered, having insects inhabiting his body didn't sound like a good way to go about his day, either.
But now other things were far more central to his mental processes; he pushed off Lily's shirt, letting it fall to the ground and wrapped his arms around him, unsnapped the bra and let that too drop to the floor.  He leaned back to look at the shorter, compact body, still holding on with one arm.
"What?" Remus seemed startled. "Yes. They are." He was very matter of fact about it.
Kingsley sat down hard in his chair, freeing a weary sigh.  "What do you want to know?"
, Harry."
Potter leapt to his feet in response to Draco's handful of words.  His theory.
Draco's eyes opened not too long later, and he was still in Harry's arms.  He purred in contentment even though he knew they had to get out of the cave.  Without the ever-nagging desire for blood, he could think over how he was going to get Harry and Charlie out into the fresh air of the open countryside once more.
Harry reached out and picked up the hunk of meat and bit in.
Gingerly, because his arse hurt like hell, Harry crawled out from under the sheets, most likely a lost cause that even the house elves couldn't launder.  The air pulled goosebumps up along his skin.  Draco, sprawled in the centre of the bed, looked like a Monet.  A masterpiece.
Even with all of the rushing around and planning and dealing with a room full of strangers, Harry still found he couldn’t take his eyes from Draco for too long. He seemed to seek out the blond wizard like a child seeking out rich chocolate or a prince seeking his… umm, well not necessarily princess. But he felt drawn to Draco, and he cherished this new and encompassing feeling.
Latin flowed from Apis' lips with all the power of lava and fire. The witch's voice burned, echoed through the building, and Harry suppressed an instinct to smash his hands over his ears to drown out the deep reverberations. A few others didn't. Remus flinched at the edge of Harry's peripheral vision. Sirius stood stoic, unmoving, eyes only on the artefact awaiting its destruction.
They had been trapped in Kogelmann's stronghold for almost twenty-four hours. The team returned late that evening, shocked and tired from a seemingly endless night. Their first priority was to lock Kogelmann away in a small holding cell—keyed only to Ron's wand—and then all of them visited a local medical facility to mend their minor injuries and get a thorough curse detection diagnostics performed. They discovered that Underhill and Abbot had contacted the British Headquarters after a drove of Aurors descended upon them, asking questions and demanding answers.
"Wait!" Draco called out.  "I've a question for you."
The chicken came out juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside.  Severus certainly was a good cook.  Harry spooned some steamed carrots onto his plate and poured a glass of berry juice.  "Looks amazing, Severus," Harry told him, and Severus smiled.
"Just bacon?" he asked.
In the center of the room was the spinning wheel.  It was ancient with the lacquer rubbed off after generations of hands had worked wool through it.  There was a cushion on the wooden seat and a basket with red dyed wool by the side.
"Is that what trapped you as a snake?" Harry asked, striving to keep his wandering gaze off Draco by watching the shifting of light on the snake's scales, yet trying to not shiver every time that stupid snake hissed.  He felt ready to burst apart.
"But my Fritz is behind that door," Harry said, glaring down at the goblin, wand gripped in his fist.  "He's been stolen from me, and I know he's behind that door."  Harry turned back towards the iron-banded door.  "Fritz!  Fritz, I'm coming to get you."
"Yes," Draco said, his own voice sounding flat and two-dimensional. He crouched down before the young Harry Potter, rough in his abuse, sorrowful in his loneliness. "I'm here to help you, but you have to work with me. Understand?"
"Can you come with us, Mr. Lupin?" another asked.  This Auror had a pointed nose and a thick head of light brown hair.  But perhaps the most noticeable feature was a cruel twist to his lips.  "Your presence is requested by the Werewolf Registry."
“How do you know that's Severus?”  Draco sounded perturbed... but under his haughty, snapped words, Harry could tell his friend was also excited.  Relieved.
The cat blinked and sat down on his haunches.  His tail swished in annoyance.
"Oh, now you see, it just came into my possession. I have quite a few friends who are looking for such items for me.  It is bad for my reputation you must understand, but luckily one of my more discreet fellows found me that.  I just received it yesterday.  It's yours.  Please, just take it away."  The man fidgeted with anxiety.
"Harry, how're you doing?" Thomas asked as he crouched to Tufts' level.  Tufts butted his head into Thomas' knee, playfully, nothing like the way he butted Draco.  Draco frowned.  Why the hell was he even comparing?
"Well," Harry piped up, "We do have an attending… um, spirit I guess you can call him. He only shows sometimes. He's the one that has the staff and feather under control right now."
Rowle swung his leg and kicked Malfoy hard in the kidney.  Malfoy cried out and looked up to Rowle, fear and betrayal blatant and screaming from his eyes, the twist of his mouth.
But as he explored further back, he did notice a few titles of interest,
"Oh, Pansy…" Lovegood looked meaningfully at Pansy.
Harry tapped his throat three times and whispered, the words transported directly into Ron's ear back at their makeshift headquarters. "Exchange made, follow who?"
"No, didn't work out.  Done with the blind dates, okay."  He rose, as if that was the last of that discussion, and walked up to the bar.
Ron and Luna would be sickening if they weren't so discreet.  Whenever Harry caught them, they were smoochy and handsy and just plain icky.  But he didn't catch them often, so he thanked the ancients buried under the old hills of Britain for small favors.  He wasn't sure how Hermione felt about it all, but she hadn't attacked Ron with any more birds so Harry guessed she didn't much care.  He'd always wondered what she'd seen in Ron, talk about totally incompatible brains, but one could never explain love, or lust, or any of those hormonal responses.
Slightly nervous he leaned over Severus' erection, heavy and proud and so full.  Severus tilted his hips, just slightly, but Harry got the hint.  With tenderness he rubbed first one cheek, then the other against the soft, silky skin.
Harry's eyes had that eerie glow to them, and his hair began to pick up in the maelstrom of magic that had begun twisting about. Kogelmann's fear seeped out of every one of the man's pores and some inner feral desire perked up within Remus, showing definite interest. It was Moony. This whole time, Moony had been awakening within him. Shite. Remus had always been able to clamp down on the wolf, forcing him into the dark cage until the full moon when the iron bars fell with a clatter; but this time his cursed alter identity wasn't slinking away.
"So… umm, Draco…" Harry's words tumbled out, and with what looked like a conscious effort, he paused, lifted his glass of some fruit puree to his lips, and took a sip. "What're you doing here? Not that I'm not glad you're here, it's just that I… well, we weren't expecting you."
terribly pettable, the whole allergy side-effect just sucked.
Aghast, Draco gaped at Harry, but there wasn't any shock or admonition in his face; he just had that stupidly open look that caused Draco, at times, to want to confide in him, treat him like a friend.  He cocked his head to one side, totally unfazed by Draco's attack.  "Really?" he asked, so casually, so gently.  "Tell me about it."
Sirius stood next to the bed, looking down on him.
Tufts lifted his head with effort, then sadly looked over at Draco.  His eyes seemed swollen with longing for his daughter.  Draco understood.
"It was Scrimgeour, then?" she asked.
Left alone in the vacant air following Draco’s Disapparition, Harry slowly turned the unknown metallic device over and over in his hands, wondering what it could possibly do.
"Wow," Wolfwood said again, scratching at his bald head.
Draco lowered his wand and looked at the man's eyes.  They were sharp again, serious but curious.  Was this a new Potter, or the less crazy Potter from the other night?
"Really?"  Harry's tail danced in a great acrobatic display behind him.  "Do you, maybe, need some help?"
The flutter won over.
Remus jumped to his feet, posed ready for attack. The ceiling above was glass—that grabbed his attention first—showing the sparkle of the night sky.
"No, Harry.  This isn't something the Fae enchanted us with.  Whatever feelings we have are ours."  Harry turned around towards Draco, then glanced over at Snape.
He studied his servants, none met his eyes. "Shacklebolt." The tall man turned towards him, his furtive eyes meeting Scrimgeour's, and flinched. "Come here," Scrimgeour ordered around his thick tongue. He thought he'd bit into it, as swollen as it was, but he felt no pain and tasted no blood. Numb. All he felt was numb without his orb.
Harry stood and gestured for Draco to follow him. They left the small flat and took the stairs up, a direction Draco hadn't explored before, and eventually came out on the top of the building's tiled roof. The tiles were slippery, but they slowly made their way onto the surface and sat. Harry leaned back, cradling his head with his arms and just stared into space. Draco settled next to him.
When I started this story, Deathly Hallows had not been completed, so I enjoyed forseeing an end to Voldemort and a view into the future of these characters I'd stood by for so long.  This was a bit of a dream for me to write.  It took me a long time to finish and I was pretty happy with it at the time.  Now, as I re-edited it for posting here, I find problems and weaknesses, but I'm still proud of this novel and I hope you can find enjoyment in it as well.
Draco opens his mouth to say something else, but Millicent calls out his name.  "Draco."  Everyone looks at her, her voice booming over the silent crowd.
He wanted to try again, to make sure it wasn't just a fluke.  He grinned at the thought as he flipped over a sausage in the frying pan.
"We should find another way," Remus said.  Why was Remus trying to talk Snape out of using a sure-fire way to kill Voldemort?
"You're asking me? You're the most powerful wizard alive!" Draco laughed with an edge of bitterness.
And Harry complied.
Snape looked honestly shocked, and then the left side of his mouth quirked up.  "Potter, I'm surprised your mind went there."
Argyle Popicon was a heavy set man with ill fitting clothes, but his breeding was good and Draco gave him credit for that, even if he was a careless slob. Plus the man was reportedly brilliant when it came to early Latin American magical practices. They couldn't afford to alienate him.
was unreasonable.
"Okay," Harry said.
And he was walking towards Harry.
"Hello, Remus," Kingsley said with a broad grin. He held a large sack in his arms. Remus noticed the tired look that had swarmed about him like a hundred angry bees was slowly easing away.
"Well, I shall leave you two to… feel out how this bond works between you.  Enjoy." Severus smirked, and with his usually dignity, he rose and left the two young men alone in the room.  Draco knew he was no longer Severus' toy and acknowledged he never was.  But Harry on the other hand…
Draco shifted in his seat and avoided Harry's searching gaze.  He'd seen those portraits, and he felt oddly silly about them.
"Please, follow me, sir," she said and led Harry through the corridors, down a set of service stairs, and finally into a small, apparently unused room. During their trek Harry wondered if fruits, chocolates or an assortment of wine would be a better gift choice.
"Let's check out the perimeter and return here. Don't go in," Harry said, finally dropping his hand. Draco quickly wiped it. "You go right and I'll go left. Okay?"
"I'll call you; I have to do some research first."
He stopped in the middle of a heavily trafficked pedestrian area and sighed, dropping his leather bag to the dirt layered cobbles. There were Muggles everywhere, bumping into him and staring at his paleness. Not only were they Muggles, but they were Mexican Muggles, not even proper British folk who spoke the Queen's English. Draco was totally out of his element.
Remus casually pulled the chair from the table and sat in it. It never looked good to act too eager. "Been removed from the world so long, just curious."
“Pass the mashed yams.”
"What's it doing in the code from the war and why's he have it?"
"Here Pansy, take mine."  He surrenders all of his utensils and picks up his chicken wing with his hands.  All the purebloods look at him with a kind of mesmerized curiosity.  When he finishes his chicken, fingers licked clean, he examines his mashed potatoes.
Draco shrugged.  "Well, so far I've got loopy Potter, serious Potter and will-fuck-a-goat Potter.  I'd say yes."
"These must be the three young men from England," she said warmly, holding out her hands to shake each of theirs. Draco noted her grip was firm and her hands warm. She smelled of fresh violets.
Adam's apple.  "You're a man?" he asked, sounding more than a little disappointed.
"Potter?" he blurted.
The line wrapped around the great hall in a giant spiral as everyone waited for their dose of remedy to the maelstrom's mutations.  Eager conversations filled the hall as those still cursed longingly watched those before them suddenly be cured.  Hermione and Professor Snape had turned their focus on the next step, that to fix the weather and grounds of the blast zone of their massive mistake, and were cloistered away in the Potions classroom working closely together.
As they passed the entrance to the Dungeons, they saw Hermione descending the stairs two at a time.
What?  He must have misheard.  "Severus?"
"Draco, about that thing, ya know… what you came to visit me for? I got that info." He stood on his guard, visibly shaken, eyes dancing between the other men and Draco.
mellowed.
He and Potter had talked about many things over the past few days.  London, Draco's life, a bit about knitting.  Nothing about a drowning or some bloke named Richy.  Nothing about any of Potter's heartache.
"Yeah," Harry said.  His body had long ago forgone shivering.  Maybe it was trying to commit suicide.  Maybe today was the day he wouldn't eat the crap they laid out for him.  Maybe today he would just die.
"Why are you looking at Potter, Draco?" Snape asked.  Though his voice had that harsh rasp—from severed vocal cords from Nagini's bite Harry'd assumed—it still held power and Harry knew he would be hard pressed to refuse Snape an answer.
"No," Harry mumbled, low to not attract untoward attention.  "There're people out there."  Before, when his mind focused on his friends he couldn't wait to get to them, now he dreaded his reunion.
He was truly stumped.  Until the next letter came, Draco wasn't sure what to do.  He didn't think the replica idea was going to work, but he knew, as much as Harry did, that they couldn't hand over the Sword for a pet, even if it was Harry Potter's one-of-a-kind pet.
"Ron," Harry tried again. "What do you want to do now? Do you want to set a trap for every member of the team? Maybe we should take a little break. You can come down to Costa Rica with me for a day while we think about what to do."
And as three wizards began weaving their way towards him through the milling crowd, Draco made up his mind and with a twist and a pop, departed the crowded street.
"Gnome?" Draco finished.
Snape stalked up and plucked it from his fingers.  "None of that."  He stowed the wand away in a box that he placed on the mantle.  "We might have need of it, eventually."
"Of course," Draco said with pride.  He set the tiny, red car down on the maps.
"So, we must sing for the Queen," Snape broke through his shadowed thoughts.  "Any ideas?  Though I am sure you will be shocked at this, I'm not much of a vocal talent."  He was perched on a log they'd levitated into the clearing since they couldn't seem to Transfigure anything here.  Snape suggested the magic of the place was already too chaotic, and such spells couldn't find the true form of an item to transform it.  So, they sat on rocks and slept on the ground.  Harry didn't mind too much.
"Potter, wake up."
Men mount their brooms and others swing across on ropes like primates of the jungle.  The boarding is swift, the casualties limited as the enemy crew quickly throws down their wands and raises their hands in defeat.
And so the two men prepared and planned for their coming arrival, and with their true and deep affection for each other, they rode through each and every collision.
Draco walked around the table, stopping before Harry.  This near, he wanted to close the distance, have Harry's arms wrap around him, lean down to kiss the man's worry away.  "Harry, I'll find Fritz.  See about a replica for now, but I'm not resting till I've exhausted every option."
And then the volley of fire and light begins.
"It is… going to take some time," Severus admitted.  He picked up his spoon to dip into the potato soup.  A thin layer of melted cheese covered the top.
Luna only tilts her head, wondering if a snargelpuss has invaded below deck, disrupting her crewmates' minds.
"Draco."
.  "I miss her.  Merlin, I miss her."
"Which one wants to come play today?"
Remembering Ginny training for war, taking out Death Eaters in the final battle, he acknowledged that she certainly could.
"I will show you how to form each brick, but you have most of the stone already. After I show you, I bet you can make them better and faster than I could."
Alissa's voice was high and chirpy. "Excuse me, but is there a fourth with you?" She craned her neck, looking around. Again, the men exchanged glances.
The cage containing the artefact now glowed a deep purple, exuding power and hate and a sentience that Harry found immensely creepy. It wasn't right or natural. Harry raised his arms again, pushing out his power to aid the spell and give strength to the men and women surrounding him.
Harry looked over at Hermione, who had gone still, clutching her hands together in her lap.  He could barely hear the muffled "Hrumm Mrurm" from her hand as it tried to talk.  People tended to ignore the hand if Hermione pretended it didn't exist.  Common courtesy.
"Talk?  About what?  We've nothing to talk about.  Leave."  Cold, hard words.
"We don't know yet." Harry answered him before Draco had a chance. "Only what you already know; people are losing their magic, then getting it back. Someone's apparently cursing people with what looks to be a small divination tool and that's what's killing their magic. More people are being cursed, not just people at your gatherings, and we're trying everything to stop it and hopefully cure everyone."
Dryly, Draco explains, "You do realize that everyone here calls her Loony."  Pansy's eyes flash at him, and Luna laughs, a high giggle of someone much younger.
"Sure, if you think being cursed mad is an attractive quality," Harry said and turned to Draco, something like amusement in his features.
Then Severus pressed the length of his hand along Harry's cock.  "
Harry sighed, looking over at Remus as he went to the fireplace.
"Ow!  What was that for?"  He touched the sharp sting on his cheek.
The team moved into the building following Harry's painstaking disassembly. Harry's senses strained to feel for any magic, to hear any noise. His enhancement cantrips hummed about him, a sense of magic washing over the other wizards and witches nearby.
They are propelled under top sails only, running on westwards with another ship close on stern.  The sky looks angry.
The green suit practically glowed it was so bright and a lolly dangled from his gormless grin.  Finally, Draco could see that Harry was touching a pot of moss, petting it like it was a favourite cat.  He looked from the plant up to Draco, and he seemed so pleased, so content, that Draco's initial reaction to the
"I'm not familiar with it," he said shaking his head.
"Hey Harry," Agent Abbot interrupted, "how's Hermione doing?"
To the east roars the
"So, Draco," Snape began.  "How are you feeling?"
Draco brought up one hand to cover his face, then wrapped his leg around Harry's and tugged, causing Harry to fall hard to the floor, dragging Draco down with him as Harry continued to clutch at his collar.
.  The vine continued to coil around Draco, securing him to the pale trunk.
From forest he entered into forest, but this was a step sideways from the large leafy maples and the thick underbrush.  It all looked strangely at odds, the light too brilliant, lending everything a brand new color tinged with a fluorescent hue.  Shadows dancing across the forest floor seemed alive, not quite moving to the same cadence that the wind stirred the leaves.  There was a crackle in the air that felt like the cusp from spring to summer—even the taste of it held promise.
However, Remus knew the truth. He could smell each pheromone spike as skin met skin, as touch was returned by touch, as if each man, as unalike as the opposite ends of a magnet, were drawn together by that same polarity.
Harry had asked him to find Millicent Bulstrode, and while most of his connections were a bit rusty, he still had some friends on the nark side of Britain who he hoped would help him.
Five feathers were laid across a full length table. One of them was dull and rather scruffy looking, about three inches in length and looked like it might have been plucked from a gull. The second was elegant and bright, a rainbow of colours and reached over a foot and a half in length with a bit of yarn attached to the end. The third, an obvious primary wing feather that had once adorned some bird of prey, was painted with Greek sigils. The fourth was actually two good sized feathers bound together by a leather thong, the edges tinged by some bright red dye, though the rest of the feathers were black. The last feather was a tiny thing, metallic in colour, changing from green to blue to bronze depending on the angle of the light. It let off a slightly sweet scent.
And he was beautiful.
Harry scanned the page; saw the list of Remus' interviews, his signatures followed by another Auror's signature, sometimes Kinglsey, sometimes Ron, often another uninvolved party.  This was all familiar to Harry.
And he did.
"I figured," he replied, dully.
Draco had already set up a surveillance system to cover every entrance of Harry's home and the shop.
At the crown of dawn, Harry thought about what he'd done.  A relentless ache took up residence in his arse and bite marks dotted his chest like tropical islands in a narrow sea.  His ear throbbed.
"Rock, Harry.  Lift that rock."
On it were croissants, jam, fruits and a glass pitcher of pumpkin juice.
The Minister laughed. "Going into politics?"
"What is it you want to talk to him for?" the man called out after Draco as he headed for the house.
"Fine. Call back Remus and let's get to planning. I want to get this over with."
Draco crawls back onto his bunk.  Thirteen days.  He's only been here thirteen days.
"What?" came the curious voice from behind him.
Harry blinked.
"Ron will come out of it," said Harry. "We'll probably storm the place soon, take down the Bad Guy, ship Underhill off to trial, find this crystal ball, cure Hermione and the rest of England, and live happily ever after. Ta da!"
"Damn it, Draco," she said softly, dropping her hands to her side.  She lowered her gaze, refusing to look in his eyes, and gently shook her head.  "Was she worth all of this?"
"It can flush out mind control on people.  It is the stamen of the plant, so you have to care for it until it blooms," Neville explained.  "Technically it is an
He still felt the Weasleys were awfully plebian, but they were good people to Harry, and for that Draco could accept their tiny hovel, shabby clothing, and general countryside attitude.
was clutched in the other.  He found it very important to keep apprised of the Muggle goings-on.
A soft knock ticked on their bedroom door.  Then Snape's rough voice called through: "Breakfast.  The day wastes."
Luna leads him to a wizard-made cave and he walks in to find a full-sized bathroom, complete with claw tub and toilet.  He shuts the door and a light blinks on overhead, round and harshly brilliant.  He fumbles his trousers buttons, urged on by his screaming bladder, and groans softly as he pisses, the warm liquid draining out of his body.
"Here, Severus.  Let me try."
Mrs. Weasley had grown old.  The loss of her son and the terror that she harbored for the safety of her remaining family had streaked her hair with grey, as steely as the substance running through her veins.
And now, a dominate portion of himself wanted to make Harry see them through.
Lisbon was a city mixed with old and new.  It was large enough to contain its own wizarding section, but Draco and Tufts had agreed to avoid other wizards.  Here, Tufts garnered even more curiosity, though less fear.  Everyone assumed he was a trained pet.  One woman even yelled at Draco about having his 'dog' off his leash.
Now he was no longer an Auror.  The capture of dark wizards was no longer his duty, though his thoughts often returned to his piles of evidence on the recent Death Eater activity, so easily taking second place to Hermione's condition.  Without his job and only a handful of friends who really mattered, Harry almost drowned in his cosmic loneliness.  His friends were a valuable commodity; he couldn't lose any of them.
"I will then."
Harry sneezed and Draco glared at him.  Harry finally realized something.  "You're not allergic to me."  Draco had not once sneezed at him.
Harry mumbled something that Draco couldn't quite make out.  Something like "mrph plgnt."
"You have too much to do, Snape.  You don't have time for naps," Harry said.
He turned the knobs and let the cold water flow through the dorm pipes before he tested it for warmth.  He could use his wand, but he avoided using magic while at Oxford.  He dreaded a Muggle accidentally spying him doing something unexplainable. The current Ministry wasn't concerned with keeping the methods of memory alteration gentle when it came to Muggles.
He tried to look stern, but then gave up under the five sets of eager eyes. "Okay, fine. Let's go." Harry jumped slightly and hovered a few seconds before he touched down again.
and ran an analytic collection of spells over it, casting detecting magic, revealing spells, magic suppression and an array of other spells to no definitive answer.  The book simply was just a book, at least to anything Harry could sense, and if Harry couldn’t sense anything odd about it, he trusted that the text was under no magical sway.
"Severus, what are we going to do?" he whined.  He was detached from a part of himself, like the strongest part of his soul had been lobotomized.   He could still feel his magic inside of him, but it was trapped and all it could do was swirl and pace like a caged tiger.
He waited, tensed for the moment when they would begin to crawl all over him, biting and rending his flesh, but that moment never came.  Instead the rats did something completely astounding, something so odd that Harry wasn't exactly sure what he was seeing.
From the hallway he chased the butterfly up a series of stairs to the Ravenclaw Tower, through a hidden passage lined with mounted bass singing to him about a little song they wrote, over a low brick wall that crossed the entire hall, down another set of stairs into the dungeons until the poor creature expired right outside of the Potions classroom.
"Well, can you fix it?" she asked.
Draco ended the kiss, Harry's hands wrapped tightly within his.  With some effort, he refrained from whining at the loss of contact.
"You can cure this?  Me?  Save me from this enemy that I've become."  He covered his face with his hands and crouched over, huddling in the smallest form he could.  His hands muffled his words, but Draco could hear them as well as their anguish.  "Stop me from hurting people?  I just wanted to stop Voldemort, be a kind of hero, then quietly find some nice bloke and settle down with a white picket fence and maybe a crup and be happy."
"What would he be winning?"  Severus asked as he walked across the room to stand beside Draco.  The night was clear and the stars sparkled without the dilution of light from a city.
"Well, I've got a little English in me anyway." And he winked.
"I was thinking spell development, but on a personal level. Kind of like the twins' joke shop, but with more household spells. Maybe even have a section of things that every pureblood knows about but that Muggleborns would be clueless about." He shrugged as Draco laughed at him.
The ship slices through the water like a great whale, the sails unlatched and undulating like flippers and tail.  The rolling motion is sickening, and Draco closes his eyes to trick his mind into thinking he's strapped to the back of a hippogriff.  Something normal and above the titanic pressure of the sea.
He needed more.  A buzzing electrified his body.  He needed more, more of something… "Hmm, Draco… Please, more… please."
Harry pressed close and ghosted his lips over the man's, stoic yet yielding.  His tongue dragged across the surface of his mouth and dipped inside to meet another and they danced, gently, almost shyly.
"Do lots of research on Dark Artefacts, huh?" Ron asked sullenly.
"Should I leave or something?" Draco asked, his voice strained.
Harry was far more priceless than the artefact.
"Yes?" Draco asked, slightly annoyed.  Usually he valued having Severus' portrait in residence at his home, but sometimes, when the man silently waited for Draco to divulge his insecurities and worries, he was nothing but a nuisance.
"Okay guys, I gotta talk to Ron. But maybe later we can all go grab a
"So, these three are '7, 3'. I think."
"That's not how it works, Malfoy," Harry growled.
"Oh, do you still want to go?" she says, genuinely shocked.  "We're not keeping you."
Remus drew in a breath to call for Harry but was sidetracked once again.
"Just keep your hands to yourself, and we have a deal."
Draco pulled out his badge and warrant.  "Mr. Harry Potter.  By Subsection BB of Section 1 of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Regulation Part 71, I hereby charge you with the production of illegally enchanted wool jumpers that have been released for utilization by Muggles."  The man's once delighted expression hardened and twisted and Draco no longer felt anything like guilt and pity.
"I see."
Remus only shook his head.  "I don't know, Harry.  It's an old ritual and hasn't been performed in the last 300 years.  There isn't much written down about it.  Why do you ask?" he asked curiously.
"I've never seen any spell so strong or so clever. Nothing is your equal. I would find peace and enjoyment in studying how you were created for the rest of my days." And in a way, Remus meant it.
Was Weasley suggesting…?  Then out of the corner of his eye Draco saw something.  It was tiny and bounced upon the air like it was held aloft by spider silk.  It continued down the hallway, passing the suits of armor on its bobbing path.  A black butterfly.  A Hell Butterfly coming to tell Draco something from another world.
Harry chanced a glance up at Severus.  Severus was quiet; he only stared at Draco, his eyes wide, his lips pressed firmly in a grimace.
Another shiver hit his limbs.
With enthusiasm she fluttered her hands about, ushering them in. She wore a floor length, flowery dress that held no curves and made her look like a head and arms attached to a bell.
"Spill it," Ron said, hands on hips in what he hoped didn't look too much like Hermione.  But the pose had always worked on him, so he trusted it would work its charm on his best friend.
Harry reached out and took the small figurine. He held it with quiet reverence and nodded at Draco's words. "I'll make sure to call you if I need you. Does this mean you're leaving?"
Potter leaned against "Nice", knees hugged to his chest as his eyes watered.  He stared away in dim horror.
Hermione felt his chances were good.
"You did tell him!?"
"Mr. Potter, as someone even with your visual frailties can see, Remus and I are rather busy.  Kindly remove yourselves from this room and we can discuss your…
"Well," Harry began and then stopped.  He looked over at Draco, balancing between beseeching and overwhelmed.
She grew quiet; her only sound a gasping breath as the Cruciatus Curse abruptly ended.
“I've something I want to show you.  Something I want to share.”
Draco can't hear everything, but when Terry finally generates enough courage from his dance of reach out and pull back, he touches Harry, gently.  Far more gently than a subordinate to his Captain, a friend to a friend.
"Yeah, yeah.  Let me grab my robes.  Just… I'm not seeing anyone, and I don't want to talk about my sad and lonely life, okay?"
He drained the tub and refilled it once more, the water even hotter.  He had put a new charm, with Snape's help, on the water tank.  He had all the hot water he ever needed.  He missed his wand, and while Snape was incredibly accommodating by sharing his, he really needed his own.  He wished he could stop moping but his heart ached so much.
Hermione grabbed it and stuffed it in her bag.  "Thank you, Professor."  She turned and walked out of the room, quickly followed by Harry.
He waited for fifteen minutes, stewing with indignation, before he finally saw the far too amused face of his lunch appointment.  He had arrived late himself and was terribly annoyed that Harry had kept him waiting even longer.
For the first time, he felt panic.
Draco burst out laughing.  "You really do have a lot to learn.  If you care to.  Or you can continue to wallow in your own Muggleness."
"Yes," he said to the cat.
Slow shuffles brought Harry closer and closer to Draco, who shrank with every inch he gained.  "Draco," Harry said and watched as the man flinched at the word.  "Draco, why would you kill me?  I trust you.  You won't hurt me."  With pained effort, Harry squatted next to his friend, his broken leg propped off to one side.  "I won't fight or struggle.  I know it isn't as good as catchoo blood, but I offer it to you.  When we get out, we can get you more.  It's okay.  You don’t have to suffer."  Still more slowly than ever, he reached out a hand and touched Draco's fine hair where it cascaded over his face.  The vampire flinched as if Harry had shocked him, but Harry pressed on and laid his hand firmly against Draco's head.  Gently, he petted the man.
"Oh!" Draco called.
"Okay, I'll be right there."
The heartbeat fumbled, then raced like a fluttering bird.
It had rained the night before and the air smelt clean, if you discounted the smoking tailpipes from the traffic jam to his right.  The sky was a hundred different shades of gray; a thick layer of clouds covered the skyline as lower cotton puffs snagged onto some of the taller buildings.  It was a typical London winter.
"You two certainly squawk like a pair of guineafowl in the morning.  If I'd known that, I would have kicked you straight out of bed."
Tufts snarled, showing the full length of one fang, but the emotion was completely cocky.
"Severus!  Have I not told you, Draco?  Do not trust that man.  He could convince a Norwegian to prance around in his skivvies on New Year's Eve in the Town Square while eating a popsicle.  Do not trust that man.  He's probably behind all of it.  Sniveling, little, ratfaced, backstabbing—"
"No.  Please don't."  The words came quickly, too quick to pull them back.
He's the fourth over the bulwark, the flood of pirates behind him pressing him over the railing, tumbling him lemming style, thrown into the unknown.  Someone steps on his hand, another kicks him in the shin, and still they come, even as the Death Eaters swarm them with a volley of stunners, Cruciatus, and the green flash of death.
"Well, I must say I wouldn't have picked Potter for you, but you seem somehow happy, somehow you fit better in this world, like you've found your place.  And for that I'm thankful."  She smiled and threw her arms around him.  He wrapped his own arms around her and was thankful that she'd always been there for him, through each and every one of his own moments of insanity.  “It’s a pity you can’t get that ritual out of him, though.”
The door opened wide, releasing soft sounds of some corny Irish tune, and Potter's curious smile melted into surprise. Draco had been certain he'd given a hundred different kinds of hints that he'd be back the next day.  Maybe Potter wasn't too keen after five lagers.... Maybe Potter just wasn't that keen at all.
A large banner fluttered in the conjured breeze, hanging across the main street of Diagon Alley.  In big, bold letters of gold it read "Minister Malfoy: Bringing in a New Era."  A flock of white doves flew from building top to building top; every so often a feather would flutter down to the ground below.  The sky was clear, and the breeze relieved some of the noonday heat.  Scores of people had gathered for the Minister's speech, dutiful in their support, watchful of the crowd, taking note of who wasn't in attendance.  Everyone was smiling.
"So it was your friend who set off the trap.  Ha.  Told you he'd fine us out," said something from the vicinity of her mouth.  "He's not as much of an idiot as you think he is."
Harry searched inside himself and found more than a small desire to dash away Malfoy's pained expression.  Maybe it would be a smart word, a smile, or a kiss to the nose.  The combination of lips and Malfoy burned inside Harry, almost like the memory of Malfoy's flavor on his tongue.  Harry'd been alone for so long, these few hours with Malfoy had torn his old world down to the foundation and he found the new one not at all familiar.
It was broken. By one person.
"I don't know.  Do something funny.  Impersonate a ferret," Harry said with a laugh as he looked over his shoulder at Draco.  Draco stood back lit by the fire, a fist anchored on each of his hips.  Harry quickly faced forward, examining the pile of chopped greenery.  Oops.
Hermione was quiet again, and Harry wondered if she was still there or if she'd fallen asleep or wandered off or was just ignoring them, though he thought all of those options rather implausible. So he waited and finally she agreed to hear what they had to say. She was dually impressed they cracked her code, though Harry noticed she didn't point out that Draco already knew about it. The two men filled her in on the Quetzalcoatl Staff and what Popicon had told them. She was regaled with their exploits in Mexico, Sirius' return, and finally told what they found out from Kogelmann.
Struck dumb, Draco could only nod.  Maybe if he agreed, Potter wouldn't crack completely and attack him.
"Uncle Draco!  Help me!" she squealed.
"I'm so sorry," she says, and Luna smiles up at her.
Harry blinked.  "Wha—ah no!  I'm quite alright."  The little sadist.  As if he'd want to go anywhere near the water.  Then he blinked again.  Go in the water with her and Ron?  Eww.  "I was just leaving."  He waved, his back turned on them, and slipped out of the bath, only to bump into Draco.
In spite of himself, Harry hummed in laughter—apparently he wasn't the only one Snape's voice affected—and was rewarded by another gasp, and then Draco slipped into incoherent babbling of 'yes' and 'please' and 'Merlin' and 'fucking
"Severus?"  Draco's eyes squinted, then he leaned back against the chair.  "A portrait?"
"That's great!"  The awkward moment inconsequently dissipated.
When was it that Harry had caught his attention?  Frightened his heart into this rabid pace?  Upon the knowledge of his non-murdering status?  The day of his capture?  Perhaps it was their graduation ceremony, cut short by the Dark Lord's intervention and Harry's going to ground.  Maybe it was that moment when a careless curse cut him in two, leaking out his life's blood.
Millicent already has the staves ready, and the exact second they resurface, she bombards the Ministry's ship with explosive charms, scorching and chomping against its sleek walls.  Luna feels bad for the ship, for she is a beauty.  Probably straight out of the yards in Falmouth.  It's not the ship's fault who owns it, but Luna doesn't let such sentimentalities overrule her duty and judgment.  The Ministry's corruption has already tainted it.  Its potential has already been drowned and buried.
It was wide open out there in the valley and a healthy amount of panic washed over Harry.  His eyes darted around, seeking out any threat: a man lurking nearby, a flash of white Death Eater mask.  It was vast and there was nowhere to hide.  Instinctively he leaned close to Snape, touching sides with him.
"I know.  But we are living it.  Living history.  Our children won't have lived through it, it will be something they study in a dry class that gives dates and figures.  But we'll tell them.  We'll tell them all about what happened.  The injustice, the horror.  We will tell them everything and make it real, this history.  We will tell them why we fought."
A short, well-endowed, and substantial woman walked through the darkened opening. Her thick hands where clasped before her and her smile was so electric that Draco found himself smiling back. At the awareness, he dropped the smile and glanced at Harry and Remus to see if they'd noticed, but they were apparently mesmerized by this happy person as well.
"Hello," he said simply after they caught up to him.
"Well, people had seen some bloke with this crystal ball and some said there was a light or something from it that zapped folks. A guy with a crew cut had the ball, not someone anyone knew, not one of the Dark Lord's men. No one would talk to him though, I mean, ya can't trust someone with such Muggle tastes."
Harry's gaze zeroed right on him, and narrowed.  "That's not what you're supposed to say.  You're supposed to say 'Oh Harry, that's terrible.  I'm sure if you avoid the prat, you'll never have to see him again.'"
Harry reached out an arm, shaking in want and anticipation, but was stalled. Pulling his awareness away from that which was all he ever desired, he noticed a hand on his arm, barring him from the promise of completion.
"I did what?" Potter… Harry asked, aghast.
"Do you know anything more about this ball?" Harry asked, showing no sense of the urgency Draco knew he must be feeling.
Harry doffed his shorts and stepped into the lake naked.  With slow steps he went deeper and deeper until the cool water reached his groin, and he shivered as it washed over his sensitive skin.
"We'll be heading to Costa Rica tomorrow; you coming with us?"
"  Nothing at all.
"'There are some references to the reversal of the curse, but I haven't found a complete ritual yet. I have sent a request for an audience with the Yukon coven as it exists today. Let's hope they keep good records!
"Okay, Fine.  I won't touch the Death Eater.  Don't worry."
Harry shook his head.  "We weren't there when it happened.  I don’t know what could be affecting her."  Anyway, why would she be in an alley, Malfoy's alley, when affected by this spell?  Harry didn't think this had anything to do with a mishap at the Department.  The whole thing set up alarm bells.
And he looked down at his hands once more and saw that they were hands…and then paws… as if the two were on separate realities overlying each other, that they took up the same space at the same time.
"Mreow?"
Luna offers a conciliatory smile, a small lift to her shoulders that seemed to say 'well you did threaten someone.'
"Robot?"
"Hello Miss Apis, I'm Harry Potter, this is Draco Malfoy and Remus Lupin," Harry introduced them all. Apis nodded to each one.
"Pansy."  This time it's Harry who speaks.  "If you insist on attacking people on my ship, we will remove your wand."  Pansy faces the two pirates, a casual glance at Harry and then her gaze halts on Luna.
Draco squeezed his hand around the car, Harry by his side.  He thought it terribly amusing that Harry thought the car was real and simply reduced in size.  He added it to the pile of things he found endearing about the other man, though Draco thought it best to keep that to himself.  Harry already had enough leverage against him.
"Guess the privacy charms are down," Harry said, grinning up at Draco.
"Hello, Mediwitch Periwinkle, how is Hermione doing today?"
He looked from where his finger was half buried over to Snape, whose own eyes were brightly latched onto that connection between the two younger men.  Then he nodded at Harry.  "Go on."
"Draco.  Do you dream of Draco?" she asked.
Finally, more wands lit the darkened room. Harry tore his attention away from the empty centre of the circle, turning towards where he last heard Scrimgeour's cry. Moony was sitting there, muzzle stained red and Scrimgeour's body prone at his feet. Snout aimed towards the air, Moony howled again.
key, really," the man said nodding. "There are a few ways to get out of the Labyrinth, and that little ball is just one way that might work for you. Though, it might not." He shrugged casually.
The soft features of Harry's face suddenly went stiff and sadness rimmed the man's eyes. "Still in a coma."
"Those are sentient beings, Harry, not some lower life form."  Though Harry wasn't looking at her, he was certain she'd just rolled her eyes at him.  "You would think after all your work redesigning the Ministry that you would at least have a grasp between the Beast Division and the Being Division."
, like some believed, but the pure perfection that was creating a flawless potion, developing a fine distillation, designing portable magic.
An odd sensation, something like a portkey, fluttered in his gut and grew with such ferocity that he swallowed to ward off the nausea threatening to bend him over.
"MEOW!"  The call was persistent and questioning and Harry was at a loss as to what to do.  Coming by daily to feed Crookshanks wasn't necessarily a hardship, but the poor feline was lonely, and Harry really didn't have the time to play with him like a proper pet sitter.
Snape entered from the outside, brushing off a dusting of snow as he stomped his shoes on the woven mat.  He scrutinized the two boys sitting inches away from the fire on the worn, wool rug.  Greyback's wand slowly dimmed until it went dark, leaving the fire as their only light source.
His lover smiled up at him.  "Yes," Draco offered, earning him a wide grin from Harry's amused face.
Severus set his utensils down across his plate and looked at Harry.
"I was about to come looking for you, luckily you showed up," said Remus as he began fixing up breakfast. "There's a letter for you. From Popicon." Remus fanned the letter in the air over his head.
While he finally accepted his current unemployed status, sure that he had made the right decisions, Harry hadn't thought of how his actions might affect those he cared about.  How those blood thirsty Aurors, especially Agent Wilkes, descended on Remus worried Harry.  His friend was already living in a precarious balance; he didn't think the added stress could do anything good for him.
Harry'd been awake for a while.  Something was different today.  Something seemed… hopeful.
Harry nuzzled into the curve of Malfoy's neck.
"Too bad.  I need more hot men to dance with."  His eyes roved over Harry's body appraisingly.
"Well keep digging, dig deep.  There has to be a trigger, a switch inside him that will unlock what he knows."
For long hours, Harry and Terry pore over the charts, Luna adding her own opinions on where they should sail next.  Draco watches it all from the entrance to his room, the flicker of Caribbean blue from above giving him a feeling of seclusion.  When Harry looks up, trying to catch his eye, Draco turns away and walks amongst the crew, below the shrouds, along the deck, talks to the phoenix guiding their way, watches the weather and the moody sea.  At times the phoenix looks at him, carved of wood and soaked with sea brine, but it never offers any answer to Draco's questions.
"Potter, drink this potion."  Snape stuffed a glass jar into Harry's hand.  "Whatever attacked you hit you with pure magical energy that seemed determined to consume your arm.  Luckily, Draco retrieved us in time to stop the corrosive nature of the curse.  Fortunately for
"Did he say how Ron and Hermione are?  Ginny?  What's going on out there?"  Even though he did enjoy this hollow existence, a very large part of him needed to know what was happening.  Suddenly, he missed his friends.
Draco's heart stalled in his chest.  Harry thought he hated him?  Draco raced to the Floo, totally ignoring Ron's burning anger as he called out, "Get the hell out of my way, I'm coming through."
"Yes Potter, do keep your hands off me," Draco drawled, casually dusting off the front of his jacket.  It was the trademark sneer that sent Harry over the edge again.
Home. That is what this was. Draco had finally found home.
Potter shifted behind him.  Draco glanced over his shoulder, but could barely see Potter's shape in the darkness of their blind.  "Yeah, I know.  And so does the guy I'm sitting next to right now."
Something about the confession lifted a weight he hadn't realized he'd been bent under.
"I merely wanted to see what pets you had trapped down here, werewolf," came a rasping voice that seemed oddly familiar.  If it was smoother and louder, he would have said it sounded like Professor Snape.  Same cadence, same tone, same condescension.  But that man was dead.
Suddenly Harry pulled back and studied Draco, who seemed alarmed at the swift retreat of those warm lips.  "What's wrong," he asked?
"Oi Draco, that you?"
"Hmm, hmmm.  Hmmm hmm hmmmmmm."
It was a relief.
"What," he sputtered. "I can't take your memories from you!" Harry hated the memory affecting spells. He hated the thought of them being used on him and even more, he hated using them on others. Nothing seemed a worse violation than raping the mind.
They ate dinner at a homey little restaurant sitting below the residence of the establishment's owners.  It offered a mix of local cuisine and Chinese.  Draco had thought it a rather laughable combination, but eventually admitted a glass of good Riesling went surprisingly well with Kung Pao chicken.
"Mr. Michael Rosenbloom, from the Office of the Minister's Affairs," she said with a smirk and then walked out of his office.
"Where did he get all this?" Pansy asked, and Draco shrugged, watching Harry organize some bolts and nuts into a model of the Eiffel Tower.
"No small talk?  My, my Potter, already past the niceties of social convention I see.  Well, I must say I do approve.  Let's get down to business.  I have translated these papers.  A whole bunch of unconnected gibberish, if you ask me."  He handed the rolled up scroll he carried in his hand to Harry.
"Harry, you've been unconscious for three days," Remus explained in his fatherly tone.
Snape hissed, his tone awash with a hint of the unimpressed professor.
Malfoy pushed himself to sitting.  Harry hadn't been able to hold him anymore.  The limp body, the vacant eyes, that delicious scent of blood.  All of it, a harsh reminder of exactly what Harry was.
Harry pushes himself to standing, crosses his arms as he studies Draco.  "Draco."
He stood and then slumped into a blue velvet chair next to the Floo.  The green flames had faded and now they crackled a merry orange.  Merlin, did those two drain the will to live right out of him.
sign in the actual movie that suggests they're vampires," Harry said with a wry grin.  "Maybe I'll notice it this time 'round."
With proper incentive and constant work, Harry finally began to get the hang of his new wand and the odd way magic worked in this world.  It wasn't natural and spontaneous, at least not for Harry, and he had to focus and force every single spell, from cantrip to charm.  Eventually, the simpler spells were his to command and Severus had even taught him a charm to see the shadows of the other dimensions so close to their own.  It astounded him that in some places this lake and field were highly trafficked by people constantly coming and going and here it was virtually deserted.
"I just wanted a little fun," Harry pouted.  He had one hand gripped around the collar of the blow up doll and another held the bright red lolly he was sucking on.  Something about him looked sinful and Draco covered his eyes and took three deep breaths.  "I found the telly section, too," he mumbled through his full mouth.
, this country boy.  And more and more, Draco realized that he wanted to win this contest.
"Fine. You cross your eyes staring at that damned monstrosity on the wall."
"Call Draco."  Harry's head shot up, for once not mesmerised by the ransom note.  Was it a ransom note?  It didn’t demand anything.  "He'll pass it on to someone competent in MLE.  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?"  Harry definitely had a squirrelly look about him; his gaze lowered, and he refused to look at Ron, or that damned slip of paper.
Then why that blankness?  That dead zone?  Obviously, it had thrown Draco for a loop, as it had Harry.
"Yes, it is," he said and smiled; happy in a way he had never thought possible.
They stared at each other, Draco's hand gently resting between Harry's shoulder blades as Harry's heart rate slowed.  Then he took his hand away, and that soft gaze vanished.  "You've gotten Lucius wet, CatBoy."  He scowled.  "He is not pleased."
"Night Harry. It's been a long day." Remus left to gather his blankets and make his bed on the couch. Harry wasn't sleepy, and he needed to think.
A fat fly flew by, and he zapped it with a crackle of magic.  It fell like a pebble to the spongy earth below.
"Yes, we know. We're working on trying to cure you: Draco, Remus and me. Ron is doing his part, too. You're not the only person affected by the curse. However, with your shield spell up, you've been impacted differently by it."
"Draco? Draco." Harry grasped onto Draco, onto his lifeline, onto sanity, constantly saying that name over and over like a chant of stability he so desperately needed.
He continued to observe from a corner, pushing away the niggling impulse to leave and run to his jewel.  So many people on this festive night, celebrating Christmas, celebrating being
Draco sizes her up.  "And Harry Potter swooped down, saving them from utter destruction, and now has your undying loyalty."  He can hear a bell clanging from somewhere in the larger cavern, the sound somehow swelling with each ring.
Remus cleared his throat and offered Harry and Draco an apologetic shrug. "Sleep? I have to get some rest or I'm worthless to you two. I know we all went through shite in that maze and I, for one, need some recuperation. So, Harry, I'm going back to Hermione's and…"
"Thank you, Greg.  I owe you."
Then a chime tinkled and Draco instinctively knew it was time.  It must be Beltane.  The three men stood and gathered up their things.
"Do you need any help?" Harry found himself offering. He wasn't quite ready to have Draco removed from his presence. He realised he enjoyed the man's company, enjoyed the intense look in his eyes.
"Does the Wolfsbane not help anymore?"
"Draco, why are you naked?  I think that you can figure out what…"
"Uh…" He wasn't sure what to say, but he knew he didn't want to let go. Instead he began drawing his hand up and down Sirius' back, wriggling his fingers in the hair at the nap of his neck. Feeling him.
"You've been working with Snape?" he asked, stunned.
," he cast.  "
There he lies, Captain, My Captain! a cold corpse.
was really appealing.
"What?" Harry asked.
"Why don't you tell me what you found different about the place this morning; show me where Fritz is kept, the note's location…"  Draco finished with a nod that got Harry walking.  As Harry slipped into the back room, Draco glanced at Ron.  Ron grinned.
First, he had to figure out what the Mastermind's goal was.  Why curse Hogwarts and Hogsmeade with odd mutations?  Were they all test subjects and this wicked ringleader would then turn his evil mutation ray on the world?  Maybe the Mastermind had hatred for all wizardkind, wanted revenge, the most noble of reasons!
Draco took in one deep breath and let it out before he looked up to meet Harry's eyes.  "You are cursed."
They almost tumbled in their landing, but Draco was graceful on his feet and collected himself with ease.  He raced into his library, startled Severus in his portrait and began rifling through books.  Tufts padded softly in behind him.
"Well…" Greg shifted around nervously and Draco couldn't blame him. While Greg certainly claimed the largest stature in the room, Ron stood as tall as he and was a fully trained Auror. Not to mention Harry "Savior of the Wizarding World" Potter's presence as well as that of a werewolf. The intimidation factor boiled high. "I sent ya an owl that returned to me… and I knew this was really important, so I left 'Peia a note and came to London. You know I'm still wanted…" his eyes darted to Ron again. "I went to your club and met with your bouncer, but it was actually your bartender who talked him into tellin' me where ya were."
He ran his fingers over his nipples, just like Harry had, tweaked them as he caressed his hands down his body, over his hips, rubbing along his thighs brushing against the fine hairs there. He let his imagination bring every sensation to reality as he touched the full expanse of his body, except that which coveted touch the most.
"What do you know?" he asked Duncan under his breath.
Harry kept his feet, barely.  His heart beat with fear and excitement, a mile a minute, ready to burst from his chest.  He had no idea!  Well, how could he?  Draco never told him a God damned thing.
Sitting in a pew, bathed in candlelight, Potter sat, head bowed.
"Oh, the furball just asked if someone would get him a cat toy, mouse shaped preferably, with Super Nip.  Must be Super Nip, he says."  Tufts hissed and went to hide behind Potterette, who was chuckling into the back of her hand.
"Murumph murr shuurip poodle."
"Perhaps you should get your wand out, Harry, and help me deal with these little pests!"
"Yes, Harry.  I mean it."  He kissed the top of Harry's head.
Ultimately, as Draco hovered, poised over Harry, inches from driving in, he wished he could see the other man's face, but Harry buried his head in the bed sheets, his hands grasping onto them like a nervous maiden.  Harry ground out something not quite satisfying from between clenched teeth, but it wasn't any last minute "maybe this isn't such a good idea," and Draco didn't know what he would have done if it had been.
"Yeah, sure… they were still going to ship us all off the Isles."  Laura's fingers are pressed white as she grips her steak knife.  "This is our home; this is where we were born!"
"No, that's fine.  Just bring it out when it's ready, please."  The woman nodded and walked off.
Ginny nodded, watching as they left the hospital room.
"Um, Harry.  Why don't you put something on?  Better yet, why don't you take a shower, and I'll get you some clothes.  Yeah?"
The goblin Gibbibuck spat at Draco.  "They have no rights."
She turned back to Harry, who waited patiently, and said in that loud whisper, "I have a date for you."  The smile Harry had sported immediately slipped off his face and a pained expression took its place.
, Harry thought.  That magic.  That connection.  He'd felt it last night when they were together, when Draco was in his arms and they'd
Harry's blood roared in his ears and seemed to be filling ever portion of his body, except the portion he wanted filled.  As Draco shucked off his own pants, Harry stared at this unmoving cock, lying there against his thigh like a deflated balloon.
Draco whimpered.  Harry pulled out and pressed in.  Draco groaned and thrust.
Draco grabbed his dish.  "Potter, that is disgusting.  Get your hand out of your mouth; you don't know where either have been."  Turning his back on the monstrous curiosity that was Potter, Draco took his plate into the kitchen.  He placed the dirty plate in the sink and peered out the small window overlooking the uninhabited hills surrounding his home.  Evening shadows blended individual fir trees into a single mass.  To the far right the hills were streaked with purple and dark pink.  This was his home, his secluded hide-away, and now his childhood nuisance was invading it.  He looked away from the window down to his hands, rubbing his wrist where Potter had grabbed him.  He suddenly felt smothered.
Then Harry spotted a ripple through the air and Snape reappeared.  "If you would rather stay out here in the elements, by all means do so.  However, if you would gather your wits about you and follow me through the wards, you would find more civilized conditions."
His mind wandered back to The Moon and Mars, something he tried very hard not to do when at work.
A flinch wracks his body, and he drops to the deck—the sound echoes in Luna's ears.  Pansy laughs; it's shrill and theatrical.  Luna closes her eyes and waits, unable to move, unable to speak; she can only hum softly through parted lips.
Remus leaned forward over his knees, his head tucked low, protecting his delicate innards as he waited for the devil that walked through the arch to bite him deep and rip out his soul.
There, that sounded demanding.  Surely Potter would argue with him, sputter incoherently and then finally break down into hexing him so Draco would have a more solid excuse at retaliation.  Draco eagerly awaited the upcoming diversion.
"Ah, but he can transform where you cannot."
"Dunno where it came from. It were all word of mouth. I heard from a friend who heard from someone else. Ya know how it goes, Lupin."
"Should we call the Aurors?"
"Alright. Let's go." And as quickly as that, the moment dissipated, as Draco knew it would.
the chess set and pieces, which all flew into the room and organized themselves primly in regimental rows on the table next to Potter's bed.
A complete lack of sound descended upon the two.
"I'm showering and then we shall go," he told Tufts.
The car zipped along the A303, onto the M3 and then stuttered to a stop.  Harry and Draco stared at it.  Draco nudged it with his wand, sparking the little car with magic.  It rolled backwards, then zoomed forward again, across other maps without so much as a hiccup, until its wheels touched the road map of inner London.  Then it twirled around the edge of the map, centring on something.  Harry looked over at Draco, a little sceptical about the whole thing.
And eventually, there were kisses.
Spatty totters in, her too-large feet flopping against the marble tile.  "Tea, Master Draco, sir?" she asks, her eyes wide and watery, holding up the silver server as her ears flap at him.
"Where are you?  Where did you go?  I'm trying to get back to you.  Harry?  Severus?  I'm trying…"
"Do not be.  I am here.  I dare say your shadow is the worse thing to afflict you right now."
Draco left to get more.
you, I would have kept you?"  With two long strides Harry was on the other side of the desk, yelling in Draco's face.  They were chest to chest, and Draco realized that this body was the body he dreamed of at night, this voice was the one that moaned out his name.
It was beyond Harry how Draco knew how to get them out of the endless dunes.  Maybe it was something to do with his special brand of crazy.  Maybe Lucius the doll had whispered the answer.  Maybe Draco had special knowledge from his Young Death Eater days.  Harry didn't care; Draco had saved him.
This definitely broke the strain.
"Interviews conducted by you.  Don't you see there is some conflict of interest here?" explained Agent Savage.
stalled and everything, everything that mattered came to a screeching halt.
"Did you see where he went?" Draco demanded.  He couldn't lose Harry.  He could only imagine what Pansy would do to him.  Not to mention the fact that he held the answer to ripping down his father's Ministry.
"Well, what can I do for you?  We still haven’t found out anything about Hermione’s attack."  He looked apologetic.
Harry growled in annoyance. "We don’t have time to waste. Who knows where the others have been taken. We have to finish this now! Fuck!" Harry punched the stone wall and then gingerly shook his bleeding hand, the skin peeling off his knuckles.
