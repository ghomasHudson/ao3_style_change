The urge to cast a hex was great, but Harry held back. Hopefully, Greyback would lead him to the boy. Harry scarcely dared to breathe and took a moment to give thanks that the wind was blowing towards him rather than away. If Greyback got the slightest whiff of him, the game would be up. Even as the thought occurred to Harry, Greyback paused and lifted his head. His slanted eyes darted right and left in a wary pattern and he stood tensely. For a moment, Harry thought he'd been scented, but then Greyback shook his head, snapped one more branch from the dead tree at his feet, and then turned and started up the hillside with the gathered branches floating behind.
“Silence, Potter.”  Malfoy punctuated his command with a loud smack of Harry’s wand against his palm.  “As I was saying, you committed a transgression for which you were never punished.”
"I was taught at a very early age. The statute for underaged magic is seldom enforced in magical households. My father would have given them the what for if they'd have even tried to curtail my lessons." Draco wrinkled his nose. "Funny how I used to worship him as a youngster. I was always so impressed at his arrogance, and thought it was brilliant to emulate his sense of superiority. I expected it was the thing to do, to treat others with contempt and rudeness, as though they were little more than ants to step on, unless they had some useful function."
Maeve stood up and quickly walked to a small desk beneath the window. She yanked open a drawer and took out a slim wand. "But he had to have that pale bitch, Narcissa Black. The bloody bastard had it planned the whole time." She glared at Draco. "Where is your wand?"
"I'll just remain with the original plan and sacrifice you on the altar, here. I have a Protection Spell on this land to keep the Muggles from destroying it, and also to keep them from discovering my presence. Every so often it needs replenishing."
It occurred to Draco that Potter was an Auror, always alert for danger. For some reason, the knowledge made Draco feel warm, as though Potter could spring into action at any moment. Draco imagined him leaping to his feet, muscles lengthening and contracting, wand snapping out at the ready, and thighs rippling.
Blaise flashed a bright smile. "Draco might not know where he is, but he always knows where you are."
The bird struggled in his hand and gave an angry-sounding chirp. Draco scowled. "Protest all you like, but it's true. In your defence, you might be injured, yeah? Now hold still so I can check."
Harry went to the sideboard and poured some liquid into a snifter. Draco was amused to hear the glass rattle slightly. Potter was definitely spooked. He handed Draco the glass and their fingers brushed for the merest instant. Potter reacted as if electrified. Draco pretended not to notice.
His assistant crept forwards, hand outstretched so far that it seemed she would prefer to detach her arm completely and send it at him with a spell rather than take one step closer. He sighed. Nothing of interest, then. "Ummmm," she said with her usual inability to articulate. He took the stack of photographs anyway.
"Then say it again!" Crabbe twisted his hand in Klein's hair and she let out a faint cry of protest. Draco braced himself, half-expecting Crabbe to kill her in a rage, but a ruckus near the passageway drew Draco's attention, and Crabbe followed his line of sight. He released Klein's hair and stepped away from her as Draco's blood froze.
"No! In truth, Draco, I'm the one using Ministry resources for personal gain. You are definitely not a suspect and I could get in serious trouble." Potter put out a hand and pressed it against the wall next just above Draco's shoulder. He leaned closer and Draco watched as a bead of sudsy water followed the curve of his cheek and then paused at the edge of his stubble-covered jaw. "Serious. Trouble."
Draco's toes dragged on the same floor, brushing it as he spun slowly from the chain, he was up too high to gain purchase and take some of the pressure off of his aching arms and wrists. The beams overhead creaked, protesting his weight.
Harry shook his head and pulled at his hair. Rather than admit to the notion that, in fact, they were getting on too well, he just repeated his entreaty. “Please. Will you help?”
"Two."  A second blow crossed over the first and Harry’s hands clenched on the wood as his body rocked.  He did not have enough breath to cry out and simply made a strangled noise.
Sorry for the delay on this chapter! My poor mum fell and broke her hip and we had no contact for DAYS due to being locked out of the hospital because of Covid-19, so it was a nerve-wracking few days of not knowing what was happening until she became coherent enough to text us. Hopefully, my brain is now back online and I can get this finished soon!
Harry politely agreed it was a pity, and yes, he thought the Wasps had a fighting chance, and no, he had no idea where the Minister might be, nor when he would be back. By the time the lift stopped at the Atrium floor and Harry pushed out with the crowd of Wasp fans, Malfoy was gone.
"Then shut it." Harry painstakingly typed the word in the correct box. He waited. Nothing happened. "I think it's broken."
Harry waved at them and the doors slammed shut. Malfoy glowered at him from his slouched position in the corner. His arms were crossed and he fairly exuded ice.
"Want some of mine?" Malfoy asked and handed over a tumbler half-full of something dark that might have been amber-coloured. It was difficult to tell in the muted light from the fairy lights in the trees overhead. Harry accepted the glass.
The Quidditch Gala was a fundraising event held each year before the Quidditch World Cup. The most affluent members of wizarding society were invited, as well as a goodly collection of the merely well-to-do, and anyone else that could score a ticket through friends, acquaintances, or bribery.
"Financiers, plural?" Hermione sipped at her tea. She looked more uncomfortable than Malfoy, even though she sat in her own favourite chair across from him.
Potter's fingers traced the old scar. Draco hooked his fingers into the waistband of Potter's jeans and pulled him in for a kiss. "Never mind, Potter. No past, remember, just right now."
Harry helped her and by the time Draco appeared, looking refreshed and alert once more, they had several stacks of varied materials.
Harry shifted his hips in acquiescence. He was up for anything Draco wanted, without question. "Yes," he said aloud, leaving no doubt.
"Yes, he is… something else. Thank you for your help, Doctor. We will let you know if anything comes to light."
When the darkness was nearly complete, Draco's eyes opened. Harry registered the change in his breathing first and waited soundlessly while Draco sat up and massaged his neck with a groan—the awkward position had obviously taken its toll. Draco froze when he noticed Harry. His slim throat worked in a swallow and then he sighed.
The sheet tore away and while the fresh air was welcome, the brightness was not, nor was the sight of Pansy Parkinson's shocked face. On the plus side, she seemed to have been rendered speechless and she turned her stare to Draco, jaw agape.
Draco reluctantly pulled away, moving as slowly as possible and dragging his hands over every bit of Potter’s skin he could reach during the motion. His cock slipped out wetly and Draco had to suppress the urge to bend down and lick the reddened opening clean, which was disturbing, to say the least. And yet Potter’s response to Draco's tonguing had been extraordinary. Draco wanted more of it. His cock began to harden at the very idea and Draco groaned, dropping his forehead to rest on the small of Potter's back.
"I do remember something about that night," Draco said and felt a flare of satisfaction when Mark blushed. Draco hadn't been referring to their dance, to Mark's grasping hands, delicious erection, or hot, heavy desire, although he was certainly thinking of it
"Do shut up, Weasley." Draco leaned his head back against the stone wall and closed his eyes. "And let me know when Shacklebolt gets here. It's been a long day and I'm rather tired." He waited for Weasley to retort, but he heard only a muttered oath and then angry footsteps stamping away.
By the time he finished hanging the last photo, the first few were dry. He collected them all in a box and went back into the bedroom. (His darkroom was a modified broom cupboard.)
That was completely true, even the liking part. She still annoyed him, but she had been astonishingly valuable with research. Harry had plenty of energy and was excellent at mowing through piles of material to pick out the useful bits, but Harry still expected to find a direct answer, to pull a piece of parchment from the stack labeled "Remedy." Harry's method was to drive headlong into an issue and pummel it into submission, which was an excellent quality when fighting a tangible foe. This problem, however, had to be approached from every angle.
Gryphon was sat on the bed, wearing a dark blue velvet dressing gown patterned with white orchids. She looked uneasy and almost vulnerable after the clothing change and Harry wondered if she preferred heavy skirts and corsets as a sort of armour. It made sense, he supposed.
"I'll get you some blankets," Harry said and escaped the kitchen to locate some linens. That had gone easier than expected. He breathed a sigh of relief.
Draco relaxed minutely. For some reason, Potter hadn't let go of his arm. "I believe he is cold sober, actually. I, fortunately, am not." Draco lifted his glass as if imploring the gods of drunkenness to refill it for him. "Do you like cock, Potter?" Draco turned to look into Potter's shocked face and wondered if it might be worth risking a Splinch to Apparate home and escape whatever scathing comment (or possible hex) that Potter planned to unleash upon him for asking such a blatantly stupid question. Draco was gobsmacked when Potter chuckled.
"You were supposed to come alone, Draco. Why did you have to bring the others? You've made things difficult. You always make things so difficult. I should have killed you instead of leaving you to Crabbe."
Harry expected them to return to the gardens and enter the house via the front doors, but Malfoy bypassed the gardens completely and instead followed a path that skirted the broom shed and crossed a small brook by way of an elegant-looking white stone bridge. The path was lined with white flowers, blooming despite the threat of frost.
The bell jangled as the door opened and Harry's hand froze over the inkwell. He could have been hit with a Full-body Bind for as strongly as his ability to move deserted him.
"I didn't take it; I borrowed it. Are you really going to take me to task for breaking the rules, Potter?" Malfoy sat back, eyes flashing.
"Lift," Harry murmured and pulled gently on Malfoy's hand. Malfoy allowed it, and seemed to relax incrementally. "Good," Harry said. "Now swish and jab, all in one smooth motion, as if you are—yes, like that. Now, again."
that by the time he'd recovered his ability to think straight, Malfoy had been down the stairs and gone. Harry had tried reaching him by Floo and owl for nearly an hour before giving up.
Ron's voice broke for a moment and he cleared his throat. "Anyway, I came inside through the back door. Thirsty work, weeding. I heard voices and walked round the corner to see that woman forcing a potion down Malfoy's throat."
"Draco, I—" Potter started, but the words turned into a strangled sort of gurgle when Draco mouthed the head of his cock through the material of his briefs. Draco felt a rush of pure pleasure.
," Parkinson said, "but could I please speak to you for a minute?" She gave Harry a smile, surprising him. He hadn't known she could smile like a regular person. Harry stepped back, escaping Malfoy's pout and clinging hands with effort.
Harry waited, almost breathless, to discover what Malfoy's Patronus would be. He could not recall ever seeing it in training. The white flare that burst from Malfoy's wand was not a Patronus, however. It went straight through the creature in a flash that seemed to have no effect, and then dissipated.
He supposed he should go downstairs and apologise. Perhaps he could make up a plausible story. "Sorry, I didn't mean to nearly kiss you, I was just looking into your eyes for the first time in days and sort of…fell in. Your irises have tiny dark flecks amongst the pale silver. Did you know?"
"A well-fed messenger because I am buying your dinner." He lifted a hand and snapped his fingers. The waiter appeared so quickly he might have Apparated.
Harry sat on his couch in the pitch-black room holding a glass of Scotch. It was rather stupid to be drinking Scotch, because it simply didn't have the same effect any longer. It was impossible for him to get drunk—except on Draco Malfoy's blood, apparently, though he shied away from that thought immediately—but he still enjoyed the taste, so he sipped at it while his mind replayed the scene at the party, even as he desperately tried to keep from doing so.
Although he had never thought about having sex with a man before, now it seemed he could think of nothing else. He pictured Malfoy pushing him up against the sink and cupping his cock with a hand. Harry thought about fisting his hands in Malfoy's hair and pressing biting kisses into his throat.
Draco quickly put his shirt back on—he'd been using it to swat at the hoards of insects determined to feast on his flesh the instant it had stopped raining—and tucked it into his trousers to disguise the ragged bit where he had procured his makeshift bandage.
"Ah… a bit. I was out with…" Harry broke off, unwilling to admit he'd been out with Malfoy, whose release was top secret, despite the fact that Malfoy seemed perfectly fine with being seen in a high-class restaurant. "A friend."
"I wanted to make sure you didn't scurry off on another job and figured the best way to ascertain that was to hire you myself," she said. Ron nodded and Draco wondered if he was ever allowed to squeeze a word in edgewise. He almost felt sorry for Ron living with the budding termagant. Harry might be bossy at times, but at least he shut up on occasion, especially when Draco slid his tongue halfway down his throat…
"I love chocolate," Harry admitted and unwrapped the frog. He held it until the candy creature stopped trying to hop away and solidified, melting slightly under his fingers. He broke it in half and handed a portion to Malfoy.
It couldn't be! There was no possible way that Harry Potter could have sent in that brilliant, enticing, sexy as fuck photo.
In the end, they had to traverse the floating platforms to reach the door, although it was made quicker with the addition of Hermione. Parkinson and Cho remained behind. Once Draco threw open the door, they transfigured a detached wall sconce into a bridge and hauled it into the room for Parkinson to cross. She unceremoniously hauled Cho along by the collar and then dropped her at Harry's feet.
Draco held up his lit wand and looked at Harry, not sure where to take him first. He picked a wisp of spider web from Harry's dark hair, and flicked it off with distaste. He tsked and started off, blandly pointing out items of interest like a bored tour guide, though he was glad to see Harry avidly taking in the sights. Harry was like a child sometimes—he got excited by the damnedest things. Harry practically ran up the ludicrous amount of steps to reach the top of the castle. The wind had picked up and the rain slashed sideways in gusts, soaking them both regardless of their Umbrella Charms.
"Shut it, you." Despite his words, a smile played at the corner of Potter's mouth. Draco was captivated for a moment, basking in the rare gift of Harry Potter's unabashed amusement.
"I only just met you. I don't know your last name. And you could be a someone sneaky and underhanded trying to dig up dirt on me, either to sell for publicity or for some other reason."
Malfoy looked at him, obviously surprised at the question, which Harry hadn’t meant to blurt aloud. “I don’t know, Potter. Do I seem bored?”
"Draco gave me the address. He told me to keep an eye on you and then to escort you to Granger's thing. You were taking forever, so I decided to bathe. Great tub, by the way. You should get dressed. We're late." One hand gripped the edge of the tub and Harry had feared she meant to rise and expose the rest of her sudsy body. He'd fled to his room.
They had to fly more carefully once daylight had brightened their path, staying low and avoiding Muggle-populated areas. They halted once more, just past midday, to eat a brief meal that Harry had packed along.
Potter looked a fright. There were dark circles beneath his eyes and he appeared as though he had not even bothered to drag a comb through his hair after their activities—an idea that appealed to Draco no small amount. At breakfast he had blushed beautifully and shifted in his seat often. Twice Draco had caught him rubbing his wrists.
Harry's resolve was put to the test at dinner that evening. Draco was eating his pudding, although eating was a relative term, considering the way the bastard fellated his spoon with every bite. His eyes were fixed on Harry as his tongue slid over the metal and his lips turned red from the berries.
Potter's head jerked up and his wide eyes met Draco's. "Next time? You'll see me again, then? This isn't just a one-off?"
"I am not certain you deserve to breathe. Did you see the pack of sycophants surrounding Tanner? News that we're
“I find that even harder to believe,” Malfoy murmured and nibbled at Harry’s earlobe, biting it lightly while tracing the edge with his tongue.
"Oh." Salazar, what had he wanted with Potter? Even the vaguest idea escaped him. He needed to get out, go somewhere that he could think. "Nothing. Never mind, Potter." Draco strode to the door, intending to get back to the fireplace and flee. Potter caught his wrist.
Sent back to Denmark today to help with some cleanup on the nogtail case. Apparently the poachers spilled some information that Kingsley wants looked into. I was certain to send Malfoy a note this time letting him know I was going. He's brought it up that I left without a word last time pretty much every time I see him. At least I know he missed me, even if it was only because he needs someone to harass.
Sometime during the wee hours of the morning, Harry had concocted a plan to learn more about Draco by using his friendship with Mark. It had seemed harmless enough; Draco had shown that he had no intention of allowing anything beyond friendship to develop with Mark, despite their rather unorthodox meeting. What Harry hadn't counted on were Mark's growing feelings for Draco. He scowled and reached for the wine bottle to refill their glasses.
Harry gave a forlorn coo and Draco relented as he exited the library. "Well… maybe a tiny bit. You do seem to enjoy it."
Weasley indicated the stack of files, but before he could speak, Draco said, "I haven't been charged with anything. Apparently they found it necessary to force a confession out of me via Veritaserum rather than do any tiresome Auror work and dredge up some actual evidence."
"Malfoy." Potter sounded both perplexed and amused. "What brings you here to pound on my door so politely?"
Harry pulled a pillow over his face to try and block out the sounds, but he groaned, knowing that Eddie had no intention of allowing him to sleep any longer. He might as well get up and have the fight over with.
A week later, Harry was seated in Malfoy's lap, snogging the breath out of him, when the door banged open and Parkinson walked in.
Harry shot him a sidelong glance and then nodded. "I found some photos. Clippings. Things that weren't keepsakes or mementos. It seemed more like surveillance. But why would Eddie stalk me? We live together!  And he sells Quidditch supplies. He's not dangerous."
Harry nodded and pulled out two mugs before filling them with water. He'd been practicing Malfoy's spell from the day before and thought he'd be able to manage.
"Auror friends?" Harry asked, trying to hedge as warning bells went off in his mind. At her nod, Harry hedged. "I don't know. We haven't been working together long enough for me to ask him personal questions. We haven't always got along. It's been… difficult."
"Would someone like to tell me what is going on here?" Kingsley Shacklebolt entered with a billowing of official red robes. He was trailed by a tall, dark figure and Draco nearly sagged in relief.
Draco clucked his tongue. "Honestly, I'm here, am I not?" He held up his hands. "And look. I don't even have my wand. Your message was rather vague. Would you care to be more specific? And do we really need to do this here? I can think of a hundred better places."
Draco straightened and forced himself to don an emotionless mask. Obviously he was getting too close to Harry for comfort, if even Weasley was questioning his motives. "One does not need to organise a support group to acknowledge ability. If you wish to keep me safe, I would feel better with Potter here."
"We are likely walking into a trap," Draco said and strode with his usual confidence back to the main entrance chamber. He held the door open as the others entered the circular room. "Harry, open that door over there. Yes, straight across."
Maeve returned with a bottle and two goblets. She poured a glass for Draco and one for herself and then sat back to watch him eat.
"It could be any number of things, the most likely of which is information." Malfoy pushed himself away from the sink. "I will meet with him and let you know. Tell Shacklebolt and the others to keep their wands to themselves if they should happen across Pansy or Blaise out and about. I need them both and won't have them arrested for minor misdemeanours."
Draco made a sound of disgust. "You've been obsessing over this for months and now that I'm trying to help, you want me to quit?"
"We took Malfoy to a safe house. Got a message this morning that someone is coming for him. Kingsley took it serious."
Malfoy turned and walked away. Harry jogged after him, laughing. "We are not going to crash! I ride a motorcycle frequently at home and these are much easier to control. In fact, you don't have to wear the helmet, okay? We can't have it crushing your gorgeous hair, although the wind might do it worse damage."
"Similar, but not the same. With a Patronus, you are pulling forth your own happy memories and turning them into a tangible creature. With this spell, you can use something as simple as a sense of well-being, which is then magnified a thousand-fold."
. He knew what Potter had become—everyone knew. Next Potter would be ripping open a vein and drinking Draco's lifeblood. He had to be stopped.
Draco snatched it. "I admit the cock has potential. It looks brilliant, although you can see absolutely
"Brilliant. I believe I shall be ready to begin teaching in a couple of weeks." He rubbed his hands and looked around the place.
Hermione says it's been obvious for a long time that I was falling for Malfoy. Even Ron nodded and said the way we finish each other's sentences is creepy. I'm still pretty shocked that the idea of me and Malfoy together isn't freaking him out, but he says he's had time to process it since Valentine's Day. He just doesn't ever want to hear about us shagging. The thought of shagging Malfoy is pretty terrifying, to be honest, but in a good way. A very good way. I guess I've been in denial about how much I like him. Now I have to figure out how to let him know.
Ron had left his brothers' shop after breakfast and flown back to the encampment, hoping the others had not left. He was relieved to find the tent still standing and dropped his broom next to the other two before ducking inside. He'd expected to find someone in the living room, but it was empty. Ron heard a sound from the kitchen and discovered Harry tapping his wand against a teapot with one hand and yanking at his hair with the other. Harry seemed to be muttering and preoccupied. He did not notice Ron, who ducked out quickly and wondered where the hell Hermione had gone to. And
"Auror Malfoy," Harry said sharply, "would you like to share with the class?" As soon as the words were out, Harry could have
Hermione's otter patiently waited until he could see it before delivering the message. "Harry, I need to speak to you urgently. Please come to my office at the Ministry." It disappeared as Harry sat up and frowned. He wondered what he should wear, whether jeans and a t-shirt would be appropriate or if he needed to suit up in full Auror gear and return to active duty. Neither sounded appealing; he wanted to stay in bed with Draco.
Harry let out the breath he'd been holding. At least it wasn't a Troll, but how could it exceed expectations when the critiquer had no idea who he was, and therefore could have no expectations at all. He wrinkled his nose at his meaningless thoughts and reread the critique. He bit his lip at the
Weasley shot to his feet. "Anyway, if you decide to come, let us know!" Weasley leaped for the fireplace and was gone before Draco had the buttons undone.
Draco blinked after her for a moment and then went straight back to staring at the prize before him. It was a bloody masterpiece. He felt a moment of pure, unbridled anger at Mindy for having seen it--the charlatan, and he'd thought her so innocent and naïve--and then he went back to admiring it.
They passed the container back and forth for a while until the liquid was gone. Harry felt very pleasantly tipsy. When he put the flask away, his fingers brushed against a package in his pocket. He pulled it out.
Consuelo pattered up the steps before Harry could reply and served them tea and tiny bits of bread with multiple toppings, held together with small skewers.
Draco sighed and brushed a hand through his hair before primping it with his usual spell. "I don't know. I'm just tired. We didn't exactly sleep much." His silver eyes combed Harry's body, causing the slightest lurch in his breathing.
Harry took several steps into the gloom, wary of his cloak and taking care that it didn't rustle against the stone. Greyback, however, was making no move to be silent.
"So is Albus. James is seven and Lily is…" Harry frowned. Lily had been their last-ditch effort to recover whatever emotion had been slipping away between him and Ginny. The reconciliation had been short-lived, and Harry had been writing the whole time. "Lily is two."
"Like hell it wasn't. He'd still be there trying to knot his bloody tie. Where can a girl get a drink around here?"
Something was in Harry's hands; a disk of some sort. Draco got up and walked to the window, pulling up the twin chair to sit adjacent. He took the disk from Harry and turned it over. It seemed to be the plastic lid from a tub of lemon-flavoured yogurt.
Malfoy tipped his head back and looked at Harry through grey eyes that looked somewhat dazed, although his smile held the definite shadow of his old cocky smirk. "Potter?"
"I'll be fine, Potter. Go fetch your food and I will go and peruse your drink cabinet. I assume you have one?"
Gryphon nodded. "Draco only owls when he needs something. You've all been good about leaving me in peace. That's all I wanted after the war."
Draco stroked her feathers for a moment and then his silver eyes looked at Harry with a wicked glint.
Harry nearly spoke aloud and barely masked the words with a hoarse cry.  He clamped his lips shut and nodded in an exaggerated fashion several times.
"No," Malfoy said. Harry nearly groaned aloud at how bloody adorable he was. Evil Slytherin git be damned, tonight he was hot as hell, sexy, drunk, and obviously more than willing to spend some time getting to know Harry. Except that he wasn't Harry.
His current home was a mid-sized row of stone-fronted houses barely wide enough to accommodate a door and a single, tall window. Draco felt rather claustrophobic inside, especially with Blaise and Pansy both in attendance as they were currently.
Shacklebolt's voice was implacable. "We can't give in to terrorism, Mr Malfoy. Crabbe, cease this display at once. You won't get—"
Bloody hell, you're a sight! Hermione!" Granger threw herself at Harry and clung, nearly dislodging Draco, who held more tightly, refusing to be dislodged. He and Granger exchanged pointed stares.
Harry walked in and Draco threw Hermione a wicked glance before waltzing forward and planting a devastating kiss on Harry's lips. Harry stiffened in surprise, but it did not take long before his hands slipped up to curl in Draco's hair and his body molded itself to Draco's.
Harry felt six months of pain, loneliness and fear melt away at Draco's words, replaced with a radiant warmth and blissful contentment. He buried his face in Draco's neck and drank in the clean scent of his hair.
"What you don't know about me could fill Battelle's World Wizarding Museum in Manchester six times over," Draco said dryly.
Draco built a fire for tea and they sat across from each other with the flickering heat between them.
It came without warning—Malfoy’s mouth was suddenly there, lapping at his arsehole, sucking it for a moment, and then pressing inside.  Harry cried out and thrashed in his bonds, nearly yanking free of Malfoy’s probing flesh, except the grip on his arse was firm and Malfoy moved with him, shoving forward until his tongue was as deep as it could possibly go.
Malfoy used his wand to fill two mugs with water. A tap on the sides of each heated them to boiling and he dropped in a large pinch of loose tea leaves. He gave Harry a speculative look. "So. What brings you here, Mark?"
Harry looked at Ron, who stared back with a slightly alarmed expression for a moment, but Harry only laughed and said, “All right.” He shrugged and began to walk toward the Slytherins. The path had been enchanted to repel snow, so he was in no danger of slipping as the gravel crunched beneath his feet. The other Gryffindors trailed after him.
He cast the same spell and this time applied it to himself before bending his knees slightly. Keeping his left hand firmly on Harry's cock, Draco thrust himself gently into Harry from behind, delighting in the shudder of pleasure that rocked Hary's frame.
He smiled at Potter. "Given how closely it is tied to that Dark Lord nonsense, I am not surprised. I wouldn't have given it back." In fact, Draco would have snapped it into several pieces and burned them all, but he suspected Potter was far too sentimental to ever do such a thing. He straightened with a gasp and then launched himself from his seat. "What is
"We danced and then you escorted Draco home, but not before slipping me his address. Thank you for that, by the way. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to repay you."
," Malfoy said through what sounded like clenched teeth. Harry dared not look at his face to verify. "I'll walk you to your office."
Despite his need to tear the rest of his clothing off and wank, he resisted. There was something he needed to do, after all. Twenty minutes later, he decided the scene would have to do, and then he took off everything, grabbed an embroidered silk handkerchief (that had been a joke gift from George), and arranged himself carefully on the bed. With a grim sense of determination, he picked up his camera and his wand and set to work.
"Interesting segue. From small-talk to asking for a confession in one baffling statement. Well done, Potter. And no, I do not plan to confess. If you and your Ministry masters want me in Azkaban, you can work for it."
"How?" Hermione interrupted, obviously snatching at the subject change in relief. "I thought we might try—"
"Not all the time, of course. I can probably assist you with your silly inability to transform with your personal effects. Not that I have a problem with the nakedness portion…"
Mindy nodded. "Hot tea, right away. Yes, sir. You might want to open that envelope on your desk before hurling it, also. Just a suggestion." With those cryptic words, she fled.
Harry allowed a lascivious smile to curve his lips and he winked suggestively at Tanner as he said, "
"Granger?" he called loudly, hoping against hope that the former Gryffindor had managed to take out Chang on her own. It wouldn't have been that surprising, after all, even though Draco would be the last to admit that he thought Granger capable of such a feat.
"I'll help you," Harry offered casually, trying to control his excitement over the idea of having a moment alone with Draco. He accompanied Draco out and grinned at him in amazement as they strolled down the long hallway. "How did you do this? It's incredible."
Two more Apparitions took him to a place of safety, thankfully deserted, and he staggered through the place, ransacking it for healing potions. He finally located a large stash of them in a bathroom cupboard. The array was notable, and he thanked his lucky stars to find a Bone-Mending Potion along with several strong painkillers, and even a Blood Replenishing Potion. He took them all after weighing the side effects of combining them and decided that the risk was an acceptable alternative to suffering what he already felt.
"Any of them. I'll know where to go once we open it." With that, he walked to the nearest door and yanked on the handle. It opened to reveal such brightness that they all had to blink and cover their eyes in order to adjust to it. Once he could see again, Harry stood next to Draco and peered through to what seemed to be a large, open plain of grass, yellowed from heat, extending away into a great distance where a tiny jutting of mountains broke the horizon line. "Right, then. We need the third door to the left of this one. Go open it now or the room will spin again when we shut this."
Harry swallowed hard and took them up again, tracing a finger over the patterned lace. The thought of wearing them beneath his trousers was disturbing, but the thought of Malfoy
“Therefore, we have decided that this will no longer be a House-specific contest. We will henceforth divide up the teams. More details will be provided tomorrow. I suggest you go to your beds this evening and think about the concepts of unity and teamwork.”
Sometime later—still Christmas, but barely—Harry yawned and then blinked when Draco placed a small, wrapped box on his chest.
"You'd better have a damned good explanation for that," Draco growled. He took in the room with his peripheral vision; there wasn't much to see. They seemed to be in a small stone room with a single, thick wooden door.
A glance across the room made that seem a ridiculous impossibility. Astoria laughed and leaned close to Malfoy, swaying into him as though it were the most natural thing in the world. The silver gown she wore complimented her icy beauty and Malfoy's black robes. They looked amazing together.
He risked a glance at Hermione and saw a smile curve her mouth. Brilliant. He had passed. He relaxed into his chair and then remembered her earlier words. "Wait a minute, that doesn't explain why Parkinson was here."
Harry took a gulp of wine and tried to push away the image of Malfoy in someone's bed. It was not a bad image at all, and involved long, pale limbs, and blond hair falling over Malfoy's handsome face. Harry nearly groaned aloud and reminded himself that it had been too long since he'd been laid. His plans to sleep with Eddie had fallen through; Harry had been too tired and distracted to pursue the notion, and Eddie had been preoccupied with learning about his new product.
Harry had been gearing up for an argument, but Malfoy's lack of aggression left him with nothing to fight. He floundered for something to say, but could only nod and open the door again.
Harry tried forcibly to close his mouth, even using his hands, but the song refused to be bottled. His jaw continued to move even with his hands clamped over his lips, and it was loud enough to draw attention. Onlookers hooted with laughter. Dennis looked just as mortified as he sang along, words muffled by his own hands.
Teddy leaped to his feet and danced up and down. His hair changed colour every time his feet hit the floor. "Oh yes! Can I? Can I? Can I?"
Harry felt a twinge at that, but then he shook his head. "Why would Malfoy care about house-elf rights? Malfoy Manor is half-demolished. Abandoned."
Draco had skipped dinner in the Great Hall after sneaking to the kitchen to procure some berries and nuts for his bird. The house elves had supplied him with a selection of sandwiches, so he had eaten one before returning to the Slytherin common room to go through his trunk.
By the time they all felt confident enough to cast the bloody thing in the heat of battle, it was nearing dinnertime and they were exhausted. Harry sprawled on the hard floor, panting, and watched as Tim held a bottle in one hand and waved his wand through the tricky motions. They were using a Will O' Wisp as the "creature" and the poor thing had been bottled so many times it's floating bob was beginning to look erratic.
"I'm not supposed to kill you," Crabbe said in a conversational tone. "Not yet, anyway. Someone wants a word with you."
Harry had draped himself in several layers of the Auror Departments latest Disguise Charms, and now sported mussed dark brown hair and blue eyes. His glasses were his own, a nondescript pair of golden wire frames with delicate scrollwork near the hinges. They were his backup pair, as he preferred his sturdy dark frames for work. The scar that generally drew attention was gone, replaced by a shock of green in his hair. That had been Ron's idea. "Give them something to remember and they'll recall little else about you. It's great for going unnoticed."
"Try it," Draco said. They immediately cast an array of spells, none of which had any effect on the levers. "Nullification field."
“Come for me,” Malfoy whispered against his ear and Harry did—he probably would have without permission, but it was better, so much better, to do as Malfoy asked, because Malfoy was brilliant. He was a fucking
Vic picked it up faster than the others, and spent the rest of the time helping teach. Unspeakable Salt seemed made of patience; she went over the spell and explained the dynamics and theory behind it more times than Harry could count.
. Knowing there were no onlookers, coupled with the knowledge that Malfoy was willingly kissing him, and the astonishing fact that Malfoy preferred blokes... It was almost too much to accept. Malfoy’s lips were soft, and also sweet, as though he had been eating cinnamon candy. Harry’s lips parted immediately, seeking more of the elusive flavour hidden beneath the sweetness. His tongue pushed into Malfoy’s mouth, tracing over teeth and gums and then drawing sensual lines over Malfoy’s tongue. Harry wasn’t sure about his skill as a kisser, but judging by Malfoy’s response, he appeared to be doing all right.
"What is really bothering you about this? You know I love to torment your little friends—a fact of which they should be well aware. They can't trust me, as I'm certain you've warned them."
"Not only that, but I resisted mentioning that his friend Mark would much rather fondle a hard cock than squeeze these melons." She wiggled her breasts again.
"I wanted to see you," Harry admitted, somewhat heartened when Draco's hand did not go far; it dropped to the front of Harry's robes and toyed with the golden buttons.
Harry blinked at him. Magical theory was something he usually left to Hermione. She had been far too busy with house remodelling, and then with Ron's return and planning for Christmas, to do more than give Harry cursory assistance. And he had not burdened her with the case after she had dragged them to Muggle library.
Harry shot him a look and then led them through a dark warren of broken-down passages and ceiling-less rooms until he reached what might have been a cistern in the Dark Ages. He tapped a sequence of stones on the wall and the floor rearranged itself to reveal a stairwell.
Harry grinned, knowing Dean was partially right. They would all decorate according to their house colours. The Gryffindor girls already had their heads together, arguing over bells and bows.
Harry felt something turn into warm jelly in the region of his heart and he pushed Draco against the door and kissed him soundly. He dimly heard Ron squeak like a stomped rat, but he didn't care. The feel and taste of Draco was heady, despite the urgency to move on through the door and find Hermione. When Draco pulled away from the kiss, he said, "You owe me, Weasley, so I don't want to hear anything about it."
Hermione squeezed his hand, tucked the blankets around him more tightly, and then turned to Harry. "Where do we start?"
"Hardly silly," Harry replied as he followed Malfoy down the path. It seemed odd to walk on a perfectly dry walkway when the rain fell all around them.
Harry's mind slowly replayed the conversation and Draco's rich laugh rang through the room. "Congratulations, cousin," he said. Harry blinked at Tonks and she grinned.
She paused for a moment, wondering where they could have gone. She listened intently and finally heard the low hum of voices. Hermione saw a small path leading through a cluster of trees and pushed her way through until she spotted a clover-filled clearing similar to the one she and Harry had traversed earlier. She halted suddenly when she spied Draco and Harry lying on the clover. For a moment, she thought they were hurt and nearly rushed forward, but then she heard Harry's amused voice, though she could not make out his words.
Harry took a step closer and leaned in to whisper in Draco's ear. "I like your thighs, too. Especially when they are in between mine."
Harry's hand loosened almost reflexively and his body made an approving shiver, but then he tightened his grip once more. "Draco," he said warningly.
"You don't have to convince me, Potter." Draco turned back to his journal. He understood Potter's frustration with the tattoo case. Despite their somewhat promising interviews in High Ashbury, everything else had turned into empty corridors with no doors. Natasha Greene's great-aunt had been located in a graveyard in lower Kent. No living relatives could be found.
"Er, yes. Your camera." She looked at the others and then got to her feet. "Please gather round! I would like to take a look at your cameras. Did everyone bring one?"
"She's not exactly subtle, is she?" Hermione griped, bumping up against his shoulder as he sent a repentant smile at a spindly man nearly bowled over as Parkinson shoved past.
Frustrated anew, Harry returned to the ruins where Kingsley and the others were assessing the damage.
"That would have been the one I took of my husband," Mindy offered. Three pairs of eyes turned to her and she blushed red as a ripe apple. "I'll just go and fetch the tea!" With that, she turned and fled.
Harry shook out the card and then turned it over in his hand. "What does who want? This is blank. Was there another message?"
"I am not cynical. I am a realist. And yes, Blaise, please set up the bunting. Salazar knows this place could use some softer colours, although the lavender is going to clash horribly with this green. Perhaps we can remove this painting entirely? Or cover it with fabric? Possibly a banner announcing the purpose of this grand gathering?"
a freak. The only noticeable difference was that people gave him a wider berth. They still gawked, of course, at the scar, but now they also stared at his teeth.
Draco wished he had been. Anyone willing to hold a grudge against Lucius for untold years would have no trouble transferring that hatred to Draco.
"Fuck you!" Harry yelled back and then he was through the huge doors and making his way outside, cursing Draco Malfoy and his own overwhelming stupidity in believing the man was anything other than a complete arse.
." Harry still wasn't certain why Rosier had targeted Eddie, or more likely, Harry himself. Malfoy had only looked thoughtful when Harry had asked about Rosier's motive.
"Thank you?" he offered. The beast cocked its head and then turned slightly. Draco took the hint and unbound the package. Inside the wrapping was a shiny box decorated with a bright red ribbon. A card was tucked into the ribbon and Draco freed it before tugging on the satin.
"A safe house known to only a few of my most trusted staff. We got a message this morning that you were in danger, so I had Weasley and Finnigan bring you in."
He sprawled on the sofa and spent a few minutes arranging himself in a casual but sexy pose, growling at himself the entire time.
Harry stood, feeling awkward and wishing he could say something, but his tongue seemed frozen. What would he say, anyway?
Draco shrugged. "It is a bit. Oak is as much in abundance there as here, and I see your mother has the same affinity for atrocious floral patterns. Luckily my mother keeps the more tasteless fabrics in her room."
and he'd passed it to Harry instead of escaping. Harry's fists clenched reflexively. Why had he done it?
"Oh. I did see him practically climbing onto one of the waiters in there. I just figured he was drunk."
as a Malfoy? Are you referring to the obligation to marry a woman you dislike? The obligation to parade around like the perfect couple when everyone knows it's a farce? The
"To save my family and my home, yes," Draco replied. "I'll do whatever it takes. Even that." It was beyond humiliating, but the thought of losing the Manor induced such a vortex of panic that even the thought of touching Potter paled to insignificance.
With that, Draco went out and Harry returned to the library. Hermione was already surrounded by open books. Ron sat at a small table in front of a game of wizard's chess.
"It was acceptance, prat. I hope your mother doesn't—" Harry's words were cut off when Malfoy stumbled into him, nearly knocking them both over before Harry's got a grip on Malfoy's shoulders and braced his feet to stabilise them. "Oi, are you all right?"
Weekend at the Weasleys. I'm knackered from an impromptu game of Quidditch. Thank Merlin the Aurors keep me in top physical condition or I'd be no match for Ginny and George. Ginny plays professionally, but I have no idea where George gets his energy. Probably from some sweet he concocted. I suppose Malfoy is with Jacob right now. Ugh, why did I have to think of that? I'm going to sleep.
Hermione blushed furiously. "Well, it's unfurnished so, obviously, we won't need it any time soon!" Harry laughed. "
Pansy laughed at Draco with her best blank expression. Luckily, she was quite good at masking her emotions. Potter sighed, probably sensing he would get nothing from her. He turned back to Draco with a quick shuffle that put him a couple of steps away—back to the safety zone of dead air.
"Indeed. I suppose we should have given some thought as to how we are returning home. Is it too much to hope for public Floo access nearby?"
"Out." Harry tried to smile casually, but it was likely his tea-fuelled high made his grin too bright.
Harry would have leant in for a kiss, but his mind was whirling. "Bloody hell, are you saying that Cho has been behind all of this? The Fenrir thing, and Crabbe—what about Rosier?"
He lifted a brow at the bird, which cocked his head in that endearing manner and cooed. Draco suppressed a grin and got to his feet.
He froze, stilled by Pansy's tone. His focus shifted to her, and in the midst of everything else reflected on her face, he also discovered a placid resignation, something he'd never expected to see.
"Yes, Ronald, I will." She and Ron gazed into each other's eyes for a long moment before she shook it off and turned back to Harry. "See how easy that was? Now, go to it. And figure out what you plan to wear."
"Tell me something about yourself, Potter," Draco said as Harry sat next to him, not quite touching, and lifted the bottle. Draco held up his glass.
Harry walked carefully around the side of the bed, hoping to sit down adjacent the boy and calm him. He didn't want to scare the child by snatching him, and there did not seem to be any danger at the moment.
chat whilst you were out. Such a dear man, if a bit bull-headed and single-minded, and possibly a bit stiff and humourless. I wonder what his wife is like in bed. I'll bet she's not terribly adventurous. Have you traced the Polyjuice potion?"
Draco crumpled the message. His gaze shot to the Gryffindor table, but the Trio of Idiocy was giggling merrily at the antics of Finnigan, who seemed to take an unnatural delight in playing with his food. Immature louts, the lot of them.
"Not much up there, anyway," Ron said as they descended to the living room. Ginny was leaning against the back of the sofa. "Hey, Gin, where's Harry?"
"Potter! Malfoy!" Minister Tanner's voice boomed out and rang through the Atrium. "Are you fighting?"
The twins relaxed from their positions of preparing to throttle one another and George cocked a brow at Harry. "Why are you so keen to find Malfoy, Harry?"
"Fucking with his body?" Draco asked bluntly and let his eyes slide over Potter's tense form. His legs were long and lean beneath what had to be a perfect ass, although Draco could not tell because of the dark cloak. Draco smiled and imagined peeling those clothes away from that delectable body. "He is terribly hot, isn't he?"
Harry laughed aloud at Draco's growing bafflement. There was a good chance Draco would decline his invitation when he discovered what Harry had in mind, but Harry hoped his competitive nature would win in the end. He nodded.
"You did?" Harry and Zabini spoke as one. "When?" Harry added, wondering why Draco hadn't mentioned it mere minutes earlier.
Harry took the path and walked into a garden filled with roses of every colour and fragrance. He was nearly sidetracked by the urge to smell each one, but stopped only once to inhale the scent of a deep red version with blooms as big as dinner plates.
Harry Potter. Hysterical laughter threatened to bubble up and he choked it back with a groan. He heard a loud chirp and a ghosting of wings brushed near his hair before the bird fluttered away.
"Do you mind if we continue this discussion elsewhere? Either in the bedroom with fewer clothes or downstairs after I put something on? I'm getting cold."
"I was hoping you wouldn't make it through the Lever Room. I modified the floor to send you somewhere special. You would never have been found and that would have made things so much simpler."
Harry cringed, but pushed his legs out to the edges of the chair, which suddenly seemed to have a ridiculously wide seat.  His cock and testicles dangled.  Harry nearly yelped when he felt another slide of silk against his ankle as Malfoy looped it around and tied him securely to the chair leg.
, thank goodness, and he only sighed once before moving on to knead Draco's chest and shoulders, squeezing muscles strained by his earlier effort to free himself from the ropes. It felt so bloody good that Draco felt his erection ease a bit as he relaxed under Harry's ministrations. By the time Harry continued the massage on Draco's arms and hands, his skin was so sensitive from the salve that he thought he could feel air currents swirling in the room.
"It makes sense. I've tracked a number of recent payments to a corporation known as A.L.A.—I've no idea yet what that stands for—but so far I haven't had any luck in ferreting out whom or what fronts it. The A.L.A. Gringotts account receives a number of smaller payments trickling in from various sources, which leads me to believe that Rosier's backer is not a single entity, but is actually a collective. With that said, it would be a simple matter for Shacklebolt's people to locate and infiltrate them. Unfortunately for you, Granger, we haven't the time for that."
Draco frowned, obviously mulling the name over in his head and likely trying to match it to anyone he had ever known. At last he shook his head and turned away. "Tea, of course. A special delivery from Africa. I am thinking of blending it with the ginger, or perhaps a bit of rose." Draco chattered on and opened several jars of tea leaves. Harry did not bother to suppress a grin. Somewhere between the mind-boggling question the previous night (do you like cock, Potter) and Harry's early-morning wank session, "Malfoy" had become "Draco" in his mind and he couldn't seem to shake it. In fact, Draco's behaviour was only reinforcing it. The buttoned-up, public version of Draco Malfoy was gone and Harry much preferred this one, with his bare feet and casual jumper, and the relaxed smirk he sent Harry's way as he heated water without half trying.
Harry flushed. "I meant when you aren't doing… whatever it is you do as a criminal. The evidence in that regard is rather sketchy, as you might know. Do you plan to confess?"
He dodged a mirror that grew clawed hands from the frame and groped at him. Another gave him a fleeting glimpse of something so beautiful that he turned back, and then closed his eyes with sheer willpower. Only by biting his lip hard enough to draw blood did he shake the desire; once away, he knew he would have stood there for the rest of his life, admiring the deadly view.
Eddie beamed at him, eyes shining, and Harry felt like a heel for having doubts. "Brilliant! What do you prefer? Beach? Mountains? Romantic hotel and dancing?"
"All right. We'll leave at dusk. I'll get my things together and send owls to my friends to let them know where I'm going. It's the
Harry was stunned. He had gone through his own soul-searching at the time, and had spoken to no one but Hermione. She had encouraged him to follow his heart, and even then he had agonised over his decision, uncertain until the very morning he had Apparated in slow stages all the way to Tuscany, growing ever more sure with every leap, only to spend the rest of that terrible day and night waiting.
The sight nearly caused Draco's heart to explode, as well as his body, but he wasn't quite ready for it to end. He put his hands on Harry's hips to still his motion and pulled him down for a kiss. He loved Harry's utter lack of resistance to his kisses.
Later, wrapped in a towel, Harry dripped onto the mangled bedclothes and watched as Draco pulled on his white trousers.
"My mum brought me here once for some sort of history lesson, I believe. Back when it was safe to Apparate. As if I cared about Irish history." Draco laughed. "I think I was eight. I remember being bored out of my bloody skull."
Draco dragged him down onto the makeshift bed and pulled Harry atop him. His hands were hot on Harry's back. Draco was hard beneath him and suddenly there were still too many clothes between them.
"It doesn't matter. Mark seems content to be nothing more than a mate. He doesn't even ask questions." Draco shook off a twinge of disquiet and pushed all thoughts of Mark away. Now was not the time. "Pansy, you'll be happy to know that Roderick is done. I'll be sending him on his way to make room for his replacement."
The third iteration broke the spell and Harry bounded to his feet and ran to Eddie. His thigh was crimson, and blood pooled on the chair and spilled to the floor, marring the Moroccan carpet Eddie loved so well.
was a far larger risk than mere kissing. How far was Draco willing to go? Potter looked like a wild creature, full of leashed power and untapped energy. He would be gone tomorrow, and both of them would return to their predictable, perfectly planned lives. Draco would be stupid not to take this one chance, to have at least one thing that was solely his. He nodded.
Although he'd stopped kissing Malfoy, Harry hadn't stopped touching him, and he squeezed the taut muscles just above Malfoy's pelvic bone, dreaming of how they would feel with Malfoy stretched out beneath him. Or above him; he didn't much care which. "I don't want our first time to be leaning against a liquor cabinet with your tea and fancy bottles of whiskey at risk."
It was almost too much, as though his explosive release of lust had left a hole that only Draco was able to fill. Harry's kiss was desperate, needy, and altogether glorious. Draco's tongue licked at him, sending shudders of delight coursing through Harry's already super-charged nerve endings. His free hand clutched at Draco's shoulder, trying to pull him even closer. His other hand, still wrapped around his wand, was caught between them—Draco's hands were on Harry's waist, gripping just as tightly.
"Great!" Harry shot to his feet. "Merlin, I've got to get shopping! How about if I come back here at, say, seven o'clock? That will give you time to dress."
"Fine." The final gate clanged shut and Malfoy spelled the leather hoods into a small trunk and then slammed the lid. "Did you learn anything worth reporting, or did you just come all the way out here to annoy me?"
“Do you like that?” Malfoy asked and then a hiss warned Harry of the seventh blow before it angled over his arse. He jerked against his bonds and drove his cock into the mattress with a half sob.
Anyway, he said he had to hand it to Granger for keeping his name out of the official files, because it had bought him even more time to feed Jacob enough line to hang himself. Jacob was busy selling his potion-making ideas to his investors, using Malfoy companies buried (he thought) so deeply in a paperwork tangle that tracing them would be impossible, and operating under the assumption that the Malfoys would never find out. And if his activities ever came to light, he'd planned to blame Draco for all of it and pretend innocence.
Ron coughed and looked at Harry with a desperate roll of his eyes. Harry heaved a mental sigh. It was entirely possible the boy had been bitten, but as long as he was alive they would do their best to get him back safely.
Without warning, several of the dementors sprang forwards. Harry lifted his wand and his spell crackled straight at the nearest creature. He felt a surge of satisfaction as the dementor seemed to explode. That satisfaction helped to fuel the next spell and he magnified it accordingly. Draco's spell worked brilliantly. The creatures began to flee almost immediately, obviously sensing the destruction of their fellows. The other Aurors threw themselves into the fray, sending spell after spell sizzling after the dementors as they twisted and dove in the air.
Harry glanced at Draco and they both started towards the shape. When they got closer, Draco cast the spell before Harry could, ordering the dementor to call its brethren. Harry hoped the creature obeyed and had not learned to do otherwise from their previous encounter, during which one of their number had been lost.
"It isn't your fault and it isn't moral degradation, either!" Harry snapped, pushing himself out of bed and snatching another dressing gown.
"Problem?" she asked and set aside a long scroll she had been reading. She tapped it with her wand to mark her place with a glowing line. "Or did you just pop in to invite me to lunch?"
"Brilliant," Potter said and thrust his hips upwards whilst holding Draco's thighs tightly enough to leave bruises.
The view at night is spectacular. I could sit here for hours and watch the lights of the city twinkle next to the moon gleaming on the waves in the harbour. I don't feel myself at all here, and maybe that's a good thing. It's funny how being surrounded by metal, glass, and clean, cold lines can make one feel above petty human emotions. I stand here like an avenging statue, staring out into the darkness and wondering why emotion even exists. Britain seems very far away, and yet, when I concentrate, I can still picture Malfoy's face the last time he laughed at me.
Draco waved Lovegood away towards the kitchen. She tucked her wand into her hair and then wandered that way, multi-coloured skirts billowing behind her. Draco shook his head. She was still an odd duck.
She smiled at him wanly. "Yes, you did your job well, Harry. What he did to Lucius took root long before that fateful day. Lucius was never very good at Occlumency. The Dark Lord knew that Lucius' loyalty belonged solely to me and to Draco. He detested that, above all, and he used it to manipulate Lucius time and again. He hated every tender emotion and sought to stamp it out."
Lube!" A jar smacked into Potter's hand from somewhere and Draco tried not to be impressed with his wandless magic as Potter offered it to him.
Harry lifted his other hand away from the chair, but Malfoy snatched it out of the air.  A second tie secured Harry's other wrist and Malfoy sneered at him.  "Just a little added incentive for you to keep your hands where they belong.  Besides, it’s safe enough.  You can untie them with your teeth, if need be."
Ron threw up his hands. "I can't bloody stay here. If you insist on proceeding with this nonsense, you can stay here and…" Hermione raised her wand and Ron visibly switched the direction of his conversation. "…whatever. I'm going home."
"Note to Weasley," Draco said companionably and used a spell to clear a path, unwilling to risk another metal spike though his foot; it throbbed painfully with every step. "Never tie her up. It seems to anger her."
Harry nearly dissolved into laughter, but he kept tickling and managed to manoeuvre himself between Malfoy's legs, which suddenly whipped up and wrapped around his back. A swift twist later and Harry was the one flat on his back with a smirking Malfoy sitting astride him.
"I had a really long day. Thank you for dinner." Draco sat down and cancelled the Warming Charm on the plate. A delicious smell wafted up and he realised that he was ravenous. He ate carefully, trying not to bolt his food like a hungry wolf.
Draco shut his eyes then, lost in the building sensations. It felt so good when Harry did that—oh yes, that—
"Merlin, that might be it. You're smart!" Seamus gave Kay-Kay a slug on the arm. She didn't flinch, but gave him a sidelong stare of warning. He grinned.
Harry had never felt anything like it.  He sobbed and squirmed, unable to remain still as Malfoy stabbed at him again and again with his hot, wet, exquisite tongue.  Harry whimpered incoherently, over and over, and lost his grip on the chair, instead clinging to the ties with both hands, not caring when they cut into his wrists and pulled tight.  The binding around his cock kept him from coming and the torment seemed to go on forever as Malfoy licked and sucked, and worked his tongue in and out in of Harry’s throbbing hole with methodical Slytherin cunning.
"Um..." Harry had blurted, face flaming as he'd tried to think of an excuse for staring. "Spell to colour the light?"
The next song turned out to be a slow ballad, and Draco slipped on a stone and stumbled into Potter a mere two steps into it. Potter grabbed him tightly to keep them from falling, and then refused to let go. Both arms wrapped around Draco's neck, and Potter draped over him like a blanket. Potter's cheek pressed against Draco's ear and Potter's chin rested on his shoulder. Their torsos were molded together, and the skin-on-skin contact was nearly too much for Draco. He wanted to push Potter away nearly as much as he wanted him to stay.
"I have a confession, Potter." One dark brow rose. Draco flushed and looked away, biting his lip for a moment before plunging onwards. "I've been sleeping with your Muggle shirt. Because it smells like you." As soon as the words escaped, Draco wondered why the hell he had admitted them.
Draco flashed him a grin.  “I need to protect my hands, Potter.  Ten spankings nearly kept me from holding a quill.  You are the one requiring punishment, not I.”
"Not bad," Malfoy said and then chuckled when his knight galloped over to skewer Harry's bishop, who died after a valiant battle. "Just not quite good enough."
" Harry shouted, but Draco grabbed him and kissed him before he could finish his tirade. He was ecstatic. It had worked! Harry struggled in his arms, no doubt intent on berating him for being reckless and foolish and all manner of unpleasant Slytherin traits, but Draco simply kept kissing him until Harry could barely breathe and his eyes had that passionate, glazed look that always made Draco want to drag him straight to the bedroom.
things just to get to know you and you turned out to be even more amazing than I'd thought with your bloody tea and your laugh and your chess-playing and historical book collection and crystal vases and brilliant, gorgeous
"Auror Klein knew the risks when she signed up for this job," Shacklebolt said in a firm tone and Draco blinked at him in surprise. He'd expected Shacklebolt to be a hardcase, but never to the point of allowing one of his Aurors to die.
"This will always be home. I just never had much reason to stay before." Mark lifted his glass and took a drink. His eyes met Draco's over the silver frames of his glasses.
"Oh, I'll get in, Potter. You won't like it and it will take me a while, but I will get in." Zabini had a wild light in his eyes and Harry could picture him standing outside the door casting spell after spell and hammering away at the wards, preventing sleep in the best case, and waking everyone in a two kilometre radius at worst.
Harry leaned back into the delightful warmth and thought about waking up, but the dream was too enticing. A hand glided languidly from his shoulder over his bicep, down his forearm and linked long fingers through his. Harry's hand was lifted to curl under his chin and he felt a thumb trail slowly over the edge of his jaw.
Potter sprawled languidly over Draco and his hands finally ceased their motion; for a moment, at least, until the gentle stroking began once more. Draco chuckled.
Draco should have known. He touched his tongue to his lips. They still tingled where Harry had kissed him, titillated like the rest of his body. They tasted of vanilla custard. Draco knew he would never again taste or smell vanilla without thinking of Harry. He supposed that wasn't a bad thing.
"I would assume, as the Minister's Undersecretary, that you enjoy your position. I would expect that you prefer not to jeopardise that by behaving stupidly. Apparently, those assumptions are incorrect, are they not?"
Surprisingly, the question made her blush and her eyes went suddenly soft and… well, Draco-like, for comparison, although Harry doubted any of them would appreciate the association. He smiled.
"Mark my words, I will get that circle open and I will extract my prize." He turned to his men and made a curt gesture. "Go and round up everyone still breathing in this building. We'll have to see how many more agents his Ministership is prepared to lose before he's ready to hand over Draco."
She gave him an exuberant hug and Draco could not remember the last time he had seen her so happy. Potter had apparently been true to his word.
Harry shot him a sidelong glance full of suspicion. "Yeah, in order to fulfil your own sneaky agenda." He held up a hand when Draco straightened in an affronted manner. "Save it. You can make up some ridiculous story for me later. I look forward to hearing it, but right now we need to find Hermione."
"All my life, I think. We always ended up together at boring social functions. It was always Pansy and me with Vince and Greg. And later Blaise. We met him at Hogwarts, as his mother coddled him terribly as a child. He was rarely allowed out of the house."
"Oh. Oh! Anders and Shacklebolt want me to teach a course based on some of the techniques I learned at the conference! Me! Teaching a course! Isn't that amazing?"
Malfoy shrugged. Harry thought it looked unnatural on his frame, as though his usual grace fought such a common gesture. "I have nothing more, at the moment. But if a message should come for me, it might be wise for you to deliver it."
"Potter, I assure you, releasing me will be to your benefit at this point." Draco's eyes were intense and gleamed with amusement.
"Are they causing that?" Harry shouted to Malfoy, angling his broom towards the man until their knees touched. Even then, he could barely hear Malfoy's reply over the screaming wind.
Harry's mouth began to water. Dante's was a longer walk than most Ministry employees preferred, but it was well worth it. They specialized in chowders, stews, and soups that were the stuff of legend.
took them up through the darkness of the ceiling, where a trap door let them out into the ruined chapel once more. Harry had never been so glad to see the night sky. His eyes immediately sought for the constellation Draco, as they did each time he looked at the stars. He found it with a familiar sense of reassurance and then looked at the embodiment of the name, who stood next to him. Draco smiled gently.
Harry glared at him. "I can identify him. Believe me, I'll never forget that face after what he did to Eddie."
They lay quietly for time, locked in a sweet embrace. Harry's breath against Draco's collarbone was pleasantly distracting—wafting out in a steamy puff and leaving a chill when he inhaled. Hot. Cold. Hot. Cold. The timing slowed and Draco wondered if Harry had drifted off to sleep. Draco could not allow that, not after Harry had awakened every nerve ending in Draco's body again and made them dance with delight thanks to that damnable cream. Draco was wide awake.
Harry considered the card and decided against picking it up. He took one from the deck instead and made a petulant moue of disgust as he tossed it onto the discard stack. A useless six of clubs. He should have taken the two.
Harry shot to his feet. "All day? What the hell, Draco, can't you even take care of yourself?" He stomped off to the pantry and began to pull out all manner of foodstuffs. Draco could only watch him with a fondness that bordered on something dangerous, something he hadn't felt in a long, long while. At the moment, he didn't even care to rein it in. "What do you want? I have bread, of course, and potatoes, and some weird rice that Hermione bought—how do you even cook rice—and this box of… What is this? Never mind. I have sausages and potatoes… some seasoning. Spaghetti and soy sauce, okay, no, that sounds terrible. Um, let's go back to the sausages and potatoes idea. And I still have eggs. You know, I could go and fetch take away…"
Harry pushed a hand through his hair, knowing Malfoy was right on that account. This was Hermione's life-blood. She would not step away easily, if at all. He frowned and looked at Agatha, who was carefully pouring liquid back into the tiny blue bottles. "What is Agatha doing, anyway?"
Harry detached his lips and slid down to remove Draco's boots and then made short work of his own. Next he tore off his jeans and briefs before slowly unfastening Draco's belt. Draco lay still, watching him. His pale body and platinum hair gleamed in the moonlight like a priceless work of art. Harry thought he'd never seen anything quite so beautiful, and more precious now than he'd ever been before.
Harry carefully slipped off the last of Draco's clothing and paused for one final appreciative glance before dropping to his hands and knees to crawl between Draco's legs. Harry lowered himself until his chest pressed against Draco's erection. He slid upwards, trailing his body over Draco's hot shaft in a languid movement, relishing the velvet feel of it against his skin. Draco groaned and tucked his hands into Harry's hair.
They glared at each other and the old animosity reared its head with an almost calming familiarity. Annoyance was easier to deal with than the confusing attraction Harry had been experiencing lately.
I suppose I should mention the case, since I spent the past two days rambling about Malfoy. I won't be doing that again. Teague's tip led us to the home of a repeat offender named Skein. Malfoy says he has familial ties to the Lestranges, which doesn't necessarily mean anything, but might point towards a passing familiarity with anti-Muggle sentiment. Skein's house in Tweed was empty, but there was definite evidence of recent occupation, albeit disgusting, rubbish and rat-infested occupation. I spent 48 hours staking out the place with Winston and Malfoy, until Kingsley ordered me to go home and get some bloody sleep. Which I plan to do right now.
Draco's grin returned and he tsked as he turned away and headed for the entrance. "Such scepticism! I could drown in it!" He gave Blaise a jaunty wave and went to meet his fate.
Before the meal started, McGonagall stood up and banged her glass with her wand for attention. The room quieted and stared at her.
"Oh, that sounds interesting," Arthur said and Draco could not determine if he was serious or not. Draco gravitated towards a far corner of the room, pretending interest in a framed painting on the wall that looked to have been made by a child’s handprints.
Draco ruffled Harry's hair and sighed heavily. "She'll never leave if I don't allow her to harangue me. I'll get rid of her and then we can go back to sleep."
"You have no idea." She nodded. "It's always 'Draco this' and 'Draco that' until I actually throw something at him. It's useful to keep a Bludger on my desk, I've noticed. I sometimes think he's a bit hung up on you."
Rather than pointing out the fact that Blaise had been the one wanking, Draco allowed his shoulders to slump as he hitched a half-sob. "You're right," he said, spinning the words into a high tone dramatically, "I'm a terrible person." He stood and walked quickly to the fireplace. "Forget I was here."
Despite his shout, he did not release the headboard, so Draco took pity on him and licked a stripe up Potter's cock, earning a tortured-sounding intake of breath.
Draco was curious how the Veritaserum would handle that one. He couldn't suppress a slight relaxation of his shoulders when he replied, "No." He
Potter's eyes, wide and green even without the magnification of his glasses—fallen to the floor some time previous—bored into Draco's and then he made a single, sharp cry and arched beneath Draco.
Harry and Hermione sat on the sofa and waited. None of them spoke again until Gryphon returned with a huge ceramic tray covered in tiny teacups and a steaming pot of tea. She sat down in the last remaining chair and poured tea for all of them. Harry took his cup and held it carefully. The porcelain looked especially fragile.
Draco levered himself away from Harry and went back to his balcony vantage. Harry partially sat up and braced a hand on the bed. "You know, there
"Maybe you should get Granger to help you since she's going to fix everything else that's wrong with your
"Of course. I should like to shake yours, also. That was a brilliant game against Austria. Well played."
Maeve sat back with a delighted laugh. "Well, well, well. The apple really doesn't fall far from the tree, does it?"
“Spread your legs,” Draco ordered.  Potter’s feet were somewhat tangled in his pants, but he kicked them away obediently and spread his knees, giving Draco a clear view of his perfect little arsehole.
"Hold up, Malfoy!" Harry cried. "Sorry, guys, I'll catch up later!" He slipped through the closing doors, causing them to spring open again.
"Do you think it worked?" Harry called to Draco, who hovered next to him. The spell had sent a mental command to the dementor, ordering it to call the others.
An arm curved around Harry's waist and tightened until he had difficulty drawing a breath. "Come along,
He felt half-starved, so after divesting himself of all extraneous materials, including his borrowed wand, he went into the kitchen and cut several large slices of bread. After topping them with cheddar, he toasted them (only burning one due to the unfamiliarity of the wand) and wolfed them down, gulping pumpkin juice straight from the bottle and hoping Eddie wouldn't wake up. He hated it when Harry didn't use a glass.
In the hallway, he ran straight into his nemesis, who seemed to have planted himself in the way just for that purpose.  Harry could not suppress a gasp as he found his chest pressed hard against Malfoy’s.  To his astonishment, a hand reached under his robes to firmly grip one arse cheek and squeeze.
"As far as we can tell, the symptoms are identical, as was the sudden onset of their conditions. One moment they were walking, the next they were prone and had no brain activity."
"I love your hair," Draco said thickly. "I love your lips. I love your body. God, I love you, Harry."
Draco woke to the feel of a warm body pressed tightly against his back. An arm crossed his ribs and his buttocks were nestled in the curve of someone's groin.
Mindy hurried over and helped him to repair the glass and clean up the spilt alcohol before pouring him a new beverage. By then, one of the others had gravitated to Harry. She was a tall woman with wavy blond hair that tumbled to her waist. One lock was vibrantly orange and it matched the t-shirt she wore. It said CRUSH and Harry wondered idly if she was a Cannons fan.
Draco moaned when Harry twisted his wrist and then sent one hand questing lower to stroke over Draco's testicles.
"Crookshanks, yeah. I think I still have a few hairs on my trousers from him rubbing on me this morning." Potter reached down and brushed at his calves. "So you didn't learn anything useful from Rosier?"
"Do not fear. I am sure that Mr Draco will teach you." She laughed again and gave him a sidelong stare before quickening her pace and leading him deeper into the house. It was so enormous that Harry feared he might not find his way out again. Expecting to end up outside, he stopped short when they reached a gigantic room that contained a pristine pool. The outer wall was a solid bank of windows that looked out onto a grassy sward and a hedge garden.
,” although Draco doubted he even knew what he begged for.  Quivers rocked Potter’s body with every teasing movement.
He couldn't. It was nearly midnight and they both had classes the next day. Besides, Potter had promised he would return.
Harry pulled Draco close, using both fists bunched into his damp shirt. He spoke decisively. "Draco, I am going back on active duty. I don't want to stop being an Auror."
Two Ministry officials were talking with Rosier and Draco sidled near enough to overhear them discussing the rain, a familiar, if dull, topic. He moved closer to Wells-Barton's wife, who looked as though she would rather be anywhere else on earth.
Harry's eyes narrowed. A rogue Death Eater. "Is this for revenge, then? Payback for killing your precious Dark Lord?"
"I love it when you look at me like that," Draco said huskily and his lips parted to show brilliant white teeth.
Of course I was bloody irritated. "All along? You knew ALL ALONG?" I may have shouted at that point because he gave me one of those frowns that make me feel about five years old, even though I was perfectly justified with the shouting thing, thank you very much. Anyway, he replied with, "Of course. I wouldn't date someone so boring in the sack without a very good reason." I may have gaped at him for a few minutes after that, because picturing Malfoy in the sack with Jacob--well, frankly, I was just picturing Malfoy naked and that was quite enough to make me forget most of the rest of the meal.
"That's very philosophical of you, Draco. But then, I never thought of you as stupid." The voice belonged to Cho Chang and they all froze and turned towards the sound. Draco skirted a number of mirrors, wending through the maze with the others on his heels. He stopped when he reached an open area and spotted Hermione Granger's reflection. She had been strapped to a mirror, tightly bound with ropes both magical and ordinary. A tight gag covered her mouth.
"Drowning, I think." His voice was quiet and subdued—so utterly un-Malfoy-like that Harry looked at him sharply. The proud shoulders were slumped and rain dripped from the tips of his nose and chin into his lap, unnoticed. Something was obviously bothering him.
"I wondered if you would stand out there all day," she said. Draco studied her curiously. She was tall and slender, of indeterminate age, though he would place her in the same realm as Remus Lupin or his parents. Her hair was dark red, only lightly shot through with grey, and she had bright green eyes and a pleasant smile. At the sound of her quiet accent, coupled with the vegetation he had trekked through for the past few hours, Draco knew where he was.
Harry would deal with that problem later. For now, he just wanted Draco upstairs in his room—and in his bed.
Potter growled, released the bars, and reached up to drag Draco into a kiss, curling his hand into the hair at Draco's nape. He seemed to enjoy touching Draco's hair and he acknowledged that he had no problem with that whatsoever.
Draco yanked the sliver of wood out of Weasley's leg and tossed it aside. Blood seeped from the wound, but did not gush, thanks to his preventative measures. He sent a spray of water into the wound and it caused Weasley to moan and thrash even in his unconscious state. A Severing Charm removed a length of Weasley's Auror robes and Draco cut them into strips—ragged and uneven thanks to Weasley's wand fighting him every step of the way. Draco cast as many Healing Charms as he could remember, which helped to slow the bleeding, but had little additional effect on so severe a wound. They weren't as efficacious as they could have been. Using Weasley's wand was an exercise in patience.
"Well, she pours the contents of twenty bottles into the bowl and adds vodka, increasing the potency and the soporific effects of the potion by nine percent. And then she refills the old bottles, plus an additional twenty, and sells them to apothecaries. We purchase the original Pepper-up wholesale in bulk quantity, and procure the vodka directly from a renegade manufacturer in Russia for a song. It's a real money maker." Malfoy sounded genuinely pleased.
"Not at all," he acknowledged, but he wondered. Maeve was a witch's name, although he was certain that Muggles were not exempted from using it.
"Virgil was a trifle over-obvious and eager. I am surprised you used him, frankly. You should have known his hatred of me would make him sloppy."
Just then, Draco entered the room, unmistakable even from where Harry lurked. Hermione smirked. "Told you," she said smugly.
He joined the circle just as the magazine was changing hands, so he paused to look down at the photo, curious. His jaw gaped open and the blood thudded in his ears so loudly that it drowned all other background noise, including Seamus. He struggled to focus and clenched the magazine in both hands.
The bird turned in a stiff half-circle until he faced away from Draco, an obvious sign of disdain. "They don't make blankets for birds," Draco said sharply. Harry made a barely audible sound that was most likely bird-speak for sarcasm.
Harry sighed in frustration, knowing he was beaten. "All right. I'll see you by the end of the week. Be careful," he added quietly.
"You are gorgeous," Draco murmured and took Potter into his mouth so far he had to open his throat to take it all. Potter moaned in a way Draco had never heard before, and his sense of triumph redoubled. He concentrated on Potter in earnest, holding him steady with a gentle grip on his hips. The hands in his hair twisted until Draco winced.
"Now you're mine," Draco said and let his fingers trail from Harry's ankle up over his calf to curl around his knee. "All mine."
"It's similar to a Memory Charm, but we're not trying to modify your memory. We're merely trying to recreate it in detail and observe it."
"Why, hello! Are you an Auror? What do you think of the Wasps chances in the World Cup next year? We all stopped in to see the Minister and ask for his support to bring the World Cup to Wimbourne, but he wasn't in today. Isn't that a pity?"
"No, I went over some of those papers Harry gave me yesterday. There are some notes I don't understand. They appear to be written in Greek."
Harry fairly gnashed his teeth in frustration. The bastard had brought Harry to the brink of exploding with need and now he planned to just drop off to sleep?
Harry lifted his wings and stepped from one clawed foot to another. He gave Malfoy a disdainful look, something raptors were exceedingly skilled at.
Harry laughed at the strange toast. "To clarity!" he echoed and clinked his glass against hers. They drank together and then Harry nearly choked on his drink because another head of blond hair caught his eye and this time it was directly above a pair of smirking grey eyes.
Draco sat on the floor with a huge book propped on his lap—his back rested against the bed. Hermione was practically breathing in Draco's ear as she tried to read the book he held. She was tapping the book with her wand and giggling. Draco rolled his eyes, but he had an amused grin on his face.
Draco lifted his head and observed Potter's half-lidded eyes and wet lips still curved in a smile. Bloody hell, Draco had nearly forgotten how much he loved sex. He loved kissing and touching, the taste of a lover's body and the scent of sweat and hot breath. He couldn't quite believe how much
Draco pushed open the door to the warehouse and frowned when the movement kicked up a stir of dust that settled over his Italian loafers. He wondered why the suspicious sorts always chose to meet in the grimmest of surroundings. What would be wrong with meeting in a charming, private gazebo such as the one in Magnolia Park? It was sheltered from the weather and absolutely beautiful in early summer. And there was no dust.
"Poor little birdy," he said aloud and then made his own frowny face because it sounded faker than Pansy trying to convince Blaise that she hadn't sucked off that nerdy Ravenclaw sixth year under the Quidditch stands last Tuesday. He tried again using the wheedling tone he turned on his mother whenever he wanted something particularly expensive. "Poor little helpless birdy. Don't worry, Draco is here. I will take you back to the dorm with me. I will pet you and pat you and feed you ridiculously costly food and I will call you..." He paused and tried to think of a suitable name for something with a brain the size of a shriveled pea. He smirked. "I will call you Harry."
Draco went back to kissing him, willing to let their libido ease off. He wanted more, although he wasn't completely certain how to go about it. "Do you have lube?"
He snatched at the wooden box on his desk and began to sort through the photos. Something was tickling at his memory. Something familiar.
Harry gaped at the unmoving Unspeakable, and then hurried after Draco, who had opened another door and walked through. They didn't move far into the next room, mainly as it took them several minutes of blinking to adjust to the sudden brightness. Multiple, gleaming torches lit the long, rectangular room before them and Harry felt a sense of disquiet as his vision focussed on the objects decorating the huge space.
"Your horrifying experience of kissing Cho Chang will remain locked away to terrify you in private," Draco added.
Harry's breath caught. "It changed?" He cast his mind back to the battle, but could not recall Draco using any Patronus Charms. All of his spells had been Stingers or Dementor Death.
"Look, Malfoy—" Harry's eyes were on Malfoy's wand. It was new, of course, since Malfoy's old hawthorn wand resided in Harry's old school trunk, shoved away in the attic at Number 12, Grimmauld Place. That one would never bow to Malfoy's will again; Harry would make certain of that. This new one, however, was a curiosity. The wood was very pale, almost delicate-looking, straight and unadorned but for a green leather grip wrapped in silver wire.
The chest of Harry’s benefactor nearly crushed his as they waited it out. Someone had obviously sabotaged the Hufflepuff display. Their Glittering Golden Gumdrop Garden had been filled with magical sweets of all shapes and sizes, including a huge, yellow-clad gingerbread army. The last time Harry had seen them, however, they had been quite lifeless and not at all inclined to run amok.
Draco turned his head but his body had begun a slow spin in the opposite direction and he couldn't see the newcomer. He could only hear footsteps on the boards. Crabbe's other minions had retired elsewhere, clomping down a set of stairs and disappearing either downstairs or back to their respective homes.
Had she staked him out for the wolves? Not that any self-respecting wolf would eat a human unless they were starving to death. If there were any wolves left in Ireland. More likely she had just left him for dead. But why?
Draco grinned wickedly at the memory and his gaze warmed when he looked at Harry, who blushed as if on cue. Draco nearly laughed aloud. Hermione's sharp gaze passed from one of them to the other, but Draco doubted even she could put those limited clues together. He could see her filing it away for future reference before turning to Harry.
There was no way of telling which of the submissions had belonged to Seamus. Harry could only comfort himself with the fact that there had been no Outstandings at all since they had drunkenly decided to send their cocks in for evaluation.
"All right, bird. I mean Harry. Wake up, now." Draco prodded the avian creature with his index finger and then sighed and stroked the pale feathers of its tiny head. After a few moments the animal twitched and opened its eyes. It exploded into sudden motion, fluttering into the air with a startled chirp. Draco watched in amazement as it bounced off the canopy, careened into the curtain, and spun back to the bed to lie in a crumpled heap.
"It was not particularly difficult to determine your identity. I am curious, however, as to why you have pursued me so relentlessly. What have I ever done to you?"
Hermione gave him a stern look. "Stop it, Ron. It's Christmas. Ginny was very supportive, so the least you can do is stop caterwauling."
"I was wrong, Potter. This party is astounding. And I believe I've gained enough blackmail material to keep me rich well into my octogenarian age."
"You should get on the bed so that I may properly punish you for lying to me," Draco said as he pulled his mouth from Potter's and then placed languid kisses along the side of his neck, following it down to the muscle above his collarbone. Draco bit him, just hard enough to draw a gasp, although the way Potter arched into him and his hardening cock jerked against Draco's, Draco thought it likely he didn't mind the gesture.
Draco gave him a sidelong look. "They say it's cathartic. Confession. Good for the soul and all that. If I have a soul left after everything I've done."
Harry flushed and nearly voiced a denial, but Draco's words left him with a rush of warmth anyway, so he said nothing and sucked down Draco's cock again, moving more slowly this time and working his tongue along the length as he did so.
Draco stepped out of the Floo with little more on his mind than the hope of seeking out a strong drink and a soft bed. Harry Potter's stormy expression quelled his anticipation of both, at least for the near future.
It wasn't until Harry was halfway back to Level Ten that he realised he'd issued orders without even thinking about it.
Maeve stepped up again and this time she tucked the dagger into her belt. She raised her wand once more and began an incantation. Draco felt power begin to gather and was reminded of Harry's odd ability. He decided to try the same thing and cast out his senses for whatever intangible thing caused magic to work. It had seemed simple for Harry, despite the aftereffects.
"I don't know," Harry admitted. "I asked for copies of the Azkaban employee files, but we won't have them for a couple of days at the earliest."
Potter took his hand and they walked back to the scooter. Draco wrapped his arms around Potter's waist and held tightly as they wove through traffic and cut through side streets until they reached a large hotel that was more upscale than Draco had expected.
, if the very thought of it wasn’t hotter than hell. Malfoy’s hand wrapped around his cock and the mere touch had Harry’s balls tightening up.
Harry considered it, but it seemed too simple and easily fixed. They needed something bigger. They had to think outside the box. They needed to think like… like George Weasley.
He thought back to the Quidditch Gala and recalled Roderick Montoya flirting with everything that walked. Too bad Harry hadn't been Mark that night or Montoya might have tried something and ended up with more than he bargained for. Harry sat upright with a gasp, thoughts spinning. Bloody hell, it would be insane, but it just might work. Draco needed to see that Montoya was a faithless cad and he also needed to remove Mark from any "potential" list he might have lying around. It might just be possible to kill two birds with one stone. If Draco caught Mark and Montoya together, he would despise them both.
Harry considered the ramifications. Malfoy was wandless, so even if he managed to somehow subdue Harry and escape the room, there was no way he would get out of the Ministry. The lifts had been warded against him and Apparition wasn't possible from most of the lower levels. Harry shrugged and flicked his wand to release the magical shackles.
Harry continued the pattern until Draco's hot gasps of pleasure made him reach for his own hard erection, but Draco's hands tightened in his hair and dragged him upwards. Harry winced, but kissed Draco hard on the lips before Draco murmured, "Fuck me, Harry."
"Yes, I was quite shocked, but you probably owe your life to the fact that Dennis didn't want to kill me, which is why he only cast a Stunner. He was not holding back on Goyle."
when Harry was in danger. It was a curious thought. "I saw you cast one, though. Glad you finally found a happy thought."
Harry's brain felt stuffed with knowledge. He hadn't learned so much since leaving Hogwarts. In fact, he hadn't learned so much at Hogwarts, or at least it seemed so, and he would never admit such a thing to Hermione.
Malfoy looked around with exaggerated care. Brad, the barkeep, placed two Firewhiskeys on the bar before them and winked at Harry before heading off to supply the rest of the house.
"I'll stop speaking, then." Potter returned his mouth to Draco's navel… and then blissfully lower. His deft fingers removed Draco's trousers as quickly as he had unbuttoned the shirt, making Draco wonder if he had lied about losing his wand when he transformed. "Um… what do I do now?"
Draco went back to Harry, who leaned his way. "I've never seen you chummy with Seamus before. What's up?"
"Draco will teach you the spell," Harry said briskly, face flaming when he recalled his own experience with that. His gaze darted to Draco and then away, but Draco was expressionless. "It's powerful, so be careful where you aim it."
"What do you mean? He seems fine. Are you two having issues?" Hermione frowned and waited, but Harry couldn't put his suspicion into words, especially when he had no proof other than a handful of photos and some newspaper clippings. "I mean, we thought you were moving a bit fast when you moved in with him, but since you seemed happy enough, I supposed it was fine. I've never sensed anything
After dinner, the Lupins withdrew to their room—actually, Harry had given them the entire third floor—and Harry took Ron and Hermione up to the fourth floor, for once thankful that the five-story house had a multitude of bedrooms to choose from.
"How long do the effects of this bloody ointment last?" Draco asked and quickly added, "Not that I mind shagging you all night long…"
"If you ever bottom, we'll prepare you much more thoroughly, but for me I would simply like to feel you as quickly as possible, so that's quite enough." Draco's words felt somewhat abrupt and bossy, but the expression on Harry's face and the gentleness of his hands had been heart-wrenchingly adorable, and Draco couldn't deny the fact that with every small touch that Harry's invisible bonds were wrapping more firmly around Draco's heart.
Malfoy came into my office this morning and apologised for being an arse. He even brought me a treacle pastry and a cup of tea. I suspect he's up to something, but he left before I could call him out. Okay, weird, Malfoy's owl just showed up with a note asking me to lunch on Friday. I can't believe I'm waffling on this. I should say no and let things get back to how they were, but I actually miss spending time with him. I wish we'd never gone to that stupid party.
"Thanks, Professor." Harry trotted down the spiral steps and made his way outside before sending his Patronus to find Neville. An answering Patronus guided him to a grassy bowl near the Quidditch pitch; a low roar from the stands indicated that a match of some sort was in progress. To Harry's surprise, Neville stood next to Blaise Zabini. Roderick Montoya was sat on the ground before them, arms clasping his knees whilst he rocked back and forth. Tears wet his cheeks and a steady stream of Spanish flowed from his lips.
What the hell is Malfoy doing working on a Sunday? I expected him to be in his house slippers reading the Daily Prophet while eating fancy crumpets or something, not looming over my desk demanding updates on the case. I shoved everything into a box and Levitated in into his chest, nearly knocking him arse over teakettle. The look on his face was good for a laugh, at least.
"I…sure." Draco drank also and then they were silent for a long time. Harry debated getting up, but he didn't want it to seem like he was running away. And then Draco said, "I had a good childhood. A bit lonely, but good. My parents gave me nearly everything I wanted."
He followed the sound of the snapping wood and barely stopped himself from gasping aloud when he caught sight of Fenrir Greyback breaking a large branch with a spell. A collection of wood hovered in the air next to him and, as Harry watched, the branch he worked with broke into three pieces and topped the pile.
The gesture was more of a lover's caress than the angry touch of an enemy. It was enflaming. Harry guided Malfoy backwards, step by step, until Malfoy's shoulders pressed against the wall of the lift. The his own hands did some seeking. His fingers moved over Malfoy's arms and shoulders, and then farther up until they reached the bare skin of Malfoy's neck. Malfoy made a quiet sound into Harry's mouth.
in a repeating litany. Without thinking, Harry lifted his wand and cast a Locking Charm on the door.
Malfoy actually smiled, a genuine smile that seemed to light his grey eyes from within. Harry nearly stopped walking at the sight of it. "Pity," Malfoy said.
"No! I had already decided that you couldn't see Mark again. I was kind of hoping I could take Mark's place, but as myself."
"I don't think I can move," Draco commented as Harry released his hands with a flick of his wand before tossing it towards the edge of the bed. Harry laid his head on Draco's chest and sighed happily when warm arms surrounded him.
Malfoy smirked as Harry stared at him, completely flummoxed. Malfoy's lips cracked into a smile, but it quickly faded. "Impressive, isn't it? It took me weeks to perfect it, especially in defiance of the words I had to speak." He shook his head and his hair whipped over his eyes for a moment. Malfoy lifted a hand and pushed them back. Harry thought he could use a haircut, even though the look was disturbingly attractive. "It's not real. It's an Illusion Charm.
request, I might add—then perhaps she is not as in love with Weasley as she ought to be." He raised a hand to halt Harry's outburst and continued, "And if Weasley does not know the proper way to keep a woman, I'm sure as hell not going to enlighten him, nor feel bloody sorry for him when he can't!"
"I did it for money, all right? I was up to my bloody neck in gambling debts. I lost a mint on the last World Cup and Notus would have happily used my innards for braces. Cho saved my arse, as long as I did as she asked. It wasn't difficult, I just had to keep an eye on Harry and report his activities."
“Merlin, Potter, how you look right now…” Malfoy’s voice was barely audible and Harry raised his head and looked over his shoulder, but Malfoy was already moving away. Harry felt a moment of panic, thinking Malfoy meant to leave him, and then mentally kicked himself, because his wand was still in his hand. He could release himself and leave at any time.
"Hey," Eddie whispered and raised his hand. After a few moments of groping in the air, Harry caught his hand and held it tightly.
The chair next to him dragged on the wooden floor with a squeal and he focussed on Harry's feet as he sat down next to him. His voice was soft. "Then tell me."
Draco exhaled, a soft sound that might have been an attempt at humour. "By all rights, I should have become even angrier. My petulant, cooped-up, adolescent rage was a child's tantrum compared to the white-hot fury that I felt that day. I knew that
Draco Flooed straight into Potter's house. He barely took in the décor before stomping out of the room and into a small kitchen, also empty. Bloody hell, if Potter wasn't home, Draco would be tempted to burn the damned place down.
Hermione's lips thinned, but she simply nodded and took a seat in a wing-backed chair.  Ron sat next to her, looking green and almost lost.  Parkinson dragged a stool across the room and then Transfigured it into a divan of Slytherin green, giving Hermione an ugly look of satisfaction at her success.
Ron nodded. “All right. I’ll let Hermione know. She might faint to know you’re fixing your homework.” He snickered.
Malfoy smiled at that, faintly, but it was there. "As you wish." Before Harry was ready, Malfoy spun, crouched, and cried, "
Parkinson sank into a soft-looking chair and nodded. "Greg did a lot of soul-searching after the war. She seems much happier now."
Harry coughed. "It was fine, really. Although it wasn't really necessary to send her as a bodyguard. And how did you get past the Fidelius, anyway? That's really disturbing."
Harry blushed a little, remembering. His sex life had been nearly non-existent and then in one single night he'd made up for what seemed years of abstinence, with hopefully more on the horizon.
Draco's hands drew downward and grabbed his hipbones to pull him closer. Harry's tight ass felt fantastic against Draco's hardness.
A locked cupboard held most of Draco's camera equipment. He'd been using it more since opening the studio, oddly enough. He had expected his only clients to be the few taking his classes, but he'd had several requests for portraits in the past week, although he'd been willing to chalk those up to morbid curiosity.
Rosier edged into the light, hanging back so that Draco could just make out the dark point of his wand, held in his right hand. "Don't try anything stupid."
So Harry had let him go. That had been four agonizing months ago, the worst winter of Harry's entire life.
Harry heard a breathy female voice call Draco's name, but further commentary was cut off by Mulciber's chuckle. Harry's eyes narrowed on Draco.
"Don't start already!" Harry snapped. The front door opened again and Ron Weasley sauntered out, looking extraordinarily bizarre with longish hair and a rather sparse beard. Draco wondered if Ron had affected the look merely to annoy his domineering wife—it seemed the sort of passive-aggressive revenge Weasley would take. Ron embraced Harry as well—quite the huggers, Gryffindors—and must have decided that ignoring Draco was the best policy. He shot Draco a single glare and dragged Harry into the house with an arm around his neck, leaving Draco and Hermione to stare at each other in uncomfortable silence until she grudgingly asked, "Would you like to come inside?"
Draco suppressed a smile and six sorts of sardonic comments, because he felt rather touched to be trusted with such a sacred item. It was a massive statement, to Draco's thinking, and felt something like a thank you for potentially saving Granger's life.
Harry snorted a laugh and took another drink. He glanced around the flat, which was packed with people, many of whom Harry did not even know. Hermione was in a corner arguing with someone from the Department of Magical Games and Sports. Ron had wandered off somewhere, and Sarah the American was hovering near a dark-haired girl with one arm braced on the wall and a very intense look on her face. That was a bit of a surprise; Harry had been almost entirely certain she was straight.
Seamus crowed and threw his hands up, sloshing the last droplets of his drink onto the table. "I knew it! So let's do it! I have a camera here somewhere." He plunked his empty glass down and got to his feet, swaying erratically as he crossed the room.
Parkinson nodded and then shot to her feet. "Let's find Gryphon and get this over with. She wasn't home, so I was searching the crowd here. She won't be hard to find." With that, Parkinson headed back into the fray. Harry hurried to keep her in sight as she pushed through the attendees without apology.
The food was plentiful and, frankly, delicious. The roast chicken was more succulent than any Draco had tasted in fine restaurants, the asparagus crisp and drizzled with lemon, and the potatoes had been baked with butter, cheese, cream, and seasonings until the gods themselves would have wept at the flavour. Draco earnestly complimented Molly upon each dish and he did not think it was his imagination that she began to soften towards him.
The door opened into mirrors. Rows and walls and windows of mirrors. Draco had expected it, but the sheer number of them was still something of a shock, or perhaps he was finding it difficult to think at all after Harry's kiss and strangely moving declarations. Honestly, Draco hadn't felt so giddy since his seventh Christmas, when he'd opened a particularly long package to find his first broom within.
Harry joined him, standing shoulder to shoulder with Malfoy as they systematically took down the gingerbread army, felling the last of them just as McGonagall and Flitwick reached the top of the stairs.
d him towards the bed, but Harry suddenly slipped out of his grasp and darted to his pack. "Wait, I have a present for you. I almost forgot."
"I didn't say that. I will share my suspicions the moment I can give you something more than vague possibilities. I don't need you running around in a panic."
Before Draco could drawl a retort—Weasley was a bloody fine chess player, although his technique was unsurprisingly Gryffindorish, straightforward and without much finesse—a sharp flash of light pulsed through the room, followed by a Patronus that sent Weasley scrambling out the door with a barked, "Stay here!"
Not surprisingly, much of the décor in the room was green, but it was a lovely, medium shade that was nothing like Slytherin green, and much of the fabric contained a subtle pattern that gave it a rich, touchable look. The blankets that surrounded Malfoy had a similar design, although the sheets were stark white. The holidays had not been forgotten here, either, and more greenery bedecked the fireplace mantle, interspersed with ornaments and white candles. Malfoy himself, thankfully, wore what looked like a silk shirt or pyjamas in a pale blue colour. Harry's eyes were drawn to the bedside table where several vases rested, filled with flowers of various shapes and sizes. A bright balloon was attached to one vase; it bobbed with unfelt currents of air, and looked almost incongruously cheerful.
"Oh, that. Actually, no," Harry said. He refrained from grinning with effort, glad to have the upper hand over the icy prat.
Hermione clutched his hand. "You still can. Don't let Malfoy influence you. He has his own agenda and no one knows what it is. Maybe you would be better off doing something else. Take Eddie and go on a long vacation, once he is up and around again."
"Oh that's enough of that," Parkinson growled and sent a volley of hexes his way. Quartermain deflected several of them, but one slipped through and grazed his foot. His leg solidified into a plank of wood and Quartermain's grace turned into a ragdoll sort of flop. He dragged the wooden leg and hopped smartly to avoid another set of curses spelled his way by Zabini. Malfoy's friends separated and moved in different directions, obviously intending to divide and conquer.
The man whispered a spell and Eddie screamed, audible even through the—was that Muggle tape covering his mouth? Harry took a step forward, but the man shouted, "Drop the fucking wand!"
He turned to see Malfoy still seated. His arms rested on the chair as though his bonds had never been freed. "Malfoy?"
The baby made a cooing sound and banged a brightly-coloured rattle against Curtis' chest. Multi-coloured lights instantly sprang from the toy and swirled around it in a shifting pattern.
Malfoy glanced at Harry and then back at Toby. "Exactly. Did he, by chance, happen to teach it to you? The Stinger?"
The Leaky Cauldron was nearly empty, which would change once the Ministry and other businesses let out for the evening, so they chose a corner table near the front. Harry bought them a couple of pints and some gravy-covered open-faced beef sandwiches. Then he cast a
Draco frowned as she disappeared. Flirting with Potter was simply not on. Potter turned on him the moment the door closed behind Draco's friends. "How did you do it? How did you know? And you couldn't have mentioned it?"
"I don't know the bloody password because I am not a bloody Gryffindor," Draco growled. "I need to speak to bloody Potter and his bloody minions
"Do not look at me like that, Potter, I am perfectly serious and the pieces have finally fallen into place. I suspected her after… well, I've been watching her for quite some time, but then I met with Liam Nottingham and he confirmed everything. Do you know that she contracted Fenrir Greyback to kidnap Nottingham's son in order to put a dreadful scare into him? Nottingham was threatening to flee from their operations and tell Shacklebolt everything. Luckily for him, she decided to simply kidnap the child rather than disembowelling him, or tapping Nottingham himself with a Killing Curse. She erred in thinking it would cow him rather than making him more desperate to escape."
Day off! I took a long nap and then sent Kreacher out to restock the pantry so we don't starve to death. Sometimes I forget that he needs every detail spelled out or he will just lurk around the house all day doing nothing.
"I'll be needing this." Rosier yanked the knife free and Eddie screamed so loudly that Harry would have blocked the sound if he'd been able. "Oh my. Looks like I've nicked an artery. You'll most likely bleed to death in about five minutes, Eddie. Too bad. Good day, boys."
Draco gave him another smile and this one edged into fondness before Draco could stop it. "It's a start, Harry."
There was a long pause and Draco could practically feel Mark leaning on the other side of the wooden doorway, but at last Mark's voice came through.
"What a pity that the Head Auror won't take the Saviour's word for it," Malfoy murmured as he pulled out his wand. "Think of all the paperwork it would save."
Harry nodded. "I agree. If what you've told me is true, we need to confront her now. And I'm worried about Hermione."
"We found a reference to this book and Granger remembered seeing it in here last night," Malfoy said mildly.
"Why, hello, there. Aren't you a bold one? Attracted by Ayah? Or did you slip your jesses and escape your master?" Malfoy's voice was toneless and soothing.
Malfoy stood beyond the building, dressed in dark robes that fluttered in the breeze. It was much windier once past the shelter of the house and gardens, and the wind gusted around the eaves of the shed. Malfoy raised an arm, still facing away from Harry, and a large bird fluttered its wings as it dropped from the sky and landed on Malfoy's forearm.
The answer sat upon the remains of a crumbled block of stone and Harry stopped short in surprise. He grinned ruefully for not grasping it sooner. Scrimgeour hated Draco Malfoy even more than he hated Harry, regardless that the former Death Eater had been largely responsible for the final defeat of Voldemort.
