He let his mind wonder as he cleaned himself.  He had a much better time last night than he had ever thought he would.  Not that he would willingly admit it to Mother or even Blaise but they were right.  He could not shut himself inside the walls of the manor to avoid the reactions his face and name pulled forth.  Life must go on and while he planned to continue experimenting and adjust potions it would no longer be something he hid behind.  Seeing his friends last night had been the death knell in his refusal to return and repeat his final year.  He knew it would not be easy but he had faced much worse before.  He had a noseless bastard living in his home.  He had fallen asleep hearing the gut wrenching screams of agony and pain.  He could handle Hogwarts and use it as a preview of how the wider world would treat him after graduation next June.
Draco wasn’t all that shocked truth be told.   Harry had always seemed to have the weirdest shit happen to him, so this was just par for the course.  “I won't pretend I don't have all kinds of questions about that but I won't push as I think we have enough to discuss today as it is.
Thankfully the crowds were light and no one had any interest in the average looking blond boy making his way to Gringotts.  It was nice to occasionally visit the wizarding world anonymously like this but it required a concentration that he’d normally fail to keep if he attempted conversation or stayed out too long.  He was much better at it in short bursts like he was currently taking advantage of to make it up the street to the bank.  If Polyjuice Potion didn’t taste so awful and contort the body in the oddest ways he might seriously consider using it more often.  Maybe he should talk to the twins to see if there was something they could come up with to suit his needs.
With a quick swish of his hand he set the floor back to rights and scooped his son out.  After brushing his teeth and a quick story, Caelum was fast asleep in bed.  Harry quietly turned out the lights and closed the door.  He then made his way into the study to write a letter that would no doubt change Draco Malfoy’s life.  He gathered the letters that he had written over the years to the blond and placed them in a box with tonight’s letter on top.  Before he could change his mind, he sent his owl off into the night and sank down into his chair with a tumbler of Firewhiskey.
Theo sat with his jaw dropped.  Not only was the information shocking, but Draco’s demeanor was as well.  “Holy shit, Draco, I couldn’t have dreamed up this conversation.  Her actions are horrendous both to you and to the Longbottoms.  I don’t know what I can do to help, but I’m more than willing to try.”
It wasn’t that he was lazy.  He just didn’t see the point in taking every class offered when he was still unsure of exactly what he wanted to do.  The only reason he came back was to figure out Dumbledore’s riddle and he’d already decided to sit back and observe where that was concerned.  With that and abundant free time coming up in mind he sat down to write Sirius a quick letter.
Hermione gasped.  She had been on the edge of tears at just the thought of what Draco had been through.  She’d suffered under Bellatrix’s wand as well and knew how strong she threw that curse.  She now saw why Draco had asked for the Oath.  It had nothing to do with his potion, it had to do with protecting Neville’s privacy.  Her heart began to soften towards the boy sitting across from her.  They had all been through hell, but Bellatrix was a special kind of hell.  Who knew he had such a tender heart hidden underneath all of the hatred he had spewed in the past?
“Mr. Potter, I had thought you were done giving me palpations watching you on a broom but I see I was wrong.”
Narcissa paled. While she agreed she would not have phrased it quite like that. “Draco dear, please consider if not Hogwarts, just leaving the house. Blaise was telling me Pansy’s birthday is approaching and they are having a party for her. Go. See your friends and test the waters. If it goes bad I promise to not mention Hogwarts again. I just want you happy.”
As they ate their lunch Pansy decided to bring up what had been plaguing her for a while.  After Draco’s 16
Ragnok offered to replay Dumbledore’s will for him and upon Harry’s agreement waved his hand over a small stone in the center of his desk.  There was a flicker before a light blue hologram of Dumbledore’s face was in front of him.  He was so surprised to see his face moving again he missed the first several seconds of it.  “Harry, my boy,” the ghostly image of Dumbledore spoke “it appears I am indeed off on my next grand adventure and I’m sure I’ve left you with more questions than I have answers.” He paused to chuckle here and Harry reluctantly did as well.  Truer words might never have been spoken.  “No matter, I’m confident that you will succeed in the mission and prevail.” Dumbledore continued.  “I’m sure you are confused as to why I’m leaving most of my worldly possessions to you instead of someone else.  The answer is both simple and complicated.”  Harry privately thought all of Dumbledore’s actions were both simple and complicated so this while bizarre was also perfectly normal.  “I trust you to look beyond the obvious.  Dig deep and find the truth.  People see only what they want to see.  Many people hide behind masks for a multitude of reasons.  I’m asking one last favor of you and I hope it isn’t one too many.  Search through the ashes and find the smoke.  Help the smoke rise. That is all I ask of you Harry.  My last request.  You’ll see that I’ve left several things to a few other loved ones but there was really no one besides you that I trusted with this nor who I cared for more.  I do regret many things about my choices and how they directly affected your life.  This is my attempt at an apology if you will.  Live your life and soar to heights beyond your wildest imagination, Harry.  I can think of no one who has ever deserved it more.”
“Forgetting Dumbledore’s last great puzzle, I’m proud of you pup.  I was worried you were beginning to let life pass you by.  Solving another riddle isn’t how I imagined it’d happen, but you’ve got a small spark back in your eye.  I’m happy.” Here Sirius paused. “Then I remember you’re moving out and I’m not.  It’s a very confusing ride you’ve set me on.” He winked and Harry laughed.  “So, let’s see the list of contenders and narrow it down for you, Prongslet.”
year that he’d spend an enjoyable night drinking and socializing with the group that he had last night willingly he’d transport them to St. Mungo’s himself.  He’d even enjoyed himself and looked forward to doing it again.  Ron would no doubt call him barmy when he heard about it.
After a good soak and thorough scrubbing Harry decided the best thing he could do would be to go to bed.  He knew waiting up for a reply tonight would be pointless as The Burrow was a long flight and it was already as late as it was.  He climbed in his bed and pulled the covers over his head willing his mind to stop swirling in so many directions.  Finally, after what felt like hours, he drifted off to sleep.
Harry really hoped he wasn’t going to hear the lecture from McGonagall that he had avoided getting from Hermione. “Hum…. well, I guess the obvious first thing to do would be to give them a place to get together.  We have the added benefit of a common room for all of us to use while the other years don’t.  While a Gryffindor could probably invite a Hufflepuff into the common room for a chess game, the same could not be said for a Slytherin at this time.  So, you need to provide a place where all houses can combine.
“I’m sorry to hear that,” said Harry after a few moments, stepping a little bit closer. “Is there a way you can work things out?”
Malfoy looked around the room he’d walked into, then turned to Harry. “This is exactly how I expected it to be.”
Harry stared at him, his breath hitching in his throat. Malfoy’s cheeks had gone red with anger, but the rest of his face remained cool. His eyes watched Harry carefully, staring down to his lips for a few moments, before looking back into Harry’s green eyes.
Mr Weasley was the first to recite the spell, muttering “protego totalum” over and over again, all the way around the attic room until it was completely sealed. Memories flashed in Harry’s mind back to Epping forest, when Hermione used a protection spell so the snatchers couldn’t find them.
It was a rainy, gloomy day. Harry could hardly drag himself out of his uncomfortable bed for the day’s work. Rain hammered down on his window and the sky was nothing but grey darkness. His yawns were only seconds apart.
“I’ll go back to my room, then,” said Harry, standing up. He took a moment to look at Malfoy, who in return continued watching him, his cool grey eyes never looking away. “It’s actually been nice getting to know you, Malfoy. You’re not all bad yourself.”
“Find the peace in the storm, Harry. Feel the rain beating down on you. Feel the freedom it gives you,” Malfoy looked at him, his face suddenly serious. “Let it remind you that you’re alive.”
Shaking his head, Harry lay back down in the bed. Maybe it was George trying to get his attention again. He’d been doing that, especially with some old inventions of his and Fred’s to try and entice Harry out of the room to have fun.
He sat on his bed for what felt like hours, thinking about Astoria and Malfoy. He had no idea why it affected him so much, why it made his stomach churn and his chest hurt. He kept thinking of Malfoy and Astoria waiting with the doctor, who has his wand on her stomach, just to tell her no, she isn’t pregnant, yet again. He couldn’t imagine the strain it might put on their relationship, a relationship that Malfoy finally seems happy in…
It was now around nine in the morning, and Harry decided to explore the little town he had stumbled across. This was another part of canal boating he loved, finding new places to explore. Afterwards he could just apparate home, a reason he loved being a wizard.
After a few hours of Harry staying quiet with Narcissa, he decided to go and apologise before dinner.
Pansy walked in with her husband. She had married Theo Nott a few years after the battle. She was one of the people Harry dreaded to see, but to his surprise, she was pleasant. Harry thought she looked breath taking. She wore a baro’t saya, proudly showing her native dress, which complimented her perfectly. The cream coloured alampay that hung around her shoulders was held together with a silver Slytherin pin. Down towards the bottom of the baro’t saya, it faded into a black colour, with a gold detailing pattern. Pansy seemed to glow in her outfit, she shone so much more now than she did at Hogwarts.
With a hard expression, arms crossed, Malfoy snarled. “What are you going to do, Potter? Sectumsempra me again?”
“Yes, I do,” Harry grabbed onto his hand, forcing him to stop. This made Malfoy jump and he stared at Harry, eyes wide, mouth open. “We will never know how each other felt. But I can tell you I know what it’s like to have repressed trauma. Having to live my life pretending it’s not there. Every time I look in the mirror and see the scar on my forehead, I go through what you told me earlier. I’m thrown back into that time. Sometimes I get phantom pains and I can’t concentrate anymore; I feel like I’m going to pass out in fear that Voldemort is back.”
Though, spending time with her, had Harry thinking that she was extremely lonely. The hobbies she had delved herself into were very time consuming, especially without the use of magic, and she constantly chatted away to Harry. There were hours it would just be Narcissa talking, and she didn’t even notice, but Harry didn’t mind. The stories she told about her and Bellatrix as children entertained him, even the stories of how she and Lucius met.
“What are you expecting us to do with this information?” asked Mr Weasley, a frown creasing his already wrinkled forehead.
Harry was about to settle in front of the fire now the rain hard started, reading a book, when there was a knock on his door. Finding this odd, he got up to go and answer. It couldn’t be Hermione or Ron; they’d both be at work by now. Mrs Weasley, possibly, as she was always popping over to see how Harry was and to give him some company when he was back from Hogwarts. She still treated him like a son.
“They also did things such as using invisible ink, which we had attempted, but one of the Death Eaters had found out about this due to invisible ink being widely used in the wizarding world. Fortunately for us, it wasn’t an important letter, it was mostly a test to see if any of the Death Eaters figured out our tactics. We’ve managed to let a few letters slip through the cracks with having a certain pattern with letters within our sentences, but sometimes it would be difficult to decipher and we stopped doing that. The ribbon tactic was far easier, and we have been using it for the past two years or so,” explained Draco.
Draco thrived now, leaving as much of his pain behind as he could. Both he and Harry had begun to see mind healers, to work through their immense trauma, which only brought them closer together.
“Make yourself at home,” said Ryan, gesturing to the place, “I need to release the rope,” and he climbed back up. Harry just looked around, taken aback at how beautiful the boat was. He sat on the sofa, staring out of the window at the rising sun as the boat gently bobbed up and down.
Draco gestured to the ribbons. “We’d tie them to owl’s feet or tie them onto the parchment we sent for generic letters. No one has suspected anything, as we’ve managed to make it look as though the ribbons are used for practical purposes. There are meanings to them all.
Draco’s hands shook as he held the cup, and he wasn’t able to hold it for very long in fear the tea would spill. After a few moments, a wave of nausea overcame Draco. His eyes darted to Harry’s in panic, and Harry could tell something was wrong. Suddenly, Draco shot up, knocking the chair over with force and ran to the sink, throwing up the small amount of contents in his stomach.
“He will rot there,” said the minister of France, and Draco couldn’t help but feel anger burning inside him. But, unlike younger Draco, he stayed quiet, keeping his lips tightly pressed together. This was for a good cause, he had to keep reminding himself, this will make everything better. This will make your life better.
“Father-” began Malfoy but was cut off. In front of everyone, his mother and wife, all of the butlers and maids from the morning staff, Lucius slammed the metal snake head of his cane across Malfoy’s cheekbone, slicing it open. Astoria nearly screamed, clasping her hands over her mouth as she watched in horror. The staff all cowered; terrified Lucius would take his anger out on them next.
Malfoy opened heavy black doors with the wave of his wand. Harry was sure they were in the undergrounds of the Manor. He looked around the room, which Malfoy dimly lit with candles with another swift wand flick. Harry was shocked to find the room was full of artifacts he had never seen before. It was a mess, it almost looked like the room of requirement in sixth year. And low and behold, there was even the vanishing cabinet stored in the far corner. It brought back memories to Harry which he’d rather forget. Every day he was reminded of the curse he had cast on Malfoy, without knowing what it was, leaving him near death on the bathroom floor, by the scar on Malfoy’s face. Seeing the vanishing cabinet brought it all back now, too.
“I am, Malfoy,” responded Harry, staring straight into the grey eyes that pierced back. There was something different about them. Usually when Malfoy was angry, they reflected that, narrowing as they glared, but today they stayed wide. They darted between Harry’s eyes, unable to keep focused on one thing. He was scared. But scared of what, Harry didn’t know.
“Today seems different,” answered Harry thoughtfully, staring at the large wooden doors that were now closed. “Something seems… Off.”
But George didn’t want to see anyone. All he did was stare at the walls, hands in his lap, and Harry swore he wasn’t blinking either. They all attempted to talk to him, but he kept his lips tight together, ignoring everything they were saying. He didn’t even react when a healer walked in and checked him over.
Shaking his head, Harry spun around quickly on his heel and traipsed off. He shouldn’t be feeling like that, he was Malfoy’s
The door swung open to Borgin and Burkes, knocking Draco out of his thoughts. There he saw Caractacus Burke stood behind the counter, a grin slowly seeping across his face as Caractacus saw his regular seller.
I told you this,” said Hermione, looking around the room at the bodies of people who were all too busy to notice the three’s conversation, chatting to each other and enjoying the food. The only good part of working at Malfoy Manor was that the food was delicious. It may have been a hard job, but the Malfoys always made sure their staff was fed properly. Those were Narcissa’s rules. If Lucius had it his way, they’d be eating beans and bread, but Narcissa insisted they had meals that were similar to those they ate at Hogwarts.
Once the quaint cottage was out of sight, Malfoy abruptly stopped, causing Harry to nearly knock into him.
“I’m glad,” said Harry with a small smile. He watched as George and Ron continued to play wizard’s chess, laughing together. It made him happy to see George smiling, but he still felt that guilt residing in him. There was nothing more he wanted right now than to just go home and go to sleep, block all the emotions he was feeling. Sometimes he thought maybe he should see a mind healer, but after everything he had been through, it would take years for him to even understand how to deal with his emotions.
None of them paid attention as Hagrid left them by the door. They stared in awe at the decoration. The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung, and about twelve Christmas trees where placed around the room, sparkling with tiny icicles, and decoration. The professors where casting various different charms making things like floating bubbles of dancing ballerinas that soared around them.
“You mention nothing of this to your mother” his father said as they made their way through the crowd and back to the Leaky Cauldron.
“yes, father I have,” he simply said trying desperately not to look down he settled his eyes on a portrait behind his father’s head so as not to look directly at him.
“I mean, maybe...but I think it’s just a coincidence Draco, each of the task was assigned to a professor, Hagrid for fluffy, sprout for the plant, McGonagall the chess set, Flitwick the keys, Snape the potions, it’s just a coincidence” she said, Draco almost let out an exasperated sigh but held it in.
The next day Draco woke up in a mood. He had never been a naturally early riser and the exhaustion from the last couple of weeks was starting to set in. He dragged himself to the great hall and ignored pansy’s cheerful wave from across the hall. He plummeted into one of the farther chairs only for Potter and the Weasel to come in cheerful as ever. Indeed, their shared near death experience the night before had already faded to one of the many adventures the duo seemed to collect. Granger on the other hand seemed to be in an equally terrible mood as him. So that at least made him fell some sort of comfort.
The silhouette of the big white Gringotts building appeared on the distance and Draco felt relived leaving the dark alleyway finally behind as they mixed in with the crowd. Harry anxiously looked around in search of the Weasley’s, but they were nowhere to be found.
‘Draco making powerful allies is the most important lesson you will learn at Hogwarts, you have to be on his good side’ he had said. It was the reason potter's sorting was a big deal, and it was a pretty good reason for Dumbledore to put up this elaborate scheme. It just made sense.
The first rays of sunrise starting to peak behind the mountains on the horizon.His entire body was sore, the muscles on his neck where cramped, his eyes felt heavy and the headache from earlier had only gotten worse. The events from previous hours came rapidly rushing back to him, and he felt the panic come back. The only thing in his mind was Harry.
Potter and Weasley sat a few seats away from him, but close enough so Draco could hear everything they were saying. Once they noticed him, there was the awkward pause in their conversation it seemed they weren’t sure if they should say anything to him or not. They all turned to the food without acknowledgment of each other’s existence and soon the duo resumed their conversation. Draco could not help but to listen in.
“Thank you so much for looking over him” Mrs. Weasley said sincerely and pushed Harry back to the inside of the shop with her adding him to the bunch of Weasley’s around her.
It was narrow and empty, and bight Sunday morning sun suddenly seemed to disappear above them. the shops at either side where filled with intriguing articles, scary looking creatures and vials of all shapes that immediately peaked Draco’s curiosity as they walked.  His father kept a quick pace rushing past them making Draco almost struggle to keep up. Finally, after a few turns they found themselves in front of an old corner building, the letters of the sing almost blurred away under the cracking wood.
The trapdoor above was the only source of dim light in the otherwise pitch-black room, it was small no bigger than Hagrid’s hut. It didn’t take Draco long to realize they weren’t really on the floor, whatever it was they were sitting on had blocked the fall. He also didn’t take long to realize it was moving beneath him. It felt cold, and for a horrible second Draco though they had landed on some sort of snake creature. Before Ron pointed out it was in fact some sort of plant he had never heard of before. The plant had started to twist its snakelike vines around his ankles, and as he tried to get away the grip only got tighter.
“keep to the path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties an’ follow the trail in different directions. There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around, so me, Ron, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Harry , an’ Fang’ll go the other” he finished, bloody perfect, he had to be paired with Potter and the drooling dog going into the forest. He didn’t not say anything as the panic he was currently feeling would surely make his tongue betray him.
“Father this is Harry potter – he said he used floo and ended in the wrong place" Draco barley managed to explain.
He started bagging on her window in desperation. He didn’t want to think about what Harry might be going on with Harry, Eventually after a bit of frantic banging the old witch came to her window in shock.
“of course, she did dumb ass,” Draco hollered at them and speed past them. As he picked up the pace he heard Weasley brushing off the whole thing and continuing the conversation as if nothing had happened.
Before Draco had time to even process the situation Hagrid, Weasley an Hermione took off in their own path leaving Harry and him with nothing but a lamp, and stupid and cowardly dog, in the middle of the forbidden forest. They didn’t look at each other, and in a stupid rage of determination to prove Potter was a git, but also to get the hell out of there fast, Draco started to follow the path walking into the deeper into the forest. Potter tried to keep up his fast pace, as they walked in silence.
It was a sunny day, and after lunch Draco and pansy headed together to the outer grounds. Twenty or so brooms lay on the grass.  It took a while for both the rest of the Gryffindor’s and Madam Hooch to arrive.
“Don’t ask me mate,” Ron simply shrugged and reluctantly followed Hermione, Draco let out an exasperated sigh and followed after them. when he caught up to potter he was already mid conversation with Hagrid.
“All I’m saying is it doesn’t seem like an accident that the tasks where basically designed for us” Draco said
“What do you think you are doing,” Draco heard Neville's squeaky voice in the stair case behind him. “You can’t go out again,” he complained  “you’ll get us all in trouble!”
“you do know there is a spell for that right?” Hermione said amused, he didn’t but he wasn’t about to give her the satisfaction and ask he would research it later.
“Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your father can give you —” his father sneered adjusting his robes and picking up his cane, he swiftly grabbed Draco by the shoulder and pushed him out of the shop, Draco looked back at Hermione but she was nowhere to be seen.
It was true none of them had much knowledge about the first war, after all Hermione was a muggle-born and Ron's parents much like his own had sheltered all the Weasley’s form knowing too much. In fairness in terms of actual events, dates and battles they probably knew the same.
“Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back, haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over?”
“We don’t know yet” she sighted rubbing her temples as she stirred her tea. “Mr. potter had lost consciousness by the time professor Dumbledore found him. We don’t know how but he somehow managed to stop Quirrell from getting the stone” Draco sat up confused,
“As good as new” potter said. “what’s one more scar anyway” he said when he noticed Draco had accidentally been staring at the new mark on his neck.
The rest of their time was spent either hunting for hard to come by chairs by the fire place, or searching the endless rows of books of the Hogwarts library for any clue about Nicolas Flamel. Though there weren’t any closer than before, and not knowing where to start but being afraid to ask, it was entirely up to luck whether they were ever going to find anything at all. The trio seemed to be completely driven to find out what the object was on the basis of a fear of it being stolen. Draco on the other hand could only say that he was contributing heavily to the search of Flamel because curiosity got the best of him, and because he kind of wanted to prove to them that it wasn’t Snape. A second quidditch Mach and the last for the year made them see Potter less and less. He often only had time to crash into bed. Which of course made him not able to contribute much to their search efforts. So, him Granger and Weasley where the ones spending long hours in the library when their duties for the day where done. Often it was mostly him and Granger doing the searching while Weasley complained, but they got the job done.
“He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after so I told him after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy” continued Hagrid
“all I’m saying is that maybe it wasn’t a defense against you know who” he said not saying the other name deliberately now.
“Do you want to stop Snape or not?” Weasley shoot back, Draco cringed internally again, it’s not snape. He didn’t say anything.
The day after was unpleasant, the other people in Gryffindor shot them angry looks all day, they had managed to lose their lead on house points. Draco spend most of the day taking his anger out on any idiot who would allow it. He jinxed together the legs of some first year Hufflepuff and made Neville’s potion explode on his face just because of his dreadful mood. He even made a Ravenclaw idiot who got in his way end up crying. Hermione was felling so dreadful and guilty she didn’t even call him out about this behavior as she often did. In fact, even pansy asked him if he was okay when she saw him dinner, and noted he hadn’t acted that way since the beginning of the year, Draco just told her to piss off and mind her own business. Draco could not care less about their opinions he was just determined to make others miserable. It got so bad that Potter even commented about it clearly putting on the ‘goody two shoes it’s not right to bother people’ attitude towards him that Draco so despised.
“Interesting,” his father said simply. “You mentioned that when you were down there he faced the --   ” his father seemed to hesitate for a moment. “The Dark Lord,” Draco was taken back for a second, his father had never before talked about the dark lord directly to him.
“don’t you reckon it’s a bit strange all the curtains are drawn at Hagrid’s, ” Weasley pointed out mid conversation
“I’m telling you Ron I think the dog is guarding the object from Gringotts,” Potter said, Draco started listening more intently. Granger on the other hand who also seemed to have been paying attention to the conversation only rolled her eyes.
Before them was a brightly lit room, letting in the light of the moon, The glass ceiling arching high above them. Over them flew a group of what from a distance looked like huge fireflies.
“It’s potions yes, but not only that it a logic puzzle Potter, It's brilliant, a lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got any logic, they’d be stuck here forever.”
“I just worry about you” she said, Draco was desperate for the topic to die so he interjected with a different thing.
“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” Granger snapped, Draco had noticed it too but no wonder stupid Weasley hadn’t,
“Harry , you can do this, you are a great wizard you know” she said with a sudden change her tone, Draco didn’t want to think about it but it sounded almost goodbye like.
‘perhaps Potter was good at something’ Draco thought. Still he wasn’t discouraged even as the rest of the Gryffindor’s cheer Potter, he saw and angry Professor McGonagall walking directly at the crowd.
“Sorry,” he murmured once he was up on his feet, Harry just nodded. They turned back to the centaur.
“It’s just a house, regardless of what family says, some of the best people I’ve known where Gryffindor’s too,” Snape reassured him, it was awkward for both of them Draco wasn’t used to his godfather talking to him like this but it was non the less very appreciated he for the first time since his sorting didn’t feel completely isolated.
“Just tomorrow,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — we’ve been out for a while we should be in the library.” She said. Ron rolled his eyes.
He was in deep though when he heard someone stepping out bed, he peaked through the curtain to find Potter sitting by the window staring out into the Hogwarts grounds, Draco didn’t notice for a second that harry had turned to look back at him.
“Well — yeah how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, eh? So I told him, Fluffy’s apiece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep ” Draco’s face dropped at the same time as Hagrid’s. The image of the dark lord knowing exactly how to get past the 3 headed dog materialized in his mind.
“Right,” He nodded and flung the cloak over his shoulder, once they finally found themselves alone, or so they thought,
“The Ministry wouldn’t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?” said the old man slightly shifting on his seat
“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” his father said, “All those raids … I hope they’re paying you overtime? But -- Obviously not,” he said examining a book he had taken from Ginny’s cauldron “what’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?”
“apparently,” he smirked clearly enjoying getting back at Malfoy after last night’s incident. Draco only rolled his eyes and kept quiet before he said something dumb and gave Potter more satisfaction. Even more so because Draco just a few weeks ago had been gloating the broom he had at home, only to know realize Potter had a better one. Not only that it was in this moment that it downed on n him that Potter had a broom and was the younger seeker in a century because of him. Potter of course did not miss the opportunity to point this out to Draco. So, for the following week whenever somebody asked him about the broom he would sarcastically say
The weeks passed painfully slowly and Draco found himself once more sitting down in the kitchens reading one morning. when one of the elves frantically burst in announcing that master Malfoy was expected for lunch. All the elves started immediately rushing in what could only be described as organized chaos, plates and vegetables all of sorts levitating everywhere, and cacophony of orders being shouted back and forth. Draco though it best to get out of the way and change into some proper attire for lunch.
“Yes.” The witch said simply, but then because of the sudden shift in her tone of voice It was clear  she would not be answering any more of his questions. “Now Mr. Malfoy, I think it is important we also get you to the hospital wing” she said going back to the professor like voice Malfoy was used to hearing.
Draco though he was losing his mind for a couple of weeks, as he started to slowly come to believe the only other person with some common sense in the entire house of Gryffindor was Granger. As of lately she seemed equally as displeased with Potter and the weasel as him. Draco noticed she had completely stopped talking to them, and while him and Granger barley exchanged any words. They now normally sat together in class as neither of them felt particularly keen of their house mates. Plus they made good partners for assignments as they were equally committed, and normally placed first and second in tasks. Although it could not be said they were friends, they were not by any means, they now greeted each other in the mornings out of common courtesy.
“yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head Might a bin a dragon dealer, I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.” Draco heard the Hagrid say as he finally caught up to the group. He didn’t need much else to understand what Potter was thinking and he felt the nausea creeping up again.
“That now that Malfoy and I are leaving I will make you a detailed list of all the books we have already cheeked, so you don’t do it twice” she smiled. Ron just keeps eating.
“We’ve got to catch the key to the door!” Harry followed understating. he din't wait, or consider the possibility it could be a trap at all, instead  immediately took off on the broom following a specific key he had somehow spotted among the crowd. After just a few short minutes he managed to catch it and open the door.
After a McGonagall reprimand Draco was starting to get weirdly accustomed to at this point the four of them had achieved their first proper detention at Hogwarts and had lost a considerable amount of points for Gryffindor. Hermione on her part was completely mortified as was Potter, they both looked like they had seen someone die after it was over. Weasley on the other had was very pleased as he recounted the million times his brothers had gotten detention, and it appeared to Draco he even felt proud of himself for having something to brag to the twins about. Draco  was only angry the thing that had gotten him in trouble had been the god forsaken dragon.
It  had been almost two hours of tossing a turning in his bed yet Draco could still not conceal sleep, the only thing in his head, was the question of what his father would say when he knew. He had to tell him, and soon or else he would find out form someone else and he knew that would be worse, rumors fly, but he just didn’t know want to even send.
“he’s not what my father hopes,” is all Draco said. “he’s not like any of our families hoped,” Pansy understood. “plus, there is the Granger problem I can’t really explain away why she has anything to do with the potter plan,” he said.
A loud hissing noise and cloud of green smoke filled the room, he turned back to see Longbottom had managed to melt his cauldron and miraculously had not burned his face off.
He knocked on the door three times, the deaf thud noise resonated on the hall strangely. He felt his breath grow shorter as his father’s voices echoed from inside the room telling him to come in.
“You need your strength Harry ,” Seamus chimed in form the other side of the table. “Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team,” He continued Draco laughed.
“Well what a coincidence, we are headed to buy Draco’s books for the school year there ourselves,” his father said, Draco simply nodded in approval. “Its surely no trouble, you can come with us until we can get you back to who you came with; and who may this be?” his father asked.
These types of events always bored him, the grandness of the ball room, the dullness of the classical music and the lack of other people his age were annoying. The only other kids around where other heirs like Draco himself, normally very posh and educated who typically did well mixing with adults and where never allowed to run around, good pureblood children. Even his interaction with Blaise was limited to a very polite hello as he was being paraded around the hall by his parent to meet what seemed like every single important wizard in the whole of England. He was always hearing comments form old witches saying how much he had grown, or what a fine and educated young man he has. This year though he was more hyper aware of the looks he was getting and the little whispers about him being in Gryffindor. He even heard a few comments saying they hoped he didn’t turn out like the other black boy who’d last been in Gryffindor whatever that meant.
By the time he woke up it was almost night fall, and finally the god forsaken headache was gone. After a bit of convincing, and a bit of deliberate manipulation Draco often used when he needed to get things out of adults he managed to convince madam Pomfrey to let him go.  Once free, he ran up to the Gryffindor tower felling as good as new and overjoyed. He found Hermione with Longbottom. she was pacing back and forth as Neville just sat there looking almost petrified listening to her anxious ranting.
“whatever, listen” he began “is it just me? Or doesn’t everything about the stone seem a bit strange to you” he said.
“how are you steeling in? you are getting some rest I hope,” his father said with a little more care that Draco was expecting, Draco tough he detected a hint of some emotion but he thought it might only be his imagination.
“glad to hear my son,” his father said. With a flick of the writs a glass of some old scotch materialized in his father’s hand, we swirled it around in the glass and took a long sip. “I must say Draco I was worried about you, but from what I can tell you seem to be doing pretty good for yourself” he said “still son I’m worried about the company you been keeping” his father said finally. Draco couldn’t help it, and stared at the floor. “what have I said about eye contact son” his father reprimanded
“Now, if you three don't mind, I'm going to bed before any of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed. Or worse, expelled.” They all looked at her in bewilderment. As she stormed out.
When he finally got to the dorm he was greeted by none other than Potter and the weasel still wide-awake playing chess. The common room was otherwise empty except for Granger and some 7 years that were doing some assignments in the various tables. Perfect time to make the weasel and Potter angry Draco thought
“fine, but don’t you think it’s weird that us, a group of first! where able to defeat all the “best” defenses our professors could come out with to stop the literal dark lord” said Draco, Hermione cringed at the name.
“but of course he is, look at the chimney,” he said. “weird day to have the chimney on if you ask me, it’s the only good weather we gotten in months,” he added.
“very well son, as long as you continue to show me you are worth my trust I will trust your choices,” his father said, Draco almost let out a sight of relive but was able to hold it. “Now, tell me everything, about your first term at Hogwarts,” and so Draco did, omitting a lot of parts, and in a very matter of fact way, he told his father about his classes, assignments and a few of his time with friends. Nothing too detailed but enough so that it was believable. His father of course was particularly interested on anything to do with Potter and Draco shared what he could without letting on that he was sure Potter was nothing like his parents or the other purebloods they kept company and heard speculating about him over the years had hoped.
“Not particularly excited to go home, are you?” pansy questioned Draco eyed Bulstrode who hadn’t said a single world and was just listening awkwardly. Pansy got the message he didn’t really want to be discussing this in front of her. There was an awkward pause.
“Father,” he simply replied, worried if he said anything more he would end up choking on his words. His throat was dry, he desperately wished of a glass of water.
“That means at least until next Friday we are safe” said Harry, Draco was about to continue the conversation when Snape appeared as if out of thin air behind them.
“I must get back to work now,” said his father, suddenly a stack of papers materializing between them. Draco got up from his chair felling slightly light headed and turned for the door.
They were then tasked with mixing up a potion to cure boils. Draco had done this simple potion before so he was not worried about the assignment, but rather he was worried about his partner. Pansy made her way to Draco’s table with all the ingredients in hand and set them down.
“What is Potter doing” he said. Everyone around him turned their attention up in an instant the hole school was pointing at Potter.
"game on Potter, yeah? come catch it then” he said taking off towards one of the high towers close to the yard, harry followed him closely, Draco finally deicing on what to do threw the crystal ball as far away as he could. To his surprise Potter dove straight down to catch it. Draco went back to the ground, and was stunned to see Potter had managed to actually catch the Remembrall. And he held it triumphantly in one hand as he came back down.
“I’m not talking to anyone,” said Draco. As he spun on his feel, he was faced with two other men, taller and stockier than him.
“It seems you’re the only person who can open the door to me, Potter,” said Malfoy after a while. He turned back around to face Harry, giving him a small smile, something Harry couldn’t remember seeing on him since their fifth year at Hogwarts.
He started to wish it were him that danced in Malfoy’s arms. He didn’t know why, but the idea of him being in Malfoy’s arms seemed right.
“It’s visiting day for George; Ron hasn’t been able to see him since he got there. He won’t be finished from his shift in time to see him.”
As Draco walked out of the shop, shoving the money into his pocket, he felt someone following him. For a while, he continued on, chin up, but moving quicker than he usual pace. When the feeling didn’t subside, Draco turned into a deserted alley and spun round, facing the stalker.
There was a loud pop behind them, and then a clatter of stones. They both jumped and turned around, to see Malfoy lay on the stones, his body exhausted, his face bleeding.
“Be careful, Draco,” said Blaise quietly before sauntering off. Malfoy stared at the ground for a few moments, standing as still as he could. Then, all of a sudden, he stormed over to Harry and grabbed onto his arms and with a pop, they disapparated.
“Well, I don’t know why I started to worry about you when father took you into another room,” said Malfoy sheepishly, looking down at his hands which were nearly bleeding.
“A very dangerous artefact,” Draco heard the door open behind him. He didn’t look around, but the sound of footsteps quietly making their way round the shop had him on edge. “When used, it releases sharp and poisonous spikes towards the victim,” said Draco.
But the moment was drastically cut short when the burrow’s fireplace suddenly lit up, and in entered a witch and a wizard.
“A song my mother used to sing to me as a child when I was crying,” replied Malfoy. “I used to come here often. I still do. No one ever comes here, it’s extremely hard to get to for muggles. It’s closed off from the world. I feel safe here,” Malfoy looked at Harry, his eyes seemed sad. “It’s the only place I can truly be alone,” he looked back out to the loch.
“Harry. Harry Potter. No, I haven’t. It’s lovely,” responded Harry, having another sip of tea which was slowly sobering him up.
Their hands were still linked together. After a long pause, Malfoy squeezed Harry’s hand gently. “We can help each other.”
“That would be nice,” said George with a small smile. Nodding, Harry shot him a grin before drinking the remainder of what was left in his glass.
“We’re not up to anything, sir,” replied Malfoy. His shoulders were relaxed, his face expressionless. All he did was look up at the large men cowering over him, blinking every so often, lips pressed tightly shut together.
“Where in the name of Merlin have you been?” hissed an angry female voice from in front of them. The dawn was only just breaking outside, and the early morning sun barely shone through the large windows. In the dimly lit corridor, Harry could just about make out the figure of Astoria.
Draco looked up at Harry, no longer wailing, but instead hiccuping out soft cries. Harry’s hand gently wiped away his tears, then cupped his slender, pointed face.
“Fire-call other ministries. France and Germany will definitely be on our side as it has been affecting them too,” explained the wizard as he nodded towards the other three wizards in the room. “Try and fire-call any other ministries you think may also get involved,” he looked at the witch this time, “prepare a special floo network to the safe house. Mr Malfoy has stated it is protected with every bit of magic possible as Mr Potter is there. They have a floo system.”
“I am,” he finally responded, shooting her a sad smile. At this point, Hermione was once again fussing over Ron, who was quite obviously in such a terrible mood. Harry watched them, an adoring smile tugging at his thin lips. Ron and Hermione were such a perfect couple, even though the first few years of their friendship was extremely rocky. Their relationship had blossomed since the battle of Hogwarts, and they’d been nothing but strong ever since. They’d since had children, one boy and one girl, and they were the sweetest kids that Harry had ever come across. Unfortunately, though, the kids had to stay with Molly Weasley while Ron and Hermione were here at the Manor.
Harry heard the door open and he looked up, recognising the two figures who walked in. Malfoy and Astoria. Today Malfoy was dressed in a black turtleneck, paired with a blazer. Astoria looked graceful in a long floral dress, her hair golden brown hair hung loosely down her back, a style which Harry never saw her in. When Astoria noticed them, Harry saw her tug Malfoy’s arm and they made their way over.
“Malfoy, I don’t understand,” said Harry quietly. His mouth felt dry, he needed a glass of water. Malfoy spent a few moments thinking about what to say. He stayed faced away from Harry, staring out of the window that looked upon some woods.
“Draco. It’s so weird hearing you say his first name,” said Ron in amusement. “What is going on between you two?”
When the feeling finally stopped, he started to take in his surroundings. A strong damp smell filled his senses as his eyes adjusted to the dark.
The party seemed to last hours. After the Slytherins had eaten their dinner, music blasted in the hall and everyone used this opportunity to either catch up with their peers or to dance. Every now and then, Harry would look over to Malfoy, who had Astoria by his side the whole time. They would chat to a fellow Slytherin, then head to the dancefloor when a song they enjoyed came on. Malfoy’s hands wrapped around Astoria’s small waist, holding her close, while her arms snaked around his neck. There was a pang of jealousy tugging at Harry’s chest, making the room feel stuffy and his collar suddenly too tight. He tried to shake it off, but every time he looked back over, it was there again.
“We’re getting more info. And it doesn’t look good for you,” a grizzly voice said from beside the main wizard.
They approached a front desk. No words were needed, the receptionist witch instantly recognised Malfoy and allowed them to enter. The pair entered the large hall and Harry was filled with happy memories. Memories of his days being an auror with Ron.
Because of Ron taking the week off work, it had just been Harry stood outside Malfoy’s office. This was unfortunate, but since he’d started working there nothing much had happened. In reality Harry knew they only needed one ex-auror to stand outside Malfoy’s office, but Ron was definitely good company to have all day.
“Yes, you did. You know you did. I’m sick of it, Malfoy, sometimes I feel like you don’t value my feelings over yours. What about when I’m scared? When I watch Lucius walk around with that cane, afraid he’s going to beat me up again like he has done?”
Though, it was as if Lucius didn’t know his wife one bit. Instead, she had Harry help her with her tasks. These ranged from gardening, to cooking, and even to organising the threads for her as she embroidered. Narcissa tried to avoid using magic for lots of her hobbies. She had told Harry, “it’s taking all the fun out of it. Besides, I see it as cheating.” So, she embroidered with thread and needles, she gardened with shovels and spades, she cooked with wooden spoons and measuring jugs.
After Lucius had pushed Harry into a wall, grabbed his hair and threw him to the floor, Harry made his way to his post at Malfoy’s office, who had not arrived yet. Harry’s hands trembled behind his back; his whole body felt weak. Beads of sweat dripped down his forehead as the pain in his face drilled into him.
Moving his lips from the mark, Harry then pulled Malfoy close and their lips brushed together before they began to kiss each other, passionately, lovingly.
“Thank you, sir. Come on, Ron, we’ll miss the hours otherwise,” said Harry, grabbing Ron’s arm to drag him. He looked back at Malfoy as they began to walk, shooting him a thankful smile. Nodding in response, Malfoy smiled too, before walking back into his office.
Back to work again. After working the shift on Sunday, Harry was definitely not in the mood for this. One day was not long enough to be away from this job, not even two was.
“It’s a hard one to relive,” admitted Harry, shaking his head, “it’s the last time I saw my family.”
“Uh, I don’t mind, but if you want privacy you can go in the bathroom,” responded Harry. His ears started burning and he felt his cheeks flush. Nodding again, Malfoy walked into the bathroom but left the door open. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry watched him slowly peel off the wet turtleneck, revealing his very thin body. It was a small shock to Harry how thin he was, he could see Malfoy’s ribcage and spine. The scars that Harry had given him decorated his body, reminding Harry of their fucked-up past. They seemed worse than he remembered, deeper and many more than he thought. Closing his eyes, he looked away, attempting to fight back tears.
“You do not call me Malfoy, you only call me sir,” he spat. “How dare you swear at me, how dare you attempt to question what goes on. I can easily find another bodyguard and have you sent to the workhouses. You should be wishing yourself lucky, Potter.”
“We’re going to do everything we can to keep you safe,” said Mr Weasley with a nod, and Mrs Weasley then nodded too.
But Harry was there, holding Draco tightly, breathing, living, okay. The pain shot through Draco like bullets, piercing his heart with every sob he released.
But then it became brighter, and brighter, until Harry realised it was no longer the moon. Looking to his side, he noticed a silver ball of light flickering. Frowning, he slowly sat up, trying to figure out what it was. For a split second, he could see an ear of an animal, but then the light disappeared completely.
“This was sent today,” said the witch, passing the wizard the ribbons. One of every colour. Breath hitching in his throat, he squeezed them tight in his hand.
“Oh yes, I’ll have to see if I can risk losing a member of my staff,” said Malfoy, his voice slightly raised. He seemed to be panicking.
“Hi, Harry,” said George, before walking over to him and giving him a hug too. “Thanks for coming to see me.”
Harry could barely remember that year. It was such a blur, and his alcohol dependency didn’t help. Turning eighteen, being the boy who actually did kill Voldemort, along with losing so many people he loved in just one night took its toll. But one morning after a long night of drinking, he ended up among a canal in the London countryside. The sun was just about to rise, and the streets were silent, aside from one man named Ryan. It was a brief friendship, but Harry held it dear to his heart.
Malfoy moved quickly; he always had done. His walk was sleek, it was almost as if he was floating along. The confidence shone in him; it was as if he knew exactly where he was going at all times of the day. This had been the same as when he was in Hogwarts. Even lost, Malfoy walked with confidence, his chin raised and staring straight ahead. Something about this Harry admired in him.
George looked at Harry. “They’re never really gone, you know that. Everyone we lost in the battle, everyone before, everyone after. Sirius, Remus, Fred, your mum and dad. They’re not really gone,” George looked back out to the sunrise.
“Harry,” whispered Malfoy, not looking away. It was as if the pain had melted away. Here Harry was, by his side. This was all Draco needed.
Malfoy swiftly walked over to the counter as if he already knew what he wanted. Tottering behind slowly, Harry darted his eyes to the lunch menu. The food was simple, the usual muggle café type of food.
“And how exactly have you obtained this information?” asked Lucius in a mocking tone. A silence was held for a few moments, before Draco stepped forward.
“It’s unsafe,” began Mrs Weasley, before Harry made an entrance into the room. He knew he shouldn’t exit the attic, but hearing his best friends beg Mrs Weasley just to know he’s safe made him take the risk.
The swarms of witches and wizards marched towards the dining room. Draco merged into the crowd as the ministers walked in front, and they swung the doors open with such force the doors slammed into the walls.
Harry opened the door to his bedroom, allowing Malfoy to walk in first. He looked around, a small frown furrowing his brows, taking in the room.
He made his way back to his post, keeping hold of the jug in his hand in case a refill was needed. Harry had to keep an eye on all the glasses. As soon as a quarter was left, he had to be straight over there topping it up, even if they weren’t going to drink any more water.
“I know,” said Harry with a gentle tone, holding him even closer, if it was possible. The two walked through the manor corridors, Malfoy now clinging onto Harry, relying on him for support. The events of last night had completely tired him out, especially his conversation with Blaise, and the alcohol that resided in his body definitely did not help.
Over the next few months, Draco had started to heal. There were times he had night terrors, and would wake Harry up screaming, thrashing about, yelling Astoria’s name. It got to a point he’d end up taking dreamless potions at night just to stop them, but Harry had insisted he tried to come off them, as if Draco didn’t take one, he’d have a panic attack.
Harry pondered over to the patch, shovel in hand, and began to dig at the root. He could feel the back of his neck burning, but he almost didn’t mind. Narcissa had made sure he had plenty of cold water, had even made him put on sunscreen before they headed to the gardens.
“Mate, it was extremely risky, you doing this,” said Ron with a shake of his head, “Lucius is absolutely furious.”
“Are you hurt?” asked Harry. The patronus continued watching him, then slowly turned around and began to walk, disappearing through the door, leaving Harry in darkness.
“Am I? Or are you? There are so many things you refuse to tell me. The dealings at Borgin and Burkes, the men who have twice, now, attacked you, and now this secret meeting? Red ribbons? What the fuck?”
“Perfectly fucking fine,” spat Malfoy, shaking his head, and leaning back in the seat before looking out of his office window. The light from the candle on his desk illuminated his face, making the tears shine more. Malfoy swallowed, before looking back at Harry. “No, I’m not.”
“Of course,” Harry walked in front of her and knocked gently on the door. As he opened it, he saw Draco, lay in the bed. Today was a bad day. “Draco,” said Harry, “you have a visitor.”
“I’m fine, sir,” responded Harry, attempting to keep professional. He didn’t want to be seen as weak, especially not after having to take up this job, especially not in front of Malfoy.
“Better,” replied Harry as he rinsed his brush under the faucet, “although I haven’t seen him for a while. Haven’t you?”
“Although, sometimes I feel as though he doesn’t care,” said Astoria, “I try very hard and Draco never seems interested. There’s always an excuse, he’s too tired, he’s had a bad day, he’s got to get up early in the morning. Sometimes I wonder if it’s me,” Astoria had said too much. In a fit of rage, Malfoy stood up, knocking over his chair before storming out of the pub. Instantly Astoria’s cheeks went bright red, she knew she had messed up, and she looked ashamedly down at her lap. Harry saw a tear slowly fall down her cheek.
Harry always dreamed of that. Those were the days he truly knew who he was, especially after he left and became an Auror. He’d always think back to those days when he needed to escape. The times he and his friends were in the great hall, eating a delicious dinner and having a laugh together. The times in classes when he’d get things right and would be awarded five points for his house, earning him beams from Ron and Hermione. The times after the battle, when he was training to be an Auror, he and Ron. They’d stay up late studying, help each other out in the field, and when they both graduated and became Aurors, life seemed to be falling in place. Harry was happy, even if his relationship with Ginny crumbled, even though he realised he was…
“Come on, Malfoy, we need to apparate back to the manor,” said Harry. Malfoy didn’t respond, he just continued looking at the sky, a smile growing on his plump lips. “Sir!”
“This is the closest thing we’ll get to an anti-drunk potion,” said Harry light-heartedly as he poured Malfoy a cup. Attempting to be careful, Malfoy took hold of the cup and slowly sipped the coffee, grimacing when he realised it was a black coffee.
“Do you understand?” asked Malfoy in a low voice. Quickly Harry nodded and Malfoy instantly backed off, turning back round and continued walking. They ended up heading towards the Leaky Cauldron, which Harry thought was strange, but didn’t question it. As they entered, Malfoy pointed to a table in the corner.
Harry didn’t realise he had been silent for a while, taking Malfoy’s words in. Slowly he looked up, seeing Malfoy’s grey eyes staring back.
Palms starting to sweat, Harry squinted at the corner of the room where the beam of light had been. There was no longer a trace of it, not even a flicker, but Harry couldn’t rest.
“Where are we?” asked Harry. In front of them both was a loch, which Malfoy was already sat down next to, throwing a stick into it. Cautiously Harry walked over to him, looking around once more before sitting down.
“Why?” pondered Harry, sipping his butterbeer. Mixing drinks was never a good idea for Harry, but he was having fun and truly did not care. The buzz made his head fuzzy and his vision blurred, sometimes he forgot that he was still wearing his glasses, but he liked it. The numb feeling it gave him, how it made him uncontrollably laugh, how he felt free from any anxiety or memories that he constantly tried to suppress with failure.
“Just in case.” Harry could feel the anxiety build up inside him. He still hadn’t forgotten what happened to him after he and Malfoy had disappeared to the loch. Sometimes his ribs still ached, the bruises were only just beginning to fade.
Once the last pin was pulled out, he could see Draco’s skin begin to heal. The cobwebs faded, until a light grey colour was all that was left.
“What’s happening?” asked Harry, eyebrows furrowed as the couple stood close together, tears running down Mrs Weasley’s face.
“Could I have a cappuccino and a cream tea, please?” Malfoy smiled at her, reaching into his pocket and pulling out some muggle change.
The two stumbled around the manor, trying to keep quiet but failing completely. They giggled like schoolgirls as they clung to each other, knocking into the dark walls, stumbling over their own feet as well as each other’s. In an attempt not to get caught by Malfoy’s parents, they headed to Harry’s room and fell into it, laughing loudly together once the door was shut, knowing they could be as loud as they liked and no one would really hear them. Even with that reassurance, Malfoy clumsily pulled out his wand and put a silencing charm on the room, yelling “
“I already told you,” he responded, looking at Harry finally. “Il semble que je ne peux que te voir.”
“You too,” laughed Harry, walking out of the shared bathroom. He made his way back to his bedroom, luckily the only thing in this place he didn’t have to share. It was small, the walls engulfed him sometimes, but he was thankful he could have his own privacy. The walls were bare and black, with only one small window, which Harry was just able to see the sunrise through.
“Your father has been acting out at the ministry,” one of them explained. Harry noticed he also worked at the ministry; Harry knew him from his training days.
“Just think of something, Malfoy. Anything you can. Let the memory consume you, take over you, so nothing else is in your mind. Anything at all and give it a try.”
“I’ll go,” said Narcissa softly, then looked over to Harry, “if you begin separating my threads, that would be lovely,” she instructed before walking out the door Malfoy had left through. After a moment, Astoria stood up and motioned to Hermione and another half-blood named Beatrice, to follow her. Hermione shot Harry and Ron a sad glance, before rushing after the elegant figure who seemed to float out of the room.
“I’d done some reading into muggle history. There was a spy ring called the Culper Ring, which was in the American Revolutionary war. They did this to share information on the British Army to Washington. They would send out pre-arranged signals. For example, a woman would hang a black petticoat on her washing line which meant Brewster, one of the spies, was arriving in his whaleboat.
It had been a restless night for Harry. He’d tossed and turned all night long, unable to switch off his thoughts. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Malfoy in front of him, the pained look on his face as they argued. How his mouth had opened as if he were about to apologise before Harry disapparated. How his eyes seemed duller than they had been, darker circles decorating the underneath of his eyes, his cheekbones looking more sunken than Harry remembered. Thinking back, Harry wished he had noticed earlier and asked Malfoy if he was okay. The meeting he’d had seemed serious, and Harry couldn’t figure it out.
Draco’s hand dropped down from his sleeve and into his hand. A flash of despair ran through his body as he realised, he couldn’t get help.
Walking round the rest of the table, serving Astoria and Narcissa their water, Harry then went and stood back at his position. Out of the corner of his eye, he watched as Malfoy put the bare minimum on his plate. His face never changed, his full lips stayed clenched together, his eyes staring only at the plate. Every so often he would look up at Astoria, whom he married a few years back, but his expression never altered.
“You’re whining because you can’t have me with you. Do you think I had bodyguards when Voldemort was trying to kill me? No. I had to stand up for myself, I had to protect myself. Why can’t you do the same?”
“A little,” replied Harry, before sucking a sharp intake of breath through clenched teeth as Malfoy accidentally pressed too hard.
“Harry?” called a familiar voice as he arrived at his destination. Suddenly, Mrs Weasley burst out the door to the burrow and ran to him before engulfing him in a warm, loving hug.
“Do you need someone to talk to?” asked Harry, still stood outside the room. He didn’t want to overstep his boundaries, in this situation Malfoy was in control. He controlled everything to do with Harry. Where he slept, how long he slept for, when he ate, if he was to survive another day or not. Though Harry had backchatted a few times, he always stayed slightly fearful of Malfoy, as much as he didn’t want to.
“It looks amazing,” breathed Harry, looking up to the floating candles. Warmth filled his stomach as he remembered back to the first time he ever saw candles float, the first time he’d ever stepped foot in Hogwarts. That was one of the last times Harry remembered being truly happy. The fear of Voldemort wasn’t there, he wasn’t even in the back of his mind, all he could think about was how excited he was to be a Wizard, to be at Hogwarts with people like him.
“I am not in the mood today, mate,” Ron sighed, running his fingers through his messy ginger hair. Nodding in agreement, Harry put some toothpaste onto his toothbrush. Ron was one of his closest friends from his days at Hogwarts. He had taken Harry under his wing when Harry had first arrived, showed him the ropes, helped him when Harry had gotten stuck or in trouble. Ron had been Harry’s saving grace, both him and his wife, Hermione.
“I’ll help him to bed,” said Harry, before gently running his hands through Draco’s hair to wake him softly. Eyelids drooping, Draco looked up at Harry sleepily. “Bedtime, mister,” chuckled Harry. Draco whined, but sat up anyway, rubbing his eyes while he swayed slightly.
“No, it’s not,” said Malfoy suddenly, causing Ron to look at him in shock. “Listen, I’m finished for the day. I’m going to spend some time with Astoria. Why don’t you both go to St Mungo’s and visit George?”
“They have to hide from their grandfather?” asked Malfoy, standing up and glancing at the book again.
Pulling into a new dock, Harry clambered off the boat. Once again ensuring there were no muggles near, he put a cloaking spell on the boat, following that with a ward to make sure no one accidentally bumped into his invisible canal boat.
Grunting, Harry walked to the changing room. In annoyance, he pulled of his casual and comfy clothes and tried on the suit. It was a dark brown colour, the material was soft even though it didn’t look it, and Harry found it very comfortable to wear. He left the first three buttons of the white shirt unbuttoned, then opened the curtain to the changing rooms. Malfoy was there with a few more suits draped over his arm. Looking at him up and down with his grey eyes, Malfoy smirked slightly.
Loud wails sounded from the man as he buried his head into Harry’s chest, grabbing onto his shirt in desperation, as if he was afraid that if he didn’t, Harry would disappear.
Either way, Harry’s heart felt heavy as he dragged himself to his shower. The warm water beat down on his shoulders, massaging his aching head and relieving some pressure, unfortunately not enough. He stayed in the shower for longer than he usually did, rethinking the night’s events. It was almost as if he could still feel Malfoy’s lips on his, the hands tugging at his hair through passion. Tingles in his body sparked every time he thought of the kiss, butterflies fluttered around his stomach.
“I don’t know,” answered Malfoy truthfully, leaning back to sit on the desk. He crossed one slim leg slightly over the other and began to pick at the skin on his knuckles. “I guess, after yesterday, I owe you one, Potter.”
“Harry Potter!” Mrs Weasley yelled as she gripped tightly to him, “you had us all absolutely worried sick.”
Harry finally released her and they both sat back down at the table. Ron got up to order her a drink.
“I went with Malfoy to a pub, where he wanted to go, and didn’t leave his side, just like I am paid to do, Hermione. That’s all.”
Malfoy strode past them, dressed in black robes that trailed along behind him, giving him a sense of authority and power. Malfoy had taken over the affairs of the house and the dealings of dark artifacts. His job seemed extremely stressful, and even more so with Astoria as his wife.
After finishing his coffee on his comfortable sofa, he decided to run some errands. He floo’d himself to their local Wizards market and started accumulating food options for the weekends. This mostly consisted of simple to cook things, like pasta and rice, that would keep for months. Looking around, he saw two slender figures that he really did not want to bump into that day. Malfoy and Astoria, walking with their arms linked. Malfoy wore long black robes, of course, that covered his body and most importantly, his arms. Astoria wore a dark green long black dress, which looked to be velvet, and it was rather beautiful. As was she.
“Not good,” answered Hermione with a forlorn smile, “not good at all. He’s really torn up about it. He’s been drinking every night and has been arguing nonstop with his staff. Astoria desperately wants you to come back.”
After some moments of reflection on the past year, Harry finally decided to get up to make some food. There was little effort left in him from the long journey home, travelling from the top of the country to the very bottom. Harry didn’t mind taking the Hogwarts train rather than apparating home. It was nostalgic to him, sitting in those same carriages he sat in with Hermione and Ron for the first time fourteen years ago. He would make his way through the carriages of the train, chatting to any student that said hello to him. He truly loved being a professor at Hogwarts.
Ron had floo’d himself to Harry’s house one night, at around three in the morning. He’d shook Harry awake, tears and snot dribbling down his face.
Harry wrapped an arm around him and pressed a soft kiss to the back of Draco’s head. It was as if this small motion woke Draco out of a deep slumber. He rolled round, facing Harry. For a few moments, they stared at each other, then Draco’s whole face began to crumple.
“He won’t catch us in the staff quarters,” suggested Harry as they began to sneak through the halls. Malfoy agreed and they rushed around, stopping before every corner and poking their heads round on lookout for anyone that could see them. They both felt like kids again.
Harry smiled kindly, “there’s no reason for you to apologise.” After taking hold of a tissue from the box on Malfoy’s desk, Harry placed it on one of his knuckles, pressing down slightly to help with the bleeding.
“Draco?” came a voice from behind. Shutting the book quickly, Draco twisted his head to find Harry, still curled up in the bed, but his eyes now open.
“Sometimes I think the stars twinkle when they know I’m happy,” said Malfoy with a sigh. Harry didn’t respond, but he could feel his cheeks going red. Did Malfoy just admit to being happy with him?
“We have now seen you selling illegal artefacts to the shop,” said the man, allowing the other to release Draco’s neck. All he wanted to do was cough and splutter, take in deep breaths, but he didn’t. Instead, he kept his mouth shut, and he stared at the men in front of him. He didn’t want to look weak.
Malfoy and Harry looked at each other nervously before Malfoy headed towards the corner of the room. The room seemed to spin as Harry stepped towards Lucius, who peered down at him with evil eyes.
“I know,” he muttered in defeat. Carefully Harry pulled him up, Malfoy’s body swayed to the side as he did, the alcohol clearly still in him. Taking another few moments to try and wake up, he looked down at their hands that were still holding onto each other. For an instant, Harry thought Malfoy would quickly pull their hands apart, shout at Harry, call him disgusting. But instead, Malfoy’s thumb carefully stroked over the prominent scar of the words ‘I must not tell lies’ that decorated the top of his hand.
“There is one more thing, Harry, and I really didn’t want to have to tell you,” Hermione’s voice trailed off as she refused to make eye contact with her best friend.
“I’m so sorry, Mrs Weasley,” said Harry, “Draco cast a patronus.” Pulling away, Mrs Weasley looked at Draco with wide eyes, only just noticing the skinny boy was stood in the doorway.
Breathing deeply, Harry shook himself off and managed to do up his tie. He looked down at his hands, a frown furrowing his eyebrows. They felt heavy, but there was nothing there. Missing was his wand. The job forced him to leave his wand back at his own home, only able to use it on weekends or at holidays. Here, no magic was allowed.
“Thanking him in your speech, always looking at him, and don’t think I didn’t see what you did when you approached us,” Blaise spoke in an accusatory tone.
“Today, I got in trouble. Those wizards you saved me from before, they had followed me into Borgin and Burkes while I was making a deal. Afterwards, they followed me down an alley. They began to threaten throwing me and my family in Azkaban, and when I grabbed my wand, I realised I couldn’t call for help.” Malfoy looked up at him with sad eyes and they glistened softly in the dim candlelight.
“But I have tried, so many times, Harry. Every time I thought of something, it didn’t work. Parties in the Slytherin common room, getting top grades one year, being on the Quidditch team. Even my wedding day didn’t make it work,” huffed Malfoy, crossing his arms as he already felt defeated.
“Because it’s you, you and your attitude towards things. Acting like everything’s easy peasy. Maybe it is when you’re the chosen one, but not when you’re me. You’re lucky, you know that? Everything got handed to you your whole life. Help when you needed it, time when you needed it. Everyone ran around for you, did all your dirty work for you. I had to battle all of my own demons on my own. Pansy, Blaise, Theo, they never understood. Everyone thought I was a spoilt kid who got everything he wanted just because my father was rich. That wasn’t the case.”
“Oh?” said Narcissa in a bored tone, not thinking anything of it. She hadn’t mentioned anything to Harry about Malfoy messing up, or disappointing anyone.
Harry’s breath hitched in his throat and all he could hear was a ringing in his ears. He didn’t know how to respond, whether Draco actually meant that he was in love with Harry.
“Why not?” Asked Harry curiously, which caused a sigh of frustration from Malfoy as he made his way to a large bookshelf.
By the time they were able to see George, he had come around and been given some potions to help with the healing. Harry had insisted he wanted to stay out of the room, but Mr Weasley had made him come in.
“I must look good, you can’t take your eyes off me,” joked Harry. When Malfoy didn’t respond, he felt his heart rate quicken and his palms get sweaty. “I’m sorry, sir,” he then stuttered, looking at him with worried eyes. “I didn’t mean it.”
Finally, he found it, the object he had been looking for. A small, black ball that shone in the dim light. The surface was smooth, if Draco didn’t know what it was, he would’ve thought it was just another regular ornament.
“Things were simpler back then,” said Draco, his body tensing. “Especially in the first few years. It’s hard to let go of the times we could truly be kids.” Those words ran through Harry like ice. He had forgotten that Malfoy had grown up in such a strict household, his father forcing his opinions on him since such a young age. He remembered hearing that Malfoy had no friends before Hogwarts, and that must have taken a toll.
The floo powder brought him to the door of the house. A sweet cottage on the outskirts of London, where their children could run around and play happily. Harry knocked on the old wooden door, groaning as his head pounded after every knock. The fresh air wasn’t helping in the slightest.
Groggily Harry got up and opened it, and to his surprise, found Malfoy. He was dressed in casual clothes and waltzed into the room without asking permission to enter.
“I don’t want to be a minister,” whined Draco, leaning his head onto Harry’s shoulder. Cheeks starting to redden, Harry looked away from the beautiful woman sat before him, trying to hide his blush that made him feel like a child.
“Lucius would allow that?” asked Mrs Weasley as she plated up breakfast, plopping down plenty of eggs and toast on Draco’s plate.
Hermione was stood at the door, tears streaming down her own face as she watched the two men holding each other. Ron’s hands were placed on her shoulders gently, giving them a gentle squeeze every few seconds to remind her that he was there.
“Because you remind me of my childhood. You remind me of the good times, when I was actually happy,” stated Malfoy, a small hint of pink rushing to his cheeks as he confided in Harry, showing him his vulnerable side. “I want to go back to that often. Running around those halls, calling each other names, chasing after each other on the Quidditch pitch. No one else reminds me of the good times more than you do, Harry.”
“Thank you,” said Malfoy in a small voice, nodding to her and Ron before he headed towards the door.
“Are you kidding me? He’s a nightmare! It’s either we’re standing there for six hours straight or we’re constantly running around after him, making cups of tea and fetching paperwork!” complained Ron.
“I brought you tea,” said Harry softly, walking into the bedroom. They had gone to Ron and Hermione’s house, as it was the only place Draco didn’t have any connection to.
“Sorry, mate,” said George quietly, waving his wand to light a candle. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”
Harry almost couldn’t believe what he was reading. There had always been a huge conspiracy around Lucius’ reign, how he had managed to remain out of Azkaban all these years after being one of the most loyal Death Eaters. No one could ever think of how he had done it, but Harry had definitely heard theories centred around what he now knew to be the truth.
“Harry?” Malfoy was shocked, but Harry didn’t respond to him. Slowly, he understood, and squeezed Harry’s hand tighter.
Even so, that didn’t stop him from excusing himself from Narcissa to spend time with Malfoy in secret. Although, Narcissa knew, and she was very accepting of it. Whether Malfoy had told her about them Harry didn’t know, but he was thankful all the same.
“You’ve always been one to try and fix things, Harry,” she said. “Sometimes there are things you just can’t fix.”
“Mm,” Malfoy continued watching Harry, who shuffled on his seat uncomfortably, trying to avoid his stare. “Sometimes, on rare occasion, I see why you had lots of friends back at Hogwarts. But, if you tell anyone I just said that, you’ll be at the workhouses before you can cast Expelliarmus for the umpteenth time.”
“Why not? I could do with the company.” Harry managed to clamber onto the boat, his head spinning as he did. It was lovely inside, like a little home. There was a little table and some chairs, a kitchen area and a sofa.
“How’s life working for the Malfoy’s?” a familiar voice asked. Turning round, Harry saw Blaise Zabini in front of him. He was tall, he seemed taller now than at Hogwarts.
“Nothing,” replied Malfoy, his eyebrows knitting together. “I want you to go and see your brother. And Potter, you deserve an afternoon off, it’s been a tough week for you.” That was the truth. Lucius had purposely picked on Harry every day, ranging from shouting at him to hitting him. That, along with Malfoy being extra annoying because of deadlines he had, meaning Harry had to go to and from with him anywhere and everywhere, made his week very tough.
Narcissa was too pure for Lucius, thought Harry as he watched Draco slowly sip his tea with a small smile curling his lips. From his days working with her, he knew her heart was full of good. She took care of Harry, ensured he was safe in the manor, didn’t overwork him. Instead, they spent hours gossiping, planting flowers in their humongous garden and reminisced the ‘good days’.
“I have literally nothing else to do here,” laughed George. “They took away my wand. This is the only bit of magic we’re allowed to do; wizard’s chess is. It’s alright, though,” he smiled sadly.
Laughing, Malfoy shook his head once again, staring at the trees in the distance. “That’s the thing though, Harry. I can’t do that. I must follow orders, keep up a front, act as though I’m okay. I must pretend my demons aren’t constantly resurfacing, like I don’t have nightmares every night. Every time I get dressed, I see the Dark Mark sitting on my arm, a constant reminder of all the mistakes I made. I try to rub it off, I try to use magic, but nothing works. It permanently resides there, staring at me, forcing me to remember my best, forcing me to relive that fear.”
Hands shaking, Draco searched around his basement frantically. Beads of sweat dripped down from his forehead as he rummaged carefully through the artefacts that lay still, some with silk cloths over, others covered in dust. Today he had to handle business at Borgin and Burkes without Potter. The thought of Potter not being there caused him a flutter of panic. Maybe, Draco thought, he had gotten to used to the idea of Potter being by his side.
Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks once he had approached Harry, who’s vision was now going blurry from the pain. For a few moments, Malfoy was silent, just watching Harry who refused to look at him.
“I have trouble sleeping. It’s one of the potions the mind healers are trialling me on. Instructions tell me I have to take it at night for it to work, but it makes me wide awake and sleep all day.”
“You’re such a bore,” said Malfoy with a huff. Harry had never seen this side of him before, he was actually fun. He didn’t seem to care what anyone thought of him in that moment, he was enjoying chatting to Harry. But it was definitely the alcohol.
The only time he had truly felt seen, felt understood, was with Draco. Those few moments where they would speak about the past, almost comparing their experiences, brought comfort to him. Draco had been through so much more than Harry had realised during his Hogwarts years. The mental torture he had experienced from having Voldemort use the manor as his grounds followed him through to adulthood, leaving him with nightly terrors. There were a few times Harry had walked past a room with him and Draco had frozen, just for a few seconds, before continuing. There were rooms Draco refused to even enter, and Harry suspected they were rooms that had been used to torture witches and wizards.
“Now, I heard you two had a little field trip, is that right?” said Lucius through gritted teeth. Harry didn’t respond, but his breathing hitched and became staggered. “We were all incredibly worried as to where you had gotten to. Astoria had gone out of her mind, searching the manor, calling out Draco’s name. Now, why in the name of Salazar do you think you can go around, taking my son here, there and everywhere, without telling anyone else, hmm?”
“Sorting out her threads,” said Ron with a chuckle as the staff started to tidy away the cutlery, “what an easy job you have now, Harry.”
He didn’t bother knocking on the door. He knew Malfoy wouldn’t let anyone in. He had to ask him straight up, what was going on. What was he hiding from his father? What was he hiding from
The food arrived quickly, and the group started eating. Hermione and Astoria chatted away happily; Ron always seemed happy with the fact the two women got along well. He’d tell Harry while they were stood outside Malfoy’s office that Hermione was always excited to tell Ron about her day, about the conversations she and Astoria had, and he could never understand how she had so much fun. Both the men knew Hermione was a very chatty person, very confident, she could be friends with anyone. Astoria liked that about Hermione, and agreed with Hermione’s ideas, which made the two friends.
“I was contemplating putting in a transfer for one of your staff. Seamus Finnigan,” explained Blaise while looking between the two men, his eyebrows slightly raised.
Since the argument, Malfoy and Harry’s relationship was strained. Whenever Harry saw him, there was a thick tenseness in the air, and Harry didn’t like it one bit.
Without saying anything else, Malfoy raised his wand. Eyes closed, he took a few deep breaths, before saying, “Expecto patronum.”
The thought had his head swimming, his eyes constantly fuzzy. He could barely see Harry crouched in front of him, barely feel the hands that squeezed tightly onto his. But he appreciated every second Harry spent attempting to comfort him.
“Where did you hear that?” asked Harry, suddenly interested. He remembered those men in Malfoy’s office talking about that, but Malfoy had insisted the accusations were false. Surely Hermione couldn’t know about it?
Everyone was left in shock. It was dumbfounding to hear Draco speak about destroying Lucius’ career, after all those years at Hogwarts of Draco arguing about how great his father was.
“Yeah. Just seeing it go into the sky like that, makes me think about all the things in life Fred’s missing.”
Draco watched Harry, who slept peacefully in his bed. Though exhausted, Draco couldn’t find himself switching off. The room had been cast with a protection and noise cancelling spell to ensure Harry’s safety.
As he rushed around, something caught his eye. A book, sitting on his bedside table, a thin layer of dust covering the cover. Slowly, he picked it up, his hands beginning to shake.
“I’m not,” Malfoy’s face stayed serious, his tone unchanged. “The stuff I get involved in is dangerous, especially now. I can’t risk anything like this happening again. It’s not safe for me, Potter.”
“Whenever you are ready, son,” Lucius said, stepping back to allow Malfoy to take the limelight. For a moment he just stood, staring at the floor, building up the confidence. Then he walked forwards, standing in front of the Squib. Slowly raising his wand, Malfoy’s eyes began to tear up before he furiously blinked them away.
“How’s that?” Harry felt intrigued. Surely after all those years they tormented each other, after that day in the bathroom, Harry would be the last person to make Malfoy feel safe.
The sound of birds tweeting woke Harry up. Opening his eyes, he noticed the sky had begun to get light. He didn’t remember falling asleep.
Though Harry felt he hated Malfoy’s guts, he realised that his life must be tough. Everything he went through while they were at Hogwarts, for starters, then having to take over the Manor. He remembered Hermione telling him and Ron that Astoria was having problems conceiving, and he wondered if this was a big reason as to why Malfoy was so irritable. But Malfoy was always irritable, wasn’t he? Harry couldn’t help but wonder why. He had a beautiful wife, he was richer than any wizard Harry knew, he finally got what he wanted and had all Muggleborns and Half-Bloods now unable to do magic during the week. Why did he seem so… Lonely?
“Oh no,” said Harry as they both looked up. “That’s not a good sign.” Malfoy didn’t say anything, he just watched as lightning struck across the sky, lighting it up for a split second. Another loud clash, and then suddenly rain started pouring down onto their faces. Quickly Harry scrambled up, Malfoy took his time.
“You’d really let me?” asked Harry, looking up at the stranger. He had a kind face, light brown hair and had a short build. Similar height to Harry.
“I’d never have imagined being in the Weasley’s home,” said Draco, looking around with a smile he failed to hide, “it’s actually nicer than I expected.”
“That’s true, they’re so creepy,” said Ron, shuddering a little then groaning when one of George’s chess pieces destroyed his. “How are you getting better at this?”
Heartbeat quickening, Harry wondered why he was there. His mind raced back to the moment he woke up, realising Malfoy was no longer next to him, wondering whether the kiss was real. Whether Malfoy regretted it. Whether the relationship between Harry and Malfoy would be any different, now it was out in the open that Harry wanted to be with men.
After a few hours, Harry heard Malfoy call him into the office. Slowly Harry walked in, unsure what was about to happen. Surely Malfoy was angry at Harry now?
“Oh yeah, now that they’re the most powerful wizards in the Wizarding World?” said Ron sarcastically, rolling his eyes. “We’re dirt on their shoes.”
Once they had finished dinner, Harry found Hermione stood outside, watching the sunset. He had always thought she was beautiful, from the moment he met her when they were kids, to now. The gold light of the setting sun shone on her dark skin, making her look like an ethereal beauty.
“Oh, give over,” muttered Ron, shaking his head so vigorously his mop of ginger hair shook too. “It’s Malfoy.”
“Malfoy?” muttered Harry, making his presence known. Instantly Malfoy jolted up and looked at Harry, but he couldn’t hide the tears that were still dripping down his cheeks and the red puffy eyes.
Switching on the lamp next to him and putting on his glasses, Harry sat up in his bed. Now his heart was racing. Was this some sort of spell he hadn’t known of yet? One that was keeping tabs on Harry? Had someone found him, one of Lucius’ followers?
“You useless fucking half-blood,” Lucius spat in Harry’s face, then slapped him hard. “Harry fucking Potter. Salazar knows why my son argued to have you work for us,” Lucius lifted up his cane and whipped it on Harry’s cheek, cutting it open. Harry didn’t say anything. Back in Hogwarts, he would have fought back, had a snarky comment for Lucius before using Stupefy on him. But now, he remained silent, fixating on an object across the room to avoid the tears from streaming down his face. He didn’t want to cry because of the pain from Lucius’ cane. He wanted to cry because he could not believe this was now his life. His freedom had been completely stripped away from him, everything he and others fought for in Hogwarts, everything others had died for, all gone.
“Draco, you like him, don’t you?” Harry felt his heartbeat quicken. If it got any louder, he was sure the men would be able to hear him.
Harry watched out the window, looking at the people who were walking past. It was starting to liven up a bit now, there were families walking together, businessmen with their briefcases rushing by, mothers with pushchairs having a leisurely stroll. Harry enjoyed people watching, especially muggles. Their lives were so much simpler than Harry’s, they’d never understand what he had been through, what he was still going through. Their worries would be what shoes to wear, or how much money they could spend without going into their overdraft. Of course Harry knew they had bigger worries than that, but even those seemed so miniscule to what Harry had been through.
“To the Three Broomsticks. We need to get you drunk,” said Malfoy, before grabbing Harry’s hand and disapparating with a pop.
“None of your business, Weaselby,” laughed Malfoy as Harry dragged him into the office. He got him settled on the chair and picked up Malfoy’s coffee pot, tapping it with his wand to boil the water.
“You know how scary he is. I’m so sorry,” Malfoy’s hand gently grabbed onto Harry’s limp one, squeezing it tight. Slowly his thumb stroked Harry’s hand, soothing him, comforting him. It felt nice.
Breakfast was over quickly after that, and Harry walked with Ron to the office. They stood there for a while before Malfoy arrived, which was odd, he was always punctual. They heard the clicking of shoes after ten minutes, and Malfoy stormed down the corridor. Harry nearly audibly gasped when he saw Malfoy. He had a swollen lip and his hair was a mess. Harry didn’t say anything, he just watched Malfoy rush into the office and slam the doors shut behind him, making both Harry and Ron jump.
“We’re warning you again,” another man stepped forwards. It was the same man who he’d had a meeting with all those months ago in his office. The day Harry had saved him.
Harry’s breath was heavy as he slept. He looked gentle, as though nothing could harm him while he slept. Unlike when he was awake, the constant wrinkle of a frown creasing his forehead. It seemed Harry never relaxed his brow anymore.
“Live a little!” Malfoy looked back up at the sky and began to laugh. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d heard Malfoy laugh, not even in Hogwarts. He was always cracking the jokes but didn’t seem to laugh at many. His laugh sounded beautiful, Harry thought, the way it bellowed from his stomach. Even being drowned out by the rain Harry could still hear it, and it was infectious. Beginning to laugh too, Harry looked up at the sky, watching the lightning streak across in forks.
“We know you’re up to your dirty tricks again, Malfoy, you and your whole family.” This wizard had jet black hair which was slicked down in a combover. He wore a suit, not a very posh one, in a navy blue, which was the same as the other two wizards.
As the pasta boiled, he made his way round his quaint little cottage, checking everything was still in order. There was still a lot of paranoia left in Harry’s mind, he was still unable to let go of his past. The thoughts of someone breaking into his cottage while he was gone and stealing something he treasured, or someone awaiting his arrival home shrouded his mind and terrified him to the core. But, upon a quick inspection while his pasta cooked, everything seemed normal.
Harry walked down the dark corridors that twisted and winded around the manor. When he first arrived, he’d constantly get lost in these halls, unsure which turn to take next. They were like a maze. But now it was muscle memory, he knew exactly where to go to get to where he needed to be. He swore he could do it with his eyes closed.
“I’ll order ours, too,” said Harry, giving the group a small smile before getting up and heading to the bar. Malfoy was visibly angry, his shaking hands were grasping the edge of the table, his injured knuckles turning white. The skin on his knuckles seemed worse than Harry had ever seen them.
Harry didn’t know what to say, but Malfoy wasn’t expecting a response. Instead, Harry lay down too, his arms by his side. For a while, they lay in silence, and it felt right. Just the small sound of Malfoy’s breathing, heavier due to the alcohol he had consumed.
“I’m so sorry, Harry,” he said. There was a sincerity in his voice, and after sniffing, Harry realised he was crying. “I wanted to stop him.”
Excitedly, Harry set out to the canal. There was nothing he missed more than boating. He’d picked up the hobby after he’d left Hogwarts, becoming interested when he had made a friend who sailed.
“Ginny wanted children, too,” said Harry, playing with the rim of his coffee cup with his finger. “Two. A boy and a girl. But our relationship didn’t work out. Same sort of situation, there were things I hadn’t fully realised when I was younger. My childhood didn’t really leave room for me to discover myself, it left me feeling lost…” Harry trailed off, shaking his head with a small smile curling his thin lips. “Sorry, I’m getting personal.”
“Potter,” Malfoy called from inside the office. Holding in an annoyed sigh, Harry walked into the office.
“I’m sure it won’t be as bad as it was in Hogwarts,” chuckled Harry to his friend as they continued walking through the windy corridors.
“Oh, I will, Mr Malfoy,” Caractacus started doing the maths for the money. Thankfully, it was a lot more than Draco was expecting. His father would be very pleased about that.
“I’m not in the mood, George,” said Harry, but the light didn’t go away. It got closer to him, and he swore this time he could see two eyes peering at him. But again, the light flickered, and went out.
“I have decided who I want to take over the ministry,” said Draco with a bold voice, “if they will accept the position.”
He made his way to the office, and just before he opened the door, he heard voices. Voices he didn’t recognise. Carefully he pressed his ear up to the door.
They entered the Three Broomsticks, noticing a few wizards and witches who would be studying at Hogwarts there. This excited Hermione, seeing the next generation of wizards and witches. Harry didn’t have the heart to remind her if they were half-blood or muggleborn, they’d just end up the same as the trio, trapped.
Harry got up and walked out of the office before turning round, his brows knitted together in a frown. “Malfoy?”
“You can trust me,” said Harry, now stepping into the office. “I wouldn’t do anything to jeopardise my position.”
“Of course. Good day, gentlemen,” said Malfoy, coolly waving his wand to open the doors. The men left, and Harry took a deep breath. Malfoy got up and walked over to Harry. He could feel Malfoy’s breath on his ear as the blond-haired man leaned down.
“I never get to see dad, though,” moaned Ron, still a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Harry, dad wants to say hi to you.”
“It’s me. We fell asleep. I don’t know what time it is but it’s early. We need to go back to the manor.”
Malfoy’s thin figure swiftly made its way down the halls. Today he wasn’t wearing robes, he was wearing what Harry liked to think as a classic Draco Malfoy outfit, a black turtleneck sweater with a blazer. Every so often Malfoy would dress more casual for work around the office, specifically if he wasn’t expecting to see anyone or didn’t have any errands to run. This wasn’t common, though, as Malfoy was now extremely busy with dealing with everything his father left behind when he became the minister.
“He understands how hard this situation can be for you. After everything you have been through since such a young age. It’s understandable you need a moment,” said Narcissa with a soft, motherly smile. “And I know my being here may be hard, too.”
He stood outside the office again with Ron, hands behind his back. Slowly he moved his head from side to side, his neck cracking as he did. The position caused him to seize up all the time, making his shoulders and neck ache.
“You need to get over it,” said Harry sternly, unable to hide how irritated he felt. “You can’t rely on me forever.”
“Here,” said Malfoy, carefully handing Harry the robe. “Put this on.” Malfoy turned and headed out of the door, closing only one to give Harry some privacy. He slipped the robe on over his clothes, feeling the material in his hands. It was soft, almost like velvet, it was certainly very expensive.
“That’s a shame. Keep me updated, please. Potter,” Malfoy turned and started to walk towards the hallways. Ron and Harry shared a very confused look to each other before Harry rushed to catch up to Malfoy. He admired the way Malfoy would glide along the floor, his robes moving freely around his body. His movements were so swift, so gentle. Once again Harry noticed his confident walk, staring straight forward, chin raised, just like always. He recognised where they were heading, back into that basement room that had all those strange artefacts.
After a few hours, it certainly looked more homely. Cluttered, but homely. Harry would have to get used to it.
“Here you are,” smiled Mr Weasley, handing Harry a glass of whiskey, snapping him out of his thoughts.
“It appears so. I think usual night shift was sick,” explained Ron. “Seamus had to cover. I saw him when I needed to use the loo a few hours ago.”
“Fine, fine!” surrendered Harry with his hands up, “I just need to do this first,” he took the cup and downed the rest of the brew, grunting as he slammed the glass down on the table. Malfoy cheered him, clapping his hands and laughing, causing Ron and Hermione to look over at them with a confused stare.
Harry had been following the wolf for twenty minutes. Gradually, the wolf was fading, and Harry feared that at any moment it would completely disappear. How it had arrived to him had Harry thinking Draco was injured, and where he was, Harry didn’t know. All he could do was follow the patronus, who’s light was becoming more and more dim.
“Adding more rules in that haven’t been enforced, sending more Muggleborns to be obliviated. It’s not a rule for them to be, only Squibs,” the man tried to explain.
After packing away the plates and washing up, it was now time for the butlers to have their breakfast. They all sat in the Manor’s kitchen with the cooks, eating eggs and toast. This was one of Harry’s favourite times of the day, because they were all together and they knew they had some time to themselves.
“Probably looks better on me than you,” retorted Harry, almost instantly regretting it. Things weren’t the same as they were at Hogwarts, answering Malfoy back in a sarcastic tone was no longer accepted.
Raising Draco’s head slightly, Harry pressed the cup to his lips, letting the cold water enter Draco’s mouth.
“Whoever uses it can change the future of who they are telling the future of. It can result in death if the caster so wishes,” said Malfoy. Harry felt his blood boil. Why would Malfoy sell something like this to Mr Borgin, who would just sell it to someone else? Why didn’t Malfoy just keep it in his manor with all those other artefacts? He stayed silent, but felt his hands begin to shake.
“You underestimate me, Potter,” he responded, a twinkle in his eye as he looked at Harry, before moving his gaze out of the window.
Malfoy took a few moments to respond. “No,” he finally said, looking down at the floor. “Maybe some help with tidying up.”
After changing into something more comfortable, Harry then floo’d himself to the pub. Already there were Ron and Hermione, with their two children, Hugo and Rose. Along with them, Neville sat. He joined in every so often, after his wife, Hannah, became the new landlady. Harry was always happy to see any of his old Hogwarts alumni.
“It’s awful,” grumbled Ron, taking a big swig of his butterbeer. “Bloody Malfoy. Him and his family are just so rude. They don’t care about anyone but themselves. Malfoy sometimes makes fun because we were always fighting at Hogwarts.”
Harry returned to his post after taking a much needed, and approved by Malfoy, toilet break. The door was ajar, unlike how it was when he left. Eyebrows furrowing together, Harry thought Malfoy must have gone out to use the toilet himself, or maybe go and get something from his father’s office. But upon approaching the doors, he heard muffled voices. More than one.
“I saw Pansy on and off while we were at Hogwarts, and I had a fling with Blaise and a few Slytherin girls, but I never settled until I got with Astoria,” admitted Malfoy, the words slipping off his tongue so easily Harry had barely noticed he’d admitted being with a man. “And now I’m unhappy in my marriage.”
“I can’t heal you as father will know. All I can do is allow you to rest. So please, go back to your room. Get some sleep. I’ll see you tomorrow morning,” and with a nod, Malfoy walked into his office and closed the large doors behind him, leaving Harry feeling very confused.
Harry changed into his butler clothes. Since being upgraded to bodyguard, he wore more comfortable clothes, something that if he needed to quickly save Malfoy’s life would be easy to do so in. He had forgotten how uncomfortable the collar of the suit was and how hot the waistcoat made him.
“Pull…” was all Draco could manage before he closed his eyes. Harry started pulling out the pins and throwing them aside, desperately talking to Draco to try and keep him conscious.
On the floor, lay a limp body. It took a few moments for Draco to register what was happening. Then, his knees buckled beneath him, and he clattered to the floor.
“What the fuck, Malfoy?” said Harry angrily as he stormed after him in the streets of Knockturn Alley. This place always scared him. It reminded him of when he was only twelve and accidentally ended up there. The figures that he saw still sometimes haunted his dreams, and he didn’t want to relive that today.
The sounds of birds woke him up. Grumbling to himself, he pulled himself out of bed and grabbed his wand. Nothing felt better than that to him. Flicking his wand, he opened the curtains to the living room and headed into the kitchen, flicking his wand again to make the kettle boil. Things sure are so much easier using magic, he thought.
“It’s just, today’s a visiting day for George. Stupid place only allows people to visit in the week. I was hoping to floo myself there during staff dinner and see him for half an hour maybe, but I think it’ll be too late.” Ron looked at Harry. There was a desperate look in his eyes, his face was scrunched up as if he was in pain. Harry knew how much Ron had wanted to see George, but he hadn’t been able to ever since he was admitted to the mind healing facility. There was only visitation once a week and Ron hadn’t been able to go to any of them.
So, he sheepishly walked over to the bed and sat next to Draco, who tightly kept their hands locked together.
“Thank you, Mrs Weasley,” said Harry, then he looked over at Mr Weasley, “you too, Mr Weasley. I’m so grateful for everything you do for me.”
“One red ribbon means suspected danger. Two means there is definite danger, but it isn’t urgent. Three means urgent danger. One yellow ribbon means an unexpected meeting from my father is or has taken place. Two means it is a private meeting. Three means it is an obvious illegal meeting with former Death Eaters. One blue ribbon means he has been ignoring laws regarding ex Death Eaters. Two means he has obliviated a muggleborn. Three means he has obliviated a half-blood,” Draco stopped for a moment, shaking his head.
The two had moved into a manor of their own, much smaller than the one Draco had grew up in, but still much larger than anywhere Harry had ever thought he’d end up. Every Friday night, they invited over all of the Weasleys, including Molly, Arthur and George, for a dinner before the weekend began.
He couldn’t imagine the emotions Draco would be going through right now. On one hand, he would be glad to see his father get taken down, for the wizarding world in England to be restored back to it’s glory it was in before Lucius took over. But Draco did love his father dearly, he always had and always would. Lucius was his idol ever since he was a very young boy, and Lucius did love Draco. Maybe less over the years, and especially less as Draco got older and started to rebel. But he had always given Draco as much love as his cold heart was able to and had done everything Draco had needed.
First, Draco thought back to his wedding with Astoria. The way she looked when he walked down in the isle, the proud smiles of his mother and father. The way they held hands throughout the whole ceremony, how Astoria’s hazel brown eyes didn’t leave Draco’s face as they spoke their vows to each other.
Two pairs of eyes stared at Draco for a considerable amount of time, before gingerly reaching for the large book. Harry was eager to read, and quickly rushed round the table and stood behind the Weasleys, watching as they slowly flicked through the pages.
After getting himself dressed, Harry decided to go to Ron and Hermione’s. Hermione always made the best cup of tea, and that’s exactly what Harry needed right now. Not trusting himself to disapparate in his current state, Harry made his way through the manor to floo himself to the couple’s house.
“You don’t realise how much I needed to say it,” chuckled Malfoy, giving him a small nod. “I’ll see you soon, Potter,” he said, before opening the door and walking out of Harry’s room without looking back, leaving Harry alone to sit and digest the day's events.
George nodded in response. Their hands gripped together, comforting each other. Sometimes it felt as though George was the only person who could understand the pain Harry had been through, losing someone as close as a twin.
Peeking his head round the door, Harry’s eyes widened at the sight. There were three men, all a lot larger than he and Malfoy, surrounding him. Malfoy was sat in his grand office chair, which was all black and leather and looked comfortable, except for in this situation. Two of the men had their wands out, while a beefier looking wizard questioned him.
“How are you and Astoria?” asked Harry after a while. Malfoy seemed to tense up, his eyes staring out of the window, watching the small amount of bodies passing by.
“Better than the workhouses,” mentioned Mrs Weasley, popping the chopped carrots into the pot. She was right, but it was something everyone always said if Harry complained about working for the Malfoys. He felt very lucky he didn’t have to work in the workhouses, he thanked Ron and Hermione every day for managing to get him the job.
“I wish I wasn’t,” replied Harry as they made their way back to the kitchen area of their home. Both Mr and Mrs Weasley had spent so many months rebuilding their home after it got burned down all those years ago. Ron and Harry had helped of course, and it was back to the way it was before, if not better.
“Thank you,” came a small voice from the corner of the room. Harry looked over at Malfoy, who was now stood up and heading over to Harry.
“Would you like to? I’ll let you come along for the ride. I’m only going until the next docks, probably an hour or so.”
Draco helped out in Hogwarts from time to time, sometimes covering the Potions classes, and would teach a few Defence Against the Dark Arts classes for his occlumency skills.
Draco didn’t want that for himself anymore. After the war, he re-evaluated how everyone saw him. No longer was he the frightened boy who was forced to follow Voldemort’s orders. Instead, he was brave, quiet, he kept himself to himself. In some sense, he wanted everyone to fear him, rather than laugh at him. And, to his genuine surprise, it worked. Though, he wasn’t sure whether people feared him for how he now portrayed himself, or for the fact his father was one of Voldemort’s most loyal followers, and Draco had seen more in two years than most wizards and witches would see in their lifetimes.
“I told you to sit,” interrupted Malfoy, pointing to the chairs that businessmen usually sat on while waiting to see him. Slowly Harry managed to sit down, his whole body trembling from the throbbing pain in his cheek. He was sure it had started bleeding again from him talking, but he didn’t want to be seen as weak. He didn’t want Malfoy to laugh at him.
“One moment,” called Harry, his voice wavering as he spoke. After wiping his face, he opened the door to find Narcissa stood there.
The door opened and Hermione’s beautiful face peeked round. “Harry!” She called, opening the door wider.
“Oh no, too much drinking with Malfoy,” said Ron, sitting next to Harry while Hermione went to make a pot of tea.
Taking a running dive, Harry’s body landed on his soft double bed. Instantly he curled up his body, hugging one of the pillows.
“I hate this place. I really hate it,” said Hermione, Harry could tell she was crying. Pulling her at arm’s length, he attempted a smile.
“He’s drunk, we just need to get him to bed. He’s too tall for mum and dad,” explained Ron. Nodding quickly, Harry and Ron rushed into the lounge, where George was sprawled across one of the sofas. They both hauled him up and stuck to each side of George, who could barely move his feet at this point. They just about managed to clamber up the stairs with him and throw him down onto his bed.
“Can you hear me?” whispered Harry, but Draco didn’t respond. Harry pulled Draco’s body close, tracing the lines that decorated Draco’s torso with his finger. “I’m so sorry I left. I should have stayed. I’ve made everything so much worse for you. I’m so sorry, Draco. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
Malfoy paused again. “You seem like you want to continue that sentence.” His eyes studied Harry. The way his fists clenched weakly, the way his breathing was staggered, how he couldn’t look Malfoy in the face.
Harry always admired how Malfoy would just walk away, expecting whoever was with him to follow. And, of course, they always did. There was something so alluring about him, Harry found himself wanting to be around Malfoy more and more these days. He was exciting, full of surprises, but even their silences together felt comforting to Harry.
Malfoy stayed silent for a while, arms folded, just staring at Harry. The air was tense, and Malfoy staring certainly didn’t help. All Harry could do was look down at the ground, attempting to fight away the tears that threatened to fall. His emotions were heightened, he kept them in so often due to his past that he didn’t know what to do when they threatened to be released.
“Let me have a look at your ribs,” Malfoy attempted to change the subject, but Harry wasn’t having any of it.
As Harry overthought every word that was said, Malfoy’s slim fingers slowly found their way to Harry’s and, carefully, their fingers intertwined together perfectly.
“Yes,” Ron opened the door and Malfoy stepped inside. Harry could see his knuckles were bleeding and he was still picking at them now.
“I’ll continue doing my job, it was nice to speak to you, Mr Zabini,” said Harry before walking off.
for him. The shame Malfoy would feel if there was anything else to their relationship aside from Harry being his staff.
Harry’s mind swam with possibilities. What if Malfoy was attempting to take over the ministry himself, just to implement more torturous activities towards squibs and muggleborns? What if Malfoy was saving up to move away, far, far away, and leave Harry behind?
At already three years old, Scorpius fit in perfectly, especially since his hair was white blond like Draco’s. Something Harry would never not find amusing.
“Yes sir,” said Harry, causing Malfoy’s grin to get wider, before he headed back to his room. He and Malfoy had been spending more time together, purely platonic, but the closer they got the more Harry felt butterflies. Would it have been like this back when they were eleven?
They managed to make their way back to the office, where Ron stood up tall when he saw them, but instantly had a face of confusion.
“So,” said Malfoy, handing Harry another drink, this time of wizard’s brew. “Amuse me. What’s the real reason you and Ginny broke up?”
Malfoy stared at Harry for some time, his jaw clenched, before he began to relax. “My life is a mess, Harry,” he said. The use of Harry’s first name made his heart flutter, made him think maybe Malfoy did trust him. “Mine and Astoria’s marriage is falling apart. We’re struggling with conceiving a child. We’re hardly talking now; our conversations are one sided and that’s my fault. Things are falling apart with the manor, father’s extra cruel,” Malfoy laughed at himself. Why, after all these years, was he still afraid of his father? He was an adult now, but the anxiety still built up in him whenever he was near Lucius.
“Mr Malfoy,” said Mr Borgin, a smile on his terrifying face, his brown teeth gritted together. “How can I help you today, sir?”
Ginny was hardly ever around anymore, as she was now a professional Quidditch player for the Holyhead Harpies. She was consistently travelling for matches, which was a shame because her company was always greatly appreciated by the group. Though, Harry knew Ron was very jealous of Ginny. Only he had been affected by the new order out of all the Weasley’s, mostly because being an Auror didn’t pay too greatly, and partially because he had married a Muggleborn. It irked Ron to no end, and he always was saying he wished he had decided to work at the ministry instead, because this wouldn’t have happened.
“You were in a state, Mal- sir,” Harry corrected himself quickly. “I won’t ask why. I don’t know why I was worried, to be truthful.”
Harry turned on the spot, showing Malfoy the fit of the suit. He stood there, his arms crossed, his one finger trailing along his lips in thought. Malfoy continued to stare at Harry, his eyes watching him intently.
“Ronald,” said George, holding him for a long time. Harry stood back awkwardly, looking to the ground, trying to avoid the view of the brothers embracing. He felt as though he was interrupting. Once the two broke free, George looked at Harry with a gentle smile.
“I know it’s hard for you to say that,” smirked Harry, which was greeted with a chuckle from Malfoy.
“I need you to stand watch,” instructed Malfoy, pointing towards the door without looking at Harry. “No one is allowed down here. It’s strictly out of bounds, and you are not allowed to tell anyone what is down here.”
As soon as Harry entered the staff dining room, Hermione was by his side, pulling him into a warm hug.
“Yes, isn’t she a beauty? She’s a Narrowboat, helps to get round these tight canals. Do you go sailing?”
“Expecto patronum,” said Draco, holding his wand out confidently and steadily. Nothing. Not even a beam of light.
“It was a weird night,” sighed Harry, closing his eyes and rubbing the temples on his forehead. If only the pain would just go away.
“I seem to say this a lot lately, but thanks, Potter,” said Malfoy once the office was back to its original condition.
“Draco,” said Harry gently, placing a hand on his shoulder from behind. Jumping, Draco spun round to face the shorter man.
“What are you doing?” Harry sat up now. Shaking his head, Draco placed the book back into the chest.
Harry would have given Ron a snarky comment back, but his mind was far too preoccupied. Malfoy had been doing these dealings
“Oh, you know, the usual,” huffed Hermione, blowing strands of her locks out of her face. “Having to run around after Malfoy’s wife. But you know, she isn’t too bad,” she shrugged slightly. “I mean, she disagrees with Lucius’ ideas. She’s always going on about them. She’s quite friendly to us.”
“True. But when isn’t he quiet, really? You’d think he’d be happy that his father is running the Wizarding World. You’d think he’d be happy that Muggleborns and Half-Bloods are tortured.”
“Fetch me the paperwork from my father’s office.” He didn’t even look up when he spoke. Harry exited the dark room and made his way over to Lucius’ office.
Though happy to be home, the cottage seemed empty. It was so quiet; the lights were all off and the curtains all drawn. Harry flicked his wand again, making all the lights switch on simultaneously. He pondered into the kitchen, yawning as he did, and looked through his cupboards. He knew Mrs Weasley would have left him some food; she did every year since he started at Hogwarts. She was the only person allowed into his cottage during term time. In the cupboard Harry found some pasta, which was perfect for what he needed right now, something sustainable and quick to cook.
Opening the door, Harry felt his whole body freeze. He stared at the tall figure in front of him, not blinking, not moving. In front of him stood Draco Malfoy.
Though the storm sounded scary, it brought Harry an immense feeling of comfort. He dragged the mattress over to the window and lay down, watching the forks of lightning decorate the dark sky.
“That’s a shame. Maybe I can get a transfer so they can work together,” smiled Blaise. Harry could tell he cared for his staff, just like Astoria did with her maids.
“I can also issue you with protection from the organisation, too, to ensure your safety. I’d also like you to be involved, to help with the planning of taking my father down. Your work in the Order was exceptional and obviously proved to be successful,” said Draco.
“Are you looking forward to going home, Harry?” Asked Hermione, an attempt at changing the subject. Of course he was, Harry thought. There was nothing better than the weekends when he can sleep in his own, comfortable bed, his wand by his side. The days he can use magic, floo himself to the Leaky Cauldron and have a butterbeer with Ron and Hermione. Every day he missed his apartment, even if it wasn’t luxurious, even if it wasn’t a sweet homely cottage he had always dreamed of.
“I said I forgive you,” repeated Malfoy, staring at the empty dark brown wall. Then, he moved his hand over to Harry’s and placed it on top, giving his hand a firm squeeze. “Please remember that.”
“Nonsense. You’re going to stay in the attic. We will cast protection spells on it every hour to ensure no one can track you down. But you are not to leave the attic until we know you are safe,” Mr Weasley’s voice had a sternness to it.
“Oh, how I’ve missed you,” he softly spoke to his bed. His own bed. At his own apartment. Harry did not want to move now; he never did at the weekends. But, he had plans to meet up with some friends at the Leaky Cauldron, so his bed would have to wait until tonight.
Draco stood from the table and walked to an empty space. Placing something down on the floor, he took out his wand and gave it a tap. He felt shocked the Weasley’s didn’t even blink when he pulled his wand, and part of him wanted to cry from the emotion it brought him. But he didn’t, what he had to say was far more important.
“Sit,” said Harry, gently taking one of his pale hands and slowly leading Draco over to the table. Sighing in a pretence of being annoyed, Draco sat and stared at the teacup. Harry sat opposite him and watched.
Being back in the shared bathrooms irritated Harry. On days like these, he had to trek in the cold wearing nothing but a dressing gown, which was even worse when he walked back to his room.
He stood; his wand held towards the Squib. His hand was visibly shaking. Memories flashed back in Harry’s mind to the night in the astronomy tower, and there was no doubt Malfoy was thinking the same thing.
“This is homely,” scoffed Ron as he looked around the room. After two weeks, the attic had gotten a small makeover. Still the boxes stayed shoved against the walls, but Harry now had an actual bed and a chest of drawers for his clothes.
“Come in, Mrs Malfoy,” said Harry as he stepped aside from the door. Narcissa walked in slowly, her long black dress flowing elegantly behind her.
“Father,” nodded Malfoy, walking to the centre of the room. There was a chair there, with a person on who Harry guessed was the Squib. He was tied up, a gag in his mouth, eyes wide with fear and streaming with tears.
“Me too. Your visit with Ron cheered me up, even if it was brief. Brought some normality back. But I’m definitely way better at wizard’s chess now, so Ron better watch out,” chuckled George.
“No, no, Narcissa. He must learn,” Lucius’ bony fingers placed themselves on Malfoy’s shoulders, squeezing them tightly, fingernails digging into his clothes so firmly they threatened to break the skin that lay underneath.
“The Wizarding World was a mess before he stepped in. Especially after Hogwarts,” Theo shook his head. “The way it is now is brilliant.”
“It appears the Muggleborns didn’t have a job, so instead of being sent to the workhouses, the Healers took them in,” Lucius shook his head. “Disgusting.”
Smiling, Narcissa nodded. “Oh. Of course, Mr Potter,” she said, and just as Harry was about to leave the room, she called, “tell my son I said hello.”
Once they had set sail, Harry joined Ryan on the deck. Ryan even let Harry take control of the boat, ensuring it didn’t veer off course, while he made them cups of tea. They both sat, the sun warming their bodies up, sipping tea on the deck.
“Get back in there,” sneered Lucius, pushing Harry back into the dining room. Hermione from across the room audibly gasped, her cheeks going red as she looked down, avoiding eye contact with Lucius. Harry knew how terrified she was recently, after finding out the possibility that Lucius was Obliviating Muggleborns. Hermione tried her hardest not to step out of line, to do everything right, as if she was back in Hogwarts studying for an exam.
Harry found himself falling asleep with his clothes still on, his mind whirring with thoughts about Malfoy.
“I know you, Malfoy, even if you act like I don’t. This is dangerous territory. If your father found out-”
“Thank you for telling me that,” said Harry in a small voice. “You don’t realise how much I needed to hear it.”
“Malfoy, your father wants to see us. Both of us,” said Harry with nervousness in his voice. Malfoy froze, mid-sentence that he was writing. For a few moments, he didn’t move, he just stared down at the sheet of paper until his eyes went blurry. Then, he slowly looked up at Harry.
“I don’t think it’s true, you know,” said Harry, noticing his words were starting to string together from the alcohol. The warm air had hit him when he had walked outside, and all the alcohol he had drank was now noticeable.
“Oh Hermione, I do adore your children,” complimented Astoria as she gushed over the two, who were happily chatting away. “Draco and I are trying to have children.”
Harry ended up passing Ron on his way, which seemed odd, because Malfoy should be in his office at this point. Ron was just as confused, saying Malfoy had dismissed him and to do work with Astoria instead. This worried Harry more, and he almost ran to Malfoy’s office.
They sat down at a table, trying to decide on what to have for lunch. The kids were as restless as ever, constantly arguing with each other. At one point Hugo pulled Rose’s hair, causing her to squeal, and for Hermione to get stern with them.
“You need to think of your happiest memory,” explained Harry as he pulled out his wand. “I’ve used the same one for years. It’s something I’m still unsure even was a memory. It’s of my mum and dad,” Harry smiled as he began to let the memory consume him. Then, he held out his wand, and said “Expecto patronum.”
“You haven’t been able to have lunch yet, Potter. Can’t have you fainting like you’ve seen a dementor on me,” there was a twinkle in Malfoy’s eyes as he said that and a smirk attempted to pull at his lips, but he controlled it. Harry looked back down at the soup, also trying his best not to smile, before picking up the spoon and beginning to eat. He heard Malfoy sigh and looked back up, seeing him with his head in his hands.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” replied Harry, his voice cracking. Suddenly, Astoria was by Malfoy’s side, and she fussed over him intently.
“We are holding a funeral for Astoria in two days time,” explained Narcissa in a soft voice, “but today there is something we need you to do.”
“Sit down, would you like a cup of tea?” asked Mrs Weasley, to which Harry responded in a shake of the head. She sat opposite him, an inquisitive look on her gentle face.
“They’ll be here soon, you need to get changed,” instructed Malfoy, a small smile still lingering on his plump lips as he looked at Harry.
“I’m unsure,” he looked back out the window, a frown creasing his forehead. “I just know it doesn’t feel right with her, which makes it difficult for us to try and have a child. Which, is something she really wants.”
“I’m still unable to find myself, though, Potter. As soon as I left Hogwarts, I was hated. People tried to curse me on the streets when I’d just be trying to meet our accountant. I had to hide all the time, I ended up never leaving the manor. And then my father became the minister, and it just got worse,” shaking his head, Malfoy finished his drink and stood up. “Let’s go,” he said before walking past the table and exiting the coffee shop.
His face was red and crumpled, his eyes brimming with tears threatening to fall with the next blink.
“Of course you can stay,” chimed Mr Weasley with a large smile, “with only George around and Molly and I getting old, it’s hard to keep up the housekeeping.”
“No, thank you,” replied Malfoy. Nodding, Harry made himself a cup anyway, tapping the teapot with his wand to boil the water. He looked back over at Malfoy, who was staring at the fire that was lit. It illuminated his ghostly face, his white-blonde hair looking more yellow from the flames, his grey eyes warmer but still sad and lost looking. The same eyes that had stared at Dumbledore with the same sadness to them moments before his death.
“I know,” replied Malfoy, handing the cash over to the woman before smiling and turning around, heading straight over to a seat in the window.
Having a few remaining members of the Order on his side, helping him think things through made Draco feel exceptionally positive. More positive than he had felt in months, maybe even years.
A few years after the battle, before Lucius Malfoy took over the ministry, George had taken a turn for the worse. The Weasleys and everyone around them knew he wasn’t doing well anyway, but it was so sudden. After Fred died, he had always been quiet and emotionally numb. He had stopped pranking, closed down their shared joke shop and become a recluse. There was hardly a time anyone saw a smile on George’s face. He’d lost his smile after Fred died.
“You make me feel safe, Harry,” slowly Malfoy lay down on the wet grass at the foot of the loch. “You calm me down. I can be myself around you.”
Harry finally made it back to the manor. Malfoy had given him the rest of the day off, so he was able to just crawl into bed. Though, as soon as his head hit the pillow, bad thoughts whirred round. All he could think about was George, being in that place, having to talk through his emotions every day. Having to talk about losing his twin, his sidekick, his everything. Groaning loudly, Harry decided to get up and wander about the manor, something he was thankfully allowed to do on his days off. He always made sure to avoid the areas that were restricted to him, he didn’t want to get into trouble, and most of the time he just walked along the staff quarters.
“Because you’re having arguments with Astoria. I’m just a little plaything until everything’s sorted out, aren’t I?”
Malfoy scoffed. “You, worried about me?” he almost laughed and shook his head, a few strands of blonde hair falling into his face as he did. “Unbelievable.”
“You two are so bloody weird. Always blushing around each other, sharing weird looks,” Ron shook his head, “like a pair of schoolgirls.”
“Of course not. This is Lucius Malfoy we are talking about, Harry. He would do anything to destroy the Muggleborns, you and I both know that.”
“Oh, my darling,” said Narcissa softly, running her fingers through his messy blonde hair. “You’re being so strong. Has Mr Potter been taking care of you?”
“200 Galleons,” said Mr Borgin and Harry nearly choked. Nodding, Malfoy accepted that offer with no questions, and Mr Borgin handed him the money after very carefully, and slowly, counting it. The two men left the shop.
The trio had a nice morning, Hermione made them a light lunch and they chatted like nothing was wrong with the Wizarding World. These were some of Harry’s favourite times. Moments like these were extremely rare for him to come by now, and he cherished every single one.
“If you don’t, you need to name someone. You were the leader of this operation, Draco. You are the one who has to finish everything up.”
“You haven’t,” said Harry, shaking his head before turning back around and walking towards the bed. “I could have killed you. All you did was just say mean things. You saved my life, Malfoy, that day in the manor. You stopped them from calling You Know Who on me,” Harry looked at him again. He’d never spoken to anyone about this before, not even Ron or Hermione. The shame was embedded so deeply into him, he didn’t know he even
“No, don’t do that,” said Malfoy quickly, helping him lay back down carefully. “Let me help you.” Malfoy got up and switched on the lamp, making Harry groan as his head throbbed for the first time since he had woken up. The noise of Malfoy scrabbling about made Harry smile. He had gone into the bathroom and grabbed a cloth, got out Harry’s pyjamas and found a new pillowcase.
“I’d leave them alone,” she said sadly, attempting a gentle smile and squeezing Harry’s hand, “we don’t want Lucius catching you with him, as much as my son would do better with you by his side. Better than anyone else, I think.”
And then, Lucius struck Harry. Hard, with the silver snake head that sat at the top of his cane. The force knocked Harry to the ground and Lucius proceeded to beat him, kicking him in the ribs over and over, before kicking him once in the face.
“How’s Malfoy?” asked Ron quietly as the two men stood in front of the mirrors, brushing their teeth.
Harry entered the familiar home, the comforting smell of cooking coming from the kitchen. This weekend was going to be a nice one, he was spending it with the Weasley’s. Nowadays he hardly ever saw them, he was either too exhausted to go to their house and just wanted to sleep all weekend, or he was busy seeing everyone else in his life. The Weasley’s, though, still treated him like their own son, and he was forever grateful for that.
“We understand,” smiled Hermione, standing up and giving Harry a big hug. Malfoy just watched, his fingers heading towards his knuckles and playing with the already bleeding skin. Hermione noticed. “Would you like something for your hands, Mr Malfoy?” She asked gently.
“Isn’t it? It’s a great way to escape the world for a while, just watch everything go by. I started boating when I got divorced. I needed something to help me through the rough times, and it really did,” explained Ryan with a gentle smile. “Maybe you should look into it.”
He looked at the wolf one last time, a lump in his throat, as he nodded. The wolf faded. Harry was alone. He didn’t know whether Draco would be able to build up the strength to produce a full body patronus, which was exactly what Harry needed in order to find him.
“Here you are, sir,” said Harry, placing the papers in front of Malfoy. He didn’t respond, his lips pressed together, staring down at the other papers that were scattered on his desk. For a split moment, Harry watched Malfoy. The infamous blonde hair slicked back neatly, tucked behind his ears. It had grown a small length since he had been at Hogwarts, reaching just above his shoulders, and always looked tidy. Malfoy’s grey eyes shone in the dim light, even while looking down, something that seemed completely mesmerising to Harry.
Harry spun his wand in his hand, grinning as the wood felt heavy, his hand feeling warm. A perk of the job is being able to have his wand again. Nothing felt better to him.
“Ron and Hermione let me crash at theirs,” answered Harry as he rubbed his hair with the towel. Nodding, Malfoy slowly took off his blazer, keeping it in his hands as he looked around.
“What in the name of Salazar are you talking about?” scoffed Lucius, turning his head with a smirk forming on his lips.
Pulling away after a few moments, Harry’s green eyes desperately searched the icy grey ones that glimmered in front of him.
“So, what is it you do now, Draco?” questioned Pansy as the butlers swung into action, serving food. Harry was serving the wine.
“Stupefy!” all the ministers said at once, making Lucius fly back and hit the wall. But, the spell was already cast.
“I’d say so,” Hermione finally picked up her fork and stabbed it into her food. “Stops them from conceiving even more evil into the world.”
The door swung open and Harry stormed in. For a moment, Malfoy’s expression read pure horror as all the blood drained from his face.
“Mrs Hermione Weasley,” said Draco, looking over to the small woman who stood next to her husband. Her face was shocked, full lips in the shape of an o. She wasn’t expecting it. And by the gasping response of the room, neither was anyone else.
It seemed to be some kind of citizens advice meeting, but Harry wasn’t too sure, it had been so long since Harry had been in the real world and had to face real problems. Everything was so hidden to the Muggleborns and Half-Bloods.
Sharing all of this with other people had lifted a huge weight off Draco’s shoulders. The pressure wasn’t solely focused on him now, though it still remained that way when he was to return to the manor.
He walked round the large table, slowly filling up the glasses that sat there. Then, he approached an old enemy. Blonde hair, grey eyes and pale skin. Draco Malfoy.
Without saying anything else, Malfoy turned briskly on his heel and continued walking at a quick pace. Harry inaudibly groaned, the pain in his head now reaching his eyes, his stomach churning with every step he took.
The light appeared again. But this time, it did not become the wolf. Instead, the silver light approached him, flickering between being bright and dim. Slowly, it crept its way towards Harry’s ear.
Finally grabbing his wand, Harry rushed after the wolf. He found it making it’s way down the stairs and he made the choice to follow. Looking at the bedroom where Mr and Mrs Weasley slept, he whispered, “I’m sorry,” before turning and heading down the stairs too.
The lift sent him to the lower most floor and he exited, quietly but quickly making his way to a room he found himself in often. There stood four other people, one witch and three wizards. They turned to look at him as the door clicked shut behind.
“Follow me,” Malfoy turned on his heel, not even looking back to see if Harry was following him. He knew Harry would be, and that annoyed Harry.
“No problem. Ron has been a great member of staff for me. If you need anything in regards to your treatment that you are struggling to get, let me know.”
Malfoy didn’t even make eye contact with Harry, he just sat and stared at the table, waiting for Harry to complete his task. This happened every morning, and for some reason, it always bothered Harry. He just didn’t understand why.
“I can’t do this, Harry,” he sobbed, putting his head in his hands and slid down the wall until he was sat on the floor.
“Hermione,” said Harry with a lump in his throat. Feeling her embrace comforted him, seeing Hermione and Ron made him feel emotional. It had felt like an eternity since he last spoke to them.
“No, I don’t think so,” replied Harry, running his fingers through his hair. “I’m not sure. I never had time to experiment with my sexuality when I was younger, I don’t really know,” he looked at Malfoy and laughed. “I’ll get you a drink.”
“Lucky you,” said Ron, putting the drink in front of Ginny and flopping down next to Hermione. “It’s a mixed bag with Malfoy. He’s either silent all day or angry all day.”
“I’ll see you both tomorrow,” said Harry quickly before rushing after Malfoy. Expecting him to apparate, Harry caught up with Malfoy, but they just kept walking in the open nature. “Not too fast, Malfoy,” begged Harry, grunting as he attempted to keep up, “my head is murder today.”
“Yeah, Hogwarts was an odd time,” slurred Malfoy, clumsily sipping his whiskey. “I couldn’t find myself dating anyone.”
Then there was Narcissa. Though Draco had stated since Lucius’ take over there had been far more arguments between them, even threats of divorce, everyone knew how much Narcissa loved her husband. She did everything she could for him, stood by his side when Voldemort had taken residence in their manor, looked after him as he drank too much every night and suffered excruciating nightmares all those years ago.
“No,” replied Draco, beginning to pace again. But Harry ignored him and walked over to the teapot, giving it a tap with his wand to boil the water inside. He made the tea and poured one for Draco, putting in one sugar.
“Me too,” muttered Harry, looking down at his butterbeer. Everything was going so well for him when he left Hogwarts. He didn’t return for his final years, instead went straight into Auror training. They took him on because he defeated Lord Voldemort, they trusted he would be a good Auror. And he was. He was absolutely excellent. But he was only able to be an Auror for three years before Lucius overtook the ministry. Everything changed then.
Lucius’ back, when Harry had always thought it was instructions from Lucius himself. There were many things Malfoy had been keeping from his father, and now Harry felt uneasy about him. If he was keeping something so big as these dealings from Lucius, then what could he be keeping from Harry? Was there something Malfoy was plotting, something big, something dangerous, with all this money he was curating from the dealings?
Malfoy looked at him. There was a slight irritation on his face, but other than that, he seemed nervous.
“You’re unwell. You can’t work like this,” Malfoy pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket. Of course, it was black silk, with ‘DM’ embroidered in red thread. “Here, for your cheek.” Harry took it from him uncertainly and pressed it against his cheek, sucking in through his teeth as the fabric pained him.
“That’s beautiful,” said Harry softly, staring at the stars in the sky. “They’re twinkling. It’s like they know you’re talking about them.”
Looking to his side, he saw Malfoy, who was also fast asleep. Then, he looked to their hands. They were still linked together, fitting perfectly. Harry couldn’t help but smile to himself.
“Hermione,” whispered Harry. She just shook her head in response, keeping her eyes to the floor. Now, it was all different.
“Come,” Draco held out his hand. There was a brief moment where Harry felt embarrassment, like the idea of Draco showing him affection in front of Narcissa was wrong, that Draco would be punished for it. But then he remembered all those days spent with Narcissa, helping her with gardening, while she allowed Harry to tell her the truth about their relationship.
Harry stayed silent, staring at Malfoy, who continued to look down at his lap. Slowly, Harry reached towards him and rolled up his sleeve, revealing the dark mark. It was faded now, it no longer moved, but it was there forever. A constant reminder of Malfoy’s terrible past.
“I think you’ve had too much to drink,” said Harry with a smile, in attempt to seem kind. “I’ll help you back.”
“No he hadn’t, that’s a shame,” smiled Harry. He always thought Mrs Weasley hadn’t forgiven him for ending things with Ginny, even though it was mutual. Even so, she still treated him like a son, and there was nothing he could be more thankful for. Especially in these dark times.
“Yes. I know that was what you wanted when we were in Hogwarts, a very large goal that you felt unachievable due to your blood status,” Draco swallowed sadly, thinking about how his wife had taught him to accept and appreciate muggleborns, “but I know you will do an excellent job. You are hardworking, loyal, and fair.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said once the rain started to clear. “We have to go and get dried off.” Malfoy looked at him, a frown furrowing his brows.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry could see Malfoy watching him. His expression was… Different. As always, his mouth lay flat, but there was something in his eyes that Harry couldn’t quite figure out. Attempting to avoid eye contact, Malfoy looked at the table, and started to pick at the skin on his knuckles.
“Mal-” Harry cut himself off with a whimper. It hurt too much to speak. Without saying anything, Malfoy carefully sat on the bed next to Harry, trying his best not to move the bed too much.
“Obliviate,” he said, and a gentle white flash of light shot towards the man on the chair. Panic flashed in his eyes, before slowly, nothing. Body slumped; the Squib stared at the floor.
“That’s okay, sir. I’ll be outside if you need anything,” said Harry, a small smile on his thin lips. Malfoy just nodded in response as Harry exited the office, closing the doors behind him and attempted to ignore all of Ron’s questions about why Malfoy seemed drunk.
It hadn’t even been three hours before Lucius put his hands on Harry again. This time, it was just because Harry was stood there. It wasn’t his fault. But, Lucius had gotten a taste of beating Harry, knowing he couldn’t do anything back like he could during Hogwarts, and it made him hungry for more.
“Georgie!” grinned Ron as George spotted the two men. Getting up, George held out his arms and gave Ron a big hug.
“I’m okay,” croaked Harry, finally looking away from his eggs and at Hermione, her dark eyes worried. “I just remembered, that’s all.”
There was a small coffee shop appearing in his vision. Smiling a small smile, he decided to go and get a cup of coffee before apparating home. The coffee shop was very sweet. It was all a pastel yellow colour, with shabby chic tables and chairs, all decorated with a bouquet of flowers. He was the only one in there, so he got quick service. The coffee was delightful, one of the best he’d ever tasted, he thought.
After two years, Draco had proposed to Harry in France while they were on holiday. Of course, Harry said yes, and they got married soon after.
“That’s that side of the job. Sometimes I like going places with him. We go to places I wouldn’t dare step foot in without Malfoy. Like Borgin and Burkes, for example.”
Stomach churning, Harry apparated into the dark room. With a flick of his wand, all the lights switched on, and he saw his familiar apartment. Though, it brought him no comfort, only a faint feeling of misery. Knowing Malfoy wouldn’t be able to follow him here, he realised this would be his best bet.
The wand flew from the wizard’s hand. Harry got himself up, pointing Malfoy’s wand at them. “I’d suggest you leave. Now.”
“Draco… Are you unable to create a patronus?” asked Harry careful. The silence answered Harry’s question. With a small smile, Harry gripped onto Draco’s hand tighter. “Come on, then.”
They made their way towards the elevators and stepped inside, grabbing onto the rails before the elevator shot them down the floors at a fast speed. The motion made Harry feel sick, his hangover ever apparent. It felt as though he was travelling through a million different dimensions at once, stars covered his eyesight. He blinked, attempting to stay focused.
The boys giggled together as they ran through the hall again, finally approaching Harry’s room. It was further away from the other staff, a proper bedroom this time with an en suite, because he permanently lived there now. The furniture was still bland, just a bed, a wardrobe and a bedside table, but it was better than before. At least, the window was bigger, and he was able to see the forests that stretched around the manor.
Harry looked down at his plate, staying silent while Hermione and Ron continued having a conversation about their days. Suddenly he didn’t feel hungry anymore, instead he felt sad. Though Malfoy was one of his lifelong enemies, he knew that Malfoy would have wanted a child. The thought of Astoria and Malfoy having issues conceiving made him feel sorry for them, especially since Astoria seemed to be a nice person. She wouldn’t let that child grow up with the same views Lucius made Malfoy grow up with, thought Harry, she would have him grow up to accept Muggleborns.
“I’m only saying what I heard Astoria talk about. Besides, Mr Weasley has said he doesn’t, so I should believe that,” Hermione wrapped her cardigan around her in frustration.
“I wish I could have my wand,” grumbled Ron as they stood outside the office. “I miss magic so much in the week.”
“Ginny won’t be coming today,” Mrs Weasley told Harry nonchalantly, not even looking at him. “Did Ron tell you?”
“Ah, Mr Malfoy,” he said in his slimy voice, sending shivers up Draco’s spine, “how may I help you today?”
“Feel better now?” asked Malfoy, looking at Harry who was lay next to him. For a moment, Harry stared into his grey eyes. They were alive, like the day of the storm, they were happy and twinkled in the dim light. It was as though they didn’t need any light to brighten them, Malfoy was doing that all on his own, especially as he gazed at Harry.
“Very well,” said Mr Borgin, wrapping it back up in a cloth. He headed over to an empty case and carefully placed it in there, shutting the glass case and tapping it with his wand to ensure its security. Hobbling back over to the counter, Mr Borgin began to estimate how much he owed Malfoy.
Malfoy had been buying Harry firewhiskeys all night. It was a busy night in the pub, there were a few familiar faces there too. Seamus and Dean, who were now an out and proud couple, kissed in the corner of the room. Harry remembered when they came out. They’d been secretly seeing each other throughout the whole of their Hogwarts years, but they were too nervous to tell anyone and tried to deny their feelings. Years later, they allowed people to know, just before Lucius had taken over. Dean had ended up working for Blaise Zabini’s family at their manor, so Seamus and Dean could only see each other on the weekends. But they made it work, and Harry thought they were very sweet. He always admired their courage to be out and proud, to be themselves, to not feel the fear of anyone judging them.
He was careful handling it, ensuring the contraption didn’t get set off, and slowly he placed it into a small box. Giving his wand a flick, he silently used the shrinking charm and slipped the now tiny box into the pocket of his dark green robes. Moving quickly, he walked out of the basement and closed the doors, casting alohomora and ensuring the doors were definitely locked before gliding away.
Malfoy was now staring at Harry, arms folded, something in his one hand that Harry couldn’t see. He didn’t know how long Malfoy had been watching him, he hadn’t taken any notice.
“I’m okay,” said Harry genuinely, with a small nod. “I wasn’t when I first got here. But it’s getting easier.”
Once Harry sat back down, Malfoy was back with his questions. “So in Hogwarts, did you not experiment?”
After brushing his teeth, Harry had a hot shower. The water beat down on his shoulders, relaxing some of the tension he held there. His job was difficult, and it caused him a lot of stress and strain. But it paid the bills, very well in fact, and it kept him out of trouble, so leaving didn’t seem like a choice to him. It wasn’t something he could think about.
“Yeah, I’m sure we can squeeze you in,” said George, “it’ll be nice to have someone else around for a change.”
Ron seemed taken aback. “Not great, sir. They’re thinking of taking him to St Mungo’s mind healing facility.”
But it seemed their relationship had become too strained to be able to have a decent conversation now.
“How’s everything been?” asked Ginny, smiling at everyone and then grinning at the kids, who were so excited to finally see their Aunt Ginny.
“Merlin, that must be torture,” said George before hitting his fist softly against the table as one of Ron’s pawns smashed into his.
“I don’t know how you can bloody tell,” whispered Ron, shaking his head. “He’s always like that. He’s always been completely silent.”
“There’s a meeting being held in my office at noon. I need an ex-Auror to attend just in case. You will be stood by the door.”
“Oh Harry,” she cooed, giving his hand a gentle squeeze. Nothing else was said by the trio, but that was okay, the silence almost comforted Harry. For years they’d tried to help him with words, tell him he was okay, everything was okay, but he knew it wasn’t. He’d never be okay again, not truly. Ron and Hermione found just sitting with Harry, sitting with him in the puddle of sadness, was the best comfort for him. No words, just being there, a gentle touch every so often to remind him that it was now all memories.
The two men walked in silence towards Lucius’ office, Seamus trailing behind them, unsure what the situation was. Malfoy knocked on the door.
“Why?” laughed Malfoy, looking over at Harry with tired eyes. “What’s the point, Potter? What’s the point of anything anymore?”
“It’s not much worse than my apartment,” said Harry, closing the door behind them and heading into the bathroom. “I could only afford a poxy flat in London, which was the easiest place to floo here from, and it wasn’t much bigger than this room.” Harry grabbed two towels. “Just had a kitchen and lounge with it.”
“It’s worth a read through the whole thing,” explained Draco as Mrs Weasley turned to the next page. “I supplied as much proof as I could.”
Harry wandered around the quiet town, looking at the shops that were starting to open. They were all very quaint, it reminded him somewhat of Wales, and he knew he would have to come back here sometime. Maybe bring Ron, Hermione and their kids, he thought, they’d like that very much.
“No, Potter,” he turned around and Harry noticed his lip quivering. “No. How could you be so dense?”
“Yeah,” said Harry quietly, trying to make sure no other staff could hear their conversation. “He’s risking getting in trouble for it, too.”
Then, it disappeared. Harry stopped in his tracks, frantically looking around to see if it would reappear anywhere. Heart racing, he could hear the blood pumping in his ears as his breath got quicker.
“They aren’t,” said Harry matter-of-factly, gripping Draco’s hand for comfort. “In fact, they know everything about us.”
“I’ve forgiven you for it, Harry,” said Malfoy, his hand still gently placed on Harry’s shoulder. “I’ve done a lot worse to you.”
“I’ll go,” said Harry, quickly getting up and rushing out of the pub. He could just about see Malfoy, his robes flapping furiously in the wind, he was walking quickly. Harry started to run. He had no idea why he suddenly felt so protective of him. Back in school there was nothing Harry wanted more than to see Malfoy embarrassed, ridiculed, talked bad about. But now that was the last thing he wanted. His chest ached as he thought about Malfoy upset, he wanted to reach out and give him a hug and stroke his soft blonde hair comfortingly.
Harry had begged Draco not to make him go back to the manor, that his father will kill Harry if they go back. But there was nowhere else for them to go.
“No, it’s not,” sitting himself up properly, Harry searched Malfoy’s face with his eyes. “I didn’t want you to do that alone. I know what you’re like. I know what your past is like. We have similar trauma, Draco. Sometimes I will arrive somewhere, somewhere I have been a million times, and I’m suddenly back in those days. I’m suddenly terrified that Voldemort is round the corner, using all my energy to keep him from being in my mind. I know what it’s like.”
“Well, isn’t this a surprise,” said Lucius as he stood, his hand firmly grasped onto the silver snake head of which his wand began.
“Will you two be quiet!” They heard Malfoy’s voice call from the office. Instantly Harry’s cheeks went bright red, his ears burning.
“I don’t know why, I’ve told you that,” Malfoy kept his cool the whole time, the words rolling easily off his tongue. He has most definitely matured since Hogwarts, Harry thought. “Everything that I can find is in these papers.”
But it all became too much. Everything with George, Lucius beating him, feeling weak. Even the way Malfoy watched him made him upset. Tears fell down from Harry’s eyes and he felt his ears redden, he couldn’t believe he was crying in front of Draco Malfoy.
“Much, I won’t tomorrow though,” laughed Harry, still watching him. Malfoy’s eyes kept flickering down to Harry’s thin lips then back up to his eyes, not wanting to break the eye contact but not being able to help himself.
“Are… Are you okay?” Slowly Malfoy looked up at Harry. His lip was no longer swollen, and the cut was nearly gone, Harry had noticed there was a bottle of healing potion on the table.
Or did he seem happy? Harry thought back to all the times he had seen them together. Astoria would cling to Malfoy’s arm, chatting away, while Malfoy looked miles away, eyes completely glazed over, expression forever unchanging. Their conversations were always one sided, and if Malfoy were to ever reply, it would just be in agreement for what she was saying. The conversations they had never seemed deep, never seemed personal, just Astoria telling him about the clothes she bought, or the letters her family had owled to her. She would kiss him on the cheek, and he wouldn’t smile, he wouldn’t blush, he wouldn’t even blink, he’d just stare straight ahead and nod to her in response. There was no affection there.
Harry thought back to his time at Hogwarts as he watched Malfoy throw more sticks into the loch. He wondered what it would have been like if he and Malfoy had become friends that first year. Would Malfoy have become a Death Eater? Would Harry have become a Death Eater? Would he have been able to help Draco, take him away from the toxicity in his life and help him start fresh? Would the London Wizarding World be how it is now, with Lucius as the minister? The questions whirled around his head one after the other, completely deafening him. He attempted to shake them off, but he was unsuccessful.
“You’ve been having to deal with this on your own?” Harry nodded. “Oh, you poor thing,” Mrs Weasley squeezed his hand tighter.
“Don’t touch it with your bare hands,” instructed Malfoy, handing Mr Borgin the cloth. “It’s cursed.”
He couldn’t stop thinking everything over. Thinking about how any moment now, Hermione could be forcefully taken away to go to the workhouses. How she must be living every second in fear, constant nervous butterflies fluttering around her stomach causing her to feel sick.
“You may go now,” interrupted Malfoy. Without saying anything else, he looked back down at his papers and continued scribbling. Confused, Harry walked out of the office, the doors slamming shut behind him.
“There are some Healers that are going to be on trial today,” Lucius Malfoy said, cutting off a small bit of toast with his knife and fork. “They’ve been harbouring some Muggleborns.”
“She desperately wants a child but we’re struggling to have a child. Problems in the bedroom,” Malfoy snorted as he spoke, “I just don’t feel that intimate connection anymore. Or the intellectual connection. My marriage is very boring, Potter. It’s so boring,” Malfoy looked at him and whined. “So boring!”
“Could you make me a cup of tea, I’m very busy with my work,” instructed Malfoy. For a few moments Harry stood there, confused, before heading to the teapot and tapping it with his wand. He was glad he could have his wand as opposed to the other butlers, it certainly made making cups of teas much easier. After the tea had boiled, Harry poured a cup for Malfoy, watching him closely, unsure what was going to happen next. But, to Harry’s surprise, Malfoy just sipped the tea and continued scribbling with his quill.
“I could never,” replied Malfoy, pointing to the door. “You’d better go and have your own breakfast. It’s nine, you’ll miss it if you don’t hurry.”
And then, the gentleman’s fist collided with Draco’s cheekbone, knocking him to the floor. His mouth filled with blood and he spat it out, trying to keep consciousness. He looked over his shoulder and saw the five men all walking away, not looking back, and they disappeared into the shadows of Knockturn Alley.
“Wh-What will I have to do in return, sir?” asked Ron. Harry could sense his fear, which always seemed odd to him, because Ron had never feared Malfoy before. But the situation had changed, and there was always the worry of Lucius obliviating Hermione. Doing so would have her lose all memories of her children, her life with Ron, everything she had ever learned about the Wizarding World. After finding out that there was a possibility of Lucius obliviating muggleborns, Ron had been on high alert, making sure he didn’t do anything wrong and working twice as hard. Which also meant being scared of Malfoy.
Harry expected ridicule. “Ha! Look! Potter is crying!” He expected Malfoy to say. “What a baby. What a wimp.”
“Here,” Draco placed them down on the long dining table. “We’re unable to properly communicate. At first, we sent letters updating each other on certain situations. But my father started to suspect some members of the ministry were up to no good, and letters became far too risky. Instead, we resorted to ribbons to communicate.”
“Ah, yes,” Lucius said coolly, rising from his desk. He waved his wand quickly, which made the doors slam shut behind Harry, causing him to jump. “Draco, my son, why don’t you go and stand in the corner. Potter, come here.”
“You’re part of the family, Harry,” Mr Weasley said, placing a hand to the back of Harry’s neck as they walked in. “George would want to see you as much as all of us.”
The large doors opened, and the cooks came through with breakfast foods. The smell made Harry’s mouth water, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to eat anything for a while. Attempting to distract himself, Harry looked around the dining room. The dining table was large, for such a small family it seemed odd. The dark oak wood table stretched at least ten metres, which could easily house a large party, but it never did. The fireplace crackled quietly behind the end chair.
Draco lay in the bed, staring at the window, his eyes completely dried out of tears while the pillow remained soaked in them.
It was agreed they’d all meet back at Grimmauld tomorrow morning after packing a few things.  They could relax and explore all Phoenix Perch had to offer and most importantly rest and just enjoy being together as they never really had been able to before.  Harry hugged his friends tightly and walked them to the floo before heading upstairs to write the letter requesting the last of Smoke’s missives.
“I’ll see you in a few hours, Caelum.”  With a last hug Harry watched as his son practically bounced up the steps to his preschool.  He had been hesitant about sending the boy to school so early but after gentle prodding from Hermione and Molly and much internal debate with himself, he had given in and enrolled him in the half day program.   Harry feared it wouldn’t be long before he gave in to Caelum’s pleading and switched him to the full day program instead.
He had started thinking about this potion after meeting his insane Aunt Bellatrix and hearing her brag about her past deeds while threating him within an inch of his life for imagined misdeeds and slights against her precious Dark Lord.  He knew that Neville had been raised by his Grandmother, but did not know or care why at the time.  It was a startling discovery.  By the time he had learned about her actions he had already began to doubt in the ideology he had shoved down his throat since he learned to walk.  His father had tarnished the Malfoy name with the first war, but he had ruined it with the second.  He never imagined his family on both sides would be so vile and repugnant.
birthday he seemed to change in a way she couldn’t understand or explain away.  She knew he was facing heavy pressure from his father around that time but before his birthday each day he spent going through the motions of living.  He lost his temper over the smallest and sometimes imagined things one minute and then the fire would extinguish instantly and his eyes would look almost dead.  He was sleeping with anyone and at times she wondered if it was indeed everyone who happened to show any interest.  Then his birthday hit and while he seemed troubled, it was a different kind of trouble.  It was more like he was shocked at the realization of something than worry about when he’d be force to follow his father’s footsteps.  He stopped sleeping with anyone at all and said he needed to focus on his studies, yet he had the highest grades behind Granger.  He was still a snarky bastard, but he was different too.  She just didn’t know why and it was time to demand to know why.
Blaise cocked his head and looked at Harry in confusion.  “Harry?  Do you guys understand the meaning of the word snog?  There’s no way it wouldn’t have been all over the castle if Harry was snogging in the alcoves.”
As for us?  I don’t know.  I want to say yes, but at the same time I want to run screaming the other way.  So much would depend on what your plans are.  You want to get to know Caelum, but how do you plan to do that?  Are you going to continue your life as it is now, playing a show in a new town every night?  Are you going to put down roots and move back here?
The Headmistress just quirked her lips and shook her head at messy haired boy.  “How kind of you, Mr. Potter.  I came not to critique your flying style but to invite you to join me for a quick tea.  Are you finished with your solo seeker’s match?”
Draco had no idea what the letters contained or why Harry was so confident he’d want to meet to ask questions, but he opened the box without another thought and began reading a stack of letters that would change his life forever.
With that thought in mind he wiped his face off and summoned parchment and a quill to pen his reply.  He told Harry he’d meet him at the Leaky at 8:30 and they could decide where to go to talk from there.  He called for an elf to take the letter to the owlery and spent the rest of the night rereading the letters and going through the scrapbook countless times.
With a sigh and a thought of how quickly time was passing, Harry started walking towards Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.  Most mornings found him there since Caelum had started school.  Occasionally he could be seen ringing up customers but most of the time he was either restocking shelves or in the back with the twins digging through journals the Marauder's had left behind.  They had developed a whole new line that was flying off the shelves from the ideas that were on those pages.  Marauder’s Madness was on pace to outsell the Wonder Witch line by the end of the year.
“History of Magic is not being offered as a class but as you can see you have plenty of free periods to study independently and I dare say you will learn more on your own than if you took the class.  I will be your Transfiguration professor and we are bringing in a Professor to instruct you in Defense but otherwise your professors will remain the same as the other students.  The 8
“Next round is on me!” Blaise exclaimed in attempt to take the focus off the reuniting pair.  The group felt complete again.  He only hoped he wasn’t too late to sway Draco into joining them next month.
“Mate, I don’t think she’s kidding.  I’d cover your bits if I were you.” Ron chuckled from behind the door.
“I must say you sound as if you’ve thought this through many times, Potter.  Why in the world haven’t you ever brought it up before?”
Hannah laughed and pulled a few her way.  “It’s ok love, I’ll assist you.  I don’t think there’s a rule against that and if there is I don’t care.”  She placed a kiss on his lips and smiled at him.  She was glad she listened to him and came down instead of going to bed.  While she wasn’t sure any of them would ever be lifelong friends, she could see the benefit of getting to know each other.
It had been years since Draco Malfoy had set foot on British soil.  He left after completing his N.E.W.T.s as was required by his probation and never looked back.  When Father had been sentenced to Azkaban his Mother lost all sanity and had to be placed in St. Mungo’s.  One he had no desire to ever see or speak to again, the other had no clue who he was.  The friends he had before the war were either dead, in Azkaban with his Father, or had made it clear they wanted nothing to do with the Malfoy heir.  Of course, there was Harry, but it had been over 5 years ago that he walked away from that relationship.
Draco walked the hallways of the manor that felt drenched with the horrors and atrocities that recently came to pass in his childhood home. Home. Funny word that is. The manor never really felt like home but more like a holding cell with his father as the cruel heartless jailer. Hogwarts had always been his escape, his true home. The only place he ever really felt safe, the place he felt he actually grew up in even if he was forced to wear a mask after realizing his mistakes to protect others. He could not care less what anyone thought of him if it saved the lives of those he loved. Yet because of that mask his return to Hogwarts was something he did not see as feasible. There was too much pain and hurt and too many people needing someone to blame. Repeating his 7th year did not appear to be in the cards for him. He could study independently at home and take his tests at the Ministry like the others who chose not to return this September at the end of the school year.
