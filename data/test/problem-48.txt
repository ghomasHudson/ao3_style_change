"Obviously," Nott, who was usually the more laidback of the duo, obnoxiously stood in his seat, neck craning to look over at the Gryffindor table, too. "He can duel with my wand any day."
Name something more romantic than that!"
"I refuse to seek happiness in someone who makes me feel all these things I don't like to feel," Draco declared. "So don't encourage me to dream about him. Potter's not a piece of gold and, even if he were," Draco paused for added effect. "I don't like a gold rush."
They reached the doors of the Great Hall, the chatter of voices muffled but still audible in the hallway. Draco had been surprised that so many students elected to attend a school that had been a battlefield mere months ago. But when news spread that Harry Potter was to attend Hogwarts for one final year, parents everywhere gushed how no place would be safer.
Pansy's gaze softened as she watched Draco ponder, and her voice lowered so he had to lean in a bit to catch her words.
"Then why are you so good at it?" Draco asked while they walked through the common room and past the portrait that led to the staircase. His words were tinged with annoyance and slight jealousy— Potter
"Malfoy? Malfoy, look at me."
He let his focus slip beyond reach, making the gauntlet appear like a Pensieve in his muddy vision. What if Draco sat with Harry at dinner and called him out on all his contrarian shit while squeezing his thigh under the table to signal he was just pushing his buttons? What if they wandered around Europe like they both wanted to, taking baby Teddy to see the ocean for the first time? What if they took moonlit walks by the coast, holding hands and letting passerby’s marvel at their love? What if they stayed roommates after Hogwarts, pooling together their funds to have a place with a spare room for whenever Teddy or their friends visited? What if, what if, what if...
For someone who held his head high when telling various teachers, government officials, and evil wizards to piss off, Potter was awful at romantic speeches.
No, that wasn’t it. Draco did many things, but lie to himself was not one of them. Anyone with eyes could discern he liked Potter. Anyone, of course, except Potter himself.
Draco thought darkly.
The knot squeezed tighter at the word 'friend.' No matter what Draco thought, Harry Potter was not ‘his’ anything. Harry Potter was nothing beyond his friend.
However, it went without saying that Draco was too much of a gentleman to ever peek at Potter's actual naked body. No matter how much his friends begged him to confirm or deny the rumor that Potter had a phoenix tattoo on his back with its tail slithering down certain places, he refused to do so. A normal person did not take longing glances at their roommate’s naked body.
Because Headmistress McGonagall wanted to promote House unity. Because Minister of Magic Kingsley Shacklebot wanted to keep an eye on the flight risks. Because Fate hated him and was making him pay for his crimes against humanity.
"Listening to what?" Draco deadpanned. "Nobody told me you lot were saying something of importance."
"Look Draco, you cannot honestly be surprised everyone in the school, and I mean everyone, has a not-so-secret boner for Potter. He's always been Hogwart's resident celebrity, except now he's also a hot war hero," Pansy spelled out. Draco swallowed hard; so he was not the only one who noticed Potter had physically improved. Except he, unlike Zabini and Nott, also noticed how Potter changed beneath the lean muscles and sharp jaw and brilliant eyes. He noticed how Potter was more reflective, how Potter was more patient, how Potter was more kind...
Harry Potter quite content with being third best to his friends, albeit in something silly like wizard's chess?
Draco followed Potter from a distance for many nights until, one evening, Potter waited for him at the bottom of the steps. That night, Potter led Draco to the last place they had seen the Room of Requirement. It was a source of particular pain for Draco: it was where Crabbe died in the flames of his own curse.
It was too late for Draco to claim he was not in love, almost in love, barely in love. Draco Malfoy has loved Harry Potter in secret for as long as he could remember. And now, Harry wanted to love Draco for all the world to see.
Merlin, since when was walking away from Potter so difficult?
Draco reminded himself.
In Draco's case, it was the latter before it shifted to the former. He hated how Potter would joke and laugh at dinner, but fall silent and withdraw within himself the moment he was alone. He hated how Potter was suddenly the perfect pupil, completing his homework despite the fact that all his teachers expressed he could slack off a bit if he wished. He hated how Potter, once restless and curious and quite nosy, gave Draco his space and never once goaded him, never once tried to get into Draco’s business. Draco hated Potter because he continued to be perfect despite the fact that he earned the right to be imperfect. And if Potter of all people could be perfect, then Draco must be perfect, too.
"Join Nott and Zabini's bet," Potter said, his words barely discernible through his rushed tone.
roommate. Did that not mean something?
Draco inhaled sharply, whipping his head to look up at Potter with wide eyes. Those words had been spoken by himself long ago. The particularly shrewd look in Potter's eyes signaled he, too, remembered that stupid duel in front of the school when they were merely twelve. Potter’s eyes had glistened with uncertain determination then; now, they were almost cheerful, confident at the impending victory.
Draco anticipated the reaction his embarrassment would have, but he braced himself far too late. The result was a flush of cheeks combined with a pained expression, a strange combination on anyone’s face. Potter’s smirk only deepened Draco’s internal mortification.
"Fine," Draco snapped in an annoyed tone. "What is it?"
"Let's say you joined in on Zabini and Nott's bet. Out of the three,
"Whatever Potter," Draco grumbled, slipping his feet into his shoes and reaching for his robe. "We’re late for dinner anyway."
"Why Potter?" Draco demanded in a low voice with thinly concealed anger. "Of all the people you could pick from in this bloody school, why in Slytherin's good name would you two want Potter?"
It was simple moments like these that reminded Draco that his past perception of Potter was not entirely accurate. The public revered him, his friends adored him, and all adults decreed his word law, facts that were true even before Potter saved the wizarding world. So Draco had prided himself on seeing Potter for who he truly was: an arrogant git who sprouted contrarian opinions in order to seem different, starting with rejecting a Malfoy in favor of a Weasley at their first meeting.
Draco countered,
Ignoring that his knot had migrated from his stomach to his throat, Draco hurried as quickly as he could towards the door. But just as he surged forward to push it open, a hand reached to stop him. Draco did not have to turn his head to know whose hand it was; there was only one person whose touch could ever freeze him in place like this.
enemy throughout the war, and now
fault Potter proved to be surprisingly adept at wizard's chess. A glance at their board, now left abandoned on their bedroom floor, would show that Potter had absolutely steamrolled Draco.
"And which poor bloke are you two planning to pursue?" Draco asked, still not convinced they were serious.
Maybe, just maybe, he could love without hurting.
"Draco Malfoy!" Pansy's nasal voice interrupted his inner dialogue. "Are you even listening?"
"Join Nott and Zabini's bet," Potter repeated, this time with more confidence. "I promise that if you genuinely want to win, you will. In fact," he got a teasing gleam in his eye, "It may be the only game you win for a while, seeing as you always lose when you play against me."
"You know Malfoy, I would've thought you'd be good at wizard's chess," Potter commented, still relishing in his victory. "I imagined your childhood was just tea and cookies and chess and whatever else you fancy folks get up to."
Like a mood ring, Potter's eyes shifted to convey his emotions. Want, desire.
It all changed when Potter began to slip out of their room after curfew, leaving until the wee hours of the morning. After this occurred for a few consecutive nights, Draco gave in to his curiosity and followed Potter. He discovered Potter was not wandering off to shag someone, but to go on a walk. He would walk to the Astronomy Tower, to the quidditch pitch, to random hallways and staircases. Draco recognized enough locations to know that each spot had been a place of grief for Potter, ranging from Dumbledore's death to his own.
"And seeing as this whole year is an embarrassing attempt to give us back a piece of our long-lost childhoods, it's only fair for those of us not coupled up have fun," Nott finished, eying the Gryffindor table in disgust. They had spent enough time gossiping about this year's couples to know who Nott was referring to. Finnigan and Thomas were the bromance gone romance, whereas Weasley and Lovegood were the unforeseen couple everyone was secretly envious of.
Potter snorted, but stood up as well to get dressed in proper robes. Despite all his fame and glory, he was still slightly shorter than Draco. It was a small victory, but one Draco relished all the same.
Throughout the dinner, Draco had been watched, judged, disliked, maybe even hated, all things he would prefer to feel from the comfort of his House table. The horrid memory strengthening his resolve, Draco kept walking.
"Wait, what?" He asked, sounding awfully like Potter in every social situation.
Draco did not blame his classmates for their cold treatment. They had chosen to complete (or redo) their seventh year in search of community; they had
Draco had never hated Potter. But hating someone was far easier than loving someone.
Potter finished pulling his robes down, his unruly hair even more displaced. He looked at Draco with a lopsided smile, gesturing towards the door.
"Oi!" Goyle complained, wiping gravy from his cheek. "Watch out with that, mate."
Draco's eyes fell away from her gaze and onto the tea in front of them.
Blood rushed to Draco's face, painting his pale cheeks with a blush of pink.
But the most vital shift— in Draco’s eyes, anyways— from eleven-year-old to eighteen-year-old Harry Potter was that, instead of rejecting Draco's hand and friendship at the beginning of the school year, Potter had offered
Draco blinked rapidly, realizing a second too late he had walked past his friends. Before they realized his mistake, he quickly retraced his steps and slipped into the open seat beside Goyle. The eighth-year Slytherins— Zabini, Nott, Goyle, Parkinson, Greengrass, and Bulstrode— were large enough in numbers to form a group at the Slytherin table, safely away from the other eighth years.
"Before you go, I need you to know something," Potter said with a lopsided smile. This one was new— it was almost shy. "I'm ready to cash in my favor."
"I don't understand why
Draco shared memories of growing up in a traditional Pureblood family, of long nights studying family trees and being scolded for using the incorrect utensils at dinner. He shared memories of his time at Hogwarts, of his mother sending him sweets and his father sending him apologetic gifts after a particularly cruel owl. He shared memories of his time during the war, of living in constant fear that the Dark Lord would finally decide the Malfoy family was useless and do away with them all. He shared memories of his life after, of being trapped in the very house that had been his prison during the war and the only kind owl being the one inviting him to return to Hogwarts. He shared his now faded Dark Mark, and allowed Potter to trace the scars his own curse had left on Draco's torso during sixth-year.
Potter let out a large exhale, as if he had been holding his breath the entire time.
So no, Draco did not become friends with Harry Potter overnight. It took night after night of keeping each other company while they visited invisible graves, of holding each other after a particularly gruesome nightmare, of forgiving the scars they left on each other’s bodies and promising to never hurt each other again. It took day after day of being in a classroom together, Potter silently partnering with Draco in Defense Against the Dark Arts to protect him from malignant classmates, and Draco returning the favor by partnering with Potter during Potions to protect him from his own self. It took afternoons of studying together in the library, of Draco's elegant notes supplementing Potter's scribbles. It took weekends of spending time together, of Potter introducing Draco to various Muggle games and novels, of walking alongside the lake in the daylight for a change, of deciding to remain in their room and not be their perfect selves on lazy Sunday's.
"No! No, it’s not involving them. Well, not really," Potter shrugged a bit, as if he had been caught doing something he shouldn't be but didn't particularly care. "Hear me out first and then tell me if you're in or not."
At first, the moment had been just as silent and tense as their usual day. And then, they began to talk. Once they started, they could not stop, the conversation continuing until the sun rose. Since then, Draco joined Potter on his walks, both of them leaving behind their perfect selves and sharing their flaws, their scars, and their memories. In other words, they shared their true selves, and Harry Potter's true self was even more beautiful than Draco could have ever imagined.
"Because, dearest Draco," Zabini drawled, "If you hadn't noticed, we were just in a war, which left little time to dabble in romance. Now that pretty boy Potter cleaned all that up for us, we get to enjoy the flood of people who are realizing life is too short, so shag as often as possible before we get into another war."
Draco blinked rapidly, realizing he had been staring much too intently at Potter
Draco did not dare to spare Potter any form of goodbye as he pushed open the door, walking with purpose towards the Slytherin table. He could feel Potter's eyes drilling holes into his retreating back, and it took all his self-restraint not to look. The last time he did, Potter's pleading eyes had been enough to guilt Draco into joining the large group of eighth years who opted to sit at the Gryffindor table. That dinner had been unbearably awkward, with only Lovegood and Potter behaving like their normal selves. Draco had not dared to be himself either, biting back his snarky remarks for fear of offending Potter's band of friends and fans. Even when Potter devilishly proclaimed the Holyhead Harpies would rather sign Lovegood than Weasley, or when he sided with Granger that being a dentist was a perfectly respectable job, Draco remained silent. How was it possible that only he recognized that Potter was full of shit? Absolute, utter, contrarian shit.
"After you."
"You wish," Draco grumbled, taking up Potter's old line. Ignoring the man’s gleeful expression, he evaluated the chessboard more seriously. If he continued to play, he would lose horribly. If he gave up now, he would still lose horribly but with his head held high. Thus, with a dramatic sigh of defeat, Draco reached for his somber king and placed the disappointed ruler face down.
, not that the oblivious git noticed. Honestly, Draco marveled that Potter managed to do all that he did during his time at Hogwarts and the war; he was the most unobservant, clueless bloke Draco had ever met (and Draco was friends with unbelievably stupid people).
Potter's voice was low, employing the tone he donned whenever he comforted Draco after a particularly awful nightmare. The softness and evident affection made Draco weak. Everything about Harry Potter made Draco weak.
Draco knew better than to glance at the Gryffindor table in reaction to Potter's name. He kept his eyes glued to his plate, barely registering what he was serving himself.
"Wait, what?"
Luckily, it was Potter's move, meaning he was more concerned with his screeching chess pieces than Draco's bizarre behavior. Shrugging it off, Potter refocused his gaze onto the chessboard. Many things had changed, but Potter's daftness certainly had not.
"Harry Potter."
And now here he was, stuck with Harry bloody Potter as a roommate and falling hopelessly more in love with each passing second.
"Cheer up Malfoy," Zabini smirked. "He'll still be at your beck and call whenever you need a friend. You'll just have to learn to share."
"Or as long as you want," Potter amended quickly, his teasing facade slipping. "We can give it a go for a while or forever or, well, however long—or little!— you want. But that's only if you're okay with this. Up to you, really."
He knew Potter was still looking, a small shiver running down his back from the weight of Potter's gaze. There was something so endlessly fascinating about Potter's eyes that demanded Draco's attention more so than anything ever had. His eyes distracted Draco, making him lose fantastically at chess or forget the motions of a simple blocking spell during class. When Potter concentrated, as he had been during their game, his eyes became an unusually still ocean. But when he wanted something, those ocean waters parted and Potter's gaze beckoned Draco with a yearning that made it criminal to do anything but walk into those waters and be engulfed by them...
"Scared, Malfoy?"
chosen for that community to include former Death Eaters. But Headmistress McGonagall decreed Hogwarts would always welcome its students home, no matter which side of a war those students fought on. As such, Draco made the decision— wise or unwise, he had yet to decide— to return to Hogwarts and complete his studies. Perhaps no one would ever hire a former Death Eater, but it would not hurt if said former Death Eater received high marks on his N.E.W.T.'s and maybe a recommendation letter or two from his reputable professors.
"And why not?"
"A game of chess, if you must know," Draco said in a clipped tone, long accustomed to Pansy's instigating antics. That did not mean he liked the idea that she— and, therefore, anyone else who engaged in gossip, which happened to be everyone and their mothers at Hogwarts— knew he and Potter spent an absurd amount of time together. Draco guessed Potter now spent as much time with him as he did with Granger and Weasley, if not more.
A lopsided smile grew on Potter's face. "I've played against Ron, who's definitely the best in our year, and Hermione, who's arguably the second-best, for over seven years. It's only fair that after years of losing, I've become third best."
"We were discussing Zabini and Nott's bet to see who can get a boyfriend first," Pansy huffed before Draco could reply. "I would think
"Nothing," Draco muttered, masking his embarrassment with a neutral tone. "Never mind."
Zabini nodded eagerly, adding, "The perfect boyfriend. I mean, who wouldn't want to go out with the world's dashing savior?"
Seeming to be just as in tune with Draco's emotions as the latter was with his, Potter gently squeezed his hand.

"Draco. Draco, please look at me."
All in all, Pansy had a point. There was something about rooming with someone who was not exclusively your friend that got people's motors running.
Zabini and Nott exchanged wicked smiles.
have the best chance of winning." The knot in Draco's stomach stopped squeezing, pausing to listen. "You and Potter have been obsessed with each other since you met. Not only that, you two are
A commotion near the door brought Draco's attention back to the present. Nott and Zabini were making a show of sauntering towards the Gryffindor table. After exchanging words with Potter, those seated shifted to make space for them. But of course, the obnoxious gits just had to sit on either side of Potter.
distracted by Potter's eyes.
Hope.
No. No, no he can't. Draco knows what will happen if he does.
Draco frowned. "I had nothing to do with Nott or Zabini's antics, so don't ask me to reign them in or—"
"You're just upset because I won again," Potter jabbed good-naturedly. Draco's sarcastic reply died on his lips when his eyes caught the peek of skin revealed when Potter lifted his arms to put on his robe. Potter had a defined, toned torso, with a small patch of hair beginning near his navel and trailing down his jeans. Oh, how Draco longed to confirm certain rumors about that part of Potter’s body...
So Draco Malfoy returned to Hogwarts, the terms of his house arrest shifting from never leaving Malfoy Manor to never leaving Hogwarts' grounds. He was one of a few former Slytherins to do so but, while he had initially felt relief to know he would have some allies at the school, it was all for naught. Why?
spend a great portion of his childhood sipping tea and nibbling on cookies and playing chess with his mother (who Draco now suspected let him win on purpose). But it was not
"Are you okay?"
So why was it that Potter's eyes were so inviting, that his touch grounded him, that his words made Draco's mind go quiet and still and utterly at peace?
"A while?" Draco repeated weakly, his mind barely managing to compute what exactly was happening.
Yes, Draco Malfoy loved Harry Potter. But it had not been like this the entire time. Draco did not walk into Hogwarts head-over-heels with Potter and ready to be the best of friends (and, hypothetically, even if he had, he would never admit it). In the beginning, their silence had been tense, an undercurrent of uncertainty making it difficult to converse. But sharing a room does something incomprehensible to people. It lets you in on who they are behind closed doors, leaving it up to you to decide whether to love or hate your roommate's true self.
"I don't particularly like Potter, and I don't particularly like you. But you both deserve happiness, more so than anyone else in this bloody school. And if that happiness lies with each other, then so be it," she murmured, her eyes showing more honesty than Draco had seen in all his years of knowing her. "At least imagine it, Draco. It can’t hurt to let yourself dream a bit."
Examples of the "and they were roommates" trope flashed in Draco's mind: Lovegood and Weasley, Finnigan and Thomas, even Parkinson and Granger had some tension. The sudden recollection that Nott roomed with Longbottom and Zabini with Weasley made for two very amusing scenarios; he'll have to use that as ammunition to turn the tables and tease them for once.
Draco blinked, his mind absolutely blank for the first time in weeks.
be interested, seeing as you have as good a chance as anyone to win if you joined."
Draco pieced together.
Finding his voice, Draco managed to croak, "I'm fine. Just feeling a bit... A bit out of it. I'm going to bed early, so refrain from your usual racket when you get to the room."
Somewhere between the days and afternoons and nights of learning who Harry Potter was behind closed doors, Draco fell in love with the imperfectly perfect Boy Who Lived.
But this time, his infatuation had morphed into a feeling far deeper than childhood obsession. When they were just two boys who deeply (dis)liked each other, Draco played it off as a rivalry. But ‘boy' was a term that no longer applied to Draco nor the Boy Who Lived. Harry Potter was no longer the scrawny, small child who rejected Draco's hand all those years ago. Potter's body was taller, a bit leaner, with softly toned muscles hidden beneath tattered Muggle clothing. And while the rumors about Potter’s body were creative (ranging from Potter’s theoretical eight-pack to the more outlandish rumor that his body was covered in tattoos), Draco was more interested in its subtle beauties. The way Potter’s biceps curled when he reached for a book on a higher shelf, the way his fingers danced on his knee when he was bored in class, the way his calves flexed when he walked up staircases...
“I’m bloody fantastic,” Draco told him. His voice came out rough and gravelly. It brought the image of Jeff the Niffler to mind, and Draco shook his head and suppressed a smile. He looked up at Harry. “Want me to continue?”
All the names, except Draco Malfoy’s.
“You’re a liability,” Draco grinds out. “I didn’t see it soon enough… I was weak. Blinded by—” He gestures between him and Harry, and Harry’s throat tightens painfully, “—by
Anyway: dinner? Maybe? Soon?
Eventually, he nods.
He was here last night, so odds are he still is. When we returned from Paris last summer, Daddy said Harry would go back to his own house for a while.

was able to recognise that)
“Goodbye, Potter,” he says, low enough that the barking journos don’t hear him, but Harry reads his lips.
Malfoy smiles devilishly. “Oh, you assume I didn’t enjoy myself the last time, sweetheart?”
Draco told her. Next to him, Harry was silently shaking with repressed laughter. Ignoring Draco's annoyed look, he gestured towards his parchment and quill and started writing.
Harry could hear Malfoy’s lewd smirk in his question. He threw a surreptitious glance at him. He found him staring at him, grey eyes focused on their goal.
How could anyone in their right mind enjoy returning to the scene of one’s most shameful, most humiliating moments? How could anyone actively want to reminisce the time when one was, to put it mildly, an entitled, bigoted brat?

seeds from Borneo, and they’re behaving strangely and...yeah.”
“She really is,” Luna added with a soft expression on her face, resting her hand on Ginny’s. Ron shook his head with a smile.
Malfoy doesn’t move out of Harry’s space, but he rubs his palm on his trousers, an affronted look on his face. The irony of it makes Harry swallow a burst of giggles.
“The Ministry is trying to build a case against you. They have for years. The supposed illegal business under the cover of Caduceus… They think the initial funds came from criminal activity, which you could possibly be the source of.”
“Pretend that the Mark doesn’t exist. That it didn’t happen.”
My question is, am I getting paid for my time?
“That’s… very well thought, and quite clever,” Harry says, feeling his ears heat with the compliment he’s unwittingly paying Malfoy this time. It’s the longest they’ve talked without Malfoy breathing into Harry’s ear, or fumbling with Harry’s flies, or doing or saying anything inappropriate and devastating, so no wonder Harry’s unsettled. “Have you ever thought of collaborating with the Aurors?”
The door swung open to interrupt their conversation.
"I'm pretty silly."
Irritated, Draco knit his brows even tighter than they already were.
"Of course, you do. In fact, shall I ask him?"
"He was upset yesterday."
"Ah." Draco nodded once. He placed the golden object back on the shelf. "She's playing well this year."
Draco stilled.
"Okay, okay," Scorpius honked.
"What did you tell them?" he finally asked Harry.
That was that. The Saviour had spoken.
Draco looked up from his late dinner when his son marched into the kitchen with his chest puffed out. "What now?" he asked as he set his fork down on the plate.
Scorpius tugged at Teddy's hand. "I'll show you my playroom. Come on." The boys ran up the stairs.
One afternoon, at recess, Harry snapped out of his work when he heard a commotion in the playground. He found a small group gathered by the monkey bars. As he approached them, he could see Gabrielle consoling a
His heart could burst, that's how happy he was that night. He threw his arms around his parents. Best summer ever.
"Mhm."
"Fine. I'll be angry with you for

"What's that?" Scorpius asked.
feel this way. "He has a fever. Everyone gets fevers."
"I did!" Scorpius threw his arms up. "I had so much fun, Dad. It's not fair how much fun I had. I wish you had come with us."
Draco paused his furious scrubbing for a moment, catching his son's happy smile. "I know."
An enormous weight lifted off of Draco's shoulders, he finally relaxed his fists. He didn't even have to ask. Selfless Potter could read his mind, he thought wryly.
"Mhm."
Scorpius finally looked up at Harry, his mouth open in surprise. "Huh?"
Harry shook his head violently.
"I think you're a good person," Scorpius continued. He stroked Draco's cheek. "Because you're my father, I think you're good. People at school say mean things, but I don't believe them."
"That's different."
He tsked in exasperation. "I was angry and embarrassed and everything spilled out of me-"
"What is it?" Scorpius wanted to know.
"-thinking it's all fun and games when it comes to parenting-"
Ron shifted Hugo over in his arms with a grunt and asked Harry, "As painful as expected?"
The teacher's lounge was bustling when Harry arrived, Gabrielle giving him a narrow-eyed glance when he placed the sandwich box on the table aside from his plate of chicken and rice. "From Scorpius," Harry answered her questioning look as he took a seat.
He quickly rummaged through his bag and found what he was looking for - two pieces of chart paper. He thrust them towards Draco.
Scorpius stared out the frosty window, drumming his fingers on the pane. "Where's the ruddy owl?"
house probably has a few dozen ghouls just waiting to ambush anyone who goes past the third floor." Teddy shuddered. "The paintings scream at you if you look at them wrong. One time Harry fell clean through some floorboards. It's quite abusive, actually. Dunno why I bother staying there."
"Bet it fills up a book, huh?"
"You've got plenty of money hoarded away," Draco smirked. "Surely you can afford a better ride. Sentimental?"
"You felt bad." Scorpius realized this as he looked down at the five leaves his father had brought for him. "I didn't want you to feel bad."
"He's quite mature for a twelve year old," Harry boasted. He thought of Teddy as his own son. He had basically brought up the child. He had helped Teddy when he stumbled over his feet. He had taught Teddy to read and write. In fact, Teddy was the reason Harry became a teacher. He was immensely proud of his godson. "He's pretty great."
Scorpius had crawled into Draco's bed early Sunday morning, knowing Draco wouldn't wake up properly for another hour. He didn't feel like playing or reading, so he lay down and stared up at the white canopy with his hands on his belly and his feet planted on the mattress. It didn't take long for Draco to turn over and drop an arm on Scorpius' chest. Scorpius wiggled to get his own arms out from under it. Then he pushed up the sleeve on Draco's shirt, exposing the Dark Mark. He traced it once, refusing to stop even after Draco twitched sleepily. "I know what this is," he announced.
“They’re not my friends," Harry protests. "You know I’ve nothing to do with that shady raid. I would never put you or Scorpius on the line like that. You bloody well know it.”
Harry ignores the sarcasm and presses closer. “The first time I saw you again…
“That’s how people think of you, yes.”
“Mmmpff,” Draco tried to speak. He managed to break the kiss long enough to groan, “Silencing spells, you heathen! My mother and aunt and cousin could hear us!”
“Oi!” Harry grins and grabs him by the shoulders on instinct, “what are you doing here? Trying to fight me wandless? Forgot I know Krav Maga?”
Draco opened his mouth—this might not be the best place to discuss this, damn Gryffindors to the ends of Heaven—but Harry placed a reassuring hand on his leg. Draco looked down at Harry’s hand, calmly but possessively clamped around his knee, and prayed his blush wasn’t too visible.
(You didn’t act like I did. You seemed to enjoy yourself.
“I didn't,” Draco said weakly. He rubbed his temples. Tonight was turning out to be a bit too much new information to process.
“Turn around,” he rasped. “Let me see—”
Harry thinks, clenching his jaw,
“Not exactly. Look, he had me followed since even before I started working for him. He was getting suspicious.”
Harry gives up on trying to forget Draco Malfoy.
The members of the unofficial Quidditch team were Weasley, Thomas, Greg, Blaise, Harry and Draco. Because of the team’s configuration and Harry’s oversized talent as a Seeker—or blatant lack of talent for any other position, Draco would have pettily thought a few years ago—they never played an actual Quidditch game, but rather split the team in two sides of three and passed a Quaffle while Harry on one side and Draco on another tried to catch the Snitch.
Harry looks between his two friends, irritated. “What the hell is this about? What did I just say? I just told you I’m getting to know Draco as part of the mission, and you act like you just heard some kind of great revelation.”
Harry turns his head. In the dimness, Malfoy’s eyes glint like a cat’s. “Why, Potter,” Malfoy says. “I’m here to enjoy the show, just like you.”
It was a veritable jungle, barely contained by the walls and windows. Draco’s feet stopped of their own accord at the threshold of the room. Once again, he found himself at a loss for words.
Scorpius drawled in his flat, observing tone, as Ernestina appeared to take him upstairs.
“I’m going to have to turn your offer down, I’m afraid. I’m on my third drink, you see…”
“Are you telling me there’s no fire?”
“Okay,” Harry says, rubbing the back of his neck. Whatever he was expecting to find in the kitchen this morning, it sure wasn’t a free house-elf, paid by Draco Malfoy to take care of his son and make a huge breakfast for three because, apparently, she’s also part of Malfoy’s family. So he points at the pan of eggs instead. “Can I use some of these for a sandwich?”
Unsure if he should follow them, Draco found himself alone at the big dining room table, his fingers wrapped around a warm cup of tea. He felt pleasantly full yet slightly shaken by the flood of emotions the night had brought. He might be human now, but human feelings still had the power to overwhelm him. Sometimes they washed over him like a tide, sometimes seeped through him like groundwater through rock, sometimes buzzed around him like magic. He savoured the milky aroma of his tea and the sting of hot liquid on his tongue. He deserved a few moments alone to recover after the intensive immersion he’d just had in Harry’s family.
play a part in my reconstruction?” she repeated. “Of course, Draco. Of all the questions in this interview, this one is the silliest. The fact that you’d even ask it tells me a lot more about
“Well…” Harry started. He resisted the urge to rub the back of his neck. “If you wanted… We could, you know. I wouldn’t be opposed,
Draco gave her a smile. The muscles in his cheeks felt stiff. “Yes. Then you’re free to go.” He uncrossed his legs, leaned in, and took a breath. It was the same question he asked all his other interviewees, the one he liked to conclude on. “What is the thing people get wrong the most about you? I suppose you are confronted with a few false assumptions, given your past and your status.”
he thought, remembering the previous day’s walk by the lake with Pansy. After a beat, Harry resumed his scribble.
“Mufflatio,” Malfoy whispers. Harry doesn’t know if it’s to cast the spell, or to tell Harry it’s already taken care of. At this point, he wouldn’t care even if the whole opera house heard his gasp. Malfoy slides from his seat and sinks to his knees, between Harry’s spread legs. In the darkness, only lit by the spotlights on the stage, his neat white-blond hair forms a halo around his head. He looks like a debauched, fallen angel, about to send Harry to hell — or, more likely, to heaven — and to do so with a ferocious grin on his face.
the note read.
Harry shakes his head, as annoyed at Malfoy as he is at himself. He turns his attention back to the stage. The lead danseur has gone off backstage. A flock of tutu-clad ballerinas hop and twirl in time with the bracing music.
Tchaikovsky, on the other hand, has been soft on Harry’s palate so far.
“Do you mind if he’s here?” Draco asked.
to do an interview with me isn’t?”
Hermione beamed. “Stop it, the two of you. I can barely take a compliment from Ron, now if Draco Malfoy of all people joins in...”
Draco watches him, his tongue pushing at the inside of his cheek.
“Since we’re supposed to help each other decide what our ideal jobs would be, may I ask you a question?”
Draco backs away a step. “It may seem harmless to you, but this is serious, Harry. I'm keeping Ernestina's secret. I'm not risking her being on trial, getting sent Merlin knows where. We are not telling anyone about Nesting!”
Weasely must have bigger bollocks than Draco gave him credit for if he could handle her.
Harry threw Draco a look over his shoulder. “Of course it bloody well would be. The crowning jewel of your career, really.” He turned towards Draco and set his teacup on the wooden countertop. He leaned on his elbows and peered into Draco’s eyes for a long moment.
Then Malfoy stands, buttoning his suit jacket as he slowly walks around the desk. He starts pacing the length of the room, not looking Harry’s way.
and Daddy will dance with Harry. I will play, and Harry will take Daddy for a spin. (Like they do when they think I'm not looking.) Daddy will take Harry's face in his hands and kiss him like he does when he thinks I'm not looking. (On the lips. Eyes closed. Smiling.) (I'm looking a lot more often than they think.) They will dance together. (That slow, swaying hug they call dancing.) Balzac will bounce around them, will bark like he does when he's laughing. My magic will wrap around me like a sunny cloud. Like a blanket. I will play, and play, and play.
“Potter, you uncouth heathen. It’s your last hour on earth and you choose to fill it with an unhealthy amount of fat and sugar. How unexpected.”
Behind him, Harry lets out a humourless laugh and pushes his fingers deeper. “You're even bossier up in your office, aren't you?”
“Harry—”
“You wanted to decide the winner,” Harry said, holding on to Malfoy’s disheveled shirt.
Suddenly, the Warming charms they had cast all over the balcony hadn’t been enough. The cold wind of December had pierced their protective bubble, the snow had resumed its fall, and Draco had shivered in his cloak.
Those cool grey eyes as they met Harry’s across the dancefloor. The way they widened a fraction, the way Malfoy’s pale cheeks pinked, his expressive face betraying his emotions as clearly as it had ten years ago…
“One reason, Potter,” he snarls, grabbing Harry by the front of his hospital robes and yanking. “I asked for one reason.”
This is the reason why he follows Kingsley into his office expecting to see both his friends there.
“Makes you the only person in Britain, then,” Draco scoffed. Merlin, how the man had a way of pushing all of his buttons. On one occasion,
Yes. Thank you, love.
Mephistopheles narrowed his eyes at Draco.
Hermione tilts her head to the side. “But…?” she prods.
“Shush, love, you'll wake her,” Harry whispered, grabbing Draco's hand and giving it a squeeze. “
His past. His present.
“I’ll tell you what’s instinct, Harry. Instinct is the thing that’s telling me this is a very,
He shakes his head, chasing the thoughts away, and reaches for his joggers and his favourite Nike trainers. He’ll need to talk to Harry eventually, soon. Without breaking down.
“I sure hope we are, babe,” he said. “Let’s show ‘em.”
Malfoy’s cheekbones turned pink. His throat worked.
And maybe.
“How much effort do you put into avoiding me?”
The Prothimioscope still spinning merrily at the end of the island’s countertop.
“Not bad, Malfoy,” he says out loud with a sigh, his hands on his hips.
“I think so,” Harry sighs. “Last night, we…” He feels his face heat. Ron and Hermione exchange a glance. “We’re definitely together. His mother knows… maybe even his friends.”
full of forgotten things that made Draco wish he could disappear and be forgotten too; Potter’s eyes always on him, always — unrelenting, no trace of mercy in them. Draco slipped under the covers of Pansy’s bed, burrowed against her and Blaise’s warm bodies, let them touch him and kiss him and fuck him until his mind was blank — just for a few moments.
It’s not phrased as a question, but Harry hears it nonetheless.
on Luna and Neville’s kitchen island.”
For some reason, Harry is reminded of Draco, and the way he seamlessly mixes magic and Muggle influences in his daily life.
Draco stood still.
In the past weeks, he’s dreamed about having a man in his bed so often he’s lost count of the versions he envisioned. None of them compare to the man by his side now. Malfoy watches him, propped on an elbow, flushed chest rising and falling with every rapid breath, legs entwined with Harry’s. His hard cock juts out a thatch of dark blond curls, slender and pink and twitching. Harry’s mouth waters at the sight.
Luna said, her calm voice and fuzzy blond hair making her look like she was floating two inches above the ground, “and Harry chose Draco. Look at our auras, Ron: all shimmering pink and red and gold. Like yours and Hermione’s.” She dreamily smiled at Draco from across the table. Jeff the Niffler poked his twitching nose out of her cardigan’s pocket. “I’m so happy for you, Draco.”
Interesting…
“Draco!” she squealed. Draco put his hand over her mouth again. She shook out of his grip. “I can’t believe it! You have a boyfriend! Oh,” she wrung her hands enthusiastically, “and it’s Potter! You've lusted after him for
And leaning in, he took Harry’s cock in his mouth for good.
She’s
There are papers and parchments thrown everywhere; books and records fallen from the shelves; still-steaming burn holes in the carpets. The unicorn and dragons chair is lying on its side, upturned. Someone put out the fire in the hearth, and the study is plunged into half-darkness. The only source of light comes from the French doors that have been thrown open; they’re letting in rays of sun and a warm, gentle breeze, completely at odds with the scene.
Harry drops onto the covers with a groan. “I suppose it is. Sorry.”
Harry grins at him. “Should I expect an announcement in the post soon?”
One arm holding Draco up against the door, Harry unzipped Draco’s trousers and pulled them down with his pants. He closed his other fist around Draco’s cock and stroked him frantically, his jeans still bunched around his legs, his softening, wet cock brushing against the hairs on Draco’s thighs. Barely aware of anything save for Harry’s hot panting breaths on his face and Harry’s hand wanking him in time with them, Draco let his eyelids drop. Harry’s gaze was fixed on him and Draco forced himself to maintain eye contact. It was the most painfully intimate thing he’d ever experienced. He’d have averted his eyes, were he not drunk on Harry, taken over by the feel of him, by the love and the lust radiating from his body like the soft buzz of magic. Harry twisted his wrist and Draco stilled and came in a blaze of euphoric heat, his vision going white as he felt his come splatter the front of Harry's shirt and drip on his fist.
That day, Malfoy was dressed all in black. Nothing new, that. But not traditional wizarding robes like he used to wear at Hogwarts. Fuck, no. The opposite of that. He was wearing the tightest shirt, right sleeve rolled up to his elbow; the skinniest jeans, hugging his… his
Dear Drake,
“God,” is all he can think to say.
You don’t have to answer, of course. I won’t tell anyone. I’m just interested in you.
“So you steal from them… why? Because they won’t notice a few missing bank notes in their wallets? Or out of petty revenge?”
It’s that no one running this place has the common sense to do it. And
“Why did you really call me in today, Kingsley?”
“Aaaargh!!”
Four pairs of eyes snapped to him.
Harry can’t tell if the band playing old Celestina Warbeck favourites is getting louder as the night wears on, or if he’s reached the point of a mild-headache and one too many whiskies.
“Well, he did manage to pull Harry Potter,” Blaise waggles his eyebrows and winks at Harry.
“I don’t. And I won’t write anything about you.”
He runs after Scorpius.
What’s it like to have such a wonderful, sexy boyfriend?
Draco exhales a soft laugh. “I would not have lived as long as I have without your help, that’s for sure.”
Harry swallows. “And now you’re not?”
Harry lets out a rueful little laugh. “You know what I mean, Ron.”
That he’s desperately in love with Draco?
Harry grabs his wrist as Malfoy moves to pass him by. Malfoy freezes. His eyes slowly drop to the place where Harry’s touching him, then drift back up.
“I remember,” Draco pretends to concede with good grace. “I was bigoted, prejudiced, and spouting out whatever fucking horrible worldviews my father had fed me since I was born.”
In the upcoming weeks, it soon became apparent that the students favored playtime and drawing hour more than the time they spent on academic learning. Gabrielle and Harry were always exhausted come nap-time. This year's class seemed to be much more energetic than the classes they had taught before.
In fact, that was exactly what she was doing. Harry didn't do well with gratitude, so he just smiled sheepishly while she articulated her appreciation. "He has changed so much over this past year," she said. "I know Draco won't tell you himself, but the kindness you have shown Scorpius has made him grow leaps and bounds."
Harry guffawed and elbowed Draco in the ribs. "Yeah, I see that." He began walking towards the sounds of excited unwrapping and gasps. "Did you get me a present?"
"Did you throw all those things just now?"
"He had to go." Draco poured a glass of warm milk for Scorpius. He paused when he properly took in the state of his bedraggled son. Scorpius had a trail of dried drool on the corner of his mouth, his hair was a fright, and his eyes were barely cracked open. "Ah, so we aren't bothering with a morning brush these days?"
Teddy and Harry skidded behind the blocks of snow to hide from the deluge of snowballs following them. Their measly shelter had, when they initially built it, seemed strong and high enough. Now they realized their wall of snow was no match for the Malfoy onslaught. They cowered as snow began to pour over and through their blockade. There was no escape. By the time Draco and Scorpius got to them, Harry and Teddy were half buried in a snowbank. Scorpius cackled in glee, adding insult to injury by scooping more snow off the ground and dumping it on them. Draco had his head cocked to the side and asked, "Give up yet?"
He really did start to depend on Harry too much these days.
"But it's just up the way!" Harry exclaimed. "We're almost there already. No one's going home." He grabbed a fistful of Draco's shirt and pulled him onward. Scorpius had to follow since Draco held onto his hand. Neither Malfoy uttered a word as they stumbled over pebbles. "You two
"Of course."
Scorpius wants a dog? Just get him a goldfish. Close enough. Problem solved.
Harry resisted rolling his eyes. "No, not dating. Hmm,
Draco didn't say.
Draco cleared his throat. "What are you talking about?"
Scorpius peeked over Draco's shoulder to look at Harry. Then he mumbled, "Bye, Harry."
"Are you alright with this?"
He straightened up in a flash, but his lips stayed pressed against Harry's. He lost himself between dream and reality. It was a long minute before he came to his senses.
Harry took in the beautiful words and colour. He imagined Draco and Scorpius sitting in the playroom, hunched over the small desk, bickering about how best to tug at Harry's heartstrings, thinking up the perfect words, painstakingly colouring within the lines, and now impatiently waiting for an answer.
"Yes." Draco sighed. "I'm sorry."
"Sometimes apologizing is just the first step. Remember that time you spilled ink on your father's books? You apologized. Then what did we do?"
It wasn't often that Astoria wanted to have a serious discussion with Draco, so he paid attention. "Alright," he said slowly.
"Ahem."
"Oh," Draco groaned and turned his head to hide his face against his arm. "I see."
After storming out of 12 Grimmauld Place, Scorpius had gotten a little further than a block when Draco had caught up to him. Once they had arrived at the Malfoy Manor, the two of them had screamed their voices away until they were red in the face. They hadn't spoken to each other since, not really. Draco threw himself at work, taking on any cases he could get his hands on. Scorpius spent his days with Patricia. They ate dinner in relative silence. Summer was ending that way, in relative silence...
"He's always wanted to meet you, you know?"
"Oh, such a tragedy."
"What do you mean what am I doing here?" Ginny held up the bane of Harry's existence at that moment – the dratted Witch Weekly. "What are
Harry, however, didn't move to leave. "Hey. Would it bother you if I said something?"
stop yourself from eating it?"
Draco didn't know why he was surprised. He huffed and went upstairs to shake the boys awake. The manor was bustling that morning once Teddy and Scorpius were properly up. They couldn't believe their eyes when they saw the huge stack of chocolate chip pancakes that awaited them. Astoria had lots of stories to tell them about the party she had attended the night before. Crackling Christmas music blared through. Laughter and exclamations were heard from the dining room while Draco kept an eye on the eggs and bacon. Astoria did nothing halfheartedly. Draco had to draw the line at cookies for breakfast. Astoria tried using her charms on him, but he didn't budge. Her feminine wiles no longer worked on him. "No cookies," he stood firm.
Scorpius turned bright red. "H-he didn't-I-He's-"
"I broke my collarbone," Harry said preemptively as he got up to his feet.
Scorpius looked up upon hearing a change in his father's tone. "No, I do," he quickly said. "It's just that at Annie's birthday party I had a lot of fun. I was thinking..." He trailed off when he realized that Draco had yet to meet his eye, and he knew the answer. So he shook his head. "I bet no one's going to be around anyway because it's Easter break." Nothing more was said about that topic.
"I might have." Harry was sheepish, because he knew Scorpius had been hesitant about those artworks.
"So fast," Scorpius whispered back.
Draco had been watching him change right before his eyes since September. "It's school," he said. "You read about it in books, you know, how his personality will develop once he socializes and all that. I never realized just how much he would change. The things he says are… terrifying, really. He's so smart." Draco reached out to push a lock of pale blonde hair away from Scorpius' shut eyes. "Harry says he is respectful and kind. He's a perfectionist. Works hard at school."
The dimly lit bedroom had previously been filled with quiet breathing and stifled snores. Now the sound of flapping wings and harried hoots was enough of a wake-up call despite it being an hour too early.
Draco turned to Harry incredulously when he heard the defeated mutter, and his bewilderment doubled when Harry leaned in and kissed him.
Harry scoffed. "You're such a ponce, Malfoy."
"Hmm."
Draco realized he had touched a nerve. He was surprised that Harry hadn't given this much thought. "Or do we pretend to be completely normal and try not to kill each other?" he pressed on. "Because he's got it in his head that you and Teddy are part of the family. He won't let go."
"No kidding." Hermione huffed. "You know me, I am never one to balk at bureaucracy. But even I have my limits! I have had an absolutely hectic month. Yesterday, I was speaking with the Ministry of International-"
Scorpius brought his teddy up to his face and hid behind it as he shook his head. He knew he would start crying again if he talked about it. He shouldn't have tried to climb up all the way to the top. He should have known that he would tumble off the play set. He was so embarrassed. Everyone had seen him fall and surely everyone was laughing at him for crying. He didn't want to cry anymore. But thinking about crying made him want to cry some more.
"I'm not hungry."
"Hmm?" Hermione glanced up from the wreath and quirked a brow at Harry. "What is it?"
Harry was utterly confused as he leaned against the wall opposite the nurse's room.
No one spoke for the longest time. The Weasleys were trying to make sense of the scene they had walked in on. Harry stood in front of them with an arm in a sling, a slow bruise blooming on his cheek. Draco appeared rather like a spooked deer, perched on the edge of the hospital bed. Scorpius quickly let go of Harry's hand and gawked back at the Weasleys, wide eyed and slack jawed.
Things were left unsaid.
"I said it was a surprise, didn't I?"
"Okay. You too."
"Of course."
he had said it, and wondering why he would say such a thing. Harry wasn't oblivious to the treatment of 'war criminals' around him. He knew how the Malfoys, Lestranges, and Carrows were treated these days. But for a five year old to say something like that was so unnerving.
Harry was bewildered by Draco's outburst. "... O-okay. I'll listen."
"That's too bad." She let the door swing shut as she disappeared into the dining room to relay the unfortunate news to the boys.
"Not particularly." Draco walked away after making that vague comment.
Harry pulled him back down. "I said listen."
Caught completely off guard, Harry snorted and let out a defeated chuckle. He should have known. Luna was the most romantic of them all. He helped her up onto the bank and squeezed her hand hard to show that he appreciated her. "What if you thought of it as damage control?"
Almost too vague.
He leaned back slightly to eavesdrop, letting his spoon rest on the lid of his lunchbox. Gossip about Harry Potter was something he couldn't ignore.
"Oh? Why's that?"
He didn't have to think hard about that at all. "Scorpius."
"I just want to meet him," Theo frowned. "What's wrong with that? Haven't seen him in, what, ten years?"
Scorpius pulled a large piece of chart paper close to them. "Do you want to help me some more?" he asked. "We'll stick the leaves nicely on here to show my teachers. We have to make it look like a tree."
Draco couldn't argue with that. His gaze carefully averted, he said, "He is."
Draco shook his head in defeat. "You're already extra nice to me." He turned around and handed the plate to his son. "You're already taking care of me just by being with me."
Hermione tipped her head to the side and whispered, "He's a precious boy."
"I would rather have him learn at home. Private tutors and all. But Astoria has less sentimentality than me, I suppose, so it was easy for her to see the big picture."
"Just past nine." Draco brought the coffee to Harry, who took it gratefully. "Boys aren't awake yet. Breakfast?"
Teddy blew on the toasty marshmallow to cool it down before sliding it off the roaster. He handed it to Scorpius and said, "Prepare to have your entire world flip upside down."
When Harry arrived at the grounds of the Malfoy estate that evening, he saw Scorpius and Draco flying high ahead. He walked over to the clearing by the trees as he watched Scorpius go through a few false starts before gathering up the courage to swoop forward and up, and then jerk his broom even further back to complete a tight backward roll. From the loud exclamation that followed, it seemed Scorpius had surprised himself with that move. As he celebrated by flying wildly around his father, he caught a glimpse of Harry watching down below.
Draco let out a defeated sigh and took a sip.
"You'll forget some of it?"
Draco sighed awake as he felt his son shift beside him. The first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was a very sly smirk.
"Potter."
Years ago, after the war, it was standard procedure for all Death Eaters to be questioned using the truth serum. Testimonies given under the effects of Veritaserum were not admissible in trials, but it was still widely used in small doses to verify details of a case. "You lose yourself." It seemed the Aurors had no qualms about using it for their own purposes. The memories still terrified Draco, of sitting in a small room on a cold chair, barely able to focus on the wizard standing across from him asking questions, words tumbling out of his mouth without him really knowing what he was saying. "I don't want to go through it again."
"You shouldn't put up with it."
Astoria had asked herself that question years ago. "I think it's too late now," she murmured.
"I see." Harry's situation couldn't be any more different from Draco's. "Everyone expects us to be together," he said. "And we always tried. We still try sometimes." Harry often couldn't imagine life without Ginny, but sometimes it was difficult to imagine a life
"Certainly, your majesty," Draco drawled as he got up. "Potter?"
"Let's draw something," Teddy said. He breathed against the window to fog it up. Scorpius followed suit. "The best part is that you can't mess up." Teddy used his finger to draw a stickman. "If you do, you just have to wipe it off and start again." Scorpius began to draw a flower on the glass.
"Hope this isn't a bad time," Harry said.
Draco, like his son, was going to say his piece now that he finally had his chance with Harry. "From the beginning, I had my concerns, and I haven't tried to hide that from you. I have responsibilities, with Scorpius. I have a past. I hadn't planned for... you. We got caught up in the novelty for a while, but I always knew in the back of my mind that something had to give. When those photographs..." He broke off and cleared his throat. "It became real. Scorpius and I, we were scared. To have our faces splashed on a magazine for everyone to laugh at, it's what I had been dreading. It's how I had expected everything to end. I had imagined that, when it did end, I would be fine. We would be fine. It wouldn't matter." He looked away to steel his nerves, focusing on his frozen socked feet instead. The faster he finished speaking, the faster his toes would thaw out. "Then I saw you with Ginny and- I remembered that night you asked if I would go with you to the gala. I said no. That's the thing, Harry. I will always say no. Someone like her, she would say yes." He looked up at Harry.
you, that is."
“Oh, god, you like it,” Malfoy says between two panting breaths, “you like it too.” His expression is open and awestruck, unlike anything Harry’s ever seen on his face, and god, yes, Harry likes it, loves it. Loves Malfoy for it. Malfoy arches into his touch like a cat in heat. “Touch me,” he pleads, “touch my cock, I want to come with your cock in me, come on, Potter—”
Harry relaxed a little, mirroring Malfoy’s languid pose at the other side of the bench.
Harry, however, froze in the middle of the living room, wide green eyes fixed on Draco.
Malfoy stares at him for a second, seemingly at a loss for words. Then his mouth twists in a small smile — the first one Harry’s seen on him.
And somehow this is Harry's fault. When Malfoy’s the one who left Harry without a word of explanation, left him alone to fret and second-guess himself and be deeply miserable for weeks.
Merlin. For all Draco had wanted this—had extensively fantasized about this—he could never have imagined what the first pump of his mouth around Harry’s prick would feel like. Lips stretched around the girth of it, the soft wet slide of his tongue along the veined underside, Harry trembling and breathing hard above him—
excluded.
“Did… did something happen?” Hermione asks him, eyes wide. “With Draco?”
When Harry shakes his head, she laughs, incredulous. It’s like being back at Hogwarts again. She brushes a curl out of her eyes and continues, the excited look back on her face. “It’s funny, because I had the idea watching Arthur try to fold my children’s pushchair using magic. It looked so tedious and complicated, when it’s the easiest thing in the world when you do it the Muggle way… I figured, everything about magic or Muggle life is a little bit like this; sometimes it’s best to do things with magic, and sometimes it’s more efficient to do things like a Muggle. Except as witches and wizards, we tend to overlook that Muggles have a depth of knowledge, resourcefulness and practical minds that some magic people lack.”
Ron’s in the cloakroom. And he doesn't sound like tipsy Ron, either; he has his Senior Auror voice on. Did he hear anything? Did he come here because he thought Harry’s disappearance was suspicious?
The way he said the word made Harry groan, his cock twitching needily against his belly. “Mmh, yes,” Malfoy said quietly. “You really want this, don’t you?” He sat back on his knees so that Harry could see his face. With a smirk that looked too confident for Harry’s good, he brought his middle finger to his mouth and sucked it in with a moan, slowly,
Malfoy laughed. A genuine,
He stopped himself, not wanting to spoil the moment.
“I must object,” Draco said, stepping closer to Harry while the others resumed gathering snow a few feet away from them.
Harry’s gut feels like ice, but he nods. He has no other choice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry’s not sure how to answer that. “I don’t think so… not that I could tell. It took him a while to settle.”
It's incredibly ill-advised, dangerous, and exhilarating all at once.
“So let’s get cracking, shall we?”
What hurt more than the pain of the fall was the feeling of five pairs of Gryffindor eyes on him. There had been witnesses to his failure. Draco closed his eyes and thumped his forehead on the unforgiving ice.
Harry laughed and nodded once.
“I don’t know what’s scarier. That a test might tell me what I should do with my life, or that the answer to this question is within a few wand movements’ reach.”
“Potter,” he said when his old arch-nemesis reached him. He did his best to sound cold and spiteful. The music was loud enough to cover the faint tremble of his voice, wasn’t it?
And though he’d much rather spend the evening in his pyjamas, watching telly while eating greasy fish and chips straight out of the bag and passing out on the couch, Hermione’s done a lot for him lately. Just because he chooses to wallow in the shambles of his closeted one-night-stand with Malfoy doesn’t mean he should forget how to be a good friend.
“I know that.”
What was he thinking? Didn’t he know he could die from this?
So he just follows Draco out of the bathroom, into the corridor—
Harry smiled.
Ron shakes his head minutely. “Merlin. You’re lucky he didn’t hex your other arm off.”
Feels the brush of Malfoy’s chest against his own, crowding him with every breath.
“Exactly!” Draco exclaims. He and Hermione look like they’re about to invite everyone for a round dance. “That’s what Caduceus is about! You can’t have a potions company without a proper Research and Development department.”
“You know,” he purred, “earlier, when you did that thing... with your finger?”
Harry nods, mind blank.
you’re going to be good, don’t you?”
quiz?”
I’m coming, I’m coming. God.
Do you want to be fired before we even start?
“This isn’t goodbye. We’re still going to see each other.”
Ron groans in his hands. “I knew assigning you to this case was a mistake.”
“If you’re worried about me mocking your Muggle tastes, you’re sadly mistaken, Potter,” he said haughtily. “I’m a changed person, if you haven’t noticed.”
This interdepartmental memo is to inform you that the bet you took last Friday night at the pub was rightfully won by Hermione Granger, Unspeakable (and colleague of the undersigned).
Refusing to let his guilt take over, Harry leans back in his chair. He’s had ample time to examine his feelings about the fight he’d had with Malfoy in that dark, abandoned bathroom, and the blood-curdling realisation that Malfoy could have been the first person — the
Because Scorpius is crying out — a long, loud, uninterrupted sound, like an animal in pain — and the shelves are starting to shake. Everyone in the room has frozen in mute dread — and the little boy keeps crying, crying, crying, as the books and records on the shelves rattle ominously, as the lid of the grand piano bangs open, as the keys start to play all together, a discordant cacophony that barely covers Scorpius’s scream. Then the keys lift off the piano like a wave—
me, for Merlin’s sake, and I'll have you know, I can remember plenty.”
“Private, my arse,” Lavender shakes her head. “You couldn’t help bragging about your conquests if you tried!”
Harry squared his jaw. “I know
Draco sets his jaw, turns on his heels, and stalks away.
Dear Draco,
Draco listens to the whole exchange quietly, with only his eyebrow hitching higher and higher to showcase his scepticism. He takes a long sip of his morning Earl Grey, then sets the cup on his desk, fingers curled around the delicate handle, little finger lifted up.
Draco strode over to the fireplace. “Beg pardon? What sort of pet—?” He flinched when he saw the tiny curled up creature softly snarling as it slept. “Oh no. Oh no no
He shoves Malfoy against the line of coats.
At the end of the room stands Draco, his back against the record shelves, his wand drawn and pointed at Smith. His eyes are following Smith’s movements, haughtiness and contempt written all over his face. It’s only when he sees Harry and Scorpius on the threshold that his stance falters. Unnoticed by the Aurors and Smith, Harry takes his wand out, hoping Draco can hold his own, hoping Scorpius can stay quiet.
“Thanks?” Draco shifted on his stool. “Anyway...would you say your relationship played a part in your post-war reconstruction as well?”
Draco pressed the swollen head of his cock against Harry’s entrance. It was still tight. He wanted to wait, but Harry rocked back, fitting Draco inside him an inch further.
Harry gave Malfoy his best sneer. “We’re here because of
make you less worthy to be heard.”
“Not making it cheerier, Luna,” Ron grumbled.
Christmas day at the Weasley’s house was exactly as Draco expected: utter chaos. The dining room was a sea of red-haired, freckled people and multicoloured homemade Christmas jumpers, the living room was a cacophonous mess of small children playing Exploding Snap, and the kitchen was filled with teetering piles of dishes and gently floating plates overflowing with roast potatoes, mash, peas and carrots.
Draco eyed him warily. “Are you making fun of me?”
“You checked?”
And then Harry was pulling him up by the arm and pinning him against the door. There was a split second where Draco wondered if Harry would want to kiss him after what he’d just done. But Harry crashed his mouth against his, desperately licking his lips until Draco opened up under him and brushed his tongue against Draco’s, tasting the bitterness and the want.
Balzac barks and wags his tail and lets go of Harry, settling at his feet and looking up at him with soft brown eyes.
I know what you’re doing, and
She’s the one waiting at the door, indeed, and she does look him up and down when he opens the door. Her pinched, judgmental expression only softens when she sees Harry’s sheepish air, bottom lip caught between his teeth. Next to her, the tiny pushchair she and Ron bought when Rose was born shakes with one sharp little cry, and a miniscule hand appears from between the swaddles.
“That’s much better. I love it when you ask… nicely.”
“Hi Balzac. Good boy. How’ve you been?”
There have already been too many times where he forgot his purpose. Too many times where his conversations with Draco started from an entirely genuine place. Too many open, unguarded looks exchanged between them. Too many reasons to care far too much about what happens to Draco…
Malfoy turns and hurtles down the narrow staircase. Harry knows better than to run after him.
“I browsed the book you gave me,” Harry said. The
“Yes, really subtle,” Draco smiled back. A shy smile, but a smile, nonetheless. “I expected nothing less from the woman who left me feeling like I’d been beaten in the gut all day by a very persistent truth stick.”
Harry
in the twitching of his whiskers. Draco blushed and pulled his blankets higher against his chest.
Draco almost tripped, catching himself on the banister at the last second. He was about to answer
“Right,” Harry says, shoving his wand in his back pocket. It’s June fifth. Of course. He’s totally forgotten about the date and what it means. Great way to start a new relationship, surely. He works very hard not to fidget under the piercing blue gaze of Draco’s mother. “Sorry I pointed my wand at you.”
Draco stilled. He had hoped... he had hoped for some sort of miracle. Maybe. Yet this was probably still his best chance.
Harry
It was Jeff the Niffler.
Draco smiles back at her over the table, and Harry wonders how he didn’t notice Draco and his best friend becoming…
In three steps, he’s by Harry’s bed, one knee on the mattress, reaching for Harry's t-shirt. He grabs a fistful of it and pulls Harry in. They meet halfway, lips crashing, heat surging between them. For a brief moment, they’re half kissing, half wrestling, Malfoy’s hands running down Harry’s back, Harry’s hands threading in Malfoy’s hair, and no space to break for air. With a tug on Malfoy’s collar, Harry pulls him down with him, collapsing on the bed. They let go for a beat, panting. Harry can’t stop his hips from pushing up against Malfoy. With a desperate groan, he reaches up and kisses him again. When they break for air, Malfoy looks down at him with a frown. “Merlin, the things I want to do to you…” he growls. “How can you pretend you have no clue what you’re doing?” And then he dives into another searing kiss.
“Yes,” Harry hissed, letting go of Malfoy’s hair and guiding his hand to the bulge of his aching erection. Malfoy’s hand cupped him through his trousers and he heard his breath catch against his neck. Carefully, they both breathed again.
I apologise for not telling you about everything I liked, that kept me returning to the theatre night after night. The play was all right, I suppose (this is coming from someone who doesn’t know the first thing about plays and theatre, mind you) but you, Drake… you were fantastic. Your presence lit up the stage. I mean, obviously it did, with a face like yours and hair like yours and that voice… so deep and steady, so convincing, it made me forget I was watching a live play at times. It pulled me right into the action, your character’s motives and emotions. You’re a glorious actor, and singer, and I’d forgotten how beautiful you are and I wish Cecilia would have dragged me to the West End sooner, if it meant seeing you in more of your previous plays.
by Sixpence None The Richer.
Harry and Draco had ended up telling her exactly
Maybe that also explains why the lights are so blinding.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Shocking. Although... She is frighteningly clever, I admit. Besides, with her Muggle background, she might even know about Muggle jobs, which the wizarding books I found in the Library can’t help us with.”
For him, and for Harry.
His hand jerked away from his prick so fast he almost toppled over and out of the bed. This time, there was no doubt. Someone was in Draco’s bed. Panting hard, he sat up and pulled the covers over his straining cock.
Malfoy’s face is inscrutable. “I must say, of all the applications I expected to receive when I asked Jemima to publish this job listing, Harry Potter’s was possibly the last one I would have thought of.” He lifts his cool grey eyes to Harry’s. “I shall ask this only once, because I need to make sure, for my own peace of mind.” He drops the parchment on the desk. “What the actual
“Catch,” he says, and throws the balled-up t-shirt in Harry’s direction. Harry reflexively grabs it and holds it against his chest, his mouth hanging open a bit in a way that makes Draco’s face heat. “And stop gawking, for fuck’s sake,” Draco snaps. It sounds an awful lot like teasing. “It’s like you’ve never seen a topless man before.”
“I was going to say it’s a calamity.” He’d corrected Potter for old times’ sake, though his heart wasn’t in it. Potter’s hand was strong and firm and enclosed Draco’s narrow palm and long fingers almost entirely. Hot tingles sparked in Draco’s belly. He dropped Potter’s hand, embarrassed by his body’s eager betrayal. “I’d been thinking that if I never saw your face again, it would be too soon.” Which was a big fat lie, as his browser history could attest.
Draco exhales a humourless laugh.
Draco's mouth thins. “Shacklebolt never forgave me for avoiding a sentence in Azkaban, did he?”
“What are you talking about?” Harry forces his voice not to tremble. His entire body seems to have frozen on the spot, rooted to the carpet underneath his clenched fists. “Draco… you weren’t weak. You weren’t
“Gentlemen,” she started. “I have called you in this evening to discuss the matter of your post-graduation career choices.”
“Merlin’s holy bollocks,” Malfoy said, and finally his mouth twisted up in a smile. “You think I’m fit. You’d like me to shag you. Oh, sweet Salazar. This is definitely worth being around for the end of the world.”
Speaking of arses, a sudden gust of wind had just whipped through Malfoy’s burgundy, standard-issue Auror cloak and exposed his shapely posterior for Harry to admire. Malfoy might be an uptight arsehole, but he was also annoyingly fit. A fact that was harder and harder for Harry to ignore each passing day, as he subtly observed Malfoy laughing with their Auror colleagues at the Ministry cafeteria, striding through the Auror department corridors like a young prince perusing his future kingdom, or brushing his hand through his short, stylish, impossibly blond hair when he was absorbed in case reports.
“You people have got to stop giving me frights!”
Draco took Jeff’s paw between his thumb and forefinger. He gave it a minute shake. “I do. Thank you.”
The word is like a punch to the solar plexus. Like Harry’s ribs tighten around his lungs.
“Longbottom,” Draco answered politely, albeit a bit stiffly. “Long time, no see.” He turned to Harry and forced a smile. Force of habit, however, made his smile feel more like a smirk. It was also force of habit, he supposed, if his voice came out in the trademark Malfoy drawl from their Hogwarts days. “Hello, Potter. I’m beginning to believe you’re stalking me.”
Ernestina hands a steaming mug to Malfoy, and then another one to Harry. Malfoy walks around the table and takes a seat across from Harry.
“Does that mean I can have you?” He asks.
Then he asked me not to tell Harry.
“Then I can’t tell you.”
This was the single hottest fuck he’d ever had.
“That’s all that matters, Potter,” he says at last. “That’s the most important. Letting ourselves
The thing is, I never go to the theatre. You see, I didn’t exactly grow up in a household of art lovers. My aunt and uncle probably filed performing arts under the ‘bloody useless waste of time and common sense’ category (perhaps with the exception of tired soap operas, in my aunt’s case), same as they felt for abstract paintings, installation art, and flash mobs.
why hadn’t he done this to Harry before? Harry was making the sweetest sounds above him, his legs shaking with the force of his pleasure. He pushed his arse against Draco’s face with tiny, needy thrusts, the tight muscle relaxing slowly under Draco’s tongue, so wet and ready for him. Suddenly, Draco had to fight the urge to stand and grab Harry’s hips, bend him over the island and mount him right then and there.
“Scorpius is a clever, brilliant, endearing child,” Malfoy snaps. “And yes. It goes without saying that getting on with him and treating him with respect are requirements for the job, even more so than everything else.”
He’d never cared for that particular brand of evil.
He shook his head with an incredulous smile. “You have to be kidding me. You’re one of the cleverest people I know, and I’m best friends with
“This is worse than the telling-off,” Harry had put his face in his hands and moaned into his bowl of soup.
After a beat, Harry and his friends had skated over to where Draco lay on the ice. Somehow it had been even worse than the fall: their solicitude had felt forced and unnatural coming from people who used to despise him. Harry had helped him up and they’d skated some more, but Draco had lost his spark and he couldn’t wait to leave the rink.
“My prick is about to fall off from the vigorous treatment you submitted it to, Potter,” he heard Malfoy say behind him, “but maybe I can give it a try.”
“For what exactly, Potter?” Draco’s tone is several degrees colder than Harry's ever heard it. He’s sitting very still, and the use of his last name is worse than if he’d slapped Harry in the face. Harry represses a shiver.
Draco did not have to be told twice. Turning away to conceal another blush, he made for the door, instinctively reaching into his pockets to check for his wand. Ever since Potter returned it to him after his hearing with the Wizengamot, Draco was quite possessive of it. Back at Malfoy Manor, he refused to keep it off his person, even when sleeping. It was not until he returned to Hogwarts that he felt comfortable enough to keep it farther away than an arm's reach. Whether the feeling of safety came from Hogwarts or the particular company he kept was a question Draco dared not answer.
What an absolute
"You're late," Parkinson said in mock surprise. "Let me guess: spending time with Potter again?" Her eyes shone with false curiosity. "Were you two studying in the library? Taking moonlit walks by the lake? Maybe brushing each other's hair and gazing endlessly into each other's eyes?"
"Okay, stop it!" Pansy snatched Draco's cup away, and he barely registered the soft burn of hot water droplets falling on his fingers. She placed the cup between them, and he grudgingly looked up.
"What's not to want?" Nott scoffed. "He's fit, popular, and a goody-two-shoes with a dark past. He's like a sexy little puzzle just waiting to be done."
And now, in view of all the school to see, Potter's touch did the same thing it always did: it guided Draco. Time returned to normal, and the voices of his classmates rose to regular volume. He could look into the green abyss of Potter's eyes without getting lost. He could fall without flying.
Draco groaned internally. It had been so much easier to simply believe Potter was a self-entitled prick and hate him for it. Now, he had no excuse to dislike Potter, none at all.
"Of course you don't," Pansy said smoothly, picking up her own cup and swirling it in her hands as well. Suddenly, she slammed it on the table, its contents spilling a bit. From his seat, Draco smelled the pungent fumes of alcohol; Pansy must be quite sick of his shit.
"I wonder what Potter's like as a boyfriend," Pansy mused, an ulterior meaning behind her words as she looked over at the Gryffindor table. "You think he's good at snogging?"
Having reached the bottom of the stairs, the two walked in companionable silence towards the Great Hall. Draco jostled when Potter's swinging arm touched his, their knuckles brushing so softly that it could have been the wind hitting him. Draco sighed quietly, realizing his inner turmoil was no use.
Only because he’s Head of Forensics, and I’m often in his lab. For
The rational part of Harry tells him to go down the stairs, towards the exit. It’s the logical path. If Malfoy had Disapparated, Harry would have noticed the tell-tale crack. It only made sense, then, that Malfoy would have left the venue through the doors… but there’s been no sound of Disapparition.
Love,
“You wouldn’t have witnessed any of it if you had announced yourself properly!”
“Turn around,” he orders, and Draco complies, pulling his trousers and pants down his thighs as he does. Harry crowds behind him, his hard cock already out, sliding against Draco’s bare arse. He grips Draco’s hips with possessive hands and shoves them back against him. “I wanted to fuck you long and slow,” he groans into Draco’s ear, leaning over his back, “but I’m going to take you like an animal. ‘Cause that’s what you want, right?”
Harry’s plan for his first week of employment is to create a set of habits for himself.
Greg lets out a rumbling laugh. “I’m flattered.”
crush? He’d thought he'd kept it so perfectly under wraps. Yes, he might have been a little obvious about it when he was fourteen, but since then, he’d done a brilliant job at hiding it. There was the time when Parvati had found the stack of Harry Potter-themed newspaper clippings and Witch Weekly covers hidden in Draco’s desk drawer but he’d thought he’d been most convincing at explaining it away

“No, but the investigation has just taken a new turn. Smith believes legal financial audits won’t be enough to uncover whatever provided Malfoy with the starting assets for
“Don’t bother. I like it that way.”
“Not too sure where she'll be, she's quite small.” Harry padded around the room, lifting up cushions and peering under an armchair.
Then Malfoy gets to work, and it’s every bit as sinfully glorious as Harry remembers. Music swells around him. A black-clad swan spins on the stage. Around them, nobody notices Harry’s soft moans and muffled gasps, Malfoy’s blond head bobbing between Harry’s parted legs. Nobody but Malfoy, who lays a hand on Harry's thigh as if to brace himself. Harry holds on to dear life on one armrest, and meets Malfoy’s unconscious touch with his other hand, twining his fingers with Malfoy’s.
This wasn’t going to be pleasant. But if Draco had learned anything over the course of a hundred lives, it was that what didn’t kill you... made you a more experienced demon.
“Don’t apologise. Especially not for giving me the mind-blowing orgasm I so deserved for putting up with you all night.” When Harry opens his eyes, Malfoy’s smirking down at him. There’s a fond glow to it, though, and Harry smiles back. “You’re welcome to fuck me anytime I request it.”
Malfoy lifts a perplexed eyebrow. “You do?”
“You have a point, Potter,” he says. His eyes crinkle for a second, before his expression turns completely serious once more. “Most people hate me.” He lifts a hand when Harry opens his mouth to interrupt — to protest. “They
“As if that woman didn't know exactly what she was doing.”
Draco’s heart sank. “Headmistress, this is not a thoughtless idea. I assumed it was just as valid to start the process by researching
They’re both quiet for a while. Harry’s silence is the busy kind, unpacking the tin foil, setting forks and glasses on the table, rummaging in cupboards for a bottle of wine that will pass the approval of Malfoy’s no doubt poshly sensitive palate. Malfoy’s silence is tense as he waves his wand at his shoulder in a clumsy left-handed gesture, pointedly not looking at Harry.
“Maybe we should let him go now!” Draco interjected, interrupting her. “The ravens are gone, he’s safe, isn’t he?”
“Morgana’s tits! The gay man thing! She’s right!” Lavender yelps, clapping her hands.
even as you’re floating in a sea of satiation. Listen to me. I didn’t know those feelings even existed. Thanks for introducing them to me. I feel ruined, but it’s all for a good cause.
“Mistor Potter says he is in the neighbourhood, sir,” Ernestina rolls her eyes, clearly not fooled. “If Mistor Draco wants to sees him now.”
May your holidays be as happy as Harry and Draco's ❤️
“Yeah. Not like McGonagall gave us a choice.” Harry said. Seemingly regretting his remark, he hastened to add, “Not that I mind. At all. I don’t mind doing this with you, just... Why d’you reckon McGonagall wanted this done in the middle of winter? I wonder why it couldn’t wait until we’re closer to the end of the school year.” He was attempting to sound casual and, in Draco’s opinion, failing.
assets to have on this case.”
Draco watched him, bewildered. “How is that funny?”
“I would have, because I actually care, Malfoy,” Harry growls back.
The sight of Malfoy in the DLF office, his back turned to Harry, striking a sexy pose to entertain his colleagues, struck Harry like a
From the corner of his eye, Harry caught the way Malfoy’s ears pinked at Smith’s unwitting implication.
Harry just gapes at him, unable to choose between offense and apology. That seems to irritate Malfoy even more. With a roll of his eyes — the mean kind, not the fond one he’s given Harry in the recent past — he sets the book on the coffee table and pushes up to his feet.
"Well I for one am glad you and Potter engage exclusively in boring activities. Means he has a need in life for real entertainment," Nott spoke up, wriggling his eyebrows at Draco. "Zabini and I have a wager, and all of you are invited to join. Especially you, Malfoy."
"If it makes any difference, the bet would just be for show. Wouldn't be fair if people found out you won without trying.” Potter's tone audibly softened. "But what’s not for show is this.” He waved their joined hands. “We can keep the most important stuff between us, like we always have."
It was the silence that took Draco’s attention away from his memories to the now.; Potter was never silent. Sneaking a glance, Draco found that Potter's expression was distant, his mind evidently elsewhere as well. Was he reminiscing on the sad memories, like the lonely childhood and bloody adulthood? Draco hoped not. He hoped Potter was reminiscing on the happy memories, like the laughter of his found family and the smiles of his infant godson. If Draco got to reminisce on his only happy memories from recent years, then so should Potter.
Harry Potter's life was nothing like the folklore the public, including Draco, had fabricated. Harry Potter did not grow up basking in fame. He did not capitalize off his father's wealth nor his godfather's enchanted home. He did not spend the war in a blaze of glory and triumph. And he certainly did not lap up the attention and adoration brought by saving the wizarding world yet again. No; the real Harry Potter was not only a great wizard, but a great man.
