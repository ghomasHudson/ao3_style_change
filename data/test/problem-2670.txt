“That’s one of the most idiotic ideas I have ever seen in long time.” Dawlish glared at Draco.
“Look up family records, account ledgers, travel expenses, journals of those names,” I said. “We have to trace their movements to see if we can come up with a list of possible hiding places for the Grimoire. In the meanwhile,” I waved my wand and a pile of books flew at us, “here are some books on magical cryptography and concealment methods to figure out why that book that I found is the key to finding the Grimoire.”
We crouched in the mud, waiting for Granger to give the signal. She was up ahead with the advance team, her eyes sharp, her attention focused and diligent.
“It’s not your fault,” Draco said, pushed in the uncomfortable position of consoling Harry. “You didn’t tie me up and throw me on the plane.” Unlike Dolohov and his men. “I came for my own reasons, and I came after you for my own reasons too.”
Harry reached over and pinned me to the bed. “I’m kind of sweaty right now,” he whispered, “but you don’t seem to mind that much.”
“You did follow me around a lot,” I pointed out, ignoring the pang of hurt at Harry’s refusal to name our relationship. I ignored the fact that I didn’t know what we were, either. “I’m surprised you didn’t follow me into the baths, though I suppose I should give thanks to that. My virtue remains intact.”
“We’re the ones stopping them!” Ron glared at Malfoy. “Don’t pretend like you don’t know that the Death Eaters are the ones extending their power in the Ministry by bribery and intimidation and forcing these unjust laws through. You can’t deny it. I know who you are. Your father –”
I only caught a glimpse of green, yet I knew it was the Grimoire.  My breath grew bated and my pulse quickened as I watched the man take out his wand.  He walked around the pillar thrice, mouthing words too quiet to hear. Licks of blue flames followed his footsteps.
Harry looked up, grinned at Hermione. “Want me to give you a kiss too?”
“I used your existing account and clearance as well as my own intimate knowledge of the database structure to find gaps in the Auror protections,” Hedwig said. She sounded rather miffed. “On the other hand, I do not have any preexisting knowledge of this console’s system, except its defenses are much more sophisticated than the average.”
“Is that why she dumped you?” Too late did I realize what I just said. “Shit. Sorry. I didn’t mean –”
“Hello, Potter.” Blaise gave him a predatory look. “You look good. And is that my tie?”
There was a little bell that signaled a visitor from the Floo.
“He’s with me,” Harry said tightly.
“We’re going to study them,” Shacklebolt said. “And maybe you’ll be interested in the effort.”
That shade of green and that snake ….
He couldn’t force Fletcher into divulging his sources. Draco was familiar with these types of men; he had encountered too many of them in his field. Sellers and buyers that always negotiated with one eye behind their backs for a bigger fish to bite their bait, and would slip off the hook faster than one blinked.
“It’s Slytherin’s.” My eyes fixed on it. I felt it calling to me; my fingers itched to touch it, open it. I wondered what secrets hid there, what power it had that caused Cross to resort to such desperate methods.
“Why do you turn away from me?” He spoke quietly, his voice barely louder than a whisper, and yet it reverberated throughout the entire cave. It seemed to rock my very bones.
“Its effect is psychological as well as physiological.” Malfoy tapped a few keys on his palmtop. “I’ll have to keep you here for observation for the next couple of days, to ensure that you aren’t suffering any adverse effects. From both the virus as well as the medication.”
Interesting. Her description, though vague and unhelpful, piqued Draco’s attention. Their visit had to be related to the intruders and the mystery behind his father’s papers.
Potter rubbed his eyes. “Like I’m back sitting for my OWLs and on desk duty at the Aurors at the same time. I was always better in the field. I don’t know how you do it.”
“Those men work for a criminal organization,” Shacklebolt said, “the same one that was linked to your father’s … work. They’re members of a syndicate called the Mors Mordre, a group that has been linked to financing terrorism, drug-dealing, assassinations, and other acts of political intimidation and violence. In other words, not very nice people.”
“Potter?”
The Pensieve glowed even brighter as we approached it, like it had sensed our approach, and the impending task we had for it. The bottle was warm, both from the memory inside and from where I clutched it tightly.
“Is that what happened to them?” I looked at her, appalled at such an act of violation against priceless historical artifacts.
“Ron, don’t be ridiculous,” Granger snapped. “Give Draco a gun. And bring some fresh clothes while you’re at it. You’re wasting time. There’s a reason why Harry brought him here, and I don’t think it’s for Draco to murder us all in our beds.”
Then -- “What do you want to know?” my father asked gruffly.
“Right.” Shacklebolt then followed up sternly: “We’re going to have to talk this breach of regulations when you come into the office tomorrow.”
“He means ‘yes’,” Harry said, before Ron gave a furious reply. He shot Malfoy a stern look. “Stop antagonizing my friends, Malfoy.”
“… Maybe.”
“It’s creepy in here,” Potter said. His voice bounced off the stones. He hastily lowered it. “No offense.”
Potter made an incoherent sound next to me, and I remembered I had one advantage here that I lacked time: Potter at my side. Despite my crack about his skills, he handled himself much better than I would have in his stead.
A flash filled the basement. Spending so much time in the darkness made it all the more blinding. My eyes watered even as I fell back. My foot caught on a piece of the flagstone, and I almost tripped. Potter’s blurry form blocked out part of the light as a loud keening cry sounded, followed by a quieter grunt of pain that I knew came from Potter.
“We kept the flat off limits to everyone since we called your office,” he said. His eyes darted between the two of them. “No one has been to the flat except for me.”
And the happiness at being safe, at Harry being unharmed, broke through Draco’s emotional dam. Draco embraced Harry tight – he didn’t want to let go again, not ever –
It would have to wait, however, as Draco was faced with an army of angry military officials waiting for him at the entrance.
I sat down and focused on my breathing. In … out … inhale … exhale …. I allowed myself to relax into my seat, letting the motion of air run through me as I rooted myself to my senses. I needed to remain calm. There was not much I could do without a wand. I could not Disapparate from this place. But I still had my intelligence, my arms and legs. I would not surrender so meekly.
“Now,” Slytherin said. “Come. Let us go back to the castle and enjoy my final repast.”
“It was my fault,” I said, not daring to shut my eyes. If I did, I would replay the exact moment – the flash of light, Harry jumping in front of me to take the curse –
“What?”
“There’s no need to pretend,” Malfoy said. “I’ve investigated quite thoroughly, and I am certain that you two made types of wands like this for the Order of the Phoenix. I have incontrovertible proof.”
Potter let out a frustrated sigh. “Hermione, you know I’m not doing that. Well – the lost cat bit.”
It didn’t stop. Instead, it grew louder, more insistent, pressing against his temple with almost physical force.
The Leaky Cauldron never seemed to change. Its grime, at least, was a constant. I sat down, taking care not to put my hands on the table. More often than not, the surface was sticky with some unidentifiable substance, probably a mix of spilled beer and dirt that accumulated since the pub opened.
Their footfalls were muffled but had a heart-stopping clarity that had Draco looking over his back very minute. It was too quiet, with the light from the streets hitting the floor at odd angles, creating sharp polygons of shadows that puddled ominously.
I knew that. But that day was not upon us yet.
“This is a business transaction, Mr. Fletcher,” Draco said, and his tone could freeze ice now. “Let’s try to be professional here.”
“Because those types of weapons are good as gold down there. If one of the gangs spots you with that, chances are you’d go to the top of their target list, along with Aurors and idiot Aboveworlders who offend them.” Malfoy looked at Harry pointedly.
“I assume you’ve heard of the Shield’s abilities?” At Draco’s nod, he said: “They’re true. The Shield can give you great insight into what is to come. It will be a great asset to further our master’s plans.”
“I’m afraid it’s for work,” Draco said.
Harry nudged Draco. “The stairwell’s that way.”
Harry did. And he surrendered to that. His hands scrabbled to find purchase on the sheets as he arched, seeking more relief in that velvet mouth. Harry was determined to not make a sound. He was determined not to give into the tremors strumming through his body.
“What kind of cases have you taken on, then?”
Draco glowered at Harry. “You break it, you pay for it. This is my family’s resting place. Be respectful.”
“Wait here,” mouthed Harry. Draco nodded.
“Er –”
“Stupefy!”
Damn. Harry was looking at me like he wanted to drag me off to the alley ahead and have his way with me. By this rate, we were never going to get anything done.
Potter relaxed. “I guess it’s a good thing I’m an only child. Sorry about your friends, though.” As a precaution, I had sent a note around to my usual group that I had gone abroad for an extended research trip and that I would have little time to respond to letters. I even included a postcard. I missed them. Seeing Potter and the Weasley and the Granger together … it reminded me Millicent’s sharp, no-bullshit manner, and of Goyle’s blustering kindness, and of Blaise’s flirtatious protectiveness.
I twirled my wand as I wracked my mind. I confirmed that this book definitely was concealed by an enchantment. What now?
“That isn’t what we want,” Dawlish said. “If we just wanted the papers, we would’ve just taken them.”
He really had a great smile, I thought. It wasn’t as dazzling as Blaise’s, but it was more … approachable. It didn’t leave me breathless, but it warmed me, like coming inside after being stuck in the rain.
Harry had insisted on bringing one, and it was thanks to the lax oversight for the private jet crowd that he had managed to slip it through customs. It was one of the modified ones from the Service, a Walther that was sealed and armored so it could be fired underwater.
“To new business ventures.”
This time, there was no assassin, no frenzied car chase through the city. They could enjoy the slowness, like moving through honey, knowing that whatever tomorrow brings, they would always have this between the two of them.
Cross reacted, his wand slashing out at me before I could blink. A red heat caught on my chest, even as I hurriedly shielded myself.
Nevertheless, he did pick up the pace.
“Free spirit, Malfoy.” He increased the pressure, keeping my hand in place on his chest. “It’s called being a free spirit. And you know you want this.”
But no matter. Cross is not the type of man to dwell in the past. Particularly on events that occurred a thousand years ago. Already, a plan is forming in his head for tomorrow ….
Malfoy mirrored Harry and stripped, in a motion more graceful and smooth than Harry’s. His body gleamed in the soft light from the lamps: smooth, slightly build, and yet none the less muscular for it.
Harry didn’t live Underground. Nor did he wish to. He had ambitions, dreams which were yet unfulfilled, and if he had to defer his personal nature, or at the very least be unobtrusive, then so be it.
Someone had ransacked it.
“Are you offering to help?” I asked. “Because if so, I’m still not sharing the byline.” I considered. “Maybe in the acknowledgments.”
“I suppose it’s not an everyday issue that has a senior Auror coming to my door,” Malfoy said at last. “This problem better be interesting.”
They sat in silence, looking out in the distance.
“I’ll have you know my hair is perfectly fine,” Potter said with wounded pride. “Yours, on the other hand, has a leaf in it.”
“After you, Commander Potter.”
My jaws clenched. But Potter seemed genuine in his sympathy. It probably was a poor display, especially compared to what he must be used to, with the Weasley and his friends. I forced myself to relax. “I should be the one to apologize to you. I didn’t expect my father would forget his manners so easily … but you being you, I suppose some leeway should be given.”
“We can discuss this all at a later time,” Shacklebolt said, seeing Draco stifle a yawn. “You must be tired after all this. I’ll have someone take you to rest.”
The cold nipped at their skin. Stifling the urge to sneeze, Draco pulled his jacket closer. Next to him, Harry rubbed his arms.
Hollowness expanded in Draco’s chest. Somehow, the revelation did not shake him. He had considered this version of events in one form or another since he had seen the broadcast on the evening news. At the time, Draco had dismissed it as the mind trying to come to grips with the senselessness of death. And even when the study had been ransacked, Draco had tried to reject the idea. He thought of his mother, her face lit in laughter.
Hedwig, he thought, are you sure that this is correct?
“I don’t know what your game here is, but if you’re trying to divide us, it isn’t going to work,” Draco said. His shoulders ached from the contact with the hard surface. “And your dropping these cryptic hints won’t make me want to help you any more than when you asked earlier.”
Hedwig – Hedwig!
Potter’s frown deepened. “Are they giving you a difficult time? Tell Hermione; she’ll sort them out. And do you know why you were attacked? Was it because you were a Dea – your past?”
I was a former Death Eater. My actions had led to deaths and life-changing injuries. And yet, standing here with Harry, in front of a memorial to victims of the violence I had willingly, if unknowingly, participated in, I felt only peace. Guilt, yes, and shame, but none of the gut-wrenching sensations that I usually sought to turn away from. Only a grim determination to ensure that I never make those same mistakes again.
She tapped the men who displayed their lack of self-control during the meeting. “Come along,” she said. “There’s something I want to show you boys.”
“Maybe.” Harry’s voice was teasing now. “You know how much I like to give you a hard time.”
“I was trying to file an incidence report with the Aurors,” I admitted. “But they told me no one was available to see me and I had to make an appointment.”
No, it was unlikely. She probably disliked me because of my history, not purposely obstructing me from seeking help.
A loud explosion cut off Draco’s embarrassed explanation. An explosion followed by machine gun fire.
Our -- whatever involvement we found ourself in – had progressed rapidly, now that we – or mostly me – had stopped denying our attraction. It certainly passed the time quickly. The wonders he worked with his mouth was reason enough to start an affair with him, if such a tawdry word could describe what we had.
As before, I tapped my wand to my fingertip. A cut opened, and a droplet of blood welled. By instinct, I lifted my finger, presenting it to the stone chamber. As I watched, the white glow changed to that unearthly green I had come to associate with the Grimoire. It was strange, how I used to be so fond of it as my House colors, I thought.
“I am most definitely not spending years in this damn hospital bed, Harry. In fact, I have a guest lecture next week at King’s College on the use of curses in notable assassinations.” I had thrown myself into my work, attempting to channel the restlessness I felt into productivity. I scowled at him. “I’m definitely leaving before then.”
First: that vision – it told me more than I expected. A codex – it was absolutely a codex, judging by its aged appearance – with a green cover inscribed with an ouroboros. It must be a manuscript of some sort, one that I had come across in my studies. I made a mental note to visit the British Library, Magical Section, tomorrow to check the catalogues. There might be a clue there, if not the actual codex itself.
Thankfully, Granger spoke before I could respond to the Weasley. “It’s going to take years, if not decades, to completely uproot the Circle. I doubt we could even do it. They’ve also links to other groups internationally that we can’t reach. Even if we stop this one, others will take its place.”
That was why Draco was here without Harry by his side. Harry would growl and snap like a pit bull at the man until the poor man pissed his pants. Fletcher was sly, yes, but he also seemed to Draco rather easily scared. It explained the caution.
“Be careful,” Luna said. “Sometimes, the stories are real.”
Harry held himself from comments. He had an unpleasant premonition about where Malfoy’s story was headed.
Taking a deep breath, Draco poked his head into the door.
Finnegan winced. “Better you than me that report to him. Or face the press.”
I nodded, readying my grip on my wand. I looked at Potter. His eyes shone, his entire face alive with excitement and exertion.
It didn’t matter; Riddle pressed the etchings in quick succession.
I was out of places to run. I knew, as surely as the sun would set, that my past would be there wherever I looked from. Both the good and the bad, the memories I cherished and the moments I dreaded. They were interwoven, both taking up part of me.
“I’ll give you two some privacy,” he said. “Mr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy.”
“Draco!” Harry’s voice cut through, loud and panicked. “Are you alright? Can you hear me?”
“I have a list of shell companies that Riddle uses,” Harry said. “We can see if one of them is listed on the tenants here. And there are still people working. Look, you can even see the lights still on in some of the windows.”
Experts speculated that it was a tool to calculate astronomical movements. Detailed imaging showed it had 37 gear wheels to track the movements of the moon and sun through the zodiac, predicting eclipses and even modeling the moon’s orbit. According to Rosier, the Antikythera Mechanism was only a modified copy of an earlier object.
I sighed, allowing Harry to take the lead. I could smell the mildew and decay, as well as the sharp scent of sap. It was eerily quiet, with not even leaves rustling or animals scurrying to break it up. In fact, the entire place felt as though it was suspended in limbo.
“Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy are fine,” Granger said. “Mr. Malfoy suffered extensive smoke inhalation and magical damage, but he’ll live. Mrs. Malfoy is with him at St. Mungo’s right now.”
I glanced at my father. His face was impassive, and his entire body remained unmoving. I knew if he sided Cross, then Potter and I would be at a disadvantage. As Master of Malfoy Manner, my father could command the house itself to help him – and Cross.
The sun seemed to shine even brighter when I emerged aboveground. It filled me with a sense of wonder. Though not as crowded as Muggle London, Diagon Alley bustled with wizards and witches, rivaling the activity of the nearby Covent Garden. It had grown in the ten years following the War. With little room for sprawl, shops instead sprouted upwards, the buildings pressed against each other and leaning over the cobblestone streets. In my more whimsical moments, I always imagined that one day the Building Charms would fail, and they all come crashing down.
“This isn’t just an ordinary artifact,” Draco said. His hands tightened on the Shield. As he did so, the glow faded, and the changes Draco had seen became undone, the scenes returning to what it was previously.
I shot a jet of red light directly at Cross. It caught midair before dissipating into nothingness.
Finally, we turned back. My shoes crunched as we walked along the street. It was a small town, and most of the residents were asleep. There were the odd house here or there with lights coming out the windows. Some, when we passed underneath, were accompanied by the muffled sounds of the television.
Nonetheless, her words made me eye everyone who came too close to me warily. I recalled how the librarian acted, his behavior, the hostile menace that edged his questions.
“If you hurt him in any way, then the deal is off,” Draco said. “I’ll smash this right before your eyes.” He raised the Decoder high.
“Back to Grimmauld Place?” Draco murmured. The crowd surged past them, pushing Draco literally into Harry’s arms.
“What are you looking for?” Draco demanded, ignoring the other implication of the man’s statement. His curiosity overwhelmingly overrode any possible fear he might have had at being kidnapped by two criminals.
“No, it’s fascinating to hear an expert on this,” Harry said. When Malfoy was speaking earlier, the cold contempt had vanished from his face, and the animated enthusiasm made Malfoy appear much more approachable, even as he was expounding on a topic that Harry could barely follow.
“I don’t expect we’ll be able to until we have the Grimoire,” I said. “Maybe not even then.”
Harry didn’t use it much. It had been his godfather’s, like most of the furnishings in this place, and Harry had never bothered to replace or throw most of them out. Harry had Hedwig, whose speed and connectivity to the Web made it more than an adequate replacement for any civilian console. And if Harry needed to do anything more involved than scroll through the day’s headlines, he always had the Auror computers.
“We’ll figure it out when we get there, then,” Harry declared. “There’s another way around protection spells. We’ll have to outwit it. Most magically powerful wizards lack creativity and intelligence to think of workarounds.”
Harry winced. Shacklebolt, the Head of the Auror Force and Harry’s immediate superior, disliked publicity of any sort. Fitting, for a national security agency that operated mostly in the shadows. That meant Harry was about to receive a lecture when he returned to the office.
“I could do with a nightcap at your place,” he said. “There’s a bottle of that Macallan I’ve been eyeing for a while now.”
“Maybe a tie,” I said. “I’ll see what extras I have.”
“No, go ahead.” Harry smelled the faint citrus of Malfoy’s aftershave. He shifted closer. Malfoy was cold.
“That’s not why I came today, actually,” Granger said. “We’ve been keeping track of Ted Cross’ movements and we think we found one of his hideouts.”
“Hurry,” Harry hissed. “Help me hide these two.”
They parked their car and got out on the landing strip of the hover quay. The building’s manager met them with a pinched, worried face.
Potter gave a strained chuckle. “Among other things.” He stopped at a door on the first floor, kicking it open with his feet. It was a spacious bedroom with a large four-poster bed, the wood of the frame worn and streaked with grime. He deposited me on it. Despite its rather insalubrious appearance, the sheets and mattress were new, the sheets soft and clean, the mattress springs firm and solid.
“Ready?” Potter came down in a dark, workmanlike robe. He offered his hand out to me in a manner more befitting a gentleman escorting a deb into the ballroom.
I held back from reminding him that he never liked Astoria when we were engaged. “Aunt Andromeda’s family, father. Aren’t you always the one telling me to spend more time with family? Besides, mother is coming, too. We’re having tea in the Belgravia townhouse.”
“Think about it,” Cross said. “You know it’s true.”
“Why can’t Slytherin hide his damn book in somewhere far more accessible?” Harry did not seem possessed with the same kind of anxiety that plagued me. He was more irritable, rather. Already, he had tripped twice on misplaced branches. “The church, for instance, with that nice road leading up to it. Or even the graveyard.”
Of the facts, I had much less. He was married to Ginerva Weasley, was – had been -- a rising star in the Auror force, and was deliciously attractive. He also did not care much for me. The few times we interacted since Hogwarts were polite but cold. Irritatingly, he had spent more time talking with my mother than he did with me.
“We’re here investigating this wand,” Malfoy said. He took out his palmtop, displayed it. “Do you recognize it?”
“You’re the expert here. You tell me.” Draco heard Harry’s smile even in the dark.
“Was famously in love with jewelry of all sorts and had in fact murdered several of her employers to steal their jewelry collection,” I finished for her. “I know.”
“You can drive, right?” Draco asked, finally unleashing an enormous yawn. They emerged from the exit, seeing the pavement warm up with the sun’s rays.
And here I was, the interloper.
Opening to the first page, I squinted at the words, trying to make sense of it. It was painful and difficult – my eyes refused to focus no matter how hard I tried. Forcing myself to stare at it gave me vertigo.
“You should have called ahead if you didn’t want to wait,” Malfoy said coldly.
They both jerked in surprise.
“No, but you’re not the typical patron,” Harry said. “Don’t try lying – I can tell by the way Blaise listened to you and” – Harry gestured around the box – “all this, that you’re much more than even a regular.”
Harry answered in the affirmative. That was the conclusion he and Hedwig had come up with.
Malfoy only lifted an eyebrow.
I walked into the kitchen – and stilled.
“You don’t seem like a pompous fool, Commander Potter,” Malfoy interrupted. “So don’t act like one. I know how to keep a secret. Shouldn’t you be the one worried that you’re sharing information outside the Department of Mysteries to a civilian?”
And suddenly we returned to the Gringotts Reading Room. My arms fell to the table with a loud bang as the librarian stumbled, hitting a shelf. Books dropped to the floor, echoing in the high-vaulted space.
“Oh.” I drew back quickly. “Sorry.”
But the clues fitted: the meeting Lucius had that night he and Draco had their argument, how Mr. Weasley was genuinely surprised Draco didn’t know. Mr. Weasley, despite his relatively mediocre position, was well-placed – and more importantly, well-liked. It wasn’t inconceivable that he had heard something regarding Lucius Malfoy’s malfeasance.
“The Malfoys are older than the Blacks,” I said, raising my chin slightly, “and our family is larger. If we used a tapestry, it would take up at least two walls. And besides, tapestries breed moths and doxies.”
But my Occlumency was equal to it, even as I was locked into place, somehow frozen and unable to move. The mental pressure increased, like hot fingers pressing on my skull.
“I haven’t been back here in a while,” Harry said. We sat side by side, our legs touching, on the embankments, not far from where we had watched Slytherin give his last directive before leaving the school.
But that didn’t come as a surprise. Harry Potter, the golden boy, the football hero who had led Hogwarts into their first victory against Eton in five years.
Damn. He was an idiot. How could he have lost his temper like that back there? Harry might still need to return to the Leaky for follow-up investigations. Now, it was likely that he wouldn’t be able to set foot in there again.
Draco couldn’t promise that, but he did press a wad of cash on Theo as apology and to pay for the damage to the boat. And for saving their arses. He was fairly certain that Theo’s ownership of the gun did not exactly fit the requirements of the law, but he couldn’t be bothered to care.
Potters, on other hand, apparently did. He leaned in to kiss the tip of my nose. It was far too tame, especially by our standards.
“What?” Harry wished Malfoy would look at him. “What are you saying?”
When he opened it again, he was in a room just like the flat. Harry knew this was an optical trick of the brain-chip. It processed data in a way to allow Harry to make sense of it. It was a good facsimile, the only difference being that the hue was much brighter and there were no windows.
“Any progress?” Harry appeared in the doorway. Draco rubbed his eyes. Harry was dressed in a toned-down suit that still accentuated the width of his shoulders and the narrowness of his hips. He looked … good.
Harry watched Malfoy close his eyes, occasionally making little nods and tiny expressions – brows furrowing slightly, mouth puckering in a moue -- before he blinked and stared at Harry.
“We kept it discreet,” Granger said. “He doesn’t want the spotlight and we — well, we needed to keep morale up.”
“He’s scum,” Harry said, with a glare at Fletcher.
“Why? We’re on vacation.” Draco pouted. “What’s the point of having free time if we can’t enjoy?”
“Wait.” Draco stopped moving. Riddle paused from opening the display.
Malfoy rubbed his eyes. “Where should I begin?”
An angry blotch spread across Dolohov’s face. Bellatrix’s demeanor, however, discouraged defiance. He scowled and gave Draco a look of the deepest malevolence.
Without hesitation, Harry lunged at Draco, pulling him down behind the Humvee, the armored frame shaking from the thud of the bullets.
“Fuck.” I jerked at the movement, my hips moving in tandem with Harry’s hand. “Stop teasing.”
This hiding was soul draining. Not least because Harry had to admit he did want someone to hold at night. He did want to return to this flat with a partner waiting for him to share the comings and goings of his day, and for Harry to listen and jibe with, in turn.
Draco wasn’t sure why, but he was irritated by the alacrity with which Harry left. There wasn’t anything wrong with a couple’s reading; Draco would be actually curious to find out where their relationship would go in the next few weeks. After all, Draco was due to begin his new job as a staff archaeologist with the British Museum, following what his superior termed ‘Malfoy’s bloody-minded focus on the work” displayed with his future colleagues when he was with them in Iraq.
“Do you think they’re connected with this current case?”
A mess of emotions whirled within me…. Hearing what the librarian and his Master, whoever that may be, talk about me drew me back to when the Dark Lord occupied the Manor…. The sneers and the pointed remarks at my weakness, my failure, still haunted me.… And the fear that I was being led into a trap, that they knew enough about my weaknesses to use me, it struck my heart with ice….
“That’s the thing, sir. We tried radioing him first, but he didn’t respond, so we assumed it hasn’t been activated yet and he was still on the base. But –”
Bellatrix snorted. “More likely that he’s drunk with two cheap girls on his arm. There’s no point in waiting for him here then. From what I know of him, he would be occupied until the afternoon tomorrow. Perhaps I should pay him a visit to remind him of the benefits of punctuality.”
Draco scowled at Harry. “Awful. Cold and boring as all hell. But we did get what we needed. Think they’ll lead us to Riddle?”
“Thanks,” Potter said. His hand caught mine as I reached over to adjust the collar. It was hot and callused against my own. His thumb traced over the crook of my hand. “I can do it.”
“It’s nice to see you again, Harry,” Hermione said. “And your friend. Mr. Malfoy, isn’t it?”
He came with a splash of liquid heat. Draco exhaled deeply, trying to catch his breath. It had been a while. An eternity rather. Draco was on the verge of thinking his libido had died out altogether, withered like the orchid Pansy had gifted him last month.
Malfoy’s skin was silky under Harry’s touch. There was the supple flex of muscle that was pleasant, and Harry, on a whim, scratched lightly with his nails.
“Come here.” Draco’s voice came out in a rasp. “You can’t tie a tie to save your life. I’ll do it.”
Luna nodded, pleased. “Maybe I should recommend you to a fellowship in the Occult Studies. We’ve recently began one, and you seem like you have a mind for these sorts of inquiries.”
Pulling up, Harry lifted out of the grid, over the hoods of the cars.
The Dark Lord’s eyes went wide. The man continued: ‘In exchange, we can help with your … experiments. I believe you wish to experiment with the magical properties of the number seven.’ He produced a scroll of parchment so old and yellowed, it was flaking onto the carpet. ‘Here are some ideas.’
Harry’s callused hands kneaded my shoulders, my thighs. He took me into his mouth. My fingers twisted into the sheets, jerking as waves of pleasure rippled through me. I strained, pumping; Harry grazed his teeth against the skin.
Goyle gave a little grin. “Now you see why people like to come done here, don’t you, Commander Potter? Compared to this, do you think any of the staid places you call bars could compare?”
“He can stay with me,” Harry said suddenly.
And waited.
“That sounded more like a bomb than any I’ve ever came across in the field,” Harry said lightly. Despite the tone of levity, Draco thought he saw a cloud flit across Harry’s face.
I did. And keeping my distance to Potter obviously was an ineffective tactic. Potter was right: we couldn’t go on denying our attraction to each other. And his other point, that we weren’t making any commitment to each other, both stung and appealed to me. Sleeping with Potter did not preclude my new resolution to be a better Malfoy heir. And I so sorely wanted to.
I was panting already. I wondered if I had an opportunity to call for reinforcements — the last time I was confronted with him, I only managed to escape by grace of having Muggles nearby. With the din loud enough to wake the dead, maybe my neighbors would summon help.
“They are quite beautiful to look at, aren’t they?” Riddle asked, emerging from the shadows. “The ancients were quite skilled at creating works of art.”
Bet she caught an eyeful, I thought, shooting a quick glance at Potter. I could still see the swell in joggers where he was still semi-erect, and it was my turn to hide a smile.
“I’m happy,” Draco said finally. “There’s no reason not to be. It would be the height of ingratitude to be discontent with my lot right now.”
“Well, it’s my treat this round.” When Draco started to object, Harry interrupted him. “I insist. Besides, I’m planning to expense this meal.”
If they were under any sort of strain, they showed no signs of it. Grim-set and serious, these were professionals used to dealing with hardened criminals and the darkest of wizards. Some of them looked askance when Granger introduced me but were too well-trained to question her.
Harry remembered Riddle all too well. Tom Riddle, once one of their best and brightest, the youngest ever Auror Head. Riddle had launched an uprising seven years ago, intent on seizing power for himself. It was at the final siege of the Tower of London, when Harry had only been a junior officer with the Aurors, that he had been injured. He touched the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, the only outward remnants of the battle.
It was nothing remarkable. The book was ordinary, and would not have looked out of place on any bookshelf. It was a slim plain hardback that had lost its cover, and like most, looked naked without it.
“I’m the Savior,” he winked at me. At my glare, he kissed me gently, his hand cupping my face. “Besides, I’m dying to have to you all to myself. The wounded soldier and the nurse fantasy has always been a favorite of mine.” His thumb traced circles on my cheek.
He tapped his finger. Instantly, a man entered the room.
“Maybe you haven’t been paying attention when they update them,” Harry suggested. “You said yourself that you haven’t paid much attention in recent days.”
“That’s true,” Draco said. “Electrum coins were used by the Greeks, and there have been traces of platinum found in electrum.” He looked at the Decoder. “That’s very impressive, not to mention expensive, but I suppose it would make sense that an object made for Alexander the Great would use finer material than your everyday metalworks.”
“Or we could talk about what happened.”
“Yes,” Draco said. “And now do you see why I came to you? I can’t match the acquisition budget of museums; my spending doesn’t come with charitable tax breaks. I need a source that’s relatively low key compared to the usual means of buying these items.”
Draco read on:
His offer was more than out of desire to save himself and Harry. Draco wanted more time to study the Shield. It was ludicrous, but it called to him. If Draco closed his eyes, vivid impressions of thundering hooves, of towering columns of dust, pressed themselves like hot fingers against his lids.
“It allows the caster to share his life force to someone else,” Granger answered. “You use blood as a catalyst and it saves and restores the target from an otherwise fatal condition, but at the expense of the caster’s health.” She frowned at me. “It’s a Class A Regulated Spell. You shouldn’t be using it.”
“Mother seems to like you,” I spoke after a while. I became aware of our proximity. We were touching, our thighs grazing. I had a ridiculous urge to rest my head on his shoulder.
The Decoder, too, had stopped ticking. It was light in Draco’s hands compared with the Shield. The energy that had kept the gears moving had ceased, and it was back to being a complicated piece of machinery.
“That’s alright,” Finnegan said quickly. “I can handle a few forms.” He beat a hasty retreat to his own broom.
My father pulled me down just as another jet of light came. It was in the nick of time, as Cross’s hex hit the velvet curtains. They shredded with a loud tear. Then the next spell caught my father squarely in the chest.
“I suppose you count yourself as one of these?”
I opened my eyes.
“Why?” Greyback asked, stung. “What’s so special about the son of a traitor?” He raked his eyes over Draco. The gaze was like ants crawling across his skin.
Despite my unsettled state of mind, I managed to finish most of my work. It was strangely meditative, the soft press of my quill against the parchment as I detailed the effects of Druidic magic on their enemies. It made for the perfect distraction, their methods of spell works being so different from our own.
“I think you know more than you might be aware of,” Shacklebolt said, not ungently. His eyes were sympathetic, and that grated almost as much. “We’ve been monitoring this group’s communications and we’ve managed to decrypt a certain segment of it. Has your father mentioned anything about a ‘Shield of Achilles’?”
“I was going to say have endure hardships that tempered the arrogance,” Cross said, with disapproval at my interruption. “Not to mention, you’re talented and intelligent.”
“I’m your field liaison,” Harry said. His lips curved. “Welcome to Afghanistan, Draco.”
Mercifully, the sounds paused. Greyback turned from a bloodied Harry to Draco.
I stumbled out of my fireplace, feeling a sense of déjà vu. I needed to stop coming home drunk.
Draco rolled his eyes.  He wasn’t sure if he liked overprotective Harry better than morose Harry. “I took a calculated risk, alright? I guessed that nothing would have happened to me in the middle of one of the busiest districts in London near some of the most secure sites in the world.”
“What?”
“It’s a deal.”
The Weasley eyed Potter curiously as he took everything in. “Why are you hanging out with the ferret  -- Malfoy, Harry? I’m so confused right now.”
“Sir.” Finnegan came up, saving Harry from the need to make a reply. “We’ve taken the two back to HQ. The car’s impounded, too. Roughly 11,000 galleons of Elixir we found too.”
“Thanks for that ringing endorsement of my trustworthiness,” I said sardonically. I tempered the edge with a chuckle. “Well, then I guess I did come to the right person, if you’ve experience in these matters.” He seemed surprisingly opened to the idea and I had to be grateful for that. Images of my destroyed flat, the sensation cut of gravel on my knee flashed through my mind, and I knew I needed his help.
“Here.” I took off my own robes and draped it over him; I wore a thin sweater underneath. It wasn’t much, but it was better than what Potter had on. He looked slightly ridiculous with two robes wrapped around him.
Harry did not engage in much introspection, but walked in, as blithely as I would into Harrods. I followed with considerably more caution.
He ran.
“Sir?” It was one of the housemaids. “You have a visitor.”
“You’re headed into a trap,” Draco shouted over the man. “They know you’re coming, and they’ve stationed lookouts the entire way. You need to get out of here at once!”
Potter shifted uncomfortably.
Harry pulled Draco back just in time to avoid being hit as it smashed against the wall.
“I itched to get out of the office every time. And the politics. Merlin, there was so much politics. Who stole the credit from who, who got to be placed on the special forces, who should have been commended to the Hit Wizards. And then there was the Ministry politics.” Potter shook his head. “I was dragged out so often to the meetings to remind every other department that the Aurors had the ‘golden boy’ and deserved a larger share of the budget.”
“I think it could be,” he said slowly. “Why else would all these people want it? I wouldn’t have come out here for a bedtime story. At the very least, there is something that these people want. It might not have the fabled powers that’s attributed to it, but it’s rooted enough in the real world that people are willing to pay good money for it.”
“I think I understand a little why you got into this field in the first place,” Harry told Draco. “It’s thrilling, like a treasure hunt straight from a movie.”
“I was two years behind you, Mr. Malfoy,” he said, not exactly hostile, but not warming up to me. I was nonplused. I could not have lost that much of my appeal, have I?
I ducked. They hit the chair behind me, an eerie howl sounding as the chair blackened into ash.
As far as Harry was aware, Fudge had less interest in Harry’s well-being than the perception that they were friendly. It helped Fudge’s political standing to surround himself with recipients of the Order of the Imperator Britannia.
“It is,” Harry said. “You’d be good at it. And you can’t tell me you didn’t enjoy the search for the Grimoire.”
“Should we have him removed?” Bellatrix asked. “It’s likely now he’s under Secret Service protection, so he might be less accessible than before, but it’s nothing our agents can’t handle.”
“So what did happen?” Harry asked. “That scar, your familiarity with the drug …. I promise I’m only listening as a friend. Not as – well, I’m listening as a friend.”
“Yes, master,” Wormtail said. “We have been most careful in the details we choose to reveal to the experts we contact. It is a pity that Rosier had to go, master. He had the necessary expertise that would have been useful –”
I sighed. “You tied it wrong. What the hell kind of knot is that?”
Malfoy’s playfulness faded. “No.” He shook his head. “A promise is a promise. And it’s been running in my head all these years. I need to do this.” He moved onto the bed. “You mind if I sit here?”
I chuckled. “I didn’t know you were into this, Potter. I kind of enjoy this side of you.”
“I should be grateful I’m not magically powerful, then,” I remarked dryly. “But I’ll take this as a compliment.”
In that instant, Harry jumped out of where he had been hunkering, running towards them. His feet sending her gun out of the room.
The lonely immensity of the place dwarfed him. Only one wing was occupied now; it wasn’t as if one person needed that much space.
Harry paused, considering. “Sounds like it might be fun,” he said. “And I’m never one to turn down free. I assume I have to wear a suit?”
“What are you thinking about?” Harry asked.
“I worry about you,” Harry said. “You’re so independent and you like to do things on your own that I don’t know how to help. And when I saw him touching you and talking to you like that, I just – I snapped.”
That sparked an idea. I could seek protection from the Aurors. After all, this was what our tax paid for. They were much better trained than I to apprehend someone who attacked me in broad daylight.
“We can,” Harry said. His face was set in grim lines. “From the direction of the fire, there doesn’t appear to be more than two or three men concentrated in one direction. And at the rate they’re firing, it’s likely they’ll run out of bullets soon. We still have our smoke and standard issue grenades. When they take a pause, we go in with those. First the standard issue, then the smoke. That’ll create the opening for us.” Harry gave Draco a stern look. “You are going to stay here. Behind this Humvee. If you move so much as an inch, I’ll—”
Harry swore. After all those hours spent waiting. This was frustrating – he knew that there would be a clue in these files.
There was the sound of a small pop as the house-elf appeared.
Granger tapped me on the shoulder, startling me out of my reverie. “Do you have any idea who the other man is? We have some records Gringotts provided us about the librarian, though I’m willing to bet most of the information is fake.”
“You’re the Auror, not me,” Malfoy said tartly. “However, if I were to venture a guess, I would say that this is. This type of wand is not something you can simply order and have it shipped to you. Well.” He shifted his head to one side and Harry took a moment to appreciate the way the sunlight hit Malfoy’s profile. “Perhaps it is, for certain members of society. But in any case, this is a concrete lead.”
Fletcher glanced at Draco. “What about my fee?”
Shacklebolt’s office was open. Harry walked in to see his superior immersed in a halo of holo-reports. Only his head moved slightly, bobbing one way, then another.
“That’s a good idea,” Potter said, “but you sure you’re ready to go back? I can go and you can stay here.”
They exited into a hallway rather like previous one. It was clean, almost antiseptically so, with bare walls and smooth, marblelike tiles. There was an empty foyer with a few chairs in the same modern style that had been present in the furniture at the lobby, but nothing else.
Cross laughed. “Ah, Mr. Potter, still playing Auror? How comical, coming from a man who was reprimanded for someone who continuously put his squad’s safety at risk through reckless endangerment.”
Where was he? Last Harry remembered was that he was in the Underground, on his knees from this excruciating sound that almost tore him apart. Now he was in what appeared to be a luxuriously appointed bedroom. He moved his toes and fingers experimentally. They responded.
Malfoy coughed delicately.
“Is that the case with you?” Draco asked. Do you appreciate me, after leaving me for the deserts and the bombs?
“I don’t either.” The implication stung. “But sometimes a kiss is just a kiss.”
“Seeing each other,” Potter clarified rather lamely.
“You … drugged me with that?” he croaked. “Malfoy ….”
Riddle shook his head. “I think you’re stalling, Mr. Malfoy. You don’t want me to get angry, do you? Mr. Potter here is a very fragile.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Well, I can look through the Auror database to see if there’s a match among the manufacturers –”
Draco suppressed the remark he had at the thought of going to the Burrow for dinner. Who named their home ‘the Burrow’? But even though Draco had not promised Harry to be nice, maybe he should try being more conciliatory with the Weasleys. If anything, it might bring him some karmic relief.
“You were hit by a Cruciatus,” Malfoy said. “It’s a good thing that I came looking for you.” He hesitated. “What the hell were you thinking, provoking those people in the bar like that?”
“I wanted to be an explorer when I was young,” I said. “Too many books, and much too vivid an imagination. I used to run around the gardens here pretending I was the hero slaying the monstrous Gryffindor griffin.”
I sniffed. “I would do nothing so plebian. Besides, owl droppings might get in my food.”
“You don’t know anything either?” That was odd. Aurors weren’t called in for the average crime, and Harry was considered too high-ranked now to be used on cases which either required his experience and skillset, or needed someone with enough profile to reassure the masses.
“I can understand about your families not approving.” Rosa gave a commiserating nod. “My parents weren’t exactly happy when I introduced them to my partner.”
There – again! The words slipped out of focus for a second before resetting into their tiny serif font. For a moment, I imagined that it had slipped into the curling loops of handwritten letters.
“The Leaky Cauldron,” Goyle said. “A bar and brothel and meeting spot for all sorts of villainy and debauchery that you can find in the Underground. They cater to every taste imaginable.” Harry thought he saw the gleam of Goyle’s yellowed teeth. “Who knows? Maybe you’ll like it there too, Commander Potter.”
“What’s wrong?”
Malfoy tapped his wand. “Metis, what can you find?”
“That’s right,” Fletcher said. “Which reminds me: my fee isn’t cheap.”
I spent an exhausting afternoon convincing Gringotts security not to ban me for life. I had exhausted all my currency with them but the most important one – that of our continued family patronage. Thankfully, being one of the oldest and largest clients of the bank still had weight with the senior management. And in the middle of their interrogation, a delegation from the Ministry led by Granger herself showed up. She had pulled aside the Head Goblin, conferring with him with such hissed vehemence that I had mistaken it for a burst pipe at first.
Draco would have rolled his eyes, even in the current circumstance, but he had the feeling that his minions might not appreciate that.
“Right, sir. Well, the thing is, is that these seem more numerous than usual, and have been making suspicious movements, such as clearing ahead of the route Commander Potter and his men are planned to use. It’s almost as if –”
It was Potter.
“No. It came from behind. I’m driving in the middle of the city, so hopefully they won’t try anything reckless and try to shoot again.”
Potter came over. He yawned and stretched his arms. I looked away quickly as his movement exposed a stretch of tawny abdomen. “Time for lunch?”
“Oh.” It was already lunchtime. “Yes. Thank you.”
But Dolohov’s attention wasn’t on the duo. Even from a distance, Draco guessed that Dolohov was coming in for the Decoder, which had slipped closer to the water’s edge now.
“Good.” I was exhausted and the swirl of emotions left me wanting a bottle of whiskey to numb myself. But speaking to Granger and the Weasley and mapping out a course of action cleared centered me. I knew what I needed to do. “I think I’m ready for bed now.”
“Yes, imagine that,” Harry said dryly.
“That’s a Ministry access card,” Finnegan said. “It allows access to the Ministry network on the Web from any console, including ones made for civilian use.”
Harry glowered and they continued bantering until the bill came.
The least Draco could do now was take care of it.
Potter laughed. “That’s the Malfoy I know and love.” We both flushed at that word.
“He’s no doubt on the run by now, but we’ll find him,” Granger said. “There are evidence that he’s been involved in the looting of several magical archaeological sites. We’ll have the Museum watched, as well as his regular haunts and his house at Hampstead Heath.” She considered. “I don’t think there is any other ones. Pensieves are rare magical artefacts and even the Ministry doesn’t have one. I think the best bet is the one at Hogwarts.”
“What do you want from me so that you’ll stop hurting Harry?” Draco asked, tamping down his revulsion.
I couldn’t stop as we continued to kiss, my hand reaching out to pull him in closer. He weighed comfortably on top of me, one leg on mine, as our arms intertwined.
“Would you listen to me if I told you that?” countered Draco. “Besides, I never listened to you when you tell me to stay out of things.”
Draco gazed at the Shield in his hand. It was heavy, too much for his grip, and his wrist bent at an unnatural angle trying to hold on. It was special — Draco felt it in his bones. Though the Shield did not change again, it seemed to vibrate in his hands, and it was like resting on top of a ca hood with the engine pulsing under.
“Yes,” Harry said. “I think I understand why we were called in now. Imagine how it would look if a Ministry official was found dead of an Elixir overdose, as it does with what happened here. The press would riot in celebration. After all that talk from Fudge on cracking down, here is one of his men dead from using the very substances Fudge is trying to ban.”
Last night was a dream a long time coming. Desire had always tinged my loathing of Potter. And this new Potter I was coming to know was considerate and collected, with a wicked sense of humor. And he was so damn attractive with his messy dark hair and his sharp eyes, not to mention how built he was.
No. Stop. This was what Cross intended. To confuse me. To tempt me. The librarian attacking me showed that the Circle was untrustworthy, even if Cross himself was a man of his word. And I would not trust Cross with a piece of discarded rag, much less a matter on this magnitude.
None came. My father looked at me. “I don’t deny I still think the pureblood families know best and are best equipped to lead wizarding society, but it’s clear that the world isn’t ready. And,” he looked at Potter, “sometimes people with the most unexpected origins can surprise us.”
“What’s going on?” Weasley’s head popped out. “Harry? Malfoy? What the hell? And why are you all red?”
I scowled at Potter as I picked myself up from the floor for the fifth time. “You don’t have to aim at the same place all the time, you know.” I rubbed the sore spot on my chest. “It’s going to bruise.”
Fletcher remained impressively opaque. He had managed to deflect question after question in a manner worthy of the best government spokesperson. Business was fine, he could be selective with his clientele. And Mr. Malfoy would understand better the market for antiquities, wouldn’t he, given where he worked?
I stumbled back, crashing into the table. The tea set fell to the floor, the pots and cups shattering with a wave of hot liquid, scalding my skin.
“Draco,” Harry hissed.
“You can’t carry on like this, Draco!” my father raged. “It’s one thing if you keep your predilections discreet. Merlin knows there are Malfoys and Blacks of your sort, but they’ve never had smut of them spread out in the papers!”
“I can take care of him,” Harry said out of the blue.
What I needed was a cold shower and a hard fap when I get home. And a good cup of coffee. Maybe tonight I’ll call Blaise again. That itch needed scratching. Again.
I blushed, rearranging my robes to look less conspicuous. Next to me, Harry tried to flatten his hair for the umpteenth time – not that anything short of a nuclear blast could flatten it – and rubbed at an angry red mark on his neck.
The Weasley laughed at my expression. “You look so distraught. Don’t worry; they can’t hurt you anymore.”
It wasn’t exactly the reaction Harry had hoped for.
The true entrance to HQ was behind Padma, through an archway that looked simple to the naked eye. That wasn’t the case; sophisticated SIs monitored every inch of the hall and beyond, capturing every bit of information from heartrate to body heat. Anything that would give the security systems cause for alarm would result in a shutdown of the entire building and activate the deadly laser defenses that would incinerate an intruder.
“They’re all very well. Not many of them know I’m back. Part of the secrecy and element of surprise, you understand. Hermione and Ron know, but none of the other Weasleys do.” Harry speared a prawn. “She asked about you. Hermione.”
“I need to ask another favor of you.”
“What is this ‘Shield of Achilles’ then?”
What are you doing, Draco mouthed.
He greeted Draco with open arms.
“Oh, don’t worry, guv. I’m not gonna blab – they hate you lot down there. If anyone found out that I’ve been working with you, I’m good as dead. Speaking of -- you really should put out your wand.”
Harry finally recovered his wits. “What the hell are you doing here?”
“I was having a drink with Granger,” I said waspishly. I glared at his fuzzy outline, shaded against the harsh kitchen lights.
“Here.” He tossed them at Draco. “You can change at the bathroom down the hall. I expect these back pressed and laundered.”
“Small Room?” Potter looked at me.
No. My hands stopped on the hemline of my shirt. I looked at myself in the mirror. My face seemed longer and thinner, and I was a startling white in the murky lighting. And even in my state, I had all the physical traits of my Malfoy antecedents: the blond hair, the sharp chin, the slate-grey eyes. And though it was also a Malfoy trait to make poor decisions, I knew falling for Potter was one I needed to avoid.
“Malfoy, don’t touch it!” Potter slid in swiftly to shield me as my finger touched the blade –
The lamps threw soft orange warmth over the pavements, and there were still pedestrians bustling around. It wasn’t that late or empty but walking along with Harry seemed like its own little world.
Harry reappeared by my side and handed me my espresso martini. He himself was drinking his typical beer. “Cheers, Hermione. What are you talking about?”
I did roll my eyes this time. “Accio!” Still nothing.
She scurried off. As soon as she was out of eyesight, I whipped out my wand and casted a quick healing spell that staunched the bleeding and healed the fracture in skull. He still needed medical attention, but at least he was no longer in any imminent danger.
Harry burst into action. During Draco’s negotiation with them, he managed to slip his gun out of the holster. He aimed it at the gas tank of Bellatrix’s water sled.
My father would likely look down his nose at whatever swill Potter was bringing. The Malfoy wine cellars were as old as the house itself. I didn’t mention this to Potter as I came out of my room.
There was a beat of silence while Malfoy watched Harry.
Potter did the same. We sat in silence; if Potter felt any sort of discomfort or awkwardness, he did not display it. He was remarkably at ease.
I barely managed to stop myself from toppling out of my seat. To say I did not expect that was an understatement.
“Or that’ll mean the end of your stay here, young man,” the commander said, regarding Draco sternly. “Understand?”
Potter coughed. They stopped with a guilty start.
“That wasn’t my proudest moment.” I really drank too much, if I were sitting here apologizing to Potter and having a heart-to-heart. “But you? No friends? The Chosen Savior? I don’t believe that.”
Then Fletcher laughed. “I suppose that’s reasonable. I can’t fault you for trying.”
“Any ideas how to get past it?” Harry held his wand out cautiously. “I don’t think we can overpower this.” The flames seemed to react to his words, hissing and spitting as constantly mutating forms of monsters formed from them.
She pursed her lips, looking remarkably like old McGonagall. “No, I suppose not. But when you ask, be gentle.”
“Which ones?”
Draco held up his hands. “Okay, sorry.”
I steadied myself on the bedframe. “Do you want some coffee?” I asked, my voice coming out harsh like my throat had been sandpapered over.
Draco didn’t like the sound of that. But he only said: “I do.”
I narrowed my eyes at him. “You can’t break me,” I said, with a bravado I did not feel. “You need someone sane to use the Grimoire for you. And let me tell you, I’m already a bit unhinged even without torture.”
I was not sure what left me more speechless, his foresight or his wand less magic. Anticipation was an aphrodisiac on its own; lust and want fired through my entire body as Harry’s finger toyed with my arse. A spasm hit me as a fingertip, nails bluntly cut, hit my prostate.  I hissed in pleasure.
“Oh…. Alright.” Draco wasn’t particularly enthused by the idea of walking so much, though he supposed it was better than taking the stairs all the way up.
No. I couldn’t.
“What these men had been up to while they were down here.” Harry showed Malfoy the photos of the deceased Unspeakables.
“Maybe. But Malfoy’s been the subject of their breathless coverage for years.” Finnegan frowned. “Although I haven’t seen anything on the Web about him in a long time, come to think of it.”
“Draco,” Harry choked out. Draco silenced it by kissing Harry.
“I would imagine any light would do,” Draco said. “I don’t think it would make a difference.”
Harry steadied my flailing body. His arms was a comforting presence.
We stopped before an obelisk carved with words. They began to move, and the obelisk changed into a sculpture of a family. The Potters.
I shrugged. “Not completely. I’ll have to corroborate them, of course. Imagine if I tried to cite them as sources. How would you go about citing magical visions anyways?”
“Well, given how badly these people want it, it’s probably not crated like everything else.” Draco combed through the information he had researched on the Shield. “Mycenaean shields – the period of the alleged Achilles – were usually bull-hide. However, smaller ones have been found made entirely of bronze. From the Iliad, it’s described as having five layers: two bronze, two tin, and one gold. So we’re looking for a round object from these composites. It’ll be very decorated.”
They had fallen into a silent understanding that revived most, if not all, of their past relationship. What they were in was beyond physical now, though Draco still braced himself for Harry to disappear any minute.
She gave a little hiccup. The look she gave me, though, was entirely too sharp for someone who was several drinks in. “It’s not my business to answer,” she said. “For both your questions.”
A loud bang and crash -- the wall cracked, hairline fissures widening, weblike, as the structure weakened. Large chunks of stone fell, and I jumped back to avoid my feet being crushed. A hole opened and men in the red of Auror robes jumped through.
“Hedwig will be done with the report of my experience by tomorrow morning and Finnegan should have another providing an overview of the entire case finished,” Harry said, in a concession. He just wanted to return home to his bed, or at least take a hot shower. “If you come by my desk tomorrow, I’ll give you a copy.”
A pale face stared back at me. It was a washed out, drawn caricature of me: my chin, already sharp in real life, pointed like the end of a dagger, my hair white in the sun. I ran one hand over, trying to coax it back into place.
“All of it!” My father’s face soften He said gruffly: “Look, Draco, I would love to see you happy. But as the Malfoy heir, you have duties and a role to play that’s far bigger than just yourself. You’ll have to face that fact eventually.”
The forest loomed before us, the trees stooped with age, their gnarled branches guarding the entrance. As we ducked under them, we were hit by a blast of cold air. My teeth clattered. Our eyes met with near pitch-black; sunlight did not penetrate this far into the leave’ thicket.
“Is that the list?” Harry asked.
“Well, I don’t. How many properties do you own, Draco?” Harry asked curiously.
“It’s not like I particularly court that kind of behavior,” Draco said. “I was about to give him a lesson when you burst in.”
Simultaneously, Harry lashed out, catching the guard with a sweep that sent the man crashing to the ground. At the same time, Harry pushed himself forward, contorting to grab a small knife that Draco hadn’t noticed was on the ground before. Keeping one foot firmly on the guard’s chest, Harry cut through his bonds.
“Is it that business with his father?”
Harry grinned at Draco. “What’s the matter, Malfoy? Scared?”
As my mind fumbled over the intricacies of druidic rituals, I spotted from the corner of my eye the librarian heading my way. He’s taken the bait, I thought.
It was bigger than I expected too, despite the clutter of books and miscellaneous objects in the cabinets and on his desk. There was a large Sneakoscope taking up half the space and a Foe Glass behind his chair.
“I thought you can break through anything,” Harry said snidely.
“I’m not made of glass,” I said with a brittle laugh. “I’ve survived much worse than this.” My hands twisted the folds of my robes in my lap. “Why aren’t you an Auror anymore?”
Dolohov froze, the instinct to pull the trigger warring with his orders to keep the Shield safe. Draco was impressed by how obedient Dolohov was to his directive.
To Harry’s pleasure, Malfoy didn’t make any smart comment, but neither did he look suitably appreciative. Malfoy’s brows furrowed in an unfathomable expression that Harry didn’t know what to make of.
“We’ll leave you in here, then,” Riddle said, cradling the Shield and Decoder as one would a child. They called to Draco, and for a second, Draco had an image of himself tackling and wrestling them away from Riddle.
As they ate, they kept the conversation on lighter topics: gossip in the antiquities world, rumors about different museums’ latest acquisitions. Draco wasn’t surprised to find that Fletcher had a deep knowledge of the gossip that this insular world produced.
I set my wand and cup down. Then I touched the book.
Draco was taken back to reality by a loud splash as the boat began moving.
“No,” Draco said. He sat down, the events of the entire day finally catching up. All he desired at the moment was a nice book and a cup of tea. “I interrupted them before they found what they were looking for. And before you ask: no, I don’t know what it is they are looking for either.” Draco eyed them. “But you would seem to have all the information here. So tell me, what is going on?”
You were being a bit of a prat, Hedwig said. That man clearly had a reason to hate the Ministry, and the Aurors are one of the most visible faces. And you had to respond with that bit about jurisdiction.
“Tonight,” Granger said. “He told me tonight.”
Instead, Shacklebolt took out a small polaroid. It was of the car that had fled the estate this afternoon; Draco recognized the grainy visage as the men self-identified as Dolohov and Wormtail.
“I’m telling you that you should give up,” Draco said, ignoring his racing heart, trying not to stare at Bellatrix’s gun. “I don’t want to see any one get hurt here.”
Or was it the same?
“It should be on now,” Finnegan said. He indicated the control panel. “Should I play it, sir?”
Under the jet of water pounding his back, Harry thought back to Malfoy and what Hedwig had said. “…interest in Draco Malfoy bordered on levels considered inappropriate….”
I rubbed my arms. What had happened seemed entirely out of place: both my reaction from touching the book and the librarian’s behavior. The Gringotts Reading Room was created in the aftermath of the War, like so many things, out of a spirit of magical cooperation. It was the reading room for the library to the Public Repository of Shared Magical Treasures in Gringotts Bank. Its catalogue was small, far eclipsed by the Hogwarts Library and the British Library, Magical Section; but Gringotts being the vault of choice for precious magical items, it quickly became popular for magical historians who lived in London and had niche areas of interests such as myself.
There was a knock as a house-elf laid out our lunch tray. He bowed, and, upon seeing Potter, gave an even deeper one at him, before vanishing.
Harry knew exactly what Draco was trying to say. He took Draco’s hands in his own. They were warm compared to Draco’s; roughened and callused, they had a strength in them that grounded Draco, anchoring him through the tempest of fear and hurt.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief as tires hit the dirt road. No one came after him or launched a rocket to stop him.
I breathed in the sharp city air as I strolled along Diagon Alley. I had decided to walk again. The weather was smiling, and I didn’t think I could handle the hurtling sensation of magical travel. Not with my hangover. Pity that the limits of magic included their cures. If someone discovered an antidote, it would be an instant Order of Merlin, not to mention a Chocolate Frog card.
“Everything you need is here, Draco,” Theo said. “The wetsuit, the oxygen tanks enough for two hours, two and a half max. Over to the starboard are driver propulsion vehicles.” They looked like small sleds, though with their electric propellers, perhaps a motorbike would be more accurate.
Draco stiffened in surprise. “What are you doing?” He sought to slip out the embrace.
There was an impression on the bed where Malfoy had been last night.
This was one point I had avoided discussing with Harry. I knew my father right; I would eventually need to find a way somehow to carry out my family responsibilities — meaning having the heir and spare. But I also couldn’t deny any longer how much I cared for him, how much I craved his company. And sex was magnificent.
Thankfully, they had the advantage of defending in a narrow passageway. Like Thermopylae, the constricted hall gave Harry and Draco a clear vantage point to plug the hole as it were, and push back the attackers.
While Harry sipped on his beverages, in an effort to fortify himself for the conversation ahead, Malfoy launched in.
The man made a little “oof” sound as he hit the wall. His lids fluttered and the whites of his eyes showed. He was out cold.
“Not when you explode the Head Auror’s desk.”
I raised my wand and said: “Homenum revelio.”
“If you’re willing, I also take payment in kind,” Fletcher said, dropping his voice low. He was uncomfortably close.
“No,” I said. “It wasn’t because of revenge. It was something I discovered.” I told him about how I discovered the book containing clues to Slytherin’s Grimoire. I also told him about what Luna said about the conspiracy, and how Granger had warned me against trusting the Aurors.
Potter looked as stunned as I was. Apparently, he hadn’t expected my father’s response either.
But it still smarted that Potter wanted nothing more than sex from me. It was only my wounded pride, I told myself. I sure as hell did not want to date him.
“Every man has his own foibles,” Harry said with a bitter smile. “Riddle’s is that he enjoys flaunting his power to his inferiors. And he considers everyone his inferiors.”
“He might actually be really busy,” Granger said, when Draco looked as though he was about to toss his phone out the car window. “Or his phone might have run out of batteries. There’s a million possibilities.”
He left, though not without giving us one final curious look.
“Alcohol is a drug already,” Harry pointed out. “Besides, who knows what kind of drugs they have down here? It might bypass my defenses.”
I closed my eyes, the effects of the alcohol combining with a nausea from reading the letter. Cross was alive. There was no shock; somehow, my intuition had warned me that it had all been wrapped up too neatly.
“Who are you?” I managed out the words. My eyes struggled to focus; the figure wore a dark cloak that concealed his face and his entire body. The only part exposed was the outstretched hand holding the wand. Skeletal and pale, with squat fingers, it reminded me of a piece of bone.
“You don’t know me as well as you think you do,” I said. One hand gripped my chest, trying in vain to squeeze out the pain. My wand pointed at his face. It shook, the tremors in my body affecting my ability to hold it steady. “I would be a fool to trust you.”
“Alright.” Harry slipped in.
I sat down, a little winded, but very much on an emotional high. Harry had gone off to refill his beer and was immediately accosted by one of his Gryffindor friends at the bar. Setting my glass down, I looked around.
I looked around. Though the librarian had returned to his desk, I had no doubt any flashier spells would draw him on me quicker than a shark with blood. And his reaction to seeing the book … I shivered. I should not examine the book here.
Draco almost collapsed in relief. He pulled himself up with difficulty – did he always weigh this much? a voice in the back of his head asked –and walked slowly towards them.
There was a clink from the kitchen. I peered. It was coming from the area hidden from view by the angle of the room. I hope it wasn’t china that I hadn’t stow away properly this morning.
This … what was Harry doing? About to sleep with a lead on a case, not to mention a potential witness, someone who had just confided in Harry a traumatic moment. Harry stopped, met Malfoy’s eyes.
“I think your food’s ready,” Potter said. There was a small hitch in his voice, and though his features were even, I could have sworn a faint blush crept underneath his tanned skin. “I think I’ll have some actually. Smells delicious.”
My mother had taken the revelation about me and Harry with aplomb. If it was even be a revelation to her – she had not seemed surprised when she called, a copy of the Prophet screaming the headline: “POTTER AND MALFOY – A UNION OF OPPOSITES?” in hand.
What was it that drew him to me? I wondered as I massaged the scalp. This house’s water pressure was slightly weak, and I stood under the faucet for a minute, water dripping into my eyes.
“Is that your usual routine? Dinner, followed by drinks and a night at a club?” Harry asked curiously. His tone suppressed an emotion Draco wasn’t sure he was able to identify properly.
“I can mimic their speech patterns and their accents,” Harry said. “After listening to a few of them talk. Hedwig – my SI – she can analyze and teach me. It won’t be perfect, but it’ll be passable.”
“Draco, I don’t know what’s going on, but you can’t just run into an operation like this. And is that a British Army Land Rover?”
There was a man sitting by the open door. He had silver hair that was neatly cropped, and dark cold eyes that pierced Draco as their gaze met. The man was pale, skin like snow, and he exuded a menace that had Draco instinctively backing away.
My smile fell abruptly off my face. Everything I had said – I cringed. The words sounded so callous and insensitive now.
“What happened?” Granger asked. “Our people could tell it was arson, but we couldn’t find any traces other than that the fire was created magically. And intentionally.”
It distracted me from thinking about Potter. Mostly.
The four of them stared awkwardly at each other.
“Thanks.” Harry smoothed out his shirt, looking self-conscious. It was funny to see someone who took out an entire camp of terrorists acting like a shy little boy. It was endearing, and it went to Draco’s heart faster than anything else.
“Yes,” he answered. “Once before. I came to visit my parents. That’s where I wanted to take you tonight, actually. Before we go off in search of the cave tomorrow.”
“Well, the Seven of Swords also is a sign that we need to find ways to find resolutions that puts ourselves first, that we need to be a little cunning in how we achieve our goals.”
Granger pursed her lips. “It’s hard to tell, but from the looks of it, no.” She clapped me on the shoulder, suddenly brisk. “Come on. If you’re feeling up to it, you have work to do. Take a look at those artifacts and see what you make of them. I’ll have the Curse-Breakers come after we secure the location to remove these objects safely. Can you determine if there are no further … surprises?”
Harry.
“I don’t know, Malfoy, I was attacked in your kitchen.” Despite the levity in his tone, Potter frowned. “And we still haven’t caught the rest of them yet.”
Harry flashed a cheeky grin. “Must be from spending too much time with a certain stuffy grad student.”
“No,” Potter said. “We’re not.”
“How do you know it’s my first time?” Draco asked before he could stop himself.
Draco didn’t like being manipulated in such a manner, but he nursed a grudging appreciation for Harry’s quick thinking.
“I won’t be telling what happened today to everyone at the pub tonight, if that’s what you’re worried about, Draco,” Theo said. “After all, I don’t want any rivals to get to that treasure hoard before me.”
Harry shook his head. Shacklebolt looked amused.
But then, I was not sure that I wanted to know. I had no idea what the truth would be and how it would affect my feelings for him. It was ironic – when faced with one of my longest fantasies, I elected to run.
I bit my lip. My libido went into overdrive whenever I was near him; my mind spiraled into memories I would rather forget.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked, his eyes on Cross as he stepped in front of me. “You’re a good actor, you know. Almost had me fooled.”
It was a man. He was half dressed, in his undershirt and trousers, bareheaded and barehanded. His shirtsleeves were rolled up halfway, exposing the man’s veins. They were bright blue against the skin.
He had reached the pale, twisted man. Before the man raised his wand again, Harry’s booted leg kicked out. A crack, as Harry missed, and hit the marble step. Spiderweb-like fissures appeared.
Potter remained unmoving. I stared at him. “What? If you want to show up like you are right now to the Manor, I don’t have an issue.”
Malfoy Manor … “This was when you were a child?”
It certainly looked it. The gears were cleared of the barnacles and rust that had encrusted the device when Draco last saw it, and the metal fairly shone, like it had been polished. It was still, however, the clockwork-like parts of the Decoder unmoving.
“Maybe there’s a spelunking club in the village,” suggested Harry. “Or we could see if there’s a shop that sells outdoors sporting equipment, like tents and such.”
Following Harry out of the car, Draco found himself confused and angry. He needed to sort out the past with Harry and needed to do it soon. The disperse emotions fizzed inside, like corked champagne ready to burst.
“Nope.”
Thankfully, Granger recovered her senses first and took charge.
“Let me guess: a tall dark stranger awaits me, with promises of passion and exotic adventure?” Draco snorted. “I think the tall dark stranger will be in for a rude shock when I make him help me do laundry.” He eyed Harry. “You should throw out your socks, by the way. They’re kind of disgusting.”
“Malfoy!” Potter slammed the table. It was only by the barest grasp of my self-control that I didn’t jump.
“And what does this illustrious group call themselves?” I thought about the one who attacked me, the librarian at Gringotts. Reaching deep into Wizarding society … I told Granger about the librarian and my suspicions.
It brought my only source of amusement while being stuck in the hospital bed. Some of them came with surprisingly well-drawn caricatures of me. I resolved to cut and frame them in my flat.
“Of course,” Potter said mildly.
My father glared at me. “And how do you suppose you’ll be able to find a nice girl if pictures of you and Potter are all over the news? You know no woman likes sharing, even for the most open of arrangements.”
The drop of blood rose in the air. Gossamer thin threads issued out of it like silks of a spiderweb, forming a rune that I had never seen before as it went into the wall.
I handed Cross’ letter to him without a word. Harry read it quickly, his lips disappearing into thin lines as his eyes scanned the words. Then he raised his head and looked at me.
“We’ve an investigation into them.” Her voice was low and her face serious. “They’ve been linked to a series of deaths that we haven’t been able to satisfactory show are murders. There’s also been links to money laundering and trafficking in illegal magical substances.”
“Are you all right?” Harry asked. He even sounded concerned. “I know it’s not a very pleasant flight, but we are on a tight schedule and don’t have any time to lose. If you’re feeling tired or jetlagged, the best I can do is some aspirin and coffee.”
“But we have come a long way, haven’t we?” Harry said. “I don’t think the school me would imagine myself sitting next to you even. Let alone – well – rolling around naked.”
“If you leave him unable to string two words together, we’d never be able to figure out what Lucius took from us,” Dolohov explained. “Besides, our master wants him unharmed. That should be reason enough for you.” Despite the reasonable tone, Draco could hear the edge underlying Dolohov’s words. Behind that mask of momentary amiability, there was true danger, and Greyback subsided with ill grace.
I elbowed him lightly. “Don’t be daft. No, I meant what she said about family. It’s just something we’re stuck with, aren’t we?”
“I can only provide this list with the Head Auror’s express permission,” the console said. “Him, or any other Head of Department.”
There was a knock at the door.
Draco hoped it would be there. A shipwreck thousands of years old might be difficult to find.  The digital camera had infrared and other lenses added by Shacklebolt’s men, so Draco thought they could rely on that if their own sight failed them.
Harry wondered if he had imagined it. It wouldn’t make sense for someone like Malfoy to be acquainted with thugs and drug dealers. Malfoy appeared more the type to be intimates with the luminaries of the holosceen and the opera, politicians and celebrities, whose lives provided grist for the rumor mill that the tabloids reported on breathlessly and that the public craved. It was probably how Harry had come across Malfoy’s name. Harry resolved to have Hedwig run a search as soon as he was free of these two.
Harry nodded, afraid that if he opened his mouth, a yawn might slip out. Even now, Shacklebolt was in his three-piece suit that looked pressed and fresh as though they had just been laundered. Harry suppressed the urge to run his hands down his own waistcoat.
Second: the vision and its aftermath. I didn’t need to know what the spell was to know its power. It was old, and very dangerous. Any wizard would know that in his bones. It was not Dark Magic, not exactly, but it was wild and gave me hesitation before I investigated further.
“That sounds like a job for a shop assistant at Borgin and Burkes’ than a person of quality,” my father sniffed. “Why don’t you just leave the work to them?”
“My Lord, Dolohov is returning with the Shield. He is en route as we speak.”
“Ah … you know. I don’t believe in all that bullocks. Rather not waste my time doing it.” Draco hoped the doctor-patient confidentiality extended to Rosa’s session with her fortune-seeking clients. He didn’t want to tell Harry that Draco had been too affected to continue.
Draco froze. They hadn’t seen him in the gunfight; it must be that Dolohov had somehow waited until it was over. He was dressed to blend into the surroundings and carrying – Draco noted – an extremely large gun. Next to Draco, Harry stiffened, his hand reaching slowly –
Even as I chuckled inside, I remembered what my father told me. We were related to Slytherin on the distaff side, and my father was especially fond of our distant ancestor’s exploits. My father had mentioned a Grimoire that contained Slytherin’s most powerful spells and magic.
“Yes….” Fudge seemed put out at Malfoy’s intervention. Harry was, too. The cold, cultured quality of Malfoy’s words were slightly sour, but Harry couldn’t deny that it saved him from Fudge’s invitation. “Mr. Malfoy is right. You’re needed at your job. There’s been a high increase in crime lately. We’ll need to unveil new policies soon.”
Bellatrix’s voice returned. “Everything is in order,” she told Wormtail. “Not that Fletcher would have the guts to try and swindle us in any way.”
“Malfoy –”
I put aside that itching, crawling mood. There were more important matters than feeling left out of the clique. “So our first step is to retrieve the key. I left it at the Manor.”
“And you want objects that are special, not the usual pottery. So like what?”
Harry gave a strained laugh. “I guess you’re trying to tell me that too, aren’t you?”
“Then he shouldn’t have involved me in this,” I snapped.
Draco pushed the door open.
I looked at her suspiciously. “Why? What could have befallen our great savior?”
No, I meant about the case. Then -- I can ask Malfoy to make a body like that for you, Harry said.
“No, it’s thoughtful of you. Thanks.” Potter relaxed against the bench, looking up. Here, far in the countryside, the stars were clearer; they were bright droplets in the dark backdrop.
I poured out the bottle of Riesling that was on the table for Potter and me. “Thanks for staying with me in this big old house. I don’t think I would like to stay here by myself, as interesting as it is.” Instead of returning to his flat in Camden, Potter had chosen to move into Grimmauld Place temporarily.
“Whoa! Easy there. I mean no harm.” The stranger smiled at Harry, arms raised to signify goodwill. He was easily one of the most gorgeous man Harry had ever met, with bright, teasing eyes and broad shoulders.
Underneath was Lucius’s signature.
That was odd. Harry spoke aloud to Hedwig: “Hedwig, what do you make of this?”
“Ah, he’s using his brains at last!”
I shared a look with Potter. My father had no idea, but I did. As did Potter. To think that this Blood Circle gave the man who would become the Darkest wizard of recent times the means to do so.
“I’m a gentleman; I promise I won’t look.”
They had ridden in the Humvee with Dolohov. Draco had been shoved in the backseat, Dolohov next to him, the cold gunmetal pushing against Draco’s side. Harry had driven in terse silence, obeying Dolohov’s barked directions. They had abandoned the Humvee a mile away from where they were now, walking the rest of the way. Draco’s feet were blistered and sore from the trek.
I glowered back. Blaise was as stunning as ever, his white teeth gleaming, his profile sharp and regal, like a classical bust. I loved tracing the curve of his jaws when we were sleeping together. But right now, the sight invoked irritation.
What? Harry almost crashed the hovercar into a double-decker. Hastily switching on the autopilot, he turned on Hedwig’s audio connection. “All of them?”
I dressed quickly, almost missing Blaise as he slipped out the door. His company last night had been – nice. It was a much-needed release. I stared at my sheets. Egyptian cotton, 350-thread count, they invited me back into their midst. I had a sudden urge to tear at them; there was a bereft hollowness that wanted to burst out of me.
Harry almost collided with a couple tangled in each other in his distracted state. He muttered a quick apology, trying not to notice the angry glances they threw his way. He couldn’t get the image of Malfoy lounging out of his head.
Suspect car picking up speed, Hedwig said, breaking into Harry’s enjoyment. She added, almost apologetically: their current velocity would leave you behind if you do not accelerate.
“Malfoy, I didn’t mean to offend –”
“Yes,” she said. “That’s the Pensieve. I’ll leave you two do it, then. I believe I have a meeting with the new Magical Creatures Professor. She’s just as bad as Hagrid. She asked if she could have a class on cockatrices and bring in a small one to the school. Cockatrices!”
Riddle nodded, stopping Dolohov and Bellatrix from objecting. Wormtail’s brow was furrowed, like he was unable to fathom such a request at this particular time. And indeed, Draco was surprised at himself for having demanded it.
“These Healers have appalling manners,” I said. “Being a Healer does not exempt one from the simple courtesy of knocking before entering.” Although I had to admit leaving the door wide open was an oversight. But both Harry and I had been – distracted – at the time.
“What? You don’t think that the Cruciatus stopped working just because I pulled you out of there, do you?”
It never came. Harry leveled at kick at the man that knocked him out. This time brutally.
“If you sink us, you’ll likely sink the Decoder along with it,” Draco said, trying to think. He spotted Harry moving, stealthily now, as both Bellatrix and Dolohov’s eyes were on Draco. Draco had to keep talking, keep them from noticing Harry. “I don’t think your master would be very pleased, will he?”
We moved into the living room, this time me being the one to push Potter down on the couch. I sat on top of Potter, feeling the firm press of his cock against my arse.
Speaking of which, Harry had brought his own gear. He dropped a heavy duffel from his back. It landed with a thud. Cameras, with titanium housing and controls that could fine tune the image even while taking it underwater. There were two miniature ones that could easily be attached to the diving masks.
“They’re not worth your loyalty,” Harry said. “They’ll use you and discard you when you’ve outlived your usefulness.”
Harry was the first to turn away. “Yes,” he said, and he sounded like he was in the middle of a cold. “We are.”
Draco shook his head. “No, I think I’m going to step outside. Get some air. That one card was – well, I’m still not a believer, but –”
“Yes ….” Dolohov bared his teeth in a smile. “Harry knows all about this. Probably more familiar with it than I do, to be honest.” He turned his attention to Harry. “You’re ever present in our master’s thoughts. I suppose you should feel honored by that. Not many of us can claim the same.”
The man who had asked was rather short, with bandy legs, and untidy straggling hair. It was not the sort of untidiness like Harry’s, which made Draco want to run his hands through, but an unpleasant mop that lice would find perfect as a home. There was a strong smell of alcohol and cigar smoke about him. Draco stopped himself from wrinkling his nose at the last minute.
“True.” Harry nodded. “I can always see you as a Janeite.” Harry raked his eyes over Draco. “I think you would look rather fetching in a bonnet.”
It was also the middle of a weekday. Unlike me, most had more regimented schedules. It was one of the perks of my chosen career, I suppose. I let my mind drift as I made my way back home. The elms swayed softly in the wind, a gentle whispering as the branches danced gently. The leaves were crisp, falling slowly in an amber shower.
Harry sat, holding onto the ledge, Draco next to him.
There was a resounding explosion and a lick of heat that flared, momentarily chasing away the cold. Dolohov yelled, his gun automatically firing.
Potter smiled as he relaxed. “Sounds like the punchline of a bad joke.” He took a sip of his wine. It really was not bad, I thought. I should ask Potter where he had bought it.
Malfoy flicked his gaze to Harry. “No,” he said after a while. “It doesn’t.”
Shacklebolt gave a faint smile. “Did you hear that from Finnegan or Padma? They’re the only two who follows the gossip blogs that closely. I don’t think he had anything to do with Riddle except for having the misfortune of being in a family that fell under Riddle’s sway.”
There were no tents available, so Draco was sown to one of the VIP quarters for the night. It was only a small hut with a minimal of furnishings: a hard cot, a rickety chair, and an even more unsteady wooden desk.
The distance from the cam was too great. Harry only saw two dark-haired figures in the front, one of them the driver.
Once again, I was left wondering how long until I could wash off the stink of my past. Judging by her behavior. Life had improved tremendously for our lot, by which I meant the children of the former Death Eaters, I had to admit. And loathe was I to credit Potter and his lackeys, their actions and attitudes had made all the difference between hidden hostility and outright persecution.
I led Potter through the grand foyer, our shoes echoing on the marble. It was dark and strangely saddening to see it so empty. The elves were most likely busy at their tasks or busy restoring the Manor.
Despite this, Draco could tell the man had been handsome once. The evidence on his face suggested perhaps a botched operation in the past. It was a discordant sight, to have the contrast so in prominence.
“Ron,” Granger began reprovingly at the same time Potter said, “Malfoy,” in a warning tone.
“It’s going well. Lots of paperwork, dealing with idiots, the typical day of a civil servant.” She fished the olive out of her glass. “Did you give any more thought to my offer? About consulting for the Ministry?”
Draco watched his breath form small puffs as he waited for Harry outside the caravan. Unlike Draco, Harry had no problem utilizing the entire session.
“Both.” Malfoy set his palmtop on the bedside table. “Potter, what I gave you is a very diluted form of the drug that’s been running through London. The one that was in that big bust you just got credit for in the Mail the other day.”
Harry thanked Hedwig.
“Unfortunately, the wicked never sleep, and that means we don’t get to either,” Harry said. “It’s not like we can order takeout. You saw our entrance.”
A brisk wind picked up when they stepped out of the station.
“Besides,” Draco continued, “I’m fairly certain it’ll be around here.” He bent down, his free hand exerting pressure on the marble. It was cold and chalky with the accumulated grime of centuries. Draco had only been here a few weeks ago, visiting his father. And yet the timelessness made that feel so long ago.
McLaggen’s face mottled. Harry added: “It was his idea. He thought it might cut through the layers of bureaucracy and that you have better things to do than listen to me.”
“Thank you,” I responded automatically, as I took a piece of toast. It was all my stomach could handle right now. Then I realized as I sat down, that somehow Potter had become my responsibility. Or, at the very least, my family regarded him as such.
“’This is a business transaction,’” Fletcher mimicked. “God, all you posh boys are the same. What I wouldn’t do to take you down a notch –”
“No,” Dolohov said. He, too, glanced at the object curiously. “And I was imagining something bigger.”
… A hooded man, approaching the Unspeakables. The man obviously had something to hide, if he had a jammer that prevented the Leaky’s security from homing in on him. And he knew who to speak with …
“Toss the Decoder over here, boy,” Bellatrix commanded.
“At least he can’t reach the Grimoire any longer,” I said lightly. “Not with all the protection the Ministry has to offer.”
Draco sat back, trying to tug off his shirt.
“That is …” Now it was his turn to look nervous. “If you want to, of course. If you don’t, there’s no pressure. I mean, I understand –”
London was truly a world city, I thought with sudden appreciation, even as I glared at an old man hobbling adjacent that he almost touched me. He continued onwards, blithely unaware. I envied him.
I really should stop needling my father. It was childish behavior, unbefitting of a grown man. But the look on his face just now – I couldn’t help but chuckle.
“I’ll come help,” I said, breaking into a swifter pace as she ran towards the back. “Make sure your telephone is ready so you can call your Healer.”
I stepped back, my arms instinctively shielding my face. Even had I no inkling of magic, I would still have been able to see that this was far more dangerous than ordinary fire. Hotter and fiercer, with shapes of deadly creatures – a basilisk, a chimera, a manticore – reflected in the inferno.
Harry shifted his eyes downward. “I’m sorry about that.”
“No,” Draco said and he silently apologized before aiming the Shield straight at Dolohov. It flew, propelled by the momentum, like a discus of the old. It arced through the air, smoothly despite its weight.
There was a jutting mass of broken wood and rusted metal up ahead. Harry tapped Draco. Draco nodded. He saw. They inched closer.
“He’s a noted recluse. Once in a while, there comes an article from those society columnists wondering whether he died or not.” Finnegan had a disturbing penchant for consuming the tabloids. “I suppose he just avoids the limelight and the tabloids very well, since he was with the Minister just now. Don’t blame him, really.”
Then we were back in the current day.
They walked out of the office together, enjoying the London night air. It was a coolant to Draco’s overheated skin. He inhaled, luxuriating in the messiness of it, picking up the hints of petrol, and strangely, of the contrasting flowers.
“Are there any thing down there?”
“All the Unspeakables who were involved with the Hallows project are dead,” Harry said. “They all apparently visited the Underground before their deaths.”
“We have a few questions we like to ask you,” Potter continued, ignoring my look.
“Why is that?” Harry asked.
Granger seemed surprised and pleased. I quickly spoke before she was tempted to explain her alterations. “Are you going to assign someone to look into this now?”
“Don’t you touch Draco,” Harry said. He sounded completely at odds with the calm he had only recently projected. “If you do, I’ll –”
“It’s extremely rare and difficult to perform,” I said. “And it’s not exactly Dark Magic, though I’m always of the philosophy that magic is magic, and the intent determines whether it should be considered Dark magic or not.”
“If you really think recovering stolen goods is equivalent to attempts on mine and my family’s lives, then you really are deluded.”
“I would ….” I hesitated. “I wonder if it’s possible to visit my parents? You said they were at St. Mungo’s right?”
“Yeah … this was around the time of the Aurors’ annual review. It didn’t go down well.”
“What were you thinking?” Harry said. “I’m so furious with you – you have no business being out here – you could have been hurt – or worse –”
We were silent for a moment. After that interruption and the bomb of an offer Granger dropped, neither of us were particularly in the mood to do anything, though my cock twitched occasionally as I settled back against the swell of Harry’s chest.
“There are ne’er-do-wells in even the smallest village,” Harry said, buttering his toast with an obscene glob of the stuff. “And you said that tourists come to the village all the time.”
Goyle laughed. He had found his own sense of self when he separated from our little trio when Crabbe died, apprenticed under a builder, and gradually worked his way to owning his own contracting business. In a way, he was the most well-adjusted out of all us. Crabbe was — well — dead.
Granger’s unwelcome voice was a splash of cold water. I nearly toppled off Potter as he rose from the couch.
I enjoyed many a sundaes and cones there in the halcyon days of my childhood, before everything turned to shit and my world crashed into an abyss of horror and darkness. They had decided to keep it as a memorial for all whose lives had been lost in the war … Even now, after ten years, I sometimes still imagined old Fortescue himself emerging with a cheerful grin and a huge waffle cone piled high with scoops.
“The Blood Circle,” my father said. “That’s what they call themselves.” He raised his wand and drew a circle in the air. Green sparks formed into an ouroboros, shining, above his desk. I stared at it. That was the emblem of the Grimoire that artist depictions usually included.
Malfoy made a sound between a huff and a laugh. “I’m going to shop for chairs after this,” he said under his breath.
Yours truly,
Harry scratched his head. “I don’t know about you, but I’m still damn exhausted. Without the coffee, I’d be a collapsed heap right now.”
Madam Rosa laughed. “You’re a skeptic, I see. Well, I don’t claim to be Nostradamus, but a reading is highly personal, even among a couple such as you two. It’s also an opportunity for you to unburden yourself in private.” She gave the two of them an unreadable glance. “If you two insist, however, I can do a couple’s reading.”
They were never frequent or long, his liaisons. Men met through the chatrooms on the Web, through layers of secrecy and encrypted identity, that were willing to risk ruin for a momentary mitigation of loneliness with physical intimacy.
“What did my father have to do with this?” Draco asked Dolohov. “Why did he have to die?”
“We need more than just luck to beat Riddle,” Harry said, finally cracking a glimmer of a smile. “He’s the most powerful criminal in Europe, if not the world. And how do you plan to find him? We’ve tried for years without success.”
“That I’m the kept boy to a fabulously wealthy man?” Blaise winked at me. “I’ll be expecting expensive jewelry and exotic flowers from you.”
I came to consciousness groggily. My head ached. There was a nasty throb all over my body that I knew was the aftermath of the Stunning Spell.
It was modern and strangely comforting, decorated in warm, earthy hues. It was a good balance of modernist and traditional furniture. A large desk took up most of the space. True to her boast, it was neat, and I stared jealously at the lack of stray papers. Framed pictures of the golden trio and her other Gryffindor friends were interspersed, with that Muggle ‘laptop’ contraption and a quill and inkpot to the side.
Cross gave Potter a disdainful look. “I’m surprised someone as stupid as you managed to pass the Auror exams. Of course I’m not coming with you.” He turned to me. “You, young Master Malfoy, will be coming with me, though.”
“I can stay at my flat in Knightsbridge. Or the family townhouse in Belgravia.”
Motes of dust danced in the sunlight while Draco ruminated. Last night … it had been by turns passionate and gentle, their bodies joining together in sensual pleasure that still made Draco’s toes curl. It was clear that they both still remembered each other’s particular quirks, like how Harry preferred Draco’s mouth hot over his cock or how Draco enjoyed being pinned to the bed…. Draco blushed. He was getting aroused again. It wouldn’t do for Draco to be so distracted in the day.
Harry refrained from rolling his eyes and looked around the room. Everything appeared in order. There was nothing that appeared immediately out of place; Harry could spend some time exploring, but he was reluctant to be more intrusive than was necessary.
“I almost convinced myself that I did, but for the fact that my mother wouldn’t look me in the eye and my father had a satisfied expression on his face. And then there was this.” Malfoy rolled up his sleeve. On the inner part of his left forearm was a dark splatch. It had the odd shape of a skull with a serpent protruding from its mouth.
The librarian took one final glance at me with undisguised malevolence and fled.
“What looks out of place?” Harry asked Hedwig. “Anything stand out to you?”
Ron shot Malfoy an annoyed glance. “We’re not stupid, Malfoy. In any case, these types of transactions are delicate. We remember them clearly and we haven’t done any of these in a long time.”
Draco entered into a facility that would make an archaeologist with the most well-equipped lab weep with envy. An enormous table took up most of the space, filled with microscopes and books. There was a sieve shaker and small muffle furnace used for burning off organic compounds. Two centrifuges and weights were on the sides of the table.
“We want to know what you know about them,” Potter said. “We might not be Ministry officials, but what we’re doing still impact people’s lives. Your help could save a lot of people.”
My father swore. I looked at him, dumbfounded. I had never seen him so discomfited, let alone utter a profanity.
“I trust you are being discreet in your inquiries,” Riddle said, in his high, cold voice. “I know that the British Secret Service is on our tails. We cannot afford to expose ourselves before we are ready.”
The wise man knew when to retreat. Draco and Harry left with alacrity, out under the baleful gaze of a glowering Fletcher.
“You can’t be serious,” Harry said. “We’re not unchanging caricatures, no matter what you think. People change; they learn and see the error of their ways. Only you would have such a blinkered and uncompromising view of the world.”
“Malfoy?” There was a small cough. “Your elbows are on my ribs right now. It’s making it hard to breath.”
Harry rubbed his head. He needed to leave as quickly as possible. Obviously, this club’s atmosphere of decadent debauchery was beginning to affect him.
“Try radioing him again,” Draco said, feeling none of the confidence his tone held. “Maybe the radio will be on now.”
“Yeah, I don’t think I can sleep here with it like that,” I said. “Maybe I should have the Manor house-elves come clean.”
I turned my attention back to book, sufficiently in control of myself again. I took out my wand, rapping the book smartly.
I was touched, even as I was annoyed my little ploy failed. “It’s not that bad,” I admitted. “I would like to breathe air that’s not stale with dust once in a while, and I do miss being with my friends, but your house is actually fascinating in its own right. I’ve been listening to some of Kreacher’s stories. And the Black heirlooms – many of them belong in museums. Did you know you have a Mycenean cursed object in your drawing room?”
I sat in one of the wooden chairs, watching the flow of people come and go. It was unlikely that I’d be attacked in the Ministry itself. Despite this, my fingers still danced nervously as I held onto my wand under my robes.
“If I hadn’t given your name to Shacklebolt ….” Harry whispered. He blinked. “I’m sorry.”
“What do we do?” Harry asked. “Poke at the tiles until they break?”
“You were thrashing,” Potter said. He bit his lip. “One of the elves came in to check on you and thought you were having a fit and came to fetch me.”
“It’s always exciting for us professors to have our former students return,” McGonagall said. Except for her hair turning from grey to silver and lines etched deeper on her face, she was unchanged, looking as she did more than a decade ago, when she greeted us on the doorsteps of the Great Hall. “And visiting with Mr. Potter, no less. I understand you want to borrow the Pensieve?”
Unbidden, a pair of grey eyes swam into Harry’s mind, paired with that faint, sardonic smile that was both infuriating and challenging. Harry wondered how it would feel under his lips.
They were exposed, too.
“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “I don’t care about that anymore. It’s too long ago, and we’re going to have to work on how we communicate, but I don’t blame you. And I understand why you did what you did. I’m still angry, but – but --” Draco broke off, too embarrassed to continue.
We sped along the air. I couldn’t look back, nor could I bear to. I had no love of the Manor, but to see it burn wrenched at me. And my parents ….
“Ah.” Draco was only wearing a light sweater, barely enough during the day, but wholly inadequate at night. “I hadn’t expected to be out this late.”
Draco was about to object when Harry exited the caravan, leaving Draco alone with Madam Rosa.
Or … a more prosaic idea came to mind: I could simply try to read what the book had to say. I wanted to hit myself for not thinking that earlier.
We looked at each other, our shock mirrored on each other’s faces. My head split, my eyes watered –
“You need to forgive yourself,” he said, air from his mouth tickling my ear. “You were a child. But you’re not that child anymore. You need to let go.”
“That’s also why we can’t assign you any protection from the Aurors. All the ones on the team investigating are fully occupied and I don’t trust any of the ones who I haven’t vetted yet.” She stared down at the photo on her desk. Potter waved at her and gave me a dark look.
“You’ve also have experience mountaineering, which will come handy in such a mountainous terrain. You can ride, shoot, and  –”
“I’ll write to McGonagall,” Potter said, running a hand through his hair. He looked tired. Suddenly, I was reminded that I wasn’t the only one undertaking this – Potter had been with me, if not for every step, then at least most of it.
“I hate going into memories,” he grumbled. I pulled him up. “Where are we? It looks like –”
“What? —Oh. Oh.” Potter seemed to get the hint. He looked around, at anywhere but me. I watched him take in the decor of the Manor.
“Well, that’s me.” I gestured. “Unless you want a nightcap?”
“Are you jealous?” Blaise snaked an arm around Malfoy too. “Don’t be. I don’t mind being … double-booked.”
Harry elbowed someone into the bar, tossed a tray. With his wand in hand, Harry blasted a path to the entrance.
Cross’ words were the truth; denying it made no sense. I hated the scowls and chill that descended when I walked into the room. The way crowds parted away from me or how servers would inevitably ‘lose’ my orders. Strangely, I had found refuge in the Muggle world until the furor faded.
He has to stifle his laugh at the energies of youth. Is it possible that the Malfoy boy refuses his duty out of simple lust for the Potter boy? It’s possible. Cross always thinks that the short, distracted thinking is one of their hallmarks.
“That was Tom Riddle,” Harry said, louder. “He came himself.”
That sounded familiar. Harry’s head was still groggy and his memory slow, but what Malfoy described had a ring to it that he couldn’t place at the moment. He wished he could ask Hedwig. Much as Harry liked to boast he was relatively unmodified and an original human compared to his colleagues, he had grown accustomed to Hedwig’s voice in his ear. Without, it was like walking unbalanced.
What should he do? Draco could take a risk and tell Harry everything, force Harry to answer the questions he had, and this time comprehensively. He was unsure if that was the best step to take; there was a part of him that acknowledged the remote possibility that he might not like the answer.
“Harry.” I interrupted his increasingly incoherent words. “I would be honored. Just let me freshen up a bit. I don’t think I want to meet your parents looking like this.”
Taking advantage of my father’s momentary (and very rare) speechlessness, my mother interjected, “Make sure you bring a nice gift for young Teddy, dear. I believe he just started at Hogwarts. He’ll probably miss home. Maybe sweets or something. That castle has dreadful cooking.”
“All sorts,” Harry repeated Finnegan’s words. There was something in his tone that cut off the manager’s stammers. Harry disliked this man already, and his manner was bumbling and narrowminded. Though no more than most of the Ministry officials he worked with, Harry reminded himself.
It was two years since the day of that crash. That flood of emotion, of anger and grief, of hurt and regret, still tormented Draco, the cut as fresh as when he had first saw the news on television.
“You can choose your own family,” Harry said. “Blood is blood, but blood is not family. Family supports you, and they can be found, and formed when that group that shares your values and unconditional love comes into being.”
“It’s my pa,” she said, shaking her head with exasperated fondness. “He refuses to think that this village has crime of any sort, even though Mrs. Muffe’s silver went missing a couple of weeks ago under ‘mysterious circumstances.’”
“That man’s an Unspeakable?” Finnegan chewed his lip. “I think I understand why we’re sent now. They definitely do not want anyone else catching wind of this business.”
They were now joined by Draco’s parents. Draco’s eyes moved to the name besides his father’s. Draco wrapped his arms around himself. He shivered, his lungs momentarily forgetting how to function. He couldn’t stop the parade of memories: Narcissa Malfoy smiling and pouring a cup of tea as she inquired about his day; his mother’s pointed attempts to set Draco up with one of the Greengrass girls; the surprise Draco had felt when she took Harry by the arm the first time Draco had brought him around to meet his parents.
“In a bit,” I said, and I reached for his prick under his briefs. It was firm and hot. I flexed my fingers and he let out a hiss.
Draco supposed that was as far as the ‘reprimand’ would go. Really, it was rather annoying to see the Golden Boy get off with not even a slap on the wrist.
Harry and I wanted to host this partly to gauge how well our respective friends could mix. With the exception of the irate Pansy, they seemed to get along. At the very least, no fistfights had broken out. Yet.
“Don’t you have special agents for these types of things?” Draco asked. He couldn’t deny he was warmed by Shacklebolt’s praise. “I appraise antiquities. I don’t steal them from clandestine criminal meetings.”
“Are you talking about your godfather’s old house?” Draco dimly recalled waiting in the rain outside while Harry raced in to fetch something. Draco had only the faintest impressive of a foreboding and unprepossessing structure.
“There’s no need for that,” Draco said coldly, and he did get out of the chair now. “There might be a financial crisis going on, but the Malfoy accounts are more than enough to meet your requests.”
“You’re not in financial distress,” Potter said mildly, though I could swear a smile played in the corner of his mouth. “What you’re wearing probably could pay my rent for a week. And who actually uses the word ‘pecuniary’ in conversation?”
I reached out to touch it. It was cool, the fabric gently grazing my fingertips.
I was right: the piece of toast was all I could handle for breakfast. “Can we not do this in the morning? I’m finished, by the way. I’ll be in the library.”
And then screen for vehicles matching the description? Done.
“Strong?” Harry took a look at Draco’s face and laughed. “I think they changed their drinks menu.”
“Even so, you can’t just stop and ask everyone you encounter if they had seen the people you want. Do you know how many people are down here?”
“We need to talk,” he repeated.
“Well, I’m a skeptic,” Draco said, lulled by her businesslike tone, “so I don’t think it really matters. And half an hour is fine; we have a dinner appointment soon.”
“Sorry,” I mumbled. My headache was returning. I poured myself some coffee and stared glumly at the buffet.
“Potter, you don’t need to act like a virgin,” Malfoy said with a touch of amusement. “I barely started.”
“You’re glad to be back, aren’t you?” I asked. “In the middle of the action, the adrenaline pumping, all of it.”
There was silence.
Harry came over to Draco.
“No,” he repeated, more softly. “I’ll help you. If you give me your word that no one will get hurt.”
“Malfoy.” Now there was an edge of frustration in Potter’s tone. “I’m not asking you to marry me. I just want to talk about it. You think I’m fit, I think you’re attractive – let’s be adults about this.”
Then I landed. Harry dropped next to me, ungracefully, on his backside.
Harry almost didn’t hear her. The roar of wind filled his ears – he soared through the sky, hands barely on the handle, the Firebolt obeying his slightest touch.
You don’t need to go this fast, Hedwig said in Harry’s ears. You can cut back forty percent and still catch up to the suspects. Not to mention you’re breaking the speed limit.
It was that man Draco had glimpsed from a distance in the helicopter. The man was bald, with a shiny plate of a head that seemed to gleam with its own source of illumination in the dim room. He had flat, almost non-existent nostrils, but not like how sometimes those who had been in a fight did, flat and squashed. These were like slits.
The surrounding heads turned their way.
Draco’s entire body was on fire, the lines of heat from earlier igniting into an all-out inferno. It consumed all the oxygen from his brain.
There was a tinkle of laughter from the other table. Soft chimes of silverware and wineglasses were a subtle accompaniment to the New Age instrumental playing. This was a very trendy, very upscale restaurant. Who would have expected a possible criminal transaction taking place at the very moment?
“It moves by a crank to the side,” Riddle said, gesturing. “Our analysis have shown that much. We haven’t tried it yet, not certain of what would happen should it move.”
“What? Why?”
“In any case, I will begin work on it,” Hedwig said, her voice coming over hidden speakers in the room. “You should shower. Is there anything you wish to keep out of the report?”
They then spent the rest of the morning in video conference with Shacklebolt and Dawlish, reviewing the plan one last time. They would monitor the rendezvous point, with Harry bringing several other men to ensure that the handoff did happen. At the last possible moment, they would go in, arresting those involved and seizing the Shield and everything else that they happened to bring along.
“I won’t,” I promised. “If anything, I’ll include a chapter about it.”
Potter rubbed his eyes. “There are a lot of alleyways in London, and I still have to work. I can’t watch you all day. And I can’t ask Hermione or Ron to do that either; they also have jobs.”
