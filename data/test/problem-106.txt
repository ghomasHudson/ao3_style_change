“Soon,” she sighed. “I assume you have plans this weekend, but next weekend, you should be free.”
They stared at each other for a few moments, before Harry let out a yawn, blinking a few times. “What time is it?”
“Have sleepovers?” Harry asked, stabbing the side of his egg.
“There’s a good place for fish and chips at the other end if you want that?” Harry offered.
“Yes, your father and I. We want to meet him. Take him to the house.”
“Generous,” he laughed again.
“Mhm, okay. Do you need anything else, Malfoy?” He asked.
“Did they never ask what you wanted to do?” Draco asked. Part of him felt bad, which was a strange feeling when directed towards Harry.
“Harry. You said you’d do this to figure out how he thinks! You’d get into his head, and be able to play against him better. That was your entire reasoning. And I’ve yet to hear you mention it!” She sounded like she had an idea now, but he wasn’t sure what it was.
“It was fine. We got breakfast, talked, kind of. It was fine.” Draco wiped some sleep from his eye, trying to sound disinterested. He fidgeted in his seat for a second, keeping his eyes forward. “He’s a twat, though.”
“I’ll come to Pansy’s.” A taxi pulled in, Harry already pulling the door open. He got in, his face turning back to Draco, who remained on the pavement. “Cmon.”
“A footballer? Yes, I know.” He pulled cash from his pocket. “Can I get two bags?”
“I hear Diggory got a stern talking to by his manager! He was
“I suppose,” Draco shrugged. “If we have to label it, sure.”
“Are you banishing us?” Blaise tilted his head.
liked to do. Not your exes.” Draco said it as if it were obvious, and Harry frowned back.
“You’re terrible at this, Draco. I’m in Brighton.”
” he said his name as if it were dirty. His eyes were narrowed. He looked almost ready for a fight.
“God, you could be a professional reviewer with critiques like that, Potter.”
“I thought the milk and bread were for you,” Harry murmured.
“I’m just finished training,” Harry told him.
He immediately tensed in Draco’s arm, his head whipping back to look forward again. “Fucker.”
“No, but I bought it for that purpose. Amazed it took you that
He bagged up his groceries, thinking it over momentarily. “You’re wrong,” he decided. He pulled his wallet from his pocket, tapping his card against the machine before re-pocketing it. He flashed a grin at the cashier, grabbing his bag.
“God, your last fight was tragic. The lads were taking bets on if you were going to punch him or fuck him,” Blaise explained.
Draco took away their empty plates when they were done, dropping them into the sink. He kept his back to Harry for a few moments, his mind in overdrive that he couldn’t seem to stop. He turned, slightly, his eyes wandering over his shoulder to find Harry watching him. He pretended he wasn’t when Draco caught him, his eyes drifting to the other side of the room. “You brought a bag,” he decided to say.
“No, I have a milkshake!” She shrieked back.
He was still paging through it when Harry arrived into the kitchen, standing on the other side of the counter. He was wearing an outfit similar to Draco. His hair was in a similar state of waviness, while his hair tried to dry itself atop his head. He also wore large, rounded glasses which shocked Draco. “I didn’t know you were blind, Potter.”
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked. He was at the counter, just across from Draco, his cooking abandoned.
“Oh, very,” Harry agreed. “Never felt butterflies until Malfoy called me a sappy git.”
“What do you usually like to do on dates?” Draco asked before he could stop himself.
He didn’t have the chance, though, because the office door was opening again, the two publicists stepped back inside. “Okay, we think you should go for breakfast today, get to know each other a bit. Maybe tomorrow too. We’ll keep in touch for a while until you feel more.. natural about the whole thing. Paparazzi are bound to follow you around, but keep the touchy-feely stuff on the low for the moment. Maybe an arm touch here, leaning closer there. Speculations should begin soon, but neither of you is to answer a single question to the press. Whatsoever.”
“What?” She sounded shocked or stunned maybe. Draco couldn’t tell which.
“Oh,” Draco sounded again.
“Uhm, after our last match, you texted to apologise, and we ended up chatting from there, and falling in love, or whatever.”
“Does that mean you wouldn’t hit me with your car now?” Harry questioned.
“I usually just did what they wanted to do,” Harry shrugged again.
“Why? So you could come too?”
“Exactly. We’ve known each other for almost three years and never shared a kind word. I figured it would be easier to get to know you like this.” His honesty surprised Draco, but he tried not to let that show. “It’s worked so far.”
“More than generous.” He sat up properly, again, tapping the side of Harry’s hand. “Would you bid on me?”
“Yes,” Draco responded.
Harry’s eyebrows raised, but he didn’t look at Draco. “Press.”
“Cho really liked going for Indian food, and playing Wii bowling,” Harry admitted. “And Cedric liked to watch French films, and go on jogs.”
“Potter?” Draco asked, shock running through him at the mention of the name. “What’s he here for?”
image! Currently, you seem like a selfish player, who hogs the ball, and a complete man whore who seems to spend all his free time doing coke in Soho.”
“Slightly,” Theo agreed, smiling behind Blaise’s head.
Harry looked at him, eyebrow raising slightly. “No.”
“Mhm, I do.” Harry decided. He nudged Draco’s arm, slightly, drawing his attention. “Act happy. You can go home and mope later, but you know as well as I do that Minerva will kill you if you look so unhappy in pictures.”
Harry narrowed his eyes, badly folding his sheet of paper without looking at it. “Sorry, we can’t all be pretentious dicks who list Christopher Nolan films as our favourite. Everyone knows Batman is his best work, not that shitshow.”
He disappeared out the door, Pansy swinging it shut, immediately glaring at Draco. “You!”
“Great,” she sighed. “Look, Draco, you either like him and sleep with him again and have something serious. Or you don’t sleep with him again, you wait out your ‘relationship’, and you remain amicable. You cannot sleep with him again and expect no consequences, though.”
“No sleepovers?” Theo laughed.
“Oh,” was all Harry said.
“What?” Draco almost snapped. “Blaise and Theo are here!”
a murderer will stroll through this door, and you’ll be dead.”
“Are you going to show me?” Harry asked, curious as ever.
They ended up in a Tesco extra, Draco trying to remember exactly what he needed, as Harry carried a basket. He dropped a small carton of milk into it, and a small loaf of bread, and a bag of fresh pasta. “Do you actually know what you’re looking for in here?” Harry asked. “You look like someone who’s never been to a supermarket.”
“You didn’t tell me to do that!” He protested.
“I don’t think so,” Harry shrugged, nudging Draco in the process. Draco stroked Harry’s shoulder with his thumb, unaware of his actions. “Did you?”
“She’ll say anything to sell a paper, dear. She’s a bitch.” Pansy handed him a glass, grinning. She left Draco’s beside him. “Okay, pictures to make her scream. Draco, raise your glass, and use your left hand to hold the spatula.”
“God, they were painful when they were at each other’s throats, and they’re even fucking
“I am smart, Draco.” She snapped.
“Is your eye okay?”
“Fine!”
“Well, I couldn’t exactly wear it to Gryffindor training, can I?” The waiter delivered their drinks, scurrying back inside.
“Wake them up this early, and they fucking won’t.” Harry huffed the words, hanging up. Draco frowned to himself, pocketing the phone, trying to shake his nerves.
“Don’t scold me.” Harry snapped.
“Yeah,” Fred nodded enthusiastically. “If it’s 30, anal.”
“Shopping,” Harry said, dropping back a step so they were beside each other. “You need to get anything?”
“I’m at a party, did you really call me for this?”
The boy nodded, offering a slight smile. “I’m okay,” he murmured. “Are you?”
“What?” Theo shrieked.
“Or it could be good! You could learn about him, and the way he thinks, and then you can figure out how he plays!” She seemed to be onto something, He nodded, slowly, listening. “Every derby you do, every championship game, every premier league match.. You could know what he’s thinking, and understand exactly how he’s going to play. You let Blaise know, and you’ll be golden. Slytherin will be beating Gryffindor left, right, and centre. You’ll be a genius!”
“How come you abandoned it today?” He questioned.
“These are football teams, y’know? Opposing teams, even.” The middle-aged man behind the counter hadn’t bothered to look at him, yet. He was scanning the barcodes, his eyes down.
“For what?” Draco tilted his head.
He laughed, lightly, his eyes falling towards Draco, who stood back, slightly, arms crossed. “I’ll see you around?”
They made it to bed in the early hours of the morning, silent goodnights being nodded at each other as they disappeared into their rooms.
“No?”
“Indeed,” she hummed. “Well, we want to meet him.”
“What about the teams?” Harry questioned, eyeing his godfather who had remained silent through their meeting.
“I didn’t know you wanted me to bid that much!” Cho snapped back. Draco could barely hear them, but they became clearer as she approached. “You just said you needed a date! I didn’t know I had to pay for it as well!”
“Are you okay?” She sounded worried. “It looks bad.”
He was right, but Draco was still semi-offended by the question. He thought it over, sighing to himself. “A week.” Harry rose an eyebrow. “Last Saturday! And before that, it was a month since I’d even locked lips with someone, okay?”
“What is it?” Harry went to open the bag, but Draco held up a hand.
They both remembered the last match they’d played against one another. Blaise had managed to get into a scrap with Ron Weasley, who had immediately begun shouting, which had attracted the rest of the team to the fight. After everyone had managed to get dragged away, Harry and Draco were left shouting obscenities at each other, threatening to throw punches, or worse. Finally, Draco had managed to lunge, Harry lunging back, tackling one another onto the ground. A yellow card had been flashed, both players forced onto the bench, and their photos splashed across BBC News that evening.
“Well, we don’t have to,” Harry said, quickly.
Harry laughed slightly. “You’re just as pretentious as I thought.”
“So, we could say we’ve been taking things almost seriously, maybe a month, but I wouldn’t commit properly, so you got revenge by sleeping with someone last Saturday, and it made me come to my senses, and we became official, in private.” Harry rushed, his mind working quicker than his mouth. Draco watched, amazement and irritation clouding his mind.
“What’s this for?” Draco asked, moving slightly. His couch was an L shape, and he awkwardly threw his legs beside Harry’s.
Harry watched as Draco grabbed cups from a shelf, and made them both fresh cups of coffee, which he added dashes of milk to, and some syrup. He handed Harry his and walked past, determined to get back to the living room.
Draco glared at him, his head whipping back to the publicists. “See. They know how he is as well as I do. They won’t believe we suddenly became pals.”
“Do you want to get food?”
“Failed to mention it,” Draco shrugged. He finally stood in front of Harry, his hand running up and down the strap of his bag as he tried not to fidget. “Did you really come to give me a lift?”
“I did.” He responded. He took another gulp of his coffee, pushing it away. “We know each other, in passing obviously, on and off the pitch. Ran into each other more than once. Apparently, you texted me, after our last match.”
“You call, I come running,” Draco shrugged, his fingers lingering on Harry’s hip. The girl beside them was having breathing problems, her blonde head-shaking as she stared
“A warning?”
“Thanks?” Harry questioned.
Harry nodded, slowly, returning to his previous position. “I didn’t read it yet.”
“Except me. I feel honoured.” Draco closed the book, pushing it across the counter. “What’s this?”
“Hm?”
The auction ended after a few minutes, raising a large sum of money for their charity. The stage was cleared for a DJ, who set up quickly. Music started up, while lights began flashing. Pansy managed to make it to the dance floor, forcing Theo to dance with her while Blaise was taken off by his bidder. Fred and Angelina also staggered away from their table, leaving Harry and Draco alone. Cho had put down a small bid for Cedric, not really bothering to go over 2 grand. He seemed to be stroppy about that, and as more people flocked to the dance floor, Cedric stood at the bar, snapping at his date.
“I have to go and meet my friends. I wanted to run our story again.” He put his phone on speaker again, leaving it on the shelf of his wardrobe as he pulled fresh clothes out, beginning to get dressed. “So, can we run it?”
Finally, the doors opened, both of them stepping out. Draco didn’t bother knocking, instead just pushing the door open. She usually left it unlocked. “Took your fucking time, Dray. You were meant to make me lunch, and now it’s gonna have to be dinner. And you’ve missed half of Fantastic Mr Fox.”
Draco pulled on his second shoe, tying it. “I’ll see you later.”
“I’m not,” Draco lied. He knew he was, though. And Harry knew too. He stared at him for a few seconds until finally, Draco sighed. “I’m tired.”
“Do we look good?”
“Yeah. I met him once or twice. Rude on both occasions, and snarky about it,” Draco crossed his arms, trying to remember. “I mean, he’s an okay player, but I think he’s far too cocky about it all. I didn’t like you two together.”
“Okay then.” Draco pulled his bag from his arm, holding it out to Harry, who gingerly took it, a fake smile on his face. “Thank you.”
“Because I don’t.” Draco snapped. “Aren’t dates meant to be.. like, dinner or something?"
“Oh heavens, yes, it’s this week,” Minerva frowned, flipping a page of her diary. She sighed to herself, scribbling something before looking back at her screen. “Anyway, there’s a red carpet on the way in, so we need couples poses at that. And obviously, inside, appear as perfect as you can.”
“More dates?”
“Let’s go.” Draco decided, slipping out of the booth. He pulled a fifty-pound note out of his jacket, dropping it onto the table, Harry slid out of the booth too, fixing his jumper. Draco let him walk first, his fingers brushing against the small of his back as they wandered out of the diner beside one another. The tiny touch would be seen by their watchers, no doubt, which was the intent.
Draco felt that was fair enough. He was usually bad at interviewing. One journalist had called him a pompous prick, while another labelled him a spoiled child. As easy as it was to discuss his plays on a field, it was painful to discuss his own everyday life. Fans were much easier to deal with.
“Roll your eyes as if you don’t know I’m right,” Draco kept his tone light, eyebrows raising in a tease.
Draco sighed, closing his eyes as he rode up the floors to his apartment. “It wouldn’t work.”
He led the way, walking through the glass door that had a neon ‘Open’ sign glowing through. A young waitress silently led them to a booth, in the middle of the diner, and they each took their seats, across from one another. She left after the menus were dropped off, eager to meet the next duo of customers that lingered by the door.
“Yes,” Harry admitted. “It’s not very good.”
“My friends all texted me to see if you were okay, today,” he said it casually, and Draco rose an eyebrow. “They care.”
Harry finally looked up at him, his eyes widening ever so slightly as he realised Draco was awake, and actually conscious of his actions. He didn’t say anything on the matter, though. The arm around Draco’s waist disappeared beneath the covers momentarily, as Harry pulled his phone from his pyjamas pants pocket, and reproduced it, returning his arm to its previous position. He unlocked his phone, scrolling through something. Draco watched him, absent-minded.
Harry let go of his hand as they walked inside, looking around. An usher herded them towards the main ballroom, where the dinner was usually held. Draco shuffled alongside Harry, still unsure what to say, or do. The ballroom was lavish, and huge, with tables everywhere. Team managers, board members, players, and their partners, all wandered around the room. Dinner wasn’t being served for a while yet, apparently, but Draco still checked the board by the door, scanning for his name. There was meant to be a sort of socialisation that went into these things, different teams mingling with each other. It meant that each table had a very random mix.
“No, I have to keep you around because you’re my fake boyfriend. Now, go and get your glasses. I’ll make dinner.”
“You’re 22 in two months!”
“Or you’re stalking me.”
“It’s nice,” Draco promised.
“What did he say?” Draco couldn’t help but ask.
Draco frowned, slightly. “I didn’t ask about them.”
“What?” She shrieked.
“God, you’re fascinating,” Draco snarked.
“We don’t have to.” Harry decided.
“Are you done what you were doing?” She asked.
“I was told we need to be more coupley,” Draco shrugged. “You always see couples holding hands.”
He perched on the corner of the couch, still looking uncertain, while Draco pulled his phone out again. Harry looked about the speak, but Draco was busy, dialling Pansy’s number. It rang through 6 times before she finally picked up, sounding already distracted. “Hello?”
“Instagram story,” Harry shrugged. He was already fiddling with his phone. “Get comfortable, Christ. It’s like sitting next to a corpse.”
“Well, not friends, but friendly, I suppose. They still chat to him on occasion. I hear he talks about me to everyone but them, though.” Harry said it flippantly.
“I’m fine,” Draco pulled on a shoe, tying his laces as quickly as possible. “I just don’t like being late.”
“He wanted to come,” Draco shrugged.
“Best pancakes in this bloody place,” Ron spoke up, shrugging.
“Doesn’t Potter have to agree first?” Draco questioned.
“Why shopping?” He asked between gulps.
“What?” Harry almost jumped. The car was on its way, according to his phone, so they were both waiting in the kitchen, Harry leaning against the counter, while Draco leaned against the one opposite.
“Boyfriend of the year,” Blaise added on to Theo’s words.
“I usually do,” Draco replied.
“Spying, probably. I would, if I were as shit as him,” Theo was also dressing, quickly, his head shaking with disbelief.
“Well,” Draco started. But he got a sudden sense of stage fright. All eyes were on him, as he looked between his friends, and Harry’s. He knew their story well enough, but he couldn’t find any words. There was an unbearably long silence as the anticipation grew. Harry squeezed his hand, easily taking over as he smiled his golden boy smile.
Draco groaned, loudly. “Okay, I’ll be there in twenty minutes!” He hung up, dropping his phone onto a shelf of his wardrobe. He ignored the yawns of Harry from his bed, rushing towards the bathroom.
! That’s what they say in books.”
The driver opened Harry’s door, and he got out, waiting for Draco. As soon as he was out of the car, camera flashes blinded Draco. He flinched, ever so slightly, his hand automatically linking with Harry’s. They both ignored the shouting questions about their relationship, making their way to the red carpet. As much as the dinner was a charity event, it was also an excuse for publicity. Minerva had sent them each an email full of celebrity couples on red carpets, telling them that they were all suitable poses to strike. So they did. Draco, with his arm around Harry’s waist, and Harry with his hand resting on Draco’s chest. They both flashed small smiles, before shuffling further towards the door.
“Oh,” Harry looked down, slightly. “I can go home.”
Draco nodded, looking down. “I have to date Harry Potter.” The words hung between them for a few seconds, the plastic toy dropping from Pansy’s left hand, and her meal getting completely forgotten.
“But you slept with him last night?”
“Oh,” Harry nodded, slowly. “You don’t have to meet my parents.”
“Because I just kicked them out on the condition that you needed the spare room, which could well be true on it’s own, but Harry is using it, so you can’t. And you’re the .. secret keeper. So, you have to lie to them for me, and when it all comes out, we’ll say you covered for us.” He rushed the words. Harry watched him, but he ignored the boy as best he could.
“No, no, thank you!” One of them stammered, the other nodding along. Their friends at the table watched the interaction, curiosity on their faces. The boys stumbled away, still looking over their shoulder to see the couple.
Ron managed to flag down a waitress, who cleared away the empty plates and then took orders for fresh coffees, and teas. Draco ordered a vanilla latte, which Harry copied, which earned a slight glance from the group.
Harry looked over, already out of his chair. Draco got up, cautiously following him. “It’s not like you’re poor, Cho. You could’ve afforded to bid a bit more. I think I’m worth more than 2 grand!”
“Did you do drama at school?” Harry’s question surprised him. They were out on the street, Soho waking up to start their days of drinking and partying.
“Oh.”
He dropped the milk into the basket, straightening up. He finally held his phone in his hand, walking towards the counter. “No, I.. We’re friends.”
“It’s boring. I read the Olympians series, and it was just… Fine. It was okay. I didn’t see it as anything special. It was simply a series of books. I finished them because I felt I had to, but they were just… Adequate.”
“Sure,” Harry nodded.
Harry rolled his eyes, moving past the shelf. “Right.” He shuffled, his pace slow as Draco followed him, his eyes still scanning the shelves. “How come you moved out so young?”
“You were much less of a dick yesterday.” Draco snapped.
someone is at my place. But usually, they’re not that interested in me.”
“You know he isn’t!” Draco huffed, tearing the nugget in half. He fed her half, taking the other for himself, laughing slightly at the joking bites she snapped at the air before he dropped the food into her mouth. She handed him a tissue, and her toy, patting his knee. “This will be awful.”
He left the contract on his kitchen counter, collapsing onto his couch. The apartment was nice, spacious, overlooking some of London. He had always dreamed of living somewhere like this, and the high wages he was on had provided the opportunity. But he had to admit, the place looked quite depressing in the afternoon light. The floor to ceiling windows that surrounded his living room let the grey light cast itself over him, and his couch, the whole place seeming depressing. “Don’t go out tonight, I beg. Look over the contract, and call me when you decide.” Minerva had taken a shaky sigh and frowned. She had given her best ‘mothering’ look, trying to appeal to him. “It’s up to you what you do, Draco. But this really seems the only way…”
The dressing room was practically empty by the time he staggered back in. The last of the lads were tying their boots, rushing to get onto the pitch. Draco threw himself onto the bench, pulling off his ankle socks, and pulling on his shin guards, football socks, and boots, which he tied as quickly, and as tightly as he could. He quickly jogged out the door, jogging towards the pitch entrance, which was cleared. His coach glared at him as he arrived, raising an eyebrow in demand of where he had been. Draco simply promised it wouldn’t happen again, and joined the team for warm-up drills.
“If Blaise and Theo ask, will you say you stayed at my place tonight?” He questioned.
“Are you fucking Harry Potter?” Theo blurted.
He looked at Draco, raising an eyebrow. “What time is it?”
He explained to himself that not only was handholding a boyfriendy thing to do, but also because the market was teeming with people, and it would be embarrassing to lose him in the crowd. “Food?”
“No, like..
“Someone’s impatient,” Draco rolled his eyes, tugging him along. “Shopping first, you can kiss me later.”
“Fine,” Draco answered shortly, eyebrows knitting. “Why have you made a cake?”
“They don’t,” Harry was by the couch, grabbing his bag which was beside it. “They snap a few pictures if I’m out, or if they
“Yeah, need to get to training,” Fred stood up, George joining him.
He got out, expecting a lift from Blaise. But Harry was standing by a sports car, one hand in his pocket, and the other clutching his phone, which he bent his head over. “God, you should give him an award.”
“Hello?” He finally answered, standing up properly. He could see his reflection in his wardrobe mirror. He looked a wreck, in just a pair of boxers with his hair a wreck, and hickeys on his collarbones. He glared at his reflection momentarily.
It was a man from the table that had been seated a few minutes ago. His friend was behind him, and their two other friends seemed to be watching from their seats. “Yes?” Harry replied, looking up.
“Yes, I did. Now don’t drink too much, don’t do drugs, and remember we have lunch on Monday afternoon.” He reminded.
“You don’t look fine,” Theo interjected.
Training passed in a blur. His coach scolded him, and his teammates shot a few curious glances. But complaints stopped when he began playing, running rings around some players. It was easy to get his head back into the game, focusing all his energy on the pitch. Theo and Blaise gave him a few looks but didn’t say anything, while other players stared at his black eye in marvel.
“I had a late-night,” he said, honestly. His friends smirked at each other in the mirror. “Can you drop me at the Tesco round the corner, actually?”
“Then go to sleep, Harry,” he murmured, closing his eyes again.
Draco had mulled it over throughout training. He still didn’t really have an answer. He knew that his friends hadn’t seen the pictures that were still rapidly spreading across Twitter, so there was no proof of friendliness between them. And he didn’t really want to volunteer that information, considering that would no doubt lead to any number of questions. He fidgeted for a second, still thinking things over. His mind was drawing a completes blank. “Not much,” was his feeble reply.
“Thank you for having me, Pansy. It was lovely to see you.” Harry grinned at her, as he stood in the doorway. He had decided he best get an early night, for his training tomorrow. Draco didn’t argue.
Twenty minutes later, Draco laid two plates at the kitchen counter, along with salt and pepper, and cutlery. He had made poached eggs, which he had managed to lay on top of a slice of bacon, which was on top of a piece of bread. He sat down on one of the stools, still nursing the coffee Harry had made him, which was cold.
“The smarmy prick,” Harry supplied.
Reluctantly, they both stood up, stretching again. As they collected their things, Draco dragged his phone out texting Harry a request to wait for his word to come up, as he didn’t want any run-ins. “Will see you at training,” Draco promised.
“You couldn’t spare five minutes to call me, and tell me about your boyfriend?” She said the word with hesitation. He winced.
Draco had met fans a thousand times before, but he never quite knew what to say to them when they appeared. He nodded, mutely, not really having any response. The other boy was off talking again, shaking his head in disbelief. “My god. Can we get a picture?”
“Another round of coffees?” Blaise questioned Draco, who nodded slowly.
“Find anything?” Draco asked, arriving back to him.
Harry snorted quietly. “You can be nice when you want to be.”
“Text me during the morning. I need to seem like my boyfriend likes me enough to want to speak to me in the mornings,” Draco requested.
Harry dropped his forehead onto his shoulder, huffing as he breathed against his arm. “You’re boring after sex.”
“Fine, I will.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Wow, he’s a saint.”
“We should go over our story, properly.” He kept his voice low, ensuring no one around them could hear. There wasn’t anyone that close to them, though. They were pretty much in the clear.
“I’m not,” lied Harry. Draco rose his eyebrows. “Fine.”
“You and Pansy are close, then?” Harry was shuffling towards the next aisle, his hand hovering over 2-minute noodles.
i love comments pls pls pls
“Fate,” Harry decided.
“Well, it was my idea.”
“Sad.” Harry snapped. “What do you want? I want to sleep more.”
“Really?” Harry seemed interested now. Draco almost laughed. He never, in a million years, expected to have this sort of conversation with Harry Potter. He obviously looked amused by it all, due to Harry’s next question. “What?”
“No.” He sounded disheartened, looking up at Draco. “You did?”
“I can leave, though.. Anytime. You say the word and I’m gone, I swear it. I don’t want to be one of those people who just.. lingers when they’re unwanted. I get that we’re
“I got you something, it’s fine,” Draco promised. “Let’s go.” His free hand found the small of Harry’s back again, guiding him towards the door again. Harry leaned into him, ever so slightly, which made the walk easier.
“Passionate sex,” Theo nodded.
“Could’ve fooled me.” Harry cut in.
“So,” Harry began, looking at him after the waiter left. He had his arms crossed and was leaning back in his chair. Draco mirrored his actions, raising his eyebrows. “What should we talk about?”
“I’ll get Blaise to drop me.” He shrugged.
“I’m fine,” he pulled Harry’s hand off his chin, tugging him by the wrist past his friends, and the watchful eyes of onlookers. He dragged Harry out of the ballroom, through the lobby, and out the front door. There were a few photographers on the pavement, waiting to snap pictures of guests. They woke up a bit when they saw Harry and Draco emerge, but they seemed to stop in their tracks at the look Harry gave them. Harry took over leading Draco down the road, his feet stumbling ever so slightly. Maybe he drank more than Draco thought.
“She said I dress like a cheap hooker,” Pansy nodded, pulling wine glasses from her cupboard. “Wine?”
“You’re mothering me,” he muttered.
Something twisted in Draco’s gut at the words, but he didn’t say anything. He simply walked out of the kitchen, deciding he needed a shower instead of thinking about Harry baking in his kitchen all day. His bed was made, and the clothes he’d dropped the night before had disappeared.
“What do you want?” Draco asked.
“Well, it taught me how much stamina he has…”
“Draco?”
The words glared up at him, along with a picture of Harry wearing the jacket Draco had bought him. He scrolled through the article, unable to stop itself.
Draco rolled his eyes, finally letting go of Harry. Pansy was eyeing Cedric from afar, a small frown on her perfectly lined lips. She seemed pained by the situation, but upon noticing Draco watching her, she smiled. “We should sit, I’m sure.”
“He’ll despise you.” Pansy agreed easily. “Are you sure you can’t tell him?”
“I didn’t come back cause Dickory was still around! But I didn’t sleep with him!” He made sure to keep his voice low, just in case anyone lurking could hear.
“Sure.”
She sighed, lightly, reaching over to hug him. “Take it easy tonight, please. You look tired.”
“Blaise thinks it too!” Draco defended.
“Oh,” Harry repeated. “So, I have to meet the parents…”
“I need sleep.” He screwed his eyes shut. There was silence for a few moments before Harry sighed quietly. Draco sighed back, cracking his eye again. “What?”
“I can be protective,” Draco murmured.
It was Theo and Blaise, their voices raised, and slight irritation in them. “We’re getting breakfast, get the fuck up. We’ll meet you at ‘Bens’, okay? Hurry up!” The line went dead.
“Cedric,” Harry said, voice tight. No one else noticed, but Draco tightened his grip on him, his fingers tapping his hip gently. He was unsure how else to be comforting. “Nice to see you.”
“Charming.” He helped himself to some of the mashed potatoes that had been placed between them.
“You have a room, I’m sure.”
“Thanks.” Harry repocketed his phone, looking bashful all of a sudden. “Sorry.”
“We’re going shopping.” Harry shrugged. Draco rose an eyebrow from behind his mug. “It’s a date.”
“On weekends, yeah. They like to see my ‘exploits’, scandalous or otherwise. They usually hide behind the bin across the road and snap whatever they can. They’ll catch you if you leave in the next twenty minutes or so.”
Harry rolled his eyes, strutting back to the stove again. “Sure, Malfoy.” Harry spent the next few minutes cooking, while Draco watched the back of his head in silence. Finally, he dished it up, sitting beside Draco, pushing a plate towards him.
“Okay.” The food arrived, and they ate in silence. It was easy to eat in silence, and with something to do, it didn’t feel uncomfortable either. Draco was hungrier than he realised, clearing his plate within a few minutes, with Harry following his lead.
Harry shuffled down the rail, going through each hanger in search for something good. Draco abandoned him, slightly, figuring he had enough hoodies. He was looking at the jackets, which all seemed to be varying in style, length, and size. He almost burst out laughing when he found a windbreaker with the Gryffindor lion on the breast of it. He tucked it under his arm, continuing his hunt. A few feet down was a Slytherin one, in a matching style. He pulled that out too, already disappearing to the counter while Harry continued his search, oblivious to Draco’s whereabouts.
“Yeah, like... We better watch out, because they’ve been training hard, and stuff.” Draco kept his voice even. He was good at lying, and always had been. Usually, he could say whatever he wanted, and if he sounded convincing enough, everyone believed him. “He probably just wanted to use scare tactics, y’know?”
“Recently?” Draco questioned, leaning back in his chair.
Harry’s shoulder shook, slightly. “We agree on something.”
“Draco,” was all Harry could say before the blonde dipped in for their lips to meet.
Draco could have slept for a year, or at least he felt like that. He was wrecked. But his, phone was ringing its shrill tone, disturbing him as he tried to catch a few more minutes. He blindly hit his hand towards his bedside table, feeling around with his eyes closed until he finally landed on his phone, which he pulled towards him. “Hello?” His voice sounded groggy and hoarse, and he hadn’t bothered to look at the caller ID, which meant the shouts from the other end shocked him.
“I think you two might be geniuses.” Minerva looked small on Harry’s laptop screen. His godfather also looked small. Harry and Draco looked tiny, though, the small box in the corner showing them sat at the kitchen counter. Lupin had been the one to call the meeting, claiming they needed to go over things, but it was safer to do on a call. Harry had agreed, and Draco had nodded along, watching him open his computer.
“Sirius. Remus’ husband.” He explained. “He thinks it’s funny.”
“Ever?” Harry questioned.
“Where are we going?” Harry questioned. He was fiddling with the sleeve of his jumper, staring at his own arm. Draco eyed him with a side glance.
“Your hair is different.” He pointed out.
“Rita Skeeter has her trolls on high alert for us,” Draco handed Harry his phone, watching the frown form on the boy's face. His cheeks were darker than usual, and his green eyes slightly widened as he scrolled through replies.
“Yeah, you do. You just pretend you don’t,” his voice was full of honesty, and his eyes seemed to look right through Draco.
“It’s satire. She took inspiration from idiots she went to school with and created the characters off of them.”
“But they’re easy to cook.”
“Of me?” Harry almost gasped.
“So, we’d be like.. Friends with benefits?” Harry questioned, eyebrows raising slightly, peaking over his glasses.
“Maybe,” Draco smirked, as a boyfriend would if he were teasing. Harry rolled his eyes, amusement playing over his features.
“They’re still friends with him? I thought they’d have taken your side in the divorce,” Draco said, honestly.
“Are you two holding hands under the fucking table?” Ron looked disgusted, yet amused. As if he were happy for his friend, yet disgusted by his choice of relationship. That was the reaction Draco expected from his own friends. But he didn’t get that.
“Oh,” he sounded again. He thought it over for a second, leaning against the counter. “Well, yeah, he is a bit of a twat, isn’t he?”
“I’ll leave some on the bed for you. Go shower,” Harry directed. Draco nodded stiffly and trudged off to do so.
“No, I’m making conversation, Potter. It’s different.”
“I feel as though I’m part of a hate crime right now,” Draco nodded.
Draco tried to keep his composure, his eyes flickering between his two friends, who both seemed desperate for an answer. Blaise had an unreadable expression, but he was leaning forward to hear. “Uhm,” Draco began, unsure of how to continue. He supposed the answer was supposed to be yes, but he couldn’t fully bring himself to say that, as he stared at them.
“Boys,” she greeted, smiling.
They’d had breakfast together the day after he’d left their sleepover, and on Saturday morning. He was cheery enough the first day, but miserable on Saturday. Draco assumed that it had something to do with seeing his ex, but he didn’t bother to clarify. He simply frowned back and sighed. “My mother wants to meet you.”
Draco laughed at that, raising an eyebrow. “Over what?”
“Your room is depressing,” Harry announced. Draco rolled his eyes, his fingertips tapping his stomach as he lay on his back. “Black curtains, black sheets, black wardrobe… Depressing.”
“So?” Draco questioned.
“I know, Malfoy, I have caller ID. I live in the twenty-first century.” There was rustling on the other end of the line, and then a sigh as Harry fixed a pillow or something. “What do you want? I was asleep.”
“Pleasure,” Draco didn’t bother with niceties. His voice sounded cold. He stopped himself from glaring, though, offering a nod.
“I have to know!” Harry demanded, his voice stronger now. “I meant to ask earlier, but I forgot. We need a proper time frame! It won’t do if we say we’ve been together four weeks, and you’ve been whoring yourself out yesterday!”
“Won’t be if you continue this cocky streak,” Draco teased back. It felt suddenly easy to joke back and forth. It almost knocked the wind out of him. He reached forward, slightly, tapping the side of Harry’s thigh. A boyfriendy thing to do. “Strange that you ended up in the same place as me.”
“Well, we’ll come to the city. Book us a table next week, and send the address,” she requested.
“I like my girls smart,” he shrugged again, throwing his arm over the back of her chair. “Angie is the smartest girl I know.”
Draco tried not to seem too offended as he rose an eyebrow. “And why not?”
They ended up on the couch after dinner, Harry flipping through movies, while Draco sat on the other side of the couch. Draco pointed out options every few minutes, while Harry ignored his suggestions. Finally, he put on Iron Man, leaning back.
Harry moved quickly, as she held her phone up. Draco tried not to cringe as Harry slipped his arm around his waist, his chin arriving on Draco’s shoulder. He could feel his breath on his neck, which almost made him shiver. He managed to stop himself, though, taking a breath as he continued to stir the food. “Smells nice,” Harry murmured.
“For football. Not for anything else, mother.”
“Unbelievable. I mean, you were late to practice for it. Must have been good,” Blaise tapped the side of his steering wheel, casting a glance across to Draco. “Tell us.”
The pictures tagged him, but not Harry. He watched the comments roll in on his cab ride home, people begging to know if Harry Potter was the second head behind Pansy, and tagging him in it. Draco liked the picture, pocketing his phone. He forgot about his afternoon activities, suddenly desperate to sleep, and forget about Pansy’s angry face.
“And Potter’s nice. I know you always ‘hated him’, but he’s a good chap.” Draco tried not to wince at the air quotes around his words. “I always thought it was strange how you couldn’t seem to leave the drama on the pitch. I mean, I’ve had beers with Weasley, yet you were so against it all. Was always quite suspicious.”
Harry ended up giving Draco a pair of plaid trousers, that was too short on him and rode up to his ankles, and a black t-shirt, that seemed too tight on his frame. Harry dressed in a pair of skinny jeans, and a white t-shirt, which looked equally fitted.
about?” Harry's voice broke through. He sounded casual as he asked, and Draco was almost startled. He had never really heard him in a setting like this.
“Yeah, that makes sense,” Draco nodded, stiffly.
“Fine,” Harry responded at the same time. The pair shared a look, both surprised at the other answers. Pansy laughed into her pasta.
“I’ll think of something,” Draco decided. “I really do need to go. Next time, Potter, I beg of you; don’t be a twat. Just text me!”
, he probably would have left you alone. And he wouldn’t have had to drag Cho into things and make a mess of everything. And you might have had an actual nice time.” Harry seemed pouty over the whole thing. Draco hated him for it. But also, he could greatly sympathise. He had a habit of blaming himself for things that weren’t his fault too.
“Don’t you have training?”
hiii pls leave comments i love them and I hope you're all enjoying it<33
“Be honest, would you have ever had a civil conversation with me if we didn’t have to pretend to be in love?”
“Yeah,” Draco confirmed, keeping his eyes on the road. They were nearing Theo’s apartment building. He lived closest.
Draco rose an eyebrow. “Do you
“Ignore him,” George began.
Draco drummed his fingers against Harry’s hand, feeling almost at ease as he ignored the conversation occurring at the table, while his other hand clutched his coffee cup. It felt almost soothing. Draco almost felt annoyed when Ron stood up, grinning at the table as he clapped his hands. “Should be going, gents.”
“What time is it?” He mumbled, running a hand down his face.
Draco frowned slightly, without meaning to. “Well, go and get them.” Now Harry frowned, looking slightly disappointed that Draco was so willing to get rid of him. It made Draco feel bad, instantly. “Go, and I’ll have dinner ready for when you come back.”
The table all made small talk as they ate the mushroom soup that had been dropped off. Draco learned that Angelina was a fashion journalist, who had a cat, and liked to travel. He also learned that Fred liked travelling just as much, but training kept that to a minimum. Pansy talked to Harry, introducing him into a conversation with Blaise, while Theo managed to wrangle the Ravenclaw and his date into a chat, while Cho listened along. Cedric seemed silent and brooding.
thank you for comments <33
Draco stared at his phone for a full five minutes before answering. He took a deep breath, trying to prepare himself, as the voice at the other end finally spoke. “Hello.”
That was how she had often ended meeting with Draco, who rose, already folding the paper into his pocket. Remus seemed to be chatting with Harry, making small talk almost, as Draco escaped the room. He knew Minerva wasn’t one for small talk when she had upcoming meetings.
“Do what?” He ducked his head.
“We’ll see.”
He felt pain before he even realised what had happened. Cedric was swearing, while he shook his hand. Someone had their hands on him, pulling him back. Draco could barely see them, as his eye throbbed. His hand flew up to feel it, blood on the side of his cheek. He rolled his eyes, best he could, more irritated than pained. “Draco! Draco!”
Their awkward trance was somewhat broken, a smirk spreading over Harry’s face as he approached.
“So, you just stayed here all day and baked a cake?” He asked.
“How am I supposed to know?” Draco huffed. He was tired of this conversation.
“Are you guys, like, really together now?” She questioned.
“It’s a children’s book.” Draco shrugged again, folding the sheet in half, and again, until it was pocket-sized. Harry watched him, still seeming confused as Draco shuffled to shove the paper in his pocket. “Have you not read a book since you were 12?”
“She’ll get over it.”
Draco rolled his eyes, pocketing his phone. He felt slightly deflated since sitting down. He hadn’t seen what his teammates had apparently seen. He was lost. His friends were smirking at him, glints in their eyes, as he rose an eyebrow. “Texting Harry, then?” Blaise teased. The name sounded foreign from them. It was all sort of real, now. “You should have brought him to breakfast. If Pansy gets to meet him, we should too!”
“Yeah,” he excused himself from his friends, padding down the hall to his room. “What’s up?”
“Breakfast.” He ignored the exasperated sigh from beside him, instead of focusing on pulling the final folded sheet of paper from his pocket, overlooking it. He slowly read the words that were scribbled on the sheet, obviously by Minerva. The story was simple but effective, and he was already halfway through memorising it as if it were a script when the car pulled up in front of his favourite breakfast spot. It was a small diner, made to seem American and vintage. “Cheers,” Draco mumbled as he pulled himself out of the car, waiting for Harry on the pavement.
“I’ll consider it,” Draco hummed, walking towards the car. Harry didn’t look up as he approached, but his teammates who shuffled out of the dressing room all seemed to watch with anticipation. “I don’t remember ordering a car service.”
He looked over at Harry, who was staring straight ahead. He seemed in a trance, almost. Draco bit his cheek, a question on the tip of his tongue, unsure of whether or not to ask it. “Before we started all this, I had to be persuaded.. But Minerva said you’d already agreed to it… Why?"
Draco woke up with a headache and a dull throb behind his eye. He blinked a few times, looking around the spare bedroom that Harry had stuck him in the night before. The curtains hadn’t been drawn, and the light almost blinded him. He twisted around a few times, digging himself further into the duvet, groaning in pain with his head. The soft knock on the door sounded like a hammer to his head.
“You have to make us all dinner, this evening. I have ideas for it.” She was already planning any number of things, as she smirked.
Draco didn’t have to think it over. “No,” he shook his head. “Probably not.”
Draco swatted Harry’s hand away from them, shaking his head. “Those are awful for you.”
Draco lazily rested his head on Harry’s shoulder, bored before it even began. Harry didn’t seem to notice, tipping back another mouthful of wine. Draco let his headrest for a few more seconds, before sitting back up and huffing into his hand.
But Harry Potter was already on his couch, a cup of coffee in his hand, and a fresh outfit on, as he watched some reality show that Pansy liked. “I made you a cup,” he gestured towards another cup on the coffee table.
“What does he say?” Draco questioned.
sound romantic.”
“Hm?” Harry sounded distracted.
“So, we’re going clothes shopping? As a date?” Draco tilted his head.
“I’ll have something, then. Do you need a hand?”
He nodded, hoisting himself up. The Flushed Away credits rolled, as he fixed his t-shirt. “Food, Potter?”
“Do you want to?”
“What do you know?” Draco found himself asking.
“The goal from Malfoy yesterday was better than any on the pitch today. Liverpool seemed asleep, and Man City wasn’t any better,” a commentator shrugged, his arms crossed. He had been a player once, years ago. Now he was someone people looked to for analytics.
“Tell them the story you concocted with Harry. I’m sure you’ve talked about this.” She sounded distracted for a second, as he finished brushing his teeth. Finally, she spoke again. “Look, it’s up to you and Harry to tell your stories, and tell them to your friends. I’m turning down press interviews, for now, so avoid answering any questions, or involving yourself in anything related. But tell your friends what you like. As long as you don’t let it slip that it’s all fake, you’re fine.”
“With?” Draco tilted his head. He stretched one of his legs out beside the table, his fingers drumming off his thighs.
His bowl of cereal was going soggy, but he didn’t bother touching it as he stared at the screen. “Quite smart, indeed,” Lupin nodded. Draco couldn’t remember his first name.
“Don’t.” Draco had woken up with a missed call from Pansy, and an irritated feeling bubbling beneath the surface. He felt as if he hadn’t slept, even though he had. His shower hadn’t woken him as he’d hoped, and his hair was still damp, and slowly drying in a wavy way that he despised. His Uber had been late, his mother had called when he was on the way, and now Harry was trying to make conversation. He wanted to scream.
“It will be what you make it, Draco.”
“Well, we’ll make sure of that,” Harry assured.
“Five minutes.”
“I’m surprised you didn’t hit him back.”
Pansy raised a teasing eyebrow. “Do the women usually enjoy that?”
“Then stay in bed, I don’t care. I have to go,” Draco huffed.
Harry stepped into the elevator, and Draco dully watched the doors begin their journey closed again. “We’re meant to get breakfast now.”
Draco leaned in, quicker than anticipated, his lips pecking the side of Harry’s cheek. “You’re disgusting.” Harry threw his head back, laughing. Draco watched, with amusement, something twisting in his stomach. He ignored it.
Harry waited for him outside the diner. He was on the phone when Draco got out of his Uber, taking no notice of his surroundings as he spoke. Draco slowly approached, finally catching the boys eye, as he continued speaking. “Look, seriously, I have a meeting. I’ll see you at training.” He pocketed his phone, raising his eyebrows in a greeting.
“Okay,” he agreed.
He kept his movements slow, still not really looking forward to putting on his terrible act of boyfriend to his enemy. Harry was still oblivious to him, as Draco snuck towards him, his fingers reaching out to grab Harry by the waist, making him jump. “Wha- Malfoy?” He turned, slightly, and Draco grinned. “Malfoy.” His voice was softer now, almost affectionate. “That was quick.”
“God, you’re adorable, aren’t you!” She pinched his cheek as a grandmother would. “This is so cute! Draco you brought your
The line went dead.
now!” Blaise declared.
“If we must.” Draco huffed. They rode the rest of the way down in silence, exiting together. No one paid them much mind as they kept their heads down. The car was waiting outside for them, the driver checking his phone, barely noticing the two boys step out of the building, and walk across the path to the car. They both slipped into the back, and the car took off.
“Well, get them,” Draco huffed.
“Sounds like you are.”
“It’s great.”
“Soothing boyfriend. Protective, almost,” Harry leaned into the touch, his hand smoothing Draco’s tie.
“It’s simple, if you know how to do it,” Draco shrugged, finishing his drink.
“I know.” Draco kept his voice low, his fingers fidgeting by his side.
“Do you need anything?”
Harry sipped the last of his coffee, while Draco began working on his second. “We’re going out after this.”
“Do what?”
Camera’s went off, flashes blinding him as paparazzi shouted his name, desperate for some sort of answer to their questions of his relationship. He ignored them all, keeping his head high as he walked past them, already spotting his Uber, which he let himself into. The driver said a quiet hello, and was on his way, speeding past the building, and away from the paparazzi.
“What?” Draco questioned.
“Do you want some?” Harry rose an eyebrow.
“Charming,” Draco responded, jointing him. He once again linked their hands, tugging him away from the table, and towards the main road.
And due to the fact, no one from his team was as obsessed with him as he was, none of them thought to check his name into Twitter. They were all none-the-wiser. It was almost a complete secret. And he didn’t mind it being like that. It was easier to train when it was a secret, and easier to think. No one even mentions Harry. He was an opposer, an issue, but not for a few weeks, at least. Their upcoming match was against Newcastle, and that was more important. The locker room chat was recollecting about the last game they’d played against them, and training was filled with jabs about the hopeful success of the Friday night game.
“Yes, Draco. Bye-bye, dear.”
Harry blew out a breath, rolling onto his side to look at Draco. “It’s okay. But this is excessive. I’m surprised you don’t have black walls.”
this thing, but we don’t have to do anything else-”
“Someone has to.”
“Surprise.” Harry kept his back to him, and Draco wasn’t interested enough to sneak a glance at what he began to make. He instead pulled his phone from his pocket, scrolling through Twitter for a few minutes.
“It’s nice,” Harry said, and Draco rose an eyebrow. The boy blushed, slightly, averting his eyes. “It’s just more natural.”
“Explains why I go for you then, doesn’t it?” Harry tilted his head. Draco frowned, and he laughed lightly. “Contacts every day, mostly. No one gets to see me in glasses.”
“Well, they do their best. Not easy to raise your best friends child,” he shrugged.
It wasn’t a huge new site. In fact, Draco barely recognised the name. But it was good enough.
“Come here often?” Draco murmured.
“I own the whole apartment, I can lie in your bed if I want.” Harry had his head buried in a pillow already, his hand wandering towards the duvet, attempting to pull some away from Draco. “I made you coffee.”
“Of course,” he rolled his eyes. He pushed off the counter. “Suppose we’ll act a bit closer, rub salt in the wound. Two-star footballers together, instead of one and an amateur.”
“What are you doing here?” Draco found himself asking, attempting to sound affectionate, rather than horribly frustrated with everything.
“We’re close,” Draco answered. “You shouldn’t eat those.”
he captioned it, tagging Harry.
“Your eye looks bad,” Harry murmured.
“And you can be tolerable.” He offered back. He nodded to the door. “I’m gonna head, though. I’ll see you tomorrow.” His bag was already waiting beside the counter for him, and he hoisted it onto his arm as Harry muttered a goodbye.
“What are you doing here?” Draco kept his voice low, walking around the corner. Behind a wall was probably better for whatever interaction they were about to have. Draco didn’t terribly mind seeing Harry if he knew it would happen, but he didn’t like being caught off guard.
“What?” Harry tilted his head, slightly, almost dazed seeming.
“Not today.” Harry shrugged. “I’m keeping you from yours, sorry.”
“Better ones than before,” Harry spoke as if it were obvious. Draco supposed it was, but he hadn’t taken enough notice, obviously. He rose an eyebrow at Draco, waiting for a response.
“We should.. take pictures.”
“Oh,” was all Draco could say, taking another bite of his breakfast.
Harry nodded back, taking the phone back. He dropped it onto his lap after a few moments, turning his attention back to the tv. Draco felt as if he should move, but he didn’t bother. He was invested in the film, surprisingly. “I’ve never seen this.” He admitted towards the end.
The car was nice and fast. Harry didn’t speak as he drove, tapping his finger off the side of the wheel, and occasionally looking out his side window. Draco felt too exhausted to even attempt small talk, so he was happy enough staring out the window as the buildings passed by.
Minerva felt very set on the matter, really. She had apparently already discussed it with his publicist, extensively. It was all set in motion unless Draco was to object. But the glare she supplied told him that he wasn’t meant to object. “Draco, your playing is good, and so is your attitude towards the game. But this party-boy attitude you have is ruining your reputation. You won’t get sponsors, you won’t get team offers. Man City could want you next season, but with the social attitude you’ve gone with, no one will want you. Even Slytherin will drop you! You need this relationship, if not to distract from the partying, but to give you some actual status. Draco Malfoy the slut won’t sell many tickets, but Draco Malfoy, who dates his rival, and seems to actually care for the game… He’ll sell tickets, and ad deals, left, right and centre. Trust me.”
Theo yawned, stretching. “Can I take your spare room?”
“Well, I’m stepping in any way. Take a walk, Dickory.” Harry was the only one to notice the clench of Cedric’s fist by his side.
“No,” Draco tried not to sound offended. “I don’t date.”
“I’ll have a word,” Draco decided. He pulled on his shorts, quickly, leaving his socks for when he returned, padding back down the hall. He knew his friends were probably looking after him, probably already raising the question as to why he had decided to go out. But he didn’t care.
“God only knows.” He ate in silence for a few minutes, finishing off the carton of fries, which he then crushed, dropping it onto his coffee table. The Roomba would clear up any crumbs or salt granules that he had dropped. “I hate him, Pans. I really fucking hate him. And now, I have to what? Make out with him in public? Take him on dates? Pretend I love him, when I don’t even fucking
Draco didn’t really have a reply, so he chugged the rest of his coffee, signalling to a passing waitress that he needed another, as he pushed his mug to the side. “Are we having breakfast again tomorrow?”
He finally spied his name, towards the end of the board. He was beside Harry, thankfully. He scanned the names for a moment, trying to recognise more. He didn’t pay much attention to the lower leagues. Cedric Diggory’s name jumped off the board, making the queasy feeling return. Fred Weasley was also on the table, with his girlfriend Angelina's name scribbled beside his. Cedric’s name simply had ‘partner’ written beside it, an unknown person bound to show up on his arm. Theo’s name was also scribbled, along with Blaise and Pansy. He always managed to bribe someone to let them sit together. Pansy usually came as all their dates. She was part of their team, kind of. The other names were unknown Ravenclaws, that Draco didn’t care about.
“You might be right,” Draco mulled it over. He took a few fries from her. “Blaise will be pissed though.”
“This is good,” Draco complimented after a few bites.
Harry’s apartment building had paparazzi outside, all ready to snap pictures of whoever walked in or out. But Harry drove past them all, easily, turning the corner of his block, and driving into an underground carpark that Draco wouldn’t have even noticed. Part of him wondered why Harry had even invited him for dinner, if not for the photo opportunity of walking into the building together. But he didn’t say anything. He simply grabbed his bag from the back and followed Harry to the lift.
“No?” He tilted his head.
“So you made a cake?”
“You’re gross,” she huffed. “Was he good?”
“What are your plans today, then?” Harry was clutching his cup of tea, looking at him. His glasses were still on, and slightly smudged. Draco felt the urge to pull them off and clean them. But he didn’t.
“I moved out at 16. Taught myself how to cook, and clean, and all the rest,” he pulled some pasta sauce off the shelf dropping it into the basket. “Pansy and I bought a cookbook, and learnt everything in it, to make sure we could be self-sufficient.”
“Why?” Theo frowned. Draco ignored them, feeling his phone buzz in his pocket.
Draco huffed, loudly, holding out his hand. Harry stared at it for a second before his mind caught up, and he fished his phone from his pocket, unlocking it. He lay it in Draco’s palm, and Draco ignored the smiling faces of Harry and his friends which appeared to be his Home Screen. He found the phone app, typing his number in quickly, and adding it as a contact. “Now you do, so you can leave.”
The taxi took a few turns, Harry twisting his hands in his lap as if he were nervous, while Draco stared out the window. Pansy had been to a lot of football events, but Draco was unsure if she’d actually met Harry. Their discussions about him had been quite short, and he had no real idea how she’d react to him landing on her doorstep. But the cab was pulling up at her apartment building, and he didn’t have time to figure out what to do if she hated him, as he pushed out of the taxi.
“Why would I do that?” Draco tilted his head.
“Lead the way,” Draco shrugged, and Harry overtook him, pulling him along. Draco didn’t duck his head as he usually did, attempting to look as though he was having fun as Harry dragged him past crowds of people. Some of them recognised them, and a lot of them looked ready to ask for photos, or autographs, or something. But Draco made sure not to properly catch anyone’s eye, looking around instead.
The plan, in Draco’s opinion, was fucking terrible. To fake date Potter, who was a complete twat to him, to create better press for both of them. As long as neither of them compared game plans for the games they were meant to actually play, they were meant to be fine. Harry would get good press by being ‘out and proud', and dating a rival, while Draco would get good press just for dating one bloke at a time, and keeping off the coke.
“Because I’m waiting for you to come to your senses, Draco!” She snapped.
“Oh,” Draco nodded.
“Indeed,” Cedric looked over their shoulder, momentarily losing interest. Draco felt like shifting from foot to foot but stopped himself. “Apologies, gentlemen. My date requires my attention.” He rose his hand, slightly, sidestepping around them. Draco rolled his eyes in his absence, while Harry turned his head to watch him leave.
Harry looked slightly surprised but nodded slowly. “Sure.”
Draco rolled his eyes, closing the door behind him. She was lying on her sofa, her back to them as she stared at the animated film. “One day,
“Just keep it up for the week. Get occasionally pictured through the week, if you can. And on Saturday, get ready together, leave together, arrive together, get pictured, and put on the best act of your lives. And keep the subtle posts, Harry. They’re great. The internet loves them.” Minerva smiled.
They ended up down a side alley, near the hotels emergency exit. Draco leaned against the wall, and Harry leaned beside him, his foot kicked behind him. He let go of Draco’s wrist and handed over the slightly dripping napkin. Draco pressed it against his eye, wincing at the pain. He closed both his eyes, tipping his head back.
Harry finished his last few mouthfuls, leaning back in his seat. The pair watched each other for a moment, their silent spell continuing until a voice dragged them out of it. “Holy shit, man. Are you Harry Potter?”
Draco stared at the wall behind Harry's head, eyes not really focused on anything. The diner had a few people milling around, but it was gradually filling up with brunch-goers. The new couple sat in silence for a few minutes, until the drinks arrived, the waitress barely giving them time to say thanks before disappearing again.
,” Harry jived.
The living space was empty, Harry nowhere in sight. If he was less tired, he probably would have attempted to snoop. He probably should be using his relationship to find out more about how Potter thinks and plays. But he didn’t bother with all that. He sat himself down by the counter and picked up the book that was lying there. He almost jumped when he realised it was his favourite book, The Secret History.
“Charming,” Harry rolled his eyes. “Food?”
“School. He used to copy my answers in maths,” she smiled.
He squirmed at the idea, almost, but nodded along with Harry. “Saturday, right?”
“Draco,” Blaise started, and Draco began mentally preparing himself for a Harry Potter related lecture. But Blaise didn’t appear to know about the fan pictures that had appeared when you typed his name into Twitter. “Did you see that fucking tosser outside?”
“I did.”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, trying to sound committed to something that probably wouldn’t happen.
“I thought the same. I just ignored them,” Blaise laughed. “It was funny though, Christ.”
“Should we ride together?” Harry sounded almost amused.
He turned it over in his hands, opening it to where the bookmark had stopped. He was over halfway through, and Draco couldn’t help but flip through. There were notes on some pages, with some lines highlighted with a pen, which Draco found next to it. He read as many as he could, slightly amused by the observations made by Harry.
“You’re disgusting,” Angelina huffed.
“And?”
“You for dessert, then?”
“Where?”
The Uber dropped him outside the building he had been in just a day before. He stepped out, and into the building, riding up the elevator until he arrived at the floor he desired. He shuffled down the hall, past the reception desk, and straight towards Minerva’s office. The contract was signed and folded in his back pocket, but he was ready to tell her he couldn’t do it. He was pushing open her office door to say he was giving up before he tried. He was standing in front of her desk ready to rip the paper to shreds. He was already speaking the words, “I’ve thought it over, and I just can’t date that smarmy prick, fake or not!”
The man finally looked up, his cheeks flashing crimson while his mouth formed an ‘O’ shape. “Fucking hell, you’re-”
“It’s fine,” he dismissed. “I’m fine.”
“Mhm. You haven’t tried to kill me yet, and I know you a lot better than before.” An ambulance passed, loud sirens blaring as it went.
“They dropped by a bit earlier,” she innocently shrugged. She lifted her coffee cup to her lips, taking a sip, as she gestured with her other hand for him to sit. He sat slowly, keeping his eyes low. He felt embarrassed by his outburst, but not embarrassed enough to apologise. “Draco, this is Remus Lupin.”
“What’s he like in bed, then?” Theo asked, smirking.
“Fine.” Draco lied, dropping his keys onto the counter, pulling his jacket off. He left it next to his keys, collapsing onto the couch. “I have training in an hour.”
“That was sherbet, for Christ sake.” He huffed, eating another mouthful.
“Fabulous.” She sighed, and then returned her cup to the coaster on her desk. She stood up, slowly, and grabbed two sheets of paper from the cupboard behind her. She handed a sheet to each of the boys and returned to her seat. “I assume you’ve both signed your contracts, and entrusted a friend each with the information. I’ll need you to each disclose the names, of course, and then we’ll move onto the sheets.”
Harry laughed, again, slightly, his shoulder nudging Draco. “How much?”
“We’re not having this discussion,” Draco decided.
“I see,” he nodded slowly. “What did you say?”
Harry stood up, fixing the shirt he had on, tilting his head. He looked small, all of a sudden. “You can kick me out if you want to, Draco. You don’t have to keep me around because we slept together.”
“He won’t. I did drama, remember Potter?” He smirked.
She looked unsure as to what to say, so she nodded, looking away. Cedric made small talk with her, which Draco couldn’t hear, and didn’t care about. He leaned his arm on the back of Harry’s chair, raising an eyebrow as he looked at him. “Okay?” He mouthed, once he had Harry’s attention.
“We need to get dressed,” Harry looked around the room.
“Well, they’re dead, so,” Draco almost flinched. The orphan part of his story had slipped his mind. “Godfather wants to meet you, though.”
“So, boys, how’s married life?” Pansy seemed amused at the subject. Harry and Draco sat across from each other, while she remained at the head of the table.
Harry looked over at him, shaking his head. “And you.”
Draco stepped out, digging around in his pocket for his house key. “Because I’m too Draco Malfoy, and he’s too-” he opened his door, taking in the sight of his kitchen. “He’s baked a cake.”
Harry was standing in front of him, one hand grabbing his chin while his other hand pushed his hand away. “Let me see!” He scolded. Draco dropped his hand by his side, flinching slightly as Harry dabbed the blood on his cheek with his pocket square. “You’re an idiot."
They ended up in a small bistro that didn’t seem to mind their casual outfits and had a free table. Harry had apparently been there before, due to their enthusiastic waiter knowing his name and his usual drink order. The menu was French and fancy, and Draco ended up ordering a chicken dish, which he’d had before, while Harry ordered steak.
Harry caught the not so subtle hint, nodding slowly. “Okay then,” he stood. “Why do they only come on weekends?”
“Well, we should see each other, right? We haven’t seen each other in a week, so it would make sense to grab some lunch or something..”
Minerva McGonagall, his publicist, was the most accepting person he knew. But she was fed up with him, of course. She was even probably right in her saying he needed a fake relationship. But he pretended she wasn’t, as he walked home, agitated with his every step. His apartment was only a short walk from her office, and he stalked home, really, trying not to fume. The idea of spending time with smug little Harry Potter was bad enough, but the idea of romantically spending time with him… Well, that was fucking disgusting. The chap had a stupid scar on his head that made him seem cool, and a great bunch of friends that were always pictured having PG fun. He spent the weekend babysitting his Godson and playing matches with his teammate, and best mate, Ron Weasley. He was apparently a great bloke to have a drink with, according to anyone who drank in his local. And he was funny, according to the girls that followed him around, and his ex’s, which included the famous model Cho Chang, and the ex-football player Cedric Diggory. Everyone seemingly loved him.
Harry brightened at that, a smirk on his face. “Jealous, were you, Malfoy?”
“Learning about what he’s like in bed isn’t the same as learning about how he plays,” she reminded.
“Well,” Draco shrugged, unable to answer. “She doesn’t like unexpected guests.”
“They say you never know until you try it.” He repeated his action, eating another fry. Draco gingerly pulled the lid off his own drink, plucking a fry from its box. He swiped the fry into his drink, eating it slowly, and frowned. “What?”
“Mhm.” Pansy nodded, turning a corner. “You’re the only person who thinks that y’know?”
“Half one,” he repeated the answer Theo had given to him.
“We said both.” Theo sounded proud about that. “It’s about time you told us.”
Blaise raised a hand, silencing the laughter over Lee Jordan’s comments on a players defence. “You know what's funnier than this?”
“Yes, it is!” Draco instantly argued.
“Couldn’t have bribed them to seat Cedric across the room?” He finally looked at him, a dejected look on his face.
“No,” Harry shook his head.
“Because you had leftover eggs,” Harry shrugged, looking at him over his shoulder. He squeezed more icing from a DIY piping bag made from a sandwich bag.
Draco leaned back against the couch cushions, staring at the screen as the analytics ended, and the news came on. He wasn’t much interested in that, as he switched between several channels, desperate for something good to appear on his screen. He was still looking when the food arrived, and he ended up handing the remote to Harry so he could actually eat, sick of his own indecisiveness.
It’s big news.” She clapped her hands on the other end of the line. “You’re good, Draco, I’ll have to admit. I’m very impressed. And Pansy’s Instagram was certainly a nice touch. I assume she came up with that one.”
“Your eye okay?” Blaise asked. Draco didn’t hear him until he repeated the question.
“They want to catch a story after the game.” Draco shrugged. “Why? When do they come to you?"
“It’s just… Fine. And really pretentious. I mean, the way they all act, and go on.. It’s awful.”
“What’s wrong with Percy Jackson?” He sounded defensive.
“You can come to dinner, but he can’t.”
“I wasn’t rudely awoken yesterday.”
“Oh, it’s not the guys giving it, if you know what I mean.” He winked, which made the table laugh, while his girlfriend lightly slapped his arm.
“Are you okay?” Harry quietly asked.
Draco nodded, slowly, thinking it over. “Well, you’ll probably know more about this than I do.”
“I’m not homophobic. I just find PDA disgusting,” Theo shrugged.
Draco realised, despairingly, that he would have to answer Blaise’s burning question on the ride home. Theo even joined, climbing into the back seat, grinning as he asked Blaise for a lift as a second thought. “Cmon, spill it. What did Potter want?”
“Perfect got it!” Pansy turned back to them, beaming. Draco frowned at her, while Harry gave her a small smile, moving back to his glass.
“There’s a charity event next week, as you both know.” Hogwarts Dinner, a yearly event that took place in a posh hotel in the city. Before Draco and Harry were even born, Slytherin and Gryffindor had been ambassadors for a large charity that donated to poverty-stricken school children. The other two London teams, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, which weren’t quite as good as the others, were also representatives. But as they played a league down, Draco knew virtually no one on the teams, apart from Harry’s ex-boyfriend, Cedric.
“It’s fine, yeah.” He nodded along.
“I need a new hoodie.” Harry shrugged.
“So, do we get the story, or what?” George was leaning closer, apparently desperate to know.
“No.” Draco took another bite of his food.
Harry smiled back, slightly, leaning into his touch. “Not too over the top, though. He’ll be able to tell.”
“Mhm. We always sit together. We have a bribe going.” He explained.
Theo gave him a similar look, both of them suddenly pitying him because of his odd demeanour. “I am,” he forced a smile, which to them didn’t seem very forced, as he took a mouthful of his coffee. “I just, I didn’t know we came across.. like that.”
When he emerged from his room, Harry was lying on the couch. He was rubbing his eye, continuously, obviously agitated. Draco ignored him, tottering towards the kitchen. “Are we ordering food, or making it?” Harry grunted in reply, not really answering. It was irritating. All he needed to do was pick one, but he was still fidgeting with his eye, ignoring the importance of Draco’s question. “Potter, pick one!”
“Dates are any sort of quality time spent together.” Harry shrugged, watching Draco. “Watching a movie, doing some shopping, getting some breakfast, going on a run, having sex. Anything.”
“Stop, that’s my cousin!” Blaise snapped.
The couple at the table next to them were talking in desperately hushed tones, waiting to hear something good. Draco couldn’t help but put on a bit of a show, after a mouthful of his drink. “What? Don’t you want them to know you’re.. What’s the term? Sleeping with the enemy?”
“I didn’t want to see
“French toast, maple syrup over it, banana and strawberry only, please. And a large cappuccino, caramel in it.” He ordered his usual.
“Ridiculous,” Draco laughed. His phone rang, thankfully, and he quickly answered it, standing up from the couch. “Hello.”
“On your mum's side? She’s fit.”
“Mhm,” Harry nodded.
Harry looked up for a moment, pity in his eyes, and a sorry look playing on his features. Draco despised being pitied. He looked away, his hand reaching for the mug beside him, which he took a large sip out of, before placing it back down. “I’m sorry.”
“Oh,” Draco sounded.
“What’d you call me?”
“This is amazing,” Harry murmured through his mouthful.
Most of the replies were from his supporters, telling her to fuck off, and that she was wrong. But there were still a lot of replies from older fans, siding with her. He always knew that there were a lot of older fans who hated him. Sure, he scored their goals, but he also scored with men. They hated that, even if they claimed not to. Being openly gay had earned him the support of many, but the hatred of just the same.
“I read!” Harry snapped. “I’ve read tons of books!”
“No, Potter.”
“Probably. Most boyfriends do that sort of thing when they’re adults..” Harry shrugged. Draco sighed, the situation making him uneasy in a way, while the boy beside him joined in. “Look, it’s not ideal. But sooner rumours spread, sooner papers pick it up, sooner we get good press, and then we can go back to hating each other. Simple.”
The waitress dropped their identical plates, and wandered off, more and more people shuffling in the door causing her to be distracted. A group of men walked past their table with her, a few seconds later, getting shown to a booth two booths away. Draco ignored them, cutting a piece of his toast in half.
“Please.” He nodded. “Do you need a hand?”
“Plenty.”
He got out of the car, shuffling into the players' entrance, following the hallway until he ended up in the dressing rooms. His teammates were already getting changed, their jerseys. He dropped his bag in front of his cubby, already pulling his jacket off, and his t-shirt along with it. Blaise walked in with Theo, both of them laughing to themselves, jointing Draco on either side, as he pulled on his jersey.
“Sleep, I’ll wake you, and you can tell me all about Potter later.” Draco was already nodding along, letting his eyes shut. She ran a hand through his hair, as she had a thousand times before, relaxing him until he was sleepy enough to doze off.
“Not yet,” Draco stacked his fridge with groceries. “Did you eat dinner?”
If he was completely honest, if Harry wasn’t such a prick, he’d probably find him attractive. He often caught a hint of red colouring his olive skin, and his full lips seemed permanently plump. His emerald eyes twinkled, and the stupid lightning bolt of a scar that staggered, and faded over his forehead, made him look unique and incredible. No one could deny that he was attractive, but his cocky prickness made Draco hesitant, as he looked at him in the street, now. “I suppose.”
“I don’t know.” Harry sighed, looking slightly deflated.
Draco nodded back, getting up slowly. “I should head home, maybe.”
“Are you propositioning me for sex?” Harry smirked slightly.
He was pretty, almost, when he slept. His cheeks were flushed, ever so slightly, and his lips looked a perfect shade of pink. His hair was messy, and his arms looked strong as they circled Draco’s waist, which he seemed to cling to. He looked peaceful and pretty, and Draco didn’t want to wake him, so he stayed as still as possible, barely breathing.
“It’s rude to talk with your mouth full.” Draco retorted, putting his piece in his mouth. It was amazing.
“Nothing to apologise for, tosser.” Harry snapped the words, a pink colour flooding his cheeks.
Harry’s apartment was similar to Draco’s, due to the openness of the space. The kitchen and living room were separated by the kitchen counter, which had a fruit bowl, and a book on it. Harry directed Draco to the spare room, down the hall, where he could change and leave his stuff, or shower. “I didn’t bring more spare clothes,” Draco muttered, trying not to sound spiteful at his slight kidnapping.
The main focus of the picture was the tv, where Tony Stark was grinning. But if you looked closer, you could see the tangled legs of the couple. It looked like something off Pinterest. “Tony Stark, I luv u<3” was the small caption, positioned just under the tv. It looked good.
“Cool.” Harry nodded, slowly, flashing another smile at Pansy. “Thanks again!”
“Debatable,” Harry sighed. “I finished it, anyway. The Secret History… It was good.”
“That would be good,” Harry nodded again, his hair flopping in his face slightly.
“That’s mad, I thought it was still impossible for humans to survive up there.” Draco rolled his eyes, huffing. “Do you not enjoy jokes in the morning, Malfoy?”
Draco frowned, shrugging. “I don’t know. I don’t go on dates, you know that.”
Harry ordered the Uber, and they ended up in the backseat of it ten minutes later, travelling to whatever restaurant Harry had chosen. Draco scrolled through his phone, surprised there was still a bit of battery left as he read through texts from Pansy asking if he was okay, emails from random companies, and a few Instagram messages. He gave Pansy a short reply, forwarded some emails to Minerva, and ignored the rest.
“I don’t know,” Harry shrugged.
“It’s a mystery.” Draco shrugged.
“Oh,” Harry frowned more. “Does she not know it’s fake?”
“Hullo?” His voice was deep, and it was suddenly apparent to Draco that it was quite early.
“Maybe,” Draco murmured into his shoulder. He traced the lines of Harry’s palm with his thumb. “If you were up there, I’d bid on you.”
“Late,” Draco responded, getting up. He collected the rubbish, walking into the kitchen. He dropped them all into the bin, returning to the living room. “The spare room is the first door on the right. There’s a bathroom beside it, and my room is next to that, but unless you’ve set the place on fire, don’t wake me.”
“How come you were late?” Blaise asked.
“They’ve both played shit all season. It’ll be 0-0, I’m calling it.” Theo decided. And he called the scores for the next game. And by 9 o’clock, they were all drunk, and laughing over the matches they had spent all day analysing.
“He brought Cho.” Draco immediately tensed up too. “My ex’s date is my fucking ex.”
Draco always liked playing the first game of the weekend, because it meant he could watch all the remaining matches in peace. Blaise and Theo usually came round to watch them, and sure enough, on Saturday morning, after their winning game the night before, they all ended up on his couch, the tv playing the next game while they drank and ate.
“Have you tried it?” Harry asked.
“Oh, I’m terrible, I know!” He dramatically shrugged.
“Why?” She sounded agitated.
Harry opened his fridge, poking around for a few seconds. “I can’t believe you think that book is better than Percy Jackson.”
“I order my shopping online. Comes once a week. Pansy forgets to buy her food, and will starve if I don’t buy it for her.” He swung the fridge shut, looking back at Harry. “Coffee?” He nodded, mechanically. “Pansy, coffee?” Draco called.
Draco didn’t say a word, walking past, and into the diner. The same waitress as before showed them to their booth, the same as the day before. She vanished as soon as they were seated, the menus dropping onto the table between them. Harry glanced at the menu again, but when a waitress returned, he ordered the same as Draco, the same as yesterday.
“I wasn’t with him,” Draco said, honestly.
“Well?” Blaise questioned, eyebrows raising.
They finished eating in silence, too busy to make more conversation. Their waiter cleared their table once they were finished, and conversation resumed. Chatter about this and that began, and they continued on through their drinks.
“God, Pansy. Stop reading those stupid fucking self-help books! You sound like a greeting card!” She burst into laughter at that, shaking her head. “I just don’t know what I’ve agreed to. This could be the biggest mistake of my life.”
“We’re going to prepare a statement,” Minerva nodded. “And release it before the weekend. But so far you’ve been on the right track.”
“Half 1!” He snapped.
“Sit,” Draco ordered. He pulled bowls from his cupboard, quickly doling out servings between the two. Harry sat at his counter, his bag dropped beside his feet.
“Yeah, I was on my way to her place when you called.”
“Well,
Eventually, he closed his eyes, hoping sleep would return. But all he could concentrate on with his eyes closed was his sore eye. So, he took to watching Harry. It was far more interesting and much less painful.
Paparazzi was the obvious choice, of course. But he apparently wasn’t in the clear, as Blaise shook his head, apparently still disbelieving. “Harry Potter,” he said, peeling his shirt off.
Draco placed Harry on one side of him, with Pansy next to him, Blaise next to her, and Theo next to her. Fred Weasley sat beside Draco, when he finally arrived, his date sitting beside him. Most of the other tables only had 10 people, but theirs had managed 12, shockingly. The Ravenclaw introduced himself to Theo, who he sat beside, with his date beside him, but Draco didn’t listen to them. He was watching Cedric saunter over, cocky in his swagger as he pulled out Cho’s chair for her, and sat beside Angelina.
“No! Last night! Why would I- What?” He exclaimed.
Harry looked back at him, eyebrows raised as Draco moved towards him. He closed the distance within seconds, his head dipping to meet Harry, whose lips fell open slightly in shock, as Draco kissed him. He had kissed people before, but he was hyper-aware of the fact that Harry was unlike the others.
“Recent enough!”
“Uhm, I’ll have the same,” Harry ordered. The waitress scribbled the orders, taking back the menus, wandering away.
“I meant the food.”
“I just know balls when I see them. Said it to Rita Skeeter. She makes most men shake with fear.” She shook the fries towards him. He gingerly took three, wondering what they’d do when they ran out. “She’ll be all over you like a fly to shit.”
“He has no one to hold hands with,” Fred continued.
“What?” Harry looked at him.
“I don’t want to have it today. That wasn’t my question, though.”
“We should meet up tomorrow, maybe? Breakfast again, perhaps?” Draco suggested.
“Draco,” her voice sounded pained. “You haven’t called for a few weeks.”
“Cmon, Harry,” George nudged him. Harry slowly lifted his head, blinking a few times as if he had been dozing. Maybe he had. Draco wasn’t sure.
He felt better in a fresh pair of clothes, and more relaxed as he towelled off his hair. This should have been how his day started, instead of falling out of bed and hopping around half-dressed as Harry watched him. But obviously, that hadn’t happened.
“I’ll do it
“We should go home.” Draco nodded, no part of him wanting to go back into that room. Harry gave him a small smile, grabbing his hand again as he pulled him back down the alley, back to the street. A few flashes went off behind them, but they ignored them, as Draco flagged a taxi.
“Yes, it’ll be a tragedy. I ordered McDonald's in your absence.” She held up a happy meal box, shaking it without looking at them. “I got you fries.”
“Ugh, he was amazing. It was sick. None of the twinks from Soho can compare, I swear,” he blabbed.
“I was just saying, maybe, you should be in charge of this whole... Act.” His voice dropped with the final word, his eyebrows raising. “You tell me what to do, I’ll do it. I’m a fast learner.”
He remained frozen for a few more moments before his feet finally got him into the cab, and he dumbly reeled off Pansy’s address. “She’s going to hate this.”
“Friends?” Harry didn’t look at him.
Finally, someone announced for people to take their seats. Pansy led their small group towards their table, Blaise and Theo on her arms still, while Harry and Draco trailed behind. Cedric was already at the table, laughing with the Ravenclaw who was standing beside it. Pansy greeted him first, flashing an easy smile. The model smile dazzled him as he kissed her cheek. She moved around him, leaving Blaise and Theo to shake hands with him, flashing smiles as well. All pleasantries. They moved away as well as if they were clearing a path for Draco and Harry to greet him.
“Apparently. But remember, no touching. No matter how good I look.” Draco took another gulp of coffee. Harry glared at him.
“No, no, just.. Any man who’s sleeping with his son..” Draco shrugged.
“Not necessarily!” He argued. He unloaded his basket, dropping it with the rest of the used ones under the counter. He also dropped a bag onto the counter, walking to the other side as the cashier began scanning his items. He clutched the phone between his ear and shoulder again. “You’re not saying anything.”
“I need food,” Draco rolled his eyes.
“Where did you two meet?” Pansy questioned, smiling at the couple.
“How was training?” Harry struck the conversation, making Draco frown.
“You just had sex with a star football player. That should be exciting enough, surely.”
“Yes, but I’ve read it. And you like it. So, let’s discuss it.” Draco shrugged again, tapping his fingers against his arm.
“Right.”
“You and Cedric ended on.. good terms, right?” He questioned.
The clothes, when he got out of the shower, were folded neatly in a pile. Boxers, still in their packaging, a pair of navy sweatpants, and an old Gryffindor t-shirt. Draco pulled them on, and towel-dried his hair for a few short minutes, before emerging from the bedroom.
“Sounded like flirting,” he persisted.
“Twat.”
“Sure.”
Harry blinked once, and then again. “You’re surprisingly good at this.”
“I don’t know,” Draco shrugged. “What do you want to talk about?”
“Even better. If the lie looks bad on purpose, they’ll buy it even less, and the secrecy of the relationship will seem more real,” Draco was basically brainstorming, and Pansy huffed.
“But interesting, too. You care for people a lot more than I thought you would.”
They hugged at his door, his reluctant friends finally leaving, a laugh still on their minds about the idea of Harry and Draco. Draco let the door shut behind them, rushing back to the living room. He gathered empty bottles, glasses, wrappers and containers, throwing some in the bin, and others in the dishwasher. He fixed the couch cushions and swept crumbs from the coffee table into his hand, which he threw down the sink. He was still rushing around, desperate to clear the mess of his friends when the knock sounded on his door.
“Tragically so.” Draco nodded.
“Very,” Draco shrugged. He finally ate a spoonful of his cereal, almost wincing at how bland it tasted.
They rode in the elevator silently, Draco relaxing into a lean against the wall as Harry kept his hands in his pockets. The elevator binged every floor they passed, deafening them both in the silence that had overcome them. Draco was uncomfortable with the last-minute plans, while Harry didn’t really seem bothered either way.
“Yes,” Draco snapped, hopping to pull his sweatpants onto his legs.
“When?” He almost shouted.
“I’d be amazed if City wins this,” Blaise announced. He had a beer bottle between his knees, as he pulled his hoodie off carefully.
“We’re not friends,” Harry rose a hand. “Say what you like about him.”
“Well, it’s a football dinner, and I’m a footballer,” he shrugged. Draco held back a surprised laugh. He lulled his head to the side, looking at him.
Harry rose an eyebrow, looking at his feet, and back at Draco. “I did,” he told him, nodding. “I thought it might be handy to have some.. things here. As a just in case, know?”
“Awful,” Draco murmured.
“Exactly!”
Harry, he realised, was silently observing too. The illogical part of his brain said that they didn’t need to join in on the conversation. But the logical part of his brain said they did, or at least they needed to speak to each other. They looked very non-couply, just sat beside one another, not speaking. He nudged his knee against Harry’s, eyebrows raising as the boy looked at him, a curious look on his face too.
The real main event of the evening was the bachelor's auction. Along with the footballers that were all socialising in the ballroom, and the people involved with football, there were also the single women whose ex’s were involved, or who had bought in out of boredom. The money they put on the table, for a chance to get a date with one of the eligible bachelors that were on offer. Draco had participated twice but was off the cards this year. So was Harry. That had been Minerva’s discreet way of confirming their relationship. People like Fred didn’t partake either, because it was known he was in a committed relationship. Just like Harry and Draco.
Theo muttered his thanks, and his goodbyes, jumping out of the car. Blaise pulled away from the pavement, driving off towards Draco’s. “Weird of him to come by though, isn’t it?”
Draco shook his head, shock wearing off. “What tosser?”
Harry nodded, and Draco did too. She uncorked the bottle, pouring generous glasses. “She won’t get a word from me again. She wrote 3 articles about me dating Hermione after I turned down her last interview, which is ridiculous.”
“You said you’d learn from me, so first lesson, prat, couples make
“Depends on the mood I’m in.”
“Okay.” Draco wandered towards the counter. Harry followed, unloading the basket as Draco pulled a bag from the rack at the counter. They both packed the bag, lazily, as the cashier scanned through each item. It occurred to Draco that it was all very domestic. He had been food shopping with Pansy once, but that was about it. His heartbeat was slightly faster at the idea before he could help it.
Eventually, Harry left the apartment, after pulling on yesterdays clothes, deeming them more appropriate. Draco watched him exit the apartment, unsure if he was meant to approach him at all. He decided against it, regretting it as the door closed behind him.
“I don’t have training today,” Harry yawned.
He brushed his teeth as quickly as possible and began pulling on the first clothes he could grab from his wardrobe. “Are you late?” Harry questioned, his voice groggy.
“Of course, yes, of course. That’s £40, please.” Draco slid him the money, watching as he slipped a jacket into each bag, which he handed across the counter to him. Draco didn’t wait for him to speak again, instead turning back to find Harry, who was still perusing.
Draco dragged the article up on his phone, unable to stop himself.
Draco knew he was right, which made him sigh, quietly. He finally nudged Harry back, letting himself relax slightly. “What are we shopping for, then?”
him?!”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Don’t get smug. You weren’t at the RSC.”
“Because Star Wars is so amazing,” Draco huffed. The fridge door shut, and Harry straightened. “What are you making?”
“Did you see our table? Would’ve been a good lineup without Dickory there,” Theo laughed. Blaise rolled his eyes, reaching across Pansy to smack him on the chest. “What?”
“After our last game, I kind of texted to apologise about the whole thing, and we just got to chatting a bit.” He said it easily, shrugging at the casual beginning to their story.
“Sure.” Harry twisted his hands a few times, and Draco bit the inside of his cheek.
“Don’t do things that warrant a scolding.” Draco cut another piece off, eating it quickly. Harry seemed to glare back at him but said nothing else. They ate in silence for a few minutes, their plates rapidly clearing. Any sign of a hangover had vanished from his mind, as he downed the last of his coffee, with his final mouthful of food.
Pansy rolled her eyes, driving the route she had memorised years before. Just outside the city, the football grounds that Draco trained and played on, stood proudly, a sign at the entrance picturing the green snake logo. Pansy pulled into the car park, tilting her head. “Need a lift home?”
Harry’s mouth fell, slightly, as he shook his head, playing along easily. “If that’s what you call it.”
Pansy was beginning a string of protests, but Draco silenced her by hanging up, pocketing his phone as he walked towards the counter, putting down the shopping bag. “Good training?” Harry questioned.
Harry dipped another fry into the milkshake, eating it as he looked at Draco, who was watching him, and not the movie. “Eating?”
“I’ll work on it, I promise.” It was their third meeting of the month. Minerva had called him in twice before to discuss his behaviour, and he was once again repeating the words he had in previous meetings. It was easier for him. He didn’t really care if he was honest.
“But they’re fun!” Harry protested. “Your taste seems stuffy.”
Draco sighed, wiping a hand over his face. He had a quick shower, rubbing his head with a towel as he called Minerva. She picked up on the second ring. “Draco Malfoy, a cover star! How are we?”
“Think of something for our next date, right?” Draco disappeared into the cab before he could get a response. He was only a street away when he got a text from an unknown number, which he quickly added to his contacts.
“Makes him bitter,” George confirmed.
“Do you want to do that now, then?” Harry enquired. Draco looked him up and down, for a split second, before nodding.
“Me?” Draco tilted his head.
“How romantic,” Fred sang.
“I liked it,” Harry defended. “It’s nice.”
“I’ll lend you some, it’s fine.”
“Stop,” Draco cut him off. “Look, I don’t do relationships, ever. Not real ones, anyway. So, if you’re looking for someone to hold your hand and kiss you goodnight when we’re alone, look somewhere else, okay?” He felt defensive now, almost as if he were too close to a flame. He watched the poker face that Harry held, desperate to see some sort of flicker of emotion, but failing. “But if you’re looking to have a quick fuck, on occasion, while publicly acting in love, we can work those things out.”
“So,” Harry blew out a breath.
He left her office with a contract and a feeling of emptiness. Draco wasn’t really interested in relationships if he was honest. Especially not fake ones. He had done well in his 2-year career for Slytherin and had no real interest in doing better. He had fans wearing his name on jerseys, and calling his name in stadiums. He didn’t really need more. He knew his father wanted him to be a Beckham or Messi sort of name, but he also knew he would never get to that level. He had been openly gay since he was 16, and that lost a lot of interest from sponsors, and his father, really. He tried not to let it bother him, but it did, of course.
He finally walked into his building, wandering towards the elevator. She sighed again, and Draco could picture her pinching the bridge of her nose. “Look, you like him. I know you like him. You know you like him. Maybe, just
Pansy appeared beside him, with Blaise and Theo following her. “What happened?”
Draco gritted his teeth for a moment, tapping the side of his leg. “I don’t want to.”
“What do you want from me?” Draco huffed too, stopping tapping his torso. “We can go out clubbing if you want. Or to the fair? Maybe fly to Disney land!”
Within two minutes, there was a location message popping up on Draco’s phone. He flagged a taxi, reeling off the address, which began to drive him towards Borough Market. The area was busy when he arrived, and he could see Harry waiting at the side of the road, his hair seeming slightly unruly as he ran a hand through it. A girl was talking to him, grinning, obviously a fan of his work. Draco got out of his taxi, slowly, trying to catch Harry’s eye without the girls attention falling towards him.
Except for Draco. They had met on the pitch, and at charity events. The man always had a hard look on his face when he met Draco, and a comment to make about his plays. “You should count to five before you strike. Maybe you’ll actually get a goal, then,” he had smirked, last time they were face to face. “Maybe you should fuck off,” Draco had replied, a glare getting shot towards the shorter man.
“Sounds homophobic,” Harry agreed.
“It is though. If you weren’t there as my
He got to cooking, slicing the chicken into thin slices and frying them. He called Pansy as he did so, but she didn’t answer this time. She was probably busy. He left it, beginning to slice a few peppers which he chucked into the pan. He had decided stir-fry was his easiest dish, while also being one of his nicest. The sweet and sour sauce he’d picked from his cupboard was his favourite. He silently hoped that Harry would like it, and hated himself for doing so.
which was surgically measured every three weeks by her hairdresser. She was dressed like she was ready to walk a catwalk, as she gave him a bright grin, her nugget gone from her mouth. “No one will know anything you tell me, I swear it.”
“Lovely.”
He finally looked at the stage, watching George Weasley bound forward, a cheeky grin on his face. Lee Jordan called out his name, enthusiastically, and paddles began rising. The most Draco made was £17,000, but George was over that after a few seconds. “Do you really have to sleep with them if they bid over 20?” Pansy questioned, twisting to look at them.
Draco pulled him forward, almost, his arm around his waist guiding Harry towards Cedric, who eyed them with an unreadable look. “Draco Malfoy with Harry Potter on his arm… an unexpected sight.” He grinned, but it felt forced to Draco.
“Where are you? We have training!” Theo demanded.
“I need my glasses,” he mumbled, pouting almost at the idea.
“Why?” He whined. He stalked the pavement, turning down the street of his building. “It was fun.”
“So, I have to think of everything?”
The booth was tiny, but George sat beside Theo and Blaise, while Ron pulled up a chair at the end of the table, leaving Harry to cram in beside Draco, next to Fred. Draco clutched at his coffee, to transport it to his small corner. “Cosy, isn’t it?” George grinned.
“Good. Speak soon.” She hung up before he could, and he was already calling Harry.
“Then we better have a good story, won’t we.” He groaned. He regretted answering without thinking it over more, but it was too late. He would have to face it.
“Hm?” Draco questioned.
“I suppose.”
date…” Draco led off, still disgusted at the idea himself. He finally stopped pacing, grabbing a few fries from the table. He shoved them into his mouth with a reckless motion, chewing them quickly, not stopping to savour the taste. He grabbed the cardboard container of them, holding them in one hand as he continued to pace.
“That you were your usual grouchy self.”
“Okay,” Draco repeated.
Theo snorted, shaking his head from the back seat. “You’re telling me Potter came all the way over for ‘not much’?”
“Utterly bizarre,” Draco agreed.
Draco stared out the window, his mind on anything else. His publicist was in front of him, shaking her head. He crossed his arms, and uncrossed them, fidgeting around. “I mean it, Mr Malfoy, this is a serious issue.” His publicist took a deep breath, shaking her head more dramatically. “The stories are getting out of control, and every time you go out, they continue.”
“He said that was a stupid question, considering millions of straight people had raised gay people too. And then he pointed out he had a girlfriend, and that people should understand what bisexuality is before berating him with what he called ‘utterly ridiculous questions’. It was impressive, really.”
“Are you proposing I kiss you?” Draco whispered.
“He’s in a meeting all afternoon, and I didn’t have Minerva’s number. And I couldn’t bloody well text another player, asking for your number when we’re meant to be
Sleep was blissful and nice. He fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow, and didn’t stir until the sun was well up, and shining outside his bedroom window. The alarm on his phone blared, set to a later time considering he had no training or matches to attend to. He pulled himself from his bed, reluctantly, getting into the shower, and pulling on a fresh pair of sweatpants, and a random t-shirt. He brushed his teeth, towel-dried his hair, sprayed his cologne, and felt ready to lie around on his couch all day, doing nothing.
“Funny?” He rose an eyebrow.
George lost interest then, diving back into a conversation about a different match that had happened a few days ago. The others instantly got involved, Ron even seeming relieved to not discuss the love life of his best friend. Harry, once again, didn’t join, yawning quietly.
“Siding with me over Cedric. Everyone else thinks he’s lonely, and I seem delusional.” He shrugged, timidly.
“Hello,” he replied, steadying his leg. He had been having a nice evening alone, reading a book, when his mother decided to phone. He could already assume what the conversation would be about, but he didn’t much want to own up to the information that easily.
“What was that about?” Blaise questioned, eyebrow quirking when they were close enough to hear one another.
Draco forced himself not to roll his eyes at the made-up sounding names of Harry’s supposed friends. Longbottom, Lovegood, and the Gryffindor defenders entire family. It was quite ridiculous. Oliver was the Gryffindor goalie, so Draco could tick him off the list of people he knew from the list, but apart from Ron and him, and Harry’s ex, Draco drew a blank on the rest. He imagined the Weasleys to look like Ron, but he tried not to think of that.
“Draco, I like you, I swear. But someday, I’ll really have to look into your contract, because it’s getting a bit ridiculous. I want you to enjoy your life, of course. But I want you to seem like a respectable young man.”
“Did you get this from my list?” Draco leaned forward.
Minerva nodded, scribbling the name down. She looked at Harry, her pen hovering. “Hermione Granger,” he supplied. Draco knew of her. She was a student, and close with him and his friend Ron. Apparently, she was studying to be a teacher, although Draco wasn’t sure. He didn’t care to know either way.
He looked away after a second, looking back at Pansy, who rose her eyebrows. She had obviously noticed his watching of Harry. He averted his eyes, instantly, trying not to let the colour rush to his cheeks.
“I asked what
“Stop moping about it,” Harry shrugged. Draco rolled his eyes back, dropping his head back onto his shoulder. He closed his eyes, almost tired, as Harry began drumming his fingers against his leg. It was almost rhythmic and strangely comforting. His hand found Harry’s, slowly twisting it to hold onto him. “I hope no one bids for Cedric.”
“No, it tastes like cardboard. I hate it.” Draco teased a pout, which made Harry roll his eyes. “Don’t do that.”
“On Saturday?!” She demanded.
“Thank you,” Draco said, graciously. Harry was nodding his thanks as well.
“Do I?” Draco sounded surprised, his face heating slightly.
“Don’t be a dick about it, Malfoy. Tell me what the stupid book is about!” Harry sounded annoyed, and Draco almost laughed but held it back.
They ate in somewhat stilted silence. Harry didn’t seem in the mood to say anything, and Draco was too tired to. It was blander than anticipated, which Draco regretted, but didn’t point out. They each stabbed at the bowls, the only sound in the kitchen being cutlery hitting glass.
“Order me anything, I’m not picky.” Draco shrugged, his eyes not leaving the screen. Harry nodded, typing more.
He scanned his phone, responding to a message from Blaise asking if he’d be at practise that evening, and then searched through his Google alerts. His name had popped up in two articles posted since yesterday. One was detailing how exciting the upcoming match between Slytherin and Liverpool would be, while another was simply his name thrown into an article about the famous people who had been recently haunting Soho.
“You will,” Harry promised. Draco walked past him, not daring to look back.
Draco glared at the tv for a few moments, before settling in to watch it. They were almost halfway through when Harry paused it, sitting up properly. “Okay, come here.”
“Why not do the whole team, then?” Theo perked.
“You were page 13 of the Sun today. Coked and Cocked, Malfoy on the Rocks.” Pansy recited, shaking her head.
“Sure.” Draco shrugged. Harry moved to pull the sheet out, but Draco quickly stopped him, raising his hand slightly. “Don’t. We get caught with that, it’s over before it’s begun.”
“Are you having something?”
“Why would I want to do that?” Harry tilted his head, his hand landing on Draco’s, which he picked up, lightly.
“So, you like him, then?” Draco sighed.
“I read a book about it last week! They called it something,” Theo clicked his fingers a few times, before nodding. “
They left the empty packaging on the coffee table, both paying attention to the movie. It was boring to Draco, but Harry laughed at random bits and frowned when the credits rolled. “I’m going to bed.”
“We’re not allowed to discuss the game.” Draco deflated at the memory.
“I told you that.” Harry leaned back on the couch.
“That. Apologise. I’m fine. I’ll survive a black eye. I won’t survive you looking at me like it’s your fault,” he sighed. He curled around the duvet more, pulling some of it closer to him as he buried his head further into his pillow. Harry curled closer too, gravitating towards the duvet which he seemed so desperate to clutch. Draco let up on it a bit, letting Harry fully get under the cover, wriggling closer to him.
“That’s Harry’s friend idiot,” Blaise snapped.
“Have you figured out how he thinks yet?” She asked.
“100%. Minnie will kill me, and whoever Harry has.” He sighed, slumping over slightly.
“Why not?” The doors opened.
Draco let them bicker, finishing off his pancakes as he half-listened to their argument. They were still snapping when his phone vibrated again. He tugged it from his pocket.
“We’re on the Sun, apparently.”
He straightened, slowly, running a hand through his hair, and adjusting his t-shirt. He was only in sweatpants, nothing exciting. If it were someone he cared about, he’d be desperate to change. But as it was only Harry, he disregarded opinion on his outfit and swung the door open again.
“We will, what else?”
him…?” She enquired.
“I suppose.” His phone pinged, alerting them that the car was downstairs, and Draco looked at him. “Ready?”
“You’re welcome.” Harry leaned in, ever so slightly. His lips brushed over Draco’s cheek, before he pulled away, opening his own door, while Draco walked around the car, opening his own. Harry stuffed the bag on the back seat, and Draco bid his friends farewell with a small wave, which they returned, as the couple slammed the doors, and Harry took off.
“I don’t know, I just know he does it. A few people avert their eyes to me when they see me coming, and I know it’s him. I don’t want to sound cocky, but he did always seem to be a bit jealous that I was on the Gryffindor team and he wasn’t. He didn’t make the cut, and I don’t know… I think he always resented me for it.” Harry looked down, slightly, as if ashamed of the words.
“I have a phone!” Harry snapped. “I just don’t have your number!”
“Mhm.”
“You want anything?” Harry broke his concentration.
“Boring.”
“I need bread, and milk,” he shrugged. He dropped some money onto the table, standing up. The couple at the table beside them was still listening intently, desperate for something. “Come shopping with me.”
“Me?” He tilted his head.
It was all very relaxing. But come half six, Pansy clapped her hands together. “I’m starved. Draco?”
“I see,” Draco mused.
The car ride was silent, Harry frowning out the window, while Draco checked his phone. He read through a few emails and scrolled through Twitter. The driver had stuck the separation glass up, and the silence between them seemed to stifle them. Draco felt slightly queasy, as they turned down many London streets. He wanted to find something to say.
“There’s two more,” Harry announced.
“Fine!” He huffed, his hand already on the door handle. “Did you post those pictures?”
Blaise was already sparking up a conversation, always the social butterfly, asking Fred and George about how their last match was. Ron was listening, along with Theo. Draco found the whole thing sort of surreal, as he watched his friends make small talk with Harry’s.
“Are you in town?” He questioned.
“I’ll see you later?” Draco asked Harry, who was letting go of his hand.
“Of course it is.” Draco replied. He felt prickly at the idea of Harry staying over when they still knew so little about each other. Harry looked around for a moment, unsure of what to do. “Sit.”
Pansy was on the tube within seconds of their call ending and knocking on his door 14 minutes later. She had a Happy Meal for herself and had brought three large fries for Draco. She sat on the couch, unboxing the Disney toy that had been included to promote some upcoming film. “Talk.” She demanded, not looking up as Draco paced across his living room, in front of the tv that was mounted on the wall over his fake fireplace. His call had simply said ‘need to see you. Urgently,’ but now he seemed to not even want her there. His fries waited on the coffee table for him, but he ignored them too. He wanted to kick something or run. But he was in the lavish living room he had spent too much money on to ruin.
He boiled noodles as he went, leaving them all on the hob as he fished for his phone. He snapped a picture of the cake left on the counter, uploading it to his Instagram story. The icing was mainly small flowers, all white in colour. Draco was entirely unaware he had any ingredients to make a cake, and he hadn’t even noticed that he owned a cake tin. Pansy had probably bought it, he figured.
It was a short kiss, Draco pulling away within a few seconds, smirking at the surprised look on Harry’s face. “Must dash. I was meant to meet Pansy an hour ago.”
“They’re in my bedroom, in my apartment,” Harry sighed now, sitting up. “I need to go and get them.”
“My team aren’t idiots,” Draco started.
“So, you went on a date.. And then slept with him,” she repeated.
She sighed on the other end, probably shaking her head. “Your father is very proud of you, you know that.”
“Hate?”
“I don’t-“ she was shaking her head again.
“Good,” Harry noted. The waiter dropped their food off, and they ate in silence for a while. “Your friends are all very nice.”
hope everyone is enjoying it :DDD
“When will he arrive?” Draco asked.
“Go on,” Blaise encouraged.
, you should give it a chance. You could find a stable relationship here! Everyone likes him, you like him! This could be great for you!”
Draco nodded back, and Harry slipped from his reach, straightening his t-shirt as he stood up. The Weasleys thanked Blaise and Theo for their hospitality of giving up half their booth, while Harry gave Draco an overly-exaggerated wink. The little shit didn’t seem tired at all. He seemed full of life, as he grinned in a boyish way, running a hand through his hair. When his friends looked back, he stifled a fake yawn, giving a shy wave as they all trudged out.
The t-shirt Draco pulled on was slightly wrinkled, and he winced as he noticed. He had no time to find another, though. He had drunk half a bottle of vodka with Pansy after they’d ordered more McDonald’s to the apartment. He still couldn’t leave, so the vodka and take away were the best he could do to distract himself from the horrible meeting he was getting ready for while hungover. Pansy was still asleep in the spare room when his alarm went off, his phone blaring a tone that he felt was unbearable and forced him out of his own bed. He shoved his feet into his shoes, glad that he didn’t have to stumble with tying the laces, and grabbed his phone from his bedside table.
“Disgusting,” Theo muttered. “I love it.”
“Good.” Draco nodded to himself, as Harry snuggled into bed more. Draco watched him, feeling more tired by the second as he slowly settled more.
“Do you like him?” She asked.
“Thank you.” Draco sighed. He wandered into her kitchen, Harry awkwardly following. He dropped the shopping bag on the counter, taking everything out of it, and loading up Pansy’s fridge.
“Why don’t you like it?” Harry questioned.
“If he was a better player, he could probably get into our league, and be on just as good a team as we are. But he’s not. I hate him.”
She rolled her eyes, patting her boyfriend's thigh. “And I like it when he buys me things. Footballers get paid a lot of money, Pansy.” Draco smirked at her joke, while Pansy almost choked on her laughter. “How did you two end up together? Fred says you two hate each other.”
I can tell one person it’s fake.” There was silence on the other end of the phone which lasted a few seconds.
Draco stopped reading, sliding his phone into his pocket. Harry Potter didn’t have these articles written about him. He was perfect. Golden child, chosen one. The names had been thrown towards him when he had just started out. He had shown no talent until suddenly he had. He had been scouted for Gryffindor at the same age as Draco had been scouted for Slytherin. It made sense that the 19-year-olds got pitted against each other. At 21, it wasn’t any better. Harry was still getting called glowing names, every goal scored boosting his standing. Draco was getting coined as a party boy, though, and it didn’t matter how many goals he scored, he was living in the shadow of the golden boy.
The pictures were already circulating on Twitter when he arrived home. Pansy was lying on his couch, a packet of crisps open on her chest, as she stared at the tv on the wall. Toddlers & Tiaras sounded in his empty living room, but the volume was immediately turned down as the door shut with a thud. “How was it?”
“Well, I’ve been busy.” He repeated his lies, shutting his book.
Draco shrugged, his fingers slowly threading through Harry’s. “Can’t get enough of me, maybe.”
“Fine. But it cannot be anyone on the team. Football players have loudmouths, Draco, and we can’t let this get out. Once it starts, it will be a secret you take to the grave. The contract assures that.” She seemed to be writing something, the sound of her pen dragging across a page. “We’ll have a meeting, tomorrow morning, okay?”
“No?”
“Harry!” Cho sounded shocked as if she didn’t know he’d be here. The look on her face confirmed that for Draco. She looked worried, and slightly pained, as she offered what was attempting to be a smile. “I didn’t know you’d be here!”
“Same,” Harry nodded.
“Night, Malfoy.”
“They seem nice,” Draco decided.
“You hate Percy Jackson,” Harry levelled.
“I was shopping,” he explained, walking back towards the door.
Draco rolled his eyes. He wasn’t really in the mood for a childish fight, even though he had started it with name-calling. Harry was watching him, on one side, while Cho stared from the other. But he couldn’t back down now. He shrugged, easily, eyebrows raising ever so slightly. “I called you Dickory because you’re acting like a real fucking
“Yeah, I’m making you dinner,” Harry shrugged back.
“Say you’re friends.” He shrugged. “Lots of your teammates are friends with opponents.”
Harry began picking things from his fridge, piling them onto the counter beside him. “Percy Jackson is
For the rest of the week, he didn’t see Harry. He went to training every day, hung out with his friends as much as possible, and kept an eye on the headlines. Minerva, who was desperate for some sort of information on the pair, called him twice to ask if he’d make plans with Harry again soon. But Draco dodged her question, ensuring he would soon, and questioning her on upcoming events that she had organised. It was easy to lounge around his apartment and attempt to push thoughts of his fake boyfriend from his mind. But exactly a week since their parting, a new headline arrived in his alerts, from a bigger name.
He took a shaky breath, continuing to pace. “I need to tell you something, but you can never tell a single living soul. Ever. Not anyone. At all. And you have to swear it to me.”
“Sure,” he reached for milk.
When they emerged to the street, a few flickers of recognition appeared on passerby’s faces. Draco ignored them, though. He removed his hand when they were around the corner, back on the main road where he could hail a taxi. “I have early training today, but here.” Draco handed over one of the bags.
“Are we going to talk in the morning?” Harry asked.
“Do you want me to sleep in the spare room…?” Harry asked.
“No.” She sighed, leaning forward. “Do you know Harry Potter?”
happy! Apparently, they managed to keep it out one paper, but another is picking it up,” Theo informed.
“My taste is intellectual.”
Draco nudged him, ever so slightly, making him look at him. Draco awkwardly offered his shoulder, smiling as kindly as he could in front of their friends. Harry leaned his head against him, as Draco took another sip of his drink. It was surprisingly comforting to have him there. Nice, almost.
Harry was dressed almost the exact same, a hoodie pulled over him as well. He stepped in, silently, immediately looking around, curious to see the play Draco lived. Draco closed the door behind him, his hands falling into his pockets as he tried to clear his head. The buzz of alcohol coursed through his head, dizzying him slightly as he followed Harry into the living room, where he was silently dropping his backpack. “Nice place.”
“Everything’s fine!” Cedric snapped, glaring over his shoulder at Harry.
,” Harry explained. Draco supposed he was right, as he leaned back against the wall.
Draco felt a stir in his chest, as he frowned. “See. Bit of a twat.”
“That makes sense,” Harry agreed. They were silent for a few minutes. The only sound was cars driving past on the road down the alley. Draco finally lifted the cloth from his eye, shaking the ice out of it. It wasn’t really doing anything. He held it in his hand, not wanting to put it in his pocket.
He fell onto the armchair he usually occupied at her place, while Harry awkwardly stood just beside the couch. Pansy finally looked up, flinching slightly with the shock of Harry. “Fuck me, you brought Potter?”
, not necessarily yours, and your hand.”
“Because you’re my
He fixed his hair in the mirror twice before finally shoving his shoes on and pulling his jacket on. He managed to send an Uber request before he stepped into the elevator, watching as it got confirmed. He stepped out of the elevator on the ground floor, step out through the doors of his apartment building, and instantly getting bombarded.
He rushed back to the living room, his mind scrambling for answers to give his friends who he was about to kick out. They both looked tired, stretched out on his couch, Theo with his legs thrown over Blaise’s lap. “I’m wrecked, guys. You wanna call it a night?”
He was draining the noodles when Harry came back, knocking on the door three times. Draco called for him to come in, which he hesitantly did, looking at Draco instantly. He had a bag over his shoulder, and his glasses falling down his nose.
“I’d hate to know who she went to school with.”
“So, are we already together?” Harry questioned.
Blaise watched him with curiosity, finally frowning. “You okay, mate? We thought you’d be happy that you didn’t have to, like, hide from us or anything anymore.”
She stared expectingly at Draco. “Pansy Parkinson.” He said, quickly.
“That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,” Theo assured.
“Can we watch them?” Draco questioned.
“Okay.” He murmured. “I’ll talk to them.”
“Charmed, I’m sure.” Remus flashed him a grin. They shook hands, quickly, Draco leaning forward to do so, and quickly leaning back.
“They’re all a bit.. Twatish, aren’t they?” He scrunched his nose.
“Post it,” Draco nodded.
“Okay…” Draco led off.
The boys pulled out their phones, opening the camera apps, their arms raising in selfie mode as they twisted to pose with the couple at the table. Draco flashed an easy smile, leaning into the picture. They straightened after they took their pictures, grinning still. “God, you guys are amazing, I hope you know.”
He didn’t wait for his shower to heat up, instead choosing to flinch at the cold water that his back, pretending it was fine. He instantly felt better as the water heated up, the tension that had been in his shoulders since that morning finally fading.
His face darkened, and he looked ready to physically shout. But Harry was already stepping in, a move ahead. “Is everything okay here?”
“No! He was.. There. And so was I. And we had nice dinner, and ended up at my place,” he tried to explain.
“Well, he wants to fix things.” She sounded hopeful, but he felt sick.
“Right, give me five minutes.” The line went dead.
“Yes?” Draco tilted his head, slightly, trying not to make it sound like a question.
“We’re not meant to discuss that,” was Draco’s reply.
“He was fucking lovely. What’s wrong with you?!” She slapped his chest.
“Open it later, and let me know if it fits.” He raised his hand further, a taxi pulling over immediately.
“A book?” Harry responded, uninterested in the topic apparently.
Harry nodded, and Draco nodded back, silence overcoming them. Draco was slightly cold, a breeze hitting his exposed legs as he was stationary, while Harry looked bundled up in his jeans and hoodie. Draco was envious, silently of course. “You can tell them I’ve come to threaten you.”
“No, I was waiting for you.”
“When you put it like that it sounds romantic.”
Draco rolled his eyes, instantly. Of course, he did. Slytherin and Gryffindor had been in competition with each other for years. The top two teams in London, constantly in a battle for the Champions League. It was between them, most of the time. And Harry, their striker, the same position as Draco, was just as good as him. Everyone on Twitter buzzed about them, and articles had been written about them thousands of times. They were set against each other almost every week in the press, no matter how they played. “Yes,” he answered.
Draco rolled his eyes again. “Shut up,” he groaned.
“Malfoy?” Draco stopped at the door, turning back. “Thank you.”
Draco watched for a second before nudging Harry. “Should we.. step in there?”
There was silence until she returned, carrying a large tray of coffees which she doled out. Draco’s was already perfect to drink, but he watched, with disgust, as Ron, who had ordered a black coffee, emptied 6 sugar packets into the cup.
His mentions were flooded with questions and desperate pleas for interactions. He read a few, appreciating the support from some, and ignoring the rude comments from others. Finally, his eyes fell upon a tweet that made his skin crawl. ‘
“If I haven’t killed you before then.”
“What?!” Draco snapped.
“Will I?” Harry tilted his head.
“I know,” Harry murmured. “I didn’t know he’d do that. I’ve never seen him so… Angry.”
They didn’t share niceties. They weren’t the type to wave at each other at events. They usually avoided each other or glared from a distance. They had had a few on pitch tackles that had gotten nasty, a few yellow cards being slapped towards them by referees. His coach had claimed him to be a ‘childish messer’ for his shouting matches that had occurred between them, while yellow cards were waved around. They were tragically typical finger pointers, jabbing their hands towards each other. Smug twat.
“Well, you don’t have to. Knowing how someone thinks, and what someone thinks are different things. If you know what his instincts are, you’ll know his next move with a ball.” She reached for a carton of Draco’s fries, shovelling a few into her mouth. “This could be career-changing if it’s not life-changing.”
“Why?”
“Why are you dipping fries in your milkshake? That’s disgusting.”
“Oh, really?” Draco asked. “I just thought they were animal jackets.”
Harry poked his head around the door, his hair a mess, and his glasses falling down his nose. Draco watched him through narrowed eyes, eyebrows raising at the timid look on the boy's face. He had two cups in his hands, steam rising from them. He placed one of the cups on the bedside table next to Draco, and circled the bed, placing the other on the opposite side, and falling onto the bed. “Hi.”
Harry awkwardly sat down, smiling back. “Lovely apartment,” he said.
“To apologise, I assume.” Draco nabbed in.
His options were slim to none. He knew he had been a bit off the rails as of recent, but he hated the idea of admitting that to Harry fucking Potter. He stared at the ceiling for a bit, milling things over. He was being stupid really. He knew he’d say yes. He would have to. He needed to. He took a breath, and dialled Minerva’s number, slipping his eyes shut.
Draco subtlety looked over his shoulder, his eyes falling upon Cedric standing over the famous model ex of Harry Potter. She looked stunning, of course, in a blue cocktail dress. She seemed to be completely unaware of Draco’s eyes on her, so he quickly turned, his eyes back on Harry. “Okay, well. That’s not ideal.”
“Is he?” Harry sounded confused. “Everyone I know likes him. Ron and Hermione still think he’s lovely.”
The restaurant was painted white, with light blue accents on the sign over the door. The waiter, who was Italian, and chatty, handed them menus, and steered them towards one of the tables on the path outside, claiming they were full indoors. They both ordered beers, and fish & chips, which the chatty waiter delighted in, disappearing inside. “So, you were impressed?”
“Text me an address, I’ll be there as soon as I can,” Draco answered.
“What time is it?” He asked.
Blaise and Theo shared a look, smirking at him. Theo raised a hand, flagging a waiter who was rushing past with a tray of champagne glasses. Blaise passed them out, leaving the tray with a single glass as the man walked away. Draco slowly snaked his hand around Harry’s waist, pulling him closer to him. Harry fell into place, easily, slotting beside Draco in a casual way as he took a sip of his drink. Draco admired him, for a second, watching the curve of his lips, and the way his Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed his mouthful of champagne.
“Could’ve been,” he shrugged. He wanted to say more, but Pansy was in front of him, wearing a slinky green dress. She had perfectly done makeup and Draco’s teammates on each arm.
“Friends who sleep together always end up in a relationship, Draco,” she was mothering him again.
“Are you using lines on me, Malfoy?” Harry questioned.
“This isn’t really your business,
Harry’s thumb swiped the side of Draco’s jaw, trying to be comforting. It almost worked. But the ice was cold, and not nearly numbing enough for the bruise that was pushing through his skin. He sucked in a breath, his eyes wandering towards the ceiling. “Let’s get some air, yeah?”
“No. I’ll book a table for three, and that’s it.”
“Good!” She sat back, eyeing the tv again. “Draco?”
“Sure,” Draco confirmed.
“I have a proposition for you, Draco,” Minerva smiled. Draco felt his heart sink, but he couldn’t move. “Harry Potter is getting his name in the papers against you, but for no other reason. His publicist, and I, have been in discussions for a while, and we think we’ve come up with a plan.”
“Oh my god?!” Her voice was high-pitched and annoying, and Draco decided he didn’t like her. “Oh my god!”
“It’s almost half 4.” Harry alerted him, not seeming bothered by the fact himself.
“Doesn’t seem fine,” Draco interjected. Cedric glared at him, his jaw clenching.
Draco posed as she requested, and she snapped a picture with her phone. She took another shot of the pan full of food that Draco was in the midst of mixing, and a picture of their three wine glasses lined up. She had a habit of taking pictures of mundane things and making them interesting to her fans. Finally, she wandered away, her phone still in hand. “Okay, Harry, stand just beside Draco, and wrap your arm around his waist, and put your chin on his shoulder. If I take the selfie from here, I can just make out
Draco felt pity, suddenly, as he shrugged as casually as he could. “He’s a prick, Potter. You don’t have to thank me for having common sense.”
“I don’t have much more time, I’ll have to get something a different day.”
“Does she not like me?” The driver pulled away from the path, fiddling with his radio. He paid no mind to the pair in the back.
Blaise and Theo shared a look, as Draco attempted to not sweat at the moments of silence. “Fucking finally,” Theo grinned, turning back.
“Have nothing else to do,” Harry shrugged back, getting up.
“I’m fine.”
“They probably did,” he sounded unsure. Draco wanted to ask more, feeling indescribably curious about the relationships that the media had classed as perfect when they found out about them. But Harry was turning towards a shop door, which he had seemingly figured was the place he wanted to shop. “Cmon.”
“We could go out.”
“I’ll see you tomorrow,” Draco sighed.
Draco walked away, down to his room, hesitating at his door. “Night, Potter.”
“Draco,” Minerva greeted. “Can you chat?”
“Mhm,” Draco sounded. “I didn’t have time to do it."
“His godfather is his publicist. Luper, or something? He’s gay too, I hear. It caused quite the stir when Potter came out. People were asking if being raised by gay men made him a gay man. I read an article about it.” She reeled off, apparently knowledgable on the subject.
They both stood, filing out of the room, the door shutting behind them. Draco sucked in a breath, not expecting to be alone with the glasses-wearing knob so soon. He gingerly reached for a pen, snatching it from the desk. He stared at the page in front of him, eyes flickering over the questions. He began filling them out, slowly, purposely ignoring the boy beside him, two feet away.
to sleep in the spare room?”
The shop was bigger inside and didn’t seem to stock clothes that weren’t second hand. Everything seemed to be vintage, and the shop was fluttering with customers who prowled the rails. Harry looked around, unsure of where to start. Draco was tugging his arm, though, pulling his sleeve towards a rack full of hoodies with varying patterns. “This what you’re looking for?”
“As I’ll ever be,” Harry murmured.
"Thanks." Draco picked it up, already on his way to the kitchen. He took a sip, raising his eyebrows in amusement. There was a hint of syrup in it, which he had obviously found in the cupboard. He placed the mug on the counter, getting to work on pulling food from his fridge. “You want breakfast before your big shoot?”
“You think of things, and I’ll show up and look pretty. Maybe kiss you along the way.” Draco crossed his arms, leaning them on the counter.
Draco probably could have slept till dinner, but his phone ringing stirred him from his rest. He flinched at the initial noise, his hand shooting out to grab it from his bedside table. It wasn’t there though. It was in the pocket of his trousers, across the room. Harry was beginning to stir from his side, but Draco couldn’t wait for him to fully wake up before he pulled his arm away from him, almost tripping up as he flew towards his phone.
“Yes, dear?” He looked back at her.
“No,” he rolled his eyes.
“Oh yeah?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow to no one. “Did you not have plans today?”
“You’ve been in relationships before,” Draco shrugged, his hands slipping into his pockets. “I haven’t.” Harry's eyes widened, but Draco was already stepping off the pavement. “I’ll see you tomorrow, lover.” The name sounded cold on his tongue, and he didn’t wait for a response.
“And you know Mr Potter.” Minerva sounded strained as she said it.
Theo and Blaise stared at Draco, waiting for him to say something, as he looked between his ‘boyfriend’ and his friends. “Uhm, would you like to sit?”
He had already ordered an Uber by the time the elevator dinged, and he stepped into it. He leaned against the back wall, ignoring the paper burning in his pocket, and pressed the ground floor button beside him. As the doors were shutting, the footsteps sounded, and just as the gap tightened, a hand-cut in, the sensors reopening them fully.
“Because he’s bought into your propaganda.” Pansy shot a glare across the car at him, shaking her head. “I’m sure you have your reasons, but everyone else loves him. I saw Cho just the other day, and she said he sent her a bouquet of flowers for her recent cover shoot, just as a congratulation.”
“Feels it.”
“Do you have more recommendations?” He questioned.
“Then sleep in the spare room,” he snapped, finally. Harry let out a quiet chuckle, shaking his head. “I need to sleep.”
Draco sighed to himself. His eye hurt, and now he had everyone's eyes on him. He felt sick. “Nothing, I’m fine.”
“You too,” Cedric nodded. “And Draco, lovely to see you too.”
comments are appreciated <33
Harry was dropped.
“Training, I suppose.”
“I’ve been!” Draco snapped.
He remained silent until the car pulled up outside the hotel. He finally looked over at Harry, raising an eyebrow. “Ready?”
“So, how long do you have to fake date him?” She questioned, looking back at her meal.
