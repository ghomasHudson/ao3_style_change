Draco was watching too and when he looked up at Harry, he gave him a filthy grin. He leaned down and bit and sucked on Harry’s collarbone. There would definitely be marks and bruises when they were done. They wouldn’t stand out as much on him as they would on say, Draco. It was the idea of marking up Draco and the twist of his wrist that sent Harry over the edge with a shout. Harry closed his eyes and tried to catch his breath. He felt Draco’s uneven breathing against his collarbone.
“Fuck, Potter, you can’t just say things like that.” Draco panted and it was Harry’s turn to smirk. He pushed Draco’s shirt up but didn’t pull it up over his head. Harry trailed kisses and bites down his chest and abdomen. “Harry Potter, I swear on every god I know that if you don’t touch me right this second, I will die and then I will kill you.”
“Something you want to say, Ron?” Harry tried to keep his voice even and calm. He didn’t want a full-blown row with his best friend this morning. It had started out so well.
“Potter, what are you on about?” Malfoy jumped up to sit on one of the desks in the room. His tone wasn’t mocking, like Harry had expected. He sounded genuinely confused. And maybe a tad concerned.
“They aren’t quite so foolish as all that.” There was a beat of silence. “Oh, all right. Not anymore. Harry became a lot more careful after... Well, he learned to be a bit more cautious.”
“Why would he do that? Voldemort is dead, his father is in prison. What does giving me a love potion get him, exactly?”
“You would have been absolute rubbish.” Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s cheek and laughed when he was batted away with little enthusiasm. “We really must get up if you want breakfast.”
“Oh bollocks...” Harry ran a hand through his hair. “Nobody’s looking for me, are they?” Malfoy turned back to look at him.
“So, when I say it’s hard to believe that people care about me, it’s not for nothing. I spent eleven years thinking that I wasn’t loveable. I was conditioned to believe that I wasn’t loved or worthy of love. And I did believe it. Sometimes I still do. When Molly makes me a sweater for Christmas. When Hermione tries to get me to be more cautious. When Sirius wanted to spend time with me. When you’re here with me instead of anywhere else.”
“Apparently her and Molly had a mother conversation with a single look the other day. They both agree that you are in desperate need of a mother.”
“Still.” Draco pressed closer to him. “I rather enjoy not having to actively hate you. It’s quite a relief.”
“No, Hermione. I wouldn’t want to make anyone uncomfortable.” He pulled away from her. “I’m not hungry anyway.” Harry stalked out of the hall and through the front doors. He needed some fresh air. He walked to the tree where the Marauders had sat after their OWLs all those years ago. Christ but he missed them all. Well, maybe not all of them.
But she had never been further from his mind. Instead all he could feel was heat. The once cold stone floor now burned under him. And when Draco gently pressed his tongue into his mouth, the fire engulfed him entirely. Draco moved and braced himself over Harry, his hands on either side of his head. Harry was on the floor of Snape’s old classroom and he was snogging Draco Malfoy. He could never complain that his life was boring.
What truly surprised Harry was how comfortable it felt. He had always thought of Draco as cold. But he was so warm. And the press of his side against Harry had calmed him. He didn’t want to leave. He wanted to stay here with Draco for as long as was humanly possible. So until someone noticed that Harry was missing. And managed to find him.
“I can’t...I can’t look them in the eye. Fred is dead because of me. Tonks and Lupin. Oh Merlin...Teddy. His parents are dead cuz of me.” Harry stopped trying to control his hysteria. He didn’t have the energy. And some small part of him would rather fall apart in front of Malfoy than in front of his friends. They had their own grief. They didn’t need his. Malfoy was going to take the mickey out of him for it later but he could take it.
“I dunno. Maybe it wouldn’t have mattered.” Harry shook his head. “Certainly it wouldn’t have changed much. I still would have had to die.”
“No, but you were right before. If we don’t make an appearance there’ll be hell to pay later.” He cast a quick cleaning charm over them. Harry forced himself to sit up and then get off the bed. If he stayed lying next to Draco much longer, they would never get up. Since there was no point in being modest anymore, Harry simply pushed his bottoms down and kicked them off.
Harry had wasted months, MONTHS, wandering aimlessly around England. With no real idea of where he was going or what he was doing. He had dragged Ron and Hermione along with him because it turned out he was a selfish git along with everything else. Ron had been right to leave. He could see that now. The anger and frustration hadn’t been with Ron. It had been about Harry. And the horcrux. And really, Ron and Hermione had spent months not with one horcrux around their necks, dragging them down, but with two. They deserved medals.
Distantly, he wondered where all the Slytherins were. Had they stayed in their common room? Had some ventured out to join the fray? Were they all huddled together in the Great Hall? Were they mourning for friends or family? Both sides had suffered significant casualties. Not just today. Harry certainly wasn’t about to begrudge their mourning. Regardless of who it was. Sirius had once told him that the world was not divided into good and evil. But never had it been more evident than today.
“I died.” The laughter was finally subsiding. But now he had to choke back sobs. “I was dead. I died. Alone. Only ghosts to keep me company.” Harry finally looked up at Malfoy who was much closer now. “I died.”
“I suppose you and I had the same idea.” Malfoy shrugged and brushed past Harry into the classroom. The only light was the dim glow of the torches in the hall.
“It was abuse, Harry. What they did to you. It was abuse.” His voice was firm even as his touch was gentle as he cupped Harry’s face in his hands. “I need you to understand that. You were abused and you did not deserve it. You did nothing wrong.”
“Why is Charlie arguing?” Both Draco and Hermione stared at him for a moment. “Oh. Right. Hermione, did I tell you that I talked with Dumbledore’s portrait a few nights ago?”
“Of course, you can! I just said it! We’re identical, you dense prat!” George was laughing and soon Harry was too. Their laughter faded and George sighed. “After Sirius, when did it stop hurting?” Harry grimaced.
“Of course I mean it!” Harry growled in frustration. “Look, I accept your apology and I appreciate it. But I promise you that Draco hasn’t bewitched me with potions or spells or anything like that.”
“Sorry, mate. Maybe tomorrow.” Charlie clapped him on the shoulder and stood up. He gave his sister a grin as they passed.
“I’ll tell you later.” Harry muttered. For a moment, he imagined that this must be what it felt like to introduce a new partner to your family. And again, he desperately wished that his parents and Sirius could be here. He tried to picture the look on his godfather’s face when Harry told him that he was dating Draco Malfoy. It was a shame he would never get to see that face. It was pretty funny in his head.
“And that’s not what Malfoy wants? Hermione told me what you did for him and his mum the other day. You think it didn’t occur to him that if you were head over heels for him, maybe he’d escape a life sentence in Azkaban? Which, by the way, is what he deserves.”
Harry let himself be held and cried into Draco’s shoulder. His chest ached but the gentle touch of hands on his back helped to ease it a little. He didn’t know how long they sat there on the bed while he cried. But when he finally calmed down, his eyes burned and his throat hurt. Draco eased him back onto the bed and pulled him in close. Harry rested his head on Draco’s chest and sighed.
“Good. That’s good, Harry. Keep doing that.” Malfoy squeezed his shoulders again and Harry sucked in a breath when he did. Truth be told, it wasn’t hard. He had spent an entire year obsessed with Malfoy. He had watched him and followed him and scoured the Marauder's Map to find him. Now that Malfoy asked him to be attuned to his very breathing, that was simple.
“Oh! Harry, dear, I forgot! You received an owl this afternoon.” Molly pulled an envelope out and handed it to him. He didn’t recognize the handwriting. Draco shared a glance with him and Harry shrugged. He opened the envelope and pulled the parchment out. His eyes scanned over it and he had to read it twice before he fully comprehended it’s meaning.
“If we want.” Draco brought him closer. “I think expecting two eighteen-year-old boys fresh out of a war to maintain a long-distance relationship is asking a bit much.”
“If you want me to get out of this bed, you’ve got to stop looking at me like that.” Harry shoved him gently and Draco fell back against the bed.
“I didn’t have a room until I was eleven. I used to sleep and play and eat and live in the cupboard under the stairs.” Harry closed his eyes. He really wished people would stop making such a big deal about it all. “Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and my cousin Dudley all hated me. The nicest thing any of them ever said to me was this past summer when Dudley told me that I wasn’t a waste of space.”
“I’m glad you get it but it isn’t fine. None of this is fine, darling.” Draco pushed his hair back from his forehead again and tightened his grip. “But you are right about one thing. What’s done is done. And it cannot be undone.”
“Harry?” Draco’s voice came through the door. It creaked open and then closed again. “Are you all right?”
“I always knew you would be the death of me, Draco Malfoy.” Harry closed his eyes and tilted his head back, allowing Draco better access to his neck. Draco smirked against his skin as his hands slipped under his shirt. The two of them had seemed to come to some sort of nonverbal understanding that touching and kissing was fine but they weren’t going to have sex. Well...sex in the conventional sense of the word. Harry thought that they were a bit young still. Even though Draco was coming up on his eighteenth birthday and Harry not far behind. Their age didn’t seem to be what Draco was hung up on. But as they hadn’t actually talked about it, Harry didn’t know what was.
“I’m saying that I don’t feel the need to burden all of you!” Harry jumped up and walked over to the edge of the lake. A gentle summer breeze blew across the grounds and rustled the leaves in the tree. It was the only sound between them for a few moments.
“Draco Malfoy. I died and came back from the dead and defeated the darkest wizard in a century. And that was just today. I think you and I can manage to stay friends after we walk out of this classroom.”
“I never had any concept of what love was like. Familial or otherwise. I saw how Aunt Petunia treated Dudley. When I was little, I tried to get them to love me. At about five, I stopped bothering. For a long time, I wondered why. What had I done wrong? Why didn’t they love me? But then I just got pissed. And started pushing back instead. Uncle Vernon hated it. He hated when I talked back. And he told me to never ask questions. That drove him crazy.
“I think you might be.” Ginny grinned. They fell into a companionable silence. “It’s just not the same between us anymore, is it?”
To think he had woken up this morning with Draco. And had his first hand job. And given his first hand job. They should have just stayed in that bed. Harry would have strong words with Draco about that whole waking him up and forcing him out of bed thing later. For now, he would just enjoy the peace and quiet of the grounds. And let Draco have time with his mother.
“To breathe, Harry.” Draco pulled back and jerked his head to get his hair out of his eyes. “I always knew that you would be the death of me.” Harry opened his mouth to respond but Draco cut him off. He reached up and ran his fingers through blond hair. Draco huffed into the kiss and Harry knew he hated to have his hair mussed. But he would risk it. It seemed that one thing had not changed. Harry had always been willing to risk life and limb for Draco. For one reason or another. And Draco could always drive Harry insane.
“I can hear you, you know.” Harry finally decided to interject in their conversation. He blinked open his eyes and found that his head was pillowed in Draco’s lap under the tree. Hermione sat beside them with a book propped up on her knees.
“Off.” Draco pushed Harry’s shirt up and he lifted his back off the mattress to aid in its removal. It wasn’t until Draco was staring down at Harry that it occurred to him. He hadn’t seen the new scar. Draco hesitantly reached out and traced a finger over the still pink flesh. “Does it hurt?”
“If that’s all right with you, Mrs. Weasley.” He accepted the plate from her with a nod. Of course, Draco would know just how to behave.
“Well, clearly you’re going to decline.” Hermione leaned forward to look at Draco, as if she wanted to know he agreed and would back her up.
“Potter. Harry!” Malfoy shouted. And it pulled Harry back enough to focus on the other person in the room. “You’re hyperventilating. And I need you to stop. You need to copy me. Can you do that? Copy my breathing.” Malfoy kneeled in front of him. He had his hands on Harry’s shoulders and was squeezing hard enough to hurt. “You need to breathe, Harry. After everything that we’ve been through, I am not going to be accused of killing the Chosen One hours after he defeated the greatest dark wizard in a century. Breathe, you fucking idiot.”
“No, it wasn’t.” Draco turned Harry to face him. “You know what it’s going to be like for us here. Mother has no desire to go back to that house. And I can’t say that I do either. And, for once, this has nothing to do with you.”
“Can’t.” Harry managed to choke out. Malfoy turned to give Harry his full attention now. Damn. He shouldn’t have said that. “I should – I meant to –” Breathe. “Thank you. For your help. Back at the Manor.”
“I’ll let you know.” George sighed but nodded, like he knew that would be the answer. “It does get easier. You can start to remember them without immediately being sad. The sadness is still there but it’s...less sharp. I still miss him every day but I can think about him and laugh instead of crying, you know?”
“He is offering Harry to start immediately.” Percy clarified. “Rather than return to Hogwarts to complete his NEWTs, he recommends that Harry start his training immediately and study for his NEWTs there.”
“Okay. I’m sorry. I’m being stupid. Go eat with your mum. Tell her I said hi.” Harry gave him a smile and turned to the Weasleys. Hermione was the only one who seemed to see the exchange.
“Not really. It was just like Sirius said. Like falling asleep.” Harry wrapped his arms around his knees. He wished Sirius were here to offer him more words of comfort.
“Yeah, George, didn’t you know? Malfoy’s nickname is the Giant Squid.” Charlie winked at Harry and George choked on his potatoes.
“That’s it?” Harry jerked up and stared at her. Ginny laughed and tossed her hair back. “Harry, no offense, but I could have told you that. You wanna know a secret?”
“Just needed an adult to talk to.” Harry shrugged. “He told me that Sirius was gay. And in a relationship with Remus. And Dumbledore was gay.”
“Well, what better way to change the system than from the inside?” Hermione grinned. “Are you still going to be an Auror?”
“If you say so.” Ron shrugged. “You really think that nobody would go through the trouble of drugging you just to have you?”
“I am thin because that is how I’m supposed to look. I’ve always been slender.” Draco rolled off the bed and undressed as well. “You, on the other hand, look unhealthy.”
“Because Hermione is.” Harry grinned at his best friend. Ron turned red and went back to his breakfast.
“Fine. Will you at least send a damn Patronus so nobody thinks that I’ve abducted you.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest. “You send a Patronus and I’ll take you to an actual bed. And not to shag, oh Chosen One. You’d fall asleep halfway through.”
“Of course, dear. You take all the time you need.” Molly patted his hand before she pulled away. He could practically feel Draco and Hermione share a look over his head.
And, on top of everything, Harry had died. He had died. He had walked into the Forbidden Forest with certainty that he would die. Sure, he had walked into the forest a number of times before and had always worried that he wouldn’t walk back out. But this time, he had known. And he hadn’t walked back out had he? Hagrid had carried him back out. He had been sure, just a couple hours ago, that the only thing that had truly died out there had been that piece of Voldemort that had clung to him. Now...maybe a piece of Harry had died too.
“I had only just been told that the darkest wizard in a century, the one that killed my parents, had been in Slytherin. And that every dark wizard had come out of Slytherin.” Harry sighed. “But they were wrong about that. Peter Pettigrew had been in Gryffindor.”
“Of course. After that I plan to get involved with the Ministry. I’ve always wanted to be a force for good in the world. And I think the Ministry could use some changes.”
Draco surged up and caught his lips in a kiss. Harry smirked against his lips. He wasn’t the only one easily riled up. He had learned fairly quickly that Draco absolutely loved to be complimented. And it was so easy to compliment him. He still had no idea what he was even doing but it felt good. And he didn’t want it to stop.
“Harry!” Hermione waved when she saw them. Harry returned the wave and started walking over. Draco let him go.
“Gorgeous. You’re usually so put together and everything. I like your hair all mussed up and your cheeks are a little pink from the pillow.” Harry got up on one hand to lean over him. “You look beautiful.”
“It’s from Kinglsey.” Harry passed the parchment to him without another word and stared down at his food. Draco made a strange sound in the back of his throat before the letter passed under Harry to Hermione. After a moment, she scoffed and tossed the letter on the table.
It was the first time anyone had uttered the word “abuse” in regards to the Dursleys. Harry had always known. He had never thought it or acknowledged it but he had known. But just as he had feared, hearing it made it so much more real. And nobody had bothered to tell him that there was nothing wrong with him. Draco’s words at once tore him to pieces while bringing him back together.
Harry didn’t know why, but something about what Draco said hit him like a physical blow. He started shaking and the tears were becoming more difficult to hold back. Draco stroked his cheeks with his thumbs. It wasn’t until he smeared a tear across his cheek that Harry realized he was crying.
“I’m sure that Kingsley thought this out, Molly.” Arthur rested a hand on her shoulder. “He wouldn’t just make the offer willy-nilly. He must think that Harry is ready.” They all looked to Harry and he wanted to sink into the floor.
Harry fell through the door of the Room of Requirement and slammed it shut behind him. His heart was pounding from running to the seventh floor and the adrenaline from his fight with Ron. He almost felt dizzy as his blood pumped through his veins too fast. He stumbled over to the bed and collapsed on it, breathing heavily. Sometimes when he fantasized about having a normal family, he rather forgot that huge blow out fights were almost as normal as warm and cozy dinners together.
“I expect some letters from my new found friend during my stay in Azkaban.” Malfoy pulled his hand away.
“Wow. Well, all right. Good then.” Harry relaxed and hadn’t realized that he had been tense. Hermione really was such a good friend. “And Ron?”
“Aren’t you? You’re going all the way to France.” Harry felt Draco tense behind him. “I’m sorry. That wasn’t fair.”
“I get so sensitive about the treatment of house elves cuz that’s basically how they treated me. Like a servant. They would lock me in the cupboard if I did anything weird. I had to sneak out in the middle of the night to steal scraps of food so they wouldn’t notice things were missing. Dudley and his friends were always beating me up. And they made sure I never had any friends.
“You know...” Draco broke the silence and Harry opened his eyes. “I rather liked being the center of your attention last year.”
“Thanks.” His voice cracked and he was determined not to cry. He was done crying about the bloody Dursleys. Draco pulled back to look at him.
“Don’t let Ron get to you. I think he’s just...shocked. And he doesn’t know what to think. You know how he can get. I seem to remember the two of you had quite the row before the first task in the Triwizard Tournament.”
“Potter?” Malfoy sounded far away now. Maybe he had decided to find his own abandoned classroom. Harry had been here first after all. “Really, now, come off it. You’re acting ridiculous.” Was he laughing? Or crying? He couldn’t tell and he didn’t really care. “What in the bloody hell is so funny, Potter?”
“What is he declining?” Percy asked and held a hand out for the letter. Hermione gave Harry a questioning look. He just shrugged and she handed the letter to Percy. George leaned over to read it as well. He whistled quietly.
“Well, you certainly seem fine. Far be it for me to think otherwise.” They sat in silence for several minutes. During which, Harry realized he was half off the bed and his glasses were pressing uncomfortably into his face. He sighed and rolled over onto his back and scooted until his whole body was on the bed.
“Oh, good.” Harry sighed heavily. That was just what he needed. More people telling him to eat all the time. Draco rolled his eyes and pulled him into the Great Hall. He had managed to sleep through lunch somehow. He must have been more tired than he thought. Draco walked right over to the old Gryffindor table and directed Harry to sit beside Hermione and he dropped into the seat next to Harry.
“What the bloody hell you were doing.” Harry laughed. “It was driving me crazy. And everyone else crazy. Ron and Hermione nearly had me committed.”
“He really will come around, Harry.” Hermione gave him a smile. “As it is, he, Ginny, and Charlie are having quite the shouting match in the Common Room.”
“You already are a force for good. You were rather instrumental in the defeat of the Dark Lord. Harry may have finished the job but he wouldn’t have made it without you. Without you, he and Weasley would have just stumbled blindly to their deaths. Or run headfirst into it.”
“Yeah, it is. You didn’t get the notice? I could have sworn we posted a notice.” Harry snorted and Ginny gave him a smirk. “So...” She sat down next to him. “You wanna tell me what’s going on with you?”
“He is a rather upstanding young man.” The voice sounded amused and then Harry registered fingers in his hair.
“Angry with you?” Draco frowned and stepped closer to Harry. He took his hand again. “No, Harry, I’m not angry with you. I’m worried and curious and confused but not angry.”
“What was that look about?” Harry looked up at his pillow and Draco glanced down at him. He tilted his head slightly to the side as he contemplated how to answer.
“--Weasley going to get over himself?” The voice was muffled but was definitely coming from somewhere above him.
“Sure.” Harry shrugged. This time he squeezed Draco’s hand before he let it go. He and Ron walked out of the Great Hall and Ron stopped at the stairs. He sat down on the third step up. Harry stayed standing. He crossed his arms. “What?”
“That’s rich coming from you, Draco.” He pulled on his jeans and a fresh shirt. Kreacher had likely brought some clothes for them.
Draco was an excellent partner to have on the first day of potions. As he and Harry worked on the simple potion Snape had assigned, Draco (thankfully) took the lead because he knew Harry was clueless. He let Harry help with the simple things, like cutting, or stirring when Draco’s arm got tired, but that was about it. Besides that, he did his best to explain everything in great detail, so Harry was learning while he observed. Everytime Snape came over, Harry just knew he was dying to find something to criticize him on, but he couldn’t because Draco’s potion was perfect.
“Y-you stay with Ron to distract the troll, I’ll get her out of here,” Draco said. He used Ron’s brief distraction to scurry past the troll. Whatever he said to her, Harry didn’t catch on account of focusing back on the great big monster. But he could tell it wasn’t working, as Hermione stayed plastered against the wall.
They inched together, so close that Harry could smell whatever fancy shampoo Draco used, and did the best they could to shrink into the shadows. It emerged into a patch of moonlight, it was a horrible sight: twelve feet tall, its skin a dull granite gray, its great bulky body like a boulder, with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks, with flat horny feet. It held a large wooden club, which dragged along the floor with a grating scraping sound.
“I think Transfiguration is interesting, Charms as well. But I’m most excited for this class. I’ve been playing with toy cauldron sets ever since I was little, so I hope I’ll be good.”
“Why does Snape hate me so much? I’ve never even met him before,” Harry complained as class let out.
"She might not have needed saving if you guys hadn't locked the thing in with her." They reached the stairs, pausing before they had to go their separate ways. "I'll see you guys tomorrow morning. Tell Hermione I said thanks for covering for us. Goodnight."
"That...wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Hagrid was really nice; but he's a God awful baker," Draco admitted to them.
“Oi, pee brain!” Ron said, running to another part of the chamber and throwing a metal pipe at it again. It didn’t even appear to feel the pipe hit it’s shoulder, but it heard the yell. It paused once more, turning its ugly snout towards Ron instead. Without its attention directly on them, Draco blinked a couple times and snapped out of whatever stupor he’d been in.
Harry wound up with Seamus Finnigan, which wasn’t horrible, they got along well enough and he doubted Seamus would catch anything on fire. Ron on the other hand was trapped with queen stuck-up-know-it-all herself: Hermione Granger. Neither of them looked happy about the arrangement.
"Are you seriously eating candy for breakfast Ron?" Draco paused right before biting into his toast, watching in dismay as Ron popped a gummy owl into his mouth.
Flushed with their victory, they ran back to Draco with proud grins. “Did you see that!” Ron exclaimed. “We just saved the school!”
“Now don’t forget the nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing,” Professor Flitwick squeaked right before he let them do their first official tries. “Swish and flick, remember swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important too! Never forget Wizard Baruffio who said “s” instead of “f” and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest!”
“Hey Draco, Ron and I are going to see Hagrid. I was wondering if you’d like to come.” Harry didn’t know why he felt nervous asking this. Maybe it was the fear of rejection.
“So,” Harry said as he got comfortable next to Draco. “How have you liked the classes so far? Any favorites?”
“I mean, yeah, he’s a Slytherin isn’t he? But I’m telling you Harry, I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to go making friends with a Malfoy.”
“I've never even touched a cauldron before. Do you have any tips?" Draco nodded eagerly, like he was just itching to prove how much he knew.
“Well in that case,” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the four of them. “Hermione you foolish little girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” She hung her head low. “Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this. I’m very disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt, you better go to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their towers.”
Ron glanced at the time and his eyes widened. "But I'll do it when classes are over. We have to be in Charms in eight minutes!" That was enough to incite panic. He, Ron, and the other first year Gryffindors who'd lost track of time all scrambled for their things and hurried to get to class.
Madam Pomfrey hovering over him every two seconds, fading in and out of sleep, the most exciting feast of the entire year, and the return of their marks, falling asleep in a near empty dormitory felt surreal. Like he knew in the morning he would be losing a part of him.
"A break in at Gringotts on July thirty first?" Draco said aloud after reading the paper alongside Harry. "Wasn't that the day we were both in Diagon Alley?"
"I don't think so. The three of us have got on so far, so I figured I'd invite them along. Is that alright?"
“You’re on a roll today Ron,” Harry said. Ron pretended he hadn’t heard him. After that, they didn’t see Hermione in class for the rest of the day, which was highly unusual for the girl.
“Hermione Granger is in the girls bathroom, has been all day, so she doesn’t know about the troll. We came to warn her and bring her back to our common room. You should get back to your house before they notice you’re missing,” Ron explained.
Most of Harry’s classes were fine. All except for History of Magic, which was so boring Harry found himself falling asleep within the first five minutes. As they learned their schedules, along with the twisting, ever changing corridors of Hogwarts, Harry hadn’t seen much of Draco since the feast. Sometimes they shared a friendly wave if they managed to catch each other during breakfast, but Draco was usually two bites away from finishing his breakfast by the time Harry got there, leaving no time to converse.
Someone bumped into Harry as they hurried past: it was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face, startled to see her in tears.
"Here," Hermione said, passing him a plate. "Get some sausage before Ron eats it all." Ron sighed and drank his juice.
At the end of the day at the Halloween feast, Harry’s curiosity of her whereabouts was satisfied when he overheard Pavardi Patil talking to Lavender Brown about the situation. “Hermione’s been crying in the girls bathroom since Charms, doesn’t want to be bothered. Poor girl.”
“Potter, Weasley, back to your house now!” The Slytherin Prefect ordered again, this time much more forcefully. But the Slytherin dormitories were in the dungeons, was all Harry could think. He wondered if Percy would notice if they slipped Draco into the large crowd of Gryffindors to keep him safe. However, this was something they couldn’t argue.
“Yeah, it’s just that those two oafs have been behaving like total imbeciles ever since the train. I have to sit all the way over here so they’ll leave me alone.” He nodded towards Crabbe and Goyle, who were toying with a golden scale. They were bound to break it soon, Harry thought.
“Come on.” He wrapped his arm Draco’s shoulder and guided him along. “Hagrid is one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet, you’ll see.” So the three of them walked together to the hut on the edge of a forest. And even though Draco was anxious the entire way there, Harry felt good about steering him in the right direction.
“Yeah, according to some of the older kids in Slytherin, Snape’s always nasty to everyone.” As Draco said this, Harry remembered what he’d been meaning to ask.
He was cut off when Snape swept into the dungeon, casting a shadow over the students as he took his place at the front of the room. He was just as hook-nosed and greasy as he had been on the first night.
The club lifted up from beside Harry, and Ron guided it through the air until it hovered above the troll’s head. In one sudden movement, he lowered his wand, and with a loud crack the club smacked against the troll’s skull. It swayed back and forth, then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room tremble.
With a bruised ego and singed eyebrows, Ron and Harry left Charms defeated. In a sour mood, Ron began complaining to Harry the moment they left the classroom.
They all sat around a table in the center of the room‐--their heads were barely above the table top. Hagrid hummed to himself as he meandered in his kitchen. With Hagrid busy, there was no one to keep hold of Fang. The dog took an immediate liking to Ron, licking his face despite his adamant protests. Fang wasn't so feriousious after all, Harry decided. Draco must have felt otherwise, because once Fang moved on from Ron and began to sniff at Harry and Draco, he tensed up like a statue.
"It will be fine. It's just tea," Harry whispered. But then, something inside the Hut started barking uncontrollably, and Draco just about jumped out of his socks. Hagrid scolded his dog, who Harry heard him call Fang, and when the mutt was quiet Hagrid finally opened the door.
“Saved the school you said?” They ignored Draco, and without saying it recognized what they had to do, despite it being the last thing Harry wanted. This time, they were the ones dragging Draco down the hall. They arrived back at the bathroom and Harry could feel Draco trembling in his boots. Ron fumbled with the key in a panic before swinging the door open.
“Do them.” Harry moaned. It turned out that Voldemort did have a secret weapon he could have used against Harry. Why bother with torture and threats when Tom Riddle could have brought Harry to his knees with a single kiss from Draco Malfoy. Probably for the best the thought had never occurred to him.
“Sure, Malfoy. I owe you one.” Harry looked across the room at Malfoy. He was still perched on top of the desk. He had pulled one foot up on the desk and was resting his chin on top of his knee. If anyone else had done it, it might have looked ridiculous. As it was, Malfoy almost looked regal. The insufferable git.
“I dunno. I was going to try for it since I figured if I was going to try and kill Voldemort, I may as well do some training. But, now that it’s over I dunno.”
“I appreciate the offer, Draco. But I think just your support will be enough.” Hermione gave him a bright smile. “I should head back up to the castle. It wouldn’t do for Molly to have to mourn Ron as well. I’m sure Ginny and Charlie have shouted some sense into him by now. I’ll see you two at dinner?” She stood and brushed debris off of her jeans.
Distantly, he could hear someone talking. It was Malfoy. What the hell did he even want? Why was he still here? Harry would have asked except when he opened his mouth to speak, all he could do was take a gasping breath. It was hard to tell in the dim light of the room but he could see spots threatening to take over his vision. He wasn’t getting enough oxygen. Because he couldn’t breathe.
“God, you’re so gorgeous.” Harry tried to commit the image to memory. He wrapped his hand around Draco’s cock and marveled at the sound he made. Draco jerked his hips in an aborted movement, a moan torn from his throat. Harry did his best to recreate what Draco had done to him. And of course he had taken himself in hand before. So at least he had some idea of what he was doing. It was different from this angle but still.
“And, it may not mean anything now, but I will do anything in my now very limited power I can do to help you. A lot of Father’s connection weren’t necessarily interested in the Dark Lord coming to power. Most of them were merely hedging their bets.” Draco sneered and Harry couldn’t help but grin at him.
“I died!” Harry was aware that this was probably not the right response. But that knowledge was far away, distant. And he couldn’t stop laughing. “They all spent 16 years trying to keep me alive so I could die when they wanted! That’s...come on! That’s hilarious.”
“But that’s wonderful news!” Molly looked around at them all bewildered. “Isn’t that what you wanted to do after school, Harry?”
“Yeah. Fine.” Harry sat down beside her, putting space between him and Ron. Harry hadn’t told either of his friends much about his relationship with Draco. Hermione had surmised and didn’t seem to mind too much while Ron, well. Ron seemed to suspect that something was going on. And he definitely did not seem to be okay with it. He hadn’t said anything to Harry directly of course. But whenever Draco was around, Ron ignored both of them.
“Come off it.” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “We all know you didn’t actually die. You must have given a spectacular performance, Potter. To convince the Dark Lord you were dead.” Harry huffed out a laugh.
“Fine. ‘M fine.” Ron stared down at his plate. Charlie rolled his eyes and turned back to his discussion with Percy. It sounded like they were talking about politics and if there was anything Harry could not understand, it was that.
“Not to mention the way parents would react to a gay man teaching their children. Even with Muggles, that could get a teacher sacked.” Hermione got that determined look on her face. “That is at the top of my list of things to tackle in the Ministry.”
“Ah, yes. My master plan. Weasley saw right through me all along.” Draco spoke flatly and rolled his eyes. “I sincerely hope you didn’t believe a single word of that.”
“No. I mean, not really.” Harry shrugged and did his best to avoid Draco’s gaze. Until Draco gently took his chin and tilted his head to look at him.
“There‘s no need to be concerned about that. I don’t even know where they are. And I don’t ever have to see them again. A fact that I’m sure we are all grateful for. I’d very much like to just forget about it.”
“You...called me Harry.” Good. That was a genius thing to say. He suppressed the urge to groan and hit his head against the wall behind him.
“I had my fair share of panic attacks last year. Blaise dealt with them when he was younger so he was able to help me.”
“So you think he’s using me?” Harry stepped back and took a deep breath. “You think that Draco is just pretending to give a shite about me so that I’ll try to keep him out of prison? Have I got that right?”
“Well he’s not! You’re not ready, Harry, dear.” Molly reached across the table and took his hand. “You need time to recover from the war. We all do. To suggest that you should throw yourself back into danger like this is unconscionable.”
“There’s still time.” Draco sighed. “I almost wish that you had figured it out. Might have saved us both some trouble.”
“Fuck off, Ron.” Harry pushed passed him to climb further into the castle and get the fuck out of there. He rushed up the stairs, taking them two at a time. His mind was racing and he couldn’t make it stop. Away. He just had to get away. His feet carried him without his mind having to give them any direction.
“When you were wanking me off, I was thinking of doing this. Marking up your neck and knowing I was the one who did it.” Draco moaned.
“You should. Paris, Venice, Athens, Tokyo. A lot more to the world than London and Hogwarts.” Harry tried to stifle another yawn. “We really should get you to bed.”
“No. We have time.” Harry closed his eyes and sighed. “Maybe I’ll travel. Never been out of the country. Or really anywhere interesting.”
“It isn’t as bad as it sounds. Especially if you find something that you genuinely enjoy doing.” Hermione was talking to Draco. Harry wasn’t sure if he was dreaming or not.
“All evidence points to the contrary, darling.” Draco smirked against his lips and brought them together once more. “Come on. Let’s get you up to dinner. I don’t think you’ve eaten anything today.”
“When I tell you about what it felt like to live with the Dark Lord and how he used the threat of Greyback against us all, am I burdening you?”
“I’m pretty open-minded.” Harry smirked and briefly wondered if they were still joking. He wasn’t sure.
“Never been very good at those.” Harry yawned and Draco tugged on his arm to bring him closer. Harry obliged and tucked himself into his side. “I thought I would be an Auror but after everything...I dunno. I think I’ve had enough of dark wizards.”
“Mum is going to kill Kingsley next time we see him.” George sounded like he couldn’t wait to see his mum shouting at an Auror.
“As much as I hate to admit it, you rather helped there too.” Harry shrugged. “It was incredibly stupid but Fiendfyre is one of the few things that can destroy a horcrux.”
“I’m not sure I would have been able to handle being his friend before now. The stress would have been unbelievable. Constantly worrying about him dying.”
“Draco...” Harry repeated, determined to ignore the comment. “What do you say...we start over?” Malfoy turned to look at him. He tilted his head to the side and then held out his hand.
But on the floor of his old Potions Master’s classroom with his old rival pressed against his side, nothing was expected of him. Draco had already seen him break down. And he had never really expected or wanted to see the big hero. He may even be relieved to find that Harry hated that part of himself more than Draco did. It was a relief. Here, he could just be Harry. Not the Boy Who Lived or the Chosen One or whatever. And Draco could just be Draco. He didn’t have to be a Death Eater or the dutiful son to a pureblood family.
“Hang on. I think Ron has something he’d like to say. Don’t you, Ron?” Hermione turned to stare at him and Ron sighed.
“I’m just worried about you!” Ron jumped up. “It’s Malfoy! It was barely a year ago you two tried to kill each other in a bloody loo! And now your best mates and snogging and holding hands! You’ve got to admit it’s weird.”
And the other problem with family was that they usually knew exactly how to press one's buttons. Ron likely hadn’t even done it on purpose. Maybe he had but Ron wasn’t cruel. A git sometimes, yeah. But not cruel. Still, he had harped on one of Harry’s biggest fears. Nobody really cared about him. They only cared about what Harry could do for them. That fear had only gotten worse after seeing Snape's memories.
“I don’t know about all that.” Draco laid a hand on his arm. “But just because I’ll be on the continent doesn’t mean I can’t be here for you. And Hermione is here for you.”
“I do love when you curse, darling.” Draco was breathless and his hair was hanging down around them. His cheeks were tinged pink and his lips were red. It was, without a doubt, the hottest thing Harry had ever seen. “I’ll make a proper Slytherin out of you yet.”
“I don’t know if I can do anything for him. He was already put in Azkaban once and broke out. Or was broken out. I could try to help.”
“Yes, but what do we want?” Draco almost sounded frightened. Like a lost boy. And really, weren’t they both? Harry reached out and took his hand. Their fingers intertwined and Harry squeezed.
“’Course. ‘M fine.” Harry didn’t bother to lift himself off the bed. The mattress dipped and then Draco was running his fingers through his hair.
“Now that you’ve got me, what will you do with me?” Draco stared up at him, his pupils blown wide and his chest heaving.
They stayed like that for a while. Harry didn’t know how long. It felt like hours. But it could have been a few minutes. His breathing evened out until he and Malfoy were breathing together without any effort on Harry’s part. In and out. In and out. He felt almost calm.
Harry Potter groaned sleepily when he felt cool air on his skin. He groped blindly for the blankets to try and pull them back on. His hands came up empty, only feeling the warm space beside him. A gentle, quiet laugh reached his ears and he groaned again. It was too early for this. He rolled onto his other side and pulled the pillow up over his head. He was warm and comfortable and still tired.
“Well you certainly haven’t helped.” Draco gave him a leering smirk and Harry grabbed the pillow and hit his target this time. In the week since they had started this ritual of falling asleep together in the Room of Requirement, they hadn’t done anything more exciting than furiously making out and rubbing up against each other. And that was probably for the best. What with everything else going on.
Up in the Great Hall, surrounded by friends and family, he would have to be the strong and brave hero. For some, they would expect the Chosen One. An almost mythological hero. For others, they would expect strength and comfort. They would expect leadership. Upstairs, in the Great Hall, in the real world, things were expected of him.
“And Hermione deserved quite the apology. From myself and on behalf of my entire family.” Draco grimaced slightly and Hermione reached out to touch his arm gently.
“And don’t worry about Ron. He’s just being a prat.” She grinned. “Just wait until he finds out that I’m bi too. He’s gonna lose it.”
“I imagine that is what everyone will expect of you.” Draco tightened his grip on Harry as if that bothered him as much as it bothered Harry. “I suppose we don’t need to figure it all out right now.”
“Merlin, I hate to say it, but Molly is right.” Harry raised an eyebrow. “You are too skinny.” He rolled his eyes.
“Oh, darling, all you had to do was ask.” Draco started stroking his cock and Harry moaned. They had definitely not done this yet. And Harry was more than happy to add it to their list of things that were okay. Somehow Draco’s hand felt infinitely better than his own. Draco’s hand was smooth and cool and slender. Harry tilted his head to watch Draco’s hand on his cock and he almost came right then. It wasn’t fair how hot it was. Draco’s pale hand moving against Harry’s darker skin.
And the more he sobbed, the more he couldn’t breathe. This was why he had ducked out of the Great Hall. This was why he had wanted to be alone. Harry had spent so long being the brave, stalwart Chosen One. It had only been a matter of time before he cracked. And he could feel it. He had cracked and now the pieces fell around him. Like the castle itself had only hours before.
“Yeah. I know what you mean. Like, how dare we be happy when...” Harry trailed off but George brightened a bit.
“I’ve been on the run for the last year. Food was hard to come by.” Harry shrugged. “It was harder on Ron and Hermione. They’re used to three square meals a day.”
“Well, then, please enlighten me because I don’t know what you mean.” Draco stood behind him now. “Is...Ron being a burden to you when he talks about the loss of his brother? Is George? Does Hermione burden you when she tells you about what my aunt did to her?”
“In the dungeons?” Malfoy raised his eyebrow higher. Harry struggled to his feet and turned to face him.
“It isn’t like we have classes or anything. There is nothing we need to do outside of this room.” Harry grinned. “Or even this bed.”
“Don’t be a tease, Harry.” Draco leaned down and kissed him again. Now that they had started, it was as though they couldn’t stop. And he wasn’t complaining. Harry chased Draco’s mouth as he pulled away.
“A few hours.” Hermione closed her book and set it aside. “We thought it was best to let you get some rest.”
“So the only people who are allowed to give a shite about me is your family? Everyone else has ulterior motives?”
“...You think we can still make breakfast?” Harry looked over at him. Draco huffed out a laugh. He rolled his head to look at Harry.
“Why in Merlin’s name would you be in Azkaban?” Harry almost laughed at the idea. Draco Malfoy and Azkaban did not go together. Malfoy raised an eyebrow and pulled back the sleeve on his left arm. The Dark Mark was visible even in the low light.
“How very kind of him.” Draco was still petting his hair but there was a strain in his voice. Harry opened his eyes to look at him.
“But we are needy, aren’t we?” Draco raised an eyebrow. He still had a smug smirk on his face and Harry would exact his revenge. As soon as Draco made him come.
“Harry...” He felt a hand on his shoulder and it took a moment for him to realize it was Malfoy. “Come on. I’m taking you to the hospital wing. Find Granger and Weasley.”
“Stroked something enough.” Harry couldn’t see his face but he could hear the teasing smirk hidden in those words.
“What are you suggestable to, Mr. Potter?” Draco raised an eyebrow and for the first time, Harry allowed himself to acknowledge that Draco was rather attractive. His face was a bit gaunter than it had been at the start of Year 6 but there was light in his eyes. His eyes sparkled with mirth and a little mischief. And Harry thought that if he had just taken Draco’s hand seven years ago, they would have put Snape and McGonagall in early graves. He tried to ignore the stab of regret. Both at the lost years of their youth and at Snape.
“You wanted to know about the Muggles.” Draco simply nodded. “For the first thirteen years of my life, I was never told I was loved. I was never shown I was loved. I was shown fear and hatred. My own family kept me in a cupboard. I think it was easier for them to pretend I wasn’t there.” Harry took a deep breath.
Harry gave a startled shout when the door behind him opened and he fell out into the hallway. It was too bright compared to the total darkness of the classroom. He blinked against the torchlight and looked up to glare at whoever had interrupted his well-earned reprieve. Just when he had thought this day couldn’t get worse. Draco Malfoy was stood over him, an eyebrow raised as he looked down at Harry sprawled on the stone floor.
“Same to you.” Harry sighed. “You know, it’s funny. I always thought it was Slytherin and Death Eaters that were so prejudiced. And, I mean, Death Eaters, definitely are. But the rest of us were just as prejudiced against Slytherin. We wasted seven years hating each other because we thought we were supposed to.”
Alone, on the cold stone floor of the dungeon classroom, shrouded in the darkness, the events of the day finally crashed into him. Lavender, Colin, Snape, Fred, Tonks, Lupin. Who even knew how many others. Harry buried his head in his hands and pulled at his hair as a sob escaped him. He had failed them. Failed everyone. He should have been smarter and faster and better. He should have done more. Eventually, they had prevailed. But at what cost?
“Ginny and I broke up after sixth year. You know that. We haven’t really had a chance to talk about things. But that’s between me and Ginny.” Ron scoffed. “What bothers you more, mate, that it’s Malfoy or...or that it’s a bloke?”
“I can try. Your mum never took the Dark Mark and you were underage at the time. And only took the Mark under threat of death to yourself and your family. That’s gotta count for something.”
“You can’t lie around in bed all day.” Draco pushed his hair back, the smirk fading into a fond smile. “Much as I would like to keep you here.”
Harry watched his hand on Draco’s cock. He watched the ripple of muscles in his thighs and abdomen as he jerked his hips. Draco was biting his bottom lip, making it even more red than it had been earlier. Harry reached up with his other hand and tweaked one of Draco’s nipples. He groaned and tossed his head back. Encouraged by the response, Harry leaned down and sucked on the hard nub. Draco tangled his fingers in his hair and pulled, jerking Harry’s head up to kiss him messily. Harry’s own cock twitched in interest at the move but Draco was coming with a low moan. Harry pulled away and rolled to his side.
“About you.” Harry bristled and started to sit up again. Draco gently pushed him back down. “Oh, stop. People who care about you are allowed to be concerned. In fact, it’s our jobs to be concerned for you.”
“Funny. I was gonna ask you the same thing.” They were both a bit breathless. Something about that, about being responsible for rendering Draco Malfoy breathless, made their position suddenly very uncomfortable. Or rather too uncomfortable. That depended on how one looked at the situation. “Why’d you stop?”
“Don’t you get it?” Harry could feel tears run down his cheeks again. He teetered on the edge of hysterical laughter and sobbing. “I was the last horcrux! The one he never intended to make.” He couldn’t resist quoting Dumbledore. “And they knew! Dumbledore knew for...years. And Snape! He died so that I would know I had to die!”
“My help?” Malfoy frowned. “Ah. Right. Well, don’t fall all over yourself about it, Potter. I couldn’t be sure it was you, after all.” He brushed dirt and ashes off of his robes. “And after the unfortunate incident in the Room of Requirement, I think we should consider us even.”
“And what exactly are you concerned about?” Harry crossed his arms over his chest but the move was significantly reduced due to the fact that he was in Draco’s lap.
“I think they can all spare a moment to help the Chosen One.” Malfoy tried to pull him up but Harry pushed his hand away.
“Draco!” The sound was an embarrassing combination of arousal and surprise. Draco rested his forehead against Harry’s and stroked him once. “Fuck...”
“Well my father is going to Azkaban and nowhere else. My mother and I may be joining him. I am going to cross that bridge when I get to it.”
“Draco...” Harry whined and felt Draco chuckle against his skin. Draco leaned them back until Harry was laying on the mattress again.
“Yep.” Harry snuggled closer to Draco. “I did spend an awful lot of time in bed thinking about you.” He turned his head in an attempt to see Draco’s face.
“Merlin, you are so fucking beautiful.” Draco leaned down and kissed him. That wasn’t quite the response Harry had been expecting but who was he to argue. Harry was thoroughly distracted by Draco’s mouth that he didn’t notice what his hand was doing until he felt cool fingers wrap around his straining cock.
He slid slowly down the length of the classroom door. For the first time in what felt like years, Harry was finally, blissfully alone. He choked out a laugh at the thought. How many years had he spent huddled in his cupboard, desperately wishing that he wasn’t alone? And now, the silence and darkness felt like an old friend. It welcomed him with open arms and it didn’t expect anything from him.
“What did you mean, your cupboard?” Draco wasn’t looking at him, instead focusing on the Black Lake. Harry heaved a sigh.
“Ron just needs some time.” A second voice, off to his side somewhere. “Honestly, I think he’s just upset that Harry and Ginny didn’t get back together. He hates the idea of anyone dating her but I guess he figured he could trust Harry.”
“You need to get dressed if we have any hope of showing our faces at breakfast.” Harry pulled back and went to try and tidy his unruly hair. As usual it was a lost cause but it gave him an excuse to put distance between him and Draco. He hated talking about the Dursleys. Hermione had tried time and again to get him to talk to them about his home life. But being away from them, all Harry wanted to do was pretend that his family didn’t exist. Harry knew perfectly well what Hermione, Ron, Draco, Molly, any of them would say. But hearing it would make it true. Hearing it would make it real. One trauma at a time.
“There’s a reason I was never a Chaser.” Harry grumbled into the mattress and immediately wished he still had his pillow.
“I’ve got you, darling. You’re safe here with me. You are safe. And you are loved. And I will never let anyone hurt you like that again.” He tightened his grip on Harry. “You’ve been through too much.”
“Potter? What the bloody hell are you doing down here?” Harry waited for the usual irritation to surface whenever Malfoy spoke. But it didn’t come. Distantly, he wondered if his existential crisis and grief was taking up too much of him. And then realized that he still had tears running down his cheeks.
“Yeah.” Ron looked around the table before finally looking at Harry. And then Draco. “Can we talk in private?”
“How has it worked for you so far?” Harry scowled but said nothing. “As I thought.” Draco sighed and paused in his petting of Harry’s hair. “I always thought that the way you were treated at school was the same way you were treated at home. It never occurred to me that Dumbledore would put you in an environment like that.”
“I agree about not shagging on the floor. It’s pretty uncomfortable. And Snape’s old classroom is not where I imagined having my first shag.” Harry sighed. “But I think they owe me some peace and quiet.”
“Yeah, I guess that’s true.” Harry sighed. “Even you, Draco, darling?” He tried his best Pansy Parkinson impression. Draco stared down at him and Harry tried to keep a straight face but it was a lost cause. They both started laughing. And didn’t stop for several minutes. When they finally managed to get a grip, they had sprawled out together on the floor of the classroom.
“Of course he is.” Draco stated and they both nodded once. Harry was starting to wish he had never brought those two together.
“Thank you.” Draco nudged Harry’s shoulder. “Would you eat something please?” He hissed the last part under his breath but Harry saw the look on Molly’s face that said she had heard him.
“Bellatrix was a monster.” She pulled her hand back. “Besides, I will wear this scar with pride.” Hermione brushed her hair back.
“I don’t know.” Draco sighed. “A few years at least. I am going to try and get into the Healer program over there.”
“You should see the other guy.” Harry replied and took some sausage and toast. George laughed, Hermione smiled and shook her head, and Ron made a sort of choked noise in the back of his throat. Charlie smacked him on the back.
There was a quiet shock that ran through the Weasleys at Draco so casually joining their family for dinner. Harry was surprised himself that he willingly sat at what had always been the Gryffindor table. Ginny and Charlie shared a knowing look. George and Percy both looked rather floored. Ron and Arthur had dark looks on their faces. Molly and Hermione were the only two that seemed perfectly fine with this new arrangement.
“Did I?” Draco’s smirk grew. “That doesn’t sound like me.” He leaned down to bite Harry’s earlobe and Harry groaned. “No, that sounds a bit more like you, dear. Virtuous Gryffindor...” His mouth trailed across Harry’s jaw to his other earlobe. “And me being a cunning and rather less virtuous Slytherin would never suggest such a heinous crime as to get out of this bed.” Harry gasped and bucked his hips up.
“Well...I am the Chosen One.” Harry grinned and Malfoy rolled his eyes. “And I owe you one. And your mum one.”
“You know, where the family member or best friend tells the prospective partner that if they ever hurt you then we’ll kill them sort of thing?”
“That's what mothers do, isn't it? My mum died to protect me. Your mum lied to protect you. Think she would have dueled Voldemort herself if she had to.” He rubbed his arms to bring some warmth back into them. He could still see his own mother giving him a reassuring smile.
“Kreacher will save me something.” He attempted to burrow back into the blankets only for them to be pulled away. “Draco!” Harry finally opened his eyes and sat up to glare at his companion. Draco only smirked.
“Because I always put too much on people. Ron and Hermione have been putting up with it for seven years. I risked their lives time and again and I thanked them by pushing them away and yelling at them.”
“I wanted to say sorry about earlier.” Ron rubbed the back of his neck. “I was being a prat, I have been reliably informed.”
“It said I had a thirst to prove myself. And that I was capable of greatness and Slytherin would help me to achieve greatness.”
“Not really. Truth be told, I think I was a bit shite. If it hadn't been for your mother, I never would have made it out.”
“Exactly! How can I be happy or excited or anything when he isn’t here anymore? I know that Fred...he’d want me to be happy. To be okay and move on. He’d tell me to stop being such a morose git and get over it.” Harry laughed.
This entire day, from beginning to end, had been the longest, single most excruciating day of his life. If someone had told him this morning that his day would end in Snape’s old classroom, talking with Malfoy like this was something that they did, he would have laughed in their face. Their Gringotts break-in and subsequent escape felt like a lifetime ago. Had it really been just this morning? Harry had woken up anxious because of their mad idea to rob Gringotts. He should have been a bit more concerned. After all, he had died today.
“Kind of like what you are doing right now?” Harry turned around to look at Draco. He had one eyebrow raised and he looked exhausted. “You are rather a lot of work.” Harry rolled his eyes and turned his gaze back to the lake. Warm arms wrapped around his waist and pulled him in. “Luckily for you, I’m not scared off so easily.”
